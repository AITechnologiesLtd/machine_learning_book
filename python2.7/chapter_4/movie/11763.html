<PRE>NIL BY MOUTH
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>For his directoral debut, Gary Oldman chose a highly personal family
drama about a violent, alcoholic husband and father, and the various
lives he affects.  But while the characters, places and events may have
special meaning to the writer-director, the audience is left in the
dark.</P>
<P>The center of this tale is the abusive Raymond (Ray Winstone), and the
film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him.  He spends his
days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars.  Then, he
returns home to his pregnant wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke) and their
five-year-old daughter.</P>
<P>Raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies (and his paranoid delusions)
early on when he accuses Valerie's brother, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles),
of stealing.  Raymond then proceed to beat (and bite) him to a bloody
wreck.  But these are the least of Billy's problems.  Billy is a heroin
addict on the downturn, and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer.</P>
<P>Billy and Valerie's mother, Janet (Laila Morse), is Raymond's nemesis.
She disapproves of him (and he of her), but is powerless to do anything
about it.  She merely struggles on, hoping her children will survive
their respective torments.</P>
<P>If this description seems bleak, I haven't told the half of it.  This is
not a cheery movie, and most of the time it's downright depressing.
While at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes Raymond
tick, and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him,  in the end,
it's not quite worth it.</P>
<P>There are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or
no purpose. Take for example the extended sequence where one of Billy's
scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy.  The film is filled with these
"character moments" that never really achieve anything.  Granted, there
are a few genuinely powerful (and sickening) moments in the film, but
their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than
us.</P>
<P>The actors do a fine job, particularly in the central roles.  The good
thing about an actor turned writer is that Oldman knows how to write
good scenes, and the actors in Nil By Mouth have some meat they can tear
into.</P>
<P>The bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to
restrain
Oldman from making poor choices.  A good character drama should mean
something to
those involved in making the film AND the audience.  Oldman got it about
half right.</P>
