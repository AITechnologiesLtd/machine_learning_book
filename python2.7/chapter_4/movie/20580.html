<PRE>                            STIR OF ECHOES
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This story is based on a lesser novel
          by horror master Richard Matheson.  It involves
          ghosts and telepathy, is atmospheric, and told with
          a great deal of tension.  Unfortunately the plot
          could have used a few twists and surprises.  The
          story is much too straightforward for its own good.
          Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     As I was sitting at the Toronto Film Festival last year waiting
for the screening of APT PUPIL I spoke to the woman next to me who
claimed to really love horror, especially Stephen King.  I asked if she
was also a fan of Richard Matheson.  "Who?"  Richard Matheson is one of
the most important names in American horror fiction, TV, and cinema.
She pulled a copy of Steven King's DANSE MACABRE, a study of American
horror, from a bag she carried and found that yes, there were
references to Richard Matheson.  I should hope so.  Matheson may not
have the name recognition of a King or a Koontz, but he has been behind
everything important in horror and some spilling over into fantasy and
science fiction since the 1950s.  Both King and Koontz freely admit
large debts to Matheson.  Matheson was really the major force to move
the setting of horror stories out of castles in Eastern Europe and into
American suburbia.</P>
<P>     Matheson first got involved with film when his novel THE SHRINKING
MAN was adapted into the film THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN.  Only Rod
Serling provided more stories that were dramatized on THE TWILIGHT
ZONE.  Matheson wrote most of Roger Corman's film adaptations of Poe in
the 60s.  He scripted THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (a.k.a. THE DEVIL'S BRIDE)
one of the best films from Hammer Films. Matheson adapted the novel THE
NIGHT STALKER for TV.  He wrote THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE and SOMEWHERE
IN TIME, based on his own novels.  He wrote DUEL based on his own
story.  DUEL was one of the first films to bring serious attention to
Stephen Spielberg.  The lady in Toronto entered the theater passing a
large standup ad for WHAT DREAMS MAY COME adapted from the novel by
Richard Matheson. That is about 45 years that Matheson has been a force
to reckon with in horror in the visual media.  STIR OF ECHOES is based
on the novel A STIR OF ECHOES by Richard Matheson.</P>
<P>     Tom Witzky (played by Kevin Bacon) is a sort of lower middle class
telephone lineman in an older suburb of Chicago.  His main
entertainments involve beer and sports.  Both he and his wife Maggie
(Kathryn Erbe) are vaguely dissatisfied with their downbeat existence.
Their son Jake (Zachary David Cope) seems to live in his own world
talking to an imaginary friend, Samantha.  Maggie has a male-hating
friend Lisa (Illeana Douglas) who is in training to be a hypno-
therapist.  One night at a party Tom makes fun of Lisa's profession and
Lisa suggests he allow her to hypnotize him.  She leaves him with a
post-hypnotic suggestion to be more "leave his mind open."  The
suggestion works too well. Tom's mind is open to more than just a few
new ideas; it is open to some forces in the universe better left alone.
He starts having disturbing and graphic nightmares, continuations of
visions he had under hypnosis, and worse, now he sees Samantha himself.
And she looks to him like a walking corpse.  Tom starts to associate
this ghostly apparition with a neighbor girl named Samantha who
disappeared from the neighborhood some months before.  Slowly he
becomes obsessed with proving his visions of Samantha are real and that
she must have been murdered in his house.</P>
<P>     David Koepp has been a writer on several big-ticket films of the
recent years including CARLITO'S WAY, JURASSIC PARK, THE SHADOW,
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, THE TRIGGER EFFECT (which he also directed), THE
LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, and MEN IN BLACK.  Here he both writes and
directs; though the film is based on a novel by Richard Matheson.  He
does have a nice hand with mood as he keeps the lighting subdued and
sets the film in an older neighborhood to create more atmosphere.  The
latter is a curious move on his part having written the screenplay.
The novel, written in 1958, is set in a then modern suburb.  The story
could well have been set in the neighborhood where POLTERGEIST was set
instead of this old Chicago neighborhood.  But the script explicitly
calls attention to the fact that the house is new or at least that the
Witzkys are the first people who have ever lived in the house.  The
line makes no sense in a house this old.  I also note with pleasure a
nod to Richard Matheson in that a babysitter is reading his THE
SHRINKING MAN.  (And given that it is an old edition and was probably
purchased in Chicago.  The odds say she got it at the bookstore The
Stars Our Destination.)  The setting does not always work and a little
doctoring of the script might have made the film make more sense.</P>
<P>     This is a tense and atmospheric film.  Kevin Bacon does a
convincing job of playing the working class main character.  But in the
final analysis there is not much new in the film.  To be memorable it
would have to build up to something a little less prosaic.  I rate it a
6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
