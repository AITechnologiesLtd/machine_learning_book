<P>     On the face of it, there seems little that is exceptional,
storywise,with this reworking of the vampire myth.  A young farmhand
(Adrian Pasdar) meets up and falls in love with a young woman (Jenny
Wright) who happens to belong to a clan of vampires.  Once smitten (not
to mention bitten), he finds himself dependent on their wiles to
survive.  Naturally, he resists.  If this sounds like THE LOST BOYS,
also released in 1987, then you'll probably realize why NEAR DARK
became a victim of bad timing and lost attention at the box office.</P>
<P>     NEAR DARK is, however, a treat for horror fans.  The vampires are
genuinely scary--not so much by dint of their supernatural powers as by
their contemporary, thuggish attitudes towards violence (There's a
bratty kid who, as in Anne Rice's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, is bitter
with the knowledge that he is doomed to eternal life and will never be
able to "grow up"--he's like a social worker's worst nightmare).  Other
films in the vampire boom of the late eighties (e.g.  FRIGHT NIGHT,
VAMP, INNOCENT BLOOD) revitalized the myth by using urban American
settings and putting a quirky spin on their stories.  NEAR DARK is
different in that it doesn't play for laughs, and has the notable
distinction of avoiding nearly every image associated with vampires.
There are no wielded crucifixes, bats, wooden stakes, bloodstained
fangs--in fact, the word "vampire" isn't even mentioned--we are just
expected from our knowledge of popular folklore to assume they are so.
That they are creatures of the night is emphasized by their one true
fear:  daylight.  The title of the film points out how their lives are
dictated by the sunset-sunrise cycle.  This is, for all intensive
purposes, the only enemy these vampires have.  They are too savvy to
worry about stakes and crucifixes because they know that modern society
has no time or belief invested in their legend.  This group, roaring
across-country  in their blacked-out van, are successful survivors
because they have transcended the old-world thinking (and portrayal) of
traditional vampires and become the serial killer equivalent more
befitting  the psyche of the late 20th century. The arid desert setting
and menace of the sun help us empathize with the vampires' thirst.
Kathryn Bigelow's direction is broody and assured--the scene in which
the vampires take their time dispatching of their victims in a diner
will definitely be cut for television!  Tangerine Dream contribute
their customary one-size-fits-all score.</P>
