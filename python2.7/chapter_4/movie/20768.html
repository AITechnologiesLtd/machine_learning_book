<P>THE HAUNTING (M).  
(Dreamworks/UIP)
Director: Jan De Bont
Stars: Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Owen Wilson, Bruce 
Dern, Marian Seldes, Todd Field, Virginia Madsen
Running time: 115 minutes.</P>
<P>Robert Wise's The Haunting, his 1963 adaptation of Shirley
Jackson's novel The Haunting Of Hill House, is still highly regarded
as an effectively spooky film and a classic of the haunted house
genre.  In this unnecessary and boring remake, Jan De Bont, the former
cinematographer turned director (Speed, Twister, etc) throws $100
million worth of special effects and Gothic production design at the
screen, but the final result lacks any sort of shocks and thrills.</P>
<P>The Haunting is a rather dull, tired and clichéd horror
film.  It is also incredibly silly!  The script features some of the
most banal and clichéd dialogue uttered in a mainstream film for
several years, and will induce more groans than the supposed ghost
story.  Liam Neeson gives his most somnambulistic performance since
The Phantom Menace - it's interesting to note that the bigger the
budget, the more lacklustre his performance.</P>
<P>Neeson plays Dr Marrow, a psychologist who is conducting
studies into the dynamics of fear.  Under the guise of conducting an
experiment for insomnia, Marrow lures three young subjects to the
creepy 130 year old Hill House for a week.  Nell (indie regular Lili
Taylor, recently seen in Pecker) has spent the past eleven years
caring for her terminally ill mother, and is eager for a chance to
earn some money.  Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is a brash, bisexual
artist, while Luke (Owen Wilson) is a cynical, irresponsible joker.</P>
<P>Marrow feeds the group stories about the sprawling mansion's
history - a childless industrialist who built numerous rooms for the
children he would never had - to unnerve them, and settles back to
monitor their reactions.  Unfortunately, the house is genuinely
haunted by the ghosts of hundreds of dead children lured to the
mansion.  The house is also possessed by the malevolent spirit of the
increasingly deranged and bitter millionaire.  The ghostly apparitions
seem to respond to something in the sensitive Nell, who is slowly
seduced by the house's invisible spirits.  Meanwhile, the rest of the
group react towards the mysterious noises and other inexplicable
phenomena as the possessed house seems to come alive.</P>
<P>De Bont and his technical crew throw a barrage of computer
generated effects at the screen, but there is very little here that is
genuinely scary or unsettling.  The film certainly looks impressive,
due largely to Eugenio Zanetti's grand production design, Karl Walter
Lindenlaub's cinematography, and the jarring, loud score from Jerry
Goldsmith.</P>
<P>But De Bont and co have spent too much time on the visual
style of the film and not enough on creating characters that we care
about.  The tired performances from the solid cast seem to reflect the
overall lack of credibility.</P>
