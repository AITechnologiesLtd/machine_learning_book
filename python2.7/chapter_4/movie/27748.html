THE WIDOW OF SAINT-PIERRE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>What does a little town do if they condemn a murderer to death and they 
have neither the means nor the man to carry out the sentence?  Based on 
a true story, the movie is set in 1849 on the remote French island of 
Saint-Pierre, off the coast of Newfoundland.  Without a guillotine or an 
executioner, the town is forced to wait.</P>
<P>THE WIDOW OF SAINT-PIERRE (LA VEUVE DE SAINT-PIERRE) reunites the male 
lead (Daniel Auteuil), writer (Claude Faraldo) and director (Patrice 
Leconte) of last year's art house hit, THE GIRL ON THE BRIDGE, about the 
sexy art of knife throwing.  Like THE GIRL ON THE BRIDGE, the script is 
again a bit thin, but the acting is quite good, and Eduardo Serra's 
cinematography is chillingly evocative.  You've seen Serra's stunning 
work most recently in UNBREAKABLE and most spectacularly in WHAT DREAMS 
MAY COME.</P>
<P>After being promptly tried and convicted of murder, Neel Auguste (Emir 
Kusturica) is sent to wait indefinitely in a cell in the island's 
military compound.  Luckily for him, the wife of the captain in charge 
turns out to a woman with extremely liberal ideas when it comes to 
prisoner's rights.  "Men are bad one day and good the next.  I'm sure of 
that," she says.   Known as Madame La, a shortened version of Madame La 
Capitaine, she is played warmly by Juliette Binoche, the recent Oscar 
nominee for CHOCOLAT, an honor that she didn't really deserve.  She is 
good here as she is in CHOCOLAT, but neither performance is worthy of an 
Academy Award.  There is an important difference between good and great.</P>
<P>Living on the second floor of the compound, the captain (Auteuil) and 
his wife begin treating the convict with the graciousness that one would 
accord a guest.  With an unlocked cell, Neel is free to come and go at 
will.  A sweet and gentle man who made one hideous mistake in his life, 
Neel would no sooner bolt for his freedom than your kids would leave 
forever if you didn't lock the door.</P>
<P>The relationship among this unusual threesome, the career soldier, the 
soldier's wife and the criminal, evolves in ways both predictable and 
quite unpredictable.  The prisoner goes from being scorned by the 
townsfolk to being a local hero.  The civilian authorities, however, 
view him as nothing more than an embarrassment and a big thorn in their 
sides.</P>
<P>When it begins to look like Neel's execution may be carried out, the 
working class members of the island start to revolt.  A never 
satisfactorily explored subtheme involves the political undercurrents of 
that period of French history.  "Uprising strengthen regimes that they 
don't overthrow," the head of the island government, quoting Victor 
Hugo, says of the potential for revolutionary acts among the local 
peasants.  It is a cocky attitude, but that was a time when the ruling 
class had a much better chance of keeping their heads than did those of 
lesser means.  Or did they?  THE WIDOW OF SAINT-PIERRE makes you want to 
crack open your history books and learn more.   It's an intriguing tale.</P>
<P>THE WIDOW OF SAINT-PIERRE runs 1:47.  The film is in French with English 
subtitles.  It is rated R for a scene of sexuality and brief violence 
and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
