<PRE>Rating: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Rated R for strong language, crude sexual humor, violence and some nudity.</P>
<P>Voices.....Trey Parker, Matt Stone, George Clooney, Minnie Driver.
"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" is undoubtedly crude, offensive,
mean-spirited movie, that comes off as a politcally correct movie too. If your
Canadian, a strong Christian, fat, gay or anything else, you will be offended.
But when you watch this movie, there is no doubt that you will laugh.</P>
<P>Based on the wildly popular Comedy Central TV show, South Park stars Cartman,
an overweight , foul-mouthed kid, with attitude, and a sweet side. Kenny, a
poor kid who gets killed in every episode, and talks with his coat hood
covering his head. Stan a regular, sometimes boring kid who has problems with
women. And Kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop.</P>
<P>The movie opens with a funny, but messageable song, that all of the people of
South Park sing. Cartman, Stan, Kenny and Kyle are very excited to see the new
Terrance And Phillip (Beavis and Butthead types) movie "Asses of Fire". But
when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets, they learn the movie is
rated R, which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 cannot get in
without a parent or legal guardian. The kids do not understand this, and they
pay a homeless man to buy their tickets.</P>
<P>While in the movie, laughing at the movie, Terrance and Phillip cuss repeatedly
entertaining the kids. They kids then go out and cuss themselves, getting in
trouble and causing Kyle's mom to go against the MPAA. While doing this Kenny
learns a thing or to, by proving to Cartman he can light his fart on fire.
Kenny does so, dies, and goes to hell, to find out that Satan and Saddam
Huiessan (homosexual lovers), are about to take over the world, if Terrance and
Phillip die.</P>
<P>>From here on, nothing more should be said to keep the rest a surprise. But
believe me, this isn't your regular South Park TV show, and should not be seen
by anyone under 14 or more. This film contains extreme profanity (over 130 "f"
words and a collection of others). But beyond being bad in a tasteless type
way, South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut has many messages that are embedded
inside it. But I bet you will not leave the movie, for at least laughing one
time or more. And enjoying yourself. Take it from me, South Park: B, L, and U,
isn't as good as you'd hope, but it is good for some laughs.</P>
<P>Reviewed: July 14th, 1999.
