<PRE>                             AMOS AND ANDREW
                       A film review by David Pimmel
                        Copyright 1993 David Pimmel</PRE>
<P>Starring Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson, Dabney Coleman
Rated PG-13 for language, adult humor</P>
<PRE>Synopsis
========</PRE>
<P>     Andrew Sterling (Samuel L. Jackson) is mistaken for a burglar in
his own home and is shot at by the police.  Upon discovery of the
truth, Sheriff Tolliver (Dabney Coleman) brings in Amos O'Dell
(Nicholas Cage) for spin control, putting him up as an armed assailant
who really did the shooting.  Of course, all good plans go astray.</P>
<PRE>Review
======</PRE>
<P>     This film seems to suffer from confusion about what it is trying
to accomplish.  It drifts between slap stick, dark comedy and social
satire.  The end result is that it doesn't seem to get anywhere.  There
are some real funny bits and also some real interesting serious parts,
but in the end I was left wondering what was the point.</P>
<P>     Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite performers because he seems to
always pick likable losers to play.  Here he steps into the same role
again and brings very little new to it.  He seems to be going through
the motions more than giving it his all.  Jackson is much the same
way.  Coleman provides some of the best parts of the film while
simultaneously providing some of the most unoriginal and uninspired
work of the film.  Don't get me wrong there are some very interesting
parts to the film.</P>
<P>     Now that I've said what is wrong I would like to mention some of
what is right about the film.  The parts dealing with social satire
work very well.  At its core this is a film about a supposedly liberal
white community not wanting to integrate.  The scenes involving the
stuffed shirt local couple were my favorite in the film.  Here the film
is a success.  The slap stick humor doesn't work nearly as well, being
on one occasion, painfully uninteresting.  But the social satire is
dead on target.</P>
<P>     In summary, while the film is very uneven, at certain points it
hits very strong highs.  Unfortunately the pendulum swings both ways
and there is an equal number of things that don't work or are
uninteresting.</P>
<PRE>Rating
======</PRE>
<PRE>No thumb up or down.  ** 1/2 out of ****
