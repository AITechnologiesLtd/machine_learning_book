<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>How many times have you saw a well-known model or music star try their hand 
at acting? It happens quite often, and usually has disastrous results. Even 
though Madonna has made several film appearances, I still don't find her that 
good of an actress. This picture will probably do nothing to forward her (or 
Rupert Everett's for that matter) acting career. The material presented here 
is just way too soapy and extremely sad to do anything good for the two of 
them, or anything good for the audience.</P>
<P>Abbie (Madonna) is one hip forty year-old chick. She has her own yoga studio, 
friends, and a good life, but she wants more. Her husband Kevin (Michael 
Vartan from Never Been Kissed), is leaving her and she's afraid that she lost 
her only remaining chance to have a baby. Her biological clock is ticking. 
Seeking support and refuge, she spends the night at Robert's (Rupert Everett) 
house, her gay best friend. During a wild night, they consume one too many 
drinks, and the two of them have sex. Abbie discovers that she's pregnant and 
they decide to raise the baby together.</P>
<P>Things go well with their son Sam (Malcolm Stumpf) for several years. Then 
Abbie meets Ben (Bratt), a charming businessman from New York who decides to 
take a yoga class when he gets wrong directions to a gym. He asks her out for 
dinner and while at first Robert seems excited for Abbie, he starts doing all 
he can to sabotage the relationship. Since Abbie and Robert never married, he 
never had legal rights to the child, but when Ben proposes, what does that 
mean for the future of him and Sam?</P>
<P>I have divided this film into two halves. The film changes pace very quickly, 
just when things get going someone has to stop the thing for some added and 
unneeded drama. What starts out as a mildly funny comedy turns itself into a 
vicious custody battle drama, and to tell you the truth, none of it is all 
that interesting. I was drawn to Robert from the beginning, and he gives the 
audience someone to root for, but Abbie is a complete mystery. She's 
uninteresting from the start, and especially gets annoying when she starts 
caring more about herself, than about her child. The performances are pretty 
bad, considering Everett and Lynn Redgrave is in the cast. Madonna is god 
awful for beyond reasons I could list in this review, Bratt does nothing but 
look good and smile, and Everett is surprisingly duller than usual. The 
script does little to help, and shifts genres too quickly as I mentioned 
before. The movie does make great use of Don McLean's song "American Pie," 
it's featured twice in the movie, and Madonna did a cover of it for the 
credits. It is probably the only highlight of the movie.</P>
<P>This is just another Hollywood drama that goes all out to make people cry. 
I'm sure it will succeed. For people looking for a little happiness that the 
film's marketing promotes, you're better off renting Everett's An Ideal 
Husband. He's much more charming and funny in that picture, and the 
supporting cast is all there as well. This movie is in no way good, fun, or 
interesting, and it's not the next best thing to any of those either.</P>
