<PRE>Beloved (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>In her 1988 novel Beloved, Toni Morrison mints the word "rememory."  
Although Jonathan Demme's film does not make use of the word, its 
connections are there, reminding us that memories are what we're made 
of;  more insistently, they are what we cannot escape from.</P>
<P>The film stands as a personal history of pain inflicted by slavery and 
by hatred built against blacks during the Reconstruction era.  The 
product is part romance, part ghost tale, part indictment of American 
society 100 years after some of its citizens declared themselves free.  </P>
<P>The person at the center is Sethe (pronounced SET-ta and played by Oprah 
Winfrey).  We meet her and what's left of her family in 1865, just a few 
years after their traumatic flight from slavery.  Her children include 
boys Howard and Buglar, their younger sister Denver and, disturbingly, 
the menacing ghost of another daughter, Beloved.  Until the time of her 
death as an infant, the baby had been called "crawling already?".  Now, 
in the 1870's, Beloved is terrorizing the family, injuring the dog "Here 
Boy" and causing her brothers to stuff a rucksack full of food and run 
off.</P>
<P>Almost as unsettling as the flashback in which the baby dies, the scenes 
of her poltergeist-like violence grip the viewer.  Demme directs them 
with a rapid pace.  It's a relief that they end only a few minutes into 
the film, when Paul D (Danny Glover) enters and puts up an angry 
resistance.  The kitchen has been destroyed (in the book it takes Paul 
weeks to mend the furniture) but the manifestations are apparently gone.  
Despite resentment from Denver (Kimberly Elise), Paul D stays and 
develops a relationship with Sethe.  His presence is like a redemption 
after 18 years of wandering and fleeing and witnessing the degradation 
of other blacks.  Perhaps Paul's romance with Sethe begins through their 
common ties: they were owned by a brutal Kentuckian known as 
"schoolteacher"; but the most peaceful time in the film follows the two 
old friends' falling in love.</P>
<P>It's been ten years since the first stages of the film's production - 
since the book won Morrison the Pulitzer (later she received the Nobel 
Prize in Literature, the first African American woman so recognized).  
As one of the producers, Winfrey no doubt had strong creative control.  
One of the results is the brilliant casting.  First, Winfrey herself 
sketches Sethe with a character and strength that is almost 
indestructible.  Her role in The Color Purple showed us her canny and 
solid screen presence, and this film makes us realize the scarcity of 
her roles since.  Winfrey endows Sethe with just the right ways, her 
stares knowing, her gestures purposeful, her words picked to both assert 
and guard her spirit.  In a scene outside the restaurant where she 
works, Sethe is flattered that Paul has come to pick her up.  Instantly 
her expression turns to consternation when she suspects Paul will 
announce he is leaving her, and just as easily she beams when Paul says, 
"I want you pregnant!"  The face of a lesser actress could not 
accomplish such a range.</P>
<P>As the title character, Thandie Newton delivers a startling performance.  
>From the time she tramps out of a creek, dressed in dark colors and new 
shoes, and collapses on the bank to sleep, she lends a creepy presence 
to the story.  Beetles engulf her as we hear the rasp of her snore.  
Later she turns up in front of Sethe's house, propped scarecrow-like --  
a turning point.  What is not clear is why Sethe does not realize that 
here is a living wraith, the incarnation of the child that previously 
haunted the house and their lives, making them a family of outcasts even 
among blacks.  The young woman - she appears as the age she would be in 
life - croaks out the letters in her name, but it is not until later 
that Sethe's daughter Denver realizes the stranger's identity.  In her 
portrayal of Beloved, Newton is appropriately clumsy and regressive in 
speech: she's reminiscent of those who have been aroused from a coma and 
act much less than their age.</P>
<P>After seeing Danny Glover as Paul D. Garner, it's hard to imagine any 
other actor in the role.  He brings a veteran instinct that telegraphs 
the story's direction clearly.  At times gentle, swaggering, aggressive, 
disillusioned, Paul D leaves his mark as a man who cares and who accepts 
the responsibilities he lays out for himself.  Because Paul is so 
straightforward and strong, we are all the more disheartened when the 
creature from beyond his world mesmerizes him.  Is Beloved carrying out 
a sort of revenge for Paul's ousting her possessive spirit?  Among the 
most riveting patterns in the plot are the scenes in which Paul finds 
himself repulsed by sleeping in Sethe's room; he moves to a rocking 
chair to an empty bed in a spare room, to a shed across the back field.  
It's here that we see the consummation of the second hellish scene to 
take place in the shed. </P>
<P>Baby Suggs is one of Toni Morrison's most memorable characters.  She is 
the mother of Halle, one of the Sweet Home slaves owned by Mr. Garner.  
Halle has worked extra to buy his mother and send her north, across the 
Ohio River to Cincinnati.  Morrison is masterful in showing how 
slaveowners were oblivious to the humanity of their captives.  Even 
though he is one of the more humane owners, Garner is not aware of Baby 
Suggs' name; he calls her "Jenny Whitlow" from her original sale papers.  
In the film, Beah Richards achieves the right status of nurturerer and 
prophet.  Grandma Baby, Sethe's mother-in-law and Denver's grandmother, 
preaches atop a rock in the woods, bringing her listeners wisdom and 
hope.  She is called "holy" in the book, and proved so in the film.  
"Love your flesh" and "Kiss your hands," she intones, and we see more of 
the body imagery that spreads throughout the work.  </P>
<P>As Denver, Kimberly Elise also shows a variety of moods.  Hateful toward 
Paul D, protective of her reclaimed big sister, finally mature at the 
end, Denver's story ends happily.  In a namesake role - Amy Denver, who 
delivers Sethe's child beneath the surface of the Ohio (again, water 
images) - Kessia Randall is perfectly talkative and compassionate.  And 
as Stamp Paid - another of Morrison's wonderful names - Albert Hall 
plays well as an ex-slave who delivers Sethe to Baby, and who later 
delivers a revelation to Paul D.</P>
<P>Because Morrison's novel is not a linear narrative, the film resorts to 
a risky series of flashbacks.  These slices of past lives, many of them 
disconcerting in their depiction of abuse and murder, are shot in grainy 
and incandescent tones, helping us to distinguish them from the main 
plotline.  Even though some of the scenes resemble bad videotape, the 
craftsmanship of storytelling has to be admired.  The soundtrack is also 
remarkable, made up of period instruments, voices, and curiously 
effective sounds of insects and birds.</P>
<P>The film's astonishing content does not quite fill its nearly three 
hours.  Editing down the last quarter of the story would have made for 
tighter composition.  No matter how riveting the story, viewers have 
time to look at their watches, an indication of a saggy pace.</P>
<P>Why the filmmakers shot the bulk of the film around Philadelphia instead 
of Cincinnati, I don't know.  The city locations grab our eyes, after so 
much of the story is told around Sethe's farmhouse.  Names like 
"Shillito's", an early Cincinnati department store, show the attention 
to detail paid by the set designers.  We are treated to vistas of the 
muddy Ohio, the distant sky beclouded by industrial smoke.  A hog 
capital before Chicago, Cincinnati is seen as a typical heartland town.  
Very appropriate, considering Morrison adapted a story that appeared in 
the January 29 and 30 editions of the Cincinnati Enquirer.  The model 
for Sethe was Margaret Garner, a 23 year-old who joined fugitive slaves 
from two farms south of Covington, Kentucky.  The real-life Stamp Paid 
was probably Elijah Kite, an ex-slave who assisted in the Underground 
Railroad.  The Bodwins are given a brief part in the film;  their 
counterpart was Levi Coffin, a Quaker storeowner who was the "president" 
of the Railroad.  Morrison also preserves the number of Margaret's 
children:  Samuel, 5, Thomas, 6, Mary, 3 (the ill-fated Beloved in the 
book), and Silla, a 3 month-old boy.  The Garners' owner was Archibald 
Gaines, part of the dreaded posse that tracked them down.</P>
<P>Considering how important it is to know one's history, it would be good 
if every American citizen were to see Beloved.  Whereas so many films 
are useless, Beloved proves itself a useful part of our culture.  For 
those interested in researching their ancestry, it is difficult to find 
information farther back than a few generations.  How infinitely more 
difficult to discover the identity of relations who were slaves.  
Beloved is also important as a genealogical study of pain and healing.</P>
