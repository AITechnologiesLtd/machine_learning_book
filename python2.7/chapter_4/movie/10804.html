<P>Spice World is critic-proof. What kind of person would read a review
for this film before going to see it? The young, teenaged girls in
attendance on Friday afternoon certainly weren't concerned with
Ebert's assessment (he already declared it the worst film of
1998). Let's boil it down: if you like the Spice Girls, you will see
the movie. If you don't like the Spice Girls, you will not see the
movie. If there are such people out there heming and hawing over
whether or not to see this flick, read on.</P>
<P>The Spices, alternately known as Scary, Sporty, Baby, Ginger, and
Posh, respectively, are at the peak of their fame: the papers can't
get enough of them, the fans follow them through the streets, and
there isn't a day off in sight. It is because of this that the
backlash begins, and it's up to harried manager Grant to ward off bad
press, with assistance from a double-talking, animal loving mystery
man at the top (hilariously played by Roger Moore, relishing the
chance to mock Blofeld, James Bond's greatest villain). Meanwhile, two
Hollywood producers (played by George Wendt and Mark McKinney) are
keen to plug the girls into a big-budget movie.</P>
<P>The film unfolds over a one-week period in the girls' lives, during
which they also encounter aliens, a haunted house, and a tour bus
wired to explode. Director Bob Spiers, who helmed every hilarious
episode of the BBC's "French & Saunders", has a considerably less
talented main cast to work with here (let's say the Spice Girls do not
possess crack comic timing), and his attempt to fill out the remaining
roles with old pros is only somewhat successful, due to Fuller's
juvenile screenplay. But when things turn surreal--a downpour in an
office, the alien encounter--Spiers is just the man for the job, and
without him the movie could have been entirely witless. And the girls
are at least likeable, although they're better taken in small doses. I
felt after this film spoiled on too much dime-candy.</P>
<P>Spice World ultimately could use more edge. The Spice Girls' image has
been softened over time--when they first appeared, for instance, they
were frank and unsparing in their sex talk--and the movie
complies. While the filmmakers do poke fun at them, it is with a
gloved finger. There is nothing biting about this mockumentary (if one
can call it that); if it were a Spice World, after all, the world
would be very bland indeed.</P>
