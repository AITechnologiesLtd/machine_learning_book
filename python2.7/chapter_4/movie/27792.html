<PRE>                              CHOCOLAT
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: To a straight-laced French village
          comes a woman with the message that life is to
          be enjoyed and not simply endured.  The woman
          opens a chocolate shop and sows the seeds of a
          belief in human potential laced with a little
          self-indulgence.  With five Academy Award
          nominations, this American film set in France is
          more a parable than a realistic story and it is
          a theme that director Lasse Hallstrom has
          visited before.  But the film is itself, like
          the chocolates it shows, a pleasure.  Rating: 7
          (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Lasse Hallstrom's new film is a parable about believing in
oneself and even more on getting a little joy from life.  It is a
contrived story in which the good guys are a little too good and the
bad guys are obvious.  But its message is disarming and sweetened
with tempting visions of chocolate that seduce the viewer.  But it
is getting a following in a time when so many of the popular films
are pushing nihilism and showing violence.</P>
<P>     In a little French village life is painted like the village
itself in tones of brown and gray.  Everyone knows his place and
knows exactly what is expected of him.  Those who forget their
responsibilities are quickly reminded.  Pleasure is for the most
part to be deferred for the next life.  Instead life is piety and
submission.  But in 1959, as Lent is approaching, a mysterious woman
Vianne (Juliette Binoche) arrives in town with her daughter and in
the shadow of the church at the beginning of Lent sets up a
chocolate shop.  Vianne is immediately countered by the forces of
convention and of self-denial.  These forces are marshalled and lead
by the town's mayor the Comte de Reynard (fine comic actor Alfred
Molina).  Slyly Reynard affirms his number-one position by turning
the townspeople against Vianne and the change she is bringing.  He
and Vianne are poles apart and the little French town is
figuratively and nearly literally not big enough for the two of
them.</P>
<P>     At the same time some who are lower in the town's pecking order
are giving in to the temptations of self-indulgence and even
breaking from their established places.  The respectable people of
the town side with the mayor, but the marginal people, those who
normally get swept aside, become friends with Vianne and find they
enjoy her sweet chocolate and her easy friendship.  For those in the
middle, between the mayor and Vianne, there is the constant
temptation of all that chocolate.  One of the women who joins the
circle of friends is Josephine Muscat (Lina Olin) whose brutish
husband Serge (Peter Stormare, who played the quiet killer in FARGO)
owns the local saloon and beats Josephine when he is drunk.  Another
of Vianne's circle is an old woman, Armande Voizin (Judi Dench),
nearly disowned by her family.</P>
<P>     While CHOCOLAT is not ultimately negative on religion, the
alliance between the young priest and the mayor is looked on as one
of the negative forces in the town.  Too often the local priest
takes a cold and unfriendly stance.  The pleasures of chocolate are
said to be evil.  A dog, we are told, has no soul.  But the rules of
Lent still apply to the dog.  The historic town hero is remembered
for having turned out the Huguenots.  In the end the film is a
little pat, even for the parable that it is.  The ending is a little
contrived and not quite believable.</P>
<P>     There seem to be two major themes in the photography (at
least).  One is the color in the town.  It is drab grays and browns
until Vianne arrives in her bright red cloak and hood.  Echoing
ideas of PLEASANTVILLE, though in a more subtle fashion, Vianne
brings color to the village.  Her shop is bright with color, while
the rest of the town is muted in color.  Vianne has the courage to
break from the dismal color scheme and bring some life to the
village.  The other theme is tempting the audience with luscious
photography of chocolate.  Like BABETTE'S FEAST and LIKE WATER FOR
CHOCOLATE, this is a film that seduces the viewer with its
photography of food.</P>
<P>     CHOCOLAT is generating some controversy; it seems to be a film
people either love or hate.  For my part I rate it a 7 on the 0 to
10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
