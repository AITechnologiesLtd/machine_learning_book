<P>ONE TRUE THING
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)
Universal / 2:07 / 1998 / R (language, thematic elements)
Cast: Meryl Streep; Renee Zellweger; William Hurt; Tom Everett Scott; 
Lauren Graham; Nicky Katt; James Eckhouse 
Director: Carl Franklin 
Screenplay: Karen Croner <HR>In "One True Thing," Meryl Streep's Kate Gulden, a middle-aged mother of 
two, makes her grand entrance dispensing generous advice and big hugs, 
baking a chocolate cake and proudly flaunting her homemade "Wizard of 
Oz" Dorothy attire, complete with yarn pigtails, in preparation for a 
costume party. Right away, you identify with this woman; she's the kind 
of mom you either have, had or wish you had - loving, tolerant, creative 
in a way that puts Martha Stewart to shame and perhaps just a little bit 
of a nuisance. Or too much of a nuisance, her daughter Ellen (Renee 
Zellweger) might say, and a silly, simple, doting domestic archetype on 
top of that. </P>
<P>Ellen's very much the child of her father, an esteemed English professor 
named George (William Hurt), and has followed in his footsteps since she 
was a young child. Now, she's a career-driven reporter for "New York" 
magazine, and when she travels to her Pennsylvania hometown to celebrate 
George's birthday, she hangs on every word of his somewhat too-harsh 
criticism of her writing. But Ellen appears to be at a loss when it 
comes to handling the double-whammy that Kate has developed cancer, and 
her dad, too busy with his job, wants her to leave the city life to help 
out. She reluctantly complies, and begins to see her mother in a whole 
different light as a result. </P>
<P>The story might sound like fodder for a TV-movie-of-the-week, but "One 
True Thing" really couldn't be further removed from mawkish sentiment. 
Director Carl Franklin, taking a break from gritty crime-dramas like 
"One False Move" and "Devil in a Blue Dress," shows admirable restraint 
in his handling of the Guldens' crisis. It would be far too easy to turn 
the film into a scene after scene of button-pushing manipulation, but 
Franklin and screenwriter Karen Croner, adapting Anna Quindlen's novel, 
don't linger over the devastating details of the disease. Instead, their 
concentration is on the bond between parent and child, more specifically 
how little the latter truly knows about the former. </P>
<P>Of course, the one-two acting punch of Streep and Zellweger only 
enhances Thing's thoughtful, universal focus. Streep could play this 
type of role in her sleep, but that doesn't make her performance any 
less special - you really see her as this strong, admirable maternal 
whirlwind and not some 10-time Oscar nominee who deserves another award 
for her work here. Zellweger plays off Streep's sing-songy tones 
perfectly; her ultimate transformation is a heart-breaking one because 
she makes the loss of this woman she's just beginning to deeply 
understand painfully palpable. A sequence where Ellen grapples with a 
monumental decision while preparing Kate's dinner is an emotional doozy. </P>
<P>Happy stuff it's not, but neither does "One True Thing" wallow in somber 
unpleasantness. Even with Bette Midler tunes and maudlin piano chords 
dotting the soundtrack, this is one classy tearjerker, gentle and ever 
so undemanding the way it finally reduces you to a state of disquieted 
calm. And though the film might send audiences away questioning the 
manner in which they live their lives and inhabit their relationships, 
it ends on a hopeful, uplifting note, imploring all within earshot to 
cherish those who love you before they're gone forever. As soon as the 
credits hit the screen, there's no doubt that "One True Thing" is the 
run-home-from-the-theatre-and-hug-your-mom movie of the year.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"The best possible argument for including [a shot of Bruce] Willis' 
genitals would have been that the movie, after all, contains everything 
else." -- Roger Ebert on "Color of Night"</P>
