<PRE>                                THREESOME
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     THREESOME is one of those movies where you must be able to suspend
disbelief from the start; otherwise, the movie has no chance of
working.  Here we have 2 men and a woman who are assigned to the same
room in a coed dorm, but are unable to get reassigned.  Sure.
Actually, it was made plausible enough in the movie (it is actually a
suite with a private single (woman), a private double (men), and a
shared bath) that suspending disbelief turned out to be easy for me.</P>
<P>     The premise of the movie is that person A is attracted to person
B, B to C, and C to A whereas B is not attracted to A, nor C to B, and
nor A to C.  This simple equation gets much more complex as the movie
advances.  All along, they are all quite good friends and have great
times together.</P>
<P>     The show has several points to commend it.  The plot is quite
intriguing.  The character of the woman (Lara Flynn Boyle best seen in
RED ROCK WEST) is well written and well acted.  It is easy to get swept
up in some of the scenes and have vicarious fun along with them.
Boyle's smile and physical emotions were well done and catching.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, the guy's parts were poorly written, especially
the handsome, dumb jock type character (Stephen Baldwin).  Baldwin
needs to take some acting classes rather than relying on getting roles
because of his good looks and his famous brother.  The other guy played
by Josh Charles was mediocre.  I did not believe either of the male
characters.</P>
<P>     With the same plot, but a much better script writer (Andrew
Fleming), a recasting of all of the roles except for Boyle, tighter
editing, and perhaps a different director (Andrew Fleming), this movie
could have worked since it actually had a lot of possibilities.  It was
not a bad movie, but did not come close to what it could have been.</P>
<P>     THREESOME runs only 1:33, but seems longer.  It is rated R for the
seriousness of its material I guess.  I can not recommend it as
constructed although it had good potential.  For Boyle's acting and
energy, I award it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
