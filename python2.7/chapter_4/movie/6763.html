                       A film review by John R. Mellby

<P>John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Klein, Michael Palin
Directed by Robert Young, Produced by Michael Shamberg, Steve Abbot

<P>As I watched this film it struck me that there aren't many funny movies
being made any more. Oh, we have comedies (some of them even good) such
as Steve Martin's films, and we have silly films (a painful lot of silly
films), but not very many movies which are just trying to be funny.
I can't remember a funny film I saw since "A Fish called Wanda",
which brings us back here.</P>
<P>Some nice friends gave us tickets to a preview of FC. This unites the
cast, producer, and some writers of "A Fish called Wanda". This movie
isn't a sequel but a totally new, and *very* funny picture. The
stars, along with a fierce supporting cast (love the lemurs), along with
some great actors, in running a zoo.</P>
<P>The film centers upon a pair of twits. No, this isn't a misprint
referring to Jamie Lee Curtis, although her twits (oops, er ummm, you
know what I mean) do have a few prominent scenes. We have a ruthless
New Zealand Twit (Kevin Klein) running a business empire where
everything makes 20% profit or it get destroyed, and his son, a
hapless twit (also Kevin Klein) who pretty much stumbles through life.
The son, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese all try to run an English
zoo.</P>
<P>First Cleese trys to make the zoo popular through violence. "All the
creatures must be fierce", hence the title. This fails with many
comic problems. Next, Kevin Klein trys a marketeering approach
where Celebrities sponsor the animals. (I couldn't see who Saddam
Hussain sponsored, so if anyone figures it out, please tell me.)</P>
<P>Along the way, mishaps lead them to think that John Cleese is sleeping
with 3-4 women (and animals) at a time, which attracts Jamie Lee,
and disgusts (and impresses) Klein. The naked tarantula scene was almost
painful to watch.</P>
<P>The take old ideas (people trapped in a hotel room trying to escape
the notice of the real occupants, and do them astoundingly well.
You think they have escaped, and at the last minute they don't
get out. They they almost escape again, and ... well, you get the
picture.</P>
<P>Overall Cleese is as funny as ever. Michael Palin is oddly wedged in,
as if they wrote the movie and discovered they hadn't a role for him,
so they patched him into random scenes. Still he is funny. The
supporting actors (too many to name) are good (even if they
occasionally the bundle so many into a scene that it just gets too
busy).</P>
<P>IMHO this is the funniest movie I've seen in several years.</P>
<P>P.S. You wouldn't think that licking blood of an injured woman's leg
would be funny - but it is!</P>
