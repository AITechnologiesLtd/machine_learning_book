<PRE>Priests with Guns
End of Days</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Are you charmed by Arnold? (I am) Does a big Hollywood movie with Arnold
sound attractive to you? If so, then "End of Days" fits that bill. Arnold
straps lots of cool weapons to his prize-winning body. Arnold takes bullets
to the chest, baseball bats to the skull and an assortment of other would-be
fatal blows. But Arnold seemingly retains his interminatability (as if it
rubbed off from previous roles under different direction). If that's what
you like -- you'll be happy.</P>
<P>If however, you associate Arnold with smart action a la "Terminator," "True
Lies" etc. you may react as did a fellow in the men's room after the show,
"Disappointed!" he frowned shaking his head as he zipped up. Or the snoozing
gentleman in the row behind me ... after the crashing crescendo of the
climax faded, his steadfast snoring could be heard. Even though I was not as
dismayed as these two, it was obvious that "End of Days" didn't deliver the
powerful immensity we've come to expect from Mr. Schwarzenegger.</P>
<P>Here's the plot ... The millennium on the verge, Satan comes back to Earth
in the form of a man, seeking the woman that's been branded to be the mother
of his son (the antichrist we can assume). The Vatican is well aware of this
prophecy and sends an ugly mob of weapon wielding priests to carve her up.
However, there's a group of "good guy" priests dabbling in stigmata research
and therapy that try to protect the innocent would-be anti-Madonna from
(ahem) Satan's little sword. Arnold, a down and out body guard, stumbles
into this mess and ultimately finds himself defending this freaked out girl
from Lucifer himself.</P>
<P>It's a challenge to pretend that it makes sense to fight the prince of
darkness with traditional Hollywood blow up weaponry. As an arch
enemy/villian/bad guy, this Satan is formidable, but as the devil? He's
rather impotent. Though touched on (especially in a good scene in Arnold's
home), Satan's powers of manipulation were sorely underdeveloped. Also
lacking consistancy, Satan shows off the ability to read Arnold's inner most
thoughts, yet he still needs Arnold to voluntarily verbalize where the girl
is hidden. Lastly, the religious dilemma concerning the murder of an
innocent to save the world could have been realized on the screen with
greater sympathy. Instead, the priests with guns seem to take to thuggery as
if it were second nature.</P>
<P>It's one of those action films where things happen so that the next visual
thing can happen -- not necessarily because the transgression is logical or
developmental. "End of Days" sports some powerfully visual special effects,
but fails to lure you in emotionally or even sympathetically. You're just a
watcher. Another viewer quipped, "The film pulls you through it like a dog
on a leash."</P>
<P>But "End of Days" still displays some shining moments: 1) A scene in which
Satan relieves himself on the sidewalk, then sets his own puddle of urine on
fire. 2) Arnold suspecting his best bud to be the devil, lets a bullet make
the decision. 3) Satan's first shocking deed as a man. 4) The final
appearance of Satan in his "real" bat-winged form.</P>
<P>It's not strong on substance (though it could have been), still, I don't
think you'll have a bad time.</P>
