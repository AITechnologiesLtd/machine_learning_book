<PRE>The Replacements </PRE>
<P>It's pretty amazing that we, the movie-going public, will still plunk down 
good money to watch a movie use the same story and the same jokes we've seen 
countless times before. There isn't many original ideas to "The Replacements" 
- a sports comedy about screwball amateur football players who get a chance 
to play in the big leagues - but at least it doesn't crash and burn because 
it does have its moments. </P>
<P>How they got Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman to star in a blatant rip-off of 
the "Major League" movies I'll never know. Those films were borderline 
B-movies and here we have two huge movie stars going through the motions of a 
run-of-the-mill zany comedy. But that's where the movie gets its charm - that 
it's so by-the-book in such an obvious way you can't help but laugh at 
predictable jokes and gags. </P>
<P>Not that the film is the funniest movie ever made or anything like that. The 
fact remains it is unoriginal for the most part and actually tries to get 
away with a generic, totally unbelievable story with all the cliches plugged 
into the right places. </P>
<P>What the movie does have going for it is that for every cliche there's a 
chance for a joke to work. The screenwriters apparently realized this and 
didn't bother to sketch out the characters and instead just give us 
caricatures. Reeves is the token aw-shucks hero, Hackman is the "We gotta 
win, you can do it"-coach. Then there's a large ensemble of supporting guys: 
a beserker cop who is uncontrollable; a pair of fat gangsters who take that 
mentality to the sport; a sumo wrestler; a prisoner on work release; a Welsh 
chain-smoking gambler; and a egotistical clown (played very well by Orlando 
Jones - the guy from those 7-Up commercials). </P>
<P>It's a funny premise with quite a few jokes that pay off, but the screenplay 
takes itself too seriously. With sports movies you have to feel like you're 
watching your favorite team from real life going for the championship - 
that's something you really can't do here. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B- </PRE>
