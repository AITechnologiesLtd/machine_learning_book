<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>Over twenty years ago, when a fictional 70's rock band, Strange Fruit,
disbanded, part of their problem had been in determining which one was the
`star'.  A combination of ego, booze, drugs and sex had led to their
downfall, assisted by a lightning bolt from God himself.</P>
<P>Still Crazy is a good example of an ensemble working together.  Top
billing goes to Stephen Rea as Tony Costello, the keyboard player who has
since been reduced to servicing a condom machine route in Spain.  But, he
is not `the star'.  All of the characters are totally believable as
members of the defunct group, but the memorable performance is given by
Bill Nighy as Ray Simms, the lead singer, whose former good looks had
compensated for his limited ability.  He and his Swedish trophy wife,
Astrid Simms (Helena Bergstrom) live in a mansion that is mortgaged to the
hilt, in dire need of repair, and up for sale.  Each member of the group
is stuck in a job that they dislike, so when the suggestion of a comeback
arises, they each agree.  The problem of ego is still there, but the
drinking, drugs and sex have been reduced to almost non-existent.</P>
<P>There is a lot of good adult humor, none of which is offensive.  The
jokes and sight gags are very real, as is the music.  The haunting `The
Flame Still Burns' will linger with you after you leave the theater. 
You'll also remember `Brian's Theme' and `What Might Have Been'.</P>
<P>It is not a great movie, but it is enjoyable.  Even if you're not an
advocate of Rock music, you'll enjoy the story.  I give it a solid B.  </P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES!    </PRE>
