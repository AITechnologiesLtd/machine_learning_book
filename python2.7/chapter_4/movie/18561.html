<P>[3.5/4.0]  (dialog in Bengali, English subtitles)</P>
<P>This film, with the English title "Song of the Little Road", is the
first component of Satyajit Ray's "Apu Trilogy".</P>
<P>The story begins with the introduction of the Roy family. The anchor
of the Roy family is Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee). Because her husband
Hari (Kanu Bannerjee) is often out of work, she has the difficult duty
of managing all the daily needs of the family with meager resources.
Hari is not overly concerned with the family's plight because he more
concerned with spiritual needs than with material needs. He works odd
jobs as a priest and a clerk so that they scrape by, and he spends his
free time composing his literature. Hari's general view is that
"whatever God does is for the best." Although their most basic needs
are met, Sarbojaya knows that they live a precarious existence. Their
house is in disrepair, their daughter Durga (Runki Banerjee as the
small child, Uma Das Gupta as the adolescent) is acquiring a bad
reputation by stealing fruit from a neighbor's orchard, and it is
sometimes a struggle to make sure everyone has enough to eat. Hari's
elderly aunt, Indir (Chunibala Devi) also lives with the Roys, but
Sarbojaya dislikes how she spoils Durga. Sarbojaya, who is pregnant
as the story opens, eventually gives birth to a son, Apu (Subir
Bannerjee). Because Hari is often away working, Sarbojaya is the
backbone holding the family together.</P>
<P>The family's poverty is no drag on the spirits of the children. Durga
and Apu make their own world adventurous and carefree. Even though
they miss treats like being able to buy sweets from the traveling
candy man, they enrich their lives with the multitude of simple
pleasures available to them. From the joy of getting drenched by the
monsoon, to the thrill of traveling across the countryside to see a
train, Durga and Apu do not miss any pleasures of childhood. It is
only the responsibilities of the adult world that gnaw at the spirit
of the individuals. It is perhaps this specter that keeps Durga from
maturing. Her mother tells her that she should be more helpful in the
household, but Durga's only interest is in playing. As Durga watches
one of her friends get married, she gazes forlornly knowing that it is
difficult for a poor girl to get a marriage arranged. It is as if she
knows impending adulthood cannot be avoided. If she could choose, she
would probably want to spend her entire life as a child.</P>
<P>Although the trilogy is centered around his character, Apu himself has
a diminished role in this story. He is only a young boy through all the
events. The primary characters are really the women, and they symbolize
the major stages of life. The irrepressible Durga represents the
carefree nature of childhood, when dependence on parents allows the
spirit to be free. The somber Sarbojaya represents the heavy
responsibilities of adulthood, when life is a serious matter and the
needs of self and others are a constant struggle. The fragile Indir
represents the precariousness of old age, when the return to dependence
can become a shackle if one is restricted by
poverty.</P>
<P>Perhaps the only aspect that indicates that this film was made decades
ago is the quality of the print. In all other aspects, it displays a
remarkable moderness. Although the story is set in the 1920's, the
issues that it deals with are timeless. Only the absence of
technological advances (motorized vehicles, electric light, etc) and
the style of clothing indicate the time period. All the acting
performances are flawless. This is no small feat considering the depth
to which each character is explored. In terms of cinematography, it is
almost difficult to believe that this was Satyajit Ray's first feature
film. He displays a virtuoso mastery of the medium on par with any
filmmaker, regardless of era. The main narrative is interspersed with
simple and evocative scenes of nature, like water bugs skimming back
and forth over the surface of a pond. These images, along with the
languid pace of the story, serve to underscore the individual's
insignificant presence in the greater universe. Whatever the fate of
the Roy family, the world continues in its eternal rhythms unperturbed.</P>
<P>With this, his first film, Ray immediately established himself as a
master of Indian and international cinema. Although all aspects of
the story are characteristically Indian, he brings out concerns and
struggles shared by people in every corner of the world. This film
deservedly won several international film awards, including the
appropriately named "Best Human Document" at the Cannes Film Festival.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This is an absorbing and moving drama. Ray is
able to portray the vagaries of the human condition in a simple,
poignant story.</P>
