<PRE>GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE
(PG)</PRE>
<PRE>A review by E. Benjamin Kelsey</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>Surely if you're expecting an intelligent film, this is not the one you're
bound to stop on as a cute, brightly lit light bulb appears above your head.
But if you're in the mood for brainless fun for the whole family, GEORGE OF
THE JUNGLE isn't half bad . . . barely.</P>
<P>If the Zucker Brothers/Jim Abrahams team, who produced such off the wall
comedies as AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN, were to collaborate with Disney,
something much like GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE might be the outcome.</P>
<P>Unlike the majority of extremely lame "family" comedies (JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE, MAN
OF THE HOUSE, the 1997 remake of THAT DARN CAT), GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE might
actually make parents feel good about being along for the ride. The sad fact
behind family comedies is that they generally have no real appeal to an older
audience. Brainless slapstick, vulgar jokes, and "funny" faces are the main
ingredients. But GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE actually has wit. People of all ages
will be laughing at some point during the film.</P>
<P>It's nothing overly new of course. And how many times, just HOW MANY TIMES can
 we see people get hit in the groin and still laugh? This movie uses this
overly cliched method of "humor" more than once. Sure, George slams into
things several times in the movie, but that's his trademark. But for crying
out loud, we are also subjected to the "hit groin" ploy three or four times,
an elephant peeing twice, and an ape farting twice. If you do happen to find
them funny the first time, is it really funny to see again a few minutes
later?</P>
<P>So while GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE does have it's problems, it's a lot better than
most family oriented comedies. It is vulgar, at times surprisingly so, but
that's almost expected in movies where kids are going to make up a large part
of the audience. And how many parents out there would find it charming for
their own young ones to fart, burp, urinate, and/or hit someone in the
genitals in order to get a laugh? Not many, but we still seem to allow them
to WATCH it in order to get a laugh. I suppose it will remain that way for a
long time. But I digress, and do hope to stress that I got a lot more out of
GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE than I was expecting! It's fun, and it's dumb. Not a bad
choice for the family's night out.</P>
