<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Hey, you!  Can you quickly name the three clichés that make up the basic
gay film?  The first is obvious – it has to be set in England.  The
second is a bit more subtle – the main character has to have a chubby
female friend that is just as alienated as he is.  The third is optional
 the film must be based on a play written by a guy with the last name
Wilde.</P>
<P>The Wilde in question is not Oscar, but Patrick, and Get Real is based
on his celebrated play What's Wrong With Angry?  The picture begins
promisingly, with a young protagonist Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone)
being forever turned off to both heterosexual activity and ice cream as
a friend incorrectly tells him how babies are made.</P>
<P>As a teenager, Steven appears to be like the rest of his Basingstoke
prep school classmates; his room has a desk and a computer, and its
walls are covered with photos of England's top football players.  The
dodgy student, who doesn't care for the sport, is reduced to ferreting
out potential mates at a varmint-infested bathhouse in the park.  One
day he stumbles upon the popular school jock, John Dixon (Brad Gorton),
who eventually falls for Steven but doesn't want to reveal his
alternative lifestyle to his mates or the rest of the school.</P>
<P>Feeling like it was filmed in (get) real time, the picture slowly winds
its way through sentiments not seen this side of soap operas and bad
after-school specials, finally culminating in the predictable big speech
where Steven outs himself in front of his parents and entire school.
