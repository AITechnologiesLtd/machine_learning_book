Reviewed by Dustin Putman, June 30, 2001.</P>
<P>A sophisticated, gritty drama that is notably more grown-up than most 
so-called "teen" flicks, "crazy/beautiful," directed by John Stockwell, has a 
lot going for it, not the least of being Kirsten Dunst (2001's "Get Over 
It"), who is one of the most gifted young actresses of her generation. With 
every role, Dunst fully embodies her characters with a zeal that is as 
charismatic as it is believable. And to prove what a chameleon she can be, 
Dunst has played everything from an ageless vampire (1994's "Interview with 
the Vampire"), to an alluring early-20th century debutante (2000's "Lover's 
Prayer"), to a suicidal teenager (2000's "The Virgin Suicides"), to an overly 
giddy cheerleader (2000's "Bring It On").</P>
<P>Dunst now stars as Nicole Oakley, a rebellious 17-year-old who is apt to go 
on both drinking and substance abuse binges. Nicole, whose father, Tom (Bruce 
Davison), is a California congressman, plays by her own rules, and doesn't 
care what other people think of her. It is this trait of fearlessness that 
attracts "A"-student Carlos (newcomer Jay Hernandez), who must travel two 
hours each morning to attend an exclusive, private co-ed high school, to her. 
They soon begin a whirlwind romance, despite their cultural, financial, and 
personality differences, which isolates them from close parties on both 
sides. When Tom, who has the power to get him into the naval academy he has 
always dreamed of going to, tells him to stay away from the troubled Nicole 
before she brings him down with her, Carlos must ultimately decide how 
important true love is when it means possibly sacrificing his future plans.</P>
<P>As written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, "crazy/beautiful" is a thoughtful, 
if minor, movie that is surrounded by good actors who make the most of their 
respective parts. Aside from Dunst's intimate, accurate portrayal of the 
problematic Nicole, Jay Hernandez amicably portrays Carlos as an intelligent 
young man with a bright future and an undeniable connection with Nicole. His 
is a face to definitely watch in the future. Also breaking the cliche of 
being a one-dimensional parent figure, Bruce Davison (2000's "X-Men") turns 
Tom Oakley into a conflicted man with a daughter whom he unconditionally 
loves, but doesn't know how to help. Lucinda Jenney (2000's "Remember the 
Titans"), on the other hand, is stuck playing Nicole's bitchy, whiny 
stepmother whose welcome wears thin real fast. Jenney offers no help in 
giving her any deeper character shades.</P>
<P>Where "crazy/beautiful" goes wrong is in its unmistakable similarities to 
1995's superior "Mad Love," in which good kid Chris O'Donnell fell for 
mentally ill wild child Drew Barrymore. Not only are full scenes and plot 
developments lifted directly from "Mad Love," but Dunst's spacious glass-clad 
home is even a dead ringer for Barrymore's, complete with a Mexican 
housekeeper. The likeness doesn't stop there; even the very ending is the 
same, with the movie concluding with a brief narration from Dunst that is 
just like Barrymore's. There is a difference between two films sharing a 
resemblance, and downright infringement. Whatever the case may be, the film 
lacks urgency and any original insight into its characters because it felt 
like it had been made just a few years before. </P>
<P>What must be applauded, however, is its treatment of Nicole, whose behavior 
bordering on alcoholism is accurate and palpable. It's a testament to 
director Stockwell's expertise that he is able to convey so much, while not 
once showing Nicole actually taking a drink. With such a hard-edged 
character, the cutting of material to get a PG-13 rating could have very well 
spelled disaster, but it ends up not affecting the outcome as much as 
expected.</P>
<P>I'd like to say that "crazy/beautiful" is a motion picture worth seeing, but 
it isn't. There is so much that is good it's almost a shame to have to 
chastise it for its cliched storyline. Unfortunately, it is that very problem 
that turns what could have been a sharp, intuitive look at teenage love into 
a movie that has "been there/done that" written all over it.</P>
