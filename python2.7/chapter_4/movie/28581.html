<P>PLOT:
A goofy scientist is about to come up with a formula that will get rid 
of all dog allergies around the world. All of the cats in the world 
aren't happy about this chain of events because they fear that this will 
make dogs even more popular with people, and diminish their power. So 
they come up with a plan to steal the formula from the scientist, invert 
its effects and make everyone in the world allergic to dogs. Woo-hoo!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Not as laugh-out-loud funny as SHREK, not as energetic as SPY KIDS, but 
certainly an all-around fun movie for kids. I say kids specifically, 
because the two films mentioned above also worked for me as someone over 
the age of 12, but this film was a little more kiddie-oriented. Not as 
many inside jokes or mature potshots in this one (other than one of the 
funnier lines in the film in which a pissed off dog exclaims "Son of my 
mom!" (i.e. Son of a bitch!)). Pretty funny, I thought. Overall though, 
the humor and the very basic Disney-esque plot of the film didn't engage 
me as much as I had hoped from the trailer. Having said that, holy 
special effects, Batman! I gotta give out some major props to the 
filmmakers here because the movie is shot impeccably and the effects 
work really well throughout. The dogs really look like they're talking, 
the cats really look like they're smiling and frowning and by God, they 
all really look like they're fighting, punching and pulling the wool 
over every human's eyes. Very, very well done in that respect. I also 
have to mention the great vision of the script, which has to do with 
cats working on a worldwide scale to end the "best friend" token tag of 
dogs, as well as the whole doggie underworld (which is literally 
under-ground) packed with futuristic mobiles, sophisticated 
communication systems, computers and a UN-type organization filled with 
dogs from all around the planet. Sounds pretty cool, eh?</P>
<P>Well, it's definitely cool and admittedly most of the action scenes were 
plenty slick as well. There are two particularly hi-larious characters 
in the film, both of whom spring from feline. One is the night-goggled 
ninja cats who break into a dog's home and kick all kinds of Matrix 
arse, and two, is a Russian pussy who they send in after the first round 
of kitties. A true "professional" hitman with a great accent and some 
real funny lines. The "live" characters on the other hand, Jeff Goldblum 
and Elizabeth Perkins, don't really need to do much in this film other 
than stand around and pretend not to know what's going on (and Goldblum 
acts "weird" as usual), while Alec Baldwin's voice as Butch, the lead 
dog, is impeccable and the dog even looks like him! (pretty neat) 
Overall, I certainly did enjoy myself with this picture, but it didn't 
really blow me away more than that. Most of the time I was just thinking 
to myself "oh, that's clever" as opposed to getting into the whole thing 
and laughing my head off. But like I said earlier, this movie is 
definitely more kid-oriented and even though everyone else is likely to 
enjoy it as well, I don't think that it's gonna strike as many chords 
across the board. BTW, seeing as one of the species comes out the 
"winner" in this film, need I predict a sequel entitled DOGS & CATS? 
Natch. Take the kids, they'll love it!</P>
