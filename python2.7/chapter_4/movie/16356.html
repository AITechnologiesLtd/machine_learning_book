<PRE>                                RUSHMORE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     When I asked Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson what would be next after
1996's BOTTLE ROCKET, they told me they were working on a number of
projects about "serious things."  I expressed skepticism then, and it
turns out it was justly founded.  RUSHMORE is anything but serious,
despite the Presidential-sounding name.</P>
<P>     So, what is Rushmore?  Rushmore is a prestigious private school in
Nowhere, U.S.A. (actually Houston and Dallas, Texas), where its most
vocal student, Max (Schwartzman), is also its worst academically. 
RUSHMORE the movie follows Max in his travails at school, where he falls
hopelessly in love with teacher Miss Cross (Williams, straight from THE
POSTMAN and a haircut).  Unwilling to accept that the age differential
is a concern, the 15-year old Max embarks on a grand scheme to build an
enormous aquarium as a symbol of affection.  That he builds it on the
school's baseball diamond is what gets him thrown out of Rushmore.</P>
<P>     Lest I forget myself in failing to mention Oscar-worthy Bill Murray
(with Billy Bob Thornton, one of the only two Best Supporting Actors
1998 had) as the wrench in Max's master plan.  Murray appears as one Mr.
Blume, a rich curmudgeon of an industrialist who at first funds Max's
plans, then tries to steal Miss Cross away for himself.</P>
<P>     Typing it out, it all sounds very conventional, but it's not.  Next
to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, RUSHMORE is one of only a handful of
solid, funny comedies of 1998.  And how funny it is!  Anderson and
Wilson's writing is spot-on yet surrealistic.  The dialogue is bizarre
and full of non-sequiturs, yet wildly entertaining.  The whole film
plays as a near fantasy, where the adults act like children, and the
children act like adults.  And no one's the wiser to the switch.</P>
<P>     RUSHMORE is a truly American film that deserves to be seen by many,
many people.  How many of those are going to "get it" remains a mystery.</P>
