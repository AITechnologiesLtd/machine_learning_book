<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Considering that casting director Ilene Starger rounded up a great cast 
including all of the names above, Dan Hedaya, and Richard Roundtree I really 
expected more from this movie. Shaft certainly kicks butt, but there are too 
many underdeveloped characters around him. The plot is very weak, twisting 
itself in all possible ways to attain more onscreen violence. Strong violence 
may have been a trademark of blaxploitation movies of the 1970s, but it 
doesn't need to be here. While most assaults are only worth mild cringes, 
Shaft works more as a modern action flick than a gritty ode to the original 
Shaft, Superfly, and all those Pam Grier movies. Too bad it takes the latter 
road.</P>
<P>John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) nephew of the original Shaft (Richard 
Roundtree in a cameo) is a police detective turned private eye. When a racist 
killing happens outside a night club, he's determined to bring the hateful 
perpetrator Walter Willaims (Christian Bale) to justice. Walter flees to 
Europe. Two years days later Shaft joins up with a narcotics team headed by 
Carmen (Vanessa L. Williams). Since the suspect has returned from a very long 
trip to Switzerland, the case gets resumed. Together the group searches for 
the scared witness who saw it all (Toni Collette). Peoples (Jeffrey Wright) 
is a drug dealer that will have an effect on everyone. He gets involved with 
two corrupt cops from the narcotics team. He also gets paid to kill the 
witness. The greed and betrayals that ensue ensure a machine gun happy good 
time.</P>
<P>With such a flimsy plot this movie relies almost entirely on Samuel L. 
Jackson's lead performance. Luckily, it is a very good one. At fifty-one, 
Jackson can still beat the bad guys with graceful ease. His ultra-cool 
persona gets perfectly completed with black leather everything and a blinding 
shining bald head. Shaft is one big bad "motherlover." One couldn't say that 
for the rest of the cast. While Busta Rhymes and Jeffrey Wright make 
impressions, there's no real reason Vanessa L. Williams needed to be in this 
at all. The same goes for Christian Bale whose performance was flat. Toni 
Collette, who was great in Muriel's Wedding and The Sixth Sense tries to make 
something out of her thankless role. Any scene without Shaft seems boring and 
stupid, but the scenes with him are marvelous. David Arnold's score along 
with the Shaft theme from Issac Hayes really heighten the experience. Getting 
louder at appropriate periods of action, it's the only consistently good 
thing here. The fast pace of events comes to a grinding halt a third of the 
way into the movie. Ninety-eight minutes isn’t too long, but the film seemed 
considerably longer than it was. To top it off there is virtually no sex in 
this remake. What happened to the private dick with all the chicks? The 
minuscule amount of sex that occurs involves Shaft uttering pickup lines 
like, "It's my duty to please that booty." Every line like this seems forced 
and uncomfortable from Jackson. </P>
<P>Usual action movie clichés are present. It’s pretty unlikely that of the at 
least two hundred bullets fired at Shaft and crew, not one hits its intended 
target. Our hero seems invincible. Perhaps shots of Shaft slowly walking down 
a dark alley with his long black leather coat fluttering in the wind are 
purposely reminiscent of Batman. Regardless, they definitely best portray the 
man’s image. If anything, this movie has a slam bang unexpected ending. One 
the audience and I didn’t see coming. If more gasps like this got worked into 
the plot structure, the movie would be much more enjoyable. A stronger script 
providing better chances for better acting would also have made this far 
superior. I couldn't help feeling cheated by Shaft. It wasn't nearly as fun 
as it could have been.</P>
