<P>Diane Weston (Marley Shelton) is the famed head chearleader of the "A" squad 
at Lincoln High School. Her best friends and co-cheerleaders are the 
tough-as-nails Kansas (Mena Suvari), the religious-nut Hannah (Rachel 
Blanchard), the Conan O'Brien-obsessed Cleo (Melissa Georgia), and the 
book-smart Lucy (Sara Marsh). From the second Diane literally knocks sweet 
football jock Jack Bartlett (James Marsden) down while doing backflips at a 
school pep rally, they falls instantly in love. Before long, Diane is 
pregnant, and realizing their love for each other, she and Jack decide to get 
married. With her at home with a bun in the oven, and Jack working 
minimum-wage at a video store, Diane forms a plan for her and the girls to 
learn from the mistakes of movie character thieves, so that they can 
successfully rob a bank and get the amount of cash each of them needs for the 
future.</P>
<P>This is the setup of "Sugar & Spice," a highly satirical jab at cheerleaders, 
bank robberies, and teenage pregnancy from director Francine McDougall and 
screenwriter Mandy Nelson. What begins as an inanely unfunny "stupid teen 
movie" eventually finds its footing at the 20-minute mark to become a 
surprisingly clever and knowing comedy that curiously pays tribute to many 
popular gangster/thief movies, including "Reservoir Dogs," "Heat," "Dog Day 
Afternoon," and "Point Break." The writing miraculously becomes fresh and 
appropriately zany, and the film runs at a fast pace, never growing outwardly 
tedious for a minute (save for the whole terrible opening section).</P>
<P>Moving at the trajectory it was remaining successfully on, "Sugar & Spice" 
might have been an early moviegoing surprise for 2001. Unfortunately, just as 
the film has gained maximum momentum, it ends abruptly in midstream, never 
wrapping up its characters or the story in any satisfying manner. At just 80 
minutes (including end credits), the picture feels rushed and rather 
pointless--a nice enough diversion, but one that fails to go that extra mile 
to become anything other than such.</P>
<P>The characters, in staying with the satire of the piece, which often reminds 
one of 1999's far superior "Election" and "Drop Dead Gorgeous," fit neatly 
into the package and are entertaining individuals, except for one problem: 
they are never developed outside of one or two personal traits. Because of 
this, their potentially bright, inspired performances are more or less 
wasted. Marley Shelton (1999's "The Bachelor") appears in almost every scene 
as the put-upon protagonist, Diane, but she remains at arm's length with the 
viewer, never being allowed to break out from a broad caricature. The same 
goes for the rest of the girls, with rising star Mena Suvari (1999's 
"American Beauty") sorely wasted as the edgy Kansas. Marla Sokoloff (2000's 
"Whatever It Takes") does offer up some fun, however, as the spiteful Lisa, a 
member of the "B" squad cheerleading team who dispises the "A" squad and, 
coincidentally, witnesses the bank robbery and recognizes the girls (despite 
being equipped with Betty doll masks). Meanwhile, James Marsden (2000's 
"X-Men") has nothing to do but look and act like a lovable, if immature, 
doofus.</P>
<P>For the majority of its too-brief running time, "Sugar & Spice" runs so close 
to the line of delightfully savage lampooning that it is all the more 
disappointing when the movie never follows through with its ambitious nature. 
Writer Mandy Nelson surely knows how to write smart-allecky, at time even 
ingenious, dialogue, but she has failed in exposing any sort of emotional 
truths about its characters or the situations. Since that is the key to a 
good satire--playfully mocking people and valid societal issues while 
offering up a bit of ironic realism--"Sugar & Spice" ultimately misses the 
boat by a millimeter. </P>
