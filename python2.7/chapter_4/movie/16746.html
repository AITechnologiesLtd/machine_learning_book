<P>Stanley Kubrick began the art of dehumanization in film early in his
career.  One of his earliest and least well known films is 'Paths of
Glory'.  At a running time of only 88 minutes, the film is a perfect
example of what film is supposed to do:  Get to the point and get off
it.  I don't think I've seen a more sweeping film about war with such a
short and most appropriate running time.  War films often repeat
themselves by showing the injustice of its subject matter as men die in
senseless battles.  Lives are lost at the hands of a court in Kubrick's
most alternative film about conflict.</P>
<P>The blind insanity of war can be summed up in 'Paths of Glory' by one
statement made by Kirk Douglas: "Patriotism is the last refuge of a
scoundrel."  Now, I don't agree entirely with that statement --- and
that quote, I'm sure, is not meant to be taken to the extreme.
Patriotism is a wonderful thing but like religion, politics and anything
else in life, it's best taken in moderation.</P>
<P>The result of extreme patriotism leads to the execution of three
innocent men in the French army in 1916 during World War I.  A fanatical
French general named Mireau (George Macready), orders his lower level
officers to engage his men in a suicide mission during an attack in
battle, and when the mission fails because of the refusal of committing
men to a certain death, one man from each of the three divisions is
selected almost at random and are made scapegoats for the failed attack
and are subsequently tried for cowardice which carries the penalty of
death.</P>
<P>Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) acts as counsel for the men.  Dax is the
example of an officer who strives for a fair trial on behalf of the
men.  On the day the trial is announced IT IS CARRIED OUT THAT DAY!
There are no formal stenographic notes kept, the trial is biased in
favour of the prosecution and the audience will quickly recognizes it as
a kangaroo court.  It is one of the greatest injustices in the history
of war.  Perhaps, dare I say, more of an injustice than dying on the
battlefield.</P>
<P>The three men to be executed are portrayed by Joseph Turkel, Timothy
Carey and Ralph Meeker.  Each one is a well developed character and
while it would have been easy to make them caricatures, their roles are
well thought out and are portrayed just as impressively as any other
character in the film.  Kubrick adapted the screenplay based on the book
by Humphrey Cobb.  As he does in many of his films, Kubrick strains the
human condition in a most unsentimental way and his films have never
been tame and this film shows no mercy for any of its stark subject
matter allegedly based on a true story which was made public a few years
after the war ended.</P>
<P>Kubrick uses his camera the way he does in all his films.  He plunges
them into our souls with characters who rarely crack a smile and with
dark and haunting shadows accompanying them. Adolphe Menjou portrays
General Broulard in this, one of his last films, and is sort of on the
fence in how his character will be judged by future film historians.
His character is perhaps one of the most debatable in the film as to
where his loyalties stand.</P>
<P>As Kubrick's films about war evolved throughout film history from 'Paths
of Glory' to 'Dr. Strangelove' to 'Full Metal Jacket', the man with the
vision of film serving as a tool to judge society well ahead of its
time, Kubrick has managed to find tragedy, excitement, humour and traces
of sarcasm which will cause selected audiences to mock what they don't
understand.</P>
