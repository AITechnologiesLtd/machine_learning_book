ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Larry Clark</PRE>
<P>Writers: Christopher B. Landon and Stephen Chin (based on the novel by 
Eddie Little)</P>
<P>Starring: James Woods, Melanie Griffith, Vincent Kartheiser, Natasha 
Gregson Wagner, James Otis, Paul Hipp, Brent Briscoe, Lou Diamond 
Phillips</P>
<P>"Another Day in Paradise" is without a doubt a major improvement over 
Larry Clark's previous film, "Kids." But, then again, most anything 
could be an improvement over that annoyingly condescending and naive 
"message movie." One thing that did strike me as great about both of 
these films, though, and maybe the one major assett Clark has as a 
filmmaker, is his photography. It's gritty and painfully realistic. 
"Kids," for all the crap that it was, was at least well-shot, and it'd 
be easy that, if you didn't recognize some of the actors in later films 
(like Chloe Seveigny - the other major redeeming thing about that movie, 
by the way) or are stupid enough to think that a filmmaker could 
actually capture kids like this via cinema verite, you'd think it is 
actually cinema verite after all.</P>
<P>The opening shot of "Another Day in Paradise" is especially nice. It's 
grainy with low-lighting and a lack of edits that is refreshing from a 
lot of film, and it has a non-judgmental and observant serenity that was 
lacking sorely from that other movie (as it shall henceforth be named, 
at least in the confines of this review). The fact that it's just of one 
of our main characters getting up out of bed is nicer. And with a 
wonderful soul song playing on the soundtrack, this film was off to a 
good start for me. No pretentious message-making. Hopefully no silly 
excuse for a plot. Just looking at these people and allowing them to 
live, for Christ's sake. Even when this character, a guy in his late 
teens named Bobby (Vincent Kartheiser), put his clothes on, hid a knife 
in his pants, and robbed a couple vending machines, only to be attacked 
by a guard, Clark thankfully doesn't become judgemental.</P>
<P>The fight between he and the guard has a marvelous immediacy, with 
sloppy camera movements, and idiosyncratic touches by the characters. 
The guard wails on him real good, causing blood to pour from his mouth 
and all over, but Bobby manages to stick his knife in him, disabling 
him, and trying to run away with broken bones, desperately trying to 
hold onto the bag filled with quarters. The opening of that other movie, 
though is like this: the lead guy convinces a girl to sleep with him, 
but it has such a forced, staged, and worst of all, condescending feel 
that it's disengaging. There, Clark was trying to force something down 
the audience's throat, trying to stir waves instead of being true to his 
characters. Here, it's as if he learned something. We know what Bobby's 
doing is wrong, but it's not played out that way. This is, after all, 
how Bobby survives in life.</P>
<P>So far, so good, right? With or without the ridiculously condescending 
title (Funny. It wouldn't be like that for any other director, would 
it?), I was expecting a film that was as good as these opening moments. 
But soon a plot is introduced, and the potentiality of expanding on the 
characters and deepening them is abandoned for a hackney plot about 
low-level thieving, that, I think, is supposed to be a testament to how 
parents' behavior passes on to their children. A couple more characters 
are introduced: Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner), Bobby's coke-snorting 
girlfriend; and Uncle Mel (James Woods), a middle-aged thief/drug addict 
who at first heals Bobby's wounds, then takes him under his wing for a 
series of planned low-level robberies and drug deals. Bobby quickly 
agrees, and they all hop into a car with Mel's long-time girlfriend, Sid 
(Melanie Griffith). They party a bit. Then they rob a drug store, 
planning to sell the dope to others. Things go awry. As soon as they 
feel like a close-knit family, they all fall apart. Ho hum. Clark's 
opening of weird realism is instead traded in for a cliche-ridden plot, 
and characters who are either one-dimensional or never even bothered 
with.</P>
<P>For instance, the relationship between Mel and Sid is somewhat 
interesting, with a boring beginning and later hints of a pot boiling 
over, but there's very little interest in the relationship of Bobby and 
Rosie. In fact, only one scene between them is at all very good, and 
that's their final one, a scene that seems so improvisational that it's 
like one huge breath of air. Everything is pretty much saved for the 
end, with Sid finally gaining some complexity, as minute as it is, but 
with Bobby switching from admiration for Mel to contempt. But none of 
this feels real, at least not as real as Clark is capable of showing. 
His direction is right, full of daring realism, but the screenplay 
nearly ignores the human element, and it plays like a freakish 
collaboration between neo-realism and cliched robbers story, like Elmore 
Leonard without the wit or insight. Even Clark makes a few mistakes: a 
would-be harrowing shootout in a motel (featuring Brent Briscoe, who's 
all about shootouts this year, what with "A Simple Plan") feels fake and 
totally un-Clark-like (I can't believe he included such an 
audience-pleasing shot of Griffith with a shotgun underneath a bed, 
leveling an assailant a la Albert Finney in "Miller's Crossing").</P>
<P>The soul soundtrack is a nice touch, though: it's like it's filling in 
the emotions of the characters, and the pain that they are afraid to 
show (would work better if the characters were more complex to begin 
with). Only in one instance does the music feel wrong: in a later scene 
of such emotional intensity, what is best needed is just the sounds of 
human pain and the ambiance of the room. No sad music. Just crying and 
despearate pleading. And it's especially sad because it could have been 
the one scene that really deepens the character and shows his true 
emotions (the fact that it's ruined by something that is so often one of 
the best aspects of the movie is ironic, eh?).</P>
<P>The acting, for the most part, is mediocre, especially Kartheiser as the 
one-note Bobby, who's only endearing in one section of the film, and 
Wagner, who once again, is annoying enough to show that she's no Natalie 
Wood. Or even a Robert Wagner, for that matter. Griffith, though, is 
actually good. Every now and then the woman pulls off a performance 
which shows off the good aspects of her talent (remember, we all liked 
her in "Working Girl," didn't we?), and maybe with at least acceptable 
turns in "Celebrity" and "Lolita," she may have a great performance in 
her. And Lou Diamond Philips has a funny, uncredited role as a 
flamboyantly gay criminal mastermind.</P>
<P>But if anyone makes this movie even somewhat good, it's James Woods, who 
infuses the film with so much energy and vitality that he almost 
single-handedly makes it work by sheer force of will. Although hampered 
with several ridiculously cliched lines, he manages to make them as 
unpainful to listen to as possible, and brings depth to his character 
that the screenplay doesn't manage to add. Beaten down by life but 
furiously trying to find the holy grail of criminals, the last big 
score, he's the symbol of down by law tragedy. Even his more 
over-the-top moments seem genuine. Brilliant guy, that Woods. There were 
other things I admired, as well. I liked some of the more strange and 
quirky foibles and moments it had, like how Rosie does coke because 
she's afraid of needles; how the gun dealer was a seriously good 
Christian, who preached the word of god as he sold his weapons; and the 
excitement with which Woods enters every single heist that you just know 
he'll never make it big. It's the criminal tragedy...almost.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **1/2</PRE>
