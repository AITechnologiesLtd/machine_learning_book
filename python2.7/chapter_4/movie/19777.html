<PRE>                        THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In 1994 three amateur filmmakers went
          into the Maryland woods making a documentary about
          the local legend of the Blair Witch.  They never
          returned. This is claimed to be a compilation of
          the footage they took showing how they were lost
          and ran afoul of something unseen. This is a film
          that demonstrates that horror in a film need not be
          created by visual effects.  Instead the immediacy
          created by hand-held cameras and a realistic rather
          than artificial style makes this the most intense
          horror film since HENRY, PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL
          KILLER.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4).
          Following the review is a non-spoiler sidebar
          listing the rules of the European film movement
          Dogma 95.</PRE>
<P>     There is a paradox in filmmaking.  The viewer goes to a film to
see an experience, but ironically not really to share the experience.
We as viewers want to see the story, but we do not really want to
participate in the experience.  The filmmakers we consider to be the
best do not make realistic films.  These great stylists of cinema are
mostly people that rather than making a film real for us make it
unreal.  The most real film is crude footage right out of a hand-held
camera.  Even using Steadicam is stepping away from reality. As we look
at he world our head bobs and jerks.  Steadicam smoothes out the bobs
and jerks making the resulting film less real.  A rare few films use
crudity and a lack of style to make the film more real for the viewer.
THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is an effective horror film, not because a
great stylist polished it but because it looks like it is not polished
at all.  It is shot in black and white and photographed crudely.  It
does have music, but it is the music that the filmmakers could get free
and the music is rough.  Color and a lush orchestral score are a
distraction.</P>
<P>     As I write this review there are two horror film in wide release.
The remake of THE HAUNTING is a highly glossy film with great special
effects and images from the imagination of an artist.  THE BLAIR WITCH
PROJECT on the other hand is shot primitively with hand-held cameras
and has almost no music.  And that lack of style makes the film seem
all the more real.  By showing almost nothing of the menace in the
story it allows the viewer's mind complete freedom to imagine the
threat.  In fact THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT--perhaps coincidentally--very
nearly follows the rules of Dogma 95.  THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was made
on a very tiny film budget, and it is made with almost no stylistic
tricks.  In fact it has no style whatsoever to distance the viewer from
the action.  That makes it the most effective horror film we have seen
in years.</P>
<P>     The plot of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is obvious from the first
minutes of the film.  We are told at the very beginning of the film
that in October 1994 three student filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams, and Joshua Leonard (played by Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams, and Joshua Leonard) were making a film.  They went into the
Maryland woods near Burkittesville to shoot a documentary about a local
legend, the Blair Witch.  They never came out of that woods and we are
told a year later their film footage was found.  We don't even know how
it is supposed to have been unearthed.  But we are seeing the raw film
footage they shot.  It is clear from the beginning that they were
incompetents and should not be out in the wild by themselves.  It is
not hard to guess what trouble they found in the woods and what caused
them not to come back.  The film spends the rest of its short 85-minute
length showing the viewer what was expected to happen did happen.  This
is not a great plot.  It is almost no plot at all, in fact.  The viewer
knows what is going to ensue and just sits there to see it happen and
to pick up the details.  Yet just seeing it all happen without having
the filmmaker interpose style between the viewer and the story makes
this film an experience so immediate and intense that people are
walking out of the film rather than subjecting their nerves to the
film.  The special effects in this film are all mostly sound effects.
They are all easy to create, but they tap into a basic fear of being
vulnerable in the woods, in the night, in the dark (to paraphrase both
versions of THE HAUNTING).  This is a film that will tap into some very
basic fears.</P>
<P>     The film is written, directed, and edited by Daniel Myrick and
Eduardo Sanchez. It is a Haxen Films production (probably named for the
classic 1922 Norwegian film documentary HAXEN, meaning "Witches").  The
three main characters apparently play themselves.  According to the
publicity most of the dialog is improvised, giving it a real immediacy.
Apparently they were given a rough plot outline and identifying with
the characters they argued among themselves in a sort of role-playing
game.  I would bet that the scenes were filmed in very much the order
that we see them in the film to make easier the slow build in the
actors' hysteria.  The reported cost of shooting the film was $20,000,
but the film is playing to full houses.  It is the kind of trick that
probably can be done effectively only once, though THE BLAIR WITCH
PROJECT is bound to have imitators.  This is a film of incredible
intensity.  It has no sex, no violence, a fair amount of medium-strong
language, but less than a lot of other films in theaters.  Yet it is
too strong for even some of the adults seeing the film.  I rate it an8
on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.  In case
there is any confusion the film THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the television
documentary "The Curse of the Blair Witch," and any legends or
historical factoids found in either are complete fictions created for
the film.  A possible exception is the television description of the
backgrounds of the three film students who were real people and played
themselves in the film.  There never was a Blair Witch or an attempt to
do a serious documentary about her.</P>
<P>     Dogma 95 is a European film movement founded by Danish filmmaker
Lars von Triers.  It is intended to bring film back to a more natural
sort of filmmaking. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT follows, as far as I can
tell, the first seven of the rules and breaks the last three.  However,
its compliance with so many of the rules of Dogma 95 may be purely
coincidental.  The following are the rule of Dogma 95.</P>
<P>     I swear to submit to the following set of rules drawn up and
confirmed by DOGMA 95:</P>
<P>     1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be
brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location
must be chosen where this prop is to be found).</P>
<P>     2. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice
versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is
being shot).</P>
<P>     3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility
attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must not take place
where the camera is standing; shooting must take place where the film
takes place).</P>
<P>     4. The film must be in color. Special lighting is not acceptable.
(If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a
single lamp be attached to the camera).</P>
<PRE>     5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.</PRE>
<P>     6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders,
weapons, etc. must not occur.)</P>
<P>     7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to
say that the film takes place here and now.)</P>
<PRE>     8. Genre movies are not acceptable.</PRE>
<PRE>     9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.</PRE>
<PRE>     10. The director must not be credited.</PRE>
