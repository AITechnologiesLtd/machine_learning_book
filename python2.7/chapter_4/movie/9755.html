A Review
By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>     I saw the first trailer for this film about a year ago.  I looked
forward to the film back then, the movie kept getting pushed back and back
and back, and finally in June, they say "Coming in November."  Hmmm.  I
decided to read the book instead.  Despite the fact that, in the past,
the movie is *never* as good as the book, I figured, hey, this will be a
good movie.  I was half right.
     The film concerns the adventures of a trio of high school students
who enter public service in order to become full citizens in the the
Federation that governs Earth.  (In the book we learn that you cannot vote
unless you enter public service).  Public Service is synonymous with
Military service.  One of them (played by Doogie Howser's Neil Patrick
Harris) has phychic abilities and is sent to the Military Itelligence
division (where they become officers immediately).  Johnny Rico (played by
a unknown set of cheekbones) doesn't test very highly, but is rather
athletic, he ends up in the Mobile Infantry. his girlfriend Carmen
(played by an unknown, overly nubile set of cheekbones) and a math-whiz,
enters the flight academy.  They all three take separate paths, which
right away suggests that they will all come together in the climax.
     In between we have Rico's and Carmen's training, which contains the
first ever dear john minidisc in film history.  In the novel, we learn
that the mobile Infantry is the most prestigious form of Public Service,
it is highly regarded by the public, and those who have survived their
term in the MI are revered...this does not come out in the film, much to
my dismay.  It's an element that would have explained a lot that didn't
really make sense.  During his training, Rico quits, but is persuaded to
stay on when the bugs send an asteroid which impacts Buenos Aires, the
kids hometown, wiping it out completely. 
      Carman on the other hand, is wild and wacky and excells at her pilot
training, she ends up getting paired with Xander, another set of amazing
cheeckbones, who is slowly stealing her heart away from Johnny.  She
graduates early and is assigned to the Roger Young, a transport ship,
which delivers the MI to their destinations and retrieves them. 
     Joining Johnny in the MI, and slowly turning his eyes away from
Carmen, is the athletic Dizzy Flores (played by a well-muscled set of
cheekbones who is not afraid to do gratutious shower scenes), another alum
of the BA school, she has always had a thing for Rico, but he's always
shunned her for Carmen...this tit-for-tat love triangle...not, not
triangle, love Rhombus, continues through most of the film. 
     Finally, after 55 minutes...we get bugs...bugs and bugs.  The Earth
forces assume that the bugs are not intelligent, and this is their
undoing, they have some rather unsettling military defeats, and are forced
to do a bit of rethinking before taking the war to the bugs.
     The special effects are pretty darned good, there really wasn't a
time I stopped and went "that was cheesy." which usually happens during
sci-fi films when I spot a flaw.  The bugs were creepy and horrid and
brutal all at the same time, and more than fulfilled any visions I'd had
while reading the books.  The space scenes are well-done as well, somewhat
reminiscent of Babylon 5's style, but looked less computer generated.  The
bugs were overseen by Phil Tippet, who made his mark with the Star Wars
Trilogy.  
     The action in the last half of the movie is a bit fractured, there
isn't really smooth continuity, just a lot of shooting and slurping and
blood and guts, but for some reason I liked it.  A lot of the action
scenes were done rather well, and I wish I'd looked up to see who the
second unit director was, there was some creative stuff done with what
could have been a very redundant set of battle scenes.
     If I hadn't read the book, I would have really liked this film.  I
think that Paul Verhoven is one of the last directors I would have chosen
for Starship Troopers.  In an interview with him and the producer, they
said that the book was about a "facist utopia."  The same thing was said
by critics when the original novel came out in the 60's.  Because Verhoven
was attacking the flim from that slant, many of the details of the society
got smoothed over and ignored, in order to highlight the things he saw in
the story as "facist."  Furthermore, the first half of the film, which
represents about the first two-thirds of the book, is smothered in the
tedious love-triangle, that just about every reviwer calls "a bad episode
of 90210."  A better choice for a director of this film would have been
Terry Gilliam, or Ridley Scott (maybe too obvious).  Verhoven has too many
odd obsessions, one with horrid, horrid violence, and the other with naked
bodies (see Basic Instinct, Robocop, Showgirls, Total Recall), most of his
films are distinguished by their over the top sex or violence.  I believe
Total Recall has the dubious disinction of the most people killed in a
film, Robocop was originally an X-rated film for violence.  He's out to
shock or something, and seems unphazed at his movie ratings.  
     Starship Troopers, however, is probably going to be popular, for the
very reasons that I have disliked it, especially all the yong nubile
actors and their relationships, which play like a 90210 episode on at 2am
on Showtime.  The same factors that made a movie like Scream a hit...young 
beautiful actors and actresses, love-triangles, shower scenes...some
humour...  
     I probably should not see this film again, because I will find more
and more wrong with it, that's what happened with me and Independence Day,
the first time is was GREAT! The second time is was..oh...good, yeah...and
it was downhill from there...but I digress.</P>
<P>Out of the $3.50 I paid for my ticket, it was probably worth $1.75</P>
