<PRE>SPECIES (1995)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **** (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Written by Dennis Feldman.
Directed by Roger Donaldson.
Starring Natasha Henstridge, Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen.
Rated R (contains nudity, violence, and profanity)  108 mins.</P>
<P>Synopsis:  An alien/human hybrid escapes a top-secret government research
installation, transforms into a sexy blonde, travels to L.A., shops for a
wedding dress, and searches for the perfect man to copulate with.  In the
meantime, an anal-retentive scientist assembles a team, including a
dim-witted assassin with a cat and an empath with a penchant for the
obvious, to track her down.</P>
<P>Comments:  With the recent release of SPECIES in a deluxe widescreen
edition on video (labeled a "Contemporary Classic" by MGM) and SPECIES II
currently in production for this summer, now seemed like a good enough time
as any to write a retrospective on this movie.  If one were to critique
SPECIES as an everyday, run-of-the-mill theatrical release, he would have
to conclude that it was a genuine turkey.  On the other hand, if viewed in
the humorous "just-for-fun" way that it should be, SPECIES turns into one
of the best bad science-fiction movies of the decade.  Complete with a
ludicrous plot, laughable characters, ridiculous dialogue, and
not-so-special effects, this film proves entertaining from start to finish.</P>
<P>The cast of SPECIES makes a suitable topic to begin with.  Yes, the
scientist in charge of the project which creates the human/alien hybrid is
none other than the well-respected actor Ben Kingsley.  The man who won an
Academy Award for his portrayal of GHANDI, the man who played superbly in
Spielberg's epic SCHINDLER'S LIST, is reduced, by the end of this film, to
shouting obscenities in a sewer while armed with a flamethrower.  How the
mighty have fallen!  As humorously miscast as Kingsley is, more laughs are
provided by Michael Madsen and Forest Whitaker.  The former plays an
assassin who spouts inane one-liners and constantly looks like he's in need
of Pepto Bismol while the latter stars as a psychic (oh, excuse me, he's an
empath -- whatever) whose insights are highly obvious to anyone with a
brain cell.  SPECIES also marks the debut of Natasha Henstridge, a very
attractive young model-turned-actress.  Though she plays the creature
christened "Sil" (the title character of this movie), she's basically
reduced to stripping naked in every other scene she's in.  This is far from
being a bad thing, of course, but it still seems a rather over-the-top way
to enter the movie industry.  (Unfortunately, SPECIES, to date, is
Henstridge's best film; her other two -- the okay MAXIMUM RISK and the
awful ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH -- are forgetable.  Note to film producers:
give this lady a real chance!)</P>
<P>The plot of SPECIES sounds, and is, bewilderingly dumb.  This alien/human
hybrid grows at an accelerated rate until she's at her beautiful
21-year-old stage, then her aging abruptly halts.  (I guess SPECIES
wouldn't be as cool if Henstridge's character aged to death halfway through
the movie.)  In order to enjoy it, one must leave his intelligence at the
door; the story is full of holes.  Dennis Feldman's script is also full of
some of the worst lines in recent movie history.  It's fun to listen to the
silly dialogue which goes on between the characters of this film.  Perhaps
the best example occurs near the beginning: the team inspects a train
compartment which Sil has recently vacated.  A dead woman lies in a pool of
blood.  Alien gore drips from the walls.  The compartment is in complete
disarray.  Whitaker's psychic (sorry, *empath*), while studying the mess,
receives one of his "insights" which leads him to brilliantly note that
"something bad happened here."</P>
<P>One would expect spectacular special effects from a big-budgeted sci-fi
film from a major movie studio like MGM.  Expectations, perhaps, should be
even higher for SPECIES as it features the talents of H.R. Giger (the
bizarre artist who created the creature in ALIEN, a true science-fiction
classic) and Richard Edlund (the winner of 4 Academy Awards for his work on
the STAR WARS trilogy and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK).  Despite these talents
behind the camera, however, SPECIES has an undeniably cheesy feel
throughout the film.  Yes, most of the special effects are, at least,
adequate for the film (though hardly "special").  The finale, on the other
hand, looks absurd.  An obviously computer-generated creature who seems to
have stepped out of a second-rate video game menaces the characters in a
setting that is completely unreal.  It's rather funny.</P>
<P>SPECIES receives four stars and not a perfect five due to the fact that it
loses some of its energy right before its laughable finale.  Unlike the
rest of the film, which is fun to watch, this segment resorts to cliches
that have been done time after time before.  The team hunting Sil tracks
her through a sewer system.  Armed with flamethrowers and flashlights, they
shuffle around in the gloom to find her.  Dark tunnels.  Dripping water.  A
creature ready to spring out of the darkness at any moment.  Been there,
done that.  The worst part about this segment is that it is the only
segment which tries to be serious.  Perhaps that is why it seems out of
place and makes the film drag for a while.</P>
<P>Irregardless of the last criticism, SPECIES is one of the best turkeys ever
made.  Considering the various talented people who embarass themselves
through their involvement in the film's production, considering the bad
dialogue, questionable acting, and ludicrous story, SPECIES is a definate
winner.  It's a near-perfect movie for those in the mood to see an "it's so
bad that it's good" type of film.</P>
