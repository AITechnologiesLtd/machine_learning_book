<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        The Mask of Zorro is a decent action picture, with an adequate script
and good acting.  The story is straightforward and cohesive, and the
characters are reasonably well-defined.  It's also a film that, aside
from the obvious effort that the performers have put into it, could have
been made by a machine on an action film assembly line.  Sometimes it's
thrilling, sometimes it's not, but it's always the same old action film
stuff -- simple entertainment and instantly forgettable.  Mix in some
irritating cliches common in Hollywood period pieces, and we have
another big, loud blockbuster that you'll stop thinking about thirty
seconds after the credits roll.</P>
<P>        Is that what you want?  I mean, is that what people in general want?  I
suppose that's possible; Armageddon, by comparison, is a film that
aspires to be about as much as this one does, but I found the asteroid
flick a lot more exciting and much more satisfying in the end.  Maybe
it's because this subject matter is so common (the film feels almost
exactly the same as The Man in the Iron Mask, and has many of the same
problems).  Maybe it's because I've already seen entire cities explode
this summer, and so seeing a mine blow up just isn't all that
thrilling.  Maybe it's because, once again, I've walked away from a
movie getting exactly what I expected to get.  Here's an official dare
to all mainstream directors -- try surprising me for a change!  </P>
<P>        I have no particular affinity towards the legends of the legendary
Zorro, but the story here seems like a nice one to continue the tale. 
It begins with Zorro himself as a middle-aged man, played by Anthony
Hopkins.  His real name is Don Diego, and his nemesis is Don Rafael
Montero (Stuart Wilson).  Montero loves Diego's wife, but, in a fatal
engagement, his guards kill her.  Montero has Diego imprisoned, and
takes Diego's young daughter to raise her himself.</P>
<P>        Twenty years pass, and focus is shifted to a young bandit, Alejandro
(Antonio Banderas) and his brother.  When his brother is killed by a
wicked general (Matt Letscher), Alejandro vows to take revenge.  That's
when he meets Diego, who has just escaped from prison.  It turns out
that the two knew each other when Alejandro was a child, and so Diego
decides to teach the young man how to fight.  The two men then help one
another to put their demons to rest, but not without the aide of a long
series of semi-interesting action sequences.</P>
<P>        The Mask of Zorro is not a dull picture.  Director Martin Campbell
(Goldeneye) seems to have a knack for observing characters who swiftly
overcome twenty-to-one odds and then smirk at their adversaries.  Some
of the sequences here are very well-staged -- I liked the scene that has
Zorro on the backs of multiple horses, as he overtakes a group of guards
from behind.  The final sequence is also well-done, and features a lot
of people falling from high places.  On a technical level, there's a lot
to admire here, such as the authentic sword battles and the impressive
sets.</P>
<P>        But very little of it had me gaping with amazement or shaking with
excitement.  The music and cinematography are both very routine, and
films like this are where film makers should go over-the-top with style
(as Michael Bay did in Armageddon).  Yes, it's fast-paced, and there are
enough explosions to hold the focus of even the most hopeless victims of
ADD.   I found the film pleasing to look at, but the only moments that
will be etched in my mind are the ones I saw twenty times in the
previews.  In addition, the script is not very witty, and lacks a
substantial amount of humor; the few laughs present are supplied by the
performers.</P>
<P>        Ironically, what I liked most about the picture is the acting and the
characters.  While the characters aren't strong, they are at least
consistent, and the exceptional cast is impressive.  Banderas is always
charming, and he's charming here, and wrings what humor he can out of
the script.  Hopkins forces us to care about his character; there's one
extremely touching scene that almost changed my entire view of the
film.  This scene also includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays the
young lady to whom Montero has been lying for twenty years -- she is the
true daughter of Zorro.  Zeta-Jones is luminous and spunky in the role,
and holds up well against the pros.  Wilson is terrific, giving the
villain a little bit of depth, while Letscher has fun giving his villain
no positive attributes whatsoever.</P>
<P>        As a period piece, the film feels sloppy.  While Hopkins and Wilson are
both good, neither of them manage a Spanish accent, and therefore the
film never sounds authentic (even Banderas seems to be covering up his
natural inflection).  The dialogue is adequate, and while it never reeks
of anachronisms, there isn't a single line of memorable dialogue in the
film.  When all is considered, The Mask of Zorro is just another summer
blockbuster -- technically adequate but utterly methodical.  It's nice
to see a loud movie that isn't stupid, but this film just doesn't have
much of a personality.  </P>
