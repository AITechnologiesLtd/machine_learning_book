<P>   Like others of my generation, I was born too early.  Sure,
we had games just like everyone since the Flintstones.  We
played stick ball in the street, bounced spaldeens for punch
ball in the back yard, and pushed and shoved those pinball
machines, avoiding "tilt" as much as we could.  Nowadays
we're not too old to fool around with a joystick, virtually
wiping out terrorists or solving the intricate mysteries of Myst. 
But darn it, I don't think we'll be around long enough to
create whole new worlds of people who look and talk like us
and stab and shoot one another in much the same way we
do now.   But at least we can enjoy those pleasures
vicariously on the big screen for under ten bucks a pop.  One
such diversion that's come our way is "The Thirteenth Floor,"
which will keep everyone over the age of 30 guessing while
bringing patronizing grins to the faces of the more youthful
constituency. I think that even H.G. Wells would have a
difficult time guessing just what the heck is going on as the
strikingly handsome Douglas Hall transports himself from
present-day Los Angeles back to 1937 to discover that he's
just as cute then, albeit with a mustache, but that during the
Depression, the only color that city planners could afford for
the streets was sepia.</P>
<P>   Don't forget to wear some extra padding in your briefs.  By
the time the story ends and we get the big aha(!) of the
concise epilogue, you'll kick yourself hard for not perceiving
the game plan all along--if you're over 30, that is.</P>
<P>   This is quite an intriguing movie, surely more layered and
convincing than David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ" and for my
money more absorbing than "Matrix."  Inspired by (rather
than adapted from) Daniel Galouye's sci-fi book "Simulacron
3," "The Thirteenth Floor"--scripted by its director, Josef
Rusnak, and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez--opens with the
Cartesian quote, "I think, therefore I am," which considering
what follows is somewhat pretentious but at least is not
written in Latin.  We're thrust into the L.A. of Depression
times quicker than you can say "Eddie Murphy," as an elderly
gentleman whom you'd call dignified had he not shown his
proclivity toward young women thrusts a letter into the hands
of a night-club bartender.  You wonder why a fellow who is
allegedly the head of an envelope-pushing corporation would
trust a bleached-blond barkeep with this portentous epistle,
but that's just one of the story's jostles against our credibility. 
We learn that Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) has big
plans for the man he has chosen to succeed him as
corporate honcho, Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko), but the mail-
robbing mixologist Ashton (Vincent D'Onofrio) has other
schemes in mind.  Fuller then makes his second mistake: he
propels himself into the L.A. of 1999 where, predictably
enough, he is stabbed to death, arousing the interest of
LAPD Detective Larry Mc Bain (Dennis Haysbert).  The noir-
like cop suspects Hall, who is heir to the corporate fortune,
but before he can arrest the legatee, Hall falls instantly in
love (as anyone would) with Fuller's daughter Jane (Gretchen
Mol).  With the police suspicious of Hall, the comely hero
begins to think that he did indeed commit the murder but
wiped the memory from his mind.  To get to the bottom of
this, he zaps back to '37 with the assistance of computer
geek Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio again).  Hall becomes more
deeply enmeshed in the whole affair, involving himself in
violence with bartender Ashton and a liaison (which he
prefers) with the lovely Jane.</P>
<P>  Sci-fi fans in the audience cannot be faulted if they compare
and contrast "The Thirteenth Floor" with others of the genre
having similar plots.  Roland Emmerich's "Stargate" comes
first to my mind, the tale of a scholar of ancient languages
and hieroglyphics recruited to decipher the mystery of a stone
gateway, which actually leads to another universe.  Like
"Stargate," "The Thirteenth Floor" is an involving odyssey
with a few fascinating cyber effects, especially the involved
pattern of interconnecting bars that our time traveler runs into
out in the Arizona desert. And like "Stargate," this one
sometimes loses its dramatic projection amid a plethora of
visuals.  Craig Bierko--who, according to the buzz of women
around me stands to become the next cover guy on the celeb
magazines--is a more interesting performer than Kurt Russell,
more the guy with the dimensions of "Stargate"'s James
Spader.  His expressions are riveting as he turns from
obsessively curious computer scientist to vulnerable do-
gooder to bemused object of a gorgeous woman's affection.
Though he is not yet a household name, movie buffs may
remember his role with Geena Davis in Renny Harlin's "The
Long Kiss Goodbye" and in the underrated Larry David
comedy "Sour Grapes."  Vincent D'Onofrio, one of my
favorites, can do no wrong, not even here where he's given
makeup that might have been inspired by Bruce Willis's artist
in "The Jackal."  Armin Mueller-Stahl, one of the world's
greats, is above criticism.  The 69-year-old leading man of
German stage and screen who turned in a memorable
performance in Costa-Gavras's "Music Box" ten years ago
and as the domineering father of David Helfgott in "Shine"
comes across this time as a plausible scientist eager as a
puppy to have fun with his invention during his later years. 
Gretchen Mol is given little opportunity, however, to strut her
stuff, here playing a vapid temptress with stilted romantic
dialogue, as she discusses her experience with love at first
sight and in an alternate life transforming herself into the
even more insipid gum-chewing supermarket checker.</P>
<P>   See if you can guess the secret, but don't leave the theater
when you think the movie's over, as some did in a preview
screening.  Those who bolted to beat the crowd either knew
something the rest of us didn't or will have to wait for the
movie buzz to discover the concealed message of this film--
which for all its lack of humor and engaging dialogue is a
memorable experience in visual imagery, crisp acting, and
resonant imagination.</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 120 minutes.  (C) 1999
