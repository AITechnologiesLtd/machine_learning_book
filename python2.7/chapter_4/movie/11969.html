<PRE>                           MERCURY RISING 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2 :-( :-(  for mercury poisoning</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Miko Hughes, Chi McBride, Kim Dickens
Director: Harold Becker Producers: Brian Grazer, Karen Kehela
Screenplay: Lawrence Konner, Mark Rosenthal based on the novel SIMPLE
SIMON by Ryne Pearson</P>
<P>After viewing MERCURY RISING, it may be wrongly supposed that Bruce
Willis appears to be fumbling about for interesting side-kicks to fill
his action flicks. This movie may be viewed as DIE HARD WITH AUTISTIC
BOY, mixed in with strong psychological elements of remorse and
atonement for past failures (failing to save teenagers in a foiled bank
robbery). The plot attempts to pull at the viewer's heart strings, by
setting up too many a situation where a handicapped child is put in
harms way, only then to be rescued and hugged by the burly Willis – Oh
please! Or this may be seen as a egotistical movie where Bruce gets to
do all the talking, whilst his autistic co-star Simon (Miko Hugues) does
little except stare into blank space, grunt and scream when touched.</P>
<P>MERCURY RISING is not all bad, cause I can name at least one other
Willis movie that far out stinks this one – THE JACKAL. This movie
speaks of the ruthlessness of the NSA (National Security Agency). When
an autistic child is able to crack the American Government's toughest
code, their solution to the problem is to eliminate the child and
family. Naturally Bruce baby (FBI Agent) sees through their charade and
goes about to right wrongs in a DIE HARD/BOY SCOUT sort of a way. One
would think that perhaps after soooo many movies where disputes are
settled by fists and guns, a solution to the problem would be found
through mature discussion – after all, the FBI and NSA are on the same
side! But noooo, Bruce and Alec have to fall into the childish routine
of slugging it out in the end, like kids in a playground fight. I
personally felt that instead of trying to kill the kid who can crack any
code, the NSA should have utilised his abilities to break enemy nation
security codes – resolving the situation peacefully, calmly and
sensibly.</P>
<P>So I was not impressed by this movie, or by Willis' acting, attitude or
action. Alec Baldwin (ruthless NSA chief) has hardly any screen time and
is not seen much till the end of the movie. As for the poor kid they
dragged into making this movie, I just hope he doesn't become
psychologically traumatised by all of this Hollywood, BULLAHOO
commotion.</P>
<P>The only thing that rises in this movie is your blood pressure, at
having to endure such heartfelt trash.</P>
