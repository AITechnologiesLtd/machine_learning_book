<PRE>                                  LIAR LIAR
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Jim Carrey stars in a morality comedy
          about the value of veracity and the price of
          prevarication.  A lawyer finds his own son has
          cursed him to speak nothing but the truth for one
          whole day.  A little bit of the Carrey personality
          goes a long way and too much of it steals what just
          a bit would have given the film.  The script seems
          a bit inconsistent about just what are the terms of
          the curse.  Rating: high 0 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics:  12 positive, 0 negative, 7 mixed</PRE>
<P>     LIAR LIAR is basically a retread of a 1961 episode of THE TWILIGHT
ZONE.  In that story Jack Carson played a lying used car dealer Harvey
Hunnicut who bought a car that came equipped with a curse.  Whoever
owned the car could speak only the truth.  Carson made a few contorted
faces as he tried to force himself to lie to customers but eventually
had to give in to the acceptance that the curse really worked on him.
Eventually he was able to become a double winner not just because he
sold the car to someone else:  the person he sold it to was Nikita
Krushchev, Premier of the Soviet Union.  A similar concept was used in
THE WHOLE TRUTH, in which Bob Hope agrees to tell the truth for a whole
day.  LIAR LIAR is, however, much closer to the TWILIGHT ZONE story,
with the lying profession changed from used car salesman to an
unscrupulous lying lawyer.  The sorrowful or bewildered facial gestures
Carson gave his Hunnicut character.  But the facial gestures are
exaggerated by Jim Carrey into, well, what we would expect from Jim
Carrey.</P>
<P>     Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, not just a lawyer but the paragon of
lying lawyers.  Fletcher makes his living by subverting the truth.  And
what he does in his professional life he does in his private life.
With cheating and lies he destroyed his marriage to his former wife
Audrey (Maura Tierney) and is in the process of alienating their son
Max (Justin Cooper).  Fletcher has promised to be at Max's fifth
birthday party and is instead in bed with his boss (Amanda Donohoe of
LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM) trying to screw his way to the top.  The
disappointed Max makes a wish that his father cannot lie for a whole
day.  And the wish comes true, on a day when Fletcher needs to be a
skillful professional liar Fletcher discovers that only the truth can
issue from him mouth.</P>
<P>     LIAR LIAR could have had a deeper resonance if its positive
statements were not always undermined by what is just too much
slapstick.  The film was directed by Tom Shadyac of ACE VENTURA and THE
NUTTY PROFESSOR where it really needed someone of the caliber of Billy
Wilder.  In addition, it builds to an action-packed finale that goes
too far beyond what is really needed for this sort of material.  Again
the subtlety of Wilder could have worked wonders.  But for me the real
problem with LIAR LIAR is that the scriptwriters, Paul Guay and Stephen
Mazur, are never sure of the ground rules of the premise and so the
audience is never sure either.  What exactly is the wish all about?
Supposedly it was that Fletcher cannot tell a lie for twenty-four
hours, but what does that mean?  Does it mean that he can or cannot
evade the truth?  Sometimes the answer is yes, sometimes no.  Can he
remain silent or does he have to always be candid?  Is a promise made
in good faith and then later broken intentionally the same thing as a
lie?  For that matter is a promise made in good faith and broken due to
uncontrollable circumstances the same thing as a lie?  Do the same
forces that compel truth from Fletcher bend fate so that what he has
promised will come inevitably true?  These are all questions that
should have been answered before the first word of the script was
typed.  There were moments in this story when a truthful answer of "I
really would not want to answer that question right at this moment"
would have been the logical way out of Fletcher's current problem when
he instead seems compelled to give an overly candid response.</P>
<P>     In addition something not required by the premise are the over-
the-top rubber-faced expressions from Carrey who breaks through to
telling the truth like he is smashing through a physical barrier.  It
would not be a Jim Carrey film without some of this, but as he usually
does he carries a good thing too far.  Carrey is amusing, but his
antics get in the way of the viewer getting any real feeling out of his
part.  Implied, but never fully developed, is that the most important
effect of the curse on his character is that he can no longer lie to
himself.  By just being honest with himself he achieves a new level of
self-understanding that allows him to put his life in order.  The
script makes another ironic point.  While the film shows how much
damage Fletcher has done with his lies, some of his lies have had
positive effects.  His uncontrollable candor hurts people who relied on
some of his little fibs to bolster their egos.  Telling the truth to
everybody is almost as destructive as lying was.</P>
<P>     With a little more concentration on the script and a little more
subdued Carrey, this could have been a much better film.  As it is, it
gets a high 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
