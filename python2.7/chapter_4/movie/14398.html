Susan Granger's review of "PI" (Artisan Entertainment)</PRE>
<P>Darren Aronofsky won the Director's Award at the 1998 Sundance
Film Festival for this low-budget, black-and-white cinematic calculus
which explores the meaning of life through numbers. Sean Gullette
plays a renegade math genius with a troubled genealogy that goes back
to Dr. Frankenstein. Caught between blinding flashes of brilliance and
equally blinding migraine headaches, he searches his home-built
super-computer, named Euclid, for a formula that will reveal a
numerical pattern within the chaos of the stock market. He's obsessed
with finding a unifying order in everything - from the cream spiraling
in his coffee to the infinite possibilities in his weekly board games
with his mentor, Mark Margolis. His research makes him popular with
rabid Wall Street analysts as well as with Orthodox Jewish cabalists
who believe that he has stumbled upon a 216-digit number that will
reveal God's first name. "The Torah's just a long stream of numbers,"
he's told by Ben Shenkman, a Jewish numerologist. "Some say it's a
code, sent by God."  What does the title mean? When the Greek
mathematician Archimedes couldn't calculate the answer to a difficult
problem, he gave up and retired to his bath where, in repose, the
solution - the mathematical notation used to represent the ratio of
the circumference of a circle to its diameter - suddenly came to
him. What does dense, tormented Max discover? A secret everyone is
willing to kill for. Despite its wobbly, hand-held photography and
grainy texture, on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Pi" is an
eccentric, cerebral 7, concluding that life doesn't fall into
predictable patterns and complete control is impossible.  It's an
imaginative, intellectually stimulating feature-film debut for this
promising writer/director.</P>
