<P>Susan Granger's review of "NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS" (Universal)</P>
<P>When audiences went wild for the "Nutty Professor"
dinner-table sequences in which Eddie Murphy played various members of
the Klump clan, the idea for a sequel was born. So, although heavy-set
Professor Sherman Klump remains the central character, his
dysfunctional family is fleshed out, literally, each member with
his/her own subplot. Last time, Sherman Klump came up with a way to
lose weight; this time, he discovers a youth serum. Annoyingly
neurotic Dean Richmond (Larry Miller) wants to sell the formula to a
drug company, while romance comes in the form of Janet Jackson as a
shy, sweet professor who's in love with Sherman.  Aggressive, skinny
Buddy Love is still in Sherman's system, bursting out unexpectedly,
until Sherman extracts him from his body.  It's like Jekyll and Hyde
separating. Buddy is no longer a sexist, mischievous alter-ego; he's
an evil ego trying to steal Sherman's "youth juice". The clash between
Buddy and Sherman as separate entities gives the plot tension because,
when Buddy's DNA goes so do Sherman's IQ points. With the help of
make-up genius Rick Baker, Eddie Murphy is chameleon-like. Mama holds
the family together; she's the most like Sherman. Papa and Ernie
Jr. are more alike. And Grandma's sexually voracious. What's amazing
is the seamless interaction of all Eddie's characters: how the eyeline
movement of one is combined with physical action of another in a
complicated digital ballet. But, despite four writers and director
Peter Segal, it's is incoherent. Clever, yes. Funny, no. The visual
gags and crude jokes are stale and predictable, and the 'space dream'
scene is downright stupid. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps" is a raunchy, gimmicky, forced 3.
It's tour-de-force Eddie - all over the screen!</P>
