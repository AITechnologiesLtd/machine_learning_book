<P>WELCOME TO SARAJEVO
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **½ (out of ****) 
Miramax / 1:43 / 1997 / R (language, explicit war carnage, brief nudity)
Cast: Stephen Dillane; Woody Harrelson; Marisa Tomei; Emira Nusevic; Kerry Fox; 
Goran Visnjic; Emily Lloyd; James Nesbitt 
Director: Michael Winterbottom 
Screenplay: Frank Cottrell Boyce <HR>The most unsettling moment in Michael Winterbottom's "Welcome to Sarajevo" 
concerns not images, but words. It happens when a United Nations rep, explaining 
why the titular, turmoil-stricken country ranks fairly low on their priority 
list, tells the press corps, "We have to deal with 13 countries in the world 
which are worse than Sarajevo." Considering the brutal, vivid bursts of violence 
we have seen up until this point -- and will continue to witness until the 
movie's over -- his declaration seems like a drastic understatement. The 
frequent carnage depicted in "Welcome to Sarajevo" blends footage both real and 
fake, and the viewing experience is quite queasy as a result. </P>
<P>Based on the true-life account recorded by British journalist Michael Nicholson 
in the book "Natasha's Story," "Welcome" tells the story of a group of varied 
war reporters stationed in Sarajevo in 1992. Nicholson's film counterpart comes 
in the form of Michael Henderson (Stephen Dillane), a veteran television 
correspondent who, along side of his colleagues (including Woody Harrelson, 
Emily Lloyd and Shallow Grave's Kerry Fox), are angered and perplexed as to how 
Sarajevan troubles are taking backseat to the Royal Family's marital 
difficulties on the news and in the papers. Henderson then sets his sights on 
the impoverished, victimized children at a local orphanage in hopes that people 
will realize how monumental their situation is.</P>
<P>"Sarajevo"'s visual spectacle is so fierce and gritty that rarely does five 
minutes go by without the urge to look away from the screen becoming a tad 
unbearable. Of course, just because a movie is difficult to watch -- and this 
one is -- doesn't make it bad by any means (need I say more than "Schindler's 
List"?), but sights are really the movie's only powerful element. Characters and 
their relationships here are so blank and underdeveloped that they barely 
register; try to tell the female parts from one another -- I dare you. The 
film's eventual focus is on Henderson's effort to rescue a young, saucer-eyed 
urchin (Emira Nusevic), but their scenes are hurried and half-formed. It's hard, 
then, to invest much emotional baggage in the potentially harrowing moments that 
are devoted to them. </P>
<P>At least we can be happy that "Welcome to Sarajevo" doesn't degenerate into 
blatant manipulation. The screenplay, while frustrating in patches, does allow 
for noble performances from its cast -- especially Dillane and newcomer Nusevic 
-- and provide a handful of memorable (though not necessarily in a good way) 
segments. Technical credits are also fantastic; it's impossible to tell what 
shots are genuine and which ones aren't, giving the movie a very appropriate, 
documentary-like feel. It just seems as though the film is uneven to the point 
of disappointment. "Welcome to Sarajevo" is an extremely admirable effort on 
behalf of its filmmakers, and I'm afraid that's nearly all it is. <HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" -- Roger Ebert on "Look
