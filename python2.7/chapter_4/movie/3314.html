                       A film review by Rich Siegel
                        Copyright 1995 Rich Siegel</PRE>
<P>Keeping Up With the Joneses--Chinese Style.  </P>
<P>     ERMO is a cautionary tale of the pitfalls of the emerging
middle-class in modern Chinese society.  Ermo, the title character, is
a product of Chinese economic free-market reforms.  She's a
self-employed noodle maker who also makes produce baskets on the side
for extra income.  She supports her lazy husband  "Chief," a former
village official, and her son Tiger through long hours of hard work.
For her efforts, her family leads a modest but comfortable life.</P>
<P>     Ermo's problem is that her next door neighbors--"Blindman," his
wife and daughter--are doing even better.  Blindman bought a truck
which he uses as the basis of his successful hauling business.  They're
so successful, in fact, they own the neighborhood's only TV which makes
their home the favorite hangout of the local kids, including Tiger.
Ermo develops an intense jealousy of her neighbors; both for their TV
and for the resourceful, hardworking  "Blindman" who puts her own
layabout husband to shame.</P>
<P>     On a visit to a nearby city to sell her baskets, she sees
something in a department store that, for her, represents the answer to
her feelings of low self-esteem: a 29-inch color TV--bigger than the
richest family in the county could afford.  She determines that owning
this TV will restore her feeling of self-worth and improve her standing
in the community.  She decides to devote all her efforts to acquiring
this technological jewel despite the fact that she has little interest
in watching television herself.  In fact, she finds it quite
bewildering.  As she watches a store display of televisions she's
amazed at how the foreigners on the imported programs can all speak
Chinese.  She even becomes concerned, while watching a foreign language
program, that the TV has forgotten how to speak her native language.</P>
<P>     Despite this, however, the TV becomes Ermo's obsession.  She will
go to any length to acquire it.  She takes a restaurant job in the
city, where she lives, during the week, in squalid barracks.  She even
sells her own blood to the local blood bank for extra cash.  Every
night she lays her money out on her bed and counts and sorts her bills,
waiting for the day her new dream will be fulfilled.</P>
<P>     ERMO shows us the jealousies, petty bickerings, and romantic
intrigues common in middle-class life.  Although these situations are
dealt with in countless films, seeing them in the context of a rapidly
changing culture gives them new life.  Director Zihou Xiawen uses a
decidedly light touch to point out the darker side of capitalism.  Even
with its tragic elements, the film is good-humored and vibrant.
Despite their flaws, most of the characters have an underlying goodness
and honesty about them that makes it easy to sympathize with their
attempt to come to terms with a changing value system.</P>
