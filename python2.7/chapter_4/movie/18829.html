****** HUGE SPOILERS ******</PRE>
<P>"Talking about love is like dancing about architecture."</P>
<P>"Playing by Heart" is movie with a very cute and promising premise: four
couples, seemingly unrelated, each deal with their relationship problems. 
In the end, it is discovered that they're all connected in some way.  Here's
a plot that's refreshing, somewhat original, and has a potential for
greatness.  For once, a movie has more *dialogue* than it has special
effects and gratuitous nudity.  But "Playing" is a few olives short of a
vodka martini.  </P>
<P>The least they could have done was keep us interested in the characters
long enough for the big "surprise" at the end, which the preview for the
movie all but gave away, so I was probably at a disadvantage.  Being
mysterious is fine, but you've got to have enough punch to keep the movie
running at a fair pace.  A damn shame, because aside from a few subtle
hints like "angerball," there really wasn't anything that gave the ending
away.</P>
<P>Of all the couples, only Angelina Jolie and Ryan Philippe's Joan and Keenan
have really grabbed my attention.  Even though Philippe was stiff as a
stick and Jolie didn't really "grow into" her character until the movie was
well underway.  And even then it felt like they were reciting their lines. 
But at any rate, the characters were the most developed: Here's a guy who
seems to have a lot of emotional baggage hidden inside, and a girl who's
very unabashed about expressing her feelings. I found myself wondering
whatever happened to Keenan, and whether this odd couple would ever get
together (whether I thought they were right for each other, on the other
hand, is an entirely different matter).  In contrast, I didn't really care for
the other couples.  Jon Stewart's Trent was played and written as a slick,
unlikable sleazebag, and Gillian Anderson's Meredith was a character who
developed solely out of her past (her unhappy marriage with Jay Mohr's
Mark, which we will deal with later).  Throughout the whole courtship the
problem was that Meredith supposedly had too many walls around her;
well, those walls came tumbling down a little too soon, too conveniently. 
Gillian Anderson's mellow, stoic performance as Meredith once again
confirmed my suspicion that she's most cut out for the role of Dana
Scully.   Or was it because Meredith was too similar to Scully?  I hope it
is the latter.  I never really understood Madeline Stowe / Anthony Edwards
/ Dennis Quaid triangle, partly because the film didn't take enough time to
explain their relationship.  The same with Sean Connery and Gena
Rowlands.  I'm not saying that the explanation was incomplete, or the
characters any less deserving of sympathy--but that we were given too
little to go on.  We've just gotten to know these characters at a certain
turning point in their lives, and it's just too bad that we aren't given the
chance to get more acquainted with them.  The whole other sideline with
Jay Mohr and Ellen Burstyn seemed unnecessary; sure, it made for a great
story, contributed a few good scenes, gave a few surprises at the end, but
it had nothing to do with the theme of the movie (dancing about
architecture, so to speak).  All in all, it was disappointing that only two
of the eight main characters succeeded in "being"; the rest in comparison
seemed like mere paper dolls cut out to serve the story's purpose.  Part of
the reason is because they were played with so little conviction: a well-
developed character needs good lines, good scenarios, and a good actor;
here the dialogue seemed to shoulder too much of the burden.  We were
constantly being hit over-the-head with monologues about the character's
problems, without a lot of acting to back it up.  The big obstacle: making
the characters three-dimensional before the big revelation deadline.  It
doesn't matter if a particular stage of the development was too hasty, we
have to move on because they all need to be happily together by the end of
two hours.  It's a shame to see how often an assembly of great actors go
to waste.</P>
<P>It might be confusing if I said that what could have made this story more
interesting is where the movie failed.  The premise was great: brief
glimpses into the lives of couples that we run into almost everyday,
gradually getting to know these couples, then reaching some sort of a
conclusion.  However, everything seemed to work against it. The snippets
started to become annoying when after each one we felt confused and
apathetic rather than interested.  There were a few scenes that were
noteworthy, but the movie as a whole seemed disjointed.  I don't want to
discourage the obviously very talented writer of this story by saying
(*snort*, like he'll ever read this) this, but I think the movie could have
been better with a few fix-ups.  As much as I rant about my disappoint,
the movie was satisfying in its attempt at deciphering the world of love
and make us sigh with contentment with its sappy-sweet ending.</P>
<P>"You can't treat people like you treat people and then say something
adorable like that."</P>
<PRE>Rating: C+ (First viewing, 1/28/99)</PRE>
<P>*Highlight: Gillian Anderson giving Sean Connery a kiss.  Wasn't that
wonderful?</P>
<P>*The disgusting toothpaste kiss.  Ugh.</P>
<P>*"My mind has an endless capacity for useless information." -- Dude,
sounds like me.</P>
