<PRE>Final Destination (6/10)</PRE>
<P>These days, teen slasher flicks are expected to be self-referential and
ironic. But in a strange reversal, Final Destination seeks to defy the
new convention by approaching the genre straight (although the writers
couldn't resist naming characters after film-makers such as Hitchcock,
Lewton, Browning and Murnau).  In this return to pre-Scream horror movie
making, characters just go about the traditional business of getting
hacked to bits without spending half the time discussing what would
happen if they were in a slasher flick.</P>
<P>The story has a premise that could have come straight out of The
Twilight Zone. A group of high-school students is about to leave on a
school trip to France. While in the aircraft on the tarmac waiting to
take off, Alex (Devon Sawa) has a premonition in which the aircraft
explodes after take-off. He panics and is removed from the plane, along
with a few fellow students and a teacher. Sure enough, the plane
explodes, and all onboard are killed. When bizarre and wickedly
entertaining accidents start disposing of the survivors one by one, Alex
realises that the killer is not one of those Freddie Krueger or Candyman
amateurs, but is the scythe-wielding Big D himself, determined to
restore natural order by dispatching those who cheated death in the
aircraft. </P>
<P>As the film progresses, we wonder not only which member of the young
cast is next going to meet his or her end, but what grisly new twist on
slicing, mangling or skewering is going to be involved. Some of the
deaths are ludicrously protracted and involve everyday objects taking on
a life of their own, controlled by the unseen killer like a deadly and
perversely funny game of Mousetrap. Just to keep us on our toes,
director and co-writer James Wong, who cut his teeth on the X-files,
gives us one death that is shockingly abrupt.</P>
<P>Final Destination is a formulaic horror flick for the Saturday night
popcorn crowd, with flashes of inventively gruesome fun.</P>
