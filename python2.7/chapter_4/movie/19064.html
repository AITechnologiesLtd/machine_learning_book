<P>Francois Girard directs this arty movie which consists of five languages,
English, German, French, Italian, and Mandarin Chinese. The Red Violin follows
the travels of a violin built in 1681 by Nicolo Bussotti, (Carlo Cecchi) who
spends hours working on perfecting his violin.  After the death of his wife
Anna (Irene Grazioli) during childbirth, Nicolo commemorates the violin to
Anna, building it to perfection.  After around one hundred years, the violin
resurfaces in Austria.  At an orphanage, the young Kaspar Weiss (Christoph
Kocnz) plays the red violin with great talent.  After seeing Kaspar play the
instrument, music teacher Georges Poussin (Jean-Luc Bideau) takes on the
responsibility of preparing Kaspar for a concert in front of the Vienna
emperor.  From Vienna, the violin ends up in Oxford, England where musician
Frederick Pope (Jason Flemyng) has possession of the violin, and with his great
technique and playing style, Pope quickly becomes a famous violinist.  From
England, the violin is shipped to Shangai, China, where Xiang Pei (Syvlia
Chang) owns the violin, but must keep it hidden because China considers music
pointless and offensive.  The last journey the violin goes on in the film is to
Montreal, Canada, where Charles Mortiz (Samuel L. Jackson) is investigating if
the violin is authentic for an auction that is going to take place.  In each of
the five stories, the violin brings good fortune, followed by bad fortune. </P>
<P>Each chapter of the film unfolds as Cesca, (Anita Laurenzi) a fortune teller,
turns over a new tarot card, telling Anna Bussotti her future, which
mysteriously becomes the fortune of the violin's.  Director Francois Girard
makes this film seem like five short movies, all starring one main character,
the red violin.  Over the three hundred years that the film takes place, we are
bombarded with dazzling costumes, realistic set pieces, and beautiful,
classical music written by John Corigliano.  The music is mysterious and sets
the mood for the different sections of film.  Joshua Bell, who composes the
solo violin pieces, executes each song with great feeling, just as every actor
playing the violin does.  The music matches each section well, as the sections
become closer to the present, the music seems more fresh and modern. </P>
<P>The Red Violin has no lead human character, only about fifteen actors that
support the performance of the lead character, the red violin.  Each supporting
character gets around fifteen minutes of screen time, making the best of their
time, performing to their potential.  Each character had their own, unique
personality which was developed well in the short time they had on screen.  The
strongest performances come from Samuel L. Jackson and Sylvia Chang, whose
performances are effective as they perform every line with great feeling.</P>
<P>Leaving the theater, I felt spellbinded by what I saw.  The Red Violin, with
its mixture of mesmerizing music, vast settings, and the innovative way of
presenting the film makes for a film that left me stunned when the credits
started rolling.  The Red Violin is an international movie, using five
different languages, so the dialogue cannot be understood by the average
citizen of any country.  Although those five languages may not be familiar to
one individual, The Red Violin has a language everyone can understand,
wonderful music.  Being a musician, and a music lover, The Red Violin may
appeal to me more than many others, but all of the elements of the film work
and make a great movie.  It is amazing that one violin has been through much
more than any human will ever be through, and the film got me thinking.  Where
has the penny in my pocket been?  Where has my trumpet been?  I am left with
one final question about the film- Like the violin whose story was told, the
film is high quality.  Where will this movie go, concerning awards and the
thoughts of the viewers?</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- The Red Violin was music to my ears.</P>
