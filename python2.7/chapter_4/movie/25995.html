<P>   Our era in the U.S. has become known as one that glorifies
identity politics.  Being American is fine, its advocates say,
but be especially proud of where you came from.  You're
African-American, or Italian-American or Jewish-American or
Whatever-American.  I suppose this makes some sense since
nobody--not even Native Americans--originally came from
here.  Sometimes I think it's overdone.  In any case the jury
is still out on whether people are really coming out of the
closet in droves to celebrate their origins.  My impression is
that most people, especially the young, like to think of
themselves as thoroughly assimilated into the so-called
American Way of Life, but in the film "Left Luggage"--which,
to be fair has nothing to do with the U.S. but takes place in
the Belgium of the early 1970s--director Jeroen Krabbe
pushes the idea that young Jewish people who are
assimilated into the Belgian culture should secure more of a
feeling for their Jewish identity.  </P>
<P>This concept comes out of Carl Friedman's novel, "The
Shovel and the Loom" as scripted by Edwin De Vries, and
centers on an assimilated 20-year-old, Chaja (Laura Fraser),
whose consciousness of Judaism is marginal even though
her parents are Holocaust survivors.  Her father (Maximilian
Schell) comes across as eccentric to her because he is
obsessed with digging all over the family's home town of
Antwerp in search of luggage he buried in the early 1940s
when in flight from the Nazis, while Chaja's mother (Marianne
Sagebrecht), on the other hand, is in denial about the
Holocaust and spends her days weaving a blanket and
making pound cake.  Because Chaja needs money to pay
rent, a family friend Mr. Apfelschnitt (Chaim Topol) secures
for her a job as a nanny with a Hasidic family headed by Mr.
Kalman (Jeroen Krabbe), whose wife (Isabella Rossellini)
teaches her the special rules of the ultra-orthodox sect. 
Falling in love with the Kalman's four-year-old boy, Simcha
(Adam Monty), Chaja is determined to find out why the little
charmer refuses to speak and to encourage his vocal chords
so that Mr. Kalman can be proud of him.</P>
<P>"Left Luggage" is in not as dramatic or convincing as another
Hasidic-centered tale, Boaz Yakin's 1998 "A Price Above
Rubies," a far more commercial offering starring Renee
Zellweger as an unhappy Hasidic housewife in New York City
who years for sexual liberation and the freedom to pursue a
career.  In fact "Left Luggage" is downright small, more
suitable for cable TV or the stage than for the big screen.  It
might appeal to Jews of all stripes who are curious about how
a young, liberated woman would fare in a culture clash with
people she had always considered bizarre, and to Gentiles
eager to learn more about Jewish culture and the different
ways that members of the tribe practice or do not practice
their faith.  Dialogue is occasionally so faint that it's virtually
inaudible.  The only true drama occurs toward the conclusion
when a heartbreaking event makes Chaja think long and hard
about her way of life, an event that teaches her more than
she could ever learn as a philosophy major in college.  </P>
<P>   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is the way
that art follows life.  Its director, Jeroen Krabbe, comes from
a Jewish mother and Gentile father, and while the maternal
side of the family were destroyed in the Dutch Holocaust,
Krabbe had for a long time not been aware of the tragic
circumstances because the family were too pained to discuss
wartime catastrophes.  When he came across Carl
Friedman's book he had determined to direct the movie
version despite his lack of knowledge about the Hasidim. 
What emerges in the film is a sensitive, heartbreaking
portrayal that falls short of gripping the spectator, as the
meager story becomes lost on the big screen.</P>
