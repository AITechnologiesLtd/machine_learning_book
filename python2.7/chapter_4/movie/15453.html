<P>Actor Peter Berg quietly tucks his thespian slippers under his bed for
a little while, and slips into a new role as writer and director of
this extremely black comedy starring everybody's favourite Jack
Nicholson-wannabee, Christian Slater, and the wonderfully cheery
Cameron Diaz.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Kyle and his friends go to Las Vegas for his bachelor party. They drink
like fish, snort a lot of cocaine and hire a hooker for some fun. When
the prostitute suddenly kicks the bucket, the boys have to resort to
plenty of sinful shenanigans to get out of their dilemma. One cover-up
leads to another, and all of a sudden, our friends are caught in a
downwards spiral of all things moral. Meanwhile, Kyle's wife Laura is
much more concerned with her wedding going off without a hitch, and the
guests having the padded chairs which she requested.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Deeply disturbing, violently graphic, hilarious romp that chews into
every sick, twisted taboo that you'd ever think about, then goes one
step further, and then another step...and then one too many. This film
is one of the blackest of all the black comedies that I have ever seen!
It starts off with a good premise, and then gets darker and darker and
funnier and funnier, and then a little darker still. It pushes every
envelope that you thought would never be pushed, and succeeds in most
of what it is trying to do. These guys find themselves in an awful
predicament, and attempt to solve it by unsuspectingly placing
themselves in an ever worse predicament, and so on, and so forth. All
the while, the film laughs at itself, and the absurdity of every single
exaggerated situation that they find themselves in. Having said that,
please don't expect to find this story based in much reality, because
it does go overboard quite a bit, but that is its purpose.</P>
<P>The cast is great, with Slater playing one of his best roles in years
(Reminiscent of his psycho role in another great black comedy, HEATHERS
(8/10)), the rest of the boys also come through like gangbusters, and
Diaz plays the role of the ultimate wannabee bride convincingly. Berg's
camera technique is also well-handled, while the run time of the film
trickles in right before any indigestion. The only issue that I did
have with this movie was the fact that I did find myself rolling my
eyes about 3/4 of the way through, when some of the things just started
getting a little too much out of hand. Having said that, the ending was
ironically hilarious, and the overall audacity of the cast, and most of
all, Peter Berg was a sight to behold. This man must've been in some
kind of a funk when he wrote this crazy script because it is totally
"out there"! If you like to see movies that take things to the extreme,
then check this one out! If you like your standard, uncomplicated
Hollywood pictures, with your happy-go lucky couple and friends for
life, then forget this one, and go back and rent one of the eighteen
thousand romantic comedies out there.</P>
<P>Most of the humour in this film worked for me (and for most of my
friends, I might add), but admittedly, I have become accustomed to
overly-violent behaviour in films by now. If violence, murders and the
commitment of extremely immoral sins doesn't stir your darkened funny
cup, then forget that you ever heard about this film. This movie is
only for people who appreciate dark, dark humour under very bad,
horrible circumstances. But it's like I said, even I thought the
believability within this tent of black humour disappeared for a little
while, but all in all, the film worked for me as one of the year's most
original screenplays, and one of the most gruesome concepts to walk
down the cinematic aisle in a while. This is NOT for the faint of
heart, folks!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
The policeman character in this film is named Officer Randone. That was
the name of the cop role that director Peter Berg himself portrayed in
1997's COPLAND (7/10).
The man who plays the Rabbi in this film is the actual father of actor
Jeremy Piven. His name is Byrne Piven. You may remember Jeremy Piven
from his role as comedy writer on TV's "The Larry Sanders Show."
Leland Orser played the crazed man in the massage parlour who was
forced to dick a prostitute with a sharp object acting as his probing
member, in the gritty David Fincher thriller SE7EN (8.5/10).
Actor Adam Sandler was slated to play the part of Michael Berkow, but
pulled out after a couple of days, and was subsequently replaced by
Jeremy Piven.
An obvious homage to Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS (9/10) features
the five guys walking in slow-motion towards the camera during their
quick run to the local store.
Christian Slater's real name is Christian Michael Leonard Hawkins. He
was born in New York, New York, and most recently spent 59 days in jail
for assaulting his girlfriend and a police officer as well as cocaine
abuse. In 1994, good-guy Christian was also arrested for bringing a gun
on a plane. He is a major Star Trek fan, and word on the street is that
his unusual eyebrows are the result of him shaving them when dressing
up as Spock for Halloween. They apparently never grew back in properly.
Cameron Diaz was signed on as a model at the Elite Modeling Agency at
the age of 16, after being discovered at a Hollywood party. Soon
thereafter, she got alcohol poisoning in Australia at the age of 18. It
took Cameron 12 callbacks to get her breakthrough role in THE MASK
(7/10), opposite Jim Carrey. She was also slated to star opposite
Christopher Lambert in MORTAL KOMBAT, but was forced to pull out after
she injured her hand before filming had begun. Her father is a
second-generation Cuban, and her mother is of German, English and
Native-American ancestry. </P>
