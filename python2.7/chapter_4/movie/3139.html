<PRE>                             VANYA ON 42ND STREET
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Wallace Shawn, Julianne Moore, Larry Pine, Brooke Smith,
George Gaynes.
Screenplay:  David Mamet.
Director:  Louis Malle.</PRE>
<P>     A few years ago, I saw a production of "Les Miserables" in San
Francisco, and I loved it.  I loved the experience of being in that
theater, and of giving myself over to the spectacle and the energy of
that live performance.  Some time later, it occurred to me that if I
had seen the identical production on a movie screen, I probably would
have laughed myself silly at its bombast.  What does any of this have
to do with Louis Malle's VANYA ON 42ND STREET?  Only this: live
theater and film are not the same animal, and what works in one does
not necessarily work in the other.  VANYA ON 42ND STREET is a great
stage production, but as a film it is simply good.</P>
<P>     The film is a rendering of a sort of guerilla theater group
performance of Chekhov's UNCLE VANYA in a dilapidated theater on New
York's 42nd Street called the New Amsterdam.  The play is set on a
Russian country estate run by Vanya (Wallace Shawn), an embittered man
passing through middle age with little to show for his life.  He is
hosting Professor Serebryakov (George Gaynes), an ailing retired
academic and the widower of Vanya's sister, as well as the Professor's
young second wife Yelena (Julianne Moore).  Vanya is in love with
Yelena, as is Astrov (Larry Pine), the doctor who visits from the city
to tend to the Professor.  Astrov has an admirer of his own, the
Professor's daughter Sonya (Brooke Smith), but none of them seems
destined for happiness.</P>
<P>     The framing device, which shows the cast members and director
Andre Gregory walking down bustling New York streets towards the
theater, is clearly intended to establish a relevance of VANYA in the
modern day.  To the extent that it succeeds, that connection is really
about living a life in the theater.  There is a five year history
behind this production, as the principles met in living rooms,
abandoned theaters and really any available space in a pure labor of
love.  From the moment when the actors imperceptibly begin the
production with the line, "Your looks have faded," this VANYA becomes a
kind of purgation of the agonies of being an actor, and the characters
come to represent very recognizable types.  Serebryakov is every poseur
who succeeds while more talented performers struggle in anonymity;
Vanya is the workhorse who works unappreciated for years; Sonya is the
young would-be starlet who faces cruel realities about what it takes to
be noticed.  Played on a spartan stage and in contemporary dress, VANYA
seems startlingly modern and very personal to these performers.</P>
<P>     The years of rehearsal and refinement show in performances which
are effortless almost to a one.  Wallace Shawn, he of the gnome-like
features and familiar lisp, finds in Vanya a reservoir of black-humored
hope even as he acknowledges the horror of lost years.  Julianne Moore
(last seen--and plenty of her--in last year's SHORT CUTS) is a
stunning Yelena, and Larry Pine's Astrov is torn and conflicted
throughout without emoting.  However, perhaps the most wrenching
performance belongs to Brooke Smith, who tears into Sonya with an
emotional ferocity few actors could muster.  Her two scenes with Moore
are powerfully played, and when she broke down I felt tears welling in
my eyes.  It is as good a performance by a supporting actress as you'll
see this year.</P>
<P>     All these things VANYA ON 42ND STREET does exceedingly well, but
while I was sitting in my seat watching it on a screen, I often felt
more distanced than I should have felt.  Louis Malle's choices in
framing shots are not particularly inspired, and cinematographer Declan
Quinn's camera teeters for no apparent reason, creating that verite
vertigo pioneered by Woody Allen's HUSBANDS AND WIVES.  To put it
bluntly, I couldn't quite figure out why this film had been made.  I
started to become annoyed that I couldn't be one of the lucky few who
was able to see this production in the flesh, and I wondered why these
actors who were obviously so dedicated to this play hadn't considered
touring with it.  VANYA ON 42ND STREET is a superior interpretation of
a fantastic play, but I couldn't quite shake the conviction that I
really should have seen it *on* 42nd Street.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 old theaters:  7.</PRE>
