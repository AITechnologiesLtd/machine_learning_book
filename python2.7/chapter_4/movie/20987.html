<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For a film that prides itself on its use of wit to show what the
nobility and their King Louis XV1 were like during 1783, just before the
infamous French Revolution, I would have expected to be more than
dazzled by these nobles with their silver-tongued wit, cutting each
other to bits and pieces with their razor-sharpened retorts. Instead, I
found myself more taken with the history aspect of this good looking
costume spectacle and was not especially amused by the barbs. In fact, I
found the film rather anti-septic, not a particularly moving dramatic
experience. Overrated by some of the critics, who seemed to fall for
this French film's farcical intentions, deeming it intellectual in the
broadest sense of what is intellectual, while failing to construe how
ordinary and dispassionate the characters were.</P>
<P>The art of ridicule was the sword used by those who expected to gain
favor with the king and his court, with the hopes of having enough wit
so that they won't have their life ruined by failing to respond to
someone else's comments in a suitable manner. It was their way of
fighting for their position in life.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie centers around the serious-minded Baron
Ponceludon's (Berling) attempt to get royal backing on a needed drainage
project, which would help cultivate the swamp land he owns by getting
rid of the mosquitoes breeding there and help the peasants who work for
him have a better life. He is a French lord, trained as an engineer but
a noble of modest means, who must now ride by horse to Versailles and
learn to play the delicate games of wit at a place where the aristocrats
show an indifference to social concerns other than the ones that please
their own vanity. He comes here solely to raise the money he needs for
his life's work.</P>
<P>Part fiction and part history, this satire, as directed by Patrice
Leconte (Monsieur Hire/The Hairdresser's Wife), is not completely
absorbing in its romantic tale or as drama. The history part seemed to
be accurate enough, depicting the corruption of the king's court and his
placement of more importance on vacuous wit than genuine ideas. The
honest engineer from the country is quickly disheartened by what he sees
in Versailles, where you get the king's ear by trickery, or sleeping in
the right bed, or by deception. To meet the evasive king, you have to
make a name for yourself in Versailles through one of those methods.</P>
<P>The idealistic Ponceludon finds a local nobleman, who treats his wounds
when he is robbed on the road to Versailles, Bellegarde (Jean
Rochefort). He thinks Ponceludon might have some chance of succeeding in
being witty and offers him lessons of how to survive in Versailles, such
as, "Don't laugh at your own jokes and never laugh with your mouth
open", "Call puns the death of wit"; and remember,"The soul of wit is to
know one's place." This nobleman who will sponsor him, something needed
to get into the right circles at Versailles, also has a beautiful and
intelligent daughter, Mathilde (Judith), but who is prepared to marry an
older noble, whose plan is to gain access to her wealth. Now you know
she's going to fall in love with our hero; but, in between, Ponceludon
courts the seductively attractive and treacherous Countess de Blayac
(Fanny), as he is committed to get help for his swamp project anyway he
could. His problem with winning her over, is that her main man is the
arrogant and nasty master of wit himself, the clergyman Abbot de
Vilecourt (Giraudeau); and, of course, the rivalry between these two
wits will culminate in a gentleman's pistol duel, that is, after a
series of dueling witticisms are hurled back and forth. After his
battles with the nobles, it is still challenging to meet the insulated
king, busy living the "good life," who is just as indifferent as the
nobles are to the plight of the common man.</P>
<P>What elevates this film above merely showing how obviously stupid and
petty the nobles were, is that it stresses how the nobles had to use
language to survive in that atmosphere. Language therefore became a
source of power for them if used in conjunction with wit, as their class
status only gave them a ticket into the arena of power, so to speak.
This film is also about a moral dilemma for our good-hearted hero. He
must choose either what is morally correct or to sell himself out for
his project, which he considers as something that is more important than
how he might be perceived.</P>
<P>The acting or the story did not excite me enough to think that this
clever film was anything special, except as a mildly diverting farce,
which could be, at best, considered only as a film that had its moments
of being a clever satire. But mostly, it is a predictable French farce,
with enough one-dimensional characters in it to fill the court of
Versailles with retorts that would pale next to those heard in an
average schoolyard in urban America on a daily basis.</P>
