<P>As Good As It Gets
Director: James L. Brooks
Starring: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr.
Approx Running Time: 135 min.</P>
<P>In the film's opening scene, Melvin Udall (Nicholson) grabs a cute little
fuzzy dog who looks remarkably like an Ewok on all fours and tosses him down a
garbage chute. It was at this point I knew I would love this movie.</P>
<P>Not that I was happy to see the little guy suffer, mind you. As it turns out
the dog is fine and he remains throughout the rest of the film. He manages to
wiggle his way into your hearts too. But As Good As It Gets has so many things
that Hollywood films need these days. It has fantastic dialogue, lines you'll
be wanting to remember and use for years, extremely touching moments of
sentimentalism, and some brutal emotion. They all blend perfectly. </P>
<P>The only negative I could possibly pin on As Good As It Gets is it's slight
edge toward being formulaic....but I won't. It is too good a film to do that.</P>
<P>Simon Udall is a fantastic character, a sort of modern Ebneezer Scrooge. But
he is more developed than Srooge ever has been. He is a successful romance
novelist who locks himself in his upscale NY appartment and writes constantly.
But his quirks are what make him so unique. He is obsessive compulsive. He is
also obnoxiously superstitious. But most importantly, he is one nasty, horrid
man. Somehow, though, we can't help but love him. Probably because his
nastiness is so witty and original. Nicholson was born to play this role, and
any other actor would probably have failed to do it with such heart. His
performance is as close to perfect as it gets.</P>
<P>Carol Connoly (Helen Hunt) is a waitress at a local restaurant, the only one
that Simon chooses to eat at, and she is the only one on the staff who will
wait on him. (He brings his own plastic knife and fork each time...you gotta
love him.) Hunt really gets a chance to shine in this film. She turns in a
marvelous performance because she hits all the marks. She hits every chord at
the right time, whether it is silencing a room with her grave sincerity in
anger, or crying, or being goofy. She does it all so well. Hunt surely
deserves numerous nominations for showing the world that she is more than a
sitcom actress. To be honest, as much of a Helen Hunt fan as I was going into
it, I am in love with her now. She needs to dump Paul Buchman and move to
Hollywood, become an actress.</P>
<P>Greg Kinnear has come a long way from Talk Soup too. He plays Simon's next
door neighbor, a gay artist who is badly beaten when he tries to stop a
robbery in his own appartment. Kinnear proves his worth as a top notch
performer here. He avoids the gay stereotypes that so many straight actors try
to include when they play homosexuals, and yet you see his sexuality at all
times. It is a very interesting and touching performance, mostly because he,
like Helen Hunt, can tell a joke one moment and errupt realistically into
violence or emotion the next. To say the very least, As Good As It Gets is
filled with memorable performances.</P>
<P>It is pretty easy to see where As Good As It Gets is going throughout. The
film turns into a sort of pep talk for being good people, but that doesn't
really matter. It is so funny, so emotional and so incredibly well acted that
you don't care about that formula stuff. You just want to see what happens
next. Absolutely one of this years best films.
(Point of interest: Brooks could not decide on a title. For a while, the best
he could settle on was "Old Friends". Apparently, the fact that there were no
old friends in the film bothered him. He also threw about "Rock Bottom" and
"The Bright Side Of Life" which is a song Simon repeatedly played on his
piano)</P>
