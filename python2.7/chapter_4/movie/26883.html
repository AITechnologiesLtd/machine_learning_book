RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>The Rugrats are back in a movie, RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE, that is 
sweeter and funnier than their first.  Offering as much for the adults 
as the kids, the film opens with the classic wedding scene from the 
Godfather, complete with Nino Rota's music.  In a darkened room, one of 
the Rugrats, asking a favor of the "Bobfather," starts off with "I 
believe in the playground ..."  The surprise is that this scene plays as 
smartly funny for the kids in the audience as the adults.  My son 
mentioned it as one of his favorite parts.  </P>
<P>One of the girls even wakes up with a dead horse's head in her bed.  
Don't worry, the movie is correctly rated G.  The head came off of a 
rocking horse.  This scene, however, is one that undoubtedly will appeal 
mainly to the adults.</P>
<P>The Rugrats, as always, get much of their humor from their rampant 
malapropisms.  "Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bread," one of 
them remarks about a crabby stewardess.  The story has Chuckie's dad 
trying to find a wife.  When the kids hear about him looking for a 
"date," they decide that a date is a "raisin that makes you poop."</P>
<P>Mr. Pickles and the rest of the crew head for Paris where he is called 
to repair a large mechanical dinosaur called Reptar that is being used 
in something approximating a Gilbert and Sullivan opera.  The Paris 
setting gives the animators a chance to show off their colorful talents 
to maximum effect.  The result is a bright and cheerful movie that is a 
delight to watch.</P>
<P>The foreign locale also provides many opportunities for humor.  As the 
kids play with the first bidet that they have ever seen, one 
ecstatically proclaims, "Wow, a potty that squirts you back!"</P>
<P>My favorite line comes when the adults are in church.  As they sit in 
their pews at the famous Notre Dame cathedral, one of them starts to nod 
off to sleep.  "If you've seen one church, you've seen them all," she 
says sarcastically.  "Wake me if you see a hunchback."</P>
<P>So what monster will the French use in the big battle against Reptar?  
Why a gigantic, bright blue snail, of course.  The really gutsy move is 
that by Nickelodeon.  They scheduled it to open opposite THE GRINCH 
juggernaut.  They'll need help from all of the snails that they can get 
to knock out that blockbuster.  And they'll need lots of garlic.</P>
<P>RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE runs a fast 1:18.  It is rated G and would 
be fine for all ages.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, loves Rugrats and their latest movie, giving it 
****.  His favorite scene was Reptar's showdown with the big snail.  He 
also mentioned the music among several other parts that he really liked.  
His friend Maxim, age 12, gave it ***, saying it was a good movie but 
had only an okay plot.  His favorite parts were those with Reptar in 
them.</P>
