<P>DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS<HR></P>
<P>Earlier this year, Jim Carrey was the only reason to see "Me, Myself & Irene,"
a Farrelly Brothers mistep.  He's done it again.</P>
<P>Carrey simply *is* the Grinch, helped, of course, by Rick Baker's phenomenal
makeup design.  Whether he's gleefully tampering with Who mail ('jury duty,
pink slip, blackmail, eviction notice!'), going over his schedule
('4:00, wallow in self pity, 4:30, stare into the abyss') or lecturing
Max (Kelly, the film's other asset) on the art of being a reindeer, Carrey
had me sucked in.  However, when the focus shifts from Carrey, the movie
is abysmal.</P>
<P>Firstly, there's the story tampering.  We're given background as to how
the Grinch got this way (he was called names at school).  The Whos' Christmas
obssession has become crass commercialism, depressing Cindy Lou Who (newcomer
Taylor Momsen) to the point that she sings the maudlin 'Where Are You
Christmas?' mid-film.  The mayor (Jeffrey Tambor) is in a love triange
with Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski) and the Grinch!  Screenwriters
Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman ("Doc Hollywood") even have the poor
taste to include a couple of sex 'jokes' that seem seedy and woefully out
of place.</P>
<P>Secondly, there's the truly awful Whos (makeup again by Rick Baker).  They
look like rat-dogs.  Cindy Lou is too old and too normal looking in contrast
to the others.  Even the Grinch, when shown in flashbacks as a baby and an 
eight year old, looks awful, like a rejected monster from "Gremlins."</P>
<P>Thirdly, there's the art direction which is plastic and non-organic.
Whoville looks like Munchkinland crossed with the live action "Flinstones."  
I was always aware I was watching a soundstage covered in fake snow.  At one
point, the Grinch's quick entry/exit to Whoville is shown in an animated
sequence and the whole film is picked up for that one brief moment.  Otherwise
this is just a drab, grimy, bleak looking film.</P>
<P>I can't recommend "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas" as a film,
although I can recommend Carrey's performance and the casting of Max the dog.
Anthony Hopkins was chosen to narrate the film, perhaps to recall the
English accent of Boris Karloff from the vastly superior original animation,
a move the filmmakers should have avoided.</P>
