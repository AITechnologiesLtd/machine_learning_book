<P>There are far too many instances in modern cinema when a film with
wonderful promise fails to reach its full potential. It is frustrating
to see an opportunity for something fresh and exciting slip to the
elementary level of recycled formula. I was hoping `Galaxy Quest', a
film with a clever premise that begs for proper handling, wouldn't
suffer a similar fate. Luckily, this thoroughly entertaining `Star Trek'
homage has a few creative brain cells to spare, not to mention some
amusing perks for those craving sci-fi adventure.</P>
<P>`Star Trek' fans, be warned: you are being mocked in `Galaxy Quest'.
Actually, screenwriters Robert Gordon and David Howard show their basis
for inspiration in a rather loving manner, suggesting that this goofy
comedy is more of a playful homage to the Trekkies' universe. `Galaxy
Quest' is an ancient SF television program that has generated a rabid
cult following ever since its cancellation 18 years ago. But the
fan-gathering conventions still live on. Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), who
played the Shatner-esque Commander Peter Quincy Taggart on the program,
relishes every minute of the glorified fame that has continued through
the years. Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub)
and Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell) - who all played crew members of the
spaceship `Protector' - are also grateful for the fortune `Galaxy Quest'
has bequeathed upon them, despite the fact that Nesmith is always given
the spotlight. But Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), who played the
extraterrestrial medical man Dr. Lazarus, regrets the fact he will
always be labeled as his `Galaxy Quest' character - refusing to ever
repeat the line Dr. Lazarus is famous for.</P>
<P>And now, insert the clever premise: at the latest convention, Nesmith is
confronted by a group of pale individuals whom he assumes are dressed
like aliens. They insist that he join them on an important mission to
stop an evil intergalactic tyrant. Nesmith, assuming this is just
another acting gig, persuades the remainder of the cast to tag along.
And then comes the real shocker: the aliens at the convention, called
Thermians, are actual aliens. They believe that the space-age adventures
of the `Protector' are detailed historical documents from planet Earth.
In a nutshell: the Thermians assume they are enlisting the help of
Commander Taggart and his experienced crew when, in fact, they are
nothing but an aging group of out-of-work actors. Clever, isn't it?</P>
<P>Luckily, Gordon and Howard are able to maintain the humorous vibe
generated by the initial premise. With its sci-fi humor, `Galaxy Quest'
isn't always on the mark, but the light-hearted daintiness of the
screenplay helps establish a feeling of enjoyable giddiness. It's the
sort of giddiness you get when something promising is going your way,
and the outcome is inevitable. The villain of the story, named Sarris,
is a menacing creature who appears to be the result of a crossbreeding
experiment between a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and a lobster. In a
hilarious scene, Nesmith (still unaware that the situation is not an
acting gig) talks casually to Sarris over an video intercept and (after
noting that the makeup effects look fantastic) orders the Thermians to
bomb the enemies' ship with `a lot of missiles'. In both its
affectionate nod to the `Star Trek' universe and its structural basis
for inventive humor, `Galaxy Quest' is funny and clever.</P>
<P>The light-hearted adventure behind the story proves to be enjoyable as
well, with Stan Winston creature effects and F/X work that is thoroughly
impressive for a comedy. Among the peculiar alien life-forms the crew
encounters are a swarm of vicious demon children and a towering
formation of stones that would best be described as a ‘rock monster'.
The Thermians, on the other hand, are a race of peaceful beings caught
reluctantly in an intergalactic war. Their leader, the friendly Mathesar
(played with effective tenderness by Enrico Calantoni), is shocked by
the notion of anyone who offers misleading facts about themselves -
which could make it difficult for Nesmith and co. to reveal their actual
identities.</P>
<P>The human characters are well-played by the energetic cast. Former Tool
Man Allen hasn't had much luck with his previous ventures to the big
screen (I think `Jungle 2 Jungle' was the major cause of  suicide in
1997), but here his performance is perfect. Weaver looks terrific in a
blonde wig, Rickman shows a sophisticated knack for comic timing, and
Shalhoub has fun as the only crew member who doesn't seem awestruck by
the extraordinary predicament they are in. Even Sam Rockwell (who played
a garish inmate in `The Green Mile') reveals his lighter side, and even
steals a few scenes playing a guy who made a brief appearance before
being killed off in episode 81. For a comedy, `Galaxy Quest' is
unusually well-written and exceptionally well-conceived. Anyone
searching the galaxy for light-hearted fun - a `Star Trek' fan or not -
would be hard-pressed to do better.</P>
