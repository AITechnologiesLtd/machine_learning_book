<PRE>                         THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH
                       A film review by Wendy Betts
                        Copyright 1995 Wendy Betts</PRE>
<P>     I've now seen THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH twice, and what I've
noticed most about it is that it's the only movie I've ever watched
that, to some degree, captured the feeling of reading a book.  That's
partly because much of the movie is told as stories, but it's also
because the movie unfolds so deliberately, developing with such
delicate momentum it gives the rare illusion that you're moving at your
own pace.  I was afraid that a second viewing of the movie might be
boring--but like a rereading of a really good book, the second viewing
was even better than the first, as I could now appreciate the
significance of each event.</P>
<P>     THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH is a story about a little girl named
Fiona.  But it's also the story of her ancestor Sean, who almost
drowned but was rescued by a seal; and of her ancestor Liam, who stole
the sealskin coat from a selkie (half-seal, half-human) and married
her; and of her baby brother Jamie, whose coracle-like cradle was swept
out to sea, moving with unbelievable swiftness.  Most of all it's the
story of an island where seals and people lived in harmony--until the
people deserted it.  As Fiona's relatives tell her the history of her
family and the island of Roan Inish, she comes to believe that her baby
brother was taken deliberately by the seals because her family deserted
their island ... and that he is still there, a last representative of
her family on Roan Inish.  Strong and steadfast in her belief, Fiona is
determined to bring her brother back to her family, even though her
"daft" cousin Tadhg says that he's just with "another branch" of it.
But a bargain must be kept between the family and Roan Inish before
Jamie can return.</P>
<P>     With utterly natural performances, perfect authenticity in every
detail and exquisite cinematography that captures the atmosphere of
solitude and wild beauty of the sea and those who live in it, this
movie quietly reveals its secrets--and we delight in believing them,
feeling the wonderful rightness of a story happening just as it
should.  It may be the most fitting homage to storytelling ever
filmed.  See it.  Twice.</P>
