<PRE>Confessions from the potato-couch.</PRE>
<P>Whenever a new movie is made from TV shows, I take stock of my 
pop fiction background and find that my familiarity with 
television oldies is most limited.</P>
<P>Coming rather late to TV ownership, I made up for this with a 
big appetite for movies and more movies, programs -- mostly 
British, mostly funny (from Monty Python to Blackadder to Mr. 
Bean, Yes, Minister, Keeping Up Appearances, Waiting for God), 
Poirot, Inspector Morse, and so on. Even higher on the list 
are documentaries and cultural programs, especially those 
dealing with history, politics, society--what could be called 
The Way We Were.  </P>
<P>I marvel at the millions who remember shows with Groucho Marx, 
Jack Benny, Burns and Allen. Or All in the Family, Route 66, 
the Twilight Zone, Charlie's Angels, Dragnet, Bewitched... the 
list is huge. I suppose that those viewers sacrificed 
movie-movies for TV, and that more millions, younger folk with 
a vast knowledge of things well before their time, have a 
thing for reruns.  </P>
<P>My knowledge of  TV's Sergeant Bilko is zilch. With some 
sympathy, I remember Phil Silvers from  films, even though 
these were rarely top drawer. So, I cannot argue with persons 
who call the Phil Silvers Show a classic--though "classic" 
seems to apply to most anything that was on TV years ago, just 
as "antique" is used for many objects just a couple of decades 
old.</P>
<P>The upshot of all this is that I came to the movie "Sgt. 
Bilko" without prejudices or the ability to compare. The only 
comparison I can make is of Steve Martin with himself, in 
other movies. The answer is that once again, Martin is a major 
talent that almost never wears thin.</P>
<P>The movie's Bilko is a magna cum laude operator of tricks, 
scams, gambling, con-games, loaded dice set-ups, all issuing 
in and from the Ft. Baxter motor pool that the Sergeant runs. 
"Pool" takes on new meanings as men and women live it up in 
fun and games.</P>
<P>Martin, silver-haired and silver-tongued, thinks, improvises 
and acts on his feet so lightning fast that you just got to 
respect him. He lines with silver the pockets of his crew. 
They admire, love and follow him blindly, even as he lines his 
own pockets with gold. His bigger share is only fair, given 
his leadership, imagination and abilities.</P>
<P>Steve Martin is a great performer who here plays a great 
performer, a man of (metaphorically) a thousand faces. He 
issues brisk orders one moment, plays humble the next. When 
facing officers he has a visible factor of independence from 
authority, shows defiance, superiority or familiarity. The 
brass are putty in his hands. Bilko can cajole, flatter, play 
dumb or smarter-than-thou, and always comes out on top.</P>
<P>A juicy contrast is established when an outsider, young, 
straight-arrow, honest Pfc.Wally Holbrook joins the pool. 
Without missing a beat, Bilko, talking a mile a minute, puts 
the stupefied kid in the picture. Then, pointing to one of his 
people he adds: "He'll take your bag. Don't worry. He's 
bonded." If that's not a four-star line, what is? </P>
<PRE>Likewise, when the horrified Holbrook tries to wake up the men 
and women spread out all over the floor after what must have 
been a no holds barred party. As he enters Bilko's room, 
reveille is sounding. "What's that music?" asks the groggy 
Sergeant.                                                                                                                                                 </PRE>
<P>The performances, all of them, from big to tiny roles, are 
excellent. Dan Aykroyd plays beautifully second banana as 
Bilko's bozoid, gullible yet complicitous Colonel. Phil 
Hartman as Major Thorn does slow burns, all the better since 
they are acted with minimalism instead of the classic way made 
famous long ago by Edgar Kennedy.  </P>
<P>Thorn, now on inspection, might have been Colonel or General 
by now, except for a mishap, years ago, unwittingly caused by 
the Sergeant. In a hilarious flashback we see how Bilko had 
bribed an Army boxer to take a dive. Mistakenly, his assistant 
gave the money to the opponent pugilist, so that both fighters 
threw the match.</P>
<P>Without my getting into developments or details, the gags 
cascade and are most comical. Not subtle, not witty, but broad 
as befits farce. </P>
<P>There's a wild switching of barracks signs and soldiers' 
identitities during a Thorn inspection. Then comes an 
investigation by military nerds who must break the codes of 
Bilko's computers. </P>
<P>There is also a subplot about Bilko and his girl (Glenne 
Headley, reunited with Martin after the excellent "Dirty 
Rotten Scoundrels") whom he stands up at their wedding time 
after time, but who, in an appealing (and feminist) way, has a 
mind and will of her own. All this is wrapped up in fine 
production values and Alan Silvestri's clever, humorous score. </P>
<P>Now for the not-so-good news. As a great 19th Century actor 
lay on his deathbed, he turned to his sad-faced company: 
"Don't feel sorry for me. Dying is easy. Comedy is hard." 
Farce is even harder. </P>
<P>It's a rare movie that can sustain its brio past a certain 
point. At exactly the halfway mark "Sgt. Bilko" starts to 
slide and get rather tedious, at least in comparison to what 
came before. </P>
<P>I noticed that, in the public, loud peals of laughter subsided 
after the first part. Even so, the wonderfully imaginative, 
enjoyable, well timed initial 45 minutes are reason enough to 
see the film.</P>
