<PRE>                              SURVEILLANCE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Digital filmmaking technology can be a dangerous thing.  On the one
hand, it opens up affordable avenues of production to virtually
everyone.  On the other hand, it leads to a flood of movies on the
market that have been made for less than the cost of printing your
Christmas cards.</P>
<P>     Which, in the case of Surveillance, is apparently the case.</P>
<P>     The film's conceit is this: Digital video was not simply used for
cost concerns, but because it is integral to the story.  In the picture,
a private eye named Trip Stevens (Stephen Triplett -- get it?) is hired
by a becoming redhead named Junis Rozma (Jacqueline Carroll) to locate
her missing brother "C. Fred."  Trip, with his team of Charlie's
Angels-lite helpers, quickly learns that Fred's dead, baby, and soon he
is wrapped up in a convoluted web of trickery that revolves around a
porky cop, his inexlicable "fake prostitution stings," a Russian limo
driver, and a video dating service.  Think of it as a backyard,
undergrad version of Chinatown.</P>
<P>     As Trip is a P.I., the entire film is told from the perspective of
alleged surveillance and hidden cameras.  (Interesting idea, but it
turns out that just about everyone carries a "hidden camera" or two with
them, all the time, thus ruining that angle.)</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the lack of attention paid to Surveillance (its
really snazzy presskit aside) shows through at the seams.  A two-hour
running time is far too long to keep an audience seated without a score
or, at the very least, some better acting than we're treated to here. 
Triplett may be funny as a sketch-comedy player on Talk Soup, but his
mooning antics grow tiresome quickly in a feature film format (which, I
might point out, is not supposed to be a comedy).  A raft of other
semi-improvising and otherwise out-of-work actors (with the notable
exception of Carroll's femme fatale) doesn't help matters.</P>
<P>     While Surveillance makes good use of the photographic options of
DV, it ends up relying more on handheld bouncy-cam footage a la The
Blair Witch Project than anything else.  Rotten sound design leaves much
of the film hard to make out aurally -- a problem that would have been
largely avoided had an aggressive editor chopped about 80 minutes of fat
out of the film.</P>
<P>     Surveillance ultimately has a few charming moments but feels more
like a weekend film school project than the daringly experimental
feature it desperately wants to be.  Nice try.</P>
