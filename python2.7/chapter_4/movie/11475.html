<P>     Oscar Madison and Felix Ungar are back on the big screen.  It has 
been thirty years since Neil Simon's play, "The Odd Couple," was 
transformed from a stage production to a movie, with Walter Matthau as 
the disorderly, ill-mannered Oscar and Jack Lemmon as the "human vacuum 
cleaner" Felix.  And, as the play led to a film, so the film inspired a 
popular TV series in the '70s, with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall in the 
lead roles.  Now, in 1998, Simon is attempting to revive his flagging 
career as a comic writer by resurrecting his two most popular creations.  
It doesn't work.</P>
<P>     Six or seven years ago, this film might have been worthwhile for 
nostalgic reasons – Matthau and Lemmon together again, their bickering 
as enjoyable as ever.  The problem is, in the last five years, the two 
veteran actors have appeared opposite each other three times (four, if 
you count THE GRASS HARP).  And, whether they're called Herbie and 
Charlie (OUT TO SEA) or Max and John (GRUMPY OLD MEN, GRUMPIER OLD MEN), 
Matthau and Lemmon rarely let their characters stray too far from Oscar 
and Felix.  As a result, THE ODD COUPLE 2 comes across as redundant.  
That wouldn't have been the case if it had offered more than a few token 
laughs and a series of unconvincing "buddy moments," but this movie is 
far removed from Simon's best work.</P>
<P>     It has been 17 years since Oscar, who moved to Sarasota, Florida, 
and Felix, who still lives in New York City, have seen each other.  In 
the interim, neither has changed.  The occasion of their reunion is the 
most improbable of circumstances – Oscar's son, Bruce (Jonathan 
Silverman), is marrying Felix's daughter, Hannah (Lisa Waltz).  The two 
ex-roommates greet each other in Los Angeles International airport, then 
jump in a rental car for the trip to San Melina.  It's not long before 
they're lost, and that's when the series of misadventures begins.</P>
<P>     Aside from the always-enjoyable chemistry between the stars, THE 
ODD COUPLE 2 doesn't have much to offer.  The script has the same kind 
of stale, made-for-TV feel that is evident in many of today's big screen 
comedies – all that's missing is a laugh track to tell us when something 
is supposed to be funny.  To be fair to Simon and director Howard Deutch 
(who previously directed Matthau and Lemmon in GRUMPIER OLD MEN), the 
film has several amusing sequences, but nothing is gut-bustingly 
hilarious.  Felix and Oscar also have their share of clever one-liners 
interspersed between more banal insults.  As always, despite getting 
along "like oil and frozen yogurt," their affection for each other is 
evident.</P>
<P>     THE ODD COUPLE 2 sports a low-key supporting cast, which is 
understandable, since the last thing the film makers wanted was anyone 
upstaging Matthau and Lemmon.  Jonathan Silverman and Lisa Waltz play 
the soon-to-be-married couple.  Christine Baranski has a nice, over-the-
top appearance as a biker chick who's trying to do a THELMA AND LOUISE 
thing with her best friend.  And Barnard Hughes is a small-town sheriff 
who sees entirely too much of Oscar and Felix.  </P>
<P>     THE ODD COUPLE 2 is for everyone whose nostalgia for the 
misadventures of the duo hasn't been satisfied by the TV series or the 
recent Matthau/Lemmon pairings.  As far as big-screen comedies go, this 
one is strictly generic, with the only distinguishing mark being that 
the protagonists are over 60.  Still, the real problem isn't the actors 
or their work; it's the screenplay.  And, while Neil Simon may have once 
been numbered among America's premiere comedy writers, he, like Oscar 
and Felix, is lost this time around.</P>
