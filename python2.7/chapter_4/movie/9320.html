<PRE>.                             L.A. CONFIDENTIAL
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, despite what you've heard, is not the best film in 20
years.  It's not even the best film of 1997 (current titleholder: IN THE
COMPANY OF MEN).  But if you consider all films ever made that have the nasal
Danny Devito providing voice-over work, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is certainly at the
top of that list.</P>
<P>     Comparisons to CHINATOWN are obvious and appropriate.  Both films take
place in the Los Angeles of yesteryear, feature multi-layered crime riddles,
and have stars with questionable morals as ersatz heroes.  And both are very
good.  While Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson's script isn't the tight
masterpiece that CHINATOWN is (the writers meander for a good 45 minutes
before his story starts to shape up), and Faye Dunaway wasn't half the
cheeseball that Kim Basinger is as the femme fatale, CONFIDENTIAL makes the
audience do what few films of the 90's have achieved:  think.</P>
<P>     And you'll have to.  Director Hanson's convoluted plot -- tracing the
rise, fall, and redemption of L.A. cops played by Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe,
Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell -- is all over the map until its handy,
bloody ending (body count > 25).  Even then, you probably won't have all the
details figured out.  But at least it's fun to try.</P>
<PRE>     Recommended.</PRE>
