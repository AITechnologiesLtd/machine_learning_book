<P>     Any motion picture that promotes music appreciation is well-deserv-
ing of a look, arguably even one as excruciatingly slow and predictably
dopey as MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS.  Agony is the best word to describe sitting
through Stephen Herek's 144-minute epic of a minor scale.  The story
charts 30 years in the life of high-school music teacher Glenn Holland
(Richard Dreyfuss), from the inevitable first-year frustrations right on
up to the only-in-the-movies appreciation-at-retirement rally.  Though
credible as a honest-- if rather tidy-- portrait of the educational
process, the movie goes flat when scoring the weepy melodrama of Hol-
land's family life.  (The ads reveal a son who's born deaf and you can
take it from there.)</P>
<P>     Ignoring the deeper issues in Patrick Sheane Duncan's script, Herek
opts for an OPUS that's part fantasy.  Such as a school orchestra that
sounds like seasoned studio players, or the magical acceptance of a
teenaged son who has been terribly ignored through his life by his
father.  (Or even the small fact that we never see much evidence of
*Holland's* impact on his student's lives.  We only see how they affect
*him*.  How selfish.) And it only gets worse, quickly proving that more
than just fairy dust is missing here.</P>
<P>     The integration of the music is particularly horrid.  Instead of a
*real* review of the classics, we get a bit of Bach, a handful of old-
ies, and an overdose of overblown orchestrations from composer Michael
Kamen.  Ugh.  The lack of snap is equally abominable.  Even the most
patient for a good cry will likely find their bottoms growing sore long
before their tear ducts do.  Thank goodness for the solid work of
Richard Dreyfuss.  Wearing a great make-up job that successfully spans
three decades, Dreyfuss gives a workmanlike performance that even
survives him having to sing "Beautiful Boy." Who knows, he may just win
a nomination.</P>
<P>     Slow, sappy, and shameless, MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS is Hollywood happily-
ever-after as only Hollywood can make it.  The masses will probably eat
this stuff up and, judging from the weekend grosses, they already have.
Take Grandma; take the kids, and then run like hell for the door. </P>
