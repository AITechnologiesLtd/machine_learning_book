<P>When you think about it, who better to write and direct their own film than 
actual veteran actors, who have spent countless amounts of time on movie sets 
taking in the jobs of everyone around them? While the occasional actor who 
takes a stab at directing has a tendency to become pretentious, there seems 
to be a relatively high actor-to-successful-director ratio. </P>
<P>"The Anniversary Party," written and directed by actors Alan Cumming and 
Jennifer Jason Leigh, is a striking triumph--an incisive, thought-provoking 
look at the questionable longevity of a marriage, set at their sixth-year 
wedding anniversary, following a year-long separation. The couple is fading 
thirtysomething movie actress Sally Therrian (Leigh) and her novelist husband 
Joe (Cumming), who is about to start filming an adaptation of one of his own 
books. The upcoming film project, widely known to be about Sally, is one that 
he is planning to cast 22-year-old ingenue Skye Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow) 
in, much to the chagrin of Sally, who is hurt he didn't choose her, instead. </P>
<P>Set over the course of a 24-hour period, the first hour depicts the guests 
(all real-life friends of Cumming and Leigh) arriving. The varied group, all 
involved in the Hollywood industry, include recent Oscar winner Cal Gold 
(Kevin Kline) and his wife Sophia (Kline's real-life spouse Phoebe Cates); 
the Therrian's business manager Jerry Adams (John Benjamin Hickey) and his 
daffy wife, Judy (Parker Posey); Mac Forsyth (John C. Reilly), the current 
director of the romantic comedy Sally is making, and his neurotic, 
ultra-skinny wife, Clair (Jane Adams); and Gina Taylor (Jennifer Beals), 
Joe's long-time photographer confidante. The two outsider guests are the 
Therrian's next-door neighbors, Ryan (Denis O'Hare) and Monica Rose (Mina 
Badie), whom they have been instructed to grudgingly invite to avoid a 
possible lawsuit over their long-standing feud about Sally and Joe's barking 
dog. Also making an appearance, and causing Sally's true feelings to begin to 
rise to the surface, is Skye Davidson.</P>
<P>After the corny party games are played (the charades scene is pricelessly 
funny and genuine) and Sally and Joe open their anniversary gifts, the 
designer drug, Ecstasy, is introduced to the group as Skye's present. Their 
subsequent ingestion by everyone who decides to stay paves the way for the 
film's second hour. At first enjoying themselves and having a blast, Sally 
and Joe have various encounters with the other guests that makes them 
question their own relationship, with a secret that Sally has been harboring 
that may threaten to tear them apart forever.</P>
<P>Highly publicized to have been filmed in 19 days on the controversial digital 
video format, "The Anniversary Party" has a naturalistic flow to it that 
makes it feel less like a fictional motion picture, and more like a two-hour 
eavesdrop on the type of party that the rich and famous might really throw. 
Adding to the realism is a flawless cast who, in many cases, play characters 
decidedly similar to themselves, and who all believably seem like a large 
gathering of good friends. Kevin Kline (1999's "Wild Wild West") and Phoebe 
Cates (who has not been onscreen since 1994's "Princess Caraboo"), for 
example, play a movie star couple who, in Cates' case, has given up her 
prospering film career to raise her children. Likewise, Jennifer Jason Leigh 
plays someone not too far away from where she herself is at--a woman in her 
late-thirties whose career has recently been on a down slope, questionably 
because she is now a little too old to be playing the "young" roles, and not 
old enough to be getting the Susan Sarandon or Meryl Streep parts. The 
screenplay, by Leigh and Cumming, is so very impressive that it actually 
seems more like a delightfully well-acted, two-hour improv, rather than a 
"written" piece.</P>
<P>As previously mentioned, the cast is a top-notch smorgasbord of reasonably 
well-known talent. In a film that houses many standout performances, Phoebe 
Cates is superb and (in one truthful sequence) heartbreakingly funny; Gwyneth 
Paltrow (2000's "Bounce") gives her role of Skye, who most think of as dense 
and childish, several different character shades that expose her to be a 
little smarter than she looks; Jane Adams (1998's "Happiness") reaps comic 
gold as a new mother who is, to put it mildly, an obsessive parent, as well 
as an obsessive dieter; Jennifer Beals (1998's "The Last Days of Disco") is 
astoundingly assured in the best role she's had in ages; and Leigh's 
half-sister, Mina Badie (1994's "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"), is 
quietly poignant as a neighbor who doesn't seem to have the same stuck-up 
attitude as her husband, and begins to realize their extreme differences as 
the night presses on.</P>
<P>The movie wouldn't be complete without the audacious, passionate effort that 
Jennifer Jason Leigh (1999's "eXistenZ") and Alan Cumming (2001's "Josie and 
the Pussycats") have put into their directing debut, as well as their two 
central acting turns. Leigh and Cumming have rarely been better onscreen than 
they are right here, as a couple who do, indeed, love one another, but might 
not be secure enough in their own bodies to be able to survive each other's 
company. Best of all is a confrontation near the end, as they search for 
their missing dog, that is full of such pain, anger, and betrayal that it's 
almost difficult to endure.</P>
<P>It's clear that Leigh and Cumming put their entire heart and soul into the 
project, as they've not only crafted a comedic drama of surprising depth, but 
one of true emotional maturity. Very Altmanesque in its free-flowing 
treatment of the characters and story, "The Anniversary Party" is alternately 
so adept, so funny, and so powerful that it manages to stand on its own as a 
true original. It's easily one of the best American films of the year.</P>
