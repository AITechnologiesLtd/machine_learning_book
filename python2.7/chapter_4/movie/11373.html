<P>U.S. Marshals (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Sequels to popular action films are difficult to pull off as they are, and
the odds are further stacked against them when (1) the original hero is
nowhere to be found, and (2) the original was embraced by critics.  This
fact--and the failure of last year's tangentially related, critically
lambasted sequel to Speed--makes the effectiveness of U.S. Marshals all the
more surprising.  An ostensible sequel to the Best Picture-nominated The
Fugitive, the new film spins off Dr. Richard Kimble's determined pursuer,
federal cop Samuel Gerard, in an entertaining adventure that could very
well lead to a successful franchise.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his
performance in The Fugitive, once again plays Gerard, reinhabiting the role
with the same infectious gusto and zeal he brought to the original.  Once
again, Gerard, this time reluctantly teamed with government special agent
Royce (Robert Downey Jr.), is chasing after a fugitive, an assassin (Wesley
Snipes) known at various points as either Mark Roberts, Mark Warren, or
Mark Sheridan.  Sheridan (as which I will refer to him) had been imprisoned
for the murder of two government agents, and, with the help of his dutiful
girlfriend Marie (Irene Jacob), he attempts to elude the ever-focused
Gerard and--yes--clear his name.</P>
<P>Director Stuart Baird and screenwriter John Pogue follows The Fugitive's
rough outline fairly closely, and a couple of scenes are direct analogues
to ones in the original.  In a spectacular scene, Sheridan makes his escape
after a plane crash, much like the original film's signature train wreck;
and one memorably outlandish stunt echoes Kimble's daring leap from a dam.
As a whole, though, the new film does not nearly measure up to the
original.  Snipes, as usual, is charismatic and plays his role well, but
his character is not as fascinating and complex as Harrison Ford's Kimble.
Sheridan has none of the emotional baggage that shaded Kimble; he simply
wants, as he calls it, "righteousness."  Kimble, on the other hand, was
continually racked with guilt over his wife's death.  The emotional angle
between Sheridan and Marie is a big zero; Snipes and Jacob muster little
chemistry, but that is due in part to the fact that they do not share too
many scenes.</P>
<P>On its own terms, though, the diverting U.S. Marshals makes for a
promising "pilot" for a potential Gerard series.  Jones is obviously
energized by the more physical role Gerard plays in this installment, and
while his pacing is not as tightly wound as that of Andrew Davis, the
original's helmer, Baird crafts some suspenseful and exciting chase scenes
without resorting to gratuitous bloodshed.  A few climactic plot
developments are a bit contrived, but Baird and the able cast glide through
them with enough panache that they are not a problem.  Slick, well-made,
and fun--The Fugitive was all this and much more, but even without that
something extra, U.S. Marshals gets the job done.</P>

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
get it.  I still don't know how to react."
