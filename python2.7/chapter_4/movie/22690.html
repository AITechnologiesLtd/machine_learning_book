        Directed by Terry Gilliam;
        Written by Gilliam & Michael Palin;
        Cinematography by Peter Biziou</PRE>
<P>        TIME BANDITS is the first film in Terry Gilliam's "trilogy" about
childhood, adulthood, and old age.  It is a fantasy, and like the two later
films, it is also about fantasy--it explores the relationship between
reality and dreams, illusion, escapism.  While BRAZIL chillingly showed the
failure of imagination, and THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN its triumph,
TIME BANDITS is more ambiguous: both the fantastic and the mundane in some
way disappoint the story's hero.</P>
<P>        TIME BANDITS shares the pessimism of the other two films: reality
is not much fun, and that is why we need fantasies.  Kevin (Craig Warnock),
an adolescent boy, lives a stultifying life with his parents, who are
obsessed with technology and routine, and spend their evenings watching
awful TV shows.  His room, wallpapered with posters, littered with toys, is
his place of escape--literally so, when a troupe of time-travelling dwarves
stumble out of his closet one night and whisk him away on a series of
temporal adventures.</P>
<P>        They visit the siege of Castileone, Sherwood Forest, the Titanic,
Mycenae, and the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, all with the aid of a map
they have stolen from the Supreme Being, showing the location of various
"timeholes."  The dwarves were in fact formerly in the employ of the
Supreme Being--they helped build the world, although because it was done in
only seven days, it's a "botched job"--and were given the map so they could
repair various oversights in the construction of reality.  Fed up with
their servitude, they chose instead to wander the ages and steal from the
rich (giving to the poor is not part of the plan, however, until they meet
Robin Hood, drolly played by John Cleese).</P>
<P>        Naturally, this plot offers plentiful opportunites for Gilliam's
fertile imagination to run wild, and there are some delightful sequences:
the band's arrival in Castileone is marvellously staged, as is their escape
from a cage hanging over a pit of ultimate darkness.  This is, in effect,
the first recognisable Terry Gilliam movie (the feeble JABBERWOCKY was
presumably directed by his evil twin), and while he is not yet in complete
command of the medium, the signs of his later accomplishments are evident.
The problems with TIME BANDITS--and there are many--are on the level of the
script.</P>
<P>        While the humour is probably fine for kids, the jokes in TIME
BANDITS are mostly poor by adult standards, even the ones thrown in
specifically for a mature audience.  Gilliam demonstrates a gift for both
satire and whimsy in his later films, but comedy is not his strong point;
even with Michael Palin as co-writer, the script never approaches the manic
comic brilliance of "Monty Python's Flying Circus."  And the episodic plot
suffers from its arbitrariness: the various sequences, while each effective
on its own, do not add up to much because there is no dramatic impetus.
With minimal tinkering, the plot could be re-written so that the episodes
occur in any order.</P>
<P>        The finale, however, rescues the movie.  It is no surprise that it
builds to a climactic sequence in the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness, a
showdown with the Evil Genius (Satan) created by the Supreme Being (God).
The outcome, however, is surprising: in its own way it is as disturbing as
the ending of BRAZIL.  This is not a happy, feel-good kids' movie.  There
is whimsy, there is silliness, but the underlying tone is grave, and the
movie's examination of free will and the relationship between good and evil
is quite sobering, particularly for adults.</P>
<P>        Gilliam does not cop to a cheap explanation of the events in TIME
BANDITS--it is not all just a dream--nor does he allow us any comfort from
those events.  What Kevin experiences is, for him, real, and because
reality is not much fun, the escapism offered by the dwarves and their map
proves to be much less fun than he expected.  In this movie, fantasy offers
lessons that are, if anything, harsher than the lessons of real life.
That, however, is an adult perspective; younger viewers will probably
remember the giant who wears a ship as a hat, Napoleon's appreciation for
Punch and Judy shows, and an ogre named Winston.  After all, one of the
points TIME BANDITS makes is that fantasies are more than adequate--until
you start to grow up.</P>
