Re - #9 "The Manchurian Candidate"</PRE>
<P>Continuing with the "movie list," here is number nine of the 
ten films that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite 
films. They are the movies I've seen that have had the greatest 
influence on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are 
favorites that I enjoy watching over and over again, which you 
can tell as you read each entry. Try to think of your own 
experiences with films and how they influenced the course of 
your life. It makes life more interesting to be aware, as you 
live it, to know how things such as books and films and magazine 
articles alter your path in significant ways. Sometime last year 
the Sunday NYTimes "Arts and Leisure" section had a piece on how 
difficult it is to think of a movie that may have changed 
history. The only movie they could think of was a silent film by 
D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the 
KuKluxKlan that the author believes changed national thinking 
about the KKK. How silly. Each of the ten films listed here 
changed my history, and if I had not seen them, I would not have 
helped change history in the ways that I have. Films don't move 
masses. They move individuals who move masses.</P>
<P> 9. "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) I'd been a lefty in my 
political tastes from as far back as I could remember. In my 
first presidential vote, 1960, I cast my ballot for JFK over 
the hated Richard Nixon. In 1962, I was a reporter for the Las 
Vegas Review-Journal and had my first disillusionment with 
"liberals." At the same time, my editor, Robert L. Brown, 
persuaded me that I was being unjust in my evaluation of Nixon,
and my Ox-Bow incident experience forced me to swallow hard and 
read Nixon's Six Crises. Then, along came The Manchurian 
Candidate with Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, and Angela 
Lansbury, about how the COMMUNISTS were able to scheme in ways 
that could actually capture the American presidency. The movie 
hit me at a vulnerable moment and may have helped push me toward 
an eventual vote for Nixon in 1968. Thirty-five years later, I'm 
skeptical about genuine conspiracy theories that come from the 
left or the right, although I do appreciate their potential. </P>
