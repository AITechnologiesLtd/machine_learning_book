                                  BATMAN
                         A film review by Jeff Meyer
                          Copyright 1989 Jeff Meyer</PRE>
<PRE>[Spoilers in final section]</PRE>
<P>     Between all the hype and anticipation surrounding this movie, I've heard a
good deal of discussion about whether the new film will be "true" to the Batman
character.  That was not one of my concerns when entering the theater.  Over
the last 50 years, Batman's gone through any number of conceptual revisions:
he's been the grim spooky loner created by Bob Kane; the gimmicky detective
with the boy sidekick; the TV camp buffoon; and the obsessed, driven vigilante
who is probably over the edge of sanity.  My feeling was this: Tim Burton could
do damn near whatever he wanted to do with the character, as long as he made
the film work.</P>
<P>     With that said, this film is a mess.  A visual treat of a mess, but still
a mess.  If it was meant to lean towards satire/spoof, it's not nearly funny
enough.  If it's meant to hold together as drama/action, the characters are
cardboard, and the plot is pockmarked with holes towards the end.  In any case,
the script and dialogue (with the frequent (but not continual) exception of
Jack Nicholson's Joker) isn't exceptional to entertain on it's own; it usually
keeps moving (the major exceptions are the scenes which seem tailor-made to be
used for the Prince MTV video for BATMAN), but it's all over the place.  The
conclusion suffers through Siskel & Ebert's "handy stupidity" theory, where
people act ridiculous to keep the plot moving.  And there were so many
sequences that seemed either unclear or muddled that I wondered if a lot of the
film had been cut down from the original length, or that some of the footage
just didn't come out, and they had to make do with what they had.</P>
<P>     As to the acting, Michael Keaton looks *damned* uncomfortable.  I still
think he could have made a decent Batman, because he has shown the ability to
throw out a lot of intensity in his previous roles.  Here, though, it's
monotone -- a stoic obsession that barely filters through his costume.  He's
given a few opportunities to escape this as Bruce Wayne, but it's almost as if
he were still playing it in costume.  Jack Nicholson is fun to watch here, and
he is definitely given the lion's share of good lines in the film, but this is
not the "exceptional performance" I've been reading about in film magazines.
It's over the top, and he's definitely having fun with it, but it's on the same
par as John Lithgow's Dr. Emilio Lizardo.  Kim Bassinger plays her usual
damsel-in-distress character; she ends up looking almost as strange as Batman
and the Joker.  The other characters (outside of Alfred) aren't given much room
to move in; Billy Dee Williams, as DA Harvey Dent, is the only law enforcement
official who appears to have his act together.  (And, if there's a sequel and
he follows the comic book scenario, he won't be working for the DA's office for
long.  :-) )  Jerre (sp?) Hall walks in and out, and Jack Palance can still
hiss like a sunuvagun.  My favorite bit character was Bob, the Joker's chief
henchman, who played the repo yard mechanic in REPO MAN.  Oh, well.</P>
<P>     The visuals in this film, though, are gorgeous, and almost make up for the
rest of the film.  Gotham City is a dingy fantasyland, Wayne Manor is a
moribund crypt of vengeance, and the Batcave is lovely.  This is not a
surprise; visuals and miniatures have always been Burton's strong suit, with
his background in animation.  There's a scene with the Batmobile approaching
the Batcave which is very well orchestrated between camera, music and visuals.
The music by Danny Elfman is somewhat tinny at times -- almost like BEETLEJUICE
over again.  I can't stand Prince, but even if he was Peter Gabriel, the
backdrop of the Joker's music video escapades wouldn't have helped.</P>
<P>     So, what's the verdict?  Some of my disappointment could be put down to
over-advanced hype, but I think most of it has to be laid at Burton and Hamm's
door.  I'd put this on a par with INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM: a
roller-coaster ride (but with better effects, and a tolerable, over-blown
ironic/tragic air).  No depth whatever.  If you like a visual movie well
enough, go see it (and see it in 70MM for that reason); otherwise, go find SAY
ANYTHING or FIELD OF DREAMS at your local repertory theater.</P>
<PRE>SPOILER COMMENTS FOLLOW:</PRE>
<P>     Overall, I thought the first half of the film was slow, but held together;
the last half faster, but started to fall apart early on.  On the good side,
the introduction of Batman on the roof I liked; and the drive with Vale to the
Batcave was great.  And the visuals of the Batplane over the city were a
pleasure to see -- the entire art direction kept the brooding feel glued on.</P>
<P>A few complaints/comments (I'm more amused than anything by this stuff):</P>
<P>Query #1: Where exactly *are* the Gotham City Police during the Joker's
balloon/money hoo-haa?  As far as I see, these guys only appear after they're
all holed up in the church.</P>
<P>Query #2: Why does Vale try to drive off without letting her reporter friend in
the car?  Never figured that out.  (Not to mention why he throws himself on the
hood of the car -- I'd put that down to "stupidity providing plot
opportunity".)</P>
<P>Query #3: It's just barely explained that the Joker is trying to make people
believe that his white-face is makeup -- why is this?  Is the flesh-makeup his
"secret identity."?  </P>
<P>Character Concept Problem: OK, I can buy Batman with guns, but firing missiles
into a crowded street?  Attempting to murder the Joker in cold blood?
(Punching him over the edge of the cathedral.)  Blowing up the gangsters
headquarters with them still in it?  I guess this is a Batman whose first
interest is definitely vengeance, over justice or protecting the innocent.
Judge Dredd in a Batman costume...  Perhaps it was Burton's intention, but I
felt that Batman, while not portrayed as a villain like the Joker, is portrayed
as a fairly negative character.  Fine -- but that doesn't jell with him posing
for his legendary shot in the final scene of the movie.</P>
<P>More on Nicholson:  Yes, there were some funny lines, but some of it (like the
TV commercials) became tedious fairly quickly.  Like Keaton, I thought he could
have done a better job with a better script.  I'll be curious to hear how much
this film deviated from the early revisions of the script by various netters
who read it.</P>
<P>The Ending: So, Vicki Vale gives up her award-winning career as a hostage, err,
I mean a photographer, to be the Batman's lover?  (Licking her lips in the back
of the limo....  I guess Alfred's kind of immune to odd behavior by then.)
Well, she does have a thing about bats....  (I did like the bit between them
about "trying to love one another" -- had a certain sadness that the movie
could have used more of.  Made me wonder if the ending had been changed to make
for a "happy" conclusion.)  Also, the police are awfully quick to turn over to
Batman's side at the end; but then, they were basically straw men throughout.</P>
<P>     There are probably more glitches if I thought about it, but I'll leave it
at that.  Overall, I wished they'd cut much of the background hooplah that went
on during Prince's songs, and spent the time filling in some of the gaps in the
film.</P>
