<P>_Hedwig_and_the_Angry_Inch_ (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Never mind the fact that she's an East German transsexual whose botched
sex-change operation left her with the titular "angry inch"--the character of
struggling glam rocker Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) is an absolutely
refreshing screen creation simply due to her appealingly real personality: a mix
of exuberance, self-effacing humor, and unabashed romanticism.  In a similar
vein, _Hedwig_and_the_Angry_Inch_ is an absolute breath of fresh air, due to the
very authentic talents of Mitchell.  As writer, director, and star of this
adaptation of his popular Off-Broadway musical, he pulls off a stunning
cinematic hat trick that's all too rare for a first-time filmmaker.  Not to be
discounted is the invaluable contribution of Stephen Trask, who composed all of
the film's memorable, toe-tapping tunes (I dare anyone to not sing along to the
central production number "Wig in a Box") and has a supporting role as well.</P>
<P>        Being based on what is essentially a one-man show on the stage, _Hedwig_
the film cannot completely overcome one key shortcoming (no pun intended): the
flatness of all characters surrounding Hedwig.  She is the only character
developed to any substantial degree, a problem when it comes time to addressing
secondary but no less key issues such as her current husband Yitzhak's (Miriam
Shor, in an inspired bit of opposite gender-bending) relationship-threatening
desire to don wigs and dresses.  The sketchy development of supporting players
also affects one of the film's main concerns, Hedwig's relationship with
ex-lover Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), who went on to rock stardom with the songs
she wrote; one never quite gets why she is so hung up on such a shallow young
twit, and Pitt's vacant performance (Trask provides Tommy's incongruously
passionate singing voice) fails to fill in any gaps.</P>
<P>        But _Hedwig_ is ultimately about her ongoing pursuit of love and
fulfillment, and that journey is intensely involving.  Through Mitchell's
vibrant performance and smart directing choices (the use of abstract animation
interludes is especially novel), not to mention Trask's indelible melodies, one
gets to know the character so intimately that her unusual life circumstances are
a non-issue.  Hedwig comes to life as a living, breathing, warts-and-all person
who wants nothing more than to be happy and whole, and Mitchell's emotional and
entertaining execution of this universal story resonates long after you've left
the theatre... and made your way to the record store to buy the soundtrack.</P>
