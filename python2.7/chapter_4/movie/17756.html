Chushingura (1962, Hiroshi Inagaki)</PRE>
<P>"Chushingura" is an epic tale, based on a historic event, set in the
late feudal period of Japan:  A young lord, Asano (Yuzo Kayama), follows
his consience and a new law and refuses to pay tribute to an elder
lord, Kira (Chûsha Ichikawa).  Kira has achieved his position through
graft -- he is, in reality, a cowardly, greedy womanizer.  When Kira
realizes that Asano won't enrich his coffers, he hatches a plan to
humiliate him.  Kira arranges for Asano to be host to some imperial
envoys in the Shogun's palace in Edo.  Asano is as inexperienced as
he is incorruptable, and Kira witholds essential details of protocol,
taunting Asano and implying that whatever tribute Asano had withheld
would be a pittance compared to what it would now cost him to employ
Kira's assistance.  Finally, Asano is goaded beyond his limit, draws
his sword and attempts to slay Kira in the palace.</P>
<P>Drawing one's weapon inside the Shogun's palace is a capital offense,
and Asano is compelled to commit hara kiri.  His family and their
retainers (ronin) are forced to relinquish the Clan Asano castle
and become outcasts.  Led by Lord Oishi (Koshiro Matsumoto), the
clan chamberlain,  60 of the clan secretly plot revenge against Kira.
Along the way, a number of interesting side stories and digressions
are set up, all of which come together at the film's climax.</P>
<P>The film is beautifully photographed in Tohoscope (a wide screen
CinemaScope/Panavision clone), and unfolds meditatively, evoking
early 18th century Japanese scenery and customs in lush detail.  The
ethic of the film is very, very Japanese with its emphasis on honor
and Bushido, the code of the Samurai.  Kira is more of a villian for
being cowardly than for being greedy.  Anyone with an interest in
Japanese history and culture will eat this film up.</P>
<P>The score, written by Akira Ifukube, is on the whole a delightful
and effective bit of east-meets-west cinema music, although the use
of what sounds like a Hammond organ in full Leslie mode as
punctuation brought flashbacks of 1950's televison soap operas.</P>
<P>The only shortcoming is at the very end, in the climatic battle
between Oishi's followers and Kira's bodyguards.  The fight scene
suffers from the same lack of realism as so many Hollywood shootouts
from the 40's and 50's -- the Good Guys cut up a larger force of
Bad Guys without losing a single man, and the Bad Guys drop without
shedding a drop of blood.  I'm sure that, in reality, such a battle
would have been nothing short of a bloodbath.  Not that I'm complaining,
really, since I don't get off on explicit scenes of bloodhshed. It's
just that the violence in the early parts of the film were handled so
carefully and so obliquely (the shot of Asano's suicide dissolves
out before the fatal plunge of the daggar), I found the final fight
scene jarringly unrealistic in the context of the rest of the film.</P>
<P>The version of "Chushingura" that I saw was from Image's DVD.  It
is just short of 4 hours long, and in two parts.  I believe this
is the way the film was originally shown in Japan.  The DVD itself
is somewhat lackluster and suffers from some authoring problems:
The image is less crisp than of what DVD is capable, and a number of
encoding artifacts appear in the image.  Perhaps since this film
comes so close to maxing out a single side of a DVD, some bandwith
compromises were made to avoid having to cut a 2-sided disc.  The
English subtitles are burned into the video and could not be switched
off; thankfully, they're outside of the image itself.  Properly done,
this DVD should have had selectable subtitles.  I would have preferred
it to have been dubbed as well.  As deep as is my love for things
Japanese, I'm afraid that my love for the Japanese language shall
forever go unrequited.</P>
