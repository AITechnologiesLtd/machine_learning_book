<PRE>THE BASKETBALL DIARIES (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Although historical examples and even some current events
provide plenty of examples in which violent acts are
inspired by various things, including ancient religious
texts, in 1990s Hollywood movies and other forms of popular
culture seemed to be the sole source of the violence in
American society. At least this was the impression given by
media crusade, inspired by the series of school shootings in
late 1990s America, for which the young perpetrators had
allegedly found inspiration in violent films from Hollywood.
Among various titles the one is particularly singled because
of the scene that actually featured one of such shootings -
THE BASKETBALL DIARIES, 1995 teen angst drama directed by
Scott Kalvert.</P>
<P>The shooting is nothing but the vision in the mind of the
film's protagonist Jimmy (played by Leonardo di Caprio),
16-year old boy who lives in Manhattan with his mother
(played by Lorraine Bracco). Jimmy is star of St. Vitus,
seemingly unbeatable high school basketball team, and
everyone expects that he would continue his stardom in NBA.
However, Jimmy, being rebellious teenager, has increasing
problems adapting to the repressive and hypocritical
atmosphere of Catholic high school, as well as dealing with
his own broken home and best friend Bobby (played by Michael
Imperioli) dying from leukemia. In order to escape from it
all Jimmy finds refuge in casual sex and drug use. The
latter proves to be his undoing - his basketball skills
quickly vanish, he leaves school and home and is soon forced
to leave on the street where he commits various crimes and
sells his body in order to pay for his heroin habit.</P>
<P>Based on the autobiographical novel by former heroin addict,
rocker and poet Jim Carroll, THE BASKETBALL DIARIES provide
uniquely naturalistic and explicit portrayal of the
destructive capabilities of heroin addiction. Leonardo di
Caprio, in its uncompromising and convincing portrayal of
promising teenager who ends up like a basket case would
forever silence all those who see him as nothing more than a
pretty boy. His strong performance is matched by equally
impressive supporting roles. Lorraine Bracco excels in the
role of Jim's mother, especially in one particularly moving
scene that feature final split-up of the family, while James
Kirby stands out with the extremely effective portrayal of
creepy basketball coach. Juliette Lewis is also very
convincing in the role of street junkie, and that role
becomes even more interesting when we know that the actress
had some real-life drug problems after the production of
this film.</P>
<P>THE BASKETBALL DIARIES had misfortune of being released in
the same year as two otherfilms that dealt with similar
subjects - Danny Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING and Larry Clark's
KIDS. While the former dealt with the dark world of heroin
addiction with much more details and style than THE
BASKETBALL DIARIES, the latter was much more convincing in
the depiction of modern teenager's alienation from society.
This is actually major problem of the film - script by Bryan
Goluboff (which set the plot in modern day instead of late
1960s like the novel) switches direction in the middle;
until that moment it is an honest and intriguing portrayal
of young man and his relationship with society; afterwards
it turns into sometimes oversimplistic anti-drug film.
Director Scott Kalvert also tends to show his videoclip
author's root too much. The happy ending also seems a little
bit cliched, although it owes more to real life than to the
filmmakers' lack of imagination. However, despite not being
among the best film that deal with this grim and disturbing
subjects, THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is nevertheless a
remarkable film that just had misfortune of getting wrong
reputation.</P>
