<P>   How many times have you heard this conversation today?</P>
<PRE>   "How are you?"
   "I'm OK...how are you?"
   "I'm OK...how's the family?"
   "They're OK.  Yours?"</PRE>
<P>   Five times?  Ten?  Twenty?  In a book she published some
years back, Sisela Bork stated that the average American lies
about twenty time a day.  If so, this sort of conversation must
be the most common practice.  In fact I've seen people at the
dentist's waiting for a root canal who are asked by the
receptionist, "How are you today?"  The answer?  You
guessed it.  Alex (William H. Macy) is so not-OK in Henry
Bromell's "Panic," that even when he sits on the couch for
the first time with his psychotherapist he says "I'm OK." 
Truth to tell he's not OK, and neither are his parents Michael
(Donald Sutherland) and Deidre (Barbara Bain), his
delightfully precocious six-year-old child Sammy (David
Dorfman), his wife Martha (Tracey Ullman), his would-be girl
friend Sarah (Neve Campbell), and in a more physical sense
his shrink (John Ritter).  The picture itself is not simply OK: It
approaches the dimensions of a small masterpiece with Henry
Bromell's taut, serpentine script at several points allowing
Bill Macy to sound like a character out of David Mamet (for
which Macy's is the expert), exquisite ensemble acting
particularly by Macy and by the enchanting little David
Dorfman, and Brian Tyler's unobtrusive soundtrack.  Artisan's
panic is Roxie's catch: the distinguished studio that's given us
such cutting edge films as "The Blair Witch Project," "Pi,"
"Requiem for a Dream," "The Buena Vista Club," and "Cecil
B. Demented," passed up a terrific opportunity by heeding the
reaction of a focus group that must have been having a bad
day and dropping the project.  Picked up by Roxie, "Panic"
has already played on Cinemax cable back in August and
should enjoy a solid release this year on the big screen.</P>
<P>   Speaking of cable, "Panic" summons up recent memories
of the hit HBO show "The Sopranos," which featured its
principal character Tony Soprano as a guy who, like Macy's
Alex, must come to grips with a mid-life crisis.  But unlike
Soprano, Alex does tell his therapist about the family
business--which leads to a tense series of dangerous
confrontations with the head doctor and forces the patient to
make a dramatic existential decision.  "Panic" focuses on the
man who is a diffident, even reluctant killer, trained by his
father Michael from an early age to enter the family's sordid
business.  Michael is a hit man, understandably depressed
from the time that his dad showed him a gun for the first time
and coaxed him to shoot a squirrel.  Giving the young man
an opportunity for a human kill when Alex turns sixteen,
Michael rewards the boy with a spirited pat on the back and a
slice of the family affluence secured by a run of contracts
from people unwilling to dirty their own hands with murder. 
When the chronically despondent Alex has his first session
with the doctor, he finds that he comes alive not so much
during his $125-an-hour meeting on the coach but from a
bizarre conversation with a 23-year-old hairdresser, Sarah
(Neve Campbell), who is a patient of another therapist in the
same suite of offices.  When his wife Martha gets
confirmation of her husband's growing relationship with the
young woman, a family crisis develops that pushes Michael
into effecting a decisive change in his life.</P>
<P>   Roger Ebert, who in a discussion of the movie with guest
critic Joyce Kulhawk last June called this stunning movie "too
smart" to be released nationally, will get his wish for more
exposure when "Panic" opens on the big screen this year.  A
psychological suspense thriller of the first order, "Panic"
achieves what a plethora of gangster films never approaches:
a human-scale portrayal of the psyches of the mobsters, one
which demonstrates that not all mercenaries are happy with
their sordid work.  While Macy is in virtually every scene,
Bromell does a remarkable job of evoking a team spirit with
his ensemble of crackerjack actors.  Neve Campbell, known
to teens for her roles in mock-horror flicks, never looked
better nor has she ever been given dialogue more crackling
than Bromell's.  Sharp-tongued to hide her vunerabilities,
Campbell's Sarah delivers repeated blows to Alex's ego while
affording the disturbed killer an opportunity for redemption. 
As Martha, Tracey Ullman, playing against type as a
melancholy housewife, provides a striking, dishwater contrast
to Sarah's vibrant sexuality, while the fifty-year-old Bill Macy--
principally a stage actor who has had to wait quite a while
before the film industry would give him major roles--furnishes
his audience with a moving, resourceful performance as a
murderer who is himself among the walking wounded.</P>
