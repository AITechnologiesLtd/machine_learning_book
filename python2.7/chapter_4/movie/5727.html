<P>     The year's best tag-line, "sex bugs rock 'n' roll," is actually a
bit of misnomer.  There's precious little skin and only a mild rock
sensibility to this feature-film expansion of the MTV short.  John
Payson, who created the original, writes and directs this absurdly
amusing comedy about a young man from Iowa (Jerry O'Connell) and his
adventures living with thousands of talking (and singing, and dancing)
cockroaches in a run-down, rent-controlled apartment in New York City.
Animated by stop-motion and CGI effects, the bug sequences (roach
clips?) are delightful.  The insects squeal like Joe Pesci on helium as
they bicker, banter, and break into song.  (My favorite: a Busby
Berkeley number set inside a toilet bowl.) The plot, involving a
romantic interest and some serious landlord woes, is awfully thin and
makes the 79-minute running time seem longer than it really is.  JOE'S
APARTMENT works best as a mild comedy about life in the Big Apple.  How
will gags about 911 operators, street violence, and pooper scoopers play
in Peoria?  Only the grosses will tell.  With appearances by David
Huddleston, Don Ho, and Robert Vaughn, who has aged into a fine Strother
Martin look-alike.</P>
