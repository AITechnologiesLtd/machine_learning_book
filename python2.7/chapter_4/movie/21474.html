<PRE>MANSFIELD PARK
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Emma."  "Persuasion."  "Pride and Prejudice."  "Sense and
Sensibility."</P>
<P>        Moviedom's love affair with the work of Jane Austen has never been
more apparent than in the last several years.  And I'm not just talking
major motion pictures here; the Arts & Entertainment cable network has been
broadcasting an equal amount of made-for-British-television Austen fare for
months.</P>
<P>        Now we have "Mansfield Park" to continue the illustrious tradition,
a film inspired by Austen's journals, letters, and a tome of intimidating
length that bears the same name.  While not a strict adaptation of the
novel--the talent behind this new production has chosen to give "Mansfield
Park"'s heroine, Fanny Price, a contemporary air and heightened the
Antiguan slave trade subtext--the film nonetheless showcases Austen's
proficiency in developing characters so rich and vital you'll want to spend
many more hours in their collective company.</P>
<P>        As Fanny Price, Frances O'Connor is remarkable (and she doesn't
even get top billing!).  A young woman with a quick wit and a fine command
of the written and spoken word (some would say she possesses "a man's
intellect"), Fanny is shipped at an early age from her poverty-stricken
dockside home to the dreary elegance of Mansfield Park, an imposing
Georgian estate presided over by her wealthy uncle, the implacable Sir
Thomas Bertram.  Sir Thomas is played by the distinguished English
playwright Harold Pinter, whose screenwriting credits include "The
Go-Between," "Betrayal," and "The French Lieutenant's Woman."</P>
<P>        At Mansfield Park, Fanny is forced to endure a life little better
than a scullery maid, condescendingly treated by one Mrs. Norris (Sheila
Gish).  During her tenure there, Fanny witnesses various cousins, friends,
and neighbors falling in and out of love with each other--and herself--at
the drop of a handkerchief.</P>
<P>        Not only has Canadian writer/director Patricia Rozema ("I've Heard
the Mermaids Singing") retained all of Austen's feel and flair for the
world of 1806, but she has beautifully recreated the language that gives
the author's writings such energy.  The entire cast, especially Embeth
Davidtz (who does get top billing) as the shallow, worldly Mary Crawford,
Alessandro Nivola as her rakish brother Henry, and Jonny Lee Miller as
Fanny's cousin and confidante Edmund Bertram, is marvelous and the range of
emotions they traverse in two short hours is astonishing.</P>
<P>        Like all of Austen's works, "Mansfield Park" is drawn from the
author's own life experiences, a life spent almost entirely within her own
family circle of struggling country parsons, rich fools, eligible fops, and
young ladies itching to come out into society.  By continuing, unbendingly,
to write within that narrow world view she has given us great literature--a
precise and complex view of human nature wrapped in incisive humor, social
and moral consequence, and enduring style.</P>
<P>        With its gorgeous cinematography (often shot through leaded panes
of glass that haven't seen Windex in weeks), lovely muted score, and
sure-footed performances, especially by Frances O'Connor, Patricia Rozema's
"Mansfield Park" sets a new standard for adaptations of Jane Austen's work.</P>
<PRE>        In that regard the only thing left to add is bring on "Northanger
Abbey"!</PRE>
