<PRE>TRAINSPOTTING
**** of **** grade is A-</PRE>
<P>Trainspotting is one of the most exciting, fresh, and energizing films I
have seen.  It is a film about heroin, and the depravity that the
addiction leads to.  This is handled with flash and pizazz, there is a
pure joy of film making with every scene, no matter how sick.</P>
<P>The story follows Renton his Clockwork Orange-type cronies as they fight
heroin, police, yuppies and for freedom in life.  Begining scenes have
Renton trying to quit heroin, and we get a detailing of what the special
quiting program will contain.  Following is his one last hit which ends
up in a toilet, THE WORST TOILET IN SCOTLAND.  How does he get it back,
in a nausiating surreal scene as he ends up swimming through the dirty
tub.</P>
<P>How you react to scenes likethese is up to you.  I felt they were very
funny in a darkly comical tone, others will find it sick and depraved. 
They are as right as I.  Trainspotting is about sick and depraved life
of drugies.  That is the point of the film.  It is very funny if you
like your comedy dark or absurdly surreal.</P>
<P>Some people found that Trainspotting was undecided about heroin, neither
for or against.  THIS IS ABSURD!  Showing te drugies very
uncompromisingly may look pro-heroin, but it is also honest.  You learn
many negative things about heroin and see how it tears apart the lives
of good people as well as bad ones.  If Trainspotting was handled wrong
and to unrealistically positive, you would have a laughable film like
Reefer Madness.</P>
<P>Trainspotting is not the best film about heroin, it can't top Drugstore
Cowboy even with the pop imagery.  Trainspoting is a great film,
though.  One of the years best.  It is also one of the most exciting
films I have seen.  One that, if you dig it, energize your spirits and
love of film.  Director Danny Boyle (previously did Shallow Grave) is a
stylist to watch.  </P>
<P>I don't want to neglect the acting in this film.  Everyone in the cast
gives well proportioned and controled performances.  Standouts are Ewan
McGregor and Robert Carlyle (later in Full Monty).</P>
