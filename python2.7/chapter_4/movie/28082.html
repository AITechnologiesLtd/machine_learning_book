<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The man in the middle is caught in a political dilemma of whether to
advance his career and go along with what the army wants or to buck the
system and defend a man who is guilty but mentally sick. Lt. Col. Barney
Adams (Robert Mitchum) is a war hero and career army man, called on
during the waning days of WW11 to defend a Lt. Winston (Keenan Wynn),
accused of killing a British staff sergeant in cold blood. Barney hasn't
been in a courtroom in quite a while and only had one law case in his 18
years in service, so he is surprised when an old friend of his general
father's, General Kempton (Barry Sullivan), asks the gimpy Purple Heart
soldier to take the case. There is no doubt about his client's guilt, he
has even confessed, but the Americans want a guilty verdict to appease
their partners, the British, as they prepare to do battle together and
hope that with the trial done legally and with a rigorous defense, that
it would thereby reduce tension among the soldiers of both countries.</P>
<P>This melodramatic courtroom drama is set in India, in 1944, and is based
on Howard Fast's novel The Winston Affair. In an army camp under joint
British and American command, Lt. Winston marches into the quarters of
the British soldier and shoots him in front of 11 witnesses. Barney is
basically told by Kempton to put up a good fight but lose the case and
let justice prevail as we hang the guilty man, thereby avoiding further
embarrassment from the British and helping us ease the tension among the
soldiers of both countries. There is also a promotion to full-bird
colonel awaiting Barney if he wraps up the case in the way the army
wants it. What the army command doesn't want is for Winston to get off
on a plea of insanity.</P>
<P>Assigned to help Barney are Lt. Bender (Nichols) and Lt. Morse
(Cockrel), two eager-beaver civilian lawyers in New York, who are
draftees. They are prepared to work around the clock to defend their
client. A black corporal (Beck) is assigned to be Barney's driver, whose
purpose in the film is highlighted by the final shot of him driving
Barney to the airport, as we see their black and white faces through the
windshield, showing how complete integration is what awaits the army of
the future.</P>
<P>On his own, in the few days he is here for this rushed trial, Barney
meets a nurse, Kate Davray (Nuyen), who is half-French and half-Chinese,
as he gets in a little interracial lovemaking with the serious-minded
beauty between preparing his case. She works for the psychiatrist, Major
Kaufman (Wanamaker), who interviewed Winston after the murder and wrote
a report that he was insane. But the major's superior officer Col.
Burton (Knox) rejected the report and took Kaufman off the case and had
him transferred to another camp, as Burton formed a board of inquiry
into the lunacy issue and found the accused to be sane by reason that he
can determine right from wrong.</P>
<P>When Barney talks with his client and asks why he committed murder,
Winston said because he was defiling the white race--he's not fit to
live in a white man's world. The film brings up a few interesting points
about defending such an unappealing man and how legitimate is the insane
plea, which if allowed to be used as a plea could really bog down the
justice system with criminals trying to manipulate the system.</P>
<P>This stunningly well-photographed film in black and white, has no real
tension in the courtroom dramatics, which center on Barney's efforts to
defend a client who doesn't want his help, and the ability of a British
major, Dr. Kensington (Trevor Howard), an acquaintance of Kaufman's, to
ascertain the mental competency of Winston and convince the court that
Winston is insane. The filmmaker probably didn't feel confident enough
with Kensington's testimony in favor of insanity and had Winston put on
a show for the court to prove he was really nuts.</P>
<P>The film for all its soft spots, still had a good but enigmatic
performance from Mitchum, whose motives for taking on the army bigwigs
and putting a dent in his career are never made quite clear. Keenan Wynn
was an appealing loony. While Nuyen's role was to play up that racism
wasn't to be tolerated, that even though she resents the racist
Winston's of the world, justice must be provided even for them. The film
was interesting enough in spots to hold my attention, but it defeated
its own purpose by making General Kempton so politically immoral and
Wynn so nutty, that the film's liberal message can only be viewed as a
muddled one.</P>
