<PRE>One-Line-Summary
----------------
     "Chapter Two: Mom Quest & Puppy Love" in the life of the charming
young girl, Vada Sultenfuss.</PRE>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     With a new baby on the way for Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Henry
(Dan Akyroyd) Sultenfuss, Vada (Anna Chulmsky) feels a bit left out in
her home life and her pubescent social life.  She decides to visit
Uncle Phil (Richard Masur) in LA, birthplace of her deceased mother, in
hopes of finding out more about her mom.  During her five-day quest,
she learns that her mom wasn't what she expected, as well as learning a
great deal about herself.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts ------------
     Okay, I admit I liked MY GIRL, even though it did have the
loathsome Macaulay Culkin in it, though he was tolerable there.  So I
knew what I thought MY GIRL 2 would feel like.  And I was right.  I got
to see some old friends, and make some new ones.  There were even a few
of those verge-of-tears-of-happiness moments that are kinda nice.</P>
<P>     Uncle Phil has found a job as a mechanic and is living with Rose
and her son (Austin O'Brien).  Rose is a great character.  She
complements Phil nicely and has a twinkle in her eye that emotes a very
playful attitude that's fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Vada's adventures as she tracks down information about her mother
are interesting too, especially a series of scenes where she begins to
realize her mother isn't the sweet little thing that she had expected.
But of course, her search culminates in a real treasure trove of good
information and good will.</P>
<P>     I'll briefly mention some things that didn't go well so I can
maintain my honorary grouch/cynic card....</P>
<P>     The romance between Vada and Rose's son seemed forced, but still
had some cute moments.  Vada's "black stage" (suggesting black
wallpaper for her room) back in Pennsylvania didn't seem to fit her too
well, nor did the childlike grumpiness at getting a new brother.  It
all happened too quickly and didn't fit her smiley, cheerful
disposition.  Happily, the awkwardness passes rapidly.  With her rapid
tracking, detective and schmoozing skills (plows thru red tape, travels
all over, and interviews half a dozen friends of Mom) she's got a great
career as a bounty hunter ahead of her.  But all these are really just
token objections.  I was more than happy to brush them aside, suspend
my disbelief, and enjoy the show.</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     I did like the movie, but I wouldn't recommend it at the movies
unless you're a big fan, which I'm not. There was nothing really WRONG
with this movie.  A friend thought MY GIRL 2 was "a cute movie" and I
agree.  This will make a great VCR rental.  And if you liked the first
one, this'll make a great nostalgia/warm-fuzzy home double feature.</P>
<PRE>    avoid at all costs
    watch it on cable
 X  wait for videotape
    see once as a matinee 
    see several times (w/friends) as matinee
    see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
