<PRE>28 DAYS (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Betty Thomas</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: Susannah Grant</PRE>
<P>Starring: Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Steve Buscemi, Reni
Santoni, Mike O' Malley, Alan Tudyk, Elizabeth Perkins, Azura Skye, Diane Ladd</P>
<P>I tried, I really did. I wanted to feel Sandra's pain. I wanted to be moved,
and cry with all the others flanking me in that theatre, but instead, I found
myself laughing. I laughed loud and with much derision, I'm ashamed to say. I
laughed at the obligatory death scene, the emotional talk between sisters ("I
should have helped you with your homework!"), the drunken mother flashbacks
(oh, so this how our main character ended up like this), and most of all I
laughed at the dopey ending which I won't describe for those saps who choose to
ignore my cautionary review (you know who you are). I left the theatre
un-moved, but all that laughter did me good. Maybe I was just in a weird mood.</P>
<P>28 DAYS is not a movie I planned to see ever, save for maybe when it would
inevitably pop up on pay cable where I catch most of the movies I never plan on
seeing (think 8MM, THE CORRUPTER, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLEâ€¦think, but don't see).</P>
<P>It came with a trailer that made me gag, and starred Sandra Bullock who seems
utterly incapable of choosing a good script. It's directed by Betty Thomas, who
managed to make Howard Stern likeable in PRIVATE PARTS, but then again, it's
directed by Betty Thomas, the woman who turned DR.DOLITLE into a two hour potty
joke (or so I've heard, I could never actually bring myself to sit through yet
another supposed Eddie Murphy comeback). Steve Buscemi (who's been MIA ever
since he graced the otherwise execrable ARMAGEDDON) is featured prominently in
the trailer. I like him a lot. Viggo Mortensen is also in the film, though he's
advertised a bit less prominently. Mortensen may be the most talented leading
man who has yet to become a leading man. And it was written by Susannah Grant
who wrote the cheeky crowd pleaser, ERIN BROCKOVICH.</P>
<P>So, I didn't really want to go, but I was curious (it was this same curiosity
that got me into trouble when SHOWGIRLS frolicked into town--curiosity may have
killed that damn cat, but in my case, all it ever did was get me to pay good
money to see bad movies), and when it received glowing reviews from two critics
I regularly pay attention to (Roger Ebert and Owen Gleiberman for those
curious) I decided to push my doubts aside, and give Sandra and Betty another
chance.</P>
<P>I'm not really sorry that I did. I feel rather indifferent about the whole
debacle. It's an improvement over FORCES OF NATURE and HOPE FLOATS (two films I
caught on HBO, and just had to turn off because they stunk so badly), but it's
not really, you know, good. The script is like a LIFETIME weepie, which is to
say that it's well made for a made for TV flick that would air on that
particular channel. It isn't, however, well made enough to shell out seven
bucks to see. (Or more, if you happen to be unlucky enough to live in New York,
a city where not only the mosquitoes are poisonous, but the movies are eight
whopping bucks and going higher I hear).</P>
<P>In my review of Grant's other movie, ERIN BROCKOVICH (which she provided the
screenplay for), I noted that without the star power of Julia Roberts and the
clever Steven Soderbergh at the helm, it would be little more than a passable
TV movie. Judging from 28 DAYS, it appears as if Grant is only capable of
writing scripts for TV movies (though I certainly wouldn't mind it if she
proved me wrong one of these days), so I plead to any LIFETIME execs that may
be reading this: please hire this women! Either that or pair her up with a
director as bright as Soderbergh. Not that Betty Thomas is horrible, she just
isn't distinctive. Which is to say her films are indistinguishable from the
rest of the mainstream crap currently stinking up a multiplex near you. Which
maybe does mean she's horrible.</P>
<P>While this flick's noxious trailer would have you believe that it's a comedy
with hints of drama, there are very few laughs, and plenty of scenes designed
to make you ball like Haley Joe Osmet after the little pisher was denied a
Golden Globe. 28 DAYS is a very mainstream melodrama about the out of control
Gwen (perky Sandra Bullock acting as petulant as she can), an alcoholic who
shimmies into her sisters wedding drunk, then causes huge amounts of
faux-drama, all while her smarmy British boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West)
chortles about. Our bitter heroine must either go to jail or a rehab clinic.
Which would you pick? Well if you saw this clinic you might just want to be
thrown in jail. It's the kind of rehab where people sing and interact with farm
animals. It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway for the sake of
completion) that at first Gwen is very opposed to all this goofiness, then she
eventually warms up to it, and everything most likely ends happily. Trust me, I
haven't given a thing away.</P>
<P>The drama of alcoholism is presented with some reality, but never to the point
where we really become involved in the suffering of it all. Sure we see Bullock
scrunch up her nose in pain and all that but we never feel it, and personally I
didn't care to. Bullock has made a career out of playing sweet, airy
girly-woman, like your bestest pal in the whole world, who just happens to be
really hot. She has a freeness about her, a sunshine quality that doesn't seem
faked (as, at least for me, it does with Gwyneth Paltrow). Here she is stripped
of all that, and her characterization is adequate, but something is missing.
She doesn't seem comfortable when she drops the nice-girlness, and I admire her
for trying, but this is really a role better suited for someone like Janeane
Garofalo, who seems just as bitter as this character requires. (I felt the same
thing, only the opposite with Garofalo attempting to play sweet in THE
MATCHMAKER).</P>
<P>Viggo Mortension is the sometimes-love interest, a rehabee, with a penchant for
unwanted paternity suites. The actor plays the part in a laid back Mathew
McConaughey drawl, and makes the most of his nothing-role. Busemi is featured
in about three scenes the entire movie, yet he registers more than Bullock did
for me. He plays a drug counselor (ex-junkie and alcoholic) with a gentle,
quite intelligence. He looks at Bullock with sad, helpful eyes, and we get the
feeling that this guy really cares. Others present are third-tier character
actors, all equipped with their one identifiable character trait. They're an
overly wacky bunch, just the kind of rehab people you'd expect to find in a
film by the director of DR. DOLITTLE. One of those quirky souls is Andrea
(played by sitcom star Azura Skye), a morose addict whose fate seems obligatory
in a movie such as this.</P>
<P>Thomas directs in hand held camera mode as if to announce that she's attempting
something grittier than the average Bullock vehicle, but all that grit just
paves the way for more cheap pathos. In retrospect I realize it's mighty
telling that in Roger Ebert's review he notes: "28 Days is rated PG-13 and
might be effective as a cautionary tale for teens". In a sense, that is a lot
of what's wrong with the film, it's too damn cautionary. The movie is like an
overly moral tale that an ex-rehab clinic might tell to his grand children.
It's too damn safe. Even the grittiness eventually leads to saccharine lessons.</P>
