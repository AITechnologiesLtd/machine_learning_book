<P>     GRIDLOCK'd is about people caught in one of life's most absurd 
traffic jams, and the lengths that they'll go to in order to get moving 
again.  It's a darkly humorous, vicious satire, and, like all the best 
satires, it works because so much of what transpires on screen not only 
could happen, but does happen -- every day in every major urban area 
across the country.  First time writer/director Vondie Curtis Hall sees 
the comedy in the situation and uses it to deliver a blistering attack 
on the social system and its attendant bureaucracy.</P>
<P>     Who among us hasn't had to deal with needless paperwork and 
frustrating run-arounds?  It's a universally shared affliction, and 
that's why Terry Gilliam's brilliant BRAZIL resonates so forcefully with 
viewers. GRIDLOCK'd, which approaches the same subject from a 
considerably different point-of-view, strikes a similar nerve.  We may 
not be able to identify with the specific circumstances of the main 
characters, but we can understand their anger and dissatisfaction with a 
system that seems more concerned with spilled ink than spilled blood.</P>
<P>     Spoon (Tupac Shakur) and Stretch (Tim Roth) are a '90s odd couple.  
Spoon is a mature, even-tempered black man; Stretch is a childish, 
borderline-manic white guy.  Yet, even though their personalities are 
180 degrees apart, they're as close as brothers.  They work together, 
live together, get high together, and, when they decide to free 
themselves from drugs, they try to kick the habit together.</P>
<P>     The occasion for this momentous decision is an overdose by Cookie 
(Thandie Newton), Spoon's lover and the third member of their 
performance art group.  While she lies in a coma at a nearby hospital, 
Spoon and Stretch come to grips with the precariousness of their lives.  
"I don't want to go out like that," laments Spoon (his words eerie in 
retrospect, considering the fate of the actor speaking them), "Lately, 
I've been feeling like my luck's running out."  Getting into a detox 
program, however, proves to be next-to-impossible.  Spoon and Stretch 
spend one long day racing from social service locale to locale, taking 
blood tests, filling out forms, waiting on lines, and being chased by 
both cops and drug dealers -- all in a hopeless attempt to get a little 
help to "kick it."</P>
<P>     All buddy movies need solid chemistry between the leads, and 
GRIDLOCK'd has it.  Shakur and Roth (along with Newton, during the 
flashback scenes) have an easy rapport that comes across as real and 
very believable.  Both actors are good, treading the fine line between 
grimness and absurdity.  Shakur (POETIC JUSTICE), the recently-murdered, 
controversial rap artist, plays against type.  His Spoon is calm, 
rational, and low-key.  Roth, who has portrayed his share of head cases 
before, is right at home as a druggie who will do almost anything to get  
his blow.</P>
<P>     The weakest aspect of GRIDLOCK'd is a rather silly subplot 
involving a drug dealer (Vondie Curtis Hall) who's out to recover his 
stolen goods from the two protagonists.   This leads to several 
unnecessary, routine chase sequences that don't accomplish much more 
than to distract us from the movie's more effective elements.  
Fortunately, the film makers relegate this part of GRIDLOCK'd to the 
background, allowing us to direct most of our attention to better 
things.</P>
<P>     In his first outing behind the camera, veteran actor Curtis Hall 
has crafted a fine motion picture.  The film addresses race relations, 
although not in a heavy-handed or preachy way (at one point, Spoon is 
forced to remind Stretch, who has adopted a number of black mannerisms, 
that his skin is white).  In a fashion not entirely unlike that of 
TRAINSPOTTING, it approaches the realities of drug use.  And, best of 
all, it mercilessly tears into the United States' so-called social 
services system.  This particular attack culminates in a wonderful rant 
by Stretch against government workers. </P>
<P>     GRIDLOCK'd is refreshing because it's different.  The subject 
matter isn't new, but the approach and tone are.  For Vondie Curtis 
Hall, this is the promising beginning of what will hopefully be a long 
and fulfilling career.  For Tim Roth, it's another fine performance to 
add to his ever-growing resume.  And for Tupac Shakur, who displays 
genuine talent here, it's a fitting epitaph.   Hopefully, GRIDLOCK'd 
won't get lost in the traffic jam of low-quality, mid-winter releases 
that surround it. </P>
