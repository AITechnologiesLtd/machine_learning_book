<PRE>                                  HAMLET
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years 
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted. 
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details 
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     I was really looking forward to this movie.  I thought Mel Gibson
could do a very interesting HAMLET, and he did.</P>
<P>     The problem was with the direction.  It was slow and plodding. I
found it hard to stay awake in parts. Usually Shakespeare is so lively
it is hard to keep up, but not this version.</P>
<P>     Also, I was a bit surprised at how little any music was used.  The
other actors were okay except for Allan Bates who also seemed to sleep
through his scenes.</P>
<P>     Normally, I love Franco Zeffirelli and in fact one of my favorite
movies is his ROMEO AND JULIET which has great intensity and interest
in every scene.</P>
<P>     I would HAMLET give it 2 stars and a thumbs down. I must in
fairness point out that my wife really liked this movie.  Then again,
she would show if Gibson were reading the phone book.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
