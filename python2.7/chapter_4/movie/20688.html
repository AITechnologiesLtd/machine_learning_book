<P>Fun - n. sport, amusement, jest, diversion.</P>
<P>While watching Independence Day, someone who's just began high school
physics may stop and say: `hey.....'. This is not an `intellectual'
disaster movie. In fact, if I had a spare $100 million dollars lying
around, I could have written and produced a similar product. But then
again, the reason one watches a movie like this is certainly not to
scout for realistic characters and sharply written dialogue. The
existence of  ID4 rides largely on the purpose of all-out explosive
entertainment, and in that field, it delivers in large quantities.</P>
<P>Aliens have come to Earth in large, disc-shaped spaceships that have
distributed themselves over all the major cities in the world. The
President (Bill Pullman) advises everyone to remain calm and stay within
their homes, praying that the extraterrestrial lifeforms will not become
hostile. Of course their intent is hostile. This would not be dubbed a
`disaster movie' if the aliens came down to promote peace and love. So,
much to the audience's delight, the visitors put forward a synchronized
attack that levels entire cities within a matter of minutes. It's up to
the President and a band of important survivors to find their attackers'
weaknesses and wipe them out before all is lost.</P>
<P>Included in this group is an array of stereotypes that you would expect.
There is Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith), an army pilot and family
man. Then there's David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), a nerdy but undeniably
bright scientist. Margaret Colin plays a White House staff advisor, Judd
Hirsch is David's Jewish pappy, and Mary McDonnell is the First Lady.
These characters' relationship bonds are merely consequential, as is the
situations in which they come together.</P>
<P>The special effects in ID4 are suitably impressive, however not
consistently spectacular. The destruction sequences will have you
strapped to your seat. If there is one thing that director Roland
Emmerich does truly well, it's the set-up. Everything is kept in motion,
ensuring rising suspense as we await the inevitable. Emmerich uses an
effective technique as the visitor's arrive, in which the ship's
towering shadows overtake the Lincoln Memorial, White House and other
various landmarks. In this first half-hour, we are too caught up in
anticipation to worry about the numerous technical flaws that surface.
And then, sure enough, Emmerich gives in to spectacular explosions and
air-borne attacks that will have most audience members gaping in awe.</P>
<P>That's not to say I didn't enjoy the second half. There is so much fun
to be had in this movie, especially for those who don't mind the idiotic
plot. It turns out that Emmerich has a few nifty surprises up his sleeve
(one including a visit to Area 51), and he injects enough gung-ho
adventure into the formula to keep us steadily entertained. The
appearance of the alien lifeforms is, while somewhat creepy, somewhat of
a disappointment.</P>
<P>The script often lets us down. Recycled garble involving protective
shields, uploaded viruses and even a `mother ship' appear early and
often. As long as you don't apply too much knowledge while viewing,
you're going to have a blast. The film recalls sci-fi classics from the
50's and 60's in a competent, enjoyable fashion. The cast is also solid,
even with such familiar roles. Smith and Goldblum fair okay, adding a
personal charm to their boring and obvious caricatures. Pullman is
perfect as the President, and Robert Loggia adds swift assurance to
every scene he is in. Meanwhile, Hirsch is just right, and Randy Quaid
is surprisingly strong while attempting to juggle one of the film's
biggest defects. His fate, as you'll discover early on, is entirely
predictable (but still worthwhile after all).</P>
<P>Don't accuse Independence Day of being moronic. Of course it is. Not
only that, it's obvious, manipulative and downright corny. But if you're
in the mood for some old-fashioned entertainment with new wave special
effects, you couldn't do much better than this exciting and fun-filled
homage.</P>
