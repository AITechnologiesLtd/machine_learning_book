<PRE>                            EVER AFTER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1999 Timothy Voon
             3 out of 4 for Cinderella behind the fairy tale</PRE>
<P>Director:  Andy Tennant
Cast:  Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, Dougray Scott, Patrick Godfrey,
Megan Dodds, Melanie Lynskey Screenplay:  Susannah Grant, Andy Tennant,
Rick Parks</P>
<P>In an odd, but ever charming retelling of a dramatised version of the
Cinderella story, gone is the fairy Godmother, mice and pumpkin, but
remaining is an intelligent, witty Cinder girl (Drew Barrymore), who
reads her father's copy of UTOPIA in her spare time. Present still is
the wicked stepmother (Angelica Huston) and two sisters – one evil and
the other not. One may expect that this story may not go down well with
audiences because it strays too far from the original fairy tale, but it
carries with it, such odd charm that one cannot help but smile and like
it. For example, the friendly banter between the strong-willed,
thoughtful Danielle (Cinderella) and her depressed, disillusioned prince
brings out much humour. For once we are shown why they get along and are
attracted to one another, although not initially. This fairs better than
the romanticised versions of the same tale, which presume that they fall
in love, just because they're both good looking. Although at times the
dialogue wavers between 17th and 20th century English, this is easily
overlooked and is not so much an annoyance but instead unintentionally
funny. This story of a French prince who finds his match in a commoner
may be far fetched, but at least it leaves us with hope that behind
every fairy tale, lies a true story, ever after.</P>
