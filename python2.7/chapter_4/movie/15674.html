<PRE>                      RUSHMORE **** (out of four)</PRE>
<PRE>           -a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:wchamber@netcom.ca">wchamber@netcom.ca</A> )
   (Ho ho ho! You'll have a Blue Christmas without Film Freak Central!
                      <A HREF="http://filmfreakcentral.net">http://filmfreakcentral.net</A> )</PRE>
<PRE>   starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams, Brian Cox
                screenplay by Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson
                        directed by Wes Anderson</PRE>
<P>Max Fischer, a fifteen year old student of Rushmore Academy, puts down
his newspaper and makes his way to the chalkboard, at which point he
deftly answers an impossible mathematical puzzle. His classmates applaud
his genius.</P>
<P>And then Max wakes up, having dozed off during a school assembly. A new
lecturer is introduced-Herman Blume, a low-key tycoon whose bizarre but
inspired speech prevents Max from falling back to sleep. Blume will
become his idol, and everywhere I was convinced Rushmore was going from
that obvious opening sequence the filmmakers avoid like the plague. The
movie is anything but predictable, and nothing less than brilliant, a
comic masterpiece that would win Best Picture in a perfect world.</P>
<P>Max's grades are dropping, but he dedicates himself to extracurricular
activities-over fifty of them, in fact. (His favourite is Drama Club;
his plays are hysterically funny in their earnestness.) Rushmore is not
so much an educational institution to Max as an outlet for his
gregarious and impetuous nature. No action better demonstrates this than
his relentless pursuit of teacher Miss Rosemary Cross (radiant Williams,
permitted use of her British accent again after playing The Postman's
American girlfriend); with the assistance of steel investor Blume, Max
plans to erect a marina and dedicate it to his love interest. Rosemary
is a few years Max's senior, and a widower to boot-she barely entertains
the dreamer's affections, eventually growing to prefer the company of
Blume.</P>
<P>The film features a colourful bouquet of supporting characters, from
Max's trusty peewee messenger (Mason Gamble) to Seymour Cassel as Max's
barber father. (Max attends Rushmore on scholarship.) One of the real
revelations here is Murray, who has not had a part this worthy of his
talents since Groundhog Day. His comedy here is so subtle-as the
manic-depressive multi-millionaire Herman, he conveys hate for his dumb
sons with a glance, love for Rosemary with almost that same look, and
his devotion to Max-despite his age, he's tightly part of Max's circle
of friends/assistants-is endearing. One scene in particular, which could
be interpreted as Blume's suicide attempt, is inimitably riotous-his
unfiltered cyncism on display again at last.</P>
<P>Not to give Schwartzman the short-shrift. Where did this guy come from?
Schwartzman's performance is so pitch-perfect I wondered if Rushmore had
been written for this unknown, Hollywood's Best Kept Secret. (The answer
is, "no," according to director Anderson.) Further research uncovered
that Schwartzman is the son of Talia Shire (Rocky's Adrian-and sister to
Francis Coppola). No other member of Schwartzman's legendary family has
hit it so thoroughly out of the park the first time at bat. He has none
of DiCaprio's androgyny, Renfro's handsomeness, or Taylor-Thomas's
smugness holding him back-meet the anti-teen idol, and revel in this
young actor's inspiring debut.</P>
<P>Congratulations to Anderson, Wilson (who can be seen as the blonde guy
in Armageddon), and co. for crafting a surprisingly confident, utterly
unique comedy that's thrilling in its inventiveness and heart-warming in
its sweetness of tone. (Though I was disappointed by their previous
effort, the aimless Bottle Rocket, both movies demonstrate what hopeless
romantics Anderson and Wilson are.) If there's an adjective I've missed,
feel free to add it-just thinking about Rushmore reconfirms my faith in
modern cinema.</P>
