<P>`You're gonna need a bigger boat,' cites Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) upon
viewing his first glance of the killer shark in Steven Spielberg's 1975
masterpiece, `Jaws.' The fact that this is also the audience's first glance of
the shark and that it takes place almost an hour and a half into the film is
what makes `Jaws' such a great film. By not showing the shark in the first two
thirds of the film director Spielberg generates much more fear when he shows
attacks. We, the audience, don't see what is attacking the swimmers and so we
create in our own imaginations a greater fear than any director could ever
project on screen. The fact that Spielberg didn't plan on doing this only makes
it better; you see when it came time to shoot the attack scenes the mechanical
shark, named Bruce after Spielberg's lawyer, wasn't properly working so
Spielberg couldn't show it all. </P>
<P>The story begins in Amity Island when, in one of the greatest opening scenes of
all-time, a teenager partying on the beach with some friends decides to go
skinny-dipping. All of a sudden something starts attacking her, and although
she is able to momentarily grab onto a buoy, she is eventually pulled under the
water and, we assume, killed. </P>
<P>The next morning Brody, the local Police Chief who hates the water, is called
in to investigate a possible drowning reported by a friend of the girl who was
attacked. Brody's Deputy has discovered the remains of the girl's body, which
has washed up on shore, and the possibility of a drowning is ruled out. </P>
<P>Brody's gut reaction is to close down the beaches but the local Mayor (Murray
Hamilton) insists on keeping to beaches open for business reasons. The Mayor
informs Brody that, `Amity is a summer town. We need summer dollars.' And Brody
is forced to keep the beaches open. Soon after, another attack claims the life
of a little boy and the Mayor announces that the beaches will be closed for 24
hours to try to catch the beast that is responsible. </P>
<P>Enter, ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who confirms that the first
attack was one of a shark. Later in a scene where Hooper and Brody go out to
sea at night to try and find the shark Hooper discovers a tooth in an abandoned
fishing boat at the bottom of the sea, a tooth that could only belong to a
Great White Shark. Then, without notice, while examining the tooth the
fisherman who owned the boat's head appears and frightens Hooper into losing
the tooth. According to the Internet Movie Database preview audiences screamed
at the original version of this scene, but director Spielberg re-shot it
because he wanted them to scream louder. </P>
<P>Eventually, the town has to turn to a loner/shark hunter named Quint (Robert
Shaw) who has promised the shark dead for ten thousand dollars. Quint
reluctantly agrees to allow Brody and Hooper accompany him on the mission and
the three men sail off to sea on what Brody has described to his kids as a
fishing trip. Quint at first resents Hooper's rich upbringing but in a great
scene where the three men (mainly Hooper and Quint) sit and talk about their
physical and emotional scars they develop a sort of bond. Quint's tale is the
most horrifying, one of how during WWII after delivering the atom bomb his ship
was sunk by torpedoes and he and his crew of 1,100 men went into shark infested
waters. Waters that only 316 men would come out of alive. And with this scene,
which was written by Shaw himself, we understand why Quint has dedicated his
life to killing sharks. Shortly after, the shark begins his final attack on the
men, a battle that not all the men will emerge from alive. </P>
<P>`Jaws' (Spielberg's second film) was filmed for $12 million and would go on to
be the first film to take in more than a $100 million at the box office (it
wound up taking in $260 million in the US alone). The filming was plagued with
problems, ranging from the complications with the mechanical shark to budgetary
problems to author Peter Benchley's objection to the movie's ending. The film
also went on to get 4 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and
won in the othet three categories for Best Sound, Best Editing (Verna Fields),
and Best Original Score (John Williams). The editing and score are so crucial
to success of the film. Roger Ebert said that the film, `Jaws' was a good story
told brilliantly and he's absolutely right, without these two key elements the
film wouldn't be what it is. Try watching the attack scenes muted, they're not
nearly as scary as with the haunting theme. Or consider the way the attacks are
handled. Not only does the score help create suspense but also the cuts from
under water to above showing the shark fin to views from the beach of the
attack. These scenes handled another, more simplistic way wouldn't have
produced the same effect that they do here. </P>
<P>`Jaws' placed 48th on the AFI's list of the 100 Greatest American Films and
it's high placement on the list, in my opinion, is deserved. `Jaws' is a highly
influential film that not only spawned three inferior sequels but countless
other rip-offs (the recent `Lake Placid' and `Deep Blue Sea' comes to mind.)
But none of these films managed to capture any of the atmosphere that the
original `Jaws' did. </P>
<P>I heard recently that, Peter Benchley, the author of the book of which the film
is based said that he could not have written it today because of how it
unfairly treats sharks. Is it true that all sharks are man-eating monsters? Of
course not. Is it true that sharks purposely target humans the way they do in
`Jaws?' Of course not. The truth of the matter is that most shark attacks occur
because of the shark's stupidity (they usually mistake humans for seals). But
knowing all of these facts I still can not step an inch in salt water and not
hear the `Jaws' theme pop in my head. I'm still not sure whether this is a good
thing or not, but there's no doubt in my mind that `Jaws' is a great film, one
that, like other Spielberg masterpieces, stays with you long after your viewing
experience is over. </P>
