<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>David Bowie isn't exactly the person you would expect to be appearing in a 
family film. Even stranger is that he's in a film having to do with such 
serious material like death, fear of death, and growing up with Hodgkin's 
disease. The surprising secret is that Bowie is the best part of the movie. 
While given first billing, he's in no more than ten minutes of the picture, 
but his voice, messages, and spirit live on in the main character. That 
character is Owen Walters (Bill Switzer) a nearly friendless young boy with 
Hodgkin's disease. The two spend a lot of time together. Owen looks for 
support, care, and advice in Mr. Rice when his parents aren't providing it. 
I'd be running to this guy too. The parents (played by Teryl Rothery and 
Garwin Standford) apparently love their son very much. However, all these 
clueless two ever do is make their child's situation worse by not encouraging 
him or answering his questions. They are unawares to the feelings their child 
is experiencing. Other characters include the stereotypical fat and stupid 
bully (Jason Anderson), and a leukemia suffering boy (Richard de Klerk) who 
is more accepting of his condition than Owen is. Together these people could 
make quite a tedious tense family drama, and at many times they do. Helping 
things move along though is the pursuit of treasure. When Mr. Rice dies, he 
leaves behind a decoder ring and code so Owen can find his secret. Soon Owen 
is digging up dead bodies, breaking into houses, and discovering lost keys 
that could all lead to Mr. Rice's secret. It's quite plain what the secret is 
early on in the film, but the journey is exciting and I was waiting to see 
what Owen would do with it.</P>
<P>Despite some somewhat solid performances, particularly from its lead, there 
isn't a huge reason to see Mr. Rice's Secret. There isn’t a reason to see it 
with the kids either. This certainly isn't a family film, even though it's 
marketed as one. The themes of death will be too heavy and boring for most 
children and the film contains an awful lot of unneeded swearing and a very 
brief sexual image. The problem is simple. I counted at least ten noticeable 
clichés I had all seen in, at minimum, five other movies. Thinking back, it's 
hard to recall a part of Mr. Rice's Secret that seemed original, witty, or 
unique. Cliché ridden movies are not always bad, but the emotion exhibited by 
the actors is faker than Cher's body. Last year, October Sky managed to be 
entertaining and sad even though it too was cliché ridden. However, that 
movie had much better actors. This isn't to say director Nicholas Kendall 
doesn't pull some things off. One character has a very funny stuttering punk 
brother, and there is a great close-up shot of ants feeding on a rotten apple 
in one frightening scene. There is also a very funny discussion about how 
authority figures (like parents) are meant to get lied to. Even so, I doubt 
parents want their children learning that you can dig up graves in the middle 
of the night and get away with it. They probably wouldn't want kids to 
blackmail their siblings, or know you can always sneak out your bedroom 
window without ever getting caught either. Additionally, we must not forget 
the most important lesson of all. Whenever you punch a fat person in the 
stomach, they always cry.</P>
<P>I do appreciate the attempt to capture young boy's friendships and their true 
meaning, but this movie is just a depressing sham. The difficulties Owen must 
face never rise above the after-school special drama level, and when I 
figured out the ending about thirty minutes into the movie that didn't help 
either. I got continuously reminded of an Aesop fable the entire time, 
thinking that each scene was there to teach me a lesson, and they do. Perhaps 
the film will be an inspiration to children with Hodgkin's, leukemia, or 
other types of life threatening diseases. It shows that you can succeed, have 
friends, and triumph in life if you are only willing to try and prove 
yourself. The actors tried, and almost flourished. Mr. Rice's Secret isn't a 
guilty pleasure; it's more of a guilty emotional enjoyment. Even if I knew 
what was going to happen, I still left with a feeling of happiness. There 
just wasn't enough real emotion or material happening in the story to get 
this thing off its feet, or for me to rise up and cheer.</P>
