<P>   During the last world war, when their country was occupied
by the Nazis, the Danes did a dauntless job of saving their
country's Jews from deportation to the death camps, putting
them in the front ranks on the Continent for such empathy,
compassion adn good will.  There's nothing like a Dane. 
Unfortunately, however, within the four walls of family life,
they're no different from the rest of us, or at least that's so in
the mind of writer-director Thomas Vinterberg whose "The
Celebration" is produced by Lars von Trier ("The Kingdom,"
parts 1 & 2).  With pederastry the trendy subject tackled this
year by the film industry--"Lolita" is hitting the screens on
Sept. 25 and "Happiness" following soon thereafter--this
Danish study of family dysfunction pushes the envelope
further.  Involuntary incest, not mere pedophilia, is the theme--
not a new one if you've read or seen "Oedipus"--but in the
hands of von Trier and Vinterberg the subjects gets a darkly
comic touch.  Most of the action takes place within the home
of a wealthy man celebrating his sixtieth birthday, so that the
story does bear the imprint of the stage and, in fact, some of
the leading performers are quite renowned players in the
Danish theater scene.</P>
<P>   A powerful drama of guilt, revelation and cleansing which in
Danish is called "Festen," this production exhibits the
perverse manners of the birthday party from hell.  Its
celebrants including a large contingent of racists, a child
molester, a wife abuser, a couple of psychotics and an
assemblage of neurotics and, as has been fashionable in
stories about incest since the time of Sophocles, a juicy
suicide.</P>
<P>   In one of the few outdoor scenes, a caravan of cars make
their way across the Danish countryside to the chateau which
is the country home of the fabulously wealthy patriarch, Helge
(Henning Moritzen).  At least two of the guests are off-the-wall
from the very beginning.  Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), the
eldest son, is so volatile he has to crash the banquet as his
dad refused to invite him.  He shrieks and is shrieked at by
his wife, Mette (Helle Dolleris), throws her out of the car to
allow his brother Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) to join him, slaps
her around, and even engages in a bout of malevolent sex,
graphically shown, as the guests are in their rooms awaiting
the call to dinner.  We learn that their sister, Linda (Lene
Laub Oksen, who shows up in a flashback) had committed
suicide by drowning herself in the bathtub a short while back,
and soon enough find out the motive behind the tragedy.</P>
<P>   As the dinner progresses with the toastmaster (Klaus
Bondam) emceeing the banal speeches of the guests,
Christian shocks the company by announcing "Dad raped us,"
adding as if to mollify the poor man that Helge had always
been a clean person, addicted to baths in all seasons.  He is
later to present another toast to his old man, one even more
shocking, but even then, the guests are prepared not to
believe him until further evidence is brought forth.</P>
<P>   Between these bouts of speechmaking, Vinterberg treats us
to some comic business and hanky panky, particularly
involving Christian's relationship to one of the house maids,
Pia (Trine Dyrholm), a woman to whom he had not been able
to commit presumably because of his childhood violations.  In
one scene Vinterberg indicts virtually the entire society of
wealthy and successful guests as racists.  When Helene
(Paprika Steen) shows up with a black boyfriend, (Gbatokai
Dakinah), the assemblage all burst forth in a racist song about
"black Sambos" and "red Indians."  In the movie's most comic
moment, Michael, spotting Gbatokai in the parking and
assuming that he is a musician rather than an invited guest,
assures him that no trumpeter would be needed for this party.</P>
<P>   Thomas Bo Larsen gets the opportunity to turn on the
emotions with an array of wildly melodramatic acting.  The
real talents of the picture, though, are Ulrich Thomsen, who
must portray an obsessed son who seems at first like the
most stable man of the group but turns into the catalyst for
disastrous revelation; and renowed stage actor Henning
Moritzen, who, like Oedipus, reflects a disbelief in the
disclosures at first but turns into a sunken shell when the final
bombshell is delivered.  </P>
<P>   Like producer Lars von Trier, director Vinterberg shows a
preference for the hand-held camera as though to portray the
party from the point of view of a guest who is snapping
photos of the macabre celebration.  The shaky hand may be
troubling at first, but effectively conveys the chaos and clutter
of the moment.</P>
<P>   Some theorists believe that dramatic conflict works best
when the skirmishing people are essentially locked together in
a closed space and cannot leave until they work out their
tensions.  What gives the picture this touch of theatricality is
that much of the action would not have taken place had the
company of guests been able to escape to their cars.  Since
the wait staff hid the keys to enjoy the fun, we are reminded
of Luis Bunuel's 1962 masterpie;ce, "The Exterminating
Angel," in which guests at an elegant dinner party cannot
bring themselves to leave and begin to starve and die after
several days.  Vinterberg's characters do eventually get to
retreat, sadder and wiser for the experience.  For some the
ritual has been a cleansing experience bringing about the
closure that will allow them to go on with their lives in a
healthier manner.  We, too, feel a sense of relief when
Vinterberg brings closure to the picture, a work which quite
effectually takes us behind closely guarded walls to explore
the nature of the rich and successful.</P>
