               To Gillian on her 37th Birthday (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<PRE>          This is a sweet movie with a sad but heartwarming story and
some very fine acting.</PRE>
<P>          Exactly two years ago, on Gillian's 35th birthday, the Lewis
family, consisting of Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer), her husband Daniel
(Peter Gallagher) and daughter Rachel (Claire Danes) were out sailing.
Gillian, in a very happy mood, climbed the mast, when a gust of wind
suddenly hit the sail and she was thrown to the deck and killed. Now,
(It would have been Gillian's 37th Birthday) Daniel cannot forget her
for a moment; in fact he has been "seeing" her at the beach and
"talking" with her as if she were still alive.</P>
<P>          As his sister-in-law, Esther, (Kathy Baker) points out to
David, his obsession with his dead wife has estranged his relationship
with his daughter and Esther is going to go to court to obtain custody
of the young teenager unless Daniel can let go of his wife and return
to a normal existence.  Daniel will have to make his move.</P>
<P>         Others in the cast include Wendy Crewson, Bruce Altman,
Laurie Fortier and Freddie Prinze, Jr.</P>
<P>         All the acting is of high caliber and that helps make the
movie believable and touching.</P>
<P>        Directed by Michael Pressman who also directed the 1985
West Coast stage production.  He is the executive producer of the TV
series PICKET FENCES and has directed some of the episodes.</P>
