PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>Meeting its relatively low expectations, the new action-comedy (or
`academy') Six Days, Seven Nights offers very little in terms of
originality, excitement or romance.  And I say low expectations because
the script from a first time writer (Michael Browning) and the director
is the recent lobotomy victim responsible for last year's reprehensible
Father's Day (Ivan Reitman).</P>
<P>The story could be written on the back of a matchbook – dumb-girl and
dumb-guy go to Hawaii; dumb-girl gets a call from her boss and has to
fly to another island with pilot old-guy; their planes crashes and they
fall in love.  That's it.  No cannibals on the island, no radios made
out of coconuts and no giant spiders.  I will say with no shame that
Gilligan's Island was more groundbreaking in terms of desert seclusion.
Actually, Six Days comes off as a bad hybrid of Gilligan and Romancing
the Stone.</P>
<P>The dumb-girl is named Robin Monroe (Anne Heche, Wag the Dog).  Her
first encounter with old-guy Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford, Air Force One)
is at the airport as he prepares his prop engine plane to haul Robin and
her dumb-boy beau Frank Martin (David Schwimmer, Friends) to a remote
Pacific vacation haven.  The scene bares a striking resemblance to an
earlier Ford film, as Robin repeatedly questions the ability of Quinn's
aging craft to safely deliver her to their destination (think Solo, Leia
and the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars).</P>
<P>Thirty minutes later, Robin and Quinn are stranded on what I can only
explain as the biggest deserted island in the history of the world.  Why
would something this huge and beautiful remain undeveloped by
conscienceless vacation kingpins?  I dunno either, but these two duds
predictably use the setting as a backdrop to bicker and then fall in
love.  YAWN!</P>
<P>Their only foil, other than the script, is a ship full of dirty pirates
led by Broken English's Temura Morrison.  These pirates would apparently
rather see Robin and Quinn dead than harmlessly stranded on the island.
Now that I think about it, I would also rather see them dead.</P>
<P>Back in civilization, dumb-boy Frank thinks his fiancée is dead and
quickly proceeds to flog Quinn's piece of ass wife six ways from
Sunday.  If these two were stranded on the island, Frank could have
knocked her out with a coconut, used her carcass for a boat and rowed
back home, using her ample bosom as personal flotation devices.  If
anyone cares, her name is Angelica and she is played by Problem Child 3
star Jacqueline Obradors.  I didn't think anyone cared.</P>
<P>While Ford looks good for 64, his acting skills leave something to be
desired.  His range is microscopic and his best acting is done when his
character is unconscious.  You know there's big problems when Schwimmer
outshines you.  Another huge flaw is the lack of chemistry between Ford
and Heche, who handles her role a bit more capably despite being young
enough to be the daughter of her wooden screen co-star.</P>
<P>The scenery is quite lovely and keenly shot by Michael Chapman (Raging
Bull).  But, the big finger of shame points fully at producer/director
Reitman, who has plummeted from the upper echelon of Hollywood comedy
creators (Animal House, Stripes) to the lowly depths of uninspired,
by-the-numbers Hollywood crap.  Flush it away, America.  Flush it twice
- just to be sure.</P>
