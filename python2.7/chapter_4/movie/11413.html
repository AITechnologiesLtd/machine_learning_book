<P>What made 1993's 'The Fugitive' so compelling was that it managed to
avoid becoming just another routine action picture with a clever script
which a lot of writers worked on, among them David Giler, Walter Hill,
Robert Mark Kamen, David Newman, Jeb Stuart and David N. Twohy.  It had
an average director (Andrew Davis) who managed to pull a rabbit out of
his director's hat by doing extremely good work but he didn't get an
Oscar nomination while the film, for Best Picture, did.  The film did
earn Tommy Lee Jones an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as a determined
U.S. marshall who absolutely will not quit until he gets his man and
Harrison Ford was unjustifiably misunderstood and snubbed for a Best
Actor nomination as Jones' intended quarry, and Ford turned in a
performance which had little dialogue but plenty of method, sublime and
reaction acting which I suppose explains why the Academy asked him to
present the Best Picture award at that given year's ceremonies.</P>
<P>Director Stuart Baird ('Executive Decision') is at the helm of 'U.S.
Marshals' which can't quite avoid being a diluted remake of 'The
Fugitive', as the plot is restricted once again to the pursuit of one
man and the exposure of a frame-up.  You don't get films more studio
oriented than this but this unnecessary movie is not a total wipeout,
despite being an effort to cash-in on the original, as it does have some
eye catching stunts, action and a pleasant pace at times but the movie
is extremely uneven.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones is back as the U.S. marshall and this time his adventure
leads him to the pursuit of an escaped prisoner (Wesley Snipes) who is
framed for two murders involving international and domestic espionage
and Jones' entire team of assistants from the first film are back to
assist him.</P>
<P>We had a bus crash and train wreck account for the mayhem which led to
escaped prisoners in 'The Fugitive' and this time it's a plane crash and
its drowning wreckage that is the culprit.  Harrison Ford jumps off of
the edge of a water dam tunnel and now Snipes avoids being captured by
Jones by swinging on a wire from the top of a building in New York and
landing squarely on top of a high speed subway car and Snipes salutes
his predator as the train speeds away and Jones can only watch.</P>
<P>I had an accurate picture of the plot this time, regardless of its
shortcomings, but I was struck by the quantity of unnecessary characters
written in for no good measure.  There is Snipes' girlfriend (Irene
Jacob) who amounts to nothing more than a sympathetic beauty.  There's
Kate Nelligan, a U.S. marshal who barks orders and pushes a pencil
behind her bureaucratic desk who isn't really in the field of action and
just happens to be Jones' boss (it should be the other way around) and
then there's Robert Downey Jr., an agent assisting Jones' and his team
who is suspiciously low-key but never effective after being exposed for
what he is.  I ended up saying "Why are these people here for no other
reason except to be annoying?"</P>
<P>In wake of its recent trend of flops, Warner Bros. is celebrating its
75th anniversary this year which they are marketing heavily and while
studio execs who are green lighting projects and making movies that
matter but don't generate great box office such as 'L.A. Confidential',
it would be nice to see a film from them that didn't have to be a quick
cash grab and all studios should have the integrity to occasionally say
no to a sequel just for the sake of money.  Just ask the creators of
'E.T.'</P>
