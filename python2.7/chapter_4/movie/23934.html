<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is one of the great dark comedies of the 1950s. The satire evolves
from the nightmare a middle-aged, suburban father has when his beautiful
20-year-old daughter, his only daughter and the one he is most partial
to of his three children, announces to him that she intends to get
married. The crises for the father becomes one of his own making, as he
is jealous of the groom, fearful that he has lost his daughter to a
stranger, overly concerned about the high cost of the wedding, and is
insecure about getting old.</P>
<P>Spencer Tracy is just superb as the father, Stanley Banks, who commutes
from his well-to-do suburban home to the city, where he is a partner in
a successful law firm. Ellie (Joan Benett) is his loyal companion,
sharing with him a happy life. Their two teen-age sons, Tommy and Ben
(Russ Tamblyn/ Tom Irish), are good kids, offering no problems. The
father's only problem in life will come over arranging for the marriage
of his daughter, as he reflects on how sad he feels about losing her.</P>
<P>The opening scene is a memorable one. Stanley is sunk down in a chair,
exasperately looking back on the wedding he has just survived, sitting
amidst a pile of junk left-over from the reception in his home. He looks
at the camera and delivers his biting account of the three months
leading up to the wedding and describes the wedding in detail. He begins
by saying: "I would like to say a few words about weddings. I've just
been through one."</P>
<P>His travail begins with the family at the dinner table where he learns
that his daughter has found someone special, and he tries to picture in
his mind which of the boys she brought over to the house is the one she
chose. When he finally meets the 26-year-old lucky fellow, Buckley
Dunstan (Don Taylor), he is disappointed and surprised that his daughter
is in such awe of him. Troubled that he knows so little about the future
groom, he arranges for a "man-to-man" talk to see if he will be a good
provider for Kay, and in the course of their talk, where he does all the
talking, he feels relieved, becoming satisfied that his daughter is
marrying a man with a head on his shoulders.</P>
<P>Next the Banks get to meet and know their daughter's in-laws, Doris
(Billie Burke) and Herbert Dunstan (Moroni Olsen). After much suspicion
about the family their daughter is marrying into, the father's concerns
are eased by seeing the beautiful house they live in and that they both
are of the same privileged class.</P>
<P>There are a few more tribulations the poor father has to go through,
such as the engagement party where he is advised by friends "from now
on, your only function is to pay the bills." Then there is his worry
that the wedding is going to bankrupt him. The amusement is in watching
him go over the large guest list, as the family tries to decide who is
to be invited to the church and who is to be invited to both the church
and the reception afterwards, and if it is possible to cut down the
guest list and save some expenses, which provokes a family dispute of
whom to leave off. Even the caterer (Leo G. Carroll), proves to be an
unpleasant problem to deal with, as Stanley wryly says, "An experienced
caterer can make you ashamed of your house in fifteen minutes."</P>
<P>One of the more comical scenes is when Kay wants to call the wedding off
because Buckley chose to go to an unromantic fishing spot for the
honeymoon, as the father listens intently to this serious dilemma and
pretends to understand his daughter's thinking on this.</P>
<P>The most telling scene is the father's bad dream about how the wedding
ceremony might turn out to be a fiasco. Finally, at the church service,
with Stanley about to lose his daughter and feeling confused about his
selfish reactions, but suddenly a reality of the situation sets in and
he comes to accept it. This is followed by the cramped wedding reception
in his redecorated house. His final sadness, is that he misses out in
saying good-bye to his daughter, as she goes off on her honeymoon,
unable to find him in the crush of guests. All his fears about losing
his daughter for good are resolved when she phones him from the train
station and reassures him that she loves him. Stanley, tired and ready
to call it a night, says aloud, " Nothing's really changed, has it? You
know what they say: 'My son's my son until he gets him a wife, but my
daughter's my daughter all of her life.' All of our life."</P>
