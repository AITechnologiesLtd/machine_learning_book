<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>This randy and crass sequel to AP: International Man of Mystery is more
like the gag-fest There's Something About Mary than its predecessor.
Laden with a ballast of delicious bathroom humor (a long-time Sick-Boy
fave), AP:TSWSM opens with a fading scroll (a la Star Wars) explaining
the events from the first film – shaggy Powers (Mike Myers, Wayne's
World) was frozen in 1967 so that he could be thawed in the ‘90s to
fight the evil Dr. Evil (also Myers).</P>
<P>In the new film, the still-unfrozen Powers must travel back in time to
the psychedelic ‘60s to stop Evil, who has rocketed back to Earth in an
egg (a la Mork & Mindy) launched from the posterior of an intergalactic
Big Boy (one of several annoying product placement scenes), and
traverses time to steal a giant vial of `mojo' from a still-frozen
Powers.  `Mojo' is apparently is ‘60's version of Viagra, and is thusly
very important to our hero.</P>
<P>Some might find the story confusing, while others will point out the
obvious plot holes.  The filmmakers go out of their way to graciously
explain that they are not only aware of the script's obvious flaws, but
that they also don't care - and neither will you.  You'll be too busy
trying not to laugh up a vital organ.  The script (co-written by Myers
and friend Michael McCullers) concentrates more on gross-out humor than
the ‘60s spoofing featured in the prequel.  Director Jay Roach (upcoming
Mystery, Alaska) is also back at the helm for this film, which was
supposedly contrived of mostly improvisational material.</P>
<P>Reprising her part from the first film, Elizabeth Hurley (EdTV, My
Favorite Martian) delivers her least annoying role of the year as
Powers' bride Vanessa Kensington, but that probably had more to do with
her exploding in the film's first five minutes than her acting chops.
Fellow EdTV alum Clint Howard seems oddly out of place in a film not
directed by a relative.</P>
<P>Other holdovers include Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling, Idle Hands) and
Number 2 (Robert Wagner, Hart to Hart), who both play assistants to
Evil.  Seth Green (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is also back as Scott Evil,
the wonderfully cynical son of the doctor, who is highlighted in one
particularly funny scene – an episode of Jerry Springer featuring kids
whose parents have crazy plans of world domination.</P>
<P>The standout newcomer is, of course, the diminutive Verne Troyer (Men in
Black) who plays Mini-Me, a cloned version of Dr. Evil that is
approximately 1/8th the size (but all the evil) of the original.
Although he has no lines, Troyer steals every scene he's in.  But don't
overlook Rob Lowe (Tommy Boy), who plays a young Number 2 and does a
low-key but hysterical dead-on impression of Wagner.  Lowe actually had
a very small part in the first film, billed as `friend of security
guard.'</P>
<P>And don't forget the new AP babes - Heather Graham (Boogie Nights) is
CIA agent and Powers' love/lust interest Felicity Shagwell.  Kristen
Johnston (3rd Rock From the Sun) plays Evil's double-op, brunette model
Ivana Humpalot.  There's someone named Robin Swallows, too, but I was
doubled over at the waist when they were describing just who she was.</P>
<P>But the best new character has to be the disgusting, baby-eating Scot
called Fat Bastard (Myers again).  He weighs a metric ton and is
responsible for the most revolting bathroom scene since Trainspotting.
If that doesn't get you motivated to see the film, I don't know what
will.  (1:37 - PG-13 for sexual innuendo and crude humor)</P>
