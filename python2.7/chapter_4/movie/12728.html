<P>     Oscar Wilde -- satirist, playwright, and novelist -- was one of the 
great figures of the late 19th century.  Born in Dublin in 1854, Wilde 
was schooled at Oxford, where he became a free-thinker and settled into 
the lifestyle of an aesthete.  In 1881, he published his first volume of 
poems and in 1882, his debut stage production, VERA, OR THE NIHILISTS 
was performed.  Thereafter, for the next 13 years, Wilde's reputation 
was in a constant state of ascension.  He published his lone novel, THE 
PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, in 1891, but is best known for four plays: LADY 
WINDERMERE'S FAN (1892), A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE (1893), AN IDEAL 
HUSBAND (1895), and THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST (1895).  In 1895, 
Wilde, a known homosexual, was arrested and convicted of sodomy in 
association with his relationship with Lord Alfred ("Bosie") Douglas.  
He served two years of hard labor, but, after his release, never fully 
recovered his health and died of meningitis in 1900.  </P>
<P>     Like many artistic figures throughout history, Wilde's reputation 
has waxed and waned with the mutation of the social climate.  During the 
1880s and early 1890s, he was the toast of England.  Following his 
trial, he was persona non grata, and had to eke out an existence using a 
pseudonym for the rest of his life.  Into the early 20th century, his 
name was reviled, but, as the years passed and critics looked back at 
Wilde's work from a more detached perspective, his sullied reputation 
became rehabilitated.  Today, he is regarded as a literary giant, and 
perhaps the best playwright of the second half of the 19th century.</P>
<P>     WILDE, the new film from Brian Gilbert (TOM & VIV), is a fairly 
straightforward biographical tale that chronicles the title character's 
life from 1882, when he visited a silver mine in Colorado, until 1897, 
when he was released from prison.  Despite an uneven script and a rather 
mundane, occasionally-plodding narrative, the movie is compelling, 
largely because Wilde's life was fascinating.  Throw in a number of top-
notch performances and, even without any flourishes, the film offers a 
solid two hours of entertainment, and, for anyone unfamiliar with Wilde 
or his work, perhaps education.</P>
<P>     As is often the case with a movie that crams 15 years of history 
into 120 minutes (for the non-mathematical, that's only 8 minutes per 
year), there's a lack of consistency in the tone.  Certain characters 
and subplots are sadly neglected.  In particular, I was disappointed 
with the handling of Wilde's home life and marriage, which, for a man of 
his nature, was surely a point of great personal conflict and 
uncertainty.  The few brief scenes of Wilde with his wife and children 
didn't satisfy my curiosity, and the resolution of this story aspect 
felt sadly incomplete.  There are times throughout the entire film when 
subplots drag on a little too long -- the relationship between Wilde and 
Bosie is a prime example.  Ironically, despite the languid pace of much 
of the film, the last 20 to 30 minutes have a rushed feel, almost as if 
the director realized he was running out of time and wanted to compress 
as much into the proceedings as he could.  Through it all, however, 
Wilde stands tall as the magnetic central figure.  </P>
<P>     If there was ever an actor born to play Wilde, it's British 
thespian Stephen Fry (PETER'S FRIENDS, TV's "Jeeves and Wooster"), who 
resembles the playwright in stature and is able to deliver his 
witticisms with the perfect edge and intonation.  For Fry, this is a 
dream role -- in a recent conversation over dinner, he spoke eloquently 
and at length about his passion for Wilde and his work.  Considering the 
sprawling nature of the narrative, Fry is given a daunting task -- keep 
the audience involved in the story and anchored to the character -- that 
he carries off without seeming difficulty.</P>
<P>     Every bit Fry's equal is Jude Law (GATTACA), who develops Bosie 
into a truly three-dimensional individual.  Volatile, passionate, 
occasionally spiteful, and often impatient, Bosie has the kind of 
multifaceted personality that captures and holds our attention.  Law's 
careful performance makes it impossible to love or hate the man -- at 
times, he's a monster; at other times, he's an angel.  The supporting 
cast includes Vanessa Redgrave as Wilde's mother, Tom Wilkinson (THE 
FULL MONTY) as Bosie's brutish father, Michael Sheen as Wilde's first 
male lover, and a woefully underused Jennifer Ehle (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) 
as Wilde's wife.  Despite limited screen time, Ehle manages to fashion 
Connie Wilde into a heartbreakingly sympathetic character, which makes 
the truncation of that subplot all the more frustrating.</P>
<P>     One of the many things WILDE does right is to convey a sense of the 
man apart from his work.  During the course of the film, Wilde is often 
compared to some sort of literary prophet (he has "disciples"), and it's 
easy to see how young men would be attracted to this charming, erudite 
man who uses his "wit as a foil."  Ultimately, while WILDE lacks the 
depth and substance of the best biographical features, it's nevertheless 
a strong enough contender to deserve a trip to the local theater, 
especially with pickings so slim this summer.</P>
