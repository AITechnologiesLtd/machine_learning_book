<PRE>                         JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE
                       A film review by Vince Waldron
                        Copyright 1997 Vince Waldron</PRE>
<P>It isn't being billed as such, but this is actually the fourth installment
in Jackie's popular Police Story series--and the good news is that it is
indeed a worthy successor to those earlier action gems.   Actually, it's
not surprising that the film's stateside distributors have been downplaying
the films lineage to the earlier police story series, since most of the
earlier police story adventures have yet to recieve widespread distribution
in the united states.  Besides, with a spy versus spy plotline that exists
largely to drop Jackie into a string of life threatening action sequences
spread out across the globe, this film owes as much to the james bond films
of the seventies as it does to Jackie earlier police story action comedies.
This is also one of the first Jackie vehicles that seems designed to
appeal to the western market from its inception--and it is by far the most
successful of the jackie movies to gain widespread distribution in this
country.  Like Rumble in the bronx, this one moves the action from Hong
Kong to a vaguely recognizable western location--in this case a pacific
resort in an australian metropolis.  </P>
<P>But unlike the inferior "rumble," in which Jackie seemed somewhat
constrained by the limited action potential of that film's bogus new york
locations, the star is let loose in a string of
breathtaking set pieces in snow, sea and air.  There are a number of
superbly choreographed fights scenes, including a splendid set piece in
which Jackie employs an aluminum painter's ladder to dazzling effect--I
don't think an inanimate object has been as thrilling since Fred Astaire
stepped out with that hat rack back in Hollywood's golden age.  Best of
all, the film's breakneck plot allows Jackie plenty of opportunity to
demonstrate his deft sense of physical comedy--which is a quality that's
been somewhat lacking in most of the star's previous stateside releases.</P>
<P>Highly recommended to Jackie's fans, I think this would also serve as the
perfect introduction to Jackie's magic for those of you wondering what the
hub bub is all about.</P>
