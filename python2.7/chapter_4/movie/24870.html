<P>Have you ever been driving on an empty, open road and had the sudden urge to 
put the pedal to the metal, not just to see how fast you could go, but for 
the pure adrenaline rush? Driving far past the speed limit may be illegal, 
and potentially dangerous, but that risk just aids in the sense of freedom 
you unavoidably obtain. Dominic Sena's "Gone in 60 Seconds," based on a cult 
1974 film of the same name (famous for a showstopping 40-minute car chase 
sequence), is the latest brain(less)child of producer Jerry Bruckheimer 
(1997's "Con Air," 1998's "Armageddon")--someone who knows how to make a 
movie fast-paced, and how to orchestrate overblown action setpieces--and it 
should have been the film to reinforce the idea of letting go of your 
inhibitions and driving fast every now and again. Walking out of the theater, 
director Sena (in his feature film debut after making many flashy television 
commercials) and Bruckheimer, no doubt, want the audience to get such an 
urge, but they fail miserably, even on the elementary level of creating 
excitement.</P>
<P>For six years, Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) has been retired from his former 
car thief business, and has taken up a job as a kiddie Go-Kart operator 
somewhere in the Nevada desert. When he receives word that his younger 
brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi), has since picked up the trade and landed 
himself in hot water with crime boss Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston), 
Memphis flees back to San Francisco to save him. Raymond gives Memphis an 
ultimatum: steal fifty assigned cars in four days, or Kip has to pay the 
consequences. Predictably, a ragtag group of reformed car thieves and Kip's 
friends are assembled to help Memphis in his quest, none of which have more 
than one or two defining characteristics. He is also reunited with his 
dreadlocked ex-lover, Sway (Angelina Jolie), who looks as if she just 
returned from her "Battlefield Earth" audition. Meanwhile, two detectives 
(Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant) are hot on Memphis' trail.</P>
<P>Several months ago, when the trailer for "Gone in 60 Seconds" began 
advertising, one woman behind me in the theater, following the preview, 
exclaimed, "I'm exhausted just watching that!" To be sure, the film looked as 
if it was sure to be a balls-to-the-wall, no-holds-barred summer action 
picture. The aforementioned lady in the theater needn't have fretted about 
the aspects of possibly seeing "Gone in 60 Seconds," because the trailer is 
infinitely more thrilling than the actual movie, which has all of about two 
or three action scenes strung out over the course of two hours, with 
nonsensical, time-filling rubbish in between. In pure Jerry Bruckheimer 
fashion, character-building moments mean 30-second dialogue exchanges 
overpopulated with corny one-liners. In pure Jerry Bruckheimer fashion, every 
shot has been given a yellowish tint by cinematographer Paul Cameron, as if a 
filter has been strategically placed over the camera to portray the world as 
naturally looking like a golden palace.
However, what is not in pure Jerry Bruckheimer fashion is the film's slow 
pace and wearisomely dull action scenes--all two or three of them.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage can be--no, strike that--is a brilliant actor, so why he 
continues to make great films (i.e. 1995's "Leaving Las Vegas," 1999's 
"Bringing Out the Dead"), followed by insipid ones (1997's "Con Air," 1998's 
"Snake Eyes"), is a question only he could be able to answer. His talent is 
genuine, and his face has a wonderful, soulful quality that allows him to 
"say" a great deal when given the chance. Life is too short to be wasting his 
time in throwaway roles that give him nothing to do, except cash a fat 
paycheck.</P>
<P>The top-to-bottom talent that "Gone in 60 Seconds" exudes is amazing all the 
same, none of which have any reason at all to appear here. Fresh off her 
Academy Award winning performance in "Girl, Interrupted," Angelina Jolie is 
second-billed, but appears for all of about fifteen minutes (if that) in an 
underutilized role that not only wastes her, but causes you to almost forget 
how good she can be in other movies. As the snappily-named Sway, Jolie 
sleepwalks through her fleeting scenes as if she is attempting to blend into 
the background and not be discovered as an actual performer involved in such 
a bottomless pit. </P>
<P>As younger brother Kip, Giovanni Ribisi is appropriately scummy-looking and 
slimy, but one wonders why Memphis would go through so much trouble to save 
such an ungrateful prick. Until checking over the cast list following viewing 
the movie, I had almost forgotten Robert Duvall was in it, which gives you an 
idea of how much of an impression he makes. Especially distressing are the 
young rising stars that appear for very little rhyme or reason, including 
James Duval (1995's "The Doom Generation"), Scott Caan (1999's "Boiler 
Room"), and Timothy Olyphant (1999's "Go"). The only actor that escapes 
relatively unscathed is Delroy Lindo, as Detective Roland Castlebeck, who 
brings a certain charm and, dare I say, depth to his scenes that are missing 
elsewhere.</P>
<P>The opening 100 minutes are nothing more than setup for the climactic car 
chase, but instead of breathtakingly going down as one of the classic chase 
sequences, along with 1971's "The French Connection" and 1998's "Ronin", Sena 
botches everything by haphazard editing that robotically switches back and 
forth between the pedal, Cage's face, and an overview shot of the car. But, 
considering the disposability of what came before, it should have been 
expected. The underwhelming finale simply proved what I had increasingly been 
realizing throughout, which is that there was no reason for "Gone in 60 
Seconds" to be made at all.</P>
