Susan Granger's review of "I DREAMED OF AFRICA" (Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P> Kuki Gallmann is an amazing woman whose story is a testament
to courage, determination, and tenacity.  Two years ago, I had the
privilege of meeting Kuki and spending several evenings with her on
her ranch in Kenya.  An Italian aristocrat by birth, Kuki (Kim
Basinger) begins her tale with how she met Paolo (Vincent Perez), her
second husband, who convinced her to move with her young son,
Emanuele, to Kenya in 1974, over the protests of her mother (Eva Marie
Saint).  Despite difficulty in adjusting to the tempo and pace of
life, the dangerous wildlife, greedy poachers, the ravages of nature,
and - most of all- the loneliness at Ol Ari Nyiro ranch, Kuki fell
passionately in love with Africa. Her devotion was so intense that it
withstood two devastating losses. Paolo was killed in a car accident
driving home with a cradle for their unborn daughter and, three years
later, Emanuele, an amateur herpetologist, was fatally bitten by a
puff adder. Yet, with all this inherent drama, the film skims over the
surface. Written by Paula Milne & Susan Shilliday and directed by Hugh
Hudson, it never develops an emotional connection between the
audience, nor does it communicate a challenging sense of
adventure. Instead, it unfolds with the languid pace of a magnificent
travelogue. While Kim Basinger is appealing, she doesn't capture
Kuki's zest and enthusiasm - let alone her flamboyant style and
Italian accent. In comparison with "Out of Africa," Kim's no Meryl
Streep, nor is Vincent Perez a Robert Redford.  On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "I Dreamed of Africa" is a stunning, lyrical 6. You
can stay at Kuki's Mukutan Retreat in Laikipia on the edge of the
Great Rift Valley to experience the wonders of Africa's
wilderness. But if you can't take that trip, seeing this movie is the
next-best thing.</P>
