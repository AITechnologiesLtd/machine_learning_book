<PRE>Mickey Blue Eyes (1999, PG-13)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Kelly Makin</PRE>
<P>Written by Adam Sheinman and Robert Kuhn</P>
<P>Starring Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, and James Caan</P>
<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> Somehow, I feel like I've traveled back in time.  I feel like I have
journeyed to a land not far away (my local multiplex) and a not-so-long time
ago (February) when I was watching Analyze This.  By the time Analyze This
came out, it was mob spoof number three ("The Don's Analyst" on behalf of
TMC, "The Sopranos" on behalf of HBO).  Mickey Blue Eyes becomes number four
this summer as Hugh Grant once attempts to be a perfect British gentleman in
awkward circumstances.</P>
<P> We have the same backdrop that Analyze This did, of people getting whacked
and an outsider being let into the group.  We have the same silly jokes, the
same good moments, and the same generally bearable nature.  "The Sopranos"
and Analyze This both stand out on the list of good mob spoofs, but Mickey
Blue Eyes seems just to take on this newest formula: the mob spoof.</P>
<P> Sure, they left out the shrink this time but they put Hugh Grant in
instead.  This time, Grant wants to marry Jeanne Tripplehorn (after 3 months
of dating) but she doesn't want him to become a wiseguy.  Between Analyze
This and Mickey Blue Eyes, I sense a pattern with botched mob weddings, but
who cares.</P>
<P> Mickey Blue Eyes does a fair job of holding its own as a movie, adding in
some original scenes such as Grant tripping over his British accent as he
attempts to say fuggetaboutit, a phrase which I was able to pull off living
in New Jersey after only a week without a drop of Italian blood in me.
Another great point comes as two pairs of mobsters try to bury bodies on
opposite sides of a small pile of dirt.</P>
<P> However, memorable scenes is all that Mickey Blue Eyes amounts to.  It
tries to have a part of it concerned with serious plot, and, unlike Analyze
This, fails completely.  Not that it matters at all, because this is still
summer and still no one really gives a damn.</P>
<P> Hugh Grant does his best with the part but it is highly obvious how awkward
he feels, perhaps because his criminal behavior is usually limited to the
misdemeanor "Soliciting the services of a prostitute".  Jeanne Tripplehorn
seems to always be the person pitted against the mob (i.e. The Firm).  James
Caan does all right, but simply doesn't have the comic gumption to pull his
performance off.</P>
<P> The question that both Mickey Blue Eyes and The Thirteenth Floor brought to
mind is very simple: is the bizarre becoming the norm?  Both of them copied
films that went away from the norm, and, as a consequence, ended up as a
weak facsimile of the original.  The spirit seems to have died somewhere in
between.</P>
<P> This serves to prove my theory about Hollywood: that they can only copy.
Hollywood has spent years seeing a film, saying "wow, that's innovative",
and making copies of it until it becomes a formula.  There are originals
somewhere, but they are buried so deep in cliche that, by the time we get to
The Thirteenth Floor and Mickey Blue Eyes, we are so sick and tired of it
that we don't care where it came from and swear off the formula as a whole.</P>
<P> Another prime example comes in the new horror films, which remain conscious
of their level of self-insult, but, even in the case of The Blair Witch
Project, only serve to follow formulas.</P>
<P> In my review of Message in a Bottle, I pleaded for intelligent characters.
In this review, I'm making an honest plea for a new plot.  I'm so tired of
your formulaic crap, and I'm sure I'm not alone in my gripe and groan.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
