<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>An eclectic mix of The Matrix, The Game and Groundhog's Day, this
Spanish import was the winner of the Grand Prix award at the Tokyo
International Film Festival.  And if you've seen any Japanese
psychological thrillers lately, you'll know exactly why.</P>
<P>Director Alejandro Amenábar, who co-wrote the script with Mateo Gil,
casts Eduardo Noriega as César, a handsome, well-to-do bachelor that
prides himself on never bedding the same girl twice.  That is, until he
meets Sofía (Penélope Cruz, The Hi-Lo Country).  The trouble is that his
previous conquest, Nuria (Najwa Nimri, Lovers of the Arctic Circle) is a
bit of a wacko, continually stalking César and eventually disfiguring
his pretty-boy face in an automobile accident/suicide attempt.</P>
<P>But is any of it real?  César repeatedly wakes up to a world that is
slightly different than that of the previous day.  Was there really an
accident?  Is there really a Sofía?  Were doctors really able to
reconstruct César's face?  You'll have to see it to find out, and even
then you may not even know.  It's tough to follow and the subtitles
don't help.  But it is sufficiently strange to whet this boy's
appetite.  (1:50 - R for nudity, strong sexuality, language and some
violence – In Spanish with English subtitles)</P>
