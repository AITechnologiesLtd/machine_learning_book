Susan Granger's review of "A DOG OF FLANDERS" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P>         Set in the early 19th century in the Dutch-speaking region of
Belgium known as Flanders, this tale revolves - not around a dog - but
a boy.  Little Nello (Jesse James/Jeremy James) is an poor orphan who
grows up in the care of his kindly grandfather (Jack Warden). Since
his mother was an artist and left him her sketchbook, Nello loves to
draw. A chance meeting with a noted local artist (Jon Voight)
introduces the great Flemish painter, Peter Paul Rubens, as a focus
for Nello's dreams. So where does the dog come in? By the side of the
road, Nello finds a large Bouvier des Flanders who was cruelly abused
by a peddler and befriends him, naming him Patrasche. Big, black,
fluffy Patrasche trots around as Nello's loyal companion, but the pet
is limited to the periphery of the action. Writer/director Kevin
Brodie, working with Robert Singer, adapting the novel by Ouida
(a.k.a. Marie Louise de la Ramee), comes up with trite dialogue
punctuating a contrived yet predictable story. Those familiar with the
book will note that the ending has been changed to one much
happier. Brought up on a diet of fast-paced television, children will
undoubtedly be bored, squirming in their seats along with their
parents. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A Dog of Flanders" is
a slow-paced, dreary 3. "Real happiness comes not with possessions or
positions but with people" and "Never underestimate the power of love"
are worthwhile sentiments but they're presented in the dullest
framework possible.</P>
