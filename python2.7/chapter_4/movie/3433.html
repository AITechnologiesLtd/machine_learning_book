<P>     As portrayed in MINBO--OR THE GENTLE ART OF JAPANESE EXTORTION,
gangsters, or yakuza, as they're called, come across as real-life
versions of Popeye's arch-rival Bluto.  They bluster, they shout, they
turn red in the face, and they cut off their own fingers, but they never
actually harm, or even blatantly threaten, a "citizen."  That's because
the punishment for getting caught doing either is a jail sentence, and
Japanese gangsters don't want to go to jail.  So, instead of obvious and
brutal types of intimidation, they try something called minbo--extorting
money through fear.  They figure that if they shout at a person long and
loud enough, the victim will eventually give in and pay up.</P>
<P>     I'm not in a position to evaluate the cultural accuracy of MINBO's
portrayal of the mob and its role in Japanese society, but the real-world
yakuza apparently didn't appreciate it--after the Japanese premiere of
MINBO in 1992, director Juzo Itami (TAMPOPO) was stabbed.  Thankfully,
the wound wasn't fatal.  Itami has since recovered, but the ordeal has
strengthened his resolve to speak out against gangsters.</P>
<P>     Most of the film centers around events at the Europa, an upscale
Tokyo hotel that is adding a wing in hopes of attracting international
conventions.  The general manager, Kobayashi (Akira Takarada), is
informed that although his facilities are exemplary, he has an image
problem--the yakuza have made his lobby a hangout.  Until they, with
their veiled threats of violence, are gone, it's too dangerous to have
heads of state staying at the Europa.</P>
<P>     Kobayashi takes action, creating an "anti-yakuza" strike force of
two:  a meek accountant named Suzuki (Yasuo Daichi) and his inept
sidekick, bellboy Wakasugi (Takehiro Murata).  Together, armed with no
courage, no budget, and an imposing charter--get rid of the yakuza--the
pair embarks on a campaign to free the Europa from the scourge of the
mob.  It doesn't take long before they've paid out over $70,000 in
extortion money with little in the way of results to show for it.
Kobayashi, suitably dismayed by their lack of progress, brings in a minbo
specialist, lawyer Mahiru Inoue (Nobuko Miyamoto), to help the bumbling
Suzuki.  She proves her worth almost immediately, giving a crash course
in yakuza tactics, then ably handling the first crisis to come her way.</P>
<P>     MINBO is at its best chronicling the moves and countermoves of the
almost-gamelike war between the various mobsters and the anti-yakuza trio
at the Europa.  Many of these are presented in a lighthearted, cartoonish
fashion, and are played mostly for laughs.  Suzuki and Wakasugi are the
picture of nervous incompetence, and it's a riot to see tiny Inoue run
roughshod over a gang of tattooed bullies.  Elements of MINBO's comedy
are almost classic.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the film isn't content with satire.  The last twenty
minutes are unnecessarily grim and contrived, including one scene of such
embarrassing overacting (by Murata) that it should have been excised from
the final print.  There's an-impossible-to-miss moral ("It is better to
die for your beliefs than live as a coward.") and a Hollywood-type
climax.  MINBO's final act is so at variance with the rest of the film in
tone and content that it seems culled from an entirely different picture.</P>
<P>     Despite its failings, however, MINBO is still enjoyable, as much for
the sprightly performance of Nobuko Miyamoto (as Inoue) as for its
tongue-in-cheek look at the Japanese mob.  It's a difficult task to
fashion comedy from such unpleasant material, no matter how ripe the
target is for parody.  Itami does a credible job, though, using the
opportunity not only to skewer the yakuza, but to take a jab or two at
Japanese society as a whole, and especially the woman's role in it.
Because of limited and sporadic distribution, prints of MINBO will not be
easy to locate, but when one becomes available, the film is certainly
worth a look.  You could do worse--much worse--at any local multiplex.</P>
