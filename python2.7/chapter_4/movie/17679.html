<PRE>The Matrix
At theatres everywhere
By Vince Yim</PRE>
<P>(originally for The Ubyssey, the student paper of the University of
British Columbia, April 7, 1999)</P>
<P>   What do you do when you wake up one day and realize that your entire
life is a lie?</P>
<P>   After countless movie trailers that blow too many secrets and
ultimately fail to deliver, we finally have a product that far outweighs
the hype. The Matrix tells the tale of a computer hacker named Neo
(played by Keanu Reeves) who unknowingly holds the key to an effort to
bring down a mysterious organization that is manipulating reality and
the collective minds of humanity. Using high-tech implants and weapons,
Neo and an underground movement jump between reality and the manipulated
world. However, the question still remains. What is the real world,
anyway?</P>
<P>   Due to the film's dark atmosphere and the premise, The Matrix will
inevitably garner comparisons to 1998's underrated Dark City. While Dark
City is a well constructed sci-fi thriller, one glimpse of The Matrix
and it is clear which one will win out more fans.</P>
<P>   While the special effects and art direction in Dark City are nothing
to sneeze at, the visuals of The Matrix must be seen to be believed.
Despite a small budget (in this post-Titanic world, anything costing
$70M or less is considered small budget), the filmmakers truly push the
envelope, using technology that was beyond reach not too long ago.  Not
relying solely on CGI, directors Larry and Andy Wachowski call for some
very complex camera work, leading to bizarre visuals once seen only in
comic books and Japanese animated films such as <<ital4>> Ghost in the
Shell.  </P>
<P>   As the story involves characters that have found out how to
manipulate "reality", this leads to agonizing slow-motion sequences and
bizarre freeze frames in which a character jumps into the air and seems
to freeze in place as the camera flows towards another angle. In terms
of visuals, <<ital2>> The Matrix breaks a lot of ground with the camera
effects and computer renderings. This is largely due to the background
of the directors, who wrote comic books along side Vancouver based comic
book artist Steve Skroce (who also provided storyboards for the film).</P>
<P>   Apart from comic books and Japanese animation, the film also has
inspiration from Hong Kong filmmakers, thanks to HK martial arts
director Yuen Wo-Ping and three months of hard work and training by the
actors. When combined with the computer aided effects and gratuitous
slow-motion effects, it leads to many incredible action sequences,
especially a wild shootout that comes close to putting action maestro
John Woo to shame.  </P>
<P>   While the film is a dazzling spectacle that leaves the audience
gaping in disbelief, The Matrix could have benefited from at least one
more re-write of the script. While the storyline explores many
interesting ideas and bizarre concepts, there are a few noticeable holes
and inconsistencies, and some of the dialogue is unintentionally
laughable. Regardless, these flaws are immediately smoothed over as soon
as we see something really cool on screen. And there are a lot of really
cool things on screen.</P>
<P>   And of course, the film would not be much without the actors.
Surprisingly, Keanu Reeves comes off pretty well, although he does have
a tendency to degrade into a Bill & Ted type character at some moments.
Canadian newcomer Carrie-Anne Moss plays a rather unemotional role,
although that is pretty much all that the script calls for. Still, one
has to keep in mind the dedication that the characters put into the
roles, especially since within the three months of martial arts
training, they could have easily made another film.</P>
<P>   In a movie industry where just about every surprise is already blown
and nothing is new, The Matrix easily blows them all away. This film
will easily keep the most jaded sci-fi fans and movie buffs happily
satiated until the release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace in May.</P>
