<P>A new entry in the "revisionist history" genre of filmmaking, Dick
suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the
uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal.  Kirsten
Dunst and Michelle Williams star Betsy and Arlene, who while trying to
deliver a fan letter from Arlene's Watergate hotel room, accidentally
stumble across G. Gordon Liddy (played dead-on by Harry Shearer) and
the infamous break-in.  When they recognize Liddy later on during a
White House field trip, they are ushered into a conference room,
questioned as to what they know, and leave as official presidential
dog walkers.  The girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the
Watergate scandal while performing their duties, but have no clue as
to what they are getting involved with.  When they discover that Nixon
(another dead-on performance by Dan Hedaya, who actually favors Nixon
slightly, unlike Anthony Hopkins) has been abusive to Checkers, the
presidential dog, thanks to the conversations that he always recorded,
they quit and become disillusioned.  During a prank phone call the
girls make to Woodward and Bernstein, events are set into motion that
eventually lead to the president's resignation.</P>
<P>This film starts off promisingly with an aged Woodward and Bernstein
arguing with each other on an obvious Larry King-type talk show
(featuring a cameo by French Stewart) about revealing the identity of
"Deep Throat".  From there, we are subjected to bodily function humor
and just about every bad "dick" joke one can derive from this type of
supposed comedy.  At one point, the girls are having to scream over a
high school band playing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  The
band manages to stop right as Dunst screams "You have to stop letting
Dick run your life!" much to the horror of everyone standing within
earshot.  Several other variations on this wordplay surface all
throughout the film.  If this movie had been smarter I would have been
less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor, but it's not.  The
film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every
major player in the Watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down
the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible.  I don't
recall Oliver Stone's Nixon having to pander to it's audience, but of
course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old
film going audience.</P>
<P>The only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable
supporting cast.  I wanted to see more of Ferrell and McCulloch's
Woodward and Bernstein.  Those two characters are the sole basis for
my rating.  I wish they had been given more screen time, but
unfortunately, they are only relegated to the final half-hour.  Their
constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a
major highlight, especially McCulloch's constant thwarting of
Ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls (who, in the
course of the narrative are revealed as Deep Throat, so named thanks
to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by Betsy's brother).</P>
<P>The other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of
their particular characters, but are given nothing to work with.  I'd
like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more
suited towards their comedic abilities.  As for the two leads, Dunst
and Williams can definitely do better.  They come off as what could
best be described as Romy and Michele:The Early Years in this
particular film, a highly dubious distinction at best.  Stay through
the first half of the end credits though, to see an interesting scene
involving Dunst and Williams suggestively sucking on lollipops
emblazoned with the title of the movie.</P>
<P>An excellent idea marred by poor execution, Dick could have been a
great movie.  Less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter
comedy displayed by the Woodward and Bernstein scenes, could have made
this film a wonderful satire of the Nixon presidency as seen through
the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds.  As it stands though, Dick
offers nothing but what filmmaker Kevin Smith so accurately defines as
"dick and poopie" jokes.  And that, to me, does not make a funny
movie.  [PG-13]</P>
