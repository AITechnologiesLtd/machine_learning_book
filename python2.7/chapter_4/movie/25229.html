<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A strange little tale from England about a weirdo homicidal killer,
Eunice (Amanda Plummer), who is first seen barging into a sevice-station
rest stop and asking the girl behind the counter, "Are you Judith?" Then
she hums a tune while asking, "Do you have this record?" All the time
moving nervously about, hopping from foot to foot, in constant motion,
before she kills the girl who is behind the counter for no apparent
reason.</P>
<P>She meets a naive girl in one of the petrol stations who is attracted to
her, Miriam (Saskia Reeves). Saskia emotes in a contrasting understated
performance to the energetic Amanda's. She is the narrator and does it
in a matter-of-fact casual voice from behind prison bars, as seen in a
black-and-white videotape. She tells how Amanda captivated her and how
she chose to run away with her and form a lesbian relationship, getting
involved in a string of murders.</P>
<P>When Amanda runs out of Miriam's petrol station and douses herself with
gas, Miriam runs out to comfort her and Amanda gives her a big kiss.
>From then on, the dimwitted, hard-of-hearing, psychologically impaired,
meek, young girl becomes a follower of the sociopath Amanda, even
bringing her home to meet her infirmed mother, who despotically demands
constant care from her. At one point the sweet talking Miriam declares,
"Mother, Auntie Kathy, a girl at swimming--and Eunice, Those are all the
people who have kissed me." After one night in bed with Amanda, she is
willing to run away with her, thinking that this is her one chance at
finding happiness from her dull existence.</P>
<P>This is a pointless, violent road movie about two very sick girls, who
are not explained or studied, but are just shown to be on a wreckless
course of destruction. Amanda with an urge to kill and be punished for
it, is supposedly looking for her ex-lover named Judy. But Judy might
also be viewed as a figment of her warped mind, or perhaps she
represents someone from the Bible, like the avenger named Judith who
beheaded an enemy of the Israelites. Amanda displays a death wish,
saying, "I'm bad, I won't change. Punishment is all I understand." While
Miriam is a lost soul, having no sense of who she is, armed only with a
very low opinion of herself. She tries to please Amanda, cleaning up
after her murders and travelling with her aimlessly across England's
northern seacoast, getting involved with a number of repelling roadside
crimes. It is not possible to make sense of how these girls relate to
each other and how brutally they act.</P>
<P>The film is mainly interesting because of Amanda Plummer's devilish
performance, where
she needs to be hurt in order to feel that God loves her, wanting
desperately to know that he is aware of her murders of innocent people.
She is a hard-edged psychopath, wracked with an unbelievable amount of
pain, only taking pleasure when she unbuttons her blouse to show off her
lean body, which is covered with bruises and 17 tattoos, each with a
personal meaning. She is also wrapped in chains and has her nipples
pierced and linked  with nipple clamp attachments strung across her
chest. This armament causes her to clank whenever she moves. The
depravity and depth of alienation she evokes from her character, and the
energy that Amanda Plummer puts into her characterization, make this a
fascinating film, if you can ever get past the bleakness of the story.</P>
