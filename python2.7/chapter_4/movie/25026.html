<P>Back in 1996, I made the comment that Tom Cruise's films seemed to be less 
than stellar achievements. However, since then he has proven to be a solid 
actor with "Jerry Maguire," "Eyes Wide Shut," and "Magnolia." Mostly, Cruise 
has become the Dick Clark of superstars who never seems to age and always 
plays righteous, good all-American boys a'la "Top Gun."  Like some of his 
lesser achievements, "Far and Away" and "The Firm," "Mission: Impossible" is 
somewhat fluffy and mediocre yet it boasts some electrifying, entertaining 
sequences amidst all the muddle. </P>
<P>Based on the hit television series of yesteryear, Tom Cruise plays Ethan 
Hunt, an able protege of veteran IMF (as in Impossible Mission Force) agent 
Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), and along with Phelps's team of undercover 
operatives, they attempt to capture a Russian agent with plans to steal a 
disc containing the identities of American agents stationed in Europe. Whew! 
Of course, something invariably goes wrong with Phelps's master plan and it 
is up to Hunt and a surviving female operative (Emanuelle Beart from "Nelly 
and Monsieur Arnaud") to uncover the enemy who may be a former IMF agent. </P>
<P>The movie begins to lose track of an always intriguing premise - corruption 
at the heart of an organization, which in this case is the IMF. There are 
multiple twists upon twists upon some clever turns, and lots of latex 
disguises courtesy of ILM. The elaborate plot does become a bit confusing 
after awhile, but at least we have action scenes to marvel at. </P>
<P>There are two terrific action setpieces that are as thrilling and enticing as 
anything I've seen since 1993's "The Fugitive." In one spectacular sequence, 
Hunt descends froma ceiling onto a computer room which has a heat sensitive 
alarm that can be triggered if the room temperature is above 98 degrees. This 
sequence is filled with unbridled tension thanks to director De Palma's 
uncanny choice of camera shots and editing strategies. The sequence, though, 
works mainly because the soundtrack is filled with such utter, complete silenc
e that all you can hear is Hunt's drops of sweat. </P>
<P>Another titillating sequence occurs when the impenetrable Hunt is fighting 
the villains on top of a super speeding train, which is also dragging a 
helicopter. Scenes like this give "Mission: Impossible" an edge that 
literally keeps you on the edge of your seat. </P>
<P>The ultimate flaw in "Mission" is that the plot is so convoluted that we stop 
caring about certain characters, including Phelps (a far too restrained Jon 
Voight) and the luminous Emanuelle Beart (Phelp's wife), both of whom become 
as one-note as you can expect. This is really Cruise's show all the way (he 
is also the producer) and he inhabits every single scene, making the 
character of Ethan Hunt knowing, charismatic, witty and resourceful, like 
just about every other character Cruise has played.  I can't imagine anyone 
else playing the role with the same level of sincerity - if only he would age 
a bit. This often feels like "Risky Business" crossed with the James Bond 
genre. </P>
<P>Cruise has some able support from bald-headed Ving Rhames ("Pulp Fiction"), 
Jean Reno ("The Professional"), whose character has the tools to break into 
any security system, Henry Czerny as the coldly calculating IMF chief, and 
the wonderfully restrained Vanessa Redgrave (!) as some kind of underground 
mastermind. There is also a funny, unbilled cameo by Emilio Estevez. Only 
Voight and Beart seem to be sleepwalking through the proceedings. </P>
<P>Another plus is veteran director Brian De Palma who does a professionally 
slick job fo directing, though his trademark style of nervous energy is 
largely absent this time. For better or worse, "Mission: Impossible" is 
fitfully exciting, electrifying nonsense...and terribly confusing and 
impossible to follow.</P>
