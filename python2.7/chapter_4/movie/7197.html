<PRE>                       TURBO: A POWER RANGERS MOVIE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     At what point does a film get so bad that it becomes good?  Where
does sloppy workmanship end and parody begin?  One could argue that a
film can only be classified as a parody if that was the director's
original intent.  TURBO: A POWER RANGERS MOVIE tests these definitional
limits to the fullest.</P>
<P>     Let's establish a benchmark.  The first Power Rangers movie,
MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE MOVIE, was a fairly poor movie, but
it did have a minimal plot, a few memorable snippets of dialog, and
some likable teenage stars.  TURBO: A POWER RANGERS MOVIE, the second,
and we can only hope last, of the Power Rangers movies has almost no
plot, an awful script, and lifeless acting.  It ranks way below the
first in quality.</P>
<P>     (TURBO attempts to mimic the STAR WARS trilogy, especially RETURN
OF THE JEDI, and thereby ride its wave of success.  The opening credits
roll by in the same fashion, the new wizard character called Lerigot
looks like a cross between an Ewok and a Smurf, Lerigot lives in the
woods like the Ewoks, turbo power thrusts the new Zords forward like a
jump to light speed, Alpha 5 antics are similar to those of C3PO,
Divatox's skimpy outfit is like Princess Leia's harem outfit, and the
list goes on.)</P>
<P>     As soon as you see the wizard, you will become convinced this must
be a parody.  His small torso has a huge head with splotchy lavender
and gold hair and beard.  His hands and feet look like something from a
cheap Halloween costume.  Overall, the outfit would be rejected as too
unrealistic even for a theme park character.  To top it off, his walk
consists of little more than a rubbery waddle.</P>
<P>     To keep the attention of the upper end of the intended
demographics of the Power Ranger audience, the prepuberty set, the film
has women in revealing outfits and men with bulging muscles.  The
female Power Rangers wear skimpy shorts, and the lead evil woman,
Divatox, has a bulging bosom combined with a low-cut outfit.  One could
argue that the costumes are to keep the adults awake, but knowing how
much my 8-year-old liked the aforementioned harem outfit, I suspect the
filmmakers were going after the preteen group.</P>
<P>     Since the Power Rangers are rumored to be paid minimal wages, the
cast keeps changing.  This time the teenagers, who look in their 20s
now, are: Adam Park (Johnny Yong Bosch), Tanya Sloan (Nakia Burrise),
Rocky DeSantos (Steve Cardenas), Katherine Hillard (Catherine
Sutherland), and, the longest running member of the series, Tommy
Oliver (Jason David Frank).  Coming back for a special appearance this
time are Jason Lee Scott (Austin St. John) and my favorite Kimberly
Hart (Amy Jo Johnson).  As always, Eugene 'Skull' Skullovich (Jason
Narvy) and Farkus 'Bulk' Bulkmeir (Paul Schrier), return as the heroes
of the terminally stupid.</P>
<P>     The Power Rangers main purpose lies not in saving the world but in
moving merchandise.  To that end, the show has the obligatory new
Zords.  This time they are Turbo Zords that are fast automobiles with
rocket ship interiors.  They can go on land or sea and can,
undoubtedly, be purchased at your local toy store.</P>
<P>     There are exactly two interesting parts of the film.  First, they
let a 10-year-old, Justin (Blake Foster), become a Power Ranger.  This
lets the young audience identify more with the story.  Second, Jason
and Kimberly are put under a spell and become bad for a bit.  Since
this is one of the few times that they are permitted to escape their
bland demeanors, it is a refreshing change.</P>
<P>     The script by Shell Danielson and Shuki Levy has no imagination
and little taste.  The charm of the series is the focus on the
teenagers, but they are lifeless in this movie version.  With an
audience of young kids, do we have to have Divatox say, "Hells Bells,
what is going on now,"  and Justin say, "Come on - we got to get our
butts in those cars."  Were these added just to insure the picture
would not get the believed to be less bankable G rating?</P>
<P>     As the picture finally ended, I found myself musing about poor Amy
Jo Johnson.  I wondered if, when she was on the set, she was hoping
that some producer would see this show, find her hidden talent and save
her from having to do this anymore.</P>
<P>     "Wow, this is fun," Justin tells us.  Well, I'm glad he had a good
time.  Personally, I had hoped the picture would have been at least as
good as the first Power Rangers film.  Even that minimal request was
not granted.  Still, with a little editing and a few script changes,
I could turn this picture into a great parody.  Look out AIRPLANE!</P>
<P>     TURBO: A POWER RANGERS MOVIE runs about 1:35.  It is rated PG for
cartoonish violence.  Parents with kids under six should be warned that
possible frightening scenes include a bloody wound, a fall off of a
rocky cliff, a few monsters straight out of ALIENS, and a volcano.  My
son Jeffrey, almost 8, loved the picture, but I hated it.  However,
because it was merely boring but not painful to watch, I do give a
single star.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
