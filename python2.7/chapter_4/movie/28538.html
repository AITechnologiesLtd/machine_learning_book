<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A reworking of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo (61)." This Italian made western,
filmed in Spain, began the craze of so-called Spaghetti Westerns. Clint
Eastwood plays 'The Man With No Name,' in the first of the three films
made with the same theme (the others were: "For a Few Dollars More"(65)
and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" (1966)). Clint was on TV doing the
Rawhide series and jumped at the chance to go to Europe to make these
films when both James Coburn and then Charles Bronson were offered the
parts by director Sergio Leone, but wanted more than the $15,000
available. The films became popular in Europe where Clint became a big
star, and three years later United Artists bought all three of 'The Man
With No Name' films and showed them with great success in America. The
film is a no message one, where violence is glorified by the hero who is
as amoral as the villains. This kind of attitude changed the way
Westerns were made. It's an entertaining film, gore and all, its only
drawbacks being the poor dubbing job and that Leone hasn't perfected all
his moves yet in a smooth way. Yet this film, not as rewarding as his
others, still has the style of the director's later works, plus the same
themes of graphic violence, a laconic hero, and the thrill of gunfights
galore.</P>
<P>Clint arrives in the dusty Mexican border town of San Miguel where
visitors just don't come without wanting something illegal. An old
bell-ringer tells the newcomer that in this town folks get to be either
rich or dead. Clint while riding through town on his mule is shot at by
the gunmen of the Baxter clan. He soon learns from bartender Silvanito
(Pepe Calvo) that there are two warring gangs in town: the Baxters and
the Rojos. They control the gunrunning and liquor business, and are in
an uneasy truce. The Baxters consist of: Sheriff John Baxter (Wolfgang
Lukschy), his shrewd business attuned wife Consuela (Margarita Lozano)
and their dumb son Antonio (Bruno Carotenuto). The rivals are the Rojo
brothers: Ramon (Gian Maria Volonté), Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp) and
Benito (Antonio Prieto). Their most trusted gunman is Chico (Brega).
Both sides have many hired guns, but the Rojo family is the stronger
clan. Clint decides he's clever enough to play them off one against the
other, and try to get all the money he can from both sides. He hires
himself out with the Rojos, and to earn his pay he kills the gunmen who
shot at him. Clint chomps at the end of his cigar without smoking it,
says little, wears a Mexican poncho, and is always with his trusted
.45s. He makes an imposing figure, as he's tall, bearded, and mean
looking.</P>
<P>Clint sees the possibility of big money coming his way when he witnesses
Ramon Rojo and his gang kill a Mexican calvary unit for their gold. He
steals two calvary corpses and tells each side to watch out for the
other, and thereby gets them into a shooting war. This results in lots
of corpses for the friendly coffin maker in town. But this scene was
shot in a shoddy way, as it was hard to comprehend that the two gangs
were so stupid that they would so easily believe that the stiffs they
were fighting over were real.</P>
<P>Clint does a good deed by rescuing the beautiful Marisol (Koch), who is
being held hostage by Ramon. He slays the Rojo gunmen guarding her and
returns her to her son and husband. For this he gets tortured by Ramon,
but escapes to watch the Rojo brothers burn down the Baxter house and
kill all of them. Then Clint returns to get into a shootout with the
Rojos, saving Ramon for last. He then rides off with the gold, instead
of with the pretty girl.</P>
<P>In this Western parody, there's some humor behind all the choreographed
violence and there's also a passable Ennio Morricone's score to instill
a sense of melodrama. What makes this mythical film noteworthy, is that
it serves an historical purpose as the start of a new trend in making
Westerns.</P>
