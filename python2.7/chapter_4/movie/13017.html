<P>    Mike Chuhutsky is a good-looking, fairly bright guy trying to get by in
Los Angeles. Sometimes he teaches tennis to wealthy matrons. Sometimes he
lays carpet. Sometimes he deals drugs.</P>
<P>It's only in this last enterprise that he loses his wits. He and his
unstable friend Pete pick up a stash of cocaine to deliver to a major
dealer; when the kingpin's back is turned, the duo steal some of the product
to sell themselves. The plan goes awry, Pete escapes and Mike is left to
learn the hard way that small-time hustlers have less to fear from the
police than they do from the higher-ups in their own line of work.</P>
<P>"Mike's Murder" is an unorthodox thriller that's less concerned with
scaring viewers than it is with building a carefully controlled atmosphere
of menace. Despite the movie's lurid-sounding title, director James Bridges
is less concerned with the crime than with the repercussions it has on
Mike's on-again, off-again lover, a bank teller named Betty Ann Parrish
(Debra Winger).</P>
<P>Aside from a mutually satisfying one-night-stand and some half-hearted
phone sex, Betty and Mike's relationship barely exists. Multiple months pass
between their few encounters. But when Mike is slain in what his cohorts
call an "enforcement killing," the usually unadventurous Betty finds herself
drawn into an L.A. subculture where appearances mean a lot and money means
everything. Mike's associates chop up their cocaine with gold razor blades
and lounge around beside Olympic-size swimming pools ringed by Roman
sculptures when they're not racing from deal to deal in pricey sportscars.</P>
<P>Everyone -- Betty included -- seems to build their lives around their
car and their phone. An answering machine becomes Betty's primary link to
the outside world, and when she's not at home listening to messages or
waiting for calls, Betty is on the road, looking for people she's talked to
on the phone. The characters in "Mike's Murder" often seem to be
half-sleepwalking, drifting aimlessly until the rare times they bump into
something that excites or arouses them. It's as if most of the movie was
taking place during those  early-evening/after-work hours when you're almost
running on empty, unsure of whether to take a nap or to start dinner.</P>
<P>Winger, saddled with playing a woman who's more often reactive than
active, does everything she can to bring Betty to life and to uncover some
glimmers of personality in a shallowly written part. The strongest
performance in the movie, however, comes from Darryl Larson as the jittery
cokehead Pete. His is a truly eerie portrait of a man barely living on the
edge.  As Mike, Mark Keyloun doesn't exert the kind of magnetism that would
make Betty a slave to his charms, a flaw which leaves the movie with a
hollow center.</P>
<P>What does come across in "Mike's Murder" is a beautifully evoked,
vaguely creepy atmosphere that hangs over every scene. The crime that sets
the story in motion remains unsolved at the end, and perhaps that's how it
should be. It's not important who really killed Mike Chuhutsky, Bridges
seems to be saying. Not when it's so obvious what killed him.
