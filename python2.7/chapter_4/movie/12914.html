<P>This is a fun movie.  Harrison Ford, as Quinn Harris),  has never been more
charmingly delightful.  His grin is wide . . . and small wonder: he is playing
opposite Anne Heche (as Robin Monroe) who pulls out all the stops; everyone is
going to love her pixielike smile.  For those in showbiz who worried about
Ellen DeGeneres' girlfriend playing the love interest with Quinn Harris
(Harrison Ford): relax!   Both are terrific actors who light up the screen
when the two are kissing, wrestling or just gazing at each other.</P>
<P>Frank, (David Schwimmer) is just right as the man engaged to marry Robin.
He is a nice, try-hard-to-be-faithful, fianc‚.   True, he has a real battle
on his hands when the very sexy Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors) invites him
to spend the night with her when Robin and Quinn disappear in the storm. Of
course, things happen to make life not that easy but hey, this is the movie
world. Michael Browning wrote a laugh a minute script that sparkles with
humor and keeps the film  entertaining just about every moment.</P>
<P>Robin is an editor for a New York magazine.  David has surprised her with
tickets to a remote Pacific island where they are to have the time of their
lives relaxing on vacation.    Shortly after their arrival, she receives an
urgent call from her boss, Marjorie (Allison Janney) who does not take "no"
for an answer. Robin must come home for just one day to handle an
emergency.</P>
<P>Robin learns the quickest way to get back to New York is to fly to
another island on a little island-hopper of a plane piloted by an
unlikely-looking pilot, Quinn Harris.    At this point writer Browning has
the weather enter the picture. An unexpected storm comes up resulting in a
crash landing on a remote uninhabited island. . . and the fun begins. The
fun even includes pirates.</P>
<P>This all made for a most entertaining evening.</P>
