<P>     Film maker Laurent Chevalier has chosen a unique, perhaps 
unprecedented, manner of adapting Laye Camara's 1953 autobiography, 
L'ENFANT NOIR.  Using Camara's real-life family, Chevalier has re-
created the key events of the novel, transposing the time to modern-day 
Africa.  The story concerns how young Baba Camera adjusts to life in the 
city of Conakry after growing up in the small village of Kouroussa.  </P>
<P>     Actually, there are arguments why this film might have been better-
suited to the documentary format (indeed, the voiceover and camera style 
are like those of a documentary).  The narrative is stark and simple, 
with little or no dramatic content.  Character development is minimal.  
Chevalier is more interested in presenting themes and ideas about change 
across Africa, culture shock, and the maturation of a boy in a changing 
world.  Because of the weak dramatic structure, however, most of this 
film feels more like a treatise or an essay than a story.  The most 
interesting aspect of THE AFRICAN CHILD is its insight into a culture 
that most viewers will be unfamiliar with.</P>
<P>     Elements of THE AFRICAN CHILD are fascinating, but few of the best 
aspects have much to do with Baba's brush with adulthood.  Idrissa 
Ouedraogo's film, THE CRY OF THE HEART, tells a similar story in a more 
satisfying fashion -- it has emotional depth to go along with its 
thematic strength.  THE AFRICAN CHILD piques the intellectual centers of 
the mind, but rarely touches the heart.  It works as an examination of 
the changing nature of life in Africa, and as a contrast between cities 
and underdeveloped villages, but those aims might have been accomplished 
more effectively in a different, and shorter, medium.</P>
