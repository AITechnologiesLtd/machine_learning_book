<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Joseph Conrad's greatest contribution to cinema will undoubtedly be
his novel "Heart Of Darkness", crafted by Francis Ford Coppola into
the visionary landmark masterpiece APOCALYPSE NOW.  At long last, his
works are currently undergoing a mild cinematic revival -- last year
saw his novel "The Secret Agent", filmed earlier by Alfred Hitchcock
as SABOTAGE, make a return to the screen as Christopher Hampton's
sophomore directorial effort, and 1997 brings about a big-budget
adaptation of his novella "Amy Foster" to the silver screen, retitled
as SWEPT FROM THE SEA and helmed by Beeban Kidron.</P>
<P>It's understandable that the filmmakers chose to go with the title of
SWEPT BY THE SEA for their period romance over the film's original
shooting title, which retained the title of the original source --
not only is it a literal description of the early pivotal moment
which sets the film in motion, but it's inherently more cinematic and
has a greater echo of lush romanticism than the rather staid and
mannered tone implied by "Amy Foster".  The film is in any case more
intently focused upon Yanko Gooral (Vincent Perez), the solitary
survivor of a Ukrainian shipwreck who washes ashore by the rural
Cornish village of Colebrook, than it is interested in Amy Foster
(Rachel Weisz), whose premarital conception has rendered her an
outcast in said village, and whose use of silence as a defense
mechanism is perceived by townsfolk as evidence of simplemindedness.
It's a good thing that Yanko is the central character of the film,
for in SWEPT BY THE SEA, Amy Foster is a dullard -- bland and
uninteresting.</P>
<P>It doesn't help matters that Ms. Weisz is astonishingly flat and
lifeless in the female lead role.  Amy Foster is a character who
shields her passions behind a wall of cold remoteness, but Ms.
Weisz's performance in the majority of the film is simply
expressionless, with a mild hint of irritability; there is no
indication of any sort of restraint on the part of her character or
any sense of inner turmoil, while her handful of emotionally volatile
scenes are ineffective and lack credibility.</P>
<P>Ms. Weisz's performance is *so* awkward that it saps the life out of
the standard-issue romance between Yanko and Amy, and actually begins
to get in the way of the more interesting and better-developed
relationship between Yanko and Dr. Kennedy (Ian McKellen), the kindly
gentleman who first recognizes Yanko's intelligence and becomes his
mentor.  Given that SWEPT FROM THE SEA is positioned as a romantic
epic, this is near-disasterous -- one would like to hope that the
romantic relationship might be the interesting one in the film,
rather than a cumbersome nuisance.</P>
<P>The friendship between Dr. Kennedy and Yanko, though a familiar
retread, is nicely portrayed with a sense of warmth and compassion.
Mr. McKellen is typically strong, subtly introducing some conflict
and complexity into an otherwise saintly character, while Mr. Perez
turns in a capable performance as the ridiculously good-natured
outsider with only modest aspirations who is nonetheless subjected to
relentless xenophobic malevolence by the villagers.  SWEPT FROM THE
SEA clearly attempts to address the theme of persecution -- both of
the leads are outcasts, brought together by small acts of kindness
and compassion rarely found elsewhere in their daily existence -- but
it's handled rather heavy-handedly, and the film starts to become
increasingly absurd with Yanko's continued attempts to integrate
himself into the Cornish society by coming across as innocuous,
gamely putting forth a brave face and flashing a goofy, bizarrely
sheepish grin in the face of such loathing and hatred.</P>
<P>Tim Willocks' screenplay draws out the characters in SWEPT FROM THE
SEA in extremely broad strokes, with none of the characters remotely
enigmatic in their intentions or disposition.  As in most unabashedly
romantic and gushingly melodramatic films, the shallowly-depicted
characters neatly fall into one of two camps: heroic and sympathetic,
or eminently hissable, and while easily identifiable heroes and
villains are a staple for the genre, there is little excuse for Mr.
Willocks' lame, uneven plotting. The film completely lacks the
cathartic dramatic punch with Amy's redeeming acts during the
climactic third act that is sorely needed -- granted, Ms. Weisz's
unempathic performance doesn't help either -- and employs devices
throughout the film which are clearly intended to be cute or magical,
such as the scenes of Dr. Kennedy's introduction to Yanko's
chess-playing abilities and Amy's secret hideaway, but merely come
off as silly or goofy.  An early scene in SWEPT BY THE SEA is
particularly ineffective; while intended as a tender moment between
Amy and Yanko as the outsiders first meet, neither of the characters
have been sufficiently drawn out at this point for the audience to
have any vested interest in their fates, and consequently the
sequence loses its power and appears excessively cliched and
melodramatic.</P>
<P>Technically, SWEPT FROM THE SEA is a handsome film.  The sound work
by George Richards is superb, particularly in the shipwreck sequence
and the storm sequence, while Dick Pope's cinematography is crisp,
sharp, and striking.  However, John Barry's bleating score becomes
rather tiresome and doesn't meld well with the film.</P>
<P>What is perhaps most striking about SWEPT FROM THE SEA is its utter
conviction in its material; the film is terribly earnest, and plays
with complete sincerity.  While the plot of the film is familiar and
the romance is squandered, resulting in a historical saga which is at
best mediocre, it is the film's complete faith in the ardour and
fascination of its story which succeeds in sustaining viewer
interest.</P>
