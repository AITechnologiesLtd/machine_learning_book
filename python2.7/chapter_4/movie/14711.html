<P>Urban Legend surprised me. Based on the last few films the genre has
produced (including but not exclusive to the likes of I Know What You Did
Last Summer, Disturbing Behavior and the disappointing Halloween: H20), I
was positive that I was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly
and ultimately boring rehash of the Scream phenomena. Thankfully, Legend
rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip, scary and stylish
entertainment, but also what will probably become one of the best films of
the year. </P>
<P>You're all familiar with the plot; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get
systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not
revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be, you
guessed it; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks...the only
person you didn't suspect! </P>
<P>However, just because Legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as
literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't
qualify as first-class entertainment. It was, believe it or not, one of the
funnest times I've had at the movies all year. </P>
<P>The thing is, I'm not really sure what made this particular stab (pardon
the pun) at the genre seem so fresh and alive. Maybe it was the above-par
performances by the movie's two leads (Jared Leto and "Cybil" actress
Alicia Witt). Or, it could have been the on- target direction by Jamie
Blanks. More likely, though, it was because of the inspired premise. I
don't think I need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban
folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman. </P>
<P>Urban Legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic Scream
opener, not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an
absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film. A pretty young coed is
driving down a deserted road when (gasp!) a gas problem (hee-hee) forces
her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill. One problem,
though. Would you want to stop at a station run by Brad Dourif? I thought
not. Predictably, the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building
to sort out a problem with the credit card company. It's odd, though, when
you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line. Naturally,
the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off. And the when we
least expect it...WHACK!!! A decapitation. It turns out that the creepy
looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back
seat of the car. </P>
<P>So who is it this time? The obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter
professor at the college the girl went to (none other than Freddy Kruger
himself, Robert Englund), who teaches a class on urban legends. A-ha. Or
could it be the fame-hungry local journalist (Leto) looking for a meaty
story to put on his resume? Like all movies of this nature, one of the
chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit. And it turns out to be, of
course, the one you didn't suspect. </P>
<P>I'm not going to pretend Urban Legend is anything more than it is, but I
must give credit where credit is due. And this flick definitely deserves
credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been...fun. </P>
