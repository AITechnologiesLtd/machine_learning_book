<P>Susan Granger's review of "BREAD AND TULIPS" (First Look Pictures)</P>
<P>    In this delightfully frothy Italian romantic comedy, after
accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her
cranky husband and two cynical teenagers, Rosalba (Licia Maglietta), an unhappy
housewife from Pescara, finds herself - and love - in Venice. </P>
<P>    For the first time in years, Rosalba's on her own when she's
abandoned at a highway rest area. Although her philandering husband (Antonio
Catania), a plumbing-supply dealer, orders her to stay there until she's picked
up, she impulsively accepts a ride to Venice, a bohemian paradise which she's
never visited. Rosalba finds refuge and romance with Fernando (Bruno Ganz), a
gruff Icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and
prepares breakfast for her each morning. To support herself, she gets a job
working with a florist (Antonio Catania). </P>
<P>      Film-maker Silvio Soldini gently explores the blossoming of this
bored, middle-aged, middle-class woman with warmth and affection, savoring
special moments such as when Rosalba starts playing the accordion again and
abandons her maroon stretch pants, silver jacket and orange sneakers for a
simple, new red-and-white dress with platform-soled espadrilles. The superb
actors slip into their roles seamlessly, particularly luminous Licia Maglietta
and low-key Bruno Ganz, along with Marina Massironi as her nosy
massage-therapist neighbor and Giuseppe Massironi as the inept
plumber-turned-private eye who's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic
husband - who's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his
laundry or cleaning the house. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bread and
Tulips" is a beguiling, escapist 8. As the summer ends, it's a magical getaway
for mature audiences..</P>
