<P>   Dogs in movies can be awfully cute but they do not often
steal the show.  When they do, the film is in trouble.  The
humor in even the funniest movie of the year so far, "Best in
Show," comes from the eccentric owners of the terriers and
hounds and other breeds and not from the four-legged
creatures who are primped and primed for the canine
competition of the year.  So when you hear that Beefy, the
talking bulldog in the latest Adam Sandler vehicle, draws the
one or two laughs that the Steven Brill's film evokes, you
know you're in for the kind of audience hell that the
filmmakers did not have in mind.</P>
<P>   To my mind, Sandler's only successful picture was "The
Wedding singer," because Frank Coraci's 1998 film is imbued
with Drew Barrymore's charm and has the grace to tell a
solid, heartwarming story during its 96-minute run.  By
contrast, "Little Nicky" is a patched-together quilt of Saturday
Night Live sketches featuring some embarrassing skits by
members of that TV troupe, especially by Jon Lovitz as a
peeping Tom who is blasted by a kid's sling shot while
pretending to be Big Bird and who plummets immediately
down to hell.</P>
<P>   While Steven Brill's concept of Hades offers a traditional,
Dante-esque view not in keeping with the Church's
contemporary interpretations, the place does seem more
interesting than the heaven which is rendered toward the
conclusion of the story.  A power struggle is in progress that
brings to mind the Gore-Bush election tussle.  Like Marcus
Aurelius in Ridley Scott's "Gladiator," Satan (Harvey Keitel)
seems about to leave his post, but after all, his is a reign
longer than those of Fidel Castro and Queen Victoria
combined. When he decides that a 10,000-year rule is merely
an internship and announces that he will stay on, his two
sons Adrian (Rhys Ifans) and Cassius (Tom Lister Jr.) decide
to overthrow him by escaping from hell into the bowels of
New York City. Talk about frying pan into fire!  But a third
son, Nicky (Adam Sandler)--like Shakespeare's Cordelia--
loves his dad and is determined to save him.  Satan is in the
throes of a progressive deterioration of body parts.  Nicky
must head to New York--his first visit to Earth-- to entice the
two wayward fellows into a bottle within a week to make
Satan's body whole once again.</P>
<P>   As though ingressing from another movie, Rodney
Dangerfield appears from time to time to complain that "even
in hell I get no respect."  Dana Carvey is almost
unrecognizable in the role of a possessed basketball referee
who at one point has members of the Harlem Globetrotters
banging their heads against a wall (funny, funny) and political
incorrectness holds sway when a blind preacher (Quentin
Tarantino) storms and rages down 42nd Street and a group
of wheelchair-bound athletes tear out from their basketball
game to chase Nicky--who has been framed as a mass-
murderer.  A couple of silly skits featuring Adolph
Hitler in drag trivializes National Socialism.</P>
<P>   The obligatory computer generation takes the form of a
powerful stream of steamy dog urine and only a single
instance of vomit.  Nicky's goodness is reflected in two
characters; Patricia Arquette in a Mia Farrow-esque role as
the object of his affection, and Reese Witherspoon as the
leader of a band of angels who all talk like Valley girls.</P>
<P>   A hell of a ride?  No way.  Crude and vulgar?  Fine.  But
unfunny? Inexcusable.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 86 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
