<PRE>                               JACOB'S LADDER
                       A film review by Serdar Yegulalp
                        Copyright 1997 Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<PRE>CAPSULE: </PRE>
<P>JACOB'S LADDER is a horror film in the purest sense of the word: it
horrifies us, not just with what we see, but with what we come to
understand about what we see. Most horror films are about death, or more
recently, the giving and receiving of violent pain. LADDER is about life
*and* death, which is what sets it so far above almost every other horror
movie ever made. It drains the viewer dry, emotionally and viscerally, but
does it with real feeling and technical virtuosity.</P>
<P>Tim Robbins plays a young man named Jacob Singer, and we learn about his
life in quick, hard flashes. He was married once and had a child, but then
was sent to Vietnam and had some unspeakable experiences there that
crippled him in spirit. Now, back in the States, he works in New York City
at the post office and has a girlfriend (Elizabeth Pena, in a very good and
very difficult role).</P>
<P>Jacob is obviously intelligent and gifted, but his psychic scars from the
war (where he obviously did not belong) are ripping open on him. ("After
'Nam I didn't want to think," he says.) He's seeing demonic creatures in
broad daylight. Maybe he's suffering from post-traumatic stress flashbacks.
Or drug-induced hallucinations. All he knows is that he's scared.</P>
<P>Things get even odder. One of his former war buddies dies in what seems to
be a car-bombing, but not before dropping hints that perhaps the bunch of
them were guinea pigs for some kind of experimental drug in 'Nam. And then
things become even more horrific. He remembers being wounded in the war and
getting on a medevac copter, but... </P>
<P>>From about the 40-minute mark on out, the movie stakes out territory that I
have not seen any other movie attempt successfully -- at least not to the
level of emotional purity that this movie does. We are not passively
observing Jacob Singer's mental breakdown (if indeed that's what's
happening): we're sharing it. Jacob's state of mind is the real theme of
the movie, and it's reflected in the nervous editing rhythm that takes over
in some of the scenes. Sometimes we're not totally sure how we got from one
scene to the next -- there are several flashbacks to his earlier family
life that don't make sense the first time we see them but that disentangle
themselves later -- but we never feel like the movie doesn't know what's
going on.</P>
<P>Tim Robbins is never less than excellent in showing us Jacob, a man whose
intelligence is not going to provide him with an answer to anything he
sees. The real answer is in his feelings. Also, I mentioned Elizabeth Pena
has a tough job to do in this movie, perhaps no less difficult than
Robbins'. She plays a smart, rather headstrong character who only has a
limited amount of patience, but plenty of love, and there are some scenes
where she has to walk a fine line between being selfish and being
blunt-nosed. Danny Aiello also has an interesting supporting role, as a
gentle chiropracter, who offers an occasional word of advice to Jacob.</P>
<P>So much of the movie cannot be discussed here without ruining it, because
up until the very end we are given one way of interpreting what we see. And
then the final scene arrives and changes *everything*, and provokes a very
uncomfortable question: What is all of life, anyway, but perhaps a kind of
desperate squirming in the face of a dead universe? And how do the dead
know that they *are* dead? The final shot, the more you think about it, may
even open more doors than it closes. JACOB'S LADDER may very well be the
first real thinking man's horror movie.</P>
