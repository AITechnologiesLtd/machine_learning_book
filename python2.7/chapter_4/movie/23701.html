<P>     It took five months for BOYS DON'T CRY finally to make its way to
Utah. Five months of bumped release dates (at least partially due to an
attitude, voiced by an unnamed Fox Searchlight representative, that "gay
films don't play there"). Five months of growing hype over the remarkable
transformation in the performance of Hilary Swank, who became a Best
Actress nominee as expected. Five months of building expectations for one
of the best-received independent films of the year, based on a compelling
true story. And after five months, plenty of opportunity for the film
itself to fall dangerously short of everything I wanted it to be.</P>
<P>     BOYS DON'T CRY is not a great piece of film craftsmanship. It's a
performance showcase, and a very effective one. The surprise, however, is
that the real showcase performance isn't the most talked-about one. Swank
stars as Teena Brandon, a native of Lincoln, Nebraska whose sexual
identity has always been a source of trouble for her. After numerous
run-ins with the law and fellow residents outraged by her behavior, Teena
flees Lincoln for the small town of Falls City. There she re-invents
herself as Brandon Teena, a young man travelling through town who falls in
with a group of aimless young people, including ex-cons John Lotter (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Tom Nissen (Brendan Sexton III) and John's 
sort-of-girlfriend Lana Tisdel (Chloe Sevigny). Brandon instantly becomes
attracted to Lana, and finds her receptive to his interest. But secrets
have a way of coming out, and when they do, Brandon faces dangerous
repercussions.</P>
<P>     At the center of the story, of course, is the mystery of
Brandon/Teena -- who he was, how so many people were fooled, what
Brandon's transformation represented as both threat and promise to the
other people involved in the story. Swank's physical performance is
superb, made even more effective by co-writer/director Kimberly Peirce's
decision to introduce Brandon already in male guise so the switch doesn't
become a showy trick. But it's hard not to be more impressed with the
physical performance than with what's going underneath it. There are
moments when you see the awkwardness of a girl trying to be one of the
guys, and moments in the harrowing final half hour when you see her
peering in terror through the cracks in her reality. More often, Brandon
is an enigmatic catalyst. It seems as though Peirce is more interested in
what Brandon stands for than in the person that was Brandon Teena.</P>
<P>     The upside to that perspective is that one of those people is Lana,
played with unnerving effectiveness by Chloe Sevigny. Lana is in her way a
more fascinating character than Brandon -- she engages in just as much
self-delusion, but her motivations are more complex. Sevigny plays the
small town girl with a dissolute resignation that gradually becomes faint
hope for a better life. It's the sort of role most actresses would play
initially with hard-edged bluster before unveiling the heart of gold
beneath; Sevigny shows a slightly different perspective of Lana every time
she turns around.</P>
<P>     Sevigny is part of a superb supporting cast, with Sarsgaard and
Sexton similarly refusing to play their parts for easy interpretation. 
The entire milieu of the Falls City youth has a heartbreaking genuineness
to it -- particularly noteworthy is how Lana's mother becomes "Mom" to
everyone in their desperation for any family relationship -- and Peirce
does a fine job of using Brandon to explore the effect of a nonconformist
on a place where reality is assumed to be static. It's the idea that
Peirce uses Brandon at all that dampens the power of BOYS DON'T CRY,
however. The chilling resolution and wonderful supporting performances
make it easy to recommend BOYS DON'T CRY. I only wish that five months of
focus on Hilary Swank hadn't led me to expect it would be the story of
Brandon Teena.</P>
