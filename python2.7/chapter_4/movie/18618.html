<PRE>LIMBO
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>John Sayles (LONE STAR) is one of the world's best cinematic
storytellers.  Typically writing, directing and editing, as he did in
LIMBO, he makes movies the way he wants.  In a time of plodding plots
and silly scripts his works stands head and shoulders above most of the
others.  With meticulous stories containing heartfelt, but never
overdrawn, characters, his work has a subtle honesty that leaves you in
awe of his talent.</P>
<P>Sayles's movies have a strong sense of place and community.  LIMBO is
set in an Alaska populated with ambitious, boastful developers ("Think
of Alaska as one big theme park"), roaming bands of geriatric tourists
and average working class folk.  The latter is the subject of Sayles's
tale.</P>
<P>Joe Gastineau, played with an endearing reserve by Sayles veteran David
Strathairn, is -- or more accurately was -- a fisherman.  His last
girlfriend broke up with him for being "too downbeat."  He's a
middle-aged guy who has never married and doesn't feel the need to talk
about why.  He's the sort who keeps quiet as much because it's a part of
his nature as because there is anything to hide.</P>
<P>Lately he's been casting his glances toward a new singer in town, Donna
de Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  Donna's a single mom with a
high school daughter named Noelle (Vanessa Martinez).  Although mother
and daughter are both good people, sometimes it seems the only things
they have in common are their allergies.  Donna's allergic to wool and
Noelle is allergic to her mom's boyfriends.</P>
<P>Donna, who has sung in "36 states and the territory of Puerto Rico,"
appears to change lovers faster than states.  Dating guys with "loser"
written on their tattoos, she has sort of a reverse Midas touch when it
comes to men.  Still, she has her limits.  She brags that she has never
stooped so low as to date a drummer.</P>
<P>This time she has her eyes set on Joe, perhaps the only decent man she's
ever sought.  Her life has been coming apart at the seams lately, which
for her is pretty much status quo.  Joe looks like the type of gentleman
that might finally make the difference for her.</P>
<P>Sayles, a sublime stager of subtle movements, has Mastrantonio give a
knowing smile and raise her eyebrows in a tentative, furtive motion in
order to signify her romantic interests.  Later Joe and Donna will kiss
a few times, but nothing will surpass the erotic spark of that earlier
look she gives him.</P>
<P>The chemistry between these two very different types is genuine and
tender.  He loves the outdoors, but she warns him of her loathing for
it.  "Things where you wear gear rather than clothing, I don't do," she
explains.</P>
<P>The story's first half, which is a little too slow and cluttered with
extraneous characters and subplots, is full of ominous tales of horror.
Many scenes set at the town's bar have the locals talking about the
natural dangers of the area.  More fisherman than you can count have
"bought it" in a variety of horrific accidents that have cost them their
lives.  And then there's the winter.  Many end up blowing their brains
out through the depression caused by the cold, the unrelenting darkness
and the lack of gainful employment.</P>
<P>The second half of the story, when the inevitable tragedy strikes, is
when the film really comes into its own.  The three, Joe, Donna and
Noelle, form a sometimes contentious but deep bond during this section.
The story's emotional impact is intense even while the tragedy has an
undeniable tranquility to it.  The characters, which were well developed
in the first half, are finely polished in the last half.</P>
<P>The show's ending will be talked about for years.  Suffice it to say
that I thought it was absolutely perfect.  It is probably proof,
however, that Sayles doesn't test screen his movies or, if he does, he
promptly throws away the survey cards.</P>
<P>LIMBO runs 2:00.  It is rated R for some violence and a little profanity
and would be fine for kids 12 and up.</P>
