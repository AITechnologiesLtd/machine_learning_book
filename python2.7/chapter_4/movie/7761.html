<PRE>VOYAGE TO THE BEGGINING OF THE WORLD
(Viagem ao Principio do Mundo)</PRE>
<P>Manoel de Oliveira, the only living director in the world that comes way
back from the silent era of movies, presents to us his latest opus. This
time he goes for a semi-auto-biographic story, a journey to his childhood
and adolescence.
The action is entirely set in the extreme North of Portugal, in Alto Minho,
in villages like Caminha and Castro Laboreiro, visiting people and
landscapes that are in the beggining of the Portuguese World. Yes, right to
the beggining, because these lands belonged to the embryonic 'Condado
Portucalense', whose capital was Guimaraes, just a couple kilometers away.
Also, 'castro' is the word given to the first settled communities in
Portugal, even before the arrival of the Romans. Geographically speaking,
it is also the place where the portuguese territory begins, to those who
come from the north, and where the river Minho meets the vast ocean,
watched by Caminha and the spanish Mount of St. Tecla.
Rather curious is Oliveira's option to show us the city and the road by
putting the camera in the back of the car, facing the road behind (driven
by the real Manoel de Oliveira). The image is a obvious metaphor: the path
left behind is no other than every journey in life, all of the memories,
life itself.
Stoping near the mouth of the river (where it dies...), close to the ferry
pier, all the characters listen to Manoel/Mastroianni recalling his
childhood in a religious border school, on the other bank of the river, on
the other country. The fact is that the other country is much more than
just Spain. It's the memory of a past, that the river/time, restrains of
reaching. Someone gets a binocular. But the same way as looking at a
picture doesn't bring the past back, the binoculars just bring closer what
is far away. The river, like the road before, has a begginig and an end,
and in between those two points lays what is called journey. The characters
are real close to Spain, where the portuguese road ends and where the river
finds its grave in the sea. Two dead ends. But we can add a third one: the
own directors end, who has 86 glorious and adventurous years. Ironically,
Mastroianni, the actor who plays him, does his last perfomance here. The
title could well be "Close to the End of the World"...
In the movie, everybody knows that there is an end for everything. Is there
anything that survives? The answer seems to be negative. The 'Hotel do
Peso' lays in ruins and even memory has a lot of difficulty in rebuilding
it. The statue of Pedro Macau is still there, just like Atlas holding the
World on his back. And it also holds a part of the world of the director,
even if the statue had lost an arm...We can even wonder how many memories
isn't he still holding...And how many people still keep or have kept the
image of the statue as a reference? Who was Pedro Macau? Who put it there?
What is he doing there? Isn't this extension of life, what Kundera called
'Imortality'? In other words: can 'imortality' lay in the   perpetuity of
gestures, thoughts and images, passed from one to another, like a relay
race, this time called life.
The 'journey' reffered in the title, you guessed it, has several meanings.
If there is one journey to the beggining of the director's life, there is
also a journey of a french actor to the village that his portuguese father
had left when went to France.
The french actor had never been to Lusitanian lands, but his wish to know
the beggining of his world was stronger. He wants to meet his father's
hometown and the people he once knew. He wants to know how his father was,
how he behave and how he lived, because he died when the actor was still a
child. He is going to meet an old aunt, living in a recess place of a
village, that is lost both in time and space. It is an image of the old,
rustic and rural  Portugal, nowadays called 'real' by the politicians. A
way of calling 'typical', to what is just 'poor'... The little village is
made of grey stone, so harsh as the wrinkles in the faces of the old people
that still manage to survive. Has time stood still since his father's
departures? We almost say yes. But his aunt doesn't think that way. And she
is annoyed that being the actor her nephew, then "why doesn't he talks our
talk"? The fact is that what seemed cristalized, in fact, wasn't. 
The farewell is made at the graveyard. Everybody's last stop.
Life is a journey to be enjoyed and no matter our will to stop the time, we
never manage to do so. Our wish of eternity drives us mad and motivate us.
We're too important just to...disappear. But, just like the car on the
road, where what is back is gone, so it's life. Every little second that
has gone won't ever come back.  When that Journey comes to an end, it is
good to recall it. And if we don't have enough memories, we can always
appeal to those of other people, that even though they don't fulfill our
need,  they don't leave us empty.</P>
