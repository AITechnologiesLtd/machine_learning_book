LITTLE MAN TATE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>One of the surest ways for the Hollywood actors to win the
"Oscars" is playing the characters burdened with some
terrible affliction. On the other hand, serious dramatic
movies about the opposite - talented people - are quite
rare. LITTLE MAN TATE, 1991 directorial debut by Jodie
Foster is one of such films.</P>
<P>The movie deals with Fred Tate (played by Adam Hann-Byrd),
eight-year old child prodigy who is blessed with high IQ and
many talents, like mathematics, music and painting. For his
single mother and cocktail waitress Dede (Jodie Foster),
Fred is normal child that is supposed to have normal
childhood like everybody else. But, his intelligence has
estranged him from the peers in school, and, finally, it
brings attention of Dr. Jane Grierson (Diane Wiest),
psychologist specialised for gifted children. She wants Fred
to join her summer camp for gifted children. Dede
reluctantly agrees, but soon the tension would erupt between
her and Dr. Grierson, who wants Fred to have special
education, away from his mother.</P>
<P>In many ways, LITTLE MAN TATE has a lot of autobiographic
elements for Jodie Foster. She, same as the protagonist in
the movie, was a child prodigy, becoming a huge film star at
the age of twelve. But, unlike many other child stars, she
was intelligent enough to know that stardom doesn't last
forever and she temporarily left Hollywood in order to
finish proper education. Her return later led to the
triumph, with two "Oscars" for THE ACCUSED and SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS. Enjoying the great respect as one of the most
mature stars in Hollywood, her directorial debut was
universally praised by the critics. Perhaps, they went
overboard with praises - film is good, but it is basically
television drama material, with rather simplistic plot that
deals with the struggle between the heart (childhood) and
mind (adulthood). Scott Frank's script takes the side of
heart, often portraying the intelligent children as
obnoxious ("Math Magician", brilliantly played by P.J.
Ochlan) or their mentors as emotional cripples who lack the
ability to enjoy the life. The acting, on the other hand is
superb - Jodie Foster has a rather low key performance,
overshadowed by young Adam Hann-Byrd and always reliable
Dianne Wiest. Many of the actors in short, but effective
scenes, manage to overcome the limitations of the weak
script. Foster as director, on the other hand, is quite
capable to make this film entertaining and touching despite
its flaws. In its time, Foster was praised for her debut.
Now she should be praised even more, because GOOD WILL
HUNTING, more recent and more acclaimed film dealing with
the same subject, really pales compared with LITTLE MAN
TATE.</P>
