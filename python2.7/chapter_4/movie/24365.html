"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P> It's an ultra low-budget film about male siblings so, of course,
everyone is comparing Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish to The Brothers
McMullen.  And from some people's reaction to McMullen, that may not
really be such a good thing.</P>
<P>I liked McMullen, and Goat on Fire is pretty similar, both in terms of
story and unpolished look.  I saw the film as part of the Toronto
International Film Festival's Film Discovery Program (for best first
film), where it took home the top prize.  That's not really saying much
- I was there and the competition was as fierce as a de-clawed kitten.
>From what I remember hearing in Toronto, Goat on Fire was kind of
hurriedly transferred to 35mm for festival submission and, as a result,
the sound was a mess.  Hopefully this can and will be cleaned up for the
film's theatrical release.</P>
<P>Now onto the title, which you have to worry will scare off many a
potential viewer.  `Goat on Fire' and `Smiling Fish' are the nicknames
given to the film's two main characters by their Native American
grandmother (those of you that saw Smoke Signals, don't panic - Goat on
Fire isn't an `American Indian road movie').  Chris Remi (Derick
Martini) was dubbed `Goat on Fire' because he was a very serious,
uptight baby.  His brother Tony (Steven Martini, Derick's real-life
brother) earned the name `Smiling Fish' on account of his carefree,
fun-loving attitude as a kid.</P>
<P>But that was years ago.  As adults, Chris and Tony live together in a
modest L.A. home that they inherited from their parents, who died some
years ago in a car crash.  Chris, a tax accountant, is caught in a
horrendous relationship.  At least they tell me that it's a bad sign
when your girlfriend cries during sex.  Meanwhile, Tony is still an
untroubled, happy-go-lucky guy, living his life like he's still in high
school and struggling to find acting work.  Like when they were
children, Chris and Tony remain opposites as adults.</P>
<P>However, as the film progresses, Chris and Tony find their lives
abruptly altered by the introduction of new women into their lives.
Chris falls for an Italian animal wrangler named Anna (Rosemarie Addeo),
while Tony becomes involved with his mail carrier, an older single mom
(Christa Miller, The Drew Carey Show) with a nine-year-old daughter. And
- you guessed it - Chris learns how to become more easygoing, while Tony
is forced to learn how to settle down.</P>
<P>Goat on Fire was directed by Kevin Jordan, who co-wrote the script with
Derick Martini.  The original story was conceived by both Martini
brothers, with Derick producing and Steven providing the film's (often
annoying) narration.  It was shot in twelve days on a Blair Witch-sized
budget and, like McMullen, was filmed on location in the Martinis'
actual home.</P>
<P>Jordan's talent as a director is the standout star of Goat on Fire. Both
Martini brothers come off pretty likeable as actors, and Miller shows
that she can play more than `Kate' on Drew Carey.</P>
<P>Although it has nothing to do with my like or dislike of the film, I
have to point out that there were several `plants' in the audience
during the press/industry screening in Toronto.  Yeah, the film was
funny at times, but there were at least two people (strategically
located within the theatre) that laughed maniacally like DeNiro in Cape
Fear during the entire film.  The plants were often funnier that what
was happening on the screen.</P>
<P>1:30 - R for language, some sexual content, mild violence and brief drug
use</P>
