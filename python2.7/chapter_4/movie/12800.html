<P>The Opposite of Sex (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Screenwriter Don Roos (_Single_White_Female_) makes a wickedly
entertaining directorial debut with this wild, unflinching, and
aggressively un-P.C. black comedy.  An all-grown-up Christina Ricci plays
16-year-old hellion Dedee Truitt, who immediately up-ends a number of lives
after leaving her mother's home in Louisiana and shacking up with her gay
half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan) in Indiana.  In no time, Dedee seduces
Bill's young stud Matt (Ivan Sergei), gets knocked up, and takes off with
Matt to California with the ashes of Bill's dead lover in tow (make that
held hostage).  When Bill, Tom's busybody sister Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), and
town sheriff Carl (Lyle Lovett) follow their tracks, things get even
crazier...</P>
<P>...but never lighter.  Credit Roos for maintaining a scathing, pitch-black
tone from first frame to last.  There are times when events and characters
threaten to soften up, and just when you think the film begins to grow a
heart, it chews it up and spits it right back at you.  This is perfectly
exemplified by Dedee's tart, self-aware voiceover narration, which she uses
to add the audience to her victims: she identifies and savages all manner
of cinematic conventions and cliches only to use them as tools of
manipulation.  But meanness is just unpleasant if it isn't funny, and
Roos's script is full of delicious zingers that not only bite but draw
blood.  A lot of these are capably dished out by the better-than-ever
Ricci; however, the best lines come from the film's real star--and biggest
surprise: Kudrow, whose Oscar-caliber work shows she can do more than play
a ditz.  The incessantly nagging bitch that is Lucia is not only the
funniest in an ensemble of original, indelible, and well-played characters,
and she quite handily takes over and walks off with the movie.</P>
