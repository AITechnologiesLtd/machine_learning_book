<P>(This review makes a conscious attempt to avoid spoiling any surprises
contained within the film.)</P>
<P>One of the best jokes of Scream 2 was that the "movie" version of the "real"
events of the previous film was a typical, exploitational slasher flick.  It
served as a subtle reminder of the level this genre usually plays out at: a
stupid naked girl takes a shower and gets cut up.  The first two installments
in the Scream trilogy distinguished themselves as funny, smart and tense
thrillers.  Now the final (they swear) Scream has opened in theaters and while
it doesn't match the quality of the first two it still works as a slickly
crafted piece of entertainment, and plays out at a level far above the vast
majority of its genre predecessors.</P>
<P>The series has always done a nice job of developing its key characters as more
than one dimensional victims, survivors or potential killers.  The returning
characters have varied, believable, reactions to the infamous events of the
first two films.</P>
<P>Heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now a paranoid prisoner in her
isolated home, working over the phone as a women's crisis councilor.  Bitchy
tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) has risen to anchor
level on an entertainment news show (just missing out on a job with 60 Minutes
II).  Sweet natured Dewey Riley (David Arquette) has relocated and found a new
girlfriend, both logical representations of his true feelings.  Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber), who at one point was wrongly imprisoned for the murder of
Sidney's mother, now has his own talk show: 100% Cotton.</P>
<P>Production has begun on "Stab 3," the latest in those successful exploitation
films mentioned earlier.  When members of the cast start turning up dead it
becomes obvious there's another killer on the loose.</P>
<P>Around for the ride to arouse suspicions and increase the body count are
Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) who is playing Gale in the film and has her
bitchy persona nailed, flaky ingenue Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) who won a
nation wide talent search for the new Sidney, rising heartthrob Tom Prinze
(Matt Keesler) who improbably landed the role of Dewey, aging starlet Sarah
Darling (Jenny McCarthy) dissatisfied with her lack of screen time and
abundance of on screen nudity, and wisecracking Tyson (Deon Richmond) searching
for a way to stand out from the singer/actors who he competes for roles with.</P>
<P>There's also the young hot shot music video director Roman Bridger (Scott
Foley) making his feature helming debut, an aging, hack, producer John Milton
(Lance Henrickson), and local detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) assigned to
the case.</P>
<P>Among the large ensemble there are two notable standouts.  Posey's caustic line
delivery and offbeat screen personality make her character one of the best of
the series.  This is some of Posey's best work yet, and certainly her best in a
mainstream film.  Her chemistry with Cox is priceless, as she constantly finds
new ways to show up her "real life" counterpart.  As the series' heroine
Campbell has continued her blossoming as a genuine talent and she carries this
film with the greatest of ease.</P>
<P>McCarthy, Foley and Schreiber all have nice moments while Kelly Rutherford and
Patrick Warburton bring everything required for their brief roles.  There are
several surprise cameos, some work (a veteran producer/director and a teenaged
actress are both very well cast) and some don't.  Arquette and off-screen wife
Cox have their best moments opposite Posey.  They play their characters well
but don't expose any previously unseen layers.</P>
<P>This is likely due in part to the notably underwhelming script from Ehren
Kruger.  The first two films helped make a star of screenwriter Kevin
Williamson (nearly unheard of for a writer) but he returns for this film only
with producer and story credit.  His absence is often felt, such as in an early
dialogue scene between four "Stab 3" cast members.  A lot of the material feels
more like one of the Scream rip-offs than the real deal.</P>
<P>Still, the film meets the basic requirement of any good thriller: a memorably
tense sequence or two.  Scream 3's stand out is a freaky visit Sidney makes to
an on set replica of the house that originally set the stage for much of
Scream's bloodshed.  As with any other good installment of a series, the film
has a lot of fun in referencing what has come before it.  There's also an
increased degree of psychological torture, as the killer plays mind games with
Sidney involving her dead mother.</P>
<P>Just as Scream 2 was filled with self reflexive material about sequels, Scream
3 involves discussion of film trilogies.  Unfortunately, promises made here
only serve to make the climax even less interesting.  Instead of wrapping
things up in a clever, or at least believable, way the revelations of final
scenes are simply random.  However the very last scene ends the series on an
appropriate tone (if still failing to shut the door on any further
installments).</P>
<P>The talents of the cast and crew work to keep the film at a level entertaining
enough for series fans and anyone who can handle a film where most of the cast
will end up brutally murdered. Director Craven can turn out this stuff in his
sleep now.  The technical credits are polished with the production design
especially standing out.  Major exception is Marco Beltrami's often irritating
and intrusive score.</P>
