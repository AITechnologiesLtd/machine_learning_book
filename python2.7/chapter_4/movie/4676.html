<PRE>NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN (1983) **</PRE>
<P>     Never say, "Watch this movie," to someone either. Not that anyone 
said that to me. In fact, I wish someone had said the opposite to me. I 
sat through two-plus hours of Sean Connery trying to pretend he was 
still young enough to be James Bond, more than twenty years after 
portraying 007 for the first time in DR. NO. His age makes the multiple 
fistfights and love scenes with beautiful women more absurd-looking than 
usual. I'd say the fact that six years later Sean Connery would start 
playing action heros' fathers (INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and 
ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES) should clue you in on what I'm talking 
about. Why Connery couldn't leave the legend as it was instead of 
returning for the most bland Bond movie he's ever done is what puzzles 
me. No, I don't ponder the mysteries of the universe and the mortality 
of life. I ponder this for hours on end. </P>
<P>     NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a remake of 1965's THUNDERBALL, one of the 
more mediocre efforts from the Connery years. (Why they couldn't redo 
GOLDFINGER or DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is another thing I stay awake
nights pondering.) It keeps the basic premise of that movie--villain 
Largo, owner of an enormous yacht, steals two nuclear devices and 
threatens their detonation on the world if a ransom is not met--but 
changes almost everything else. </P>
<P>     Bond is reactivated as a double-o agent, only to be shipped off to 
a health farm to purge him of his ancient habits of eating red meat and 
drinking martinis shaken not stirred (when it's so much better for your 
body to have them stirred and not shaken). He does engage in a couple 
other old habits of his--sex with his masseuse and a destructive fight 
with a goon trying to kill him. He also stumbles upon the evil nurse 
(Barbara Carrera) working for Largo. That's conquest number two for 
Bond, who attracts beautiful women like flies... actually, mosquitoes 
might be a better comparison when you think about it. </P>
<P>     He then ends up playing a high-stakes video game with Largo (They 
had to take advantage of that 80's technology.) and doing the tango 
(vertically and horizontally) with Kim Basinger. Then there's the 
motorcycle chase, laser watch, Carrera's combustion and endless scuba 
diving. But it never seems like a full-fledged Bond movie. Besides the 
fact that Connery is over the action hero hill, British inventor Q. is 
played by a different actor and Moneypenny only has two lines. Wouldn't 
you think if Connery aged twenty years since the first movie that 
Moneypenny would be pushing fifty too? Nope, she's still unexplainably 
thirtyish. That's something else I'll be pondering at great lengths 
tonight.</P>
