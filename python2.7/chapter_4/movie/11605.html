<PRE>PRIMARY COLORS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In 1994, an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the Democratic
presidential nomination (closely based on Clinton's 1992 campaign) was
written anonymously (former Newsweek writer Joe Klein later claimed true
authorship).  Now, the book, Primary Colors, has been made into a movie,
directed by Mike Nichols, and, in light of recent presidential scandals,
seems to be more relevant than ever. But the film is more than a
diatribe against, or a paean in praise of, the president.  It is a
fascinating look at the political machinery, and the ethical quagmire,
that surround modern politics.</P>
<P>Jack Stanton (John Travolta) is the governor of a small southern state
running for the Democratic presidential nomination.  He is charismatic,
but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign, and strains
his relationship with his wife, Susan (Emma Thompson).</P>
<P>The film is told from the point of view of Henry Burton (Adrian Lester),
grandson of a civil rights leader, who is swept away by Stanton's ideals
and helps to organize the campaign.  He joins political strategist
Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton, looking an awful lot like James
Carville), and campaign advisor Daisy Green (Maura Tierney).</P>
<P>Governor Stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him, a fact that his
chief rival, Lawrence Harris (Kevin Cooney), consistently uses to his
advantage.  To help clean up the Stanton campaign, Jack and Susan bring
in an old friend, Libby "The Dustbuster" Holden (Kathy Bates).</P>
<P>The acting throughout Primary Colors is superb. It would be worth seeing
the movie for Bates' wild performance alone. She enlivens the atmosphere
with energy in a truly boisterous performance. Travolta does a fair
Clinton impersonation as Governor Stanton, although his accent does
stray a little.  Emma Thompson delivers a strong performance as his
suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the
presidential run.</P>
<P>The problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over
half of their audience by promoting one side or the other, or else the
movie is vague to the point of boredom.  Primary Colors treads lightly
on this issue.  Though Stanton is clearly portrayed as a Democrat, and
there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of Republicans, the movie
touches on few actual political issues. In fact, most of the "bad guys"
are fellow Democrats on the same road to the White House.</P>
<P>Rather than issues, the film is primarily concerned about scandals and
spin control.  Although the film strays into some obviously non-Clinton
territory, it is difficult to completely separate it from reality
(particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the President's
current troubles).</P>
<P>Primary Colors' chief problem is its length.  It runs about 15 minutes
too long.  There are some scenes which could have easily been cut. For
example, midway through the film, the candidate gives a speech to an
assembly of laid off machinists.  The scene's only apparent purpose is
to establish Stanton's character, which has already been done in similar
scenes earlier in the film.  The extra length isn't long enough nor
tiring enough to be annoying, but it mars an otherwise excellent film.</P>
<P>Republicans, Democrats, and political agnostics should all be able to
find something to like in Primary Colors.  It's a funny, and at some
times shocking, look at the modern political process.</P>
