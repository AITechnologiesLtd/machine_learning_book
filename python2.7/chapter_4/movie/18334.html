<PRE>ANALYZE THIS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Analyze This at first seems like the perfect example of a high concept
comedy, able to be summarized in a mere sentence fragment:  mob boss
seeks therapy. But, on further analysis, the movie proves to be
atypical.  It's actually funny.</P>
<P>Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) has a big problem.  He's a powerful mafia
boss in New York City.  Mob control of crime is beginning to wane, and
the heads of all the powerful families want to meet. Paul's bitter
rival, Primo Sindone (Chazz Palminteri) would prefer that Paul sleep
with the fishes, and orders a series of hits on the mob boss' life.</P>
<P>But that's not Paul's big problem.  No, his big problem is that he has
stress.  So much stress that he's suffering from panic attacks, and
severe emotional breakdowns.  Things get so bad that he reluctantly
decides to see a shrink:  one Dr. Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal).</P>
<P>Dr. Sobol doesn't particularly relish the idea of having an infamous
criminal as a client.  But a few kidnappings here, and a little harmless
torture there, and suddenly Paul Vitti is his favorite patient, or at
least his most persistent one.  When Paul needs therapy, Ben is expected
to deliver...any time, anywhere.  Even Ben's pending wedding to
newswoman Laura MacNamara (Lisa Kudrow) isn't a worthwhile excuse.</P>
<P>Analyze This is based on a gimmicky formula...but if there's a director
who knows how to take a comedy based on a gimmicky formula and make it
work, it's Harold Ramis (director of Caddyshack and Groundhog Day).
Under his easy, guiding hand, the film is able to weather a few
predictable scenes, and actually locates humor in unexpected places.</P>
<P>The key to the entire film is Robert DeNiro.   He has played every
variation of mobster known to film...but who knew he had such comic
potential?  His Paul Vitti is not only believable as a mafia boss, but
is played with perfect deadpan comic precision.</P>
<P>Billy Crystal finally breaks his unlucky streak of smarmy roles. He
subdues his typical schtick, and delivers a stronger character because
of it. He may be playing the straight man to DeNiro's more vibrant don,
but he never allows himself to become overshadowed, having many humorous
scenes of his very own.</P>
<P>The supporting cast can't quite live up to the film's two leads. Lisa
Kudrow, so wonderful in last year's The Opposite of Sex is woefully
misused here.  As is Chazz Palminteri, who barely registers on screen as
the movie's villain (relatively speaking). Only Joe Viterelli, as Jelly,
Vitti's loyal, but self-admittedly stupid henchman, makes a lasting
impression.</P>
<P>Excellent comic performances by the two leads, and a steady hand of
direction are able to overcome the film's few weaknesses.  The comedy of
Analyze This is occasionally predictable, but always funny.</P>
