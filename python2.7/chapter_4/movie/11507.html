<P>There was a huge crowd - so many over 100 people could not be admitted - at
a premiere screening of "The Nephew" (first screening with a major general
audience admittance).  This was a movie premiere at the Santa Barbara
International Film Festival.</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan (007), produced his first movie with Beau St. Clair. It was
a constantly mind-moving and personal movie with lovely scenes of Ireland.</P>
<P>Chad (Hill Harper, Beloved) is a cute 17 year old mixed race (African
American and Irish) nephew, who's Irish mother died. He comes "back to
Ireland", living with the Curmudgeon Uncle, Tony Egan (Donal McCann). He
meets Pierce Brosnan's character, Mr. O'Brady (or just Brady), because he
falls in love with the beautiful daughter. There are many scenes (ah,
character scenes) to laugh at, others pull some tears. </P>
<P>The three mentioned above were at the premiere in the flesh, with the
director Eugene Brady. After the movie they took questions. The movie was
very good, it not fantastic.  The Nephew has not been "picked up" in North
America but has been in the rest of the world.</P>
<P>The Nephew is generation secrecy of a "Titanic" proportion. Let's hope the
rest of America will be able to see The Nephew.</P>
