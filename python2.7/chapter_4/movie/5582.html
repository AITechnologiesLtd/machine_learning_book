<P>LES LIASONS DANGEREUSES GOES EAST BY WAY OF CHEN KAIGE.</P>
<P>In his third outing as a scriptwriter, following LIFE ON A STRING
(Bian Zou Bian Chang, 1991) and the highly acclaimed YELLOW EARTH
(Huang Tudi, 1994), Chen returns to his favoured niche of painting the
microcosm of life at the dawn of the new Chinese Rep ublic.</P>
<P>It is the year 1911, and Zhongliang (Leslie Cheung) naively
comes under the roof of the feudal Pang household at the invitation of
his married sister Xiuyi (He Saifei) while the rest of China is
experiencing political turmoil . However, it is not long before he is
subjected to a terrifying period of psychological and near-incestuous
assault under the hands of his opium addicted brother-in-law.</P>
<P>He subsequently flees for the glitzy, cabaret world of Shanghai in the
Roaring 20s where he comes under the tutelage of a secret society
gangster (Xie Tian). Here, Zhongliang plys his trade as a thief of
hearts, offering amour on the cheap to lone ly tai tais before
accomplices step in and extort money at the appropriate moment.</P>
<P>Back at the Pang household where he had left a decade ago, an overdose
of opium has rendered Zhongliang's brother-in-law brain-dead, and the
family moves to encamp the latter's younger sister Ruyi (Gong Li) as
head of the household, with distant cousin Du anwu (Kevin Lin) as her
aide.</P>
<P>The trouble starts when Zhongliang's boss decides to use him to seduce
Ruyi so as to gain the Pang estate (a treasure-filled mansion artfully
placed in a large water lily encrusted lake in Suzhou).</P>
<P>>From whence the plots splits into a confusing dichotomy of emotional
revelations. Zhongliang returns to the house to carry out his
directives and exorcise personal demons but inevitably gets his
emotions mixed up with the job at hand. The besotted victim, Ruyi runs
into a conflict of emotions with having to shoulder the manly task of
running the household under the sexist glances of family elders on one
hand and discovering her sexual awakening after a lifetime of societal
isolation on the other.</P>
<P>Along the way, numerous subplots weave themselves into the main
storyline, with constant flashbacks into Zhongliang's tortured
childhood and his relationship with his scheming sister, now a Pang
dependant waiting for her ride into oblivion.</P>
<P>These nuggets of information, while courageous in their attempt to
flesh out the emotional capacities of the leads, has a tendency to go
into stylised, emotional overdrive and eventually serves only to
diffuse the focus of the film. All fingers point to t he fact Chen
seems rather guilty of participating in sentimental indulgence for the
sake of leaving his thumprint in the movie. Still, both leads Cheung
and Gong Li don't quite hedge up enough sincerity to convince as
emotionally manipulated victims.</P>
<P>While one cannot argue with the sumptousness of the sets and costumes
nor contest the cinematographical techniques of Du Kefung (from Wong
Kar Wai's FALLEN ANGEL), one cannot help but wonder if Chen
scripwriting abilities would be more easily swallowed if there was a
more determined effort on Chen's part to shoot the movie from a
realist's perspective.</P>
