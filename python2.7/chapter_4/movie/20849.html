<PRE>Nobody's Kung Fool
Black Mask</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Jet Li (of "Lethal Weapon 4" infamy) is the blacksheep of the 701 squad --
an elite military force of medically enhanced super-humans. Seems a few
701's got out of hand so the Hong Kong government decided to nicks the
program ... i.e. terminate these tough guys (and gal). At the film's
opening, Jet escapes alone (or so he thinks). For reasons not revealed to
us, this 701 who can feel no physical or emotional pain becomes a pacifist
and takes a job as a library page.</P>
<P>detective. And you know what happens when superhero's have cops for buddies
... they have a hard time staying pacifistic.</P>
<P>Okay, so the story isn't the strongest -- but did you really think it would
be? Did you care? It's Jet Li looking like Kato and kicking butt! If that's
what you expect, that's what you'll get.</P>
<P>"Black Mask" is a 1996 Hong Kong martial arts flick (rather typical of that
genre as well). It's been dubbed over in English to add that cheesy
late-night TV dimension to it. The squirty blood won't scare anyone
either -- save for the potential dangers of Red Dye #2. But, it's paced
well, Jet kicks a lot of bootie, it has romance, betrayal and a sense of
humor. I had fun and enjoyed (in particular) the relationship between Jet
and the cop; both played their parts respectably well, whether during a
mid-air drop kick or a friendly game of chess.</P>
<P>Starring Jet, Li Karen Mok, Lau Ching Wan, Francoise Yip.
Directed by Daniel Lee.
Screenplay by Tsui Hark, Teddy Chen, Joe Ma.
Produced by Tsui Hark and Released by Artisan Entertainment.
Rated R.</P>
