<P>A nominee for this year's Best Foreign Film Oscar, this Georgian film
(Georgia as in Caucasus, not Atlanta) is a co-production of many European
countries, notably France. Its French title means "The Thousand and One
Recipes of a Chef in Love."</P>
<P>It is natural for France to have played a major role in the making of
"Chef," since it  has been the major co-producing force for movies from the
former Soviet bloc. It is also the nation that, before and after the
dissolution of the USSR, best showcased Georgian cinema. My all-time
favorite festival, that of La Rochelle (France), some years ago devoted  a
huge portion of its program to Georgian films. These were accompanied by  a
large, lively and merry band of Georgian filmmakers who were not too
different from some of the characters in "Chef."</P>
<P>The Chef is Frenchman Pascal Ichac, played against type by the comic actor
(also writer, director and producer) Pierre Richard, familiar from his
roles in pictures such as "The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe,"" La
Chevre," and "Les Comperes." These are part of a large number of French
comedies that Hollywood has been remaking in the 1980s  and 1990s. In
general the adaptations are much inferior to the originals. The latest is
the  unsuccessful "Father's Day" (1997), from "Les Comperes"  of 1984.</P>
<P>Richard is almost unrecognizable in "Chef." Hirsute, and with his usual
naivet=E9 replaced by wordly sophistication, showing all of his 62 years, he
plays a jack-of-all-trades and master of many. He is a bon vivant,  has
been a rou=E9, a parasite, a gigolo, an opera singer  and, crucial to the
film, a gourmet and master cook whose legacy is a celebrated book of
recipes.</P>
<P>The movie is told in flashbacks of Ichac's adventures in Georgia during a
few years following the Great War. The ancient kingdom of Georgia was, as
per the Georgians, founded in antiquity by Jason and his Argonauts.
Eventually dominated by Turks and Persians, then annexed to the Russian
Empire in the 19th century,  after the Soviet Revolution Georgia emerged as
an independent state from 1918 to 1921.</P>
<P>En route to Tbilisi (a.k.a Tiflis), the capital, in a first-class train
compartment world-traveler Ichac meets  Princess Cecilia Abachidze,
appealingly played by Nino Kirtadze. (Georgian names end in  -dze, in  -ani
or in  -vili -- as in Dzhugashvili , later changed to Stalin,  or like
Kalikashvili). Both Cecilia and Pascal are sophisticates, free souls and
charmers. Pascal produces vintage wine out of his bags and a sumptuous,
unbelievable buffet out of nowhere. Who can remain unimpressed?</P>
<P>Pascal  could almost be the young lady's grandfather, but he is so lusty
and interesting that instant electricity is generated. The two become
lovers and go through colorful adventures.</P>
<P>Pascal's extraordinary palate and sense of smell allow him to concoct
culinary masterpieces. One day, at the Opera, his uncanny olfactory
abilities sniff out the gun-powder of a hidden bomb destined for Georgia's
President. He saves the man's life, the two become fast friends. Pascal is
allowed to open a restaurant in Tbilisi. Maniacally devoting his talents to
international and something like New Georgian cuisine to it, Pascal makes
of his "New Eldorado" a world Mecca for gourmets -- sometimes at the
expense of time spent with Cecilia.</P>
<P>Even so, he is very much in love with her, as well as with gastronomy and
life.
Asked by the President why a restaurant in Georgia and not in a Western
capital, Pascal simply states that he has fallen in love with the country.
Well he might. Georgia is a small country with an immense variety of
natural beauties. Its people are creative, artistic, have a lust for life,
drink, eat, sing, dance and do everything with energy. (Perhaps it is the
secret of their record longevity). They may also seem  slightly mad. All
this fits Pascal perfectly.</P>
<P>The short life of independent Georgia comes to an end when in 1921  the Red
Army and Bolshevik apparatchiks swoop down and take over.The Georgians of
today have always felt a totally separate identity from that of the Soviet
Empire. They declared their sovereignty in 1989 and independence on April
9, 1991. Georgian cinema, before and after the break, has been a major and
different entity within the Greater Russian system. In "Chef" the Bolshevik
invasion becomes another opportunity for criticizing Soviet culture.</P>
<P>The invaders are shown as uncouth military, opportunists, bullies,
barbarians or sexual deviants, although the caricatures do stop short of
cliches. The fate of  Cecilia, Pascal and Haute Cuisine becomes a tangle
that I will not reveal</P>
<P>The movie was directed by Nana Djordjaze, who looks  like her heroine
Cecilia. Ms.Djordjaze came to prominence in 1986 when her  "Robinsonada, Or
My English Grandfather" won the Camera d'Or (for best first feature) at the
Cannes Film Festival. Her husband, screenwriter-director  Irakli
Kvirikadze, did the script for "Chef." His films are excellent, especially
"The Swimmer" (1987)  Grand Prix At The San Remo Festival.</P>
<P>"Chef" has a lot of originality, creativity, local color, humor,
character-centered and historical details and first-rate production values.
It also has a number of structural problems, mainly, like the Revolution, a
lack of discipline.</P>
<P>The flashbacks from Paris-now to Georgia-then are a bit precious and lead
to a convenient  and rather ho-hum revelation. There is, however, the
exquisite bonus of Micheline Presle, the star of "Devil in the Flesh"
(1947). As Parisian Marcelle Ichac, the niece of Pascal, and   a
contemporary food photographer who cooks her own scrumptious culinary
layouts, at age 74 Miss Presle is an incredibly radiant, vigorous beauty.</P>
<P>Overall the film is loosely episodic and often lacks clear points of view.
There is a general vagueness as to its who-what-where-whens.  Until the
Reds invade, one is hardly conscious that a World War had occurred or that
a major revolution had taken place in Russia.</P>
<P>At the risk of nitpicking, I believe that many of the automobiles used by
the Red Army in 1921 are later models, even classic 1930s cars. On a basic
level is the fact that in a movie celebrating food, one does not get a true
sense of cuisine or follow the actual preparation of dishes. Pascal and his
staff are mostly shown bustling about and throwing things around.There are
no visual  kitchen glories as in "Babette's Feast," "Eat, Drink, Man,
Woman," or "Big Night."  We hear details of some of  Ichac's 1001 recipes,
but they are no substitute for sights that makes us salivate. The wider
frame of  love, life, politics,tragedies and the pursuit of happiness can
be counter-productive to the "eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die"
thread.</P>
<P>All the same, in spite of faulty coherence and excessive to-and-fro-ing,
the basic frame of the picture is an original, often fascinating
experience. For gourmets of celluloid, i.e. connoisseurs, there is also a
series of in-jokes, of tongue-in-cheek, esoteric filmic and historical
references, as in the choice of names like Ichac, Lilli Lieftenstahl or
Madame Kollontay. This work may not make it into the Pantheon of food
movies but otherwise it is a very good addition to offbeat and to Georgian
cinema.</P>
