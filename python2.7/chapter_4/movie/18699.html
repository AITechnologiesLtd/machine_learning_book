<PRE>*** out of four</PRE>
<PRE>"I think therefore I am."</PRE>
<P>Starring Craig Bierko, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Gretchen Mol. Rated R.</P>
<P>Can there possibly be anything new to say about the concept of virtual
reality impersonating reality? In the past two years, Hollywood has
pummeled us drilled with the idea that the world as we know it may not
be what we think it to be -- films such as Dark City, The Matrix,
eXistenZ and now The Thirteenth Floor have all been brooding over the
thought. Notice that I have recommended all of the above, the reason
being that I love these kinds of movies; they have the potential to
excite my imagination and get my adrenaline flowing, if done well. Oddly
enough, these four movies have all been done well.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth Floor is an ambitious little movie that dares to open
with Descartes' famous quote "I think therefore I am." At first glance
it will seem ill-advised and pretentious, especially if you've seen any
promo material for the movie. But stick with it, and you'll find that
the presence of that quote in the very beginning provides the movie with
the power to stick with you for some time after it is over.</P>
<P>It opens with what seems like the early 19th century. We see an elderly
man (Armin Mueller-Stahl) leave a hotel (where a beautiful young girl is
peacefully sleeping on a bed), leave a note for the bartender to give to
someone else and head home. He comes home to his wife, gets into bed and
we find out that the guy is playing an elaborate computer game; indeed
he wakes up in a computer lab. Sooner than later, he is stabbed to
death. All evidence points to a young executive of the company, Douglas
Hall (Craig Bierko) to have killed him. Doug's only hope, it seems, is
to find a message that his now-deceased boss allegedly left inside the
simulation. What he finds changes his perception of reality, himself and
the people around him.</P>
<P>What's terrific about the first two thirds of The Thirteenth Floor is
how the movie plays out as a mystery; revealing its secret by slowly
peeling away its layers. It succeeds in keeping the deductive viewers a
half step ahead of the characters (mainly because for a corporate
executive, Douglas isn't terribly bright), but not so far that we become
bored.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for those that have just begun to get wrapped up in the
proceedings, the film falls apart completely towards the end. The
script, never particularly outstanding to begin with, starts to move
with undesirably rapid speed towards inanity, and the romance that
develops betweed Douglas and a beautiful woman with a dark secret
(Gretchen Mol) is not only horridly written but it is also
dissappointing as a payoff (this is what we get?!?). The ending leaves
too many loose-ends untied to be particularly satisfying, and it is also
telegraphed about 30 minutes before it actually happens so that one
pretty much knows for sure what is going to happen.</P>
<P>Mueller-Stahl is engaging in a role that never quite dies. Bierko is
just okay as the protagonist, although unfortunately he doesn't project
his shock at his discovery convincingly. Gretchen Mol is absolutely
dreadful in an essential role, but going into the explicit details of
her performance or her character will ruin a few surprises, so I'm not
going to go into detail here.</P>
<P>I never like seeing a movie that shows such promise nearly destroy
itself by such an uninspired resolution. The Thirteeth Floor is
regardless a respectable movie (although, for the record, I was
originally going to go with a much less enthusiastic **1/2, until I
found myself thinking about the movie more during that same night) but
it could easily been truly excellent -- it could have been the best
movie of the year. But it's not, and The Matrix holds on to that dubious
distinction.
