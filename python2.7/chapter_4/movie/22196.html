<P>PLOT:
An orphaned mouse gets adopted by two human parents. The real son of the duo
does not take well to the mouse at first, but eventually begins to
understand and appreciate him better, until one day, the mouse's real micey
parents show up to claim back their child. Who will Stuart, the cute little
mouse, end up with?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I expected more fun and laughs from this cute mouse tale. It was an okay
movie, great special effects with the talking mice and cats blending right
into their human entourage, some fun moments including a mafia cat ring
looking out for revenge, but not enough punch to recommend with much
enthusiasm. In fact, I think the filmmakers went a little too far on the
sentimentality bit, chiming in with sad music during every conceivable
moment of uncertainty. Mrs. JoBlo also liked it but nothing more than that.
There just seemed to be something missing, something that could've been
there, should've been there, but in the end, just wasn't. Will kids dig it?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they will but don't expect them to start dusting off
their shelves for a new spot next to their TOY STORY and BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST videos.</P>
<P>I did love the way the mice all happened to be accepted in modern day
society as a matter of fact, and the excellent close-ups of the cats talking
and emoting their feelings, but when all was said and done, most of their
jokes fell flat, and I suppose that after the amazing spectacle that was TOY
STORY 2 (8/10), most other kid movies have to seriously drum up their
bang-for-a-buck factor, in order to be appreciated by today's expectant
movie-going audience. It's really too bad because I was thoroughly impressed
by the superior computer-generated character of Stuart Little, whose cute
face and impeccable body movements certified him as a truly original film
personality. Unfortunately, the film lacked that slickness, that hipness,
that humor, that action-packed craziness that takes a kid's movie and rises
it above the rest. All in all, it was okay, a couple of funny moments, a
couple of decent action scenes, a quick runtime, one too many emotional
moments, but a fun time for most kids. See it just for the slick mouse
effects and all of the cats talking shtick...that is, if you're into that
kind of thing.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Michael J. Fox was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, but currently makes
his home in New York City with his wife, actress Tracy Pollan, and their
three children. Michael stands 5'4" and recently revealed that he was
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991.
Actress Geena Davis has been married to two really tall showbiz guys: actor
Jeff Goldblum and director Renny Harlin. She is also a member of the
geniuses-'R-us organization of MENSA, speaks Swedish and placed 24th out of
28 semi-finalists for the American Olympic Archery Team in 1999. Her full
name is Virginia Elizabeth Davis.
No doubt you all remember the cute boy in this film, Jonathan Lipnicki, from
the 1996 Tom Cruise film, JERRY MAGUIRE (8/10), which also happened to be
his big screen debut. Ironically, his endearing portrayal of Ray Boyd earned
the kid the "1996 Best Child Performance of the Year" award presented by the
National Broadcast Film Critics Association.
Many familiar guest voices make appearances as characters in this film
including Nathan Lane, Chazz Palminteri, Steve Zahn, David Alan Grier, Bruno
Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
Screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan is the man behind one of the biggest movie
successes of 1999: THE SIXTH SENSE (8/10). He wrote and directed that film.
By the time he was sixteen years old, he had already completed his 45th
short film, and at the tender age of 17, he stood before his parents, both
doctors, surrounded by pictures of the other 12 doctors in his family, and
informed them that although he graduated cum laude and received academic
scholarships to several prestigious medical programs, he had instead decided
to attend the New York University Tisch School of the Arts to study
filmmaking. The rest, as they say, is history.</P>
