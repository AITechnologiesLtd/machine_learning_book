<P>Starring Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams,
Steve Buscemi, Leslie Mann. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Adam Sandler has become one of the most bankable stars of the decade,
with an impressive list of box-office and video winners under his belt.
It's a shame that his films aren't as consistently good cinematically as
they are at the box-office; since he became popular, they have ranged
from the sublime (Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer) to the abysmal
(Billy Madison, The Waterboy). Now comes Big Daddy, a film that has more
in common with Wedding Singer than any of the other films, but lacks
that comedy's charm, replacing it with hackneyed aaw-gosh sweetness
which is the last thing we want to see from Sandler.</P>
<P>Many parts of Big Daddy's premise are by now trite: Sonny Koufax, a law
school graduate who decided to throw his life away and become a toll
collector, stumbles upon a 5 year old kid named Julian, evidently the
son of one of his pals, who he never knew had a son. The boy's father
just left the country on business and isn't expected to be back for a
few months. At first Sonny decides to keep the kid at his house for the
night and give him to social services in the morning.</P>
<P>When he comes to social services, posing as the father, to give the kid
away to a foster family, he changes his mind and decides to keep the
little bugger. He does it so that he can impress his girlfriend (Joey
Lauren Adams), who insists that Sonny "refuses to move on to the next
stage of [his] life." He hopes that this kid can strengthen their
volatile relationship much like a woman might get pregnant to save a
marriage.</P>
<P>Much to Sonny's surprise, his girlfriend has already dumped him for an
old guy with a five-year plan, and he finds that he is stuck with the
kid until social services can line up a foster family for him.
Inevitably, Sonny and Julian build a relationship of their own, Julian
becoming a son to Sonny and Sonny a father to Julian. But all can't be
that simple as social services discover that Sonny isn't really Julian's
father and threaten arrest.</P>
<P>I can't say that I was bored watching Big Daddy because it is an utterly
harmless, lighthearted film. Admittedly some of it is amusing, and some
irresistibly cute. But David Dugan, who worked with Sandler previously
on Happy Gilmore (aside from lensing losers such as Problem Child and
Beverly Hills Ninja) proves incapable of maintaining the hilarity, nor
can he introduce any credible pathos to keep us emotionally involved
with these characters.</P>
<P>Part of the problem, I think, is that Adam Sandler isn't effective as
the responsible type (although watching Adam the parent is better than
Adam the retard as in Waterboy). He has much more success playing the
lovable, desparate loser, such as he did in Gilmore and Singer than he
does playing a father figure. I'm sorry, but it's painful to watch
Sandler carefully bathing a 5 year old -- he has never been that sort of
persona and he fails to turn himself into one for the role.</P>
<P>The action builds up to a mind-bogglingly asinine courtroom scene, in
which Sandler has to deliver a pseudo-inspirational speech about
responsibility. Somebody gag me. His movies have thus far avoided this
sort of phony sentimentality, and even the most awful ones were better
for it. Whoever inspired Sandler (who, as I hear, was the final
authority on the film's script even though he didn't write it) or the
writer to go for the lurid hokeyness present throughout the last third
of Big Daddy should be credited for putting the stake through the film's
metaphorical heart.</P>
<P>Big Daddy isn't an insult to humanity, it's merely pure and constant
mediocrity. The laughs are few and far between and the movie never
succeeds in developing any sort of dramatic tension. I expected better
from Sandler, even though I've seen far worse from him.
