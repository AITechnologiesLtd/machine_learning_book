<PRE>A Non-Conservative Rush
Rushmore</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"When one person has the opportunity to live an extraordinary life, he has
no right to keep it to himself." This quote, scribbled in a book at the
Rushmore School library, sums up this eccentric film.</P>
<P>The son of a barber, Max Fischer (Schwartzman), scores a scholarship to the
prim and expensive private Rushmore via a play he'd written in second grade.
Nerdy, yet rebellious, Max embraces the extra-curricular opportunities at
the prep school -- founding or leading every club from bee-keeping to
fencing. However, such diversion of attention leaves his grades severely
lacking. This, coupled with his extreme antics, intended to win the heart of
a young teacher (Williams), Max finds himself expelled.</P>
<P>"This was supposed to be my night! You hurt my feelings!" Max exclaims to
Miss Cross in an attempt to excuse his very funny berating of her boyfriend.
It's a delightful scene, and just one of many.</P>
<P>Max befriends Mr. Blume (Murray), a millionaire who hates rich people. Blume
attempts to help Max win over Cross, but ends up falling in love with her
himself.</P>
<P>Bizarre friendships develop well and richly in this oddly funny film. If
you're tired of the usual movie -- I strongly recommend "Rushmore," you'll
find it quite refreshing. (Check under the theater seating for "safety
glasses and air plugs.")</P>
<P>Starring Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams.
Directed by Wes Anderson (Bottle Rocket).</P>
<P>Grade..........................A</P>
