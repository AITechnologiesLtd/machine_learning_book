<P>Sometime  in 1995 A.D. a bunch of the boys (Danish moviemakers) were 
whooping it up in Copenhagen.  Whether in merriment, seriousness, 
put-on, or all the above, they came up with a sort of collective, 
Dogme 95. It was followed by a serious manifesto, the full reading of 
which is a howl.  It is a set of "indisputable rules" which they 
called The Vow Of Chastity.  As I see it, it was a cinematic "back to 
nature" micro-movement whose purpose was  to purify film by refusing 
certain techniques and conventions.  Put differently, it was a 
neo-Luddite attitude which, I suspect, was a mix of 
tongue-in-cheekness, getting publicity, and  good intentions.</P>
<P>The Dogme contains 10 rules, a la Moses : Location shooting only. 
Sound and image must be simultaneously recorded. Hand-held cameras 
only. Color film only. No special lighting, no optical work or 
filters. No "superficial action" (murders, weapons, etc.). Film must 
take place here and now. Genre movies are a no-no. Academy 35mm 
format only. Directors must not be credited.</P>
<P>"Mifune" is also listed as "Mifune Dogme 3" because it is the third 
officially Dogme acredited movie made by following the Ten 
Commandments. It was preceded by Lars Trier's "The Idiots" and Thomas 
Vinterberg's "The Celebration."</P>
<P>The plot. In Copenhagen, yuppieish Kresten marries Claire, the 
daughter of his tycoon boss. The wedding night has Claire demonstrate 
sexual bliss in the longest and loudest way. It gets a 9 in non-porno 
film history. (Why not a 10? Because one should always allow for 
future records).</P>
<P>An urgent phone call  informs Kresten that his father has died in 
Lolland (Denmark's southermost island). The young financier's 
presence is required. It comes as a shock to Claire since Kresten had 
declared that he had no family at all. His hurried excuse is that he 
had been alienated from his people for many years. He promises to be 
back in 48 hours.</P>
<P>He (and his wife's BMW) reach the island by ferry-boat. The family 
property turns out to be a dilapidated mess of a farm and farmhouse. 
The inhabitants are Daddy's corpse and Rud, Kresten's mentally 
defective older brother. Among Rud's many peculiarities are a 
conviction that space people are landing and a refusal to take 
showers. He is kind of sweet but needs care and supervision.</P>
<P>Kresten's calls in all sorts of excuses to his wife to explain that 
he will be delayed. Since Rud cannot be left alone (but one wonders 
what the incapacitated father had been doing for him) Kresten 
advertises in a Copenhagen paper for a housekeeper.</P>
<P>In most unlikely record time the classified ad is answered by Liva, 
who shows up pronto. She is (but of course does not disclose it) one 
of a small group of upscale call-girls who seem to have mostly kinky 
clients. Liva plies her trade out of necessity:  to pay 
private-school fees for her unruly young brother. But she has to flee 
the big city because of problems with her pimp, with an irate client, 
and with a threatening, anonymous caller.</P>
<P>That's the story so far. Will there be mutual attraction between 
Kresten and Liva? Are there some nasty neigbors around? Will Claire 
get suspicious and show up? Or Liva's fellow-workers?  Is there a pot 
of gold at the end of the rainbow? Shall we meet Liva's brother 
Bjarke? Will he and Rud become fast friends? Should we expect a happy 
ending?</P>
<P>If writer-director Soren Kragh-Jacobsen was looking for an original 
storyline he has another look coming. If he wanted to apply Dogme 
95's Decalogue to his film, he was relatively successful. I repeat, 
relatively. For example, the handheld camera bit. Time and again I 
was sure that the steadiness of some images could not have been 
achieved without a tripod. Anotherr example: the anti-genre bit. The 
affair between Liva and Kresten falls squarely in the prostitute with 
a heart of gold category. The director bit.  Dogme movies always get 
around the non-crediting of the director. And so on. But the film 
does hew to the lighting part of the Commandments and the avoidance 
of technical devices and special effects.</P>
<P>Kragh-Jacobsen does admit "that he bent the rule on using available 
props a bit --pruning a few bushes in an overgrown farm garden and 
borrowing a few chickens from the farm next door."</P>
<P>Along traditional criteria, the performers are the major 
beneficiaries of the Dogma. They are all suprisingly good, and our 
unfamiliarity with them makes us see real people rather than 
performers. Only one player may be known to us, Iben Hjejle 
(pronounced EE-ben YI-leh) who made her American debut opposite John 
Cusack in "High Fidelity."</P>
<P>The film's title is not all that esoteric. In Danish it is "Mifune's 
Last Song." From their youth, Kresten and Rud, fans of samurai films 
(which Rud calls "samovar") have  played a game in which the famous 
Japanese actor was impersonated by Kresten, complete with 
Japanese-type grunts.</P>
<P>Despite weaknesses, the movie's rough look and "faux naive" strategy 
does give it a nice succession of believable slice-of-life scenes in 
the "what you see is what you get" vein. The camera and microphone 
constantly observe and record without providing any explanations or 
comments. It's a kind of hybrid: staged but not elaborated 
cinema-verite with a fitting uncomplexity of characters. As it stands 
until now, Dogme 95 is more of a shaggy dogma than anything else, but 
it could be a plus in the most unlikely possibility that it might rub 
off on some movie-making, even microscopically, and reduce today's 
cinema's suffocating reliance on gimmickry.</P>
<P>"Mifune" was Denmark's nominee for foreign language Oscars. At the 
Berlin Film Festival  it won the Silver Bear. The top prize, the 
Golden Bear, went to "The Thin Red Line."</P>
