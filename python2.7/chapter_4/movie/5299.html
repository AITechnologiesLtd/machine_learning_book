<PRE>                                SEA OF LOVE
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>Thanks in large part to an intelligent script and a talented cast, the
movie SEA OF LOVE breathe new life into a tired genre: the serial murder
thriller.</P>
<P>        Al Pacino plays a 40-something New York detective going through a
mid-life crisis.  To complicate matters, he's also in the midst of
investigating a series of gruesome homicides.  One of the suspects is a
sexually-charged single mother, played by Ellen Barkin.  And what do you
know: before you can say JAGGED EDGE, they're immersed in a passionate love
affair.</P>
<P>        SEA OF LOVE easily absorbs you into a web of psychological
intrigue.  Barkin is truly enigmatic but not at the cost of her character's
authenticity.  The movie takes great joy in playing mind games with you,
and it keeps you guessing as to whether Barkin is in fact the killer.  As
usual, Barkin brings to the screen her own unique brand of sexual energy.
She's as alluring and ravishing as ever; and, oh yes, her performance is
outstanding.</P>
<P>        For the first time this decade, Pacino has a role worthy of his
talents.  His character is on one hand sensitive and vulnerable and on the
other alcoholic and self-destructive.  The high strung detective is no
saint, but at the same time he's a decent bloke if you get past his rough
edges.  Pacino's strong performance should allow him to reclaim his stature
as one of Hollywood's premier leading men.  John Goodman of the hit TV
sitcom "Roseanne" plays Pacino's partner, bringing to the role considerable
charm and charisma.</P>
<P>        The individual whom we should really thank for this highly
entertaining and superbly crafted thriller is screenwriter Richard Price.
He furnishes the movie with a rich mixture of mystery, character, erotic
tension, and, most surprisingly, laughs--big ones.  Sure the writer commits
a few errors and stumbles a little at the end, but in the balance his
dialogue and story line are right on the mark.</P>
<P>        I guess SEA OF LOVE is fairly suspenseful since the capacity crowd
jumped at least three times.  But I wouldn't really know because I was so
busy trying to outguess the movie and solve the mystery that I barely
noticed the suspense.  Did she do it or didn't she?</P>
