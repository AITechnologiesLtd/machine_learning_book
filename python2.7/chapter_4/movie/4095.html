<PRE>                                TO DIE FOR
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Gus Van Sant's new, much-hyped farce/thriller is finally here, and
with it arrives the director's best feature and Nicole Kidman's
strongest performance.  TO DIE FOR, the tale of Suzanne Stone (Kidman),
a sexy newswoman wannabe who'll do *anything* to get on television, is
entertaining and funny, but pulls its punches by never taking the farce
of its story far enough.</P>
<P>     Told in half-flashback, half-mockumentary style, the film traces
the events leading up to the murder of the Suzanne's husband, Larry
(Matt Dillon).  We see Suzanne trying to get ahead in the media world,
carving out a career for herself at a low budget cable station.  We
also see large stretches of Suzanne creating a meaningless documentary
about modern teenagers, wherein three kids (including drugged-out
zombie Jimmy, played by an unwatchable Joaquin Phoenix) are interviewed
ad nauseam.  All the while, key relatives try to get to the bottom of
the mystery: who killed Larry, and why?</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the answer to that question is almost painfully
obvious from the movie's first frame.  As far as the term "thriller" is
concerned, TO DIE FOR is completely off base.  On a comic level,
though, the film is worthwhile.  Buck Henry's smart script and ear for
humor is responsible for this, creating a "nice" story that usually
amuses and overcomes the one-dimensional drama.</P>
<P>     In the end, I was hoping for a whole lot more, given all the buzz
around the film.  With a farce like this, you really have to take the
lunacy almost to absurdity, but Suzanne never even gets out of Little
Hope (get it?), New Hampshire.  Where is Suzanne in Hollywood?  Where
is The Trial of the Century?  Well, I guess those scenes were cut out
in earlier drafts....  The result is a less than satisfying ending that
left me saying, "That's it?"</P>
<PRE>     That was it.</PRE>
