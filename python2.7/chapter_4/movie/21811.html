<PRE>SLEEPY HOLLOW
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        "Heads will roll" is the campy tagline for the latest film based on
Washington Irving's classic fable about a horseman with a penchant for
rendering his victims headless, but the ratings board figured there were
too many decapitations in Tim Burton's latest extravaganza and slapped
"Sleepy Hollow" with an "R."  That's a bit of a blow to a film which, in
hindsight, might have done better with a Halloween--rather than a
Thanksgiving--release.</P>
<P>        Burton's film is a strange fish regardless.  Although typically
ghoulish and macabre for the director of "Batman" and "Beetlejuice," it's
too bleak for kids, who'll have to drag a seventeen-year-old along with
them to see it.  And it's too relentless for adults, who are likely to grow
tired of its unsparing focus on severed heads bouncing through the
undergrowth.  Still, they might find some comfort in Rick Heinrichs'
Burton-esque production design or Johnny Depp's no-nonsense performance as
New York constable Ichabod Crane.</P>
<P>        Depp, in his third film with the director (following "Edward
Scissorhands" and "Ed Wood"), is deliciously affected as Crane, a dandy of
a policeman circa 1799 who's sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow in the
Hudson Islands to investigate the mysterious slayings of three of its
locals.  "Their heads were...gone?" gulps Depp when the town's
representatives fill him in on the gory goings-on.  Depp has a great way of
speaking in the film: mannered, polite, and with just a hint of the King's
English.</P>
<P>        Sleepy Hollow's spokespersons are an interesting mix of talent
decked out in fascinating period wardrobes that make them look like
characters in a Lewis Carroll novel, among them Michael Gambon, Miranda
Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough, and Richard Griffiths.  Christina
Ricci, who plays Katrina Van Tassel, provides the pulchritudinous love
interest but isn't given much to do and certainly doesn't connect in any
way with Depp's character.  Also on board, albeit briefly, is horror
veteran Christopher Lee, whose Hammer horror films of the '60s "Sleepy
Hollow" most closely resembles.</P>
<P>        The "R" rating is unfortunate because "Sleepy Hollow," like
Hammer's slew of Dracula pictures, is clearly a gothic fantasy and its
bloodlettings more ludicrously camp than graphic (although Burton never
spares us the post-decapitation shot and seems to revel in squirting blood
in Depp's face at every opportunity).  Since Irving's novel is the stuff of
American folklore, however, it's a pity Burton couldn't have done more with
it.  He's dressed it up some, and then painted it depressingly black.  And
he's milked a great performance from Depp but asked him, for the most part,
only to react to lifeless corpses.</P>
<P>        "Sleepy Hollow" never quite finds its footing despite some strong
performances and a great look (including a creepy-looking windmill in the
closing scenes that recalls Burton's debut short, "Frankenweenie").  As for
that tagline, heads are more likely to be scratched, and it's the eyes that
will be doing the rolling during "Sleepy Hollow."</P>
