Review:                Pecker</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:                Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>When you first hear that Pecker is a John Waters film, you know that you
are in for something unusual.  Pecker is certainly that, and more.</P>
<P>Pecker, played by Edward Furlong, spends his time with an inexpensive
camera taking photos of everything that he sees and loves, and Pecker sees
beauty in everything, and everybody.  From his girlfriend, [Christina
Ricci] who runs the local Laundromat, to his grandmother who sells pit
beef sandwiches from a stand in front of their house, and has a statue of
the Virgin Mary that talks.</P>
<P>This very dysfunctional family has no idea that they are not your
everyday normal group.  Pecker's mother, played beautifully by Mary Kay
Place, runs a thrift shop catering mainly to the homeless.  This is where
she got the camera that Pecker uses to change their lives.</P>
<P>Pecker's father runs a local bar that is being run out of business
because of another bar down the street that presents full female frontal
nudity, even though it's against the law.</P>
<P>Pecker had two sisters, as well.  The younger one is a hyper child
addicted to sugar.  The older sister is the hostess at a gay bar, trade
show.</P>
<P>They are all his subjects. It is through the thieving of Pecker's best
friend that he has plenty of film for his masterpieces.  With a bit of
misdirection, he loads his pockets with rolls and rolls.  When they
convince Pecker's boss at the diner to allow a "showing" of his photos,
all of his subjects come to view them.  Additionally, an artist's rep from
New York sees a flyer and visits as well.  She loves his work and arranges
a showing in the big city.  That's when all of their lives change.  There
are some very funny moments.  Except for the "beaver" shot in the illegal
show, there is not really any nudity.  Rather there are somewhat
suggestive scenes of all types, especially in the gay bar.</P>
<P>It is an enjoyable movie if you are an aficionado of Waters' films.</P>
