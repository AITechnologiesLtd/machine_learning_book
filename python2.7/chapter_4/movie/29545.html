<PRE>THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE</PRE>
<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 USA Films/ Working Title 
 Director: Joel Coen
 Writer:  Joel Coen, Ethan Coen    
 Cast: Bill Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, Michael
Badalucco, James Gandolfini, Jon Polito, Scarlett Johansson,
Richard Jenkins, Tony Shalhoub, </P>
<P>   I don't know whether the Coens got their inspiration for this title
from Hughes Mearns' ditty, "As I was going up the stair/ I met a
man who wasn't there./ He wasn't there again today./ I wish, I
wish he'd stay away," but their central figure, an anti-hero (read:
schlub), is the sort who is regularly ignored and who is himself
barely aware that he exists.  The Coens' noir film is inspired in
part from the detective novels of James Cain ("Double
Indemnity," "The Postman Always Rings Twice") but crime is only
a takeoff point for an examination of Big Themes like innocence,
evil and hypocrisy.  Situated in a small town in Northern
California during the summer of 1949, "The Man Who Wasn't
There" was photographed by Roger Deakins with color film, then
transcribed to black-and-white as though the celluloid ran through
a technological time machine.  The result is a piece whose visual
style glistens, with bold distinctions between the two colors rather
than the sort of graying over which was common in films taken
during the forties.</P>
<P>  A long work of almost two hours--which could have used more
of editors Roderick Jaynes and Tricia Cook's toil to speed up the
languid pace--the Coen's latest effort looks like the work which
they have called their favorite, Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a
Doubt"--a pulp-story work about a young girl who realizes that
her uncle is a murderer.   Thematically, however, the picture
brings to mind Kafka and Dostoevski even more than Cain and
Hitchcock in its existential probing of the sad life of a middle-aged
man who rarely talks (except when he is narrating his story to the
theater audience), seldom changes his facial expression, and
smokes so much that we can't be blamed for thinking that he'll
die before he suffers from any state-imposed punishment for
murder.  This time the Coens save the surrealism for the
concluding moments: don't expect the flamboyance of "Barton
Fink," which goes off-the-wall bizarre, the playfully high spirits of
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?", or the big-city corporate ambiance
of "The Hudsucker Proxy."  What you do get, nonetheless, is a
captivating examination of melancholia, duplicity, and an
astounding performance by man-of-many-faces Billy Bob
Thornton--his best achievement to date.</P>
<P>    When the story opens, narrator Billy Bob Thornton in the
eponymous role of Ed makes sure to let us know that he is not
only "just" a barber but "only" the guy manning the second chair--
signalling us in the audience that he considers himself of no
particular import in this life.  He works for his brother-in-law,
Frank (Michael Badalucco), getting the job because he is married
to Doris (Frances McDormand).  Were he born later, he would
probably be one of those barbers who never learned to be a
stylist--he just can't cut it, he knows it, and he is too Beckettian to
do anything about his plight.  Nonetheless he becomes
fascinated with rug-wearing con man Creighton Tolliver (Jon
Polito), who offers him a silent partnership in a dry cleaning
business, as long as he can come up with $10,000 to finance a
store.  When he blackmails his best friend, successful retailer Big
Dave (James Gandolfini), he gets caught up in a crime caper that
spirals out of control, bringing to mind (to mine, at least), the
expressionist theatrical work "Machinal"--about an anonymous
clerk in a dismal office who murders his boss.</P>
<P>   The movie won for Joel Coen the Best Director's award at
Cannes, understandably so, as he elicits startling performances
not only from the remarkable Billy Bob Thornton but from Coen-
regular Tony Shalhoub in the role of hotshot lawyer Freddy
Riedenschneider.  Shalhoub eats up the scenery as he points out
what we all know--that the finding of a person's innocence or guilt
depends in no small part on the quality of his defense. 
Riedenschneider, a larger-than-life guy who serves as a striking
contrast to Ed, stays in the best hotels and orders the most
exotic dishes he can find on the menu of a coffee shop in a
Sacramento suburb of 1940s.  He orders oysters (no such luck)
while Ed can think of nothing more to ask for but coffee. 
Riedenschneider also serves as an contrast to the lethargic real
estate attorney, Walter Abundas (Richard Jenkins), who virtually
falls asleep to the sound of his own voice.  </P>
<P>   As a portrait of America during an allegedly more innocent time
than our own, "The Man Who Wasn't There" succeeds in digging
under the Norman Rockwell portraits to show the venality,
chicanery, and cupidity of a typical Babbitt-like area of our
country, entertaining us subtly, deliberately, and on an elevated
plane.</P>
