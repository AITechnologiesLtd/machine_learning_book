<PRE>                            DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  McClane is back, picking his wife up at
     the airport and foiling a plot by mercenaries to free a
     Noriega-like dictator.  Much in the mold of a James Bond
     film, DIE HARD 2 has some good suspense, good action, nice
     visuals, and minorities in good roles that did not
     necessarily call for minorities.  McClane is not as creative
     as in DIE HARD, but his powers of deduction are tested just
     as much.  Rating: high +1.</PRE>
<P>     This year there is no James Bond film, in fact, but there is a
reasonable substitute.  There is no film about British superspy James Bond
being sent out to save England, but there is a film about L.A. supercop John
McClane sending himself out to pick up his wife from Dulles Airport in
Washington D.C.  McClane is played by Bruce Willis who is my idea of no
actor, but in films such as this can be a reasonable substitute.  Of course,
dealing with an airport during Christmas rush is never easy.  McClane has to
deal with airport police who ticket him for parking in a no-parking zone and
with a bunch of Army-bred mercenaries who are trying to free Manuel Noriega
(thinly disguised under the character name Esperanza).  DIE HARD 2 is the
story of how McClane gets the airport police to tear up the parking ticket
and how he picks up his wife on a night when Dulles is not at its dullest.
I will not say exactly how McClane gets the ticket torn up but it involves
killing a bunch of "bad guys" and saving a lot of "good guys" (to use his
sophisticated jargon).  It also involves him being just about the only guy
with intelligence and pluck in an airport full of and run by jerks.</P>
<P>     DIE HARD 2 *is* a big beefy action film much in the style of a James Bond
film.  It follows the time-honored traditions of Bond films, like all the
luck working for the hero.  McClane makes no false moves while trained
commandos make mistakes such as running out of ammunition without realizing
it.  Eight bad guys can be having a showdown with McClane but they will very
obligingly attack one at a time so McClane can pick them off like Horatio at
the Bridge.  Later, when there is one piece of equipment that McClane really
needs it just sort of falls into his hands, no muss, no fuss.  That is not
to say there is not a whole lot of mussing and fussing in the film.  But
McClane is the sort of hero who can go through a trash compactor, wince and
maybe bleed a little to remind the audience that it is painful to be
compacted, and five minutes later he is back to normal.  His bones must be
made of the stuff they built Patton tanks from (or perhaps should build them
from).</P>
<P>     There are a number of reasons the plot could not really proceed as it
does.  McClane gets an identification on a character based on fingerprints
that he faxes from a car rental stand.  Even assuming he could coerce the
car rental agency to do his faxing, it is very unlikely the print at the
other end would have anything but black blotches.  But I guess part of the
fun of seeing a film like this is picking holes in the screenplay, which in
this case was written by Doug Richardson and Steven de Souza.  The latter
wrote 48 HOURS and here is adapting 58 MINUTES, the novel by Walter Wager on
which DIE HARD 2 is based.</P>
<P>     Visual effects are impressive and provided by Industrial Light and
Magic.  One very nice shot involves McClane sort of flying away from an
explosion but toward the camera.  The musical score is by Michael Kamen.
Rare is the film review that has a spoiler warning for a comment about the
musical score, but this one does.  Jump to the next paragraph if you wish to
avoid it.  Through the film Kamen often uses a theme for the villains that
sounds just like the first eight notes of Sibelius's "Finlandia."  Well, I
had always thought they did sound ominous, but was it coincidence or was
Kamen really quoting?  Sibelius's tribute to Finland has, after all, little
to do with the story at hand.  Then in the final suspense scene the
orchestra finally breaks out into a big chunk of "Finlandia."  The end
credits then are a full orchestral performance of "Finlandia."  It sounds
mighty good in Dolby Surroundsound.  That's worth fifty cents of the
admission price all by itself.</P>
<P>     This is an enjoyable action film: nothing requiring great thought, but
certainly enjoyable.  I would give it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
