                         THAT THING YOU DO 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tom Everett Scott, Jonathan Schaech, Liv Tyler, Steve Zahn, Ethan
Embry, Tom Hanks, Charlize Theron, Obba Babatunde Director: Tom Hanks
Screenplay: Tom Hanks Music: Howard Shore U.S.</P>
<P>Some of us carry the burden of two jobs in our life time - the job we do
for a living, and the job which we wished we were doing for a living.
Then there are those who find the two are actually one and the same -
how blessed are they.</P>
<P>So it is not surprising when a talented drum player (Everett Scott),
locked in the confines of a stuffy hardware store, doomed to follow in
the footsteps of his father the owner, breaks free of his paternal
chains to seek his life long dream - playing music. Dreams become
reality and soon the band 'The Wonders' is formed. Their one hit 'That
Thing You Do' climbs the record charts at a record-breaking, phenomenal
rate. This song is repeated so many times during the movie, that you
will either be jumping up and down on the dance floor with the 'Go Go'
dancers, or tearing your hair out with utter insanity.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks in his directing debut, has chosen a movie piece well suited
to his genre. He seems to relish and thrive on anything 60'ish. Namely,
the chocolate eating, mother loving 'Gump Man', or plummeting rockets of
the 13th attempt which both fall somewhere on the JFK timeline. So where
does 'That Thing You Do' fit into this picture - well probably some
where between Vietnam and the Moon.</P>
<P>Hanks has decided to fill his movie with youth, colour and music. These
new faces Everett Scott, Tyler, Schaech and Zahn makes the most of their
opportunity to display their talents in 'That Thing You Do'. Knowing
full well that this 'make it' or 'break it' movie could terminally label
them as 'One Hit Wonders' or 'Multi-hit Contracts'.  An adventurous
directing effort by Hanks, who also contributed to the musical score of
this movie.</P>
<P>Whatever caused the ultimate destruction of the 'Beatles'? Some people
will say Yoko Ono, others will say anti-psychotic medication. Who knows?
Maybe they just got tired of each other. In this movie, it only requires
the selfish ambition of one individual, to destroy the web of friendship
which was in truth the basis of this band's success. A pleasant movie at
any level, but unfortunately, 'That Thing You Do' doesn't quite do it
for me.</P>
<P>Pop Feel Scale: 0% Madonna / *THE WONDERS* / The Beatles 100%</P>
