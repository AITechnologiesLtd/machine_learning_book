<PRE>The Last Days of Disco</PRE>
<P>The Last Days of Disco is the middle part of Whit Stillmans
yuppie trilogy, bookended by Metropolitan and Barcelona. Though
it is chronologically the earliest of the three, Disco shows what
happens to the characters in Metropolitan once they get out of
college, and it anticipates the Spanish setting of Barcelona.
None of the three movies have characters in common, of course,
but thats just a technicality.</P>
<P>Whit Stillmans films are all of a piece. The characters are
generically the same brainy, well-off Eastern kids living in the
big city, inhabiting a scene, making witty dialog. Its like
Friends with a brain. Dialog is key, and always wonderfully
written. These people talk a lot, they are smart, often too
smart, and they tend to be rather mean to each other. As such
Stillman is an acquired taste. I like him, but I wouldnt force
him on anyone else. </P>
<P>The time is the very early 80s. Disco covers six months in the
lives of a handful of post-college kids living and working in New
York. Two work in publishing, one in advertising, another is an
assistant District Attorney, and the last is a manager at a club
based loosely on the old Studio 54. They all have a history
dating back years or at least months, and they all hang around
the club, which is run by a tax-evading scumbag. They work during
the day, go clubbing at night, share apartments, have sex and
talk and talk and talk. </P>
<P>Now I always like two things about a Stillman film.  I like the
crisp, pseudo-intellectual dialog (a deconstruction of Lady and
the Tramp is hilarious) and I like the characters themselves,
their relations with each other, the way they insult each other
and fall in and out of love with each other and bother each other
until whatever it was holding them together falls apart and they
all go their separate ways with a feeling of regret. I shouldnt
like them, because they are all rich (or at least come from
affluent families) and somewhat snobbish and they all have
certain expectations out of life and are at least a little
resentful of outsiders. Stillman was one of them, by the way, and
thats probably why hes able to portray rich kids so
sympathetically. He doesnt take them altogether seriously, of
course, but neither does he treat them like cardboard cutouts in
a class warfare morality play.  Stillman allows his characters
all the dignity that they deserve, which is not to say that he
finds them particularly admirable.  Theyre just people.</P>
<P>The ending is no surprise, of course; everyone knows disco died,
and these people felt it. Felt it hard, actually. They like disco
and the ending explains a little why some people might actually
find such a thing valuable. It was a stage in their lives and
when it ended they all moved on, to another scene or another
stage, with, as I said, regret, and even a little wisdom. Life
has a way of happening like that.  Highly recommended, if you
liked Metropolitan.</P>
