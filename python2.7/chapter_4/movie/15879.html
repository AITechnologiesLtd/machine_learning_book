<P>>From the man who brought us GHOSTBUSTERS and TWINS, comes a story
starring Han Solo, Harrison Ford, and the woman presently dating TV
star Ellen DeGeneres, Anne Heche. Director Ivan Reitman straps himself
behind the camera for this fuzzy piece of ROMANCING THE STONE
(7.5/10)-lite.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Loving, romantic man takes his lady of choice to an exotic island for
some time alone together. While there, she gets called away on
business, and is taken to Tahiti, by a carefree and wayward pilot.
During a storm, their plane gets hit by lightning and crashes onto an
unknown island. Stuck with one another, the duo attempt to find a way
back to civilization, and gradually get to know each other better.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mindless fluff piece does not pass itself off as anything more than a
simple 95-minute exercise in mild comedy, overly precise romance,
decent chemistry and a non-threatening adventure. I enjoyed this movie
on the whole because I was able to rest my brain for a quick little
while, and allow myself to follow the misadventures of two charming
actors, whose fate never seemed like much of a mystery to me. The film
was easy to digest, well enough to enjoy along a round of tasty hot
nachos, and perfectly paced as to never allow you to fully grasp the
generic nature of its essence.</P>
<P>Kudos go out to both Harrison Ford and Anne Heche, who luckily for the
audience, seem to have sparked off a few rays of charm into their
characters. The opposite can be said of David Schwimmer, who still
cannot seem to play anything but that dolt-headed puppy-eyed love
schmuck from his hit TV show "Friends". That aside, I was impressed by
his character's real struggle over extra-curricular sexual activities,
and the actual conscience that he displayed in its aftermath. Unlike
many men in other movies, this character showed us that a man isn't
always ready to jump into bed with a chesty knockout at a drop of a
dime, but that morals, ethics and one's conscience always play a
revolving part in any such decision.</P>
<P>Overall, the film doesn't have many standout scenes to write home
about, but does offer some beautiful shots of the island's panoramic
possessions, along with some engaging performances by its leads. You'll
laugh, you'll sigh, you won't fall asleep and you'll forget about the
whole thing in the morning. If these are some of the elements that you
are looking for in a short film mixed in with a little adventure, then
this one's your bag o' nuts! If not, skip this, and your life will
forever be the same for having missed it. </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Perhaps the most fateful casting of Harrison Ford's career was for a
role that he very nearly passed up. A promising young director named
George Lucas offered him a supporting part in his film AMERICAN
GRAFFITI (7/10), but Ford walked off the set in disgust when he learned
that he would be paid only $485 a week, less than half what he was
earning at that time as a carpenter. Luckily, he changed his mind when
the studio offered him an extra fifteen dollars a week. He also got the
part of Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (8/10), after
Spielberg and Lucas could not schedule filming of the movie around
their first choice's TV schedule, as Tom Selleck had a commitment to
his hit TV show "Magnum P.I.".
Harrison's wife is a screenwriter in her own right, and counts E.T.
(8/10) and Martin Scorsese's KUNDUN among her handful of credits. In
fact, in 1996, Harrison was listed as one of 50 people barred from
entering Tibet, after Disney clashed with Chinese officials over the
film KUNDUN, which his wife wrote.
Anne Heche's father, Donald Heche, was a choir director in a Baptist
church who frequented gay bars at night. Heche found out about her
father's double life at the age of twelve, as he lay dying of AIDS. "I
watched my dad disintegrate from AIDS because he was ashamed to be what
he wanted to be," Heche relates. He died the following year. In 1991,
she won a Daytime Emmy for playing Outstanding Younger Actress in a
Daytime Drama Series for TV's "Another World".
Actress Jacqueline Obradors, who plays the playful Angelica in this
film, was discovered by a producer while she was working as a grocery
store clerk.
Director Ivan Reitman was born in Czechoslovakia, but brought up in
Canada.
David Schwimmer graduated from Northwestern University. His mother is a
lawyer who took care of Roseanne's first divorce.</P>
