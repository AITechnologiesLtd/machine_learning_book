<PRE>.                               AIR FORCE ONE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     When one sees Glenn Close portraying the vice-president, one begins
to realize just how much she looks (and can act) like Gerald Ford.</P>
<P>     Frankly, I was shocked to discover how much I liked AIR FORCE ONE. 
Yes, it has villainous Russians who can never see our good guy President
(Harrison Ford) when he's hiding right in front of them (much less shoot
him).  Yes, it has Secret Service guys who die at the hand of the enemy
like flies in a bug zapper.  Yes, it has the cheesiest special effects
this side of of a "Tom & Jerry" cartoon.  Yes, it features a rambling
Gary Oldman in one of his clearly improvised looney-tune
terrorist/psychopath roles.  I could go on and on...</P>
<P>     But I won't.  Instead, I'll tell you that AIR FORCE ONE (DIE HARD
on a plane with a President on it, thus distinguishing it from DIE HARD
II, PASSENGER 57, and EXECUTIVE DECISION) is a spellbinding film, one
that grips the viewer from the very start and doesn't let up until 140
minutes later, plot holes or no.  It also may be the funniest movie I've
seen all year -- and I still can't figure out if it was intentional or
not!</P>
<P>     And I don't care.  AIR FORCE ONE has great action, a good story,
and once you get past the melodramatics of his co-stars, one of Harrison
Ford's best performances, ever.  In fact, I'd be so bold as to say that
AF0 is probably the best new film of 1997 to date.</P>
<PRE>     Or maybe I'm just losing my mind.</PRE>
