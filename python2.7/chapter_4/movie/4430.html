<P>     Apparently, the producers of JUMANJI wanted this film to be a 
JURASSIC PARK for 1995's holiday season.  If so, it's a badly misplaced, 
and ultimately futile, hope.  For, although no one would suspect Steven 
Spielberg's 1993 dino-picture of having a plot worthy of great 
literature, at least it had a storyline -- something this film is 
lacking.  JUMANJI takes approximately one-hundred minutes for four 
people to play a board game.  The result isn't much more fun or 
involving than watching a few friends play Monopoly.  Even the Robin 
Williams manic humor can't save JUMANJI, at least not entirely.</P>
<P>     The film's biggest claim to fame are its special effects.  
Unfortunately, they don't look as impressive in extended scenes on the 
big screen as they do in short clips on TV.  In fact, there are times 
when the sequences of charging rhinos, elephants, and zebras look 
downright cheesy.  The monkeys certainly aren't convincing and the 
LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS Audrey II-type man-eating plant would have been 
more effective had it broken into a song.  ("Feed Me"?)  JURASSIC PARK 
showed how amazing computer-generated creatures can be when properly 
handled; JUMANJI shows what happens when less care is given to the 
technology.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a brief segment in 1869, where two children 
furtively take a board game called Jumanji into the dark depths of a 
forest, where they bury it, uttering a quick prayer for the soul of 
whoever digs it up.  Switch to Brantford, New Hampshire in 1969, where 
with a boy named Alan Parrish is getting ready to run away from home.  
Before he leaves, however, he decides to play one round of a game -- 
called Jumanji -- that he recently found near his father's work site.  
So, along with his friend Sarah, he sets up the board, rolls the dice, 
then gets sucked out of this world into some dark elsewhere.</P>
<P>     Twenty-six years later, Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley 
Pierce) move into Alan's old house.  They find the Jumanji game and 
start to play.  Judy goes first, and her move causes surprise, real-life 
appearances by lions and monkeys.  Then, when it's Peter's turn, Alan 
mysteriously re-appears, much older and looking suspiciously like Robin 
Williams with a lot of excess facial hair.  A grown-up Sarah (Bonnie 
Hunt) soon joins the trio, so all the players are assembled.  From then 
on, it's a race to finish the game before rampaging safari rejects 
destroy Brantford.  </P>
<P>     The movie goes something like this:  someone makes a move, then the 
characters spend the next ten minutes running away from whatever animals 
they unleash.  Then it's the next player's turn.  And so on... until the 
game (and the movie) ends.  JUMANJI comes across more as a blueprint for 
some deluxe amusement park ride than a legitimate film.  It's a 
pointless trek.  The "adventure" is repetitive, he thrills are brief, 
and the moments of character-building drama are effete.  Only the comedy 
works, but there's not enough of it to justify an entire motion picture.</P>
<P>     This is the kind of embarrassing dud that results when Hollywood 
places special effects and a neat concept over a well-told story.  The 
children's book JUMANJI, written by Chris Van Allsburg, makes for good 
reading for a young audience, but it's hardly the sort of material upon 
which to base a major motion picture.  The men and women behind JUMANJI 
didn't just lose a turn; they lost their way.  </P>
