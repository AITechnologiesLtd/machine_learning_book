<PRE>Alien Resurrection
Director: Jean-Pierre Jeunet
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, Michael Wincott, Brad
Dourif
Rated: R</PRE>
<P>If you compared the basics of Aliens (the second installment of the series)
with Resurrection (the fourth) you would assume they were identical. Ellen
Ripley (Weaver) leads a group of gritty, mega-gun toting renegades through
the bowels of a ship, looking to destroy the queen alien, in an effort to
save themselves and mankind. Unfortunatley for the gang there is an evil guy
lurking about who's real intention is to save the alien species, even if it
means destroying the humans on board. I half expected Paul Reiser to pop out
and say, "Ripley, if they can clone you, then there's just a whole bunch of
"me's" out there." Eh. Not so much. Despite the core of similarities to
previous Alien films, Resurrection has enough slam-bang action, enough
surprises (and plenty of goo) that in my estimation, it is the best of the
sequels thus far.</P>
<P>What's different about Resurrection is that Ripley has had a complete
personality makeover. Her only similarity to the former Ripley is that she
looks astonishingly like Sigourney Weaver. The fourth installment takes place
approximately 200 years after she died in Alien 3. But those sneaky
scientists managed to find a strand of her DNA in some blood from the prison
compound and, combined with Alien DNA, create a new, more powerful and more
dynamic Ripley clone. One fascinating element about Resurrection is that
since Ripley (still the series' heroine) is part Alien, she has some
compassion for them. She has natural instincts that tell her where they are
lurking, ditching the computer tracers from all the earlier films. ("It's
right behind you man! Get out of there man!") There are some psychosexual
elements that I won't presume to ruin for you. Let's just say there's a lot
of goo involved. Pretty funky stuff.</P>
<P>Another thing that Alien Resurrection offers that the first three hardly
attempted were major digital effects, which make up most of the Aliens you
see in this film. Here's a tip; whenever you see an Alien in a close-up, it
is a slime-splashed animatronic, its really there. If you see an Alien
running or swimming or climbing, it's digital. I tell you this because you
may not be able to tell, they are done astonishinly well. </P>
<P>For true Alien fans, Resurrection re-hashes some of the old tricks (not
everyone is what you think they are). There is a classic flamethrower which
gets quite a bit of use in one scene. Acid blood plays a big part in this one
too. But not everything is old hat. There are a few new Alien surprises in
this one, which, if you can get past the Grand Canyon sized plot holes, are
pretty creepy and cool.</P>
<P>This is indeed the most violent, gory and gooey Alien film to date. (No, it
ain't Flubber.) But Jeunet manages to make the grotesque somehow fitting and
almost appealing in this fourth installment. Very seldom did I get the
feeling that there was a disembowelment for no reason.  Everything seems to
have its place here. It kept me on the edge of my seat, it made me laugh
(appropriately, of course) and it made me glad that this was such a strong
rebound from the last sequel. What's more, who knows how long they can
continue this series now? After Alien 3, we were pretty dang sure it was
over. But ever since they cloned those sheeps in England, these Hollywood
people have a whole new arena to play with.</P>
<P>3 out of 4 stars
