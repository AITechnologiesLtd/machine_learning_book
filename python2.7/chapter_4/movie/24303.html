<PRE>Where the Heart Is
A film review by Max Messier</PRE>
<P>Long ago, films were constructed of strong dialogue, original
characters, memorable plot points, and solid acting.  One of the best
examples that Hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found
in the new film Where the Heart Is.</P>
<P>This opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows
the tragic, and I mean tragic, life of Novalee Nation (Natalie
Portman).  Hitting the road with her hick, guitar-playing boyfriend in a
rusted-out GM, Novalee dreams of the blue skies of Bakersfield and
sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby,
due in a month.</P>
<P>Stopping off at a nearby Wal-Mart for a quick rest, Novalee's boyfriend
decides to take off and leaves her there.  Novalee then decides to
secretly hole up in the Wal-Mart (because she's not the brightest bulb
in the stagelights).  A wacky librarian (Keith David) comes to her
rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the
outdoors section of the store.  Then the she moves in with a family,
befriends everyone in town -- including Ashley Judd's character (who has
FIVE kids and still can work part-time as a nurse) -- fights off
religious freaks, survives a tornado, breaks the heart of the wacky
librarian that saved her, receives an inheritance, builds a Martha
Stewart-esque house, becomes an award-winning photographer, and manages
to always look like she stepped out of a Cosmo shoot, all while not once
doing anything with her kid.</P>
<P>This film is terrible.  The directing is awful: It seems director Matt
Williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every
one of them, over and over and over again.  We get pathetic and ugly
acting by Natalie Portman, who can do good work.  A disjointed pacing of
key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw Steve
Prefontaine off.  A subplot that actually validates the actions of the
boyfriend who abandoned Novalee in the Wal-Mart parking lot.  An
embarrassing display of emotions by the characters, making the audience
ill.  Taking two great comedic screenwriters, Babaloo Mandel and Lowell
Ganz, and forcing them to write drama on par with Oprah's Book Club.
Altogether, it has the feeling of being trapped at home, watching a very
bad television mini-series and wishing it to end, only the remote is
broken.</P>
<P>However, the main problem with the film is that it never answers the
most poignant question brought up:  Where is the heart?  No one ever
seems to find it in this piece of junk.</P>
