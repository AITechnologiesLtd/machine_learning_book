<P>     Ever since PULP FICTION blazed its way into the spotlight in 1994, 
countless films have attempted to re-capture the heady mix of violence, 
snappy dialogue, and dark comedy that Quentin Tarantino tapped into.  
Thus far, it has proven to be a difficult brew to distill, as countless 
lackluster attempts have proven.  SUICIDE KINGS, from first-time feature 
director Peter O'Fallon, is one of the few motion pictures to come 
close.  And, while the narrative is a little too erratic to ascend to 
the PULP FICTION level, the tone and style are on target.  For those who 
aren't offended by extreme profanity and violence, SUICIDE KINGS offers 
a kinetic and surprisingly funny two hours.</P>
<P>     Once upon a time, in another life, Charlie Bennett (played by the 
always-delightful Christopher Walken) went by the name of Carlo 
Bartolucci.  Under that identity, as the head of the New York City 
Mafia, he was one of the most feared men in America.  But times change, 
and Charlie has gone legit.  Now, he's just an average, tax-paying 
businessman.  His wits have grown dull and he lets down his guard too 
easily -- as he discovers when he makes the mistake of trusting a group 
of apparently-harmless, rich, college-age kids that he meets at his 
regular restaurant.  They are Brett (Jay Mohr), Avery (Henry Thomas), 
Max (Sean Patrick Flanery), and T.K. (Jeremy Sisto) -- and their goal is 
to kidnap Charlie and hold him hostage.  But, although the former 
organized crime kingpin nearly foils the attempt, he is eventually 
subdued and drugged.  When he awakens, he finds himself tied to a chair 
inside a New Jersey mansion, and notices that his captors have cut off 
one of his fingers. </P>
<P>     Charlie is quickly informed why he has been snatched.  Apparently, 
Avery's sister, Lisa (Laura Harris), is the victim of an unrelated 
kidnapping, and the men holding her are demanding a $2 million ransom.  
Avery and his friends have decided that Charlie is an important enough 
underworld figure that he can use his old connections to free Lisa.  
And, not willing to leave anything to chance, they decide that force is 
the most viable form of persuasion.  However, while Charlie may be out 
of practice, he's no dummy, and, as the tension mounts, he plays his 
captors off against each other, widening fissures in their 
relationships.  Meanwhile, his faithful henchman, Lono Vecchio (Denis 
Leary), is closing in on the place where his boss is being held.</P>
<P>     If you can get past some of the film's basic setup 
implausibilities, SUICIDE KINGS is a lot of fun.  It's more of a dark 
comedy than anything else, and several scenes are borderline-hilarious.  
The film is somewhat less successful in its attempt to develop a mystery 
(which of Charlie's captors, if any, is in on Lisa's kidnapping?) -- 
there are a few unnecessary red herrings and at least one plot twist too 
many.  Nevertheless, this is just one facet of a clever and involving 
storyline, and the real meat of the movie is the verbal chess match 
between Charlie and the others, who treat him with mixture of fear and 
awe.  The dialogue is well-written and director O'Fallon brings an 
element of tension to the quirky atmosphere.  With all of the guns, 
knives, needles, and frayed nerves, it's difficult to guess what's going 
to happen next.</P>
<P>     I also enjoyed the subplot featuring Denis Leary, who plays the 
most Tarantino-esque character in the film, a hitman who wears $1500 
shoes and offers a homeless person $500 to better himself.  His 
interaction with his sidekick is reminiscent of the Travolta/Jackson 
exchanges in PULP FICTION, only here the subject matter is shoes, not 
burgers.  There's also an odd-but-effective scene in which Vecchio 
chastens a man with a penchant for beating up women.  </P>
<P>     Given his track record, it should come as no surprise that Walken 
steals the movie.  While the role of Charlie isn't new territory for the 
veteran actor, there are a few twists, since he's essentially the "good 
guy" here (at least in as much as an ex-mobster can be a "good guy").  
In one of his most impressive outings in recent years, Walken never goes 
over the top -- for him, this is a subdued portrayal, but it's fully of 
dry, self-deprecating wit and subtle menace.  Charlie is constantly 
joking with his captors, but none of them forgets how truly dangerous he 
is, and what the consequences could be if he gets free.  The other 
bravura performance belongs to Denis Leary, who was born to play a part 
like this with this sort of clipped, rapid-fire dialogue.  It suits him 
perfectly, and, while Vecchio is far from a well-developed character, 
he's always a pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>     The actors playing the young captors are less charismatic, and 
their characters are not as interesting.  The best of the bunch is Jay 
Mohr (the rival agent in JERRY MAGUIRE), who radiates hubris and 
contempt.  Sean Patrick Flanery (POWDER) gives a pleasantly relaxed and 
unforced turn as the most laid-back of the group.  I was not, however, 
all that impressed with either Henry Thomas (E.T.'s friend, who grew up 
to be in LEGENDS OF THE FALL) or Jeremy Sisto (CLUELESS).  Both are 
lackluster, although, in Thomas' case, he's playing an introvert.  Comic 
relief is effectively provided by Johnny Galecki as Ira, the unwitting 
fifth kidnapper, who becomes involved because his friends are using his 
parents' house.  ("Who tracked mud across the floor??")</P>
<P>     SUICIDE KINGS is a promising beginning to director Peter O'Fallon's 
big-screen career.  It isn't a perfect motion picture, but there's 
enough here to earn an enthusiastic recommendation for those who enjoy 
this genre.  While the approach isn't new, the style is invigorating and 
the storyline boasts at least a few original ideas.  The result is a 
deliciously demented comedy/thriller that will leave Tarantino fans 
applauding.</P>
