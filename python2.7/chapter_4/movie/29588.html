<PRE>MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>With several Hollywood releases grounded in the wake of the September 11th
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington (one film in particular, "Big
Trouble," featured hijacking and carry-on nuclear weapons among its many
plot devices), it is indeed timely--yet purely coincidental--for an
inspired bit of lunacy known as "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" to be
reissued to theaters.  Well, just the one theater that is.</P>
<P>This 2001 re-release of the Python's first full-length feature film (if
you discount 1971's "And Now for Something Completely Different" which was,
after all, a loosely-edited series of television sketches) features a brand
new negative, stereo soundtrack, and 25 seconds of missing footage!</P>
<P>More focused than their future work (and looking less dated now than ever
before, surprisingly), "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is a medieval romp
filled to the pink curly edges with your typically irreverent and extremely
silly Monty Python humor (if you've been in a time capsule these last few
decades, Monty Python was the collective name of a bunch of terribly
talented comedians--Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle,
Terry Jones, and Michael Palin--who got together in the summer of 1969 to
produce a ground-breaking (and terribly silly) TV series called "Monty
Python's Flying Circus" for the BBC).  Set in England 932 A.D. (but
actually filmed in Scotland), "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" follows
King Arthur of Camelot (Chapman) on a mission to round up his knights of
the round table.  In the process he is given a quest by God (courtesy Terry
Gilliam's typically outrageous cut-out animation) to seek out the Holy
Grail, that magical chalice that floats aloft over various
impressive-looking Scottish castles (one of which, we're told, is fake).</P>
<P>The silliness kicks in from the opening credits (with Swedish subtitles
and spurious moose references a plenty) and never lets up.  These knights
don't actually ride noble steeds, for example.  Instead, they prance around
as if on horseback with a long-suffering serf trotting behind them knocking
two coconut shells together.  Glancing down a list of some of the
characters our valiant fellows encounter upon their journey gives you a
pretty good idea as to what to expect: Second Soldier with a Keen Interest
in Birds; A Quite Extraordinarily Rude Frenchman; Sir Robin the
Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Launcelot; Roger the Shrubber (A Shrubber);
Leader of the Knights Who Say "Ni!"; The Page Crushed by a Rabbit; Patsy
(Arthur's Trusty Steed); and so on.</P>
<P>As with most of their work, the Pythons don't skimp of the details.  What
makes "'Holy Grail" such a delight is that not only is the humor thick and
fast but so is the medieval muck--the laughs are made even stronger by a
heightened level of authenticity (with, perhaps, the exception of the furry
keeper of the cave of Aaargh and all that blood spurting from severed
limbs--a black knight who stands in Arthur's way is reduced to a
name-calling torso, for example).  The writer/performers play multiple
roles, of course (to keep the costs down?), and it's great fun watching
each one show up as somebody sillier than the first.  Crammed with acres of
quotable dialogue, the film ploughs along from one inspired bit to the next.</P>
<P>To this day, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" still "makes Ben Hur look
like an epic" (to quote one of the film's original tag lines) but in the 26
years that have elapsed since the film debuted, those lines seem to have
blurred considerably.</P>
