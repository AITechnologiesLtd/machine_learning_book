<P>The Butcher Boy (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>No film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as Neil
Jordan's harrowing, humorous, horrifying adaptation of Patrick McCabe's
novel about young lad Francie Brady's (Eamonn Owens) descent into madness
in 1960s Ireland.  On one hand, it was difficult for me to become invested
in Francie's story because he is such an unsavory character, unjustifyably
venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor Mrs. Nugent
(Fiona Shaw).  On another hand, I found it difficult to laugh at some of
Francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick,
needy child, having been raised by a drunken father (Stephen Rea) and a
suicidal mother (Aisling O'Sullivan).  On yet another hand, I also found it
difficult to completely sympathize with Francie during his more emotional
scenes because some of his, for lack of a better word, "bad" deeds are so
incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he
performs them.</P>
<P>However, The Butcher Boy's power is undeniable, and the film as a whole is
unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing.  What makes it so
unsettling is the Francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude
about everything, expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by
the adult Francie (Rea again).  Think Heavenly Creatures played largely for
laughs, and you'll sort of understand.  Anchoring the whole film is the
astonishing debut performance of Owens; love Francie or hate him, you
cannot take your eyes off of Owens.  The Butcher Boy truly is a twisted,
unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable.  In the
lobby after the screening, I overheard one man raving about how great yet
disturbing it was; I also heard one particularly offended woman say with
disgust, "That movie was SO UNFUNNY!"</P>

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
