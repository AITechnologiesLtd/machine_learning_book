<PRE>A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 72</PRE>
<P>One problem common to most plays that have been adapted for
the movies is that there's too much dialogue, and not
enough action.  Scenes of two people talking (or, more
likely, one person mostly talking and one person mostly
listening) seem to stretch on and on.  Of course, if the
script is good enough, all is forgiven.</P>
<P>Although "A Streetcar Named Desire" received an Oscar
nomination for Best Screenplay, the script, based on the
Tennessee Williams' play, is not strong enough to fully
overcome the stagy nature of the film.  The character of
Blanche (Vivien Leigh) in particular is burdened with
rambling speeches, which she must deliver in her affected
whisper.</P>
<P>"A Streetcar Named Desire" has aging beauty Blanche forced
to leave her hometown, as the family estate has been lost,
and her scandalous behaviour has made her not welcome.
She moves in with sister Stella (Kim Hunter) in New Orleans,
who lives with brutish husband Stanley (Marlon Brando).
There, the emotionally fragile Blanche spins lies to cover
her scandals, and to further a romance with lonely Mitch
(Karl Malden).  As her true past comes out, Blanche becomes
the only person to believe her lies.</P>
<P>The film caused a sensation, as did the play.  Brando,
who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, has
the most controversial role, a swaggering, bullying
blue-collar character.  Both Malden and Brando make
sexual advances on Blanche, with wild gleams in their
eyes.  Blanche is pitied by other women, but is a
subject of derision for men.</P>
<P>I have not seen any of Williams' plays, but several
of his screen adaptions.  From what I have seen, he
appears to be over-rated as a playwright, drawing
excessive publicity through the use of controversial
and sexual themes.</P>
<P>"A Streetcar Named Desire" is a very good film
despite its problems.  The cast is excellent, and
the characters are sharply defined.  The cast
was mostly taken from the successful Broadway
play, with Leigh substituting for Jessica Tandy
as Blanche.  Leigh is so convincing that she has
been identified with the role, her second most
famous after Scarlett in "Gone With the Wind".
It is ironic that her later years are said to
resemble Blanche's character in some ways.</P>
<P>"A Streetcar Named Desire" won Oscars for Best
Actress (Leigh), Best Supporting Actor (Malden),
Best Supporting Actress (Hunter) and for the
sets.  It was also nominated for Best Picture,
Best Director (Elia Kazan) and Best Cinematography.
But despite its critical success, the film is
somewhat over-rated, while more deserving
Kazan efforts such as "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"
and "America, America" are comparitively obscure.</P>
