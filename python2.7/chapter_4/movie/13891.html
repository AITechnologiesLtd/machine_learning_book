<PRE>BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Sometimes a film with such a tantalizing title comes along that
you're compelled to slap down your seven bucks without first seeing the
trailer, reading a synopsis, or even consulting the cast list.  "Billy's
Hollywood Screen Kiss"--say that again?--is one of those films and by the
time you've wrapped your tongue around the nomenclature, you'll realize the
title is one of the better things about the movie.</P>
<P>        "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss" starts out with a sequence
comprised entirely of Polaroid photographs and narration that includes a
bold statement: this film will help you understand some of the differences
between gays and straights.  The film doesn't come close to delivering on
that promise.  In fact, the main problem with the film is that it all too
often sets up an expectation and then fails to provide the goods.</P>
<P>        Billy is a gay, L.A.-based photographer, currently "unemployed and
loveless."  According to many of his friends, this puts him at his creative
peak.</P>
<P>        Encouraged to shoot a series of photographs featuring great
Hollywood screen kisses, like the one exchanged by Deborah Kerr and Burt
Lancaster amidst the pounding surf in "From Here to Eternity," Billy casts
a handful of drag-queen acquaintances in the women's roles.  But he needs a
fresh face, a good-looking male model to substitute for the Clark Gables
and the Jimmy Deans.</P>
<P>        While hanging out in a coffee shop with his girl friend George
(played with Barbra Streisand panache by co-producer Meredith Scott Lynn),
Billy suddenly finds himself gazing into the eyes of an angel, a
blond-haired, blue-eyed Brad Pitt lookalike appropriately named Gabriel.
It's love at first sight, professional ethics be damned!</P>
<P>        Figuring out if Gabriel is gay and, if so, whether he's interested
in Billy, forms the core of "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss."</P>
<P>        For a picture like this to succeed you have to feel some kind of
empathy for the main character.  Empathy, interest, understanding--all of
these help.  I couldn't muster up much.  Not only is Billy unappealing as a
character--perhaps the goatee reminds me of comedic everyman Eric
Schaeffer, who ruins every project he's associated with--but Sean P. Hayes
who plays Billy is a fledgling actor, which causes a further distancing.</P>
<P>        Fortunately the film is peppered with a large collection of minor
characters who *are* appealing, which makes up for a lot.</P>
<P>        The film would have been more interesting, though perhaps not
necessarily as amusing, if it spent as much time focusing on Billy's photo
essay as it does his awkward mumblings and fumblings in the presence of
Gabriel.  Although Billy's daydreams are presented as black-and-white
teasers complete with celluloid leaders, the only Hollywood screen kiss
actually realized is the afore-mentioned "From Here to Eternity" embrace.
I was hoping for more.</P>
<P>        On the other hand, three very enthusiastic drag queens provide an
amusing opening credits sequence plus various "intermissions."  And cult
filmmaker Paul Bartel ("Eating Raoul") appears as a fashion photographer
who offers Gabriel an underwear gig on Catalina.</P>
<P>        Overall "Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss" is a mixed bag--likable,
yet not without its frustrations--and a reminder that one should never
judge a book by its cover.</P>
