<PRE>JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK (2001)
Reviewed on September, 2001
By Jerry Saravia</PRE>
<P>Warning: if you are not a fan of "Clerks" or "Chasing Amy," not to mention
"Mallrats," then it is very likely that you will find little enjoyment in Kevin
Smith's newest film. "Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back" is a delirious joyride
for all View Askew fans, taking us from New Jersey to Hollywood and back with
many belly laughs and a few lulls along the way. It is mandatory that you are
educated in this universe or else, you'll have a joyless time.
To anyone not familiar with View Askew, it is the name of Kevin Smith's
production company in Red Bank, N.J. and the universe in which all his
characters from his first four films reside in. Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob
(Kevin Smith) are the two drug dealers who have appeared in all of Smith's
films. Usually left on the sidelines, they take center stage this time as they
continue selling drugs in front of the Quik Stop convenience store in Leonardo,
N.J. Jay and Silent Bob get wind from their old friend, Brodie (Jason Lee), that
the comic book based on them, Bluntman and Chronic, is getting made into a
Hollywood movie by their other old friend, Banky (also played by Jason Lee).
Huh? Okay, if you saw "Chasing Amy," you'll recall that Banky and Holden (Ben
Affleck, who reprises his role here) were comic book artists who made their
claim to fame with their "Bluntman and Chronic" comic book. In this movie, Banky
sold the rights to Miramax studios to make the movie. Jay and Silent Bob are
infuriated that they
 are not getting a piece of the collective pie so they embark on a journey to
Hollywood that includes some hot babes dressed in slinky outfits, a wild
orangutan, plenty of gay and fart jokes to make GLADD blush (which they
reportedly have), Carrie Fisher as a nun, George Carlin as a hitchhiker, clumsy
federal marshals, Internet bashing, and more in-jokes (many associated with
"Star Wars") than almost any movie I have ever seen. 
"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" has quite a few good laughs but there are also
far too many lulls. The scenario involving a federal wildlife marshal simply
marks time (including an unfunny cameo by Judd Nelson). Plus, those
slinky-outfitted babes (which includes a vivacious Shannon Hamilton) exude more
groans than smiles, aping the recent remake of "Charlie's Angels." Best bits
involve the Quik stop employees, Randal and Dante from "Clerks" (played by Jeff
Anderson and Brian O'Halloran), who call the police in to arrest the likable
drug dealers. I also liked Ben Affleck as Holden and as himself, not to mention
Matt Damon as himself, as they trade asides on each other's careers and mocking
their joint effort, "Good Will Hunting." There is also Mark Hamill as
Cock-Knocker, which has to be seen to be believed, Wes Craven making another
"Scream" sequel, and Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek as themselves portraying
Bluntman and Chronic in the movie version. You can also count on several other
cameos by other c
haracters from Smith's View Askew universe. </P>
<P>The stars of this show are Jay and Silent Bob and they are often hysterical to
watch. Jason Mewes in particular steals the show as Jay with his sexual body
language and obscene comments having to do with one particular area of the
female anatomy. Kevin Smith as Silent Bob merely makes disapproving looks and
gestures and too much of this can go a long way. Still, they make a fitting
pair, as always, and drive the movie forward with more scatalogical jokes than
one can count in this jaded day and age of sexually promiscuous teen movies. </P>
<P>"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" is fitfully funny and often clever enough for
those not easily offended by gay and fart jokes (count me in the mix). It is not
half as good as "Clerks" or as hackneyed as "Mallrats" or "Dogma," but it does
fall somewhere in between. </P>
