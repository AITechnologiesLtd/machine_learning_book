<PRE>THE MAN WHO CRIED (2001) 
Reviewed by John Sylva    </PRE>
<P>    It's almost amusing to watch 21-year old Christina Ricci get drastically 
overshadowed in Sally Potter's follow-up to 1997's The Tango Lesson, The Man 
Who Cried. The gen-Y actress, with her cold stare and big, black eyes, has 
appeared in an impressive range of films; but she doesn't even come close to 
being the bold heroine the film, set against the historical backdrop of World 
War 2, requires her to be.  Ricci, whose character is shockingly silent and 
blank, showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern, shares most of 
her scenes with the astounding Cate Blanchett: quite an amusing sight to 
behold.  Blanchett's Lola, a Paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring 
singer Suzie, is bold, interesting and layered–everything our heroine lacks. 
 Co-star of the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy, Blanchett has a good 
seven inches on Ricci, sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe. 
 The actress inhabits the role–as she always so remarkably does–with a 
fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead 
rather than her dull companion. 
     Important historical events involving Hitler and his Nazis scatter 
themselves across the film; these landmarks serve as the film's little 
conflict.  Obviously, the tables are turned in the life of Suzie by these 
events, whose Jewish origin is unknown among her Parisian colleagues. 
     The Man Who Cried has many aspirations, none of which come full circle 
by the film's close.  There are forced messages here and there: "Go forward; 
always go forward," Lola preaches to Suzie; there's romance between Suzie and 
a fellow target of Hitler's Nazis, the gypsy Cesar (Johnny Depp, who, like 
Ricci, barely gets to speak); Lola struggles with her character that desires 
above all things wealth and men who have it; and at the core of all these 
devices lies Suzie's desire to travel to America, where her father journeyed 
after leaving her and her mother years ago. 
     The film's main problem is that Potter isn't skilled enough to tell the 
epic-sized story of Suzie.  The time period's instability, the conflicting 
social classes, the prejudice against Suzie from all those around her in her 
new life: serving as both writer and director, Potter throws in some of each, 
but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any.  By the time the 
sigh-inducing climax hits, the believability and complete absence of focus 
leave one ready to leave the theater.  The film's falling action is weirdly 
unsatisfying and unlikely; are we really meant to believe any of this could 
happen? Contrastingly, in its moving final scene, The Man Who Cried strikes a 
note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the 
film. 
     Although it's apparent that Potter can't grasp what she reaches, I'm 
puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place.  Ricci's Suzie 
is meant to be the film's core: from the extended flashback at the film's 
beginning to the quickly drawn ending, everything seen in the film, in some 
way, relates to her.  So why then does Potter spend so much time on subplots 
involving other individuals?  The character of Suzie is too present for The 
Man Who Cried to work as an ensemble, but not present enough for the film to 
be Ricci's.      
     The almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which Potter 
depicts The Man Who Cried are somewhat improved upon by Sacha Vierny's 
beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations 
wonderfully.  Also worthy of note are Lindy Hemming's costumes that help to 
depict the area quite nicely.   
     And then there's the music.  From minute one to minute ninety-seven, 
there's hardly a moment when the wavering, skilled voice of an opera singer 
or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action; the notes 
stricken both overwhelm (particularly John Turturro, portraying fictional 
opera singer Dante Dominio, whose money and reputation catch Lola's interest) 
and accompany (oftentimes, the perfect chords are captured to undermine the 
state of the film's characters and reinforce that state).  Potter obviously 
cares much about each and every musical note; unfortunately, the same effort 
isn't given towards (almost) everything else. </P>
