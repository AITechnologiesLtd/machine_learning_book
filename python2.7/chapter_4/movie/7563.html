<P>     FATHERS' DAY simply has to be seen to be believed.  It's beyond my
comprehension how a motion picture with so much talent associated with
it -- actors Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, super-producer Joel
Silver, and director Ivan Reitman -- can be such a complete waste of
time.  FATHERS' DAY isn't just bad, it's awful.  Without a doubt, this
is one of 1997's most disappointing motion pictures. </P>
<P>     On the surface, the film looks like it could be good.  The comic
pairing of Robin Williams and Billy Crystal would seem to be a dream
match belonging alongside such other recent high-profile couplings as
Steve Martin and John Candy (PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES) and Martin
and Michael Caine (DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS).  In fact, Williams and
Crystal might not even need a script -- just the two of them on camera
together should be enough to garner laughs.  As it turns out, that would
have been a better approach, because the screenplay for FATHERS' DAY,
written by feel-good scribes Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel
(MULTIPLICITY, CITY SLICKERS), saps all life and humor from the leads'
performances.  The painful, predictable result is a dearth of mirth.  If
you see FATHERS' DAY and laugh more than once, consider yourself lucky.</P>
<P>     The plot, which is based on a early-'80s French film called LES
COMPERES, tells the story of one mother, one son, and three fathers.  It
seems that the mother, Collette (Nastassja Kinski), used to get around a
little back in the late-'70s and early-'80s.  Sometime in that period,
right before she married her true love (Bruce Greenwood), she slept with
both Dale (Robin Williams) and Jack (Billy Crystal).  Nine months later,
a child was born, and she didn't know which of the three men was the
biological dad.  That didn't matter until 1997, when 16-year old Scott
(an unpromising Charlie Hofheimer) decides to run away from home. 
Desperate to get him back, Collette calls up Dale and Jack, surprises
them with the news about their paternity, and implores them to look for
Scott.  And, although the two start separately, they end up together on
a chase that goes from San Francisco to Sacramento to Reno.</P>
<P>     FATHERS' DAY wants to be a hilarious, screwball comedy that doubles
as a buddy film, with a dash of family values thrown in for good
measure.  Unfortunately, these concepts got lost somewhere in the
translation (maybe Ganz and Mandel don't know French).  FATHERS' DAY is
a one-hundred minute bore without a single character worth caring about. 
Crystal and Williams generate no chemistry, and both look like they're
on hand solely to pick up a paycheck.  The feel-good moments, which are
available in embarrassing abundance, border on nauseating.  However,
perhaps the most disheartening thing about FATHERS' DAY is its complete
lack of energy -- even Williams' patented manic impressions come across
as more scripted than spontaneous. </P>
<P>     With the addition of FATHERS' DAY to his uneven resume, film maker
Ivan Reitman can now boast "the ugly" in addition to "the good" and "the
bad."  As a director, Reitman has been responsible for several
entertaining movies, including GHOSTBUSTERS and DAVE, and an even larger
number of mediocre-to-poor offerings, such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger
comedies (TWINS, KINDERGARTEN COP, JUNIOR).  But nothing he has
previously accomplished equals this travesty.  Hopefully, FATHERS' DAY
will be nothing more than an unpleasant memory by the time the third
Sunday in June rolls around.</P>
