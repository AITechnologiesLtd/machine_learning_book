<PRE>                       TO END ALL WARS
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: This is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized 
    chapter of WWII, life in a Japanese prison camp. TO END ALL 
    WARS is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to 
    retain their humanity and their dignity.  The somewhat 
    religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste.  
    Rating: 9 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>More than any other people the Japanese seem capable of acting 
with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their 
way.  This may be a holdover from the code of Bushido when loyalty 
to ones master was the only law.  During World War II, of course, 
the one goal was winning the war.  This led them to do some very 
inhuman things in pursuit of that goal.  When the Japanese had 
captured prisoners, they were very much treated in whatever way 
would be optimum for achieving the one goal.  Minimum resources 
were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal 
positive output.  While the Germans, not known for their kindness 
in those days, had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of 
war, the mortality rate of Japanese prisoners of war was 27%.  The 
best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to 
death on the Thailand to Burma railroad.  That railroad was needed 
if Japan was to attack India as it planned to do.  The best thing 
for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so 
short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day.  And 
just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll.</P>
<P>In the public mind Japan has never been held as accountable for 
war atrocities as was Germany.  Filmmakers have been reticent to 
tell the story, perhaps for fear of offending the Japanese.  There 
are comparatively few films about the Japanese POW camps.  
Certainly there was David Lean's THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI.  
There were some low-budget British exploitation films and that was 
about it.  Then there were TV series "A Town Like Alice" and 
"Tenko."  Lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film TO 
END ALL WARS directed by David Cunningham and written by Brian 
Godawa.  It is based on the account of Ernest Gordan who survived 
the horror of that World War II prison camp and went on to become 
for 26 years the Dean of the Chapel at Princeton University.  The 
film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being 
considerably more brutal and sadistic than BRIDGE ON THE RIVER 
KWAI portrayed them.</P>
<P>The story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the 
prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing 
squad.  It turns out to be a grim joke, one of many that the 
sadistic Japanese play to amuse themselves.  Beating and torture 
are commonplace events.  Men already imprisoned tell the new 
arrivals to enjoy the last of their health; it will not last long 
with parasites and disease almost inevitable.  However, unlike as 
in KWAI, the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital, called 
by the prisoners the Death House.</P>
<P>So goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain 
their humanity and with the Japanese trying to make them 
interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying 
machine.  This is more than just a battle of who will win the war 
but a battle of ideologies.  The Japanese believe that the 
individual is nothing, that conformity to group's norms is all 
that gives a life meaning.  Conformity is purpose.  Before the 
film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the 
character of the prisoners and the character of those running the 
camp.  If this story showed nothing but sadism from the Japanese 
it would be one kind of story.  If the British (with one American, 
by the way) and the Japanese learned to respect each other it 
would be another kind of story.  It is neither.  It is a stirring 
and believable account of camp life.</P>
<P>The color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out 
yellow.  This serves a double purpose for Cunningham.  It gives an 
effect of Technicolor film that has been left in heat.  It also 
creates a distancing effect.  The only touch that seems a little 
out of place is the use of Gaelic music.</P>
<P>This is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp 
experience.  I rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 
to +4 scale.</P>
