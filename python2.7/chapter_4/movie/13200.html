<PRE>WINGS OF DESIRE (1987)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Wim Wenders
Writers: Peter Handke and Wim Wenders
Starring: Bruno Ganz, Otto Sander, Solveig Dommartin, Peter Falk</P>
<P>Here's the most beautifully lyric, most poignant, and downright sensual
film you will probably ever see about the phenomenon known as angels. 
That's because this is not a glorification of what they are, it's a film
that tries to make it feel like you're one of the two angels in this film. 
It understands that they are the spirits God chose to watch over earth
because no one else could witness it.  It knows that perhaps children can
see them, but adults have lost the abitlity to.  And it knows that they try
and console those they see in desperation and sadness, but that they cannot
directly affect their lives.  To them, the world is a black and white world
that they know everything and nothing about.</P>
<P>The two angels of the film are named Damiel and Cassiel (Bruno Ganz and
Otto Sander), and they are the angels who look after Berlin, back when it
was divided by the Berlin Wall.  They have been there ever since the days
before of Hitler, have witnessed all of World War II, and have seen
everything they possibly can see.  The first hour and a half are a
slow-moving, totally hypnotic trip around Berlin as we see each of them
watching people, listening to their inner thoughts like they were stations
on the radio, and sometimes staying to see people in need of some help, to
which all they can give is a helping hand.</P>
<P>Somewhere in the beginning, Damiel wanders into a carnival, and soon falls
in love with an acrobat there, Marion (Solveig Dommartin), who is depressed
because the carnival is closing, and she will have to give up the job she
loves and take up a waitressing job.  It's easy to understand why Damiel
loves her: she has deep, sad feelings, something which the angels are not
able to really have, except for the giant yearning that Damiel soon has to
"take the plunge," as he puts it, and become human so that he can live as
the people he has been watching for so long.</P>
<P>Sound familiar?  Well, it should because it was recently remade here in
America as "City of Angels," with Nicolas Cage as the lead angel, and Meg
Ryan as the woman (a heart surgeon in the movie - get it?).  Yes, I missed
the film (on purpose), but as it looked, that was too obsessed with the
love story, which is fine, it's just not "Wings of Desire."  This film is
not one that would be as successful as "City of Angels" was.  It moves
slowly, and has no plot and really nowhere to go for most of its running
time.  It's obsessed with creating the feeling of being either Damiel and
Cassiel, not being able to see things the way humans do, and only being
able to act as a voyeur, even when they're right in front of the people
they're viewing.</P>
<P>"Wings of Desire" is one of the most delicately structured films I have
ever seen in my life.  It's filled with a heavy amount of sadness and
almost jealousy, but it's light as a feather.  There is no real feeling of
time, and it has no real place to go, just like the angels who inhabit the
movie.  At around the hour and a half spot, when Damiel becomes human, and
the black and white cinematography suddenly shifts to color to show the
world of humans (the film shifts a bit every now and then, depending on
what the perspective is), the film suddenly has somewhere to go, and the
scenes that take place are often more crucial to the "plot" than to the
overall feeling.  Suddenly, Damiel has the chance to win the heart of
Marion, and he better damn well do it!</P>
<P>There's another character in "Wings of Desire" played by American actor
Peter Falk, who's playing himself (literally) making a movie over in
Berlin.  We learn about half way through the film that he cannot really see
Damiel, but that he knows he's there, and when he suddenly begins talking
to him, Damiel is so moved that he finds he needs to become human right
away (and he does).  Although he's only in it intermittently, he's a very
crucial figure in the film for two reasons: a) he brings up the prospect
that many other angels have done what Damiel ends up doing, and b) he's an
opposite to the angels: he's the one everyone in the world wants to watch
while Damiel and Cassiel are the ones that want to be watched.</P>
<P>What's the film's overall message?  There really isn't one, which is
actually better.  Like "2001: A Space Odyssey," this is a film that doesn't
necessarily want to limit itself to one singular definition, but wants to
be philosophical while still becoming hypnotic.  So many films make the
mistake of trying to be too philosophical and forgetting that it's a film
and it needs to become an experience.  Here's a film that doesn't answer
all the questions it brings up, and doesn't even bring up all the questions
it could.  But for two hours, I guarantee that you will be glued to your
television set, and afterwards you can debate the concepts that it touches
on.</P>
