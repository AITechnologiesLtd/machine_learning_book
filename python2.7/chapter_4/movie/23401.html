<P>Disconnect the phone line. Don't accept the charges. Do anything you can
to avoid the wretched, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `Hanging Up'.</P>
<P>I figured I needed to get in touch with my feminine side, and `Hanging
Up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so. The film features an
incredible palate of female talent, and the capability behind the camera
brought to mind such sparkling gems as `Sleepless in Seattle' and
`Unsung Heroes'. Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow play a trio of
sisters who, once separated by career judgments over family ties, must
reunite when their father (Walter Matthau) is admitted into the hospital
with Alzheimer's disease. While this may read like an optimum
opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on
the past, the script by sisters Delia and Nora Ephron is exasperating,
shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery. `Hanging Up' has the
overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours, while you
don't have the option of doing as the title suggests.</P>
<P>For the first half-hour, the Ephron sisters use telephone conversations
for a basis of character development. This is an annoying and
ineffective device. Cell-phones ring every five minutes, and everyone
hurriedly rushes along, leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer
to relate to the sisters' issues and problems. If `Hanging Up' was an
apple pie, then I felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the
story. Granted, there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film.
But they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained
emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck.</P>
<P>The most outrageous strategy in `Hanging Up' is that, after a series of
largely unrealized attempts at character development, we are expected to
exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a
melodramatic finale. We are able to identify with Eve (Ryan), the most
open and caring daughter, because she is the one who stayed by her
father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending
career. Georgia (Keaton), the eldest daughter, is celebrating the fifth
year anniversary of her magazine called.... `Georgia'. Maddy (Kudrow),
the soap opera actress, spends time either contemplating her possible
path to stardom or nursing her dog. Ryan's convincing performance and
diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `Hanging
Up'. Kudrow, so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead Phoebe
in `Friends', is totally wasted. Ditto for Keaton, who is serving a
double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a
difficult priority juggle. Her frenzy is apparent.</P>
<P>For a chick flick, there is a distressing lack of chuckles. The reliable
Matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that, given his character's
situation, seems more depressing than amusing. Even so, the peak form of
humor in `Hanging Up' is represented by some of Matthau's nasty quips
and Ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a
pill. That about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel
during the film. My curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how
such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour.
But really, it's no mystery. The predictable, melodramatic filth that is
`Hanging Up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses. Pin it on
the screenplay, which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four
minutes, while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying
flurry of phone conversations. It's certainly a far cry from what one
would label as a rewarding experience, but `Hanging Up' should have at
least been enjoyable. Uh-uh. It's a wrong number from the beginning.</P>
