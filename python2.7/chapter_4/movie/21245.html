<P>The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (G) ***
Starring Mandy Patinkin, Vanessa L. Williams
Directed by Gary Halvorson
A Review by Frankie Paiva</P>
<P>Everyone in the world must be avoiding the good children’s movies. If the
failure of The Iron Giant, a terrific film about the relationship between a boy
and his pet robot wasn’t proof than the flop that Columbia Pictures
experienced with this should be proof enough. After Muppets From Space bombed,
and The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland didn’t do that well, all of us are
left to wonder what is to become of Sesame Street and the Muppets which many of
us have grown up with and still love and adore. At least this film stays true
to it’s original formula, Elmo is aimed 100% directly, on target at kids.
This isn’t to say it’s like the recent Rugrats movie, a huge success that
sickened parents, this one will actually (gasp) have the adults in the audience
having fun with their children. Plus the interaction with the audience (much
like that of the enormously popular Blues Clues) helps to form a bond between
movie and audience. This is a fun family film and I’m glad to give you this
review.</P>
<P>Elmo loves and adores his fuzzy blue blanket more than anything in the world.
He loves it so much he doesn’t want to share it with his friend Zoe, while
they are in a struggle over who gets the blanket, it gets caught by a blast of
wind and flies through the air, eventually landing in Oscar’s garbage can.
When Elmo goes to retrieve it, he and the blanket are sucked into a vortex that
magically sends them to Grouchland, a place where everything yucky and smelly
reigns supreme.</P>
<P>In Grouchland there is an evil person named Huxley (Patinkin) who steals
everything he can from all of the people who live in the area. However, no one
in Grouchland is willing to do anything about it because working together to do
anything is considered bad. Grouchland is basically the opposite of everything
they teach you on Sesame Street. When good-hearted Elmo discovers Huxley has
his blanket, he immediately goes to his dreaded castle to retrieve it. But not
without being sidetracked and chased by the evil villain’s henchmen. </P>
<P>All of the characters you know and love make an appearance hear. Even classic
cast members Bob McGrath and Sonia Manzano make an appearance. Vanessa L.
Williams does a musical number as the Queen of Trash, her song, which is all
about how beauty is everywhere, it just depends on your point of view, eerily
sums up the message of American Beauty. But it’s really Bert and Ernie that
steal the show. Everytime a major point of action occurs Ernie is there to tell
the frightened Bert (and perhaps audience) that everything is going to be OK. I
really enjoyed watching The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, even though I am
12. The makers of the film stuck with the original Street formula and didn’t
screw it up at all (even if the songs sounds a little like those of The Lion
King.) If you’re looking for a fun family film that the whole family will
like, take the kiddies to see The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, which gets
*** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film is aimed directly as young ones and has no
objectionable content. Good For All Ages</P>
