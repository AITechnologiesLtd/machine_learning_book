<PRE>Titan A.E. </PRE>
<P>It's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from Japan, because "Titan 
A.E." is proof that
Hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it. </P>
<P>I don't know what this film is supposed to be about. From what I can tell 
it's about a young man named
Kale who's one of the last survivors of Earth in the early 31st Century who 
unknowingly possesses the key
to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race. That's a fine 
premise for an action-packed sci-fi
animated movie, but there's no payoff. </P>
<P>The story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a 
legendary ship that the evil
"Dredge" aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason. So in the process we 
get a lot of spaceship fights,
fistfights, blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick 
at. There's so much pointless
sci-fi banter it's too much to take. The galaxy here is a total rip-off of 
the "Star Wars" universe the creators
don't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing, 
the characters unmotivated and
superficial and the plot just plain boring. </P>
<P>Despite the fantastic animation and special effects, it's just not an 
interesting movie. </P>
