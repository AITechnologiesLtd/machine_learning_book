                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     The way I see it, Martin Scorcese has one problem: He's in love with
the sound of his own voice, as it comes out through the dialogue of films
like GOODFELLAS and now, CASINO.  Clocking in at three *long* hours,
CASINO is an entertaining and engrossing film, but just drags a simple
story into a sprawling, epic tale that desperately needs a little
trimming.</P>
<P>     Based on a true story, CASINO is the tale of Sam Rothstein (Robert
DeNiro), the best of the old bookmakers, who is hand-picked by his mob
bosses "Back Home" to go to Las Vegas to run the Tangiers Casino.  Sam has
to contend with managing the bosses' skim going out the back door, cheats
at the tables, the law breathing down his neck, and strung-out hustler
Ginger (Sharon Stone), whom Sam falls for, and, despite his better
judgment, eventually marries.  Add to the mix Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci),
who basically reprises his role from GOODFELLAS as a "problem solver" with
a temper from hell, and it's pure chaos in the high-glamour world of 1973
Las Vegas.</P>
<P>     Scorcese directs with his characteristic style, creating a film that
is at once surreal and full of gritty realism, particularly when the
violent Nicky plies his trade.  The film ranges from glued-to-the-screen
sequences, the best of which is when Sam and his crew bust a couple of
blackjack cheats, to a number of dull scenes, mainly about Sam fighting to
get his gaming license.  If Scorcese had kept the best two hours of the
film, it would have been one of the best of the year.  As it stands now,
CASINO is still good, but just doesn't cut it as a long-term classic.</P>
<P>     I also fault Scorcese for the overuse of voice-over coupled with
rapid-fire visuals.  Especially in the opening scenes, when the characters
and setting are being introduced, it's a nonstop deluge of sensory
information--too much to process, too quickly.  But hey, who am I to tell
Martin Scorcese how to make a film?</P>
<P>     The best part of CASINO is smart acting by the three principals as
well as the supporting characters (including Don Rickles, of all people,
in a memorable role).  DeNiro evokes real sympathy for Sam, and Stone's
Ginger is the consummate Bad Girl.  You get a bad taste in your mouth just
watching her and Pesci on screen.  Also watch for a smarmy James Woods as
Ginger's old pimp.  The other saving grace is CASINO's unexpected and
frequent comic relief, which is played up beautifully to ease the film's
tension.</P>
<P>     Scorcese has improved on the flaws of GOODFELLAS, making a cozy
little epic that's worth seeing.  Just remember to bring provisions for
the experience.  You're going to be there for awhile.</P>
