<P>Like the famous musical von Trapp family, the Comedian
Harmonists were a popular vocal group who were eventually forced to
flee Germany in the 1930's to escape the tyranny of the Nazi regime.</P>
<P>In this epic story, writer/director Joseph Vilsmaier (the
visually lush but dull Brother Of Sleep, etc) traces the rise of this
vocal sextet, one of the most popular bands of the 1920's and 1930's.
This lavishly produced biopic follows the band's history, from its
humble beginnings amid the night-clubs, cafes and brothels of Berlin
to its resounding international success and its eventual break-up,
forced by Hitler's vicious anti-Semitic policies.</P>
<P>This beautifully constructed and provocative musical has vague
echoes of the classic Sound Of Music.  But it also has echoes of the
darker Cabaret, as it explores the more sinister aspects of the rise
of Nazism during the decadent 1920's and economically depressed
1930's.</P>
<P>Comedian Harmonists opens in 1927, with unemployed musician
and arranger Harry Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen) assembling the sextet,
with the help of ambitious singer Robert Biberti (Ben Becker).  The
band drew heavily on the vocal style of US bands like The Revellers,
but injected a touch of humour into their rendition of popular, bawdy
tunes.  A number of important subplots explore the changing political
climate of Germany and detail the growing internal pressures on the
band as racial and sexual tensions surface.  The Jewish Harry and
blond Aryan Robert vie for the attentions of Erna (Meret Becker), a
beautiful young student who works as an assistant in a record shop.</P>
<P>External pressure is also brought to bear on the group, as the
Nazi authorities want the band to either get rid of the three Jewish
members or perform tunes written by more acceptable writers.  The band
thought that their reputation and international fame would protect
them from the intolerant and ignorant racial policies of Hitler's
regime, but they were wrong.</P>
<P>The darker, more troubling events of the film are offset by
some beautifully arranged musical numbers, drawn from re-mastered
versions of the original recordings.  The production values and
staging are all fabulous.  Vilsmaier, who is also the cinematographer,
has an eye for detail, and visually the film is quite sumptuous and
rich.  His recreation of the decadent Berlin of the 1920's is
stunning.  The performances from the superb ensemble cast are all
perfectly pitched at the right level.  A superbly crafted and lavishly
produced film, Comedian Harmonists is an enjoyable, and ultimately
moving cinematic experience.</P>
