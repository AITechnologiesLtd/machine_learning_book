<PRE>GHOST WORLD (2001)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
Seen in August, 2001</PRE>
<P>It is rare to see a film that transports and moves me in such a way as to be
breathtaking. A film that leaves me so ecstatic and excited by cinema all over
again - a sublime experience in an era of dumbed-down, mediocre pictures. For
the 1980's, "The Breakfast Club" was the ultimate statement about teenagers in
high school. For the 1990's teen way of life, perhaps something like "American
Beauty" stands as definitive about how teenagers think and talk nowadays (unless
you prefer "American Pie"). But a defining statement of the world today is
clearly felt in "Ghost World," an unparalleled masterpiece of pop culture
attitudes and more specifically, teenage alienation and discomfort in an era of
Internet hype and media hogwash. I was planning on seeing Kevin Smith's latest
the following day but I just couldn't. After seeing "Ghost World," you may not
want to see anything else for a few days since it gets under your skin so
thoroughly that you will feel compelled to buy the graphic novel from which the
film is b
ased on or listen to the soundtrack or both. It is that good. 
Based on the comic book by Daniel Clownes, "Ghost World" is a bleak view of
America today in an suburban town where 50's retro diners coexist with
politically correct art teachers. It is also a world of lonely, miserable people
who can't help being where they are in their station in life. Enid (Thora Birch)
is the offbeat, downbeat, ironic, contradictory, sarcastic teenager who has just
graduated from high school. Her best friend, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), has
also graduated and is relieved. Their relief does not translate to collegiate
futures - they have their own plans. Enid and Rebecca plan to work full-time
jobs and rent an apartment and basically make ironic statements on people who
surround their field of vision. Enid not only spouts ironic commentary, she
lives by it. She hates any and everything except for her friend Rebecca. She
sees a bald man and his wife at a cafe and immediately suspects they are
Satanists. Both Enid and Rebecca decide to spend their time gazing and talking.
One day, Enid r
esponds to a personal ad where some guy had seen a blonde and felt they shared
something special. Enid pretends to be the blonde and calls for a date. The guy,
Seymour (Steve Buscemi), comes to one of those 50's retro diners to meet the
blonde, who is of course not present. But something curious happens - Enid
follows Seymour around and begins to like the fact that he is representative of
everything she doesn't hate. He is a dork in her estimation but he also loves to
collect 78 rpm records of old blues singers. More importantly, Enid can relate
to Seymour's loneliness. </P>
<P>Enid's home life is not pretty. Her father (Bob Balaban) eats jelly with relish
and dates a woman she hates. He does try to support his daughter but she is
unresponsive and selfish. Enid lives in her own fantasy world of irony and of
dancing to Indian music - she does not see that she alienates people by hiding
or being cleverly ironic. After alienating even Rebecca and Seymour, Enid feels
lost - a lost soul in search of her inner self. "I don't know what I am doing,"
says Enid at one point and that statement sums up her life. If Enid hates any
and everything and can't commit to a job, then where is her station in life? Can
it be with the summer art class where she has to contend with a politically
correct art teacher? Can it be the old man who waits for a bus that never comes?
Who can Enid relate to now if she can't hold on to her own friends?</P>
<P>"Ghost World" is not likely to appeal to the same teenagers who love "American
Pie" and its score of imitations. After all, Enid's preoccupation in life is not
sex - she would like to belong to something but she is too honest in this media
age to belong to anything she doesn't already despise. The same is true of
Seymour who is offended by shouting radio deejays and modern blues songs. He may
feel that times are better but he is still rooted in the past, particularly with
offensive minstrel ads and old blues songs. But he is a loner too and despises
society yet works for a corporation to support himself and his collection of
78's. </P>
<P>Thora Birch encapsulates the modern alienated and alienating teenager perfectly
in Enid. She is a wonder to watch as she unfurls her commentary on screen with
winking nuances and explosive fierceness, always wearing horn-rimmed glasses.
Look at the scene in a zine shop where she dresses up in original punk rock
clothes, combat boots and green hair and claims her fashion statement as irony -
none of the clerks in the store see it that way. Birch screams, crackles,
hollers, whispers, laughs and cries, and she is sarcastic not to mention
touching in her weaker states where she starts to lose what she had. It is a
brave, risky performance by Birch that embellishes the promise she showed in
"American Beauty."  </P>
<P>Also noteworth is Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca, also ironic in her own way but
also looking ahead in the future - she does not wish to stay in the same town
forever. Her dry, low monotone voice is in direct contrast to Birch's
occasionally high-pitched delivery. Johansson first came to prominence in the
sweet film "Manny and Lo" and here, she is maturing into a fine actress. </P>
<P>Finally, there is Steve Buscemi in one of his best roles as the lonesome
Seymour. He connects with Enid but also wants to move on in his own station in
life. The tragedy of his character is that he can't despite trying to. Buscemi
is as restrained as ever and gives measured poignance to Seymour's downfall. </P>
<P>"Ghost World" is directed by Terry Zwigoff, who helmed the fabulous, disturbing
documentary "Crumb" a few years go (there's even a nod to Crumb's rock band).
This is Zwigoff's first non-documentary film and it is a great, poetic
masterwork - his restraint and static camera style are perfect for the
observations of this ghostly world as seen through Enid's eyes. And the
ambiguous ending will haunt you for days as to where Enid's future lies. It is
as moving and poetic as any film you will see this year. </P>
