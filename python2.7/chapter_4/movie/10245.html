<P>   There was a time that college kids going to Europe said to
their stay-at-home buddies, "Eat your heart out, pal."  Things
are quite different now, as Anthony Waller would have us
believe in his role at the helm of "An American Werewolf in
Paris."  Now the slogan might be the very reverse: "So you're
going to Paris?  Eat your heart out."  Waller's campy horror
comedy-thriller, which he wrote together with Tim Burns and
Tom Stern and which is based on characters created by John
Landis in Landis's messy 1981 opus, "An American Werewolf
in London," comes off best during its initial half hour.  After
the fun dialogue, shenanigans and fantasies which three
young Yanks share with us as they tour the City of Lights, the
movie simply degenerates.  In doing so Waller falls into
the lapse suffered recently by scripter Quentin Tarantino in
the Robert Rodriguez film "From Dusk Till Dawn."  That
tamale Western gives us a first act brimming with tough talk
and violent action, magnetic in its story and pacing, and
favored with a charismatic villain played by George Clooney. 
"From Dusk Till Dawn" then retrogresses into a by-the-
numbers vampire gross-out, shedding all pretense of
character development, action with at least internal logic, and
people the audience could sympathize with.</P>
<P>   After a blood-and-thunder prelude which takes us promptly
to a central Parisian boulevard on a dark and stormy night,
Waller's film settles into a pleasantly humorous banter of its
three principal, fun-loving males: Andy (Tom Everett Scott),
Brad (Vince Vieluf) and Chris (Phil Buckman).  Traveling
together on a train across the French countryside they
challenge one another in a game of one-upmanship on their
sexual experiences, each offering to grant "points" to the
other two for each success they have in "boinking" the
sophisticated Parisian coeds they might meet.  In the story's
most flat-out hilarious scene, Andy sits in a cafe with a young
French woman he has met, Serafine (Julie Delpy) under the
most unusual circumstances, trying to convince her that he
respects and likes her as a person and not simply as a
potential bed mate.  When a half dozen condoms spill out of
his pocket--courtesy of his pals' donation to him just before
the date--he pretends that they are merely the latest type of
American chewing gum.  We in the audience remain a step or
two ahead of the performers as soon as Serafine warns Andy
that he must give her up immediately for his own safety: "It's
not you, it's me, " she insists, and in this case she can be
taken at her word.</P>
<P>   It is currently fashionable to say that the wolf is one of the
world's most beautiful creations.  Those who remain skeptical
will join the trendies when they watch Ms Delpy--a lovely
actress who charmed us so much in the French-language
movie "White"--transform into a such a creature under the full
moon.  It's not long before Waller--recapping "From Dusk Till
Dawn" but simply replacing vampires with lupine curiosities--
throws before us an epidemic of morphing.  Waller does not
even trust the patience of his audience to become wrapped
up in teasingly slow metamorphoses of human beings to
bizarre animals with incredible strength and a curious love for
human blood. Wouldn't you expect him at least to show the
hair slowly sprouting on hands which simultaneously
exchange manicured nails for well-honed claws?  No way. 
They simply convert one-two-three and they're off and
running.   We meet folks who are dead-dead, like Serafine's
stepfather; others who are undead, like Amy the bimbo; and
the Lupus Vulgaris types who are alive but are human beings
only part-time.  At least in Landis's 1981 London version, the
David Naughton character turns into a  werewolf with real
style: hands elongating and growing claws, face twisting into a
snout and fangs.</P>
<P>   Still, Tom Everett Scott makes a charming Andy with a
modicum of chemistry for the lovely Julie Delpy, two
characters who literally fall for each other not once but twice:
over the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty in a decently-
executed pair of bungee jumps.  Perhaps to add at least a bit
of class to the film, the writers throw in--but are too
embarrassed to elaborate--a political scenario: the
werewolves who are members of an exclusive club guarded
over by Mr. Clean are really skinheads during the day who
believe they are purifying the planet by getting rid of the sick,
the dependent, the halt and the lame.  "Werewolf" is
ultimately a heartless exercise in more ways than one.
Rated R.  Running Time: 100 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey
