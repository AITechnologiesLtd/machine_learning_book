<P>     PARADISE ROAD gets my vote for Most Boring Movie of the Year.  A
bunch of stately actresses play a bunch of stately prisoners of war,
interred by the Japanese during World War II, and who form a "vocal
orchestra" as a way to wail in harmony.  The story is true and the
actresses are appealing and neither of these is a reason to recommend
this exceptionally uninteresting movie.  Oh, sure, a *few* things
happen:  one woman is doused with gasoline and set on fire.  A catfight
erupts over soap in the shower.  And Francis McDormand speaks in a campy
German accent.  (Well, at least that's one less role to cast for a big-
screen update of "Hogan's Heroes.")  With the exception of a-cappella
renditions of Dvorak and Ravel, there isn't a thing here that we haven't
seen before.  I kept praying for the film to break.</P>
