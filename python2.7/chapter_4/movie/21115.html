The Story of Us</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"The Story of Us" could be described as a sequel to "When Harry met Sally,"
you know, like fifteen years later and with a heavier drama to comedy ratio.
There's a lot of the same back and forth talk about the nature of men and
women and relationships that's probably been going on for centuries with
very little universal resolution. However, instead of single people
chattering about this, we now have two very married folks with very real
kids. The weight of their history is far too heavy to support a Harry/Sally
lightness.</P>
<P>About midway through, Bruce and Michelle head off on a Venetian vacation in
hopes of "jump-starting" their waning marriage. This is were they meet the
movie's comic relief: a hilariously annoying couple from the States. But the
bickering stalemate demands further relief, so Paul Reiser and the director
himself (Rob Reiner) make comedic appearances. Though these two are amusing,
you'll still have to wade through more than a few yelling spats from the
leads.</P>
<P>I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy arguments at temper's edge. In
fact, when neighbors raise their voices to each other, my usual reaction is
to take a walk. Though this film's arguments are very well acted and
probably ring dissonantly true for many married (or divorced) movie-goers --
I just wanted to take a walk during those parts. That said, the highlight of
the film is a Willis monologue that brilliantly combines humor, sarcasm and
heartfelt soul-searching. Pfeiffer has a similar, yet less effective
monologue (near-missing the mark despite her fine efforts).</P>
<P>As for a plot ... Bruce and Michelle start the movie in marital discord
hobbling towards separation. To keep your attention, the filmmakers rely
entirely on strong performances, topical chit-chat and basic suspense ...
will they break up or realize that they're perfect for each other?</P>
