Punchline (1988)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 56</PRE>
<P>"Punchline" is a drama about stand-up comics.   They want
to become stars, but their dreams are often reduced to making 
it through the next gig.</P>
<P>Lilah (Sally Fields) is housewife by day, stand-up comic
by night.  The movie opens with her buying jokes, as covertly
as if buying drugs.</P>
<P>She performs at a nightclub as part of a lineup of comics.
(Look for Damon Wayans as one of the troop.)
Fields is not a very good comic.  Her jokes aren't funny,
she's nervous, and can't handle hecklers.  She also faces
problems at the home front.  Her husband (John Goodman)
doesn't support her new career, and her three young daughters
are a handful.</P>
<P>Another comic who performs at the club is Steven (Tom Hanks)
a medical student who flunks college when he can't remember
the word for rectum during an oral exam.  Tom is an
excellent comic and has a bright future, but has yet to
break the news to his father who wants him to be an open-heart
surgeon like himself.</P>
<P>Fields begins to follow Hanks around, pestering him to learn
why he is so much better as a comic than she.  When he learns
she is broke, he at first disdains her, then for some reason
decides to help her.  Under his guidance, she is transformed
into a funny comedian.  This story line is hard to swallow:
Fields is more believable as a flying nun than a hilarious comic.</P>
<P>Goodman wants his wife to entertain business clients,
who are church pastors, to demonstrate his family values.
Pressed for time after hanging with Hanks, Fields must dress up 
and cook a fancy dinner.  The dinner goes well until one
of the bratty daughters tells a dirty joke.</P>
<P>Hanks learns that a network talent scout is considering
putting him on television, a chance at the big time.
He tries to hide this from the other comics to no avail.
One night, he is told that a network bigwig is in the audience,
but the man in the suit turns out to be his father.
Hanks has a nervous breakdown on stage, blabbering about
his relationship with his dad and how fellow med students
taunted him for squeamishness.</P>
<P>Hanks later hits on Fields, another unlikely story line.
She rejects him.  His reaction is to do an imitation of
Gene Kelly in "Singin' In The Rain" while Fields gapes at
him.</P>
<P>The talent scout tells Hanks that there is to be an audition
between the comics with the winner going on Carson.  Fields
has them rolling in the aisles.  Everyone knows that Hanks
is the better comic, but he is self-destructive, mocking the
judges and bigwigs.  He recovers, and by the end of his
routine everyone is laughing.  Fields wins the contest
due to Hanks bad politics.  But she refuses the prize in
order to return to her loving family.  Hanks is then the winner.</P>
<P>The moral is that everyone has a place in life that must be
accepted.  Fields is a housewife not a comic, Hanks a comic not
a doctor.</P>
