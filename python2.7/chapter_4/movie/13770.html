<P>Australian theatrical release date: August 13, 1998</P>
<PRE>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</PRE>
<P>Somewhere in the backbone of the American film industry lies some deep,
dark and cynical social studies of sensitive and standoffish themes.
The fact that the independent production In the Company of Men has
probably been the only one of these nitty-gritty films in the last year
proves that these atypical themes are definitely not typical material to
encounter.  Although any Hollywood hack can conjurer up offensive and/or
execrating films (see Dumb and Dumber and the upcoming There's Something
About Mary, if you don't believe me), there's something special that
separates antagonistic flair from goofball comedy.  Damn Neil LaBute
(director of In the Company of Men) for doing it so well, and damn Don
Ross for failing to achieve true cinematic quality in The Opposite of
Sex.</P>
<P>16 year old Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci) warns us early on in the
film: "I don't have a heart of gold, and I don't grow one later on."
After the death of her stepfather she runs away from her troubled life
in Louisiana, and visits her gay half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan).
Whilst there she seduces his boyfriend Matt (Ivan Sergei) and proclaims
that she is pregnant, and that Matt is the father.  When the two flee
the city, the film gets some breathing space to develop a few other
characters.  We find Bill to be a wise and considerate man, as well as
being introduced to his bratty best friend Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), the town
sheriff (Lyle Lovett) and one of Matt's previous lovers (Johnny
Galecki).  It's a pity that none of them, except Ricci's exuberant
Dedee, are particularly interesting.</P>
<P>One of the most striking elements of Don Ross' directing style in this
film is its narration.  Last years Gattaca was ample proof of how
effective narration from a main character can be, often adding multiple
dimensions to a film.  But it can also be a slack way of putting the
pieces together - it's much more difficult to visually depict key scenes
than it is to simply describe them, and I couldn't help but feel that
Ross had taken the easy way out on numerous occasions.</P>
<P>However, one great thing about The Opposite of Sex is the uneasy
relationship that develops between the viewer and the character of
Dedee.  We don't really care for her because she is so nasty, but at the
same time we want nothing bad to happen to her, as she is so valuable to
the film.</P>
<P>Don't ask me how Christina Ricci went from The Addams Family and Casper
to The Ice Storm and The Opposite of Sex, but she has transformed
herself into a robust young actress with remarkable talent and ability.
Ricci is terrific in her role, and would certainly contend as one of the
best female leads so far this year had she been given more screen time.
Ivan Sergei has also come along way since his rather dismal performance
in John Woo's Once a Thief, but he is a often unconvincing at times.
Lisa Kudrow is the first out of the Friends bunch to prove that she can
act well, but Ross seems uncertain as to whether her character is a
comedy relief or a dramatic influence.</P>
<P>As a nitty-gritty "we offend you and we're proud of it" film, The
Opposite of Sex succeeds only mildly well.  It's not as controversial or
vitalizing as it intends to be, as many scenes are comprised of sloppy
film making rather than a competent portrayal of important social
themes.  It may not be typical material to encounter and it may be
produced from the shadows of an alive industry, but this film fails to
give the kind of adequate emotional feel and kooky black comedy that its
material desperately deserves.</P>
