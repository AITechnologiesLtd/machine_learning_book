<PRE>RAVENOUS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Ah, what could be better than the return of the good ol' fashioned
cannibal movie?  Well, judging from Ravenous, quite a bit, actually.
Though it nearly hits its stride as a black comedy, the film never quite
finds its rhythm, and falters when it turns into a hybrid monster movie.</P>
<P>The film follows a war hero of the Mexican-American  war, John Boyd (Guy
Pearce).  An accidental hero, Boyd's true cowardice is suspected by his
superior (John Spencer). And, though promoted to Captain, Boyd is sent
to a remote outpost in the California wilderness</P>
<P>The soldiers at the fort are eccentric and unusual (played by Jeffrey
Jones, David Arquette, Jeremy Davies and Neal McDonough among others).
But things take a turn for the bizarre when a stranger (Robert Carlyle)
arrives at the fort with a dreadful tale of a settler expedition that
turned to cannibalism during the harsh winter.</P>
<P>The soldiers mount a rescue party to see if they can locate any
survivors.  However, Boyd learns of a peculiar Native American legend.
A man who eats the flesh of another becomes a wendigo,  a vampire of
sorts, who grows in strength, and appetite, with each mouthful of human
flesh.  Could this monstrous legend be true, and, if so, how can the
soldiers hope to stop the beast?</P>
<P>Ravenous falls somewhere between being an out-and-out monster movie, and
a very dark comedy, and it probably would have fared better as one or
the other.  As implemented in the film, the comic tone works better.  In
fact, when the film strays into the supernatural, things seem out of
place, and don't quite click.</P>
<P>Robert Carlyle is a perfect fit for this film.  His wiry, menacing
presence has always been a bit on the feral side. However, Guy Pearce is
a weak link in this film.  Whereas his quiet fortitude worked wonders in
L.A. Confidential, it never seems at home here.</P>
<P>>From its unusual scoring, to its casting, it is apparent that Ravenous
is trying to be quirky.  Sometimes it works (with a great performance by
Jeffrey Jones), but mostly it doesn't (as with the overly distracting
nature of the score).  The search for the perfect cannibal movie
continues...</P>
