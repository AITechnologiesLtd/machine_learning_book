<P>   The New Vulgarity is here to stay, or at least until Cameron
Diaz decides to wash that man right out of her hair.  With
"BASEketball" coming up on screens just one week after
"Mafia," the studios are catering to movie demographics just
as sure as Italians are catering cappellini.   Danny Boyle, who
directed the Scottish "Trainspotting," has nothing on Jim
Abrahams, famous for such spoofs as "Airplane" when it
comes to scenes of retching and bathroom humor. 
Abrahams's send-up of organized crime is on the money
more times than not.  "Mafia!" will be appreciated by less
inhibited adults as surely as it will be a big hit with the
younger fry.  Featuring sight gags, verbal repartee, and
references to past films that aficionadoes will be delighted to
catch, "Mafia!" will keep the fans laughing and groaning in
equal portions with its pratfalls and parodies alike.  It also
features a career-reinforcing vehicle for its star, Jay Mohr,
whose background as a standup comic serves him well.</P>
<P>  Switching back and forth in time, the movie gets started
early on by pointing out the one-sided nature of Las Vegas: 
the house never loses.  Considering the odds against winning
(about zero chances in a hundred), it's to the credit of the
Peppermill Hotel Casino in Reno that its managers allowed
the crew to film the gruesome sequences.  Anthony Cortino
(Jay Mohr), the son of godfather Vincenzo (Lloyd Bridges),
overlooks the action as his employees rake the money in by
the cartload, a new sight gag appearing every seven seconds
or so. One of the games allows gamblers to guess the
number which the dealer is thinking about.  "Two," says one
hopeful. "No, I'm thinking of three, I'm sorry," replies the
croupier as he shovel yet another pile of bills into the box. 
Another game highlights the sign "You can't possibly win," as
customers simply put their bills on the table while the house
promptly shovels them into the chest.  There's only one way
to limit your losses, and that's simply to mail the money to the
casino.  "The smart ones just send us the money and save on
the plane fare," the house reports as it blithely opens
envelopes and stashes the loot.</P>
<P>   One of the charming benefits of this movie is that it
introduces the young people in the audience to subtitles. 
Who knows what Antonionis and Bergmanns and Fellinis will
soon be seen by this crowd of sophomores?  When Pierre
Letarte's camera pans to the Sicilian town of Salmonella in
the early years of the century, we see godfather-to-be
Vincenzo Cortino (Jason Fuchs) delivering packs of cocaine
to mobsters against a background of posters such as one that
says, "Got vino?"  (You have to be fast to catch these gags:
Abrahams does not linger over much.)  Yet another poster
warns of "guard sheep," and as Vincenzo escapes from the
island one step ahead of a man determined to kill him, he
takes the boat "Il Pacino" all the way to Ellis Island, brushing
up on the handbook "English with an Italian accent."</P>
<P>   Think fast and you'll see visual references to movies like
"The Godfather," "Casino," Jaws," "Forrest Gump" and even
"The English Patient," (the last one a scene that has the
entire Cortino family including its horse throwing up). 
Christina Applegate, the nymphet from the TV series
"Married..with Children," has blossomed from a ribald
adolescent into a charming lady of southern charm as she
goes through the motions of a WASP girl friend of Joey trying
to fit into a family of Sicilian-Americans.  "Oh, Italian food,"
she murmurs with suprise as she prepares to sit down with
the gangsters and, when shocked that the shot-up Vincenzo's
bed-ridden form lies unattended by doctors and nurses,
Anthony explains, "Diane, Dad belongs to an HMO." </P>
<P>   If you have a taste for this type of ribaldly--and every red-
blooded American should--you'll enjoy the fun, which at
eighty-six minutes does not go on for one unnecessary
moment.  "We used to kill and dismember people; now it's all
drugs...where's the honor?" laments the godfather.  As the
chief honcho, the late Lloyd Bridges furnishes an honorable
end to his long career with this, his last film.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 86 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
