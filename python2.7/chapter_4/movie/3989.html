<P>     Possibly the best craftsman of Berlin-based, post-WWII thrillers
is novelist Len Deighton (THE IPCRESS FILE, BERLIN GAME, SPY HOOK),
whose meticulously-researched, taught page-turners keep readers
consistently interested and involved.  Perhaps the makers of THE
INNOCENT should have consulted Deighton before embarking on this
project--a wandering, occasionally-obtuse, and often boring tale of
passion, murder, and political maneuvering set in Berlin during the
mid-50s.</P>
<P>     The story revolves around British telecommunications engineer
Leonard Markham (Campbell Scott), who is "on loan" to the Americans
during his stay in occupied Germany.  His immediate superior is an
arrogant, regimented officer by the name of Bob Glass (Anthony
Hopkins), who quotes regulations and warns against security
infractions.  Leonard's job in Berlin is to tap into Russian telephone
lines and feed the coded messages to the decoders for interpretation.
It's all top-secret, so when Leonard becomes involved with Maria
(Isabella Rossellini), an "ordinary" German citizen, Glass' suspicions
are aroused.  After all, just about everyone in Berlin is spying for
someone, and Maria's estranged husband (Ronald Nitschke) has some
dubious contacts.</P>
<P>     For a film that's on-screen for two hours, THE INNOCENT takes a
lot of time going virtually nowhere.  All the spying and counterspying
is presented in the most uninteresting manner possible, the central
love story between Leonard and Maria never ignites any sparks, and the
murder comes across as a plot contrivance.  Although the setting is
perfect for delicious intrigue, the cliched script reduces everything
to a remarkably banal level.</P>
<P>     The members of a first-rate cast give less than top-notch
performances.  Anthony Hopkins, playing a stereotypical American,
occasionally goes over-the-top with both acting and accent.  Isabella
Rossellini (who, during a CASABLANCA-like entrance, bears an uncanny
resemblance to her mother, Ingrid Bergman) does a workmanlike job, and
her romance with Campbell Scott couldn't be less convincing.  These two
absolutely don't belong together.  It's like Ilsa and Victor Laszlo all
over again, except this time there's no Rick.</P>
<P>     What's most disappointing about THE INNOCENT is how little it
manages to do with such a promising cast and premise.  Problems start
with the erratic, poorly-paced script (which probably could have used
tightening up in another draft), but they don't stop there.  By the
time THE INNOCENT gets around to contrasting the freedom of today's
post-wall Berlin with what things were once like, the impact is
severely diluted.  And the tearful reunion which marks the film's
denouement means very little because we never really care for the
characters involved.  In fact, all things considered, there's not much
in this picture worth caring about.</P>
