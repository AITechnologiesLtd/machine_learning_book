<P>Robert Altman's latest begins with the free-floating point of view sometimes 
employed by the novelist Sinclair Lewis.  We first see a black man inside a 
dark bar, Theo's Place.  He's drinking heavily, and when he leaves he spots 
a cruiser passing in the street.  The drunken Willis Richland (Charles S. 
Dutton) drops his pint of Wild Turkey, returns to the bar and steals 
another.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, across the town of Holly Springs, Mississippi, we are shown a 
rehearsal of an Easter pageant, Camilla Dixon's (Glenn Close) version of 
Oscar Wilde's 'Salome'.  Camilla is bossing around the players, including 
her sheepish and slow-witted sister Cora (Julianne Moore) and a young 
sheriff's deputy, Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell).</P>
<P>Thus Altman establishes the arena in which his story unfolds.  He adds 
dashes of other characters to the recipe, and somehow manages quite a 
successful result:  a small movie with a large cast, an art film that is in 
no way snooty or snotty, the kind of picture that stars worth their salt 
give up scads of cash to be in.</P>
<P>These threads of plot keep crossing as the narrative gets passed among the 
many eccentric and convincing characters.  Willis appears to be breaking 
into a house through a kitchen window.  He stumbles upon a cabinet and 
begins to remove several handguns, just as an old woman descends the steps 
and surprises him.  We discover they are friends, and the woman (Patricia 
Neal) - the Cookie of the title, Jewel Mae "Cookie" Orcutt, beloved widow of 
Buck Orcutt - treats this man like a son.  The two keep a running count of 
wrongs they've done each other, and Cookie has been wronged more often:  
it's a playful and endearing piece of characterization.</P>
<P>We find out that Cookie's relatives have abandoned her.  Nieces Camilla and 
Cora are not on good terms with her (rather, Camilla is not, and Cora 
blindly follows any direction coming from Camilla).  Niece Emma Duvall 
(apparently Cora's daughter, played by Liv Tyler) has just returned to town 
from a life of alleged decadence.  She hasn't had the chance to see Great 
Aunt  Cookie before the old woman, in a state aggravated by loneliness, 
senility, and some heavenly descriptions she got from Willis, uses one of 
Buck's old pistols to blow out her brains.  What keeps our interest is the 
filmmaker's handling of the body's discovery.  Again the camera seems to be 
floating:  Altman is wisely unafraid to sustain a shot when very little is 
happening.  Hence we see Camilla searching the house in real time, and we 
are treated to a masterful scene when she finds the body in bed, a ruined 
feather pillow covering the head, pistol dangling from a dead finger.  
Thinking quickly, Camilla reveals her true colors:  she begins to gather any 
traces of Cookie's crime against the family name; knocking over jewelry 
boxes to simulate a robbery; stuffing the suicide note, which is addressed 
to Willis, into her mouth, to hide it from the approaching Cora;  finally 
lifting the pistol out of the peaceful grip of Cookie's hand.  In short, 
Camilla flagrantly violates the crime scene.</P>
<P>Needless to say, Camilla's actions hold serious repercussions for most of 
the characters.  What is very impressive is Altman's sense of humor - a 
refined dark comedy that also functions as social satire.  This director is 
experienced in manipulating the large cast, as he did in 'Mash', 
'Nashville', 'Short Cuts' and others.  We watch brilliant spurts of 
characterization followed by astounding revelations about human nature.  
Viewers can tell Altman is always on task, whether it's coaxing crazy 
expressions out of the actors, timing the implications of a lingering shot, 
or even including a couple of visual jokes other directors would shun (such 
as Close's Camilla getting caught with her hand in Cookie's cookie jar!).</P>
<P>The acting is thoroughly solid in this piece.  Close shows her mastery of 
megalomania:  she plays Camilla as an aging Southern belle more concerned 
with appearances than with family relations.  Sister Cora, who sleeps in the 
same room with Camilla, and kneels dutifully during Camilla's self-righteous 
prayers, is a classic example of a dominated adult.  Sometimes Moore's 
expressions are hilarious in their simple-mindedness, as when she sucks in 
her lips, as though they are zipped, when one of the cops comments about the 
terrible scene in the bedroom upstairs.  Moore has worked with Altman 
before, in 'Short Cuts', the adaptation of Raymond Carver's superb short 
stories, and she shows a marvelous range here.  Cora is so plain she's 
almost unattractive, and some of the most funny and subtle moments are given 
to her, as when she incorporates Biblical-sounding poetry from 'Salome' in 
her everyday speech.  Just as good is Patricia Neal, the title character, as 
she shows her attachment to Willis, and especially to her dead husband Buck. 
  Finally, Charles S. Dutton seems to be the main character - he links the 
other characters with strands of plot that many times display their foibles 
and his virtue (as when he buys a pint of bourbon and returns it to the 
shelf in Theo's bar).</P>
<P>Supporting roles are jewels as well.  Chris O'Donnell as Jason Brown is a 
green but over-confident deputy, and receives with telling ignorance the 
condescension of Camilla and his superior officers.  Jason is in lust with 
Emma, played with low-key loyalty by Liv Tyler.  Ned Beatty plays Lester 
Boyle, another deputy, who is not afraid to point out the incompetence of 
senior investigators on the case of Cookie's death.  I don't know if Beatty 
has the most acting credits among the cast members, but he's certainly one 
of the more natural-acting veterans Altman has ever found.  In a smallish 
role, Lyle Lovett's Manny Hood is quietly obsessed with Emma, employing her 
in his catfish business and refurbishing a caboose in which he is hoping she 
will live.</P>
<P>My sole complaint is the convolutions that come in late.  Yes, some of them 
are crucial and well-explained, but others seem like they're included out of 
respect for the novel from which Anne Rapp developed her screenplay.  A few 
details are crammed in and possibly expendable.</P>
<P>Another of Altman's recent films, 'Gingerbread Man', is set in the South, 
and 'Cookie's Fortune' furthers the director's exploration of things 
American and gothic.  There are wonderful depictions here of manses and 
gardens, gentility and jealousy.  It would take me awhile to come up with a 
director comparable to Altman;  if he were purely a writer he would be 
called literary, sprawling but coherent, sarcastic but touching.  At last, 
he's an original, big-name independent whose small masterworks should be 
included in any canon</P>
