<P>Of the films starting with the word "get" the three most interesting 
have been the British "Get Carter" (1971), a tough action item with 
Michael Caine;  "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs" (1978) the irreverent 
French movie with Gerard  Depardieu; and "Get Shorty" (1995), the 
humorous, hoodlum story from Elmore Leonard, with John Travolta.</P>
<P>The ""get" in Get Bruce, unlike the other titles, refers to the 
hirings of real-life Bruce Vilanch by practitioners of film, TV and 
other events, that is, "celebrities" --which is one of the most 
irritating and overworked words in American pop culture.</P>
<P>A small,  improvised poll turns out this fact: almost no one among 
ordinary folks has any idea who Bruce Vilanch is. But (a very big 
but) everyone in showbiz knows that this Bruce is a joke and gag 
writer who is in huge demand among actors, stand-up comics, sit-down 
comics, leaders or organizers of such public events as roasts, 
homages, the Academy Awards ceremonies and so on ad infinitum.</P>
<P>Which explains why this light-hearted documentary is studded with 
laugh-getting stars, clients, collaborators, admirers and --in the 
best showbiz tradition --"best friends" of Bruce's. Look at the 
credits above and you get merely a whiff of Vilanchites.</P>
<P>The voluminous, hirsute Bruce, ever-looking unkempt, ever wearing one 
of his funny t-shirts from his colossal collection, is a very funny 
fellow. In interviews which, like good jokes, never overstay their 
welcome, in amusing conversations, discussions, appearances and the 
like, in cinema-verite scenes, one learns a great deal not only about 
Vilanch but also about several of his performer-friends. There are 
tidbits that inform you about those persons, as well as Bruce, and 
that make them all  more understandable. They also reveal the 
mechanisms behind the funny stuff.</P>
<P>In a few cases this gets a bit tiresome, notably when Robin Williams 
keeps appearing and being funny, or so he thinks. But by and large -- 
as in the case of the parceled out interview of Bruce's vivacious, 
scene-stealing adoptive Jewish mother --there is lively light shed on 
the speaker as well as on Vilanch. Or take the sessions in which 
frequent Oscar-host Billy Crystal sits down with Bruce and both get 
into the technicalities of what was done, changed or eliminated in 
the Motion Picture Academy's annual event -- which is discussed as 
the "nec plus ultra", as something like the Olympic Games of live 
appearances.</P>
<P>Vilanch does not merely provide jokes. He tailor-makes, very 
cleverly, to the style and the personality of personalities, so that 
we, the public, easily believe that the one-liners and others 
originate with the performers. In addition, Vilanch also coaches the 
performers with precision, skill and a vast knowledge of what works 
and what does not, from gestures to looks, from hair to toes, from 
dressing to walking, and much more.</P>
<P>In addition to the above addition, Bruce himself is a first-rate 
performer. We see him doing his shticks more than once in this 
not-flagging, fast-paced, even frantic assemblage of scenes and 
sequences. The man is a joke factory, which, if listed on the stock 
market, would keep paying high dividends to shareholders.</P>
<P>Vilanch, a gay man, has done a great deal of good work for the cause 
of Gay Liberation and AIDS.
Just about the only non-comic moment in this documentary is when he 
becomes lachrymose during an AIDS benefit.</P>
<P>Among the miscellaneous revelations in the documentary is that Bruce 
originated the famous appearance of then Whoopi's paramour Ted 
Danson, in an affair where Danson was in blackface. This created a 
controversy. My position is that the event was in bad taste, but what 
really shocked me was to hear Whoopi say that something  or other was 
"about Ted and I." So much for the literacy and grammar of 
"celebrities."</P>
<P>"Get Bruce" is a most entertaining ninety minutes . You laugh a lot 
and learn a lot. But do bear in mind that this work is neither about 
humor (both in its narrow and wide definitions) nor about wit. Oscar 
Wilde or even Noel Coward are light-years away. Gags, jokes  and 
ephemeral one-liners are its mainstay and reign supreme.</P>
