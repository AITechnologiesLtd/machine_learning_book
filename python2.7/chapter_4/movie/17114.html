<P>The plot of this film was apparently "suggested by" the French novel, Les
Liaisons Dangereuses, but unlike its three previous cinematic predecessors,
this one decides to stick some beautiful young men and women into its
presentation, with plenty of degrading and reprehensible behavior to go
around. Sexual innuendoes and actual teen promiscuity abound in this film
that takes all of the best elements from the latest teen flick craze, and
mixes in some good ol' fashioned back-stabbing, incest and of course, love.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Rich spoiled stepsister bets rich spoiled stepbrother that he will not be
able to seduce an angelic, self-proclaimed "virgin till she falls in love"
peach from Kansas. With manipulation methods in full-gear, our boy takes on
the task, knowing full well that a victory will prize him a shot at his
stepsister's own honey. A miss however, will mean the relinquishing of his
favorite car to said sibling.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I hate to say it but I actually had a fun time at this movie. It was never
boring, always nice to look at, didn't take itself too seriously, and
actually managed to convey an interesting, if not over-the-top yet amusing,
story line. If you're between the ages of 15 and 21, I am willing to bet my
monkey that you will truly enjoy this movie to the max! Most of the audience
with whom I saw it this picture were of that age, and seemed quite
rambunctious and favorable about their appreciation of this film.</P>
<P>More than anything, I thought that the movie was a beauty to behold, with
its beautiful people leading the way to beautiful clothes, leading to
beautiful homes, leading to beautiful cars, and well, you get the picture.
The actors were catty and enjoyable to watch, if only for their grandiose
manners, and their capacity to remind me of an ill-fated, but a guilty
pleasure nonetheless, dramatic TV series from the 1980s called "Dynasty".
Think of this movie as a better-looking version of that show called Dynasty
Jr., with a whole lot more emphasis on raw sexuality. Meanwhile, actor Ryan
Phillippe continues to score points as the young, innocent looking boy with
the big, puffy lips. His real-life sweetum, Reese Witherspoon is also very
effective in her role as the cuddly-as-can-be virgin, but more than anyone,
it is Sarah Michelle Gellar that takes the proverbial cake as the baddest
bitch from hell! She must've had a blast making this movie, cause her role
goes all out!! All in all, I recognize the fact that this film is not gonna
change the world or anything, but it was nice to look during its quick
runtime, had a decent soundtrack, and offered quite a few laughs with a cool
ending. Tight-asses beware, this one's not for you! This film is not to be
taken seriously. Laugh along, and you might just enjoy it :)</P>
<P>Note: The film is strung with sexual situations, with attempts at
feather-ruffling coming the way of a clear shot of Phillippe's hard apple
behind, some under-the-cover male homosexual activity, and an extreme
close-up of Sarah Michelle and co-star Selma Blair french-kissing.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ironically, Swoosie Kurtz actually repeats her role as Madame De Volanges
(Cecil's mother) in this current version.
Reese Witherspoon was truly discovered when her parents took her in for an
extra role in a film that was passing through town. Once seen by the
producers, she was moved into a role with actual lines, and eventually
garnered the lead role in that film. The movie was called THE MAN IN THE
MOON.</P>
