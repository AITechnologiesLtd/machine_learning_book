<P>     For about five minutes (and I'm being generous with this figure), 
THE 6TH MAN is marginally funny.  For the other one-hundred plus 
minutes, it's an unimaginative waste of time.  This film, directed by 
Randall Miller (HOUSEGUEST) and written on a kindergarten level by 
Christopher Reed and Cynthia Carle, develops a dubious premise in the 
most pedestrian manner possible.  Even fans of formula-driven sports 
movies will be bored by this entry -- not only is the outcome never in 
doubt (which is usually a given in this genre), but the road to the big 
victory isn't especially fun.</P>
<P>     THE 6TH MAN has obviously been released at this time of the year to 
capitalize on "March Madness" -- those few weeks during late 
winter/early spring when the NCAA basketball championship is decided.  
However, while audiences may be in the mood for a movie about the sport, 
they're likely searching for something more creative or energetic.  THE 
6TH MAN pales in comparison to the least competitive NCAA game.</P>
<P>     Antoine (Kadeem Hardison) and Kenny Tyler (Marlon Wayans) are star 
basketball players for the Washington Huskies.  Their inspired play has 
led the team to its best record in years.  However, all of the playoff-
bound optimism evaporates in a flash of tragedy when Antoine collapses 
during a game then dies on the way to the hospital.  The Huskies' 
fortunes tumble and Kenny, unable to take over his brother's role as 
leader, cries out that he can't do it alone.  Unexpectedly, his plea 
invokes supernatural help, as Antoine's spirit returns from beyond the 
grave to ensure that his former teammates make it all the way to the 
NCAA Final Four.  Suddenly, the Huskies are the beneficiaries of ghostly 
tip-ins, mid-air ball deflections, and other amazing examples of "good 
luck."</P>
<P>     Most of THE 6TH MAN's comedy is the result of Marlon Wayans' madcap 
physical antics.  Although Kenny can see Antoine, he's invisible to 
everyone else, so, on those occasions when the two brothers interact 
(such as when Antoine has Kenny in a headlock), all anyone else sees is 
Kenny in a position that would make a contortionist envious.  Some of 
these sequences are worth a hearty laugh or two, but there aren't nearly 
enough of them to justify the bloated one-hundred eight minute running 
length.  A script this thin would have difficulty holding an audience's 
attention for half that time.</P>
<P>     All attempts at drama end in failure.  This includes Kenny's feeble 
and unconvincing struggle to cope with his brother's loss, his romance 
with a female reporter (Michael Michele) who is experiencing a crisis of 
conscience, and the team's sudden desire at the end to win without 
Antoine's help.  THE 6TH MAN is by-the-book screenwriting at its most 
uninspired.  And Randall Miller's direction doesn't do anything to liven 
things up.  In fact, despite the presence of a number of real college 
coaches, he manages to make the staged basketball games look just that -
- staged.</P>
<P>     Marlon Wayans is the only one involved in this project who exhibits 
any talent whatsoever, and his effectiveness is destroyed by bad 
writing.  The rest of the cast -- Kadeem Hardison, Michael Michele, 
David Paymer (as the Huskies' coach), and Kevin Dunn (as a sports 
reporter) -- vary from mediocre to listless.  The most painful aspect of 
all, however, is being forced to watch the always-hyper Dick Vitale 
attempt to turn in an acting performance.  Vitale's endeavors to act 
spontaneous are laughably absurd -- a term that could describe this film 
as a whole.  THE 6TH MAN should be called for a very apparent foul.</P>
