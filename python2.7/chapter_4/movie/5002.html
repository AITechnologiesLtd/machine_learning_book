<P>     Since Edmond Rostand first committed the play to paper in 1897, 
CYRANO DE BERGERAC has become a reliable romantic formula.  From the 
various "straight" versions to Steve Martin's ROXANNE, and now THE TRUTH 
ABOUT CATS AND DOGS, the concept of a smart-but-plain person wooing 
their true love through a dumb, attractive intermediary has appealed to 
movie makers and audiences alike.  And, with a standout performance by 
Janeane Garofalo, this loose reworking makes for solid, if feather-
light, entertainment.</P>
<P>     It's hard to say enough about how good Garofalo is in this, her 
first major movie part.  In previous outings like REALITY BITES and BYE 
BYE LOVE, where she had supporting roles, she stole scenes; here, she 
walks away with the entire picture.  Possessing the rare star quality 
and natural charisma of performers like Sandra Bullock, Marisa Tomei, 
and Natalie Portman, Garofalo not only "eats up the lens", but also 
displays a fair amount of acting ability.  She's effective in dramatic 
moments, and her comic timing is perfect.  Although she gets second 
billing (after co-star Uma Thurman), this is her film, and it's likely 
to bring a number of offers for future work.</P>
<P>     The story, which starts out as upbeat variation of CYRANO before 
moving in another direction, introduces Garofalo as radio pet doctor 
Abby Barnes.  Her show, "The Truth About Cats and Dogs", has made her a 
household voice, but, as is often true for radio personalities, her face 
is less familiar.  One day, a British-accented photographer named Brian 
(Ben Chaplin) calls up with a problem:  he has an angry dog on roller 
skates ruining his studio.  Abby talks him through the process of 
pacifying the dog, and, in gratitude, Brian invites her out for a drink.  
She accepts, but, afflicted with low self-esteem, lies about her 
appearance.  Although Abby is a 5' 1" brunette, she tells Brian to look 
for someone 5' 10", blond, and "hard to miss" -- an exact description of 
her airhead actress/model neighbor, Noelle (Uma Thurman).</P>
<P>     When Abby explains her deception to Noelle, the statuesque beauty 
agrees to help, but it doesn't take long for things to get out of hand.  
Inevitably, Noelle becomes attracted to Brian, and the two women vie for 
his attention -- Noelle using her body and Abby, her voice. Brian 
doesn't realize that the face of his dreams isn't that of the woman with 
whom he has a seven hour telephone conversation that culminates in phone 
sex.</P>
<P>     Buying into the premise of THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS -- that 
any man could mistake a ditz like Noelle for Abby -- requires a huge 
suspension of disbelief, but, once you get past that stumbling block, 
the film is disarmingly charming, and even offers a few flashes of 
substance.  Nothing in the screenplay is groundbreaking, but there are 
some observations about low self-confidence.  Brian gets tongue-tied 
around women.  Abby is unsure of herself because she thinks she's ugly 
(although, in an ironic twist, Garofalo consistently looks more 
attractive than the "gorgeous" Thurman).  And Noelle has self-esteem 
problems because she believes herself to be stupid.</P>
<P>     The requisite chemistry between Chaplin and Garofalo is present, 
and the story follows an unthreateningly predictable route.  Director 
Michael Lehmann keeps both pacing and tone on track.  There aren't many 
surprises, but the script is written with a degree of wit, and there are 
some bitingly funny one-liners (all of which are delivered by Garofalo).  
As a romantic comedy, THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS offers exactly what 
fans of the genre appreciate -- lighthearted fun.  And, for Janeane 
Garofalo, this should be the launching pad for a promising career.</P>
