<PRE>The Beach (2000)</PRE>
<P>This movie was full of controversy. The shooting was in a national park in
Thailand. Knowing that a Hollywood cast and crew was shooting their national
park, a bunch of environmentalists showed up to protest the shooting. And
things got worse when they found out that the leading role was Mr. Leonardo
DiCaprio. Hundreds of schoolgirls joined the environmentalist, in hope of to
catch a glimpse of Mr. DiCaprio. But then again, which teenage girl
wouldn't?</P>
<P>Another controversy concerns the leading role itself. Directed by Danny
Boyle, who directed Trainspotting, he has worked with Ewan McGregor on his
three previous films. So this one, being his fourth one, was also written
for Ewan McGregor. But the movie company wanted to make more money, and who
else can bring girls to the cinema just to watch his face over and over and
over again besides Leonardo? "Oooohhh, he's soooo cute." (Actually that is
quoted from the girl sitting next to me at The Beach). So Leonardo's in, and
Ewan can practice to be a better Obi-Wan Kenobi.</P>
<P>Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) is travelling to Bangkok, Thailand on his own.
There he meets Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who gives him a map to a place, where
the beach is "paradise". Richard ask his two neighbors, Etienne and
Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) to come. So the three of them are set of to an
adventure in the Thailand.</P>
<P>Fast forward a bit (otherwise I'll be spitting the whole story out), and
Richard is left alone in the jungle. First he was lonely, he was afraid, he
was feeling rejected, but then he became Rambo. Rambo in a video game, to be
more precise. Which is funny, because he only has the looks, not the body of
a jungle survivor. But then again, he is Leonardo, and that's enough for
three quarter of the audience.</P>
<P>After the whole adventure then it's back to the real world. A very nice
ending scene, where the director really shows the difference between
paradise and real world. How we communicate using tools, and not using
direct methods.</P>
<P>Think of Trainspotting, but this time they're not high on drugs, but on the
beauty of pure nature.</P>
<P>Indra Moeljadi
is hoping someone will give a map to The Beach, wherever that is</P>
