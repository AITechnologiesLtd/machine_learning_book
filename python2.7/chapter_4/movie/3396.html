                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1995 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>Directed by Taylor Hackford
Written by Tony Gilroy
With: Kathy Bates (title role), Jennifer Jason Leigh (Dolores's daughter),
      David Straithairn (Dolores's husband),  Christopher Plummer
      (investigating detective).
130 minutes</P>
<P>     There are two kinds of Stephen King films: (1)  adaptations of his
novels and stories with supernatural elements, which range from real
trash (NIGHT SHIFT, THE MANGLER, etc.) to well-meaning mediocre to good
productions (THE DARK HALF, the television productions of IT and THE
STAND, THE SHINING, etc.) and (2) the Castle Rock productions of his
stories and novels without supernatural elements: STAND BY ME, MISERY,
and now DOLORES CLAIBORNE.</P>
<P>     The first category is sometimes entertaining, sometimes thrilling,
sometimes embarrassing.  The second category is consistently as good as
mainstream American cinema gets.</P>
<P>     Dolores Claiborne is a resident of a small island off the coast of
Maine.  She's had a tough life--an alcoholic husband who abused her,
hard domestic work all the time, nothing much else except her love for
her daughter.  When I read the novel I found it weak.  The central
scene in the book with Dolores's head silhouetted against the sky while
a solar eclipse reaches totality fell flat for me.</P>
<P>     But in the movie this scene sings.  We see Kathy Bates's rough
face in the left and in the upper right a perfect dark circle and
crescent of awesome beauty.  Then we shift to the circle of the view
from the well, then back again.  I was really overwhelmed.</P>
<P>     The story has been sharpened considerably from the novel.  The
novel is centered around Dolores herself and her hard life; the movie
is centered around Dolores's relationship with her daughter Selena.
Not only is the story better cinematically, it's stronger in any case.</P>
<P>     But even a much weaker script would have been saved by this
exceptional cast.  You have Kathy Bates, who of course won an Academy
Award for her work in MISERY; the highly talented and versatile
Jennifer Jason Leigh; David Straithairn; and Christopher Plummer.</P>
<P>     Bates, at least, and maybe Leigh as well, deserves another Oscar
nomination for her performance.  Their two faces fill the screen; the
constrast between Bates's plump roughness and Leigh's gaunt youth is
rich and full of meaning in itself.  The absorbing puzzle they find
themselves in, with Bates remembering everything but hiding it under
her crustiness, and Leigh remembering nothing--barely remembering her
mother, even--drives the movie and makes that transcendent moment as
the eclipse reaches totality stunning.  Leigh's spirited turn in the
courtroom recalls other famous Hollywood defenses.</P>
<P>     The cinemaphotography appropriately shows the modern scenes gray
and drained of life, as they have by events, and earlier scenes full of
garish color.  The last scene keeps this drained effect, marking the
way these two women cannot really recover their youth and innocence.</P>
