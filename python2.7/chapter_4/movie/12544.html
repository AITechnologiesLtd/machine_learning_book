<P>Something Missing from "Chinese Box" </P>
<P>Set during the last few months of colonial rule in Hong Kong, just prior
to her return to mainland China, "Chinese Box" is an intriguing film
that tries to encapsulate the mood of Hong Kong as symbolized through
its three main characters.  We meet up with John (Jeremy Irons) who is a
foreign journalist that has been living in Hong Kong for the last 15
years.  The world as he knows it is changing perilously fast.  Like the
British rule that is about to come to an end, John discovers that he has
an advanced form of leukemia and that he only has a few months to live.
"I wonder if I'll last longer than the British," he says of his
situation.  </P>
<P>John, despite having a family, has always carried a torch for the
beautiful Vivian (Gong Li), who is a karaoke bar manager and former,
high-priced club girl from mainland China.  Vivian is now in a
relationship with wealthy businessman Chang.  She longs for marriage and
family, but because of her less-than-honorable background, she
eventually realizes that a future for them is all but impossible.  Like
the tie between the mainland and Hong Kong, it is an uneasy relationship
fraught with innuendo, questions, and ambiguity.  </P>
<P>With only a short time to live, John would like to find a way to win
Vivian's heart again.  But he doesn't want to spend the rest of his
precious time just chasing her.  He also decides to take his video
camera wherever he goes so that he can document the city and her
secrets.  One such discovery is Jeanne (Maggie Cheung), who is a
resourceful peddler.  She tells her life story to John after being
offered money for an interview, and reveals how an English schoolmate
broke her heart which resulted in her trying to commit suicide.  Her
facial scars symbolize the torture of British influence.  But her
spirits are fiery as a result.  Later on in the film, John reacquaints
Jeanne with her long, lost love, but the now-young British man doesn't
even recognize her.  She weeps momentarily, but then soon begins to
peddle her wares with more determination.  This is a stately and poetic
scene that gives a glimpse into Hong Kong's fragility.</P>
<P>There is an underlying elegance to this film and its setting is innately
interesting.  In many scenes, we eavesdrop into conversations and listen
to the banter of the businessmen that speak of opportunities in the new
era.  Other parts of the film are seen through John's video camera.
John's need to record everything on video speaks to his desire to
preserve a Hong Kong that he has grown to love.   Yet, at other times,
watching can become a distracting experience.  Sometimes, it seems as if
the shooting is rushed.  Although the movie was shot during Hong Kong's
period of reversion to capture the frenetic atmosphere, the picture is
sometimes shaky as if the cameraman is struggling to keep up with all
that is swirling around him.</P>
<P>It also never quite reaches the dramatic heights that it seems capable
of given the rich atmosphere, time period, and beautifully envisioned
characters.  I couldn't quite embrace the reason why John pined for
Vivian.  Also, Vivian was by far the most complex character and her
desire and struggle for acceptance was intriguing, but her story is
largely left unexplored and we are left with annoying question marks in
our heads because we want to know what she will do next given her
resourceful nature.  Gong Li possesses an understated eloquence, but
seemed painfully underused.   Overall, I was fascinated by the
undertones marked by the impending changeover and was receptive to the
idea of opportunities that can arise from starting anew.   But there
seems to be so much more going on than what we could see on the screen.
Ambitious but ultimately unfulfilling, I wished that "Chinese Box" would
have revealed more.</P>
