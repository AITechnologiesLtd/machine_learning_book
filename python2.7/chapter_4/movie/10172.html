<PRE>                                      Kolya</PRE>
<PRE>                           A movie by Jan Sverak</PRE>
<P>Cellist Frantisek Louka (Zdenek Sverak) is an aging playboy. Since he
was thrown out of the National Philharmonic Orchestra because of
"subversive remarks" (the movie takes place before the communist
regime in Czechoslovakia came to an end), he only plays at funerals
and makes some extra money re-painting gravestones.</P>
<P>Because of his pressing financial needs he agrees to a fake marriage
with Nadeschda (Irina Livanova), a Russian woman who wants to obtain
czech citizenship.</P>
<P>According to their agreement they shouldn't see each other again till
the divorce, but she escapes to the West and thus draws the attention
of the police to him. To make things worse her mother suffers a stroke
and the paramedics leave Nadeschda's five-year-old son Kolya (Andrej
Chalimon) with Louka.</P>
<P>Louka doesn't know what to do with the frightened child who doesn't
even speak his language. His mother refuses to take care of him
because she hates the Russians. So Louka is stuck with Kolya and even
has to take him to work. Kolya is fascinated with the crematory. He
keeps drawing coffins that go through doors and once even re-enacts
the scene with his puppet theater.</P>
<P>Louka tries to hand the boy over to the authorities, but they are too
busy and tell him to wait. After a while Kolya starts to fit into his
bachelor's life. When finally a social worker shows up and tells him
that Kolya will probably be sent back to the Soviet Union he and the
boy hide with a friend in the countryside.</P>
<P>After the communist regime in Czechoslovakia crashes Nadeschda comes
back to get her son.</P>
<P>Jan Sverak has made a movie that's neither kitschy nor exessively
cute.
Andrej Chalimon is a real treat. The chemistry between him and Zdenek
Sverak is great. Kolya is no precocious boy wonder and Louka doesn't
become an unbelievable super-dad.</P>
<P>KOLYA concentrates on telling the story of the two protagonists, but
doesn't neglect the important events of 1989 and shows in an
unobtrusive way details from daily life in Czechoslovakia.</P>
<P>Louka goes to Prague with his friend Houdek to celebrate their new
freedom - and meets the two policemen who questioned him after
Nadeschda disappeared. Now the wave czech flags like all the others.</P>
<P>There are more charming minor characters. Louka gets his girl friends
to help him care for Kolya. The teacher Susie reads a Russian fairy
tale to the boy over the phone while her husband is next door taking a
shower. The singer Klara helps him to take care of Kolya when he is
sick.</P>
<P>Another highlight is the grave-digger's crazy family. He is
Nadeschda's cousin and the fake marriage was his idea.</P>
<P>All in all a great movie. Please give us more of that.</P>
