<PRE>                                    PATRIOT GAMES
                       A film review by Richard John Rauser
                      Copyright 1992 by WNI and R. J. Rauser</PRE>
<P>     Some films seem to fall into the hard-to-define category because
they have no idea what they want to be, or, even worse, they want to be
something they aren't.  PATRIOT GAMES is a shining example of this
dilemma: it is a techno-movie that wants to be an exciting action flick,
but fails miserably.  It fails for two main reasons: (1) Jack Ryan, the
character and (2) the problem of action vs. analysis.</P>
<P>     To start with Jack Ryan, let's be brutally honest.  This character
is boring.  He is uninspired.  He is bland.  He is dull as dishwater.
He is an analyst.   Yes, a CIA analyst, but don't let the "CIA" part
fool you, folks.  An analyst is an analyst whether they work for the CIA
or the Postal Service.  The result is that Jack Ryan is comfortable
behind a desk, clutching a pen, not crouching behind a desk, aiming a
gun.  The boring-as-hell Jack Ryan was a great character in The Hunt for
Red October, because that film was not an action film, nor did it
pretend to be.  It demanded an analyst and Jack was a good one.  PATRIOT
GAMES, by contrast, will not work as anything *but* an action film.
Unfortunately, Jack Ryan is as far from an action hero as can be
imagined.  Yes, he does hold a  gun a couple of times in the movie.  It
looks almost laughable.  The bulk of his time he spends behind a desk or
in a gloomy computer room, wearing a drab suit.   </P>
<P>     Here's the problem: even though this is a realistic portrayal of
CIA analysis, and even though Jack Ryan is a good character for what he
does, there is nothing exciting about watching Harrison Ford analyse
satellite photographs.  This film is, in a word, bland.  It isn't
exactly boring, but it continually kept building up for a large climax,
but then refused to give us a climax.  To use a sexual metaphor, the
film suffers from premature ejaculation.  </P>
<P>     There are terrorists, and they have guns, and yes, they even shoot
them (a couple of times).  But I wanted to see Jack Ryan fight the
terrorists with his own gun, shooting, ducking, running, jumping, and
saving his wife and child, as the previews for this film have so
deceptively implied.  </P>
<PRE>     What I got was Jack Ryan fighting the terrorists in his own, boring
way: as an analyst.  Sure, it's realistic, and yes, it's true to the
book (which I have read).  But it is also one other thing:
uninteresting.                   </PRE>
<P>     This brings me to my second point about PATRIOT GAMES' failure as a
movie: the problem of action versus analysis.  If you are like me, you
went (or will go) to PATRIOT GAMES expecting action.  Not brainless,
laughable, cartoon-style action like in Lethal Weapon 3, but
intelligent, solid, well portrayed action a la Die Hard or The Living
Daylights.  But this is simply not the case.  PATRIOT GAMES is *not* an
action movie.  It is as simple as that.  There are a few action scenes
scattered throughout the film, but they are over almost as soon as they
have done (as I said before, premature ejaculation).And what little
action we see isn't very exciting or nerve-wracking.  We never get time
to experience these emotions.</P>
<P>     So PATRIOT GAMES fails in terms of action, for the simple reason
that there is very little of it and what little we do see is over far
too quickly.  So how about analysis?  Oh, we get plenty of that.  A
typical scene from PATRIOT GAMES is Harrison behind  a desk, brooding
over photographs... Harrison looking into a hospital room,
brooding... Harrison at home, brooding... then cut to the IRA headquarters
and see the main villain also brooding....</P>
<P>     That is the main reason PATRIOT GAMES fails.  The type of movie it
sets itself out to be demands action to make it work.  And anyone who
has seen a PATRIOT GAMES preview will agree that the marketing people
tried (and succeeded greatly) to make this film appear to be a
fast-paced techno-action thriller.  Sorry.  It's a slow-paced
techno...film.  </P>
<P>     Any movie in which the IRA targets a CIA analyst for revenge HAS to
be action filled to work.  This movie has very little action, and what
action it does have is handled all wrong.  And, to make things even more
hopeless, the main character is an antithesis of action.</P>
<P>     The Hunt for Red October was also a techno-analysis film, but it is
a  fantastic film because it doesn't *want* to be an action film, and
doesn't *try* to be.  PATRIOT GAMES wants and tries to be an action
flick, but doesn't even come close.</P>
<P>     Perhaps it's my fault.  After all, I went to the theater expecting
to see Harrison Ford in his own Die Hard.  Nope.  What I saw was
Harrison Ford in his own, dull version of The Hunt for Red October...a
boring version of a great, entertaining movie.</P>
<P>     On a scale of one to ten, I have decided that PATRIOT GAMES
deserves 6 1/2.  Some elements of the plot are mildly interesting, and
the acting is quite good.  But I'm sorry, this film just doesn't
succeed.  You can have a great techno-analysis film, or a great action
film, but not both.  PATRIOT GAMES is certainly not action, and I doubt
if techno fans will think it's even a great techno-film.  </P>
<P>     On the other hand, PATRIOT GAMES is a fairly close adaptation of
the book, so if you enjoy being bored by Tom Clancy's overly-long,
bloated novels, then PATRIOT GAMES will probably suit you fine.</P>
<PRE>     Otherwise, avoid.</PRE>
