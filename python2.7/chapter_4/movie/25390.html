<PRE>"Little House on the Prairie" in flames
The Patriot</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"The Patriot" loyally rides strong in the first act. But becomes somewhat
disillusioned during the third and especially the second acts. Mel Gibson
fervently brings the father/soldier role to life.</P>
<P>In the 1770's, "retired" from the service, Mel is called to arms as a
Patriot, a supporter of a free America, to win the country from those pesky
British during our revolutionary war. A family man, he shrugs, "I'm a parent
... I don't have the luxury of principles."</P>
<P>There's a great deal of heartfelt father, son, family tension in the early
portion of the film, but all that gives way to blood, guts and the gory of a
very realistic wartime barbarity ... a sort of red, white and blue
"Braveheart." But as the body count mounts, the film changes its mind about
how it will portray killing. Eventually, the gory of war becomes the glory
of war.</P>
<P>Also a bitter mixture: the graphic seriousness of hand to hand, bayonet to
face field battles with corny throwaway humor. Though just a hand full in
number, these comic relief quips ... ring like laughter at a funeral. And
the schmaltz ... it's laid on maple syrup thick. I have a high tolerance for
melodrama, but this dose, tipped my strong stomach. One church/militia
recruitment scene breaks the schmaltz barrier and should have been cut from
the film.</P>
<P>Tough to swallow also, Mel twice uses the same shallow "trick" to fool red
coat officers. The first time it was cute, the second time, blatently
ridiculous in a film that strives to portray the revolutionary war
realistically. And the scene where these hungry war torn militiamen grimace
at the prospect of eating dog - just foolish. They're starving!</P>
<P>But you've gotta love Mel! When you see him there in the middle of South
Carolina, shots whizzing by, canons exploding, cotton wisping in the cold
cloudy sky like snow, riding a strong steed while clasping that gorgeously
unfurled 13-star United States of America flag ... you kind of forget about
all those years he spent in Australia. Preparing to rescue one of his sons,
Mel is absolutely savagely loving, brutally fatherly as he dashes through
the forest carrying an armful of muskets. That scene is beautiful.</P>
<P>Fantastically cast, Heath Ledger (of "10 Ten Things I Hate About You" fame)
gives a steadfast performance as Mel's number one son. Also contributing in
the acting department, Chris Cooper (who usually plays the jerk-dad,
"American Beauty") is commanding in perhaps his only good guy role this
year. And of course, the fight scenes are careful, powerful, stunning, and
quite realistic.</P>
<P>It's a big film, two and a half hours. You'll leave feeling like you've just
watched a mini-miniseries.</P>
