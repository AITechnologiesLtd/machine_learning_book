<P>     Great premise, terrible execution.  How many times have I written 
that line this year?  It was true of too many summer releases, and 
apparently nothing has changed with the turning of seasons.  In the case 
of THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, it's especially frustrating, though, because 
the basic idea is so intriguing -- the perfect background for a top-
notch noir thriller.  Unfortunately, director Renny Harlin (DIE HARD 2, 
CLIFFHANGER) wasn't at all interested in making a tightly-paced, 
character-driven movie.  What we get instead is exactly what we've come 
to expect from him -- lots of gunshots, explosions, and general mayhem.  
When the smoke finally clears for the final credits, we may have had a 
tolerably good time, but there's no lingering satisfaction.</P>
<P>     The premise involves that age-old plot staple of soap operas:  
amnesia.  Samantha Caine (Geena Davis) is the perfect mom.  A teacher at 
a suburban Pittsburgh elementary school, she doesn't allow cursing 
around the house and dotes on her 8 year old daughter, Caitlin (Yvonne 
Zima).  Samantha doesn't have much of a past, however.  She was found on 
a New Jersey beach eight years ago, and, because of a condition the 
doctors call "focal retrograde amnesia", she can't remember anything 
before that.  But lacking a personal history doesn't really bother her 
because her present is so pleasant.  She has almost given up on 
discovering her former identity -- almost, but not quite.  Then Mitch 
Henessey (Samuel L. Jackson), the latest in a long line of private 
investigators she has hired, finds a possible clue.  At the same time, 
Sam is involved in a car wreck, and, as the result of a head injury, her 
past personae -- a government assassin named Charly Baltimore -- begins 
to resurface. </P>
<P>     It would have been fun watching Sam struggle with the emotional and 
moral consequences of uncovering a sordid past, but, what we get instead 
is a gallery of villains (Craig Bierko, David Morse, Patrick Malahide) 
using guns, bombs, and hand grenades to eliminate her.  (True to form 
for a 1996 film, some of the bad guys are government agents.)  She 
shifts effortlessly from Sam to Charly as circumstances demand, never 
paying a psychological penalty.  Maybe I was expecting a little too much 
from an action film, but the Hitchcockian ideas are so juicy that they 
deserve deeper exploration.</P>
<P>     The action, unfortunately, is distressingly routine.  There are 
some nifty sequences, such as when Mitch gets blown out of a window or 
when Sam does a little surfing on top of an out-of-control, overturned 
tanker truck.  Alas, these are nothing more than visual candy.  Missing 
is the freshness that marked that action sequences in Harlin's 
directorial debut, DIE HARD 2.  </P>
<P>     Apparently, Harlin did A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT to escape the ugly 
shadow of CUTTHROAT ISLAND, one of the biggest duds of last year.  
(Imagine anyone thinking they could make money with Matthew Modine as an 
action hero!)  His wife, Geena Davis, is again the lead, but for this 
role she has beefed up a la Sigourney Weaver (ALIENS) and Linda Hamilton 
(TERMINATOR 2).  Davis is a good enough actress to carry off the dual 
identity, although Charly seems a lot like a humorless cross between LA 
FEMME NIKITA and a female James Bond.  Sam is more appealing, which is 
obviously the intention.  Everything possible is done to delineate the 
differences between Sam and Charly.  We're supposed to root for Charly, 
the ruthless killer, knowing that Sam is buried somewhere in her 
personality.  At least the end is about reconciling these disparate 
identities.</P>
<P>     The real reason to see A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, however, is Samuel L. 
Jackson, who steals the movie out from under Davis.  Jackson is 
magnificent, and I'm going to recommend the film largely on the basis of 
his turn as Mitch.  I wasn't wild about A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT as a 
whole, but this is the kind of delightful performance that deserves to 
be seen.  Jackson adds more than a dash of humor to the action mix, 
throwing out one-liners guaranteed to send audiences into paroxysms of 
laughter (his line about people trying to get out of New Jersey brought 
down the house, but that may have something to do with where I saw the 
movie).  Whenever Jackson was on screen, I forgot about the film's 
shortcomings and appreciated what he was doing with Mitch.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, I suppose an individual's enjoyment of A LONG KISS 
GOODNIGHT will be greatly affected by expectations.  If you're searching 
for a slick-looking, mindless, Bond-derived action film with a buff 
female hero, this should fit the bill nicely.  But if the premise leads 
you to expect something a little more interesting -- possibly even a 
change of pace for Harlin -- A LONG KISS GOODNIGHT will disappoint.  
Regardless of your viewpoint, however, keep your eyes on Jackson, and 
you'll understand how I can generate some enthusiasm for this otherwise 
uneven, overblown explosions extravaganza.  </P>
