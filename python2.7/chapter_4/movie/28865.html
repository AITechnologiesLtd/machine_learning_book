<PRE>A LIFE APART: HASIDISM IN AMERICA
A film review by Julia Levin
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Legend has it that one rabbi, when coming to America, couldn't fit the
Torah's scrolls into their new covers.  "We can't modify the Torah to
fit America," he said, but "we will tailor America to fit the Torah."  A
Life Apart: Hasidism in America is a thoughtful, compassionate
documentary that illuminates the philosophy behind Hasidism's stubborn
refusal to join the American mainstream.</P>
<P>Even among different denominations of Jewish religion, Hasidism stands
alone, a religion of minorities among minorities.  The invaluable
quality of this film is that it neither critiques nor praises the
Hasidic religion.  For a subject matter as extreme and uncompromising as
the religion itself, A Life Apart is wonderfully even-handed. 
Throughout the film, which starts and concludes with an exuberant
wedding ceremony underlying the significance of ritual for the Hasidic
community, we dig into the mystic philosophy behind the Hasidic refusal
to participate in the contemporary world.</P>
<P>Unwilling to obey societal rules, Hasidic Jews, the majority of whom
came to America in the 40s and 50s, still evoke disdain in mainstream
society.  Described by many as smelly, ugly, and mean looking, they
consider themselves a spiritual elite, thus not mingling with
non-Hasidics.  To keep their Hasidic life style, they deny the very
premise of attaining the American dream.</P>
<P>Narrated by Sarah Jessica Parker and Leonard Nimoy, the film traces the
roots of Hasidic teachings, first introduced by Baal Shem Tov, a founder
of Hasidism who made complex spiritual ideas accessible to less educated
people.  His way of explaining the presence of God by sanctifying
routine activities and everyday occurrences gave his followers deeper
spiritual meaning.</P>
<P>The geographic trajectory of A Life Apart reaches as far as Ukraine,
where the Hasidic movement originated, and Moscow, once an epicenter of
anti-religious destruction and where Hasidism is experiencing an
enormous revival today.  The focus of the film, however, remains
constant: an intimate examination of vibrant, ritualistic Hasidic life
in Brooklyn, a center of the Hasidic world.</P>
<P>In a series of interviews, Jewish theological scholars, community
members, and their families -- as well as non-Jews -- discuss the
struggle between traditionalism and modernism and pose questions about
the central ideas of Hasidism.  Hasidism means giving up a majority of
occupational options and, therefore, subjecting their families to a life
of severe financial restraint.  It means never sending one's kids to
college or a regular school, watching television, or going to the cinema
(which means they won't be seeing this movie).</P>
<P>Against the multicolored, multiracial New York landscape, Hasidim, in
their black coats, sidelocks, and enormous hats, look shockingly
foreign, yet as the film demonstrates, they are American Hasidim.  By
the end of the film, much to my surprise, the same wedding I watched at
the beginning nearly touched me to tears, for it acquired a different
meaning.  I have never been one for sentiment, but I do believe that
this is what good art should be able to do: To give us back to ourselves
and transform our preexisting beliefs or ignorance into something new.</P>
