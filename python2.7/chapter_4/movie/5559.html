<PRE>                                 STRIPTEASE 
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**(out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The advertising campaigns for this are at least as interesting as the 
movie itself. First it was a "nekkid Demi Moore shaking her hooters" 
film with the previews demonstrating the two compelling reasons to see 
it. Having captured the male audience, the commercials began a "mother 
fighting for her daughter" approach to appeal to women.</P>
<P>Now it's a "comedy where you least expect it", grasping for yet another 
audience. Among the split personalities, "Striptease" has also been 
touted as "not 'Showgirls'!" Talk about damning with faint praise.</P>
<P>Moore's latest sure-to-be-blockbuster is all this and _less_. </P>
<P>Erin Grant is a ex-FBI secretary (fired because she made a poor choice 
in husbands) turned stripper in order to win back custody of her 
daughter. The logic in that plan typifies the confusion of the entire 
film.</P>
<P>Among the colorful characters at the Eager Beaver, the club where she 
dances, is a fan who promises to help get her daughter back. He has the 
misfortune to end up floating in a nearby lake. Coincidentally this 
happened just after he tries to blackmail a US congressman sighted at 
the club.</P>
<P>More people associated with the representative end up dead and you begin 
to get the idea that everything may not be on the up and up. Golly! It 
turns out you were right and the Florida congressman is controlled by 
the evil sugar empire.</P>
<P>An almost unrecognizable Burt Reynolds turns in one of the oddest roles 
of his career as the drunken congressman David Dilbeck. Played for 
laughs, the character is occasionally hilarious, but the murders, his 
genuine sleaze and general worthlessness as a human being make it 
difficult to evoke much laughter.</P>
<P>Ving Rhames ("Pulp Fiction", "Mission: Impossible") is one of the few 
actors that come out of this looking good. As Shad, the strip club 
bouncer with a thing for roaches and yogurt, he shows a talent for dark 
comedy. Robert Patrick as Grant's ex livens up the screen: first as a 
frightening total jerk in his encounters with Moore and their daughter 
and then as a farcical total jerk as he mixes canine morphine and 
alcohol and flops from scene to scene.</P>
<P>Moore can act although certainly not well enough to deserve her highest 
paid actress in Hollywood status. Here she and everyone else struggle 
with a butchered script from a reportedly great book. The film moves 
from slapstick comedy to sordid and deadly political scandal to 
heartbreaking mother and daughter scenes without much finesse or 
success.</P>
<P>Despite its shortcomings, this film will surely make the big bucks as 
audiences flock to attend if for no other reasons than to discuss how 
many implants Demi has.</P>
