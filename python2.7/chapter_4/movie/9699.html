<PRE>                                 YEAR OF THE HORSE
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: **1/2 (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<P>Fans of Neil Young and Crazy Horse should relish the affecting documentary
"Year of the Horse."  Its director, Jim Jarmusch, clearly thinks the band
is the bee's knees.</P>
<P>The film is composed of concert footage of the band during their 1996
European tour, as well as interviews (in a kitschy laundry-room setting)
and additional concert and interview footage from 1976 and 1986.</P>
<P>Half the time the generally dazed and confused band don't know which city
they're in or, five minutes before a show, which song they're going to open
with.  As for the documentary itself, one of the band members is
consistently skeptical of the filmmaker's work-in-progress.  "Like asking a
few questions will capture everything there is to know about Crazy Horse?"
he scoffs.  He also accuses Jarmusch of making an arty film just so people
will think he's cool.</P>
<P>Ironically Jarmusch, the director of quirky, off-beat films ("Stranger Than
Paradise," "Night on Earth," "Dead Man," etc.) was cool long before he made
"Year of the Horse."  A smattering of acting roles have helped sustain that
image, most recently with his Frostee Cream Boy cameo in Billy Bob
Thornton's "Sling Blade."</P>
<P>What's surprising about "Year of the Horse" is its distinct lack of
insight.  When reduced to talking heads the band members--Ralph Molina
(drums/vocals), Billy Talbot (bass/vocals), Frank "Pancho" Sampedro
(guitar/vocals), and Young himself (guitar/vocals)--have little of any
significance to say.  The most descriptive summation of being a part of
Crazy Horse from a band member's perspective is "heavy."  "It's hard to
describe in words," he says.  It's not unlike some sporting superstar
talking about the game: "You go out there and you give it your best shot
and you hope you get a result"--duh.</P>
<P>But once Crazy Horse gets on stage these aging, not very attractive men
(although there's nothing wrong with Neil Young that a barber and a good
tailor couldn't fix) powerfully demonstrate everything they've been unable
to articulate verbally.  Instantly there's synergy: the three guitarists
playing together in close proximity, acting on non-verbal cues, totally
immersed in the music, creating their singular, soaring sound to thunderous
applause.</P>
<P>As the engagingly dull interviews get more and more meaningless, the music
gets increasingly potent.  "Pure," as Young himself puts it.  The music is
very good and Jarmusch gives us nine full songs, including "Stupid Girl,"
"Tonight's the Night," and the anthem-like "Like a Hurricane" that closes
the film.</P>
<P>Jarmusch's "glue" that holds the picture together is the artier stuff that
Pancho references, wonderfully edited by Jay Rabinowitz: collage-like
snippets of soundstages, motorbikes, and American landscapes flashing by;
adoring nationals, singing Swedes, indecipherable Glaswegians.</P>
<P>"Proudly" shot in Super-8, 16mm, and Hi-8 video, the graininess of the
material gives the film a home movie-like texture, echoing the band
members' grunginess (that's grunge in the seamy sense, not the Seattle
sound sense).  This is a film of contrasts: black and white; black and
white and color; decades--'76, '86, '96; words, and music.</P>
<P>A band that plays together doesn't always stay together but after almost
thirty years, Neil Young and Crazy Horse are still cranking it up.  And in
"Year of the Horse," it's the music that speaks for itself.</P>
