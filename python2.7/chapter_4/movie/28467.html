<PRE>SEXY BEAST
A film review by Julia Levin
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>No, it's not a porno movie.  It's yet another British crime caper film. 
And frankly, we'd rather have the porn.</P>
<P>Gal (Ray Winstone), an old time ex convict, is now retired.  All he does
is sweat by the pool, enjoy his form porn star wife Deedee (Amanda
Redman), and share drinks with a couple of good friends.  The setting is
Spain, the sun is hot, and life is free of trouble... until, of course,
one day when the peace must be disturbed -- and it is, by a guy named
Don Logan.  Presumably the titular sexy beast, Don (Ben Kingsley)
appears on the scene and hell breaks loose as Gal gets back into his
life of crime.</P>
<P>If you remember Kingsley's roles in Gandhi, Death and the Maiden, or
Schindler's List, you'll definitely be surprised.  His Don Logan, with
bald head, goatee, and wiry physique resembles a cobra when he is silent
and a crazed cockroach when he speaks.  Don's years in organized crime
have destroyed anything human he might have once had; he is now spooky,
profane, socially maladroit, and extremely annoying.</P>
<P>And he's anything but sexy.  In one scene, Don furiously leaves the
airplane after refusing to extinguish his cigarette.  Detained by
Spanish officials, he concocts a story of a sexual assault by a steward
-- the most darkly humored and misbegotten story of sexual harassment
one could conceive of.</P>
<P>As an actor, Kingsley has achieved what was required of his beastly Don:
You want to strangle him when he spits out profanities and run away when
he moves toward you.  The rest of the characters -- Gal (as played by
Winstone, who has delivered strong, nuanced performances in Nil By Mouth
and The War Zone), his wife, their friend Aitch (Cavan Kendall), and the
ominous mob boss Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) -- are all second-hand
parodies of cinematic stereotypes.  The film tries to convey Gal's
emotional turmoil in escaping his newfound life of crime, but it is
really only able to rise to B-movie standards.</P>
<P>Sexy Beast marks the directorial debut of award-winning commercial and
music video director Jonathan Glazer.  And I would sincerely hope that
after this film tanks, Glazer will be content, just like Gal at the
Spanish villa, to go back to more familiar terrain.  Sexy Beast,
conceived as a black comedy/thriller and shot as a commercial,
occasionally drips with irony and sometimes gives you pause, not knowing
whether to wince or laugh.  But mostly it just makes you shrug.  Well,
perhaps that was the idea.</P>
