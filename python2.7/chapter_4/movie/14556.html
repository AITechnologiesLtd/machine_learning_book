<P>John Waters' new film, Pecker, tells the story of its title character,
a teenage boy (Edward Furlong) who likes to take pictures of everything
he sees.  The film closely follows a few months of his life, during
which we are introduced to the various people he knows.  There's his
girlfriend, Shelley (Christina Ricci), a harsh and cynical girl who runs
the local laundromat; she's very decided on her laundromat policies. 
Then there's his insane and intensely happy family, soccer-mom (Mary Kay
Place) and bartending dad (Mark Joy), and his maniacal sugar-freak
sister, Little Chrissy (Lauren Hulsey).  Included in, but not residing
with, the family is Tina (Martha Plimpton), who DJs in the local gay
bar.</P>
<P>All of this is a rather colorful backdrop to a strangely perfunctory
subplot involving art dealer Rorey Wheeler (Lili Taylor) who sees
Pecker's work at his first show (which he holds in a burger joint).  She
thinks he's "brilliant" and "a genius" (those art dealers are always so
quick to label), and soon the entire art world agrees with her.  He has
his opening in New York, and his photos immediately sell for huge
amounts of money.  With his popularity, however, Pecker soon becomes
disliked in his hometown of Baltimore as the residents are hounded by
reporters wanting insights into Pecker's life.  </P>
<P>Waters, over the last few decades, has made some interesting pictures,
almost none of which I've seen.  The only one I have seen is Serial Mom,
which I enjoyed immensely.  Pecker is also enjoyable, and often
hilarious, but, by the end, I wondered what it was all about:  the film
really has no center.  Its themes are pretty limp; we've had more than
one criticism of the art world this year (Henry Fool and High Art come
to mind), so Pecker seems weak by comparison.  As entertainment, it more
or less works, but I can't help thinking that the film could have been
better.  </P>
<P>I like Furlong as an actor, but I haven't seen him do much of anything
interesting since Terminator 2.  He's not unlikable here, but he
displays very little of the energy that he did in his first
performance.  I think he can act, and he does have presence, but he
doesn't show much of that in Pecker.  Ricci, on the other hand, has
certainly proven herself (even if you only count 1998 films); she's also
strangely sedate here, though she has a few shining moments (the scenes
involving her attacking her customers are very funny).  Most of the
other performances are highly energetic:  Place and Joy create
wonderfully cloying parents; Plimpton is likable as a
homosexually-obsessed woman; Taylor is perfectly pitched for satire; and
young Hulsey is dead-on as the ADD child.</P>
<P>But I'm not sure what brings it all together.  Waters is telling a
story, but the story is one we've heard before:  small-town kid makes it
big and decides he doesn't like it.  What makes Pecker unique is its
unbelievable sense of giddy madness.  This film is ridiculously happy
and upbeat; Pecker's home life, for instance, is everything a kid could
hope for (actually, the family values displayed in the film are
surprisingly strong).  But how does this compare to the dirty scenes
featuring lesbian strippers (one of the film's funnier moments)?  The
last line of the film, which has Pecker shouting, "I think I'm gonna
direct movies!" makes me wonder if Waters was attempting some kind of
rough autobiography.  In all honesty, I don't know what the film is
about, and I left it feeling rather indifferent.</P>
<P>I did, however, enjoy myself as I watched it.  I laughed frequently,
the high points including the lesbian dance sequence (truly hilarious)
and a great scene outside a male strip bar where heterosexual patrons
are dying to get "tea bagged."  Pecker has its moments -- and there are
many -- but I wish Waters had been a little more straightforward with
what he was trying to accomplish.  It's a film that will make you laugh
and leave you feeling unmoved, unless, of course, you've never ever seen
a film about a small town kid making it big.  Even so, it doesn't add
much dimension to the premise.  </P>
