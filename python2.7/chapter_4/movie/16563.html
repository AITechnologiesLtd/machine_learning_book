Reviewed February 6, 1999.</P>
<P>Blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's "Like Water for Chocolate" and 
1991's "The Butcher's Wife," "Simply Irresistible" attempts to be a 
whimsical romantic comedy but, more often than not, comes off as 
laughable, leaving you to wonder why rising star Sarah Michelle Gellar 
(T.V.'s "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer") would choose such an obviously 
inept film project to waste her time on.</P>
<P>Things get off to a bad start right from the onset as Amanda (Sarah 
Michelle Gellar), a young woman who runs her late family's struggling 
New York restaurant, runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of 
crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air. While out shopping, she 
also meets Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery), a charming, handsome man, who 
happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he 
works for, and later when he decides to drop by her dive, called 
Southern Cross, for lunch, she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for 
him, even though she is known to not be a very good chef. Suddenly, 
Amanda finds her restaurant, on the edge of foreclosure, rejuvenate to 
life as customer begin to swarm for her food, which strangely causes 
everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths. Are Amanda and 
Tom destined to be together? And is it not just because of the magical 
food, but because they really, truly like each other? And what exactly 
is going on with the food she is making? Does it have anything to do 
with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen 
somehow assisting her in her food preparation?</P>
<P>"Simply Irresistible" is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic 
fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna. It takes one joke---that 
people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and 
recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an 
appropriate running time of 95 minutes. Add in a music montage every ten 
minutes (these are actually the best scenes in the movie, which 
certainly tells you something about the film itself), and what you've 
got is an utterly empty, if not necessarily boring, excursion. </P>
<P>The cast of "Simply Irresistible" is fairly good, but it is the 
supporting characters who are the most interesting. Patricia Clarkson 
(1998's "High Art," in which she played a drugged-out lesbian) is a 
standout as Tom's colleague, and is thankfully given a few funny lines 
of dialogue. Also of note is Larry Gilliard Jr., as Amanda's cooking 
assistant and buddy, who is allowed to create a seemingly full character 
out of only a handful of scenes. Of the main stars, Sarah Michelle 
Gellar is fine, but really does often look like she's struggling through 
the unmistakably clumsy material, and if Sean Patrick Flanery plans on 
keeping a film career in the future, he has certainly got to pick better 
projects than this.</P>
<P>The bottom line is that "Simply Irresistible" is the exact opposite of 
its deprophesized title, and when the movie got to the point where the 
characters began to float in mid-air (an unamusing plot device that was 
repeated in the stupid last scene), my mind checked out from the 
characters and the romance. When I think about it in hindsight, I should 
have checked out in the very first scene, where the point of the action 
was for Gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical 
crab. Now, that certainly is what I'd call magical!</P>
