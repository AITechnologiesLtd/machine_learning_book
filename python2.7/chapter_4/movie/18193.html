<PRE>THE MUMMY (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Steve Kong
Copyright 1999 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>The Mummy is a seriously flawed film that is saved by only two things: Its
tongue-in-cheek attitude and the over-the-top action.  Sure, there were
some spectacular special effects, but they hurt the film more than they
helped.  I'll get to that later.</P>
<P>As the film opens we are transported back three thousand years where we
meet Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) a high priest that is cursed and buried alive
the burial/mummification is quite a nasty process.  Flash forward to 1923
where we meet adventurer Rick (Brenden Fraser) O'Connell who is hired to
lead a librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) Carnarvon and her brother Jonathon
(John Hannah) to find the lost city of Hamunaptra in Egypt.  At Hamunaptra,
Jonathon expects to find a buried treasure.  Evelyn is going for the
challenge; Hamunaptra has never been found nor explored.  Along the way we
also meet a mysterious group of men who seem to have some vested interest
in Hamunaptra and give the adventurers a warning, `Leave or die.'  There is
also the sub-plot about another group of adventurers led by a backstabbing
former friend of O'Connell, Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner).</P>
<P>When the groups get to Hamunaptra both go in different directions with
their explorations.  But, together they find something completely evil:
Imhotep.  After mistakenly reading out of the wrong book, Imhotep is
revived from the dead and is now out to unleash the ten plagues onto Egypt
not a pretty sight given that it includes locusts, flesh-eating scarabs,
and other things that would make your skin crawl.  As you might have
guessed it, it's up to O'Connell, Evelyn, and Jonathon to save the world.</P>
<P>The Mummy is not a serious film by any means.  The previews do it injustice
by portraying it as some serious take on Indiana Jones  it's not.  The
Mummy is a comedy action-adventure film that does everything with its
tongue planted firmly in cheek.  There are numerous scenes where I burst
out laughing from either the sight jokes or from one-liners.  There are
quite a few tense, thrilling, and frightening moments in the film, but for
the most part to enjoy this film you need to walk into the theatre knowing
and expecting that it is a comedy action-adventure film that has a large
dose of special effects.</P>
<P>Fraser is brilliantly cast as O'Connell who is a tough guy with a sly
mouth.  Fraser has that rugged look, but also has the comic timing that is
needed to pull off the part of O'Connell.  In the action scenes Fraser is
fun to watch as he pretends he's in a John Woo film  double fisted pistols
and all.  Weisz, whom I last saw in the horrible Chain Reaction, does well
with her part also.  She does very well with the material she is given.
And John Hannah, who I enjoyed immensely in Sliding Doors, also does well
in The Mummy.  The person with the least spoken lines is Arnold Vosloo, but
he does very well as the creepy Imhotep.  Vosloo is absolutely horrifying
as Imhotep and during the scenes where he is in the stages between the
living and dead, he is terrifying.</P>
<P>The director, Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) writes the script.  Sommers
needs to be paired up with another writer because his characterizations are
absolutely non-existence.  The script moves like a hyperactive child from
one toy to the next.  This script never stops to take a breath, sometimes
leaving the audience behind in its rampage to get to the next action scene.
 This film runs over two hours long and could have easily been cut to a
much better length at 90-minutes.  As a director Sommers shows that he
knows how to do action.  The action sequences in The Mummy are stand out
and are mixed with a sly sense of humor.  I enjoyed the action in The Mummy.</P>
<P>As for the special effects, they were laid on a bit too thickly.  Even as
the film opens there is a heavy dose of special effects that instantly took
my attention away from the story that's being told.  The special effects in
some places are used wisely, but more often then not the special effects
are used to wow the audience  some of which works, like the sand storm, but
most of it just does nothing but make the audience wonder how it was done.
I liked the special effects in the film, but wished that Sommers could have
shown some restraint in its usage.  The effect that I liked most was that
of the mummies.  They had this quality of being up-to-date yet old and
nostalgic.  You'll have to see the film to know what I mean by that.  The
mummies just look cool but move with that Jason and the Argonauts type
movement.</P>
<P>Overall, I enjoyed The Mummy, it doesn't quite make it up to the point of
being a Don't Miss film, but I do highly recommend it.  This is a great
popcorn fluff film that will scare you, make you laugh, and move you to the
edge of your seat.  The Mummy is one of those films that I like to stick in
the category of Stupid-But-Fun.  Catch The Mummy during a matinee showing
for its inventive action, special effects, and the comedy of Brenden Fraser.</P>
