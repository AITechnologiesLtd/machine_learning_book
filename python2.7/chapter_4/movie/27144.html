<PRE>"The Visit"</PRE>
<P>Alex Walter (Hill Harper) is serving 25 years for a rape he says he didn't
commit. His once close knit family has abandoned him, except for the
occasional visits by his brother, Tony (Obba Babatunde). Now, five years
into Alex's sentence, Tony journeys to the prison once again, but this time
it's different. Alex has AIDS. With the help of prison psychiatrist Dr.
Coles (Phylicia Rashad), Alex learns to cope with his disease and confront
the rift he caused for his family in "The Visit."</P>
<P>Newcomer Jordan Walker-Pearlman's ambitious debut as
director/writer/producer is based on the play of the same name by Kosmond
Russell. The story begins with a long overdue visit by Tony to his younger
brother. It has been ten months since their last reunion and, it turns out,
Alex's parents have never been to the prison to see him. The younger man
breaks the news to Tony that he is dying and wants to see his family, maybe
regaining some of their past closeness.</P>
<P>When Lois and Henry Walters (Marla Gibbs and Billy Dee Williams) finally
make the two-hour journey to the prison, mom could not be more ecstatic
about seeing her little boy after so many years. But, dad can't let the
past just sit and stew, so he begins to deride Alex for his mistakes. All
the while, Alex denies his guilt. The confrontation abruptly ends the visit
and Lois must leave with not enough time with younger son. But, a seed is
planted and there is the hope of more time together.</P>
<P>Soon after, Alex receives another visitor, Felicia McDonald (Rae Dawn
Chong), a childhood friend who has had her own series of hard knocks
through life. Felicia suffered the incestuous advances of an abusive
father, bore his child, and became a crack cocaine addict and a petty
criminal. She killed her father to protect her son. Now, she's on the mend,
is off of drugs and is caring for her son and his cerebral palsy - a
product of her father's rape. Her visit to Alex is a recuperative one as
she rekindles their old friendship, giving Alex some solace in his despair.</P>
<P>The episodic visits continue with mom and dad, Tony, Felicia and her son
coming back to see Alex. A new life, of sorts, emerges as Alex loses
himself in a fantasy world of soft lights and the gentle touches of loved
ones. It's a nice melding of the sweet fantasy with the brutal reality of
prison life. The despair is well tempered by the positive developments
spawned by the visits and some fabulous acting.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast focuses on Alex as he undergoes an odd sort of redemption
in the life he finds, again, with his family and Felicia.  Alex is
spiritually rescued as he draws his family back to him. The real treat is
Rae Dawn Chong as Felicia. She comes on screen as a nice, well-adjusted
woman visiting an old friend. As she unfolds her past to Alex, we find out
what a harsh life she has had, making her present state of well being all
the more remarkable. It's a stunning performance that reps one of the best
supporting roles this year. Marla Gibbs actually glows in the warm light of
her love for her sons. Billy Dee Williams is suitable gruff as the
disappointed dad whose love for his family helps him get past his shame of
Alex. Obba Babatunde serves well as the bridge between Alex and his family.</P>
<P>Fledgling filmmaker Walker-Pearlman makes a striking first entry into
feature films. There is a great deal brewing in the mind of the writer that
makes a statement on the psychological impact of incarceration on the
inmate and his family. Innocent or guilty, the fact that he is in prison is
a stigma that Alex, his family and, especially, his father must overcome.
The helmer's visual style is raw with overused close-ups and shaky hand
held camerawork, but there is talent there, too. I give "The Visit" a B-.</P>
