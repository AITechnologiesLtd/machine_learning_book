<P>(a/k/a  Ma vie en rose; French with English subtitles)</P>
<P>"Sometimes you just have to be yourself," claims the tagline on the movie
poster. Of course, being oneself is usually easiest for children, before
they learn what is expected of them from society or their families.</P>
<P>So what happens to those children who at an early age know they are
different, especially in a suburb where you know what to expect every day,
where every morning the wives walk their husbands to their cars, all
simultaneously, and where the same reckless neighbor in the yellow
hatchback almost hits you every day? What happens when you are a
seven-year-old boy who deep down knows he wants to be a girl, and marry
that little boy, Jerome (Julien Riviere), across the street?</P>
<P>This is the moment of discovery for Ludovic (George Du Fresne); but it's
not a good discovery. It is perfectly natural for Ludo to want to have
long hair and wear lipstick and earrings and some pretty dresses. It even
seemed perfectly natural to Jerome to allow Ludo to engage him in a play
wedding. So what went wrong? The adults freaked out and the classmates
instinctively move to hit the nail that stands out among the others.</P>
<P>While all the performances are very good--the angry neighbors, the
bewildered parents, the understanding psychologist, and the vicious
classmates--it is Du Fresne's portrayal of Ludovic that is absolutely
amazing. It's hard to know how this child actor is able to portray this
character whose innocence is shattered at this moment, when he learns to
that to say what you feel is to dig your own grave (apologies to Sinnead
O'Connor). Whether he is weathering the pain of disapproving parents,
dressing up, or fantasizing about escaping into the World of Pam
(Belguim's answer to Barbie), Du Fresne is a natural. Frankly, I don't
know how he does it. Perhaps he has not had his innocence completely
shattered by the real world yet.</P>
<P>Michele Laroque and Jean-Philippe Coffey as Ludo's trying-to-understand
parents are also excellent.</P>
<P>This is possibly one of the best movies of the year. If you have every
felt different or outside, you will find this movie hitting you in the
heart; and if you are inside, you get a glimpse of what it's like for
those who are outside, or rather, pushed out. </P>
