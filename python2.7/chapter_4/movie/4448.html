<PRE>                                EYE FOR AN EYE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     This movie kinda sneaked up on us, huh?  You've probably never even
heard of EYE FOR AN EYE.  (I hadn't until the screening pass arrived in
the mailbox last week.)  But you'd think with a cast of Sally Field,
Kiefer Sutherland, Ed Harris, Beverly D'Angelo, and Joe Mantegna, the
studio would be pushing it a little harder.</P>
<P>     As well they should, because, put simply, this isn't your typical
Sally Field movie.  A long way from "Gidget," EYE FOR AN EYE is the very
aptly titled story of Karen McCann (Field), a white bread mother whose
daughter is raped and murdered (in an exceedingly disturbing opening
scene) by a nutcase killer (Sutherland).  Ed Harris plays Mack, Karen's
second (and very understanding) husband, and Mantegna is the investigator
on the case.</P>
<P>     The killer is apprehended, but a legal technicality sets him free. 
Frustrated with the legal system and obsessed with vengeance, Karen
decides to take the law into her own hands, with some interesting
consequences.</P>
<P>     What makes this a really creepy film is not so much the plot and
Karen's morbid fascination with the killer, but it's the fact that it's
*Sally Field* with a streak of retribution running through her.  Adding to
the chilly mood is a perfectly cast Sutherland, looking and acting like
he's straight out of ten years in Attica.</P>
<P>     The movie itself could have been a lot more than it ended up being. 
The plot turns out to be pretty much open and shut, as not much in the way
of a classic "thriller" ever starts you guessing or even makes you jump in
your seat.  Instead, the slow pace gets the film to evolve into more of an
in-depth character study than anything else, which probably isn't the
direction this picture needed to take.  Put simply, the movie just never
*grabs* you.</P>
<P>     In the end, EYE FOR AN EYE turns out some good performances in ho-hum
roles.  And while the tension slowly builds up over the course of the
film, it never quite makes it to where it desperately needed to go.</P>
