 Warner Bros./Village Roadshow
 Director: David O. Russell
 Writer:   David O. Russell, story by John Ridley

<P>   President George Bush expected to win the election of
1992 and who could blame him?  Americans traditionally
give another spin to an incumbent chief, Democrat Bill
Clinton was effectively portrayed as a draft-dodger, the
economy was in decent shape, and most of all Bush emerged
a hero after winning the Gulf War against Iraq.  Whatever
went wrong with the campaign, Bush would have lost by even
greater numbers if "Three Kings" were released during the
contest for the high office.  Written and directed by David O.
Russell ("Spanking the Monkey," "Flirting with Disaster,"), this
film combines Russell's experience in doing quirky indie
features with his adeptness at the action-adventure genre to
portray the American president as a man who essentially lost
the war.  How so?  Although Kuwait was effectively freed
from its occupation by Saddam's Iraqi troops, Bush may have
lied to the rebels in Iraq who wanted to see Saddam toppled. 
According to the story by John Ridley, Bush had promised
that if the anti-Saddam people rose up in revolt against the
leader they hated, the Americans would support them--just as
JFK had promised aid to Cubans who'd rise up against
Castro.  But Bush, like Kennedy, demurred on his promise,
leaving those naive enough to believe him to be slaughtered
by Saddam.</P>
<P>   "Three Kings" is not a knee-jerk anti-war picture. It does
not give the message that combat is futile.  After all, the U.S.
did succeed in its stated mission to liberate oil-rich Kuwait
and to keep the pipelines flowing unhampered to the West. 
Instead, by effectively combining a Saturday Night Live kind
of irony and wit with some special effects that are more
germane to Illustrated Man science encyclopedias, Russell
effectively criticizes America's callous, overly pragmatic
aims in the war.  The White House comes across as a force
interested only in an economic success--keeping black gold
gushing and flowing into Western gas tanks and factories--
while turning its back on the downtrodden people of that
hapless Middle Eastern nation.  </P>
<P>   But "Three Kings" is no sermonizing bit of agitprop in favor
of more aggressive action.  The picture portrays the war as
violent, though not in the ruthless manner of Steven
Spielberg's wonderful "Saving Private Ryan"--but rather as a
panorama of utter craziness, from the booze-filled celebratory
parties of the American troops to the frenzied pot pourri
involving rebellious Iraqis against the loyalists, and Americans
against the former.  As in the Vietnam War, one could
scarcely blame the U.S. for confusing the two groups, hardly
able to sort out friend from foe.</P>
<P>   The picture opens just after the war allegedly ends with a
cease-fire in 1991, an agreement that should have meant the
termination of all gunplay.  But the desert sands stir when
Captain Archie Gates (George Clooney), learning of the
existence of gold that Saddam had stolen from Kuwait
which lies stores in a bunker, decides to cut himself in to
some of the bullion. Grabbing three soldiers who have
extricated a map of its whereabouts from an Arab's anal
cavity, he sets out with Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg),
Sgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), and Private Conrad Vig (Spike
Jonze--who, incidentally directed the even quirkier movie to
be released soon, "Being John Malkovich").  Rationalizing
that they would not really be stealing since the gold is in
possession of their country's arch enemy, they lose an
aggressive reporter, Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) and go off to
find the bullion.</P>
<P>   In a Kafkaesque scene, the Yanks watch helplessly--
ignored by pro-Saddam troops who are concentrating on
rebels in a village--until an enemy soldier shoots a girl's
mother.  From point on, chaos reigns as the gold-digging
quartet discover scruples they never knew they had and risk
court martial by shattering the cease fire and discharging
rounds against the Iraqi soldiers.</P>
<P>   Using special film stock to show the disorientation of the
troops, Russell adds some poignant scene including one in
which an Iraqi, having captured Troy Barlow, speaks to him
about his own pain--how his one-month old son was blown to
bits by American bombs released over his village while
Barlow's little daughter is safe with her mother in Arizona.</P>
<P>   Director Russell wears his morality on his sleeve, playing
with the old philosophic inquiry about whether disobeying
orders can be more ethical than complying with directives
from on-high.  He startles us at several points, showing what
happens to a man's body when a bullet pierces the skin.  In a
kind of World-Book scientific exploration, he essentially x-rays
a soldier at the moment of a bullet's impact, showing how the
cartridge penetrates organs releasing bile and a subsequent
host of bacteria--which leads the victim to be overcome by
sepsis and ultimate death unless swift action is taken.  </P>
<P>   Filmed in Mexicali and parts of Arizona and California,
"Three Kings" is a treat for a sophisticated audience: an
opulent film with indie conventions running throughout yet
one which could satisfy a larger audience of action-adventure
fans.  Like Andrew Fleming's comedy "Dick," however, "Three
Kings" may baffle those who are too young to have lived
through the Gulf War, who have not read much about it, and
who may be perplexed by the confluence of forces which
sometimes fire upon one another, at other times ignoring the
opposite side.  Ice Cube is growing as an actor while George
Clooney and Mark Wahlberg turning in predictably
professional turns in the first major American movie to deal
with 1990's combat.</P>
