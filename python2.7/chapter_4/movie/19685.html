<P>_Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_, writer Lona Williams and director Michael Patrick
Jann's dark mock documentary details the events leading up to Mount Rose,
Minnesota's American Teen Princess pageant, namely the rivalry between
two leading candidates: rich bitch Becky Leeman (Denise Richards),
daughter of the pageant coordinator and former Teen Princess (Kirstie
Alley); and trailer park good girl Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), daughter
of a former runner-up (Ellen Barkin).  Williams and Jann's targets are
easy ones--pageants, Minnesotans, small towns--but the film bats a
surprisingly low hit-to-miss ratio, with the truly inspired moments (the
wheelchair-bound, anorexic reigning Teen Princess's wincingly hilarious
musical number) lost in a sea of just plain unfunny ones (Amber's mother
gets a beer can permanently fused to her hand after an explosion).  Also
a big miss is the predictable "mystery" element to the film, which has a
number of contestants meeting untimely eliminations from competition. 
Ultimately, _Drop_Dead_Gorgeous_ exhibits a lot of attitude, but not a
whole lot of smarts.</P>
<P>Dunst has much better luck with the _other_, much more intelligent
satire she is also currently starring in, _Dick_.  In what can be
described as "teenage Romy and Michele take down the president," teen dim
bulbs Betsy (Dunst) and Abigail (Michelle Williams) fall into the good
graces of President Nixon (Dan Hedaya) and the positions of "Official
White House Dog Walkers" after witnessing the Watergate break-in. 
Indeed, it is not the most promising of premises, but director Andrew
Fleming, along with Sheryl Longin, writing collaborator turn it into gold
by deftly weaving fact and fiction into a wholly convincing--and
hilarious--tapestry.  For instance, we learn the "true" origin of Tricky
Dick's famous stance as well as what was on those missing 18 and a half
minutes on Nixon's tapes (nothing criminal, but perhaps something more
embarrassing).  Ironically, it is those clever details that will likely
lead _Dick_ to suffer the same weak box office fate that befell another
savvy satire, last spring's _Election_--it is simply too smart (and, in
this case, too historical) for its targeted teen audience.  (_Dick_ opens
August 4)</P>
