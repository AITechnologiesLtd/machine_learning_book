<PRE>THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Have you noticed nowadays how many movie previews push the name of
the director almost as much the film's principal actors?  "A film by Tony
Scott" or "A Mike Nichols film" the guy with the mouthful of marbles will
state confidently at the end of the preceding montage.</P>
<P>        I would tend to guess that most people who drag their carcasses out
to their local megaplex on a Saturday night couldn't care less who
*directed* the film they're about to see.  Half of them don't even care
who's *in* it.</P>
<P>        And so to "The Replacement Killers."  The voice-over at the end of
its television trailer somberly announces "Directed by Antoine Fuqua."
Antoine who?  Like, does anyone know who Antoine Fuqua *is*?  (No.)  Has he
directed anything of note before?  (No.)  Has he directed *anything*
before?  (Yes, a music video.)  So what's the point?</P>
<P>        The point, unfortunately, is that "The Replacement Killers" *isn't*
a film by John Woo.</P>
<P>        Woo is the acclaimed Hong Kong filmmaker responsible for some
highly kinetic action pictures on that side of the globe.  His films are
spectacularly staged ballistic ballets with, frequently, an ageless,
charismatic leading actor called Chow Yun-Fat caught somewhere in the
middle.  Movies like "A Better Tomorrow," "The Killer", and the sensational
"Hard-Boiled."  Then Woo came to the States and made a couple of duds, "Hard
Target" (with Jean-Claude Van Damme--no surprise there) and "Broken Arrow."
Then he finally redeemed himself with last summer's "Face/Off."  Next he's
executive producing a comedy/actioner of sorts, "The Big Hit," "a Kirk Wong
film."</P>
<P>        "The Replacement Killers" certainly *looks* like it could be a John
Woo film. (It should; he executive produced this one too.)  For starters it
stars Chow Yun-Fat.  And it's choc-o-bloc with scenes of hit men (and Mira
Sorvino!) flying through the air with both barrels blazing.  But there the
comparisons end.</P>
<P>        The action sequences, of which there are many, are not particularly
well staged, or crafted.  They're just there.  Ad nauseum.  The plot, too,
is relatively untaxing--hoods hound Chow when Chow reneges on hit; Chow
drags Sorvino's forger around town as security for ticket back to mainland
China to save family; Chow and Sorvino get shot at a lot--and it simply
allows for more of those understaged, sub-crafted shoot-outs.  As for
style, Fuqua's approach seems to be black=cool.  Witness Chow's sunglasses
(indoors!), the shadowy exteriors, the leather garb of the title
characters, and Sorvino's constantly exposed undergarments (she's supposed
to be tough and we know that tough chicks like to hang around in their
underwear, even when they're working, right?).</P>
<P>        Chow and Sorvino make a respectable pairing, and even Jürgen
Prochnow ("Das Boot") is suitably well-dressed and oily in a throwaway
henchman role.  When the replacement killers (cuz Chow reneged, remember?)
track the good guys down to a crowded video arcade and start shooting, all
of a sudden there's nobody around.  Where'd everybody go?  And why the heck
didn't Chow and Sorvino go with them!?  It's logic like that that leaves
"The Replacement Killers" in the gutter time and time again.</P>
<P>        Now that Chow Yun-Fat has crossed the ocean it would be nice to see
him handling something a little more sophisticated than a pair of firearms
(perhaps tinkling the old ivories like Clint Eastwood did in "In the Line
of Fire"?).  If you're planning on seeing Antoine Fuqua's film, let me
suggest any Woo/Chow movie on videotape as a replacement.</P>
