<P>In an electrifying performance that has "Oscar" (no pun!) written all
over it, Stephan Fry brings to life Oscar Wilde in this new film about
this most remarkable (again, no pun) man.   Fry's portrayal will come
as no surprise to those who remember him for his performances in COLD
COMFORT FARM, A FISH CALLED WANDA, I.Q., PETER'S FRIENDS, as well as
his unruffable Jeeves.   In this version of Wilde, we see the many
facets that brought Wilde to the attention of the world.</P>
<P>Despite  a most flashy style of dress and demeanor that was shown to
his admiring public, in private life his manner was that of a devoted
family man to his  dearly beloved wife, Constance (Jennifer Ehle) and
his two children.   In a weak moment, however, a young guest seduced
him, making him  aware of his homosexuality that had been kept in
abeyance since his school days when he first became conscious of it.
When later, at the age of 38,  he met the very handsome Lord Alfred
Douglas, a 22-year-old Oxford graduate, he entered the path that in a
Victorian age with its strong anti-gay bias could only lead to his
downfall.   When his new friend introduced him to "rent boys," male
prostitutes, it inevitably lead him further to neglect his wife and
children and culminated in a disgracing jail sentence for "lewd
conduct" with men.</P>
<P>Despite the passion for his male friends and his new life, he remained
a most popular author and wit.   Some of his better-known works
included books and plays: LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN, THE IMPORTANCE OF
BEING EARNEST,   THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY .    Among his many
witticisms, perhaps the best known are: "In this world there are only
two tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants, and the other is
getting it."   "To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong
romance."   "We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at
the stars."   "There is no sin except stupidity."   "The only way to
get rid of a temptation is to yield to it."</P>
<P>The film story of Oscar Wilde is beautifully brought to life  because
of its excellent cast.    With Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave, Jennifer
Ehle, Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt, Michael Sheen, Zoe Wanamker and Tom
Wilkinson doing the honors of supporting Fry, the film is sheer
perfection.</P>
