<PRE>                    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   1 :-)  for the spy who knew nothing</PRE>
<P>Cast: Bill Murray, Joanne Whalley, Alfred Molina, Peter Gallagher,
Richard Wilson, Geraldine James, John Standing, Anna Chancellor
Director: Jon Amiel
Screenplay: Robert Farrar and Howard Franklin based on the novel "Watch
That Man" by Robert Farrar</P>
<P>The problem with spy movies carrying comedy at every turn, is the
necessity to retain credibility with the audience and yet sustain the
slapstick humour right till the very end. A prime example that fails to
do both are the NAKED GUN movies. On the other hand, I feel THE PINK
PANTHER movies succeed solely because of the classical Sellers
performance they contain. Parallels can be drawn between THE MAN WHO
KNEW TOO LITTLE and Inspector Clouseau, yet it pales in comparison
because of Bill Murray.</P>
<P>The plot begins with an ordinary, down and out actor, Wallace Ritchie
(Bill Murray), who visits his successful, wealthy brother James (Peter
Gallagher) in England. In order to get the odd ball, family failure out
of his hair, James arranges for Wallace to join a live street theatre,
where the acting is played out in the real world. Unfortunately, Wallace
is in the wrong place at the wrong time and gets involved with actual
murder and mystery. However, Wallace remains totally ignorant of this
fact even when his life is in constant danger; and this is where the
problem lies - trying to maintain his naivety. The role of Wallace
requires the charms of an innocent fool; a role not suited to Murray (he
can play the fool, but with little charm or innocence), but a role ideal
for the late Peter Sellers.</P>
<P>Overall there are some amusing scenes with misplaced bombs, assassins
who are assassinated, playful torture scenes and wild car chases all
reminiscent of the 60's PINK PANTHER, but sadly missing Sellers. Bill
Murray tries his best but unfortunately is unable to carry out the part,
not because he is a bad actor, but because it requires a certain type of
actor. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is adequate as a slightly, ditzy bombshell,
whilst Alfred Molina has fun with his role as Boris the Butcher.</P>
