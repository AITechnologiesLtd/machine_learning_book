<PRE>                              MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS
                       A film review by Nicholas Capezza
                        Copyright 1996 Nicholas Capezza</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: **** out of ****</PRE>
<P>     Mr. Holland's Opus is definately one of the finest movies ever 
created about teachers. It shows the life of a man who first started out 
as being a temporary teacher into a legendary community member. Richard 
Dreyfuss gives one of the best performances of his career as the teacher. 
While there are not a lot of big names, the supporting cast is very good. 
I recommend Mr. Holland's Opus to anybody who likes a good, old-fashioned 
movie.</P>
