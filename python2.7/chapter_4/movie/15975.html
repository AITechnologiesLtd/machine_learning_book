<PRE>                              THE FACULTY
                      A film review by Bradley Null
                       Copyright 1999 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>Finally.  We always knew Robert Rodriguez had talent as a filmmaker.  We
were just waiting for someone to put a good script in his hands, and
Kevin Williamson has done that here.  Do not be fooled by the woefully
bad trailers, or by the fact that critics have roundly panned this
horror film.  THE FACULTY is easily the best of the genre to come along
since Williamson's breakout hit, SCREAM.  It is also the first watchable
film Rodriguez has put up since storming onto the scene with EL
MARIACHI.</P>
<P>Easily the biggest problem with this movie is in the marketing.  I can
only imagine how pissed off Williamson, Rodriguez, and everyone else
involved in the movie must have been to see the film marketed as just
another schlocky entry into the horror genre, which generally takes the
words aliens; teenagers; battle; suspicious; killer; small town; etc.
and jumble them up to come up with a concept (to wit, this time: 
suspicious small town teenagers battle killer aliens).  Now if you are
already a big 80's horror fan, just skip this review, because you
already saw the movie, but this review is for people who are highly
suspicious of shelling out eight bucks to see a horror flick.  The only
reason I actually saw THE FACULTY was because my little sister begged me
to.  But now I'm trying to convince you to.</P>
<P>Actually, THE FACULTY is just as witty as SCREAM, slightly less
original, but makes up with it by acknowledging its status as
essentially an update of Donald Siegel's 1956 classic INVASION OF THE
BODY SNATCHERS, one of the most frightening movies ever made, before
Hollywood began trying to make you jump in your seat rather than truly
fear the end of the world.  Granted, with Robert Rodriguez and his
frenetic camera involved, this update heightens the sense of urgency and
makes you hop up a time or two.  But, unlike his substance-lite
stylizations in DESPERADO and FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, Rodriguez manages to
hold onto the wit and character of Williamson's script and fashion a
film that not only gets your heart racing, but also manages enough
intelligence to force you to suspend your disbelief.</P>
<P>To top it all off, THE FACULTY throws in some good BREAKFAST CLUB social
commentary about high school social hierarchy, and examines the lasting
effects of a surreal experience on such an ingrained social order. 
Granted, THE FACULTY's not SCHINDLER'S LIST, but if you give it a chance
it will make you think a little bit.  Which is a good thing.</P>
