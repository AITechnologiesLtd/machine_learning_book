<P>I suppose people who wear rose-tinted glasses see the world in shades of 
pink, as pink as the fabrics that covered the walls and chairs of 
American houses in Life magazine ads, circa 1960.  Yes, pink is the 
color of nostalgia.</P>
<P>And we are reminded of the importance of nostalgia by Hugh Wilson's 
'Blast from the Past'.  Its story begins outside of Los Angeles in a 
neighborhood of picture-perfect tract houses.  Professor Calvin Weber 
(Christopher Walken) is an eccentric and rich scientist who has secretly 
built a fallout shelter large enough to contain a replica of his house.  
As the Cuban missile crisis reaches its worst moments and nuclear war 
seems imminent, Dr. Weber drags his pregnant wife (Sissy Spacek) down 
into the shelter, which is equipped to sustain a family of three for 35 
years.  The plot gimmick that causes the family to stay underground for 
the entire time is a plane crash:  just as the Webers are safe in the 
shelter, a military plane plows into the back yard, and the bespectacled 
schlump sets the irreversible locks.  Convinced a holocaust has 
destroyed the city and perhaps the greater part of the world, the Webers 
recreate a polite and perfect microcosm with their new son Adam (Brendan 
Fraser, when the boy reaches adulthood).</P>
<P>Of course we have seen all this before.  Think of Marty McFly in 
reverse, transported into the future.  Even Brendan Fraser has been 
there, in 'Encino Man' and, in the same fish-out-of-water sense, 'George 
of the Jungle' (itself a text from the 1960's).  But the filmmakers know 
how we love to gaze longingly at our history.  In its own way, the film 
manages to serve as a history lesson, imparting a good deal of cultural 
as well as political knowledge.  What is puzzling about fondness for the 
past is the blind faith that those years were better than these, that 
people were happier, in every important way, than we are.(It's ironic 
that we would look through those lenses of distorting pinkness at a time 
that engendered a near-nuclear confrontation.)  Yet the formula works, 
and 'Blast from the Past' supplies us with laughs and a romantic 
relationship that is at times witty and original.  When Adam must 
venture into what he thinks is a post-nuclear, mutated world, he takes 
up with a rather rootless woman (Alicia Silverstone), who is conscious 
of her lack of depth, but who is also oddly principled.</P>
<P>Brendan Fraser turns in a solid performance as the walking anachronism.  
Indeed the movie milks his out-of-place experiences for all it can;  
Fraser for the most part plays along with a dry and naïve humor, though 
at times he does look blank or even stunned.  We know that his character 
is in love with Alicia Silverstone's Eve, but he is simply too polite 
and mild to pursue her affections meaningfully.  Fraser is at his best 
when Adam shows sudden inspired bits of accomplishment - when he speaks 
French and later swing-dances skillfully at a dance club.  He's likable 
all the time, but especially when he displays his tenderness toward his 
parents and his would-be girlfriend.  </P>
<P>Alicia Silverstone is very watchable as well, although our early 
impressions of Eve approach a stereotype:  she's the cynical and spoiled 
girl-woman, street-smart and smart-mouthed, a darker version of the 
shallow Cher from 'Clueless.'  Why is her performance good?  Because 
Silverstone knows her way around the camera, seeming very comfortable 
and assured as she commands Adam's attention during the ups and downs of 
their relationship.  This young actress has denounced phoniness in her 
everyday life, and seems to be applying the same credo to her acting.</P>
<P>Christopher Walken can appear in any movie I pay for, especially in his 
quirky characterizations.  We care about Calvin Weber the loving father 
and husband, and we're willing to laugh at his paranoid, commie-hating 
craziness.  Sissy Spacek is underused, but in her short scenes dominates 
in the dry humor department.  Mrs. Weber walks outside the "house" to 
scream, and imbibes the cooking sherry in her advertisement-perfect 
kitchen.</P>
<P>Set design is tricky in this film.  Most memorable is the interior 
decoration of the Webers' houses, both above and below the ground, 
meccas of post-war pastel luxuries, kitchens full of wondrous modern 
appliances, living rooms packed with fringed furniture.  A hilarious 
sight gag involves the land above the fallout shelter, a block that 
undergoes massive change in the decades following the plane crash.  
Directly above the Webers' elevator are a sleazy bar and its owner, who 
thinks the beings crashing through his floor are three incarnations of 
supreme beings.  The mantra the grungy bar owner adopts is "Leave my 
elevator alone," and his cult of the homeless in one of the funnier 
running gags.</P>
<P>The score brims with period songs, the rhythm of the vintage music 
helping to move the narrative along.  Over the closing credits we hear a 
song by written and sung by Randy Newman, a piece of cutesy doggerel 
relating to the film's premise.  Aren't we getting a bit over-exposed, 
Randy?</P>
<P>'Blast from the Past' is certainly a good date movie, and it has enough 
laughs to recommend it for theater viewing.  Unfortunately it has one 
'f-word' and a slew of 's-word' jokes, as well as a few seconds of the 
characters' visiting adult video stores: hence the PG-13 rating.  Why, 
Mr. Wilson, couldn't a few seconds be excised in pursuit of a plain PG?  
It's not a must-see, but it is a pleasant way to pass two hours, the 
haze of nostalgia simmering like dry ice along the theater floor.</P>
