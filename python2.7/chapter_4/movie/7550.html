<PRE>                              HOLLOW REED
                       A film review by Jun Yan
                        Copyright 1997 Jun Yan</PRE>
<P>        The small English film "Hollow Reed" is a little like a
made-for-TV production  on Sunday night.  It's inspired by a real
incidence and it centers around a divorced couple and their small son.  It
also contains an inflammatory homosexual relationship.  Howeverr, the
sincerity and seriousness of the filmmakers to the issue of child abuse
seperate this film from others that exploit and sensationalize such
tragedy.  </P>
<P>        Martyn is a middle-class physician who was divorced because he
could not deny any more the fact that he was gay.  Presently, he is living
with a cute (even to a girl) lover and has a stable, happy relationship.
His ex-wife Hannah, who is still bitter about the unfortunate marriage,
has an equally pleasant relationship with an architect Frank.  Martyn and
Hannah's small son Oliver.  Naturally, Hannah has the custody and Martyn
has only a restricted visiting right -- who says it's easy to be a
homosexual and a dad the same time?  </P>
<P>        The film starts with Oliver's frentic escape to his father's
apartment with a terrible cut on his face.  He was frightened, but lied
about the cause and the person responsible for such a brutal crime.  It
was not hard for any viewer to figure out who did it, and it was a little
odd that Martyn the father did not until the second incidence in which
Oliver ended up with hand fractures.  At least the filmmakers made no
secret that Frank, Hannah's boyfriend, is a violent child abuser.  </P>
<P>        Things got sticky when Martyn went to court seeking the custody
and safety for his son.  He was obviously on not-so-firm ground being
homosexual and living with a man.  Tension escalated to a final showdown
between the father and the abuser.  I have to say that it's not a
completely satisfying ending to deserve the heart-wrenching development of
the whole film.  </P>
<P>        Even though childless as I am, I did not hold back a couple of
drops of tears when I watched the unspeakable scenes of child abuse.  It
was, however, more of rage than of sadness, and it made the character
Hannah a not very believable person -- at least to me.  Even after her
seeing the abuse with her own eyes, she continues to allow her boyfriend
living in the house and getting the chance to beat up her young,
defenseless child.  The film goes through great trouble to argue that she
is not a bad person and she loves Oliver very much, yet I just don't buy
that.  Of course, it's true that a parent's pleasure and happiness may not
be consistent with their child's, but I still cannot imagine anyone who
loves their children would let such horrible abuse go on.  The writers
want us to sympathize  with Hannah along  with feeling for Oliver -- well,
they cannot have it both ways, no matter how hard they try to explain her
bitterness and hurt from her failed marriage.  </P>
<P>        Martyn, the father, was more sensibly written and easier for the
audience to identify with.  His anguish and frustration are understandable
and his situation beyond his own control.  The helplessness of not able to
protect his own son is nicely delivered by Martin Donovan.  Still, I
cannot help comparing this film to Sling Blade, which involves a similar
theme of child abuse.  The characters in this screenplay pale due to
their simplicity and lack of depth.  They are farely straight forward,
especially the villain Frank, who is stereotypical and very predictable.
The situation is also fairly see-through for the audience to take sides.
One side is a loving and decent father and his extremely understanding and
caring companion in a warm, stable relationship; the other is a selfish
mother (yes, selfish, a more old-fashioned word than denial) who weighs
her own pleasure over her child's safety and a terrible scumbag
child-beater.  There is no challenge, no dilemma, no ambiguity in the
situation.  The same problem lies in the climax of the film that is too
convenient and too easy.  </P>
<PRE>        Some detailed in the film are very neatly done and the child actor
is very good and heart-breaking.  I give "Hollow Reed" a B.  </PRE>
