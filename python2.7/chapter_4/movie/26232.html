<P>   "What's Cooking" is one of those movies that make you
wonder why so many people bother having families.  In the
case of the folks in this film by Gurinder Chadha ("Bhaji at
the Beach"), there's no problem of money.  All can afford the
kids they've had.  But if there's just one day of the year that
families should show how happy they are to be together
feasting on turkey with all the trimmings, that day is of course
Thanksgiving.  On the other hand, the enforced closeness
could give rise to a outbreak of seething conflicts and to
revelations of truths that most of the diners would rather not
face.  The latter informs the theme of the movie scripted by
director Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges which is directed in
the mosaic style favored by Robert Altman.  The movie falls
way short of anything done by Altman, as "What's Cooking"
lacks dialogue to match the pungency of the spices used on
the holiday bird.  What makes the picture worth viewing at all
are the performances by some first-rate stars who are stuck
in a genre that's as fresh as two-week-old turkey leftovers.</P>
<P>   In the tradition of foodie movies like "Woman on Top," "Like
Water for Chocolate" and "Babette's Feast," "What's Cooking"
features some mouthwatering photography by John Lin of a
cornucopia of provisions, all of which are cooked by four
families who live within walking distance of one another in a
prosperous section of L.A.  Each family puts its own cultural
stamp on the national dish, some adding kugel for dessert,
some stuffing the bird with chili peppers, while another adds
macaroni and cheese to the traditional greens.  While the
four groups are doing well financially, they are of various
ethnic and cultural backgrounds; specifically, Vietnamese,
Black, Jewish, and Latino.  Oddly enough, though, the
conflicts that rage within each household are not specific to
its cultural background but are of the sort that could easily be
imagined to take place in any of the diverse groups explored
here.  </P>
<P>   The only really comical interchange takes place within the
Jewish household.  Ruth and Herb Seelig (Lainie Kazan and
Maury Chaykin) have a daughter Rachel (Kyra Sedgwick)
who brings home her lesbian lover, Carla (Julianna
Margulies) as a guest.  While the Seeligs are not exactly
kvelling over their daughter's orientation, they're not kvetching
either.  The dinner comes to life at dessert time as the
slightly inebriated Aunt Bea (Estelle Harris) asks the young
women some question that evoke surprising answers.  </P>
<P>   As the African-Americans giving thanks, Audrey Williams
(Alfre Woodard) has a problem with her husband Ronald
(Dennis Haysbert), who is an aide to the conservative
California governor.  Ronald works long hours and, in fact,
may not be working during some the time he's away from
home.  Audrey is particularly stressed out on this day
because her intrusive mother-in-law criticizes her cooking, 
turning her nose up at the shiitake mushrooms that Audrey
uses in place of the traditional stuffing.  </P>
<P>   The Latino family of Elizabeth Avila (Mercedes Ruehl) is on
the verge of tumult during the Thanksgiving feast when
Elizabeth's estranged husband Javier (Victor Rivers) shows
up though invited only by their son Anthony (Douglas Spain),
while the Vietnamese living a hop away and presided over by
Trinh Nguyen (Joan Chen) go ballistic in discovering that their
daughter Jenny (Kristy Wu) has a condom in her jacket
pocket and their son Gary (Jimmy Pham) is hiding a gun.</P>
<P>   While L.A. has gotten bad press during the past few years,
the cops getting the brunt of the hostile journalism and the
country getting the impression that every teen is in a gang,
"What's Cooking" provides a nourishing antidote.  If the story
is banal, the dialogue lacking in sharpness, and the
exposition taking forever before Chadha cuts to the chase,  
the well-acted film is a love poem to the city of angels,
making Thanksgiving into a valentine's-day ode to American
diversity.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 106 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
