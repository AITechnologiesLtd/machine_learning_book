<P>The most annoying of several cloying holiday films, ''Patch Adams'' takes 
the true story of a '70s medical student who defied school authorities 
with his humorous, personal approach to patient care, and twists it into 
yet another platform for Robin Williams to ham it up. The human Care Bear 
chucks all the restraint he displayed in ''Good Will Hunting'' and 
returns to his tired shtick, careening between manic cornball gags and 
mawkish sentimentality. The whole thing plays like a really long Robin 
Williams' talk show appearance with a plot slapped on.</P>
<P>Williams plays Hunter ''Patch'' Adams, a real-life doctor who currently 
operates a highly unorthodox clinic in West Virginia. His interest in 
medicine began in 1969, when he became suicidal and committed himself to 
a mental hospital, only to discover that his contacts with fellow 
patients were more therapeutic than sessions with his doctors. Adams 
decided to become a physician himself and entered medical school, where 
he annoyed the hell out of the medical establishment by blurring the 
doctor/patient line with his heartfelt, Catskills comic approach to the 
sick and suffering.</P>
<P>Adams' real-life story, documented in the 1993 book ''Gesundheit: Good 
Health is a Laughing Matter,'' is fascinating, but the film version is 
simply painful, turning mainstream doctors into cardboard villains and 
allowing Williams 110 minutes of insufferable self-indulgence. Robin 
Williams deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ''Good Will Hunting.
'' His performance was tight, controlled and compelling; everything that 
is absent here. Williams is the sort of performer who requires a director 
to reign him in, protecting the actor from his own worst tendencies. In 
''Patch Adams,'' he simply runs amok. </P>
<P>The film pits Adams against paper tigers, presenting traditional doctors 
as anal-retentive, self-righteous prigs. I found the blanket portrayal 
offensive, an insult to the many dedicated, overworked men and women who 
tirelessly devote themselves to quality patient care, often at the 
expense of their own well-being. If you believe this film, Patch was a 
red-nosed missionary, a medical superhero single-handedly fighting 
arrogant, uncaring pill-dispensers in the name of truth, justice and the 
Borscht-belt way. I didn't buy it for a second.</P>
<P>Adams' chief nemesis is Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton), a character with 
absolutely no depth or humanity, given to statements like ''we will 
rigorously and ruthlessly train the humanity out of you and turn you into 
something better.'' He fumes nonstop at Adams, raging over the Patch's 
attempts to ''bring us down to their level.'' Continuing the stereotyping,
 the film presents all nurses as uniformly sympathetic, twinkling angels 
beaten into submission by the evil doctors and all too happy to assist 
Patch in his whoopee-cushion quest. What a load of crap. </P>
<P>The film engages in non-stop emotional manipulation, stretching 
situations to ridiculous lengths to make Patch Adams a comic martyr. 
Watch Patch restore an elderly woman's will to live by plopping her into 
a vat of noodles! See Adams break the shell of a hateful cancer patient, 
bonding with him so completely that the man shoos his wife and children 
away from his deathbed, so he can spend his last moments on Earth with 
Patch! Gaze in amazement as the filmmakers wrap up the movie with a 
hearing in front of a medical board, allowing Williams one more 
opportunity to deliver a maudlin speech.</P>
<P>Or better yet, don't. Avoid this parade of clichéd schmaltz and read the 
book instead. It has to contain more truth than this syrupy disaster. At 
one point, a fellow student turns to Patch Adams and says ''God, you're 
being so self-indulgent!'' If only the director could have had the 
courage to say the same thing to Robin Williams.</P>
