<PRE>HENRY V (1989)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Screen adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays used to be
made since the moment of Lumiere brothers' invention, but
many might get an impression that the number of such films
reached its peak in 1990s, and that the trend continues to
this day. Every now and then we hear about another of
Shakespeare's plays being turned into prestigious Hollywood
production. In many of such cases producers try to overcome
the gap between Bard's 16th Century worldview and modern-day
audience by using the new settings (ranging from 1880s Italy
to 1930s fascist Britain in alternative historical timeline)
or adding new content (gunfights and musical numbers).
Kenneth Branagh, British actor and director who is the best
known Shakespearean filmmaker of today, has also
experimented with new techniques, but his first major
Shakespearean adaptation, 1989 version of HENRY V, is one of
the most faithful and conventional adaptations in the
history of film. Interestingly enough, it was also one of
the best Shakespeare adaptations, at least judging by the
critics who heralded 28-year Branagh as "new Laurence
Olivier" and instantly called his work as "the masterpiece
of British cinema".</P>
<P>The plot is based on the historical play Shakespeare had
written in the earlier phase of his career and begins in
1415, during the lulls in Hundred Years War between England
and France. Young Henry (played by Kenneth Branagh) has
recently ascended English throne and many consider him
inexperienced and still unfit to be the king, mostly due to
his youthful rowdiness and friendship with notorious John
Falstaff (played by Robbie Coltrane). Henry needs to
establish his authority and the best way to do it is
military campaign against France whose weak King (played by
Paul Scofield) wants to deny him the right to succeed him at
the French throne. When jingoistic French Dauphin (played by
Michael Maloney) sends him tennis balls instead mandatory
tribute, Henry would use this diplomatic insult as a pretext
for war and rallying his nation. His army lands in France
and takes the strategic port of Harfleur after prolonged and
bloody siege; this victory is short-lived because Henry's
army, exhausted by diseases, casualties and short on
supplies must retreat towards their stronghold at Calais.
When his route to safety gets blocked by huge French army
Henry refuses French offer to surrender and instead prepares
for the battle. The next day - October 25th 1415 - would
enter military history as well as the name "Agincourt".</P>
<P>HENRY V is probably the most popular of all Shakespeare's
historical plays, and this might be explained with its tone
being somewhat different from the rest of Shakespeare's work
in that period. Instead of complicated and often depressive
tales of endless feudal backstabbing, Shakespeare provided
us with story that provides clear definition between Good
(English) and Bad Guys (French) as well the inspirational
and uplifting story about triumph of human spirit against
overwhelming odds. Strong patriotic and jingoistic overtones
of that play explain why Laurence Olivier used it in order
to make his 1944 film version while Britain was involved in
war against Nazis. Almost half a century later, Kenneth
Branagh didn't feel the need to incite patriotism in his
fellow British, but jingoism of the play nevertheless had
something to do with his choice of the project, although on
more personal level. Branagh probably found many things in
common between himself - young actor directing first major
film - and Henry - young monarch being put to the first
serious test of his reign. So, in many ways, this film has
very personal dimension for its maker, which is usually one
of the elements of true masterpiece.</P>
<P>Aware of the unavoidable comparisons between his and
Olivier's version, Branagh was determined to be as different
as possible. First of all, his version is more faithful to
Shakespeare's text and it is more realistic. Despite the
budget that seems ridiculously small compared with Hollywood
standards, he decided not to turn HENRY V into stage play on
film (like Olivier did in his version). Instead, HENRY V
looks like full-blooded historical spectacle. Branagh also
keeps some elements of Shakespeare's text that Olivier had
felt uncomfortable with in 1944 war-torn Britain - like
episode with English nobles betraying their king, English
soldiers being hanged for stealing from church, and,
finally, Henry himself capturing French town by publicly
making threats that would look gross even to Rwandan war
criminals. Furthermore, the lack of budget actually works to
the film advantage - unburdened with the need to impress the
audience with lavish costumes, thousands of extras or
magnificent vistas, Branagh tries to suspend viewer's
disbelief with naturalism which comes in many forms. For
example, although Shakespeare's poetic language might sound
artificial and out of place when it comes from the mouths of
career soldiers and petty criminals, Branagh's adaptation,
as well as very convincing acting performances, make those
lines quite natural and believable in the context. Branagh,
who lacked budget for extras or technology for CGI, had to
forget about truly spectacular depictions of Agincourt, but
his version compensates the lack of spectacle with intensity
of action. Although their numbers could have hardly filled
the ranks of two soccer teams, players and extras (Branagh
had to use services of his composer Patrick Doyle) manage to
create illusion of terrible slaughter that featured
thousands of men by sheer intensity of bloodlust. Branagh
uses slow- motion in almost the same manor Peckinpah did and
the fighting scenes are very violent despite not being
excessively gory. And after the battle, when victorious
English begin to march out from the battlefield followed by
Patrick Doyle's triumphant soundtrack, their blood-stained
faces and muddy clothes speak volumes about the scope of the
battle - more than thousands of extras would do.</P>
<P>However, the real strength of HENRY V lies in truly superb
acting. Branagh was lucky to assemble great cast, the cräme
de la cräme of the British actors, and, yet those giants,
unlike in similar productions, work together in magnificent
harmony. We have the opportunity to see great variety among
them, sometimes in rather unusual roles, like Dame Judi
Dench who had made a career with roles of tough and powerful
women; here she plays rather common wife of mercenary
soldier. Branagh's regular Michael Maloney gives another
powerful performance as neurotic French Dauphin, while we
also have the opportunity to see young Christian Bale as
Falstaff's Boy. Branagh, being an actor himself, understood
his colleagues very well and almost anyone made great
performance. That includes Emma Thompson who was Branagh's
wife at the time and with whom Branagh shares charming,
although not very necessary seduction scene at the end of
the film. Another Branagh regular, Derek Jacobi plays Chorus
who is there not only to serve as an excuse for low
production values (like in Olivier's version) but also to
put events of the play into historical context.</P>
<P>Great acting, great respect for the source material, great
experience and great talent - these are all ingredients that
made Branagh's HENRY V into one of the best film adaptations
of Shakespeare. Even those who aren't enthusiastic about the
Bard or those who don't like historical dramas would
probably enjoy this superb piece of filmmaking.</P>
<P>(Historical note: While most of period epics tend to
sacrifice authenticity for the sake of drama and spectacle,
HENRY V takes the different route. Battle of Agincourt is
depicted in the way it probably happened, although Branagh
decided to follow Shakespeare rather than historical record
in some details. For example, unlike the film, English army
had more men than French. However, Henry's army was
exhausted by long marches and dysentery, and French had more
of armoured knights in their ranks. Same as in the film, the
battlefield was muddy and that prevented French from using
the numerical advantage of their armoured cavalry; their
knights were forced to fight on foot, making them an easy
target for the favourite English weapon - Welsh longbows
that decimated their ranks. Although a great English
victory, Battle of Agincourt produced more English and less
French casualties than in the figures presented by the film
and Shakespeare's play.)</P>
