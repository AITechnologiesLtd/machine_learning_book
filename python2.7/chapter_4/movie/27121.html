Susan Granger's review of "MISS CONGENIALITY" (Warner Bros.)</PRE>
<P> To bury this lackluster loser in the Christmas rush is folly
but, then again, it was postponed from earlier this year.  Sandra
Bullock plays a cynical, rough-and-tumble FBI agent who, since
childhood, has been a tomboy.  So when a terrorist sends a cryptic
threat that the Miss USA Pageant in San Antonio may be the next
target, her boss (Ernie Hudson) and partner (Benjamin Bratt) rig it
with the pageant director (Candice Bergen) to insert her
behind-the-scenes by going undercover as Miss New Jersey. Problem is:
she's such a klutzy mess that her pompous beauty consultant (Michael
Caine) is aghast: "There's no way I can get this woman - dirty Harriet
- ready in two days. I haven't seen a walk like that since 'Jurassic
Park'!" Nevertheless, within 48 hours, a furious, reluctant Bullock is
"Entering Barbie-town." As for the swimsuit competition, "The last
time I was this naked in public, I was coming out of the uterus," she
wails in her pink Gottex two-piece. Despite occasional laugh lines,
the film fails because producer Bullock, director Donald Petrie and
writers Marc Lawrence, Katie Ford & Caryn Lucas can't make up their
minds whether to satire or be sympathetic to beauty pageants, going
first in one direction, then another. With their perfectly clothed and
coifed contestants, beauty pageants are tacky by nature, so how do you
do one tastefully? Cliches abound - from the ugly duckling-into-swan
routine to mocking the talent show to the eating disorders. Candice
Bergen has the good sense to look uncomfortable, as does hapless
William Shatner, cast as the local Bert Parks. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Miss Congeniality" is a pathetic, misguided
3. Sandra Bullock still has that winning smile but little
else. Someone should give this misguided star/producer some sound
career advice.</P>
