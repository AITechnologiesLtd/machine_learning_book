Grade: A-</P>
<P>Horror films have often proven that Less is More.  Many classics of the genre
have been made on relatively small budgets:  "The Last House on the Left," "The
Night of the Living Dead," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Assault on Precinct
13," "The Hills Have Eyes," "Halloween."  Even "Psycho" could join the list;
Alfred Hitchcock chose to make his first true horror film on a small budget to
limit studio interference.</P>
<P>Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez's low-budget indie "The Blair Witch Project"
is the ultimate expression of the Less is More principle.  It follows this rule
not only in its method of production but also in what it shows-or, more
accurately, doesn't show-the audience.</P>
<P>By now, you've read the words that open "The Blair Witch Project."  They appear
on the posters, on the webpages, and in the trailers:</P>
<PRE>In October of 1994,
three student filmmakers disappeared
in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland,
while shooting a documentary.</PRE>
<P>One year later their footage was found.</P>
<P>The movie the follows is supposed to be the recovered footage that three
college students-Heather, Mike, and Josh (apparently using their real
names)-made as a project for their film class.  Their subject is the local
legend of the Blair Witch, a ghostly figure who lives deep in the Black Hills
Forest and inspires the murders of children.  After some preliminary interviews
with Burkittsville (formerly Blair) residents about the legend, the trio sets
out into the woods armed with a Hi-8 video camera, a CP-16 film camera loaded
with black & white film, DAT sound equipment, and camping gear.</P>
<P>For the first quarter of the film the three students have a lot of fun playing
with their equipment.  They record themselves drinking, film a study of Mike's
sporadic chest hair, and try to catch Heather peeing.  This is all so real that
it's almost tedious except for the ominous knowledge that they won't be coming
back from this trip.</P>
<P>Before long, they're lost in the woods, and the map is gone.  There are
terrifying noises in the night and ritualistic warnings to leave.  Unlike most
teens in horror films, these three would be happy to leave if they could only
find the way back.  </P>
<P>After seeing "The Blair Witch Project," I'm not surprised that recent exit
polls have shown widespread audience dissatisfaction.  It's an experimental
film, and it doesn't offer what the average moviegoer is seeking.  When I saw
the ending I was initially disappointed myself, but my reaction was the result
of mistaken expectations.  </P>
<P>To continue this line of discussion, I have to wander in to SPOILER territory,
kids.  So, you might want to TURN BACK NOW.  </P>
<P>Watching "Blair Witch" can be as frustrating as it is frightening.  What we see
and hear is what would be recorded by three amateur filmmakers out in the
woods.  Most of the movie is shot by Heather with the small video camera which
lacks the definition we usually see in theatrical releases.  Some shots are out
of focus, others are shot in total darkness.  The sounds in the distance are
hard to make out.  Important events happen when the cameras aren't running.</P>
<P>Most frustrating of all for many horror fans, we don't see the witch.  In
"Danse Macabre," Stephen King said that one of the most terrifying monsters can
be "the monster behind the door."  He cautioned, though, that the writer can
never open that door because regardless of how awful the actual monster is, the
reader was expecting something worse.  However, the recent reactions to "Blair
Witch" suggest that not opening the door may leave the audience just as
disappointed, especially in a visual medium like film.</P>
<P>So, where do I get off giving it an A-?  Partly because I admire its audacity. 
Making a movie that suggests rather than shows takes guts.  The choice to film
most of the movie with a small camcorder is not only brave but also clever; in
part, "Blair Witch" is an examination of the technology that liberates
creativity (with video cameras widely available, almost anybody can make a
movie) but also obscures as much as it reveals (details in the movie's
low-definition video images are difficult to decipher).</P>
<P>>From Blair Witch's internet promotion, I expected a movie with the raw
intensity and gut-wrenching imagery of  "The Last House on the Left" or "The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre."  However, that's not what "Blair Witch" offers.  It
has only the slightest touch of gore and violence.  However, "Blair Witch"
still packs a punch-it's just that its intensity lies in the subtle way it
works on the viewer's mind rather than in horrific images.  While I was
watching the movie, I did not think it had affected me at all, but when I got
home I turned on the lights in every room.  The effect lasted until the next
night.  An really good horror film doesn't just scare you; it crawls inside
your head and rearranges the wiring.</P>
<P>One last aspect of interest:  "The Blair Witch Project" takes a step toward the
interactive multimedia that will doubtless be the dominant artform of the next
century.  It's website <<A HREF="http://www.blairwitch.com/>">http://www.blairwitch.com/></A> takes the position that all
of the events depicted in the film are true and expands on the mythology of the
Blair Witch legend and on the search for the missing filmmakers.  It offers
photos of and interviews with characters who don't appear in the film and even
Real Video of television coverage of the search.  The mythology will be further
explored in a television documentary ("The Curse of the Blair Witch" on the
Sci-Fi Channel), a "true crime" book, and a comic book.  In other words, the
movie is only part of a larger work.  That is a situation quite different from
the familiar pattern of a movie based on a novel or a comic book adaptation of
a movie; those "tie-ins" retell the same story in a different format.  Expect
to see more movie/book/web/video projects which ask the audience to explore
different forms of media to get the whole story and which give the viewer more
choice in how to conduct that exploration.</P>
