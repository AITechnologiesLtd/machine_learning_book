<PRE>THE TAILOR OF PANAMA
RATING: 7/10</PRE>

<P>PLOT:
A disgraced British spy is sent to Panama to dig up some dirt on the latest
governmental regime. He quickly strikes a deal with a debt-ridden tailor, by
which money would be exchanged for information that the tailor overhears
from his distinguished clientele. But how much of what the tailor is saying
is actually true and how far will this information ultimately go? See the
movie for more of those details...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Pierce Brosnan playing a British spy? Say it ain't so! Poor guy, I hope that
he does eventually work his way out of this typecast-from-hell role, but 007
aside, let's break this puppy down. I didn't know anything about this movie
going in, and seeing it under the naked eye was quite refreshing indeed. I'm
generally interested in most films which offer insight into different
countries, different religions, cultures, and this one puts you right in the
thick of things down in Panama. The story is intriguing, the performances,
nicely done on the whole, and the conclusion, most fascinating and hilarious
to see wind down. On the negative tip, the film did feel a little redundant
at about the halfway point (although it picked up near the end), has a
couple of underdeveloped characters, notably Jamie Lee Curtis, who felt more
like window dressing (Can someone please light Ms. Curtis' left boob? Okay,
action!), and didn't do much for Brosnan's attempt to stretch his acting
muscles away from his staple character, but all in all, the negatives
weren't all that bad.</P>
<P>In fact, on the whole, the film was actually quite amusing. And despite it
being set more as a "drama" per se, the film ultimately turns into a major
<wink-wink> type of flick, as the lies pack onto the facades, the bribes
onto the blackmailings, until almost no one really knows what end is up
anymore. There's also a re-occurring conscience character who pops in and
out from time to time, and keeps things light-hearted. But you have to go in
knowing that this film does not have any action, elongated car chases or
fistfights. It's a political drama, with some tense moments, lots of
intrigue, lots of maneuvering about, some ironic humor and generally
entertaining results. I'd also have to give a major nod to its star,
Geoffrey Rush, who plays the sap trapped in the middle of all of this
international manipulation (but does he know it?) very well. It was funny to
see him squirm from scene to scene, and he reminded me a lot of William H.
Macy's Oscar nominated character from FARGO. Another great showing by Rush!
In fact, the whole relationship between the disgraced spy and the shaky
tailor was the cornerstone of the film, as each man so obviously tried to
overcome the failures of their respective pasts.</P>
<P>So if politics and the spy-game interest you in the least, this film should
definitely delight you to some extent. But even if you're just looking for a
pretty original story, told via certain familiar routes, and an ultimately
fascinating denouement, you should also check this trickster out. The
"humor" might not be appreciated by everyone, since it really isn't an "in
your face" type of funny, but as a whole, I think that the film develops
enough successful elements to satisfy most film fans.</P>

<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Rush's son in this movie is played by Daniel Radcliffe, a name which we will
be all too familiar to us in a few months, as he's to play the lead
character in the highly anticipated HARRY POTTER movie. Rush's daughter in
the film is played by one Lola Boorman. The director's name is John Boorman.
Hello!?
This movie is based on the 1996 novel by John le Carre, who also co-wrote
and executive produced this project.
Pay close attention and you will note several in-jokes in this movie,
including one in which Rush says to a client, "That was Mr. Connery's
choice", an obvious nod to Sean Connery, the actor who played James Bond
years before Pierce took over the lead. Brosnan also makes two references to
other movies, including CASABLANCA and THE FULL MONTY.
This film was shot entirely on location in Panama.</P>
