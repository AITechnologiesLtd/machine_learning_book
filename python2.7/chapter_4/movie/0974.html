<PRE>                                    EATING
                         A film review by Jon Newman
                          Copyright 1991 Jon Newman</PRE>
<P>    Director Henry Jaglom's new film EATING has the voyeuristic
attraction of spying on a group therapy session.  On the surface, the
scene of this film is a large birthday party in (where else?) southern
California, where 38 women gather to celebrate the birthdays of Helene
(turning 40), Kate (30) and Sadie (50).  However, much of the film
centers on the deeply personal revelations of these women concerning
their problems with food, men and body image.  As the film progresses,
we see more and more how the various problems of these apparently
independent and successful women express themselves in an obsession with
food, thinness and dieting.</P>
<P>    One of these women is Martine, a French television documentary
maker, played convincingly by Nelly Allard.  Martine is ostensibly
producing a documentary about Southern California lifestyles, but her
work actually centers on women and food.  This "play within a play"
mechanism is contrived, but it produces some of the most memorable
moments of the film.  EATING is sprinkled with short cutaways and
collages from this woman's videocamera, as the women at the party
describe the formative moments of their relationship with food.</P>
<P>    I will not try to list all of the notable performances in this film,
since every one of the actresses, even the nameless bit players, has her
moment of revelation, many in front of Martine's videocamera.  Director
Henry Jaglom obviously establishes a rapport with these women, and the
portrayals come across as absolutely authentic.  I will however, single
out two performances.  Gwen Welles plays the neurotic and unsympathetic
Sophie, whose jealousy of her successful (and, above all, thin) friends
leads her to viciously attack and manipulate her closest friend Helene.
And Frances Bergen (Candice's mother) plays Helene's mother, perhaps the
only character who is not obsessed with food, and who tries to confront
various other characters with their neurotic behavior.</P>
<P>    One memorable scene:  The cutting of the birthday cake, where slices
of birthday cake are passed endlessly around the room as if they were
time bombs.</P>
<P>    My favorite line:  "I guess I'm still looking for a man who will
excite me as much as a baked potato."</P>
<P>    While EATING does center on the topic of eating disorders, it is
completely unlike those preachy television docudramas which isolate
specific problems in an otherwise Leave it To Beaver world.  EATING
presents eating disorders with both humor and pathos, as a symptom of
the problems women face in affluent Western society.</P>
<P>    I strongly recommend EATING to anyone who can put up with "talky"
films.  In my opinion, this may be the best film to hit the arthouse
scene since JESUS OF MONTREAL.</P>
