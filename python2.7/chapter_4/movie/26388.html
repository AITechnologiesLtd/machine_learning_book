<P>Susan Granger's review of "DANCER IN THE DARK" (Fine Line Features)</P>
<P>   Love it or hate it, you gotta admire its audacity!  Danish
director Lars von Trier who, back in 1995, co-authored the Dogma
manifesto, demanding that cinema be purified of tricks and illusions
and go back-to-basics, has come up with a bizarre homage to the
Hollywood musical. Making her film debut, the Icelandic pop singer
Bjork plays Selma, a Czech immigrant working at a factory in the
Pacific Northwest in the 1960s. An avid admirer of American musicals,
she fantasizes song-and-dance routines as she goes about her
depressing daily existence. It's her "emotional landscape." One
complication: because of a congenital condition, she's also going
blind, as will her 12 year-old son (Vladica Kostic) if she cannot
raise the money for surgery to save his sight. Which makes her lyrics,
"I've seen it all. There's nothing left to see," particularly
poignant. Catherine Deneuve is a supportive co-worker and Peter
Stromare is a besotted suitor but, when a treacherous neighbor (David
Morse) steals her stash of cash, Selma panics, commits a grotesque
crime and faces a bleak future. Like Emily Watson in "Breaking the
Waves," Bjork is a compelling, elfin creature playing a stubborn
child/woman trapped in an irrational paradox of reality versus
fantasy. In addition, of course, Bjork composed the music. Curiously,
von Trier contradicts his own Dogma purity principles by creating an
improbable, deliberately stylized film using not only 100 cameras in a
dance sequence but also recorded music to which Bjork lip-synchs; I've
heard there are 110 tracks in every song. Winner of the Golden Palm at
the Cannes Film Festival, on the Granger Movie Gauge, "Dancer in the
Dark" is a fascinating but, ultimately, frustrating 7. It's a musical
melodrama that's blatantly manipulative in its overt sentimentality.</P>
