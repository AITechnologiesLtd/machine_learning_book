<P>     Though closer to consistently amusing than non-stop, fall-down fun-
ny, the first family film from Dreamworks is a slight delight.  Nathan
Lane and British comic Lee Evans play a pair of bickering, bumbling
brothers, trying to rid a prized old mansion of a mouse.  A very *smart*
mouse.  Slapstick ensues (vacuum versus sewage line, lit match versus
natural gas, etc.), but not nearly as much as the ads suggest.  (Nor as
hilarious as expected, either.  Have such shenanigans become too common-
place, after three HOME ALONE movies?)  Significant screen time is also
devoted to the rodent's POV, in several FX-intensive sequences set in-
side the walls of this old house.  Younger kids *may* grow restless dur-
ing the film's talkier bits, such as the brothers' ongoing efforts to
sell the ancient (but fully functioning) string factory that they also
inherited from their recently deceased father (William Hickey, looking
delightfully decrepit in his final screen role).  That said, whatever
the wee ones miss in dialogue, the exceptional visuals should still keep
them spellbound.  (My favorite, next to the sight of Lane's exaggerated
eyebrows, is the one-two punch of Phedon Papamichael's dark photography
and Linda DeScenna's goofy-Gothic production design.  We're talkin' Tim
Burton territory, here.)  And, parents, be forewarned about the City
Pound scenes, where Laurel and Hardy look to snatch "one mean pussy."
After the kids see *those* conditions, you'll never be able to get rid
of another pet again.  Get me my Gouda.</P>
