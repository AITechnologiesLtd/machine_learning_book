<PRE>                                    JUDE
                       A film review by P-M Agapow
                        Copyright 1996 P-M Agapow</PRE>
<P>Adapted from the classic Thomas Hardy novel "Jude the Obscure":
In the late 19th century young Jude Fawley (Eccleston) sets his
mind upon becoming a scholar.  However his working class
background and two romances he is doomed to continually revisit -
first with Arabella (Griffiths), an earthy working girl, and
later with his cousin Sue (Winslet), a rebellious free spirit, -
drag him away from this dream.</P>
<P>Two admissions to start with: (1) Having never read the Hardy
novel, I cannot vouch for how close this is to the original.
Comments in the publicity and the fact that Eccleston appears on
the movie poster wearing a beard that he never has during the
movie makes me suspect there may be wild divergences.  (2) "Jude"
is not a terrible movie.  It is just terribly disappointing.</P>
<P>Ready for four hours of unmitigated misery? This is it.
Admittedly the running-time is closer to two hours - it just
feels longer - but "Jude" is an movie looking for a statement to
make.  Despite its protests that it weighs the questions of
dreams versus realities and destiny versus chance, "Jude" the
movie is like the life of its eponymous character: one long
disappointment.  Jude and Sue, his companion in misery for most
of the film, do not so much rage against injustices as just lie
down and let themselves be kicked to death.  We do not need them
to win, but to simply grind them down without respite is
pointless.  "Jude" has little emotion or message invested in it.</P>
<P>Conversely there is merit. After a series of period movies
that stepped straight out of a postcard (or haberdashery), "Jude"
looks like a un-glamorous portrayal of its times, from the torn
edges of Jude's coat to the mud-splattered streets.  Eccleston,
looking almost anatomically gaunt, is a strangely charming lead
with a subdued natural acting style.  When he finally weeps at
his misfortunes, his pain is palpable.  The supporting actors
give appealing performances, although Winslet is not nearly as
luminous as she is in every other film she appears in.  There is
a nicely eerie soundtrack and the director shows a keen eye for
capturing scenes from the bleak distances of farmland to the
crowded interiors of urband gaslight.</P>
<P>But the bottom line is - why see a film that has nothing to
say?  What it really lacks is a sense of not pace but urgency, an
sense that it is going somewhere or say something.  Put it this
way - if you were watching this one on TV, after a hour you'd be
channel-surfing between tragedies.  [*/misfire] and a ski holiday
without snow on the Sid and Nancy scale.</P>
