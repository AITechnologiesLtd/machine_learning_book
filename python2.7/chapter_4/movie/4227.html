<P>     In COPYCAT, a thriller about a serial killer, there are two
Hunters :  San Francisco police detective M.J.  Monahan, played by Holly
Hunter, and criminal psychologist Sigourney Weaver, whose "nom de film"
is Helen Hunter.  In their own ways, they're both hunting the murderer.</P>
<P>     While Helen Hunter is delivering a lecture on serial killers, she
sees in the audience a man making a menacing gesture at her.  He is
Darryl Lee, in whose trial Helen had testified.  The part is played by
musician Harry Connick, made-up as a chilling low-life with terrible
teeth.  Minutes later, in the washroom, through a satanical but
preposterous scheme, he kills the cop guarding Weaver and hangs the
lady.  How Connick got there, carried, set up and used his equipment and
why Weaver did not die, are mysteries.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, this opening is taut and really scary.  Indeed, so
frightened is Helen that when we cut to thirteen months later, we learn
that she had a breakdown, became agoraphobic, lives in paranoid panic,
pops pills, drinks cognac and plays Italian operas.  Cloistered in her
ritzy apartment, she sees only one human, her gay companion-employee.
All other contacts with the world are through her several TV monitors
and the computers that get her on the Internet.</P>
<P>     M.J. and sidekick Ruben (Dermot Mulroney) suspect that a series of
murders in San Francisco are related.  Getting suggestions in anonymous
calls soon traced to Helen, the detectives, not without difficulty,
visit the psychologist and convince her to help.  She has figured out
that the murderer is replicating the methods of famous serial killers
such as the Son of  Sam, Jeffrey Dahmer, the Boston Strangler, the
Hillside Strangler and others.</P>
<P>     The hunters hunt but also become the hunted in a convoluted plot.
Though not new, the twist would still be serviceable were it not for
its major improbabilities, lacunae, arbitrary editing, telegraphed
developments.  Worse, it goes into many of the cliches of the genre, so
that "copycat" describes the film's operating procedure as well as the
killer's.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT is an alternating mix of  acceptable logic and of
incoherence, the latter predominating.  M.J. is likable, has impressive
professional skills but is not terribly expressive.  Helen is pitiable,
has impressive professional skills but is not terribly expressive.  The
serial killer has unlikely skills of divination and impressive
techniques, including mastery of computers.  He uses these to terrorize
Helen or taunt the police.  Many of his other means are also
unbelievable, including the supply of hardware and electronics he
always seems to have on hand.</P>
<P>     He is revealed in sketchy, disconnected bits that past a certain
point are more confusing than interesting.  He is also the alter ego of
the Harry Connick character who is shown in prison and used in ways
that further obfuscate matters.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT alternates between the unexplained, which is a bad thing,
and the deja vu, which occasionally provides chills to audiences well
trained in suspense devices.  When Helen. for a change, smiles, you
suspect danger.  When she looks into her clothes closet, you expect
something horrible to be there.  When she takes a shower, you think of
PSYCHO.  Whether or not  anything happens, those are derivative tricks
and manipulations.</P>
<P>     A larger flaw is the non-development of  characters.  Some of the
best examples of real people are in the works of  Alfred Hitchcock.
His thrillers were generally complicated, but with "clean" lines.
Hitchcock knew when to say "enough" to twists and let you concentrate
on the suspense rather than worry about what's going on.  He had
humor.  His protagonists were well-rounded--not only in the more
"serious" thrillers where there is ongoing analysis of characters (cf.
SHADOW OF A DOUBT, ROPE, VERTIGO, etc.) but in lighter ones too.</P>
<P>     In NORTH BY NORTHWEST, hero Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) comes
through as a complete person, via his behavior, his reactions, his
talks with his mother, his amorous advances, his quips ... down to his
bookmatch cover that spells R.O.T. ("the O stands for nothing").  Or to
take the case of  a  most clever classic thriller, the French
DIABOLIQUE, the beautifully laid-on character traits always
reinforce  the twists and the surprises, and vice versa.</P>
<P>     Compared to such accomplishments COPYCAT is weak.  Its killer
remains a cipher.  M.J. is a dedicated, serious, unflirtatious,
businesslike cop, but that's about all.  Helen gets a few more touches,
like her long sexual frustration, but that's not enough.</P>
<P>     Too much gimmickry and elliptical plotting--130 long minutes of
it--overtakes the movie.  It does have its moments, but too few of
them.  It also has as silly and absurd an ending as the start was
good.  Note how, when the killer gets to his Connick-copycat number,
M.J. does not act immediately as any alert cop would.  All the while
the entire audience is two steps ahead of her.</P>
