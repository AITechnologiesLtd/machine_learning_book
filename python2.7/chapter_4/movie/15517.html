<PRE>BELOVED
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The movie Beloved is rather like it's title character:  unusual,
disorienting and not quite what you'd expect.  However, that's not to
say that the film isn't good (which it is), but rather that it's a
difficult beast to classify.  It's eerily supernatural, yet with an
earthy realism.  It's intimate in scale, and yet epic in scope.</P>
<P>Oprah Winfrey stars as Sethe, a woman who ran away from slavery eighteen
years earlier, and now lives on the outskirts on Cincinnati.  She lives
with her antisocial daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise), as well as a
mysterious poltergeist, in their house at 124 Bluestone Road.</P>
<P>Yes, you read that right, "poltergeist".  Their house is haunted.  And
while the Amityville-goings-on might scare away anyone with common
sense, Sethe is simply tired of running.  Besides, the spirit which
shakes their house and squeezes their dog isn't evil..."just sad".</P>
<P>But things are stirred up by the arrival of two visitors.  The first is
Paul D (Danny Glover), a weary man who knew Sethe when they were both
slaves at the Sweet Home Plantation.  The second is more mysterious, an
asthmatic girl (Thandie Newton) who moves like an epileptic puppet and
calls herself "Beloved" in a croaking voice.</P>
<P>Jonathan Demme directs this adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel with a
hallucinatory flair.  Some scenes are oversaturated, others faded.
Colors glow, the angles shift... it's almost as if the camera is
possessed, as well as the house.  Yet, through it all, we are able to
connect and bond with the characters, and experience the horrors and
triumphs of their story.</P>
<P>Oprah Winfrey could have her pick of roles, and certainly could have
picked a more glamorous one than Sethe, but it would have been hard to
find a stronger character. Wounded with scars deeper than the welts on
her back, Sethe is a complex, multilayered character.  Many an actress
might have stumbled in the role, but Oprah is up to the challenge, and
delivers Sethe's many facets.</P>
<P>Danny Glover isn't as lucky.  His Paul D is as downtrodden as Sethe, but
not as nuanced. We learn little about him as the film progresses, and,
eventually, he is just cast aside.  We see his external feelings towards
Sethe, Beloved and Denver, but rarely his motivations.</P>
<P>Thandie Newton is appropriately creepy and charming in the role of
Beloved.  Though, even at the end of the film, many things about her
remain a mystery, it is a fascinating character, and a challenging
role.  Kimberly Elise's Denver is less showy, but no less well acted.
She is able to hold her own against all the otherworldly happenings in
her house...just not ready to face the real world.</P>
<P>The storyline of Beloved is complex, but not convoluted.  It does
require that you pay attention, however.  An ill-timed bathroom run
during this 3-hour movie may mean you'll be missing the keystone to the
whole puzzle.  Be warned.</P>
<P>Perhaps the best adjective to describe Beloved is "haunting".  Just as
Sethe and Paul D are haunted by the past, and just as 124 Bluestone Road
is haunted...so too, you'll be haunted by Beloved.</P>
