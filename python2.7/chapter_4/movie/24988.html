<P>   People who dug Mary Harron's movie "American Psycho"
may have enjoyed the witty take on violence or 
the satiric edge by which the story condemned the rampant
yuppie materialism of the 1980s.  Some of us who lived
through the seventies and eighties look nostalgically at the
unique era of the early 1970s when not moneyk, but hippies,
love and hallucinogenic drugs were the fashion of the times. 
We forget the suffering and waste of that interval, the drug-
induced pain that led to the downfall of the epoch of peace
and love.  Alison Maclean remembers, as does Denis
Johnson who wrote the best-selling episodic novel from which
the movie "Jesus' Son" is adapted.  </P>
<P>   "Jesus' Son" is about losers.  The story hones in on one
particular screw-up who earned the nickname FH from those
who came into contact with him.  As FH, the roguishly
handsome Billy Crudup--last seen with the dazzling Jennifer
Connelly in the critically mixed "Waking the Dead"--
dominates every scene of this metaphoric and literal road trip
that takes him from Iowa to Phoenix and takes his mind from
a device that he seems to have mislaid to a credible
rehabilitation.  FH drifts from youthful destructiveness to
mature redemption when he learns compassion for those in
worse shape than he.</P>
<P>   The story is narrated by FH in the non-linear mode
that we'd expect of a person who might be sitting next to you
on a barstool in an alcoholic haze, relating incidents from the
present time to, say, five years ago, moving up a couple of
years, then back again, and finally returning to the present. 
Filled with the exaggerations you'd expect from such a barfly
and with the occasional exploiting of the surreal, "Jesus' Son"
unfolds the story of a man whose life is redeemed partly by
his love for Michelle (Samantha Morton), a heroin addicted
woman desperate for love, and ultimately by a job he takes in
a home for assisted living.  </P>
<P>   Like any road movie, "Jesus' Son" takes its protagonist
through a series of adventures with bizarre characters,
allowing him to act out in his own peculiar way. In each case
he works to save the people he meets but ends up mimicking
the functioning of these losers, and failing because his
competence takes a back seat to his conviction.  The funniest
scene takes place in a hospital where he takes a barely
defined job and runs into an orderly, Georgie (Jack Black),
who boosts his meager salary by helping himself to
perks--like the pharmacy closet which is stacked with pills
that make the man even zanier than he is in real life. 
(Recall, if you will, Jack Black's role as a record
salesman in Stephen Frears' "High Fidelity" and you get the
picture.)  He meets and hangs out for a while with a
depressed divorcee, Wayne (Denis Leary), whose idea of
revenge is to destroy his own home and extract the copper
wiring for re-sale.   In a small role, Greg Germann performs
as Dr. Shamis, whose incompetence reflects FH's and is the
physician we all know, while Dennis Hopper turns in a
poignant role as Bill, who winds up in a nursing home after
being shot in the face by his latest wife.</P>
<P>   Samantha Morton, who most effectively played the role of a
mute woman in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown," is
somehow less productive this time around, perhaps because
her addiction to shooting up lacks the subtlety of her guise in
the Woody Allen work, but as FH's first genuine love, she
engenders in her man the desire to reclaim someone outside
of himself--while Mira (Holly Hunter) finishes the job of saving
FH from his feelings of emptiness . </P>
<P>   Whereas Billy Crudup as Franklin Pierce in "Waking the
Dead" is a man climbing the career ladder to an eventual
Senate seat, this time around he plays to type but as the
more prosaic guy who is just trying to get his act together
and live like all the normal people he assumes are leading
happy lives with their families. In his relationship with the only
person who remains with him spiritually throughout the film,
Michelle, he reminds us of yet another of the many recent
films about drug and alcohol addiction, Mike Figgis's "Leaving
Las Vegas," even more than it does about those more
ostensibly about the drug scene such as "Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas," "Trainspotting," and, most recently, "Groove."  
Alison Maclean's treatment of this lost Everyman inspires
hope in all of us, making effective use of sometimes
outrageous humor while simultaneously shunning cheap
sentimentalism.</P>
