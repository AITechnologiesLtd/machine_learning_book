<P>     The story is situated in the Danish National Hospital
(Rigshospitalet) a.k.a. The Kingdom (Riget).  The site was originally a
bleach pond where clothes were damped and laid out in the sun to
bleach, causing the moor to be constantly shrouded in fog.  Now the
Hospital is located were the pond used to be, with all its doctors,
scientists and technology, defining life so superstition never again
will shake believe in science.  But perhaps this arrogance and the
consistent denial of the spiritual has been too much.  The cold and
moisture have returned and the solid and fashionable building has begun
to show signs of fatigue.  The gate to the Kingdom has begun to
reopen.</P>
<P>     This is how the new thriller from Lars von Trier opens.
Originally THE KINGDOM was a television series in four parts, but
simultaneously it has now been released as a movie.  One of the main
characters is mrs.  Drusse, a professional patient and clairvoyant, who
hears the cry of a little girl ghost in the corridors of the Hospital.
Her task is to reveal the plot of the film.  Whenever she is
discharged, she invents a new disease to be hospitalized so she can
explore the mystery.  Her contrast is Dr. Helmer, chief surgeon and a
stupid bastard who eventually ends up worshipping the occult area, as
the Zombie culture is normally regarded.  This is one of the
characteristics in Lars' movies: to blend scientific research and
metaphysics, science and superstition, the exact and the occult.</P>
<P>     The inspiration from "Twin Peaks" is turned from fire into water
steaming from the broken pipes in the basement parking lot.  The
strength in this story is the small anecdotes--for example, the medical
student who can't stand the sight of blood, but spend the time on duty
in the sleep-laboratory by watching a horrible bloody movie on VCR.
There are many references to other pictures, Ridley Scott having
provided material to some of the spiritualistic scenes.</P>
<P>     Eventually the story reaches its climax in the end where the
Minister of Health visits the hospital and all the spirits are led
loose.  The series reached almost cult status in Denmark: while it was
running in December, the streets were almost empty when a new episode
was shown.  Everywhere people were discussing the latest development in
the series, more often than to debate the weather.  It will be exiting
to see the promised sequel, and how the rest of the world will welcome
this black-humoured thriller.</P>
