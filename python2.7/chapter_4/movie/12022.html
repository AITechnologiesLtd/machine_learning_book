<P>    Were it not that we already had seen films like THE KILLING FIELDS, to
which this one will always be compared, this would have been considered a
good film.</P>
<P>    As it is, this film comes off like another one of the same, and its
political edge is lost.  Had it been done ten to fifteen years ago, it may
have been considered a lot better.</P>
<P>    This is the story of an American tourist, or visitor, that gets caught
up in the political changes in Burma in 1988, when the communist government
was taking charge of the country through force.  And most of the foreigners
were trapped inside and efforts were made to make their life difficult.  The
leading character, an American, is having problems and is finding it
difficult to get out of the country, and with the help of her servants, and
their friends, she finally makes it.</P>
<P>    Although this film is not as poignant and powerful as the film it
copies, it manages to hold its own.  It does have some nice acting along the
way, Patricia Arquette, probably being the weakest of the lot, but still not
bad.  As is common in all other John Boorman films, both the music and the
cinematography are nicely done, and well designed coupled with odd camera
angles to add a larger feeling that something, someone is trying so hard to
escape, not only a political situation but a personal one as well, which is
the larger issue in this film.  Thus it's title.</P>
