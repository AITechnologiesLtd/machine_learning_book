<P>     For all the talk about how safe and predictable Hollywood film-making
has become in recent years (and well-deserved talk it has been), I think
the independents have been getting a bit lazy as well.  The big studios
may try to duplicate the formulas of their blockbusters, but the small
distributors are just as eager to duplicate the successes within their own
ranks, which is why you see a lot of two kinds of film at your local art
house:  talky generational relationship comedies, and gritty, violent
capers.  Many cinephiles find the former particularly annoying, but I have
grown more tired of the attitude-heavy but substance-light films which
worship at the altar of Tarantino and turn out sour garbage like THINGS TO
DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.  THE BIG SQUEEZE is a nice idea for a spin
on that trend, an unspectacular but surprisingly sunny film noir -- a film
blanc, if you will.</P>
<P>     Set in Los Angeles' low-rent Highland Park neighborhood, THE BIG
SQUEEZE is the story of Tanya Mulhill (Lara Flynn Boyle), a bartender
forced to work long hours to support her husband Henry (Luca Bercovici), a
former minor league baseball star crippled by a knee injury a few years
earlier.  Tanya is content to watch her tips go to the local mission where
Henry prays for a miracle to restore his knee, until she learns that Henry
has been hiding away a $130,000 insurance settlement.  When Henry refuses
to share the wealth, Tanya asks for help from Benny O'Malley (Peter
Dobson), a con man who has been frequenting the bar.  Together they hatch
a plan to separate Henry from his money, employing Jesse (Danny Nucci), a
bar regular with a crush on Tanya, as well as a few well-planted magnolia
trees and the promise of a miracle.</P>
<P>     I suppose that on a basic plot level not much separates THE BIG
SQUEEZE from those same gritty, violent capers I criticized en masse.  It
includes sex, greed, double-crosses and characters with a certain
in-your-face quirkiness, and all have an uncomfortable familiarity.  What
director and writer Marcus DeLeon understands is that a change in tone can
make for an entirely different story, and THE BIG SQUEEZE is a film which
always seems to be more inviting than ominous -- Jacques Haitkin's
cinematography is bright and cheery most of the time, Mark Mothersbaugh
provides a bouncy score, and the characters are generally likeable.
DeLeon takes the substance of a dark crime drama, paints it and throws up
some curtains, and suddenly finds himself with a comedy on his hands.</P>
<P>     That little trick impressed me, and it is characteristic of the minor
pleasures which allow THE BIG SQUEEZE to overcome its familiar story arc
and deliberate pacing.  Peter Dobson's Benny is shown from the beginning
as a con artist whose efforts have a tendency to backfire, making his the
cocky demeanor of a losing gambler convinced that his luck is just about
to change.  Henry is also an intriguing character, a man whose pose at
piety masks a profound selfishness and self-obsession; it is a great gag
when Henry believes he is making an amazing contribution to the Church by
parting with his California League championship ring.  Part of what makes
THE BIG SQUEEZE fun to watch is that Benny's plan is based on completely
mistaken assumptions about the other people involved -- neither Tanya nor
Jesse is as obsessed with the money as he is, and Henry may actually be
_more_ obsessed with it.</P>
<P>     I wish DeLeon had been content with a silly subversion of noir
conventions, because his attempts at more thematic depth fall somewhat
flat.  That is partly the result of a listless performance by Lara Flynn
Boyle, who gives Tanya a flaccid personality which doesn't seem to warrant
so much fascination by so many men.  Tanya's realization of what she wants
from life is one of several sub-texts in THE BIG SQUEEZE which are lost in
the shuffle, and there is a somewhat disconcerting cynicism to DeLeon's
rationalization of the opportunistic exploitation of religious faith.  But
for all its unevenness, THE BIG SQUEEZE provides an unexpected twist to a
genre in which guns and gloom generally carry the day.  In this case, it
is a pleasant surprise to find not a single bullet fired, and every
character experiencing some kind of happy ending.  Apparently DeLeon
prefers to make love, not noir.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 anti-noir movements:  6.</PRE>
