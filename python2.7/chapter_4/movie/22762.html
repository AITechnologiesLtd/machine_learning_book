<P>The most impressive part of The Talented Mr. Ripley isn't Matt Damon's
excellent performance or the picturesque Italian scenery, but rather
the abnormally disturbing chills that commence running down your spine
at the 10-minute juncture of the two-hour-plus film.</P>
<P>Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) is a playboy in the truest of senses. He
lives in Italy off of the allowance his father provides, dates a
beautiful girl named Marge Sherwood (Academy Award Winner Gwyneth
Paltrow) and cheats on her constantly. But Dickie's father, Herbert
(James Rebhorn), isn't blind to his son's laziness and decides to do
something about it when he meets Tom Ripley (Matt Damon). The meeting
is really just a big misunderstanding, since Tom is wearing a borrowed
Princeton jacket that leads Herbert to assume he was Dickie's
classmate. Before long, Tom is given $1000 (a lot of money in the
1950's setting) to find Dickie in Italy and bring him back to his
father.  Although the film's trailer has no qualms about giving away
almost every twist and turn of the movie, I won't. I will only reveal
that Ripley is indeed talented and "would rather be a fake somebody
than a real nobody."  Dickie Greenleaf is a somebody.</P>
<P>One of the unnecessary characters in the film is Meredith Logue (Cate
Blanchett). Meredith is a playgirl who shuns her family's name and
money but clearly couldn't survive without the socialite status that
both provide.  She wanders in and out of the plot according to when it
is convenient to have her around and could be edited out altogether in
favor of a shorter and more concise film. The only drawback to
splicing Meredith away is that Cate Blanchett gives a remarkable
performance that over-shadows the more prominent Gwyenth Paltrow. This
is most ironic since Paltrow stole Blanchett's much deserved Best
Actress Oscar for Elizabeth when she won for her mediocre-at-best
performance in Shakespeare in Love.</P>
<P>The other standout is Matt Damon who confirms his status as one of the
finer up-and-coming actors with Good Will Hunting, Rounders, Saving
Private Ryan and now this under his belt. He makes Ripley an eerie and
frightening character while, at the same time, maintaining a sort of
dorky persona and managing to not overdue some rather subtle
homosexual themes. His character's success at becoming someone he
isn't is half due to his talent and half due to his luck. Damon smirks
just the right way when he catches a serendipitous break and uses
these fortunes to make the character all the more eerie and the film
all the more disturbing.</P>
<P>The Talented Mr. Ripley beautifully captures the essence of Italy. The
film's remarkable cinematography should go head-to-head with Anna and
the King on Oscar night. Scenes in Venice's St. Marx Square, Rome's
Piazza di Spagna (Spanish Steps) and other Italian landmarks are
magnificently shot and even compete with the actors onscreen for
attention.</P>
<P>The movie has many similarities to F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great
Gatsby.  Not the least of which is the concept of someone who obtains
money through illegitimate means by trying to be someone they're
not. This holds true of both Tom Ripley and Dickie here. The lavish
socialite lifestyles portrayed are similar and so is the deep, dark
secrets that just about everyone has.  Just don't confuse yourself,
The Talented Mr. Ripley may be good, but if you expect something on
par with The Great Gatsby, you will be sorely disappointed.</P>
