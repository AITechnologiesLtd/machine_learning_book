<P>Synopsis: An unscrupulous college professor (Tim Curry) cons several of 
his students -- many of them survivors (and otherwise) of the first "Scary 
Movie" -- into spending the night at "Hell House". Cindy (Faris) and 
friends have to contend with an angry ghost, a demonic cat, a disturbing 
caretaker, and cheezy parodies of everything from "Poltergeist" to "The 
Weakest Link"...</P>
<P>Review: "Scary Movie" may have been the climax of the gross-out comedy -- 
the last hilarious, disgusting hurrah of a genre which seems to have worn 
out its welcome on the big screen. "Scary Movie 2" is like an echo of its 
predecessor: not as funny nor as vomit-inducing, but still possessed of 
some of the qualities that made the original so entertaining. The main 
problem seems to be that it lacks confidence in the very subject material 
it's lampooning. Whereas the first installment wormed considerable mileage 
out of parodying slasher flicks like "Scream", the sequel goes after the 
older genre of the haunted house movie. And even though its main targets 
include such recent fare as the 1999 remake of "The Haunting", it seems 
the small army of scriptwriters were not convinced that their target 
audience of teen boys would be familiar with most examples of the genre. 
As a result, numerous unrelated jokes are haphazardly strewn throughout 
the proceedings, making "Scary Movie 2" feel disconnected and cobbled 
together, a loose panoply of brief set pieces that are knocked down as 
quickly as they're set up. There are still some funny bits (especially the 
opening "Exorcist" rip), but the picture consequently builds little 
momentum. The filmmakers should realise now that the well is dry, and keep 
to the promise made in the tagline for the first "Scary Movie": no sequel.</P>
