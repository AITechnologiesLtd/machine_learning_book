Rated R</P>
<P>Oliver Stone's latest effort is officially a "sports movie." You know the
type: a misfit team or player battles through adversity and comes out on top
in the end. "Any Given Sunday" is a movie about football that does contain
some of the classic sports movie elements, but it is not a standard sports
movie, not by a long shot. Stone's film refuses to skirt the surface of its
subject matter. "Any Given Sunday" burrows under the skin of professional
football, exposing backdoor deals, negligent doctors, and all sorts of other
sordid affairs. Like much of the football action portrayed within, this film
resides not in the announcer's booth or the stands, the vantage point from
which most fans see the sport, but in the huddle, on the bottom of a
pile-up, in the football trenches. For those interested in the sport, this
football movie is a revealing experience.</P>
<P>Al Pacino stars as Tony D'Amato, head coach for a fictional professional
football team called the Miami Sharks. Once a proud franchise, the Sharks
are in decline. Their aging star quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) has
suffered a back injury that will keep him out for several weeks during the
playoff drive. Without him, the team doesn't seem to have much chance at the
postseason. After the Sharks' backup quarterback also goes down,
third-stringer Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) gets his chance. When he performs
well, D'Amato and the team's young owner, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron
Diaz), butt heads over what ought to be done about the team once Rooney
returns. Tony wants to stay loyal to his old friend Cap, while Christina
believes the team must travel in a new direction with the younger Beaman.
Unfortunately, Beaman's loose-cannon style is clashing with the buttoned
down D'Amato, and his propensity to change plays on the field is bothering
egotistical star running back Julian Washington (LL Cool J), along with
several other veteran players.</P>
<P>"Any Given Sunday" is definitely a movie for football fans only. Anyone who
doesn't follow pro football most likely will not understand it. Those who do
will recognize just how much director Oliver Stone gets right in his stab at
transferring the sport to cinema. Many sports movies use for their "action"
scenes what is essentially tricked-up television footage of a sporting
event. Stone seems to realize that most fans have seen reels and reels of
that stuff, so he moves in a much more interesting direction. In "Any Given
Sunday," we see all the action from the point of view of the characters in
the film, from the players'. Anyone who has watched a football game on TV
has seen a long pass being thrown to a receiver deep downfield, but who
knows what the receiver sees? Stone shows us: he sees a solitary ball
sailing through the air against a clear blue sky, nothing else, no
defenders, no blockers, just the ball. Most of the football action in this
film is presented in this manner. We see a play from the perspective of the
quarterback, scrambling to find an open man with defenders bearing down on
him. We see it from the coach's perspective, dashing down the sideline,
trying to get a peek at how the play is unfolding. We see what it's like for
the linemen, the men in the trenches, toiling to help others score points.
To someone unfamiliar with football, this scenes will probably be merely
disorienting, leaving them to wonder just what in the world is going on.
Veteran football watchers should have no problem filling in the details and
marveling at Stone's very original method of filming the action. "Any Given
Sunday" has some of the most pumped-up sports scenes I've ever seen. It
truly manages to capture the speed and bone-crunching intensity of the game.</P>
<P>Football aficionados will also notice how uncannily true-to-life this film
can be. There are several spot-on elements to this story: the injured
veteran quarterback being replaced by a hot young player whose star is
rising; the young and cocky owner, inheriting a sports franchise from her
father without much chance to learn how to run it; the players doing rap
videos; the smarmy TV journalist (John C. McGinley) who shoots off at the
mouth without really knowing what he's talking about. To anyone who has
followed pro football both on the field and in the media, much of this film
is so realistic, it can hardly be considered satire. But satire it is, and
Stone doesn't shy away from presenting all sides of this complicated sport,
no matter how ugly it might be. The vision of James Woods' corrupt doctor,
giving injured players a clean bill of health so they can be ready for the
next game, is so plausible it's downright scary. You won't find any far-out
conspiracy theories like in Stone's 1991 effort "JFK," but a clear
indictment of the world of pro sports is definitely in effect.</P>
<P>The casting is remarkably efficient. Pacino is dynamic as usual, turning up
the volume as Stone would want him to, and Jamie Foxx matches him
surprisingly well as a dramatic actor. Fans of his comedy work won't be
disappointed, though, when they see his hilariously ludicrous rap video.
Cameron Diaz does another unusual turn, and does it well. She's building
quite an accomplished resume as a character actress. I particularly enjoyed
John C. McGinley as a bothersome reporter. He exists as the perfect parody
of the self-satisfied TV "journalists" splashed all over cable sports
channels. Several real NFL players appear in small roles, and a substantial
one is given to former linebacker Lawrence Taylor, as a veteran close to
retirement. Taylor, to his credit, inhabits his role quite convincingly.</P>
<P>Stone paces his film reasonably well, though he can't avoid his familiar
indulgences, like numerous cuts to seemingly random images. These have
always annoyed me. He nearly ruins a scene between Pacino and Foxx by
continually intercutting shots of gladiators and old football heroes.
(Please, Mr. Stone, we got the football players-as-gladiators allegory some
time ago.) The director's kinetic camera work is fine for the action, but
when Stone slows it down, he really slows it down. He concentrates a little
too much on some unnecessary family subplots, such as a wife for Cap Rooney
and a family D'Amato never sees. The side stories are so badly
underdeveloped (Rooney and his wife are given one measly scene, and we never
even meet D'Amato's family) that they probably should've been removed
entirely. Certainly the film, at nearly three hours' length, didn't need any
padding.</P>
<P>Finally, this is a sports movie, so we still get the familiar old climax of
the big game that solves all conflicts at the end, but "Any Given Sunday" is
more than that. It's familiar story and characters are counterbalanced by
its almost unflinching look at the world of pro football. Again, please keep
in mind that those unfamiliar with the sport will most likely miss the
satirical effect Stone utilizes in this film. I am recommending "Any Given
Sunday" for football fans only. For my money, this is probably the best
football movie made in a long while, almost startling in its truthfulness.
Afterward, I almost felt as if I had been in the game myself.</P>
