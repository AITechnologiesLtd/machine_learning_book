<PRE>                           THE PREACHER'S WIFE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        THE PREACHER'S WIFE is a two-hour Hallmark card -- 
sappy and unoriginal yet uplifting and touching. Yes, I'm a sarcastic 
cynic, but even I can put that aside when a decent feel-good movie 
comes along, especially these morally-sound musical comedies with 
a black female lead (SISTER ACT, anybody?). THE PREACHER'S 
WIFE is a positive movie about the comraderie of a black community 
like only a white woman could tell it... I didn't say I was going to set 
the sarcasm _completely_ aside.</P>
<P>        Denzel Washington plays an angel sent to lend assistance 
to a preacher (Courtney B. Vance) and his family. Whitney Houston, 
of course, plays the preacher's wife, a gospel-singing woman who 
finds her husband has less and less time for her as troubles mount 
in the church and community. Their son's best friend is being sent 
away to a foster family, a local kid is charged with armed robbery, 
the church boiler is shot and a greedy local businessman (Gregory 
Hines) is buying up all the property in sight. Predictably, these 
problems only exist to be solved by Denzel the Anzel... excuse 
me, the Angel...</P>
<P>        Courtney is hard to convince at first, even after Denzel 
pops up three consecutive times when Courtney prays for divine 
help. And all Denzel's talk of an angel handbook and the three rules 
he has to abide by (don't expose him to sunlight, don't get him wet, 
don't feed him after midnight) seems more than a little odd, but the 
preacher's family easily accepts him as Courtney's new assistant.</P>
<P>        Two of THE PREACHER'S WIFE's best comic 
performances are from Whitney's WAITING TO EXHALE 
compatriot Loretta Devine, as Courtney's secretary, and Jenifer 
Lewis in the role of Whitney's mother. In a movie that asks us to 
believe angels are among us, the fact that Whitney's mom looks 
young enough to be her sister is infinitely less believable.</P>
<P>        Denzel almost assumes Courtney's roles for awhile, serving 
as father-figure for their son, doing church paperwork and even 
taking Whitney dancing at Jazzie's, a club frequented by Lionel 
Richie. (Actually, I think Lionel works there as part-time bartender 
to supplement his paltry "All Night Long" and "We Are the World" 
royalties.) This causes a little heavenly strife and even prompts 
Courtney to say the h-word, but rest assured all will end happily.</P>
<P>        As always, the soundtrack comes courtesy of Whitney 
Houston herself and, just like the last two times, is billed as "the 
soundtrack event of the year." She doesn't even make albums 
anymore, just soundtracks. Unlike THE BODYGUARD or WAITING 
TO EXHALE, though, her musical contributions to THE 
PREACHER'S WIFE give the movie its identity. Songs like "I Love 
the Lord" and "The Lord Is My Shepherd," most of which feature 
the Georgia Mass Choir, could singlehandedly make gospel music 
radio-friendly. Lyrics saying God is "bigger than a Shaq attack," 
though, probably won't go over big with the kids. Trust me.</P>
<P>        Penny Marshall, who directed this remake of Cary Grant's 
THE BISHOP'S WIFE, did an admirable job making this movie 
attractive holiday fluff that elevates itself above the mediocre mush 
you'd expect. She followed the recipe for a feel-good Christmas 
movie and came up with something tasty, not just the usual 
PRANCER fruitcake. Remaking it with a black cast was her best 
idea -- it's the appeal of Denzel, Whitney and the supporting cast 
that make the movie fun to watch. THE PREACHER'S WIFE is a 
safe movie for all ages, and I imagine more than a few church youth 
groups will be taking trips to the movie theater this Christmas 
season.</P>
