<P>Starring Bette Midler, Casey Affleck, Danny DeVito, Jamie Lee Curtis,
Neve Campbell, William Fichtner, Marcus Thomas. Directed by Nick Gomez.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Drowning Mona is a weak, underrealized, inconsistent comedy that has
enough little throwaway gags to keep us interested but not much more to
sustain our constant involvement. It's dark, often meanspirited but
it's laughs don't originate in its pitch-black tone. Instead, the few
moments here worth savoring are the goofier, more light-hearted ones.
Does that make the movie a failure? That depends on your tastes.</P>
<P>The film opens with a scruffy-looking Bette Midler getting out of her
trailer to go somewhere. She realizes she doesn't have keys to the
right car, so she is forced to take her son's. As she's riding along
she comes to a hairpin turn that, if not maneuvered around correctly,
can lead to a car plunging into a lake. She slams the breaks, but they
don't work. Down, down to a watery grave.</P>
<P>Via flashbacks we find out that Midler's character, whose name was Mona
Dearly, was not a well-liked lady. She was, in fact, a violent bitch
who delighted in hitting people with frying pans and other blunt
objects when they did the slightest thing to piss her off. This leaves
the town detective (Danny DeVito) with a problem: who cut Mona Dearly's
breaks? Everyone, it seems, had a motive. Was it Mona's husband
(William Fichtner)? Her idiot son (Marcus Thomas)? A mild-mannered (or
is he) young enterpeneur who's had his share of encounters with Mona
(Casey Affleck)? Or could it be Mona's husband's mistress (Jamie Lee
Curtis)? All of the above?</P>
<P>The problem with Drowning Mona is that it's consistently unfunny. Is it
offbeat? Yes. Entertaining? Sometimes. But only on a few occasions does
it inspire as much as hearty chuckles. The movie is dark, yes, being as
it deals with the murder of a woman whom everyone wanted dead, but its
mood rarely translates into laughs.</P>
<P>That being said, rookie screenwriter Peter Steinfeld has a couple
moments where he shines. These are throwaways; they don't make the
movie, but at least they assure that Drowning Mona is worth a rental.
Example: two policemen approach a suicidal man. He desperately
yells "Don't come any closer, sheriff!" referring to DeVito. The
policeman with him yells "No! He's not a sheriff!" That was one of the
only times I laughed with this movie rather than at it.</P>
<P>Considering the big name cast, the performances here are, to my great
shock, merely serviceable. Bette Midler is good at playing a bitch, but
she has so little actual screentime she isn't on enough to really make
a difference. Casey Affleck is annoying as hell, using a shrill, high-
pitched voice for some reason I don't understand. Neve Campbell isn't
the brightest light bulb when it comes to satire and she makes it quite
evident with her dull, one-sided performance. The one actor who rises
above the crowd is William Fichtner, who's quite good at playing a
slimy, unsympathetic bastard. And since that's what all of the
characters sans, maybe, DeVito's are supposed to be, I wish all the
actors involved in this project were as good as Fichtner at what the
script asked them to do.</P>
<P>It's hard to hate Drowning Mona. Some of it is done well, especially
the uncharacteristically cheery musical score that accompanies some of
the proceedings. But there is not enough here. Not enough laughs, not
enough plot, not enough good performances. This is an interesting
failure, but a failure all the same.</P>
