<P>     The de facto best of the June and early-July action comedies, MEN
IN BLACK has everything that you could want in yet another $100M adap-
tation of a comic-book:  a wise-cracking lead (Will Smith), his crusty
partner (Tommy Lee Jones, all deadpan), a bugged-out villain (Vincent
D'Onofrio, with a hefty assist from make-up artist Rick Baker), a pop-
reference friendly premise (GHOSTBUSTERS meets "The X-Files" meets
"Dragnet" meets THE BLUES BROTHERS), cool sets and cooler gadgets (prod-
uction design by Bo Welch), good music (by Danny Elfman), great loca-
tions (in and around New York City), and a director (Barry Sonnenfield,
of GET SHORTY and ADDAMS FAMILY fame) who happens to have the most
macabre sense of humor this side of Tim Burton.  And all of it rendered
in such a disarmingly unpretentious and almost... throwaway fashion,
that you can't *help* but like it.  By the second hour, however, the
seams begin to show.  There's not nearly enough plot or character de-
velopment to offset the sight gags or special effects, both of which are
*also* in short supply.  MEN IN BLACK holds back on everything and the
result is a cycle as vicious as Mike Tyson's appetite for flesh.  There
isn't enough story to keep the characters interesting when the gags go
flat, nor are there enough gags to keep the characters interesting when
the *story* goes flat.  Maybe the sequel will be a bit better.</P>
