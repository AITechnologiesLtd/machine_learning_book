<PRE>                                   RECKLESS
                       A film review by John Paul Powell
                        Copyright 1995 John Paul Powell</PRE>

<PRE>God Rest Ye Merry Mia </PRE>
<P>(Sung to the tune of "God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman".)</P>
<P>God rest ye merry Mia, let nothing you dismay.
You're the mother of twelve children, how do you make it through the day?  
You took Woody to court. 
Now the lawyers he must pay.  </P>
<PRE>Chorus </PRE>
<PRE>O' Woody, won't cast you any more.  
Any more. 
O' Woody, won't cast you any more.  </PRE>
<P>In the movie RECKLESS, Mia plays a naive spouse.  
She as dim as Polyanna.  
You'd think Rachel roomed at the Brady house.  
Rachel loves her husband Tom, but he's a scheming louse. </P>
<PRE>Chorus </PRE>
<PRE>O' Tony, it's good to be a Goldwyn heir.  
Plenty of parts to spare. 
O' Tony, it's good to be a Goldwyn heir.  </PRE>
<P>Christmas is coming and Tom bought a gift for his wife.  
He phoned the local hitman and put a contract on her life.  
His plan is better than O.J.'s.  
No Kato or a knife.  </P>
<PRE>Chorus</PRE>
<PRE>O' REAL killers, you best stay low.  
O.J.'s putting golf balls at home. 
O' REAL killers, you best stay low.  </PRE>
<P>Christmas Eve finds Rachel and Tom lying in their bed.  
Remorseful, he confesses the plot to shoot her dead. 
She escaped out a window.  
"This is so mean," is all she said.  </P>
<PRE>Chorus </PRE>
<PRE>O' Rachel, shivers as it snows.  
Where will she go?  
O' Rachel, shivers as it snows.  </PRE>
<P>Standing at a phone booth, her world in disarray. 
Rachel thumbs a ride from a driver on his way.  
Lloyd, a good samaritan, gives her a place to stay.  </P>
<PRE>Chorus </PRE>
<PRE>O' Lloyd, is a hard-working soul.  
Dark past in tow.  
O' Lloyd, is a hard-working soul.  </PRE>
<P>Lloyd has a wife, she is confined to a wheelchair. 
They adopt Rachel into their family and she joins the devout pair.  
Year-long escapades do cease as Tom turns up there.  </P>
<PRE>Chorus </PRE>
<PRE>O' Tom, please show yourself the door.  
Show yourself the door.  
O' Tom, please show yourself the door.  </PRE>
<P>RECKLESS is a dark comedy, on that we should be clear. 
If you're anal retentive, another direction you should veer.  
It's surreal zaniness that David Lynch would cheer.  </P>
<PRE>Chorus </PRE>
<PRE>O' Craig Lucas, what a way to go!  
PRELUDE TO A KISS still blows. 
O' Craig Lucas, what a way to go!  </PRE>
<P>The handiwork of Rene is unmistakeably first-class.  
The fantasy landscape mirrors a Christmas ornament made of glass.  
Mia's so engaging, Woody can pucker up and kiss her...  </P>
<PRE>Chorus</PRE>
<PRE>O' Woody won't cast Mia any more. 
Any more. 
O' Woody won't cast Mia any more.  </PRE>
<P>RECKLESS is rated Q for quirky. A Tim Burton ambience x Mia Farrow
- a wandering second half + one depraved regurgitation scene x
surprising twists - one Let's Make A Deal skit + the absence of a
Rudolph, Frosty and Santa = an unstable Christmas fable.</P>
