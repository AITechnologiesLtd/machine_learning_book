<P>     AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER addresses the same themes and transpires in
the same region of the world as Milcho Manchevski's BEFORE THE RAIN.  AN
UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER doesn't have the same stylish photography or
non-chronological narrative, and it takes place in 1925 rather than in
the present-day, but both films address the tragic results when
intolerance (tribal or racial) and political expediency take precedence
over simple, human compassion.</P>
<P>     Most of AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER takes place on the
Romanian/Bulgarian border where Capitaine Petre Dumitriu (Claudiu Bleont)
has been posted by a commander (Marcel Iures) who bears him a grudge.
Together with his wife Marie-Therese (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and three
young children, Petre leaves the city for the virtually-untamed wilds.
There, while he assumes command of his ill-trained and often
insubordinate troops, Marie-Therese does her best to make a happy home
for her family, despite stray bullets that shatter mirrors.</P>
<P>     When eight of Petre's men are killed by bandits, the captain is
forced to take a group of Bulgarian peasants hostage.  Although initially
frightened by these men, Marie-Therese eventually takes pity on them and
invests time and effort into getting to know them.  They soon become more
than just political pawns to her, and when her husband is ordered to
execute them, she is devastated--and doesn't intend for this to happen
without a struggle.</P>
<P>     The story underlying AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER is simple and stark.
Not so straightforward are the questions of conscience posed by Lucian
Pintilie's script.  The basic impotence of the characters only emphasizes
the real-world difficulties faced by peacemakers.  It's seductively easy
to kill a bunch of scapegoats and conveniently sweep any dissidents under
the nearest rug.</P>
<P>     Despite a fine performance by British actress Kristin Scott-Thomas
(best known for the role of Fiona in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, and
displaying trilingual abilities here), her character doesn't have much
real depth, and that's one of AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER's glaring
weaknesses.  In fact, as tenuous as the audience's connection is to
Marie-Therese, it's even less certain where Petre is concerned.  At
times, the captain is too cold and distant to court favor from any
viewer.</P>
<P>     AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER is getting very limited distribution, but
for those who have an opportunity to see it, the movie makes an excellent
companion piece to BEFORE THE RAIN.  If nothing else, these two pictures
taken together underline the unhappy truth that, in the Balkans, little
has changed over the past seventy years.</P>
