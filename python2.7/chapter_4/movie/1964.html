<PRE>                                CLIFFHANGER
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Can Rockies rescue ranger Sylvester
     Stallone recover from a trauma, and get it together enough to
     clobber nasty super-criminals trying to recover three
     suitcases of stolen money that fell out of a plane over the
     Rockies?  Hint: Stallone co-authored the screenplay.  Lots of
     action, lots of cliche, a few stunts.  Rating: low +1 (-4 to
     +4).</P>
<P>     Sylvester Stallone is back in a pure action, non-comedy role.  He had
tried breaking out into comic roles in OSCAR and STOP OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT.
OSCAR I like to spring on unsuspecting people since it really is about the
funniest comedy I have seen in the last ten years, though probably not due
to Stallone's efforts.  On the other hand, STOP OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT is
reputedly just awful.  So Stallone is back in a sort of mountain-climbing
equivalent of DIE HARD that might have been called FALL HARD.  Stallone
himself co-authored the screenplay with Michael France, undoubtedly to make
sure the story gave audiences exactly what they wanted--breath-taking stunts
tied together with brain-numbing cliche.</P>
<P>     Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a Rocky Mountain rescue ranger who was once
great but lost his nerve after a horrible traumatic experience on a wire
high over a valley that should have been called Macho Grande.  Gabe is back
in the Rockies a year later, testing to see if he can get together with his
woman friend Jessie (played by Janice Turner), patch things up with a buddy
(played by Michael Rooker), and pull his life together.  Just at that moment
a plot to steal $100,000,000 is falling apart overhead.  John Lithgow plays
Qualen, a British master criminal with an accent that occasionally fades.
Qualen heads a team of killers who intended to hijack the cash but ended up
accidentally dropping it in three suitcases over the Rockies and who now
want the rescue rangers to retrieve the suitcases.</P>
<P>     Of course, the real stars of the film are the three S's: Stallone,
scenery, and stunts.  While some of the scenery really is the Rockies, some
is the Italian Alps near Cortina D'Ampezzo, and some is sets.  The stunts,
which I will not describe so as not to spoil them, are impressive, though
not really too different from those you would probably think of if you were
scripting a similar story.  Trevor Jones's score bears a marked resemblance
to his score for THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS.</P>
<P>     This is about what you would expect Sylvester Stallone would be
releasing in the summertime.  It is nearly two hours of action and familiar
plot against a less familiar setting.  I give it a low +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
