    et al.</P>
<PRE>THE BACKSTORY</PRE>
<P>To understand _Castle of Cagliostro_ most completely, let's take a
brief detour into the Lupin character's illustrious past.  If you'd
rather skip it and get on with the movie, use your text-find feature
to go to the words "THE FILM".</P>
<P>In the first decade of the 20th century, a previously-unsuccessful
French journalist/novelist named Maurice Leblanc created a
gentleman-burglar named Arsène Lupin.  It was a fortunate accident of
serendipity that the character of Arséne Lupin, inspired in part by
the adventures of Sherlock Holmes (and sometimes featuring a Great
Detective named variously Herlock Sholmes or Holmelock Shears as one
of Lupin's adversaries), became so popular with the French public and,
by translation, the rest of the world that Leblanc could not let him
rest, and so most of Leblanc's subsequent short stories and novels
featured the character until Leblanc's death in 1941.  In addition to
the books, a play was written based on the character (which Leblanc
then turned into another novel), and a movie was made starring John
and Lionel Barrymore.</P>
<P>The idea of writing mystery stories centering around a burglar
protagonist was not new, of course--Conan Doyle's own brother-in-law E.
W. Hornung had done so several years before, with two volumes of short
stories and one novel about a gentleman-burglar named Raffles.  However,
Leblanc's Lupin was infused with a Gallic romanticism, bon viveur, and
sense of fun that the stoic British Raffles lacked.</P>
<P>Arsène Lupin was a gallant, dashing figure, suave and charming and
gifted with great physical prowess.  He is credited with introducing
jiu-jitsu to Paris, he was a master of disguise, and he always left a
calling card before his visits explaining just what he planned to
take.  Sometimes he told his tales to a Dr. Watson-style
confidant-chronicler, sometimes he was a protagonist in third person,
sometimes he never appeared at all until the next-to-last chapter of
the story, having been in disguise as someone else all along.
Although he was a criminal, he never let the thought of it depress him
(the way Raffles's companion did), and his sense of morals owed much
to Robin Hood--he could not bear to see an injustice done, nor could
he resist a damsel (in distress or otherwise).  Leslie Charteris's
"The Saint" could be considered a spiritual descendant of Arsène
Lupin.</P>
<P>Sadly, though many of the earlier Lupin novels have entered the public
domain, few have been e-texted for greater availability.  One, _The
Glass Stopper_, can be found via Project Gutenberg
(<URL:<A HREF="http://sailor.gutenberg.com>">http://sailor.gutenberg.com></A>), and another, _The Woman With Two
Smiles_, is available in PalmDoc format in the Mystery area of the
Palm Library (<URL:<A HREF="http://www.memoware.com>">http://www.memoware.com></A>).</P>
<P>In the late 1960s, the Lupin novels were popular in Japan, and
Japanese artist Katou Kazuhiko (aka "Monkey Punch") began a "Lupin
III" manga series in a Japanese magazine, chronicling the adventures
of Arsène Lupin's grandson.  It became popular enough itself to spawn
three manga series, three TV series and many movies and Original
Animation Videos (made-for-video-release movies).  It is widely agreed
among fans that the best of these was _Castle of Cagliostro_, the
second cinematic Lupin movie.</P>
<P>Interestingly, at the time of Lupin III's creation, Japan didn't
enforce trade copyrights, and so the Leblanc estate was never notified
or asked for permission to create this derivative work.  When they
_did_ find out, there was legal trouble, and eventually an agreement
was reached that the Lupin name would not be used when the anime and
manga were exported to other nations.  Hence, when Streamline dubbed
Lupin anime, they renamed him "Wolf"; when AnimEigo did, they called
him "Rupan"--a phonetic Anglicization of the Japanese pronounciation
of "Lupin".  However, since that time, the earlier Lupin works have
passed into the public domain, and the current legal status of this
agreement is somewhat murky.  Manga's Cagliostro DVD uses the spelling
"Lupin," though it is pronounced "loo-PAHN" in the dub.</P>
<P>Many of the first Lupin III stories and films were completely over
the top, similar to Mad Magazine, and Lupin III bore very little
resemblance to his gentlemanly ancestor.  In earlier stories, Lupin
had little compunction about killing people.  When acclaimed Japanese
director Hayao Miyazaki, who also co-directed part of the first Lupin
TV series, took the helm of _Castle of Cagliostro_, he took the
opportunity to redefine the characters to be more in line with his
vision of heroism.</P>
<PRE>THE FILM</PRE>
<P>The film _Castle of Cagliostro_ has its own history, almost as
fascinating as that of the Lupin III character or the plot of the film
itself.  The story concept is very loosely based on a 1924 Arsène
Lupin novel, _Countess Cagliostro_, in which a woman named Clarisse
turns out to be the granddaughter of a famous real-life 18th-century
scoundrel and forger named Cagliostro (who died in a cell in a castle
in Italy, which thus bears his name).</P>
<P>Cagliostro opened theatrically in 1979 to only modest success, but met
with greater popularity over the years as it was reshown.  Rumor has
it that Steven Spielberg was awestruck when he saw it at Cannes in
1980.</P>
<P>In 1983, footage from Cagliostro and the earlier Lupin film _Mystery
of Mamo_ was licensed to Stern Electronics for use in a Dragon's
Lair-like arcade game, _Cliff Hanger_ (which was seen briefly in a
video arcade as an animators' in-joke in an episode of
_Macross_/_Robotech_).</P>
<P>Subsequently, Cagliostro was optioned by "anime antichrist" Carl
Macek's Streamline Films company, and given a theatrical sub followed
by a lackluster dub for video and Japan Airlines flights (starring Cam
"Jimmy Flinders" Clarke (Max Sterling & Lancer from _Robotech_,
Leonardo from the _Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ cartoon, Jackie Chan
in countless cheap live-action dubs) as the voice of "Wolf").</P>
<P>The Streamline dub caught flak from fans both for retiming, zooming,
and digital matting the beautiful opening-credits animation sequence
and parts of the film to eliminate all traces of Japanese writing, and
for Macek's inane changes of dubbed comments or insertion of dialogue
where there previously was none.  The most famous example changes
Goemon the Samurai's "Once again I have cut a worthless object" to
"Should've worn an asbestos suit" after he deftly slices Lupin's
burning clothes off with one stroke of his katana.</P>
<P>More recently, as Streamline decided to get out of the anime business,
_Castle of Cagliostro_ was purchased by Manga Video, who commissioned
a new subtitle translation by translator-extraordinaire Neil Nadelman,
as well as an all-new dub.  These have been or will be released on VHS
and DVD.  (See "THE DVD," below.)</P>
<PRE>THE STORY</PRE>
<P>_Castle of Cagliostro_ opens with Lupin and his companion/confidante
Jigen Daisuke robbing the swanky Casino Monaco only to find that all
the money they stole is counterfeit.  Recognizing the style of the
forgery, Lupin decides that it's time to return to the scene of an
ignoble defeat from his youth, the small European duchy of Cagliostro,
where he will finally uncover the secret of the forgeries once and for
all.</P>
<P>No sooner does Lupin arrive than he falls right into the middle of a
modern-day fairy tale, complete with a damsel in distress.  Clarice,
daughter of the late Grand Duke and Duchess who died in a fire seven
years before, is to be wed to the evil Count Cagliostro, who sees the
ring she wears as a secret to unlocking a vast treasure (while
continuing the family tradition of counterfeiting on the side).
Lupin, who has unfinished business with both the Count and Clarice,
cannot allow this to happen.</P>
<P>And so Lupin's other companions, the samurai Goemon and the spy
Fujiko, soon arrive to lend a hand--as does Lupin's arch-nemesis, the
determined Inspector Zenigata, and his squad of Interpol police.  The
Count has a few surprises in store...but so does Lupin.  The film
moves from climax to climax, growing in tension and excitement toward
a final action-packed conclusion.</P>
<P>_Castle of Cagliostro_ is a genuine feel-good movie, and proof that a
feel-good movie doesn't have to follow the saccharine Disney formula
to be feel-good.  Though it might surprise those who have only seen
his atypically-violent _Princess Mononoke_, Miyazaki graces the
characters in this story with a touch of gentleness, of
sentimentality, even in the midst of the over-the-top action
sequences.  Yet it never seems forced or artificial, as when a Disney
film beats you about the head and shoulders with the pugil-stick of
new-agey politically-correct morality.  In the end of the film, when
the Interpol police wave cheerfully out the back of the APC truck as
they drive away, it doesn't seem silly or artificial...it just seems
right, as though it couldn't have happened any other way.</P>
<P>Some of Cagliostro's action scenes have been criticized by some for
being a little over the top--and indeed during the car chase scene it
seems that Herbie the Love Bug is the stunt double for Lupin's
Volkswagen coupé, as the sturdy little car drives right up and down
the side of a near-vertical cliff, held aloft by nothing but speed,
centrifugal force, and artistic license.  Also, for the incredibly
anal nitpickers, an autogyro is seen to hover--which is actually
impossible, as autogyros don't have a powered main rotor.  However,
these are really no more outrageous than some of the stunts Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Chow Yun-Fat, or James Bond assay in their films, and,
more importantly, are very _fun_ to watch.</P>
<PRE>THE DVD</PRE>
<P>Manga Video's _Castle of Cagliostro_ DVD is an excellent presentation
of the film, and an average-to-fairexample of DVD features.  The film
transfer was wonderfully clear and vibrant, and quite surpassed VHS
fansub and dub copies in terms of quality, and the sound was also
excellent in both the English and Japanese tracks.  They clarity
allowed details not seen in prior versions to appear, be they smudges
on characters' clothing or the hilariously incongruous fake fangs
Jigen was wearing in one scene.  It is truly hard to believe that this
movie is twenty years old.  The sole thing keeping it from perfection
was the lack of an anamorphic transfer.</P>
<P>The subtitles were large, clear, and easy to read, and seemed close
enough to yet different enough from the fansubbed version to be a
complete retranslation. Strangely, a sign in the early part of the
film was digitally-matted out and covered with "Nice try, guys!"
rather than subtitled...but the matting vanished halfway through the
shot.  The opening credits were preserved as they had been, Japanese
symbols and all, and the opening song was even translated--a nice
touch, given that this isn't always the case.</P>
<P>The dub quality was up to Manga's recent standard--quite faithful to
the original, a mostly well-written script, but only fair to mediocre
actors.  Perhaps it is simply that they suffer by comparison to
Streamline's more familiar voices, but the actors for Inspector
Zenigata, Jodo, and Gustav seemed particularly bad.  Manga's Zenigata
in particular was unable to match the range of the Japanese actor or
Greg Snegoff, Streamline's actor for Zenigata (who also played Khyron
and Scott Bernard in _Robotech_), at portraying emotional
subtexts...which meant that in the last scene, where he should have
come off as gruff but warm, he simply came off as gruff and flat.
Jigen, Goemon, Count Cagliostro, and the old gardner were so-so, and
Lupin, Fujiko, and Clarice were pretty good.</P>
<P>Though there was some unnecessary dialogue (and a few minor minor
obscenities) added, most lines were faithful to the original, and
Goemon's "asbestos suit" line was the much more satisfactory "This is
not worthy of my blade."  It was somewhat annoying that they chose to
pronounce "Lupin" more in line with the Japanese, "loo-PAHN," but
given the Lupin trademark travails, not altogether surprising.  On the
whole, a dub I wouldn't be ashamed to show to subtitle haters.</P>
<P>That the DVD itself is only fair to good is due largely to its menu
features and content (or lack thereof).  The menu itself is nothing
special, offering the usual "play the movie, scene index, language
setup" options, as well as options for two trailers (one being little
more than a slideshow of box images of Manga's entire catalog set to
an annoyingly repetitive percussion beat, the other being an a series
of clips from Manga shows set to a KMFDM tune), a list of current
Manga DVD titles, and a WWW link (which is, amusingly, little more
than a picture saying to click on the Internet Shortcut located in the
data area of the DVD-ROM).  (It also seems to be easily breakable,
given that I have several times managed to get my Hollywood
Plus/DVDStation setup to load the menu without the selection cursor
appearing.)</P>
<P>Most annoying, however, is the "metal shards sliding together and
apart with metallic clank" transition that appears whenever a menu
option is selected--and has nothing at all to do with _Castle of
Cagliostro_ or anything else on the DVD, unlike some of the equally
extravagant transitions on James Bond Special Edition and other DVDs
that at least fit the theme of the movie.  But then, this is not
terribly surprising given that Manga Video has a long tradition of
trying to play up the "kewl" aspects of its anime, as demonstrated by
its former slogan ("Bizarre.  Twisted.  Uniquely imaginative"), which
it thankfully seems to have dropped.</P>
<P>It would have been nice if they had added, say, a small documentary or
featurette on the popularity of Miyazaki, or of Lupin, or the
character's history, or the film's use in Cliff Hanger, and if they
had nixed the annoying transition.  However, as it is, the DVD is more
than a sufficient presentation of _Castle of Cagliostro_ to satisfy
Lupin, anime, and Miyazaki fans alike.</P>
