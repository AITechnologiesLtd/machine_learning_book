<PRE>"Bridget Jones's Diary" - The Secret to a Good Time
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>My favorite moment: two British blokes engage in a
street fight to see who is the better man.  This
sequence shows that when it comes to love, there are
no clear choices.  And in Britain where restraint is
the norm, two 'proper' men trying to slug it out look
amusingly like drunkards failing a sobriety test.</P>
<P>There's nothing like a cheery, romantic comedy to help
lift your spirits and reaffirm your love of life. 
Yes, a good romantic comedy is always welcome.  But
BJD, unfortunately and surprisingly, does not always
evoke the emotional highs that it constantly seemed
poised to reach.  It's almost effervescent.  It's
almost joyous.  It's almost magical.  And it came so
close to being great.  But something held it back.</P>
<P>The movie felt like a fervent throwback to the days of
Audrey Hepburn when there seemed nothing more
invigorating than a brisk ride down a country road
with the wind blowing through your hair.  Watching
this film, there are sequences that remind us of
timeless, romantic classics such as "Roman Holiday" or
"Sabrina."  </P>
<P>Renee Zellwegger is radiant as our heroine, Bridget
Jones, who seems to be the live comic strip character
version of "Cathy."  A little overweight and a little
bit neurotic (and very British), she struggles daily
with her sense of self-worth.  In a cute opening
sequence, Bridget droops in front of a TV and
lip-synchs to Celine Dion's syrupy "All By Myself." 
Will her life mirror the sad lyrics of soft rock FM
ballads forever?  Not if she can help it.  Armed with
a new attitude and a new diary to write down her
innermost thoughts and observations, she's ready to
make a difference in her life.  </P>
<P>Her life proceeds to take a series of life-affirming
as well as challenging turns as she becomes involved
with her handsome and successful boss, Daniel (Hugh
Grant).  He treats her like a movie star.  At the
outset, she's ebullient.  But doubts soon emerge.  To
add to her growing uncertainty, Mark (Colin Firth), a
childhood friend, seems to be waiting in the wings. 
More complicated, Daniel and Mark are bitter over an
episode that ended their friendship.  Who is the
better person? The audience will be somewhat divided. 
The film adeptly keeps us wondering who is good and
who is bad and who deserves to be forgiven and given
another chance.  </P>
<P>But there's also anxiety at home.  Her hilariously
dotty mom, infamous for her curry turkey dinners, has
left to be a presenter on a TV shopping network.  Her
dad has a perpetual vapid look about him and he always
seems to be in his pajamas.  These wacky characters
give this film a wonderfully offbeat quirkiness.</P>
<P>Despite its inherent appeal, the movie's magic falls
short.  At any given time, the film seemed like it was
destined to be a great romantic comedy.  But while
there's general gaiety, there's not enough emotional
pull.  Was the man that she chose truly Mr. Right? 
The "wow" factor behind her decision seemed muted. 
Most distracting and puzzling, though, was the
frequency of obscenities used.   With a little bit of
thought, this could have been retooled into a PG-13
version that could have been just as endearing.  BJD
certainly offers fireworks.  Yet they seem to be more
like the kind you'd see at a stadium after the home
team wins rather than the display during the 4th of
July by the Washington Monument, which is what we
deserved.</P>
