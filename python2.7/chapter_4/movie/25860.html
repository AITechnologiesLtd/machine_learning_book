<PRE>Billy Elliot
A film review by Robert Strohmeyer
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>"Just because I like ballet, it doesn't mean I'm a poof," says
11-year-old British mamma's boy Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell). And that just
about sums up the story of this oddball child prodigy. After all, when a
lad from a northern British mining town forsakes his granddad's boxing
gloves for a pair of satiny ballet slippers, it's more than the
neighbors and townsfolk can comprehend and, therefore, inherently good
cinematic drama.</P>
<P>Beyond the fact that the whole
coal-miner's-kid-has-talent-and-big-dreams genre has been horrifically
overdone from the earliest days of English-language narrative, Billy
Elliot (aka Dancer) is actually a treat to watch. Maybe it's just the
funny accents, but the dialog comes off fresh and surprising, even when
it's just Billy's dad (played by Gary Lewis) saying some stock like, "No
son of mine is going to be dancing ballet." In fact, Lewis conveys an
intense fury through his role as the apparently ignorant father, while
maintaining a sense of depth and dimension that is, at times, endearing.</P>
<P>Debut screenwriter Lee Hall has thrown this film against the backdrop of
the 1984 English miners' strike, adding richness to the otherwise banal
family drama. Yet other attempts at broadening the lives of these
characters fail entirely to be interesting. For instance; the typical
and unsurprising shots at sexual discovery, the completely pointless
presence of a cross-dressing, gay schoolyard buddy as a pretense for God
knows what--it just comes off cheap and stupid--and a happy-go-lucky
ending that made everyone in the audience (except for two fat ladies
directly in front of me) want to regurgitate their popcorn and Kit Kats.</P>
<P>Ultimately, though, Billy Elliot is a funny, charming movie. The cast is
loveable and believable. And the almost-entirely-T. Rex soundtrack
worked magically next to Jamie Bell's subtly awkward dancing to create a
memorable, satisfying film.</P>
