<PRE>                             I LOVE TROUBLE
                       A film review by Jon Ridge
                        Copyright 1994 Jon Ridge</PRE>
<P>CAST:  Julia Roberts, Nick Nolte, Saul Rubinek, James Rebhorn, Robert Loggia
DIRECTOR:  Charles Shyer
SCREENPLAY:  Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer
CINEMATOGRAPHY:  John Lindley
RUNNING TIME:  2:01
RELEASE:  June 29, 1994</P>
<P>     Julia Roberts walks into this film like a dream.  Dressed in suit
and skirt, her long legs and hips moving in perfect rhythm with a
confident stride, she strolls smoothly through the cite of a train
wreck, sparks a-flying, and into the life of rival reporter Peter
Beckett (Nick Nolte).  She's just what he envisions in a
woman--beautiful, sexy and, more importantly, insecure enough to know
less about what she does for a living than him.  It's a tidy, engaging
introduction to a movie that, unfortunately for these two talented
stars, has no involving story to tell.</P>
<P>     Writers Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer have given Roberts a
character she can really sink her teeth into.  She plays Sabrina
Peterson, a cub reporter for the Chicago Globe, whose only apparent
goal in life is to out-scoop the famous Peter Brackett.  Perhaps it's a
way of getting ahead in her own publishing firm, getting a reputation,
or proving her independence--that she isn't just a pretty face on the
job--that gives her such ravenous interest in a case involving some
sort of hormone designed to make cows produce milk earlier than they
need to.  I LOVE TROUBLE isn't really about the investigation these
columnists pursue--and shouldn't treat it with the importance this film
does--but a subtle, light romantic comedy about two people who would
seem to have absolutely nothing in common but the work and wind up more
intimately involved than expected.  The dialogue given them is
sporadically snappy banter, and Roberts and Nolte breeze through it
with the smiles and batting eyes of two veterans.  What they do not
need is a moronic, recycled subplot with murderers that will put them
in danger at the film's apex.  And yet, I LOVE TROUBLE is another in
the long, long, long line of movies to emerge from Hollywood in recent
years featuring potentially talented writers who naturally assume
(based on what they've seen before them) they must give an audience
what the industry can't seem to do without.</P>
<P>     The clash between comic duo and suspense subtext couldn't work
less than it does here.  The continuous report being executed is
uninteresting; the villains are helplessly un-written; the
peril--including an elevator shaft and unsteady platforms--is boring.
But all the while there is Julia Roberts (who looks great in a knit
sweater and jeans).  Having returned to the screen after two hectic
years of personal unease, Roberts seems to have found an understanding
of herself, and what it is that makes her a charismatic persona.
Director Charles Shyer definitely knows what it is, and captures it in
the best part of his picture:  the grin, the eyes, the legs.  We get a
lot of it, as Nolte gazes at her in the beginning and never seems to
take his eyes off her; a scene in which he peeps through a keyhole at
Roberts' slender legs lets you know exactly what his character thinks
of her own, and what we should all concentrate on more than anything.
Even during PRETTY WOMAN and FLATLINERS, I can't remember ever enjoying
watching Roberts talk in a movie more.</P>
<P>     Nolte is his suave self, but he too cannot escape the irreparable
doom this film has made for itself.  It's completely predictable fluff,
with mild comic touches here and there and barely a thing to remember
it by.  Julia Roberts is beautiful to look at, but that alone does not
a movie make.  Take note, you future screenwriters.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG
