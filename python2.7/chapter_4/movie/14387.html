<P>Did you ever hear the one about a young woman driving along an isolated 
stretch of road late one rainy night, unaware that a killer is hiding in 
the back seat of her car? "Urban Legend" begins with that old folk tale, 
adding a wry audio joke to the mix. As Natasha Gregson Wagner cruises 
along, oblivious to the ax-wielding loon right behind her, she pops a 
tape into the car's cassette player, and Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of 
the Heart" begins to play. The song's instrumental introduction comes to 
a close and the male back-up singer beings to croon "Turn around..." </P>
<P>I'm giving "Urban Legend," the latest entry in the post-"Scream" slasher 
movie renaissance, a qualified recommendation based on a few self-mocking 
gags like that, and a nice starring turn by Alicia Witt, but mostly for 
the filmmaker's audacious choices concerning the identity and motif of 
their serial killer.  </P>
<P>Before exploring the juicy details about the murderer (have no fear, 
there will be no spoilers here), it's important to cover the basics of 
the story. Like virtually every slasher flick, "Urban Legend" involves a 
lunatic chasing attractive, mostly white, young people. The story is set 
at a picturesque New England college staffed by only three adults; a 
crusty disbelieving administrator (John Neville), a wise, but ominous 
professor (Robert "Freddy Krueger" Englund) and a plucky security guard 
(Loretta Devine from "Waiting to Exhale"). In a recent interview, I asked 
Devine about the film's paucity of adults and she laughed and said "Shit, 
honey, kids don't want to look at grown-ups!"</P>
<P>There's a killer on campus, murdering students by recreating famous urban 
legends; those alligators-in-the-sewer, exploding-cats-in-the-microwave 
contemporary myths passed on by folks who invariably claim the stories 
really happened to a cousin of a friend of theirs.</P>
<P>Alicia Witt (the daughter from "Cybil") is the first to figure out the 
horrible pattern, but of course, no one will believe her. As the body 
count grows, the leaders of tomorrow cope with the carnage in the only 
logical fashion - - they throw a kegger party. Naturally, the killer 
attends and the corpses stack up, leading to the inevitable face-off 
between our heroine and the maniac.</P>
<P>Oh, and what a maniac! In a burst of idiotic inspiration, the filmmakers 
conceal the killer's identity by dressing the psychopath in (get ready 
for this) a parka with a fuzzy, face-obscuring hood that looks like it 
came straight out of "South Park." Instead of being frightening, I found 
myself fighting the urge to shout "Oh my God, Kenny's killing sophomores! 
You bastard!"</P>
<P>That's not all. When the killer is finally revealed, we're treated with 
an overacting exhibition of operatic proportions. Obviously, I can't 
mention the actor's name, so I'll simply offer my congratulations on a 
wild-eyed, teeth-gnashing, in-your-face performance that would make even 
William Shatner blush.</P>
<P>In the starring role, Alicia Witt deserves credit for centering the film 
by projecting an air of reason that makes all this nonsense seem almost 
credible. Even when her own behavior is illogical, there's a look of 
intelligence in her eyes that helps to sell the story. Look for Witt to 
go on to much better things.</P>
<P>"Urban Legend" ends with a patently unbelievable scene that sets thing up 
for a sequel. I hope they do one because, even with its many leaden spots,
 this lurid trifle is actually fun on a trashy level. Besides, there's so 
many urban legends left to cover. For instance, did you hear the one 
about a writer who turned out a screenplay for a teen movie that didn't 
insult the viewer's intelligence? It's true. It was written by the cousin 
of a friend of mine.</P>
