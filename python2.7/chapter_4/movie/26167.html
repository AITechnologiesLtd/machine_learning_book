URBANIA
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Heard any good stories lately?  Think any of them are true?</P>
<P>Jon Shear's edgy thriller, URBANIA, loves to mess with our minds, and it 
has lots of stories to tell us.  Set on a night with a built-in extra 
hour due to the Daylight Savings Time shift, the episodic story has 
characters who relate incidents with varying degrees of believability.  
The reaction of the characters hearing the stories frequently reveals 
more about them than about the teller.  Sometimes nervous laughter will 
be followed by painful introspection.  </P>
<P>The disorienting film takes devious delight in layering various versions 
of the stories so that we feel like we're jurors looking into a 
courtroom lined with funhouse mirrors.  What are we supposed to believe?  
One thing certain in this intriguing and distorting tale is that our 
eyes are glued to the screen.  The wonderfully labyrinthic script by 
Daniel Reitz and Jon Shear is based on Reitz's play "Urban Folk Tales."  </P>
<P>In a terrific, nuanced performance, Dan Futterman (THE BIRDCAGE) plays 
the story's protagonist, a gay man named Charlie, who is searching for 
his Mr. Right, Dean (Samuel Ball).  When Charlie first laid eyes on 
Dean, a hunk with a heart and snake tattoo, Charlie decided that Dean 
was the man for him.  Among the many questions is whether Dean, who 
appears to be a potentially violent homophobe, is what he seems to be.</P>
<P>Along the way this eventful night, Charlie encounters people gay and 
straight who have their stories to tell, most of which we see acted out.  
One story, about a woman with a wet poodle and a microwave, is thrown in 
as the story's only real joke.  The script is especially good at not 
telegraphing which stories have legs and which end almost before they 
begin.  One of the latter involves an attractive middle-aged woman who 
propositions a bartender with a purse full of fifties.  Even the most 
minor of these incidents are staged with such creepy class that they 
become quite intriguing.</P>
<P>It's the sort of film in which even innocuous phrases such as, "Don't 
forget to set your clock back," manage to have dark, ominous portents.  
The crisp editing by Randolph Bricker and Ed Marx keeps us on our toes 
as images sometimes flash by like a hit-and-run and others times linger 
to haunt us.  And Shane Kelly's cinematography captures the mood almost 
too well.  Nightmares after this film are definitely possible, not so 
much for what happens as for the movie's raw intensity.</P>
<P>"Just give me a second to figure out the ending," Charlie tells us at 
the opening of the movie.  The biggest disappointment for me was that 
URBANIA doesn't really have an ending.  Oh well, as they say, "the 
journey is the reward."  And for adventuresome moviegoers, URBANIA takes 
us through a fascinating night when danger is definitely in the air.</P>
<P>URBANIA runs a little long at 1:43.  It is rated R for strong violent 
and sexual content, language and some drug use.  It would be acceptable 
for college students and older.</P>
