<P>PLOT:
Computer animated film features a behind the scenes look at all of the toys
which we've had the pleasure of playing with over the years. The story
centers around the main toy, Woody the cowboy, who fears his place among the
kingdom of toys being taken over by the latest and greatest action figure
plaything called Buzz Lightyear.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Cute, inventive, entertaining little toy adventure for young and old alike.
Now despite the fact that computer animated graphics barely impress me
anymore, I did find much to like in this fun story about toys and their
apparent human personality traits and emotions. The fulfilling rivalry
between Woody and the newest toy in the room, Buzz Lightyear, was also quite
engaging, especially with the latter toy paying little attention to the
supposed competition. In fact, the best part about the movie was the whole
personality struggle which Buzz had to endure between his own belief that he
was an actual Space Ranger and Woody's constant reminders that he was "just
a toy". The action and the computer animation in the last half hour of the
film was the topper of it all, while the first half seemed more like a
build-up thereof. Overall, this movie should inspire many small children to
appreciate their lifeless toys on a more serious level (or at least not blow
them up!), while the bigger children, namely us adults, may just be
surprised to find themselves appreciating the sheer joy and childhood
reminiscences which this film aims to incite.</P>
