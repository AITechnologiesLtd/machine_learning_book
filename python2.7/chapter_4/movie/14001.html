<PRE>Review by:                Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>How this movie got produced, and released, and faded into obscurity
without me hearing about it is a wonder.  I happened upon it this weekend
at Blockbuster.  It only cost $2.00 to rent, too.  On the Blockbuster box
it said Drama, not rated.  On the actual box, it was a comedy, rated R.</P>
<P>In actuality, it's a series of vignettes, connected by a  Police Captain,
[Robert Loggia] and a rookie cop [Lea Thompson] who have the job of
booking the people arrested on one shift.</P>
<P>The film is a Drama, and it's a Comedy, too.  And, it probably is an R. 
It's not a children's movie, but it might be beneficial for teens to see. 
They cover murder, drunk driving, hate crimes, homelessness, euthanasia,
Aids, and cross-dressing.  </P>
<P>Every scene makes you think.  There is excellent dialogue, and there are
marvelous monologues.  If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend
it.  And, if you have seen it, when and where?</P>
<PRE>I give it a B+</PRE>
<P>See you at the movies [or the video store].</P>
