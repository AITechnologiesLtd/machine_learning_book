<PRE>"Screwed" -- If You Don't Expect Too Much, It Hurts
Less
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Watching "Screwed," an underwhelming comedy, is like
trying to drive a car 10 miles in 2nd gear.  You can
only go so far before you become frustrated with the
pace and progress.</P>
<P>In fact, this film has such little momentum that at
some point, the movie almost stops from its own lack
of inertia.  "Screwed" primarily fails because it has
no ambition.  It doesn't try to offer anything new as
far as comedies go.  Instead it relies too heavily on
an atmosphere of tomfoolery and inherently silly
characters that bumble their way through the plot.  </P>
<P>Yet, when it goes for a laugh, its method is to evoke
a sense of queasiness.  One such joke involves a
creepy mortician (Danny DeVito) who displays way too
much enjoyment for his job.  He comments, "It's
amazing what you dig out of dead people's bodies," as
he proceeds to play a recently acquired harmonica. 
Another joke involves a wrinkly, semi-naked, 80-year
old woman.  And another one involves seeing Sherman
Hemsley (TV's George Jefferson) in a thong.  These
sights are more apt to make you cringe with discomfort
rather than chuckle.</P>
<P>The story revolves around a disgruntled butler named
Willard (Norm MacDonald) and a dognapping scheme gone
awry.  Willard has been toiling for fifteen years as a
butler for the miserly Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch). 
Crock is a wealthy pastry mogul who lavishes her dog
with a lifestyle fit for a king.  But for anything and
anyone else, she's a mean-spirited tightwad.  She
seems especially put off by Willard's request for a
new butler suit.  His is tattered and frayed.  In
fact, it's the same suit that his father used to wear.
 On Christmas day, when he receives a Crock brand
mincemeat pie, he can no longer stand the humiliation.
 So, with the help of his bumbling friend, Rusty
(David Chappelle), they devise a plan to kidnap
Crock's precious canine.  "I'd bet she pay $1 million
for that sack of fleas," he derisively says.</P>
<P>Of course, criminally inept fools like Willard and
Rusty don't become skilled dognappers overnight. 
Though Willard is intent on revenge, he warns his
friend, "we're not criminals; you fry chicken and I
drive a car."  But then they think about all the
things they can do with that kind of money and are
instantly motivated.  Willard wants to escape to a
tropical paradise.  Rusty, who is more simple-minded,
hopes to laminate the menus in his restaurant.  They
proceed with the dognapping, which they completely
botch.  And then in a twist stranger than bizarre, the
police believe that Willard is the one who is
kidnapped.  Now, the jittery butler must find a way to
'unkidnap' himself and avoid being exposed by a
tough-looking but soft-spoken detective (Daniel
Benzali). </P>
<P>"Screwed" is the kind of mediocre filmmaking that
sacrifices story for hammy acting.  The only likable
character was Miss Crock as the apathetic, crotchety
old woman who debates whether to pay the ransom money
for Willard's release.  The others were just plain
silly, though watching Rusty hit people with desk
lamps might illicit a chuckle or two.  And the story
has the consistency of rice pudding.  The film's
direction saunters from one idea to another, and as a
result, it becomes a melange of half-baked ideas in a
now-you-see-it-now-you-don't kind of way.  The film
starts off as a revenge flick, transforms into a story
where Willard must cover his tracks, and then
ultimately introduces an angle of reconciliation and
forgiveness.  Slowly paced and completely
unremarkable, this film is more than enough to make
you feel screwed.</P>
