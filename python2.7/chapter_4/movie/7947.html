<PRE>                          MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                       A film review by George McAdams
                        Copyright 1997 George McAdams</PRE>
<P>If you are a student of THE BIBLE, you know that every seven years or so a
plague, famine, drought or other disaster is guaranteed to come along to
break-up the monotony of early biblical bliss.  While those who have
watched from a distance the often winding career of Julia Roberts may have
often wondered just when she was going to return from wandering through the
wilderness, "My Best Friend's Wedding" is proof that she has the ability to
act, if not the ability to choose the best vehicles for showing off her
talents.</P>
<P>In this case, it is director P.J. Hogan, "Muriel's Wedding," who is
delivering the message from the mount.  As in "Muriel," he has chosen a
focal point of many wandering soul's lives, a wedding, to cause the
characters to examine whether their own happiness is dependent on another.</P>
<P>Let me make no false prophesy here, this is Julia Roberts' movie, and while
other disaster turns in her career the past seven years could have been
explained away on dubious personal choices, with this film she reminds us
that she still is the actress that made the audience cry in "Steel
Magnolias" and half of an audience dream of a Prince Charming in "Pretty
Woman."  </P>
<P>In "My Best Friend's Wedding, Julia, playing food critic Julianne, hears
from her best friend, an ex-lover played unremarkably by Demot Mulroney as
Michael O'Neal, that he is getting married in four days and wants her at
his wedding. Complicating this simple story line is Julianne's realization
that she has grown to love Michael over the nine years since they broke-up.</P>
<P>While the choice of Mulroney as Robert's love interest may cause several
movie viewers to scratch their heads, he neither makes, nor does he break,
the movie, as he underplays his role.  But, isn't that the point of this
movie?  After all, it's Julia acting happy and delightful that will fill
the theaters.</P>
<P>Further complications arise when Julianne meets his fiance, played by
Cameron Diaz, and finds her to be sweet, lovely, open and honest:  the four
qualities that Julianne has decided to avoid as she tries to put a wedge
between the happy couple. Not since the openhanded conniving attempts by
Katherine Hepburn in "Bringing up Baby," has there been such welcomed
chicanery.</P>
<P>Topping-off the performance by Ms. Roberts is the scene-stealing
performance by Rupert Everett as George, her gay editor, who masquerades as
Julianne's fianc. The Ronald Bass screenplay correctly adds George to the
mix every so often, like a hot tea drinker who continues to dunk the tea
bag in the hot water: you aren't quite sure if the tea is getting much out
of your effort, but it sure looks darker, and everyone knows that darker
tea is never weak.</P>
<P>"My Best Friend's Wedding" receives three stars as a welcome picture amidst
all of the action grabbing super hero flicks out there. I would see it
again and recommend it to everyone. </P>
