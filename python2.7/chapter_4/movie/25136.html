<P>Back in 1971, "Shaft" was a revolutionary film - it introduced an
African-American hero who bed countless women a la James Bond and
could be as mean and relentless as most other private detectives, such
as Philip Marlowe. Not just that, the film also showed an
African-American who preened and walked the streets as if he owned
them. He meant business and held no prisoners - a true fighting
machine. The other significance of "Shaft" is that it launched the
blaxploitation genre with popular hits such as "Superfly" and "Foxy
Brown." Though the genre eventually died out, it resurged somewhat
with Tarantino's take "Jackie Brown" in 1997 and now the Samuel
L. Jackson revisionist take by director John Singleton. With Jackson
in the title role and a super cool, sleek style, this new "Shaft"
delivers.</P>
<P>Jackson is Shaft, though he does not replacing the original actor,
Richard Roundtree. Instead, he plays his nephew and Roundtree is back
reprising his famous role, now a weary uncle who still has his way
with women. This new Shaft is also not a private detective but a New
York City cop (watch out Guiliani). At the start of the film, he is
investigating a racist yuppie, Walter Wade Jr.  (Christian Bale, in
his "American Psycho" mode), who killed an African-American man (Meki
Phifer) in cold blood.  Wade gets away scot-free and is deported to
Switzerland. Meanwhile, Shaft, sensing a gross injustice, quits the
police force. He does so in an unbelievably funny scene where he
tosses his badge across a courtroom as if it was a Chinese star. There
are various comic-book moments like this, especially when a runaway
drug dealer breaks through one building window and lands safely on the
other side by breaking through another building window. Jackson's
reaction makes the scene priceless!  .</P>
<P>Several years later, Shaft is still pursuing Wade and finds a way of
trapping him. Apparently, Wade has employed a Dominican coke dealer,
Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), to kill a scared bartender (Toni
Collete), the sole witness who can pinpoint Wade to the murder. The
price is $40,000 for the hit, but of course Shaft tries to obtain the
cash and succeeds leading to a series of double-crosses, car chases
and lots of violence.  In other words, what else do you expect from an
action picture, right? True, but it is rare to see a fun, exciting,
truly spirited action picture like this one, and Jackson makes it more
so with his titanic presence and his unduly sarcasm.</P>
<P>Director John Singleton stages the car chase scenes with such panache
that it almost supersedes the similar velocity of car stunts in
"Ronin." They somehow feel new again, and the reason is in the
character development and the less-is-more policy. Most action
pictures overdose on action paranoia (see "Lethal Weapon 4") but this
Shaft proves to be a strong, durable hero with more than enough reason
for payback - he is no angry cartoon like Mel Gibson's Riggs. Shaft
shows no fear and little mercy, especially when roughing up a couple
of teen gang members or using Bale as a punching bag. "Oh, you are
firing me, for that?", as he knocks Bale out yet again.</P>
<P>The villains are also very effective - the golden rule in any action
flick is that the villains must be threatening and scary. "Mission:
Impossible 2" is a bad example of providing a villain that would not
even scare Barney the Dinosaur. In "Shaft", we have two villains, both
a major match for the hero. Bale as the mean, racist, impulsive Wade,
and the near-stereotypical yet vibrant turn by Jeffrey Wright (yes,
the same guy from "Basquiat") as the smooth Peoples who wants to use
Wade's clientele to up the ante on his drug sales. There is one tense,
frighteningly real scene where Peoples lets his emotional guard down
when he finds his brother dead - he literally stabs himself in protest
and sheer anger. Powerful stuff that you rarely see in a movie of this
type.</P>
<P>"Shaft" is not a great movie simply because the plot is too mediocre
to inspire much excitement (corrupt cops, drug couriers, etc.) but its
style is several notches above the original classic. One other minor
quibble is that I would loved to have seen more of Collette, who plays
a largely underdeveloped character. Still, I am no big fan of the
original "Shaft" but this new film has the spark and vivid persona of
Samuel L. Jackson to make up for everything else. He is the man, and I
can dig it.</P>
