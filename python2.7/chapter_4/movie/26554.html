"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I'm not the kind of person that tries to push films that I enjoy on
people who don't have any interest in that particular cinematic genre.
Even though I loved it, I won't insist that a friend who hates tedious
science fiction films see 2001.  If you're a homophobe who hates foreign
cinema, I'm not going to needle you until you see Water Drops on Burning
Rocks.</P>
<P>The Legend of Drunken Master is a rare exception to my rule. Everybody
should see this film, even if you hate martial arts pictures. Master is
often referred to as the Citizen Kane of its genre, and its intoxicating
fight sequences are second to none – including The Matrix and the
upcoming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan (Shanghai Noon) stars as Wong Fei-hong, the rebellious son
of an important doctor during some nameless Chinese period.  As the film
opens, Fei-hong accidentally switches a package with somebody else on a
crowded train.  Instead of coming home with ginseng root for one of his
father's patients, he ends up with an ancient jade seal (a macguffin?).
The missing ginseng root becomes the source for many of the film's
laughs, while the seal lands Fei-hong and his whole family in a world of
trouble.</P>
<P>It turns out that the seal was supposed to be delivered to a devious
group of baddies who are helping a moustache-twirling Brit steal ancient
Chinese artifacts (read: cultural robbery).  Fei-hong becomes wrapped up
in their Machiavellian plot and finds himself on the receiving end of a
very large beating.</P>
<P>But Fei-hong is no slouch when it comes to fighting.  He embraces a
style of combat called `drunken boxing,' in which you stumble around
like you've just done a dozen shots of Jager and then, theoretically,
beat the snot out of your enemies.  In Master, drunken boxing works
better when you've actually consumed a bunch of alcohol.  Supposedly,
this style makes the body more relaxed and flexible, while it also
increases the body's pain threshold.  Unfortunately, his father (Lung
Ti, A Better Tomorrow) forbids both fighting and drinking, and Fei-hong
finds himself cast out after one particular binge of drunken battle.</P>
<P>Chan does a great job of pounding down alcohol like a Conehead and then
shouting out the names of each of his drunken moves as he performs
them.  The physical role is an obvious nod to Chan's hero, Buster
Keaton.  Like his other films, Chan performs all of his own stunts,
including a couple of amazing fight sequences in very tight quarters
(under a train and under a table).  One scene has him fending off an
entire army of ax-wielding henchmen, and the twenty-minute finale (which
took four months to film) is an incredible blend of Chan's unmatched
martial arts skills and fearless stunt work.</P>
<P>Master was released in Asia in 1994, and it has, unfortunately, been
dubbed into English for its American release.  Originally titled Drunken
Master 2, the film is actually a sequel to one of Chan's earlier films
released in 1979.  The character of Fei-hong is somewhat of a Paul
Bunyan-like legend in China, and the character has been portrayed in a
five film series called Once Upon a Time in China (Jet Li played the
role in the fourth film).</P>
<P>Another highlight is the performance of Anita Mui (Rumble in the Bronx),
who plays Fei-hong's hysterical stepmother (Chan appears to be older
than both actors portraying his parents).  Master is the fourth release
this month to have the main character(s) sing a song at some point
during the narrative (following Ladies Man, Remember the Titans and
Dancer in the Dark).</P>
<P>Master was directed by Chia-Liang Liu, who won the prestigious trophy
for Best Choreography at the Hong Kong Film Awards.  The film was
written by Kai-Chi Yun (A Chinese Ghost Story) and first-timer King-Sang
Tseng.  Like most of Chan's films, the closing credits contain outtakes
of stunts gone bad, which is a reminder of how amazing and effortless
they appear in the film.</P>
<P>1:42 - R for violence and lots of binge drinking</P>
