<PRE>Nobody's Ideal Woman
Flawless</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>These days, De Niro seems to be seeking out scripts with challenging twists
to his tough guy persona. "Analyze This" (earlier in the year) portrayed him
as a Mafia boss, who in search of meaning to his criminal life, enlists the
reluctant help of the comical psychologist Billy Crystal. In "Flawless," De
Niro plays retired hero cop Walt Koontz: strong, suave, and staunchly
homophobic. Walt soon suffers a stroke, prompting him ever-so-reluctantly to
take singing lessons (therapy) from his cross-dressing neighbor down the
hall. The relationship between these two (ahem) men, is the nugget of gold
that gives "Flawless" its appeal.</P>
<P>But there's plenty of less glittering film around this golden center. A
"Starsky and Hutch"-like drug/money drama weaves in and out lasting for
weeks and months without resolution -- until the end. Surprisingly, this,
essentially warm buddy film, wraps up with an action sequence. Farcical, out
of place, but not terribly destructive, the climax plays more off the good
humor of the writer/director than the vicious potential of the bad guys.</P>
<P>Though quiet brashly amusing, the drag-queen entourage overdoes the costume
parade at times. It's a rough, yet playful film with endearing moments,
where both hetero's and gays are cherished and ribbed.</P>
