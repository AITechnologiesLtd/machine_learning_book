<PRE>                                Air Force One
                       A film review by Hanson Yoo
                       Copyright 1997 Hanson Yoo</PRE>
<P>Gosh, it feels like I've seen this movie before – and there's a very good
reason.  Air Force One is yet another "Die Hard on a…" movie – but to be fair,
it turns out better than the others because it sticks closer to the original Die
Hard formula than the others.  Does this sound familiar?  A team of terrorists
takes over, one lone unidentified man strikes back at them one by one while his
wife is held captive, and someone dies because the hero won't reveal his
identity to them.  Yes, there are some other wrinkles thrown in for good
measure, but it's basically the old same old with a glossy new paint job.  Yet
it's difficult to say the movie will fail to please because the formula is so
robust.</P>
<P>Harrison Ford is the President of the United States and Gary Oldman is the
terrorist, and they duke it out on the Presidential plane.  That's really all
you need to know, since the supporting characters are props for the plot, which
is straight from Die Hard.  For those who haven't seen Die Hard, rent it.  It's
a superior film.     </P>
<P>The biggest problem with Air Force One is its lack of any real originality – you
know what's going to happen because the plot never deviates from its
predecessors.  Without this element of suspense, the movie just doesn't deliver
real thrills.  One good thing the movie has going for it is some semblance of
restraint – in any other movie of it's ilk, the one-liners would have been
flying.  When Ford hits the first terrorist with a chair, you can almost hear
him say, "Have a seat."  But he doesn't.  However, the temptation is apparently
too great – he eventually tells Gary Oldman to, "Get off my plane," during their
final fight on the plane's rear exit with the kind of teeth gritted earnestness
that is Harrison Ford's forte.  I can forgive them this one transgression, I
suppose.</P>
<P>There are also elements that just don't work.  Oldman's ultra-nationalistic
terrorist philosophy falls flat.  Preach on brother, but do it in a different
movie.  It's given lip service without any substance, with only one line having
any real impact (he explains that Americans tolerated the killing of thousands
of Iraqis just to, "save a nickel on a gallon of gasoline."  Great line).  But
all in all the political angle is just a coat of varnish – it makes everything
shinier, but it's ultimately transparent.  </P>
<P>Another problematic element is the first daughter – there's simply no reason for
her to be held captive other than to have a child in peril and to mimic the
structure of the real First Family.  I find the prior distasteful.  Ford's
character cares enough about his wife to need a daughter in peril as well.  </P>
<P>Even the things that should work aren't executed well.  The charm of Die Hard
was watching Willis scheme and plan.  He takes notes; he pieces things together.
But Ford simply hides, punches out people, takes their weapons, hides again, and
then shoots them.  There seemed to be no real intelligence applied to his
character.   </P>
<P>And finally, the biggest gaffe is the motive of the Secret Service Agent that
betrays the President.  Why was that of all things left on the cutting room
floor?  The plot is really hollow without it.  </P>
<P>The only saving grace in the movie is Ford's character – he's eminently
Presidential, and the way the good guys to a one sacrifice their lives without
hesitation to save his illustrate how important the President of the United
States really is.  It's a refreshing view of the office that has been lost in
the movies (compare with the previously released Murder at 1600, Nixon, and
Absolute Power), and lost in real life.    </P>
<P>I wish I could have enjoyed Air Force One as much as many others did and many
other will, but I found it too derivative to be anything more than a trifle.</P>
