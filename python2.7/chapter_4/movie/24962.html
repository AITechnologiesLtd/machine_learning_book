<P>"Stir of Echoes" is one of the year's best films, is based on a best selling 
novel, and features Kevin Bacon in one of his most skilful performances. 
Films of this calibre don't often hit our screens. And yet it has arrived 
with little advance buzz and a cheap publicity campaign. Why? Maybe because 
people are still eating up "The Sixth Sense", the ghost story from last year 
that got six Oscar nominations and topped box office charts. "Stir of Echoes" 
shames that silly con trick, matching its spooky atmosphere in every frame, 
and going much further in developing a story.</P>
<P>Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a blue-collar guy from Chicago who one night jokingly 
dares his kooky sister-in-law Lisa (Ileana Douglas) to hypnotise him. "How 
can you believe in all that superstitious crap?" he asks. When Lisa has him 
under, she leaves him with what's known as a Post-Hypnotic Suggestion, 
leaving a message in his brain. She asks him to be more open-minded.</P>
<P>And that he becomes, but not in the way she intended. After Tom wakes up he 
has disturbing visions and feelings of strange sickness, because he's now a 
'receiver' -- a person able to see everything around him, both material and 
supernatural. His son Jake (Zachary David Cope) has always had the gift, and 
tells his father "Don't be afraid of it, daddy." When Tom calms down, and 
tries to make sense of the phenomena going on around him, he realises he's 
being haunted by the ghost of a dead teenage girl who wants him to unearth 
something related to her memory.</P>
<P>There are a lot of plot threads in "Stir of Echoes", all of which somehow 
become related to this girl. But they don't feel like story manoeuvres, they 
feel like atmosphere, because everything is set up through either realistic 
supporting characters or Tom's visions. Things are glimpsed just enough so we 
can mark and remember them, but not so much that we can figure out what 
everything means or is leading up to. While we're watching the movie, all we 
can focus on is the fact that Tom is going through something weird, and I 
found myself shivering, jumping and glaring in disgusted disbelief, as the 
haunting got more serious, tormenting and dominating Tom's life. We see what 
he sees, and it gets under our skin by coming in violent flashes, through 
bizarre angles, colours and speeds.</P>
<P>Disorientating apparitions alone cannot carry a film. Here they are supported 
by a) cinematography whose dark, shady tones walk the line between realistic 
and spooky, so we can never quite relax; and b) a performance of intensity 
from Bacon. He's not always cast in sombre roles, but he's perfect for them 
-- his good looks and sense of humour can always win audiences over, and his 
strong features and hungry face mean that when his character is taking 
something seriously, we do too. In "Stir of Echoes" he plays a man whose head 
gets torn apart, and we're sure as hell let know it.</P>
<P>It's also good to see a picture like this set in a regular neighbourhood; 
usually in these movies only the affluent get ghouls or spirits coming to 
visit. That's one example of the richness of "Stir of Echoes", which is as 
detailed in texture as a novel, and doesn't contain standard movie clichés 
like Tom taking a long time to realise the obvious, or keeping his 
experiences secret from his wife. Consider also the final shot, which is not 
just a cheap scare, but a remembrance of the implications of the story. I 
haven't read the Richard Matheson source material, and in fact perhaps I 
should stop reading books altogether. After all, most of the literary 
adaptations I have enjoyed this year have been based on things I haven't 
read. Then again, maybe this is just a wonderful movie.</P>
