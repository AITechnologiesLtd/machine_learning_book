                        MONDAY MORNING MOVIE WATCHER</PRE>
<P>This is the debut of my film reviews here on this ng. Any portion of it is
considered public domain with attribution, so feel free to post it where
ever. I'm between web page hosts right now, but I will post the new home
for the reviews when I find one.</P>
<P>*NOTE*
"Monday Morning Movie Watcher is an informal review that takes all facets
of the movie experience into effect, including crowd reaction,
anticipation for the film, assorted "hype" surrounding the film, and
ultimately what the box office and overall reaction for the film was after
the initial weekend of release. In other words, I'm not trying to be
Pauline Kael here people, just a product of late 20th century
mass-media pop culture."</P>
<P>"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me" (Released June 11, 1999)</P>
<P>Caught the sequel to Austin Powers at the AMC Academy in Greenbelt, MD.
Since the theater is next door to a college town, my companion and I
caught a late matinee in fear of a sell-out that evening.</P>
<P>Like most AMC theaters, this one relies on a very loud sound system to
compensate for a lack of a dynamic stereo set-up, but I've found it to be
a good place to watch a film.</P>
<P>A fairly large crowd for a Friday matinee rolled in, filling the seats
(and the film's mostly young male demographics) well.</P>
<PRE>THE TRAILERS:</PRE>
<P>"Big Daddy" - The Sandler movie looks to be a jump back towards his
"Wedding Singer" success. Having now seen this trailer a bunch of times, I
have a new concern about the film -- what if the trailer's all its got? </P>
<P>"The Iron Giant" - Very highly anticipated by those in the know, but an
unknown quantity for those in today's audience. I love the design of the
Giant, and the film looks like a nice take on the "boy finds freak" story.
But this may suffer the same fate as every other non-Disney offering. The
reaction from the crowd was less than thrilling. I just can't see kids
getting that enthused over this film after what should be a jolt of
excitement from "Tarzan."</P>
<P>"Detroit Rock City" - a nice trailer that seems to suggest a cross between
"Dazed and Confused" and a road movie. It's got a nice feel to it, looks
good, and might be good nostalgia for those who can remember the 70's. </P>
<P>"Wild Wild West" - Bad, bad, trailer. But the Will Smith song is slowly
selling this thing.</P>
<PRE>THE FILM:</PRE>
<P>It was funny. Very funny. The same kind of funny as "There's
Something About Mary": a few funny scenes sandwiched between hilarious
comedy bits, sprinkled with gobs of gross-out humor.</P>
<P>But not as good as the first one. The shine is off the premise. It played
like "Ace Ventura 2", as a series of "greatest hits" catch phrases
integrated in with new, very funny scenes. </P>
<P>Myers, in writing the new film, seems to have figured out what his
audience deduced from the original: that Dr. Evil, not Austin Powers, is
the interesting, breakout character. So he gives Evil all the good lines
and plays him with twice the veracity as he does Powers.</P>
<P>And that's part of the problem. Myers has boiled the hero down to his
barest parts: (and no, not his twig and berries - his essentials) a series
of catch phrases and mannerisms that seems to be there just to string
along the comedy bits. On the other hand, he's taken the best character of
the first film, Evil, and made him into an over the top parody of...well,
of himself. </P>
<P>Evil was a clever send-up of Donald Plesance's Blofeld from the Bond
pictures, and really every other diabolical enemy. It was a fresh
take on a subject ripe for parody, just as Ace Ventura was a send-up of
super detective/cops.</P>
<P>But just like in "Ace 2," the character is imploded. All of the hilarious
satire on the original subject matter is used for dumbed down laughs. Dr.
Evil is less a insightful parody than he is an over-the-top clown. It's
Wayne Campbell as Dr. Evil, and it's a bit of a let down. After such a
well-crafted character stole the first film, to see him jump out of
character just to ham it up leaves one wondering if Myers had simply
exhausted the subject.</P>
<P>Not to say this ham isn't tasty. Dr. Evil is still the funniest thing in
the film. His lines hold up over the duration of two films (not so Powers)
and he participates in the film's single funniest bit:  The Evils
appearing on Jerry Springer.</P>
<P>As for the new additions to the cast, the most highly anticipated, and
rightfully so, is Mini-Me, Evil's tiny clone. He is worth the hype and
steals every scene he's in. The battle between him and Powers should
enrage little persons advocates, but it is priceless.</P>
<P>The introduction of Mini-Me opens the door for a rel comedic oppertunity
Myers fumbles in the film. Part of the great fun that the original
provided was supplied by the dysfunctional relationship between Dr. and
Scott Evil. Here, the subject of Scott's reaction to and the nature of the
relationship bewteen Dr. Evil and his pint-sized clone. But the family
rift is sqwandered with some "He tried to kill me" jokes and the film's
low-point:  an awkward, completely out-of-character and momentum killing
parody of Will Smith's ode to his son, "Just the two of us." It's another
in a series of examples where Myers has come up with a humerous idea, but
the execution in the film, and the character that is burdened by the gag,
is a letdown.</P>
<P>One concept that seems to work is Myers as Fat Bastard, a really bizarre
creation. A grotesque Scotsman who eats babies. Weird, but funny. This
character lets Myers explore the darker, more obscure side of his humor
that was on display in "So I Married an Ax Murderer" and his less quoted
work on "SNL."</P>
<P>As for Heather Graham, well, she's shagolicious. She literally looks
sexier in each progressive scene, but there simply isn't any chemistry at
all between her and Powers. While Ms. Kennsington and Austin had a bit of
an emotional click, Felicity goes into the relationship worshiping Powers.
With such a lothario as Powers, a little courtship goes a long way towards
building an interesting relationship.</P>
<P>Maybe it's character underdevelopment or just the "american" nature of
Felicity, but something just doesn't click here. We know Austin will end
up with the girl (as Hurley's Ms. Kennsington is hilariously dispatched
early). We just don't know why he would.</P>
<P>Hurley's early withdraweral brings us to another subject I'm a bit unsure
of, and that's Myers' winking acknoledgement that the film's plot is
unnecessessary. Part of the charm of the Bond films is that no matter how
perposterious the scheme of the bad guy, Bond plays it straight, gets the
girl and saves the day. The first film spoofed that by asking why the
villain just doesn't kill the hero. Now, we are told the plot is stupid,
we are told the villain is stupid, and we are stupid to enjoy it all.</P>
<P>But that's where the film falters. It forgets what made the first film so
special:  the relationship between Hurley and Myers, the fish-out-of-water
scenario and the sharp satire of spy films. The film hits all the right
marks, but as the lights cames up, I wiped the tears of laughter from my
eyes and felt the same way I felt after Ace 2, Naked Gun 2 and
Ghostbusters 2: I laughed, I cried, but I didn't see much I didn't catch 
the first time.</P>
<PRE>THE AFTERMATH:</PRE>
<P>The crowd ate it up. The entire experience really did remind me of "Mary"
in the sense that the very funny parts had the audience laughing so loudly
that you miss the next piece of dialogue.</P>
<P>>From the grosses, the country ate it up, dethroning, as many of us thought
it might, "Star Wars" as the top movie in the country. </P>
<P>Next weekend will be interesting. I don't know how much repeat viewing
this one will have. The jokes are pretty obvious, and many are funnier
when you just repeat them in conversation rather than see them on the
screen. </P>
<PRE>Two more thoughts:</PRE>
<P>1. The reviews have ranged all over the place. One thing is certain -
this movie does make you laugh. How hard, or how satisfying the experience
will be, depends on the viewer.</P>
<P>2. Calls have come for this film to be an "R." Idiotic! Double talk
and gross-out humor are squarely a PG-13 characteristic. Let's try and
salvage whatever merit the current ratings system has and not overdue it.</P>
