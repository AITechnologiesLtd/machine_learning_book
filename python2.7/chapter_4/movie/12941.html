<P>I don't say this about many movies, but I am really hoping there's a
sequel to The Truman Show.  The concept of the movie (in case you missed
the commercials and the trailers) is that Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is
the star of the world's most popular TV show -- where his whole entire
life is being filmed and broadcast worldwide to a slack-jawed group of
voyeurs, 24 hours a day, around the clock.  At the end of the movie -- I
promise you, I'm not giving away any plot points -- Truman reaches the
end of the impossibly gigantic soundstage and leaves forever.</P>
<P>And wouldn't that be a cool sequel?  You have this man who has been
trapped in a 1950's sitcom hell for his whole entire life.  He escapes
to find that he's monumentally popular, but with no idea whatsoever how
to function in normal life.  Hey, it might not be that great, but it
would probably be better than The Truman Show.</P>
<P>The heart of The Truman Show is the show-within-a-show that's broadcast
via satellite on one of those 500 channels we're all supposed to have
one day.  We see a lot of the TV show in the movie.  In fact, great big
chunks of the movie appear in what might be called Trumanvision -- from
hidden cameras placed in odd or oblique places.  (Would they really need
a camera in the back of a vending machine?)  Truman Burbank is an
insurance salesman (we never see him do a lick of work, though) who
lives a thouroughly hum-drum, drab and normal life on an island off the
Florida coast which he can never leave.  The most colorful thing about
him is his clothes -- tweed jackets worn over sweaters worn over
brightly colored striped shirts, with odd-looking plaid casual wear --
all presumably available for purchase in the Truman Show catalogue.</P>
<P>The mantra of sitcom creation is that your characters have to be
likeable.  I don't myself agree with this approach -- see Seinfeld and
the better British comedies for examples -- but its the path that the
creators of The Truman Show have taken.  Truman is utterly, totally,
likeable in every way, and it's just disgusting.  You'd think that with
Carrey playing the role of Truman, there's be some satiric comic edge to
the character -- but there just isn't for most of the movie.  There just
doesn't seem to be enough comedy or drama in the script to sustain the
TV show as entertainment.  We see people around the world caught up in
the show -- there's even a theme bar for some reason -- but with no
understanding of how or why anyone would be able to watch the show.  And
because the TV show takes up so much of the movie's running length, the
movie ends up being flat and unentertaining as well.</P>
<P>The Truman Show, like any poorly-written TV-show, suffers from what
might be called Jessica Fletcher's Disease.  Anyone who's watched
Murder, She Wrote can tell you about this evil sickness:  there'll be a
point in the plot where the murderer is supposedly unmasked, and Angela
Lansbury will say, "Well, there's still something bothering me."  What's
bothering her, of course, is that there's still twenty minutes left to
the end of the show.  Just as Murder, She Wrote must end with the
murderer being caught, The Truman Show must end with Truman figuring out
his predicament and escaping.  Which it does, but it takes forever, and
there isn't much of anything along the way to compensate for the long,
drawn out ending.</P>
<P>You want comedy?  Well, outside of Truman's wardrobe, there isn't much
of that.  Carrey has a couple of moments where he's loopily staring into
the hidden camera behind his bathroom mirror, and he has a frenzied
escape-attempt scene that looks like it was penciled in to showcase his
manic style briefly.  Laura Linney plays Truman's wife, Meryl, whose
frozen-faced features highlight her role as part-time wife, part-time
infomercial hostess:  she's funny, if you think annoying is funny.</P>
<P>You want drama?  There's a couple of decent dramatic scenes in The
Truman Show, but they don't seem to mesh.  Without giving away plot
points, they come one right on top of the other and involve major
changes in his family structure.  We jump from this to an interview with
Ed Harris, the show's creator, who interjects a long defense of the show
and his place as Truman's protector.  And then we jump back to the
show... which continues as before, with Truman seemingly unaffected by
all the turmoil in his life in the past twelve hours.</P>
<P>If there's no comedy, and little drama, why see The Truman Show?  Maybe
there's a message or something, like there was in writer/producer Andrew
Niccol's previous work, the lifeless genetic fantasy Gattaca.  In
Gattaca, like The Truman Show, Niccol comes up with a great movie
concept but does a lackluster job of fleshing it out and making it
real.  As Gattaca plods on to its inevitable resolution, it leaves us
with a message -- don't discriminate against people based on their
genetic coding.  Fair enough.  The message from The Truman Show is...
what?  It's not nice to imprison people on soundstages and transmit
their lives?</P>
<P>I know there are people out there who loved this movie.  Fine.  I'm glad
you enjoyed it.  Me, I'm waiting for the sequel, and I hope that it's
better than The Truman Show.  It would almost have to be.</P>
