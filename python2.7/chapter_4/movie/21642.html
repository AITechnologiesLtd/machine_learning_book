At first glance, THREE KINGS looks to be just another war movie, the 90s
version of all those favourite war movies with names I cannot remember. The
90s version, it definitely is, just another war movie? Not in your dreams!
Imagine PULP FICTION approach to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, thats THREE KINGS for
you. Believe it or not, it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane
meaning of the latter.
The story brings us to the twilight of the Gulf war, with the allied troops
victorious. Majpr Archie Gates (Clooney) leads an enterprising bunch of
grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree; the millions in gold
bars secretly stowed away by Saddam in a desolate village in the desert. As
the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be
shipped home, this `wild bunch goes AWOL on an armed Hum-Vee (the vehicle
of choice of the US army). They soon find out that they have much
resistance, as they get tangled with the local rebellion against Saddams
forces. Frequently switching their modes between looters and Robin Hoods
Merry Men, they become consciously attacked by their own morals.
As the film begins to roll, it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it.
`Special effects such as when Gates describes to his men how a bullet can
kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie. THREE
KINGS is much smarter than that. As the conflict becomes more and more
complex, the audience will be trapped in a limbo, trying to stay focussed on
that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray. I personally
found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in
the film; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own
sense of humanity. This simply made the entire experience of watching THREE
KINGS truly brilliant.
Action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything
like Steven Spielbergs in-your-face war violence. They are carefully built
to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses, right
before the action starts. Not John Woo for sure but more of Sergio Leones
Spaghetti western style (tons of them starring Clint Eastwood). Great
performances by Clooney and Wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the
conception of this film; the screenwriter and the director.
THREE KINGS ranks among the best films of the year, well, for me at least.
Highly recommended.</P>
