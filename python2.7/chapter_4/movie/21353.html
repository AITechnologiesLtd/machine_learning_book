<P>Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter. Rated R.</P>
<P>Pre-release buzz is not directly proportionate to film quality. Take
two recent films, for example: The Blair Witch Project and Fight Club.
Both were hyped tremendously; the former was touted as the scariest
film of all time while the latter was supposedly a sure-fire Oscar
contender. Well, all I can say is no frickin' way. Blair Witch,
contrary to what some cretins claimed, was barely even creepy and Fight
Club, well...</P>
<P>It is exceedingly difficult to give a brief synopsis of the plot, which
is busy and convoluted, becoming less and less linear as it rambles
along. I'll wind up describing it in detail, so if you don't want that
much information you might as well skip the next three paragraphs.
Consider yourself warned. ¦ For those of y'all who have decided to
remain for my makeshift plot description, listen carefully. We meet
Jack (Edward Norton), the man who is to guide us through the rest of
the movie. Jack is a troubled soul, an insomniac who takes solace in
going to support groups he doesn't belong to, just so he can cry and
get his true feelings out. He is hampered by his soul-deadening job and
joyless existence; he spends his free time trying to figure out which
piece of Ikea merchandise defines him as a person.</P>
<P>Everything changes in one weird day. On a plane he meets Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt), an angry-at-the-world soap salesman who leaves an
impression on him. When he returns to his condo, he finds that it has
exploded. How no one seems to know. For some reason, he calls up Tyler,
who agrees to let Jack stay with him at his old, beaten-up shack of a
home. In the parking lot one day, Tyler encourages Jack to hit him as
hard as he can. This leads to a fight. Before Jack knows it, he and
Tyler have started an underground fight club, in which men like Jack
(i.e. opressed by society) can take their anger out by kicking the crap
out of others. Jack and Tyler make up rules, homework assignments and
the like and their endeavor becomes unexpectedly popular, with
franchises reportedly starting up all over the country.</P>
<P>Before long, the fight club turns into "Project Mayhem," a sinister
organization of brainwashed drones all working toward a secret goal
unknown to Jack. Jack wants out, but is he in too deep?</P>
<P>My main problem with Fight Club is that its mood and screenplay suggest
an important film with something socially significant to say when in
reality it's paper-thin stuff. It's alleged message about men following
their primal instincts crumbles and falls apart when subjected to the
slightest of scrutiny. In fact, what this film tries to say is
prepostrous: men are "womanized" by Ikea and office work and respond by
releasing their suppresed anger in the form of violence. Is the movie
glorifying this?</P>
<P>Just because the film is hollow doesn't mean it's bad. But to be
worthwhile without being significant means that it has to be a viable
thriller. It's a diverting one because of its offbeat tone and pacing,
but it isn't good. Plot elements make no sense, especially when the
film's big secret is revealed. There is a similarity to The Sixth Sense
in the surprise ending, but that film made it work because it remained
consistent while Fight Club's ending does nothing but create plot holes
big enough to drive a Zamboni through.</P>
<P>One thing I can wholeheartedly praise in Fight Club is the
performances, which are outstanding. Edward Norton once again proves
his ability to mold into any role given to him. Brad Pitt, at last, has
the opportunity to impress us and he capitalizes. I've never liked the
actor; I always thought that he made his characters dull and
uninteresting with his mannerisms. Here, he is effectively menacing in
a bizarre role, clearly trying to make the most of a chance to revive
his lackluster career (he hasn't had a hit since Se7en).</P>
<P>This is an engrossing, entertaining movie, original, visually kinetic
and viscerally exciting. But you can show me as many weird and creative
styles and ideas as you want, if you have nothing to say you result
remains nothing more than a cheeky game, a piece of subversive nothing.</P>
