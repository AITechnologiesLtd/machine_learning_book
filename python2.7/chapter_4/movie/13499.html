<PRE>Review: The Mask Of Zorro</PRE>
<P>Starring: Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta Jones, Stuart Wilson, Matt Letscher</P>
<PRE>Directed by Martin Campbell
Approx Running time : 140 min</PRE>
<P>There are some moments in Zorro that make you feel like a kid
again. That is, if you recall ever liking Zorro. The duels, the
mysterious mask, the passion and the action all are present in Zorro's
latest reincarnation, The Mask Of Zorro. But these moments are
surrounded by nearly two and a half hours of really arduous
story-telling.</P>
<P>This story, starting in the early 1820's Mexico spans 20 years. The
first scene establishes that the Zorro of the time (Don Diego, played
by Hopkins) is a freedom fighter out for peace and justice. But when
his nemisis, the governer of Mexico, kills Zorro's wife and takes his
baby daughter for his very own, Zorro disappears. (Which is easy when
you're in prison.) After 20 years, he breaks out and takes on a lowly
but talented theif, Alejandro, played by Banderas, as a pupil. One of
the governer's captains killed Alejandro's brother. So now there are
two Zorro's who seek revenge.</P>
<P>There is a near-pointless side plot that involves the heavies
attempting to buy California with gold stolen from there. It provides
for a few James Bondian bad guy scenes (the head honcho standing
around a huge table addressing the other baddies, while standing in
front of a map, talking about world domination.) But really only makes
for a setting for the final showdown.</P>
<P>Zorro has as many highs as it does lows. First off, watching Antonio
Banderas is a delight. He is as funny as he is heroic and devilishly
handsome. He does some fantastic stunts with the sword, and still,
throughout his heroism, he manages to play the buffoon from time to
time.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins, sadly, phones in his performance. Though he too is
enraged at the evil-doings (and has more of a vendetta than Banderas'
character) his eyes never change. He never shows the passion that has
driven his character for 20 years. Aside from that, he is the only
Mexican (well, former Spaniard) that speaks with a British
accent. Which is a shame, too, since Hopkins is brilliant at masking
his voice.</P>
<P>And then there is Catherine Zeta Jones. This newcomer to American
cinema manages to steal every scene she is in. Partly because she is
one of the most strikingly beautiful women I've ever seen on the
silver screen. But there is a tenderness that she brings to her
character. She plays the love-interest for Alejandro, and is the only
person in the film that can out-do Banderas' fine performance in each
of their scenes together. The Welsh actress also hides her accent
quite well, adopting a Spanish one. (Strange, though, that she plays
Hopkin's daughter and yet...)</P>
<P>The action in Zorro doesn't disappoint, but it is sparce. The film is
so overlong that characters seem to pop up out of nowhere just to keep
it going. I kept asking myself, "now, why would she be there at this
time?" or "where the hell did he come from? And why is he here?" I was
never satisfied with the drive of the storytelling, the primary fault
of director Campbell. The cuts from scene to scene often left me with
a sour taste.</P>
<P>Aside from two of the lead performances, the big winner in Zorro is
the Art direction. The sets are out of this world, particularly
Zorro's training lair. The film is beautiful, no doubt, but it just
can't quite hit the mark, even if you do care about some of the
characters relationships in the film, as I did.</P>
