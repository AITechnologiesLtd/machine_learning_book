<PRE>                                   FARGO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a real winner of a crime film
          from the Coen Brothers.  It has some violence, a
          little comedy, and a fair amount of realism in this
          story of the ever-widening chaos that results from
          a mock kidnapping.  The story is structured a lot
          like an episode of "Columbo" with Frances McDormand
          as a pregnant police chief whose kindergarten
          teacher mannerisms and attitudes conceal a razor-
          sharp mind.  Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Joel and Ethan Coen have gone slightly eccentric in their last two
films.  With the exception of some work with Sam Raimi, they initially
came to the public's attention with BLOOD SIMPLE in 1984.  Since then
they made RAISING ARIZONA, MILLER'S CROSSING, BARTON FINK, and THE
HUDSUCKER PROXY.  One after another was both a popular and critical
success.  But THE HUDSUCKER PROXY was just a little too weird, like a
surreal, cartoonish imitation of Frank Capra films, and it was their
first critical failure.  To prove that they still have what it takes
they have returned with a film similar in style to BLOOD SIMPLE with
the same realistic approach but with more style.  FARGO is likely to be
a real winner for the Coen Brothers.</P>
<P>     Our story takes place in Minnesota and North Dakota.  Jerry
Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy) is an unsavory wheeler-dealer
who cheats on every human transaction he can manage, sometimes a
little, sometimes a lot.  As the film opens he is arranging to have his
wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) kidnapped so his wealthy father-in-law will
pay the ransom.  Lundegaard expects to split the ransom with the
kidnappers and have the money for a land deal.  Hired for the job are
two thugs, the irascible Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and the quiet
but violent Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare).  Once the kidnapping has
taken place things get out of hand.  Police chief Marge Gunderson
(Francis McDormand) gets involved investigating.</P>
<P>     In a film of interesting characterizations, McDormand's Gunderson
stands out.  It is strange to see a pregnant woman as a police chief.
It is even stranger to find a police chief with cloying over-
enthusiastic mannerisms as if she is teaching Ding-Dong School.  She is
the sort of woman who answers a simple how- are-you? with "I'm doing
REALLY SUPER!"  But put her at the scene of a crime and that is just
what she does, super.  In moments she has a sophisticated forensic
analysis.  Her straight-arrow approach is in stark contrast to the
habitually scamming character played by William H. Macy, everybody's
worst nightmare of a car salesman.  Somewhat more familiar is Buscemi's
irascible and nasty smalltime hood getting a shot at bigger things.
But the Coen Brothers have a talent for creating memorable characters
even from people in small walk-on parts.  A cashier with an odd smile
and a rubber-faced prostitute each make unexpectedly interesting camera
studies.</P>
<P>     And not just the characters are interesting.  Even a lunch pulled
from a buffet adds texture to the film.  Joel Coen gambles he can make
interesting some unconventional subjects of shots and more often than
not he is right.  The Coen Brothers seem to have wanted to make a real
document of life in a deep, cold Minnesota winter.  It is as if the two
Texas-born filmmakers wanted to get it all on film once so they would
never have to return.  It is hard to blame them.  The cold of the snowy
environment pervades the whole film.  People are walking through snow,
constantly tripping, trying to get to their cars and scrape
windshields.  People talk to each other from inside cave-like fur
hoods.</P>
<P>     Carter Burwell's score works, but seems strangely unconventional.
The main theme sounds more appropriate for some sort of historical
epic, though perhaps it could also fit the epic struggle of against the
elements in the cold Northern winter.  This is a film with some heavy
violence and some good humor.  (One of the best laughs is in the
closing credits.  Be warned, early risers.)  Also notice that there
seems to be a little study of how different people use and react to
profanity.  This is an audience-pleaser that rates a high +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
