"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Based on a 75-minute short from 1992, Meet the Parents is an
entertaining look at the harrowing experience of meeting your
girlfriend's father for the first time.  Or, if you're a girl, the
equally harrowing experience of having your boyfriend meet your father
for the first time.  It's certainly enjoyable, but the film would have
been a lot more so if the majority of the funny bits weren't given away
in the trailer.</P>
<P>Ben Stiller (Keeping the Faith) plays Greg Focker, an E.R. nurse from
Chicago who is head-over-heels in love with a schoolteacher named Pam
Byrnes (Teri Polo, Felicity).  Parents begins with Greg rehearsing the
marriage proposal to his beloved, but when the time comes, the special
moment is interrupted by a phone call from Pam's sister, Debbie.  She
announces that she's engaged and will be married in two weeks, but the
best part of all is that her future husband had the good sense to ask
for her father's permission first.</P>
<P>A quick thinker, Greg palms the engagement ring he was about to give to
Pam, and the two take off for Oyster Bay, Long Island, the location of
Debbie's wedding and the home of Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro,
The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle and Blythe Danner, Forces of
Nature).  Greg plans on winning over Pam's dad and getting the green
light to pop the question to his eldest daughter.</P>
<P>But things immediately begin to spin out of control for poor Greg.
First the airline loses his luggage.  Then Pam tells him that he's not
allowed to smoke in front of her dad (it's a sign of weakness).  The big
surprise comes when Greg meets Jack for the first time.  Despite the
fact that he's a cat-loving, poetry-writing, Peter-Paul-and-Mary-singing
old man that uses baby talk to communicate with Pam (he calls her
`Pam-cakes'), Jack instantly becomes suspicious of his potential
son-in-law.  He makes fun of Greg's name and his occupation within
minutes of his arrival.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, Pam's ex-fiancé (Owen Wilson, Shanghai Noon) is
the best man at Debbie's wedding.  But things take an even more
disturbing turn for Greg when he finds out that Jack isn't really a
retired florist but an ex-CIA agent with the uncanny ability to tell if
people are lying (this is also revealed in the trailer).  Greg is like a
car stuck in the mud – the harder he spins his tires to get free from
Jack's bad side, the deeper he makes his hole.</P>
<P>Greg commits one hysterical social faux pas after another, ultimately
ruining Debbie's wedding.  There are a lot of well-timed set-pieces, but
the real charm of the film comes from the relationship between Greg and
Jack; the former looking like a deer caught in the headlights, the
latter giving disapproving looks with a perpetually cocked head.</P>
<P>It's hard to imagine anybody but Stiller playing Greg, and only
Christopher Walken could have played DeNiro's role better, and that
would have been a little too frightening.  There is also a very funny
running gag involving Greg's last name (pronounced like it's spelled).
You have to wonder what the MPAA thought about lines like `Jesus,
Focker,' and `Didn't you, Focker?' when a PG-13 movie is only allowed to
use the F-word once.</P>
<P>Parents was directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers) and written by James
Herzfeld (Meet the Deedles) and John Hamburg (Safe Men), who based their
script on the short created by Greg Glienna (who played Greg in the
original) and Mary Ruth Clarke.  The film starts to drag as it
approaches the finale, and the ending is completely predictable.
Despite this, and the fact that the trailer gave too much away, the film
is still very fun and very entertaining.</P>
<P>1:40 – PG-13 for sexual content, drug references and adult language</P>
