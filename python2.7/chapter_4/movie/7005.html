<PRE>                                  THE CRAFT
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>The Craft (1996) * out of ***** - Cast: Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve
Campbell, Rachel True, Cliff De Young.  Directed By: Andrew Fleming.
Running Time: 100 minutes.</P>
<P>Director and co-writer Andrew Fleming is steadily becoming my least
favorite filmmaker.  He made 1988's "Bad Dreams", a horrible rip-off of the
"Nightmare on Elm Street" series.  Then in 1993 he made "Threesome", a very
disgusting film about three college roommates who all end up sleeping
together at the same time.  Now he gives us "The Crap", I mean, "The
Craft".  Actually, there's not much difference.</P>
<P>"The Craft" is all about four freaks, I mean, witches, who live in Los
Angeles.  Say, what better location for witches?  They all attend the same
catholic high school which, of course, is populated with the meanest kids
in the world.  The witches use their witchy powers to take revenge on the
racist girl, the womanizing jock, and to make themselves pretty (actually,
just brushing their hair and taking a shower would have made them pretty).</P>
<P>But, as stories about power go, things tend to get out of hand.  The head
witch Nancy (a scary looking Fairuza Balk) starts to go mad after being
struck by lightning while chanting at the beach.  (Wouldn't you?) She wants
to fly around and kill people, but the good witch Sarah doesn't want any
part of it and leaves the group.  Well, let me tell you that you don't
leave a group of witches, it's
like the mob.  Soon the remaining three witches are casting spells on Sarah
and in the final scenes are trying to kill her.  At this point, who cares?
The last 10 minutes features about a million bugs and snakes, which I
always believe is a ridiculous thing to put into a movie because about 90%
of the audience will turn away from the screen rather than look at bugs.
So making the climax of the film
all about bugs and snakes certainly is brilliant filmmaking.</P>
<P>"The Craft" is obvious from start to finish, with no depth into anything.
It's not even a good "revenge" flick, as the supposed "good" characters are
so stupid and unlikable that you really have no one to root for.  And I
don't blame Andrew Fleming entirely, because I don't think anyone could
have made a good film out of the script.  It's just not a worthwhile story.
