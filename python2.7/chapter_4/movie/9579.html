<PRE>                          PICTURE PERFECT 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
     2 :-) :-)  for picture perfect hair, though not picture perfect
                                character</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jennifer Aniston, Jay Mohr, Kevin Bacon, Olympia Dukakis, Illeana
Douglas, Kevin Dunn Director: Glenn Gordon Caron Screenplay: Arleen
Sorkin & Paul Slansky and Glenn Gordon</P>
<P>This girl says it all with her hair. Ms Aniston, one of T.V.'s popular
"Friends" would otherwise look ordinary without her healthy, silky brown
locks to toss from side to side. With her hair dominating the screen, I
couldn't help but wonder what conditioner or shampoo she uses, or how
her hair feels or smells. I wanted to caress it, comb it, stroke it --.</P>
<P>No matter how perfect Ms Aniston's hair, the same cannot be said about
her character. She plays Kate Mosley, a young advertising executive
seeking opportunity in a family oriented world of business. The boss
wants ties, roots, and loans to bind the person to the company. In order
to succeed Kate needs a picture perfect family. In order to get the
highly prized promotion she is forced to lie.</P>
<P>The lie, "I'm engaged. Here's a photo of the two of us."</P>
<P>The truth, "The guy in the photo is a perfect stranger"</P>
<P>A small lie only leads to a bigger one, when the simple truth would have
been a better option.</P>
<P>Greater love hath no man than one who is willing to humiliate himself
for the love of a woman. Nick (Jay Mohr), the perfect stranger in the
picture is entirely sincere with his love for Kate. His love carries no
lies, no tricks, and no false motives. He is willing to play along with
her self-destructive charade, up to the point where she chooses her
career over him.</P>
<P>Why is it that we can't see the people who really love us for who we are
until it's almost too late? I don't just mean fiancees and lovers, but
also family and friends. When Kate realises her mistake, it takes a big
heart to forgive her for her cruel actions, and an even bigger one to
accept her for her not so picture perfect trimmings.</P>
