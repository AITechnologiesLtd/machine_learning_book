<PRE>ENTRAPMENT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>THE MASK OF ZORRO's Catherine Zeta-Jones firmly establishes her star
power in ENTRAPMENT.  With a dazzling performance, she dominates the
picture with absolute assurance and a bewitching smile.</P>
<P>An actress who breaks the popular mold, she's not a teenager, not
anorexic and not a martial arts master.  An incredibly beautiful
actress, Zeta-Jones has much more than looks going for her.  So
intelligent and likable, she's an action star somewhat like Diana Rigg
in her prime.  Zeta-Jones has delicate, ballet-like movements, but her
strength, which shines through her every frame in ENTRAPMENT, is her
charismatic confidence.  Never has a smile possessed more power.</P>
<P>Cast opposite Zeta-Jones is someone of equal intelligence, grace, and
looks, Sean Connery.  Although showing his age a bit, he is still a
force to be reckoned with.  Like a chess game between grand masters,
Zeta-Jones and Connery match wits and savoir-faire.  With great
chemistry together, they engage in an acting battle that is as
mesmerizing as the story itself.  In the end, the old pro is outclassed
by the younger rival, she's 30, but both do themselves proud, delivering
wonderful performances.</P>
<P>As we meet Virginia "Gin" Baker (Zeta-Jones), a crackerjack insurance
investigator, she is hot on the trail of Robert "Mac" MacDougal
(Connery), whom she suspects has just pulled off a daring skyscraper
robbery of an expensive painting.  She's been following him for 5 years
now.  Her boss (Will Patton) maligns Mac's skills, saying, he's
"60-years-old -- he ain't no spring chicken."  Still, Gin is convinced
that Mac did it and gets herself sent to London to set up a trap.</P>
<P>As directed by Jon Amiel (COPYCAT) and written by Ronald Bass (RAINMAN
and BLACK WIDOW) and Michael Hertzberg, the movie concentrates as much
energy on the relationships as the action.  The action is imaginative
and exciting, but it can't compare with the human drama.  Zeta-Jones
steals every scene no matter how suave Connery acts, and he delivers an
excellent performance that is his best in years.  The story contains
several surprising twists, some of which you'll probably guess and
others which you won't.  Your enjoyment of the picture doesn't depend on
your being fooled.  The movie will be just about as entertaining even if
you figure out every turn in advance.</P>
<P>Some movies get tripped up by their implausibility, while others thrive,
even if one must suspend disbelief.  ENTRAPMENT is in the latter
category.  In fact, implausibility can sometimes prove an advantage.
While on the job, Gin sleeps in the nude with make-up that lasts the
night.  Although all we get to see is her backside, she certainly has an
exceptional one.</P>
<P>Gin tries to convince Mac that she is a thief and has a big job that
requires his help.  Mac sizes her up right away.  "Has there ever been
anyone you couldn't manipulate, beguile or seduce?" he asks with a
twinkle in his eye.  Without need for thought, she replies with a simple
"no," giving him one of her million dollar smiles in the process.</P>
<P>As Mac's smart-mouthed assistant, Ving Rhames provides much of the
story's humor.  It's a small part, but Rhames manages to make it seem
larger.  The film's only disappointment is Maury Chaykin, who plays a
Jabba the Hutt clone that should have been eliminated as a bad
distraction from what is otherwise a completely satisfying narrative.</P>
<P>If Zeta-Jones continues improving at her current rapid rate of
acceleration, by her next movie, Jan De Bont's THE HAUNTING with Liam
Neeson, she should be astounding.</P>
<P>ENTRAPMENT runs 1:54.  It is rated PG-13 for a little violence,
sexuality and profanity and would be fine for kids around 9 and up.  I
would have taken my 10-year-old if I had known how mild it was.</P>
