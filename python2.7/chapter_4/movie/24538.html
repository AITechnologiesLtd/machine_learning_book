<P>Most films that idealize, glorify or emphasize a profession have the
potential to be successful with an audience regardless of whether or not the
crowd is part of that profession. Example: it is rather easy to enjoy films
like `Any Given Sunday,' `For Love of the Game' and `The Color of Money'
despite the fact that the average viewer has never played professional
football, pitched a no-hitter or even ran a pool table. The same could be
applied to films with a more artistic core – `Bullets Over Broadway,'
`Bowfinger' and `This is Spinal Tap' all strike a cord with audiences even
though those audiences have, most likely, never written a play, directed an
independent film or been part of a heavy metal rock group. So it is that we
arrive at `Center Stage,' a film that although oftentimes sexy and dazzling
seems to disprove the above theory. The movie does everything in its power
to be a quality piece, the actors are stellar and the plot is decent enough
to pass in this era of poorly and hastily scrapped together scripts. Yet the
majority of the film's hardcore dance scenes – of which there are many – are
frighteningly unentertaining. The reason: it seems ballet might just be too
isolated an activity for outsiders to understand or be enthusiastic about.</P>
<P>Ironically, it is that very incestuous nature of the art that `Center Stage'
so beautifully depicts. During the course of the two-hour film, there is but
a single outsider who has a prominent role – predictably enough, he faces
rejection en route to ultimate acceptance. All the other figures in the film
are ballet students, instructors or administrators. There is no central
character but rather a handful of equally prominent people that rotate turns
being the center of attention (or, should I say, taking center stage?). All
part of the American Ballet Academy, a very select program at Lincoln
Center, they include Jody (the beautiful and talented Amanda Schull), a
young student striving to make it as a dancer; Cooper (Ethan Stiefel), a
master of the art who literally fled personal problems and must now return
to face them; Maureen (Susan May Pratt), a slightly more experienced pupil
than Jody, who will, during the course of the film, learn that there is more
to life than ballet and how much she hates her mother for forcing her into
being a ballerina (there's a new one!) and Eva (Zoe Saldana), a young girl
seeking direction who will only dance to the point at which she is happy and
doesn't much care if that her gets her anywhere or not (notice, she is the
only person in this film other than the aforementioned outsider who seems to
almost have her priorities in order).</P>
<P>Such misplaced priorities lead to the encouragement of near-anorexia, a
nonchalant attitude by most towards a bulimic character and quotes such as
`I don't want to go to college, I want to dance' being ultimately rewarded.
Furthermore, a sexual encounter that seems mighty improper doesn't quite
receive the wrath it deserves.</P>
<P>Interestingly, though, such sexual side plots could have served to better
the film if further explored. Had the filmmakers been willing to drop the
PG-13 rating and such silly tactics as the infamous `L' shaped covers used
by a couple the morning after an impromptu sexual encounter, the movie might
have taken on an angle that audiences could appreciate in lieu of trying to
decode the innermost workings of a ballet class filled with trade lingo that
might as well be gibberish.</P>
<P>Still, sexual appeal most certainly is not absent from the film. The group
of no-name actors and actresses are all extraordinarily attractive and
talented people that teenybopper crowds will likely take an interest in. No,
there probably is no Leo here, although Amanda Schull certainly could become
a female equivalent, but it is no mistake that the establishing shot of the
film is the number 15 – the picture's target age group.</P>
<P>As the movie draws to a close, the incomprehensible ballet that the audience
has endured actually comes together for a rather enjoyable payoff scene –
after all, anyone can enjoy a ballet recital. Memories of the classic
musical `Fame' will likely come to mind and comparisons are bound to be
drawn. But don't kid yourself, `Center Stage' isn't going to live forever.</P>
