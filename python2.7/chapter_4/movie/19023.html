CAN'T-PUT-DOWN</PRE>
<PRE>THE RED VIOLIN        
Directed by Francois Girard
Screenplay by Girard & Don McKellar
With Samuel L. Jackson, Greta Scacchi
Not Rated      130 min.</PRE>
<P>"The Red Violin" does for the violin what "Babette's Feast" did
for food.  It draws you in with such visual beauty and extravagant
lushness that you lose yourself in the sheer sensual pleasure of it,
even when -- unlike "Babette's Feast" -- it spirals over the top into
Ken Russell territory.  "The Red Violin" is like a can't-put-down
bestseller, enthralling even through its moments of guilty pleasure.</P>
<P>In a 17th century workshop, a master violin-maker (Carlo Cecchi)
crafts his masterpiece: a near-perfect instrument, which he will give
as a gift to the son he is expecting.  His very pregnant wife (Irene
Grazioli) sits in the kitchen of her home and listens to a tarot
reading from her cook.  The future the old woman tells is puzzling,
full of travel, adventure, romance, and danger.  As the movie spins
on, it quickly becomes apparent that some astral wires got crossed;
the predictions aren't for the woman, but the violin.</P>
<P>The film, written by director Francois Girard and actor Don
McKellar (who previously collaborated, along with cinematographer
Alain Dostie, on "32 Short Films About Glenn Gould"), uses as a frame
a Montreal auction house's sale of the legendary Red Violin, so named
for its unusual reddish varnish.  This lost treasure has been recently
rediscovered and authenticated by American expert Charles Morritz
(Samuel L. Jackson).  As the dark-hued instrument hesitantly swings
into view on its auction house panel and tension mounts with the
bidding, the story keeps reaching back to a succession of owners -- an
Austrian monastery, a Viennese child prodigy (6-year-old Christoph
Koncz ), a band of gypsies, a 19th century British virtuoso (Jason
Flemyng) and his passionate mistress (Greta Scacchi, naked again!)
Then it's off to the Mysterious East for this tough little number,
where it languishes in a pawnshop, survives China's Cultural
Revolution, and finally makes its way to our auction in a consignment
of decadent Western instruments put on the block to raise a little
decadent Western currency for the People's Republic.</P>
<P>There are, to be sure, moments of cheesy excess at which you can
only grin -- Flemyng lying nude and stroking the neck of the
instrument protruding from between his legs -- but that's all part of
the fun.  The ending is a bit hard to swallow.  But there are moments
of music so exquisite they make you weep.  The magnificent score is by
John Corigliano, and Joshua Bell performs the violin solos with the
London Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.</P>
<P>"The Red Violin" won't win over all the critics.  But audiences
will love it.  It's a real page-turner.</P>
