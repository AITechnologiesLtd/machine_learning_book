Susan Granger's review of "HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME" (Dimension Films)</PRE>
<P> This is the fourth segment, the first in five years, and the
final episode of the series.  If you're not a die-hard fan, you need
to know some background. The Highlander is an immortal, born centuries
ago in the Scotland. He and the other immortals who walk the earth,
calling themselves "the seed of legend," can be killed only when
beheaded, which usually occurs in a sword-fight with another
immortal. The victor in such a duel gets the "quickening," absorbing
the strength and experience of the defeated amid bolts of lightning.
Morose Christopher Lambert stars, once again, as Connor MacLeod with
Adrian Paul as his protege, Duncan MacLeod, who - this time - go after
Jacob Kell (Bruce Payson), an evil, diabolical, power-hungry immortal
who has gone renegade. Kell's after Connor because, centuries ago,
Connor killed his father, which is understandable since Kell burned
Connor's mother at the stake. Make no mistake, this is a gruesome
group and the recitation of their history is often
contradictory. Plus, Duncan's got this girl-friend (Lisa
Barbuscia). Anyway, both MacLeods are determined that Kell will not be
the last immortal - "In the end, there can be only one." Problem is:
it's disjointed and tiresome. Even the choreography of the
sword-fights is clunky and choppy. Blame that on first-time director
Douglas Aarniokoski. The gimmick is that Lambert, who's starred in the
"Highlander" films, is now teamed with Paul, star of the syndicated TV
series (1992-98). The two, supposedly born 70 years apart in the 16th
century, have appeared together only in the first episode of the TV
series. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Highlander: Endgame"
is a dreadful, time-traveling, almost incomprehensible 2. As they say:
"That's one blessing of immortality - there's always tomorrow."</P>
