<P>   "Lake Placid" comes along just in time, at the very moment
that we need an antidote for the pretentiously arty horror film
that's oddly scaring its youthful audience, "The Blair Witch
Project."  Where "Blair" is dismaying in its dismal naturalism,
"Lake Placid" is filled with just the right measure of special
effects.  Where "Blair" has dialogue which is lamely
improvised, "Placid" has talk which is clever, witty, sharp,
edgy.   The 30-foot Asian crocodile--which plays the role of a
villain that ultimately evokes a surprisingly sentimental
response in the macho men out to blow its head off--comes
from the remarkably authentic-looking digital effects of its
designer Stan "Aliens, Jurassic Park" Winston.  About the
only thing unbelievable about this refreshing entry into
obligatory summer viewing is that Bridget Fonda's character,
Kelly Scott, is dumped by her boss in favor of a co-worker. 
This may provide director Steve Miner and writer David E.
Kelley with the motivation to get the woman out of her New
York office and into rural Maine.  But only a madman could
even think of jettisoning such an individual whose
rejuvenating features and amusingly caustic repartee would
be cherished by any man in possession of his own wits.</P>
<P>   Except for a brief shot of Manhattan's West Side in the
opening sequence, this film, sporting a comedy-horror genre,
takes place entirely in Maine.  This can be taken as an
homage to the monarch of mayhem, Stephen King, who
might view it with a dash of envy.  The plot gets under way
when Kelly, hair coiffed in an ugly bun-like order as befits a
paleontologist, is sent to Maine by her womanizing boss--who
is motivated by bones other than those in the dinosaur
section of the Museum of Natural History.  Having never
studied animals outside the hallowed halls of the museum,
she is plunged into culture shock when she meets up with
some of the macho men of Miner's Black Lake.  In some
repartee that evokes the contentious conference between
Jane Fonda and Alan Alda in Neil Simon's "California Suite,"
she plays city girl to country boys Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), a
fish-and-game warden, and Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan
Gleeson)--while she awaits the arrival of millionaire crocodile
fanatic Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt).  Tentative about timber
territory and far from a devotee of ticks and tents, she
queries the new men in her life about bathroom facilities:
"How will I wipe myself?  I can just wipe my ass with poison
oak so I can fit in with the natives." This brings on the Maine
male's reply, "You know, you really do not have to tell people
you're from New York."</P>
<P>   Kelly soon discovers that when heads rolls in Maine, the
woodland folks mean something different from what
executives intimate in New York.  After a diver turns up angry
by half, the troupe go after the croc but with different
agendas, pitting reptile maven Hector Cyr (who wants to drug
the beast and return it to Asian waters) against Sheriff
Keough and Fish-and Game Warden Jack Wells (who want to
blow its head off).</P>
<P>   Betty White provides touches of eccentric charm as an
idiosyncratic lodger whose affinity for the lizards is even
greater than Cyr's and who gives new meaning to Bart
Simpson's favorite quote about having a cow.  But Oliver
Platt steals the show as the bizarre multi-millionaire who can't 
help riding poor Sheriff Keough.  When Keough insists,
"Crocodiles can't swim in salt water," Cyr responds, "That can
remain your secret."  Audience members who do not travel
the arty film circuit may never have seen Brendan Gleeson in
his powerhouse performance as the eponymous "The
General."  He gets no opportunity to show that kind of depth
this time around as the anti-urban sheriff, but you've got to
admire how this talented performer can alter his speech from
an almost encoded Scottish to a brogue Irish to the current
demands of the American Northeast.  </P>
<P>   Of course every viewer is going to recall "Jaws," perhaps
the scariest of the aquatic operas, made ever more
hair-raising with its signature soundtrack.  "Jaws" is almost
deadly serious compared to "Lake Placid," the latter best
appraised as a fun movie that helps get us through this heat
wave.  Any story that can get Bridget Fonda to discard that
silly museum-worker's hair design and to signal her liberation
from urban rigidity by letting it all hang down can hardly be
criticized.  </P>
