<P>  Retrospective: Conan the Barbarian (1982) - By Robert B. Marks</P>
<P>     I wish Hollywood still made films like _Conan the
Barbarian_.  Based loosely on the stories by Robert E. Howard,
this film is an excellent example of the film-maker's art.</P>
<P>     Interestingly enough, the majority of the material for
_Conan the Barbarian_ does not come from the Conan stories at
all, but rather from Robert E. Howard's King Kull tales. 
However, this material is well used to create what should soon be
a classic fantasy film.</P>
<P>     The film begins with a young Conan receiving instruction
about "the riddle of steel" from his father.  The village is then
attacked by Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), and Conan is taken
into slavery.  He grows up as a slave, becomes a gladiator, is
taken to the east to learn the arts of war, and is then freed by
his master.  The now adult Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) begins
to wander the world in search of revenge.  In his travels he
encounters and falls in love with the lovely Valeria (Sandahl
Bergman) and becomes close friends with the archer Subotai (Gerry
Lopez) and an eccentric wizard (Mako; also the narrator).</P>
<P>     Where this sort of plot would usually lead to a rather dull,
unoriginal film, John Milius' direction turns it into a very high
quality tale.  The characters are well acted and generally do
intelligent things (for example, when Conan is preparing for a
battle, he puts on armour).  The story is told more with images
and music than dialogue, and Basil Poledouris' incredible score
helps create an unforgettable movie.  James Earl Jones is perhaps
the great star of the cast; his Thulsa Doom is both hypnotic and
believable.</P>
<P>     Also, unlike most fantasy films, _Conan the Barbarian_ is a
very intelligent film that keeps the viewer thinking long after
it has ended.  The riddle of steel is a mystery which rightfully
remains unsolved, and one is left realizing that, while evil,
Thulsa Doom always speaks the truth.  Towards the end, he tells
Conan: "Without me, you will have never been", revealing an
essential fact about great men: they are made by their enemies.</P>
<P>     It is not, however, a film for children or young teenagers. 
The violence is generally graphic and explosively bloody, and
there are several scenes of nudity.  Also, the younger audience
probably wouldn't fully understand all that there is to _Conan_;
unlike too many of its successors, this film is very subtle.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the film does not actually depict Robert E.
Howard's Conan.  The chronology of the character is wrong, and
the mercenary and vulgar Conan is changed into a quiet and
introspective one.  Valeria also bears little resemblance to the
character that appears in _Red Nails_, and Thulsa Doom does not
come from the Conan stories at all; he comes from the era of King
Kull (some 20,000 or so years earlier).</P>
<P>     However, all in all _Conan the Barbarian_ is a film which
set a new standard for fantasy in Hollywood; a standard which is
rarely met.  Between memorable images, an incredible score, and a
well-told story, it is worthy of becoming a classic.</P>
<P>     So, the final score: 4.5/5; it would have gotten 5/5 if
Conan had actually borne some resemblance to what Robert E.
Howard wrote, but that's Hollywood for you...</P>

The future has not been written, / The past is set in stone,
And I am but a lonely wanderer, / With time as my only home.
