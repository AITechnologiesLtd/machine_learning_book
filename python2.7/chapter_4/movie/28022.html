<PRE>HIT AND RUNWAY
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>Attention all screenwriters!  I have discovered the perfect masturbation
material for all you wannabe Joe Eszterhases and Michael Crichtons in
the world: Write a script about two guys writing a script.  Make sure
each of the characters initially will not like each other based upon
general stereotypical foundations - such as a black man and a guy from
the South, or an Italian guy and a gay Jew.  Toss in those standard and
predictable dramatic and comedic elements, include a bookworm girl with
glasses for the romantic interest, and always remember, keep it as light
as non-fat whipped cream.</P>
<P>Just from the press book, Hit and Runway had the smell of a misguided
idea.  A gay, Jewish man and a straight, masculine Italian guy join pen
and prose together to write the perfect movie script for action
superstar Jagger Stevens.  The Italian guy is homophobic and doesn't
understand the meaning of irony.  The Jewish guy is Woody Allen's lost
twin brother who berates everything and everyone around him with "witty"
Allen-esque dialogue.  It's a quirky romantic comedy about a straight
man and a gay man coming to terms with each other's personal identities
and dreams and learning to love, and yadda yadda yadda...</P>
<P>All I can ask is, who the hell would name their kid Jagger Stevens?</P>
<P>Alex (Michael Parducci), the hulking Italian knucklehead, has big dreams
of writing a hit Hollywood movie and leaving behind his family café and
a life of washing dishes.  Elliot (Peter Jacobson) is a struggling gay
playwright (aren't all playwrights struggling?) in love with a waiter
(Kerr Smith) who works at Alex's café.  When Alex pitches a film about a
New York cop working undercover as a fashion model starring Jagger
Stevens (Hoyt Richards) to a family relative, he gets the opportunity to
write his blockbuster script.  Without any knowledge of the proper prose
for action stars, he enlists the help of Elliot in exchange for setting
up a date with the waiter.  And then the trouble starts.</P>
<P>After this initial introduction, the movie ends up falling flat on its
keyboard.  The quirkiness becomes trivial through the blatant
stereotyping of each character and his motivation.  The acting is boring
and plods along to its own pathetic beat.  The endless talks of striving
for your dreams and never giving into your own self-doubts play out like
an infomercial for a hair-replacement product.  The script is stale, the
acting is sub-par and misguided, and the cinematography is on par with a
Turkish sitcom.</P>
<P>Watching the film, it's obvious that someone tried to make something
decent out of this mess.  Hit and Runway needed a second or third
opinion in its final execution instead of letting its maker hold those
strings.  By the end, I felt cheated and let down by the abrupt tone of
the finale.  It's as if the main characters sold themselves on the
cheap.  Instead of fighting for their integrity, they relinquish their
ideals for the cheap, wind-up toys of fame and recognition.</P>
