                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

<P>     BECOMING COLETTE is a biographical recounting of the early years 
in the career of French author Gabrielle Colette (Mathilda May), the
writer of such novels as LA VAGABONDE and CHERI.  The film follows
Colette's social and sexual awakening--her transformation from a naive
country girl to a Paris socialite.  In the process, it also attempts to
relate the tale of her disastrous marriage to Henri Gauthier-Villars
(also known as "Willy").</P>
<P>     BECOMING COLETTE is an empty period piece.  The settings are nice
and the costumes appropriate, but the characters placed within them are
flat and barren.  The movie is all window-dressing.  Even the fiery
Colette is weakly portrayed, never giving the audience more than a
glimpse of the verve displayed in her writings.</P>
<P>     There's an old saying that the road to ruin is paved with good
intentions.   That seems an apropos characterization of this production.
Undoubtedly, director Danny Huston (son of the late John Huston) had
the highest of motives in trying to bring Colette's life to the screen.
Unfortunately, too many wrong choices were made and the end result is a
limp, lifeless film that boasts only one scene (the climax) of genuine
strength and impact.   That's a poor track record for any movie.</P>
<P>     Klaus Maria Brandauer, normally an effective villain, is effete in
BECOMING COLETTE.  His performance is so subdued that it becomes
virtually lost in the scenery.  His character, Gauthier-Villars, is
supposed to be a bastard, but the actor never gets this across to the
audience.  </P>
<P>     Mathilda May was not an inspired choice for Colette.  The
inconsistency of her accent is matched only by the unevenness of her
performance.  About the only thing she does well is cry (there are a lot
of tears).  Other times, she's either wildly over-the-top or joining
Maria Brandauer in fading into obscurity.  </P>
<P>     Sex plays an important part in the movie, as it did in Colette's
life.  However, rather than being erotic, most of those scenes are
dull.  There is no chemistry whatsoever between any of the
participants.  The most "daring" of these moments, a lesbian encounter
between Colette and Polaire (Virginia Madsen), is notable only for its
lack of life.</P>
<P>     Writing is a passion, and a film about the genesis of a writer
should delve into the mind and heart of its subject.  That BECOMING
COLETTE tries to do this is irrelevant, because it doesn't succeed.
The superficiality of the plot and characters do a great injustice to a
powerful author.  While biographies such as MALCOLM X, HOFFA, and
CHAPLIN provoked an interest to learn more about their characters,
BECOMING COLETTE left me apathetic.</P>
<PRE>                         Rating:  5.5 (C-, *1/2)</PRE>
