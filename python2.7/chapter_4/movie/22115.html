East Is East (7/10)</PRE>
<P>Set in 1971 in Salford, East is East concerns the mixed race Khan family
in which George, the Muslim father of the family, struggles to maintain
the traditions of his native Pakistan while running a fish and chip shop
with Ella, his English wife. George's children refer to him as Ghengis
and are intimidated into conforming with the expectations of Pakistani
culture, a culture which they feel as foreign. Apart from one son who
takes his Islamic instruction seriously, this next generation of Khans
sees little value in dietary restrictions, circumcisions and arranged
marriages, but is instead attracted to bacon, visits to the local disco
and snogs in the back alleys. Although we are aware of the racial
tension conflict between the Khans and some of their neighbours, this
never threatens to overwhelm the story - we are more concerned with the
struggles within the Khan household, and this saves the film from being
overly worthy.</P>
<P>Adapted by Ayub Khan-Din from his own play, the film centres on the
patriarchal George (Om Puri) and the no-nonsense Northern housewife Ella
(Linda Bassett). Both lead performances are excellent. George is at once
a monster, capable of beating his wife and children, and a victim of his
fear of betraying his cultural heritage. The situation is not one that
obviously lends itself to comedy, and we are always aware of the
grimness of the family's situation, but much humour is found in the
daily routine and conflicts in the Khan household, and in George's
efforts to arrange a suitable marriage for his sons.</P>
<P>Partly a harrowing social drama and partly a comedy of family life, the
film never quite stands out as either. It is nevertheless encouraging
that the British film industry can make films that are very much home-
grown product in the tradition of socially-aware British film-making,
and provide the distribution and marketing to make them commercially
successful, at least in the UK domestic market. It will be interesting
to see how the film performs elsewhere.</P>
