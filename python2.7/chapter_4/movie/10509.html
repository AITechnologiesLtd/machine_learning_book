AS GOOD AS IT GETS
(Tri-Star)
 "How do you write women so beautifully?" a gushing fan asks romance
novelist Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson). "I think of a man," the scribe
replies, "and take away reason and accountability." That's one of the
gentler put-downs dispensed by this acid-tongued obsessive-compulsive, a
walking testament to the power of negative thinking, and in the mouth of
anyone but Nicholson such crude remarks would probably have been horrifying
rather than humorous.
 The miracle of "As Good As It Gets" lies in how writer-director James
Brooks delicately balances the tone of the picture between comedy and
pathos, an accomplishment that's truly astonishing, given the film's
138-minute running time. But Brooks' deft touch won't surprise those who
remember the skill he demonstrated in his Oscar-winning "Terms of
Endearment" (1983) and Oscar-nominated "Broadcast News" (1987): "As Good"
marks a smashing return-to-form.
 Several intertwining stories make up the movie's core. Early on, it appears
this will be a raucous farce about Melvin and his feud with a gay neighbor
named Simon (Greg Kinnear), a painter whose scuffy little dog irritates
Melvin to no end. But then the focus shifts to the cheerfully abrasive
relationship between Melvin and put-upon waitress Carol (Helen Hunt), the
only server in Melvin's favorite cafe who can stand him long enough to take
his order. Before long we're introduced to Carol's backstory, involving
rotten dates and a sickly son. Where is this movie going?
 Just sit back and savor the ride. Rest assured that eventually the various
strands will come together, and "As Good As It Gets" will emerge as a
sensational comedy that manages to celebrate life while at the same time
laughing at its strange twists of fate. The cast is pure magic: Nicholson,
in one of his most fully rounded performances in years, creates one of the
year's most memorable characters, but Hunt and Kinnear (who does a
magnificent Nicholson impersonation at one point) are equally fine in
less-showy parts. And Jill, the adorably ugly canine star, deserves credit
for her contribution to the film's success.
 While the holidays are often a time when consumers fall victim to the
inflated claims and hyperactive hype of advertisers, anyone buying a ticket
to "As Good As It Gets" can take comfort in knowing that, in this case, the
title doesn't lie.</P>
