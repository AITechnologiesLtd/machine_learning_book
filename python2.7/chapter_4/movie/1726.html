<P>(Not in release yet, I saw the world premiere at Sundance Film  Festival
in Utah, and had the privilege of meeting Gabriel Byrne in person at the
reception.  He looks ten years younger in person.)</P>
<P>     A definite "must see" if you have kids, this film is everything
that the annoying Mark Lester vehicles of the early 70's were not.  From
an adult perspective, the film is flawed by too many irons in the fire
that go cool by the time it climaxes.  Ellen Barkin has a throw-away
role as the female, non-love interest, though she does a lot with the
scant material thrown her way.  Nothing is done with the evident
chemistry between her and real-life husband Byrne.</P>
<P>SYNOPSIS: Byrne plays a pathetic, yet appealing alcoholic father with
two young sons.  Grieved over his wife's death, he rejected his gypsy
ways (part of the "travellers" ... Ireland's itinerant tinkerers) to
settle down in the squalor of Dublin's slums.  Byrne's father appears
with a mysterious white stallion, whom the boys immediately adopt.
Heart tugging humor over the boys' attempts to keep the horse "hidden"
in their one bedroom apartment.  Long arm of the law steps in to dispose
of the horse.   Discovering the horse's new owner/home (they see it in
jumping competition on TV) the young lads decide to kidnap/rescue the
horse and escape "into the west," into a mythical kingdom their
grandfather has told them about.</P>
<P>From there, the film moves in unexpected directions, as the horse takes
on mythic, spiritual qualities, becoming a catalyst to help Byrne
reclaim his lost heritage, and aiding the boys in reconciling 
themselves with their mother's death.</P>
<P>STRENGTHS: Newell has drawn superb performances from the two boys, who
take up about 80% of the film's screen time.  Their acting is so sincere
and un-self-conscious that you suspect "invisible" cameras were employed.
Ireland has a lot to teach Hollywood when it comes to child actors!  As
an adult you may be able to get more "into the film" by drawing
parallels to a reclaimed "child within."  It is overall a taught, well
defined script, balanced by a beautiful musical score with lots of
Celtic harp, and *magnificent* photography.  The film will help promote
some of the richness of Celtic culture to a broad, international
audience.  The film also demonstrates the decent "family entertainment"
isn't dead on the American film scene.  It is a breath of fresh air
compared to insubstantial tripe like "Home Alone 2"</P>
<P>KNOCKS: some of the violence, though brief, may be too intense for
younger children.  (6 and under) It appears as if the writer/director
got so entranced with the kids' escape from an unloving adult world,
that they simply forgot some untied knots involving the manic villain, and
Byrne as the father attempting to redeem himself.  You may have to
suppress a few laughs in the films climax in which some clumsy visuals
are employed to help us "see" what the children see.</P>
<P>RECOMMENDATION: although the film has sweeping, magnificent
cinematography (you will want your next vacation in Ireland) not much
would be lost by waiting for the video, or viewing it on an airplane,
where it will no doubt soon appear.  If you have children in your
family, it is a "must see" film, and your enjoyment would be augmented
by a child's enthusiastic reaction.  American film critics will probably
not be fair to this film, due to the flaws mentioned above.  I predict a
short run in theatres stateside.</P>
