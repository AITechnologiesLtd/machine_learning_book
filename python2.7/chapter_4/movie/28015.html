<P>Steven Seagal's face must be crazy-glued, or something. That is the one 
overwhelming thought that plagued me throughout "Exit Wounds," his first 
big-screen motion picture since 1997's "Fire Down Below." In every single 
shot of Seagal, he has  the same brooding facial expression, as if he has 
been constipated for the last week. Either the look on his face has been 
permanently molded and glued down, or he should seriously consider flexing 
the muscles a little more. It wouldn't hurt to take some acting lessons while 
he's at it.</P>
<P>Seagal may be a mannequin who coasts through the 103-minute duration, but his 
annoying presence isn't the only problem this generic actioner has. "Exit 
Wounds" is a cliched journey through incomprehensible storytelling, 
fast-paced car chases, violent shoot-outs, a speech on the importance of gun 
safety, and everything else you would expect from a "Steven Seagal movie." On 
that level, the film delivers for his die-hard fans, but does he really have 
enough to warrant its dubious existence? Probably not.</P>
<P>Because "Exit Wounds" painstakingly keeps its mid-story plot twists under 
wraps (all of which can be seen ten miles ahead by any viewer with an IQ over 
-3), much of the picture has no story at all. What can be said is that Seagal 
plays Detroit detective Orin Boyd, a hot-tempered character who is fired and 
relocated to the infamous Precinct 15 after an unprofessional, irresponsible 
job at saving the Vice President's life during an assassination attempt. 
Saddled, at first, with the embarrassing job of directing traffic, Boyd soon 
catches wind of a planned drug deal that leads him to Latrell Walker (DMX), a 
mysteriously wealthy, young man whose brother is in prison. Latrell may not 
be the bad guy he seems, however, and some of Boyd's fellow cops at the 
precinct may not be as honorable as they appear.</P>
<P>"Exit Wounds," laughably based on an actual novel by John Westermann, and 
directed with mild aplomb by Andrzej Bartkowiak, has little to offer in the 
way of substance and characters worth caring about, but does manage to fire 
off a few exciting sequences. While not what one would exactly call 
"action-packed," there are several scenes that are edited and directed with 
such energy (including a slam-bang car chase), it's a shame the rest of the 
movie is so very bad.</P>
<P>Recording artist DMX (2000's "Romeo Must Die") is in every way a perfect 
match for Steven Seagal, in that he sleepwalks through a part without showing 
the slightest alteration on his emotion and facial expression. Better is 
Anthony Anderson (2000's "Me, Myself, & Irene"), a funny, charismatic rising 
star who, here, plays Latrell's buddy and the owner of a strip club. In the 
future, he should turn his back on weak material such as this. Other 
supporting players include Isaiah Washington (1999's "True Crime"), as 
Seagal's partner at the 15th Precinct; Jill Hennessy (2000's "Autumn in New 
York"), beautiful, but wasted, as Seagal's superior; Eva Mendes (2000's 
"Urban Legends: Final Cut"), even more beautiful, and even more wasted; and 
Tom Arnold (2000's "Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th"), 
grating as a morning talk show host whom Boyd meets at an Anger Management 
class.</P>
<P>The screenplay, by Ed Horowitz and Richard D'Ovidio, is a strictly 
cut-and-paste job that shows up to lay out the basic groundwork, and then 
makes way for more blasting guns than I've seen within a two-hour radius 
since the last John Woo opus. What "Exit Wounds" ultimately never escapes is 
its low-rent, unpolished feel--a position that fails to give the film any 
credibility. It's a stupid action pic made exclusively for those select 
people whose ability to stay awake during a movie is judged by how frequently 
an explosion occurs. </P>
