<PRE>                               BLUE IN THE FACE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It took all of five days after wrapping the shoot of SMOKE to
create BLUE IN THE FACE, an (allegedly) all-improvised follow-up to
Wayne Wang and Paul Auster's feature centered on a tiny smoke shop in
Brooklyn.  It's a weird experiment in filmmaking, studded with cameos
by Lou Reed, Madonna, Michael J. Fox, Roseanne, Lily Tomlin, and more.
Unfortunately, you've probably seen all the funniest bits in the
movie's trailer.</P>
<P>     Separated into segments with titles like "Brooklyn Attitude," BLUE
IN THE FACE explores the Brooklyn mystique and the Brooklyn experience
with video interviews and impromptu sketches.  Everything "Brooklyn" is
praised, from Ebbets Field and Jackie Robinson to Belgian Waffles and
the sanctity of the local cigar store.</P>
<P>     A lot of this is hilarious:  Reed as the smoke shop
employee/eyeglass frame inventor who's been thinking about leaving the
city for 35 years; Jim Jarmusch as Bob, who is finally giving up his
Lucky Strikes; Fox in an insanely comical turn as a spontaneous social
analyst/psychologist; Mel Gorham as Violetta, Auggie's only partially
stable girlfriend.</P>
<P>     Holding the craziness together (sort of) is Auggie (Harvey Keitel)
and the Brooklyn Cigar Co. where he works.  When news that the store
has been sold arrives, Auggie does his best to change the owner's
(Victor Argo) mind, culminating in the appearance of the ghost of
Jackie Robinson, who convinces him the store should stay open.</P>
<P>     This is not your typical Hollywood fare.  It's not typical
*anything.*  Clocking in at about 76 minutes, BLUE IN THE FACE clearly
has the look and feel of a spontaneous collection of vignettes, some of
which work, and some of which don't.  It's worthwhile for the funny
bits, and the film isn't long enough to make you lose interest when it
drags.  I suppose it did what it was supposed to do (that is, give
everyone who wasn't in SMOKE something to do for a few afternoons).
You'll have to be the judge if that was a good idea or a bad one.</P>
