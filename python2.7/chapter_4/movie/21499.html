<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Buster Keaton's 1925 film Seven Chances is given a lifeless update in
this vapid vehicle that is as grating as its two acting leads.  Here,
Chris O'Donnell stars as a young bachelor that is forced to quickly find
a bride in order to cash in on a huge inheritance.  It plays like a bad
series finale of a bad television sitcom, but unfortunately it is not.
A sitcom would at least have the good taste to limit itself to
twenty-five minutes.</P>
<P>O'Donnell (Cookie's Fortune) plays Jimmie Shannon, the
twenty-six-year-old owner of a billiard table manufacturer in San
Francisco.  Shannon narrates the beginning of the film, equating single
men with wild and untamed stallions that like a wide variety of grass
patches.  We watch as he dumps his current filly at lunch; while, in the
next booth, a curly-haired girl tells her sister that she has ended her
relationship, too.  The girl is a professional photographer named Ann
(Renée Zellweger, One True Thing), and she immediately hits it off with
Jimmie.</P>
<P>Their relationship progresses so easily that Jimmie and Ann even miss
their one-year anniversary.  That's just the kind of relationship it
is.  But Jimmie grows uneasy as he watches all of his single friends
succumb to marriage.  There's even a funny bit that intertwines clips of
nervous men during a wedding bouquet toss and footage of stallions being
lassoed.  Eventually, Ann is the only single girl left over the age of
twelve and catches a prophetic bouquet.</P>
<P>After three years of dating, Jimmie pops the question to Ann after a
romantic dinner at The Starlight Room, but awkwardly fumbles through the
proposal to his horrified girlfriend, who ditches him and runs home and
reveals to her sister/roommate, `All I wanted was for him to do it right
and he didn't, and that says everything.'  This one line represents
everything that is wrong with females today.  They wait their whole
lives for this moment, and if it doesn't go down like they've dreamed,
they turn into wicked, vindictive shrews.  Of course, Jimmie's
grass-eating-stallion analogy wasn't exactly classy, either.  How are we
supposed to feel anything for these characters?</P>
<P>Jimmie's failed proposal attempt becomes an instant urban legend and
results in the death of his grandfather, who we learn has amassed a $100
million fortune that will be left to Jimmie, but only if he meets the
following requirements:</P>
<P>1. He must marry by 6:05 PM on his 30th birthday
2. He must stay married for at least ten years
3. He must live under the same roof as his wife and spend no more than
one night per month apart
4. He must produce a child within five years</P>
<P>The catch is that he turns thirty the following day and, to make matters
worse, Ann takes off for a three-week assignment in Athens.  So Jimmie
desperately begins proposing to every girl he has ever dated, including
a cop, a student, a commodities trader and an opera singer (Mariah
Carey) to no avail.  And when his best friend Marco (Artie Lange, Mad
TV) places a personal ad in the newspaper for brides, things begin to
speed out of control.</P>
<P>Although the film opens promisingly with David Byrne covering Cole
Porter's `Don't Fence Me In,' The Bachelor quickly becomes tedious and
mundane.  James Cromwell is completely wasted as a priest that follows
Jimmie around waiting to perform the wedding ceremony.  Hal Holbrook
also has a role in the film and – get this – has a fifteen-year-old
daughter.  O'Donnell's character is so underdeveloped that we never
learn how he came into the family's billiard business.  We learn his dad
was crushed when a building collapsed on him, but where is his mom?</P>
<P>And how does Zellweger luck into these roles where studly men are forced
into professing their love for her?  I half-expected a `you complete me'
line to come flying out of O'Donnell's maw.  But I might believe it if
the girl slapped on some lipstick.  The only way I can justify this is
to believe that her characters are sexually deviant, but this is even a
stretch.  She looks like the type that complains when you're on her
hair.  I wanted to choke her repeatedly, but feared that could actually
make her voice even raspier if I failed to finish her off.  She made me
wish that The Bachelor was a silent film, like Seven Chances.</P>
<P>I've got a much better idea for a script.  Have Jimmie move in with
Marco, who would divorce his wife and let Jimmie marry her in exchange
for a chunk of the inheritance.  Jimmie could live in a spare bedroom or
the basement and impregnate Marco's gal via in-vitro fertilization,
while she still technically remains Marco's gal.  Then, after the baby
is born and the film ends, the film can spin-off into a television
sitcom where the three try to survive their cramped quarters and bitter
feelings until the inheritance check is delivered.</P>
<P>Although The Bachelor is rated PG-13, there is one moment where someone
shouts `scum-sucker,' but it was obviously dubbed over a dirtier kind of
`sucker.'  I think there were also a couple of `f-word' cover-ups.
Parents of lip-reading children – beware.  Actually, everyone should be
wary of this movie.</P>
<PRE>1:43 - PG-13 for adult languag</PRE>
