                       A film review by John Schuurman

<P>     Now I am not proud to say it, but I'll admit my eyes have welled
up with tears at "Little House on the Prairie" reruns and so you might
not want to take the following too seriously, but this movie had me
dabbing and daubing and wiping away from about fifteen minutes in.  I
don't know when I have been to a movie that had its way with me like
this one. A couple of hours removed, it seems a little silly to be
affected so, but I want to go once again and wait for the last scene.</P>
<P>     It is a "school movie" dealing as such movies do with the heaves
and hos of teaching. At the outset the viewer expects the usual formula
of an idealistic teacher arriving in a tough school and, after some
initial disappointments, working a wonder through that magical mixture
of pluck, toughness and tenderness. Well, only some of that is here.
Which parts aren't important. The parts of the formula that are not
here, are refreshingly absent.</P>
<P>     What is important about the movie is that it shows us the
essential truth that meaning in life comes through sacrifice and
faithfulness rather than individual dream pursuit. I am sorry for the
way that sounds and want to promise you that you will delight in the
movie despite that dreary sentence. But that it is about and you will
love it.</P>
<P>     This movie will make you want to search out and do something
gracious for those career teachers who could have made other choices
and who no doubt wanted to but didn't.</P>
<P>     Richard Dreyfuss gives a career performance.</P>
