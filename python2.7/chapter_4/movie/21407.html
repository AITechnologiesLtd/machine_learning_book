<P>With its cast of up-and-coming non A-list stars, Suicide Kings
profoundly succeeds where other all-boy ensemble casts (like The Newton
Boys) generally fail.  It is a wickedly dark comedy that revolves around
dual kidnappings, one the daughter of a wealthy New York family and the
other of an ex-Mafia boss.</P>
<P>The first abduction is of Lisa Chasten (Laura R. Harris), who is scooped
up whilst in the throes of parking lot passion with her secret boyfriend
and doctor wannabe, Max Minot (Jeremy Sisto, Clueless).  Max is the only
witness to the crime, but can offer precious few details.</P>
<P>Although he is affluent beyond my wildest dreams, Lisa's father can't
get his hands on the two million-dollar ransom and misses the first
payoff deadline.  Then, one of Lisa's digits is delivered, so the
picture shifts to a backup plan.</P>
<P>It seems that Lisa's brother Avery (Henry Thomas, Niagara, Niagara)
decides to befriend and kidnap Charles Barrett (Christopher Walken, The
Prophecy).  Why Charles Barrett?  Well, here's one clue – his name used
to be Carlo Bertolucci.  Charles decided to change it when he retired as
the head of the New York crime family syndicate, on the road to the
straight and narrow.</P>
<P>Avery, Max and their bratty socialite schoolmates, Brett (Jay Mohr,
Jerry Maguire) and T.K. (Sean Patrick Flannery, Powder) figure if they
can get Charles attention, he can help locate Lisa's captors and quickly
resolve the whole incident.  They befriend him at his daily dinner digs,
convince him to take a little car ride through his `old neighborhood'
and hit him with the chloroform once the trip begins.</P>
<P>Dragging him back to a summer home of the Chasten family, the rich kids
demand assistance from the drugged Charles.  Enter comic relief from
geeky worrywart Ira (Johnny Galecki, Roseanne) and shoe fetishist Lono
Vecchio (Denis Leary, The Ref) and that's when real fun begins.</P>
<P>Suicide Kings is wryly written by Wayne Rice and Gina Goldman, the
latter a producer of the television series The Wonder Years.  It is the
feature film debut of Peter O'Fallon, an Emmy award winning director
best known for his work on such shows as Northern Exposure,
thirtysomething and Party of Five.  His stylish and highly entertaining
filming can only lead one to hope that frigging television naysayers
will shut the hell up about my second favorite medium.</P>
