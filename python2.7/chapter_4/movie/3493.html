<PRE>                           STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Al Franken, Laura San Giacomo, Vincent D'Onofrio,
           Harris Yulin, Shirley Knight, Lesley Boone.
Screenplay:  Al Franken.
Director:  Harold Ramis.</P>
<P>     Lorne Michaels must die.  It is really as simple as that.  Yes,
he bought himself a temporary reprieve with the dumb-but-still-
funny TOMMY BOY, but Michaels has foisted so much horrible product
on American television and film audiences in the last five years
that such a minor success was the artistic equivalent of Charles
Manson buying a few boxes of Girl Scout cookies.  We can only find
evidence of a benevolent God in the fact that HANS & FRANZ THE MOVIE
and COFFEE TALK THE MOVIE were scrapped in development (that is not
a joke).  Unfortunately, STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY slipped out before
Paramount stopped handing Michaels blank checks.  Not only is this
latest "Saturday Night Live" character spinoff incoherent and
unfunny, its basic idea and tone are just appallingly wrong-headed.</P>
<P>     Al Franken stars as Stuart Smalley, caring nurturer and host of
the public access cable program "Daily Affirmation."  That is before
the program is cancelled, leading Stuart into a shame spiral which
causes concern among his cadre of 12-step sponsors led by Julia
(Laura San Giacomo).  To make matters worse, the death of a beloved
aunt forces Stuart to confront his singularly dysfunctional
immediate family:  his alcoholic father (Harris Yulin); co-dependent
enabler mother (Shirley Knight); pot-smoking unemployed brother
(Vincent D'Onofrio); over-eater and thrice-divorced sister (Lesley
Boone).  As family strife commences over trouble with the aunt's
inheritance, Stuart tries to be the peace-maker, while also trying
to revive his show on another cable network.</P>
<P>     To state the obvious about the recent spate of SNL-"inspired"
features, the five-minute sketches on which STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY
is based weren't all that funny to begin with.  They had their
moments, primarily because Al Franken is one of the few performers
associated with SNL in the last decade who doesn't appear to have
had all his subtlety surgically removed; indeed, his sing-song
delivery is good for the film's few laughs.  But where on earth was
he going to come up with a 90-minute concept for a movie?  The
answer is that he didn't.  Instead, he took two 45-minute concepts
and fused them together into a disastrous whole.  One plot, in which
Stuart attempts to take his Illinois public access show to the big
time (shades of WAYNE'S WORLD, anyone?), is supposed to be the funny
part.  It is not, with the exception of a cameo by Julia (IT'S PAT)
Sweeney as a timid receptionist who becomes a guest on "Daily
Affirmation."  Mostly, it's just deadly slow.</P>
<P>     What is _unintentionally_ funny about STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY
is the movie-of-the-week melodrama of the Smalley family segments.
Although there are a few flashbacks to Stuart's youth which are
played strictly for laughs (unsuccessfully), the majority of the
interactions are intended to be poignant or serious.  This decision
is baffling, because Franken appears to have forgotten the premise
behind the "Daily Affirmation" sketches.  They were parodies of the
touchy-feely self-help movement, deriving most of their humor from
goofy over-reliance on new age mantras like Stuart's ubiquitous "and
that's ... okay."  But STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY is practically a love
letter to self-help, and the problems within the family are treated
with a ridiculous earnestness.  The schizoid combination of
humorless comedy and misplaced sentimentality (including a score by
the ever-more-saccharine Marc Shaiman) makes for a truly
uncomfortable ride.</P>
<P>     It is clear that Al Franken had two basic choices when it came
to making a STUART movie:  keep Stuart a caricature in an episodic
story, or make him more real in an actual narrative.  He managed
somehow to get Harold Ramis (GROUNDHOG DAY) to direct, so he went
for the human, feel-good angle.  Big mistake.</P>
<P>     I said Franken had two basic choices.  Make that three:  he
could have chosen not to do the movie at all.  _That_ would have
been the smart choice.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 daily affirmations:  2.</PRE>
