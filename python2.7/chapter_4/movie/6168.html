                          Palookaville (1996)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     It seems that everybody these days wants to be a director.  Some
people have the gift, but others are lacking.  First time feature film
director Alan Taylor tries his had at a farce with PALOOKAVILLE.
Granted the music by Rachel Portman (EMMA, SIRENS, and THE JOY LUCK
CLUB) is full of great whimsy, but the picture itself is dreadful and
mean spirited to boot.  Perhaps Taylor has promise, but PALOOKAVILLE is
on the debit side of almost everyone's ledger who has a part in it.</P>
<P>     The press kit claims that although PALOOKAVILLE was filmed in
Jersey City, its roots are in Italy.  Specially, they cite Italo
Calvino's short stories about Italians trying to make ends meet
economically after the war.  Well, I've never read the stories, but I
hope they are not as shallow as this movie.</P>
<P>     In the putatively funny opening sequence, three bumbling robbers,
Sid (William Forsythe), Russ (Vincent Gallo), and Jerry (Adam Trese),
drill a hole in the rear of a jewelry store wall.  Rather than finding
riches of diamonds and rubies, they find tray after tray of jelly
donuts.  It seems that they went through the wrong wall.</P>
<P>     Perhaps with a more deft approach, this scene could have been
funny, but David Epstein's script lacks much subtlety.  The robbers
steal and eat the donuts getting jelly on their faces and powered sugar
all over their clothes.  One robber continues to steal the donuts right
next to the cops when they arrive.  Even hours later, these Three
Stooges quality thieves still have not wiped their mouths or brushed
off their clothes.</P>
<P>     Since their life of crime is not yielding the abundant rewards for
which they had hoped, one of them suggests they switch to a scheme of
running an illegal taxicab for old people.  Russ says they should stick
to their original plan since, "I'm not talking about a life of crime,
just a momentary shift in lifestyle."  To keep from getting prosecuted
for armed robbery, his solution is toy guns.  "The thief gets the
benefit of the doubt.  Most crooks in this country use cap guns."</P>
<P>     Russ is a dreamer.  As a come-on line to his neighbor Laurie
(Bridgit Ryan), he tells her, "Why don't I take you to California.  You
can have fresh squeezed orange juice every day.  If you've got a back
yard there, you've got fresh fruit."</P>
<P>     Actually, there is only one part of the film I like.  Russ and
Laurie have windows facing each others.  After she flashes him one
night in the cute and only nude scene in the picture, their romance
starts heating up.  She likes to strip naked, get into her raincoat,
and then crawl into his bedroom through his window.  And vice versa of
course.  In a better movie, I might have criticized this little
romantic subplot as needless, but here I appreciated the diversion from
the plodding main plot.</P>
<P>     The show has other known actors including Gareth Williams, Lisa
Gay Hamilton, and most wasted of all, Frances McDormand (FARGO).  I am
a fan of McDormand's, but her performance in PALOOKAVILLE is lifeless.</P>
<P>     In a film that tries to charm you, but is so dreadfully dull that
boredom is the only consist reaction to it, there is one funny little
scene.  When Russ's brother-in-law and cop Ed comes in one evening, the
three would be bandits are watching the old black and white film
ARMORED CAR ROBBERY.  They are studiously taking notes, and this does
arouse suspicions in Ed.</P>
<P>     PALOOKAVILLE is mercifully only 1:33 long.  It is rated R for
brief nudity and strong language.  The film would be fine for any
teenager.  I see no reason to waste your time with it so it gets a big
thumbs down from me and a measly single * only for Bridgit Ryan's small
part.  The press kit says she will be in GREAT EXPECTATIONS with Robert
De Niro, Ethan Hawke, and Gwyneth Paltrow so she will get a much better
chance than this slight movie.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
