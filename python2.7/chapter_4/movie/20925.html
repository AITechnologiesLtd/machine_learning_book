October, 1999</PRE>
<P>Unfortunately, there is little mystery in this film. Following in the 
footsteps of Rocky; Hoosiers; Rudy; The Mighty Ducks; and on and on, 
Mystery, Alaska is yet another underdog sports movie where the audience 
is made to wait over an hour for an inevitable final match that will 
surely come down to the last seconds. This film will likely be buried 
quickly in the always hectic fall film season.</P>
<P>With a population of just under 700, the town of Mystery, Alaska is 
small, homely and most everyone knows everyone; the biggest threat is 
the invasion of a mega-store and its potential harm to the status quo of 
their economy.</P>
<P>Once a week, the town gathers around a frozen pond for a near-religious 
experience: The Saturday Hockey Game. The players are selected by a 
special committee and are the pride of Mystery. The matches are always 
friendly as the pool of athletes is randomly divided into teams just 
before game time.</P>
<P>Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), a Mystery native, has left the town and is 
now working in New York with a television station. He remembers the old 
town games and thinks, just as Kevin Bacon thought in The Air Up There, 
that these local players might be on par with the multimillionaire 
athletes seen every weekend on television. He writes a feel-good article 
for a popular magazine and soon after returns to Mystery with the 
promise of an exhibition game, against the New York Rangers, to be 
broadcast for the whole world to see. To Charles it is a fluff piece 
that will make him money, to the Rangers it is a joke and waste of time, 
to Mystery it is a game for pride - the pride of knowing that their 
boys are just as good as any others.</P>
<P>The makers of Mystery, Alaska learned a lesson from Fargo: No matter how 
snowy and accent-heavy your setting, a complementary side plot is still 
necessary. In this case sexual relationships are the added oomph. 
Although premature ejaculations; teenage soap-opera relationships; 
adultery with a friend of the spouse and old crushes revisited are far 
from uncharted territory, they are portrayed here in a surprisingly bold 
manner for a sports film.</P>
<P>The production skates dangerously close to the realm of melodrama. One 
of the low points comes mid-film and pits the town of Mystery, in court, 
with the National Hockey League Players Union. The issue is whether or 
not the Rangers will be forced to play in the game all the way across 
the country during one of their much-valued breaks. Aside from having an 
obvious outcome, if there is no game, there is no movie, this section is 
particularly pathetic because two of Hollywood's last resort dramatic 
elements are used: a court scene and a key character's death.</P>
<P>There are three funny roles in Mystery, Alaska: Mike Myers, Beth 
Littleford and Michael McKean. Myers has a cameo, McKean has two scenes 
and Littleford isn't exactly a prominent character. Other than those, 
there is not much good about this film; the drama is weak and the payoff 
is predictable. Maybe the Rangers had the right idea in trying to stay 
home.</P>
