Dog Park
Directed by:  Bruce McCulloch
Starring: Natasha Henstridge, Luke Wilson, Janeane Garofalo, 
Kathleen Robertson, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney
Running time:  91 minutes
My rating (5 star scale): ***1/2</PRE>
<P>A young couple have split and are fighting over custody of their dog,
Mowgli.  Another, seemingly perfect, couple have two dogs.  A lonely
woman who hosts a children's tv show has a dog called Peanut.  They 
all take their pets to the dog park.  They all take them to the same
obedience instructor.  And pretty soon they have all met.</P>
<P>This is a film about relationships and how they do and don't work.
Andy misses Mowgli.  And his exgirlfriend Cheryl gives up custody
whent their pet's therapist says Mowgli's sudden unhappiness is due to
witnessing Cheryl and her boyfriend have boisterous sex.  Since Andy
isn't
having any sex, his house is a better home.  But Andy meets Lorna
(Peanuts
owner).  They meet in a bar where she picks him up and they go to his
place where she promptly throws up.  Despite this less than best 
first date, Andy likes her and sends her flowers - against the advice of
his friend Jeri (the female half of the perfect couple).  But Lorna
throws out the flowers and vows never to see him again.  </P>
<P>Jeri then convinces Andy to participate in a bachelor auction for
charity.
He's purchased, for $100, by a vegan physical therapist who starts 
causing real problems for Mowgli when she and Andy start having some
very energetic sex.  But Andy doesn't really love her, he's just
terrified
of not being in a relationship.  Something shared by almost everyone in
the film.</P>
<P>The dogs may be in obedience school (and some of the comedic highlights
come from their instructor who firmly believes dogs are better than 
children) but it's the owners who need training.  They lack any self
control and are driven by their passions and fears.</P>
<P>Of course, we all know how a romantic comedy like this ends, but it is 
fun getting there.  The dogs are cute, the relationships close to real,
and the dialogue reasonable.  If you liked movies like Ed's Next Move,
you'll love this.</P>
