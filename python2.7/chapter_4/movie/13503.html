<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>High Art is a story about women, told by a woman.  It's not loud and
sentimental, but quiet, subtle, and intelligent.  There aren't a lot of
films like this, so this one naturally feels different from most stories
about women.  Our protagonist is Syd (Radha Mitchell), an assistant
editor for a photography magazine called Frame.  She's a young woman who
is deeply interested in her own job -- we can see the intensity in her
eyes as she gazes upon photographs that she loves and admires.  She
lives with her boyfriend, James (Gabriel Mann), and upstairs lives Lucy
Berliner (Ally Sheedy).  </P>
<P>Lucy is a retired photographer, and Syd is instantly entranced by her
work.  Just as she's learning of Lucy's artistic abilities, she also
learns of her personal habits.  Lucy is a drug addict, but, more
importantly, she's a lover of women -- her girlfriend is a crazy
low-voiced German named Greta (Patricia Clarkson).  Syd convinces Lucy
to come out of retirement, Lucy grasps on to Syd's ambition to give
herself energy, and the two women head towards a relationship that could
only be successful in a perfect world.</P>
<P>A friend of mine, who occasionally sees the art house films with me,
made a valid point the other day:  it seems like every art house film
has something to do with homosexuality.  I wouldn't say *every* art
house film does, but the issue is more completely explored in
independent films than it is in mainstream pictures.  High Art does
explore the issue, but it explores it from the rare perspective of a
neophyte woman, who has only been with men in her life.  Perhaps that's
what I find so interesting about this film -- most movies about lesbians
glorify and romanticize the sex, as if to appeal strictly to straight
men, but the love scenes in High Art aren't the slightest bit arousing. 
They are as disturbing for the viewer as they are for the characters who
don't quite know what they're doing.</P>
<P>Writer/director Lisa Cholodenko is a skilled storyteller.  I love her
direction in this film -- it's soft, and so slow that it almost feels
motionless.  Cholodenko observes the beauty of the female figure, but
she doesn't exploit it.  There are moments in this film during which Syd
does not look glamorous or stunning -- in fact, most people would say
she looks like a wreck -- but there's something in Cholodenko's vision
and in the pictures that Lucy takes of Syd that capture everything
subtle about Syd's figure.  Mitchell is a beautiful actress, and manages
to convey beauty without ever looking fake or flashy.  At the same time,
Lucy, despite her bony figure and dim eyes, comes across as oddly
desirable.</P>
<P>The film isn't elusive, but it doesn't come right out and tell us what
it's about.  It works on many levels -- in some scenes, it's a rather
acidic attack of the vicious photography industry.  More often, it seems
present primarily to diagram the unique relationship between Syd and
Lucy -- the mentor/student dynamic that arises through admiration and
progresses through desire.  The development of the characters in this
sense is well-orchestrated by Cholodenko:  it's believable that Syd
could fall for a woman like Lucy; at the same time, it's interesting
that Lucy, in her detached and foggy existence, finds someone that she
truly cares about.  High Art isn't a pleasant film, but this
relationship feels oddly pure.  </P>
<P>Cholodenko does owe a lot to her performers.  Mitchell, an actress with
whom I'm not familiar, is very good here.  Many of the subtle character
details I mentioned above are noticeable because of her talent as a
performer.  The first love scene between the two women truly showcases
her work, and illustrates perfectly the way her mental desires do not
coincide with her physical needs.  Sheedy, on the other hand, has never
been so honest and down-to-earth as she is here.  Neither actress has
any scenes that could be used as clips for Oscar nominations, but that's
the point -- this is a film that relies entirely on subtlety.</P>
<P>The very last sequence is the best in the film, and it brings the story
together with all of its themes.  It's not painless, but it's
emotionally satisfying in a way few movies are.  My only complaint with
High Art is that it's almost too subtle for its own good -- I could see
many people walking away from the film not knowing what to make of it. 
In fact, most of what I think the film is about is pure speculation.  I
do like to speculate, but I'm not sure that Cholodenko has given us
enough guidance as to what to make of her picture.  But this aside,
there is something special about a film that can take a subject with so
much baggage and still do new and interesting things with the premise. 
Because of this, I can assure you that High Art lives up to its title.</P>
