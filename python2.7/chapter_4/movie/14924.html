FILM FREAK CENTRAL

<P>starring Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini, Giustino

screenplay by Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami
directed by Roberto Benigni</P>
<P>At last May's Cannes' awards ceremony, hyphenate Benigni-whose LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL had just won the Grand Jury Prize-jumped from his seat, bowed
at jury president Martin Scorsese's feet, and danced around the stage
with tears in his eyes. It was a rare moment of humour at the stuffy,
elitist festival, and his reaction instantly disarmed a deadly serious
audience. In short, for a few brief moments he turned Cannes into
something it arguably had never been before: funny and sweet. His film
pulls off a similar magic trick: LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is a bittersweet
comedy that takes place (mostly) in a concentration camp.</P>
<P>Benigni stars as Guido, a clever and warm Jewish-Italian waiter who
relentlessly pursues "princess" Dora (Braschi) until she can no longer
resist him; within a few years, they are married and with child, the
inquisitive Giosué (Cantarini). But not long after Guido also realizes
his dream of opening a bookstore is he herded, along with his son and
uncle (Durano), to the camps. (Loving Dora, whose heritage allows her to
stay behind, joins them anyway.)</P>
<P>Guido wants to protect Giosué from the horrible truth, so he tells his
son that they are players of a complex game: the winner gets to ride in
a tank! (I loved the moment when Guido voluntarily mistranslates a
barking soldier's orders just so he can establish a set of "rules": no
talking, hide from the mean-looking men in uniforms, and don't ask for
sandwiches.) The boy's eventual suspicions force Guido to cover up his
lies with more lies: one brilliant sequence has Giosué disguised as a
German boy so he can enjoy a big fancy dinner at which Guido has been
asked to wait tables-Giosué has no idea how close he comes to being
killed after accidentally applauding his meal in Italian.</P>
<P>The first third of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is very whimsical; nothing prepares
us for its narrative's left turn. Benigni moves with the grace of Fred
Astaire, can take a pratfall like Buster Keaton, and at times his verbal
pitter-patter is a one-man Abbott and Costello routine; Benigni is the
current clown prince of cinema. (Is it any wonder Blake Edwards tried to
revive the Pink Pather series with Benigni as the son of Inspector
Clouseau?) It is thanks to Benigni's benign performance (his eyes
project nothing but sincerity) that not one second of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL
is maudlin or cloying; that said, I can't imagine a person unmoved by
the film's ending. Guido is a completely unselfish man who simply
utilizes his gifts to make the best of the worst situation. He does what
many a father would do, and the climax drives that point home.</P>
<P>Before the haunting LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL took home its Cannes award (it
also recently won the Toronto International Film Festival's Audience
Award), there was speculation that its subject matter might stir up
controversy. By now, I'm sure the unanimously positive reaction to the
film has quelled the Jewish community's (among others) fears; LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL does not make light of the holocaust whatsoever. Instead, it
embraces the bravery of its victims, and educates its audience through
truly accessible characters.</P>
