<PRE>SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>I'll start out by saying Seven Years in Tibet is one of the best looking
films of this year. Seven Years in Tibet and the recent The Matchmaker
(starring Janeane Garafalo) are on the top of my list as great looking
films of 1997. Cinematographer, Robert Fraisse, should be noted for the
beautifully shot Seven Years in Tibet.</P>
<P>Seven Years in Tibet is based on the autobiographical book by the same
name, written by Heinrich Herrer. Though the previews seem to give the
sense that the movie follows the friendship between Herrer and the Dalai
Lama, that only happens during the last half of the film. As the film
starts we learn that, the Austrian, Herrer (Brad Pitt) is invited by the
Nazi government to be part of an expedition to climb the Nanga Parbat, one
of the tallest mountains in the Himalayas. With his leaving for the
expedition he leaves behind his pregnant wife. Herrer befriends the leader
of the expedition, Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis), the friendship is
built through their many hardships together.</P>
<P>The expedition comes to a halt and the team goes back down the mountain to
find that they are being detained as prisoners of war. Herrer tries many
times to escape the prison, but is unsuccessful. He finally escapes with
the help of Aufschnaiter and they trek through the mountains of India to
arrive at the Tibetan holy city Lhasa. The residents quickly accept them,
which is not an easy thing because foreigners at the time were looked upon
badly. It is here that Herrer befriends the Dalai Lama who is portrayed by
newcomer Jamyang Wangchuk.</P>
<P>The best performance in Seven Years is by the newcomer Jamyang Wangchuk.
His performance as the Dalai Lama is absolutely excellent. Pitt does not
fare so well though. He doesn't do badly in the film, but his performance
was mediocre at best. One big flaw was his disappearing and reappearing
accent. Thewlis does well as Aufschnaiter; the last time I saw Thewlis was
in Dragon Heart where he portrayed a wimpy prince.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is the score by John Williams. Though not one of his
stronger scores, it is a good score to the film. Also worth mentioning are
the beautiful set design by At Hoang and costume design by Enrico Sabatini.
 But, again, the biggest thing going for Seven Years is the cinematography
by Fraisse.</P>
<P>The movie does run a bit long; the analogy that I would put for the film is
"a long long drive through a beautiful place." Director Jean-Jacques Annaud
and screenwriter Becky Johnson seem to add the last quarter of the film to
lengthen it a bit, which, though very informative about what the Chinese
did to the Tibetans, causes the audience to lose focus on the story of
Herrer. The film is a redemption story about Herrer, who starts out as an
arrogant self-righteous man, but in the end learns his wrongs and changes.</P>
<P>Seven Years in Tibet is a long film that is entertaining and informative. I
enjoyed the cinematography the most in this film. Jamyang Wangchuk is the
real star of the film and this film should be seen for his performance. </P>
