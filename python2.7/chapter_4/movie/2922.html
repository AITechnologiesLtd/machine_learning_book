                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Dir: Zhang Yimou
Starring: Ge You, Gong Li, Niu Ben, Guo Tao
Based on the novel by Yu Hau
Winner of Best Actor and Grand Jury Prizes at Cannes
ERA International Films in association with Shanghai Film Studios</P>
<P>     Zhang Yimou helped put Mainland Chinese cinema on the world map.
He is one of the leaders of China's "fifth generation" of  film
makers.  JU DUO and RAISE THE RED LANTERN both told tragic period
stories in visually colorful settings.  His new project, TO LIVE; or as
it appears on the film itself, LIFETIMES; attempts to expand his
horizons from telling simple period tales to telling an epic  covering
all of recent Chinese history.</P>
<P>     TO LIVE follows the life of a decadent gambler's family from the
waning days of the Nationalist Government through the Communist
Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and its
aftermath.  Each of these eras is set off by a separate title.  The
events of this family's life are picked up and continued with
characters being a decade older.</P>
<P>     The drama is quite touching but increasingly turns from being a
clever and original story full of sharp plot twists to being a story of
predictable plot devices.  The odd events that bring the gambler from
being a rich man to being an itinerant puppet master become in the
second half of the film a series of standard family tragedies.  The
film is best when it tries to convey the paranoia of the post-
revolution chaos.  Characters are aware that missing an important rally
could mean the suggestion of being counter-revolutionary, and
ultimately death.  The film is worst when it tries to personalize the
events of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution routine
melodrama.  Zhang Yimou's other films are notable for brilliant and
vibrant color schemes.  Much of this film is in a drab blue and grey,
the omnipresent colors of the post-revolution village and villagers.</P>
<P>     Somewhat compensating for this are several truly engaging
performances by Ge You as the one time gambler and Gong Li as his
wife.  They, and all the cast, depict their characters with extreme
conviction.  The settings, from colorful mansions to drab communal
buildings are also entirely credible if not always visually
interesting.  The ability of the characters to find elements of joy in
their increasingly chaotic lives is also a theme of the film that is
well realised.  Through all of the turbulence of historical events
depicted, the main characters manage to experience the full range of
human emotion.  They manage as the title suggests, to live.</P>
<P>     All of this is not to say the film is not good, but following so
closely on the heels of the very similar FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE it is
by comparison a disappointment.  That film gets much more mileage out
of the Chinese opera than this film gets out of puppet shows.  FAREWELL
MY CONCUBINE also builds up to higher and more significant
crescendos.  The terror of the Cultural Revolution is more real in
FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE because more of the action is on screen.  In
TO LIVE, much of that action is off screen, people run to and from
events that we do not see.  Bernardo Bertolucci's THE LAST EMPEROR,
not strictly speaking a Chinese film, also covers many of the same
events with more emotion and visual impact.  I recommend TO LIVE, but
it covers already well trod ground in a sometimes too predictable way.</P>
