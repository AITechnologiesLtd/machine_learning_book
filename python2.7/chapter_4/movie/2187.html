<P>Ned Ravine (Armand Assante) has a duel career.  By night, he's a tough, 
no-nonsense cop who always gets his man.  By day, he's a defense attorney 
who defends most of the guys he catches.  Despite his devotion to his 
cheating wife Lana (Kate Nelligan), Ned finds himself strangely attracted 
to his newest client, the mysterious and sensuous Lola Kane (Sean Young), 
who is determined to lure the lawyer/cop back to her place and into her 
bed.  There's another woman in Ned's life, as well - his shy, innocent 
secretary Laura (Sherilyn Fenn), whose past is about to catch up to her 
in the form of an abusive husband that she ran away from.  And as if Ned 
didn't have enough problems, his arch enemy has just been released from 
jail and is faxing him death threats.</P>
<P>FATAL INSTINCT is the next in a seemingly-endless series of parodies that 
sets its sights on recent blockbusters.  As indicated by the title, the 
primary targets are BASIC INSTINCT and FATAL ATTRACTION.  Thrown in for 
good measure are satires from DOUBLE INDEMNITY, CAPE FEAR, and SLEEPING 
WITH THE ENEMY.  Considering the fertile ground available with no less 
than five films being lampooned, you figure FATAL INSTINCT can't possibly 
miss the mark altogether.  Bad assumption.  This movie is about as stale 
and unfunny as they come.</P>
<P>This style of movie - the "AIRPLANE type" - had gotten old before 1993 
began.  The entries over the past few years have gotten progressively 
weaker, generating fewer laughs and providing more tedium.  Nevertheless, 
Hollywood in its infinite wisdom decided to give us four more this year - 
LOADED WEAPON ONE, HOT SHOTS PART DEUX, ROBIN HOOD:  MEN IN TIGHTS, and 
now FATAL INSTINCT.  </P>
<P>Not only has the genre reached the stage where each new addition 
escalates the continued flogging of a very dead horse, but there's little 
zing to each individual one-liner, pun, or sight gag.  For every joke 
that works in FATAL INSTINCT, there are a dozen that don't.  Rapid-fire 
humor succeeds only when there are enough amusing bits to keep the 
viewer's mind off everything that falls through.  In this film, it's 
painfully evident how unimaginative the script is.</P>
<P>Perhaps the strongest condemnation I can give is that this movie makes 
Mel Brooks' ROBIN HOOD picture look like a classic comedy.  Most of the 
funniest moments in FATAL INSTINCT are shown in the theatrical and 
television trailers, and I didn't laugh a whole lot when I saw them then.  
Needless to say, their impact during the actual film was considerably 
less impressive.  There are countless jokes that rely on sexual innuendo, 
but most of these aren't much more original than the graffiti found in an 
average high school boys' locker room.</P>
<P>Of the actors, only Armand Assante and Sherilyn Fenn give credible 
performances.  Assante isn't as good doing the dead-pan cop as Leslie 
Nielsen, but he does an adequate job, and dances better than expected in 
high heels.  He also has the best single line:  "I don't look as stupid 
as I am."  (If nothing else, that should tell you about the quality of 
humor in FATAL INSTINCT).  Frankly, Sherilyn Fenn is too good to have 
been wasted in this movie.  Kate Nelligan and Sean Young, however, with 
their annoying portrayals of lifeless characters, belong exactly where 
they are.</P>
<P>Personally, if I see another send-up of Sharon Stone's character in BASIC 
INSTINCT, I think I'll walk out of the theater.  It wasn't funny the 
first time it was done, and by now it's gotten downright annoying.  Who 
cares if she uncrossed her legs without any panties on?  Let's move onto 
something new.  Belaboring that issue is like watching this movie or 
continuing this review:  pointless.</P>
