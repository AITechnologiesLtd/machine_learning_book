<PRE>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb</PRE>
<P>The tagline for `Time Code' asks the viewer: `Who will
you want to watch?' Considering my expectations going
in to the film, a better question would be `Why will
you want to watch?' After he triumphed with the jazzy,
low-budget hit `Leaving Las Vegas', filmmaker Mike
Figgis directed three dreadful films: `One Night
Stand', `Miss Julie', and of course, `The Loss Of
Sexual Innocence', one of the most pretentious art
films I have ever seen. To add salt to an oozing flesh
wound, his latest film, `Time Code', is shot on
digital video and features a screen split into
quadrants for the duration of its running time. In
other words, I was expecting a `Blair Witch' headache
to the fourth power, as directed by an elitist
egomaniac. But the cinema often defies our
expectations. </P>
<P>Films are rarely as provocative as `Time Code' is.
Figgis gives us four pairs of eyes to witness a story
told in real-time, on digital video, without edits and
quick cuts. The plotline isn't half as fascinating as
the project itself, and the best thing is that it's
hard to care. `Time Code' tells a generic L.A. tale of
sex, drugs, murder, greed and excess, but it's a tale
that the viewer puts together in his own head, which
makes the film a transcendent experience for some, a
vomit-inducing mind-trip for others.</P>
<P>I chose to watch `Time Code' as a glimpse into the
future of experimental cinema. This is the film that
the Danish `purist' movement Dogma 95 has wanted for
years. Figgis' film is structured in such a way that
it's impossible for the viewer not to become engrossed
in the storyline, no matter how phony the improvised
dialogue and rehashed storyline may seem.</P>
<P>He is also blessed with a cast that feels up to the
challenge. Few roles are as tough as the ones Figgis
provides his actors with in this landmark production.
In this film, the performances must be spot-on. No
cuts, no editing, no bullsh*t. Stellan Skarsgard plays
a movie mogul, Saffron Burrows (Figgis' wife) is his
wife and Salma Hayek is his mistress who is engaged in
a relationship with a woman played by Jeanne
Tripplehorn.</P>
<P>The film revolves around one day in the office of Red
Mullet Productions; the site of auditions for a new
Hollywood film. It is a day shaken more by jealousy
and revenge than by the earthquakes that occur every
half-hour. The four-camera structure brings voyeurism
to new heights, giving us a surveillance camera view
into the personal crises of a group of wealthy,
disconnected adults.</P>
<P>Is the quadruple screen tactic annoying? At times,
yes. But it also makes `Time Code' an endlessly
engrossing picture, because if one part of the screen
is boring you, chances are that in another quadrant,
something interesting is occurring. Figgis allows his
viewers to pick and choose, making the film as close
to interactive as possible.</P>
<P>I thought it would be hard for Mike Figgis to regain
my respect, but he does so with one simple line,
spoken in the film by Stellan Skarsgard. A young
Russian filmmaker has come into the Red Mullet office
to explain her next feature film, which sounds a lot
like the basis of `Time Code'. Four cameras will
follow different people and tell the same story.
Skarsgard laughs out loud, proclaiming: `That's the
most pretentious crap I've ever heard!' It's a bravura
moment of self-loathing that single-handedly
apologizes for most of Figgis' career.</P>
<P>The most contrived plot element of `Time Code' is the
earthquake, which was also used in Robert Altman's
similar `Short Cuts' to tie the characters together.
But in `Time Code', the earthquake seems like a
metaphor. With `Time Code', Mike Figgis breaks new
cinematic ground, and hopefully the aftershocks will
be just as powerful.</P>
