<P>     There are moments when THE RELIC is almost enjoyable, albeit in a 
visceral sort of way.  Unfortunately, when all is said and done, this 
horror/science fiction amalgamation seems like nothing more ambitious 
than a bad reworking of elements from ALIENS, SPECIES, JAWS, and 
PREDATOR.  Except for the choice of protagonists and the setting, 
there's nothing remotely new here.  Even the homicidal monster, created 
in the workshop of veteran creature master, Stan Winston, looks like the 
result of mixing and matching some of the most gruesome attributes of 
recent non-human villains.  </P>
<P>     Director Peter Hyams (one of the few film makers to act as his own 
cinematographer), who once helmed Sean Connery in OUTLAND, manages to 
occasionally elevate the tension to a level that arrests the audience's 
attention, but it doesn't lead to anything worthwhile.  The ending is a 
classic example of deus ex machina -- a sudden, unexpected turn-of-
events that leaves movie-goers shaking their heads sadly and wondering 
why the screenwriters couldn't have thought up something more reasonable 
and satisfying. </P>
<P>     Most of the action takes place in Chicago's Museum of Natural 
History, the destination of a mysterious artifact from Brazil.  Shortly 
after its arrival, a security guard is brutally murdered (he's 
decapitated and part of his brain is eaten).  Chicago P.D. Detective 
D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) thinks there's a link between the museum murder 
and a recent massacre on a ship found adrift in Lake Michigan.  As 
D'Agosta's investigation takes him deeper into the bowels of the 
building, he is reluctantly helped by Dr. Margo Green (Penelope Ann 
Miller), an evolutionary biologist who discovers important DNA evidence 
about the killer. </P>
<P>     The second half of the movie, which is by far the most energetic, 
involves a gala celebration at the museum that turns into a bloodbath 
when the creature gets loose and starts beheading people and sucking out 
their brains.  A power failure causes all the security doors to crash 
down, trapping a number of dignitaries inside the building.  This 
results in a cat-and-mouse hunt through unlit, underground tunnels and 
water-filled catacombs, with D'Agosta and Green trying to distract the 
monster so that it doesn't devour the mayor. </P>
<P>     The film is filled with references to DNA, evolution, and all sorts 
of other scientific (or, in some cases, pseudo-scientific) mumbo-jumbo.  
While these may have been important plot aspects of the novel upon which 
THE RELIC is based, all they manage to accomplish here is to add minutes 
to the running time without providing any valuable insight into what's 
going on.  To borrow a term, THE RELIC is basically designed as a "bug 
hunt"; attempts to make it anything more intelligent or interesting 
fail. </P>
<P>     Penelope Ann Miller definitely isn't classic action heroine 
material.  She looks nice in a slinky black dress and can let out a 
pretty decent scream, but she's too petite to get involved in any face-
to-face combat.  As a result, the always-reliable Tom Sizemore is on 
hand to provide some muscle (although he's shut out of the final battle 
by a conveniently-locked metal door).  I suppose these two deserve 
credit for maintaining such a level of earnestness amidst all the 
cliches. </P>
<P>     This kind of movie has a built-in audience, although it's not clear 
how large that audience is.  We've seen so many variations on this same 
story that it's gradually losing whatever appeal it once held.  THE 
RELIC isn't the film to inject new life into the sub-genre.  Instead, 
this is just the latest attempt to milk a mostly-dry formula, and the 
result is what you might expect -- a slick, gory motion picture with 
lots of cheap shocks, including the obligatory cat jumping out of the 
darkness.  Such a poor payoff is hardly a good reason to shell out the 
price of admission at the box office.   </P>
