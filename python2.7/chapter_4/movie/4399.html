<PRE>                              SABRINA (1995)
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Way back, in 1954, Billy Wilder directed the film of the same
name.  It starred William Holden as the man much-too-wealthy -for
his-own-good and Audrey Hepburn as the daughter of Holden's chauffeur.
In the cast, too, was Humphrey Bogart.  The question in my mind is, if
you have a great cast, turn out a very entertaining romantic comedy,
why attempt to "improve" on the original? Are there no more writers
left in the movie world?  Are the producers afraid to take chances,
preferring to go back some forty years to do a remake of a hit?
Sometimes it seems that only the names have been changed ... to protect
the innocent.</P>
<P>     This time around we have equally fine actors.  There's Harrison
Ford (the billionaire ... in 1954 probably only a millionaire) and the
lovely Julia Ormond as the chauffeur's daughter.  Others starring in
the cast include Nancy Marchand, Greg Kinnear and John Wood.  Special
mention should be made of Kinnear.  Music by John Williams, a most busy
man. Also in the cast are Angie Dickinson, and Richard Crenna.</P>
<P>     The dialogue is witty and the film entertaining but there is too
much of the feeling of "How many times have I seen a similar film
before?"  While it is not easy to sneeze at a billionaire's proposal,
(and I do not for one moment believe that the chauffeur's daughter is
that interested in the money,) nevertheless, it occurred to me that
Ford is getting just a teeny bit mature to get the role of the guy who
gets the girl.  Julia Ormond acquits herself well as the young woman
who eventually falls for Harrison.  And did she not used to climb onto
a tree limb and watch the fabulous parties the Harrison family was
giving?  Maybe it was money after all. Naaah.</P>
