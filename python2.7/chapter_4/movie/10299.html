<PRE>"Tomorrow Never Dies" - Lives for Today
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>A British naval ship is engaged in a confrontation with Chinese jet
fighters.  The Chinese insist that the British ship is in Chinese
waters.  The Captain of the ship adamantly states that they are in
international waters, warning that they will defend themselves.  In
the next few tense minutes, the ship begins to sink while one of the
Chinese fighters is destroyed.  Who was in the wrong?  Both nations
begin to prepare for possible war.  Can this volatile situation be
resolved?  British intelligence believes that media mogul, Elliot
Carver (Jonathan Pryce) may have something to do with this, and they
send their best man to investigate.  </P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan is back, and once again handsomely fills the shoes of
James Bond, agent 007 of Her Majesty's Secret Service.  We learn that
Bond once had a relationship with Carver's present wife, Paris (Teri
Hatcher), and is tartly instructed to get reacquainted and to 'pump'
her for information.  Such double entendres is one of the trademarks
of Bond films, and you'll find no shortage here.  The 007 formula also
incorporates a well-choreographed, beginning action sequence; a bevy
of techno-gadgets such as a remote-controlled BMW 750IL; several
frenetic chase sequences; and a charismatic villain with delusions of
grandeur.</P>
<P>The James Bond franchise, to its credit, as been updated to a great
degree.  In this case, the villain is not some would-be terrorist, but
rather a media magnate that wants to launch a worldwide media network.
His avenue of achieving global dominance is not through weapons of
mass destruction but rather instruments of mass information.  Using
his resources, Carver will create the storylines and then subsequently
use his media to sway public opinion. "Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies, and I have my divisions--TV, newspapers [and
other media]," he gloats.  It's a very clever concept.  Also, the
women are a lot stronger and tougher.  M, Bond's female superior, is a
tireless boss that is stern but compassionate.  Accused by a male
counterpart of not having the 'balls' to make a tough decision, she
candidly replies, "at least I don't have to think with them."  Paris
Carver is able to find a soft spot in Bond's cavalier exterior.  But
the best addition is a little firecracker by the name of Michelle
Yeoh.  As a cool-headed agent from China, she uses her formidable
martial arts skills and intelligence to move forward in her mission,
which parallels that of 007.</P>
<P>The one thing that I found distracting about this and most Bond films
is the issue of product placements.  For example, when Q shows Bond
his new remote-controlled BMW, I was waiting for him to start
discussing lease terms.  In fact, I was amazed that I didn't see
Jonathan Pryce driving away in an Infiniti!  Also, there seems to be
less humor and a subtle shift towards the realm of conventional
techno-thrillers.  007 is becoming a more responsible Bond, straying
away somewhat from his tongue-in-cheek origins.  But moviegoers who
have come to expect lots of action and cool toys won't be
disappointed.  The most inventive scene is a nifty chase, where Bond
is in the back seat of his BMW guiding his car via remote control
through a parking garage.  Using a touch pad, he steers and deploys
his arsenal of weapons at the same time, laughing all the way like
some giddy schoolboy.  That is the essence of bond.  That's what makes
him fun to watch.  </P>
