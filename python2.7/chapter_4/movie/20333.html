<P>   There's something pathetic about the yearning of a peoples
who have been freed from their colonialist overlords to
continue identifying with their former rulers.  If you go today
to some developing nations particularly in Africa and parts of
Asia, you'll find that the educated people pride themselves on
speaking the European languages of their previous bosses,
looking down on the majorities who speak merely the
vernacular. Ousmene Sembene captured the servility of the
diplomatic classes in Senegal to the French culture,
particularly to its language and dress, in his masterful film of
government corruption in "Xala."  </P>
<P>   What's perhaps even more wretched is the grandiosity of
those who are low on the totem pole: those who seek to put
themselves a few notches above their countrymen by their
identification with the departed Europeans.  Ismael
Merchant has done a bang-up job in adapting Alexandra
Viets' screenplay, "Cotton Mary," mixing humor, pathos, and
satire in a narrative of a fairly insignificant, middle-aged
Anglo-Indian woman in 1954--seven years after India's
independence from Britain--who refuses to recognize herself
as anything but a representative of British stock.  Her failure
to relate to her birthright as an Indian subject leads to her
rejection not only by the British who stayed on in India after
their government's withdrawal but by her own people and,
even most important, by herself.</P>
<P>   Ismail Merchant, the celebrated director who has long
collaborated with James Ivory to bring us colorful films like
"Shakespeare Wallah" and "A Room With a View," takes us
to a major southern town in the Indian province of Kerala, a
microcosm of the psychological battlefield pitting Indians
against Anglo-Indians, and both against the British who
remain. This is no mere sociological study but a deep-seated
account of one dysfunctional family on the Malabar coast and
their relationships with their servants.  The title character is
portrayed by Madhur Jaffrey, a highly talented woman as
acclaimed for writing a dozen cookbooks that have increased
the popularity of Indian food in the West as she is for acting
in four other Merchant-Ivory productions.  Her character's
deterioration from a person who is already deluding herself
about her status as the daughter of a British regiment officer
to one who has crossed the border into madness is carefully
developed in this 125-minute picture, which conveys the
lovely, exotic ambiance of a town cooled by the breezes of
the Indian Ocean.  Her passive-aggressive relationship with
the British woman who employs her, the confused and
detached Lily Macintosh (Greta Scacchi), styles the entire
film. </P>
<P>   The story opens on Lily, who has gone into labor while her
BBC-employed husband is in the field and not present at the
birth of her daughter.  The life of the prematurely born baby
is imperiled because her mother's breast is dry.  (Formula did
not exist at the time.)  As the little six-pound girl needs milk,
Lily's nurse, Cotton Mary, agrees to take responsibility for
finding a wet nurse--though Lily seems oddly apathetic and
unconcerned about the process.  Lily, whose remote behavior
might remind moviegoers of a similar demeanor from
Julianne Moore in Todd Haynes's film "Safe," employs Cotton
Mary as nanny and housekeeper, her dependence on this
conniving and repugnant woman so great that she allows her
servant too much responsibility.  After firing her long-time
cook, Abraham (Prayag Raaj) at the behest of this woman,
she feels increasingly lost and, given the regular absence of
her handsome and athletic husband, John (James Wilby), she
becomes increasingly withdrawn.</P>
<P>   Credible and moving that Greta Scacchi's performance is,
Madhur Jaffrey is the real jewel of this Merchant-Ivory work. 
As the central bad-guy in a movie that furnishes us with only
one decent principal (Abraham, the loyal attendant), Jaffrey's
Mary appears to relish the ways she destroys the lives of
those about her.  Though she gives hell to a bunch of racist
British women who are friends of her mistress ("You think
because I'm black you can talk to me like that!"), her real
targets are those of her countrymen who are of unmixed
Indian blood.  "You can't trust those Indians," she regularly
exclaims, "They're dirty and they steal."  Successfully bearing
false witness against her co-servant, Abraham, she
nonetheless considers herself a religious person--though she
is obviously using the accoutrements of worship such as The
Lord's Prayer to further her identity with the Anglican British. 
Not surprisingly, her young friend Rosie, who is pale-skinned
and almost able to pass for British, is taken in by Mary's
exhortations.  She dreams of attaining a job in a posh British
home.   When Blossom, who is Mary's sister and the actual
wet-nurse of Lily's baby, remains baffled that the infant's
mother never visits or acknowledges her efforts, she is
unaware that the malevolent Mary has never told her
mistress the identity of this source of nourishment.  The final
scene--a superb payoff that reminds one of Jean Genet's
uncharitable play "The Maids" (about two servants who take
turns playing the role of their employer)--ties the story
together strikingly in a single dramatic confrontation.</P>
