<P>     Stephane (Daniel Auteuil) and Maxime (Andre Dussollier) share a
friendship the closeness of which is unusual between employee and
employer.  Stephane works for Maxime at an exclusive Paris violin
repair shop.  One evening, when the two are at dinner, Maxime announces
that he has fallen in love with a new client, Camille Kessler
(Emmanuelle Beart).  The affair is so serious that Maxime has left his
wife and intends to move in with Camille.  Upon meeting his friend's
new lover, Stephane is immediately intrigued, and the reaction is
certainly mutual.  It doesn't take long for the feelings between the
two to grow, and their contact, while infrequent, becomes increasingly
intimate.  Yet even as Stephane fights to maintain his own emotional
equilibrium, for the first time in her life, Camille loses hers, and
her simple attraction to Stephane becomes an obsession.</P>
<P>     Often foreign films, and French films in particular, are thought
of by the average movie-goer as being exceptionally (and some would say
"overly") intellectual.  This could not be more true than for UN COEUR
EN HIVER, yet it is not merely the mind that this film touches.  The
rich musical score (Ravel) is a feast for the ears, and the exceptional
performances of the principals leads to several emotionally-potent
moments.  UN COEUR EN HIVER is one of those rare films that can be
described as completely satisfying.</P>
<P>     Distilled to its basic essence, the movie is a story that the
French do so well: the romantic triangle.  Beyond the premise,
however, there is nothing ordinary about UN COEUR EN HIVER.  From the
point where Stephane and Camille meet, much of what happens goes
contrary to expectations.  Theirs is definitely not a typical tale of
clandestine love.  Rather, it is an examination of the prices of
emotional honesty and emotional isolation.</P>
<P>     Oddly enough, it's Stephane, the character with the most screen
time (and the man whose heart is "in winter") who remains much the
enigma to the audience.  Even though we come to identify with him, and
understand some of what he does, the depth of his emotions often
remains unclear.  The last scene of the movie explicitly reveals part
of the truth, but for much about Stephane, the viewer must reach his or
her own conclusions.</P>
<P>     Daniel Auteuil plays his role with ability.  His is a difficult
performance to make succeed, given the ambiguity surrounding Stephane,
but Auteuil has found the perfect balance.  At times it becomes
difficult to determine whether Stephane should be pitied or vilified,
and it is to Auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this
uncertainty.</P>
<P>     Camille is no less a complicated character, but her feelings are
simpler to read.  She hides nothing, and when she recognizes that she
loves Stephane, there is no doubt in her mind--or ours--of the
truth.  Especially noteworthy is the way that Camille's sudden, intense
passion for Stephane intertwines, and at times conflicts with her
lifelong love of music.</P>
<P>     Emmanuelle Beart gives an astonishing, unaffected performance.
Emotion is often displayed in the most subtle and easy-to-miss
gestures, expressions, and vocal inflections.  Before beginning
production of UN COEUR EN HIVER, Beart had never played the violin.
After the film's release in France, director Claude Sautet claimed that
she "fooled everyone" with her "perfect motions" (violinist
Jean-Jacques Kantorow does the actual playing).  Not only are her hand
movements accomplished, but the look of rapture on her face as she
loses herself in the music of Ravel is a clear example of how fully
Ms.  Beart allowed the personae of Camille to enfold her.</P>
<P>     Beart explained the importance of coming to understand music as
integral to defining Camille:  "[Director] Claude [Sautet] told me from
the beginning, 'I will only ask one thing of you; play the violin.  The
day you can play the violin, you will be Camille.  There is nothing
more I can tell you about the character.'"  Indeed, it is the
importance of music to Camille that puts every other emotion in the
film, whether displayed by her or by others, into perspective.</P>
<P>     UN COEUR EN HIVER is yet another case of real-life chemistry
translating well to the screen.  Beart and Auteuil are companions away
from their acting, and the spark of this intensity, even unfulfilled as
it is here, is too obvious to miss.</P>
<P>     With the exceptions of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and SOMMERSBY, there
have been no 1993 releases to equal the power of UN COEUR EN HIVER.
Strong characters, intelligent writing, and exquisite performances
combine to draw the audience into the movie.  Mental and emotional
participation are demanded.  This is a movie with deep, churning
currents.  Those who are attracted only to Hollywood's shallow waters
may find UN COEUR EN HIVER too intimidating, but anyone who enjoys a
more complex cinematic experience will find as much as they could hope
for in this picture.</P>
