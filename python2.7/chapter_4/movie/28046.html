Susan Granger's review of "THE TAILOR OF PANAMA" (Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P>  Pierce Brosnan may play a British spy but he's no 007 in
John Boorman's stylish adaptation of John Le Carre's 1996 post-Cold
War thriller. Instead, Brosnan plays a sleazy, disreputable and
disgraced M16 agent who's been sent to Panama City. "It's 'Casablanca'
without heroes," he's told.  His job is to check on drug trafficking
and money laundering. Armed with bribes and a bit of blackmail, he
coaxes debt-ridden Geoffrey Rush to pass along information about his
wealthy customers at the elite Braithwaite & Pendel
custom-tailors. ("That was Mr. Connery's choice," Rush murmurs about a
fabric - wink, wink!) Plus, Rush is married to Jamie Lee Curtis, an
American who works as assistant to the Panamanian director of the
Canal. (Their son is Daniel Radcliffe, the future Harry Potter, and
their daughter is the director's child Lola Boorman.) So when there's
no gossip, Rush invents tantalizing if dubious tidbits, like selling
the Canal, perhaps to China, which immediately ignites a political
drama. Writer Andrew Davis collaborated with Le Carre and Boorman on
the amusingly sophisticated screenplay which evokes memories of Graham
Greene's "Our Man in Havana" and "The Quiet American" with ironic
touches of wit and whimsy, like having Brosnan chat with Rush as they
dance in a gay bar to Irving Berlin's "Let's Face the Music and
Dance."  There's a superb supporting cast: Harold Pinter as Rush's
deceased mentor and conscience, Brendan Gleeson as an alcoholic
revolutionary, Catherine McCormack as a sultry embassy attache, and
John Fortune as the Ambassador. And Philippe Rousselot's
cinematography captures Panama's skyscrapers and squalor. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Tailor of Panama" is a caustic,
clever 8. It's a tantalizing romp of international intrigue.</P>
