FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE
A film by Terence Young
Starring: Sean Connery, Daniela Bianchi, Lotte Lenya, Robert Shaw, and 
Pedro Armendariz
Written by Johanna Harwood and Richard Maibaum
Based on the novel by Ian Fleming</PRE>
<P>    FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, the 2nd entry in the James Bond series, is 
still the definitive Sean Connery as Bond film, and, except for possibly 
GOLDFINGER, the finest film in the series.  A fast-paced, intelligent, 
witty, and suspenseful film, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a magnificent 
entry in the espionage film genre, and a film that just isn't made today 
anymore.</P>
<P>The plot is relatively simple, and quite deceptive.  Bond isn't 
looking to save the world, or prevent nuclear holocaust.  Instead, the 
object in question is a coding maching: a Lecter, the machine the 
Soviets use for all their secret transmissions.  Former KGB agent Rosa 
Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and 5 (Vladek Sheybal), two agents now working 
for SPECTRE, are trying to obtain a Russian coding device to conduct 
criminal operations.  They decide to use British agent James Bond (Sean 
Connery) to obtain the device from Russian cipher clerk Tatiana Romanova 
(Daniela Bianchi).  Romanova is hired by Klebb, acting as a KGB agent, 
to fake a defection and seduce Bond in order to eliminate him.  Once 
Bond has the machine, SPECTRE agent Red Grant (Robert Shaw) is to kill 
Bond, the girl, and take the coding device.  Bond suspects a trap from 
the beginning, but he can't resist the opportunity to get a Lecter, and 
to meet Tatiana.  Once there, he successfully gets the Lecter (and 
romances the girl), before having a memorable train ride with Robert 
Shaw's Grant.</P>
<P>FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is where so many of the trademark 
characteristics of a Bond film became set in stone.  John Barry's theme 
reappears constantly.  The action set-piece before the film's credits is 
also introduced for the first time.  The viewers also get a glimpse of Q 
(Desmond Llewelyn) for the first time, as he devises his very first 
gadget: a briefcase.  The film is also the last to not have the 
excessive gadgetry that have plagued recent Bond films.  The script, 
instead of having outrageously sexist one-liners and pathetic attempts 
at campy humor, is instead more formal, more serious, with emphasis not 
on humor but on the business at hand.  Yet, there is enough of the camp 
element to make the film more than action-entertaining: James Bond is 
also, besides the world's best spy, a downright misogynist dinosaur, and 
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE introduces that subtlely, a trait later Bond films 
forget.</P>
<P>The strength lies in the performances.  Everyone's fantastic, from 
Bianchi, to the excellent Shaw, to Lenya, who gives a marvelous turn as 
Klebb.  Shaw, who would experience his massive burst of fame 12 years 
later in Steven Spielberg's JAWS, is nevertheless quite good in his 
relatively simple role as the psychotic killer.  Lenya is a riot at 
Klebb, who is magnificently portrayed as the man-hater who manages to 
get things done.  The supporting cast, especially the players in 
Istanbul, do a fine job, especially Armendariz as Karim Bey.  There are 
many extravagant set-pieces (the Gypsys, the train, and more...), but 
the film doesn't feel overly stunt-conscious: it is more on the 
cat-and-mouse game played by three sides.</P>
<P>FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, howver, belongs to Sean Connery.  He 
establishes his persona as the coolest human being on the planet with a 
magnificent mix of panache, humor, and cold-hearted boldness.  One of 
the finest scenes is when Bond is carefully checking his room for 
'bugs'.  With the Bond theme roaring in the background, Connery 
calmly checks his room with a cool sense of calm, with an indelible 
strut and manner.  It is this overwhelming sense of intelligence mixed 
with panache and sheer guts that makes Bond such a phenomenal character. 
 Connery is simply stellar: it is simply a seminal performance, with 
enough humor and enough hard-edged toughness to make it magical.</P>
<P>This is one of those great espionage thrillers that focuses on the 
actual spying part.  There are no fierce explosions, or anything of the 
kind.  FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is so good because it actually could have 
happened: this is the stuff spies really do.  There are no overwhelming 
gadgets or toys that the agents use, except their heads.  Bond is so 
much smarter in this film than the later attempts, especially the 
dreadful Roger Moore era.  It is a harder edged film, with a simple, yet 
fast and intelligent plot that relies on conversations, multiple 
characters, and cat-and-mouse games of surveillance, 'bugging', 
and anticipation.  The train scene is the true spectacle: its a stellar 
game of classic suspence.  Like that scene, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a 
classic, knockout film, powered by strong performances, plot twists, and 
intrigue on a grand scale.  One of the best Bonds, and a perfect example 
of what the model should be for all other espionage films to come.  
Fantastic.</P>
