<P>  Remember that song, "When at last our life on earth is
through,/ I will share eternity with you..."?  You've got to like
someone quite a bit to want that, and in "What Dreams May
Come" the world has finally found just that sort of person. 
With a title that pretentiously derives from Shakespeare's
"Hamlet" and a theme that resonates from "Romeo and
Juliet," "What Dreams May Come" is a leading contender for
the year's raspberry awards--perhaps the silliest film since
"The Postman."  The screenplay, such as it is, is by Ron
Bass, who wrote the script to "The Rainman," but perhaps the
credits got it wrong: it seems to have been written by The
Rainman.  As co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. records in the
production notes, one of his lines is "Thought is real and
physical is the illusion."  This is presumably his idea of one of
the better lines in the narrative.  </P>
<P>   The subject of the afterlife, of what happens to us after we
die, has fascinated people for millenia.  We wonder about
reincarnation, westerners perhaps hoping for it while Hindus
consider it a punishment.  We wonder as well about love in all
its ramifications.  Love and death: not only the title of one of
Woody Allen's funniest films but the two subjects that
preoccupy us the most.  It's no wonder that these themes and
also their most cinematic equivalents, sex and violence, have
been the principal focus of poets, philosophers, and
theologians for centuries and filmmakers for a hundred years. 
Combine the two in a single story and you have the potential
makings of big box office.  But treat the subjects as though
you're condescending to a mass audience, challenging them
to understand Great Ideas while dishing out nothing but
affected pap and you're likely to have a flop on your hands.</P>
<P>   "What Dreams May Come" features Robin Williams (who,
like Woody Allen, should stick to comedy), Cuba Gooding Jr.
(likewise), Annabella Sciorra (who is so stunning that even
with a bad rug and crippled colloquy she's a pleasure to
watch), and Max von Sydow (who appears throughout in such
psychic pain and embarrassment he could probably use an
exorcist).  When Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), a doctor who
is able charm a smile out of a migrainous child, dies after a
gruesome auto accident (he is apparently hit on the head by
a flying vehicle), he goes to heaven, and since heaven's
reality is nothing more or less than our thoughts, he is
plunged into the colorful world of his wife's impressionistic
paintings.  He runs into Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is
actually an incarnation of someone he admired on earth, and
is advised that human beings are not their arms or legs or
heart or even their brain.  "The brain is just meat," he
instructs, assuring Chris that we are our thoughts.  So Chris
just keeps conjuring up the lovely paintings of his wife Annie
(Annabella Sciorra) and watches the trees turn into Monets
and even sinks into a pool of paint.  He changes the colors of
a bird faster than a 400 mHz computer with an expert
keyboarder could do the trick.  Meanwhile Annie, having
recently cracked up because both of her children had
previously died in a car accident for which she blames herself,
decides she cannot live without family. She commits suicide
and goes below.  Since hell hath no fury like a man forlorn,
Chris walks, runs and flies to her place of perdition, guided by
The Tracker (Max Von Sydow).  What ultimately happens to
man and wife after they meet is anybody's guess.  Their pet
Dalmation, the only actor too discrete to allow her name to
appear in the credits, is the only rational being in the
narrative.</P>
<P>   It's unfortunate because you'll rarely unearth another film
with such visual imagination and glorious use of color.  When
Chris makes his perigrinations through heaven, the big screen
is awash in all the colors and imaginative design that have
contributed to the reputations of nineteenth century painters
such as Monet and Van Gogh.  His flights over hills and
valleys could have inspired Magritte, his stomping across a
sea of talking heads would please many a German
expressionist.  Since the production insists on a
Shakesperean quote for its title, i.e. Hamlet, Act III, scene i,
it's only fair for the audience to come up with its own.  How
about the one from Richard III, Act I scene iv, "O, I have
passed a miserable night!"</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 113 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
