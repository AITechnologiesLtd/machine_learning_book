<P>Susan Granger's review of "Wrongfully Accused" (Warner Bros.)</P>
<P> Writer/director Pat Proft is an advocate of the "non-stop
jokes" school of comedic film-making. Problem is: they're not very
funny. Amusing, perhaps, but really funny? No. Straight-faced Leslie
Nielsen's game, though. In this parody, he's the stripped-to-the-waist
acrobat from "Lord of the Dance" and an aging wannabe Leonardo Di
Caprio from "Titanic," whose high-on-the deck love scene in the mist
and the rain culminates in a slapstick twist. The story begins like
"The Fugitive," as Ryan Harrison, a superstar classical violinist
(Nielsen) - "Lord of the Violin" - becomes romantically involved with
the sexy, socialite wife (Kelly LeBrock) of his pretentious benefactor
(Michael York). When the tycoon is fatally shot, he's found holding
the gun and wrongfully accused. But, on his way to death row, the
prison transport bus crashes into a train and Nielsen runs for his
life, spewing likes like, "My head is spinning like a dreidel in a
sandstorm." He knows he must track down the one-armed, one-legged, one
-eyed real murderer in order to clear his name. And he's doggedly
pursued by a United States Marshal, Richard Crenna, whose Tommy Lee
Jones imitation is relentlessly dead on. There are giggles - like the
"Baywatch" life guards who spring into action when he's in danger of
being water-logged, the "Braveheart" battle make-up, the "Field of
Dreams" baseball players disappearing into the mist, the "Mission
Impossible" high-wire suspension, and the "ER" public address system
bleating out messages for Drs. Ross, Green, Benton, et all to pick up
their checks, plus evocations of "North by Northwest," "Casablanca"
and other classics. But what Pat Proft really misses are his previous
"Naked Gun" collaborators, Jim Abrahams and David Zucker, who could
put some punch into his scenes and sight-gags. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Wrongfully Accused" is a silly, flimsy 4,
consisting of loosely strung-together movie allusions, cliches, and
quotes.</P>
