<P>     The tag line on the poster read "the best date movie of the '90's"
and, so, I was expecting YACF (Yet Another Chick Flick) for my Sunday
matinee.  Imagine my surprise, then, upon discovering that BEAUTIFUL
GIRLS is actually a *guys* movie.  (Yet Another Dick Flick?) Beauty, and
the male illusion thereof, is the subject of this often-funny ensemble
comedy from director Ted Demme (THE REF).  Matt Dillon, Michael
Rapaport, and Max Perlich are the sad sack snowplow operators of
Knight's Ridge, "MA", who wax poetic on the subjects of marriage ("the
Big Fade"), models ("bottled dreams"), and the brotherhood of men
("never let them see the little man behind the curtain").  The Fourth
Musketeer is Willie (Timothy Hutton), an old school chum who has return-
ed on the eve of their 10-year reunion, to ponder the future of a girl-
friend Back Home.</P>
<P>     Balancing the boys club is an appealing cast of ladies/victims,
which includes Annabeth Gish, Martha Plimpton, and Mira Sorvino.  Rosie
O'Donnell is also on hand, as a Greek Chorus of wisdom who delivers a
side-splitting monologue on the grim realities of "real women." But,
alas, even the luminous Uma Thurman-- as somebody's cousin-- can't
compete with the charms of 14-year-old Natalie Portman (HEAT, THE
PROFESSIONAL).  She's a scene-stealer as the too-smart, too-young
neighbor that Hutton inevitably develops a crush on.  [ And thank
goodness it's platonic!  I'd hate to break any laws by describing
anything otherwise!  ]</P>
<P>     I'm not sure how women will react to this movie.  As an ensemble
comedy, it's okay; the momentum comes and goes, as do the laughs.  The
big cast is underused, but they have their moments, such as an amusing
barroom rendition of "Sweet Caroline" with Hutton and Perlich at the
piano.  Most viewers will react favorably, though, to the faux happy
endings-- there seem to be about four of them-- which give the appear-
ance of resolution and are the likely reasons why somebody labeled this
a "date movie." Don't you be fooled-- the endings are just as phony as
what we saw in WAITING TO EXHALE.</P>
<P>     Writer Scott Rosenberg makes a critical error by letting too many
of the male characters *exhibit* the very behaviors that they (and the
film) are attempting to reflect upon.  Pining for a high-school
sweetheart is one thing; committing adultery is another.  Getting away
from your girlfriend to think things over is fine; getting away to get
drunk or get laid is something else entirely.  So, guys, go see
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.  Take a date, laugh in recognition, and continue to
think that real people actually get *rewarded* for such behaviors.  The
rest of us will be working very hard toward living happily ever after,
in the meantime. </P>
