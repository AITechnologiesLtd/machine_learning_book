                       A film review by Chad Polenz

<P>**1/2 (out of 4  = OK)
1997, PG-13, 105 minutes [1 hour, 45 minutes]
[thriller]
starring: Tommy Lee Jones (Mike Roark), Anne Heche (Dr. Amy Barnes), Gaby
Hoffmann (Kelly Roark), Don Cheadle (Emmit Reese), written by Jerome
Armstrong, Billy Ray, produced by Andrew Davis, Neal H. Moritz, directed by
Mick Jackson.</P>
<P>As a critic, I must remain as unbiased as possible before viewing a film.
But I had mixed feelings going into "Volcano" because I knew what was going
to happen. However, as routine as the film can be, I found myself genuinely
interested throughout.</P>
<P>The film works in the spirit of all big budget Hollywood disaster movies:
something strange is going on... no one knows what exactly... a strong leader
calls in an expert... the expert realizes something terrible is about to
happen... no one believes the expert... disaster ensues. Plus there are many
other elements that are plugged in: canceled vacations, bratty daughters,
offices with lots of computers and video screens, subplots of petty fighting
and bigotry, and of course impressive special effects.</P>
<P>Tommy Lee Jones stars as Mike Roark, the director of L.A.'s Office of
Emergency Management. He's about to go on vacation when some men die from
some sort of geologically related accident, but there's something unusual
about it. He calls in Dr. Amy Barnes (Heche), an "expert" who tells him
what's going on isn't just typical earthquake stuff, but volcanic activity.
It only takes a few scenes for Barnes' theory to be proven true as we see
manhole covers fly into the air and fireballs engulf the sewer system and
subway tunnels... then the real action starts.</P>
<P>And so we get scenes of total devastation with explosion after explosion and
fire after fire while a river of lava slowly flows down Wilshire Boulevard,
consuming everything in its path. </P>
<P>Films like this try to make themselves as plausible as possible by throwing
in scientific jargon that makes perfect sense to us, even though we're not
sure what it means. I found most of the rhetoric here to be easy to swallow,
but I couldn't help feeling it was a little too convincing.</P>
<P>There isn't really a story here, just many scenes of teams of emergency
workers, police, and firefighters doing all they can to stop the lava flow,
evacuate citizens, and help the injured. Some of the individual scenes are
visually impressive but quite cheesy, such as Jones and Heche dangling by a
thread over the lava, or a rescuer using all his will to save someone, but
not himself. There are also two stupid subplots involving racism and
snobbishness that could only happen in L.A.</P>
<P>The characters are a bit bland and recycled though. Jones' Roark is the same
character as Sam Gerard in "The Fugitive." Gaby Hoffmann is sweet at first as
Roark's daughter Kelly, but becomes quite annoying by the end (not that it's
entirely her fault). Heche and Cheadle are obviously going through the
motions, but at least they don't over act, especially considering the
situation.</P>
<P>I can't say much more about the film without nitpicking all its unrealistic
and unbelievable aspects or describing the plot in detail. But for all the
trite aspects and through all the cliches (don't think I didn't notice them),
I couldn't help but be interested in seeing what happens next. The special
effects did make the lava and the sense of disaster realistic, which I'm sure
added to my interest. </P>
<P>"Volcano" certainly impressed me more than "Twister," which is strange
considering how both are such movie machines. It has a few good points and
makes for a fair amount of suspense, but the bad points are obvious and bring
the film down. The title alone is a misnomer, there's no towering volcano
here, just a little stump of one. Maybe it should have been called "The
Secret Of The Ooze" (oh wait, that's already taken).</P>
