A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Wes Anderson</PRE>
<P>Written by: Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson</P>
<P>Starring: Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams, and Bill Murray</P>
<P>Synopsis:
Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) loves writing plays. He is a 15-year-old
boy attending a prep school called Rushmore Academy. Manipulative, Max
claims his barber father is a neurosurgeon, and boasts to other students
about a (fictitious) sexual episode concerning his friend, a pleasant
schoolteacher named Mrs. Cross (Olivia Williams). Soon Max becomes
romantically obsessed with Mrs. Cross, to the point where his antics get
him expelled from school. The depressed teen he realizes he must act
within normal bounds to be socially acceptable.</P>
<P>Opinion:
I was hoping for an offbeat and lighthearted Bill Murray comedy, but was
surprised instead to find a quirky flick about an angst-ridden teenage
playwright. No problem. RUSHMORE starts out with one or two main oddball
characters, and that's a plus. The acting is solid, and you are
immediately pulled in to try to find out what makes the characters tick.
But aside from some flash moments of humor, that's as far and as fresh
as RUSHMORE gets. When the novelty wears off, the rest of RUSHMORE
doesn't seem to be propelled by any kind of dramatic event or
realization other than that time soothes anguish but not insecurity.</P>
