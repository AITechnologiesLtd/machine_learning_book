<PRE>                             IMMORTAL BELOVED
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Columbia's first Famous-Composer
          Bio-Mystery since AMADEUS is a speculation about
          the real-life mystery of to whom Ludwig van
          Beethoven addressed three unsent letters.  He
          referred to the addressee only as his "Immortal
          Beloved."  Gary Oldman is a good choice to play the
          genius who expresses his emotional torment through
          his music.  Still somehow the story is less than
          compelling.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Well, to start with, there probably were three major amors in
Beethoven's life.  And one really was Giulietta Guicciardi; so far the
filmmakers got that one right.  The other two women were Giulietta's
cousin Josephine von Brunsvik, to whom he proposed, and Therese
Malfatti, the daughter of one of Beethoven's doctors.  The film did
show Josephine as a minor diversion and ignored Malfatti altogether.
This is a rough biography of Ludwig Van Beethoven that takes some
liberties to add some suspense.</P>
<P>     There genuinely is a historical mystery, of course.  After
Beethoven's death three letters were found addressed to someone he
called "Immortal Beloved."  It is possible they were just a writing
exercise, though the fact they range from poetic prose to complaints
about his health and his discomfort makes that unlikely.  If they were
to a real person, nobody ever found out to whom the letters were
addressed.  The film suggests that Beethoven (here played by Gary
Oldman), kept this love a secret, then illogically left a bequest to
his "Immortal Beloved" without ever naming the intended recipient.
Anton Schindler, a friend (played by Jeroen Krabbe) sets out, to solve
the mystery. (The real Anton Schindler apparently was a junior
acquaintance of the composer.  Beethoven was born in 1770 and Schindler
was the author of BIOGRAPHIE VON LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN--English title:
BEETHOVEN AS I KNEW HIM--in 1860, some thirty-three years after
Beethoven died.  But Schindler might well have looked for the
mysterious love, so to set up this mystery/biography is really not too
much of a conceit.  Though it is a bit absurd to assume that the
composer would on one hand be so secretive about this love and on the
other hand virtually to force this investigation by leaving her his
fortune.  And, of course, as with AMADEUS, any conclusions the film
draws are purely speculation and should be considered as such.</P>
<P>     The film opens with Oldman living up to his name and near death.
(He looked much the same early in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, but there he
was near death just on the other side.)  Schindler finds the will and
sets out with a list of leads to try to discover who this Immortal
Beloved is.  The structure is like that of CITIZEN KANE and as with
CITIZEN KANE the story of the life is revealed as a mosaic of
flashbacks and here even flashbacks-within-flashbacks, mostly covering
the period from the onset of his deafness to his death.  First
Schindler visits the now-aging Countess Giulietta Guicciardi (Valeria
Golino), whom Beethoven forcefully makes his pupil.  She falls in love
with him and wants to marry him, but she and her father discover a
secret about Beethoven that he cannot bear them to know.  The trail
then leads to Anna Marie Erdody (Isabella Rossellini), a Hungarian
noble who continues the story, and so forth.  Much of the film
concentrates on either on his women, his deafness, or his cruel battle
for custody and control of his nephew.</P>
<P>     Gary Oldman is one of the best and most versatile actors in film
today.  He gives us a very watchable impression of a great genius in
constant struggle with himself and with his own personal demons.
Krabbe's role is less demanding, calling for him to be little more than
a good listener in period clothing.  Galino and Rossellini are winning
but are upstaged by the intensity of Oldman's performance.  In fact the
only other strong performance is by Johanna Ter Steege as the sister-
in-law who fights Beethoven for custody of her own son.  Direction is
by Bernard Rose, director of the off-beat fantasy PAPERHOUSE and of the
horror film CANDYMAN.</P>
<P>     "It is the power of music to carry one into the mental state of
the composer," according to Beethoven.  And Rose seemingly uses this as
the inspiration to score the film with whatever music Beethoven is
composing at each point in time.  Whether he was entirely accurate is
unclear, but he does seem to  proceed though the symphonies in
chronological order.  This means, of course, that the filmmakers get a
glorious, evocative orchestral score simply by making selections.  And
certainly one cannot deny the power of scenes like Napoleon's shelling
Vienna to the strains of the first movement of the Fifth Symphony in
pure digital sound.</P>
<P>     The fragmentation of the narration, using the patchwork narrative
form, and bogging down of the story into a custody battle tend to rob
IMMORTAL BELOVED of some of its power, but the music on a really good
sound system and the crafty proposed solution to the central mystery
make this one of the better musical biographies.  Rating high +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
