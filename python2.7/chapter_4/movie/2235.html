<PRE>                            THE THREE MUSKETEERS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Chris O'Donnell,
           Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, Rebecca DeMornay.
Screenplay:  David Loughery.
Director:  Stephen Herek.</P>
<P>     The epithets practically write themselves.  "Young Swords."
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Musketeers."  "The Three Mouseketeers" (this one
is a Disney product).  Pejoratives all, and all suggesting something
constructed in a zealously commercial fashion.  That's exactly what the
latest incarnation of THE THREE MUSKETEERS is:  pitch meeting
filmmaking in all its overstuffed glory.  What is astonishing is that
something vaguely resembling entertainment emerged.  Thanks to a
high-energy finale and a wonderfully goofy performance by Oliver Platt,
THE THREE MUSKETEERS narrowly avoids complete disaster.</P>
<P>     For those unfamiliar with the basics of Alexandre Dumas' story, it
involves a brash young 17th Century Frenchman named D'Artagnan (Chris
O'Donnell) who yearns to follow in his dead father's footsteps as one
of the king's personal protectors, the Musketeers.  Unfortunately, he
sets out for Paris just as the Musketeers are being disbanded by the
villainous Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry).  Three Musketeers refuse to
surrender their commissions:  Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Aramis
(Charlie Sheen) and Porthos (Oliver Platt).  Together with D'Artagnan,
they set out to foil Richelieu's plans to usurp the throne from young
King Louis XIII (Hugh O'Conor) with the aid of the mysterious Milady de
Winter (Rebecca DeMornay).</P>
<P>     Two huge problems, actually two parts of the same problem of
overly-commercial decision making, thwart THE THREE MUSKETEERS from the
start.  The first is that the casting has virtually nothing to do with
appropriateness for the character.  Kiefer Sutherland is atrociously
wrong as Athos, the former nobleman with a haunted past.  He appears to
believe that a frown is sufficient for showing melancholia, and he
delivers every line exactly the same, as though he were in dire need of
more fiber in his diet.  Charlie Sheen is a bit better for Aramis, but
he too is just plain under-talented.  Chris O'Donnell turns D'Artagnan
into a bland puppy dog, all youthful bluster and no charisma.  Then
there's Tim Curry, who plays Richelieu as half Dr. Frank N. Furter,
half Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham from ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF
THIEVES.  His lecherous grinning and campy one-liners are supposed to
be amusing, but I found them merely sad.  My first rule of
action/adventure films--that they're only as good as their
villains--once again proves true.  Fortunately, as uninteresting as the
rest of the cast is, Oliver Platt is that engaging.  His comic-relief
Porthos could have been awful, but he plays it with devilish
enthusiasm.  Every moment he's on screen is worth watching, and the
laughs he generates are as much out of the fun he is so clearly having
as they are from anything in the script.</P>
<P>     The other big-time mistake is a screenplay by David Loughery and
direction by Stephen Herek that cobbles together elements that worked
somewhere else, apparently under the impression that great pieces from
other films would add up to another great film.  We get Spielberg's
trademark zoom-to-closeup, and entrances and exits by Richelieu,
complete with billowing cape and ominous underscore, that have
"Cardinal Vader" written all over them.  The chase scenes and duels are
lively and fun, but never seemed to be in the flow of the story.  One
of these duels was so reminiscent of THE PRINCESS BRIDE that two
different members of the audience shouted out, "Prepare to die" at
exactly the same time.  THE THREE MUSKETEERS just doesn't hold
together, often looking like it was edited together from other much
better adventure films.</P>
<P>     Yet for all its calculatedness, I must admit that MUSKETEERS does
at least part of what it sets out to do: provide brainless mass-market
adventure.  After a sluggish first hour, it hits a gallop and cruises
to the finish with gusto.  The closing half hour is nearly non-stop
action, some of it surprisingly good.  Perhaps most important, the kids
seemed to love it.  While somewhat violent, it's mostly slapstick, and
appropriate for most of the family.  I didn't laugh a lot, but others
did, and there was some genuine applause.  So go figure.</P>
<P>     THE THREE MUSKETEERS will be compared frequently to Richard
Lester's definitive 1974 version, which is certainly a much better film
overall.  Disney's version doesn't pretend to aim for real wit or
originality, just a big-budget, big-name piece of cotton candy.  There
are worse ways to spend a matinee.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 swordfights:  5.</PRE>
