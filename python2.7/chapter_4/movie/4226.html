<PRE>                           HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1995 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>*
Directed and co-produced by Jodie Foster.
Written by W.  D.  Richter.

      Charles Durning, Geraldine Chaplin, Steve Guttenberg, Claire Danes,
      Cynthia Stevenson.
Distributed by Paramount and Polygram.</P>
<P>     The title "Home for the Holidays" suggests either a feel-good
story, a family drama or a comedy, but guesses can be wrong.  There was
a made-for-TV movie with that title in 1972 which turned out to be a
Christmastime thriller.  Now, the current film's distributors have
announced it as a comedy, but this description will do only if you
stretch it.</P>
<P>     Claudia (Holly Hunter) just lost her job as an art restorer at a
museum.  (You wait a long time to find out that the museum is in
Chicago.)  With some trepidation, Claudia leaves behind her
sixteen-year old daughter (we later learn in passing that Hunter is
unmarried) and flies to another state to spend Thanksgiving with her
parents. (You wait a long time to find out that it is Maryland.  If
your eyes are peeled, you might catch the sign "Maryland Lottery.")</P>
<P>     The opening sequence tries for screwball comedy style, but it is
only slightly weird and far from hilarious.  Soon the film goes into
fast decline, in a structure that is a succession of sections, each
with its title.</P>
<P>     "Flying" is followed by "Mom and Dad."  Mom is Anne Bancroft, nee
Anna Maria Luisa Italiano, one of the very few Catholics who can do a
Jewish Mother turn, which she sort of does here.  Perhaps husband Mel
Brooks is of help.</P>
<P>     Dad (Charles Durning) is a retired something or other employee of
an airline or of the Baltimore airport. (This is made clear only at the
end.)  He is a kind of putterer now.</P>
<P>     Pa and Ma are eccentrics, sort of, but uninteresting as
individuals and as a couple.  If you remember Bancroft as the famously
seductive Mrs. Robinson in 1967 THE GRADUATE, you can now see her in
bra and slip.  She may be showing us how well kept she is at 64, but
her talent does not show in HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.</P>
<P>     The next chapter, "Company," centers mostly around Claudia's
brother Tommy (Robert Downey, Jr.).  Tommy is gay, but you can't tell.
You learn it only when you hear that "he has broken with Jack."  On the
other hand, Tommy is relentlessly gay in the old sense, ebullient,
bouncy and far, far too cute.  You feel right away that Downey is
uncomfortable in, and unconvinced by his role.  He arrives from Boston
with Leo Fish (Dylan McDermott) whom everybody takes for a new lover.</P>
<P>     Each section has Claudia in it but is normally focused on one or
two additional characters.  In "Relatives" we meet Mom's unmarried
sister, retired schoolteacher Geraldine Chaplin.  She too is an
eccentric, unconvincing and unconvinced.  Her closeups are cruel.
Someone flatulates.  There's an in-joke: a furnace repairman works for
"The Big Heat" Company, a reference to a classic film noir.</P>
<P>     In "More Relatives," we meet Claudia's younger sister Joanna, her
sententious husband Walter (Steve Guttenberg) and their two kids.  The
house becomes a zoo of agitation and hyperactivity, forced and seldom
funny.  Only the cat is normal.</P>
<P>     Next, "The Dinner" reveals that Tommy had married Jack some time
ago.  Joanna calls Tommy a freak.  He keeps his good mood but overacts
again.  By accident, Joanna gets a plateful spilled on her dress.  It
turns out that Leo Fish is heterosexual.  Geraldine Chaplin
passionately kisses Dad--on the mouth.</P>
<P>     Watching the slicing of the turkey, it dawned on me that this film
was trying to be a slice of life.  But it is also a turkey that Jodie
Foster directed--her second effort, after LITTLE MAN TATE.  Just as
responsible is the uneven writer W. D. Richter, whose biggest hit was
the dubious BUCKAROO BANZAI.  His best works were SLITHER, NICKELODEON,
and the excellent remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  The Stephen
King story he scripted before HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS was the disastrous
NEEDFUL THINGS.</P>
<P>     In "Cleanup" Claudia's daughter calls, tells mom that she is
disgusted with her boyfriend and is still a virgin.  Tommy and Walter
have a fight.  Jack telephones Tommy.  Tommy is happy.  The marriage is
on again.  The movie turns "sensitive."</P>
<P>     "Now What?"  follows.  Here, this mish-mashy, misguided,
mis-written film predictably brings together Leo Fish and Claudia.
Earlier, Leo was passable as a quiet observer.  Now that he emotes, he
is artificial.  The couple have a too-cute impromptu date and kiss.
Taking leftovers to Joanna's house, the sisters have a heart-to-heart
talk.  Says Claudia:  "We don't have to like each other.  We're a
family."  This, I guess, is the moral of the story.</P>
<P>     Viewer Liberation comes with "The Point."  Claudia and Leo, by
mutual consent, will not have sex as they are going in different
geographic (and other) directions.  Dad watches home movies.  More
sentiment.  The real point is that this movie is pointless.  That not a
single performer is explored, seems to believe in his part, plays well,
is involving, That no one uses more than two basic expressions.</P>
<P>     Claudia takes the return plane.  Who comes in but Leo, with a
ridiculous lamp (don't ask)?  He proposes that they spend the two-hour
flight sitting together.  Perhaps they'll go to sleep.  That's what the
film's audience ought to do too.</P>
