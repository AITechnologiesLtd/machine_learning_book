<P>     Illeana Douglas (TO DIE FOR) gives a command performance as Denise
Waverly, a singer-songwriter trying to launch a musical career in the
late '50's, when such combinations were unheard of.  After an aspiring
producer (John Turturro) pitches the prospect of putting her words in
other people's mouths, she's soon churning out the hits in Broadway's
fabled Brill Building.  Director Allison Anders (GAS FOOD LODGING and
one of the more-dreadful segments of FOUR ROOMS) piles on the drama.
Her slick, surface-level approach also keeps us from getting close to
the characters, even the one played by the marvelous Ms. Douglas.  (You
name the fate and it happens to Denise Waverly.  And then she writes a
song about it.)  What really reeks, though, is a sound recording that 
you can't believe is real for a minute.  Each singer seems dubbed and 
each song sounds like a track from a freshly pressed compact disc.  
Just terrible.  Sure, Phil Spector might appreciate this "wall of clean
noise," but, for the sensitive ear, it's a distraction that's all but
unlistenable.  Not good in a movie about music.  </P>
