<PRE>               A film review by Vince Waldron</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Vince Waldron</PRE>
<P>British director Mike Leigh's latest examination of class and the human
comedy in his native land may well be his most successful film to date,
which--in a long line of esteemed comedies that includes Naked, Life is
Sweet and the justifiably lauded High Hopes--is saying something. 
Beatuifully modulated performances and a deceptively complex screenplay
make this Leigh's most satisfying and accessible film yet, a work of
unassuming ambition, this one will sneak up on you.   Highly recommended,
go see it (or--sigh!--rent it if indeed that's the only way this worthy
film is distributed in your home town.)</P>
