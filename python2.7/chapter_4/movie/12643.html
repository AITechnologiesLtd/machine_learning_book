<PRE>                               BULWORTH</PRE>
<P>Warren Beatty directed, produced and co-wrote the very innovative
BULWORTH.   Long associated with liberal politics, he  here tears into
the political world with its frauds, with no holds barred.   This
results in a hard-hitting, way out film that is a pleasure . . . at
least most of the time . .  to watch.</P>
<P>As the titles appear on the screen, we are barraged with a platitude,
the political commercial, "We stand at the doorstep of a new
millennium."  Over and over and over.</P>
<P>Jay Bulworth is an incumbent United States Senator running for
re-election in the 1996 primaries.  He  has been campaigning hard and
is a nervous wreck. When Graham Crockett (Paul Sorvino) a crooked
lobbyist approaches to make a deal for him to vote "correctly" on some
insurance legislation,  Bulworth asks and receives a ten million
dollar life insurance policy.   He then  arranges to have someone
assassinate him, thus assuring that his daughter will be financially
secure.</P>
<P>No longer having to worry about what to say and act in order to be
re-elected, he goes wild with his new-found freedom of saying whatever
he wishes, however outrageous and politically incorrect it may be.  It
is this new person about whom the movie revolves, frequently in scenes
of great hilarity.    In all of this, Bulworth suddenly finds he wants
to live, especially after  having met the beautiful black Nina (Halle
Berry) and has to contact his assassin, Vinnie (Richard Scott
Sarafian)  to cancel  his murder.     That is more easily said than
done.</P>
<P>Bulworth visits Black churches and tells them, in rap, what they are
doing wrong, how they will never get anything they want unless they
become activists and stop supporting the black athlete who most
believe stabbed his wife.   To Hollywood VIPs he tells  that their
movies are worthless junk.  He alienates Jewish bigwigs.  In short, he
runs a campaign such as no one has nor will ever run again.</P>
<P>Where I got lost was when the wild Bulworth starts doing rap.   It was
just a bit too way out for me who believes "rap music" is an oxymoron.
In this case, though, the lyrics (when I could understand them) were
very good and to the point.</P>
<P>Many fine supporting roles but most noteworthy is that of Oliver Platt
as Murphy, Bulworth's Chief of Staff, who stays with him through thick
(but in the end) not thin.</P>
<PRE>                      Directed by Warren Beatty.
