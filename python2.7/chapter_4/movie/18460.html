<P>   Let's take for granted that most liberal, broad-minded
moviegoers would like to a society that is not racist, one in
which extreme beliefs of any sort are unwelcome and in
which people of all races, national origins and religions get
along and even fall in love with one another.  But how
didactic our school lessons on these issues have been!  And
how intriguing a good, sincere, solid and well-developed film
can put dramatic and comic touches alike on these themes. 
One such adventure in storytelling is Hanif Kureishi's "My
Son the Fanatic," with Udayan Prasad at the helm and
featuring one of India's most celebrated performers, from
whose point of view the tale progresses.  </P>
<P>   The movie, which takes place in Northern England in an
area inhabited largely by immigrants from Pakistan centers
on Parvez (Om Puri), a middle-aged man who drives a taxi
for a living.  A hard-working fellow who puts in twelve hours a
day, Parvez tries to make ends meet by hooking up rich
clients (including tourists) with prostitutes in the area.  He is
particularly fond of one streetwalker, the lonely Bettina
(Rachel Griffiths), whom he recommends highly to a notably
prosperous German businessman, Schitz (Stellan Skarsgard. 
Though in some circles Parvez could be considered a pimp,
one who goes so far as to arrange orgies as well as handle
the driving, we in the audience see him as a decent, secular
Muslim who has largely assimilated into the British culture. 
Nonetheless, in one embarrassing instance he is taunted by a
racist stand-up comedian.  He cannot count on his home life
for relaxation: his wife Minoo (Gopi Desai) is never "tender"
with him and though she wears conventional South Asian
dress she complains that Parvez never takes her anywhere. 
What is more disturbing is that his 18-year-old son, Farid
(Akbar Kurtha), has just broken off his engagement to the
daughter of the chief police inspector and has joined a
Muslim fundamentalist group which preaches against "white
and Jewish propaganda that there is nothing to our lives but
the empty accountancy of things."</P>
<P>   Though Parez is indeed pimping to raise extra money to
support his family and has taken to more than casual
drinking, he gains the sympathy of the audience by his
tolerant demeanor, particularly for the empathy he feels
toward one hooker.  He relies on Bettina to provide him an
understanding ear for his distress at his son's new zealotry
and, despite their differences in age and religion, Parvez falls
in love with the younger woman and starts an affair. 
Bettina's is attracted to Parvez who, she feels, is the only
man who has not exploited her, and when they kiss she
declares that he is the first man with whom she has done this
in a long time.</P>
<P>   Essentially, through its involving story featuring well-
developed characters, "My Son the Fanatic" takes a noble
stand against extremism of all kinds.  The fundamentalist 
Pakistanis are skewed, particularly for their hypocrisy (the
bearded head of the local cult, a man who whines about
England's corruption, asks for Parvez's help in arranging for
additional immigration), and partly because they take the law
into their own hands.  In the picture's most dramatic episode
given added tension because the tautness is carefully built
up, a band of fundemantalists attack a whorehouse, lobbing
Molotov cocktails through the windows and punching out the
women as they flee into the street.  But writer Hanif Kureishi,
though his principal character, takes a stand as well against
the hedonistic businessman appropriately named Schitz and
played villainously by the wonderful Stellan Skarsgard.  Schitz
uses his hooker as a plaything, giving lavish tips to Parvez
for catering to his needs, but cares nothing about anyone but
himself.  We can see that Farid's rage against the secular,
capitalistic state is fired by his experience with people like
Schitz and also by the behavior of his dad--who, though a
Muslim, is absolutely tolerant of prostitution.  Because these
motivations are carefully developed, we wonder at the essay
of critic Harvey Thompson of the World Socialist Web Site,
which finds a weakness in that "the explanation of
[fundamentalism's] attraction for large numbers of youth is
somehow shallow."</P>
<P>   "My Son the Fanatic" is solid fare for the arthouse circuit
with particularly fine performances from veteran actor Om
Puri ("Gandhi") and Rachel Griffiths ("Hilary and Jackie").  It
should serve to make thoughtful people even more
maddened by the so-called high government officials who
pronounced a death sentence on Salman Rushdie.</P>
