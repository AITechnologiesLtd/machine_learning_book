<PRE>                                 SUPERCOP
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1996) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Jackie Chan has been making action movies for almost 
twenty years, but the Western world has only recently begun to 
notice him. Earlier this year came RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, 
which made Schwarzenegger look like a blue-screen amateur. 
Chan did all his own stunts in a movie that cleverly orchestrated 
a lot of them, from the fights instituting pinball machines and 
shopping carts to jumps from bridges onto boats. It would have 
been incredibly hard to top the sheer action in RUMBLE IN THE 
BRONX, so what did the SUPERCOP people do? They went for 
comedy.</P>
<P>        No, really. There are three credited writers for SUPERCOP, 
each of which probably contributed one laugh to the movie for its 
comic scenes, which mostly look awkward and pathetic. I'm 
wondering if the past forty years worth of American sitcoms 
have made it over to Hong Kong yet. If so, they know about the 
age-old setup where someone is pretending to be someone else and 
has to identify relatives in pictures and make up memories about his 
fake identity. It's not that funny here but serves only as chainlinks in 
the action fence. Unfortunately, the action fence in SUPERCOP isn't 
as tall or intricate as in RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, and so has to 
stand up on its own.</P>
<P>        Chan plays a Hong Kong detective who is assigned to 
go undercover in China as a drug-busting supercop. First comes 
the scene where Chan meets his superior, who turns out to be an 
attractive (in an Asian sort of way) woman, then comes the scene 
in which Chan must impress a roomful of trained Chinese cops and 
army soldiers. In the predictable comic style we've seen in our forty 
years of sitcoms, he at first acts embarrassed and reluctant, then 
lets the guy kick his butt a little bit and finally just cuts loose and 
whoops some ass.</P>
<P>        With that out of the way, Chan gets down to business, 
posing as a prisoner. He helps a felon break out of a chain gang 
in one long, martial arts-ridden scene and earns the guy's trust while 
saving his life over and over again. Chan eventually gets taken to 
the big boss, his female superior en tow posing as his sister. She 
comes aboard after a scene in which Chan and some felons visit 
his "family," which consists of all undercover cops and actors, 
including a man dressed up as his senile, nearly-blind mother. All 
of this is supposed to be funny and some of it actually is because 
it's so unknowingly cliched.</P>
<P>        The last thirty minutes of the movie contains the non-stop 
action climax, involving a train, a helicopter and a lot of violent 
fights. None of this is anything new but it's rendered exciting by 
the fact that there are no stuntmen or blue screens. Like RUMBLE 
IN THE BRONX, there is a collection of outtakes during the credits 
that show some of the lesser-executed takes of some of the stunts, 
as when people fell off of moving cars onto the highway or the 
motorcycle jump missed the train entirely.</P>
<P>        There's nothing fake about the action scenes in a Chan 
movie. The actors really are jumping motorcycles on the top of 
trains and hanging precariously from helicopter ladders. That fact 
alone redeems the terrible dialogue, recycled comedy and techno 
versions of "Stayin' Alive" on the soundtrack. And if there had 
been more action to offset the other slow-moving scenes, it would 
have been a good movie instead of just a pretty-good one. RUMBLE 
IN THE BRONX had far more action scenes and was far better, but 
SUPERCOP is still an exciting movie at least part of the time.</P>
