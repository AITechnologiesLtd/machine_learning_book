<P>"Character," this year's Oscar-winner for Best Foriegn-Language Film, could
almost be the Dutch answer to "Les Miserables." It can't be sheer
coincidence that loaves of stolen bread are what set in motion the tragic
power struggle between Jacob Katadreuffe (Fedja van Huet), an ambitious law
officer worker, and his secret father, a merciless court bailiff named A.B.
Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir).
Twenty years earlier, Dreverhaven seduced his housekeeper Joba (Betty
Shuurman), an eerily silent young woman, and the one-time tryst resulted in
Joba's pregnancy. Though Dreverhaven offered both marriage and money, Joba
coldly refused to have any further contact with him, choosing to weather the
insults of her neighbors rather than wed a man so callous he evicts
destitute people -- even the sick -- from his properties without a second
thought.
Jacob grows up trying his best to keep his distance from Dreverhaven, only
to be drawn directly into his father's power when he unknowingly borrows a
sizable amount of money from Dreverhaven's bank. That major mistake will
come back to haunt the youth again and again as he tries to build a decent
life for himself in depressed 1920s Rotterdam. It seems every time Jacob is
on the verge of getting ahead, Dreverhaven turns up to knock him back down.
Adapted by screenwriter-director Mike Van Diem from the 1938 Dutch novel of
the same name by Ferdinand Bordewijk, "Character" is relentlessly grim, two
hours spent with a handful of miserable, monochromatic people, all of whom
are either unable or unwilling to reach out to one another.
That said, the movie is also extremely well-made, with much attention paid
to period detail and, since the actors are often non-verbal, to the
subtleties of its performances. First-time director Van Diem has bathed the
picture in a gorgeous gloss that complements the script's melodramatic
aspects; rain, shadows, fog and murky streetlights are all used to great
effect.
Jacob's fight to get out from under Dreverhaven's thumb is compelling, but
many viewers will find themselves wishing Van Diem had spent a bit more time
with some of the less angst-ridden figures in the story, such as Lorna Te
George (Tamar van den Dop), the co-worker who catches Jacob's eye, or Joba's
boarder, a fledgling Communist named Jan Maan (Hans Kesting) who resents his
snobby family. Though "Character" is fine for what it is, a little levity
would have made the gloomy atmosphere slightly less oppressive.
