 Hamlet (2000) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Ethan Hawke, Julia Stiles,
Kyle Maclachlan, Liev Schreiber, Bill Murray and Diana Venora. Based on
the play by William Shakespeare. Adapted and directed by Michael
Almereyda. Rated R.</P>
<P> To bore or not to bore? That is the question that ruminates through the
latest reincarnation of William Shakespeare's venerable "Hamlet."</P>
<P> This truncated, contemporary outing features Ethan Hawke as the
melancholy New Yorker, for that is where this latest adaptation has been
relocated. Forget the foreboding battlements of Elsinore, it's now an
upscale Midtown hotel.</P>
<P> Taking a page from recent Shakespearean ventures - most notably Buz
Luhrmann's "Romeo and Juliet," which transposed the tragic tale of
doomed lovers to contemporary Florida - director Michael Almereyda, who
also adapted the classic - has set his story of murder, foul love and
intrigue in the high-powered corporate world.</P>
<P> Hamlet, the president and C.E.O. of the Denmark Corp., has died. His
brother, Claudius, not only has taken over the conglomerate, but has
married his sister-in-law, Gertrude. This, of course, doesn't sit well
with young Hamlet. Well, you know the rest.</P>
<P> While the concept has merit, the execution is flawed. The movie
features several shots of New York landmarks, yet Almereyda doesn't take
advantage of any of them. A few scenes are filmed on Gotham's sidewalks,
but the rest are set either in the hotel or Denmark's corporate
headquarters.</P>
<P> Unlike, "Macbeth" or "Henry V," Shakespearean plays that can be `opened
up' for film, celluloid "Hamlet's" - ranging from Olivier's 1948 version
to Kenneth Branagh's 1996 treatment - always have stayed close to or
within the confines of Elsinore, giving the tragedy the claustrophobic
atmosphere needed to help accentuate the calamities that lie ahead.</P>
<P> So, setting the story in New York, one of the most picturesque cities
in the world, appears more as a gimmick than a dramatic device to
benefit the action.</P>
<P> Indeed, this "Hamlet" is rather flat, disjointed and flabby. Even
though the running time is just a few minutes over two hours, the play
seems to drag - as if everything was unfolding in slow motion.</P>
<P> Almereyda does create some visually interesting notions. Instead of
staging a play `to catch the conscience of the king,' Hamlet offers a
video presentation of his father's murder. And the director stages the
`to be or not to be' soliloquy in a video store with the monitors
surrounding Hamlet running scenes of death and destruction.</P>
<P> But the main problem with "Hamlet" is its casting. The title role is
simply beyond Hawke's range. Wearing a snow cap that makes him look like
the twin brother of Billy Bob Thornton from "A Simple Plan, "Hawke
merely sulks and whines.</P>
<P> True, he is supposed to be a melancholy Dane, but Hamlet is also
supposed to be a man of intellect and action, a schemer who can fake `an
antic disposition,' a man of words who can open his mother's eyes to
point out the errant behavior.</P>
<P> Hawke's Hamlet is a wuss, which makes it difficult to comprehend,
firstly, why Ophelia can be smitten with such a dolt, and, secondly, why
Claudius can be so concerned about his actions.</P>
<P> Hawke's Hamlet is too passive, too soft. He lacks the underlying rage
called for in the role.</P>
<P> Julia Stiles ("Ten Things I Hate About You)" seems out of her depth as
Ophelia. She plays her as a petulant, spoiled teen-ager. Her reading of
the lines is flat and unconvincing.</P>
<P> Kyle Maclachlan lacks the majesty needed for Claudius and, more
importantly, fails to display the charisma with which he could have so
quickly wooed his sister-in-law.</P>
<P> Diana Venora as Gertrude shows some passion and lust, and a bit of
insight toward the finale.</P>
<P> The two best performers are, ironically, Bill Murray as Polonious and
Liev Schreiber as Laertes.</P>
<P> Murray is comically sly and wise as Claudius' main counselor, while
Schreiber displays the appropriate spirit and rage needed as Hamlet's
main rival.</P>
<P> Overall, though, this "Hamlet" can be considered a failed experiment.
Setting the play in contemporary times while maintaining Shakespeare
iambic pentameter may have seemed like a novel approach, but somehow it
sounds disconcerting and pretentious.</P>
<P> It is rather empty. This "Hamlet" lacks spark, fire and, most of all,
majesty. "Hamlet" is a drama that should be larger than life. This
version plays like a Fox network soap opera.</P>
