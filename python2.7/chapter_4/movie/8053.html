<P>     NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN adapts Robert Daley's pulp novel "Tainted
Evidence," about a New York City Assistant District Attorney (Andy
Garcia), whose first big case is prosecuting the cop-killing drug dealer
who wounded his police officer father (Ian Holm, yes, Ian Holm).  If
that premise is difficult to swallow, don't even bother with the later
scenes, when bozo time compression makes months pass as minutes and
Garcia's character is suddenly elected the new District Attorney.  (And
very little of which bothered me.  I took offense to the abrupt addition
of Lena Olin's love interest.  In her scant scenes, she adds nothing.)
While it plays like a three-hour movie condensed into the space of two,
there are several riveting sequences, excellent acting across the board,
and a tidy lesson about the grayscales of justice.</P>
