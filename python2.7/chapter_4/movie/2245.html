<PRE>                            MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
                       A film review by Gregory N. Bond
                        Copyright 1993 Gregory N. Bond</PRE>
<P>Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves,
          Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Michael Keaton, Ben Elton.
Director: Kenneth Branagh
Script:   Some bloke named Shakespeare.</P>
<P>[Probably old news to many, but it's just opened here]</P>
<P>     I went into MUCH ADO with very high expectations.  Branagh's
previous Shakespeare project (HENRY V) was a wonderful movie, and the
reviews I had seen about MUCH ADO were uniformly good (the best set of
reviews I'd ever seen for a film).</P>
<P>     I came out knowing that every one of those rave reviews was right
on the money.  This is the best film I have seen in years.</P>
<P>     MUCH ADO is the story of two pairs of lovers, the young and
innocent Claudio and Hero (two good-looking nobodies with very few
lines) and the older, sharp-tongued and cynical Baldick and Beatrice
(Branagh and Thompson).   There is celebration, betrayal, revenge, and
weddings.</P>
<P>     The dialog crackles and fizzes (as would be expected given the
author), with quips, puns, one-liners and razor-sharp wit flowing
faster than I could follow.  This is a *very* funny film despite being
in somewhat archaic language.</P>
<P>     The cast does a magnificent job.  Chief among them are of course
Branagh and Thompson.  Both have such fluency with the style and such
assured delivery that the antiquity of the language isn't even
noticed.  Branagh in particular shows an excellent sense of comedy in
both his acting and direction.  There is a long sequence when he is
hiding in the garden eavesdropping on a conversation, that is almost
Keystone Cops.</P>
<P>     The remainder of the cast does an excellent job, also handling the
language well.  Some interesting casting puts Denzel Washington and
Keanu Reeves as half-brothers, and all actors use their own (American
or English) accents, but the overall result is still consistent and
reputable.</P>
<P>     The cinematography is just fabulous.  The whole film was shot on
location at a Monastery in Tuscany, and it looks just superb.  The
soundtrack could be criticised for a lack of period relevance and being
at times quite overpowering, but it is none the less effective.  A
number of lute and voice songs are woven into the story in a very
effective manner.</P>
<P>     Overall, this film is simply a delight.  Run, don't walk, to your
nearest cinema and see it on the big screen.  It's worth every penny of
the AU$10 you will pay.</P>
<PRE>Greg.
