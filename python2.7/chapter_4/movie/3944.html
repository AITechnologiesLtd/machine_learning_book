<PRE>                               THE NET
                       A film review by Ed Powell
                        Copyright 1995 Ed Powell</PRE>
<P>     Going into this movie, I thought it was just going to be another
film that's trying to cash in on the "Information Superhighway" buzz,
and overglorifies computers and the Internet.</P>
<P>     When I left disgusted 45 minutes later, that view hadn't really
changed.</P>
<P>     The story of the film is about a professional computer program
beta-tester, virus-healer, web-surfer, and all-around computer hacker
(played by Sandra Bullock), who gets hold of a computer program that
gets the user into restricted areas of the Internet.  Some group
somehow finds out about this program, and nearly gets the disk from the
character played by Sandra when she vacations in Cancun.  She manages
to keep the disk, but the group starts to make her life unlivable, by
changing around her police record, DMV records, selling her house (?),
etc., etc., etc., ... all by using computers, of course.</P>
<P>     It seems to me that the writers forgot that life is not an episode
of "Max Headroom."  The writers also seem to have forgot that what
personal information that IS stored on computer (police records, IRS
whatnot, DMV, just to name the few that are on the top of my head), YOU
CANNOT READ, NEVER MIND CHANGE, THAT DATA BY USING THE INTERNET!!!  And
even if you could, THERE WOULDN'T BE FANCY-SCHMANCY GRAPHIC INTERFACES
FOR DOING IT!!!</P>
<P>     You see, most government agencies do something smart (for a
change).  They make damn sure that any vital computer data is protected
by the most hacker-proof method around: no network or modem connections
to the computer, period.</P>
<P>     To make a long section short, the plot, story, and writing suffer
from two incurable problems: unbelievability and stupidity.</P>
<P>     As for acting, fairly average all around.  Sandra Bullock
portrayed a sterotypical hacker with little social skills
well ... although I do not think that this role was well suited for her.</P>
<P>     I can't say much about design.  It looked as if this movie was
shot completely on location, with little set building whatsoever.</P>
<P>     I can't say much about special effects either ... other than Sandra
Bullock in a bikini <g>.  I suppose that you could group the computer
screens into the effects group, and they suited the movie well ... but
that isn't a compliment.</P>
<P>     Irwin Winkler (any relation to Henry?  Inquiring minds want to
now), who directed this cinematic trainwreck, looks like he was
trying to overdramatize the film.  Many shots were not well suited for
the action.  Perhaps he should take a refresher course in basic
directing.</P>
<P>     Overall, this movie sucked.  At least the first 45 minutes of it
did.  As a MSTie*, I have watched many a bad movie, and I think I could
recommend this one to be added to the stack of material to be made fun
of.  Don't waste your money on this.  I think I'd rather see 'Batman
Forever'.</P>
<P>Produced by Irwin Winkler and Rob Cowan, directed by Irwin Winkler.  A
Columbia Pictures release.</P>
<P>* A MSTie is a fan of the brilliant TV show 'Mystery Science Theater 3000'
(shown on Comedy Central).  In a nutshell, MST3K takes bad movies, and has a
guy and two 'robots' sitting in an orbiting movie theater, talking back to
the film and generally making fun of it.  It's a great show ... you should
watch it.</P>
