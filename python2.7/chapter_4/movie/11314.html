<PRE>Lots to See in "Dark City"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>A man (Rufus Sewell) abruptly wakes up.  Blood trickles down his
forehead.  He sees a syringe on the floor.  He is noticeably
disoriented.   Everything seems strangely out of synch and we wonder
along with him what's going on.  He can only remember that his last
name is Murdoch but nothing else.   Suddenly, the phone rings, and he
is warned to leave immediately.  "They are already on their way," says
the mysterious voice on the other side urging him to get out.  As he
flees the building, he notices one incredibly strange thing. -- it
seems that time has stopped.  All movement has ceased right down to
the pendulums on a clock except for our man and those that are chasing
him.  Who are these people that are chasing Murdoch?  What makes
Murdoch special enabling him to stay 'awake' when everyone else
becomes frozen in time.  What is the secret of Dark City?</P>
<P>"Dark City" is a retro-futuristic noir thriller that is set in a place
of clouded memories, endless nights, and ever-changing landscapes.
The underground denizens are referred to as 'The Strangers'.
Ghoulishly pale and bald-headed, they possess telepathic powers and
come out at night like goblins to initiate their experiments on the
city and its residents.  At the stroke of 12, the Strangers initiate a
telepathic process called 'tuning' which enables them to alter reality
and stop time.  Murdoch, however, seems immune to this and in fact
seems to be developing powers that makes him stronger than the
Strangers.  To the Strangers, this is a threat that must be
eliminated.  To capture Murdoch, they come out to hunt him late at
night when they can stop time.  During the other parts of the day,
they wait for the police to capture him, for Murdoch is wanted for
questioning in connection with a murder case.  As the movie develops,
Murdoch soon regains more of his memory, and in order to further
understand the nature of the Strangers and the city itself, he seeks
help from his wife (Jennifer Connelly); the Inspector in charge of
capturing him (William Hurt); and an enigmatic psychologist that may
hold the key to his memory loss (Kiefer Sutherland).  </P>
<P>While we are entranced with Murdoch as he tries to unravel the
mystery, the greatest triumph of this movie is the city itself.
Gothic and impressive, it suggests an indistinct time period.  The
secrets within the city make her just as important a character as any
of the humans.  As a science-fiction piece, it plays with our
imagination and satiates our appetite for inventiveness.  The
cinematography is beautiful as scenes are filmed at strange angles and
in hallways, corridors and alleyways that connote an eerie sense of
claustrophobia.</P>
<P>As a drama, thriller and romantic vehicle, it sustains our interest
and unfolds slowly enough to pique our curiosity yet quickly enough to
satisfy our need to know.  Moreover, it is a visual experience that is
haunting yet captivating.  But without a doubt, it is destined to be
one of the most unique-looking films of this year.  With it's spooky
industrial soundtrack, stylish presentation, and nice pace, "Dark
City" is certainly worth visiting.</P>
