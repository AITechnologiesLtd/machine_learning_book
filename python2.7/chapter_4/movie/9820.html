<PRE>Kiss The Girls (1997)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
(C) 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: Not the narrative juggernaut that SE7EN was, but a smart and
well-wired thriller nonetheless, with sterling performances all around.</P>
<P>KISS THE GIRLS had many people muttering "SE7EN knock-off" when the trailers
ran for it. It's understandable: Both films feature Morgan Freeman on the
trail of a serial killer of fiendish intelligence and cleverness. There, the
similarities end. KISS THE GIRLS is not the monster that SE7EN was, but is a
well-made and intelligently assembled movie that packs a good deal of power.</P>
<P>>From the moment Morgan Freeman appeared on the screen, no convincing is
needed to tell us that Alex Cross, his character in GIRLS, is not Detective
Somerset from SE7EN. He is not rehashing the role; this is a new character
built from the ground up, and it's a testament to Freeman's skill as an
actor that we can sense this instantly, just from the way he sizes up a
roomful of evidence and talks down a suicidal woman.</P>
<P>Cross's niece has gone missing, and he journeys to North Carolina, fearful
that the girl may have become the victim of a serial killer who bills
himself as "Casanova". He is right, and he also makes a slew of educated
guesses as to the killer's m.o.: Casanova isn't so much a killer as a
collector, and is hard at work throwing the cops off the trail with
deceptive murders.</P>
<P>Then there's a huge break in the case: a doctor, Kate McTiernan (Ashley
Judd, her best role so far), manages to escape from the lair where she and
several other kidnapped girls are being held. She is full of guilt over not
having been able to free the other girls, but Cross is determined to find
Casanova as well. They're a nice team; they break out of the one-up/one-down
dynamic that so many movies like this set up.</P>
<P>There's a great deal more to the plot than would be fair to reveal in a
review. I will say that the movie has one piece of deception in store that
seems out of keeping with its ambitions. For most of the way, KISS THE GIRLS
is content to give us a solid story that springs out of the motivations of
the characters, known or unknown -- in other words, it's not critical that
we know who the killer is. Then in the final act, we find out that it's
someone we've already been introduced to, and that slightly undermines what
came before. It's not a fatal mistake, and there are probably many people
who won't object to it, but it seems somewhat tacked-on.</P>
<P>Despite this, KISS THE GIRLS makes a fine addition to a small list of movies
that intelligently explore the concept of obsessives and serial murder, and
that do it with characters that are no less compelling and interesting than
the one being chased.</P>
