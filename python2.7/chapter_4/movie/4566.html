                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE (ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD) 
(France, 1991) *** 3/4 . Directed by Alain Corneau. Screenplay 
by Pascal Guignard and Corneau, from Guignard's novel. Music 
arranger and performer,  Jordi Savall. Cinematography, Yves 
Angelo. Sets, Bernard Vezat. Costumes, Corrine Jorry. Editing, 
Marie-Joseph Yoyotte.  Cast: Jean-Pierre Marielle, Gerard 
Depardieu, Anne Brochet, Guillaume Depardieu, et al. An 
October Films release. In French with subtitles. 113 min. 
Rated PG. At the Savoy Theaters. </P>
<P>C'est magnifique ! The musical sounds are magnificent. 
Lighting and photography are magnificent. Editing and just 
about everything else is magnificent.  </P>
<P>Gerard Depardieu must be Lon Chaney's successor as The Man of 
a Thousand Faces. Grotesquely puffy, rouged, bewigged,  he 
opens the film as the musician-courtier, composer and viol 
virtuoso Marin Marais (1656-1728)] </P>
<P>In a fit of dark despair and humbling himself, the aging 
Marais tells his students that he is nothing compared to his 
teacher. His voice-over starts the flashbacks about Monsieur 
de Sainte-Colombe, a musical genius about whom little is 
known, not even his first name. </P>
<P>Sainte-Colombe did exist. He was a composer-performer who did 
marvels for the viol (the viola de gamba that became the 
cello), added a seventh string, found new fingerings, and had 
Marais as his most direct disciple.</P>
<P>The story begins with the death of Sainte-Colombe's young wife 
in the 1660s. The disconsolate musician  (Jean-Pierre 
Marielle) becomes a recluse in his large country house, builds 
a cabin --a wooden shack to practice in -- in his garden. He 
practices endlessly and also teaches his two daughters the 
rudiments of literacy and the techniques and secrets of great 
viol playing. </P>
<P>Solo or together they make stunning music. Years later, father 
and grown-up children give a rare salon   trio performance. 
The court's foppish first violist acknowledges 
Sainte-Colombe's superiority, soon after offers him to play 
for His Majesty Louis XIV, the Sun King in whose reign France 
was the cultural and artistic center of the world. </P>
<P>The vile-tempered Sainte-Colombe was a purist's purist and a 
Jansenist to boot -- these were breakaway Catholics who, among 
other matters, disapproved of the Jesuits' worldliness and 
ostentation. He kicks out the envoy. Playing the Palace is not 
for him.  </P>
<P>He resumes his rustic, eremitic life, with a vengeance. Having 
attained musical perfection he will not share it. </P>
<P>17-year old Marin Marais (Guillaume Depardieu, Gerard's only 
son) asks the Master to teach him. In vain, until the two 
girls come to the rescue.  But in this un-Hollywoodian tale 
the teacher keeps reminding the young man that he may have 
virtuosity but lacks soul. "You're not a musician," he says, a 
term that the uncompromising Sainte-Colombe seems to equate 
with an ineffable state of grace.</P>
<P>French movie narrations can often be superb.  Here, Gerard 
Depardieu relates the past with perfect voice and tone, in 
literary yet beautifully simple, un-pedantic terms. His 
technical discourses on musical techniques are fascinating.  </P>
<P>"Tous les Matins ... " is a glorious musical story. It is also 
a moving story of marital love. Sainte-Colombe's adoration of 
his wife is recompensed by a series of her apparitions. " It 
seemed to him that his rage was leaving him." He mellows 
perceptibly. We even discover that the Maestro did have one 
friend, painter Baugin, also a purist and a real-life person 
about whom little is known.</P>
<P>The film drips with Frenchness, from small details to the face 
of senior daughter Madeleine. Curiously, Anne Brochet played 
Roxanne in "Cyrano de Bergerac" where, without realizing it, 
she was in love with Cyrano, played by Gerard Depardieu. Here 
she loves Depardieu Junior. </P>
<P>There is an affair that turns sad when young Marais yields to 
the temptations of fame and fortune. Much later, he realizes 
that his ties to the Sainte-Colombe family were more powerful 
than he had thought. </P>
<P>The music, string and vocal , is a feast for the ears, with 
compositions by Sainte-Colombe, Marais, Lully, Couperin, and 
arrangements and performances by contemporary, Barcelona-born 
master of the bass viol, Jordi Savall.  The faking of 
viol-playing by the actors is entirely convincing. </P>
<P>The look of the film is a  feast for the eyes. The interiors 
remind you (but not pointedly) of paintings by Georges de La 
Tour, Dutch masters and others.  The secret is exquisite 
lighting, one of the most beautiful and precise I can 
remember. It reproduces perfectly the period's commonly used 
single or weak light sources, as opposed to artificial 
movie-lighting and the lightening of shadows or duskiness.  </P>
<P>The acting by Gerard Depardieu and Anne Brochet is impeccable.  
Jean-Pierre Marielle ho generally has comic or cynical roles, 
is cast again type and gives an unforgettably taciturn 
performance. Depardieu Jr. makes a good debut.   </P>
<P>French director Bertrand Tavernier had made" Round Midnight," 
in 1986. With the help of Dexter Gordon and Herbie Hancock, 
this was the best and most loving film ever about jazz 
musicians. Now Alain Corneau's ninth film in 18 years does the 
same for baroque music. Nominated for 11 Cesars (the French 
Oscars), it won 7, including Best Film, Director, Supporting 
Actress and Music. There were other awards too, such as the 
prestigious Louis Delluc Prize for Best French Film. </P>
