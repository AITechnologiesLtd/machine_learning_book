<PRE>EARTH (M).  
(Pinefilm/Beyond Films)
Director: Deepa Mehta
Stars: Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna, Maia Sethna, Kitu Gidwani, 
Kulbushan Kharbanda
Running time: 110 minutes
(Indian, with English subtitles).</PRE>
<P>The second film in Indian director Deepa Mehta's elements
trilogy, the powerful drama Earth follows her widely acclaimed Fire.
Based on Bapsi Sidhwa's semi-autobiographical novel Cracking India,
this powerful drama is set against the background of the partition of
India in 1947, when 250 years of British rule was cast aside amid
terrible bloodshed.  Long-standing friendships were also cast aside.
Brutal atrocities, inspired by fanatics on either side of the
religious divide, were committed.</P>
<P>The film largely unfolds from the perspective of eleven year
old Lenny (newcomer Maia Sethna), crippled with childhood polio and
raised in Lahore by her affluent, supposedly neutral parents.  Lenny
nonetheless watches as her family is gradually affected by the British
decision to pull out of India, and her friends are destroyed by the
spreading tide of senseless violence and religious hatred.  Lenny's
nanny is Shanta (Nandita Das), a beautiful young Hindu woman who moves
easily amongst her friends of different religious persuasions.</P>
<P>Earth initially unfolds at a leisurely pace, although the
tension surrounding the upcoming partition is palpable in the
conversations in the marketplace and in Lenny's home.  Earth is a
story of innocence lost, but it's also a story of sweeping political
and historical significance.  Its powerful themes of religious
intolerance and senseless violence are still quite relevant today,
especially given recent events in central Europe.</P>
<P>Earth is a powerful enough drama as it is, but the always
controversial Mehta also manages to work in a love affair between a
Hindu and a Muslim which further inflames the tension of this
tumultuous time, and leads to the film's devastating climax.  Given
the subject matter, Mehta directs with remarkable restraint, which
makes some of the atrocities even more horrible.</P>
<P>However, Mehta also beautifully captures the colour, the
passion, the music and rich culture of India that was partially
destroyed.  Giles Nuttgens' cinematography is rich and beautiful,
while A R Rahman's evocative and haunting music further enriches the
film.</P>
<P>Indian cinema normally comprises largely of vapid musicals and
banal comedies, and hard hitting and politically sensitive dramas such
as Earth are indeed rare.</P>
