<P>Starring Frances O'Conner, Jonny Lee Miller, Embeth Davidtz, Alessandro
Nivola, Harold Pinter, Lindsay Duncan. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Jane Austen has her own subgenre, with 16 movies adapted from her
novels since 1940. Aside from Clueless, however, there hasn't been much
creative variety in the films; they've been more or less similar in
setting and style. Like John Grisham films, Jane Austen, genius as her
work is, gets old after a while. We've been needing a director to do
something new with one of her novels, to go where no one has gone
before. That wish will not be granted by Patricia Rozema's Mansfield
Park, a reasonably entertaining, altogether unoriginal film version of
one of Austen's least populist works.</P>
<P>The much analyzed protagonist of the story is Fanny Price who was given
away by her well-intentioned but poverty-stricken mother to live in
Mansfield Park, her pretentious aunt's wealthy household. She is
shunned and treated like a servant by everyone except Edmund, one of
her cousins. Over the years, Edmund and Fanny develop a close, but
platonic relationship; he is her first defender, she is his first
confidant and vice versa.</P>
<P>Matters are complicated by the arrival of Henry, a good-looking
aristocrat who takes an immediate interest in Fanny. He courts her and
proposes marriage, but Fanny doesn't trust him and, though interested,
is very hesitant to commit to him, even pulling a 19th century version
of The Runaway Bride on the poor chap. Sir Thomas, the head of Fanny's
household, insists that she mary the desirable Henry, threatening to
kick her out of Mansfield Park should she refuse.</P>
<P>Frances O'Conner, in a lovely performance and a difficult role, plays
Fanny, a complex and demanding character which O'Conner pulls off
deftly. Jonny Lee Miller, last seen in the pathetic Plunkett and
Macleane is tender and effective as Edmund while the little seen Harry
Pinter is terrifically menacing as the head of the manor. Lindsay
Duncan has a fairly thankless part as the conniving, despicable Lady
Bertram but she succeeds with repulsive perfection. The only weak link
in the cast (and of course, a chain is only as strong as its weakest
link) is Alessandro Nivola whose Henry is dull and standard,
undermining the dilemma at the heart of the movie: from Nivola's
portrayal it isn't difficult to see why Fanny never went ga-ga over the
guy.</P>
<P>Rozema's film is funny, melodramatic, and enjoyable. The pace is
reasonably fast, the direction is able and the mood is nothing short of
crowd-pleasing. At the end, the good guys prosper and the bad guys get
their comeuppance. Everything is dandy. Everything is also tiresomely
ordinary. There is not a speck of originality in this film; the setting
and the script have been done and redone countless times, even if the
story itself has been left untouched (sans a 1983 tv mini-series).
Things that we see for the first time in the movie already feel
repetitive because we've seen them so many times in movies past. This
is your basic British melodrama à la Jane Eyre and Sense and
Sensibility, with virtually no variations on the formula.</P>
<P>Jane Austen deserves a revival. She is a wonderful novelist who needs a
filmmaker to breathe fresh life into her work. Mansfield Park is a
perfectly good adaptation, but it's trite. She is suffering from John
Grisham syndrome.</P>
