Getting It On with 'Boogie Nights'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>In the late 1970s, disco was the all the rage, sex was safe, and
pleasure was a growing industry.  Indeed, during this period, one of
America's darkest subcultures began to establish its prominence within
the entertainment industry.  This was the heyday of pornography, when
films of this nature made it onto the big screen and wasn't relegated
to the small confines of the living room television set.  But, behind
the scenes, it is a debilitating world that is marked by broken
dreams, drugs, and lost souls.</P>
<P>Boogie Nights is an amazingly revealing look at this frenzied world.
In the opening shot, the camera swoops through a nightclub frequented
by adult film auteur Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds).  It pans left and
right, introducing us to the various characters whose lives we'll be
following throughout the movie, including future porn star, Eddie
Adams (Mark Wahlberg).   Horner apparently has an eye
for...um...gifted actors, and approaches Eddie, who works as a lowly
dishwasher.  "I got a feeling that behind those jeans," says Horner, "
is something wonderful just waiting to get out."</P>
<P>Given Eddie's broken homelife, he eventually agrees to work for him.
When all of the characters are introduced, we meet up with the
cocaine-addicted, porno den mother Amber Waves (an inspiring Julianne
Moore), fellow porn stars recruited by Horner (John C. Reilly as Reed
Rotchild; Don Cheadle as Buck Swope; Heather Graham as Rollergirl), an
obese financier and a bevy of other behind-the-scenes crew.</P>
<P>The primary focus is on Eddie and his ascension (or fall) into porn
stardom.  Parlaying his biggest 'asset', he captures adult film's
highest awards, the matriarchal love of Amber and is the catalyst for
the ongoing success of Jack Horner and his family of helping hands.
But in a world as unpredictable and reckless as this, it is easy to
crash and burn.  Eddie soon falls victim to the dark side of stardom.
But Eddie's precarious path is just one of many engrossing stories
that explore the trials and tribulations of those who support the
industry, but then ultimately become victim to it.</P>
<P>The supporting cast of characters is richly developed, and each one
has a story to tell.  Some generate poignance, such as Amber's, who
desperately hopes to get custody of her child after divorcing her
husband.  Some generate a sickly feeling, such as the chubby male
stagehand who displays more than a passing interest in Eddie.  Some
generate uneasy tension, such as the stagehand who is slowly being
driven mad because his wife constantly has sex with any guy that she
sees.  There are many other interestingly inter-related tales.</P>
<P>Is this merely porn that tries to pass as art?  No.  This film is not
about sex or the turn-ons that accompany it.  The audience views the
sex with a detached eye.   To that effect, the real director films
this movie more like a documentary.  The look and feel is almost like
that from a super 8mm.  The mystique of sex is dispelled, and what we
see are the lives of ordinary people in a not-so-ordinary environment.</P>
<P>Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson finds nifty ways of presenting
different looks at a world that's seemingly styptic.  Through all the
characters and all the action, Anderson's screenplay centers on the
human qualities of the players.  They may live in a disreputable
world, but they have the same goals, needs and values as anyone trying
to make it in Hollywood.  In an industry that offers little future,
fates seem all too random, and each character will meet with their own
happy or sad ending.  Making it in life requires so much more than
making it in this business.  But as Eddie comments: "Everyone is
blessed with one great gift, and you have to make the most of it."</P>
<P>This movie offers several gifts.  Reynolds is well-cast as the sleazy
director, giving his role an almost deadpan feel as he, for example,
graphically explains how to perform the 'money shots.'  Wahlberg also
shows good depth as the dishwasher-turned-porn star who displays
maturity and confidence.  But, the real surprise is Moore, who is
touchingly effective.  I foresee an Oscar nomination for her, as well
as one for Anderson's raw but absorbing screenplay.</P>
<P>Boogie Nights is not a film for everyone.  With graphic sex scenes,
raw dialogue, and a soundtrack featuring pop songs heavy on isolation
and destruction, it is a sobering look at a world that simultaneously
bonds people together while tearing individuals apart.  Still, as
shocking as it is original, this is a finely developed piece of film.</P>
