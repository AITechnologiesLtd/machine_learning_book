<P>Like another film about writers and their times, IMPROMPTU, this is not a
great story, or a great adventure, or even a great film.  But it is a nice
little tribute to a woman writer, who was an immediate influence  to the
likes of Anais Nin, and therefore a vital voice in the development of the
art of writing.</P>
<P>While Colette's writing was more what we would consider 'erotic', than
anything else, it still made its mark.  Her most important story, that of
GIGI, was turned into a film that still has won one of the largest acclaims
in the Oscar Award history.</P>
<P>The story of Gabrielle Colette starts innocently enough with a rogue who
takes on a dreamy country girl for a wife, only to discover that she is a
fairly good writer, and has an inspiring style.  His taste for women and
other pleasurable delights pretty much runs him into the ground, while he
attempts to gain as much as he can from his wife's prolific output.  And
since the writing she is coming up with is too erotic, it is published under
his name for quite a while, until it is finally discovered who the real
writer is.  And during the time of her growth, she experiences many of the
things which are the mark of many of her Claudine books.  From sex, to
drugs, and to many friends in the artistic community, it all pretty much
shows the decadent life styles which pretty much control the lives of many
artists during the
time.</P>
<P>With a fine portrayal, by Mathilda May and Virginia Madsen as one of her
lovers later, this film plods along rather nicely.  It is only indulgent in
the sensuality of the moments where an overdose of sex or
drugs is concerned, which is where the writer Colette really excelled as a
dreamy eyed participant.  Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the man who gains her
hand in marriage and benefits until his charm can no longer win her.  But
the film still seems to depict an era that developed many writers, Gabrielle
Colette being one of them.</P>
