<PRE>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 
a film review by Chad Polenz</PRE>
<PRE>WHAT IT'S ABOUT: </PRE>
<P>Think "Star Wars" but set in ancient China and throw in a lot more drama and 
romance and you might have an idea of the scenario. It's a complex story of 
forbidden and unspoken love and the universal war of good versus evil. Chow 
Yun Fat plays a noble warrior trying to escape the life he has lead. Michelle 
Yeoh co-stars as the warrior's lifelong but unspoken lover who is also an 
accomplished fighter. Zhang Ziyi is the REAL star of the show as Jen, a 
teenage girl who has secretly studied a mystical form of martial arts under 
an infamous criminal known as Jade Fox - the nemesis the two warriors are 
hunting when they all come together. A sub-plot involves Jen's romantic 
affair with a wandering bandit and her inner conflict to give up a life of 
aristocracy and eliteness for the freedom of being a road warrior and with 
the man she truly loves. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>Just about everything that could go right for this picture does. The 
screenplay is full of detail, wonder characters, a rich background of the 
Chinese culture as well as a lot of ambiguity and mysticism towards the 
martials arts aspects. Although the story takes place in the "real" world the 
fighters here have the ability to defy gravity and other laws of nature yet 
they're still weighed down by basic human emotions and flaws. Director Ang 
Lee brings it all together wonderfully, pacing the film with energy and 
fluidity throughout so that the dramatic plotlines never drag on and the 
romantic aspects are very effective and quite moving. He also manages to keep 
things just a bit lighthearted with some comic relief that's well-timed and 
not at all distracting. </P>
<PRE>WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD ABOUT IT: </PRE>
<P>There are absolutely no flaws other than the fact the film is in Chinese and 
not English but that just makes it all that more authentic.</P>
<PRE>CRITIQUE: </PRE>
<P>It's difficult to compare "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" with anything 
mainstream because it's so vasty different from the kind of entertainment 
we've come to expect here in the west. This film combines elements from many 
different genres and how it manages to successfully make them work together 
is some kind of cinematic alchemy that only comes along a few times in a 
lifetime. </P>
<P>I saw this movie three times and upon each viewing it became even more 
enjoyable, more exciting and more romantic. How many Hollywood movies can you 
say that of? This is a story that is so full of authenticy and detail it 
creates its own sort of reality and consciousness. I can only compare it to 
the "Star Wars" movies  or "2001" because it works on that kind of level - 
where it's not a movie that you either enjoy or don't - it's an metaphysical 
experience (and no, it's not just something sci-fi geeks would like, ANYONE 
could enjoy this film). </P>
<P>I hope this is nominated for and wins many Academy Awards. One of the best 
movies ever made, seriously folks. </P>
