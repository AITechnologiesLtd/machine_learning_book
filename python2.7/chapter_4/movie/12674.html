<P>NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS (1995)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix.  
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix.  </P>
<PRE>Rating: * (out of five)  </PRE>
<P>Written by Lewis Green and Jordan Rush.  
Directed by Peter Hall.  
Starring Rebecca De Mornay, Antonio Banderas, Dennis Miller.  
Rated R (contains violence, nudity, and profanity)  86 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  Blond criminal psychologist Sarah chooses to copulate with
greasy Tony the mysterious Puerto Rican rather than bearded Cliff the
wisecracking neighbor upstairs.  In the meantime, someone sends Sarah
rotting flowers, puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column, and
kills her cat.  </P>
<P>Comments:  NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS, a colossal waste of time, moves slower
than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious
to the audience 20 minutes into the film.  One wouldn't think that two
genuine movie stars, Antonio Banderas (EVITA) and Rebecca De Mornay (HAND
THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE), and the acerbic comic genius Dennis Miller
("Saturday Night Live") would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as
this turkey.  Not only are they in it, however, but De Mornay executive
produced it.  What was she thinking?  </P>
<P>NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS centers upon Sarah, a psychologist examining the
ill-tempered Max, a murderer soon to stand trial.  She receives a sudden
visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early
childhood.  Two men woo her; Tony the "security consultant" wins her over
(so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music).  A lot
of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder, but
the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between
mpd and Sarah, and instead offers several male characters as red herrings.
86 minutes, the running time of this cinematic mess, thus, seem like 86
hours.  </P>
<P>A good chunk of NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS is spent upon Sarah and Tony.  Why
would the career-minded, professional Sarah feel attracted to the walking
steroid with a black hat called Tony?  That's one of the film's mysteries
which are never answered.  Regardless of motive, De Mornay and Banderas
strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism.  They
also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the
stupidest scenes of the film, Tony takes Sarah to a carnival that's *right
outside* his dingy apartment (that way, they can hurry back and have sex
quickly).  Also, apparently, the weather changes quickly in their locale:
they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex; the next day,
they're out playing in the snow before having sex.  </P>
<P>The filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with Tony
and Sarah's "character development."  Someone is out to get poor Sarah
(though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this
starts).  Rotting flowers, a writeup in the obituary, and a beaten neighbor
are just a few of the bad things which happen to her.  Suspense Cliche
Number One also occurs: whenever someone is stalked in thrillers, by any
means, if the stalked has a pet, that pet will die.  Oftentimes, to even
further the cliche, the murdered pet is a cat (suspense filmmakers, for
some reason, just don't like cats).  Sarah, in NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS,
receives a package and, lo and behold, discovers her mutilated cat within.
Suspense at its very derivative!  </P>
<P>As stated before, NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS is a poor excuse for a film whose
sole purpose seems to be exploiting Banderas and De Mornay's bodies as
often as possible.  Comedian Dennis Miller is completely wasted here (he's
not given lines that are suitable for his persona) and doesn't even appear
all that much.  Maybe, in a way, he's lucky for that.  Early on in the
movie, Sarah tells Tony, after meeting him in a supermarket, that she had
been advised to never talk to strangers.  Allow me to advise that you never
watch this stinker.  </P>
