<PRE>                             I'M NOT RAPPAPORT
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Turning a play into a movie is always a hit-or-miss process, and I
still don't know quite what to make of the latest film to take that
journey, I'M NOT RAPPAPORT.</P>
<P>     Based on the critically-acclaimed play of the same name, I'M NOT
RAPPAPORT as the story of two elderly men, Nat, a Jewish/socialist
radical and compulsive liar (Walter Matthau), and Midge, a black, nearly
blind apartment superintendent (Ossie Davis).  The pair has an uneasy
friendship based on the fact that they sit on the same bench in Central
Park, where Nat fills Midge's head with fabrications.  Nat's flair for
creating new personae for himself draws the pair into one minor
adventure after another, involving a young artist-in-training (Martha
Plimpton), a drug dealer (Craig T. Nelson), a mugger (Guillermo Diaz),
and threats from Nat's daughter (Amy Irving) regarding the ever-looming
old folks' home.</P>
<P>     The stuff of Broadway?  For sure.  The stuff of Hollywood?  I don't
think so.  The problems of compressing a heartwarming story about two
old guys who hang around Central Park into a feature film have obviously
taken their toll on I'M NOT RAPPAPORT, and what we've got is a 2-hour,
15-minute opus that features a very rocky start, some unneeded subplots,
and an overly repetitious plotline that is compelling despite its heavy
talkiness.</P>
<P>     Matthau and Davis are truly inspired as the leads (they worked
together before in GRUMPY OLD MEN), and it's great to see Plimpton
again, but whoever was in charge of putting Irving and Nelson in this
movie should be put in the old folks' home themselves.  Herb Gardner's
direction of his own script is as good as you can expect for a piece
like this (he changes camera angles enough to keep it interesting, and
that's about it), but nothing much else is overly inspired.</P>
<P>     The film is semi-entertaining and semi-interesting, but unless
you're really into this kind of tale, "semi" probably isn't going to cut
it.</P>
