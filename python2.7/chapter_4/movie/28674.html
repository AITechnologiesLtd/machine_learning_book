<PRE>"With a Friend Like Harry..." </PRE>
<P>Every so often, a filmmaker, usually European, takes on the task of making 
a "Hitchcockian thriller." Paul Verhoeven was successful with his lurid and 
sexy 1983 flick, "The Fourth Man." George Sluizer gave the master an even 
better turn in the Dutch/French produced "The Vanishing." Now, West German 
born Dominik Moll takes a shot at Hitch with his own psychological 
thriller, "With a Friend Like Harry...." </P>
<P>Alfred Hitchcock still holds the mantle of master of the chilling thriller, 
but it is nice to see a film that ably pays homage to the late, great 
filmmaker. Helmer Moll, working with a script co-written with Gilles 
Marchand, begins his film on a discordant note as we watch a young couple 
and their three restless kids drive off to the French countryside for 
vacation. The kids are cranky, it's hot and the drive is taking on 
interminable proportions for dad, Michel (Laurent Lucas). </P>
<P>When the family takes a break at a rest stop, Michel meets a man who claims 
to know him. Harry (Sergi Lopez) tells him that they knew each other in 
school, years before, but Michel can't recall the man at all. This doesn't 
stop Harry from insinuating himself and his buxom fiancée, Plum (Sophie 
Guillemin), on Michel and his wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and their 
vacation plans. The couple has an old farmhouse, which they are struggling 
to restore, in the countryside and the newcomers promptly plunk themselves 
down to stay, changing their own plans to go see the Materhorn. </P>
<P>Everything starts off seemingly innocent, but the odd-acting Harry 
definitely has his share of enigmatic quirks. Late one night, while Michel 
is taking care of the baby, he announces that he needs to eat a raw egg 
after each orgasm to improve his virility. On a shopping expedition with 
Claire, Harry decides to buy the family an expensive SUV, against Michel's 
protest. The old school chum appears just to be helping his friend to take 
care of "life's problems," but how he takes care of them is the crux of 
"With a Friend Like Harry...." </P>
<P>In the best tradition of Hitch, Dominik Moll uses many of the old master's 
tricks to depict violence and convey real tension to his audience. Mayhem 
takes place all through the film, but it is done almost exclusively off 
screen, cleverly making the viewer build the horror of the scene in his/her 
mind. Additionally, the score, by David Sinclair Whittaker, has the same 
tense quality that the great Bernard Herrmann gave to many of Hitchcock's 
films ? who can ever forget the screeching violins in "Psycho?" </P>
<P>The cast, with one exception, maintains a low-key presence throughout the 
film. Sergi Lopez, as the enigmatic and dangerous Harry, gives a psycho 
edge to his performance that conveys volumes with a wicked gleam of the eye 
or an overconfident smirk on his lips. Right from the start, his outward 
affability carries an edge to it as Harry goes about his business of 
insinuating himself into Michel's life. Harry carries a lot of baggage from 
his past, including a long-standing but hidden obsession for Michel. No 
explanation is offered for Harry's bizarre, deadly behavior, keeping us in 
the dark about his motives. This is a problem as the enigma about Harry is 
carried too long and answers to our questions are left dangling in the end. </P>
<P>The production, oftentimes shot with a dark, sinister quality by Matthieu 
Poirot-Delpech, maintains the edgy nature that Moll needs to convey to keep 
the chills in his thriller. Actor Lopez isn't going to replace Anthony 
Perkins's Norman Bates as the quintessential movie monster, but with a 
friend like Harry.... </P>
<PRE>I give it a B. </PRE>
