<PRE>FOR RICHER OR POORER</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Universal / 1:56 / 1997 / PG-13 (language, sex jokes)
Cast: Tim Allen; Kirstie Alley; Jay O. Sanders; Michael Lerner; Wayne 
Knight; Larry Miller; Miguel A. Nunez; Megan Cavanagh 
Director: Bryan Spicer 
Screenplay: Jana Howington; Steve LuKanic </P>
<P>Although "Home Improvement"'s Tim Allen and "Veronica's Closet"'s Kirstie 
Alley know success on the small screen, their collaborative efforts are 
marred in translation to the silver one with "For Richer or Poorer." Both 
stars are in top form here, and they even manage to pull off a few very 
funny bits before the film exchanges silly spoofing of the Amish culture 
in for sloppy sentimentality involving love and marriage. Let's put it 
this way -- there's a reason it's called "For Richer or Poorer" and not 
"Madcap Mennonite Misadventures." </P>
<P>Allen and Alley play Brad and Caroline Sexton, an obnoxious, wealthy New 
York couple on the verge of a not-too-amicable divorce around the time of 
their 10th wedding anniversary. But before they can officially untie the 
knot, the IRS comes looking for them -- it seems their slimy accountant 
(Wayne Knight, Newman from "Seinfeld") has stolen $5 million from their 
accounts and set it up to look like tax fraud. They steal a cab and end 
up crashing in Intercourse, Pennsylvania (ha, ha) -- Amish country -- 
where they masquerade as a prominent farm family's cousins from the 
Midwest (but where'd they get their duds?). What follows is a semi-parody 
of "Witness," as the Sextons lay low with the Amish and grow accustomed 
to the hard-working simplicity of their everyday lives. </P>
<P>In a fish-out-of-water comedy, taking the fish out of water around the 
40-minute mark isn't a very good idea -- especially when we're not given 
very many reasons to like either of our protagonists. But Allen and Alley 
(why is he billed above the title while she's not?) do get away with some 
great one-liners and nifty sight gags, the best of which are probably 
worth sticking around for. There's a hilarious dinner sequence where Brad 
and Caroline invent reasons for the liberal rules of their cluster to 
appease their inquiring "relatives" (the justification for Brad's 
clean-shaven face -- "minute lice") as well as a funny running gag 
involving a 4:45 a.m. wake-up call and what I believe is the very first 
Amish fashion show ever captured on film. </P>
<P>Basically, "For Richer or Poorer" is okay whenever it lets its incognito 
couple go for each other's throats, which better explains that sinking 
feeling that occurs during a needless detour towards schmaltz in its 
final third. We're asked to swallow that the warm, intimate values of the 
Amish lifestyle melt Brad and Caroline's hearts and cause them to 
re-evaluate their relationship, a big, misguided no-no considering what 
shallow jerks they're depicted as until then. Other inconsistencies and 
flaws pop up, the cap-off of which is a surprisingly unfunny blooper reel 
(a la "The Nutty Professor" and the "Grumpy Old Men" movies) that runs 
during the closing credits. Come on -- such a funny leading man and lady 
and you're telling me the best outtake you've got is Alley slipping and 
sliding in pigpen mud? </P>
<P>Still, for such a stinky story, Allen and Alley are constantly engaging; 
he's put to good use after the respectively poor and even-worse "The 
Santa Clause" and "Jungle 2 Jungle," while she makes quite an 
eye-catching comeback after a several-year movie drought (her last big 
role, I believe, was that of a chain-smoking scientist in 1995's 
outlandish "Village of the Damned" remake). The real Amish have some sort 
of rule about not being captured on film, and aside from Allen and Alley, 
"For Richer or Poorer" and fellow faith-offender "Kingpin" (the spoof of 
several summers ago which cast Randy Quaid as an Amish bowling protégé) 
just don't do much to prove that the creed needs a makeover. </P>
