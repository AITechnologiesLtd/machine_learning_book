<P>   Everyone except poultry farmers and airline companies
should rejoice at the creation of this wonderful Claymation
movie, one featuring chickens who act more human than we
do and a pair of farmers who behave more like vultures and
jackals than sensitive homo sapiens.  Chicken farmers of the
world have nothing to celebrate, which becomes obvious in
the very first suspense-filled moments of the action since,
after all, we're obliged to sympathize with victims of
oppression and not their jailers.  As for airline companies,
credit Karey Kirkpatrick's hatchet-sharp writing that makes
"Chicken Run" perhaps even more appealing to adults than to
the more-visual-than-literary young 'uns who have towed
them into the theaters.  In one of the film's sharpest lines, a
high-fashion mouse positions himself at the front of a
makeshift aircraft and instructs the fowl who are about to take
off to freedom, "In the event of an emergency, put your head
between your legs...and kiss your butt goodbye."  This may
not be an original gag--it was in fact created by a realistic
cynic during the atomic age to spoof the belief that we could
protect ourselves by hiding under our desks.  But never
before was the quip so neatly placed within the context of a
story.</P>
<P>   In one dramatic scene, Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth), the,
uh, henpecked husband of farm proprietor Mrs. Tweedy
(Miranda Richardson), cries out, "The chickens are revolting!"
to which the Mrs. retorts, "For once we agree."  This is but
one example of the wordplay that makes the story a delight
for adults, a story filled with puns, with metaphoric
expressions made literal ("Hey, this is chicken-feed," says a
mouse upon receiving insufficient payment for a job he is
about to perform), and with jazzy lines.  A World War II
chicken-mascot-veteran, like others of his flock, becomes
human in the way he lives for the memories of his medal-
filled battle experiences and lectures the younger members of
the farm on how easy they have things today despite their
position in a prison camp.</P>
<P>   Though the most obvious take-off is of "Stalag 17," with
one of the huts featuring the number 17 and with the jailbirds
surprisingly content in their captivity, the 1950's British setting
of the project may remind you of George Orwell's "Animal
Farm." (That's the book all high-school kids choose to read
for their required reports because it's regularly the thinnest
text on the list.)  While "Chicken Run" does not really have an
Orwellian political agenda--its directors, Peter Lord and Nick
Park insisting that they are not vegetarians--the film's chicks
are so human that scholars with time on their hands are
bound to make postmodern and Marxist, even feminist
interpretations of the agenda.</P>
<P>    The farm in question exists for the production of eggs. 
When the quota is not met, Mrs. Tweedy enjoys the lazy bird
for dinner.  (A critique of capitalism?)  Early on, one hapless
hen is indeed sent to the execution chamber, its carcass
showing up on the Tweedy table hours later.  This act
motivates the animals to escape a situation that looks
insurmountable.  The fences are high and vicious dogs patrol
regularly.  When Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson)
glides into the compound explaining that he is himself an
escapee from the circus, he is enjoined by the honcho hen,
Ginger (Julia Sawalha), to teach the company how to fly. 
The motivation becomes stronger when Mrs. Tweedy
purchases a chicken-pie making machine, intending to
execute her entire barnyard at once to make quick profits.
(Another critique of capitalism?)  </P>
<P>   "Chicken Farm" stops for air quite a few times during its
brief 85 minutes, allowing the audience to soak in the hip
patter, taking a chance that the kids may fidget during these
absolutely non-MTV moments.  But Lord and Park, aiming to
keep the adults as enthralled as the children, does right in
allowing Karey Kirkpatrick's words to punch in, while in the
best action scene, the directors put the chicks through their
paces inside the huge, Chaplin-esque pot-pie machine.  As
two potential victims duck the sharp blades and parry with the
grinding wheels as though in a Claymation version of
"Modern Times," the audience gets a good look at the second
industrial revolution writ small--what the world was like before
high-tech dissolved much of the need for manual labor and
heavy machinery in the highly developed parts of the world.</P>
<P>   The assorted accents are an added plus, particularly the
combination of Cockney, Scottish, and American English all
competing for attention as the rulers of the roost and their
frightened followers make their dramatic bid for deliverance.
Prison is no fun, but hey, don't look at me: I get eggs only
from free-range chickens.</P>
