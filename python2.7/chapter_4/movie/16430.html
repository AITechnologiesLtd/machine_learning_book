<PRE>Titanic this year's cinema titan.</PRE>
<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Two words, are you listening, Best Picture.</P>
<P>I know, I've put it off. I'm a procrastinator. I always wait until the last
minute to name the Best Picture hopeful that I have (although its more like
sure-fire with "Titanic"), but, when I do, I'm not often wrong (I've nailed
‘em three years straight)</P>
<P>To describe the movie "Titanic" is to try to describe light to a blind man.
It's one of those movies that isn't seen, it's absorbed, engraved into the
viewer's brain. Tears stream down your cheeks as you realize the disaster.
Smiles like ripples in a lake start whenever the 22-year old acting duet
(Lenoardo Dicaprio of the Gen-X version of "Romeo & Juliet", Kate Winslet of
"Hamlet") light up the screen with there romance.</P>
<P>To say what it is isn't enough. To say what it's not: it's not badly done,
it's not stupid, it's not extraordinary in the supporting acting but the
ship is the story, the special effects the tale, and they are done so well
that everything bends to their wills.</P>
<P>Dicaprio doesn't disappoint me in this one, giving a subtly good
performance, portraying the lower class well. He doesn't overact, which was
what I was expecting from him, and doesn't underact, either. Plus, since the
dialogue was cleaned up so well, he doesn't have to worry about that
hampering him. Winslet didn't surprise me, if only because of the fact that
she is one of those actresses who are naturally good. She turned up the
romantic charm in "Sense & Sensibility", as well as persevered past the
verse in "Hamlet" (something which DiCaprio ended up tripping over in "R &
J"). The only actor that doesn't do well at all is Billy Zane, who really
needs to control his face (he looks like a little child through half the
movie).</P>
<P>As far as the directing it reaches a new level of perfection, Cameron's
camera points on the ship of Titanic and we all light up our eyes at the
magic, and the impact of it hits us all.
The movie's point is that of discrediting the aristocracy, of putting down
the upper class and their pretensions, as they are all cast as the villains
in this flick. Its other point, as sad and true as it may be, is to show the
complete horror of the Titanic disaster (as best displayed with scores of
bodies floating in the water after the ship has sunk). But the movie is well
beyond a disaster film. It is a miracle. A diamond in the rough. An
entertaining work of art.
Get ready for three and a half hours of your life you will never forget.</P>
