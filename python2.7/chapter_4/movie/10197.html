<P>Road movie, farce, satire, picaresque picture, black comedy, bedroom farce....</P>
<P>Take your pick as they all apply to "Guantanamera," the last film by the
"Maestro" of Cuban Cinema, Tomas Gutierrez Alea (1928-1996), called Titon
(Tee-TON) by all his friends. He was already ill with lung cancer when he
made it.  As for his penultimate feature "Strawberry and Chocolate" (1993)
he sought the collaboration of filmmaker Juan Carlos Tabio, 15 years his
junior, who also gets directorial credit in both features.</P>
<P>"Guantanamera" means the woman from Guantanamo (the town, not the U.S.
base). It is probably the best-known Cuban song. In Cuba, various singers
put their own lyrics on the melody. Here it is heard several times, with
different comments, descriptions or suggestions.</P>
<P>The film's structure is that of the familiar road  movie in which  people
try to get from point A to point B as events, happenings or adventures
accumulate. In her teens, Yoyita left Guantanamo, became a famous singer,
returned after 50 years to see her niece Georgina (aka Gina), also met
Candido, the great love of her youth who had never stopped thinking of her.
The charming senior citizens have a wonderfully romantic reunion.  They
reminiscences of the same event but with different images, are just like
those of former lovers Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold singing "I
Remember It Well" in the musical "Gigi." Then big-time artist Yoyita dies
suddenly in the arms of provincial brass-player Candido.</P>
<P>The main female role belongs to Gina. She is played by the enchanting
stage-and-screen actress Mirtha Ibarra, whose film debut was in "The Last
Supper" by Alea. Mirtha and Titon married (he for the second time), had
three daughters and were still together 22 years later, when Titon died.
Gina, formerly an economics professor, is now married to Adolfo, an
official fallen from grace (for undisclosed reasons). Sidelined by the
administration as the head of a minor committee on burials, he is now
trying to regain recognition. Adolfo conceives a pea-brained scheme for
savin fuel in gasoline-strapped Cuba:  those who die far from their desired
burial places will be transported by a system of relays between cemeteries.</P>
<P>Fate would have it that the first candidate for this long-distance
experiment is Auntie Yoyita, who must be taken to Havana, almost at the
other end of the island. The trip,  fraught with obstacles and
coincidences, takes through the landscape and, more importantly, the
humanscape. We see a Cuba whose inhabitants do not lose their sense of
humor but have to invent ways to survive financially. Truck-driver Mariano
who has an engineering degree but must make a living, and his more mature
buddy Ramon, who though sensible still believes in witchcraft, take illegal
passengers. Sellers along the roads  offer goods, mostly edibles, for
dollars, not Cuban money. Adolfo has none, but his chauffeur, himself a
black-marketeer (or entrepreneur) does, buys bananas and shares them with
his boss.</P>
<P>A sly reminder by a tour guide mentions that a certain town, over several
centuries was the center of smuggling and had dealings with forbidden
countries. It doesn't take a doctorate in history to see the reference to
contemporary Cuba.</P>
<P>The paths of Mariano's truck and Adolfo's troublesome car (no doubt
Soviet-built) with Adolfo, Gina and Candido as passengers, keep crossing.
Both background and foreground keep pointing to the shortages (of
everything) in Cuba, where one-table "secret" restaurants spring up; where
a fan-belt is a small treasure; where coupons are needed for many things,
even in a cemetery's cantina; where the car's riders munch bananas from the
subterranean economy as the radio spouts positive agricultural statistics</P>
<P>Among many disturbances, there's another romance brewing. I will not let
the cat out of the bag except to say that Mariano is at the love story's
epicenter, and that he complicates things. Mariano is a Don Juan with the
equivalent of a girl in every port. Here it's a lover in every town,
gas-station, truck-stop or train-crossing. (A sex-hungry young woman brings
to mind the Czech satire "Closely Watched Trains.") The relationships are
funny even when the premises are not.</P>
<P>Gags are brought in naturally.  Windshield wipers activate when the car is
bumped;  a woman tells of man who died unexpectedly, then reveals that he
was 107 years old.  But "Guantanamera" is not simply an entertainment. It
is a movie about life, love and death during the hard times of an
impoverished nation.</P>
<P>Alea, started his career as a dedicated celebrant of the Cuban Revolution.
Later, when he made the first big pictures that brought him international
fame ("Death of a Bureaucrat"1966; "Memories of Underdevelopment"
1968),many began to see him as a critic of the Fidel Castro regime, even
though Alea and Castro had been schoolmates and were friends. But it was a
misinterpretation of Alea's complexity, and a matter of semantics.</P>
<P>As Alea repeatedely phrased it (with varations), "to be critical is to make
a militant film for the Revolution". Or, "for the Revolution to grow, for
our country to develop positively, criticism is necessary."</P>
<P>"Guantanamera" has no villains. It looks upon all its characters with
sympathy, understanding or at a minimum, tolerance. The main butt of its
criticism is Adolfo, that misguided, counterproductive, symbolic,
ambitious, egotistic and silly bureaucrat. In its own, rather kinky way,
"Guantanamera" is like Part Two of "Death of a Bureaucrat" of some thirty
years earlier. Like that film, like much of the rest of Alea's output
(about a dozen out of a total of ca. 22 pictures), there's always a tricky
patriotic balancing act of theory against practice, of Marxist dialectics
that uphold principles while they castigate misapplications. The process,
neither obvious nor simple-minded, sometimes caused confusion in the public
as well as the critics.</P>
<P>It seems to me that Alea is sending his viewers, especially the Cubans, a
message about the necessity to clean house. This is colorfully, deviously,
subtly recounted  as the legend of Olofin, the God who created life  but
forgot to create death. There follow millenia of ever-aging populations
which engulf the young -- until the other deity, Iku, brings about rain and
floods, so that all the aged drown and only physically fit younger people
survive. Thus did Iku terminate progress-impeding immortality. All this is
far more poetic than the American "Time for a change," or "We need new
blood."</P>
<P>Among the subtleties of this seemingly simple movie, is the fact that we
see very  few slogans: only one banner says "Socialism or Death." And the
fact that this seriocomic, appealing "realistic fantasy" neither mentions
nor hints at the Big Bad Wolf. One can almost hear Alea saying:  "Yes, the
Yankees are partly to blame for our troubles, but we should not use this as
an excuse or an alibi for our own shortcomings."</P>
<P>"Guantanamera" was nominated for the Golden Lion at the 1996 Venice Film
Festival and honored at several others.</P>
