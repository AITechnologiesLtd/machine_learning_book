<P>     Perhaps Robert Frost put it best when he said, "A jury consists of 
twelve persons chosen to decide who has the better lawyer."  Once, 
practicing law was considered a worthy, honorable career.  No longer.  
In a bloated legal system where technicalities count more than justice, 
and where wealth and fame can buy freedom, lawyers have become the 
parasites who feed off the desiccated remains of human suffering.  To be 
sure, there are some who still enter the profession with the best of 
motives, but they are in the minority.  Law is not about idealism; it's 
about money and back-room deals.  </P>
<P>      As common as lawyer-bashing has become during the 1980s and 1990s, 
the most vicious cinematic attack on the profession occurred in 1979, 
when director Norman Jewison, writer Barry Levinson, and actor Al Pacino 
combined their talents to rake law and order across the coals in ...AND 
JUSTICE FOR ALL.  Strictly speaking, the film in neither a satire nor a 
black comedy, but there are heavy shadings of each woven into the 
narrative.  ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL's bleak, absurd look at lawyers would 
be hilarious if it wasn't so true-to-life.</P>
<P>     In the past twenty-five years, there have been countless courtroom 
dramas, most of which have tended towards the sensationalistic side of 
mediocre.  ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is not one of those movies.  Although 
some of the action takes place in court, including one of the best-known 
trial sequences in the history of film (Pacino screaming, "You're out of 
order!  This whole trial is out of order!"), the movie is more about 
morality and ethics than courtroom shenanigans.  ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL 
has no part in the stock trade of shock witnesses and surprising 
revelations.  This is about how too many guilty people walk while the 
innocent take their places in overcrowded jails.  </P>
<P>     The more you consider ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL's message, and the 
means by which it is delivered, the more aware you become of how 
uncompromising Jewison's attack is on the legal system.  Insane and 
corrupt judges dole out life-and-death sentences with as much thought as 
a butcher would give to carving a side of beef.  Attorneys view the 
courtroom as an arena where they can grapple with an opponent without 
concern for the cost in human pain and tears.  And those who genuinely 
care about their clients are foiled at every turn by the deeply-rooted 
hypocrisy and cynicism that defines American law.</P>
<P>     Pacino plays Arthur Kirkland, a defense attorney who has been in 
practice for twelve years.  He has a good reputation, so his caseload is 
heavy.  However, Kirkland isn't in the game for money, prestige, or 
power.  He's one of those rare lawyers who believes in the judicial 
system and wants to help people.  He'll spend a night in jail for 
contempt of court rather than let a judge ignore a crucial piece of 
evidence.  Yet all of Kirkland's principles are about to be called into 
question when he is asked to defend a hard-line justice, Judge Fleming 
(John Forsythe), who is accused of rape.  Kirkland's dislike of Fleming 
runs deep, but circumstances force the lawyer to take this case, which 
he should stay far away from.  </P>
<P>     Pacino earned an Academy Award nomination for his work in ...AND 
JUSTICE FOR ALL.  However, of all his Oscar nominations, this is 
probably the least-deserved.  Pacino's intensity is undeniable, but the 
actor, who always works on the seam between restraint and overacting, 
crosses the line a few times too often.  In a scene where Kirkland 
learns that a client has hanged himself, Pacino's histrionics strike a 
false chord.  Certainly, there are times when Pacino is excellent, but 
he is not consistently so.</P>
<P>     Of the supporting performers, John Forsythe and Jack Warden leave 
the strongest impressions.  Forsythe, known best at the time for being 
the faceless Charlie of CHARLIE'S ANGELS, is the perfect picture of 
cold, controlled arrogance.  There's nothing vaguely human about him 
except his capacity for vice.  Whether guilty or innocent of rape, he's 
still a villain.  Warden plays a suicidal, borderline-lunatic judge 
whose continued presence on the bench makes a mockery of every trial he 
presides over.  Jeffrey Tambor is a lawyer who undergoes a crisis of 
conscience when a man whose acquittal he facilitated commits a double 
murder.  Christine Lahti is Kirkland's girlfriend, Lee Strasberg (THE 
GODFATHER PART II) is his grandfather, and Craig T. Nelson is a 
prosecuting attorney.</P>
<P>     ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL ends with the kind of bravura outburst by 
Pacino that one might easily assume is designed to entice cheers and 
applause from the audience.  But there's a subtle difference between 
this finale and the cornball conclusion of a later Pacino picture, SCENT 
OF A WOMAN, which also featured a dynamic speech.  Here, the actor's 
words radiate real outrage, and what he says caps the film's central 
ethical dilemma about a lawyer defending a man he knows to be guilty.  
This is a powerful, cathartic moment that's neither exhilarating nor 
uplifting.  Like most of what precedes it, the climax of ...AND JUSTICE 
FOR ALL underscores Jewison's message about how hollow and diseased the 
process of law has become.  We need look no further than last year's #1 
television event, the O.J. Simpson trial, to understand everything that 
this film is trying to say.</P>
