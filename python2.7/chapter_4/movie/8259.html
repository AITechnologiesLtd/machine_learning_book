<PRE>                              CON AIR 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Steve
Buscemi, Mykelti Williamson, Rachel Ticotin, Colm Meaney, Danny Trejo,
Nick Chinlund, David Chappelle, M.C. Gainey Director: Simon West
Screenplay: Scott Rosenberg</P>
<P>There must be a good reason to justify mass destruction and excessively
loud noise on screen. People will not warm to pure special effects and
explosions which dazzle the eye like fireworks in the sky. So what
better than to introduce a weather beaten, unfairly punished, tortured
hero (Cage), who has served seven years in a penitentiary, for defending
his honour and protecting his wife.</P>
<P>Years pass as quickly as the sands of an egg timer, and soon our hero
has finished his sentence, and is aboard a plane carrying the convicted
to their release destinations or to their new prison home. He must
survive the journey of his life aboard 'Con Air' -
'Convicts-Onboard-No-smoking-And-Intellectual/Irreverent-Ratbags'.</P>
<P>It is the eve of his daughter's seventh birthday, and our hero will do
anything, and I mean literally anything, to be able to give his child a
birthday present in person. That is, of course, unless he gets waylaid
by other honourable deeds, such as finding an insulin syringe for his
best friend who is about to lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis, or
preventing the rape of a female law enforcer.</P>
<P>Such honour is certainly lacking amongst our assorted passengers,
ranging from the petty pick pocket, to the numeric rapist; from the
politically-incorrect racist, to the intellectually well-achieved mass
murderer, and of course a Hannibal Lector persona for added variety.
Just as we all have different styles of reviewing movies, this rat-bag
assortments of waylaid souls, intermingle to create a symphony of
destruction in the hi-jack of the decade.</P>
<P>Some petty quirks and misdemeanours to point out. Diabetics who have not
eaten the entire plane flight, will more likely develop hypoglycaemia
(low blood sugars, before coma) than acidosis (high blood sugars, before
coma). To which our hero, should be looking for jelly beans and not a
syringe full of insulin. According to this movie, singing has life
changing effects on the psychotic and mentally ill. Who knows? I guess
anything is possible if you survive a plane crash in the middle of
Vegas.</P>
<P>Comment: 'The Flight of the Repeated Offender.'</P>
