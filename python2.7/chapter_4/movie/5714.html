<P>     It strikes me that there are certain similarities between JACK and 
PHENOMENON.  Both use relative innocents as their central characters.  
Both attempt to attract a mature audience.  And, most importantly, both 
offer drama-based alternatives to the relentless action films that have 
come to characterize the summer of 1996.  However, while PHENOMENON 
failed because of poor scripting, JACK is an unqualified success.  If 
there's going to be a sleeper hit this summer, JACK is a reasonable 
candidate.  This feel-good motion picture is intelligently written and 
expertly directed -- qualities which many similar movies cannot boast.  
Cross BIG with FORREST GUMP, and you get an idea of where JACK's appeal 
lies. </P>
<P>     The premise for JACK, although seemingly simple, is riddled with 
potential problems -- nearly all of which the script not only addresses, 
but answers without a whiff of condescension.  Jack is born when his 
mother is only ten weeks pregnant.  The doctors are immediately aware 
that something strange is going on.  Eventually, they arrive at an 
explanation.  The child has an internal clock that's ticking four times 
faster than usual.  So, by the time Jack turns ten, he appears like a 
40-year old man (Robin Williams). </P>
<P>      Until the fall of his eleventh year, Jack has been taught by a 
tutor (Bill Cosby).  But, after careful consideration, his mother (Diane 
Lane) and father (Brian Kerwin) agree that he should give public school 
a try, despite children's' propensity for name-calling and finger-
pointing.  So, one morning, Jack ventures into Nathaniel Hawthorne 
Elementary School to meet his fifth grade teacher, Miss Marquez 
(Jennifer Lopez), and his classmates. </P>
<P>     The script for JACK, credited to James DeMonaco and Gary Nadeau, is 
a well-balanced mix of drama and comedy.  It's rarely maudlin, and 
manages to be affecting without heavy-handed manipulation.  The film has 
an excellent grasp of what it's like to be in fifth grade.  Jack endures 
all the painful isolation of a "different" child, but, gradually, as he 
makes friends (by dominating schoolground basketball games and offering 
to buy PENTHOUSE magazines), he begins to fit in.  It's perhaps an 
idealized vision of elementary school, but there are enough aspects of 
reality not to jolt our suspension of disbelief. </P>
<P>     One of the most difficult issues JACK has to deal with is the title 
character's rapid aging.  If he looks like he's forty at ten, that means 
he'll be lucky to live past twenty.  When his teacher asks him what he 
wants to be when he grows up, Jack's answer is succinct and poignant:  
"Alive."  Mr. Woodruff, Jack's tutor, describes him this way:  "You're a 
shooting star amongst ordinary stars... A shooting star passes quickly, 
but, while it's here, it's the most beautiful thing you'll ever want to 
see."  The movie never shies away from confronting Jack's mortality. </P>
<P>     Robin Williams is entirely believable as a ten-year old.  He has 
all the mannerisms and vocal inflections perfected -- whining when he 
doesn't get his way, pulling at his shirts, adjusting his pants, and so 
forth.  It's almost as if he regressed back into childhood for the 
duration of filming.  (Then again, has Williams ever really grown up?)  
The only recent movie where an adult so perfectly emulated a child was 
BIG, and, indeed, JACK has much in common with the Tom Hanks feature, 
both in terms of subject matter and broad audience appeal.  Williams 
brings a lot of humor to his portrayal, but, with Francis Ford Coppola 
in control, the comic's eccentricities are kept carefully under reign, 
and this results in a near-perfect performance. </P>
<P>     The supporting cast is surprisingly solid.  Diane Lane, Brian 
Kerwin, and Fran Drescher are not known as strong actors, but each is 
equal to their secondary roles here.  Bill Cosby, playing a fifty-
something man with a lot of child inside, steals several scenes.  
Jennifer Lopez has a touching moment where she is forced to turn down 
Jack's offer to accompany him to a school dance.  And Adam Zolotin is 
good as Louis, Jack's best friend. </P>
<P>     JACK has something to offer just about everyone.  It's good-
natured, funny, heartwarming, and capable of being viewed on more than 
one level.  Children will relate to JACK differently than their parents, 
although, with its "soft" PG-13, the film isn't for the very young.  
With the release of COURAGE UNDER FIRE a few weeks ago, and now JACK, 
this summer's theatrical options are brightening.  For Robin Williams, 
don't be surprised if his name is mentioned early next year when Academy 
Award Nominations are given out.  JACK deserves that sort of 
recognition. </P>
