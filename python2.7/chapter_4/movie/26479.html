<PRE>URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: John Ottman
Written by: Silvio Horta, Paul Harris Boardman, Scott Derrickson</P>
<P>The events of the first "Urban Legends" film have become urban legends 
themselves. The only person still hanging around to talk about them is the 
security guard, Reese (Loretta Devine). She's now at a different school, but 
the same thing seems to be happening again. This time, film student Amy 
Mayfield (Jennifer Morrison) is making a movie about the killer from the 
first movie. Professor Solomon (Hart Bochner) encourages her to proceed, as 
does her friend and fellow student film director, Travis Stark (Matthew 
Davis). So, gathering a crew of film students, she sets about making her 
movie. There's just one problem, a real serial killer has started wiping out 
her cast. Amy's theory is that it's another film student who is seeking to 
kill all competition for the much coveted Alfred Hitchcock award. The award 
includes a large sum of cash, and a chance to direct a real motion picture 
in Hollywood. Now Amy and her friends have to find out who the killer is 
before she runs out of crew members. Could it be Graham (Joey Lawrence), the 
student making another slasher movie? Or how about Toby (Anson Mount), the 
slightly off kilter sound guy. Of course, the real mystery is to find out if 
anyone really cares.</P>
<P>Hah! Sorry, that just slipped out. Truth be told, I couldn't help but laugh 
at this stupid movie. I think I would have lost my mind if I hadn't. "Urban 
Legends: Final Cut" is such a ridiculously stupid movie you'll probably 
spend half your time staring blankly at the screen, shocked that this thing 
ever got the green light. I personally stumbled out of the theater searching 
vainly for something strong to drink. "ULFC" will appeal to one group, those 
who love mindless, cookie-cutter teen slasher movies. All the rest of us 
will react with varying degrees of disgust. At first I was actually willing 
to brush the film off with a two star rating for being yet another stupid, 
harmless slasher movie. Then it did something flat out insulting. The 
writers had the gall to talk about Hitchcock in this film. They dared to 
compare this piece of garbage to the master in any way? I think that's 
punishable by death in some states (or if it isn't, it certainly should be). 
I can picture the master right now, rolling in his grave at the thought of 
his name being thrown about in some cheesy teen movie. It's enough to make 
on violently ill.</P>
<P>The cast in "ULFC" is full of your traditional teen movie stars. You know 
the type, people who are nice to look at but don't have anything even 
remotely resembling talent. First up is Jennifer Morrison ("Stir of 
Echoes"). Comely? Yes. Talented? Far from it. She seems to have been 
educated at the Jennifer Lopez school for acting, where students are taught 
that talking softly makes you appear to have acting skills. Next we've got 
Matthew Davis, making his first (and hopefully last) appearance in a feature 
film. I think Matthew was educated at the Freddie Prinze school for acting. 
There they teach students to say little, but occasionally smile slightly at 
the camera so all the girls in the audience can swoon. He should get a 
refund, because I didn't hear any girls swooning. The talented Anthony 
Anderson ("Me, Myself, and Irene") makes an appearance as the school's film 
geek, but he has hardly any screen time. He does get one of the film's few 
truly funny scenes however. The remaining actors fall into the "don't care 
who they are or what they've done" category, with the exception of Jessica 
Cauffiel (last seen destroying her boyfriend's car in "Road Trip"). Jessica 
does a great job playing a girl who can't act. Take that in whatever context 
you'd like.</P>
<P>Much as I'd like to blame John Ottman for this movie I can't. Why do I want 
to blame him? Well, I'm more than a little irritated with him for giving up 
composing (he composed the great theme to the equally great "The Usual 
Suspects") so he could direct a movie like this. No, all the blame can rest 
firmly on the shoulders of the film's three writers (another bad movie with 
multiple writers. What is this?). This script is so insipidly stupid it 
doesn't deserve to be analyzed, but I'm going to anyway. First of all, the 
title makes no sense. Granted, the characters are making a movie about the 
first "Urban Legends" film, but the killer doesn't kill based on urban 
legends (except for the first victim, but that was the movie's only somewhat 
interesting scene). Second, the mystery element is terrible. It's  painfully 
obvious who the killer is. I won't say here of course, but if you don't 
figure it out you must have been asleep (not that I can blame you for that. 
Wish I'd fallen asleep). Third, the movie is more predictable than - than - 
I can't even think of a comparison. You know exactly who is going to die 
from the first ten minutes of the movie. Finally, the script borrows from 
everything. From "The Blair Witch Project", from ever slasher film ever 
made, even from "The Usual Suspects" (at least there was a scene that had a 
Usual Suspects feel to it).</P>
<P>Okay, now that I've ground another movie into the dirt and spit on it, I 
guess I should make note of the film's good points (this won't take long). 
There is one good gore scene for all the gore lovers out there. Anthony 
Anderson does have a few funny moments. That about does it. One thing that 
really shocked me was that we had a serial killer dressed in fencing garb 
(or at least the mask) and we didn't get one "En Garde" or "Touche". That 
just shows lack of ability on the parts of the writers (Hah! as though 
everything else didn't). The film's score is decent enough, and big 
surprise, it's by John Ottman. "Urban Legends: Final Cut" runs 100 minutes, 
which is about an hour and a half too long. At one point the characters say 
that the question was asked, "Is film more important than life?" Whoever 
asked that obviously never saw this movie. I recommend "ULFC" to those 
strange people who love cliche ridden, predictable teen slasher movies, but 
to no one else. I give the film one and a half out of five stars. Oh! Before 
I forget, the film does contain one legitimate scare: it leaves itself open 
for a sequel. Be afraid, be very afraid.</P>
