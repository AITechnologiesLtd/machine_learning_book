                            WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN 
                       A Film Review by Michael J. Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael J. Legeros</PRE>

<PRE>Running Times 124 Minutes </PRE>
<PRE>=== </PRE>
<P>     What do you do if your wife is a drunk?  That is the question posed  
by WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, a middle-of-the-road movie-of-the-week  
that's neither gritty enough nor sappy enough to be completely  
interesting. </P>
<P>     Michael (Andy Garcia) and Alice Green (Meg Ryan) are the model  
yuppie couple. He's an airplane pilot and she's a guidance counselor.  
Together they live in a comfortable San Franciso home and have two  
adorable pre-teen girls (Tina Majorino and Mae Whitman) and one dedicated  
babysitter (Lauren Tom). But something's amiss in Wonderland as Alice is  
imbibing increasing amounts of alcohol.  Her hubby doesn't smell the  
signs until after an accident on a Mexican vacation. She vows change, he  
accepts change and, of course, the problem stays a problem.. </P>
<P>     On the Squish Scale, WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is surprisingly  
tolerable. The standard teary tricks-- such as the obligatory musical  
montage-- are all very tasteful and the director doesn't try to pull too  
many strings at once.  That is, with two exceptions. </P>
<P>     The more sensitive viewers will gasp when Alice drunkenly strikes at  
her child. (Listen to the audience!) And all able-bodied attendees should  
probably leave five minutes before the film finishes to avoid any  
accidents on tear-soaked surfaces. :) </P>
<P>     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN doesn't have much of an edge, either, and  
never elaborates on the hows and whys of drug addiction.  But who cares?   
The leads are attractive and, despite a pace that leaves way too much  
room for second-guessing, deliver a reasonably believable story. </P>
<P>     You can't beat Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia for star power. The  
criminally cute Ryan has a good roller-coaster role, even if her  
character isn't completely lived-in.  Garcia has the harder part to play.  
His character is *so* adorably concerned and *so* far off-base from  
knowing how to help his wife.  He's a marvel of male misunderstanding and  
helps drive home the message that recovery requires work on *both* sides  
of the equation. </P>
<P>     Technical credits are all very good, with the exception of whoever  
came up with that terrible title. There is a reason that certain states  
have laws prohibiting the naming of a film after any song covered by  
Michael Bolton. :) </P>
<PRE>TRIVIA NOTE:  Writer Al Franken is the *same* Al Franken who wanders  
              about TV's "Saturday Night Live" and who once made funny  
              faces at a gorilla in TRADING PLACES. </PRE>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is a middle-of-the-road movie-of- 
              the-week about alcoholism that's neither gritty enough nor  
              sappy enough to be completely interesting. </PRE>
