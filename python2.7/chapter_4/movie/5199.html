<PRE>                                 BULL DURHAM
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1988) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        "Baseball is my religion," Susan Sarandon announces at the 
beginning of BULL DURHAM. And apparently, her form of 
communion is torrid sex with one minor league baseball player a year. 
The movie follows the minor league Durham Bulls (whoever named 
the movie was apparently cixelsyd... excuse me, dyslexic), more 
specifically, Sarandon's two prospects for the gigolo position. The first 
prospect is young Tim Robbins, the impulsive pitcher who "f*cks like 
he pitches." (At 95 miles an hour?) The other prospect is aging catcher 
Kevin Costner, who has been busted down to A-ball from the big 
leagues.</P>
<P>        Touch choice, eh? The elimination round comes as 
Sarandon invites them both back to her place -- and wouldn't 
_that_ be the threesome from hell! Costner storms out after learning what the arrangement is all about, leaving Sarandon to tie Robbins to 
her bed and read poetry to him all night. You see, it's not all sex, she 
also teaches her young charges the rules and secrets of life. They 
acquire the essential knowledge of life through wild, animal sex, 
which leads to the obvious question -- why don't the state 
universities offer this kind of program?!</P>
<P>        Costner is assigned by the team manager to do much the 
same thing with Robbins in a non-sexual way. So, over the course of 
the movie, Robbins hones his talent into major league-quality pitching 
with advice from Costner and Sarandon. According to BULL 
DURHAM, the way to succeed in baseball is to wear garter belts under 
your uniform and learn to breathe through your eyelids like the Mayan 
Indians. You didn't hear it from me, but that's also the key to 
succeeding in the movie-reviewing business.</P>
<P>        BULL DURHAM has an intriguing premise, mixing 
America's two favorite pastimes, and follows through with it for the 
first half of the movie, but gets off track around the five-inning mark, 
when Robbins gets on a winning streak and decided to quit slipping 
Sarandon the screwball every night, a duty we all know Costner will 
take up sooner or later. He does, of course, in a sex scene none of us 
ever wanted to see. Still, the film has its moments, comedic and 
dramatic, and is worth watching for its big-league talent. No 
rookies here, baby.</P>
