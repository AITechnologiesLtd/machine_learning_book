<PRE>ALMOST FAMOUS
-------------</PRE>
<P>When he was just fifteen in the early 70's, writer/director Cameron Crowe
("Jerry Maguire") became a rock journalist , graduating to the staff of
'Rolling Stone' at sixteen.  In his new film, "Almost Famous," fictional
William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit) is a fifteen year old rock writer
whose meeting with his hero, legendary Creem editor Lester Bangs (Philip
Seymour Hoffman) results in an assigment that turns into a Rolling Stone
story on the road with his favorite band, Stillwater.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Clearly a labor of love, "Almost Famous" charts the maturation of a young
rock journalist amidst a world of conflicts.  William's single mother Elaine,
(Oscar winner Frances McDormand, "Fargo") an educator with unusual ideas,
has watched her eldest, Anita (Zooey Deschanel, "Mumford"), fly the coop in a 
fit of rebelliousness.  Now she overcompensates, fearfully allowing William 
to follow his dream, even though that will lead him into the clutches of rock 
and roll, which she knows is all about drugs and sex.</P>
<P>When William's met with resistance getting into the backstage area, he's
befriended by the BandAids ('we're not groupies, we're into the music'),
particularly the mysterious and worldly Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, "200 
Cigarettes").  Meeting Stillwater, particularly the charismatic Russell
Hammond (Billy Crudup, "Jesus' Son"), immediately catches William between
his true fan incliniations and Lester's advice to never become friends
with those you write about.  This intensifies when the group board the 'Almost
Famous 1973' tour bus and hit the road.  William will watch as his beloved
Penny disregards her own advice and falls deeply for the married Russell
while lead singer Jeff (Jason Lee, "Chasing Amy") fumes as Russell captures
the lion's share of their publicity.  Russell evades William's interview
attempts from one state to the next as Rolling Stone dogs him for material
and mom insists he return home for his high school graduation, constantly
reminding him 'Don't do drugs!'</P>
<P>Two shattering events finally force William to play his hand, report his
story and return home wiser and experienced, if disillusioned.  Crowe
neatly manages to heal both of William's families, the one he was born to
and the one he adopted, at the crossroads of Penny Lane.</P>
<P>"Almost Famous" is a well acted ensemble piece without a single lackluster
note.  Fugit anchors the film as the intelligent innocent abroad who faces
ethical challenges beyond his years.  Kate Hudson gives a starmaking
performance as the naively experienced Penny Lane, a sixteen year old earth
mother, a worldly babe-in-the-woods.  Crudup is startling good as the
gorgeous rocker who tries to do right in the face of too much temptation.
Crudup's really coming into his own with this performance following "Jesus'
Son" and "Without Limits" and should cease to be mistaken for Johnny Depp.
Frances McDormand provides most of the film's humor as the relentlessly
protective mom who terrifies hotel managers and quotes Goethe to a cowed
Russell long distance.  Jason Lee adopts the proper rock star slouch and
swagger as Stillwater's lead singer and the ever brilliant Philip Seymour
Hoffman embodies the 'uncool' Bangs.  Fairuza Balk makes an impression as
stylishly hip yet caring BandAid Sapphire while Anna Paquin only makes
any impression at all when her character is utilized to impart early, important
information to William.</P>
<P>Crowe and his team, cinematographer John Toll ("Braveheart"), art directors
Clay A. Griffith and Clayton R. Hartley ("Jerry Maguire"), and costume
designer Betsy Heimann ("Jerry Maguire") capture the look and feel of 
the early 1970's.  Crowe's wife Nancy Wilson (formerly of the band Heart)
provides the score which is complemented by rock standards of the time.
Peter Frampton acted as technical consultant, teaching the members of
the fictional Stillwater how to play like a real rock band on stage.</P>
<P>"Almost Famous" is a warm, human and true rite of passage that will bring
baby boomers back to times of incense and peppermints while introducing
younger generations to a golden era on the fringe of corporatization.</P>

<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Following the tremendous success of his last film, "Jerry Maguire,"
writer/director Cameron Crowe digs back into his own past to tell the
quasi-autobiographical story of 15-year old William Miller (Patrick Fugit).
It's 1973 and rock music is in transition. William, a passionate fan of music 
and damn fine writer for a kid, gets a gig with Rolling Stone magazine to 
interview an up-and-coming band - Stillwater. Much to his mom's (Frances 
McDormand) consternation, he takes the assignment and hits the rock tour 
circuit in "Almost Famous."</P>
<P>Helmer Crowe has had an eclectic career in the entertainment industry from his
early days as a teen reporter for such underground and mainstream publications
as Creem, Rolling Stone, Playboy, and The LA Times. He was only 16-years old
when he made editor at Rolling Stone and published his best-selling novel, 
'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', at the tender age of 22. Crowe was tapped to 
write the screenplay of his book and, in 1982, the highly popular film 
adaptation was released. Since then, he has busily worked in the film industry, 
receiving major kudos for "Jerry Maguire" in 1996. The writer/director utilizes 
his own past experience as a rock and roll journalist to create the story for 
"Almost Famous."</P>
<P>Crowe's alter ego, William, is a remarkably bright kid who loves the music of
his day. His writing talent really impresses legendary rock 'n' roll journalist
Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who helps publish the youngster's
articles. This friendship, with Bangs acting as William's muse and mentor,
results in a golden opportunity for the young writer and the chance to write a
feature article for Rolling Stone magazine - at the tender age of 15! William
chooses a favorite band, Stillwater, as his subject and, with expense account
in hand, joins the band while on tour.</P>
<P>The tale begins slowly as baby-faced William tries to use his credentials as a
journalist for Rolling Stone and is denied access backstage for an interview. A
pretty, young "Band-Aid" - devoted followers of Stillwater - named Penny
Lane (Kate Hudson, "200 Cigarettes"), only 16 herself, takes the bewildered
William under her wing and introduces him to the band. Stillwater's leader,
Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup, "Jesus' Son"), takes a liking to William and an
uncertain bond is formed between journalist and band.</P>
<P>For William, the experience is a coming of age that impacts him both personally
and professional. His mentor, Bangs, had advised him from the start not to make
friends with the rock stars. Doing so would only cause the budding journalist
to compromise his work. William also has to contend with a loving, protective
mother who doesn't want to let her boy go out into the cold, cruel world. And,
along with the inevitable friendship that does grow between William and the
members of Stillwater, he falls for Penny. All of these crises and
considerations are tough for a teen, but, in the end, William overcomes every
obstacle.</P>
<P>Even though it's based on Crowe's real-life experiences, "Almost Famous" is a
true fantasy tale with William entering a dream world populated by the
music-makers he has idolized all of his young life. But, there is more to the
story as we watch the rise and fall and resurrection of an American rock band.
And, because of the wonderful Frances McDormand, we see the impact on the
family as she unwillingly sends her babies go off into the world. Plus, there 
is romance, rivalry, rowdiness and recklessness, too.</P>
<P>Newcomer Patrick Fugit is the picture's anchor from the start. The fresh-faced
youngster is not deterred by the presence of the veteran actors around him and
has an incorruptible sweetness about him that makes his William a likable kid.
Of those supporting William, McDormand shines out. Her Elaine Miller is a
single parent, intelligent and educated, who suddenly hits that crossroad of 
life where her chicks leave the nest and there is nothing she can do to stop 
it. She tries to keep hold of William, from long distance, and advise him, 
repeatedly - and, to very funny effect - "DON'T DO DRUGS!" There is a warmth 
and richness to McDormand's performance that really fleshes Elaine into a real, 
loving, caring and intelligent parent and person.</P>
<P>Kate Hudson gives a star-making turn as the irrepressibly buoyant, yet
pragmatic leader of the Band-Aids. Penny treats her devotion to the band of the 
hour with an almost reverence. Her particular closeness to Stillwater's leader, 
Russell, causes a friction between William and the band as the writer falls 
deeper and deeper for the vivacious Penny. Billy Crudup carries himself well as 
the handsome rock star in the making. The actor is not just a pretty face and
provides depth to his performance of the near-hedonistic guitarist.</P>
<P>Jason Lee ("Chasing Amy") plays the band's lead singer, Jeff Bebe, and, while
not given a great deal to do off stage, he cuts a convincing swath as a rock
musician when on stage.  Fairuza Balk ("The Waterboy") and Anna Paquin 
("X-Men") play two of the Band-Aids and Noah Taylor ("Shine") is unrecognizable 
as the band's manager, Dick Roswell.) Philip Seymour Hoffman is, once again, 
terrific in his pivotal role as William's muse, Lester Bangs. The more I watch 
this actor, the more I think that he is developing into one of the greats in 
his field.</P>
<P>Two-time Academy Award winner John Toll ("Legends of the Fall" and
"Braveheart") gives a crisp look to the photography, especially the concert 
footage. Art director Clay A. Griffith ("Jerry Maguire") provides the right 
look to the 70's period design without ostentation. Nancy Wilson (from the rock 
band Heart) provides a score that fits in with the 70's mood of the film. Rock 
classics from the 60's and 70's - Simon and Garfunkel, Elton John, Joni 
Mitchell, the Allman Brothers, Stevie Wonder and others - give just the right 
and familiar note for the time.</P>
<P>The quasi-documentary feel of "Almost Famous" gives the film an edginess as we
watch the slow disintegration of the band while, simultaneously, their fame
begins to build. We see things through the same rose colored glasses as William
and we, too, become disillusioned with the star machine and what it does to its
members. By film's end, William is a wiser young man, but one whose innocence
is now a thing of the past.</P>
<P>"Almost Famous" may be looked upon as an indulgence by auteur Crowe, but there
is an honesty and reality to the film that make it a worthwhile flick to catch.
I give it a B.</P>
