<PRE>Review: Antz (1998)
Review By: Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        Films that are animated sometimes get a bum rap. Mainly because people
assume that just because they're cartoons, these films are just kids stuff.
Dreamwork Entertainment's new computer animated film "Antz" definitely isn't
just kids stuff, or at least it tries it's hardest not to be.</P>
<P>        Antz's plot is simple enough; a worker ant, nicknamed Z(whose full name
is Z-4195), is tired of his life of forced labor and longs for freedom.
Troubled by ideas of a heaven-like place called "insect-topia" and his totally
by chance dance with Princess Bala(princess of the colony) in a bar; Z becomes
even more unhappy with his station in life.  In an endeavor to meet with
Princess Bala again, Z persuades his soldier friend, Weaver, into temporarily
switching jobs with him. Soon after while Z is attending a military assembly,
his squad is unexpectedly sent to war and Z has no choice, but to fight with
them.</P>
<P>        Z doesn't do much fighting, so he manages to be the only ant too
survive the battle, and goes home a war hero. While being introduced to the
Queen Ant, Z accidentally kidnaps the princess and inadvertently escapes the
ant colony with her. Now both Z & Bala are trapped outside the colony, and
they begin their journey for the mythical "insect-topia".</P>
<P>        Unfortunately for Z, the kidnapping of the princess has ruined the
evil scheme of the Hitler-like ant, General Mandible and his cunning comrade,
Colonel Cutter. The General is not going to see his plan ruined and is going
to do all he can to find Z, and get back the princess.</P>
<P>        The strongest point of the film are the vocal performances. Woody
Allen is just great as Z, he really does an impressive job. Tons of other big
names turn in good performances in their respective roles: Sharon
Stone(Bala), Sylvester Stallone(Weaver), and Gene Hackman(General Mandible). 
Another strong point are the one liners that add much needed fun to Antz.</P>
<P>        When you get right down to it, Antz is an Animal Farm clone. Z is
fighting a battle for individualism in a totalitarian society. While all this
may be well and good, Antz is making a point that no one objects to. There was
no need to make a nineties version of Animal Farm and the filmmakers got so
busy attempting to add symbolism, they forgot about how weak the actual story
was. So what you end up with is an interesting attempt at satire, some clever
dialog, good voices,  neat animation, and an unfortunately sparse story to
bring it all together.</P>
