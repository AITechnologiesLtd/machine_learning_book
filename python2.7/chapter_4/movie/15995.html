<PRE>EDWARD SCISSORHANDS
Rating: ***1/2
PG-13, 1990
Director: Tim Burton
Screenplay: Caroline Thompson
Story: Tim Burton & Caroline Thompson
Starring Cast: Johnny Depp, Vincent Price, Winona Ryder</PRE>
<P>Tim Burton's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a cinematic fairy tale, a flight of
fancy that sails on the wings of Burton's vivid imagination, and yet it
still bears implications upon the real world. It's a film which is narrated
in flashback to a little boy's question about where snow comes from. It's a
film in which the protagonist, a boy named Edward (Johnny Depp), was
invented by a strange scientist living in a castle (Vincent Price) and is
eventually discovered still living there, many years after the scientist's
death, by none other than the Avon lady. And yet it's also a film in which
the fundamental conflicts and relationships are the same ones that we find
right next door.</P>
<P>Burton's films have generally met with mixed reaction among both critics
and the general public. Even his less-than-stellar efforts, however, are
infused with a unique and remarkable visual style that sets him apart among
modern filmmakers. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is no exception, as Burton creates
both an unnervingly bright and colorful suburbia that is somehow
intimidating in its cheerfulness and a majestically constructed Gothic
castle that has been Edward's home. Composer Danny Elfman supplies the film
with a score that is appropriately both whimsical and sad, a perfect fit
for this warm-hearted but ultimately tragic tale of an outsider trying to
find his place among "normal" people.</P>
<P>The aesthetics of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS place it definitively within a
fantasy universe. This is a good thing, because otherwise viewers might ask
questions such as why no one aside from the Avon lady ever wanted to have a
look inside the mysterious castle sitting at the end of Main Street, or
what kind of scientist could create a an otherwise perfectly functional
human being but not be able to get the hands right, or why on earth he gave
Edward scissors  as a replacement until he figured it out. In any case, the
Avon lady decides to bring Edward out of his lonely castle and into her
home. At first, he's a sensation: all the neighbors come to visit the
family and see the strange boy who can perform tricks such as sculpting the
bushes into fantastic sculptures. All too quickly, however, he is
unwittingly dragged into a robbery by the Avon lady's daughter Kim (Winona
Ryder) and then incurs the wrath of her jealous boyfriend when she starts
to fall in love with Edward. Prejudices take over, and Edward comes to be
seen not as the kind-hearted but easily confused individual that he is, but
as a dangerous monster who must be driven out of their community.</P>
<P>It would be easy to see Edward as nothing more than a generic freak, a foil
for an "it's okay to be different" message. I think that Burton and his
screenwriter, Caroline Thompson, intend for Edward to serve as a metaphor
for something a little more specific: the naive, socially inept artist. He
is liked and admired when he's performing elaborate tricks for an audience,
but few if any of them care about him as a person: he's just another
novelty for them to enjoy. He is easily manipulated, and ends up being the
fall guy for a crime which he barely understands simply because a beautiful
young woman whom he trusts asked for his help. Worst of all, his attempts
to fit in and help others often go wrong, provoking further anger and
alienation, in his case because he has a tendency to literally cut things
up by accident when he gets confused and uneasy.</P>
<P>There are quite a few clichés in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, though not all of
them detract from the story. There is almost no development of the romance
between Edward and Kim, but the film gets away with this due to its fairy
tale format. Even Kim's mean-spirited boyfriend, a cardboard cut-out from
the Book of Evil Teenage Movie Characters, manages not to irritate for the
most part. Still, the film would have been fine without a duel to the death
at high altitude. There are also a couple of the townspeople who are just a
little too over the top, such as the Bible-thumping fundamentalist who is
convinced that Edward is a demon and the seductive hair stylist who finds
Edward attractive.</P>
<P>In the end, however, the film's good qualities are enough to carry it past
any mistakes. Imaginative, clever, and strangely touching, EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS stands as a high point of Burton's career.</P>
