<P>  The Spanish Civil War 1936-39 was perhaps Europe's most
ideological struggle of the 20th century pitting the
Republicans of the left (liberals and Communists and their
acolytes) against the Fascists on the right (landowners and
upper clergy and their sympathizers).  Hitler was to support
the Fascists by testing the power of the Luftwaffe in bombing
expeditions over Spain while the Soviet Union backed the
Republican side.  "Butterfly," which is based on three stories
in Manuel Rivas's novel "Que Me Quieres, Amor," indeed is
"a beautiful marriage of film and literature" as the major writer
Gabriel Garcia Marquez has said.  Formerly "Butterfly's
Tongue," or "La lengua de las mariposas," but now known
simply by the title "Butterfly," Jose Luis Cuerda's film based
on Rafael Azcona's wonderful adaptation of the novel into a
screenplay takes place just on the cusp of the Spanish Civil
War in the northern regions of Galicia.  While "Butterfly"
shows the impact of the changes that would be brought about
by the death of the Republic, our attention is focussed not so
much on the transfiguration of Spain that would result but on
the idyllic society evoked by the novelist as seen through the
awe-struck eyes of a bright 7-year-old boy.  If you enjoyed
the performance of Haley Joel Osment in M. Night
Shamayalan's "The Sixth Sense," you'll adore the
performance of little Moncho (Manuel Lozano) as he takes in
and reflects on the world of his village (actually filmed in
regions of Santiago) at his tender age.</P>
<P>   Moncho is a delicate young man, eager to learn, but
introduced to school a year or so after the proper time
because he is afflicted with asthma.  Though clinging to the
apron strings of his mother, Rosa (Uxia Blanco) and confiding
to his older brother Andres (Alexis de los Santos) that he
fears being hit by his new teacher, he quickly develops a
rapport with the kind and gentle Don Gregorio (Fernando
Fernan Gomez)--who is to introduce the class to the beauties
of nature in the surrounding countryside as well as to the
grace of the printed word within the ramshackle schoolhouse. 
Don Gregorio's considerate demeanor and world-view are
reflected in the character of Moncho's dad, Ramon (Gonzalo
Uriarte), a tailor and Republican party member who shares
the teacher's mild disdain for organized religion, but is
scorned by the likes of one coarse and drunken braggart--a
metaphor for Fascism--who is fond of rough sex with a
woman whose background becomes a startling revelation in
the story.</P>
<P>   To further the film's authenticity, the political factionalism of
the town--which reflects distinctions present throughout
Spain--are soft-pedaled until the shattering payoff at the
conclusion.  After all, what does a 7-year-old know about
such things...and remember that everything that we see we
are viewing through the eyes of little Moncho.  The point of
the production, instead, is to show us the arcadian conditions
existing in this village just a few years after the toppling of the
Spanish monarchy in 1931 when that Iberian country was
living under Republican rule, and one could profess atheism if
he chose, or not, and no one would persecute a person for
his beliefs.  Moncho bears witness to his first sexual act
(which his pal Roque, played by Tamar Novas, explains is
like "when bitches get stuck together only human beings have
to be in love").  Moncho also demonstrates his respect for his
big brother, Andres, who gets to play in a touring band, the
love he feels for his parents, and most of all, the awe with
which he views his kindly schoolmaster.  As the teacher,
Fernando Fernan Gomez turns in the kind of performance
we'd expect from the man who played the title figure in 1998
in "El Abuelo."  Gomez, who was nominated for the Goya
(Spanish Oscar) for his role in "The Grandfather," is
considered one of Spain's great actors and becomes in
Cuerda's production a remarkable symbol for the kinder and
more gentle government that Spain enjoyed before that
benevolence was choked off by Franco's Fascists.</P>
