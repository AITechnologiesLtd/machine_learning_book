<P>"What this film does for the drag scene is what Sean Connery did for 
the secret service.  It glamorizes it." 
          - Michael Hamlyn, producer of PRISCILLA </P>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT is about the most
fun you can have with three guys who like to dress up as women.  There
are movies of MRS. DOUBTFIRE's ilk, which treat crossdressing as a
joke, then there's JUST LIKE A WOMAN, which has its maudlin moments.
Somewhere in between is PRISCILLA, which takes the matter seriously,
but delivers a lot of laughs while doing so.</P>
<P>     The latest export from down under, PRISCILLA is the story of three
drag queens--Bernadette/Ralph (Terrence Stamp), Mitzi/Tick (Hugo
Weaving from Jocelyn Moorehouse's PROOF), and Felicia/Adam (soap star
Guy Pearce)--on their way across the Australian desert to play a gig.
Along the way, their bus Priscilla breaks down, and they have to rely
on help from strangers.  And, while crossdressing performers are
accepted in the big city, their welcome in a less urban setting is not
always warm and friendly.</P>
<P>     The dance numbers are lavish and fun to watch, whether they're
performed in the middle of the desert, atop a bar in some
out-of-the-way town, or on a stage in Sydney.  Mostly seventies disco
hits (including once-popular tunes by Gloria Gaynor, the Village
People, and Abba), these songs are lip-synched and gyrated to with
gusto by the transvestite trio as they don garish costumes and even
worse makeup to wow their audiences.</P>
<P>     There are moments of seriousness amidst all the zaniness as the
twin specters of intolerance and homophobia (two sides of the same
coin) cast a pall over the proceedings.  Give director Stephan Elliot
credit for not dwelling overmuch on these instances.  He knows that
their mere inclusion is sufficient to get the message across.</P>
<P>     The often-ribald comedy varies from amusing to hilarious.  Most of
the best lines are too "colorful" to repeat here.  PRISCILLA is not a
film for those who are made uneasy by Benny Hill.  The end credits
(during and after) contain some of the movie's most inventive humor.
Early departers deprive themselves.</P>
<P>     While each of the three leads is good, the standout performance
belongs to normally-serious veteran actor Terrence Stamp, who has
previously appeared in such diverse outings as BILLY BUDD and SUPERMAN
(I and II).  Here, he brings a quiet dignity to the role of
Bernadette.  That's not easy to do considering some of the outrageous
costumes he's required to wear.</P>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT is a great deal
more appealing than many might suppose it to be.  It's a road movie
that's anything but typical or traditional.  So, whether or not you
share the proclivities of Bernadette, Mitzi, and Felicia, the trio's
cinematic cabaret is nevertheless something to smile and laugh your way
through.</P>
