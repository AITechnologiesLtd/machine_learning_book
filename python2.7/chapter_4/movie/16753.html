<P>   A recent article in the New York Times Science section
takes the view that mid-life crisis is in large part a red
herring: that the vast majority of people go through their
thirties and forties quite content with their lives. Well, heck,
Julian Barnes, whose novel "Metroland" was published in
1980, let us in on that secret two decades ago!  With due
respect for the genuine problems that afflict our world, many
"crises" are manufactured or inflated by the press, by
Hollywood, and by the media in general to sell stories.  </P>
<P>   "Metroland," adapted from Barnes' novel for the screen by
Adrian Hodges and directed by Philip Saville, is about Chris
(Christian Bale), a man in his early thirties--not quite at
midlife but acting as though he were--who seems to have it
all.  He's got a lovely and smart, though cynical wife, Marion
(Emily Watson), a healthy daughter, and a tidy home in a
clean London suburb known as Metroland (the last stop on
the city's metro line). He enjoys a moderately successful
career as a commercial photographer, but senses that
something is missing.  He's too secure.  When his best friend
Toni (Lee Ross) drops in for a visit in 1977, Chris's mind is
transported back to an earlier, more carefree time during the
late sixties when he and Toni part company to seek
adventure in their separate ways.  Chris, insisting like
so many adolescents and twenty-somethings today that he
will never be like his staid, bourgeois parents, takes his
camera to Paris.  He opts for a Bohemian life, scraping up a
few francs each day from his pictures, and enjoys a torrid
affair with a beautiful, liberated Parisian woman, Annick (Elsa
Zylberstein). With her, the inexperienced Chris loses his
virginity (in an amusing scene showing him as a clumsy oaf)
and becomes increasingly committed to the release which the
French way of life afford him.  His spirit changes when he
meets an English girl, Marion (Emily Watson), who brings out
Chris's homesickness and whom he ultimately chooses
because, really, you can't escape your innate character.  The
fun-loving Marion is more restrained, more earthbound than
her French competition, and Chris recognizes her as his
soul-mate.</P>
<P>   Stories about once-radical friends who drop back into
society inevitably bring to mind American classics like
Lawrence Kasdan's 1983 "The Big Chill," a surface-level look
at the characteristic cycle that brings head-in-the-clouds
young people back to Earth.  It's not just that we acquire
kids, mortgages, and steady jobs we want to hold on to
because of incremental gains in position, salary and pension. 
It's that after we've sown our wild oats for a decade or so
and have seen the boozy party scene for what it is, we
realize that we not only can't go back; we don't even want
that life any more.  With stability comes a kind of contentment
that we'd not trade for the world, and few (if any) pictures
bring that notion home more strikingly, honestly, and
authentically as "Metroland."  Though Toni and Chris have
parted ways after a long and intense friendship, they remain
fond of each other, though their life-styles remain far apart
when they reunite.  Toni remains the perpetual adolescent,
still traveling--to Africa, to Italy, to California and New York--
still picking up girl friends and reawakening in Chris a
questioning of his bourgeois ideals.  Has Chris sold out for a
boring job and life in a suburb where each day monotonously
repeats its predecessor?  Was Chris wrong to marry
girl-next-door Marion, his sexual life restricted by each cry of
his baby daughter in the next room--while Toni's days are
pervaded with wine, women and song?</P>
<P>    Director Saville resists the temptation to cast Toni as a
homebreaker.  He is a man who, despite his many
acquaintances on three continents, longs to reestablish the
good old days with his boyhood chum.  Toni's return does,
however, threaten to injure Chris's marriage as Chris
increasingly looks back with nostalgic thoughts on his
untroubled years in Paris.</P>
<P>   Mark Knopfler's original soundtrack highlights the distinct
personalities of the three principals: Toni, who refuses to
grow up, or at least to surrender to what society tells him is
mature; Marion, the sensible if domesticated woman who
enjoys her suburban life, resisting the latest threat to its
continuation; Annick, the seductive, devil-may-care French
lover whose seductiveness oddly becomes insipid in Chris's
mind; and Chris, torn between the glitter of his youth as a
freelance photographer in an unrepressed Paris and his more
serene thoughts about his life in Metroland.</P>
<P>   For all the story's motif--that life is best when we adapt
ourselves contentedly with its seven Shakespearean stages--
Saville aims for some balance in displaying one dispirited
commuter (John Wood), taking his last ride to Metroland after
forty-two years with a company that has scarcely recognized
his contributions.  Chris looks closely at him, imagining
himself three decades hence--a miserable, broken man
regretting that he did not follow Toni's call to arms.</P>
<P>   Emily Watson, having turned in a first-rate performance as
Jacqueline du Pre in one of the ten best picture of 1998
continues to strike us with her lack of affectation.  While
Christian Bale appears in virtually every scene, Watson, the
author's ideological mouthpiece, anchors the show.   Jean-
Francois Robin's photography nicely contrasts the party-
loving Paris of La Vie Boheme with the London suburb of
generally contended suburbanites washing their cars, raising
their families, making their peace with the passing years.</P>
