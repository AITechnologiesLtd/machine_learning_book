<PRE>                 PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>     "God, please help us through this.  God, please help us through
this,"  wails John Mark Byers.  His eight year old stepson has been
brutally tortured, raped, and murdered and his grief is understandably
overwhelming him.  Viewers will be whispering the same sentiments to
themselves as they sit through the movie.</P>
<P>     PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS is one of the
most realistically tragic documentaries ever.  Directed and edited by
brilliant documentarians Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky, who worked
together previously on BROTHER'S KEEPER, the show is a tour de force.
Rarely has the cinema been this powerful, this engrossing, and this
painful to watch.</P>
<P>     In 1993 three second graders, Steven Branch, Christopher Byers,
and Michael Moore were viciously killed at Robin Hood Hills near West
Memphis, Arkansas.  Soon thereafter the police picked up three
teenagers: Jessie Lloyd Misskelly, age 17; Damien Wayne Echols, age 18;
and Charles Jason Baldwin, age 16 and charged them with the murder.</P>
<P>     The police find satanic books with key passages underlined in
Damien Echols's bedroom, and they get a full confession from Jessie
Misskelly that implicates all three of them.  Misskelly weaves a
macabre tale of satanic rituals that were performed on the hapless
little boys.  A television reporter asks Chief Inspector Gary Gitchell,
"On a scale of one to ten how solid do you think the case is?"
Gitchell confidently replies, "Eleven."</P>
<P>     The filmmakers were afforded a unique opportunity that they used
to maximum effect.  They were present during almost every part of the
trial and its preparations.  This includes attorney strategy sessions
and interviews with the defendants and the witnesses.</P>
<P>     The editing of the film is flawless.  It serves only to enlighten
and never to confuse.  If there is a mistake made in the film, it is
that the filmmakers are somewhat more sympathetic to the defendant's
arguments than to the prosecution's, but it is on whole, a
well-balanced documentary.</P>
<P>     Although the film is unrated, it is NC-17 material.  The shocking
video and still pictures of the crime scene are essential to showing
graphically how heinous were the actions of the killers, but they are
suitable for viewing only by mature adults.  Even hardened critics like
I frequently have to look away.  In the clips that we are shown the
boys have turned blue and are mutilated.  Sickening.  Sickening.  And
yet, I am glad the show was this explicit.  The truth is horrible, and
should not be censored.  People should know how bad it is.</P>
<P>     In the press kit, the filmmakers argue that the reason they feel
their approach is not gratuitous is that "our society has become so
desensitized to news reports of violent crime that we felt it was
important that the viewer really feels and emotionally recognizes the
horrific nature of the crime."  I concur.</P>
<P>     Because of the confession, the trials are separated with
Misskelly's trial going first.  Although there are many surprises at
the trials, I will not give anything away other than that necessary to
set up the cases.  Suffice it to say, that you would not like to have
not been called to serve on either jury.  If you had been, the phrase
"reasonable doubt" and the pictures of the little boys would be
indelibly marked on your brain and would forever making your sleeping
difficult.</P>
<P>     The parents of the victims and of the accused take center stage in
this real life drama.  This is backwoods Arkansas.  The people in the
film are uniformly poor and naive.  Each is convinced that they know
all the answers and that god is on their side.</P>
<P>     In an alternatively moving and chilling sequence, John Mark Byers
sings "That old rugged Cross" in church.  After that he goes outside
and shows off a big gun he has that he claims has untraceable bullets.
He shoots round after round into an exploding pumpkin and tells the
camera how he will blow off the heads of those teenagers if the courts
ever let them go.</P>
<P>     Fundamentalist Christianity is prominently featured in the film.
One of the signs on the church proclaims that "Satan has no
unemployment problems."  People babble biblical phrases continually in
nonsensical arguments for their cause.</P>
<P>     The heart of the first trial is whether Jessie Misskelly, who has
an IQ of 72, gave his confession willingly.  Was he feed the
information by the police and just parroted some back to get them off
his back?  Before you decide if you think this is a potentially valid
line of reasoning, see the trial first.  It is not as simple as it
sounds.</P>
<P>     As I watched the film, I thought how I would have walked out had
it been a fictional show.  People like these do not exist, and the
actors are shamelessly overacting.  Except this is exactly what
happened and as it happened.</P>
<P>     In the second trial the evidence looks as if it may be mainly
circumstantial, and the big question is whether the prosecution can get
Jessie Misskelly to testify.  Both defense and prosecution have major
aces up their sleeves.  A parent of one of the victims gives a
Christmas present to a member of the documentary crew, and it turns out
that it may or may not be a key piece of evidence.</P>
<P>     During one of the trial's recesses, Damien complains that, "West
Memphis is sort of like Second Salem because whatever happens is blamed
on Satanism."</P>
<P>     Rather than evoking tears, the film is more likely to make your
emotional systems rupture because it is so hard to take in all that is
arrayed before you.  Clearly one of the best films of the year, and
certainly the hardest of them all to endure.</P>
<P>     PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS runs 2:30,
and I would not want one a minute of it deleted.  It is unrated but
would be NC-17.  It has some of the most horrendous images you will
ever see.  Do not let your teenagers go.  Period.  I give the film my
absolute top rating of **** and say people should see it if they are up
to it.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
