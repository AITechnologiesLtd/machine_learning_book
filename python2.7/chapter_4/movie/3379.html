<PRE>                             BULLETPROOF HEART
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<P>[This film was previously titled KILLER when it played in film
festivals.]</P>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     BULLETPROOF HEART is a movie with a strange name and a bizarre
twist on an old theme.  Anthony LaPaglia, who was great as the Mafia
boss's nephew in BETSY'S WEDDING, again plays a Mafia type.  This time
he is a highly paid professional hit man.  He gets a quick contract
from Peter Boyle to kill Mimi Rogers.  The twist is that Rogers knows
this and is waiting for LaPaglia to show up at her place to kill her.
The mystery is why is she being killed and is she actually in favor of
it or not.</P>
<P>     The script is good and provides several large laughs.  One of my
favorite scenes involves LaPaglia's incompetent sidekick played by Matt
Craven.  Craven explains that the reason he seems afraid of his own
shadow is that he has a Magnesium deficiency.  He pops these little
Magnesium pills at the right time and instant courage just like the
badge for bravery on the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz.</P>
<P>     The acting was good all around except I did not like the character
played by Craven--he got on my nerves after a while.  I have seen
Rogers give much stronger performances (see sometime SOMEONE TO WATCH
OVER ME or THE RAPTURE), but she was pretty good here. (She certainly
is one beautiful forty-year-old woman!  An age I can certainly indentify
with.)  The best work was done by LaPaglia and Boyle.</P>
<P>     Ultimately BULLETPROOF HEART is not a mystery as it is trivial to
guess the simple twists in the plot.  The ending is certainly
telegraphed from the beginning.  This movie is a two-person character
study, and either that works for you or it doesn't.  For me, I liked
some of the banter of the dialog, but kept feeling left empty.  The
show never offends, has some quite good moments, but it just did not
work for me.</P>
<P>     If you see the show, be sure and stay to the absolute end.  After
you have learned in the credits that this New York and "Jersey" movie
was actually filmed in Vancouver and after the very last credit has
rolled past, you get more movie!  I am not sure if you would call it a
serious outtake or an epilogue, but whatever it is and whatever it is
supposed to mean, most people will probably miss seeing it--unless
they are smart enough to read my reviews that is.</P>
<P>     The movie runs about right at 1:37.  It is not rated, but I
suspect it would get a (soft) R for its very low key, less than most TV
shows, violence, some heavy and a little unusual sex, and 10
milliseconds of female nudity.  It would be fine for any mature
teenager, but I can not bring myself to recommend it to anyone.  I
award it ** for the script and some good acting.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
