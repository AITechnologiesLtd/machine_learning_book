<P>     LIFE is funny sometimes...just not as often as you might expect.
Universal is promoting LIFE just the way you'd expect it to promote a film
starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence -- as a raucous comedy with
plenty of the insult humor, attitude and gay-baiting their target audience
has come to expect.  The funny thing is -- or isn't, as the case may be --
that LIFE is actually an attempt by the two comedians to grow up a little.
Anyone expecting to see Eddie and Martin doing their version of STIR CRAZY
is bound to be somewhat surprised to find Eddie and Martin doing their
version of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.</P>
<P>     It's a commendable effort by two performers best known for more
simple-minded material; it's just not a very successful one.  The
principal action begins in 1932, where two different men find themselves
in similar trouble.  Small-time hustler Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) is in
trouble with Harlem crime boss Spanky (Rick James) for running numbers in
his territory; mild-mannered Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) is in trouble
with Spanky for being short on the bill in Spanky's club.  To save both
their skins, Ray offers to bring Spanky a shipment of bootleg liquor from
Mississippi, with Claude as his partner.  Unfortunately, things go from
bad to worse down South, where Ray and Claude are convicted for a murder
they didn't commit and end up sentenced to life in the Mississippi State
Prison.</P>
<P>     Once the narrative gets to the prison setting (which takes around 30
minutes), the story predictably involves the new city-slicker inmates
learning the hard facts about their new milieu -- when not to back-talk
the bossman (Nick Cassavetes); when to turn over your cornbread to the
largest land mammal on two legs (Michael "Bear" Taliferro); why prison
makes strange bedfellows (literally).  The pacing may be a bit pokey, but
it still looks and smells like a mass-market comedy for a while.  That's
before screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone and director Ted
Demme start taking some intriguing detours.  In one scene, Ray begins
describing the nightclub he dreams of starting one day, momentarily taking
his fellow inmates somewhere wonderful; in another, a gay inmate (Miguel
A. Nunez Jr.) about to be released is treated with sympathy and a bit of
dignity.  As LIFE unfolds, it starts to feel surprisingly ambitious, not
at all like a whoop-it-up crowd-pleaser.</P>
<P>     As admirable as LIFE's reach may be, however, it generally exceeds
its grasp.  While it lays out the sub-plots and advancing years like an
epic in the making, the film-makers never appear entirely committed to
making a film that could alienate many of the stars' core fans.  Key
elements of the story -- Claude's fiancee leaving him for another man; a
sympathetic superintendent (Ned Beatty) dying before he can act on
evidence of our protagonists' innocence; even Ray and Claude's fate in the
film's climactic fire -- never actually appear on screen, the information
tagged on by an inmate (Obba Babatunde) narrating the tale in flashback.
LIFE is a frustrating experience, because every time it appears close to
making a connection to its characters it falls back on a lame joke to
reassure the viewers that they're still watching a comedy.</P>
<P>     I may be kinder to LIFE than it really deserves, simply because I was
so surprised by its tone.  Martin Lawrence, whose screen work has
generally bordered on the insufferable, does some fairly nice work as the
straight man in the duo, and Murphy is in fine form as his quintessential
fast talker.  Rick Baker's old-age makeup is also a star of the show,
taking the stars into their 90s (and, in the case of Lawrence, making him
look frighteningly like Whitman Mayo).  LIFE is effective in bits and
pieces, building on the predictable comedy in some unexpected ways.  It
just never builds on them in the necessary ways, never making the
friendship between Ray and Claude its primary dramatic concern.  It's a
film caught between what the film-makers wanted to do and what the studio
must have wanted them to do, just the clashing creation you'd expect from
a story that's part STIR CRAZY and part SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 life sentences:  5. </PRE>
