<PRE>              STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (SPECIAL EDITION)
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     Twenty years will make you forget how good a movie was.</PRE>
<P>     I was excited to see the rerelease of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, but
I had forgotten about how masterful the film is realized, and I had
especially forgotten what it looked like on the big screen.</P>
<P>     EMPIRE, newly restored by George Lucas and his cronies, makes the
remastered videotape look like a comic book.  While not much new has
been added (what has is pretty obvious, mainly an impressive sound
clean-up and digital animations of the Millennium Falcon's descent into
Cloud City), the story has held up monumentally against the INDEPENDENCE
DAYs and TWISTERs of the world.</P>
<P>     I've always found EMPIRE to be the HAMLET of science fiction,
basically because nothing good happens to the hero in the entire story. 
Luke Skywalker almost dies in the tundra of Hoth (watch for the
still-cheesy claymation(?) Tauntauns), sees the rebels sent on the run
through the galaxy, meets Yoda and fails to complete his Jedi training
on Dagobah, sees his pal Han Solo encased in carbonite, and loses his
hand in a fight with Darth Vader, whom he has learned is his father. 
All that, and C-3PO gets blasted, too!</P>
<P>     It's enough to make you cry, or enough at least to make you really
really want to see RETURN OF THE JEDI when it hits theaters again in
March.  I know I'm hooked!</P>
<P>     EMPIRE was always my favorite of the trilogy, and seeing it on the
big screen is not to be missed.</P>
