<PRE>                                   HOOK
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1991 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<P>     A few weeks ago, Robin Williams joked, "Hey, HOOK stars the stars
of ISHTAR and POPEYE and was directed by the man who brought you 1941,
so it has a history of people familiar with bombs."</P>
<P>     HOOK isn't a complete dud, but it's disappointing given the amount
of hype its gotten.</P>
<P>     HOOK has a great premise: What if Peter Pan grew up?  According to
an article in PREMIERE magazine, the premise popped out of the mouth of
the six-year-old son of the scriptwriter one day.  IMHO, most of the
problems in the film relate to the script and the direction.  Most of
the magic in the film is the credit of the art direction team, who
created a phenomenal Never-Never Land, and the special effects team, who
orchestrated some terrific flying.</P>
<P>     There's a long opening sequence in California showing what a
work-obsessed Yuppie Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is.  There's a lot
of unneeded setup between the time the movie opens, and the time a very
elderly Wendy (a winning performance by Maggie Smith) tells Peter that
"you are Peter Pan."  This sequence could have been minimized because
Peter's troubled relationship with his kids is done-to-death once
Captain Hook spirits the kids to Never-Never Land.</P>
<P>     Once TinkerBell drags Peter off to Never-Never Land to rescue his
kids, the action picks up, but only slightly.  There's some lovely
business around Hook realizing what a mundane dud Peter is now, and how
TinkerBell promises Hook to get Peter in to shape for a proper war.</P>
<P>     I've already mentioned that the movie has a lot of extraneous stuff
in it, but there are also a few inexplicable edits in it (okay, you can
attribute these inexplicable things to "magic," but still...).  One
weird quick cut shows Peter being hoisted into the Lost Boys treehouse,
but you never know *who* does it.  There are also some "magical" costume
changes.</P>
<P>     The biggest misstep of the movie was its handling of the Lost Boys.
Spielberg often does a great job directing one or two children at a
time, but the writing and direction of the Lost Boys stunk.  Most of the
boys were updated into punky or overly cute American kids.  It just felt
wrong.  There were too many "cute shots" of the kids, and a lot of
incredibly crude language at times.  Peter's acceptance by the boys was
tentative at first, but once Peter started believing in himself, they
started believing in him.</P>
<P>     One writing/directing problem in this movie is the same problem
that plagued 1941: You can see *everything* coming miles away.  There
are few surprises.  Also, there are two sequence that scream "THEME PARK
RIDE!"  I had this same feeling from THE ADDAMS FAMILY, where some stuff
felt like it was added to the movie for the sole purpose of being
developed into a theme park ride.</P>
<P>     I haven't talked about the acting of the main characters, and I
guess its because I have such mixed feelings about it.  IMHO, Peter Pan
is a role Robin Williams was born to play, but he almost does a better
job as Peter Banning, mundane, than Peter Pan, the eternal child.  While
Dustin Hoffman doesn't chew the scenery as Hook, he wavers wildly
between being a buffoon and being quite terrifying.  Charlie Korsimo is
alternately affecting and obnoxious as Peter's son Jack.  The girl who
plays the daughter, Maggie, is cute and spirited.  Julia Roberts is fine
as TinkerBell, but her performance seemed strange, and it just might
have been because she rarely acted *with* anyone.  They aren't terrible,
but they appeared to wear their characters like clothing.  On the other
hand, Bob Hoskins is wonderful as Smee, as is the actor who plays
Toodles, another aged Lost Boy.  Look for Phil Collins, David Crosby,
and Glenn Close in cameos.</P>
<P>     The essential problem with the script is it can't decide if its an
overblown fairy tale, or if it's a serious movie about parents and
children.  There are some genuinely affecting moments in the movie, but
there are other times when I felt blatantly manipulated.  So I think
that is where HOOK fails the most----if you can really get in to a
movie, you don't feel manipulated.</P>
<P>     In short, HOOK isn't a bomb, but it just doesn't deliver very much.
If you like the trappings of a film you might like it because there's a
lot to admire about the production.  Unfortunate, it doesn't include the
script.</P>
