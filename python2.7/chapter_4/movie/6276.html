<P>     LARGER THAN LIFE is an unremarkable road movie with a slight twist 
-- Jack Corcoran's (Bill Murray) traveling companion is an 8000-pound 
elephant named Vera (Tai).  The concept -- Jack has five days to 
transport Vera from the Maryland to California -- isn't loaded with 
promise, but at least the producers had the good sense to hire Bill 
Murray.  Jack is the kind of irritable, self-absorbed guy that Murray 
can play perfectly, and the comedian's presence in LARGER THAN LIFE 
lifts it to a considerably higher level than it might have otherwise 
attained.</P>
<P>     The human-befriends-animal storyline has been worked to death with 
almost every kind of four-legged (or finned) creature imaginable:  dogs, 
cats, whales, dolphins, seals, polar bears, pandas, and so forth.  Now, 
add an elephant to the list.  In most of these films, the spectacle of 
an amazingly well-trained animal is enough to steal the show from his or 
her less-interesting homo sapien partner.  Not here, though.  Murray 
knows how to keep the spotlight on himself, and only yields it when 
absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>     Murray has certainly done better work.  LARGER THAN LIFE can't hold 
a candle to GHOSTBUSTERS or GROUNDHOG DAY, but it's a lot better than 
duds like CADDYSHACK.  Apparently, Murray did his share of ad-libbing 
here, which is probably a reason why several of the comic sequences 
work.  Since Murray is simply "being Murray", there isn't a lot of 
intensive acting going on.  As a result, there are long stretches when 
LARGER THAN LIFE is like watching a standup routine shot on location 
with a very unusual "straight man".  </P>
<P>     The story, such as it is, goes something like this:  Jack, an East 
Coast author and motivational speaker, is bequeathed Vera (and a $30,000 
debt) by his estranged father, a clown with a traveling circus.  Jack 
doesn't want the animal, but the only people willing to take her off his 
hands are in California.  There's Mo (Garofalo), a zookeeper in San 
Diego, who wants to send Vera to Sri Lanka as part of a breeding 
experiment, and Terry (Linda Fiorentino), an animal trainer in L.A., who 
wants to make Vera a movie star.  So, by train, truck, and elephantback, 
Jack heads west, racing against the clock (there's a five-day deadline) 
and encountering the requisite assortment of oddball characters along 
the way.</P>
<P>     The film has an interesting and varied cast, but if you're hoping 
for more than a glimpse of anyone other than Murray or Tai, prepare to 
be disappointed.  No one else, from two of 1996's "hot tickets", Janeane 
Garofalo and Matthew McConaughey (as a truly irritating, off-the-wall 
truck driver), to the likes of Pat Hingle (as an old buddy of Jack's 
father) and Anita Gillette (as Jack's busybody mother), has more than a 
few token appearances.  </P>
<P>     LARGER THAN LIFE doesn't offer anything startlingly new or 
original, although the best gags are worth at least a chuckle.  The film 
opens with Murray mercilessly lampooning self-help and motivational 
speaking by delivering a buzzword-rich speech at an upholstery 
convention that culminates in the building of a human pyramid out of 
attendees.  For those who enjoy physical comedy, there's an amusing bit 
where Jack attempts to mount Vera. ("Okay.  Where's the ladder?")  For 
movie aficionados, there's a sendup of SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, with 
Murray dressed up like John Wayne, Tai playing the role of Wayne's 
trusty steed, and the theme from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN in the 
background.  There are also the obligatory "fish out of water" scenes:  
the elephant walking down a street in a suburban neighborhood, the 
elephant running through an airport, and the elephant outside a roadside 
diner.</P>
<P>     LARGER THAN LIFE isn't likely to be around for long.  Unless it 
does unexpectedly well at the box office, it will be swamped by the 
impending, major fall releases.  It's a reasonably innocuous film, and, 
partly as a result, it's suitable for children.  This isn't my notion of 
top-notch entertainment, but there are worse ways to spend money at a 
movie theater.</P>
