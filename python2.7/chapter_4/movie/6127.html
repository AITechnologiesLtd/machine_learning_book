<P>     There's something very comfortable about reviewing a Steven Seagal 
film.  Except for the odd aberration (UNDER SIEGE), all of his movies 
have been pretty bad.  And there's the similarity aspect to consider -- 
Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most of the plot lines 
and action sequences.  Regardless of whether he's masquerading as a 
ship's cook, a fire fighter, or an LA cop wearing love beads, Seagal is 
always Seagal, which is exactly what his fans want.  In fact, the 
sameness of these films is such that, if I wanted to, I could take an 
old review, change the names, and have a reasonably accurate take on the 
new movie.  Not that I'd ever really do that...</P>
<P>     There is a certain, undeniable entertainment value in watching the 
exaggerated Seagal-kicks-butt scenes.  However, after a few cracked 
skulls, broken bones, and near emasculations, that type of fun starts 
getting dull.  It always amazes me how tough villains are in these 
movies.  It takes at least a dozen vicious blows to the head before 
Seagal finally topples an enemy in THE GLIMMER MAN.  Actually, my 
favorite scene doesn't involve a one-on-one confrontation.  It occurs 
during a particularly nasty car crash.  Once the vehicle has flipped 
over, but is still moving, Seagal (who isn't wearing a seatbelt) escapes 
through the smashed back window, then gets up and starts running away.  
It's a moment that Superman would envy.</P>
<P>     Seagal plays Jack Cole, a homicide detective with a mysterious past 
and a penchant for wearing love beads (they're an unsuccessful reminder 
that violence is against his religion).  As it turns out, he was once a 
special operative for the U.S. government.  In his capacity as a trained 
assassin, he was known as "The Glimmer Man" -- as in, you see a glimmer 
of him, then you're dead.  Now, Cole's past has come back to haunt him 
while he's tracking a serial killer.  A wealthy businessman, Frank 
Deverell (Bob Gunton), has teamed with Cole's former boss, Mr. Smith 
(Brian Cox), and, together, these two are planning an illegal chemical 
weapons deal that will make them very rich.  Meanwhile, Cole has to 
convince his new partner, Jim Campbell (Keenan Ivory Wayans), that he's 
not nuts when he starts talking about high level conspiracies involving 
the Russian mob.</P>
<P>     The buddy angle is the only remotely new twist for a Seagal movie.  
For short stretches, Keenan Ivory Wayans is a useful antidote to 
Seagal's blandness (although I swear I saw the notoriously stone-faced 
star change expression once or twice during this film), but it never 
lasts very long.  All of the intentional humor goes to Wayans, including 
at least one line that's very funny.  (I won't mention it here -- if 
you're unfortunate enough to see THE GLIMMER MAN, I wouldn't want to 
ruin the best part.)  There's also a gag regarding Campbell's crying 
during CASABLANCA that, while juvenile, is nevertheless amusing.</P>
<P>     There are more pyrotechnics in THE GLIMMER MAN than in any non-
UNDER SIEGE Seagal outing.  Everything seems to be exploding.  And, in 
addition to all the shootouts and martial arts battles, there's even 
time for a gadget or two, including a lethal credit card that functions 
like a Ginsu knife.  (Anyone know where I can get one of those?)  All-
in-all, what we have here is "classic" Seagal.  And that means, for 
anyone who isn't an admitted fan, an uninspired outing.  As a result, 
perhaps this review is redundant.  After all, how many different takes 
can there be on a Seagal movie unless (gasp!) it somehow manages to be 
good.  </P>
