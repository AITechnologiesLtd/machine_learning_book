<PRE>Doing Time On Maple Drive (1992)</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Bibi Besch, William McNamara, Jim Carrey, Lori Loughlin
Director: Ken Olin
Screenplay: James Duff</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Donlee Brussel</PRE>
<P>What do you say about a film about parents who desperately want their
children to be perfect, so much so that it brings one of them to almost
committing suicide?  A movie about skeletons that come out of the
closet ever so gracefully, it's shocking?  Ken Olin and James Duff have
collaborated to create one of the most involving family dramas of our
time.</P>
<P>Each character in "Doing Time On Maple Drive" is given just enough time
to develop to make us care.  The family is made up of the parents and
their children, two sons and a daughter.  This, not "The Truman Show"
was Jim Carrey's first dramatic performance and definitely one of his
best.  He gives an extremely intriguing portrayal as Tim, the oldest
son, a high school drop out and an alcoholic.  Every scene Carrey's in,
he steals.  It came as a surprise to me when I noticed he wasn't handed
an Emmy nomination for this role.</P>
<P>William McNamara is impressive as the gay son who has to be perfect.
There's a monologue he delivers towards the end of the film that is
just heartbreaking.  The other characters also throw in intense
performances but the spotlight is on Carrey and McNamara.  See the film
for their veteran work, everything else is just icing on the cake.  Who
knew Lifetime TV-movies could be this good?</P>
