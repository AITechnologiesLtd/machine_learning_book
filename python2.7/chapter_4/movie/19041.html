<P>   You'd need an awful lot of fingers and toes to count the
number of times that movie villains are thwarted by
explaining their motives.  In the James Bond series, the
typical miscreant might say, "Welcome, Mr. Bond. 
In a few moments you will be propelled to your fiery end.  Try
to avoid the heat and a pleasant journey to you." Minutes
later, 007 frees himself and gets the drop on the scoundrel. 
In "The Mummy," the title character might have plunged his
knife immediately into the heart of Evelyn the librarian but
takes the time to announce his motives, giving O'Connell the
opportunity to send him back to his sarcophagus.  Even in
the delightful children's movie "Shiloh 2," Judd, a lonely,
unloved drunk, announces, "You haven't heard the last of
me, Ray Preston," giving the congenial dad all the warning he
needs to keep his distance from the rascal.  Far scarier is the
psychopath who kills without warning, without giving the
victim the slightest chance to talk him out of his deed, to get
help, to get the drop.  No wonder, then, that David Berkowitz,
the so-called son-of-Sam killer, terrorized entire
neighborhoods in New York City's outer boroughs in 1977.
He simply walked up to his victims and shot them.
Ultimately Berkowitz, whose deeds conferred on a man the
title of serial killer for the first time, gave himself away just
like the knaves in the movies--by taunting the good guys and
ultimately by a careless mistake that led to his capture. 
Before his apprehension, though, his random, unproclaimed
acts of mayhem forced people to barricade themselves into
their homes at night, even driving some women to dye their
hair blonde to appease the killer, whose insistent target was
brunettes.</P>
<P>   The son of Sam's executions have a somewhat different
effect on a group of 20-something Italian Americans living in
an ethnic ghetto in the Bronx.  This band of alienated young
people do not display the usual signs of anxiety.  Not for
them the locking down, the defensive barricading so
favored by potential victims.  Displaying some of the same
macho traits of hatred as the killer himself, the pack of largely
racist, homophobic toughs use the apprehension of the
community as an excuse to trounce and intimidate those
they loath.  They direct their aggression
particularly against a despairing punk rocker, who has just
been thrown out of his apartment by his parents (in the film's
most comic moment), and who makes extra money turning
tricks and acting in porno flicks.  Building up a specious case
against him like a modern band of holy inquisitors, they vent
their spleen against the innocent but flawed young man in
much the way that Berkowitz releases his frustration through
multiple murders.</P>
<P>   Director and co-writer Spike Lee, a frequent critic of
Hollywood's attitude toward black filmmakers--who is known
for his credo that only blacks should direct movies about
African-Americans--veers off in an unusual direction with the
making of "Summer of Sam."  His first film without a single
major black character, "Sam" proves that you don't have to
be a white director to make a compelling movie about white
people.  Though an occasional racist epithet receives voice in
this film, the black experience is strictly in the background,
giving Lee the opportunity to hone in primarily on Italian-
Americans--a group toward which he had shown particular
interest in his "Jungle Fever"--about the sexual relationship
between an African-American man and an Italian-American
woman.  Reminiscent of Lee's 1989 look at Brooklyn's
leading black community in "Do the Right Thing"--wherein the
forty-two-year old director took a close look at individuals
amid a racial incident involving Italian-American pizza
vendors--"Sam" is more a collage of events than a unified
drama.  Its disjointed nature is likely, more than any other
factor, to generate some negative reviews and
less-than-enthusiastic audience response.  But Lee is so
entertaining in his mixture of comedy, domestic strife and
police drama that for the most part his discontinuous
production works.  Moving along briskly enough and more
than occasionally highlighting the torments of dysfunctional
people, "Summer of Sam" succeeds in furnishing a period's
pain to the screen, a time in New York that tempers were on
edge from the hundred-plus degree heat, a blackout that
brought devastation to local neighborhoods and the
apprehension wrought by a menacing psychopathic killer.</P>
<P>   The story begins on a promising note.  In place of the
usual long array of credits, Lee puts tough-talking journalist
and author Jimmy Breslin in the forefront, as the steetwise
reporter ticks off an introduction to a time more dangerous
than the present in the city that he knows, loves, and hates
so well. After briefly introducing a ragtag bunch of
ne'er-do-wells, Breslin puts the spotlight on Vinny (John
Leguizamo) and his slinky wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino). Disco
and punk are au courant in 1977, and womanizing is in
fashion as ever.  The perpetually horny Vinny is so
compulsive in his sexuality that at one point he excuses
himself from his wife on the dance floor to grab what he can
from a neighborhood bimbo in his car.  During this year,
Ritchie (Adrien Brody), a friend of Vinny, gives in to
the punk style--adding spikes to his hair style, effecting a
Cockney accent, and taking up with Ruby (Jennifer Esposito)
while making some extra money dancing in a low-life gay bar.</P>
<P>   "Summer of Sam" does best when Lee focuses on the daily
rounds of his pitiful group of toughs, subtly indicating the
loneliness and poverty of imagination that inform their lives. 
When they hang out, they don't discuss the latest trends on
Broadway, the state of the movies, or the quality of their
careers.  Their batteries are charged only when they
exchange wholly unproved conspiracy theories and
particularly when they gang up, intimidate, and beat those
who do not look, act, or talk like them.  Far from feeling
genuine fear of the serial killer, they are invigorated by
accounts of his horrific deeds. Berkowitz's killings give the
gang all the justification they need to carry out a campaign of
villification against those who do not fit in with their life-styles. 
By contrast, the director is least effective in showing
Berkowitz himself.  As played by Michael Badalucco--who
resembles the real-life killer only in his ample weight--
Berkowitz is seen almost literally climbing the walls of his
seedy apartment, bouncing on his bed with rage while he is
under the influence of a big black dog who apparently urges
him to kill.  (Appropriately enough, Berkowitz believes that the
name of this satanic dog is Harvey.) The film does not paint a
convincing portrait of the police, who are guided by Luigi (Ben
Gazarra),  going all-out to capture the elusive slayer.  Lee
seems almost to be telling us to ignore the details of son of
Sam's killings in order to focus almost wholly on the gang. 
Lee's portrayal of the relationship between Vinny and Dionna
and on the tortured psyche of Ritchie easily form the story's
most compelling segments.  John Leguizamo, known by
cognoscenti mainly for his comic roles in the stage
monologues "Freak" and "Spic-O-Rama" is equally effective
in his dramatic capacity here, keeping the sparks flying in his
link with his wife, played by Mira Sorvino--who never looked
more provocative.  Sorvino has her audience hissing each
time she forgives her husband's trespasses, ultimately
cheering when she gives up on the hopeless creep.  Adrien
Brody's portrayal of Ritchie again demonstrates this young
actor's depths, heretofore on best display in his starring role
in "Ten Benny." </P>
<P>   Whether this artistic accomplishment will translate well at
the box office remains to be seen.  The film is thoroughly
urban, bound to grip the enthusiasm of big-city dwellers
everywhere, while at the same time likely to convince
conflicted suburbanites that perhaps they did the right thing
by moving out.  "Summer of Sam" is about as subtle as
Jimmy Breslin.  With loud music and upfront posturing, it
makes for an entertaining, powerful experience at the movies.</P>
