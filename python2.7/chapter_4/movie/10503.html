"Jackie Brown" Doesn't Exactly Shoot-em Up
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Many times when I watch a movie, I'm very interested in knowing what's
going through the minds of the characters up there on the movie
screen.  What makes them tick?  What motivates them?  What makes them
do the things that they do?  Character development is one of the key
ingredients to a good movie when, after sitting through a 2-hour
movie, we finally get to the payoff.  Hopefully, everything will wind
down to a congruously satisfying ending.</P>
<P>Gangsters and hoodlums are an interesting breed.  What fuels their
day?  Is it the money?  Is it loyalty among the underworld?  Is it the
power that comes from sidestepping the laws that are in place?  The
strength of "Jackie Brown" lies within it's writing (thanks to Quentin
Tarantino), in which an in-depth exploration of the minds of several
twisted low-lifes are examined.  Early on, we meet up with the woman
from the title of the movie (Pam Grier), and learn that she transports
dirty money between the US and Mexico for her gun-running boss, Ordell
Robbi (Samuel L. Jackson).  Robbi seems to be the typical crook who
makes his living selling guns to the highest bidder, with the possible
exception that he's an intelligent thinker, is verbally eloquent, and
is consumed with his personal safety.  For example, if one of his
associates is arrested, he rationalizes that his associate must be
killed to ensure his freedom.</P>
<P>Robbi's world is truly chaotic, and skeptically relies on his
dim-witted, right-hand man, Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), and a trio of
women (including Bridget Fonda as a bitchy, opiate-addicted surfer
girl) whose places he uses as hideouts.  His true friend, however, is
only himself, and Jackie Brown knows that.  So, she works on a plan,
with the help of her bail bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to
find a way to stay ahead of the police that want to keep her in jail
and to stay ahead of Robbi, who would feel better if she were dead.
These are all smart people, and it will be the smartest one among them
all that will emerge victorious.  Add in $500,000 of dirty money
that's up for grabs and an intense effort to outmaneuver each other,
and the result should wind down to a congruously satisfying ending,
right?  Well...</P>
<P>This movie is rich with character development.  We see Jackie's cool
and collective nature.  Displaying toughness and poise, Grier
successfully carries the movie through it's various twists and turns.
We understand Max Cherry's involvement and attraction for Jackie.  And
we see the ineptitude of Robbi's situation, who is basically a
short-tempered captain of a ship of fools.  I especially liked Bridget
Fonda, who, despite her character's lassitude, seemed to be the
smartest of the bunch.  Indeed, we are treated to some nicely shot
scenes filled with witty banter in a cloak and dagger atmosphere.  But
what we don't get is the great payoff that makes us say "I'm glad that
I sat through that 160-minute movie."  Eventually, the slow pace
killed the sense of urgency, which I felt should have been the reward,
at least for this particular critic.  </P>
<P>Yet, I want to applaud Tarentino's texturally rich adaptation of
Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch.  He has a good eye behind the camera
and proves that he has an uncanny capability to engross us with odd
chatter in bizarre situations.  "Jackie Brown" certainly had some of
the intoxicating effects of rum, but ultimately lacked the punch.</P>
