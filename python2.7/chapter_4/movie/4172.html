<PRE>                              FAR AWAY SO CLOSE
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lon Ponschock</PRE>

     Willem Dafoe, and Solveig Dommartin
146 mins.</P>
<PRE>                             "You, you whom we love
                              you do not see us
                              You do not hear us
                              You imagine us
                              in the far distance
                              yet we are so near.</PRE>
<PRE>                           -- from FAR AWAY, SO CLOSE --</PRE>
<P>     The signature quotation you see at the bottom of these pieces is
from another Wim Wenders film: UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD.  And his
PARIS TEXAS is another extraordinary piece of filmmaking and look at
life.  In WINGS OF DESIRE and FAR AWAY SO CLOSE Wenders explores the
lives of Angels.  Angels are quite popular these days.  There are scads
of books on the subject.</P>
<P>     From the first frames of FAR AWAY SO CLOSE, a film which
was the grand prize winner at Cannes in 1993, I was enthralled with its
approach.</P>
<P>     Cassiel (Otto Sander) becomes human when he cannot bear to see a
child die needlessly and his adventure as a human begins.  Funny thing
is that as you watch and listen to him with his fears and isolation he
actually speaks from our own hearts.  This is my take on it anyway.</P>
<PRE>              "They say time is money, but they're
               wrong Karl.  Time is the *absence* of money."</PRE>
<P>     FAR AWAY features an all-star cast.  Lou Reed and Peter Falk have
cameo roles.  Solveig Dommartin I remember from UNTIL THE END OF THE
WORLD and she is wonderful once again in this work.  Nastassja Kinski
is Raphaela, a companion angel and Bruno Ganz plays Damiel. Damiel's
story is told in WINGS of DESIRE.  Willem Dafoe is ... what? a devil?
a bad angel ... something that wants to see the new 'Karl Engel'
destroyed?  Even after the film I am uncertain.</P>
<P>     The camera work in FAR AWAY is extraordinary in that it
accomplishes so much with so little.  This is not a big budget film.
Wenders can get away with merely suggesting all that an angel is with
the camera and a few simple props.</P>
<PRE>     And I believed it.</PRE>
<P>     There is great humor in the film as well.  And the story is a
complex one of a long search and finally a rescue.</P>
<P>     With its companion piece, WINGS OF DESIRE, FAR AWAY SO CLOSE
presents us with images that refresh the spirit and strengthen our
hopes in the future.  That's what the little signature file which
closes these pieces is about.</P>
<PRE>"We are messengers
 who bring closeness
 to those who are distant.
 We are messengers
 who bring the light
 to those who are in darkness.
 We are messengers
 who bring the word
 to those who question.
 We are neither the light nor the message
 We are the messengers
 We are nothing.
 You are for us ... everything.</PRE>
