<PRE>TOMORROW NEVER DIES</PRE>
<P>Stars Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Teri Hatcher and Michelle Yeoh.</P>
<PRE>Directed By Roger Spottiswoode</PRE>
<P>So we come to Bonds 18th Adventure, the rather stupidly titled ‘Tomorrow
Never Dies' Sadly, the plot of the film is as stupid as the title,
involving a media tycoon and China.</P>
<P>Pryce plays the tycoon, who plans to start a war between China and Britain
so he can have broadcast rights in China (The plot is explained better in
the film.) As you can, it's a terrible idea for a story. Maybe
it's the scriptwriter, who was fired from the production and then brought
back again, exacting his revenge.</P>
<P>Anyway, James Bond (Brosnan) is called in to stop the tycoon, and a few
explosions occur, Bond sleeps around with two women (Pryce's wife, played
by Hatcher, and some language instructor at the start) and the tycoons plan
is thwarted, and the tycoon got rid of. There is also the usual one liners,
to make all the
deaths seem funny. It's just a typical action film, but with Bond instead
of Stallone, or Bruce Willis. Andthat's the problem with the film. It's all
been seen before. Like Con Air, everything in the film is just rehashed
from a million other action films and Bond films. There's the usual
helicopter chase, loads of car
chases, but nothing really different. After a while, it just gets tedious.
In it's defence, some of the action scenes are mildly exciting, but nothing
majorly different occurs. This isn't a major flaw really, but it just makes
the film a bit boring. </P>
<P>Add the lack of originality and some silly continuity errors, plus a rather
weak performance from Pryce,and this is a disappointing Bond adventure.
After the entertaining and silly Goldeneye, Brosnan second film is silly….
and that's all. Overall, then, this film is disappointing. If Bond films
are going to carry on
like this, perhaps the Bond franchise should be laid to rest.</P>
<PRE>Overall= ** out of *****</PRE>
