<PRE>                             I LOVE TROUBLE
                       A film review by Cindy Bale
                        Copyright 1994 Cindy Bale</PRE>
<P>Starring Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte.</P>
<P>     I tried hard not like this movie without succeeding.  It contains
parts of BRINGING UP BABY, any Hepburn/Tracy film, part of the plot of
WAR GAMES, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in HIS GIRL FRIDAY, elevator
shaft action, train action, and murder.  It is cute, funny, suspenseful
(a little bit), sexy (a little bit).  One of the bad guys was a
surprise.  The pace is fast enough, there are some "action" scenes.  I
think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with
older kids who have already seen MAVERICK.</P>
<P>     Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte are fine separately and together.  I
really identified with the Julia Roberts character (wishful thinking, I
know!), but I do have better hair!  Her hair, a very dull dark brown,
has no color.  She could use some highlights.   They both do fine with
their roles:  he's a bored columnist with the Chicago Chronicle and
she's a hotshot "cub" reporter with the Chicago Globe.  They have great
fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this
movie.  I like the one story focus.</P>
<P>     Other actors include Charles Martin Smith as Roberts' boss,
Olympia Dukakis as Nolte's coworker, Nora Dunn also with the Chronicle,
and Marsha Mason as a congresswoman.</P>
<P>     Basically this movie is reasonably fun.  There is a serious
mystery to solve, and I enjoyed following a fun couple solving the
mystery.  It is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take
themselves seriously.  I do give successful comedy high marks.</P>
<PRE>Rating:  7 out of 10 Parker Pens.</PRE>
