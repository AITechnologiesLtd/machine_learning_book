Susan Granger's review of "EAST IS EAST" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P>Based by Ayub Khan-Din on his semi-autobiographical play, "East
is East" revolves around a large Anglo-Pakistani family living in the
working-class town of Salford, near Manchester, in a small suburban
house which also contains their fish 'n' chips shop. Set in the 1971,
it draws on several societal themes: the inherent cross-cultural
conflict, the sexual revolution of the '60s and, above all, the
patriarch's determination to cling to traditional Pakistani
values. The celebrated Indian actor Om Puri plays George Khan, the
tyrannical, expatriate father who has forced his six sons and one
daughter to learn Urdu and attend the mosque - earning himself the
nickname "Genghis" - with Linda Bassett as his long-suffering
wife. But the kids are rebellious, preferring soccer, discos, pop
culture, and sexual experimentation. The boys certainly don't want to
marry good Muslim girls - in fact, one of them is gay. And, one by
one, the prospective brides are rejected. The only confusing aspect is
why George Khan, given his prejudices, would have married a Catholic
Englishwoman in the first place - and then why he would so try to
hamper their children's assimilation. A first-feature by Irish
director Damien O'Donnell, it's a hilarious, moving comedy,
sidestepping all the usual cliches about mixed-race, mixed-religious
families, culminating in a surprisingly satisfying conclusion. And, if
you enjoy Om Puri, rent the video of "My Son the Fanatic," in which he
plays a married cab-driver with another set of family problems. On the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "East is East" is a subtle,
multi-layered 8. It was a huge hit in Europe, winning many awards
including Best British Film of the Year from the London Film Critics.</P>
