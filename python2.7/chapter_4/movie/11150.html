<PRE>SPICEWORLD, THE MOVIE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>The advertising line on Spice Worlds poster reads: They cant
just sing. Which is news to me  because I never knew they could
sing anyway.</P>
<P>Having now seen their film, my opinion has differed considerably: the
obvious talent they possess in vocals and dance (not to mention their
looks) is what has earned them a position at the top of the music
industry.  Fortunately, acting was never part of the groups forte -
until now</P>
<P>Before the film started I was shocked - shocked I tell you, when I
realized that I had been suckered into a devious scheme to cram as
much advertising as possible into a two hour experience.  First came
the Polaroid Spice Cam, then the Impulse Spice Deodorant, and
when the film began it didnt even stop there.</P>
<P>For what else is Spice World than a movie length endorsement of this
mega popular group?  The soundtrack is from the groups latest album
(of the same name), and after seeing the movie who wouldnt want to
spice up their life? However, spicing up your life means slicing
up your wallet.  Its just a good thing that Spice World is more than
worth its admission price.</P>
<P>The group of five consists of Emma (Baby Spice), Geri (Ginger Spice),
Melanie B (Scary Spice), Victoria (Posh Spice) and Melanie C (Sporty
Spice).  Their clichi characters come through sharp and clear, and
although they are obviously exaggerated to suit the needs of fans and
mammoth commercialism, this is all the more fun.</P>
<P>The film follows the pressure, tension and adventure leading up to the
Spice Girls first live concert ever.  The girls are faced with their
own set of dilemmas, including making time for their pregnant friend
(of which they are the Godmothers of) and avoiding a nasty scheme to
split them up, concocted by a lunatic newspaper owner.  But the
documentary style of this film is almost deceiving - this is by no
means a serious or even accurate account of the girls experiences.</P>
<P>The biggest surprise in stall for viewers is the elements of tame
slapstick humor that Spice World welcomes with open arms, and
occasionally is not unlike what we have seen in films such as Austin
Powers or even Robin Hood: Men in Tights.  But whereas those films
based their entire plot around that kind of humor, Spice World
contains it as an added bonus  so the comedy aspect of this film
wont bore or patronize the audience.  Celebrities Richard E. Grant,
Meatloaf and Roger Moore help the plot move swiftly along its
entertaining ride of comedy and music.  As for the girls themselves;
their performances are naturally not of the highest standard, but
thankfully their acting time is limited and impressive dance/music
scenes occur numerously.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Spice
Girls were perfect characters for a movie ever since the start of
their career - Spice World knows this and often parodies that idea and
the sketchy structuring of the film.</P>
<P>During the movie girls are able to appreciate the music and
exaggerated personalities of their idols whilst the guys will have
more than a good time, as their eyes will no doubt wander across the
screen depending on where the Spice Girls are sitting, crouching or
dancing.</P>
<P>Its somewhat surprising that Spice World turned out to be such a
clever contraption of comedy and song, and whilst the obvious strength
of the movie is its fabulous music scenes, everything shown is sexy,
catchy and great fun for teens of both sexes.</P>
<PRE>3 = stars out of 5
A Spicy World is fine by me</PRE>
