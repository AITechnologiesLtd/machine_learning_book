Sweet November</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>On our way to the screening, we stopped to help a motorist in distress, 
so I ended up being tardy to this film. Therefore you may wish to 
pro-rate its accuracy. </P>
<P>Charlize Theron finds herself a monthly project, rich work-aholic Keanu 
is November. </P>
<P>Keanu frustrated and un-amused by the carefree, spontaneous, potentially 
dangerous Theron reads, "What do you want with me?" </P>
<PRE>Charlize, "I just want to help you." </PRE>
<P>Keanu, "What makes you think I need helping?" </P>
<P>Charlize, "You're in a box. I'll lift the lid." </P>
<P>Keanu sarcastically replies, "Just hearing that makes me feel healed." </P>
<P>I like this script - sort of a "Harold and Maude"-lite. Very well paced, 
and carefully directed except for an abrupt, sorely reworked ending 
scene. Still, soft and bright like the cinematography, the film packs a 
lot of heart. </P>
<P>Charlize is stunning, lovable and professional; Jason Isaacs, awesome; 
little Liam superb; and Keanu, simply terrible. I've heretofore defended 
Keanu from the robust pool of criticism regarding his acting abilities. 
But, his performance in this film is clearly underwhelming. He delivers 
lines as if he'd just awaken from deep slumber and was handed the script 
even before a cup of coffee. Happily (and somewhat amazingly), despite 
the blunt deficiency of acting prowess in this effort, Keanu's resilient 
charm and good looks still command while on screen. </P>
<P>Done well, a crisp free and easy scene in which Charlize romps on the 
beach with a clan of beautifully groomed white show dogs. It's a 
wonderful way to impress upon us the theme, "If you want to enjoy life 
... you've got to risk getting a little sand in your fur." Also of note, 
a short scene in which Keanu returns to his childhood home is accented 
nicely by Tony Bennett's "The other half of me" as a remembrance of 
Keanu's history with his dad. In fact, this is just one of other 
well-selected musical pieces on the soundtrack. Thirdly and fourthly, 
two advertising meetings - one where Keanu introduces the "Hot" dog ad 
campaign with fervor and passion, and the other where Keanu meets with 
the god of advertising. Keanu peaks in both of these masterfully crafted 
scenes. </P>
<P>Warm and cozy dialogue, direction, and apt cast, compensate for Keanu's 
acting shortcomings all the way up to, but not including, the ending 
bridge scene. The timing and pacing of which beats completely off-sync 
with the rest of the picture. Even the direction and editing lag here. 
Nice bridge though. </P>
<P>Would have been an "A-" were Keanu to have acted, but since he didn't, 
would have been a "B+" had the ending sequence been more aptly scripted 
and shot. Still I enjoyed what I enjoyed and will remember the sparkling 
zest for life and the strong heart of this picture. </P>
