<P>   Whatever happened to those seedy old black-and-white
war movies that came out during World War 2?  As a little kid
who was way too young to fight during the early 1940s I used
to love going to the neighborhood theater for a double feature
of high-action heroics, to cheer on each time an American
plane knocked out a "zero" and to laugh at the Japanese--all
portrayed as cartoonish characters in their round glasses who
had one word vocabularies: "Bonzai! Bonzai!"   My friends
and I were practically babies when we took in the dauntless
deeds of our fighting men, and we were not about to believe
that real people were over there getting maimed and killed
nor did we have much interest in the geopolitics.  There was
virtually no character development, but who cared?</P>
<P>   For all its wonderful battle scenes, not even Steven
Spielberg's masterly "Saving Private Ryan" examined
character all that much, though it did explore the rationale
behind risking eight lives to free one surviving family member
from the dangers on the front.  "The Thin Red Line" is
another story.  When Terrence Malick, who helmed
"Badlands" in 1973 (a moody thriller inspired by the
Starkweather-Fugate killing spree in the 50s) and "Days of
Heaven" in 1978 (yet another mood-piece, visually beautiful,
about a love triangle) came back to direct his first movie in
twenty years, he must have connected with something.  His
notice must have been held by the opportunity to address a
story with a moody ambiance similar to what he built in his
previous films.</P>
<P>   "The Thin Red Line" is his version of the sprawling epic of
action on one island, Guadalcanal, during World War II. 
Freely tossing in phrases from James Jones's 1962 novel, he
sees the action from the point of view of the narrator, Private
Witt (James Caviezel), who went AWOL from his unit several
times to share his life with the Melanesian natives in the
Solomon Islands chain.  We learn early on that the island is
of strategic importance to the Japanese because it could
provide them with access to Australia and to the sea lanes to
America.  With Japanese entrenched on a part of the island,
on which they have already built an airstrip, the American
forces were given the mission of dislodging them and taking
control of Guadalcanal.</P>
<P>   Cinematogapher John Toll has done an amazing job of
capturing the raw natural beauty of the terrain of Queensland,
Australia, which was the site of much of the filming--though a
part of the photography takes place on location in
Guadalcanal.  The gorgeous topography is the home of a
variety of exquisitely colored birds and mammals of various
ilks, including some spooky-looking bats and scary alligators--
who enjoy the perpetually bright, sunny days as much as the
local people.  Toll captures the peaceful lives of the
indigenous clans, whose youngsters play calmly on the beach
and never fight the way westerners are wont to do.  In only
one case do we see the adults squabble, though they appear
leery of the Americans at first, neither welcoming them as
liberators nor expressing any hostility toward them.  </P>
<P>   Beauty aside, the real purpose of the film is to capture the
meditations of some of the fighting men, principally those of
Private Witt and of Private Bell (Ben Chaplin), the latter
frequently contemplating the far more pleasant times when he
is making love with his fetching wife back home.  When the
principals are not meditating, they are philosophizing verbally,
trading viewpoints and acting out their convictions in the way
they command the men.  Chief among the views are those of
Private Witt, who, examining the peaceful vistas provided by
nature, wonders what propels men to war.  He is answered
by Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) who sees instead that the vines
wrap themselves around one another as though on a mission
to choke the life out of the shrubbery.  Sgt. Welsh (Sean
Penn) comes out with his belief that "there's no world but this
one," that we should simply accept our assignments and
duties and go on living as best we can with our obligations.</P>
<P>   The assaults by the Japanese are enacted realistically, the
chief action being an attmept by the Americans to dislodge a
machine-gun nest which is taking all too many lives.  There
are moments of high tension within the U.S. unit, particularly
when Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) directly refuses an order
by Col. Tall to take a hill even while Tall knows the capture
would involve the loss of many men.  </P>
<P>   Despite the National Geographic-style beauty throughout
and some credible if not overly striking battle scenes, "The
Thin Red Line" depends too much on its narrative, a series of
reflections and philosophic attitudes that would be better
absorbed and appreciated on James Jones's pages than on
Terrence Malick's staging.   Malick has utilized the names of
a great many major performers--John Travolta, Woody
Harrelson, George Clooney, John Cusack--in cameos that are
so brief we can't help thinking he employed these men only
for their value on the theater marquees.  Their roles could
easily have been assumed by extras and, in fact, one of the
less-known performers in this movie, James Caviezel, is so
convincing (and handsome) that we wonder how some of the
more alpha males from Hollywood were able to swallow up
such superior thesps.  If "The Thin Red Line" did not open in
a year that included Steven Spielberg's magnum opus on
World War II, it would deserve more serious attention by the
Academy.  While it remains a powerful work with the
signature moodiness or its director, its chief asset is that it
may encourage us to reach for the novel.</P>
