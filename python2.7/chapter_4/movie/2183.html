<P>When I was a child, one of the reasons I enjoyed the Christmas season so 
much was because of the annual arrival of those endlessly-repeated 
television specials:  RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER, SANTA CLAUS IS 
COMING TO TOWN, THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  Tim Burton must remember 
those programs too, because in his own inimitable way, he has paid homage 
to them in this most twisted of holiday fairy tales, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS.</P>
<P>The scene is Halloween Town where, not surprisingly, October 31 is the 
biggest night of the year.  However, after arranging and carrying out his 
most devilish Halloween yet, Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon 
when speaking, Danny Elfman when singing) is suffering the post-holiday 
blues.  He craves something different in his life, something that can't 
be found in Halloween Town.  Wandering out in a forest, he discovers 
gateways to different holidays, and finds his way to Christmas Town.  
There, he is captivated by the lights, the festivity, and the joy.  He 
returns home to tell everyone that this year, Halloween Town is going to 
celebrate Christmas.  To make things complete, he, Jack Skellington, will 
replace "Sandy Claws" on his yearly December 31 ride, delivering presents 
and spreading good cheer.  Everyone is enthused by the idea except Sally 
(voiced by Catherine O'Hara), who has a premonition of doom if Jack goes 
through with his plans.</P>
<P>THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is a visual splendor.  Done on the cheap, 
this could have been a gimmicky, unsatisfying motion picture, but 
considering the obvious time and effort put into constructing the movie, 
it is an unqualified success.  Everything moves smoothly and naturally, 
and the attention to detail is exquisite.  We are given a clever cast of 
characters that look like something from Edward Gorey's sketchbook in a 
setting that oozes atmosphere.  It is not difficult at all to become 
wrapped up in this movie.</P>
<P>The film is designed to be suitable for all but the youngest children, 
some of whom might be frightened by any of the bizarre inhabitants of 
Halloween Town (you know your childrens' natures and whether animated 
ghouls and goblins will terrify them or not).  On its surface, the story 
has little more complexity than THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS, so 
younger viewers will be able to enjoy the movie without feeling lost or 
bored.  However, as is too rarely the case with family films, there is 
another level to this film.  Much of the wryest humor is designed for 
adults.</P>
<P>Even those who aren't taken in by the charming-yet-simple story or the 
likable characters, will be enthralled by the world Tim Burton and 
director Henry Selick have created.  It is, quite frankly, an amazing 
achievement, and one that we are not likely to see repeated for a long 
time.  </P>
<P>THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS thrown 
into reverse (although clearly the Dr. Seuss tale had a part in 
formulating some of the images of Christmas Town).  While the Grinch made 
Christmas better by trying to destroy it, Jack Skellington ruins the 
holiday by trying to improve it.  But don't worry - everything turns out 
all right in the end.  This is, remember, a family film.</P>
<P>The biggest failing of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, and it shouldn't 
be overlooked, is the weakness of Danny Elfman's songs.  With the 
exception of one or two, these are uniformly lifeless, and there are 
times when the movie might have been better without them.  Something a 
little more energetic is called for.  Elfman's score is more than 
adequate, but the songs are lacking.</P>
<P>Caroline Thompson, Tim Burton, and Danny Elfman have worked together 
before, and they appear have a good rapport when it comes to the unusual 
(the trio were all involved in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS).  Each of them has 
invested a part of themselves in THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, even as 
has Henry Selick, coordinator of the stop-motion animation.  </P>
<P>THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS has something to offer just about 
everyone.  For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays.  For 
the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment 
while marvelling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques.  
There are songs (even if they aren't nearly as noteworthy as they should 
be), laughs, and a little romance.  In short, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS does what it intends to do:  entertain.</P>
