<PRE>                                    RANSOM
                       A film review by Christopher Heyn
                        Copyright 1996 Christopher Heyn</PRE>
<PRE>Rating (out of *****)  ***</PRE>
<P>Ransom has already received rave reviews, and is certain to be one of
the highest-grossing films of the fall season.  It may even be
nominated for a number of Academy awards.  Nevertheless, all the praise
heaped upon Ron Howard's latest effort is due not to Ransom's
brilliance, but to the noticeable lack of quality thrillers that have
been released in the last few years.  Despite the film's solid acting
and high production values, Ransom suffers from weak scripting that
sabotages what is otherwise an involving scenario.  In a word, Ransom
is overrated.</P>
<P>Ransom contains the same problems that plague all of Ron Howard's
pictures (yes, even Apollo 13), in that the film certainly isn't bad,
but it's nothing great, either.  However, Ransom does feature some of
the best directing of Howard's career, and Howard has overcome his
tendency to make a "nice" film.  Ransom is quite bloody and violent,
and does not shirk away from the unpleasantness of its subject matter. 
Ransom also features some great acting (most notably Mel Gibson and
Gary Sinise), and the film wastes no time jumping into the story. 
However, despite all these positive elements, Ransom has some serious
plot and character weaknesses that leave one asking a lot of questions
after the film is over.</P>
<P>The film's biggest flaw is the weak motivation of its antagonist, Jerry
Shaker (Gary Sinise).  A police detective who uses his experience to
mastermind what seems to be an airtight scheme to squeeze $2 million
out of the high-powered airline entrepreneur Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson),
Shaker's character motivation is never fully explained.  </P>
<P>At first, it seems Shaker is only after the money.  If so, why?  Is it
because he is deeply in debt to mob figures?  Because he and his
girlfriend/co-conspirator (played by Lily Taylor) plan to escape to a
desert island for the rest of their lives?  Who knows?  That issue is
never even touched upon.  Then when Mullen turns the tables on Shaker,
offering $4 million as a reward for his capture, dead or alive,
Shaker's determination to hold onto Mullen's boy indicates a personal
vendetta.  Mullen says so himself later in the film.  The audience is
then left waiting for Shaker's explanation as to why he would risk an
otherwise successful police career over such a high-profile stunt. 
This explanation never comes.</P>
<P>If Shaker's motivation *is* personal, then why doesn't he go ahead and
kill Mullen's son once it is clear that Shaker will never get the money
he seeks?  Best to realize it's a botched affair, kill the boy, and
call it a day.  When it looks like Shaker and his three co-conspirators
are going to be discovered, Shaker hides behind his badge, killing all
three of them in a shootout, claiming later to have acted in
self-defense.  Questions linger, but Shaker is nevertheless a hero, and
soon after goes to Mullen's home to collect the $4 million.  However,
when he does, he's armed with not one, but two handguns.  If all Shaker
wanted was the money to begin with, why doesn't he just play the hero
role, take the check and deal with any fallout later... even leaving
the country if the investigation of the case comes crashing down on
him?  Instead, Shaker risks killing a celebrity executive just when
media attention on the case is at its highest.  This would certainly
indicate Shaker's motivation is a personal one.  But again, we never
learn what it is.</P>
<P>What's most disappointing about Ransom is that with just one scene or a
few well-placed lines, this script flaw could have been easily
resolved.  </P>
<P>Another flaw in the movie is a result of director Howard lapsing back
into "nice" mode at the most inopportune time.  When Shaker is on the
phone with Mullen, threatening to kill his son, Mullen calls his bluff.
 Immediately, Shaker kills Mullen's son.  Quickly, Howard reveals to
the audience that no, Shaker just shot the gun in the son's direction,
but did not kill him.  Meanwhile, Gibson and his wife (Rene Russo) are
weeping out on the balcony over the "death" of their son.  As the
audience, we know their grief is misplaced, so the scene has no impact
whatsoever.  Up to this point in the film, we wonder whether Mullen
plays things too fast and loose, especially when lives are involved. 
If we also believed that Mullen's son was dead, it would give credence
to those of us that disagreed with Mullen's risky decision.  Instead,
Howard fumbles a potentially cathartic moment in the film.</P>
<P>One could continue on, giving examples of other logical plot flaws, but
that would belabor the point.  Ransom has its heart in the right place,
and the high emotional pitch of the film is what audiences will respond
to.  However, those of us who expect a film to not only emotionally
move us, but intellectually engage us, will come away from Ransom
disappointed.  It's unfortunate that the state of the modern thriller
is so poor that Ransom is considered brilliant by comparison.  One
longs for the return of Alfred Hitchcock.</P>
<P><HR>***** = A brilliantly realized picture; a masterpiece
****  = An excellent film; one of the best of the year
***   = Not perfect, but a good film for its genre
**    = Disappointing on a number of levels
*     = A turkey; a film to be avoided</P>
