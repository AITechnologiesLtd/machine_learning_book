<PRE>IMMORTAL BELOVED (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) is one of the greatest
composers who ever lived, and his work is able to inspire
people centuries after his death. At two fine examples of
this could be found in the world of cinema - A CLOCKWORK
ORANGE and DIE HARD are impossible to imagine without
Beethoven's music. The private life of the great composer
was perhaps less impressive than his work, but Beethoven's
biography was interesting enough to become subject of many
films. The latest of those films is IMMORTAL BELOVED, 1994
biopic written and directed by British filmmaker Bernard
Rose.</P>
<P>The film begins with Beethoven (played by Gary Oldman) dying
in 1827. His young secretary and friend Anton Schindler
(played by Jeroen Krabbe) digs through his papers and finds
the will in which he leaves everything to the mysterious
woman refered only as "Immortal Beloved". Schindler is
determined to establish the identity of said woman so he
starts travelling all across Europe in search of people who
might be the key to this mystery. Among them are Beethoven's
past lovers -Giulietta Guicciardi (played by Valeria Golino)
and Anna Marie Erdody (played by Isabella Rossellini) - and
through their stories Schindler starts to make a picture of
a great artist, haunted by childhood traumas, deafness and
long-time feuds with his own family, including sister-in-law
Johanna Reiss (played by Johanna ter Steege) with whom
Beethoven fought for the custody of her young son Karl
(played by Marco Hofschneider).</P>
<P>Rose decided to depict Beethoven's life using the story
device similar to Welles' CITIZEN KANE - present the
character through bits and pieces of other peoples' memory.
Unfortunately, the jigsaw puzzle was simply not worthy of
the effort - according to Rose, the most important thing
about great composer's life was not his music but his love
life. Because of that, IMMORTAL BELOVED looks less an
ambitious biopic and more like a cheap melodrama. To make
things even worse, Rose took too many liberties not only
with Beethoven's life, but also with the broader historical
events, including Beethoven's infatuation with Napoleon and
French invasion of Austria - the events that were as
thraumatic to 19th Century Viennese as WTC bombing was to
early 21st Century New Yorkers. Because of that, the ending
is completely non-cathartic and the whole story is rather
unengaging. What saves this film from complete failure are
two things. One is the scene that tries to show where and
how Beethoven found inspiration for his 9th Symphony. The
other is excellent performance by Gary Oldman, who again
utilises his raw energy to play a madman, although this time
madness manifests itself in art rather than homicidal acts.
Unfortunately, Oldman's performance is not matched by his
colleagues, and he can't save IMMORTAL BELOVED from ending
like a big disappointment.</P>
