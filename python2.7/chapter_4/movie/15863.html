<PRE>                             THE SIEGE 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                 2 out of 4 for marshal law in the city</PRE>
<P>Cast: Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, Tony Shalhoub,
Sami Bouajila.
Screenplay: Lawrence Wright and Menno Meyjes & Edward Zwick. Director:
Edward Zwick</P>
<P>In this tedious movie about terrorism and counter terrorism, we have
little to keep us interested throughout the movie except for the
constant berating of Denzel Washington as FBI agent, Anthony Hubbard.
The unconvincing, pretentious, smug role of Bruce Willis as a
questionable, unfeeling General or the silly, unintelligent part of
Annette Benning as CIA agent Elise Kraft who makes one too many wrong
calls, does not make this movie any better. When there are too many
security agencies involved in any single plot, one runs the risk of
spoiling the broth – and the result is this movie suffers from too many
people trying to get in on the act.</P>
<P>The Siege makes a point at the end about the misuse of power, and the
abuse of human rights when a city is placed under marshal law. However,
I feel the only thing this movie promotes is fear in people's heart.
With scenes that would no doubt encourage and inflame, Islamic extremist
fundamentalist groups to further terrorise the free world. With images
of buses, theatres, schools filled with innocent people blown to pieces,
one can only wonder why one would want play out such possibilities! I'm
sure someone like Bin Laden is probably somewhere in Saudi Arabia
thinking, that's a great idea – why don't we just blow up the FBI
headquarters in New York by driving a truck full of TNT through the
front entrance.</P>
