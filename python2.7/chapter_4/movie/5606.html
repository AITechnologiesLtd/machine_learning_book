<P>     I may have laughed twice in this supposed black comedy about a
suburban London lad who conducted chemistry experiments on his friends
and family in the late '60's.  Based on one of Britain's most notorious
true crime stories, Graham Young (Hugh O'Conor, who played the young
Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT) fatally poisoned his step-mum.  He was
sent to a mental institution, where he was supposedly rehabilitated,
until the young sociopath was caught, again, this time "preparing the
tea" for his co-workers at an optical lab.  As directed (and co-written)
by first-timer Benjamin Ross, THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK is a
meticulous study in detail.  We watch, patiently, as Mr. Young varies
the dosage of thallium, a "heavy metal" more toxic than anything Black
Sabbath was creating at the time.  He carefully charts the progress of
his various subjects, noting when they begin exhibiting such symptoms as
vomiting or hair loss.  The whole story is rendered in a very cold and
calculated fashion that, I suppose, might be amusing to prospective
science students. </P>
