<PRE>                                   WOLF
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1994) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Jack Nicholson "marks his territory" here with a good 
(if not a little too subdued) thriller/horror film about a businessman 
who finds his life changing after being bitten by a wolf. Soon he 
has telescopic vision, super hearing, hightened smell and the sex 
drive of an 18-year-old (don't even think it--I'm only 17). There's 
another little side-effect of his newfound wolfdom: Every night he 
sneakes out of bed and rips someone's throat out with his teeth, 
only to forget about it by morning (ah yes, the old "sleep-killing" 
alibi -- OJ's latest defense). [Note: this review written in early 1995. 
I'm now 18 and O.J. walks free.]</P>
<P>        Nicholson's rival, in business and in bed, is a fellow 
employee who gets Nicholson's job as senior editor at a publishing 
company, and also gets the job done at home with Nicholson's wife, 
if you know what I mean. This doesn't make the ol' wolf too happy 
and, when his wife is discovered in Central Park, throat missing, 
you know who the Feds point the finger at--Charles Grodin's dog 
Beethoven. Ah yes, the old canine-framed-for-murder alibi (OJ's 
next defense), which leaves Nicholson free to cavort freely 
(because, you know, he's free) with the boss' daughter, the 
lovely Michelle Pfeiffer (with the not-so-lovely last name). 
Who would have thought, a wolf and a cat? Ain't that 
weird?</P>
<P>        Nicholson reveals his "hairy" problem to Pfeiffer who, as 
you'd expect, doesn't take him seriously for a second (a problem I 
know all too well. What, you think that's a joke? I'm serious, no one 
takes me seriously. Okay, that was a joke, but at least I'm trying to 
be serious about this no one taking me seriously issue. And yes, I 
do realize how seriously stupid this routine is, but I'm trying to show 
I'm not all fun and games... I'm also unfunny games. What does that 
mean? I seriously don't know). She soon changes her mind, though, 
when Nicholson brings her a dead rabbit in his mouth for 
Valentine's Day.</P>
<P>        Sure, WOLF is a little strange and is the victim of a stupid 
ending, but Nicholson and Pfeiffer make such a cute couple. Who 
would have thought, the Joker and Catwoman finally together? I 
was wondering when she'd dump that no-good Riddler.</P>
