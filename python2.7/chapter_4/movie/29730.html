<P>"What's your favorite New York moment?"</P>
<PRE>"This one's climbing the charts."</PRE>
<P>Starring John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Eugene Levy,
Molly Shannon. Directed by Peter Chelsom. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>There's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow
a distinct pattern: guy sees girl, guy wants girl, guy
goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl, guy
gets girl. In rare cases, the genders are flipped.
Predictability is a given. Rarely, though, is a
romantic comedy as cheap, as obvious, or as pointless
as Serendipity, a film that uses its "theme" as an
excuse for its plot contrivances. "Lightweight"
doesn't begin to describe it. This is like
anti-gravity.</P>
<P>It begins in a New York City Bloomingdale's, a product
placement that rivals Cast Away's FedEx for sheer
blatancy. Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara
Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) both go for the same pair of
gloves. After going through the perfunctory motions,
Jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them
go out for ice cream, followed by ice skating.
Jonathan falls hard, and Sara is charmed. When she
writes her name and number down on a piece of paper, a
truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand. She
takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be
together; Jonathan is flabbergasted. To pacify him,
she comes up with an idea: Jonathan will write his
number on a 5 dollar bill, which she will promptly
spend. When she gets home, she will write her name and
number inside a book ("Love in the Time of Cholera")
and sell it to a used bookstore. If the bill gets back
to her or the book to him, it will mean that they are
meant to be together.</P>
<P>Three years later. Both Sara and Jonathan are now
engaged to other love interests. Both realize they
aren't content. Both go looking for the other. What
happens now is so absurd that I'm almost tempted to
recommend the film for the sake of seeing it. The two
of them run circles around each other in a set of
incredible "coincidences" that I would describe as
contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly
dismissing that criticism by building its plot around
"serendipity." Of course, since the movie is about
fate, the screenwriter can do anything he damn well
pleases. I'm not buying it.</P>
<P>There's no suspense in any of this because we know
exactly what's going to happen, but Serendipity
insists on drilling its purportedly "adorable"
non-story into our heads. Instead of "Will they meet?"
the question we're asking is "When will they meet
already?" To make matters worse, every "coincidence"
is telegraphed from a mile away; by the last reel I
was bored enough to actively look for signs that
something else "incredible" was going to happen.</P>
<P>Cusack is fine and Beckinsale, at least, isn't saddled
with another lumbering, clunky screenplay (she's had
bad luck, what with Brokedown Palace and Pearl Harbor
on her resume), just an inanely pointless one.
Serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing
Eugene Levy, who plays a snarky Bloomingdale's
salesman.</P>
<P>What's the interest in watching a movie that spirals
around and around a predestined (no pun intended)
conclusion? Serendipity wants to tug at the
heartstrings, but it only tests our patience. </P>
