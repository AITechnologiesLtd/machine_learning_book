<PRE>                         STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>97 min., PG, Drama/Comedy, 1991, Canadian
Director: Cynthia Scott
Cast: Alice Diabo, Constance Garneau, Winifred Holden,
      Cissy Meddings, Mary Meigs, Catherine Roche,
      Michelle Sweeny, Beth Webber</P>
<P>     Several women are on a bus when it breaks down in the middle of
nowhere.  One of the women knows of an old falling apart house nearby
where no one lives anymore.  There are no provisions in the house and
they have little with them.  They have to depend on each other's talents
and knowledge until the bus can be fixed.</P>
<P>     STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY is a rather good film.  It does have some
slow spots, but on the whole it is well crafted.  The locations are well
picked.  By the house is a beautiful lake, and the house has nice
mountains in the background.  On a scale of zero to five, I give
STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY a three.  STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY is rated
PG for adult situations.</P>
<P>     The story, itself, is very well done.  It is touching.  You can
feel when the people are scared or depressed.  The actresses did a very
good job, I feel, convincing the audience that they were the character
in the film.  The one main problem with the film is that it sometimes
gets slow.  The fault is not with the actresses, I think, but lies in
the screenplay.  The other main problem with the film is that the oldest
woman tries, I think, to draw a little too much sympathy from the
audience.  If the actress, sorry I don't remember who played her, had
under played the character a bit, the character would have been more
believable.  The screenplay, otherwise, is very well done.  It is a
believable story, which makes the movie much better.  The characters are
ones that I felt myself caring about.  I was hoping that they wouldn't
die stranded out in the middle of nowhere, but would make it to
civilization.</P>
