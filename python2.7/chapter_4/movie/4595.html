<PRE>                            FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>FROM DUSK TILL DAWN * 1/2. Directed and edited by Robert 
Rodriguez. Written by Quentin Tarantino. Photography, 
Guillermo Navarro. Production design, Cecilia Montiel. Music, 
Graeme Revell. Cast: Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, Quentin 
Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Cheech Marin, Fred Williamson, 
Salma Hayek, Tom Savini, Ernest Liu.  A Miramax release. 100 
minutes. Rated R (language, graphic violence, more violence, 
sex, sex and horror exploitation) </P>
<P>"El Mariachi," the made-for-pennies first major work of Robert 
Rodriguez, was better than "Desperado," his big-budget sequel. 
His third movie, a segment in "Four Rooms," intensified the 
slide. In the latter, writer-director Tarantino did even 
worse."From Dusk till Dawn," written by Tarantino, directed 
and edited by Rodriguez, is also a disappointment.  </P>
<P>Mister Ugly (Tarantino) and Mister Pretty (Clooney) are the 
Gecko Brothers.  Their name (remember Michael Douglas's Gordon 
Gekko in "Wall Street"?) is the starting point for smug,mostly 
ineffectual filmic in-jokes and references. The Geckos are 
sadistic robbers and killers. Escaped convict Seth (Clooney) 
seems relatively rational  by his standards (but  how could he 
be?) and is in nominal control. Dumb,trigger-happy Richard 
(Tarantino) is a card-carrying delusional nut, sex maniac and 
rapist . Real-life hyper-kinetic, weirdo Tarantino is well 
cast. Clooney too. He slips easily into the strong, menacing 
character of Rodriguez or Tarantino movies. </P>
<P>The pair have just robbed a Texas bank, killed many and taken 
a hostage. (All this is later reported  on TV with amusing 
black, media-satirizing humor). In  a roadside gas station the 
brothers add to the body count. It's so gratuitously, crazily 
shown that the violence is stylized and surreal. As they're 
fleeing to Mexico, another in-joke, a kind of  X-ray of their 
car's trunk, reveals momentarily their trussed up hostage. 
Someone has been watching Godard and Truffaut movies; someone 
ought to have learned from them more about substance and 
subtexts. </P>
<P>A family of three in an RV are the next hostages. The parts 
are performed with unusual calm --another in-joke.  Harvey 
Keitel is a widowed pastor who has lost his faith. In another 
joke on the audience, Keitel's daughter Juliette Lewis, whom 
we would expect to join the brothers as a Natural Born Killer, 
does not. In a logic-defying gag, Chinese-American Ernest Liu 
plays the son. Clooney wonders :"How can he be your son? He 
looks Japanese." "No" retorts Keitel," he looks Chinese."  </P>
<P>Of such bits is the first part made. They are sort of  
promising,  although for a good, oddly lyrical yet 
based-on-fact killing spree movie I would recommend "Badlands" 
(1973) with Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. </P>
<P>Entering Mexico, the brothers rendez-vous with their Mexican 
contacts in Titty Twister, a huge, crass, baroque, surreal 
strip joint in the middle of nowhere. It is full of nude 
dancers and swarthy, murderous-looking Mexican bikers and 
truckers. (Texican Rodriguez keeps perpetuating movie 
cliches). One of the customers has a miniature cannon strapped 
to his private parts. The joint almost makes you smell sweat, 
body odors, and think of V.D. Violent things happen. </P>
<P>After a lull, Satanico Pandemonium (beautiful Salma Hayek from 
"Desperado") does a number with a huge snake. Suddenly she 
morphs into a ghoul --as does everyone else.  Becoming allies, 
captors and hostages unite against an onslaught of vampires, 
the Undead, monsters. The struggle goes on forever. How long 
is "forever"? My stopwatch 's battery got so fed up that it 
died. </P>
<P>At the start of this second half there are sporadic gags. 
"Does anyone have a cross?" (to stop the vampires). "No, but 
two pieces of wood would do. Peter Cushing does it all the 
time."  A disquisition on vampires follows.  "We need a book, 
a real book" "Like  a Time-Life book?"  Cheap humor, but still  
preferable to the mayhem.</P>
<P>Interminably, the morphing and re-morphing disgusting vampire 
critters attack. The lurid, incoherent hodge-podge of 
massacres is an orgy of gore and dismemberment. It also kills 
whatever character development was present earlier. 
Unrelieved, very dull, this becomes a second, tacked-on, 
irrelevant movie.  The visuals and other special effects are 
skillful, but so what? It's all deja vu. The only original, 
also surreal gag, at the very end, when we see the back of the 
joint. It  is built like a Mexican pyramid. </P>
<P>The fortune all this cost could have Rodriguez's parents, nine 
siblings and extended family live in comfort for a lifetime, 
with money left over for another ten generations. This flick 
is not merely over-the-top, it tops the topper. It is not 
plain old pulp fiction either. Much of it is what happens to 
pulp after it's been digested. </P>
