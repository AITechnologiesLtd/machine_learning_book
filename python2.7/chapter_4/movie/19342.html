<P>(Dialog in German, English subtitles)</P>
<P>This film was released under the English title "Run Lola Run".</P>
<P>A recent series of television beer advertisements pokes fun of the
stereotype of abstract and conceptual tendencies in German literature.
Coming almost as proof of the stereotype is this film -- a nonlinear,
kinetic story filled with action, suspense, color, and music.</P>
<P>The frenetic adventure for Lola and Manni is immediately hinted by the
punk couple's colorful appearance. Lola (Franka Potente) has
florescent hair, florescent clothes, and tattoos. Manni (Moritz
Bleibtreu) is also tattooed, and works as a courier for a small time
gangster. The narrative begins when Lola receives a phone call from a
distraught Manni explaining that he is in deep trouble. Manni was
running an errand for the boss, but he accidentally left the payoff on
the subway. He needs to meet the gangster in a short time, and he will
be in deep trouble if he does not deliver the 100,000 marks. Manni
gives Lola 20 minutes to come up with a plan to raise the money, or
else he will hold up a store to get it. Lola's moped was stolen
earlier, so now she is left without transportation. The only way for
her to get the money and then get to Manni is to sprint across town.</P>
<P>The story is presented in a cleverly nonlinear fashion. The plot is
split between actual events and the imaginations of the characters
without any clear indication beforehand which is which. The narrative
has its share of improbabilities and implausibilities, but these do
not detract from the film because its focus is clearly on the mood and
flow of the story. It attempts to tell story in which imagery (both
visual and sonic) are as important as the actual events. Writer and
director Tom Tykwer intentionally created the imagery first, and then
developed the story to drive it. However, the narrative is not merely
a formula in service to the effects. The story follows multiple
threads of time and explores the ripple effect of decisions made early
in a sequence of events.</P>
<P>Most of the story consists of Lola sprinting through Berlin in a race
against time, trying to reach Manni before he makes a stupid mistake
out of desperation, and somehow getting the money along the way. This
automatically sets a high energy level, which is well regulated by
effective breaks that allow the story elements to emerge and develop.
Although the high adrenaline approach help to camouflage story
weaknesses, it also creates an involved viewing experience. The fact
that it effectively intersperses action and suspense makes it an
engaging film.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. The film is a fast-paced, high-energy, visual and
musical experience. It evokes the feel of an extended music video in
its use of techno music and its mix of live action, cartoon, and
stills. The appeal of the film is more for its imagery than for its
story, which is interesting, but slightly porous. This would be a good
choice for a group of people to watch together as a midnight movie. It
may not appeal to an audience that does not appreciate modern
electronic music, and expects a straight forward plot.</P>
