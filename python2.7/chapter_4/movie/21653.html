<P>   Imagine you're about to have some guests for an afternoon
party. You go to the baker's for bread and cake, to the liquor
store for wine, to the appetizer's for smoked salmon.  All the
while you scurry about you're thinking about the festivities
which are to begin in four hours.  You wonder whether your
party will succeed, get good word-of-mouth, make your
friends jealous.  At the same time you think back thirty years
to the time you shopped in similar places for your mother,
and regret the passing of years.  This is the mundane, daily
life of the middle-class American, and who's to complain?  </P>
<P>   Now think of a different situation.  You go to the bakery
and, instead of thinking of the future (however near) or the
past (however remote), you're taking in the smells and
sounds and feel of the place.  Your mind is centered on the
moment, the sort of affair that the swamis and gurus tell us is
life's most desirable activity.  </P>
<P>   Now change your flow of thought to the movies. Would a
dramatization of this concept be much of a story to show on
the wide screen?  Probably not, you say.  Cinema, at least as
we in the world's capital of the art form believe, is action.  We
worship a strong plot with a firm trajectory, each action
propelling the next to a blockbuster conclusion.  While this
sort of narrative appears to have captured the world's primary
audience for the pictures, there is yet another form of
powerful cinema, one which is minimalist by contrast, and yet
which leads by its succession of images to a commanding
place in the mind of sophisticated viewers.  "The Silence,"
known in its director's native Iran by the Farsi title "Sokhout,"
is such a yarn, centering on a ten-year-old boy who is in a
way the sort of kid that Spielberg could dream up to introduce
him and his audience to a mysterious world barely known. 
The youngster who is the focus of Mohsen Makhmalbaf's
drama is Khorshid (Tahmineh Normatova), a ten-year-old who
is blind but who is not overly sheltered by his poverty-stricken
mother whose husband had some time back run off to
Russia. ("The Silence" was filmed in Muslim Tadjikistan,
which became independent of the former Soviet Union just a
decade or so ago and where the women, by contrast with
Iran, do not wear chodors.)  </P>
<P>   There isn't much of a plot to "The Silence," but that's
hardly the point.  The boy goes to work by bus, often
escorted by his sighted friend Nadereh (Nadereh
Abdelahyeva), where he uses his skilled ear to tune stringed
instruments for an old man who runs a shop.  The conflict,
such as there is one, exists in the forthcoming dismissal of
this lovely child by his boss because his little employee is
often late to work.  Though Khorshid regularly blames the bus
for being tardy, the real reason for his detainment is that he
becomes fascinated along the way the sounds of nature
which, to him, come across literally as music.  He can spend
several minutes listening to a bee buzz as it crawls about a
jar and flies off, and he prays for the winged creature's safe
journey.  When Khorshid shops among the street merchants
for bread with his mother, he hears the sales pitches of the
colorfully-garbed women as though they were a chorus in an
opera and uses his acute senses to select a loaf not by its
freshness but by the pleasing voice of its merchant.  Even
the dreaded knocks by his mother's landlord on the door of
their modest home sound to him not like the dissonant timbre
of a Stravinsky ballet but like the four opening notes of
Beethoven's 5th Symphony.  When Khorshid listens to boys
his own age hammering out objects on their job without
rhythm or meaning, he instructs them to hit the objects with
the cadence of these same four notes until, in one climactic
scene, he conducts a large "orchestra" of street drummers in
part of the first movement of the Fifth.</P>
<P>   By this movie, acted with perfectly natural performance by
the entire ensemble, Mohsen Makhmalbaf does indeed
appear to take on the guise of the Indian gurus who urge us
to live in the present.  Life is precious, too cherished to spend
our moments giving much thought to the past or to plan for
the future however close.  Think only of the moment.  Take in
the glorious sounds of nature and of human beings.  The
most ordinary activities can reverberate like a Verdi
masterpiece.  In fact, there is no such thing as a mundane
moment.  The world is an enchanted place of glorious
consonance.  A little boy can lead you to view it as such, or
so says this consummate film.</P>
