                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>

Branagh. Photography, Roger Lanser. Editing, Neil Farrell.

Collins (Margaretta D'Arcy) and the voice of Noel Coward. A  
Castle Rock/Sony release. 98 minutes. Rated R (language) </P>
<P>It would be an insult to the acting profession to state  that 
Kenneth Branagh is today Shakespeare's paramount interpreter. 
True, he is excellent, but there are many actors or directors 
who can do a bang-up job with the works of the Bard, 
especially in Britain, a country that constantly amazes us 
with its talented people.</P>
<P>Whether Branagh is Number One or Number Twelve (out of 
hundreds probably) is a moot point. The fact is that thanks to 
his films, he is currently, at least in the English-speaking 
world, the most famous Shakespearean. Knowing as he does what 
he speaks of and what the theatrical profession is, he's a 
natural to have written and directed "A Midwinter's Tale."  </P>
<P>Long unemployed actor Joe Harper (Maloney) is a man so 
desperate for work that he invests what money he has left , 
plus a sum from his nice agent Margaretta (Joan Collins) to 
float a "Hamlet" with a cast of unknowns who will work on a 
share basis.</P>
<P>"Midwinter" opens to the great, distinctive tones of the 
great, late and lamented Noel Coward singing his great, funny, 
affectionately cynical song "Why Must the Show Go On?"  This 
is also the title of Act I.</P>
<P>Soon Joe is auditioning a succession of down-and-out 
performers. They are, collectively and individually, such a 
magnificent, such an incredible set of eccentrics, bizarros, 
hams, weirdos and hilarious types that they make that 
10-minute sequence a four star piece.  </P>
<P>Past this magnificent start, some of the movie becomes 
anti-climactic, though still eminently worth watching. There 
are 24 speaking parts in "Hamlet." Joe can only afford a cast 
of six  to do all the roles. He will be Hamlet, myopic Nina 
will be Ophelia, gay Terry wants to do a queen (Gertrude, of 
course).  Two are non-actors: Fadge (an odd nickname for an 
odd woman) in charge of designing the production and the 
costumes: and Joe's sister, nursery teacher Molly, the 
manager, caterer and ticket seller. The situation is fraught 
with madness.</P>
<P>AC II. "There's No Business Like Show Business." It's 
Chritmastime. Molly works in a village called Hope. (No, not 
the Hope, Arkansas of Bill Clinton or the famous 
loudspeaker-maker Paul Klipsch. This is England). The troupe 
hies over there to occupy the play's venue, a large, drafty 
church, where they will somehow live and work for three weeks. </P>
<P>The rest is far from silence. To the tune of Coward's song, 
the players prepare, rehearse, argue, improvise, stumble and 
bumble, do group exercises. They want to make "Hamlet" 
relevant to modern times and do odd things, especially as each 
person has his own notions about what should be done and how. 
They bicker and squabble (though never seriously, since 
they're no stars or divas), fraternize and pull apart. They 
are by and large self-centered, insecure and often inept. But 
they try. A nimble camera follows them.</P>
<P>What Branagh does is to combine a comic send-up of his 
profession with a great deal of affection for it and its 
members. He exaggerates the idiosyncrasies of his people, both 
keeping to what they are like, yet adding at times a 
near--grotesque spin, more so than do two other films I saw 
recently, about actors who never stop acting in "real" life 
(but then what is reality to illusion makers?) : Francois 
Truffaut's "Day for Night" and Henry Jaglom's "Last Summer in 
the Hamptons."</P>
<P>The movie proceeds interestingly, colorfully but unevenly, 
with peaks and troughs. Its nine people talk non-stop with 
machine-gun speed. That's an obvious flaw. We cannot keep up 
with them, there are no little pauses for savoring a 
particularly good line, trivialities cannot be distinguished 
from serious points. The speed and aural muddle can irritate 
somewhat. The film ought to have modeled its speech after the 
marvelous clarity of Noel Coward's diction, especially as the 
sounds are not helped by the echoey stone of the church.</P>
<P>ACT III. "Another Opening! Another Show!" Matters pick up. 
Camaraderie  mounts. Euphoria sets in as opening (and closing) 
night draws near. But now comes a crisis caused by sudden good 
luck (which I will not disclose) of a character. The play is 
about to be canceled, but a last-minute shift allows it to go 
on. And it's a dandy performance of "Hamlet," emergencies 
notwithstanding. The small audience loves it, the thespians 
love it and each other, there's even a warm, Hollywood-type 
reunion between a father and a neglected son.  </P>
<P>Branagh said: "It's a romantic and comedic look at the theatre 
and actors, with a plot that owes much to the kind of romance 
and silliness of the old Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland 
movies." Perhaps, but with a huge difference. When Mickey and 
Judy said "Let's have a show," which was inevitably almost 
canceled at the eleventh hour but saved at the twelfth, the 
stakes were youthful fun and games. In Branagh's movie, the 
stakes are much higher for the adults and the oldsters.  It's 
a matter of precarious survival, self-esteem and  justifying 
one's life.</P>
