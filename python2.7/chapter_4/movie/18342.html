<PRE>FORCES OF NATURE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Part road movie, part romantic comedy, Forces of Nature takes several
overfamiliar plots and, well, repeats them.  It's certainly not
innovative, but it does have its moments.</P>
<P>Ben (Ben Affleck) is about to be married.  His fiancee, Bridget (Maura
Tierney) is waiting for him in Savannah, where the wedding is set to
take place in a few days.  All Ben has to do is travel from New York to
Savannah.  Easy, right?  Not so fast...</P>
<P>With a seemingly unstoppable streak of bad luck, Ben's path is thwarted
in some way each step of the way.  To further complicate things, he
meets the free-spirited Sarah (Sandra Bullock), also on her way to
Savannah.</P>
<P>The pair use nearly every method of transportation aside from pogo
sticks in their travels, but are always diverted in one way or another.
Will Ben reach Savannah in time  for his wedding?  Will he still want to
get married after his wild  adventures?  Will the audience's still care?</P>
<P>It is hard to watch Forces of Nature without thinking that the
filmmakers must have been heavily influenced by the Steve Martin-John
Candy comedy Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  In fact the plot feels
like a watered down version of that earlier comedy, with a little
romance mixed in.  The misadventures of Ben and Sarah are never truly
inspired, but do have the odd moments of humor.</P>
<P>The screenplay does little to ward off the strange feelings of deja vu.
The film is never subtle about its foreshadowing.  For example, the
film's opening scene focuses on a weather forecast showing a hurricane
heading straight for Savannah.  This warning is repeated multiple times
throughout the film.  The only thing that comes as a surprise is the
fact that none of the characters in the film seem to be aware of what's
coming.</P>
<P>Still, despite the odd feeling that you've been here before, the cast is
able to make the journey worthwhile.  Surprisingly, it isn't due to the
leads who, though likeable, spark little chemistry.  It's the supporting
cast that makes this one shine.  From Maura Tierney to Richard Schiff,
the little roles make the movie. Particular credit goes to Steve Zahn
for perking up the few scenes he's in as the wild and crazy best man.</P>
<P>To wrap things up, Forces of Nature contorts itself to deliver an ending
that is neither crowd-pleasing nor believable.  It's the final
puzzlement in a puzzlement of a movie.</P>
