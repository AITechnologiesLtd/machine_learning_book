<P>_Next_Stop_Wonderland_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>A fresh location, likable lead actors, a cute concept.  The destination of
the romantic comedy _Next_Stop_Wonderland_ would appear to be moviegoers'
hearts.  But as charming as the film often is, something crucial feels
missing on this journey.</P>
<P>That something missing is not the main character, Erin Castleton, played
with a nice balance of edge and sensitivity by Hope Davis.  Erin, a
registered nurse in Boston, is soured on love after her political activist
boyfriend (Philip Seymour Hoffman) ditches her to take part in a protest.
The last thing on her mind is finding a new man, but her freespirited
socialite mother (Holland Taylor) takes out a personal ad in Erin's name.
Suddenly, Erin finds herself fielding the romantic interests of a number of
not-so-gentlemanly callers.</P>
<P>Of course, the ideal man for her is not among the ad respondents.  Could
that elusive guy be former plumber/aspiring marine biologist Alan Monteiro
(Alan Gelfant)?  Alan is a nice, upstanding guy who, when not attending
school full time, volunteers at the Boston Aquarium and tries to raise
money to pay off a loan shark (Victor Argo).  Alan and Erin's paths
frequently cross, but in the film's central conceit, keep on narrowly
missing each other, creating a "will they or won't they" romantic tension.</P>
<P>Or at least that's the presumption made by director Brad Anderson and his
co-writer, Lyn Vaus (who appears in the film as one of Erin's suitors).  As
pleasant as _Next_Stop_Wonderland_ is, never did I get the feeling that
Alan was truly _the_guy_ for Erin.  He's certainly nice, but Anderson and
Vaus never establish any concrete reason why these two should connect other
than the fact that they, the filmmakers, want them to.  Hence, any rooting
interest I had in their meeting came from less an ardent interest in a love
connection than a simple curiosity as to what would happen.</P>
<P>Still, the film holds a quiet, unassuming appeal, due to some witty
moments (an extended sequence in which Erin interviews her ad respondents is a
comic highlight) and, most especially, the endearing performances by Davis
and Gelfant.  While one may not be terribly invested in them as a pair,
they are each so likable that one is definitely invested in them as
individual personalities.  If that weren't the case, the ultralightweight
_Next_Stop_Wonderland_ could have easily been _Next_Stop_Slumberland_.</P>
