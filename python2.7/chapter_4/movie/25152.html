 The Patriot (2000) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger,
Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs, Chris Cooper and Tom Wilkinson. Music by
John Williams. Screenplay by Robert Rodat. Directed by Roland Emmerich.</P>
<P> "The Patriot" is a rousing, bloody, violent adventure that despite its
drawbacks, will more than likely be a huge crowd pleaser.</P>
<P> And I have to admit that regardless of the movie's obvious flaws, I
remained enthralled and entertained for nearly its entire 164 minutes.</P>
<P> This, of course, is mainly due to the charismatic presence of Mel
Gibson as fictional Revolutionary War hero Benjamin Martin, a South
Carolina landowner loosely based on Frances Marion, the legendary `Swamp
Fox.'</P>
<P> "The Patriot" feels like a movie created by people who study
demographics. There's blood and guts for the guys; a love story,
featuring two attractive young people, for the women; a paean to
brotherhood for the liberals; and a good dose of God, country and
flag-waving for the conservatives.</P>
<P> In other words, "The Patriot" offers something for everyone.</P>
<P> The movie earns its R rating. The battle scenes are brutal with men
losing limbs as well as lives. Screenwriter Robert Rodat ("Saving
Private Ryan") captures the futility of 18th-century warfare in which
armies would line up across from each other on the field and use the
opposing force for target practice until one army gave up and fled.</P>
<P> Gibson's Martin, realizing how ineffectual such tactics are, adopts
guerrilla warfare and hit-and-run forays to achieve his successes.</P>
<P> At the outset Martin opposes fighting. A heroic veteran of the French
and Indian Wars, he is tired of bloodshed.</P>
<P> However, when an arrogant and thoroughly despicable British dragoon,
Col. William Tavington (Jason Isascs) cold-bloodedly kills Martin's
15-year-old son, Martin is instantly transformed into a lethal foe, who
harasses the British at every turn.</P>
<P> Martin's transformation comes to quickly, too easily. And that is one
of the movie's flaws.</P>
<P> Another is Isaacs' performance as Tavington. He has no redeeming
qualities. He is absolutely evil, casually killing men, women and
children without hesitation.</P>
<P> Also fighting the war is hunky Heath Ledger ("Ten Things I Hate About
You") as Gabriel, Martin's eldest son, who fights alongside his father.
This young actor is the main reason young women will flock to "The
Patriot." Like Gibson, he is a ruggedly handsome individual.</P>
<P> Another problem with the film is its political correctness. There is
just too much of it. A young woman speechifies in church about the
necessity of men going to fight for their beliefs.</P>
<P> Then there's the minor subplot of the redneck member of Martin's army
who dislikes then comes to respect the black slave who also is a member
of the group.</P>
<P> Director Roland Emmerich keeps the proceedings in motion. There is very
little dead space. He is ably abetted by Caleb Deschanel's expert and
portrait-like cinematography.</P>
<P> But this is Gibson's movie, an old-fashioned star turn. He makes some
of Rodat's overripe dialogue  palatable. He has a vulnerability about
him, a sense of regret for what he has to do and loss for the personal
cost the war is extracting from him.</P>
<P> John Williams offers another of his red, white and blue symphonic
concoctions. It blends perfectly with the action on the screen.</P>
<P> Overall, "The Patriot" will hold your attention. I have to admit that
it more than compensates for its weaknesses. A larger-than-life hero, a
hissable villain, a moving love story. Who could ask for anything more?</P>
<P> "The Patriot" may be history as redefined by Hollywood, but it still
manages to convey the tenacity and will of those who, knowing they were
vastly outnumbered, continued with dogged determination to fight for
their dream.</P>
