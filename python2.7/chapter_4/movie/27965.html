<P>   When I got home after the screening of the adorable Irish
film "About Adam," the first person who asked about the story
line was my 22-year-old doorman.  When I told him that the
movie was about a guy whose success with women was
based on his intuitive calculation of what each one wanted
from him (an ability that seems to have eluded Dr. Freud), he
said, "What's the big deal?  Doesn't every guy who wants to
be liked adjust his personality according to the person he's
with?"  "Well, yeah," I agreed--but the title character of this
movie, played by the appealing Stuart Townsend (who
emerges as well as the scholar Dov in Ben Hopkins's
sometimes surreal drama "Simon Magus"), does so with a
vengeance...he psyches out each woman in seconds and
from then on alters his manner the way a chameleon changes
its skin and stays in character every minute he's with the
object of his affections. No fights, no real arguments, no
hostility.</P>
<P>   Adam's opinion of women is not unlike that of Richard
Gere's Dr. T., who considered each one of them a saint. 
Adam loves women.  What looks like cynical manipulation in
the way he connects with them according to their character is
just his way of giving them something.  Indeed, each of the
three women from the same Dublin family--and even one of
the young men in the story--changes after being liberated by
by this lad whose mother must have named him Adam
because she suspected that he would fulfill the statement in
Genesis 3:12, "And Adam said: The Woman you put beside
me, gave me fruit, and I ate."  Adam does metaphorically
take the fruitful offerings and indulges at least as much as he
is indulged.</P>
<P>   The distinguished online critic from Dublin, Harvey O'Brien,
calls Gerard Stembridge's tale "notable for being among the
first Irish films to lack interest in 'Irishness'," and by this I
believe he means since Dublin is now a swinging
cosmopolitan city, the action could really occur
anywhere in the western world.  The dialogue is
understandable even to Americans (unlike another Irish
romance that made the scene this year, Kieron Walsh's
"When Brendan Met Trudy").  There is no trace of the poverty
present in Alan Parker's "Angela's Ashes," and in fact
the action centers on a middle-class family presided over by
the free-spirited Peggy (Rosaleen Linehan) who brings up a
trio of daughters who are so different from one another they
appear to come from different countries.  Adam gets to meet
them when he embarks on his first date with the sprightly and
assertive Lucy (Kate Hudson), whom he dazzles when he
realizes that someone of her disposition prefers to lead and
would probably go for a young man on the shy side.  When
he notes that Lucy's repressed, bookish sister Laura (Frances
O'Connor)--who, by the way, is the one I'd have chosen were
I to be introduced to the brood--he quotes poetry to her,
which charms her particularly since he recites lines from a
her favorite writer, one who is not a household word in
Dublin.  Running into their sophisticated married sib, Alice
(Charlotte Bradley)--who is unhappily married to a boorish car
salesman--he has no trouble engaging her attentions and
affection and, most amusingly, even sexually turns on the
family's arrow-straight brother, David (Alan Maher), who had
approached Adam for advice on how to make it with his
reluctant girl friend.</P>
<P>   How did Adam acquire the vintage Jaguar in which he
drives the women about?  Who knows?  Each date gets a
different story depending on what he thinks each wants to
hear.   Adam seduces the three women, of course, but writer-
director Stembridge wisely puts the whole string of episodes
into an amoral framework, refusing to condemn Adam's
prevarications.  And why should we?  True enough, he
commits what, in a stretch, could be called an incestuous
turn, but given the happiness he has given to the young
people in the family, we're pleased to let him get away with
his knavishness.</P>
<P>   The story line becomes most impressive when Stembridge
photographs Lucy's public marriage proposal to Adam three
times, from the perspectives of diverse people who are sitting
at a table with him in a hip Dublin night spot.</P>
<P>   Tech credits are fine with the exception of a single scene
photographed on the outskirts of Dublin, when the color of
Bruno de Keyzer's lens strangely gives the spectacular view
of the city a faded look and the hills become affected with
black spots. The song that informs the soundtrack at the
conclusion of the picture that begins, "God help the mister/
who comes between me and my sister," must have been
used ironically, as Adam, unlike his biblical counterpart,
seems in no way destined to be expelled from Eden.</P>
