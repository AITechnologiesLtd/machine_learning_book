<P>As reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> Ah, the splendid sight of a good movie after a string of bad ones.
Understand me, I have seen about five bad movies in a row, and, when I
watched Alive, I broke my streak.  Perhaps then it is fitting that I should
write my review of Alive last (the last of a marathon writing stretch of
seven reviews), that is should be my final respite after such a long series
of typing.</P>
<P> Alive is the true story of a plane crash that occurred in 1972 in the
Andes.  Come on, you know what I'm talking about, the one where the
survivors had to resort to cannibalism?  Yeah, I saw that episode of
"Seinfeld" too.  The movie has been parodied way too much for something of
its caliber.</P>
<P> It starts out with a steely narration by John Malkovich, who tells of his
finding God in the Andes, and then quickly goes into a terrific sequence
involving the plane crash.</P>
<P> From there on in, most of the rest of the movie occurs at the front half of
the plane, where 27 survivors begin their fight to live.  A few people are
completely broken by the experience and die.   A few people do will go to
any lengths to survive.</P>
<P> The particular lengths they will go to include cannibalism.  They do not
kill and eat, but instead eat the people who have already died.  Nando
(Ethan Hawke) and Antonio (Vincent Spano) have such strong survival
instincts that they are willing to climb the Andes to save themselves and
their friends.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, I saw Alive last, after all of the wave of survival films
that it spawned.  Because all of these were Alive rips, Alive now appears to
be contrived and cliched.  But it is not.</P>
<P> Alive is a movie able to touch your heart (and your stomach) as it grimly
displays the miraculous true story of survival in the Andes.  Using relative
unknowns at the time, Alive was able to manipulate the audiences into
believing that the circumstances were actually happening.</P>
<P> As normal, however, I have my complaints of Alive.  For one, although the
performances are great, the dialogue is incredibly bad.  True story or no, I
have trouble believing that anyone would say half the lines in this movie.
Also, the movie tries to be funny.  Although many people who go through
trauma develop a dark sense of humor, it doesn't ever seem realistic... and
seeming realistic is what dramas are about.</P>
<P> Ethan Hawke and Vincent Spano do their finest studio roles (Gattaca as an
exception for Ethan Hawke) as they take on fairly simple characters and take
them to new heights.  Illeana Douglas manages to hold her own as practically
the only female member of the cast, a woman desiring to go home to her
family.  Most impressive, however, is John Haymes Newton, who plays the team
captain, Antonio Vizintin.</P>
<P> Antonio is a control-freak who is forced, by the mountains, to realize that
there are things that he cannot control.  As the mountain gets harsher on
them, and as hope dies, Antonio dies along with it.  Nando and Antonio
Balbi, however, will not allow their hope to die.</P>
<P> Alive is a good drama, uplifting, hopeful, and intelligent.  It is not the
greatest movie ever made, nor is it especially worth spending three bucks to
rent. If it's on the television, however, go ahead.</P>
