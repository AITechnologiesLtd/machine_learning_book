                       A film review by Chuck Dowling

<P>(1970) ***1/2 - C:The Rolling Stones.</P>
<P>I am not a huge music fan and I must admit that I don't own any albums by
the Rolling Stones, which made me hesitant to watch a documentary about a
concert they performed back in 1969. However, "Gimme Shelter" is a
fascinating film. At that concert, four babies were born and four people
were killed, and one of the murders was captured on camera by the crew
filming the documentary. It seems as though that before the concert, the
Hell's Angels were asked to make sure that no one gets onto the stage and it
seems they took their job a little too seriously. Even without that, the
documentary is still interesting. People keep trying to grab Mick Jagger,
dogs run across the stage, etc. It has a "Hey, Look At The Freaks" feel to
it, as we watch so many people whacked out on drugs do really embarassing
and stupid things. I hope that these people had children, that these
children rent this film, see their parents making complete fools of
themselves, and then torment their parents until the day they die. This film
would be great for schools to show as part of their "Say No To Drugs"
programs. George Lucas is credited for some of the camera work.</P>
<P>As a footnote: Jim Carrey's character in The Cable Guy, right before singing
"Somebody To Love" by Jefferson Airplane, credits the song's success to this
film. However, even though Jefferson Airplane does play at the concert, that
song is not part of the film.</P>
