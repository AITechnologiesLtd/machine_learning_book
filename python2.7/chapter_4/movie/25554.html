<PRE>HOLLOW MAN
----------</PRE>
<P>Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a thrill jock genius leading a team of
scientists on a U.S. government project to create invisibility.  While
he's been successful, he's having trouble cracking 'reversion,' or the
ability to make the invisible visible again.  A middle-of-the-night idea
results in the reappearance of the team's transparent ape, but Sebastian
isn't ready to tell his bosses about his success until he's tested the
process on a human subject - himself - in director Paul Verhoeven's 
"Hollow Man."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>While "Hollow Man" features some truly eye-popping special effects, its
lack of character and story development make it one of the most disappointing
of Verhoeven's ("Starship Troopers") career.  The film opens with a pow
as we see a lab rat going through its paces.  Suddenly, it's clenched by
something unseen, which proceeds to rip its head off, outlining the 
suspended jaw of a gorilla in blood.  This incident is never referred to
within the film, yet is one of the only portents that invisibility may
breed disturbing side effects.</P>
<P>Caine is quickly established as rather arrogant, a young Turk whose genius
causes others to give his behavior leeway.  Very efficiently, it's established 
that his right-hand staffer, Linda (Elizabeth Shue, "Leaving Las Vegas") is a 
former lover who Caine would like to have back.  She's hiding the identity
of her current lover Matt (Josh Brolin, "The Mod Squad") from Sebastian
because Matt's another high level staffer on Sebastian's team.  More 
workplace complexity is embodied in Sarah (Kim Dickens, "The Zero Effect"),
the compassionate veterinarian who clashes with Sebastian's sensibilities
(he jokes - or is he? - about vivisecting the ape which almost died from the
shock of being brought back to visibility).</P>
<P>Once Sebastian's invisible, the whole group becomes uneasy in their
subterranean complex.  Janice (Mary Jo Randle) keeps her thermal goggles on 
while in the ladies room.  Sarah awakens with too many of her buttons undone 
and gets tense.  When Sebastian's reversal fails (his skeletal and muscular
structures begin to rebuild, then fade back away), a fleshtone mask and
gloves are made for him to give him appearance while the group works the
problem.  This disguise also allows Caine to leave the complex, where
he's soon wrecks havoc with the power of his invisibility (although a
long-rumored rape scene is cut perfuntorily and never referred to again).  
Linda ultimately decides to come clean with their funders, but Caine turns the 
tables by murdering the project head and locking the entire team into the 
underground bunker.</P>
<P>Kudos to Kevin Bacon for putting up with the grueling labor required to
blank himself out for the camera - he was required to wear three different
body suits (complete with colored full eye contacts) in order to 'appear'
when hit with water/liquids, steam, smoke, etc.  However his leap from
arrogant jerk to murderous maniac doesn't allow him to do much in the way
of acting.  Shue should stay away from scientest roles as demonstrated by
"The Saint."  While she's not required to wear knee socks with a lab coat
in this film, she is required to run from mark to mark proclaiming each
subsequent victim's death before going into Sigourney-Weaver-in-"Alien"-mode.
Brolin's OK as the second banana who touches off Caine's rage while the 
remaining cast are simply dead meat.</P>
<P>The effects are pretty neat, but I was always aware I was watching computer
generation - the scaling back and subsequent rebuilding of the human body
from the inside out looked like 3D modelling conducted on a lab bed.  Slicker
were the partial impressions of the invisible when exposed via another
medium.  </P>
<P>The screenplay (Andrew W. Marlowe, "End of Days") does nothing but move
the action along with little in the way of explanation for Caine's moral
degradation other than the concept that invisible eyelids don't allow one
to catch many Z's.  A long, drawn out climax is hoary indeed.  I've seen
one too many film's end where the surviving hero(es) climb up a tall shaft
while water or fire approaches and wouldn't it be refreshing indeed for
the bad guy to stay dead the first time he's offed?</P>

<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>In 1933, director James Whales scared and titillated people with his adaptation
of the H.G. Wells story "The Invisible Man." That film, with the wonderful
special effects created by John Fulton and the introduction of Claude Raines to
the screen, set a level of achievement that has been often sought, but rarely
attained. Director Paul Verhoeven ("Starship Troopers") makes a valiant, but
vain, attempt to bring the classic tale into the new millennium with "Hollow
Man."</P>
<P>Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is a brilliant, egotistical scientist who has
broken new ground with his research in invisibility. His experiments in making
his lab creatures invisible have been quite successful, but he has had major
problems bringing them back. The protocol he designed is too unstable to safely
bring back visibility until he has a brainstorm that may be the breakthrough he
needs. When Sebastian and his lieutenants, Linda McKay (Elizabeth Shue) and
Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), go before a government committee, the scientist 
lies about his latest idea and asks for more time.</P>
<P>Sebastian, before he publicly announces his anticipated achievement, wants to
take the next crucial step in the experiment - use a human test subject. He
lies to the rest of his staff, telling them that the committee approved the 
leap to human subjects. Caine then subjects himself to the invisibility serum 
and enters a brave new world - the first invisible man. But, his brainstorm 
wasn't quite right and, when Linda and Matt attempt to bring him back to 
visibility, the return to normal fails. To complicate matters, the invisibility 
drug has side effects that make the subject uncontrollably violent. It's a race 
against time as Sebastian goes power mad and Linda, Matt and the rest of the 
staff have to stop him.</P>
<P>Paul Verhoeven may believe that he has created a modern version of the Whales'
classic horror/monster flick with "Hollow Man." He hasn't. What he has done is
to make a version of a cool story that capitalizes on the F/X technology of
today, but fails to capture the essence of what made the 1933 film such a
landmark event. The problem is, there isn't a fresh approach to the story.
Instead, the screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson and Andrew W. Marlowe is a
rehash of many of the mad scientist movies of the 50's and journeys into 
well-traveled science fiction territory.</P>
<P>Why is it that every genius scientist in films like "Hollow Man" always forgoes
the rigid rules of research and use themselves as guinea pigs in experiments
that are doomed to disaster? The answer is, of course, because we wouldn't be
spending our time and money watching a movie about a guy who follows the rules
of science and never strays beyond them. That would be boring. Unfortunately,
so is the cookie cutter approach made by Verhoeven and company in attempting to
recreate the mood and feel of the '33 original. There is nothing new in this
latest rendition of the Invisible Man tale, except for some first-class F/X.</P>
<P>Though Kevin Bacon plays the title character, Elizabeth Shue is top billed. The
actress does not reprise the power she showed in Mike Figgis's "Leaving Las
Vegas." Of course, there is a big difference between the character intense
nature of her earlier film and the F/X extravaganza of "Hollow Man." Shue
doesn't get to show any thesping ability here as she, basically, runs around
through most of the film and delivers lines like, "He's dead," with no
inflection or drama to her delivery. So far, the wow perf that Figgis got out
of her has not been duplicated since.</P>
<P>Kevin Bacon, as expected, is a non-person through much of the film. His
Sebastian Caine is a smart, arrogant egomaniac in the beginning and, until he
becomes a monster, pretty much stays that way. Josh Brolin and the rest of the
cast are relegated to background, though Brolin gets a bit more air time as
Linda's secret (from Sebastian) boyfriend and subject of invisible Sebastian's
ire. The remains of the cast are fodders for the monster to prey on and little
more.</P>
<P>Production values are high, especially in the set design by Allan Cameron
("Starship Trooper") and the F/X, led by Scott E. Anderson ("Babe"). The
sterile, high tech laboratory is slick in design and, despite the usual cheesy
computer stuff, lends a good look to the proceedings. The visual effects are
superior with the computer-generated invisibility process and, more subtly
done, Sebastian's return to visibility in water, smoke or the spray of a fire
extinguisher. Too bad high production values can't save a movie. (See the 1999
Jan de Bont film, "The Haunting," as another example of great F/X and
production design wasted.)</P>
<P>A final note to the screenwriters - when you kill the monster the first time,
leave it dead, please. "Hollow Man" is yet another example of a film where the
monster, beyond all reason, does not die, no matter what the hero does. Here,
Sebastian is blasted by searing flame, then electrocuted but he just keeps on
coming. The same gaff was seen in the recent, "What Lies Beneath." There the
monster wouldn't die either. The cheap shocks get tired.</P>
<PRE>I give "Hollow Man" a C-.</PRE>
