<P>Ordinarily, I wouldn't give a second thought to the dunderheads that
think the world will end with the onset of the new millennium.  But who
was counting on two G-rated films being among the best of this year's
releases?  Scarier yet is the fact that both films were directed by two
of the last people you would ordinarily associate with a G-rated film -
David Mamet (The Winslow Boy) and here, David Lynch's The Straight
Story.  Mamet's forte seems to be cramming as many expletives into a
film as humanly possible, while Lynch's films are a mélange of adult
language, kinky sex, gratuitous violence and deranged characters.  The
Straight Story is a different story altogether.</P>
<P>Story begins with several shots of a small Midwestern town - houses,
people, businesses, landscapes.  Since Lynch is involved in the project,
I held my breath waiting for the camera to pan down and reveal a
detached body part laying in a field (a la Blue Velvet).  But it doesn't
happen.  The film's protagonist is 73-year-old Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), a kindly old codger with bad hips, diabetes and emphysema. 
Despite his declining physical health, Straight refuses his doctor's
advice, rebuffing the need for surgery, tests, x-rays and the use of a
walker.  Straight is a widower and lives with his slow-witted daughter
Rose (Sissy Spacek, Blast From the Past).</P>
<P>When he gets news that his estranged brother Lyle has suffered a stroke,
Straight decides at once that he needs to visit his sibling in
Wisconsin.  With no car, a mentally challenged daughter, failing
eyesight and the inability to walk more than a few steps at a time,
Straight begins the trip from Laurens, Iowa to Wisconsin the only way he
can - on his riding lawnmower.  The trip takes many weeks and Straight
encounters the typical road-movie hazards along the way, including
breakdowns, hitchhikers, inclement weather and traffic accidents.  As he
chomps on cold hot dogs, he slowly waves to slack-jawed onlookers that
don't seem sure whether to laugh, salute or wave back.</P>
<P>Probably best known for his Oscar-nominated performance in the Alan J.
Pakula western Comes a Horseman, Farnsworth gives one of the year's best
and most heartfelt performances, and is destined for year-end
recognition.  His Straight is reminiscent of Peter Fonda's
Oscar-nominated turn in Ulee's Gold, with both mature characters going
to any length to preserve their family in films that take their time to
unravel.  Spacek is memorable as the birdhouse-building Rose and could
also garner accolades if Disney gives the film a big marketing push. 
But Story could be overshadowed by the Mouse House's unusual number of
Oscar-contenders this year, including The Sixth Sense and The Insider. 
Each is capable of receiving multiple nods.</P>
<P>Lynch's (Lost Highway) direction has never been better than it is here,
reminding viewers how much can be said with long shots, a good score and
minimal dialogue.  He more than effectively portrays the severity of
Straight's physical condition, as well as just how slowly his lawnmower
travels down the long, country roads.  And speaking of the score, it's
amazing.  Longtime Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti crafts one
beautiful melody after another, using more guitars in Story that we're
used to hearing from the composer.  The film is wisely set in the fall,
so viewers will be treated to lush, colorful scenery that seems to burst
off of the screen.  Another old-timer, 82-year-old cinematographer
Freddie Francis (an Oscar winner for Glory) provides the beautiful
visuals.  Remarkably, the film is based on a true story and is adapted
by debut screenwriters John Roach and Mary Sweeney, the latter also
serving as the film's editor.</P>
