<PRE>Fallen (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 31 January 1998 for $8 with Lynne and Sandy at the UA Continental
Twin in Forest Hills</P>
<P>*Fallen* is a bit of a cross between *The Prophecy* and *The Hidden*.
*Fallen* begins with Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) visiting
the death row cell of a vicious killer he was instrumental in snaring. The
killer is unusual--as if they weren't unusual already; he mutters
something incomprehensible, and definitely gives the impression that the
struggle is not over. Early on in the movie, we learn that Hobbes is an
honorable cop. He cannot be bribed, and he is devoted to his work and to
his family, which comprises a somewhat addled brother and young nephew. </P>
<P>Soon after the prisoner meets his end in the gas chamber, copycat murders
occur that start to incriminate Hobbes himself. Some clues by the killer
and some independent research (the strange mutterings were ancient Syrian
Aramaic) lead Hobbes to realize that a similar string of killings
happened 30 years before to another honorable cop. A visit to the man's
grown-up daughter--Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz)--proves that something
weird and usual is afoot. </P>
<P>It turns out that the killer is not a person but the spirit of an angry
angel named Azazel, a malevolent spirit thousands of years old who can
jump from being to being and that makes him/it very hard to find. </P>
<P>Now, if you can go along with this premise, you are halfway to enjoying
this low-key thriller. That was my problem with the movie. It was pretty
slow-moving for a thriller, which is a shame since all the elements are
there for it to be a bit more, well, thrilling. In fact, my brother dozed
off more than once. </P>
<P>*Fallen* clearly is influenced by the recent upswing in supernatural
thriller shows like *The X Files* and *Millenium*. Watching Washington
unravel the supernatural mystery while being stalked by a vengeful spirit
who can be anyplace is interesting, although sometimes finding information 
about Azazel is too convenient and less than credible. </P>
<P>The best scenes in the movie is the one in which Azazel jumps from person
to person. One takes place right in the police precinct, and then out on
the street. The better one though is the one in which Azazel chases Gretta
when he figures out she knows about him. It is the only really
spine-tingling scene in the movie. *Fallen*'s premise requires a lot more
action than it delivers. </P>
<P>Director Gregory Hoblit does a good job of keeping a creepy atmosphere
going, and picks some downright dingy neighborhoods of nighttime
Philadelphia to do this. Overall, the movie is a bit sluggish, though, and
it is hard not to see why, when you consider the story and the cast.
Denzel Washington plays his role low-key. His co-stars are John Goodman
(talk about sluggish) and Donald Sutherland, and the rest are not
particularly noteworthy or familiar. Lynne points out, "As always, Donald
Sutherland is a problem." And he is. His performance and role are the
most out of place. Hobbes is a star officer under his command; why he
chooses to put him down constantly is not explained, and doesn't fit with
the rest of the movie. </P>
<P>So, *Fallen* is not a bad movie, but it really might not be worth $8. It's
a good bet for a video rental, though. Add a star if you really love the
lyric "ti-i-i-me is on my side, yes it is." You'll hear it throughout the
movie. </P>
