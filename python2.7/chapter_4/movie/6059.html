<P>     SMALL FACES, Gillies MacKinnon's first feature after turning away 
from Hollywood (his previous film, A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE, was the SILAS 
MARNER modernization starring Steve Martin), brings the director back to 
the kind of small, personal story he feels most comfortable with.  
According to MacKinnon, while in Hollywood, "I began to have a sense of 
losing roots... as if my strength was drawn from something within my 
past, that I was moving away from that and I had to go back."</P>
<P>     In examining SMALL FACES, three things stand out.  The first is 
that, despite a fairly unambitious storyline, the film retains a large 
element of unpredictability.  Because it eschews cliches and formulas 
typical to "coming of age" stories, it's difficult for the viewer to 
guess what's going to happen and how certain situations will be 
resolved.  Secondly, when the movie ended, I was a little disappointed -
- not because there's anything inherently dissatisfying about the 
conclusion, but because I would have enjoyed spending more time with 
these characters.  Finally, despite the accents, this isn't another 
TRAINSPOTTING.  </P>
<P>     SMALL FACES opens in 1968 Glasgow and introduces us to the brothers 
MacLean.  There are three of them:  thirteen year old Lex (Ian 
Robertson), who's our guide through the story; sixteen year old Alan 
(Joseph McFadden), an introspective, budding artist; and eighteen year 
old Bobby (J.S. Duffy), an illiterate ruffian who runs with a gang.  The 
boys' father is dead, so they live alone with their mother, Lorna 
(Claire Higgins).  As gang warfare intensifies in Govanhill, Lex and 
Alan are unwittingly drawn into the conflict because of their brother's 
association, and they soon find themselves caught between the sadistic 
leader of Bobby's group, Charlie Sloan (Garry Sweeney), and the head of 
the rival Tongs, Malky Johnson (Kevin McKidd).</P>
<P>     SMALL FACES starts out oddly.  The first twenty minutes are jumpy 
and disjointed, and, at times, it's difficult to sort out characters and 
circumstances.  Once we've resolved the complexities of Lex's home life 
and the nature of the gang friction (not to mention who's in which 
gang), things clear up considerably, and MacKinnon's story begins to 
flow.  Lex is a splendid lead character:  smart, stubborn, and 
passionate, yet, largely because of his age, impotent in the face of the 
wave of violence that threatens to drown his family.</P>
<P>     SMALL FACES gets the details right, which is largely why it works.  
Small, apparently-innocent actions, like firing a pellet gun, set major 
events in motion.  Seemingly unimportant characters, like Lex's older 
friend, Gorbals (Mark McConnochie), play critical roles.  Alan's 
relationship with a local girl is developed perfectly, with an eye 
towards realism rather than sentimentality.  And there are several 
stark, memorable images like a streak of crimson on a background of 
white ice after a bloody body has been dragged across it.</P>
<P>     Other than Claire Higgins, who does a fine job portraying a mother 
who can't protect her sons, the major players are relative unknowns.  
Ian Robertson's performance as Lex reflects the reality of being 
thirteen -- he thinks he's brave and smart enough to do anything until 
the time comes for him to take action.  As Alan, Joseph McFadden 
fashions a sympathetic character -- a somewhat naive boy who wants 
nothing to do with the violence around him, but who can't escape it.  
Then there's Laura Fraser, the strikingly appealing actress to play 
Alan's girlfriend, Joanne.</P>
<P>     SMALL FACES shows the personal, often-tragic toll of gang violence.  
Though it takes place during another decade in another country, 
MacKinnon's movie has universal implications.  For, while the causes of 
such violence may differ from culture to culture, the inevitable 
consequences, both physical and emotional, are familiar.  We can 
identify with what these characters are feeling.  Ultimately, this movie 
is less about the situation than the people who are trapped by it, and 
that simple, human element provides SMALL FACES with its core strength.</P>
