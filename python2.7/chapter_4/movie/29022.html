<P>PLOT:
They're baaaaaack! Only this time the American loudmouth police officer is in
the ass-kicking Chinese police officer's backyard, Hong Kong. There are some bad
guys, lotsa fights, lotsa jokes and that's pretty much all you need to know.
Have a blast!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
First things first...do you think that Chris Tucker is a funny guy? If the
answer to that question is a resounding "no", then don't even bother reading the
rest of this review or seeing this movie because you seriously gotta appreciate
the man's humor if you're going to see this movie in the first place. Alright,
now as for the rest of you, be prepared to have yourselves a b-b-blast with this
picture, as Tucker goes gonzo with his motormouth and doesn't shut up until
you're pissing all over yourself in the aisles. Talk about a "laugh a minute"
movie! Ironically, I went into this picture thinking that its best jokes were in
the trailer, but five minutes into this puppy, I knew that I was in for an
all-around good time. But don't you dare go in expecting originality, dramatic
entanglements or emotional attachments to the characters, because that ain't
what this movie's about.</P>
<P>It's actually one of the "easiest" movies that I've had to watch all year, one
that left me beaming when I left the theater (especially since the outtakes are
almost as funny and cool as the film itself) and still smiling when I thought
back to some of Tucker's one-liners (some of his facial expressions alone
cracked me up!). The film is basically this: Tucker makes jokes, Chan kicks ass,
Ziyi Zhang looks great...repeat...Tucker makes jokes, Chan kicks, Ziyi Zhang
looks great. So if you liked the first film, I see no reason why you wouldn't
enjoy this round of fluff either. They've even slapped some different locations
in this one like Hong Kong and Vegas, and a nifty little cameo by the way of Don
Cheadle (kung-fu master!). The film also flies by at a quick 90 minutes and
rarely slows down to take a break. So as long as you don't go in expecting to
save the world when you come out, you will surely be entertained, especially if
you dig on Tucker's humor because he is all over this one! Damn dude, I started
clapping all by myself at some point...wtf?! Fun shtuff!</P>
