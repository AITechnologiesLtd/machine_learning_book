<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Ron Decker (Furlong) is a minor dealer in marijuana, but he gets
sentenced to a severe term of five years. He is thrown into a hardened
prison environment, where gangs are broken down according to ethnic
groups: black, Puerto Rican, or white. For his protection, the soft kid
who looks like he's from the suburbs, seeks the help of the white gang
leader, Earl Copen (Dafoe).</P>
<P>The question raised, is whether the political climate is so paranoid
that it doesn't understand the difference between violent criminals and
nonviolent drug criminals, who make up a large percent of the
overcrowded prison population. Apparently, the judicial system has
broken down, so much so that it can't satisfy the political electorate
who want stiffer punishment and those who want more of an emphasis on
education and counseling programs for the nonviolent offenders.</P>
<P>Through Decker's suburban eyes we get the picture of how prison looks to
someone like him, who is a fish out of water. He has to be constantly
fearful because he is now in a world where violence is the name of the
game. He has to watch out that he is not gang raped or drawn into a
fight or have someone pull a shank on him. A Puerto Rican gang wants to
rape him and, even though, he tries to keep a low-profile, he is under
constant scrutiny by all the prisoners. He has to learn how to conduct
himself while in prison, so he is not considered a punk. Earl, who
treats him as if he were his son and represses his desire to rape the
beautiful kid, as he tells him no one can take a chance and be without
protection from friends while in prison these days.</P>
<P>Earl is his mentor, as he shows him how to adjust to prison life. After
being in this prison for 18 years, he knows everything about it and runs
it like it was his turf. Earl has befriended the prison guard Lt. Seeman
(Cassel) and has connections with the convicts who have key jobs in the
prison, and can get weapons and drugs whenever he wishes. Earl tells him
that the trick to doing the time is to get a good job and live in the
right cell, and not get labeled as a punk. That bad name, once gotten,
stays with you no matter what prison you go to.</P>
<P>The prison atmosphere of hostility, constant danger, noise, and
inhumanity, was fully captured, as the film had the gritty, realistic
look of a prison. The film was shot in Holmsburg State Prison,
Pennsylvannia. The convicts looked scary, the prison looked real, and
the feeling of despair was the only air that was present, as
rehabilitation seemed to be a farce, a show that one puts on to score
clemency points from the judges.</P>
<P>Decker is having a tough time surviving, even with the savvy help from
Earl, who was once an angry convict but always had a tender spot for the
right person. His help is altruistic; he does it because he sees the
injustice of the system and lives vicariously through this kid, thinking
that maybe he can have more of chance than he ever had.</P>
<P>As Decker uses Earl's knowledge of the law to appeal his case, two
troubling incidents in the prison show him that it will be impossible
for him to get his sentence reduced. A black con in the shower attacks
him with a razor and slashes his face, and later on the con is found
dead in the garbage truck; and, a hillbilly prisoner in for raping an
elderly woman, Buck (Arnold), tries to rape him in the bathroom. In
retaliation, Decker gets a shank and puts it into Buck's back. In the
hospital Buck spills the beans on Decker and Earl puts out the word to
get him, so Buck's IV is poisoned with cleaning fluid and he dies in the
hospital.</P>
<P>Seeing no other alternative but escaping from prison, Earl works out a
plan for them to escape in the garbage trucks.</P>
<P>The acting was just fine. Furlong plays his part with trepidation,
knowing that he has arrived in hell and that he is ill prepared for it.
Dafoe with a shaved head, convincingly has the moves down pat of a
hardened convict, knowing all the angles needed to make prison like his
home, Mickey Rourke has a flamboyant part as a cross-dressing prison
queen, amusingly offering his take on things to his impressionable cell
mate Furlong.</P>
<P>The film had the right message to deliver about the stupidity of the
current drug laws and the horrors of prison life. I don't know if anyone
seriously believes anymore that the prisons can be a place of
rehabilitation. The film does a very good job in bringing this out and
creating an entertaining picture because of the fine performances. But
it also seemed to stage everything in the story to weigh heavily into
what its message was. The film didn't feel like it was freely flowing
along, and because of that the story floundered at times.</P>
