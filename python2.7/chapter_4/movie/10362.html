<PRE>Review by R. L. Strong</PRE>
<P>Corey Yuen's latest film, "HERO" is notable on two fronts. First this is
the film to bring back the Shaw Brothers Studio back to the forefront of
film production. Secondly, the film is the re-discovery of Yuen Biao.</P>
<P>The film opens around the end of the Qin dynasty, when many immigrants
were making their way to Shanghai. Poverty and crime rule most of China.
A young man, Ma Wing Jing and his brother enter the fabled city and
become laborers at the pier. Tam See is the most powerful gangster in
town, having control of the center of the city and having an alliance
with the British Army. Wing Jing and See become friends during a
confrontation. Their friendship grows as both men start to realize their
dreams, Wing Jing's to be a powerful and wealthy man, and See to settle
down with a woman he can truly love.</P>
<P>Wing Jing meets the singer at the club (Jessica Hester) and falls in
love with her, not realizing that she is the star attraction. After
stealing her picture from a display, Wing Jing and his brother plot to
impress her. First they rob two foreigner's of their money and cloths,
and set up a midnight rendezvous. Unfortunately, Wing Jing has run afoul
of a rival gangster, Yeung Seung who has bribed the police in an effort
to gain control of See's night club. The two bothers are arrested and
held until they manage to escape just before dawn. Jessica, having
waited outside in the cold with her manager all night, gives up and
returns home. </P>
<P>See decides to retire, he gives the night club to Wing Jing, as
repayment for saving his life during an attempted murder. See arranges
the trade and ask his lover (Valerie Chow) to take care of Wing Jing.
Unfortunately, she has sided with Yeung Seung.</P>
<P>The performances in the film are all top notch, with fine turns by
Takeshi Kaneshiro as Ma Wing Jing and Jessica Hester and Valerie Chow.
The comic turn by Yuen Wah, previously known as the mad Vietnamese in
Samo Hung's "EASTERN CONDORS", is a marvelous surprise. His gift for
comedy is marvelously understated and hilarious. The stand-out is by
Yuen Biao who returns to the screen after a string of disappointments,
with a stellar performance. His Tam See is a Triad boss who knows that
his time is coming to an end but still has the cunning and craft to
uphold his pride. His gangster is almost non-violent, in that he only
retaliates, never instigates violence. But when the time comes to fight,
Yuen Biao has never looked better.</P>
<P>Corey Yuen directs the film with a maturity and a sense of pacing that
has been lacking in Hong Kong movies as of late. The lighting,
cinematography and staging of the film are beautiful to watch. The
action scenes do not disappoint either. This is the most aggressive and
inventive martial art choreography I've seen in some time, actually
surpassing Jackie Chan's work in both 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'First
Strike'. The special effects team deserves praise for a fantastic job of
making the impossible look possible. An early fight between Takeshi
Kaneshiro and Yuen Biao on the back of a horse is to be seen to be
believed. Also noteworthy is the score for the film, done in a
marvelously lush orchestral style, not representative of most Hong Kong
fare. I would dare to say it ranks as high as the scores for both
"Titanic" and "Rosewood" as best of the year.</P>
<P>All in all, "HERO" marks a grand return to filmmaking for Shaw Brothers.
This is the film that gives us faith that Hong Kong cinema is alive and
flourishing.</P>
