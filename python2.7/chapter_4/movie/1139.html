<PRE>                                    WHORE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1991 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  In spite of a poor critical reception,
     WHORE is one of Ken Russell's better films.  It is one
     realistic and degrading day in the life of a prostitute.  The
     film is often ugly and bitter, sometimes funny, and almost
     never erotic.  It is a far cry from Ken Russell's earlier
     film about prostitution, CRIMES OF PASSION.  Rating: +2 (-4
     to +4).</PRE>
<P>     When the subject of a film is sex, don't trust my opinion.  Generally
what the critics like, I don't.  I thought SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE was dry and
dull.  The characters bored me.  Yet the film was almost universally
applauded by the critics.  Generally I am not very impressed by films about
sex.  Also I am not keen on Ken Russell.  Russell is more interested in
putting strange images on the screen than he is in telling a story.  With
the exception of THE DEVILS and LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM, ken Russell and I
don't seem to agree on what makes a good film.  WHORE is a Ken Russell film
about sex and prostitution that has gotten a thumbs-down from most of the
critics.  That is three strikes against the film.  Who knows what possessed
me to see the film?  Yet once the film started I was totally engrossed by
what I was seeing.  Admittedly it is cartoonish and some of the scenes do
not work.  Occasionally Theresa Russell out-and-out misreads lines.  Yet
there is an undeniable narrative vitality here.  Theresa Russell is a frank
and vulgar prostitute telling us about her profession as she sees it.  If
some of her stories seem contrived, it is because that is the way she
remembers them.</P>
<P>     The film covers a single day in the life of Liz, a prostitute.
Initially the film seems nearly plotless.  It appears to be just a portrait
of the world of the streetwalker.  The portrait is pieced together form
unconnected incidents punctuated by Liz explaining to the audience what she
is thinking and feeling.  By the end of the film we are no longer sure that
we have not crossed over into a story that Liz is telling herself.  Much of
the narrative is in Liz's mind and memory anyway.  She speaks directly to
the camera and it becomes her confidante throughout the day.  She tells the
camera her past: a horribly failed marriage, how she got into the business
of prostitution, how she got a pimp--perhaps more accurately how he got her.
And we see a cross-section of customers from gentle to vicious.  Ken Russell
does have an eye for the ugly!</P>
<P>     WHORE seems to a sort of penance on the part of director Ken Russell.
His 1984 CRIMES OF PASSION was probably the most positive view of
prostitution since IRMA LA DOUCE.  Kathleen Turner as China Blue found
prostitution a creative and fulfilling art that blesses her that gives and
him that gets.  In the seven years since that film it looks as if someone
has been talking to Russell.  In WHORE prostitution is a living death of
being manipulated, lied to, and beaten.  Russell drags in every vulgar
symbol of sexuality he can muster, yet avoids being erotic.  This is a film
well-suited to the NC-17 rating.</P>
<P>     WHORE is an adaptation of a play by David Hines, an English taxi driver
who patched together a play based on stories he'd heard from prostitutes who
had been his customers.  Even as third-hand stories, much of what we have
seen is told with skill and ower.  I give WHORE a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
