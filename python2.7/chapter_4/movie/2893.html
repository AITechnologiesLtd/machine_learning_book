<PRE>                             PRINCESS CARABOO
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Phoebe Cates stars in a fact-based
     tale told with an almost storybook style.  A mysterious
     Pacific island Princess who shows up wandering in 1817
     England.  She soon becomes the subject of fame and
     controversy.  Michael Austin creates a light comedy-
     drama that is more about a 19th Century England with a
     thirst for exotic land.  Kevin Kline's role may have
     been pasted into the script, but it is the best in the
     film.  The film is a little on the fluffy side.  Rating:
     +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     1817 in England was during a time of great awakening in England.
The recently ended Napoleonic Wars had brought an awareness that there
was a lot of world beyond the shores of Britain.  Coleridge and Byron
wrote about exotic lands and the aristocracy hungered to know more of
faraway lands with poetic names.  And in the midst of this craze for
the foreign and exotic, Princess Caraboo shows up wandering in a field
near an English village.  The turbanned Caraboo speaks an unknown
language, writes in totally unknown pictograms, and has seems to have
fashion tastes molded on some Pacific Island or someplace in Asia.  She
is adopted by the affluent Mrs. Worrall (Wendy Hughes) and her less
charitable husband (Jim Broadbent).  Little by little the Princess's
story comes out of how she was kidnapped by pirates and managed to
escape from them off the coast of England.  But nobody is sure if the
story is true or a fraud.</P>
<P>     Michael Austin's film is not so much about the title character but
about the phenomenon and controversy that surrounded her appearance.
The mysterious woman's fame soon spreads across England.  Some believe
her to be a Javanese princess, others believe her just a woman with a
vivid imagination.  But many of the experts who first doubt her are
confounded by the evidence that she is the genuine article.</P>
<P>     Phoebe Cates is the Princess who acts like Asian royalty, but
Cates herself just does not look Asian enough to be convincing.  In an
interview at the Montreal Film Festival Michael Austin said that he
first cast Phoebe Cates and since her husband Kevin Costner [sic] came
along to tend their baby, the director gave him a part in the film
also.  Actually Kevin Kline really grabs the attention of the audience
as Frixos, the Greek dandy who is the Worrall's insolent butler.  As an
early and overly candid sceptic of Caraboo his role is a comic gem.
What was probably a minor or even non-existent role expanded just for
his talents becomes the most engaging characterization in the film.
Wendy Hughes is a good actress, but this film does not give sufficient
depth to her character.  Perhaps it was pushed aside by the Kline role,
but she is a little too sweet and understanding, a bit too good to be
true.  Jim Broadbent has more to do as Mr. Worrall who married into the
aristocracy without any touch of nobility.  Stephen Rea is Gutch, who
narrates the story.  As a newspaperman Gutch is romantically attracted
to Caraboo but also feels a responsibility to investigate the truth of
her story.  John Lithgow rounds out the cast as a linguistic expert won
over in multiple ways by the princess.</P>
<P>     A film with Freddie Francis's camerawork will always be worth
seeing.  His work goes back at least to THE INNOCENTS and his feel for
creating a period atmosphere in films like THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S
WOMAN is always excellent.  Under Austin's direction his images here
have more of a storybook feel than usual.  But we do get a look at
village life from the fancy manors to the town square with its ale
houses and gibbets.  The score by Richard Hartley often has majestic
moments but is not memorable on first hearing.</P>
<P>     The film is a light enjoyable look at an England that rarely is
shown in historical films.  It is short at 96 minutes, but also sweet.
I give it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
