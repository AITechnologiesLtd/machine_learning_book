<PRE>What Women Want (2000)</PRE>
<P>Want to be satisfied that you got your money's worth out of a movie?  The 
striking thing about Nancy Meyers' WHAT WOMEN WANT is that as a romantic 
comedy, it gets the job done.</P>
<P>No, it's not important or profound, and it does not even have a solid 
ending.  But for the 126-minute run of WHAT WOMEN WANT, I was entertained.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson is to be admired for trying his hand at so many different genres. 
  So well known for his epic revenge films BRAVEHEART and this past summer's 
THE PATRIOT, as well as for the LETHAL WEAPON series, Gibson here takes the 
chance at failing at the risky chemistry of romance.  But he does not fail.  
In its initial minutes the film does a nice job of explaining Nick Marshall 
– Gibson's character:  he's a misogynistic pig, a politically incorrect 
relic whom women find irresistible.  We discover that he was raised by a 
mother who was a showgirl in Las Vegas, and he grew up surrounded by 
situations demeaning to women.  This does not excuse his behavior as an 
adult, of course, but seems to predict a noticeable change in his sexist 
persona by picture's end.</P>
<P>A star at Sloan Curtis Advertising in Chicago, Nick is divorced (the small 
part of his ex played by Lauren Holly), and has a 15 year-old daughter 
(Ashley Johnson).  He's not been much of a dad, though the artifice of his 
daughter staying with him for a while sets him up finally to spend time with 
her.</P>
<P>What jolts him out of complacency is Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), who is 
hired by Mr. Wanamaker as the new creative director of the ad agency.  (Alan 
Alda does one of the many cameos, as Wanamaker – a wonderfully fluent 
performance.)  So the stud Marshall has to play second banana to this 
younger woman.</P>
<P>One of the factors responsible for the fluff factor is the premise of 
reading women's minds.  For some reason involving fate and electricity, Nick 
is electrocuted – though not fatally – and acquires this at first 
overwhelming talent.  Of course his life changes drastically, as he adjusts 
to the weirdness;  Meyers makes ingenious use of the idea, especially when 
Nick is bombarded by the inner worlds of every female he comes across, even 
the mental minutia of a French poodle!  Once he can cope, will Nick use the 
power for good or evil – or both?  It certainly does not make for a 
believable movie, but it is an interesting one, a story which would 
fascinate James Thurber or other writers preoccupied with the `war' between 
men and women.</P>
<P>One gripe I have is the film's over-exposure.  I have seen theatrical 
trailers at least five times in the past two months, and countless 
television ads.  A problem here is that contemporary previews give away so 
many of the best parts of the film.  What's worst is that a key word from 
the script (by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa) is actually changed – cleaned 
up, I suppose – before the clip was run on TV.  It would have been nice to 
see some more surprises among the memorable moments.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson is becoming very proficient at his craft.  He carries so many 
scenes here with his dogged attitude and good humor.  In scenes in which he 
clowns to a Sinatra song, flipping a fedora from his foot onto his noggin, 
Gibson is charming.  Ditto when he dances with a coat rack.  But he is still 
no Cary Grant.  Gibson's timing is good enough, though he seems uneasy in a 
few scenes.  No star is worth more than 20 million dollars a picture, so 
there is no question here, but this star does turn in a solid performance.</P>
<P>And so does Helen Hunt.  Although director Meyers permits the camera to 
linger a bit long on Hunt's aquiline face during her reaction shots, and the 
script gives her the word `OK' to utter too many times (as she did in AS 
GOOD AS IT GETS, in which she also dated an older man!), Hunt registers 
another reliable performance here.</P>
<P>A subplot with Lola (Marisa Tomei) goes just about nowhere.  It's funny that 
I did not blame Nick Marshall for leading on Lola – at the same time he was 
falling in love with Darcy.  It occurs to me now too that Nick could have 
been portrayed as more conniving as he undermined Darcy's authority in her 
new job, even stealing her ideas.  Instead, Nick comes off as a rather 
benign rascal; even his daughter's girlfriends like him after he tailors his 
behavior upon hearing their mental condemnations.</P>
<P>Good Christmas season fare: that's WHAT WOMEN WANT.  It's a lark and a 
laugh, nothing heavyweight – though neither is it mindless pap.  Like the 
commercialized products you see around this time of year, the film has had 
any substance removed to please the most general audience</P>
