<P>With the title _Dog_Park_, this unremarkable romantic comedy sets itself
up for the easy play on words.  Comments such as "It's a dog" or "It's
bark is worse than its bite" would be fitting if the film had some bark,
let alone bite, to begin with--while not a good film, _Dog_Park_ is much
too gentle to inspire any dramatic reaction on either end of the opinion
spectrum.</P>
<P>The gentleness mostly comes from its lead characters--a fact that is, of
course, hardly a bad thing.  Luke Wilson is quite likable as average joe
classifieds writer Andy, who is smarting from his recent break with his
ex, Cheryl (Kathleen Robertson).  Natasha Henstridge, heretofore best
known for doffing her clothes through two _Species_ films, is equally as
winning as Lorna, a children's TV hostess also coming off of a bad
breakup.  Andy and Cheryl meet in a singles bar one night and hit it off.
 Is it all smooth sailing from here on out for the pair?  Of course not,
for there is still a good 75 minutes left in the film.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, writer-director Bruce McCulloch (who also co-stars) does
not come up with terribly convincing reasons for these two to remain
apart as long as they do.  One big reason for Lorna's reluctance to go
forward is the fact that the one night with Andy ended in embarrassment
for her, yet Andy forgives it so nice about it that one can't help but
wonder what her problem is.  This is highlighted when she decides to go
on a date with a loser she meets at a video store (Harland Williams).</P>
<P>The main pick-up spot in the film is not the video store, however, but
the dog park, where Andy and Cheryl spend time with the dog of whom they
share custody, Mogley--and, of course, where Lorna takes out her beloved
canine companion, Peanut.  As it turns out, Andy and Lorna also share the
same dog psychologist/trainer, played with maximum oddness by Mark
McKinney.  Offbeat touches such as that character lend the film its only
hint of edge.</P>
<P>And therein lies the problem.  _Dog_Park_'s soft quality makes it easy
enough to watch, but as with many things that are "nice," it doesn't
exactly make it memorable.  When the famously acerbic Janeane Garofalo
makes her first appearance as Jeri, Andy's editor/best friend, one's
hopes that she could put some of her usual zing into the thing and bring
it to life are soon dashed when McCulloch makes her play nice, too--also
erasing any hopes that the film will rise above its conventions.</P>
<P>Garofalo is also called on to play nice in a completely different film,
_Blade_Runner_ writer Hampton Fancher's introspective, deliberately paced
thriller _The_Minus_Man_.  But her turn as Ferrin, a sweet small-town
postal worker (!) who falls for friendly co-worker and new guy in town
Vann (Owen Wilson, Luke's brother, as it is) works better in this
context.  Perhaps that's because the mood here is not one of niceness but
of evil and dread, for Vann isn't exactly the nice guy he seems--in fact,
he's an unusually affable serial killer, who poisons people whom he feels
are better off dead.  </P>
<P>The cast is perfect; along with Garofalo and Wilson--whose low-key,
innocuous presence makes for an eerie fit--solid performances are given
by Brian Cox, Mercedes Ruehl, and, in her acting debut, Sheryl Crow.  The
film has been marketed as a big conversation piece, and, indeed, many
questions are raised throughout its running time.  But it's that quality
that is ultimately the film's undoing; too many pieces of the puzzle are
left out in what comes off as a rather strained and obvious attempt to
leave things up for discussion.  Most viewers, I suspect, won't really
want to go through the effort to talk it out, for there's really really
no point in doing it.</P>
