<PRE>                               PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Doug Furney
                        Copyright 1994 Doug Furney</PRE>
<P>     Profanity, violence, and pop culture references abound in  PULP
FICTION, the new movie by Quentin Tarantino.  Some may know Tarantino
as the screenplay writer for TRUE ROMANCE or the writer-director of the
critically acclaimed RESERVOIR DOGS, and just like those previous
efforts the heart of PULP FICTION lies in Tarantino's brilliantly
written conversations among the various characters.  Dialogue fuels
PULP FICTION to vividly show the contemptible lives of each character.
Tarantino has the gift of propelling the movie along through the
spoken word, whereas lesser creators might rely solely on action,
violence or special effects.  You should note that the movie is shown in
a non-linear time structure reminiscent of the critically acclaimed
independent film MYSTERY TRAIN, but this should not be an annoyance
because the movie is basically a series of three related vignettes
that individually add up to one great movie.</P>
<P>     Quentin Tarantino has gathered a diverse cast of actors to depict
the sordid and irredeemable characters that make up PULP FICTION.  John
Travolta and Bruce Willis both deliver surprisingly distinguished
performances.  Other notable cast members include Uma Thurman, Harvey
Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric
Stoltz, and  Rosanna Arquette.  However, the best performance in the
movie goes to Samuel L. Jackson who portrays the mobster Jules
Winnfield.  The character of Jules has some of the film's funniest and
most amusing lines, and he is the only character for whom there appears
to be a chance of redemption at film's end.  Although Jules may on
first impression seem to be a stereotypical 1970's black gangster
from   SUPERFLY, SHAFT or THE MACK; he is the only character who even
begins to develop a conscience and question his lifestyle.  From Lance
the drug dealer to Marcellus Wallace the mob boss,  PULP FICTION is
chock full of interesting characters portrayed by high profile actors
who each deliver effective performances.  Even in brief cameo
appearances Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel are memorable.</P>
<P>     The main focus during most of the movie is the interaction between
Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson),
two mob hitmen.  Their conversations, however trivial, are always
engaging and full of humor.  Vincent and Jules discuss everything from
European fast food to foot massages.  One of their more interesting
conversations takes place while they are cleaning up the interior of a
car in which Vincent accidentally shot a backseat passenger in the
face, creating something of a mess.</P>
<P>     Another high profile character is that of the double-crossing
boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis).  Butch is on the run from mob boss
Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and goes through quite an ordeal
retrieving a beloved family heirloom.  The scene involving Butch,
Marcellus and a couple of DELIVERANCE-inspired characters named Zed and
Maynard is rather brutal and most definitely disturbing.  Another
shocking scene involves Vincent Vega and Marcellus' wife Mia (Uma
Thurman).  After Mia overdoses on heroin that she mistakes for cocaine,
Vincent rushes her frantically to the house of his drug dealer, Lance
(Eric Stoltz).  The scene in which Vincent administers a shot of
adrenaline, through her breast plate, straight to Mia's heart is full
of tension and agonizing suspense.</P>
<P>     The stories that make up PULP FICTION are degenerate tales that
show tragic, pathetic and wasted lives.  Although this is true, the
movie is also very funny.  With this paradox Tarantino has produced a
movie that could be generally characterized as grotesque or Gothic.  In
this regard Tarantino is walking a thin line.  For the same reason that
one person finds the film amusing another person could see it as a
horrible tragedy.  Many parts of the movie conjure laughter and horror
often within the same scene, yet it is this ambiguity that makes the
film even more interesting.</P>
<P>     I highly recommended this film by one of today's brightest young
writers and directors.  Quentin Tarantino may not have reached the
status of Martin Scorcese, Oliver Stone, or Francis Ford Coppola as far
as their abilities for visual impact, but no one weaves a tale quiet
like Tarantino.  His abilities as a storyteller are cleverly enhanced
by his brilliant use of dialogue.  To Tarantino words are more
important than action, violence, sex, and other means aimed at shock
and controversy.  Tarantino will most likely be around awhile,
hopefully continuing with first rate work.  I would also encourage the
viewing of the Tarantino scripted TRUE ROMANCE and Tarantino's
directorial debut in RESERVOIR DOGS.  If you liked these two then
chances are you will enjoy his latest effort PULP FICTION, and if you
have never seen any of these films give one a chance.</P>
