<P>     In David Gordon Green's haunting feature debut GEORGE WASHINGTON,
there is no real story to speak of. Set in an unnamed town in the rural
American South, it's a quintessentially episodic film that follows a group
of adolescents and a few token adults over several summer days. The
narrator, Nasia (Candace Evanofski), is a 12-year-old African-American
girl who has just broken up with her 13-year-old boyfriend Buddy (Curtis
Cotton III) because she's looking for someone more mature. That someone
may be Buddy's friend George (Donald Holden), an introverted boy with a
congenitally soft skull that requires him to wear a helmet. In various
permutations, they hang out with their friends Vernon (Damian Jewan Lee)
and Sonya (Rachael Handy), as well as the workers at the local railyard
including Rico (Paul Schneider). They talk. They play. They argue.</P>
<P>     Actually, it's not accurate to say there's no story in GEORGE
WASHINGTON. It's more accurate to say there's no plot, because its story
is one of the year's most compelling, even when it occasionally lapses
into heavy-handedness. It has become something of a national pastime
trying to figure out what's wrong with American teens in the era of
Columbine, and plenty of films from RIVER'S EDGE to KIDS and onward have
tried to capture the aimlessness, amorality and anarchy of contemporary
adolescence. I don't think any one of them has captured the soul of
America's confused youth as effectively -- or with as much compassion --
as GEORGE WASHINGTON. It's the story of kids trying to find a moral
compass in a time when their childhood is becoming shorter and shorter.</P>
<P>     If such subject matter sounds like it could turn into pretentious
filmmaking, fear not. Though Green's early slow-motion shots may raise
fears that he's trying to make a Big Statement, he ultimately depends on
small statements. His cast of young non-professional actors, often
improvising around general story points, finds the truth of these
characters in dialogue so casual that its profundity comes as an
aftershock. A teenage girl comments that she want to get pregnant simply
because "she wants to be someone's mom;" Buddy talks about Nasia with a
precocious, almost ridiculous poetry; Nico converses with Buddy as though
they were peers, despite the boy's need for adult guidance. Even Nasia's
occasionally florid voice-over narration feels just right, the attempts of
a little girl to convey her worldliness. In its rambling,
no-particular-place-to-go rhythm, it's hypnotic viewing.</P>
<P>     It's also the most beautifully photographed film you're likely to see
this year. Tim Ott's cinematography captures the characters mostly
outdoors against the landscape, in both the lushness of local greenery and
the decay of abandoned industrial shells. Virtually every scene seems to
have been shot in some otherworldly twilight, so golden that they almost
hurt the eyes. The rare scenes shot indoors capture the grimness of the
characters' domestic lives, and one dark public restroom becomes the
film's unique vision of hell. When you're not busy wondering at the
naturalistic splendor of the performances, you'll be busy wondering at the
carefully constructed splendor of the visuals.</P>
<P>     GEORGE WASHINGTON's final half hour takes a turn toward other
thematic elements, as George attempts to re-define himself after a tragic
development. The transition isn't particularly smooth, but Green doesn't
appear particularly concerned with making his film a smooth experience.
Indeed, some of his editing and dialogue choices are so off-beat (like the
complete absence of profanity from its teenage characters) you can't help
but just let him carry you wherever he leads. Where he's leading is a
place hinted at in the film's title, a place where children are forced to
look backward for their heroes because there aren't any in their own
lives. Yes, indeed, GEORGE WASHINGTON does tell a story. If only more
films with plots could tell stories like this.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 floundering fathers:  9.</PRE>
