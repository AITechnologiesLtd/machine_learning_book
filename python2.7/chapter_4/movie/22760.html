<P>I am not a big fan of gross-out comedies, particularly teenage gross-out
comedies a la "Porky's" or the "Animal House" variety. Somehow, the idea that
teenagers having nothing more on their heads than sexual promiscuity is not
very appetizing. Well, sure, I was once a teenager myself, during the
Republican 80's, and I did think about sex, but there were other things on my
mind too. "American Pie" is about teens in the 90's, sharing their zestful
quest for losing their virginity on prom night. But I am convinced that sex is
not the only preoccupation facing teens of America. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, the film's opening sequence is a classic piece of raunchy humor.
Jim (Jason Biggs) is watching a porno channel that is barely registering on the
cable channel. But the channel's soundtrack is unmistakably clear, as Jim
fondles himself until his parents enter the room and are horrified by his
hormonal desires. He gets comical, expert advice from his father (hilariously
played by Eugene Levy), who buys him all the porno mags he needs to understand
sex. Still, Jim's curiousity gets to him when he is told that sex feels like
"warm, apple pie." </P>
<P>Jim is not the only teen in high school hung up on sex - so are all his
buddies, mostly lacrosse players. One player (the winsome Chris Klein from
"Election") is not all he's cracked up to be, and feels that he has real
sensitivity. He woos an intelligent choir girl (Mena Sevauri), who is taken by
his willingness to sing just to get close to her. </P>
<P>The Jerry Lewis-like Jim may not just be interested in sex, but he has a
predilection for its orgasmic innuendoes. In a triumphantly classic scene, Jim
broadcasts his bedroom antics with a sexy foreign exchange student on the
Internet. Only problem is that he is not aware this is being broadcast to the
whole high school community! Jim struts barechested while the voluptuous female
gets aroused by a skin magazine, and all the immature high-schoolers howl with
laughter. </P>
<P>"American Pie's" saving grace is that some of these kids are made to seem
human, unlike the cardboard cartoon characters of "Animal House" or any other
horny teen flick from the late 80's starring Corey Feldman. No, these kids are
sweet and human and, uh, oh, sensitive! Jim's one line about how a nerdy,
talkative band player (Alyson Hannigan) has something else to talk about
besides sex pretty much sums up the sensitivity factor. Naturally. it turns out
she wants to use Jim because of his lusty, Net activity. Jason Biggs, Chris
Klein and Mena Sevauri at least seem to come from the real world of teenagers,
but the burning question remains: is there more to life in high school than
sex? If you have seen "Election" or went to high school, you may be compelled
to agree that there is. </P>
