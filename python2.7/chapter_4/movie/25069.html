 Me, Myself & Irene (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Jim Carrey, Renee
Zellweger, Robert Forster, Chris Cooper, Anthony Anderson, Mongo
Brownlee, Jerod Mixon and Michael Bowman. Written by Peter Farrelly &
Mike Cerrone & Bobby Farrelly. Directed by Bobby Farrelly & Peter
Farrelly. Rated R.</P>
<P> The Farrelly brothers are insidious filmmakers. They force you to laugh
at situations and behavior that in real life you would feel guilty or
ashamed if you had a similar reaction.</P>
<P> That is the depraved genius of these two irrelevant guys. They appeal
to everyone''s lowest basic instinct. So, you laugh at a man tied to a
tree butt naked with a chicken's head stuck where the sun don't shine.</P>
<P> Or you laugh at three young black men with genius I.Q.s who talk and
curse as if they came from the meanest inner city ghetto in America. And
it's even funnier when their profanity is in German.</P>
<P> These are just some of the examples of bad taste that abound in "Me,
Myself & Irene," Jim Carrey's latest outing, and his first with the
Farrellys since "Dumb and Dumber."</P>
<P> Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates, a 17-year veteran of the Rhode Island
police force. He is a dedicated, nice guy, who lets everyone walk all
over him because he hates confrontation.</P>
<P> Even when he loses his wife who presented him with three black sons by
the black, midget chauffeur who drove them to their honeymoon cottage,
he maintains his composure and becomes a loving, doting father.</P>
<P> Carrey also plays Hank Baileygates, Charlie's ultra-aggressive
alter-ego. Hank loves confrontations, talking dirty, smoking and
fighting. He also is as honry as a rooster.</P>
<P> It seems that Baileygates suffers from Split Personality Disorder.
Now, schizophrenia is not funny. And people who suffer from it, as well
as their friends and relatives, may take offense at "Me, Myself &
Irene."</P>
<P> And I agree that such a disease is no laughing matter. But as portrayed
by Carrey and written by the Farrellys, with help from Mike Cerrone, no
one can really take Carrey or the way he presents this malady as a
serious look at the illness.</P>
<P> "Me, Myself & Irene" is just an exercise for more of Carrey's
rubber-faced antics and slapstick physical humor. And the Farrellys
offer Carrey plenty of opportunities for pratfalls as Hank continually
clobbers Charlie.</P>
<P> The movie's plot, which is only serviceable, has Charlie assigned to
convey an alleged hit-and-run driver from Rhode Island to upstate New
York.</P>
<P> His prisoner, Irene Walters (Renee Zellweger), was framed and was
running away from her mobster ex-boyfriend.</P>
<P> Actually, it's not important. What the movie boils down to is an
elongated chase with Charlie/Hank taking turns protecting and wooing
Irene, as well as Charlie/Hank fighting among himself for the young
woman's affections.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, Zellweger, a very good actress as evidenced by her
performances in "Jerry Maguire" and "One True Thing," seems adrift
basically playing straight woman to Carrey's carrying-ons.</P>
<P> She seems uncomfortable and unsure how to react to the madness going on
around her. Her performance is tentative and a bit weak.</P>
<P> The film's true scene-stealers are the three young men who portray
Carrey's grown-up sons: Anthony Anderson as Jamaal, Mongo Brownlee as
Lee Harvey and Jerod Mixon as Shonte Jr. Their interaction as they
profanely debate quantum physics or taunt each other about the
universities that accepted them are priceless.</P>
<P> Overall, the film's' pacing is a bit uneven and, at nearly two hours,
could have used some tighter editing.</P>
<P> "Me, Myself & Irene" is strictly low-brow, slip-on-a-banana-peel
comedy. Its purpose is to make you laugh, even if you chide yourself
later for doing so.</P>
