<PRE>HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In 1995, Terry McMillan's novel Waiting to Exhale opened up a new,
untapped, genre of film, the black women's movie.  Now, she and Exhale
co-writer Ron Bass have teamed up once again to adapt her novel, How
Stella Got Her Groove Back.  And with an excellent performance from
Angela Bassett, and some competent direction by Kevin Rodney Sullivan,
they've managed to create a thoroughly enjoyable romantic drama.</P>
<P>The Stella of the title is Stella Payne (Angela Bassett), a high-powered
wall street deal maker.  We never quite learn how she lost her groove,
except by her employment in the soulless money market.  However, she
begins to take steps toward her recovery when she goes on a Jamaican
holiday with her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg).</P>
<P>There, she meets Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), a resort employee who
is literally half her age.  Attracted to him at first on a purely
physical basis, and later on, well, a purely physical basis, Stella gets
romantically involved with the kid.</P>
<P>As the relationship continues, Stella must cope with her family (who
disapproves... her son (Michael J. Pagan) is closer to Winston's age
than she is), as well as difficulties at her job.  Will the love of this
pair of starcrossed lovers survive?</P>
<P>At least Stella and Winston make a cute, if slightly unbelievable,
couple. And the delightful performance of Angela Bassett makes you want
to root for anything which will make her happy.</P>
<P>The movie does get a bit excessive with a few unnecessary melodramatic
touches, and runs a bit longer than it should, but for the most part it
is  charming and endearing.</P>
<P>The supporting cast does well, with a strong performance by Whoopi, and
humorous turns from Regina King and Suzzanne Douglas as Stella's wayward
sisters. But the best supporting player has to be the island of Jamaica,
which steals every scene it is in with its stunning vistas.  The tourist
bureau couldn't ask for a better advertisement.</P>
<P>As a light romantic drama, How Stella Got Her Groove Back works
surprisingly well. And, as long as you ignore its attempts at being
deeper than it really is, you'll have a good time.</P>
