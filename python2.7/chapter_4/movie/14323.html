<P>        Director Steven Spielberg is one of the most successful men in
Hollywood.  His name is one of the most recognizable and his films are
some of the best known in history.  Jurassic Park, E.T., Raiders of
the Lost Ark, Jaws: all were done by him.  However, while most of
Spielbergs films are for mass entertainment, he also has shown the
ablility to make dramatic, moving films that are extremely powerful.
The two that spring immediately to mind are 1993s Schindlers List,
a story of the Holocaust, and 1997s Amistad, a tale of the horrors
of slavery.  Now, to this list we must add his latest effort, the
World War II epic, Saving Private Ryan.</P>
<P>        I hesitate to use the word masterpiece when describing a
film, because there are few movies that have been made that can
deservedly wear the title.  Saving Private Ryan is most definitely one
of those.  The film combines outstanding performances, excellent
direction, smart dialogue, and wonderful photography, locations, and
costumes and gives you an unforgettable two hours and forty-five
minutes.  When you emerge from the theater, you will be changed.  This
film hits you in the head, heart, and gut.  Weeks after you see it,
you will still be able to vividly recall scenes from the movie.</P>
<P>        The opening shot of this film is an American flag, fluttering
softly in the breeze.  Then we learn where the flag is.  It is flying
over the cemetery above Omaha Beach in Normandy, France.  For those of
you who are woefully uneducated, Omaha Beach was the scene of terrible
carnage on June 6, 1944 when Allied soldiers invaded in an attempt to
get through Hitlers Atlantic Wall.  We see an old man walking
through the cemetery.  Then, when he locates the grave hes looking
for, he falls to his knees and begins weeping.  From this point until
the end, when the last five minutes comes back to the present day in
the cemetery and we learn the old mans identity, the story takes
place during World War II.</P>
<P>        The next shots are of the beach and its foreboding defenses,
just minutes before landing.  Next, landing craft are seen, filled
with soldiers, speeding through the rough waters toward the beach.
Men become seasick and throw up.  Then, a pair of shaking hands are
seen as they screw the lid off a canteen.  The owner of the hands
takes a drink, and thus is introduced Captain John Miller, superbly
played by Tom Hanks, who should win another Best Actor Oscar. (This
film also deserves consideration for Best Picture, Best Director, Best
Supporting Actor, Best Orginal Dramatic Score, Best Costumes, and Best
Original Screenplay) Miller is the most intriguing character in the
movie.  As captain, he must put forth utmost confidence and never
waver or falter.  But, there are signs that he is slowly losing
control.  His hands shake uncontrolably at random, his eyes are those
of a person who has seen too much, and in one scene, he looks around
to make sure no one is watching and breaks down crying.  Also, there
is a very nice technique used by Spielberg, where all sound is reduced
to a dull roar and men seem to move in slow motion as Miller looks
bewilderedly around.  Clearly, the war is getting to him.</P>
<P>        He and his right hand man and best friend, Sergeant Michael
Horvath (Tom Sizemore), issue last minute instructions to the troops.
Then, as the saying goes, all hell breaks loose.  The ramps on the
landing craft go down and the men stumble forward into a barrage of
German machine gun fire.  The first five rows of men in the boats are
killed before they can get more than a step or two.  Soldiers dive
over the side of the boat, but their luck is no better.  Weighed down
by sixty pounds of equipment, many drown or are shot underwater.
Spielberg uses point of view shots in this scene to great effect.  He
lets you see from the German machine gunners point of view to let you
know that they could see exactly who they were shooting at.  The
Americans, by contrast, could only see concrete bunkers and sandbag
piles.  Spielberg also lets us see the American point of view.  These
shots are nothing less than brilliant.  The camera is used to make it
feel like you are a soldier scrambling up the beach.  It dips in the
water and rises out, shakes and whirls to give the effect of a man
stumbling and looking about.  This scene, which is thiry minutes of
pure carnage, has been called the most realistic battle scene ever
filmed.  While I cant say this if thats true, having never been in
combat myself, I can say this: Id be greatly shocked if it wasnt.
This isnt the battle scenes of the old John Wayne war movies.
Spielberg pulls no punches in his depiction of combat in this, or any
other battle scene.  Men are blown in half, blown into bits, arms are
shot off, legs are blown away, people burn alive, men are disemboweled
and decapitated.  They lie on the beach and scream and cry, and beg
for their mothers.  The incoming tide is turned deep red with blood.
It must be noted that this isnt horror movie gore.  Spielberg is
never exploitive in his depiction; he is simply honest.  Adjectives
flow from my mind in an attempt to describe this scene, and indeed the
rest of the movie.  Brutal, savage, visceral, raw, powerful,
unforgettable, amazing, and dramatic all come to mind.  Finally, after
what seems an eternity, Miller and the other men clear the beach and
gain a foothold.  The scene ends as it began, with Miller taking a
drink from his canteen. Quite a view, Sgt.  Horvath remarks.
Yes, it is, replies Miller as he looks down at the beach with
bodies strewn everywhere.</P>
<P>        We are then taken to a Washington office where a legion of
secretaries work at typing up the telegrams that will be used to
notify the families of the men killed in action.  Something is soon
discovered.  Three men, Pvts. Sean, Peter, and Daniel Ryan were all
killed in action within a week of each other.  That doesnt mean much
until you realize that the men are brothers.  To add to that, their
mother will be receving all three telegrams on the same day.  Also,
there is a fourth brother, Private James Ryan.  He was part of the
paratrooper force that parachuted in behind German lines the night
before D-Day.  His status and location are unknown.  He could be
alive, he could be dead.  All of this news quickly goes up through the
ranks, until it reaches the ears of Chief of Staff George C. Marshall.
General Marshall (Harve Presnell), has a letter written from Abraham
Lincoln to a Mrs. Bixby in Boston.  Mrs. Bixby lost all five of her
sons in the service of the Union Army in the Civil War.  When Marshall
hears the news, there is no question in his mind as to what must be
done.  He orders a squad of men to go into enemy territory and track
down Pvt. Ryan and bring him back home. Some of his advisors argue
against this, saying that James is most likely dead, and anyone sent
into enemy territory to find him, will probably die too.  Marshall,
remains adamant however.  We gain a sense that he has a noble,
detached view of war.  The viewers, having just witnessed the hellish
inferno that is war, know better.  Incidentally, the scene where
Mrs. Ryan receives the notification of her sons death is staged
without a bit of dialogue, but still works brilliantly.  We see her
watch with trepidation as the Army car pulls up her driveway, and
then, when a chaplin and an officer get out, she collapes in front of
them on her porch.</P>
<P>        Back to Normandy.  Miller reports to his superior officer
about a recent assignment he was given.  We see him gaze enviously at
the hot water for shaving, real food, and hot coffee the men behind
the lines have.  After taking his report, the superior officer hands
Miller another assignment.  It is, of course, to go save Private Ryan.
In addition to Miller and Sergeant Horvath, the squad also consists of
a cynical New Yorker, Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns), the Jewish Private
Mellish (Adam Goldberg), the Italian Pvt. Caparzo (Vin Diesel), the
Bible quoting Southern sniper, Pvt. Jackson (Barry Pepper), and the
medic, Wade (Giovanni Ribisi).  Also along is an interpreter, who is
the second most intriguing character in the film, Corporal Upham,
wonderfully portrayed by Jeremy Davies.  Upham has never seen combat,
in fact, he hasnt even held a rifle since basic t raining.  He is
along because he speaks fluent French and German.  He is a awkward
man, somewhat nerdy, who is kept out of combat.  All of these
supporting cast members are fleshed out to some degree at least.
Spielberg deserves a lot of credit for this.  Never does he allow his
characters to become the cardboard cutout squad members of the old
fashioned war movies.  Each in given at least one character
development moment.  Some of these are dramatic, such as when Mellish
takes a Hilter Youth knife from a dead Nazi and weeps over it, or when
Wade mournfully reminisces about his mother.  Others are comedic, such
as Reibens recounting of an experience while working in his
mothers dress shop. That is a particular strentgh of Robert Rodats
script.  The battle scenes are so overwhelming and devastating, they
could make the entire movie too much to watch.  Rodat sprinkles in
touches of humor to lighten up the mood, to keep it from becoming too
dark.  Something else Spielberg should be commended for, is that he
resists the temptation to bludgeon you with Dramatic Moments--he lets
scenes speak for themselves.</P>
<P>        The men trek across the French countryside while debating how
little sense the mission makes.  It risks the eight of them, just to
save one man.  Particularly oustpoken against the mission is Private
Reiben.  When Jackson remarks about Ryans mother, Reiben replies,
Hey, I got a mother.  I mean, you got a mother, Sarge has a mother.
Shoot, I bet even the Captain has a mother--okay, maybe not the
captain, but the rest of us got mothers. This comment is
significant.  We learn that Miller is a highly secretive man, who
doesnt tell anyone what he did or where he lived before the war.  In
fact, the men have a pool going on it.  The first to find out wins 300
dollars.</P>
<P>        Millers men journey from one dangerous situation to another
in their quest.  They travel from a devastated village, to a field
hospital, to a German radar installation, and finally to a climactic
defense of a strategic bridge.  The unit slowly begins to be killed
off.  Each surviving man becomes more and more resentful of Ryan as
their friends die.  Theyre fighting and dying to save a man they
know nothing at all about.  At one point, Miller remarks, This Ryan
better be worth it.  He better go home and cure some disease or invent
a longer lasting lightbulb. By the time Ryan is found, two hours
into the movie, he has become a symbol to the men.  As Rosebud was a
symbol of innocence lost in Citizen Kane, Private Ryan is a symbol to
the men of how little sense anything seems to make anymore, a symbol
of the futility of war.</P>
<P>        When Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is found, he is not eager 
to go home.  Not at all.  In fact, he refuses to.  It doesnt make 
any sense.....why do I deserve to go? he wonders out loud.  Damon 
does an effective job of conveying the confusion and bewilderment 
of a man who doesnt understand why he is so special; why men have
fought and died just to rescue him.</P>
<P>        When it comes down to it, Saving Private Ryan is simply awe
inspiring.  Its the little touches that make it all come together, 
though.  John Williams outstanding score, which underscores without 
intruding, to Janusz Kaminskis wonderful, drained out cinematography 
that gives it a newsreel like quality, to Corporal Uphams terrified
bewilderment at the conflict all around him, and Reibens wordless 
glance at Ryan in which he forgives all.  There are scenes that 
uplift, and scenes that tear your heart out. </P>
<P>        The best scene in the movie, I think, is when Miller elects 
to let a captured Nazi go, rather than execute him.   Near mutiny 
breaks out, but Miller is able to diffuse the situation in the most 
surprising way possible.  During his speech, which is the best in the
film, he remarks I dont know anything about Ryan.  But if finding 
him earns me the right to go home to my wife--then thats my
 mission.......just know that every man I kill, the farther away 
from home I feel.  Later in the movie,  Sergeant Horvath 
says, Maybe someday well look back and realize that saving 
Private Ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out 
of this whole godawful mess.  Those are two of the key lines in the
film.  When you walk out of the theater, the realization hits you 
that it wasnt just Private Ryan that Captain Miller and his men 
were fighting to save.  They were also fighting to save
themselves.</P>
