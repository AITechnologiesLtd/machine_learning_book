<PRE>WHAT LIES BENEATH</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Robert Zemeckis
Written by: Sarah Kernochan (story), Clark Gregg</P>
<P>Claire and Norman Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford respectively) 
have just sent there daughter, Caitlin (Katharine Towne), off to college. 
Now Claire is home alone every day while Norman, apparently a brilliant 
geneticist, works on a project which would be the crowning achievement in 
his career. While home alone, Claire begins to notice strange events 
occurring around her, like whispering in an empty room and doors opening 
without being touched (I couldn't help but keep thinking she really needed 
to get that door fixed). The new neighbor, Warren Feur (James Remar, 
previously seen in the beyond merely awful "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"), 
and his wife, Mary Feur (Miranda Otto), have been fighting every evening; 
now Mary has disappeared. Claire begins to think the strange events are 
actually Mary's ghost trying to contact her so Claire can catch Warren as 
her murderer. Yet, as Claire pursues this belief, events begin to make her 
suspect the ghost is actually someone from her own past, with whom her 
husband may have been involved.</P>
<P>Anyone who has seen the trailers for "What Lies Beneath" knows exactly how 
events transpire after my brief plot summary. When I first sat down to write 
this review I was going to write a mean, scathing review which smashed the 
movie for being predictable. After I pondered this awhile, I decided the 
film's lack of surprises was more the fault of DreamWorks than Robert 
Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump") and company. This brings up an interesting point: 
can a film be blamed for its trailers giving the whole story away? While I 
could sit here and display point after point in defense of and against this 
theory, I'm sure you'd prefer to hear a review of the actual movie. "What 
Lies Beneath" is, at its core, a mess of a film; borrowing from a dozen 
different genres, and stealing outright from Hitchcock (particularly "Rear 
Window") on several occasions. If that's the case, why didn't I rate it 
lower you ask? Simply because if you haven't seen the previews, it's 
probably going to throw quite a few delightful surprises and legitimate 
startles (although I don't know about actual scares) at you.</P>
<P>You would think that any movie starring both Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison 
Ford would feature some outstanding acting. Strangely enough, the acting in 
"What Lies Beneath" is one of the film's weaker points. Michelle Pfeiffer, 
one of the more gifted actresses in Hollywood, turns in a performance which 
fluctuates back and forth from over-the top antics to looking bored out of 
her mind. Harrison Ford, the man who actually managed to make "Six Days, 
Seven Nights" bearable, turns in his most wooden performance to date. I'm 
beginning to think Ford is just burned out on acting. I think he wants to 
make his last Indiana Jones movie and retire from acting, so he can pursue 
being a carpenter to his heart's content. If that's not the case, and he's 
just losing his acting skills, then I hope he does decide to retire from 
acting so he won't be remembered for roles like the one played here. The 
only other person given any screen time is Diana Scarwid (whose career is 
full of TV movie appearances), playing Claire's best friend, Jody. Jody is a 
very unusual character, being a hippy-like woman obsessed with the occult, 
yet frightened when confronted by the real thing. She also uses words like 
"trippin", which I didn't think even hippyish older people used anymore. 
Scarwid does an adequate job playing Jody, and actually outdoes Pfeiffer in 
a few scenes (just to give you a hint of how below average Pfeiffer's 
performance is in this film).</P>
<P>Perhaps most troublesome about this film (aside from the trailers of course) 
is Robert Zemeckis' normally astute directorial abilities vanishing into 
thin air. This was the man who brought us the magnificent, multiple Oscar 
winning "Forrest Gump"; with its perfect pacing, soundtrack, and acting, and 
he now gives us a film so languid in its pacing I saw people falling asleep 
in the theater. The reason for this is simple: the only "scares" that come 
out of a movie like "What Lies Beneath" are from objects and people suddenly 
appearing on screen, while music blasts out of dead silence, and scenes like 
Harrison Ford sneaking up behind his wife for no other reason than to scare 
her and movie goers (I don't know, but I'd think most wives would smack 
their husbands upside the head for sneaking up on them like that). In a 
movie where these are the only scares, the audience sits and waits anxiously 
for the next startle effect. In "What Lies Beneath", Zemeckis has spread 
these effects out so thinly that one can only wait anxiously for so long 
before not caring anymore. Sarah Kernochan and Clark Gregg don't help much 
when they seem to place the movie's significant events in the wrong order. 
We are granted supposedly startling revelations at certain points in the 
movie when we have no idea what is going on (take Claire finding a box full 
of old things in the basement, for example).</P>
<P>Clark Gregg's script may have one or two really good startle effects, and 
one really creepy looking scene near the film's end, but it's also full of 
horror movie cliches. We get everything from the dog being present only so 
it can sense danger that the humans can't tell is near, to someone looking 
dead multiple times only to keep springing back to life. My second largest 
complaint with the movie was in regards to the ending, which just seems to 
go on and on for a good 45 minutes or so. I don't know about you, but I 
start losing interest in the end of a film once it breaks the twenty five 
minute mark. In "What Lies Beneath" Zemeckis gives us big final climaxes not 
once, not twice, but thrice. By the third one, I was getting more than a 
little bored. The other problem with the ending is that while those classic 
"yeah right" moments are essential to any horror film, "What Lies Beneath" 
uses them perhaps five or six times too many. I felt like I was watching the 
latest "Friday the 13th" film rather than a classy, dramatic scare flick. 
The film's score, by composer Alan Silvestri ("The Abyss"), starts off low 
and eerie, yet sadly underused; then just as it gets loud, dramatic, and 
obnoxious, Zemeckis decides to start using it non-stop. I'd recommend "What 
Lies Beneath" to fans of Hitchcock as long as they can handle seeing the 
master's work stolen several times. I give it three out of five stars.</P>
