<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>This one-sided documentary is about marijuana's introduction and use in the 
United States in the 1990s. Brought over the border by Mexicans in the early 
part of the century, it was a joy for many. You could smoke it and escape 
your life, troubles, and problems. The stuff soon became so common you could 
find it on the side of the road. The government used marijuana as an excuse 
not to like Mexico. The Bureau of Narcotics formed shortly after some 
marijuana users turned violent. The head of the bureau launched several 
campaigns hoping to make marijuana as frowned upon as possible. More laws, 
restrictions, and programs popped up as time went on. Parents and worried 
officials wanted this stuff controlled. Several people thought it unfair that 
the government was creating laws that put innocent civilians who were just 
trying to relax in jail. Why should something enjoyable for most be illegal 
in the eyes of the law? The previous inquiry morphs into different forms as 
time and the film go on.</P>
<P>If I lived in the world that Grass presents, I would be an advocate to 
legalize marijuana too. This is certainly a bias documentary. The movie 
covers about eighty years of the drug, but skips over the 1980s and 1990s in 
approximately five minutes. It seems Grass covers only the periods where 
people lived in ignorance about the downsides from using the drug. There was 
always plenty of speculation from non-users about what would happen if a 
person took marijuana in the early days. A few of their fears were dispelled 
(or confirmed) after the first solid scientific research study on marijuana 
in the 1970s. Some of the best moments of the film are the official truths of 
the time. The truth, as issued by the government and accepted by non-users, 
flashes before each decade. Through the years, the government stopped saying 
marijuana would lead you to kill people, and started linking it as a 
stepping-stone to heroin abuse. </P>
<P>If anything, Grass is certainly a lot of fun. Clips from movies like Reefer 
Madness really heighten the experience. Cheech & Chong show up, as does Cab 
Calloway and Sonny Bono. Even Elvis Presleyâ€™s public service announcement 
discouraging drug use is included. There are some fantastic graphics and 
computer animated sequences that really help the movie. Whenever a law passes 
that is against marijuana, a disaster diagram (erupting volcanoes, spinning 
tornadoes, etc.) comes onscreen along with the name of the bill and the word, 
"PASSED." These types of pictures are always colorful and humorous. They 
capture the screw the government attitude adapted by most of the film.</P>
<P>Grass is essentially a piece of harmless propaganda. Hidden messages about 
legalizing marijuana lie under its surface. Most adults will not be 
susceptible to these, but it may influence some teens. It figures that Woody 
Harrelson narrates this film when one considers his work in attempting to 
legalize the Indian weed. Hypocrisy is present on both sides of the argument. 
One government official goes on about how bad drug addiction is while he 
continuously smokes a cigarette. Director Ron Mann never chooses to look at 
the devastating effects of the narcotic. Even so, the material presented is 
very interesting, and was certainly something I would not have pursued 
otherwise, and like some of the best documentaries, there are plenty of 
opportunities to laugh. </P>
<P>Unless you can personally relate to Grass's subject, it is likely to have 
little impact. This picture certainly does not break any new ground, and 
rarely rises above the amusing level. If it were more thought provoking than 
rebellious, it would be much better. This easily forgettable movie entertains 
while its playing, but never reaches a high. It leaves little to take with 
you or remember. </P>
