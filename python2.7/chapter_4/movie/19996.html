Reviewed August 14, 1999.</P>
<P>Jonathan Kaplan's "Brokedown Palace" feels throughout like an outline for a 
movie--one that has been scrupulously planned out, to be sure--rather than 
one that has an actual screenplay. Far too reminiscent of 1998's "Return to 
Paradise" to feel the least bit fresh, the film is often uninvolving and 
needlessly simplistic, with the characters' motivations severely muddled. As 
opposed to "Return to Paradise," which was a thought-provoking, complex 
drama, "Brokedown Palace" never really allows you to satisfactorily connect 
with the two central characters, and their harsh surroundings are portrayed 
in such a bare-bones light, that when the somewhat unpredictable ending 
arrives, you come out feeling a tad more indifferent to the whole ordeal than 
the filmmakers probably wanted you to.</P>
<P>Recent high school graduates and lifelong best friends Alice (Claire Danes) 
and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) are planning to take a trip to Hawaii together, 
but while at a party, they catch word on the more-appealing Third World 
country of Thailand, which is so cheap that the hotel rooms cost only six 
dollars a night. "Besides," says the more rebellious Alice, in narration, 
"Thai means freedom, which was the exact thing we were looking for." At first 
enjoying themselves in Bangkok, they soon have a chance encounter with the 
engaging, handsome Australian, Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), after almost 
getting caught sneaking into a ritzy hotel and hanging out at the swimming 
pool, putting their drinks on other peoples' tabs. Inviting both Alice and 
Darlene to fly to Hong Kong and meet him a day after he leaves for there on 
business, they agree to, but while at the airport awaiting to board the 
plane, are abruptly accosted by the police, who find bags of narcotics in 
Alice's bag. Thrown into a dehumanizing, roach-infested prison, both girls 
firmly claim that they have no idea how the drugs got into her backpack, and 
after receiving a bogus sentence of 33 years each, they enlist the aid of 
supposed-to-be-fabulous lawyer "Yankee" Hank Green (Bill Pullman), an 
American himself who knows all about the strict Thai laws, to help get them a 
second hearing.</P>
<P>"Brokedown Palace" would have what it takes to be highly-charged, moving 
motion picture if not for two setbacks: the release of the superior "Return 
to Paradise" last year, and the lackluster screenplay by David Arata. 
Particularly in the first half-hour, the dialogue between the two best 
friends, which is a vital relationship that is not developed nearly enough, 
seems to have been cut to a minimum, with their few-and-far-between lines 
improvised--none to well--on the spot. Whether this is the case or not, the 
script could have benefitted from an extensive rewrite in order to strengthen 
the characters and depict the prison experience in a more raw, gritty light. 
As is, the film is akin to a tablet of cliffs notes, rather than getting us 
involved in the full experience. The brutality of the Thai prisons does not 
give us a large enough taste of its harshness, nor are Alice and Darlene 
instructed to react in a fully believable manner, considering that they are 
facing almost their whole lives in prison for something they were not even 
involved in.</P>
<P>The sympathy that we do develop for Alice and Darlene mostly owes itself to 
the young, talented actress' performances. Claire Danes, in my mind, has been 
someone to look out for ever since her star-making turn on the best 
television series of the decade, "My So-Called Life," but with her 
involvement in this film and last spring's "The Mod Squad," she needs to be 
more choicy on the projects she makes. Equalling Danes in every way is the 
British Kate Beckinsale who, with 1998's sparkler, "The Last Days of Disco" 
and here, is able to pull off a near-perfect American accent, and seems to 
fully embody every one of her characters, even when they are as underwritten 
as this picture.</P>
<P>Holding no such close scrutiny is the subplot involving Hank Green and his 
transformation from a determined lawyer in it for the money, into a more 
compassionate soul. Hank's cause for inner change is never really vindicated, 
and his relationship with his wife, Yon (Jacquelyn Kim), couldn't have 
possibly been any more thinly-written. Bill Pullman makes no impression in 
this other major role in the film, as he simply goes through the well-worn 
paces without any distinguishable character traits. </P>
<P>If too flawed to be recommended, "Brokedown Palace" still is not without its 
merits. Aside from the performances by Danes and Beckinsale, the one powerful 
sequence in the film arrives midway through, when Darlene's father arrives at 
the prison, along with all of the other visitors, and we watch as the 
prisoners and their free family and friends must yell back and forth amidst a 
wire fence and a long space in between them. The scene jumps out at the 
viewer because it is the one moment that feels completely authentic, and is 
emotionally devastating just from the thought that that space in between the 
imprisoned and the visitors is their path to freedom, if only they could 
reach it.</P>
<P>Attempting to have its cake and eat it too, director Kaplan has devised an 
infuriating ending that is both downbeat and upbeat at the same time, which, 
no doubt, left a sour taste in my mouth. Being very vague about the 
particulars of the conclusion, the last image we are shown is of someone 
smiling, which, sorry to say, is an outrageous strain for a falsely happy 
ending and doesn't even make much sense when you stop to think about it. What 
one of the characters does in this final act is a courageous act, but it also 
doesn't sit well with what we already know about the character, and the fact 
that this person smiles is ludicrous. "Brokedown Palace" yearns to be a 
meaningful morality tale about two teenagers who don't realize what they've 
got until it's gone, but what it really is is a glossy Hollywoodization of a 
serious subject that is as far from the bright lights of Hollywood as could 
possibly be.</P>
