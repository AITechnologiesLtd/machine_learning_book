<PRE>TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991)
 A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: James Cameron
Writers: James Cameron and William Wisher Jr.
Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert
Patrick, Joe Morton, Erin Boen, Don and Dan Stanton</P>
<P>I moved to college on Ausust 29th, 1997, which is the same day as
"Judgment Day" in "Terminator 2," which was basically the big apocalypse
that killed most of the population, and, of course, launched the
"Terminator" films.  In a typical film version of this, the action
sequences would be half-assed, and it would be as deep as a Seagal
film.  But under the helm of James Cameron, who's the world's biggest
perfectionist, we get a film with depth and some totally ass-kicking
action sequences, which he's famous for.</P>
<P>In the original film (also done by Cameron), a Terminator (Ah-nold)
arrived from the future to assasinate the mother (Linda Hamilton) of the
leader of the rebellion against the robots in the future, who ruled the
earth after the big apocalypse until the humans rebelled.  But another
human arrived too (Michael Biehn), who not only killed the Terminator
(and was also killed), but ended up being the father of the leader of
the rebellion (a lovely twist).</P>
<P>Jump ahead about 10 years or so, the mother's now in an asylum; the son,
John (Edward Furlong), is a rebellious Bart Simpson-type, living with
foster parents, and riding around on a little moped with his friend; and
two terminators have arrived with different missions: T-1000 (Robert
Patrick), a liquid terminator, sent to kill John; and T-100 (Ah-nold) ,
this time sent to protect him from T-1000.  They both arrive in electric
lightning, totally buck naked, and on other parts of a bad city.</P>
<P>They both get clothes (although T-1000 has a cool thing where he can
imitate anything it impales, and can do other liquid things), and they
both set out to find John.  They both pretty much find him first, duke
it out a bit, ending in a giant Cameron-esque explosion, and soon they
rescue the mother from the asylum, who has also begun to attempt an
escape.</P>
<P>Part of Arnold's programming not only makes him protect John, but do
whatever he commands.  And he soon not only becomes his friend and
pretty much his bitch, but soon he has become a father figure to him,
and with the mother there, they form a kind of family unit.</P>
<P>The plot twists a bit, and we find out that a blooming company found the
chip and arm from the first terminator and has taken that direction. 
But on August 29th, 1997 (a day I still think about), they somehow blew
up the world, and all their robots took over the world, fighting the
remaining humans, led by a grown-up John.  Once this is found out, the
mother decides to make it her business to stop it all by assasinating
the head of the company (Joe Morton), who instead of being a jerk, goes
ahead and helps them stop it by blowing up all the information.  This
leads to about 30 minutes or so of straight action sequences, right up
until the end (which pissed me off when I rewatched it on NBC last night
because they had to cut to commercial at several inconvenient times).</P>
<P>Now, is "Terminator 2" the greatest single action film ever made?</P>
<P>Nearly.  The plot is so creepy and ominous that it's totally
intriguing.  The elements of depth are very well handled, causing us to
care about the characters and even to question the mother's choice in
killing Morton, and even think of Arnold as a near human.  There are
elements to humanize Arnold, and he almost becomes one, though he can
feel nothing, but later on love for who he's protecting, and care for
the mother, as well as a nifty way to not kill people all the time,
causing this to have a surprisingly low body count for such a riveting
action pic.</P>
<P>And Cameron is a master of action scenes.  And since Arnold cannot be
killed by mere bullets, he can go way, way, way over the top with his
scenes.  He also equips T-1000 with a bunch of cool new perks.  For one,
he can mutate, and everything.  But also, when you shoot him, it merely
makes a hole, which is covered up within seconds.  A master of using an
idea to its fullest limits, we not only get him shooting him with a gun
to stop him for a couple seconds, but he later freezes him, uses a
machine gun on him, etc.  His action sequences are not just there to
look cool, but to advance the plot.</P>
<P>This is one instance where the special effects work perfectly.  They
look realistic, they help with the cool action sequences, and they are,
basically, jaw-dropping.  Of course, James Cameron always makes the best
special effects, I mean, other than Spielberg.  The whole idea of T-1000
is an ingnius idea, and the film has the special effects to back his
innovativeness up.  There's also a cool bit at the end involving what
looks like outtakes from John Carpenter's "The Thing."</P>
<P>There is one question of a potential flaw in the film.  A big ass
paradox.  This involves the fact that if they stop "Judgment Day," then
how was John Connor conceived, since his father came back from the
future, which has been stopped by the end...unless they didn't actually
stop it.  I mean, the company could have had diskettes elsewhere when
the plant was blown up.  I dunno.  But I remember discussing this with
other people, and someone pointed out the theory of time lines, where
there are alternate realities that come out (also used in the "Back to
the Future" trilogy).  But, I'm still a believer in the "12 Monkeys"
theory of time: that it's linear.  But oh well.  Let's not try to think
to hard on this one.</P>
<P>The film also features some actually excellent performances.  Arnold is
pretty much at his best here, combining zombie-like creepiness with some
human depths that are meticulously added in the right places.  Linda
Hamilton continues on the Cameron streak of strong female leads (started
with Ripley), and also proves herself a talented actress and powerful
action lead (and has never looked so attractive).  Eddie Furlong is
good, best he ever was.  Joe Morton, as always, rocks.  </P>
<P>And Robert Patrick gives a perfectly delicious creepy performance.  He
has this kind of Malcolm MacDowell "Clockwork Orange" stare, equipped
with greasy pushed-back hair, (big ears) and some little doses of
mechanical humor - like staring as one of his victims struggles or
almost being beaten, then looking up at his enemy, and mocking them
pretentiously.  He has never been this awesome, and I doubt he ever will
(the poor guy's career never really took off, save a cool performance in
"Copland," a cameo in "Wayne's World" as his T-1000 character, and he
also did a grade-Z erotic thriller with Teri Hatcher where he got to
touch her bare breasts - for all you horny bastards, it's called "The
Cool Surface," and it sucks).</P>
<P>But "T2" is probably the second best action film ever made, close by to
"Die Hard."  It involves some of the most amazing action sequences ever
executed, a story that's so engrossing that the film has become one of
the ten most defining films of the past decade (from the "Premiere"),
and features good acting, and a good old paradox or two.  "Terminator 2"
is basically how one makes a great big-budget action film.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
