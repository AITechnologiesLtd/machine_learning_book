<PRE>Review: Wilde</PRE>
<P>Starring: Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Jennifer Ehle, Gemma Jones, Michael Sheen</P>
<PRE>Directed by Brian Gilbert</PRE>
<PRE>Approx. running time: 110 min</PRE>
<P>It seems a trend in modern works about Oscar Wilde to narrow him down
to nothing but a man ruined by his homosexuality. "Wilde", which
opened friday, can't be excluded from that group. Both San Francisco
and Broadway in NY have a play called "Gross Indecency" about the
trial surrounding Oscar Wilde's sexual affairs with younger men. SF
also had a one man show last winter that focused largely on the
torment he had to endure because of his sexuality. What "Wilde" and
all these other plays forget is that behind this "scandal" was a
brilliant, witty and successful writer in the late 19th century who
contributed to world literature.</P>
<P>The first 30 minutes of "Wilde" does nothing but pound into the
viewers heads that the character is indeed homosexual in spite of his
wife and two children. Moderation was not used to introduce it. Each
scene of social and family events seemed intercut with homosexual love
scenes. After the first half hour, I found that the film up to that
point lacked focus and drive. I wondered where it was going, and if it
was going to live up to it's name. After all, a film simply named
after a real person should cover that person's life, their personality
and what was important about them, or at least how their work
influenced culture. "Wilde" has the amazing ability to turn such a
fascinating man into a nobody. Oscar Wilde did not need to be the
focus of this film, and, should you decide that you want to see this
to learn more about him, you will be disappointed. The story is one of
a man who has a social status and how his sexual affairs with younger
men, one in particular, ends up ruining him. The fact that he is Oscar
Wilde, playwrite, poet and author, seems secondary. The successful
opening nights of "Lady Windermere's Fan" and "The Importance of Being
Earnest" as well as references to "The Picture of Dorian Gray" and
"Solome" are tossed in to remind the viewer who they are watching.</P>
<P>Stephen Fry did a fine job of portraying the tormented writer, but his
talent seemed wasted on a character who never lived up to what the
real man really was. Jude Law played his younger lover, Lord Alfred
Douglas, "Bosie" as he is known, quite well. His performance as a
snotty, slutty pretty boy is another thing that makes the film
watchable.</P>
<P>Perhaps a year of anticipation of a film about the life and times of
Oscar Wilde in which the lead role would be played by one of my
favorite British comics, had something to do with the letdown, but not
much. The costumes are glorious, the sets decadent and the
performances good, but "Wilde" does not hold together as anything
other than a preachy film about how difficult it was to be homosexual
120 years ago. I am still waiting for a production about a man who was
known for his wit and intelligence, a true artist, rather than the men
he slept with.</P>
<P>** out of **** stars
