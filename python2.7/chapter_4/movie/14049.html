<PRE>BLADE (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Stephen Norrington
Writer: David S. Goyer
Starring: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, N'Bushe Wright, Kris Kristoferson,
Donal Logue, Udo Kier, Arly Jover, Traci Lords, Kevin Patrick Walls</P>
<P>"Blade" is not only the most recent attempt at commercializing on an old
school comic book action hero, but also the newest film that lives or dies
with how damn cool it looks and feels to watch.  And luckily enough,
"Blade" is a triumph of visual brilliance, a great piece of flashy, moody
pulp, and a film of mostly style and very little substance.  It's a more
grizzly "Batman"; a significantly better "Spawn"; and a less philosophical
"Dark City."  In other words: bitching as hell.</P>
<P>For those of you who don't know who Blade is (read: me before seeing the
movie), he's the latest vampire slayer with a twist: he's a hybrid of human
and vampire as a result of his mother being bit by a vampire minutes before
giving birth to him.  He's grown up with all of the strengths that a
vampire has, such as invulnerability and the like, but very few of their
weaknesses: he can walk comfortably during daylight hours, but he still has
to take a serum consisting of blood to ease his nerves.</P>
<P>Blade's fortress of solitude is a giant warehouse in New York City, and his
mentor/sidekick/bud is a grizzled old man with a nasty limp named Whistler
(Kris Kristoferson, tres grizzled), who has waged a personal war against
the vampires that have been in existence for centuries without a whole lot
of knowledge and uses Blade, whom he found as a kid in the streets, as his
chief weapon.  Speaking of weapons, Whistler is the one who makes them, all
silver products (the only thing that kill vampires), including one nifty
boomerang with sharp edges that when thrown, chops the heads off of a whole
bunch of vampires then returns safely into the hands of Blade.</P>
<P>The plot, as it were, concerns Blade and Whistler's ever-going fight
killing all the vampires in the world, and it picks one group who live in
New York City as the object de scorn for this particular introductory
installment.  As we are told, the entire world as we know it is just a
facade for the vampires who rule the night and feast on us measly humans
like cattle.  In the opening sequence (which cannot be missed - you may as
well not show up at all if you walk in late), one poor guy is led to a
midnight rave where the scene soon turns into a kafkaesque nightmare that
is saved by the presence of Blade, who proceeds to chop up anyone he can,
in a scene so over the top that it could leave anyone feeling sadistically
giddy.</P>
<P>This is basically the entirety of "Blade": he finds vampires, and chops
them up.  A little story is introduced: Blade has to square off against one
of the big-heads of the vampires, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff, still stuck
in the three-day beard, greasy-hair days of yesteryear - oh those were the
days, my friend), who's trying to usurp the power from the other vampire
heads, such as the big big cheese, Dragonetti (the great Udo Kier), so he
can fulfill some prophecy of sorts (does it really matter?).</P>
<P>In the meantime, Blade hooks up with a doctor chick, Karen (N'Bushe Wright,
from "Dead Presidents"), who is half-bitten by one vampire early in the
flick and is slowly turning into one herself.  Saved by Blade, she begins
to help him and Whistler in their odyssey, although the only reason she's
there is as a sorta romance interest and blatant window dressing (sad,
because she was actually very good in "Presidents").</P>
<P>The big plus side to this film is that it's very well-directed.  Stephen
Norrington gives it a bleak, cool, and half-funny/half-serious feel that
turns it into just one big blast to watch.  The action sequences are
well-choreographed, and have the intensity and humorously violent feel that
a comic book film needs to have.  When the vampires are killed, they
instantly disentigrate, and sometimes when killed differently, even inflate
and blow up (a tactic blatantly stolen from John Carpenter's "Big Trouble
in Little China").</P>
<P>And the superhero is gleefully serious.  Played with an Eastwood-ian
inaffectiveness by Wesley Snipes (who's also credited with "Fight
Choreographer"), Blade comes off as a man who's deeply tortured, but keeps
all his pain deep down, and has a nice costume piece: dark sunglasses,
which not only make him look cooler, but also give him that nice touch of
hidden torture.  All the great superheroes are the ones who have inner
pains, and Blade is far from the exception.</P>
<P>It's not a great film.  It has very little substance, and the substance it
does introduce (like the idea of Blade's refusal to open up to anyone) is
dropped after a little bit of being played around with.  And the film seems
to loose some steam in its second half, when things become all to
predictable and a little redundant, even though it's still extremely
watchable.</P>
<P>No matter.  The final sequence, although a little puzzling (what the hell
happened with those 12 head vampires?  And is that REALLY the vision of
apocalypse?), is nevertheless totally kickass and amazing.  A final
tete-a-tete between Blade and Deacon is riveting, original, and filled with
fits of humor and shocks, all which leave the film off with a nice taste
that makes up for any little problems the film had before.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this film will not be remembered for its story.  It falls
into the trap of oh so many films that try to launch franchises (most
recently "The Mask of Zorro") and comes off as more as an introduction to
cooler pastures that may or not be in the near future than ana actual great
film.  But even if there's not a "Blade 2" or "Still Blading" or whatever
they may call it, we can always remember this as another in the line of
films that are brilliant in their visual design and sensual intensity.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
