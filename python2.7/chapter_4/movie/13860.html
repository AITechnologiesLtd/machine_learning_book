<P>What a strange life! A mere seven hours after returning from Orillia's
CasinoRama (I actually came out ahead!), I was off to see a movie
basically about, as the title suggests, gambling: SNAKE EYES. This is
also the second film (after The Gingerbread Man) I've sat through this
week in which a raging hurricane provides a backdrop for the
shenanigans.</P>
<PRE>Shenanigans.</PRE>
<P>SNAKE EYES' plot is deceptively simple; don't let multiple-viewpoints
trick you into believing this assassination tale is more complex than
the average episode of "Vega$." A major casino/hotel: Homicide Detective
Rick Santoro (Cage) excitedly attends a big heavyweight showdown-fighter
Lincoln Tyler(Shaw)'s championship title is on the line-with his best
bud, Major Kevin Dunne (Sinise), a Washington sycophant assigned to
protect the Secretary of Defense, Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani), who
has a second row seat. A gorgeous, big-breasted redhead is suspiciously
situated nearby-when Dunne tries to check her ticket, she takes off. He
follows. Pow! Bam! Oomph! In Dunne's place sits a gorgeous, big-breasted
blonde (Gugino); as she quietly converses with Kirkland, Tyler is
knocked down for the first time in his career, and sniper shots are
fired at the crowd. An assassin is immediately caught, but not before
Kirkland has been killed and the mysterious blonde (who is actually a
brunette, and blind without her newly-crushed specs) escapes in a
stampede. Santoro, a gambling sleazebag with a checkered past, begins an
investigation, relishing the opportunity to gain some respect. His
detective work mostly consists of screaming at people until they become
so annoyed they talk. (It's as if he's envious of the boxers, who get to
pummel one another into submission.)</P>
<P>SNAKE EYES has numerous flaws, perhaps countless. For starters, Cage is
not playing a character here: his personality shifts from scene to
scene, even moment to moment, but this time out he's not playing a drunk
(Leaving Las Vegas) or a psychopath (Face/Off); he's an actor paddling
without a raft in a toneless performance. As for all that hooey about
"believe everything but your eyes," SNAKE EYES reveals its major baddies
early on, but flashbacks and long-winded exposition continue: we're
shown the solution to the puzzle and then asked to suffer through the
construction of the puzzle. Start at the conclusion of SNAKE EYES and
work backwards and the result is pretty much the same, a film
intricately but not intelligently structured. Characters who figured
heavily into the conspiratorial equation vanish without explanation
throughout the story. (And no, the hurricane has almost nothing to do
with the climax, but implausibility does.)</P>
<P>DePalma's virtuoso style (my apologies for resorting to such a worn out
praise) is a character in its own right here, and it is because of his
mastery of technique (rather, mastery of someone's-Hitchock's?
Godard's?-technique) that SNAKE EYES is a thousand-times more enjoyable
than it has any right to be. The opening set-piece is brilliantly
crafted, a long take that bests all his previous attempts (by now,
watching a DePalma movie includes the anticipation of his next edit-try
it as a drinking game) by snaking around corridors, through hotel rooms,
up and down stairwells, and finally, into the arena. SteadiCams were
invented for filmmakers like DePalma and cinematographers like SNAKE
EYES' Stephen H. Burum. DePalma also employs nifty split-screen
effects-his use of two simultaneous frames in one particular sequence is
terrific. DePalma may be the only MovieBrat whose seventies
sensibilities have remained utterly at his disposal. (I also liked how
he showed very little of the fight-the majority of the seven-round
battle happens off-camera; Dolby-ized punches clue us in to the action.)</P>
<P>The outcome of SNAKE EYES is a curious one. I find it hard to dismiss,
based on the director's aesthetic garnishes, for lack of a better word.
The movie is better than the sum of its parts, I guess, and it clicked
along pleasantly. But the script is weightless, and it's a shame DePalma
had to use up all these talented resources for the sake of screwing
around and exercising his filmmaking biceps.</P>
