<P>Can Morgan Freeman ever give a bad acting performance? Or what about Gene
Hackman for that matter? Two solid thespians starring in a film that's been
mulling around in Hackman's mind since he saw the original French version
back in 1981, this movie was finally produced when Freeman's own production
company took a shot at it. I was one of the many members of a packed opening
night house at the Montreal Film Festival as this movie presented itself to
one of its first preview audiences.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A rich lawyer with a very pretty young wife is called in to answer some
questions about two local teenage girl murders by a detective with a slight
suspicion about the man. It isn't long before the brash attorney tumbles
over a few lies and consequently leads his inquisitors to further suspect
his guilt. The cat and mouse game between the cop and suspect, with
flashbacks, is what fills our time with the dueling duo.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A slow-moving yet engaging mystery starring two great actors at the top of
their form, keeps you guessing throughout, but ultimately may lose many fans
with its unorthodox ending. I personally do not mind movies that ask the
viewer to "think" a little after the roll of the credits, but this one
actually threw me for a little bit of a loop. In fact, I'm still sort of
vague on the exact outcome of the characters in this film, but despite that,
still enjoyed the ride and would actually be willing to see it again, just
to certify my theories about its conclusion. Unfortunately, I saw the movie
by myself so I wasn't able to discuss it with anyone either. So that is one
thing about the movie that you should know right off the bat. If you only
like films that close things up nice and tidy, then you might as well skip
this ambiguous puppy. But if you enjoy films like 12 ANGRY MEN, in which the
viewer is asked to discover things as it moves along, changing their mind
throughout and ultimately passing their own judgment before the final
decision comes down, then this is just your kind of mystery. The film
could've been cut by about 15 minutes or so, with some scenes dragging on
somewhat, but ultimately the superior performances by the two leads is what
kept me interested throughout.</P>
<P>I also credit director Hopkins with some beautiful shots of the city during
its opening credits, and an extremely unique perspective on the flashback
sequences, in which the person being told the flashback actually joins the
speaker in their own retelling. Very well done and certainly an original
idea which lent an interesting new perspective to the goings-on of the past.
Extremely stylized flashbacks as well. Hopkins goes nuts with the camera
work. Oh yeah, and let me not forget to mention the stunning beauty of
newcomer Monica Bellucci, an Italian actress, who radiates on the screen,
and actually holds her own alongside the big boys. The film is really a
difficult one to rate because it's one of those movies that didn't leave me
feeling "complete" when I walked out. But looking back, I was quite "into
it" while I was there, and the reasoning behind the ending is just now
beginning to sink into my psyche, so let's just say that it may take a
little while to fully appreciate.</P>
<P>Will you like it? Not sure. Does any of this sound interesting to you? If
so, then I suggest you go see it and decide for yourself. There are some
definite things that I could tell you though: the mystery in the film is a
good one, the movie is slow and long but tends to hold your interest, and as
I mentioned earlier, the performances are strong, but the ending...initially
unsatisfying. In the end, I think that if you like a good murder mystery,
you may enjoy unraveling this one, despite the lack of real action or
thrills.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Lead stars Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are also the executive producers
on this project. Hackman has wanted to remake this film since he saw the
original French film in 1981, and finally got the opportunity when Freeman's
own production company, Revelations Entertainment, backed the project.
Morgan Freeman has been nominated for an Oscar on three occasions, but never
won.
Gene Hackman has been nominated for an Oscar on five occasions and won
twice. Once for Best Actor in 1972 for THE FRENCH CONNECTION and another one
as Best Supporting Actor in 1992's UNFORGIVEN.
This film is a remake of the 1981 French film called GARDE A VUE, which
itself was based on the novel "Brainwash" by John Wainwright. This film was
initially entitled THIRD DEGREE.
This movie was filmed entirely on location in Puerto Rico.</P>
