<P>The teaser trailers for MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING scarsely
gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy,
light-hearted comedy than might put Julia Roberts back in the
limelight, but little more; I'd frankly rarely seen a trailer
place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so
often.  It was then to both my surprise and my delight to
find that MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING was such a success - a
strong, bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly
unconventionally quirky comic aspects, featuring a triumphant
performance from Ms. Roberts. </P>
<P>The heroine of MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is Julianne Potter
(Julia Roberts), a successful New York restaurant critic, and
we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor
George Downes (Rupert Everett) that years ago, she had made a
pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover Michael O'Neal
(Dermot Mulroney), a sports writer, that if they both hadn't
married by the time they reached 28, they had promised to
marry each other.  Both Julianne and Michael are both single,
of course, and when George inquires about Michael's age,
Julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th
birthday, and is quite distressed when she receives a phone
call from Michael later that day.  However, she finds herself
even more distraught when Michael's call is in regards to his
impending marriage to heiress Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz),
and when he asks Julianne to fly down to Chicago for the
wedding, Julianne suddenly realizes that she loves Michael,
and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by
any means necessary. </P>
<P>The setup for MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, then, is a fairly
conventional one, and in many ways the film's storyline is
formulaic - but only to a certain extent: the film was
directed by P.J. Hogan, whose first feature, MURIEL'S
WEDDING, had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional
uplifting ugly-duckling story, and the same holds true for MY
BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, which confidently combines traditional
romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of
humour.  The film is innundated with sly mischievousness
which seems clearly the influence of Mr. Hogan.  For example,
there's a heartfelt, emotional exchange between Julianne and
Michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers, inhaling
helium and sounding every bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks,
harmonizing in the background.  MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the
tone for the film, and there are scenes where actors
spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could
almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a
musical as Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU; I'd even
assert it's a more successful one. </P>
<P>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING keeps breaking conventionality with
its characters as well.  In a typical romantic-comedy, Kimmy
would be portrayed as a snooty, conniving ice queen, and the
audience would be cheering for Julianne to rescue Michael
from her grasps; this film is smarter than that - here, Kimmy
is sweet, sincere, and innocent; Julianne even admits at one
point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy Kimmy's
life, she'd actually like her too.  The George character is
almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend
of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the
guiding voice of reason - but in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, he
gets to have a playful, mischievous and charming personality.
Throughout the film, the formulaisms one often sees is
romantic-comedy are given little twists, and the result is a
film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat
unorthodox conclusion.  There is a lot of smart writing in
the well-paced screenplay by Ronald Bass; we're given four
interesting, vivid, and likeable characters, with some good
dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments.</P>
<P>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING marks a strong career rebound for
Julia Roberts, who turns in a top-notch, confident and
reassured performance as Julianne.  This isn't the sort of
role one usually associates with Ms. Roberts - the Julianne
character's neurotic, fumbling characteristics are more in
line with a Meg Ryan role - but Ms. Roberts works wonderfully
in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here,
remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience, if not
entirely sympathetic, even when her deeds done to destroy the
wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable. </P>
<P>Even better than Ms. Roberts though is Cameron Diaz, who
turns in a shining performance in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDDING.
With a smile which lights up the screen, she effectively
conveys Kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an
endearing manner, and never hits a false note in the film.
She even sings - I won't soon forget her charming serenade of
"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself". </P>
<P>Rupert Everett is given a very juicy role as George, and he
makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his
character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the
film.  His George is a bit of a devilish rogue, entirely
affable, and Mr. Everett's performance is a delight to watch;
he's clearly having fun, and his joy is infectuous. </P>
<P>Dermot Mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the
other characters in the film, he's not given a lot to do, but
there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between Ms. Roberts and
Mr. Mulroney, and consequently the longstanding friendship
between his Michael character and the Julianne character
always seemed completely authentic. </P>
<P>When Julia Roberts' lustre began to fade, and she was usurped
from her title as "America's Sweetheart" by Sandra Bullock, I
thought it was a canny career move on her part to take
supporting roles in prestige projects like MICHAEL COLLINS
and EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU to raise her profile.  While that
didn't quite work out, it's near-certain that her successful
return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990,
the romantic-comedy, will once again raise her ante in the
Hollywood game.  MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING marks a return to
form for Ms. Roberts, and cements P.J. Hogan's reputation as a
skilled director of comedy. </P>
