<PRE>                                 SCREAM
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        SCREAM stands as the only successful meld between 
parody and terror in a horror movie. Unlike other slasher parodies 
like STUDENT BODIES, it has a sense of humor about itself but still 
manages to deliver genuine shocks. It also serves as homage to the 
great and not-so-great horror movies of the 80's, from the writer and 
director of a few great and not-so-great horror movies, Wes Craven. 
Such a set-up -- well-known horror movie director turns to self-
parody -- should be disastrous but somehow isn't.</P>
<P>        Craven, who is responsible for the original NIGHTMARE 
ON ELM STREET, has created the perfect inside movie for fans of 
good and bad horror movies. The settings, characters and score is 
reminiscent of many of the well-known slasher classics. The small 
town where the killings take place is even stock horror -- everyone 
knows everyone else and most of them are spoiled white kids with 
nice houses in the woods and cellular phones.</P>
<P>        SCREAM is one of those movies where all the characters 
can talk about is other horror movies like SILENCE OF THE 
LAMBS, FRIDAY THE 13TH and, yes, NIGHTMARE ON ELM 
STREET. One of the characters remarks that the original 
NIGHTMARE was good but all the sequels sucked, a high school 
janitor is seen wearing Freddy Kreuger's sweater and hat, and one 
of the male characters looks just like Johnny Depp, star of the first 
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Just the tip of the inside joke 
iceberg.</P>
<P>        Unlike most horror movies, SCREAM was made on a decent 
budget and stars people you've heard of. Neve Campbell ("Party of 
Five") is the sexy young heroine, Courteney Cox is an aggressive 
tabloid TV reporter and Drew Barrymore serves as the killer's first 
victim. As the movie opens, Barrymore is home alone, making 
popcorn for the horror video she's about to watch.</P>
<P>        The phone rings and a mysterious voice starts asking 
questions. She hangs up on him a few times before he reveals he's 
watching her from outside, and that her jock boyfriend is tied up 
on the patio. The phone voice says he'll set them both free if she 
can answer some simple movie trivia questions, which she botches 
under the stress. So he has to kill them both.</P>
<P>        Cut to the next day, at the local high school. The school's 
abuzz with talk of the murders, and every student gets hauled into 
Principal Henry Winkler's office to be interrogated by the small 
town's sheriff and deputy. Later, Neve, her picture-perfect boyfriend 
(the Depp look-alike), her best friend, her weird boyfriend and his 
weird horror movie-obsessed friend discuss these murders in terms 
of other horror movies they've seen. That night, Neve is home alone 
and gets a phone call from a mysterious stranger.</P>
<P>        This is just the beginning. Before SCREAM is done, the 
casualties will number at least ten, but this movie is much more tame 
than the movies it offers up for parody. There are no nude scenes or 
graphic violence, probably because they're not needed as crutches 
here. SCREAM is a good horror movie on its own but it's probably 
the best anti-horror movie ever made.</P>
<P>        SCREAM goes so far as to establish the rules for surviving 
a horror movie, which I myself have commented on in the past. 
Here's my direct quote, which pretty much lines up with what the 
horror movie-obsessed characters in SCREAM say. "Smoking pot, 
drinking beer, sleeping with someone, insulting the main character... 
playing a practical joke on one of the other characters... taking a 
shower or spying on someone skinnydipping or taking a shower 
will get you a one-way ticket to the afterlife."</P>
<P>        SCREAM acknowledges these and the other main tenets 
of the modern horror movie, then goes on to break them. It's an ode 
to slasher movies, but doesn't allow its fondness for past horror 
movies to dictate the plot. You hardly ever see a horror movie this 
self-aware, funny and semi-intelligent. SCREAM shows a lot of clips 
from HALLOWEEN, the best slasher movie ever made, and actually 
comes out looking good next to them. That says a lot.</P>
