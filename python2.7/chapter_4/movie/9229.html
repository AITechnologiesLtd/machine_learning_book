<P>FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL ** (out of four)</P>
<P>documentary, directed by Errol Morris</P>
<P>Considered a leading documentarian, Morris's fifth non-fiction feature
is filled with rich characters and a unique-ness that we've come to
expect from the director of films as diverse as The Thin Blue Line and
Vernon, Florida.</P>
<P>In Fast, Cheap... Morris links the stories of a lion tamer, a topiary
gardener, a naked mole- rat expert, and a scientist who invents
robots. Each of these people is very interesting, particularly the
lion tamer, who is revealed to have an obsession for B-movie star and
circus performer Clyde Beatty. Clips of Mr. Beatty's films, dispersed
liberally throughout, are hysterically, Ed Wood-funny. But over the
course of 82 minutes, Morris barely lets any of them speak. Instead we
get endless montages, footage which visually equates each
interviewee's occupation. While most of said footage is beautifully
shot, by Oliver Stone's DP Robert Richardson, it's all very
self-indulgent and blunt. Morris insists on spelling out his ideas, as
if he doesn't trust his own (admittedly wobbly) hypotheses. The music,
by Caleb Sampson, doesn't help matters: all tinker-y piano and goofy
orchestrations, it would better accompany a Keystone Cops movie.</P>
<P>The title refers to a quote from the scientist, from a scene in which
he envisions hundreds of small robots roaming the surface of planets
instead of one lumbering explorer like the Mars probe.</P>
<P>The title more aptly refers to the picture itself, obviously not a
good thing.</P>
