<PRE>Romper Stomper
***1/2 of **** grade is A-</PRE>
<P>Romper Stomper, like Trainspotting, is compared to the great A Clockwork
Orange, plots of both resemble it, yet both lack the scathing satire of
Orange electing instead to tell another slice of life.  This film
portrays the skinheads of Australia, they party, they fight, and they
flee.  Not all of the fighting is against other races, the selective
hatred is selecting a broader group.  What you end up withis one of the
most interesting and compelling foreign films of recent years.</P>
<P>Russell Crowe stars as the evil, leader of the skinhead group we
follow.  They beat two Orientals whom had the badluck of crossing the
path of the men.  The point is made early: Women or Children they're
still not as pure as I.  Watching the scenes of beating in the beginning
and around twenty minutes in are quite tough to stomach.  They are
violent, fast and uncompromising.</P>
<P>Those three words describe not only that scene but infact the entire
film which contains material that will affend most.  This film reminded
me of the great Henry: Portrit of a Serial Killer in the way both show
hainous villians and don't stoop to cliches or sentiment.  The action is
unbiased, not trying to steer you but show you.  Pay close attention to
the scenes of fast paced violence and you will notice teens who have
passed the degree of hatte that most humans never achieve.</P>
