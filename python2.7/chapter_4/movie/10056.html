<P>     It has long been recognized that Hitler's final solution 
exterminated more than Jews.  Gypsies and homosexuals were also 
routinely prodded onto trains like cattle and sent off to ovens and gas 
showers.  To this date, most films have examined the tragedy from the 
Jewish point-of-view.  A select few, such as Steven Spielberg's Oscar-
winning SCHINDLER'S LIST, have presented the truth with heartbreaking, 
gut-wrenching clarity.  Rarely, however, has a motion picture attempted 
what BENT does:  show the Holocaust through the eyes of two gay men 
enduring a grueling existence at the Dachau concentration camp.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, what begins with an interesting premise and a 
promising first half quickly devolves into a boring, muddled, 
melodramatic love story.  BENT is based on the 1979 stage play of the 
same name.  By all accounts, the live version is both startling and 
moving.  The motion picture version is neither -- something critical was 
lost in the translation, even though playwright Martin Sherman wrote the 
screenplay.  Many of the things that can work in a play, when the live 
nature of the production allows an intimate rapport to develop between 
the actors and the audience, fail on the big screen.  The final fifty 
minutes of BENT are a prime example.</P>
<P>     The movie's first half is more successful.  It introduces us to a 
pair of gay lovers living out their lives in Berlin during the late 
1930s.  They are Max (Clive Owen), the "black sheep" of a wealthy 
family, and Rudy (Brian Webber), and effeminate dancer.  Together, the 
two spend their nights at Greta's, a dive run by a transvestite (Mick 
Jagger).  While Rudy performs, Max drinks, snorts cocaine, and picks up 
men for quick sex.  That lifestyle ends, however, when Hitler orders 
homosexuals sent to concentration camps.  Despite pleas from his uncle 
(Ian McKellen), Max refuses to flee Germany unless he can get Rudy out 
with him.  Ultimately, both men are caught and sent to Dachau.  En 
route, Max is befriended by a timid gay man named Horst (Lothaire 
Bluteau), who advises him not to acknowledge his lover if he wishes to 
remain alive.  Following that advice allows Max to survive after Rudy is 
beaten to death.  Later, by "performing" with a young girl to convince 
the Nazis of his heterosexuality, Max is able to "upgrade" his status 
from that of a homosexual (who must wear a pink triangle) to that of a 
Jew (who wears a yellow star).</P>
<P>     Once the movie reaches Dachau, it grinds to a screeching halt.  The 
remainder of BENT concentrates on the relationship between Max and 
Horst.  They meet in the yard every day, moving rocks back and forth in 
an example of pointless monotony.  This particular activity is not 
inherently cinematic in nature and BENT's banal, repetitious dialogue 
does little to liven it up.  Gradually, the tediousness of the second 
half sucks all of the potential drama (not to mention the energy) out of 
the film.  We give up caring whether the characters live or die.  They 
don't have anything interesting to say, and the scene in which they 
engage in "verbal sex" borders on being unintentionally funny.  Solid 
performances from lead actors Clive Owen and Lothaire Bluteau go in 
vain.  The final scene, which is supposed to be a triumphant crowd-
pleaser, comes across as obvious and overplayed.  </P>
<P>     One thing I don't doubt is director Sean Mathias' sincerity.  BENT 
is obviously an important story for him; it's just that he and writer 
Martin Sherman made too many bad choices in adapting the play.  Instead 
of being a revealing look at one often-neglected group of Hitler's 
victims, BENT turns into a lifeless, preachy love story where the 
characters lose their connection with the audience the longer they 
remain on screen.  In fact, BENT's most important contribution may be to 
illustrate by comparison how powerful a movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST 
truly is.</P>
