<PRE>THE PLAYER
Rating: **** (out of four)
R, 1992
Director: Robert Altman
Screenplay: Michael Tolkin
Starring Cast: Tim Robbins, Greta Schacchi, Peter Gallagher</PRE>
<P>THE PLAYER is one of those rare films that succeeds brilliantly despite the
fact that the audience and the filmmakers probably hate most of the
characters. A clever, sometimes humorous, and probably all too realistic
satire of the movie industry, the film follows the ups and downs of studio
executive Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins), an aloof businessman who cynically
manipulates the filmmaking process to serve his own interests and undercut
those of his rival Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher). The extent of his coldness
is revealed when he accidentally kills a disgruntled writer whom he
believed was sending him death threats and smoothly manages to cover up the
death. Everything from the selfish arrogance of the executives to their
retuning of a movie for mass consumption to the pretensions of a
self-important "message film" is skewered on the satirical sword of
director Robert Altman and screenwriter Michael Tolkin. If you ever want to
try to talk someone out of getting into the movie business, show them THE
PLAYER.</P>
