                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1995 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     The lives of real people can sometimes be far more interesting
than anything that a screenwriter can imagine.  Because of this, it is
completely possible for a good documentary to be as dramatic and
engrossing as any fiction film. HOOP DREAMS is a strong example of what
can be accomplished with the documentary form.</P>
<P>     HOOP DREAMS follows two Chicago inner-city youth through their
high school years.  At the beginning of the film, we meet William Gates
and Arthur Agee, two fourteen-year-old kids getting ready to begin high
school.  Both are extremely talented basketball players that are
recruited by St. Joseph High School, a small private school that
includes NBA-star Isiah Thomas among its alumni.  Both Gates and Agee
are recruited from inner-city playground basketball courts and are
given scholarships to help them attend the expensive private school.
The film follows them through their high school graduation, ending as
both are leaving for college.</P>
<P>     Filmmakers Steve James, Fredrick Marx and Peter Gilbert originally
conceived this project as a short subject for PBS (it is partially
financed by KTCA-TV out of Minneapolis with additional financial
support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting). Over time, it
became obvious that they had a much bigger story here.  The result is a
fascinating 3-hour-and-45-minute examination of the lives of Gates and
Agee.  Over the course of the film, we truly feel that we come to know
these kids and their families.  It left me wanting to know more about
what happens to these people.</P>
<P>     The makers of this film were very fortunate to have chosen Gates
and Agee as their subjects.  There are some parallels to their lives,
but for the most part, they go in widely different directions.  The
different lives of the two boys allow the filmmakers to show a wide
variety of experiences.  The film is extremely well edited, smoothly
cutting from one boy to the other.  Often, the film is deftly edited to
compare and contrast their experiences.</P>
<P>     As we first meet them, Agee and Gates seem to be starting from the
same point.  The film makes it completely clear that the St. Joseph
administration invited both boys to attend based on their potential on
the basketball court.  Gates quickly lives up the school's expectations
and the school bends over backwards to provide him the financial help
needed to continue attending.  The St. Joseph coach frequently points
out a similarity between Gates and Isiah Thomas, leading him to believe
that Gates is another chance for the school to generate a star.</P>
<P>     Agee, on the other hand, does *not* initially prove to be a
basketball star. Because of this, the school essentially abandons him.
Shortly into his sophomore year, he is forced to drop out of St.
Joseph when his family can no longer afford tuition.  As shown in the
film, it looks very much like both boys were "hired" to play for St.
Joseph.  When Agee's playing didn't live up to the school's lofty
expectations, they essentially "fired" him.  The rest of the movie
follows Agee's experiences at Marshall High School, an inner-city
public school.  At Marshall, Agee eventually comes into his own as a
basketball star.</P>
<P>     Basketball plays a key role in this film, but the film isn't
really about the sport itself.  Instead, the sport represents
opportunity for both Gates and Agee.  They see it as their ticket to a
better life.  As the film explores the other people in their life, we
also see that some people see the chance to live vicariously through
the boys.  In particular, Agee's father and Gates' brother both are
looking to the boys for a "second chance" to fulfill their own dreams
of a basketball career.</P>
<P>     Isiah Thomas is frequently mentioned in the film as the ultimate
example of someone who escaped from inner-city life to NBA stardom.
Both families and the St. Joseph coach frequently express a desire for
Agee and/or Gates to become the next Thomas.  The film subtlely
suggests that both boys might have been better off if they had been
pushed to be *themselves* instead of trying to get them to emulate
Thomas' success.</P>
<P>     For the most part, director Steve James stays in the background
allowing his subjects to tell their own stories.  Where necessary,
James does provide some understated narration, but he also knows when
elaboration is not necessary.  The narration never overshadows the
events being shown or the words of the people being interviewed.</P>
<P>     The film also benefits a great deal from the adept camerawork.
The filmmakers have a good instinct about what to photograph, resulting
in them showing some very key moments in the kids' lives.  Of course,
persistence is also a big contributor to this success. The filmmakers
reportly shot well over 100 hours of footage allowing them to choose
from a wide variety of material.  The ambition of the project
definitely pays off in the finished film.</P>
<P>     The fact that the film is showing the lives of real people
provides HOOP DREAMS with a very refreshing unpredictability.  Real
life doesn't have standard formulas like most fiction films.  There are
numerous surprises in the film thanks to the fact that we are being
shown real events as they actually happened.  This unpredictability is
most evident during the basketball scenes.  In most fictional movie
sporting events, it is easy to predict whether or not the heroes will
win the big game.  In this movie, the sporting events are all real with
an equal likelihood of winning or losing.</P>
<P>     As good as this film is, it isn't perfect.  At times, the
filmmakers seemed a little too interested in the basketball games. It
certainly was necessary to show a lot of footage of the boys' playing,
but the filmmakers often feel that the games speak for themselves.  It
eventually begins to seem repetitive.  The later basketball sequences
were the only times that I found myself noticing the film's length.
The movie really needed to elaborate on what these games *meant* to the
people involved.  I would have liked to have heard Gates, Agee, and
their family *commenting* during some of the game sequences.  Instead,
we get nothing but James providing dry, purely descriptive commentary
on what is happening.</P>
<P>     Another problem is probably inherent to the documentary form.  The
subjects are clearly aware of the presense of the camera and are
understandably unwilling to show some of their more unhappy
experiences.  There are hints of certain key events that clearly didn't
happen while the camera was present.  In particular, we are given some
sketchy details about problems with Agee's father.  We are told that he
has a drug problem and that he left the family a couple times, but
there is a definite feeling that many of the details were kept from the
cameras.  We learn a lot about these people, but it is hard not to feel
that there was a lot going on that we *don't* learn.</P>
<P>     The film's origin as a TV project causes a major technical problem
when seeing it in a movie theater.  Most of the footage was shot on
videotape which does not transfer extremely well to 35mm film.  The
whole film is visibly blurred, making it a bit difficult to watch.  The
blurring particularly made it difficult to follow many of the
basketball sequences.  The cathartic effects of seeing this film with a
crowd makes it worth seeing in a theater, but this is a very rare case
of a film that will *look* considerably better on video.</P>
<P>     In the long run, these flaws do not take much away from the power
of this film.  HOOP DREAMS provides a fascinating look at some pivotal
events in some very real lives.  This is a very special film that
allows the viewer to meet some very special people.  It is an absolute
must-see film.</P>
