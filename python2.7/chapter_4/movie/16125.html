<PRE> A Civil Action
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 By MIchael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>A very rare number of people, at very rare times, are living their everyday
lives when they meet God on the road to Damascus. They're going to work.
They're shopping for groceries. They're paying bills. Suddenly there's a
blinding light and their reality changes completely.</P>
<P>They experience something that triggers a transformation in the way they view
the world. Old perceptions are out the window and a new way of being takes
over. Their previous life vanishes as a new passion overwhelms all.</P>
<P>Boston ambulance chaser Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta) has his revelation on
the road to Woburn. Stopped for his second speeding ticket on the same bridge
on the same day, Jan glances out on the Aberjona River and soon everything is different.</P>
<P>The attorney is a high profile personal injury lawyer. Named one of the ten
most eligible bachelors in the city, he dresses sharp and aims for the
jugular. With his eye on the financial prize, he has reduced his clients to
dollar signs.</P>
<P>He wheels a crippled man down the courtroom hall and his voice-over explains
the worth of a human being in the civil legal system. A living man is worth
more than a dead one. A man, more than a woman. White, more than black. A dead
child is worth the least of all.</P>
<P>A partner presents the firm with a possible case. Eight children have died of
leukemia in the small industrial town of Woburn. The families suspect the
water is contaminated and they want someone to apologize.</P>
<P>Jan meets with the parents and explains legal reality to them. For him to take
the case, there must be someone to sue...someone with a hefty bank account.
With no big bucks in sight, he's not going to do anything about it.</P>
<P>Looking down the river on the way back, Jan decides to take a walk. He finds
two factories on the shore that may be responsible for polluting the water
supply. Then he notices something on the side of a truck that changes his mind
about the case. A sign says that one of the businesses is "a division of
Beatrice." He's found his deep pockets.</P>
<P>The tiny firm takes on Beatrice Foods and W.R. Grace & Co., two of the
country's largest corporations, in a classic David versus Goliath battle. In
this war, the weapons aren't stones but dollars. As Jan explains, in a big
civil case the plan is to spend more than you need in order to make it bigger,
"The first side that comes to their senses loses."</P>
<P>As the case wears on, the lawyers for the families are running out of
ammunition. They borrow money, mortgage their houses, buy lottery tickets and
finally sell the furniture. In one scene, they're sitting on the floor in
empty offices with no desks trying to figure out how they can dig themselves
out of their financial hole.</P>
<P>They are in it for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. If they win this
one, they win big. Jan, however, has a different obsession. He's lost sight of
the money and wants the companies brought to justice. Even after the trial
becomes a black hole for his legal firm, dragging down everyone, he refuses a
$25 million settlement offer because he wants the companies to admit responsibility.</P>
<P>Based on a true story that took place in the eighties, the film is an
indictment of the civil legal system. The account makes it clear that cases
aren't about truth, but rather theatrics, manipulations of the court and
negotiations between the sides. Although indeed they may have been, it's never
shown that Beatrice and W.R. Grace were responsible for the deaths. Despite
that, they were willing to lie in court, falsify evidence and spend huge
amounts of money for damage control. As Joni Mitchell sings, justice is often
"just ice."</P>
<P>Director and screenwriter Steven Zaillian ("Searching For Bobby Fischer" and
screenwriter of "Schindler's List") has done an admirable job assembling a
first-rate cast. There's not a weak link among the actors.</P>
<P>John Lithgow is Judge Walter Skinner, the somewhat self-righteous magistrate
who seems to be part of a good ole boys network with the opposing attorneys.
Dan Hedaya plays a smarmy owner of a tannery that has spilled toxic waste.
Kathleen Quinlan and David Thornton are touching as parents of children who
have died. William H. Macy's accountant James Gordon is a man under siege as
he tries to salvage the firm.</P>
<P>Robert Duvall, as Jerome Fancher, lawyer for Beatrice, is the standout of the
movie. Fancher is an eccentric who listens to baseball games on a cheap
transistor radio and carries a beat-up briefcase adorned with cartoon
stick-ons. His disarming bumpkin charm hides a shrewd legal mind. He is easy
to like although he works for the wrong side. Duvall nails the role and steals
the film.</P>
<P>Travolta is appropriately larger than life playing the flamboyant attorney,
but his character has a problem. Although we are supposed to believe that he
has abandoned his greed for a search for justice, we never see the change
happen. His actions are different, but he never warms up.</P>
<P>The cinematography and lighting create a moody feel in even the most mundane
scenes. Interviews with the parents are mostly talking heads, but are
riveting. During the explanation of a boy's death on the way to the hospital,
a shot of blinking taillights on a car stopped by the side of the road in the
rain is positively chilling.</P>
<P>The theme of water as a dangerous product works well. Water glasses take on
the same sinister image as our feathered friends did in "Birds". Especially in
this town where toxic waste threatening the water supply has been a concern
for decades, you won't be able to fill a glass from the faucet without having
second thoughts.</P>
