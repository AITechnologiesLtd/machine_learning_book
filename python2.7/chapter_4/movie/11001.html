THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT</PRE>
<P>Traditionally, the big-budget bio-pic has generally been reserved for 
historical figures of great nobility or significance (Mozart, Malcolm X, 
Gandhi, Oscar Schindler, etc.), so it's somewhat jarring at first to 
see unredeemed '70s smut-meister Larry Flynt get the same treatment. The 
fact that it turned out to be one of the best pictures of 1996 is 
equally surprising, until you realize the amount of talent involved. As 
his previous films ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and AMADEUS have 
shown, director Miles Forman has a knack for humanizing even the most 
potentially unredeemable characters, of which this film gives you a wide 
assortment. (The scriptwriters, Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewksi, 
seem to be making a career out of stories about the historically 
unsavory; they also wrote ED WOOD, and are presently working on a 
screenplay about the late, great, and totally freakin' nuts comedian 
Andy Kaufman.)</P>
<P>The cast is up for the challenge as well. In the lead role, Woody 
Harrelson does a wonderful job playing a man whose very outrageousness 
and outward loathsomeness make him strangely appealing: his best scenes 
occur late in the film, after Flynt has been paralyzed from the waist 
down and starts taking his war against censorship to a new level in the 
courts. Courtney Love, no stranger to controversy in her own life, gives 
a jawdroppingly good performance as Althea, Flynt's drug addicted, 
ex-stripper wife; the role might not be much of a stretch for her, but 
the amount of feeling she invests into it is amazing. The standout, 
though, is Edward Norton as Flynt's long suffering lawyer. After only 
two movies (PRIMAL FEAR and this one) he's already at the top of his 
field. His wonderfully naturalistic final summation in front of the 
Supreme Court is the best scene in the film.</P>
<P>This movie isn't perfect; there are a few too many times when the 
heavy-handed moralizing of Executive Producer Oliver Stone can be caught 
peeking out from behind the curtain, but what it accomplishes is 
remarkable. I never thought that a movie about pornography could make 
you feel proud to be an American, but this one somehow does: by the end, 
I was ready to buy a flag.</P>
