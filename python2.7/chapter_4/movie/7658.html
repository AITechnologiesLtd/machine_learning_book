<P>"Apollo 13" seems more like an experiment in suspense rather than a movie,
because it is so well crafted in every way that we care about everything that
happens.This film is based on a true story, and although Hollywood has the
tendency to exaggerate, this one stays realistic and believable the entire
time. 
Tom Hanks stars as Captain Jim Lovell, one of the earliest astronauts, who
is slated to command Apollo 14 in 1970, but is bumped up to 13 and to a more
important mission. We meet Lovell's family and really get a sense this is a
real man, not another movie character. 
The story revolves around the flight of Apollo 13 to the moon. It has only
been a little over six months since man first walked on the moon, and this
was considered a "routine" space flight, but as Lovell points out, "There's
nothing routine about going to the moon." We see the crew training in
simulators, sometimes failing and this really makes you wonder if they'll be
able to handle it in the real situation. 
Lovell, along with his crewmates Fred Haise (Paxton), and Ken Mattingly
(Sinise) make up the core team, while Jack Swigert (Bacon) leads a backup
team. Two days before launch it is discovered that Mattingly is coming down
with a case of the measles and will not be able to go into space so Swigert
is assigned to take his place. The team must practice continually to prepare
in such a small amount of time. We see them say goodbye to their families and
this gives a good sense of humanism and realism.
Everything seems to be running smoothly... at first. Down in Houston they
tell the Apollo to do some routine procedures. All of a sudden, an explosion
occurs in one of the oxygen tanks and the ship goes haywire. As if the film
wasn't already a great drama it becomes a fantastic suspense story as we see
the Houston ground controllers panic in a frenzy, trying to figure out what
is going on and how to help them out. It is amazing to watch this, especially
today as we have much more advanced technology than they did. In fact, this
computer I'm typing this critique on might be smarter or more powerful than
all the computers used on the Apollo!
The movie really picks up the pace and runs with it at this point, every
second is nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat storytelling. As one problem is
solved, two more pop up. At times it seems like all hope is lost, but somehow
they miraculously survive. Hanks delivers a pretty good performance, but I
was even more amazed by Paxton and Bacon, who prove they can handle high
pressure roles like these.
Not too many movies could make me cry, but this film's ending could. The
suspense is based in the unknown and no one knows if the crew will ultimately
survive. We see short clips of Walter Cronkite reporting the events, showing
the entire planet praying for them. Cronkite's voice alone can make anything
seem emotional and sensational. 
"Apollo 13" is filled to capacity with emotion and sensation, you can't help
but be caught up in the suspense and drama. The story of the Apollo 13 needed
to be told, and this film did it justice. (12/31/95) (12/9/96) (5/23/97)
