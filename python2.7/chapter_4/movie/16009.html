<PRE>THE PARENT TRAP (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Nancy Meyers
Writers: Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer (based on the 1961 script by
David Swift and the book "Das Doppelite Lottchen" by Erich Kastner)
Starring: Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine
Hendrix, Lisa Ann Walter, Simon Kunz, Polly Holliday, Maggie Wheeler,
Ronnie Stevens, Joanna Barnes</P>
<P>I actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so Live-Action-Disney flick
of the same name starring Hayley Mills twice as a pair of twins,
separated at birth by divorcing parents, never to come in contact with
the other so the parents never have to meet again.  And everyone should
know how I feel about remakes, especially of films I happen to enjoy (my
fallacy: unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of
the original or do something different with it or maybe even both, just
wrack your brain and come up with a *gasp* new idea).  This remake was
not originally on the top of my viewing list, and was actually quite the
opposite.  Contemporary Live-Action-Disney films are not one of my
favorties, anyway: they're usually unfunny, alienating, and a big fat
bore, at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the IQ of 10.</P>
<P>This one, however, is shockingly not bad.  In fact, it's actually good.
Not the original good, but what's great about it is that it doesn't
necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it
does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was
entertaining.  Because it's cute and innocent fun.  Because it has a
pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with.  Because
the lead star is immensely appealing.  Because the parents are also
immensely appealing.  And (I'm repeating myself) because it's cute and
innocent fun.  There's nothing too risque about it, save the plot (the
idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is
ominously selfish, but that is precisely the point of the movie), and
it's aimed directly at either kids, adults who want to remember the
original, or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a
kid.</P>
<P>I, personally, am somewhere between the second and third.  I can vividly
remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse (the names
Godard and Kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then),
when I would tune in every Sunday night for a couple years to see ABC's
"Wonderful World of Disney," where they'd show you a Live-Action and/or
Made-for-TV Disney flick an hour per week.  I can remember my mom taking
my sister and I along with all my friends and their mothers to see all
the rereleased Disney films (like "Lady and the Tramp" and
"Pinnochio").  And, most sadly, I remember every single Christmas,
without fail, there were a barage of children's animated half-hour
shows, made exclusively for the Christmas season, that I wouldn't dare
missing.  I can even remember seeing the made-for-TV "Parent Trap II" on
TV one night, and after I had seen that one over and over and over
again, I saw the original "Parent Trap."  It's more of a late childhood
movie, because it deals with the issue of divorce, but it deals with it
in a Disney-ized version.  It's playful, and witty, and charming, and if
I saw it for the first time right now, having never experienced that
part of my childhood, I'd probably dismiss it.</P>
<P>I'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if I
hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age.  Watching it, I could
remember what fun it was to watch a Disney film, and how divorce for me
started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my
seemingly-perfect parents splitting up, and how it affected my
adolescence.  And also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth
stroke, and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations,
things could always work out if you, well, manipulate things a bit, at
least for the better.  This new version did that for me, but it's also
charming in its own way.  It has a new cast, a contemporary feel, and,
for the first time in awhile for a Live-Action-Disney flick, a tone that
isn't corny or condescending, but just right.  The moments that would
otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way.  And
for the first time since the original film, the kids actually know
better than the foolish adults.</P>
<P>The story is basically classic by now, repeated almost as many times as
Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai": a pair of twins (played here by Lindsay
Lohan, just like they were played by Hayley Mills in the original) are
separated at birth by their divorcing parents.  One, Annie, is sent to
live with the mother (Natasha Richardson, resembling her mother, Vanessa
Redgrave, more than I had ever noticed) in London, where she lives with
her parents and her devoted, foppish butler (Simon Kunz), as she works
as a swingin' fashion designer.  She grows up refined and classy, but
also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing.  The other,
Hallie, is sent to northern California with her father (Dennis Quaid) to
live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid (Lisa Ann Walter), and grows
up rugged yet charming.  They both meet at the same camp, one that Annie
wants to go to to become more rugged.  They feud because they look
all-too similar, and are thus in tight competition, which results in
some nasty pranks, which winds them in seclusion together in a private,
out-of-the-way cabin.  There, they become friends, then learn about
eachother.  Once they know everything, they concoct a scheme to switch
places so the one can meet the other parent, whom they've only heard
of.  They learn about eachother's lives in detail, they make sure they
look alike (which requires hair cutting and, notoriously, ear-piercing -
a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene
in "Pulp Fiction"), and when the end of summer comes, they switch and
hope for the best.</P>
<P>Lindsay Lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of Hayley Mills
in the original.  But she comes off just as appealing as she did once.
She does, though, add a couple new things: she makes the California twin
a little more appealing and the London twin a bit more frank and
snobbish than the snotty and proper original, respectively.  She also
adds on an American and British accent to each one, with one faking the
other accent throughout, and if you really take notice, you can see that
the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect.  She's also incredibly
appealing, not merely cute, which is especially notable since this is
her first feature film, and we know how notorious child actors are,
especially in their first films.  She makes a great protagonist, and it
only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing.</P>
<P>Dennis Quaid, in fact, hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his
big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable
actor in the past, not just that he's Mr. Meg Ryan.  Ditto Natasha
Richardson (except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period).
The two make a winning couple, maybe not so winning as Maureen O'Hara
and the late Brian Keith in the original, but they still work for this
film.  Instead of the bickering that ensued in the original, the film
adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was
amiss in the original: during the opening credits, we see glimpses from
their courtship on the QE2, where they fall quickly and madly in love
with eachother, and when back together again, the film's more smarmy
scenes come off as actually sentimental, but in that great way, not the
migraine-inducing way as in many such films.</P>
<P>This all brings this new "Parent Trap" to a level of entertainment that
hasn't really existed since, well, the original film years ago, still my
money the best Live-Action-Disney flick of all time.  This is because it
has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an
otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot (a gold-digging
Sharon Stone type, played by Elaine Hendrix, who's deliciously tormented
by the twins later on in the film) a treat instead of a bore.  Like the
original, this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be
(case in point: "It Takes Two" starring the Olsen Twins) because it
treats the children as the smart ones, and the adults as the silly ones,
not the other way around.  And because, above everything, it knows
exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew.</P>
<P>However, in comparison with the original, it could be a bit better.
Certain scenes work well, but not nearly as well as they worked in the
original.  I liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and
then fought over falling in love again better than I liked watching two
old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow,
feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing, a
lesson extracted from the Howard Hawks/Cary Grant films of yesteryear.
And as much as this film transcends mere cutedom, compared to the
original, this film almost drowns in cutedom.  The original, though not
gritty, was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences
as it was for young audiences.  As such, this remake may never be nearly
as great or classic as the original film, but it at least knows how to
treat its source material with dignity and respect, and how to create
virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty
annoyances.</P>
