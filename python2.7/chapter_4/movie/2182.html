<P>At some time or another, every generation has a movie made about it.  
DAZED AND CONFUSED is for the 70s' crowd:  that group of Americans who 
came of age when bellbottoms, love beads, mantras, and marijuana were the 
fashion, drinking and driving hadn't become taboo, and safe sex was used 
to only avoid pregnancy or VD.  As the United States reached her 
bicentennial, Vietnam was over - if the memories still lingered on - and 
the short-lived disco craze was building to a frenzy that SATURDAY NIGHT 
FEVER would both exploit and exacerbate.</P>
<P>This movie begins on the last day of the 1975-76 school year, and ends 
less than twenty-four hours later.  For Randy "Pink" Floyd (Jason London) 
and his friends, it's the end of their tenure as high school juniors, and 
with the final bell of the last period, they have reached the ultimate 
goal for teenagers - they are seniors.  At the local junior high school, 
Mitch Kramer (Wiley Wiggins) and his cohorts have a serious problem to 
consider.  They are members of the incoming freshman class and, as part 
of a time-honored tradition, they are about to be totally and painfully 
humiliated by the new seniors.  </P>
<P>DAZED AND CONFUSED explores the beginning of the 1976 summer from the 
varying perspectives of an unusual group of characters.  Just about every 
type is represented:  the timid nerd looking for a way to break out of 
his shell, the mindless jock, the overaged twentysomething guy who likes 
hanging out with teenagers, the blond bombshell, the stoned-out-of-his 
mind pot addict, and the timid newcomer.  In his attempts to avoid making 
his characters into caricatures, writer/director Richard Linklater is 
only partially successful.  Most of what works with the youthful 
population of DAZED AND CONFUSED is due more to the performances of a 
fine cast than the writing.</P>
<P>There isn't much to this picture.  The storyline is minimal and the 
characters' personalities are as hazy as the marijuana-drenched 
atmosphere.  What Linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on 
an era seventeen years in the past.  This is 1976, from the music and 
cars (which combined cost a huge chunk of the $6 million budget), to the 
people and their attitudes.  You'd have to climb into a time machine to 
get a better view.</P>
<P>Comparisons with AMERICAN GRAFFITI are warranted, remembering, of course, 
that this is the next generation.  Both have similar aims, but while 
GRAFFITI's plot may have been no less insignificant than that of DAZED 
AND CONFUSED, its characters are better defined.  At times, Linklater 
seems too wrapped up in getting everything about the time period right.  
While the directors of both films care about their characters, George 
Lucas does a better job of transferring that feeling to the audience.</P>
<P>The two characters that we get the most of - Randy and Mitch - manage to 
capture our sympathies - at least most of the time.  My complaint has 
nothing to do with them, but with everyone else.  Except during an 
occasional scene or two, I had no feeling one way or another about 
anybody except those two.  Had virtually the entire senior class died in 
a car wreck, I wouldn't have batted an eyelash.</P>
<P>The cast is one of new or barely-recognizable names and face (Michelle 
Burke, who went on to do CONEHEADS, is among the few who might tweak the 
memory), all of whom do excellent jobs.  None of the principals can have 
a clear memory of 1976 (unless they're a lot older than they look), yet 
they play their roles like they lived through it.  Most memorable of all 
is Wiley Wiggins' Mitch, who performs almost every scene (including one 
where he buys his first six-pack) with an affecting blend of charm and 
realism.</P>
<P>Ensemble movies are something of a rarity these days, so it's a bit odd 
that this is the third one I've seen in a week (the other two being 
TWENTY BUCKS and SHORT CUTS).  If done right, these types of films can be 
riveting.  And, while Linklater doesn't have all the pieces in place for 
a superlative work, he has chosen a group of young actors capable of 
doing all - and probably more - that he asks of them.</P>
<P>My impression of DAZED AND CONFUSED is that it's light entertainment 
suitable for a night out, but nothing more.  The comedy isn't as sharply-
honed as it might be, but it's effective in this context.  This film was 
made to celebrate a dead culture, and those who were part of, or are 
merely curious about, will find a path into the past through this motion 
picture.  </P>
<P>DAZED AND CONFUSED is irresponsible and politically incorrect - and 
almost worth applauding on those grounds alone.  Had it possessed a 
little more substance, I would have heartily championed the film, but as 
it is, I can give it little more than a lukewarm recommendation.  If 
nothing else, it surely defines the era, and reminds me more of the 
things I hated than loved about 1976.</P>
