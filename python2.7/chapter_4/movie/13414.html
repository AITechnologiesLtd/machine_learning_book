<PRE>starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Chris Rock
                                   screenplay by Channing Gibson
                                     directed by Richard Donner</PRE>
<P>In the first Lethal Weapon, Mel Gibson's character Martin Riggs would
break into "Three Stooges" routines and
handcuff himself to suicidal jumpers-these were actions meant to
characterize an insane, unstable human being.
They called him a "lethal weapon"; he had a death wish for both anyone
who crossed him and, most importantly, for
himself. 1998 brings us LETHAL WEAPON 4 and the plot itself has become
something of a Three Stooges routine,
with Gibson, Glover (as Roger "Too Old For This Shit" Murtaugh) and
Pesci (as opportunistic Leo Getz) doing
everything but bashing each other with sledge hammers and "nyuk
nyuk"-ing. It is precisely for this reason that
some will dismiss or dislike LETHAL WEAPON 4, while others will find
comfort in its familiarity and congenial
tone.</P>
<P>While fishing one night, said lethal trio encounter a slave ship;
naturally, a gunfight ensues, with Triad members
protecting their boatload of Chinese immigrants. Riggs and
Murtaugh-promoted to police captains this time
around-eventually uncover a secret: Chinese families are being traded as
slaves in some sort of underground
operation in Los Angeles' Chinatown district. Murtaugh elects to hide
one of the families at his house until the case
is solved, which triggers a chain reaction of violence. Wah Sing Ku (Jet
Li) pursues Murtaugh and his stolen family;
Ku employs lightning-fast Martial Arts moves as well as a team of
shameless yes-men who strike at the captains in
water, on land, and in water again. Meanwhile, Murtaugh's daughter is
pregnant (Murtaugh doesn't know the baby
belongs to Lee Butters (Rock), a detective who gamely joins the
investigation), as is Gibson's girlfriend (Rene
Russo, kicking up a storm as she did in the last instalment, even whilst
bearing a child).</P>
<P>Jet Li moves with such speed and grace his movements almost provoke
laughter in the fight scenes: since Riggs
and Murtaugh are no match for Ku, the hand-to-hand combat plays like
slapstick. I was reminded of that Bugs
Bunny cartoon in which Bugs gets into a ring with a heavyweight boxer
(or is it wrestler?) and wins because he
better understands the laws of cartoon physics; likewise, Gibson and
Glover exercise enough movie-logic-and
they have the benefit of three prequels under their belt-to put up a
good fight. The action scenes (which also
include Riggs riding a coffee table-yes, coffee table-along the L.A.
Freeway as he is dragged by a truck) are
thrilling and inventive and satisfyingly ludicrous, but they seem like
an afterthought. Whenever the banter runs on
too long, something blows up. This isn't a problem, really, since the
banter is relaxed, cute, and, despite the
presence of much profanity, harmless. Gone is the dark heart of Lethal
Weapon 2; director Donner has turned the
franchise into something of a Sunday dinner-is it any wonder he included
photos of the cast and crew goofing
around off-camera as part of the end-credit sequence? Rock makes a nice
addition to the cast, but Pesci has worn
out his welcome. He's a terrific actor, but his performance has
degenerated over three movies into a one-note
impersonation of his original portrayal of Leo Getz. He has a nice
moment at the end of the picture, delivering a
sweet monologue, but it's too little, too late. Jet Li, on the other
hand, is a charismatic presence. I hope his
inevitable journey through the Hollywood machine lands him a film in
which he has a worthy opponent and a decent
screenplay supporting him.</P>
<P>Some critics have complained that LETHAL WEAPON 4 is completely
extraneous, that it has nothing to say. Did
this series ever have something to say? I for one fell in with its tone
and rolled with it-the worst scene in this movie
is better than the best scene in, say, Armageddon or Godzilla. Yet I'm
not exactly thrilled with the prospect of
LETHAL WEAPON 5; everyone involved really is getting too old for this
shit.</P>
