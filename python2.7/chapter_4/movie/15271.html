Susan Granger's review of "ELIZABETH" (Gramercy Pictures)</PRE>
<P>If President Clinton watched this film, he might find a way out
of his current dilemma using historical precedent. He could simply
declare himself a virgin! That's what Queen Elizabeth I did when her
lover betrayed her. Not only did she repudiate all her previous romps
between the sheets but, according to screenwriter Michael Hirst, she
never indulged in pleasures of the flesh again! Directed by
Dehli-based Shekar Kapur ("Bandit Queen"), this Tudor tale begins with
three Protestants being burned at the stake. If you weren't a
Catholic, that was your fate under zealous Queen Mary I. Mercifully,
after Mary's death in November, 1558, her half-sister Elizabeth,
daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, was proclaimed Queen of
England. This young girl (Cate Blanchett), returns from exile along
with her childhood sweetheart, Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes) to
attend to matters of state - which include her country's bankruptcy,
lack of army, and serious threats from abroad. Her chief advisor
(Richard Attenborough) quickly warns her, "Until you marry and produce
an heir, you will find no security."  But she's not eager to do either
- in fact, she never does, despite proposals from both Spain and
France. Instead, she relies on her dour, enigmatic Master of Spies
(Geoffrey Rush) to guide her from sensual dalliances into developing
her supreme authority, which eventually includes chopping off her red
hair, painting her face dead white, and eschewing men. "How many
people have worshipped and died for this woman?" she muses, gazing at
her inspiration: the Virgin Mary. Filled with incessant intrigue and
boudoir betrayals, on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Elizabeth"
is a powerful, pungent 7. Consider this: Queen Elizabeth I bathed only
once a year and even that was considered excessive.</P>
