<PRE>The Dresser (1983)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 75</PRE>
<P>"The Dresser" is a British production starring
Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay.  Derived from
Ronald Harwood's stage play, it has a quality
script and characters with some depth.  It
compares favorably with most Hollywood projects,
which, in their search for young audiences,
would avoid tackling such a film that appeals
to older demographics.</P>
<P>The story takes place during World War II.
Despite endless bombing raids by the Germans,
a group of middle-aged and elderly Shakespearean
actors is giving performances throughout England.
Finney always plays the lead role, and is the
famous actor whose drawing power sustains the
troup.  Unfortunately, he suffers a nervous
breakdown, and it is up to his loyal dresser
Norman (Courtenay) to get him through his
performance.</P>
<P>The film has multiple themes.  Finney's character
must confront his stage fright, and his fear of
impending death.  The courage of the British
people is demonstrated by their risking their
lives to attend sell-out performances.  The
unsung, unrewarded back-stage staff, without
whom the show cannot go on, are represented by
Norman.</P>
<P>Finney is a marvelous actor, and his blustery
manner and booming voice are perfect for his
character.  Indifferent to the feelings of
others, he lashes at his staff for inadequacy
after they have exhausted themselves trying
to simulate a thunderstorm for a play.</P>
<P>Courtenay is less effective, as he camps up
his alcoholic, blatantly homosexual role.
Both actors, however, received Academy Award
nominations for Best Actor.  The film was also
nominated for Best Picture, Best Director
(Peter Yates) and Best Adapted Screenplay
(Harwood, adapting his own play).</P>
