<PRE>                           THE ENGLISH PATIENT
                       A film review by John Bauer
                        Copyright 1997 John Bauer</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>Accepting his Oscar as producer of this year's Best Picture winner, Saul
Zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over.  One could almost say the same
about his much-prized film.  Rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent
imagery, symbolism, ideas and metaphors, complex and literate storytelling,
all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant
scrutiny, an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the
truth.  In short, the antithesis of all things Hollywood.  Yet this surfeit
of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story
whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind.</P>
<P>Ralph Fiennes is the title character, an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual
return to memory, and particularly the memory of love, is the ostensible
focus of the film.  But despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put
the pieces of this personal puzzle together, we never learn enough about the
man to feel much empathy for him.  His emotional life before the story begins
is an essential clue that remains withheld.  The same can easily be said for
every other character in the film, of which there are too many.</P>
<P>Juliette Binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional
heart.  At least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those
close to her, and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of
her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious,
disfigured, dying stranger.  Even this information is imparted so quickly and
in such cursory fashion, however, that it verges on the comical.</P>
<P>With so many characters enjoying so little screen time, the film's 160
minutes can be taxing.  Yet there is something so captivating about the
sensibility behind the camera that I couldn't help but feel that greatness
was in the air.  Hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership
but wants desperately to possess his lover; in ancient cave paintings of
swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the Sahara; in the way
the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world
war.  There is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with
paper topics for years.  But ultimately the emotional truths writer-director
Anthony Minghella was grasping for were never revealed.</P>
<P>In the end, I was left with the impression that I had witnessed quite an
oxymoron:  a haunting bore.  Bore is perhaps too strong a word.  But after
drinking in the rich production values, the cup remains only slightly over
half-full.</P>
