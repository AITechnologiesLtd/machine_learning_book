<PRE>M (1931)</PRE>
<P>Dir: Fritz Lang
Starring: Peter Lorre, Gustaf Grundgens, Otto Wernicke, Theodor Loos</P>
<PRE>RATING: **** / ****</PRE>
<P>[Before I start I should point out that I'm not absolutely sure which
version I am commenting on - I suspect it was the recent Munich
version]</P>
<P>In a seedy 1930s city Peter Lorre's child murderer picks off his
victims by offering them balloons and candy. The authorities are
powerless to stop him, and tension, mistrust and suspicion amongst the
citizens are bubbling to the surface. Criminal gangs, threatened by
the increased police presence determine that they will hunt down the
perpetrator, whilst Otto Wernicke's homicide inspector follows up his
own leads.</P>
<P>A mother waits in her apartment for her daughter to return from school
but she never arrives. A little girl's ball bounces into view and
stops. Her balloon is shown fluttering tangled against power lines.
Lang conveys the essence of the horror of a subject familiar today,
but what makes this a truly important film is the philosophical
content: is Lorre's Hans Beckert a monster to be destroyed like an
animal, or is the situation more complex: is a compulsive child
murderer more or less culpable than a ruthless mafia boss who is free
to do otherwise? Should we think in terms of treatment? Is he
deserving of sympathy, or is he beneath contempt? Where does the
legitimacy of punishment come from?</P>
<P>All power in the city is shown as corrupt and decadent: the well-fed
homicide squad, the well dressed gangsters become one in their hunt
for the killer. This moral equivalence is emphasised by a particularly
effective sequence where the discussions of the two groups are
intercut, Lang seemingly not impressed by the police. In scenes like
this Lang evokes a grim and jaded image of a decaying and ineffectual
system, and the panic ruling the place. In the film he shows no love
for his home, and indeed left soon afterwards.</P>
<P>The killer is revealed early on, and with his wide eyes and child-like
face seems grotesque but not the ultimate embodiment of evil. Beckert
is a man who probably plays marbles with children when he is not
abducting them, one character remarks. As he is tracked down and
finally cornered his fear is palpable, making him the victim too of
his terrible impulses.</P>
<P>In genre terms this is probably a police procedural, though it is also
a gangster film. There is surprisingly little suspense as the net of
criminals closes on Beckert: instead the more effective and truly
shocking section of the film is the question of what the kangaroo
court will do to him. I won't reveal the ending here, and I suppose I
should point out that the ending will differ according to the version
you see. There is no satisfactory conclusion however, in keeping with
its subject-matter.</P>
<P>In many ways "M" is startlingly modern: Lang's direction would not
feel out of place today, and the situation is not an alien one either.
The terms of the debate are still the same, as the script he wrote
with Thea von Harbou shows. All the familiar positions are laid out:
the feelings of a city terrorised by the child-murderer (if Beckert is
handed over to the police he will plead insanity, be placed in an
asylum and possibly escape to kill again). A woman shouts that he
cannot know how it feels to lose a child. The acting defence counsel
argues that he is not responsible for his actions, and not even the
state should be allowed to kill him. Gustaf Grundgens' underworld boss
wants him "eliminated", since he has admitted that his behaviour is
compulsive. The criminal fraternity sees a wide distinction between
themselves and this "monster", though Schraenker has killed three men
at least. Someone else says that, "Ill people are treated by doctors
and not executioners". </P>
<P>By the end the issue is as unclear as ever, but Lang has succeeded in
making us ask some unsettling questions. "M" is a disturbing film, as
it was intended to be, but it also has great artistic qualities. If it
were released today it would shock just as much, if not more, than
when originally released. This is one of the most incredible films to
have emerged out of inter-war Germany, and if you get the all too rare
opportunity to see the movie take it.</P>
