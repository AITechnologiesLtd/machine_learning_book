<PRE>                              NUNS ON THE RUN
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1990)</PRE>
<P>        There are only a few contemporary actors who can make fans laugh
simply by appearing on screen.  These actors don't have to do anything
funny; just looking at them brings on the giggles.  Woody Allen and John
Cleese are prime examples, and if you ask me, so is Eric Idle, who--unlike
Cleese--has been woefully underutilized by filmmakers since Monty Python
disbanded.</P>
<P>        Finally, seven years after MEANING OF LIFE, Idle has a starring
role (opposite Robbie Coltrane) in NUNS ON THE RUN.  NUNS, unfortunately,
is a mindless, unoriginal caper comedy, but thanks to Idle's elastic face
and silly expressions, the movie is thoroughly entertaining.  We're talking
dumb but fun.</P>
<P>        Idle and Coltrane play aging crooks who are looking to go straight.
As the title suggests, they end up hiding in a convent, disguised as nuns.
Idle, who is no stranger to appearing in drag, brings his customary flair
to the role.  Coltrane, as Idle's partner in crime, plays his part well,
but he doesn't have Idle's comic pizazz.  Camille Coduri, who plays Idle's
love-interest, is adorable in a Goldie Hawn sort of way.</P>
<P>        Writer-director Jonathan Lynn throws gag after gag at the screen,
and only some of them stick.  The movie's appeal derives more from the
comic performances than from Lynn's uneven screenplay, which relies too
much on cheap, physical humor.  NUNS ON THE RUN is no FISH CALLED WANDA,
but it's nearly impossible to resist Eric Idle as a nun.</P>
