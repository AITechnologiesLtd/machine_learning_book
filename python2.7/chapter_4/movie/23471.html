<P>This is a B-movie...actually, this is probably more like a parody of a
B-movie, but a connaisseur of the B-movies you must be in order to truly
appreciate it. Remember that rash of sci-fi/horror flicks from the 50s with
such titles as IT CAME FROM ANOTHER PLANET, THEM! and THE ATTACK OF THE
GIANT LEECHES? Well, consider this a polished up version which combines all
those films with their proverbial small towns being taken over by aliens, a
bearded scientist with a pipe, your attentive damsel falling for the egghead
and enough cheesy scares and ridiculously funny lines to qualify as a
midnight movie success.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A world famous atomic scientist visits a small town during the 1950s, just
in time to witness the beginning of various strange disappearances and
murders. With the town's crazy sheriff, the only cute girl and her dumbass
brother in tow, the doctor begins to suspect the invasion of aliens, as more
and more bodies begin to pile up.</P>
<PRE>CRITIQUE:
This movie is what MARS ATTACKS! should have been!</PRE>
<P>You will either really like this movie or not "get" this movie at all. Now
am I insulting those who won't enjoy this movie? Not at all, in fact, I
could see why some people wouldn't like it, but that's the whole point of
its existence. It's basically only made for those people who like cheesy
B-movies, enjoy the goofiness of some of those over-the-top 50s flicks,
appreciate the purposely bad dialogue (as opposed to those who think it's
"stupid") and essentially know enough about the genre to truly "give it up"
to all involved with this creation. This movie is funny, it's original, it's
engaging, it has gore, it has pseudo-romance, clever dialogue, and most
importantly and unlike those films that it's satirizing, it actually has
some great actors impersonating bad ones. One actor who truly made this film
stand out was Campbell Scott, playing an admirable scientist who is always
spouting such insightful lines as "that interference in the transmission is
definitely being caused by...oh, some sort of interference to be sure". This
is the man who actually believes that "with our government in place, no harm
will come to us". Campbell plays his straight man perfectly, delivering
every cheezy line with grand bravado and utter confidence. I'd watch this
movie again just to watch him work the script over so well. Whatta man!</P>
<P>But parody aside, this film still managed to hold my attention and entertain
me fully with its albeit flimsy story line, goofball characters and fun
dialogue. In fact, that's probably what I liked most about it. Its story was
simple, but fun to watch. Unlike many of the movies coming out nowadays,
this film actually kept my interest the whole way through, didn't go past
one hour and thirty minutes, and even managed to slip in some pretty gross
scenes and even a couple of decent special effects. What can I say...this
was a perfect remake/parody of a bunch of bad, sci-fi horror flicks that
seemed to achieve most its goals. Okay, so the film started off a little
slow, and a few of its jokes were really over the top (such as a couple of
scenes which featured characters singing that simply didn't work for me).
But all in all, the movie took a little bit from the INVASION OF THE BODY
SNATCHERS, a piece of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, plenty of those 50s sci-fi
flicks and a lot of obvious loving care for the genre, and created a fun,
contemporary cinematic soufflé. So if you like screaming close-ups, enjoyed
the kitchiness of those ol' sci-fi/monster movies, want to see Campbell
Scott pull off a hilarious straight man doctor and have been waiting for
something original to come down the pikes, well wait no longer, cause this
movie is it!</P>
<P>And if you really want to have some fun, gather up your friends, drinks some
beers, get a cheap buzz going, bring along a sack full o' nachos and catch
the midnight show, cause that's what this movie is all about.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Screenwriter Phil Bedard was at my screening and when asked, told me that
the film would be released in Canada on the 10th of March, 2000, but that it
has yet to find a distributor in the U.S. He said that it would all depend
on how well the film plays up here, but that it might just end up on HBO.
Either way, I suggest you catch this fun movie wherever you can.
Actor Campbell Scott is the son of legendary actor George C. Scott and
actress Colleen Dewhurst.
Director John Paizs is probably best known for the last movie that he
directed, which was way back in 1986, called CRIME WAVE. Also known as THE
BIG CRIME WAVE on video.</P>
