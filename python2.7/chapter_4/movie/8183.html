<PRE>                            MRS. BROWN</PRE>
<P>Despite the unprepossessing but quite appropriate name of MRS. BROWN,
the film is the very best so far this year   "Superb, Intriguing, Gripping," all come to mind in this true story of England's Queen Victoria (Judy Dench) and her servant, John Brown (Billy Connolly) with whom she fell in love.  Seldom has History been more interestingly brought to the screen.</P>
<P>A mere eighteen when she was married to Albert, Queen Victoria went into deep depression when her husband died.   Not wishing to see anyone, unable to be consoled, she had a profound effect on the country she ruled.  While at first England extended great sympathy to their beloved Queen after the passage of a few years during which she partook of no ceremonies, the public began to feel somewhat short-changed.</P>
<P>1864.  The Queen decides she needs someone to care for her horses. The man hired is John Brown, a tall and handsome Scotsman.  As if part of a romantic novel, the Queen falls in love with him, much to the dismay of her children, the rest of her family and of her loyal subjects who are unhappy about this commoner, this servant.   Everyone begins to resent and babble about Brown who is always at her side. He has assigned himself as her protector, as a kind of security guard and not even her son, The Prince of Wales (David Westhead), can have an audience with her unless Brown gives his assent.  But the Queen? She has not been this alive in many years.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, a storm is brewing, aided by the gossip newspapers of that day in rumor-mongering who now refer to the Queen as "Mrs. Brown."  Even Prime Minister Disraeli (Anthony Sher) comes to call on Brown to  tell him the queen must come out of hiding and return to Windsor to partake in the events of the country or the monarchy may be in grave danger.</P>
<P>This then is a true romantic story of great love and loyalty taking place on the highest plateaus of nobility.  To relieve the tenseness of the main story, there are the three Maids-in-Waiting who march just behind the queen in case she wants something.  When she stops her brisk walk, they stop.  The director has choreographed that episode into a quaint ballet-like humorous sequence.</P>
<P>No review of MRS. BROWN could be complete without mentioning the very
MEMORABLE performance by Judy Dench, at times imperious, and other
times, just a vulnerable woman who loves a man regardless of the consequences and who forbids him to ever leave her.   Connolly, as the object of her love, is very believable; little wonder that a queen would fall in love with him . . . kilt and all.</P>
<P>Mention, too, must be made of the screenplay and literate dialogue by Jeremy Brock, as well as the music composed by Stephen Warbeck.  The fact is, everyone in the cast is first class in this most entertaining film.</P>
<PRE>                      Directed by John Madden.
