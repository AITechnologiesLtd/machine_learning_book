                                  THE CROW              
                        A Film Review by Scott Renshaw 
                         Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw </PRE>
<P>Starring:  Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, Rochelle Davis.
Screenplay:  David Schow and John Shirley. 
Director:  Alex Proyas.</P>
<P>     I have seen a number of reviewers falling over themselves to
praise THE CROW, and I'm not convinced that many of them haven't been 
unduly influenced by the film's morbid history.  As it is now well-
known, star Brandon Lee was killed during the filming of THE CROW, and 
consequently its storyline of a man returning from the dead to bring 
closure to his life hits close enough to home to create a natural 
fascination.  I, like many, hoped that THE CROW would serve as a 
fitting epitaph to a budding star, and show that he hadn't died simply 
to make another schlocky action-fantasy.  But sadly, that's basically 
what THE CROW is--a paper thin story supporting a lot of rain and 
moody lighting.</P>
<P>     Lee stars as Eric Draven, a rock guitarist killed when he
enters his fiancee's apartment as she is being raped, and eventually 
killed herself.  One year later, a supernatural crow causes Eric to 
burst forth from his grave, endowed with superhuman abilities 
including the ability to take a truckload of bullets and keep on 
ticking.  One by one he hunts down the gang responsible for his death 
and that of his fiancee, assisted along the way by the cop (Ernie 
Hudson) who worked the original case.  At the top of Eric's list is 
Top Dollar (Michael Wincott), the city crimelord who ordered the 
killing, and who proves to be Eric's most dangerous challenge.</P>
<P>     All right, let's dispense with the formalities right off the
top:  THE CROW *looks* great.  Director Alex Proyas (an Australian 
previously best known for music videos) and his production team have 
captured the grim feel of James O'Barr's graphic novel; the cross- 
cutting to flashbacks, freeze frames and evocative lighting all have a 
distinct comic book feel.  But there is very little THE CROW does 
visually that BLADE RUNNER or BATMAN didn't already do, and for the 
most part do better.  Proyas wheels out cliches like the cityscape on 
fire opening shot, the close-up of the hero's face dripping with rain, 
and lightning revealing something previously hidden in shadow. While 
the art direction and cinematography are striking, there is nothing 
original enough to obscure the glaring weaknesses in the rest of the 
film.</P>
<P>     The trouble begins with the script by David Schow and John
Shirley, but the fact is that there's no way of knowing what changes 
were made as a result of Lee's death.  Perhaps the original script 
didn't begin with Eric and Shelly already dead, giving more poignance 
to the story and a chance to understand what Eric has lost beyond the 
snippets shown in flashback.  Perhaps it included a scene between Eric 
and Sarah (Rochelle Davis), the young street kid who is his friend in 
life, where Eric confronts the fact that he can't have friends in 
death.  As it stands, there is not enough pain in Eric's 
characterization, not enough opportunity for us to see him responding 
to the circumstance in which he finds himself.  Eric should go about 
his business full of rage, not like the wise-cracking vigilante he 
becomes.</P>
<P>     What is true of Eric's characterization is true of the
characterizations right down the line:  they're either lazy, or they 
just don't make sense.  Rochelle Davis is the tough-but-victimized 
urchin with a skateboard; Ernie Hudson plays a gruff-but- 
compassionate cop.  Michael Wincott does fine work as the villain, but 
the attempt to explain his motivation is one of the lamest in recent 
memory.  And the rest of the villains appear to have been Xeroxed from 
ROBOCOP.</P>
<P>     However, I'm willing to admit that there may be only two
relevant questions for most potential viewers of THE CROW: 1) Is it a 
good action film?  2) Was Brandon Lee headed towards stardom?  The 
answer to #1 is, better than most; THE CROW is well paced, well 
choreographed and is at least somewhat creative.  As for #2, it's hard 
to say.  Unlike most action stars, Lee at least had English as his 
native language, and given time he might have become a good actor.  
But in THE CROW, he wasn't yet.  And I can't help but think that if he 
were alive today, most critics wouldn't have bee so forgiving.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 crows:  5.</PRE>
