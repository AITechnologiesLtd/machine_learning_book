<PRE>THE SIXTH SENSE (1999)
Directed by M. Night Shyamalan
Review © 1999 Scott J. Promish</PRE>
<P>At the start of THE SIXTH SENSE, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), an
award-winning child psychologist, is confronted in his bedroom by an
intruder who turns out to be a severely disturbed former patient.  The young
man, angry that Crowe was unable to help him, shoots him after some ranting
and then turns the gun on himself.</P>
<P>Cut to `the next fall.'  Crowe's current case is a young boy named Cole
(Haley Joel Osment).  Cole is a lonely outsider, considered a freak at
school.  He seems to have hallucinations, and he later confides to Crowe
that he sees the ghosts of people who don't know they're dead yet.  Crowe
throws himself full into his work, determined to make up for his previous
failure.  In the process, he loses touch with his wife, who has not only
stopped speaking to him, but who is having an affair with a coworker.</P>
<P>THE SIXTH SENSE is being marketed as a horror film but it's barely a
thriller.  There's nothing scary in the film; just a few minor,
clumsily-executed gross-outs (LAWN DOGS' Mischa Barton dripping puke; well I
guess if she suddenly appeared in my bedroom like that I'd be frightened
too.)  Worse, nothing happens to move the story forward.  The characters are
bores and there is no development in themselves or in their relationships
with each other.  The picture is drab and dull, both visually and because of
the flat performances.</P>
<P>Having grown up on ‘The Twilight Zone' and ‘Alfred Hitchcock Presents', I've
always been fond of twist endings, and the one that caps off THE SIXTH SENSE
is good if not completely new.  But it fails to be the revelation it should
have been.  By the time it arrived I was so numb from the rest of the
picture that it had almost no impact.  What's more, it offers no resolution
to the main story of the film.  No one is better or worse off than they were
at the start.  For a film that felt so long to sit through, it's a
frustrating disappointment.</P>
