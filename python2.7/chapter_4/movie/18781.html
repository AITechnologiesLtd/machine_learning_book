<P>"Ready to Wear" was Robert Altman's disappointing
successor to 1992's "The Player".  This time,
Altman targets a prestigious fashion show in
Paris, with the message that everyone involved
in the fashion industry is shallow, conceited and
eccentric.  Even assuming that this sweeping
stereotype is correct, it is insufficient grounds
for a film that is over two hours long.</P>
<P>Another problem with "Ready to Wear" is the
ensemble cast.  There are so many characters that
it is difficult to remember who is what, much
less identify with any of them.  Much of the
comedy also falls flat: a recurring gag is a man
stepping in dog-doo, something that one would
more expect from a Leslie Nielsen vehicle.</P>
<P>While "Ready to Wear" fails as a comedy, it is
not a complete waste of celluloid.  There is the
parade of naked supermodels at the film's end (in
this case, forgetting to rewind the video is doing
the next renter a favor).  There is a vaguely
amusing subplot involving Tim Robbins and Julia
Roberts as strangers 'forced' to share the same
hotel room (with predictable results: poor Lyle
Lovett, who has a bit part and looks lost).
Despite a lack of structure and an absence of
plot, the film is only occasionally truly boring.</P>
<P>Other subplots have Sally Kellerman, Linda Hunt
and Tracey Ullman playing fashion magazine
publishers, each of whom are desperately trying
to hire photographer Stephen Rea, who is more
interested in taking embarrasing photographs
of them.  Sophia Loren is romanced by Marcello
Mastroianni (the scene where she strips is a parody
of their corresponding scene in 1964's "Yesterday,
Today and Tomorrow") and has a husband who gets
murdered.  And the cast goes on and on: there's
four gay fashion designers who cheat on each other,
Kim Basinger is a witless reporter, Danny Aiello
is a cross dresser, Lauren Bacall and Teri Garr
show up for no discernable reason, lotsa others
whom I don't recognize, and a dozen or so
disinterested fashion models.</P>
<PRE>Skip this one and rent Altman's 1970 film M*A*S*H
instead.</PRE>
