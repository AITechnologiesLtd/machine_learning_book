<PRE>IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE
--------------------</PRE>
<P>In 1962 Hong Kong, Mr. Chow (Tony Leung Chiu-wai, "Happy Together") finds
out from Mrs. Suen (Rebecca Pan, "Flowers of Shanghai") that the room she
had for rent was just taken by Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk, "Irma Vep")
and directs him just down the hall, where another room is available.
Within these crowded quarters, Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan frequently cross each
others paths, alone.  When they gradually realize their spouses are engaged
in an affair, the two begin a friendship, vowing to be 'nothing like them'
in director Wong Kar-wai's Cannes Prix du Technique (editing, cinematography
and production design) winner "In the Mood for Love."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Wong Kar-wai, known for his hip, visually stylized,
modern films like "Chungking Express," steps back in time not only for his
story but for his presentation.</P>
<P>His Hong Kong of 1962 is a memory of a golden age where neighbors formed
mini-communities in close quarters, observing bourgeois proprieties.
The elegant beauty Mrs. Chan is married to a man usually away on business 
trips to Japan (he, like Mrs. Chow, is never really seen, just heard).  He
brings back foreign goods such as pocketbooks and rice cookers to the
delight of all, although the uniqueness of his gifts betrays his affair.
(In a beautiful foreshadowing scene, Mrs. Chan asks her husband to bring
back two pocketbooks for her boss, Mr. Ho (Lai Chin).  When her husband
inquires as to why he needs two, she wearily replies, 'you know,' referring
to the general ways of men rather than personal experience.)  Handsome Mr. 
Chow's wife is a modern woman working as a hotel receptionist who frequently 
calls her husband with stories of having to work late that eventually give way 
to visits to a sick mother.</P>
<P>The lonely two cross each others' paths on rain slicked streets fetching
dinners-for-one at a local noodle stall.  Their hesitant relationship
begins as they compare notes before confirming what they each already knew.
They practice what they will say to their spouses with each other, then
begin spending more time together collaberating on writing the martial arts 
serials they both love.  Soon neighbors begin to talk and the emotionally
restrained Li-zhen withdraws forcing Chow to declare his love and ask her
to leave with him for Singapore.</P>
<P>This heartbreaking tale of unrequited (or is it?) love is an elegant romance
for the ages and a masterpiece of its genre.  Kar-wai's cinematographers
Christopher Doyle ("Days of Being Wild," "Ashes of Time," "Fallen Angels")
and Mark Li Ping-bin ("Flowers of Shanghai") brilliantly set their camera 
as an interloper viewing his subjects on the sly, creeping along halls and 
from behind objects.  Slow motion is used several times to underline the 
melancholy aspects of the moment.  The cheating spouses are shown in shadow,
from behind, or via obstructed view.</P>
<P>Hyphenate William Chang Suk-ping, (production design, costume, editing)
who's worked on all of Kar-wai's films, is a maestro here, from his 
recreations of 1962 offices, apartments and restaurants to the stunning
dresses worn by Cheung (all of the same design, all boasting different
shades of personality in their fabric, always consumately elegant).</P>
<P>Western musical choices, such as Nat King Cole's Spanish version of 
'Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps' and other Latin music strongly aid in rushing
us back to another era while setting the stage for love.</P>
<P>Tony Leung, who won Best Actor at Cannes for this role, is an
honorable man of the time whose romantic nature is engaged by Mrs. Chan's
natural beauty, quiet nature and companionship.  Maggie Cheung evokes
the pathos of a splendid woman who, unjustly treated by her husband,
continues to cling to respectability even as her emotions are being
pulled to the surface for what may be the first and only time.  Never
has a more elegant creature (Cheung cites the costumes as a great aid
to her physical interpretation of the character) graced the screen.
The two have enormous chemistry without needing any histrionics to
convey their depth of feeling.</P>
<P>Wong Kar-wai has created a classic of the genre with "In the Mood for
Love" that can stand alongside David Lean's "Brief Encounter."  He's
capable of moving your emotions with a shot of a woman's embroidered slippers 
left abandoned on the floor.</P>
