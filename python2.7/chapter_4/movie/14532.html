<PRE>                                 BLADE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Wesley Snipes is a half-human, half-
          vampire fighting both of two sets of warring
          vampires in a great looking-film based on a Marvel
          comic book.  The story is weak and familiar without
          much logic behind it.  Rating:  6 (0 to 10), 1 (-4
          to +4)  A spoiler section following the main review
          lists some open questions and loose ends.
New York Critics: 2 positive, 8 negative, 3 mixed</PRE>
<P>     As Blade, the title character, observes just after the climactic
moment of the film, "Some motherfucker's always trying to ice skate
uphill."  That pretty much sums up the film.  It sounds sharp and
polished.  But do not think about it too long.  How many places can you
name where the ice is smooth enough to skate on and goes uphill?  BLADE
is polished, visually very appealing, and enjoyable as an action film.
But do not stop to think about it too hard.  BLADE is at once a good
action film and a bad piece of fantasy.</P>
<P>     This is a dark world in which vampires are something very
different from what used to be in the old Universal horror films.  The
world is basically engaged in a secret three-sided war.  There are
humans, there is the old aristocracy of vampires, and there are the
young rebellious vampires struggling to wrest control from the old
guard.  The older vampires are in a cold war with humans.  Some humans
know of their existence but try to cover it up in an uneasy truce.  The
young vampires know they can take control in a new order that will rule
humans and older vampires.  Tipping the balance in the wars is Blade
(Wesley Snipes), half human, half vampire.  Actually a vampire took his
mother just hours before he would have been born. This was sufficient
to change his DNA--I told you not to think about it too hard--so that
he has all the best parts of humans and all the best parts of vampires.
Actually, saying he has the best powers of both humans and vampires
does not explain him.  It is not clear if it is his human or his
vampire heritage that allow him to get a silver stake in the base of
his neck and seconds later again be a perfect fighting machine.  He
also seems to have the powers of an action hero.</P>
<P>     Visually this is a very striking and polished film.  While it
starts with some overly familiar time lapse effects, it has some well-
filmed fight sequences early on.  I am not an expert on martial arts,
but friends who know considerably more tell me that Snipes does his
stuff very well.  There was some suspicion that the fighting was
speeded up and there is no doubt that special effects were added to the
fight sequences.  But the fighting would not have looked this good
without Snipes knowing his stuff.  Digital effects are integrated
flawlessly with the live action.  Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost is an
acceptable villain without generating a lot of excitement.  Kris
Kristofferson plays the modern equivalent of Van Helsing.  He provides
the brains, Blade is the muscle.  As far as his acting he does not push
any new buttons or pull any new levers.  With the possible exception of
Snipes, nobody does.  I would say that it is nice to see Udo Kier still
making horror films, but it would not be sincere.  Kier has always had
non-demanding roles and has always been just adequate.  His presence in
a film has always seemed to be a kind of inside joke.</P>
<P>     In many ways this is a good action film.  The fights are exciting.
But the plot is a retread of ideas, several borrowed from Richard
Matheson's novel I AM LEGEND.  There are too many loose ends and open
questions for this to be a really good script.  I give it a 6 on the 0
to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>     Spoiler...Spoiler...Spoiler...</PRE>
<P>     Open questions, loose ends, and bad touches from BLADE:</P>
<P>     (Note that this film assumes that there are good scientific
reasons for vampires and they are preternatural not supernatural.  This
means that they have to obey laws of science and logic.)</P>
<P>     Do you have any idea what a horrible, wretched, stinking mess it
would create to pump fresh blood through a sprinkler system?  Where
would someone even get blood in those quantities?</P>
<P>     There is an implication that what gives Blade his powers derives
from his DNA.  Yet he was a vampire just shortly after his mother was
first bitten.  What mechanism could alter the DNA in his body cell-by-
cell in that short time?</P>
<P>     We are told that an autopsied vampire has "odd muscle structure
around the canines."  First of all, wouldn't any muscle structure
around the canines be odd?  If vampires can extend and retract fangs,
where do they go when retracted?  How does the human anatomy
accommodate them without any differences being obvious externally?  How
do newly bitten vampires undergo this extreme dental change?</P>
<P>     Many people learn about the existence of vampires in the course of
the film--the autopsy doctors mentioned above, for example.  In one
street chase we get a quick flash of a vampire who just happens to be
out biting a victim.  Anyone who happened to be on the street at that
time would see it happening.  Also, the victim would presumably
disappear.  With so many people learning of the existence of vampires
so frequently, how could the secret that they exist ever be kept under
wraps?</P>
<P>     Multiple times in the film people in streets wield guns and fire
them but no police come.</P>
<P>     Both Frost's minions and Blade seem awfully cavalier in fighting
around priceless vampire archives going back many thousands of years.
They contain information that both Frost and Blade need.  Wouldn't one
expect they would be handled with a little more care?</P>
<P>     Though we never see Blade have an opportunity to pick it up, he
seems to have gotten out of the archive with just the right scrap of
document.  How did he manage that?</P>
<P>     Blade's contact with his mother was very short.  How does Blade
recognize his mother when he sees her?</P>
<P>     How is it that a 10,000-year-old temple of vampires ended up in
the middle of an American metropolitan city?</P>
