<PRE>A Candid Interview.</PRE>
<P>Q: Why did you go to see FAIR GAME?
A: Because there was nothing else to review.
Q: Come now, you wanted to ogle supermodel Cindy Crawford in her screen 
   debut, right?
A: No.  Prurient ocular tendencies are disappointed in any case, since 
   there is a single, fleeting glimpse of Crawford's bust "au naturel." She 
   is, however,  in tight tops most of the time.  And I expected no display
   of acting in this kind of movie.  It is unfair to judge anyone who is
   mostly in fast-moving evasive actions.  Garbo couldn't have acted in that
   part, nor Lombard, Streep, Lange, or you-name-her.  Also, when it comes
   to looks, I think that the Mexican beauty Salma Hayek (DESPERADO) is the
   real winner.  To my taste anyway. 
Q: Okay, what's it all about?
A: Dade County, Florida lawyer Kate is the target of mysterious
   people--for reasons one cannot fathom.  There's an explanation near the
   end, but it's still a silly muddle.  What's at stake is over 800 million 
   dollars.  The Kate-hunters are ex-KGB men plus one woman deadlier than 
   Lotte Lenya in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. 
Q: Whom does Baldwin play?
A: Aw, c'mon.  Whom else than the 
   super-duper-heroic-fast-invincible-unscathable police detective Max who 
   meets cute with Kate in the interrogation room (not a bad scene) and 
   joins his fate to hers.  This is a one-theme movie, except for about 
   three diversions.  Rita (Hayek), Max's ex-girlfriend, makes a scene at 
   the police station, later unloads Max's junk on the street below.  Quite 
   funny.  At the station, too, a man in jail suit gets a gun and endangers 
   all --until Max tackles him.
Q: I've a feeling I saw this just days ago.  But where?
A: In COPYCAT, also a Warner Bros. release.  Call it a studio system.  
Q: Tell me more about the action.
A: It has all the things you expect, plus more.  Shootings, corpses, 
   unending bullets from Max's gun, chases, a helicopter, more chases, 
   attacks, counterattacks, derring-do...  Typical of 
   producer-Schlockmeister Joel Silver.
Q: You mean there's this horrible violence that's destroying our 
   country?
A: Are you kidding? No one can take any of this seriously.  The audience 
   kept laughing.  Imagine  Max jumping into a swimming pool, in slow-motion 
   no less, during which he gets off several shots from his handgun!  
   Imagine the good guys being chased by the killers who drive three black, 
   electronics-laden Jeep Wagoneers that feel like three Darth Vaders on 
   wheels. 
Q: Electronics you said?
A: Yes, the most important aspect of the whole movie is that the bad 
   ones are computer geniuses, and I mean geniuses.  Ah, that KGB training! 
   Their machines do things my computer couldn't even start thinking of, 
   and they do it with the speed of light.  No waiting for little screen 
   clocks to finish spinning their hands. 
Q: Do the electronic marvels  impress you?
A: Here and in other movies they remind me of the Greek mathematician 
   Archimedes (he of "Eureka!" fame), referring to the lever and exclaiming 
   "Give me where to stand , and I will move the earth."  Now we can say 
   "Give me such equipment and I can get my next-door neighbor elected 
   President of the United States." 
Q: Are these techno-miracles superior to others in films?
A: The villains and their gizmos beat all hollow the C.I.A machines that 
   progressively enlarge satellite photos in PATRIOT GAMES.  They hear and 
   see everything, with sophisticated heat-sensors too.  They get 
   information on people faster than in THE NET.  To trap Crawford and 
   Baldwin in a hotel that uses electronic room keys, by remote control the 
   KBGers cut off the current there, lock all the rooms.  But our heroes 
   somehow get out.  The sinister ones can also falsify documents and create 
   anything they please in a flash.  That's why, the moment an FBI man shows 
   up to help, you know he's a fake.
Q: Who are those former KGBers?
A: Only Allah in his wisdom knows.  Kazak (the arch-monster) is played by 
   Steven Berkoff.  Most of the time his accent is American.  Then he tries 
   what someone with a dead hearing-aid battery must have told him is a 
   Russian accent.  Toward the end he lamely attempts a British accent.  
Q: Any other goofs?
A: Lots.  Aside from the plot not making sense, there are constantly 
   impossible heroics and acrobatics.  Max puts his car in cruise control 
   and jumps onto a moving train; as the car crashes, Max lands in the 
   wagon without a scratch.  A screenful of bank names includes "Union de 
   Bancs Suisses" instead of "Banques," which makes it the "Swiss Union of 
   Benches."  There's more. 
Q: What's the most spectacular side of the movie?
A: Its explosions of everything.  They invariably become huge fireballs 
   which, added together, would rival the fiery napalm ending of 
   APOCALYPSE NOW.  Our lovely couple is of course always a step ahead of 
   the blasts.
Q: Do Baldwin and Crawford make love?
A: Please! Don't you take it for granted? Don't you know that on TV and 
   in movies cops are always handsome, bright and able, and that both male 
   and female leads are unattached? 
Q: Any more funny bits?
A: The whole movie is so outrageous that it can be funny up to the time  
   viewer fatigue sets in.  There's an amusing scene of Kate (who catches on 
   fast) going  to a computer store and vamping a young nerd into letting 
   her use his machine.  That's where the sexual allusions come in.  When 
   the young man's glasses steam up and he says things like "I was playing 
   with my joystick" or "hardware," Kate's ironical-sexy expression, 
   facial and spoken, is perfect.  Crawford may deserve a comic role.  
Q: You normally rate movies severely, like recent ones that were more 
   ambitious than FAIR GAME.  How come you give  it two stars?
A: Because it is unambitious and unpretentious.  It is honest in its 
   dumb, cartoonish, boom-boom lack of depth.  When the video comes out, if 
   you watch it from your bed, the film is so undemanding that it can be 
   restful. </P>
