<P>Susan Granger's review of "TEA WITH MUSSOLINI" (G2, an MGM Company release)</P>
<P>Based on Franco Zeffirelli's own childhood in Florence, this
comedy-drama tells the story of the five extraordinary women who care
for Luca, a boy born out of wedlock, while resisting the madness of
war that sweeps across Europe during the '30s and '40s. Known as the
Scorpioni, for their biting wit, these feisty British and American
expatriate females adore Italy and refuse to leave. Instead, they
arrogantly defy the mercurial officials, trusting in the autocratic
widow of the British Ambassador to Italy, Maggie Smith, who once had
tea with the Fascist leader who assured her that no harm would ever
come to her and her friends. As Luca's father's secretary/translator,
Joan Plowright is entrusted with the boy's care as a surrogate
mother. She works hard to make him "a proper English gentleman,"
teaching him about Shakespeare, while Judi Dench gives him an
appreciation of drawing and art. The Americans are an openly lesbian
archeologist, Lily Tomlin, and a wealthy, free-spirited art collector,
Cher, who was a friend of Luca's late mother. As England and America
enter W.W.II, the women become "enemy aliens" in their adopted
homeland. Scripted by John Mortimer, their story is colorfully
dramatized in lush settings and exquisitely photographed by
cinematographer David Watkin (Oscar winner for "Out of Africa"). The
only discordant note is Zeffirelli's overly sentimental depiction of
the Italian and German soldiers. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "Tea With Mussolini" is an irresistibly joyous, opulent 9,
featuring insightful performances from some of the greatest actresses
on the screen today. The film is a delightful treasure.</P>
