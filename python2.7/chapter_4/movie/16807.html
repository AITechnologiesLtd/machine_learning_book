<PRE>`Affliction' – Fear and Loathing in a Northern Town
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>As any sociologist will attest, your childhood and the types of
parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an
adult.  Parents that are supportive and environments that are
nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms
that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives.  But if your
upbringing is marred with violence, hate and dysfunctionality, then
your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with
psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome.  `Affliction'
explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly
nightmarish childhood.</P>
<P>The man in question is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte).  Here is a man
who is like any other citizen on the surface.  He is a productive
member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you
and me.  But as you scratch beneath the surface, something scary and
evil begins to rear its ugly head.  We see that he is a mean-tempered
person.  He has a hard time taking control of his emotions, which
usually gets the better of him.  He is quick to apologize for his
actions and wants to be a gentle person, but something is sparking a
tendency towards violence.  He also has tremendous problems with
relationships.  He is divorced and his only connection to love is his
daughter.  But his bearish persona and stature alienates her.  He is
visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves
him.  His demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl
(Sissy Spacek) at risk.  She tries to remain true to him and
supportive, but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this
kind of person, relationships will ultimately end like sentences
ending with an exclamation point.  Finally, he is spiteful and
vindictive.  As a rejected father, he initiates a custody battle that
seems hopeless.  As the town's only police officer, he issues a
speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died.  We can see that
this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain.  He is a
prisoner and a slave to it.  He is moving towards a level of madness
and insanity that defies comprehension.   What kind of force can move
a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who
genuinely care for him?</P>
<P>We learn that the answer is his father (James Coburn).  This is the
kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any
woman would be afraid to meet.  He is an overbearingly misogynistic
and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist.  We see his tyrannical
behavior through flashbacks.  To heighten the father's churlishness,
the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very
frightened person.  Very effective.  Today, Wade's dad is quite
elderly, but still manages to instill fear into a grown man.  The
influence that the father possesses is inescapable, and its unsavory
effect clamps down hard on the tortured Wade.  The result is every
son's nightmare – becoming like the father that one has always dreaded
to be. </P>
<P>This is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama, and
Nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to
become a detriment as well as a necessity.  He's a hulking person who
is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father. 
Coburn displays heft as the bitter dad.  But, it's most certainly not
Saturday-night-friendly fare.  There's nothing light or fluffy about
this film.  That may turn many moviegoers away.  But it's certainly
worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing Nolte's and
Coburn's raw acting talents. </P>
