<P>The so-talented Rebecca Pidgeon is in real life Mrs. David Mamet. I 
saw her last in her husband's excellent remale of "The Winslow Boy." 
Here she plays Ann, a smalltown bookseller, the leader of the 
dramatic society, and the fiancee of obnoxious lawyer and local 
politico Doug MacKenzie (Clark Gregg). There's no true love between 
the two, but then really small towns have really small opportunities. 
Soon that man will be evinced by a quiet, lovely affair between Ann 
and visiting scriptwriter Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour 
Hoffman.) The new relationship--like most of the other aspects of the 
movie--is a gem of originality, as is Ann's charming wisdom. Quietly, 
without pretentiousness or sententiousness, she speaks pearls. One of 
them goes: "You make your own fun. Otherwise, it's entertainment."</P>
<P>Triple threat playwright, screenwriter and director David Mamet must 
be having the time of his life by making his own fun here by 
satirizing out and out the making and makers of movies. Director Walt 
Price (William Macy) has been looking for locations to shoot the 
late-19th century opus "The Old Mill." He had found the ideal place 
and mill in New Hampshire, but circumstances obliged the movie crew 
to run away. The replacement is Waterford, Vermont, a spot as 
colorful in sights and denizens as any invented by Hollywood. (Even 
the rain looks like movie-rain.)</P>
<P>Walt is everything you didn't want to know about a name director and 
about films -- if you want to keep your illusions about the 
practitioners of the Seventh Art.  Both in turns and simultaneously 
he is imperious, rude, demanding, cajoling, foul-mouthed, clever, 
imaginative, impossible, inventive, Napoleonic and Machiavellian. His 
declining star Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) has a pronounced taste 
for young, school-age girls --which inevitably leads to troubles. 
First-time screenwriter Joe White is sweet, insecure and lost without 
his manual typewriter which disappeared between New Hampshire and 
Vermont. He finds in smart, tolerant Ann a rod, a staff, a muse and 
an object of his affections.</P>
<P>Claire, the projected film's female lead, has mega-problems, to which 
she adds a refusal to bare her breasts on-camera. This has something 
to do with her "purity," though an additional $800.000 would change 
her mind. The casting of Sarah Jessica Parker is inspired given her 
roles in TV's "Sex in the City."</P>
<P>Marty Rossen, the shyster lawyer who is the film's producer, is never 
short of arguments and ploys. He's the kind of beast who would do 
anything to get what he wants -- in fact he is like the classic 
definition of "chutzpah" where a man who killed his father and mother 
throws himself at the mercy of the Court "because I'm an orphan."</P>
<P>Add  mid-teenager Carla (Julia Stiles, who must have been 18 when the 
movie was shot).  She helps her dad with food services at the hotel 
where everybody is staying. In a clever twist, she seduces seducer 
Bob --and everything concerning the making of "The Old Mill"'s comes 
to a halt, while other developments stress venality, including lawyer 
MacKenzie's. By sheer coincidence some echoes of the year 2000's 
stolen Presidential election add some serious weight to the politics 
of the situation.</P>
<P>(By the way, the Old Mill of Waterford turns out to having been 
torched in 1960 by, probably, a destructive schoolboy.)</P>
<P>The film may be a series of catastrophes but they are all presented 
so juicily, amusingly, hilariously, winningly and wittily that they 
five the movie its several "raisons d'etre."  Details are splendidly 
sketched out. Characters and  situations are all different from one 
another while movie cliches are given freshness and originality.  .</P>
<P>The cast and team of both "State and Main" and "The Old Mill" are 
rather small but do wonders thanks to Mamet's quick, sharp (or 
obtuse-on-purpose) dialogue. He handles language like a 
prestidigitator, directs with ease. Many of the stars have been in 
Mamet films:  Macy, Paymer, Pidgeon, LuPone.</P>
<P>Non sequiturs or absurd logic enrich the text. Inventiveness reigns: 
at the hotel, the traffic in people, rooms, doors opening or closing 
is coordinated like a Georges Feydeau farce. In the hotel's cafe, two 
regular, chorus-like old-timers read Variety and talk technically of 
inflated movie profits. The whole production feels like a renaissance 
of older, classic screwball comedies --but not of slapstick pics.</P>
<P>Macy and Paymer repeat the old joke about naming people Associate 
Producer instead of paying them, yet the gag is always fresh. Paymer 
wants to ammortize expenses by bringing in product placement in the 
film, computer advertising ... in 1895, that is. Sure enough, by the 
end, some of the "inner" movie's shots shows an ad for a livery 
stable, and beneath it, one for Bazoomer computers.</P>
<P>Of course, we never find out what "The Old Mill" is about.</P>
<P>Do not stand up and leave the theater while end-credits are rolling. 
The humor continues until the lights go up.</P>
