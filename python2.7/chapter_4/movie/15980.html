<PRE>A Bug's Life
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4) There are several reasons that, of the two bug movies
this year, I was rooting for ANTZ. Casting Woody Allen in a cartoon was
a stroke of genius, and it showed that the cartoon would not pander to
kids at the expense of entertainment for adults. Also, ANTZ was put out
by DreamWorks, which is not associated with Disney. It's nice to see
someone give The Mouse a run for His money.</P>
<P>But as much as I liked ANTZ, I have to admit that A BUG'S LIFE is
better. It is not just clever, it is imaginative. There are some
genuinely inventive scenes that only an ant could have dreamt up. The
people at Pixar must have worked hard at having so much fun.</P>
<P>The film introduces us to a certain colony where the grasshoppers are
running a protection racket. If the ants fail to feed them, the
grasshoppers will do violence. So the ants gather twice the food they
need, half going to the grasshoppers.</P>
<P>One ant, Flik (Dave Foley), spends his time inventing instead of
gathering. While showing his picking machine to little Dot, the
invention goes haywire and spills the piled grasshopper food into the
pond. When the hoppers show up, they are steaming mad and they increase
their demands and their threats.</P>
<P>The royal court has seen Flik mess things up before, so when he proposes
to leave the colony in search of aid, they gladly accept. Any plan that
involves him leaving is okay with them.</P>
<P>Flik makes it to the strange and cruel city peopled by hustlers and
beggars (including one vet who had his wings pulled off by some kid –
and people say BABE 2 was dark!). In a seamy tin can Flik encounters a
mismatched group of bugs who appear to be just the toughs he was looking
for. He asks for their help and they agree.</P>
<P>The mercenaries are actually a Fellini-esque troupe of starving
performers, but Flik thinks they are fighters. The actors think Flik is
going to pay them to perform, not fight grasshoppers. Eventually things
get straightened out, but by then, there is no time. The colony will
have to make do with what it has.</P>
<P>Necessity is the mother of invention. Screenwriters John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton saw the necessity from the ants' point of view, and not
from their own. The problem was how to beat the grasshoppers, not how to
finish the script. I was amazed that the bugs' invention was nothing I
had seen before. The solution to their problem (forgive me for not
giving it away) was truly original, and not recycled from dozens of
other children's screenplays. </P>
<P>Other refreshing examples of the screenwriters' (and the bugs')
innovation made me chuckle at the creative energy that went into making
this film. There was a flute-like instrument, played by several bugs at
once, and a second-grade art project - a mural depicting the grisly
victory of the ants. There was even a second-grade skit about the ants
versus the hoppers. Each of these bumps in the story was a reminder of
how important, and how rare, good writing is.</P>
<P>And speaking of writing, I should add that the characters in A BUG'S
LIFE are much better developed than I had feared. When the previews
showed an food-obsessed German caterpillar and a macho man ladybug, the
one-dimensional warning lights went off. But in fact, these characters
were given a little room to spread. Yes, the bugs are caricatures, but
they are introduced and developed individually.</P>
<P>In addition to the writing, the look of the film is truly outstanding. I
was at first disappointed, after having seen ANTZ, that the creatures in
A BUG'S LIFE appear to be made of plastic or clay, instead of something
more subtle or naturalistic. But on closer inspection, you can see that
older ants have wrinkles and pockmarks in their smooth clay surfaces.
You can also see some uncanny depth in the irises of the bugs' eyes. So
even though the look is more cartoony than in Antz, it wasn't any
simpler or cheaper. </P>
<P>And when the "camera" moves, the swirling, changing perspective moves
with it. There seems to be some trick involved, but I can't put my
finger on it. Perhaps it's the photographic equivalent of a lens made at
tiny proportions. In any case, the handful of dizzying shots where the
camera moves are great.</P>
<P>There are lots of tangential comments I could make (see sidebar at
<A HREF="http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/bug_ad99.htm">http://net.indra.com/~mmapes/bug_ad99.htm</A>), but instead I'll leave you
with just this one. In this age of selling out and bottom lines, and
after the eyeball-rolling gratuitous picnic scene in ANTZ, A BUG'S LIFE
contained no product placement.</P>
<P>Enjoy! And don't miss the "outtakes" during the credits.</P>
