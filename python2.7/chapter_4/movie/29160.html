<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Charlie Chan (Oland) is asked by an old friend, Mrs. Henrietta Lowell (Crosman),
to solve the disappearance and then the murder of an heir. Allen Colby is the
true heir of an estate, but was lost track of when he joined the French Foreign
Legion and became a war prisoner. Allen doesn't believe in psychics like his
father does and the two quarreled about this, which caused the rift between
them. Upon his father's death he returns by ship to claim his inheritance, but
his vessel sinks near Honolulu and he's presumed dead. A diver retrieves his
briefcase, and Charlie discovers notes that say attempts were made on his life.
If Allen returns to claim the will, everyone else will in it get cut off. </P>
<P>Somehow Allen is alive, and is seen climbing over the wall of the Colby House
when the unfriendly caretaker Ulrich (Egon) doesn't answer the door. Once
inside, he is killed when a knife is thrown into his back while he's correcting
the hands of a fast clock. </P>
<P>When Charlie arrives at Mrs. Lowell's house in San Francisco he thinks Allen
might be alive, but is in danger. He attends a seance arranged by Mrs. Lowell--a
believer in psychics. While using her Ouija board with her butler Baxter
(Mundin), she senses that Allen is dead. The seance will be attended by all
those who are in the will and will take place in the Colby House where a
Professor Bowen (Carewe), who is Mrs. Lowell's spiritual adviser, and Carlotta
(Roy), who is a medium, will try to reach the spirit of Allen Colby. </P>
<P>In the seance, the medium Carlotta says she feels the presence of Allen Colby
and suddenly his face appears and his dead body falls inside their room. </P>
<P>The other guests present are all suspects: Alice Lowell (Lawrence) is Mrs
Lowell's sweet but not wealthy daughter. She's there with her charming reporter
boyfriend Dick Williams (Quigley). Mrs Lowell's other daughter, who seems
bitter, Janice Gage (Allwyn), is there with her husband Fred Gage (Trevor). He
handles Mrs. Lowell's business affairs. Mr. Phelps (Hale) is the executor of the
estate, and he will be discharged of that duty if Allen is alive. He has also
recently sustained heavy losses in the stock market. Ulrich, the other suspect,
resents Allen because his daughter was engaged to him, and when he ditched her
she committed suicide. He blames Allen for his daughter's death. </P>
<P>Charlie stays overnight with the spooked Baxter in the Colby House, as he
cunningly searches for clues. He soon finds that Bowan is a phony, using x-ray
machines and other devices to fool the clients. There's also an attempt on Mrs.
Lowell's life, as Charlie now gets the police to protect her. </P>
<P>Charlie sets a trap and calls on Inspector Morton (Miller) for assistance, as he
suspects Mrs. Lowell is in further danger. He uses a dummy of her, which the
killer shoots at with a high-powered rifle from a nearby bell tower. With the
killer thinking he got rid of her, Charlie then gathers all the suspects into
Colby House for another seance. Here, he cleverly gets the killer to reveal
himself as he uses the psychic's phony methods to reproduce Mrs. Lowell's face
on a mirror. When the killer tries to throw a knife at that figure in the
darkened room, he is trapped because the knife had graphite on it and it rubs
off on his hands. </P>
<P>This Charlie Chan episode lacked humor, as there was no Number One Son present.
But despite being a bit dry, it applied the usual formula methods and proved to
be entertaining. It was also difficult to guess who the killer was. </P>
