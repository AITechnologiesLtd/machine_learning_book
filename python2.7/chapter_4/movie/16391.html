<PRE>Kiss or Kill (1997, R)</PRE>
<P>Rated R for violence, profanity, and sexuality</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Bill Bennett (Two if by Sea)</P>
<P>Starring Frances O'Conner (Love and other Catastrophes) and Matt Day (Love
and other Catastrophes)</P>
<P> I could write this review with my eyes closed.  If it weren't for all the
typos you would see, that'd actually be a good idea.  What I can tell you is
that, for each of the four times I have seen this film, it has gotten better
and better.</P>
<P> At first, I rented it on the basis of wonderful PR: a provocative back and
front cover of the video.  The second and third time, I rented it because I
had previously enjoyed it.  This final time, I taped it off of HBO at 1:10
in the morning...  I wanted it that much.</P>
<P> Kiss or Kill, winner of the Australian Best Picture, Director, Actor, and
Actress awards in 1997, in the story of Niki and Al, a pair of thieves
marking married men, having Niki seduce them and drug them, and then robbing
them as a pair.  Niki is the victim of a childhood memory of her mother
being burnt to death in front of her eyes when she was six.  Al is the
disowned son of a Gold Coast millionaire.  Both lives equally tragic, they
survive with each other.</P>
<P> When one of their marks dies of an overdoes, they set themselves to run for
Perth, but not before finding a suitcase with a pornographic video in it.
This video implicates Zipper Doyle in a child porn ring, and, somehow, has a
link into Niki's past.  Running for Perth, whoever they meet starts dying,
and they are left with only one option: distrust each other.</P>
<P> As B-grade of a road movie as this may sound, it is the creme de la creme.
Kiss or Kill's characters are fully developed, it's script tainted with a
dark humor and gifted with a sublime mystery, and it's directing a steel
machine.  Kudos go out to Henry Dagnar, the editor, who does the most
innovative technique in years: cutting up each continuous shot to give the
viewer a "hurried" feeling.</P>
<P> Niki and Al, on the run from the police, are set into a philosophical
examination of lies and truth.  As they are forced to mistrust each other,
they are forced to re-evaluate their love for one another and what they
thought they knew.  Rather than stage this examination in a quiet suburban
town, as the independent masterpiece Sex, Lies, and Videotape did, Kiss or
Kill uses the mystery of the murders that surround them to propel the story
along.  Everyone is on the run.</P>
<P> Frances O'Conner and Matt Day, previously seen as friends in Love and Other
Catastrophes, are excellent as the couple on the run.  Should the movie have
been done in America, it very well would have won them an Academy Award.
Frances O'Conner projects exactly what she should: an aura of mystery and
self-distrust, not to mention a distrust of others, accompanied with a naive
intelligence.  She seems innocent, but is not.  Matt Day shows himself as an
angry victim of a father that ignored him.  Not as intelligent as Niki, but
good at masking it, Matt Day is the more practical of the two.</P>
<P> Also of note are the two policemen on their train, whose names escape me
but who deliver perhaps the best scene of lies in recent times.  This comes
in the form of a breakfast talk about why one of them won't eat bacon, and
seems utterly serious until the end.</P>
<P> Told in a detached manner, Bill Bennett was and should be recognized for
his brilliance.  He uses almost no lighting throughout the film, yet
persists in using scenes in darkened rooms in order to heighten the shadows
and thus the suspense.  Leaving no music in the film whatsoever, he allows
us to view this as if it were really happening, instead of as it was just
another movie.</P>
<P> Kiss or Kill was a technical and colorful masterpiece, and deserves every
bit of praise I or anyone else could give it.  Enjoy, people, enjoy.</P>
