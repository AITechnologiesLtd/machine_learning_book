<P>SMOKE SIGNALS (director: Chris Eyrie; cast: Adam Beach (Victor Joseph),
Evan Adams (Thomas Builds-the-Fire), Irene Bedard (Suzy Song), Gary
Farmer (Arnold Joseph), Tantoo Cardinal (Arlene Joseph), 1998)</P>
<P>SMOKE SIGNALS won the 1998 Sundance Festival film of the year. It is a
story of fatherly abuse, and a reluctant friendship between children
united by tragic circumstances. It is told in flashback, mostly from the
point of view of Victor (Adam), who feels that he is the wronged son of
a father who deserted the family. He has an unpleasant disposition,
which the filmmaker seems to indicate, is because of the failed
father-son relationship. All the main characters are Coeur d' Alene's of
Idaho. They offer a look into what the current indigenous people are
thinking and saying to each other, and how life is on the reservation.
There are many odd characters that add to our awareness of the Native
American experiences on the reservation, who are both amusing and
talkative.</P>
<P>But life on the reservation seems stale and confining; yet, everyone, at
least, has some material comforts, as they all seem to live in a house
and enjoy their fried bread.</P>
<P>The plot takes on its central theme of transformation when Victor learns
that his father died in Arizona, and he goes there with his most ardent
admirer, Thomas (Evan), who volunteers to pay the expenses just so he
can be with Victor, to retrieve the body. Thomas is the gentle
storyteller trying to grasp his Indian roots after being raised by his
kindly grandmother; while, Victor is the handsome, athletic but asocial,
abused child, who has never come to terms with his father's drinking or
rejection of him and his mother.</P>
<P>Victor's father, Arnold (Gary), rescued Thomas from the house Thomas's
parents died in, in a July 4th fire.Victor subsequently learns the fire
was caused accidently by his drunken father. Arnold could not reconcile
this, so he continued to drink and abuse his family, and finally took
off for Arizona, where he lived with Suzy Song (Irene), this wonderfully
gracious soul.</P>
<P>Forgiveness for his father and renewed friendship with Thomas takes
place when they bring his father's ashes back home.The film takes on the
look of a road film.</P>
<P>This is a film written, directed, and acted by Native Americans. It does
not suffer from the usual clich=E9s of Indian films, as it artfully weaves
a story wavering between despair and comic acceptance of the Native
American plight. It is only through the optimistic ending, that the
forgiveness of the son for his father and his altered relationship with
Thomas, from scorn to healthy respect, can the film reassure us that
this story has served as a metaphor for the hopes of the Native American
people, as they try to handle the injustices of their situation in a
peaceful  manner.</P>
<P>I recommend this film for its verve and very real passion it has for
Native Americans, despite the triteness of its story and the fact that
it offered no new insights into child abuse, resolving the father-son
relationship only posthumously. I mainly point this out, since one of
the major underlying themes of the film, was just that problem.</P>
