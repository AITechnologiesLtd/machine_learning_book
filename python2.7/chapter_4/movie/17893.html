<P>I recall this article in the NYT Magazine.  It was about the lack of
villains Hollywood can rely on.  After World War Two, they could show
Nazis in film: instant bad guy, especially with those spiffy Gestapo
uniforms.  Similarly, we had American Indians in Westerns, another
group that can be readily identified by appearance or accent.  Now,
with the advent of political sensibilities, and with the long distances
we are from World War Two, it's a bit hard to come up with readily
identifiable villains.  The article noted that Arabs have been used a
few times, then South American drug dealers, and before the bubble
economy burst, the Japanese.  We no longer have a consistently reliable
national villain, but must make do with a changing cast of ethnic or
professional types.  The Chinese may be next year's flavor, given the
random political tensions, as well as Hollywood's antipathy towards the
PRC.  I imagine a day when we can safely and seriously show the Cold
War science fiction film, Battle Beneath the Earth, in which the Red
Chinese dig tunnels under America, and start sprinkling atom bombs
under the US Heartland.  Surely a metaphor of insidious Communists.
But for now, it's only really fit for Mystery Science Theatre.</P>
<P>Among the flavors of recent years is the Russian Mob.  In this updated
version of "Day of the Jackal", the assassin's paymaster is a mobster
out to revenge his brother's death at the hands of the Russian Militia
and the American FBI.  But the principal villain, Bruce Willis, is
known more for his technocratic efficiency at assassinations, not for
ideological fervor.  He's a contract killer, belonging to no cause
beyond his own enrichment, a member of no ethnic identity save perhaps
a bland Western cosmopolitanism.  In contrast, the hero, Richard Gere,
is described as a fiery nationalist, a former IRA sharpshooter.  He
doesn't rely on technology to do the job -- he in fact gives up a laser
sniper scope at one point and relies on old-fashioned optics -- but is
carried through by passion and conviction.  Despite the current vogue
in creating folk heroes out of the IRA, I find it interesting that a
positive symbol of nationalist fervor is placed in contrast to the cold
blooded and rootless professional.  Technocrats aren't in favor.</P>
<P>In any case, I saw "The Jackal" this morning.  The original film
featured an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle.  But times hav
changed: the music has been updated to a Nine Inch Nails-influenced
soundtrack, and the target of the assassination is an American.
Arguably, people here in the US wouldn't care all too much if a
Frenchman is blown to bits.  I haven't seen the original movie, but I
suspect this new film features more spiffy electronics than the
original, simultaneously violating the Iron Law of Bandwidth (think
full motion video on a cell modem) and fulfilling our expectations that
computers shown by Hollywood will be miraculous beasts.</P>
<P>Oh, in reaction to a complentary lack of good sense about Heavily Armed
Bad Guys that we saw in, say, "Starship Troopers" (i.e., the bugs have
claws, but we'll just run right into them), let me note that when you
have a gun the size of a sofa pointed at you, the sensible thing is to
get really close to it, perhaps ducking under it or walking to one
side, as it can't hit you then.  One of the characters failed to follow
this somewhat obvious idea.</P>
<P>Another thing the Jackal does is the "you're about to die, so I'll tell
you the plan."  It's not as direct or obvious as a James Bond
supervillain, but it's there.  Along with a Monster that Wouldn't Die
moment.  As well as extraneous killing -- especially considering that
he's a professional assassin who shouldn't leave too much of a track --
just to show what kind of bad ass he is.  But I don't think I'll spoil
anything mentioning this.</P>
<P>But it's not a horrible movie.  It's reasonably good, though meant more
for video tape than $8 in a theatre.  See it at matinee.</P>
<P>Oh, Richard Gere's barogue is really strong at first, but then becomes
barely noticeable.  This is odd, since the film was most likely shot
out of order.</P>
