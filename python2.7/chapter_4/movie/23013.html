<PRE>Lord of the Highs
The Beach</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A somewhat snide Leonardo prefaces this "Lord of the Flies" type adventure,
"My name is Richard, so what else do you need to know?" As a matter of fact,
I would have liked to know that Richard wades on the selfish and untrue side
of ordinary. Which could have quickly been established in a brief opening
scene.</P>
<P>But "The Beach" does take care to establish the size of Richard's gonads.
His beach balls are easily dared. Arriving into a bustling exotic Bangkok,
locals promptly challenge Richard into drinking snake blood. Then Robert
Carlyle, delivering a fantastically psycho performance as a former resident
of the famed beach, more than sparks Richard's interest in the splendidly
secret cove three islands off the coast, "I'm not just talking ... 'oh,
that's nice, man' ... this place if f'ing perfect."</P>
<P>In need of some companionship (especially female) Richard recruits a French
couple to journey with him. By the end of the first act, the three, standing
on the second island and staring at the forbidden goal, dare themselves to
swim the void.</P>
<P>Up to here, the film rather closely traces a common tourist route. In fact,
ten years ago, I flew into Bangkok, crashed at a cheap hostel, got the
island paradise speech from a glassy-eyed traveler, hopped the train and
boarded the boat out to the same second island where I met up with an
Israeli couple. So in a strange way, the film may be roughly nostalgic for
those who've made the trip - up to this point anyway. At the time, Koh
Pangon was beauty enough, we didn't need to swim the 2K.</P>
<P>Once the trio reaches the forbidden island, "The Beach" dips into a short
sequence of which the "Blaire Witch Project" would have been envious. An
obsessed leader dragging two innocents into the thicket ... but with a much
larger budget, and experienced cinematographers.</P>
<P>Soon enough they find the cove haven to end all cove havens and a community
of pot-smoking hippies to go with it. "I've got a new vocation: The pursuit
of pleasure." The music plays backward during this scene to greater
intensify the dizzying beauty. Nicely done.</P>
<P>Leonardo plays the role well, especially in his reactions. Early on he
blurts to the violent psycho traveler, "No offense, but you're f'ed in the
head." As we await the consequences, Leonardo's facial expressions fill the
screen with anticipation, daring and a shady sort of naiveté.</P>
<P>But, in a move we'd not been warmed up to, Richard leaves a copy of the map
back on the second island. It is this copy that tempts the major conflict
for the rest of the film. A tempt that any self-respecting major conflict
would have ignored. But not this one.</P>
<P>Dabbling in surrealism, the film drifts into the dark and deathly, when
Richard himself comes to idolize the memory of the aforementioned crazed
traveler. Here, the twisted plot becomes savagely captivating. Unfortunately
soon after, all this set-up falls like a house made of cards; as the
filmmakers opt for a showdown style climax while abandoning what should have
been a personal, man vs. selfishness, culmination. The saga dumps to its
end, manufacturing the lacerated remains of a theme.</P>
<P>Well paced, acted and filmed, always interesting, with only a few sticky
moments; "The Beach" is a small scale, less potent, more commercial "Fight
Club." Both films follow a fringe character, start well, continue well, but
fail to find an ending that works.</P>
<P>A brief note: Though Richard's map shows the island paradise Northwest of
Koh Pangnon; the actual island filmed, Phi Phi Le, is miles away (off of
Phuket Island). Additionally, the producers reshaped the sand dunes somewhat
and filled out the coast with 100 coconut trees that weren't there prior.</P>
