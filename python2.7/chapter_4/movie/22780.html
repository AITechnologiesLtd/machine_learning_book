<P> Down to You was a case of adding insult to injury.</P>
<P> The injury was having to see this film at all.  I would rather suffer
whiplash in a VW bug than sit through this film again.  The insult was
that all through this film, I had to listen to three annoying teens who
threw popcorn (which often landed on me).</P>
<P> Down to You is a very cheap romantic comedy about Al (Freddie Prinze
Jr.), a love struck college student, and the object of his affection,
Imogen (Julia Stiles).  Despite two people who have brought at least
bearable teen movies in the past (Prinze with She's All That and Stiles
with 10 Things I Hate About You), these two never end up having either
the chemistry or the humor to keep the majority of audiences engaged for
90 minutes.  In fact, they have all of the chemistry of a couple
eternally plagued with a lack of spark.  For instance, they don't greet
each other with the standard cinema kiss we have come to expect: it's a
hug.  Also, despite the fact that they are both in college and that one
of them does show some talent for promiscuity, they take three months of
dating before they first have sex.  In the words of its target audience:
as if.</P>
<P> Along the way on our ride down Melodrama Lane (better known as the
film), we have a bizarre cast of supporting characters that might
actually be funny if writer-director Kris Issacson (a man who picked up
humor talents by being the assistant to Barbara Streisand in The Mirror
Has Two Faces) had tried.  We have the porn-star philosopher, Monk (Zak
Orth), the other porn starlet who only wants someone to make her
pancakes (Selma Blair), and the psychedelic drug dealer by the name of
Jim Morrison (Ashton Kutcher).  Each of these could have had great jokes
thrown in, but they never are given the chance.</P>
<P> The thing that kills the movie the most is actually not its blandness
but its desperate attempts to separate itself from the average teen
movie.  Told in separate voice-overs by Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia
Stiles, Down to You has the same Nora Ephron feel as you would find in
Sleepless in Seattle.  The entire film feels like it is trying to be
both incredibly 90s and hip and incredibly old-fashioned.  This
combination ends up being the final blow to a very bad movie.</P>
<P> Outside the theater, I asked some teens about the film.  As expected,
they seemed to think that it was sweet and seemed to get an
extra-special kick out of Jim Morrison.  It looks like I have more
insult added to injury, coming soon to a theatre near you.</P>
<PRE>1.5 stars</PRE>
