<PRE>THE CONTENDER
-------------</PRE>
<P>Former film critic Rod Lurie breaks the 'those who can't, teach' maxim by
writing and directing "The Contender," a pungent political drama with roots
in Otto Preminger's 1962 film "Advise and Consent."</P>
<P>The President (Jeff Bridges, wonderfully funny AND presidential) needs to
elect a new VP and chooses Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen, "Pleasantville") 
because he wants to get a woman in high office as part of his Democratic legacy.
In doing so, he's overlooking the popular Governor Jack Hathaway (William 
Petersen, "To Live and Die in LA"), who's just become a media darling for 
trying to save a woman from drowning.  Unfortunately, the chairman of the 
house committee that must pass the veep's nomination is Congressman Shelly 
Runyon (an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman) who's both a political foe of
President Jackson Evans and one of Hathaway's best friends.  He uncovers
a sex scandal (a drunken gang bang) from Laine's college days and leaks it.  
Laine refuses to acknowledge the story by either confirmation or denial,
stating that it's no one's business.  The frustrated President continues
to back her, although it's clear Runyon is winning the battle and Hathaway
hovers in the wings.</P>
<P>This complex drama showcases the political process with all it's gameplay
centered with the issue of the right to privacy vs. the right to know.
There are thriller elements mostly represented by the character of FBI Agent
Wilhemina (Kathryn Morris) whose personal agenda is unclear while she
investigates Senator Hanson.  </P>
<P>Lurie's screenplay keeps us off base, never sure of characters' true 
motivations.  He makes clever associations with character development as 
well.  We're introduced to Laine as she's enjoying a passionate interlude 
atop her office desk with her husband, campaign manager William (Robin Thomas), 
so sex is implanted in our minds with the main character at the onset.  The 
President and his opponent are both food obsessed, with the President 
humorously trying to stump the White House chef (requests for shark steak 
sandwiches and hazelnut pudding are an amusing sideline, if done once too 
often) while Runyon is shown devouring rare steaks.  Senator Hathaway's
attemptto save a woman whose car plummets from a bridge into a river is
the anti-Chappaquiddick.  Laine's remark that President Clinton was 
'responsible but not guilty,' is later echoed in reverse by her mentor.
Lurie's screenplay is solid all the way, except for a major plot twist that's 
too perfunctorily coincidental to hold water.</P>
<P>The cast is fabulous.  Joan Allen has a firm grip on her first lead role
(Lurie wrote the screenplay for her).  She's clear eyed and strong through
overwhelming adversity, always sticking to her principles whatever the
country believes of her morals.  I'm sure she'll be remembered when Oscar
nominations are awarded.  Gary Oldman paints a complex, old world politician,
who'll pull any trick in the book to force his agenda.  He clearly believes
he's doing right, however.  The film's 'bad guy' is just not that black and 
white in the hand of this actor.  The vastly underrated Jeff Bridges gives the 
film's most purely entertaining performance as a down to earth President who 
doesn't showboat his intellect.</P>
<P>Christian Slater plays a young and idealistic congressman who compaigns to 
join Runyon's committee, only to have his eyes opened by what he learns from
the inside.  He hasn't been this good since his early teenage films.
William Petersen plays Hathaway as the modern equivalent of a good ol' 
governer with a knack for heroism and ambitions stoked by a nagging wife.  
Sam Elliott is brusquely outspoken and loyal as the Chief of Staff, who may 
disagree with Evans' support of Hanson (or any woman), but stays the course.  
Saul Rubinek fades into the woodwork as the communications officer.  Philip 
Baker Hall appears in one scene as Laine's Republican father and former state 
Governor.  Kathryn Morris makes an impression as the chirpy FBI investigator.</P>
<P>Technically the film is top notch, with Denis Maloney's urgent photography
keeping the audience in the midst of the action.  Costume design by Matthew
Jacobsen (who utilizes designers such as Armani, John Galliano, Pamela Dennis
and Brooks Brothers) is notable as well.</P>
<P>"The Contender" is slated to be a real contender itself when year 2000's
film lists are tallied.</P>
