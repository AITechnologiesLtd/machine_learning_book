<PRE>                                 THE PAPER
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1996 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>(1994) **** - C:Michael Keaton, Glenn Close, Marisa Tomei, Randy Quaid,
Robert Duvall, Catherine O'Hara, Jason Robards, Jason Alexander, Jill
Hennessy, Clint Howard, Rance Howard, Bob Costas.</P>
<P>Henry Hackett (Keaton), editor of a New York City tabloid, is doing
everything he can to gather enough information to print a big story that
could expose a major mafia scandal and free two innocent black youths
charged with murder, all while he's racing to meet his deadline for the
morning edition. With his wife (Tomei) about to give birth, his
argumentative managing editor (Close) always taking the opposing side, and a
rival newspaper trying to bring him into their organization, he's confronted
with more than one problem in just a 24 hour period.</P>
<P>Hackett's wife wants him to take the job with the other paper, which would
pay more money and he would be able to work fewer hours. But Henry isn't so
sure. Deep down, he likes his job. He likes the anxiety, the frustration,
and the utter chaos of it all.</P>
<P>There are plenty of subplots also. Randy Quaid plays a columnist who's
having a war of words with the city's parking supervisor, which later in the
film evolves into a much more drastic situation. Robert Duvall, the senior
editor of the paper, is undergoing health problems and wants to make up with
his daughter, who hasn't spoken to him in years. All of these come together
at the end.</P>
<P>Normally, I can't stand movies about journalists and their profession, but
director Ron Howard (who in my book has almost a perfect filmography), the
excellent script, and the great cast make this one worthwhile. The pacing is
perfect, the acting is right on the mark, and it's funny too. There are
plenty of one-liners, wisecracks, and amusing situations. An uptight
reporter asks Duvall's character to put out his cigar because his doctor
found nicotine in his urine, and Duvall's response is priceless.</P>
