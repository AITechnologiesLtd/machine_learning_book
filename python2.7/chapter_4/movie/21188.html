<PRE>                              THE INSIDER
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Listen up!  A movie adapted from a magazine article about the
making of a four-year old segment of a television program:  Does this
pitch have you hooked yet?  No?  Well, despite a potentially dry-as-dust
premise, THE INSIDER manages to rise above its inherent limitations and
provides a compelling look inside the politics of `60 Minutes' and the
tobacco industry.</P>
<P>     They say you should never see two things being made:  Sausage and
legislation.  Add journalism to that list.  I've been in this racket
long enough to know that objectivity is painfully lacking in the places
you expect to find it the most.  Backroom deals make strange bedfellows
of interest-conflicted parties (e.g. Time-Warner owns Entertainment
Weekly magazine, which reviews Warner Bros. films, etc.)  So when `60
Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) decided to do a story about
the hazards of cigarettes in 1996, he found himself embroiled in
controversy.</P>
<P>     Central to that controversy was Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a VP with
Brown & Williamson, the #3 tobacco company in the U.S.  Just-fired and
full of rage, Wigand `blew the whistle' on B&W, and after much
haranguing, he told a tale of the hazards of smoking – and the fact that
the tobacco companies knew about those hazards – to Mike Wallace
(Plummer) and `60 Minutes.'</P>
<P>     But before the segment could air, B&W threatened legal action
against all the parties, Wigand became the subject of a vicious smear
campaign, his wife left him, he basically went nuts, and Bergman started
to feel responsible for ruining Wigand's life – all with nothing to show
for it, because CBS top brass refused to air the interview.</P>
<P>     Add in the impending sale of CBS to Westinghouse, and you're
staring into a morass of journalistic dishonesty and a legal migraine.</P>
<P>     That any of this makes interesting filmmaking is a genuine
surprise, and with a running time close to 3 hours, it's even more
amazing that my attention was held throughout.  Mann, last seen
directing HEAT, is certainly unnecessarily long-winded throughout the
movie, but some stellar performances keep THE INSIDER going strong.  It
goes without saying that Pacino burns in his role, but it's Crowe who
deserves the real praise as the falling-apart Wigand.  Think Oscar
nomination; he deserves it.</P>
<P>     Christopher Plummer does an amazing impression of Mike Wallace, and
also of note is Bruce McGill, as a Mississippi D.A., who has about five
minutes of amazing screen time.</P>
<P>     The funny thing about THE INSIDER is that Wigand's story is not the
most interesting part of the film.  It is at first, but Mann (wisely)
eventually directs the story back to CBS, with focus on the wrangling
within its corporate hierarchy about whether to run the interview.
Why?  Because the `danger of smoking' is really old news.  Philip
Morris's recent admission that smoking causes cancer is a further sign
that this whole debate might be beating a dead horse.</P>
<PRE>     Stick *that* in your pipe.</PRE>
