<P>"Singin' in the Rain" (1952) **** (out of four)</P>
<P>Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly
Written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green </P>
<P>Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds,
Jean Hagen, and Rita Moreno </P>
<P>Very rarely does a movie have it all. It's almost
impossible to find a film (or anything for that
matter) 
that contains a perfect mixture of whatever elements
it attempts to combine. Whenever one of these gems is
released, word of mouth travels quickly and you've got
yourself a classic. The perfect film must attract all
types seeking all styles of film genre; Singin' in the
Rain is the perfect film. With the best choreography I
have ever seen, the most pleasant songs I've ever
heard in a movie, a sweet romance that is simple and
believable, a pair of
laugh-‘til-you-can't-see-straight performers, a
flawless plot structure, an amazingly creative set
design, bright colorful photography, the unmatchable
wit and charm of a consummate Hollywood hero, and a
bearably brief (but not too brief) running time,
Singin' in the Rain is the ideal model for a complete
picture. It's not missing anything, because 
it has everything.</P>
<P>What I love about this movie is that despite being
known as primarily a-song-and-dance production, the
plot is actually as interesting as the main
attraction. Unlike other pictures that create some
lame 
excuses to have a variety of characters tap dance on
tables, this movie actually makes sense. And also
unlike other movies which try to hard to create a
decent plot and thus widen the gaps between musical
numbers, Singin' in the Rain is as balanced as can be.
There was never a point where I grew tired of the
dialogue and prayed for the music to start up again or
a point where I prayed for the music to end and the
dialogue to proceed, it felt like the director built
the movie customarily for me and my desires (And the
fact that this movie was made almost half a century
ago and still is a joy to watch just shows that
quality can survive for an eternity).</P>
<P> The film begins with Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and
Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), two famous silent movie
stars thriving in the 1920's with the same amount of
popularity as a Backstreet Boy in our present time.
But there careers are endangered when technology in
filmmaking has advanced and the two actors are forced
to face the ultimate test:  having to star in one of
the first talking pictures ever.  Both actors
eventually progress on different paths; Lockwood has
an innate knack for carrying a film, talking or not.
Lamont, on the other hand, an annoying, selfish,
pompous brat with an unusually high pitched voice that
would kill her career if heard on film, has a little
more difficulty with the transition in cinema. When
the two actors make a disastrous film that bombs at a
test screening, changes definitely must be made before
a wide theatrical release. At the last moment,
Lockwood and friends decide to meticulously edit the
film by making it into a musical with Lamont's voice
replaced by his non-celebrity girlfriend's Kathy
Selden(Debbie Reyolds). But how will Lamont respond
when she hears about this change?</P>
<P>The acting in Singin' in the Rain is first rate. Gene
Kelly is excellent as the big-time movie star who 
just wants to be treated like an average Joe. And
because of his character's desire and mannerisms, it
is quite easy to relate to him. Donald O'Connor steals
the show as Cosmo Brown, friend and co-worker of Don
Lockwood. Providing comic relief, O'Connor completes
his job with a huge smile on his face the whole time.
Delivering one liners with the same dexterity as a
Marx Brother (when responding to the command `Call me
a cab,' Cosmo quickly responds: `OK, you're a cab'),
every time he is on the screen, even without any
lines, he is the center of attention - and every time
he's not present, you wonder where he is. Cosmo has
got to be one of the most likeable characters in any
movie. Jean Hagen is also extraordinary in a
villainous role that is both funny and evil at the
same time. One noteworthy scene places Lina Lamont at
the hands of a speech teacher with hilarious
consequences a la Pygmalion.</P>
<P>Even if you haven't seen the movie, you know the
songs. You've watched the main characters in A
Clockwork Orange or North By Northwest imitate Gene
Kelly's famous `Singin' in the Rain' bit and you've
probably uncontrollably whistled the tune at the sight
of a raindrop. I know I have. Other ballads accompany
the titular song that are equally `whistle worthy.'
`Make ‘Em Laugh,' `All I Do Is Dream of You' `Good
Morning,' and `Moses' are all unforgettable. The only
major complaint in this category is that you may have
some of these songs stuck in your head for an
unbearably long 
amount of time.</P>
<P>Most of the songs are supplemented by unbelievable
dancing. It is the dancing that makes these tunes 
look even better then they already are. The
choreography is stunning, period. The three main 
characters, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie
Reynolds each show their amazing talents with
extremely fast feet gliding accurately synchronized
with the person dancing alongside of them. Kelly is a
natural at what he did; when he accomplished the most
difficult moves, it seemed like he had not trouble at
all. O'Connor is just as good as his co-star and
during his hilarious `Make ‘Em Laugh' solo, watching
this slapstick performance in which he runs up walls
and dances with inanimate objects, you'll have a huge
smile plastered on your face guaranteed. Reynolds also
shows she can work right next to these two virtuosos
during the `Good Morning' segment. Never missing a
step, she gets brownie points for accomplishing the
routine in high heels. But nothing compares to Gene
Kelly's renowned `Singin' in the Rain' performance. As
he swings his umbrella and stomps in puddles, you know
exactly how he feels the whole time – he's in love,
who cares about the weather?</P>
<P>I'd dance and sing in the rain for Singin' in the
Rain. Each time I see it, I am forced into happiness.
Any movie that does this has to be perfect. Otherwise
what other reason is there to see a movie?</P>
