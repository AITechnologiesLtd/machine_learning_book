<PRE>IN SHORT: Dynamite.</PRE>
<P>Back in the days of the "good war" the German Nazi war machine had an
unbreakable code generated by a device code named ENIGMA. Over the
course of about three years, Allied Forces managed to piece together
parts of the code,culminating with the capture of a complete machine in
1944. Having broken the code, Allied Command was forced to watch as the
other side continued to sink our ships, for getting word to those ships
would tip the Germans to the fact that we knew what they were thinking.
That's a story for another day, unlike the compressed story told by
writer/director Jonathan Mostow in U-571, is a superb thriller and a
great ride, once things in the story go from bad to worse.</P>
<P>Mostow sets his story in the Spring of 1942, with the US fresh into the
war and still running World War I era subs like the S-33, which will
never be captained by Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) who has
been passed over for promotion. Tyler's hopes have been shot down by his
Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) and, before he can request
transfer to another boat, the S-33 ships out on a mission of utmost
secrecy and importance. It seems that Intelligence has tracked radio
signals from a floundering Nazi sub (and how that happened starts this
story in high gear) in the mid-Atlantic. The Germans have dispatched a
rescue sub; The S-33's mission is to get there first, waylay the crew
and steal the Enigma coding machine and code books. Best estimate is
that our side can get there ten hours before their side.</P>
<P>Nope. Nothing I've written spills anything that isn't in the trailer or
teevee spot, so don't complain. Let's just say that the nine Americans
who find themselves in control of a crippled, leaky U-boat must fight
the impossible fight against the full strength of a healthy Nazi Navy,
determined to send that Enigma machine to the depths. Among the American
crew (some will live and some won't) are Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel in
a low key, dead on dramatic performance), Lt. Peter Emmett (Jon Bon
Jovi), crewmen Mazzola (Erik Palladino) Wentz (Jack Noseworthy) and mess
steward Eddie (T.C. Carson) and Special Ops officers Lt. Hirsch (Jake
Weber) and Major Coonan (David Keith). German officer Kapitanlieutenant
Wassner (Thomas Kretschmann), a captive below decks plays a key role as
well.</P>
<P>We were taught in school of the "can do" effort of wartime America,
recovering from the almost complete destruction of the Pacific Fleet at
Pearl Harbor and Mostow's script, filled with depth charge and torpedo
battles and the decreasing odds for survival of our heroes, exploits
that spirit to the letter. His direction exploits the claustrophobic
conditions of the ship and the special effects run the gamut from bone
shaking to downright beautiful. I never thought I'd say that about a
depth charge going off, but you'll know the scene when you see it.</P>
<P>U-571 is a great popcorn flick, and while I usually use that term in a
deprecating fashion, I don't now. Outside of a short pause at the
beginning of the flick, catch your breath - you'll need it, U-571
doesn't stop. Not in its action, not to slow down and detail what
happened to the crewmen that don't make it. Put the popcorn hand on
autopilot and have a good time.</font> </p></P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to U-571, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.50</PRE>
<PRE>Great flick. No argument.</PRE>
