<P>Ben Stiller is playing the kind of character Adam Sandler should be playing. 
Not an idiot savant, mind you, but a grown-up jerk who has his heart in the 
right place. Stiller is still flirting with disaster and it is a joy to watch 
him in "Meet the Parents," a chaotic yet thoroughly restrained howler in the 
tradition of "Father of the Bride." When I think of Stiller in this film, I 
think of Murphy's Law - whatever can go wrong will go wrong. </P>
<P>Stiller plays Greg Focker (!), a Jewish male nurse who is ready to propose to 
his sweetly precious girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), a schoolteacher. Problem is 
she catches him at the wrong time when she mentions that her father, who is 
hard to please, has agreed to her other sister's wedding proposal to be 
married on their front lawn. Naturally, Greg and Pam go to meet her parents 
on Long Island, NY, to attend the wedding. Enter Pam's father (Robert De 
Niro), who pretends to be a retired florist to cover for his ex-CIA 
activities, and Pam's mother (Blythe Danner) who has a tender smile, even in 
the midst of chaos. Everything goes wrong from the start of what should be an 
enjoyable weekend. Greg screws up the family prayer at the dinner table when 
he hilariously mentions how to milk a cat (he also tells bad jokes). There is 
the running gag of De Niro's prized pet, a cat named Mr. Jinx, whom De Niro 
considers as much a family member as anyone else. Mr. Jinx has been trained 
to relieve itself in a toilet, though Greg suggests at one point that the cat 
could probably flush too. Then there is the whole septic tank incident, not 
to mention Pam's ex-boyfriend (Owen Wilson) who lives luxuriously and invites 
them to his home to show off. An excruciating lie-detector test followed by 
the usual misunderstandings about marijuana, and the constant use of Greg's 
last name ad nauseam. </P>
<P>Stiller is pitch-perfect as Greg - every scene he is in made me laugh louder 
than most comedies this year (and his resume is not bad either, from his 
roles in "Reality Bites" to "Flirting With Disaster" to "Mystery Men"). But 
what makes Stiller such a natural at being made a mockery is his 
vulnerability, whether it is seeing him dressed in pajamas when walking into 
his possible future in-laws at breakfast time or his slow burn leading to a 
completely frazzled condition in front of De Niro's hidden video cameras - he 
is the clumsy nerd with a core of humanity. We may not always understand his 
motives but we can't help but feel sorry for him, even if he spray paints a 
cat's tail!</P>
<P>De Niro is at his comical best relaxing with smoothness and calmness, the 
likes of which we have not seen since "Wag the Dog." De Niro does not force 
the audience to laugh with him, he merely plays it straight and has great 
comic timing. I cannot imagine a more suitable foil than De Niro's coiled 
charm to Stiller's maddening anxiety.</P>
<P>The Pam character and the ex-fiance are two characters that do not fit in to 
the frothy mix. Teri Polo is so bland and forgettable as Greg's girlfriend 
that she hardly seems worth all the trouble - that may be cruel but consider 
what someone with far more personality and range could have done with this 
role, say Lisa Kudrow or Uma Thurman? Owen Wilson also seems tired and flat 
as the ex, and it is generally a wasted, unnecessary role considering there 
is no payoff - he might dislike or disapprove of Pam's new love but there is 
not a single scene where he expresses that emotion. </P>
<P>I would have loved more intimate scenes between Danner and De Niro (the most 
unlikely pair of actors to play a married couple), but "Meet the Parents" is 
quite a laughfest from start to finish. And watching De Niro come up against 
Stiller is a marvelous sight and a true laugh riot to witness. Let's see 
those two again on screen soon, and Mr. Jinx too.</P>
