<P>The first few minutes of MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY are as familiar and 
pleasing as the opening notes of a favourite song.  The 
black-and-white opening credits.  New York.  Jazz.  Upper-class 
neurotic intellectuals.  One-liners.  Allusions to classic movies.  We 
have entered Woody Allen territory.</P>
<P>Allen, because he knows this material so well, establishes the 
situation, the tone, the characters of MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, in a 
few brief, economical scenes, then moves us swiftly into the plot: 
Larry and Carol (Allen, Diane Keaton) meet an elderly couple who live 
on the same floor of their apartment building, and then the wife dies 
of a heart attack the next day.  Or does she?  Carol thinks the 
husband (Jerry Adler) doesn't look sufficiently upset by his wife's 
death; she snoops, and is soon fabricating a complicated theory 
explaining how and why the husband may have killed his wife. </P>
<P>Larry doesn't buy it.  He sees the neighbour as a harmless fellow, 
who gets his kicks from showing off his stamp collection; he's not the 
murdering kind, and Larry thinks Carol has seen DOUBLE INDEMNITY one 
time too many.  Besides, while she thinks the possibility of living 
next door to a murderer is the most exciting thing that's ever 
happened to them, and a welcome break from their "dull routine," Larry 
is quite happy with his routine, and if the neighbour is a killer, he 
doesn't want to know about it, much less investigate.  So Carol, 
enduring Larry's barrage of fretful complaints, enlists their mutual 
friend Ted (Alan Alda) to join the investigation, and later Marcia 
(Anjelica Huston) also becomes involved (a plan she suggests involving 
tape recorders and a phone call leads to the film's biggest laugh).</P>
<P>That this is funny is no surprise.  Allen can write great dialogue in 
his sleep.  Larry, trapped in an elevator: "Don't tell me to 
relax--I'm a world-renowned claustrophobic."  Larry, talking to Carol 
about Ted: "Take away his elevator shoes, his fake suntan, and his 
capped teeth, and what do you have?"  Carol: "You."  The chemistry 
between Allen, Keaton, and Alda is terrific; Keaton and Alda have 
worked with Allen before, and this is apparent in the effortless way 
they inhabit their roles.  They are so (seemingly) artless that many 
scenes seem half-improvised.  Allen has great fun putting his habitual 
persona in the thick of a murder mystery: his paranoia and anxiety are 
played up to good effect, as he offers a running commentary of fear 
and doubt throughout each escapade.</P>
<P>What is surprising is how effective the mystery is.   By the midway 
point, I was hooked; the plot had gone places I didn't think it would 
go, and I was eager to know how it would all turn out.  The use of 
handheld camera and long takes are vital: when Carol sneaks into the 
neighbour's apartment, this visual style gives the film an edgy, 
pseudo-documentary feel that makes the scene surprisingly tense.</P>
<P>The suspense and humour are neatly woven together.  Allen seamlessly 
merges these two disparate moods by having the characters themselves 
treat the possible murder as little more than a joke: they see it as a 
welcome source of excitement, and gather in trendy, upscale 
restaurants to discuss what might have happened, lifting ideas from 
movies and books.  It is a game, a fiction.  Murder is not real to 
these comfortable Manhattanites, even if it should happen next door.  
This allows Allen to have a lot of fun with some dark subject matter, 
without being too frivolous.</P>
<P>This blend of wit and morbidity is the most original element here, 
and Allen deftly, convincingly handles the transition from innocuous 
amateur sleuthing to something more sinister.  Otherwise, he doesn't 
really do anything new--there are no great revelations, there is no 
pushing of the boundaries.  He simply does what he usually does: sees 
with a keen eye the way human beings behave, and turns his 
observations into something funny, fast-paced, engrossing.  It may be 
routine for Woody Allen, but it's not dull.</P>
