ENTER THE DRAGON
A Film Review by Dragan Antulov
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>When I was growing up in 1970s, boys in my school used to divide into
two groups, based on their action movies preferences. The first one,
myself included, liked movies that featured spectacular car chases, lots
of machinegun fire and huge explosions. The latter one preferred Hong
Kong martial arts flicks, probably because they could (or, to be more
precise, thought they could) imitate its stunts in the real life.
Decades later, while refining my own cinematic taste, I began to
appreciate and actually like those movies, probably because of
overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids. Yes, most of the
Kung Fu and other "martial arts" flicks were cheap, they had predictable
and formulaic plot, and asked very little of production values aside
from martial arts skills. But, in the same time, those movies had their
own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific
guilty pleasure and source of relaxation.</P>
<P>The best of those movies, one that passed the test of time and managed
to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was ENTER THE
DRAGON. Made in 1973 in a joint Hong Kong - Hollywood venture, it was
intended to bring Bruce Lee's skills and Kung Fu philosophy to the
Western audience. It succeeded, but it is still debatable whether by its
own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of Bruce Lee that
immortalised the myth about that actor.</P>
<P>Lee plays a quiet Shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert. He is
approached by Interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial
arts tournament that is held on a remote island, owned and controlled by
Han, renegade Shaolin monk. Interpol suspects that the martial arts
business is just cover for narcotics, gun-running and prostitution
operations and Lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to
intervene. Lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons -
O'Harra, Han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of
Lee's sister years ago. The island is also destination of two colourful
martial arts experts from US - Williams (played by Jim Kelly) is Black
activist running from the racist police, and his friend Roper wants to
make money in order to pay gambling debts.</P>
<P>The plot of ENTER THE DRAGON was in many ways influenced by James Bond
(the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using Kung Fu elements
in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN two years later). The main hero was faced
against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island, alone against
whole army of bad guys. On the other hand, Lee was more believable hero
than Bond; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets, he had to rely only
on his personal skills in order to survive. In the same time, the plot,
although extremely thin, allowed him even some internal battles -
between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own
anti-violent philosophy. The latter provided some opportunities to
evaluate Lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive
screen presence.</P>
<P>Although two other main actors - John Saxon being the obligatory good
white guy and Jim Kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were
intended to share top spot with Lee, they served as nothing more than a
comic relief. It is a real shame to see Kelly, definitely the worse
actor than Saxon, to steal the scenes from him only because his lines,
being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches, sound so damn over the
top. Other actors, not including Shih Kien who turns Han into typical,
although not very convincing Bondian villain, are nothing more than fist
fodder for Bruce Lee (among them is young Jackie Chan).</P>
<P>Fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago,
although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre. In many way
they are also more realistic (they were personally staged by Lee
himself), demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the
opponent. I'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan, but
comparing those scenes with typical scenes today I simply can't avoid to
appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of
bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end.</P>
<P>So, despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being Top
100 of All Times, ENTER THE DRAGON is a incredibly entertaining piece of
cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who
don't like that particular genre.</P>
