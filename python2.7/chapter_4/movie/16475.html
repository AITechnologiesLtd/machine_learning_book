<PRE>Shakespeare In Love.</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow
Directed By John Madden
Running Time: 2 hours.</PRE>
<PRE>(Miramax)</PRE>
<P>This story about the Bard and his love for a woman named Viola is witty,
dramatic and very very enjoyable. The plot centres around William
Shakespeare (Fiennes) who is stuck for ideas for his next play. He soon
hashes one together, and gets a cast together, featuring the likes of Ned
Alleyn (Ben Affleck), but the one cast member who strikes him is a young
'boy' played by Paltrow. They soon start a relationship, but she is already
set to be married to the slimy Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) who wants nothing
but her money. Will Will (pun kinda intended) both keep Viola and get his
play finished in time?</P>
<P>Despite a simple story conceived by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman,
Shakespeare in Love is undeniably charming. Wit and drama is dished out in
equal amounts, and there's a fair bit of sentimentally in there aswell. The
cast give all their worth to the well realised script. Fiennes is a standout
as the young William, giving an energetic and well rounded performance. Ben
Affleck is fun as the 'Bruce Willis' of the Elizabethan age, offering a
change of pace for him since the hectic Armageddon. Colin Firth doesn't have
much to work with what is a very two dimensional character, but he gives a
suitably slimy performance even if he is nothing but a plot device. Also
popping up are British comedians  Martin Clunes and Mark Williams giving two
likeable performances, Geoffrey Rush as a flustered theatre manager, and
Dame Judi Dench makes an appearance as Queen Elizabeth, who gets a very
funny scene at the end of the film. The cast list goes on, and each
individual performance is a delight.</P>
<P>But it's Paltrow who has to carry the film, and while she's a competent
actress, she's never experienced a role as challenging as this one.
Thankfully, she's really rather good, delivering Shakespeare lines with ease
and brings a lot of charm and warmth to her character. I find it hard to
believe, however, that Shakespeare mistook her for a boy, and even with a
moustache she still looks as beautiful as ever (make of that what you will.)
And, the chemistry between Fiennes and Paltrow is intense, although with
boyfriend Affleck on set it may have been a bit embarrassing for her acting
slushy with another man right in front of her own man!</P>
<P>While the story is wafer thin, it's well handled by Mrs. Brown director John
Madden, who grabs the audience attention and keeps a strong hold on them. I
found it very hard not to be entranced by the film, with it's rich, vibrant
colours and costumes and entertaining interpretation of the screenplay.
There's also lots of contemporary references to look out for, the long
'credit's list on Will's new play being one of them. The soundtrack is nice,
and the entire production is very enchanting.</P>
<P>Knowledge of Shakespeare and his plays aren't really needed, although it may
help to get some of the jokes. The film is based around one of the Bards
better known plays, 'Romeo & Juliet,' which thanks to Leonardo DiCaprio has
been opened up to a whole new generation of teenage girls. In summary, it's
very hard not to like Shakespeare in Love. It truly is a lovely film, and
would be an excellent use of two hours.</P>
<PRE>Heartily recommended.</PRE>
