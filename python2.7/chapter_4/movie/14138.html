<P>Plot: FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the defunct X Files 
paranormal investigation division are brought before an investigating 
committee, blamed for negligence when a bomb defusal at a Federal 
building in Dallas goes wrong. But then Mulder encounters a conspiracy 
fanatic who provides him with information that leads him to discover 
that the bomb was really detonated to destroy several bodies infected 
with a prehistoric alien virus uncovered in Texas. As they investigate, 
the international cabal working in collaboration with alien invaders to 
unleash the virus, seek to stop Mulder by infecting Scully with the 
virus.</P>
<P>In the same way that we can now look back at the frenetic outpouring of 
alien invasion and atomic monster films of the 1950s with a fascination 
at just how much they reflect the insecurity of the times, future 
historians will no doubt similarly look back at the incredible 
outpouring of paranoia and conspiracy films and tv series at the moment 
as indicative of something deeply upsetting about the 1990s. For if this 
body of films and tv series is any reflection of the way society thinks 
then society is surely rent to the darkest places of the soul by a sense 
of distrust and paranoia; a loss of identity; a recurrent belief that 
the government is covering up the truth; the belief that there is 
something fundamentally rotten at the heart of many respected social 
institutions; and the recurring surety that some golden past has been 
inevitably corrupted and that society is falling towards a moral 
collapse. The widespread prevalence of these sentiments (at least in the 
American media) and the darkness of their presentation is something that 
borders on the positively pathological.</P>
<P>Blame it all on Oliver Stone and 1991's `JFK' which really started the 
whole conspiracy/loss of the American dream thing off. (A substantial 
number of these films and series start the beginning of the corruption 
of American society with the Kennedy assassination). But it was `The X 
Files' in 1993 which tied the conspiracy angle to alien abductions and 
the great conspiracy junkie conviction that something happened in 
Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. As a series `The X Files' has conducted, 
with considerable wit and elegance, a number of fresh and inventive 
takes on traditional and not-so traditional forms of ghost and monster 
stories. And beneath the series is this cool, shadowy conspiratorial 
edginess that touches a bone of 1990s alienation that seems like it just 
could be real - and indeed has made the series into a cult phenomenon. 
What does strike one about `The X Files' and others like `Nowhere Man' 
(1995) and `Dark Skies' (1996) that have sought to imitate it, is the 
novelty of their storytelling - they are the only series where the 
hero/heroine lose each week. Indeed despite the proclamation "The truth 
is out there" over the credits of `The X Files', the format of the 
series is really dependent on the truth never being uncovered.</P>
<P>Now comes `The X Files' (or else `The X-Files' if you read the end 
credits) which attempts to spin the series cult popularity out into a 
cinematic franchise. Whether the movie remains just a one-off experiment 
or whether it becomes the torch-carrier for the series future, remains 
to be seen at this point. The film has met with a relatively 
disappointing box-office performance which has apparently stamped some 
question over future films.</P>
<P>There are an interesting number of comparisons that can be made between 
`The X Files' movie and `Star Trek: Generations' in 1994 - both are 
remarkably similar in the way they were made and the problems they 
contain. Both were construed as the initial attempts to launch a popular 
tv series as a cinematic franchise; both were made very close to the end 
of shooting schedules on the tv series; both were disappointments with 
their intended fan audiences; and both seem uncomfortable with the 
widescreen format, looking more like feature-length tv episodes than 
films that have been designed as big-screen features.</P>
<P>The film seems uneasily caught between trying to offer up the series' 
cultists what they expect of it and trying to reiterate the gist of the 
series all over anew for any audience members that may have wandered in 
not having seen the series - and as a result has really ended up 
pleasing neither crowd. Indeed a good part of its approach and a 
substantial portion of its predicted earnings was gambled on attracting 
new fans in the theatres. But a good reason for the film's lack of 
expected box-office take may well be that its advertizing campaign was 
gambled entirely on selling the film to the fan audience rather than 
seeking to attract new audiences. All the advance that new audiences 
were given was simply a poster which told nothing about the film. 
Details of the plot were kept under a screen of absolute secrecy until 
the film's release. The stills available seemed the dullest imaginable - 
only a variety of shots of Mulder and Scully walking down corridors and 
in bare fields. One suspects that such an approach ended up being 
counter-productive - that it created a film that nobody knew anything 
about except those guaranteed to be drawn by the series brand name. In 
all likelihood the film's lack of real success has been this critical 
miscalculation in its promotional campaign and its failure to draw 
anybody new in.</P>
<P>The story only really seems like a reshuffling of the basic plot 
developments and cliches of the last three seasons of the series. Stop 
me if you have heard this before:- not one but two different people 
involved on the inside of the big conspiracy and/or claiming connection 
to Mulder's father accost him in back alleys to provide cryptic 
information (that points him in the direction the plot needs to go); the 
FBI seek to close down the X Files; the FBI conduct Internal Affairs 
investigations where blame is placed on Mulder and Scully as part of a 
coverup; Mulder and/or Scully are on the verge of giving up altogether 
in the face of the overwhelming attempt to silence them until a fresh 
piece of alien evidence and conspiratorial activity sets them on the 
trail anew; Scully is infected with a disease to which there is no known 
medical cure; Scully is abducted; Mulder must trek all the way to an 
alien base hidden under the polar ice caps; alien DNA is uncovered in 
the remains of cavemen; innocent boys are infected by the Black Oil and 
the incident quickly covered up; the cabal meets in shadowed rooms and 
in cryptic terms plot massive coverups and how to silence Mulder; 
mysterious viral experiments are being conducted on the unwitting 
populace and so on. </P>
<P>The problem with `The X Files' as a tv series is that it started 
superbly with inventive one-off stories and its spooky, shadowy glimpses 
into the dark places operating behind the government. But while with the 
most recent two seasons the series has been riding at an absolute 
artistic peak and conducting some of the best one-off stories so far 
(`Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man', `Home', `Postmodern Prometheus', 
`Bad Blood' to name but a handful), the series has tended to fall down 
when it comes to its continuing elaboration of its own mythology and 
backstory. Unlike `Babylon 5' which has a similarly complicated and 
elaborate series of unfolding revelations, you get the feeling `The X 
Files' is building a rather rickety structure as it is going along 
rather than adhering to a coherent preplanned grand schema. The 
backstory has now become so complicated it is near impossible to keep 
track of all the subplots involving black oil, alien wars, clones, 
shape-changing assassains, alien abductions and implants, who is who's 
father and sibling, and all the conspiracies within the conspiracies. In 
last season's two-parter `Patient X/The Red and the Black' it became 
impossible to work out whose side which group of aliens were on and who 
the traitor Krycek was really working for.</P>
<P>The same problem spills over here. The film is stuck with a sprawlingly 
complicated plot which tries to encompass everything but more than 
anything ends up showing the increasing cracks in the scenario's 
believability. It seems filled with an absurd number of holes, 
implausibilities and unanswered questions - Why does Terry O'Quinn 
agent-in-charge allow himself to be blown up along with the bomb inside 
the Federal building (one is unable to work out why, even assuming he 
was involved in the conspiracy, it was necessary for him to sacrifice 
his life) ? The cabal's plan to take Scully away from Mulder is built on 
such a series of complicated coincidences as to seem preposterous - that 
Mulder and Scully will find the sealed area hidden under a children's 
playground, that they will manage to choose the correct direction in the 
middle of nowhere to follow a series of departed trucks, that they will 
then discover the domes in the cornfield, will enter and then Scully (as 
opposed to Mulder who is equally unprotected) will be stung by the 
virus-carrying bees, whereupon the cabal will be waiting outside 
Mulder's apartment (as opposed to her own) posing as fake ambulance men, 
having tapped his 911 call in order to abduct her when she collapses. 
And the revelation that what the conspiring cabal has been so ruthlessly 
fighting for all these years is really to sit back so an alien virus can 
enslave the entire human race seems laughable.</P>
<P>The film is disappointingly lacking in many of the things that made the 
series memorable. There is none of the ingenious plotting development or 
explanations of just how the paranormal might exist, and the sense of 
laconic humour between the two characters that drives the series is 
conspicuously lacking for the most part. And the things it seems to 
think the series depended on - the dark, paranoid claustrophobic visual 
look and the tight, constricted plotting - really don't work up on the 
screen. The dark, shadowy look that works so well on the small screen 
seems cramped translated to the big screen. And the tight plotting 
designed for a 50 minute tv hour keeps the film turning so tightly that 
one is too busy following what is meant to be going on to become 
involved. What it really needs to work as a film is to be opened up for 
the big screen - surely the one thing it was hoping to offer that the 
series couldn't - but it never does. Director Rob Bowman, a veteran from 
the series, offers up a few shots of wide open desert, snowy wastes and 
big domes but there seems sadly almost no difference between the look of 
a two million dollar tv episode and a 60 million dollar film. There's an 
impressive special effect of a UFO rising at the climax but visual 
effects supervisor Mat Beck, also a veteran of the series, seems to have 
conducted it as though he were working it for a limited tv budget and 
its appearance seems more cursory than awe-filled. </P>
<P>The failing of the film is many of the failings of the tv series writ 
large. Like the big issue that circulated the fandom before the film's 
release - would the underlying sexual tension between the two characters 
be fulfilled ? - The Big Kiss here is all tantalizing tease which at the 
last moment deftly ducks away from delivery of anything. What we 
likewise have is a film that gives the appearance of answering all the 
big questions that lie behind the series - that in its advertizing 
campaign "Fight the Future" and the lead up of plot strands from the 
previous season promises the grand concept of an alien war - but equally 
dances away from actually delivering anything. It teases but instead in 
the end all it resorts back to is the series' status quo - the 
conspiracy's current plan is thwarted but all evidence that might be 
used to prove anything is eliminated; Mulder and Scully are reinstated 
but no further ahead in proving anything than they were at the very 
start of the series; and the real truth still remains out there ever 
elusive.</P>
<P>(Amusing piece of trivia:- one wonders if any `Star Wars' fans picked up 
the in-joke aimed at them in the last scene. Featured is the title 
credit `Foum Tatouine, Tunisia'. Tunisia, of course, was the location 
where George Lucas shot all the Tattooine scenes for `Star Wars').</P>
