<P>     FIRST KNIGHT is Jerry Zucker's re-invention of a segment of the 
Arthurian legend ("re-interpretation" would be too light a word to 
describe the wholesale changes made to the Vulgate Cycle).  What we get 
here, however, is often unintentionally closer to MONTY PYTHON AND THE 
HOLY GRAIL's silliness than to EXCALIBUR's melodramatic grandeur.  Bad 
acting, dumb dialogue, and confusing cinematography abound, creating one 
of the most shoddy Camelot stories to date.  What makes FIRST KNIGHT 
seem even worse is that it's up against the vastly superior BRAVEHEART, 
a romantic adventure in very much the same vein, although formed from an 
entirely different mould. </P>
<P>     In FIRST KNIGHT, we're introduced to King Arthur of Camelot (Sean 
Connery), his intended bride Guinevere (Julia Ormond), and the valiant 
Sir Lancelot (Richard Gere), who apparently is hot for the queen-to-be 
(or so the script tells us -- you couldn't tell by Gere's acting).  
Conspicuous by their absence, however, are the likes of Sir Galahad, 
Morgan le Fay, the Holy Grail, Merlin, Excalibur, and Mordred.  The 
villain of this piece is Malagant (Ben Cross), an ex-knight of the Round 
Table who's out to take control of Arthur's kingdom.  Add to this an 
idiotic Hollywood ending, and FIRST KNIGHT turns out to be a mess of the 
first order. </P>
<P>     Sean Connery is perfect for the King Arthur role.  Too bad he isn't 
given more to do than stand around looking regal.  In fact, the film is 
about one-quarter over before he makes his first appearance.  Julia 
Ormond, who was so impressive in LEGENDS OF THE FALL, is underwhelming 
here, constantly wringing her hands over the dilemma of who she loves 
most.  Then there's Richard Gere, terribly miscast as Lancelot.  In 
fact, it's hard to imagine a less likely figure in the part of this 
legendary hero, uttering such pretentious lines as "I never believed in 
anything before, but now I believe in Camelot."  At least he spares us 
an attempt at a bogus British accent. </P>
<P>     There are the requisite battle sequences which feature huge armies 
clashing on an open field.  Filmed with all the coherence of an MTV 
video, these are prime examples of how not to shoot this sort of scene.  
Maybe Zucker should have consulted Mel Gibson before embarking on this 
project.  The sustained tension of BRAVEHEART's battles is in marked 
contrast to the boredom generated by FIRST KNIGHT's. </P>
<P>     When all is said and done, there's still at least one amazing thing 
about FIRST KNIGHT:  after being kidnapped, dragged through a forest, 
imprisoned, rescued, and nearly drowned, Guinevere's lipstick is 
perfectly intact.  That this bit of minutia sticks out so clearly speaks 
volumes about the dullness of this supposed adventure film.  When it 
comes to potential summer blockbusters, FIRST KNIGHT ends up close to 
last. </P>
