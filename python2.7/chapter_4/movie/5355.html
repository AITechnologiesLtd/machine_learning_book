<P>     Based on William Bradford Huie's novel, THE AMERICANIZATION OF
EMILY has got to be one of the most pleasant surprises of the 60s -- a
low-scale, sassy anti-war love story. Adapted by the late Paddy Chayefsky,
it's a precursor of sorts to his irreverent, anti-establishment
screenplays THE HOSPITAL and NETWORK. Fronting as a Navy Commander-aide de
camp to Admiral Melvyn Douglas, James Garner is really one of the infamous
"dog-robbers" of WW II, those notorious personal assistants as foxy
purchasing agents who made sure that every imaginable need, want and vice
were provided for their bosses. (The robbers continue today.) Garner's not
supposed to be quite so attractive, what with his shit-eating grin, his
practicing cowardice, his ever-ready boxes of Hershey's and -- to the
amazement of all who see it -- his small warehouse of contraband like a
miniature Harrods. But in that those he encounters -- especially Julie
Andrews as Emily and her mother -- have all suffered from the mounting
death from war, his recreant's honesty is acid-laced yet magnetic: "God
save us from all the people who do the right thing." Sizing up Andrews'
reserved smugness, he cracks, "You're something of a prig." Irritated by
her bemoaning his party mood in the middle of war, he says, "Lay off, Mrs.
Miniver." Garner's Charlie is Huie's creation, but it's Paddy who put
Charlie on the soap box: his word heaps have the unmistakable pitch of
Paddy's rantings on hypocrisy; viewers not having seen EMILY but who have
seen NETWORK will be reminded of Peter Finch's Howard Beale. Never better,
Andrews' Englishwoman's shell has cracks in it, some secrets oozing out --
confirmed by Andrews to Mike Wallace on a recent 60 Minutes, on which she
admits that she had a "wonderful time" doing loves scenes with Garner.
(When those shots were finished, she said, "My knees buckled.") In Look
magazine back in 1966, famed photographer of women Douglas Kirkland
confirmed her polished dishiness with a color blow-up showing tantalizing
cleavage; as Alfie might say, she's one sexy bird. (Mind you, that's
thirty years ago, but I recall that picture well because I had it hanging
inside my Army barracks locker in Wurzburg.) EMILY as full introduction to
Andrews gave me a goodie-goodie immunization and for this I'm still
thankful, because I was lucky enough not to have first suffered shattered
ear drums from her piercing-like singing or feel oppressed by the
sugar-weighted baggage of Maria. Her Emily is prig, is bitch, and if her
novice movie acting shows, it's fitting: English Emily is a closet case,
outwardly the stoic martyress, inside as much of a sensualist as extrovert
Charlie. And Garner's waggish, effortless sleaze is irony of the most
charming kind: his Charlie's rapid-fire ravings reverb as wisdom even
while admitting, despite prangs of conscience, he's "not equipped to deal
with the truth," most particularly in light of the hero worship he'll
receive as the first victim on Omaha Beach to come back from the dead. If
there are too many harangues -- like an addiction, Paddy often didn't know
when to stop -- Garner makes them worth listening to; you sense that he
knows as an actor that he might never get dialogue this meaty again. (So
far he hasn't.) Directing Paddy's THE HOSPITAL too, and inexplicably
nominated for a best director Oscar for LOVE STORY, it's pretty much
unchallenged that EMILY remains Arthur Hiller's best movie. His confining,
pedestrian style showcases Paddy's zesty pontifications and the cast's
equally joyful verve in reciting them. Douglas, who won the Oscar for HUD
the year before, proves once more there's gold to be mined in character
parts. His Admiral's crazed visions of military glory via subterfuge have
uncomplimentary echoes. Try to avoid the colorized version: it has all the
hues of a latrine.  </P>
