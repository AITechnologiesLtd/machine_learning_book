<PRE>IN SHORT: A Happy Happy surprise</PRE>
<P>Lessee what we got here. We got three bankrobbers: one dumb, one brutal
and one average, normalguy con, all escaped from a Texas chain gang.
We've got an old maid school teacher. We've got a straight arrow cop and
a beautiful woman as a (business) authority figure in a small town in
which none of the principals have anything resembling a love life. Toss
gently with a case of mistaken identity and whether you call 'em stock
characters or stereotypes, if you've seen 'em once, you've seen 'em a
thousand times, written by a thousand different hacks, banging away at
their keyboards trying to pay the rent . . .</P>
<P>And on try number One Thousand and One, you find a pair of writers who
know what they're doing, in this case Ed Stone and Phil Reeves. The pair
take ordinary people in, for the most part, ordinary situations and give
a fistful of good actors some great material to build greater characters
with. When stuff like this happens, and it's usually with the "smaller"
and mostly independently produced films, we critics jump up and down and
yell until we're blue in the face, to try and drum up support for 'em.
Especially as the deluge of Oscar wannabe monstrosities comes surging at
us. But, being as the citizens of Happy, Texas are good, quiet folk,
Cranky will say it quietly: "please see this movie." It's sweet and it's
simple and it's heartfelt and it's well worth your time.</P>
<P>Simply: Three cons escape from a chain gang. Bob Maslow (M.C. Gainey)
finds the keys, unlocks himself and runs away. Harry Sawyer (Jeremy
Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) either don't try to find
the keys that Bob has tossed, or are just to dim to go looking for 'em.
It doesn't matter; chained cons are just funnier. Harry and Wayne steal
a broken down RV and through coincidences to, um, coincidental to give
away, find themselves taking on the identities of the actual owners of
the RV in the sleepy little town called Happy. Year after year, Happy
has sent their happiest little kidlets off to the "Little Miss Squeezed
Pageant". Year after year, they failed to place any contestants. So the
good citizenry hired David and Steve, professional beauty pageant
coaches, to better their chances. The town knows they've hired pros 'cuz
they read about 'em in a magazine . . .</P>
<P>And, of course, the men are gay, which is probably why the people of
Happy think they've got the best. That's as far as any stereotypical
"gay" jokes go. "Steve" (formerly Harry) sees a bank ripe for plunder,
and a lovely bank manager named Joe (as in Josephine, played by Ally
Walker) to fall in love with. "David" (formerly Wayne) is left to teach
the seven year old kidlets how to sing and dance. He can do neither, of
course, but he has the aid of the local old maid schoolmarm, Ms.
Schaefer (Illeana Douglas). The entire town is protected by, and under
the watchful eye of, Sheriff Chappy Dent (William H. Macy) who also has
his eyes out for "love".</P>
<P>We spoke with William H. Macy back when Mystery Men came out and he made
a point of mentioning how happy he was with this movie. We're going to
go hunting down the clip so you can hear it for yourself. In the
meantime, if Happy Texas comes around (its initial release is so limited
you're going to have to keep your eyes peeled) do your approximation of
a two step shuffle-on-over to your local theater. You'll be remembering
Steve Zahn (first noted as the Peter Scolari lookalike last seen in Tom
Hanks' That Thing You Do) whose Wayne sets new standards for dense and
lovable.</P>
<P>With the new teevee season starting, I thought I'd mention that Walker
comes via the small screen's "Profiler" on NBC. Douglas is currently in
Fox's "Action". And once upon a time "Beast" Ron Perlman has a small
supporting role as the Texas Marshal from the next town up the street.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Happy Texas, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.75</PRE>
<PRE>Great for grown ups. Cranky loved it.</PRE>
