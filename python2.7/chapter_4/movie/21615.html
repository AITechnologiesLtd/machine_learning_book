<P>One thing is for sure when you undertake to see a George Miller film. It
will be well written and carefully paged all the way to the end, not leaving
many unanswered questions.  And it will leave you thinking  about the film.
Be it Mad Max, the Road Warrior, or things like The Witches of Eastwick, or
more recently, Lorenzo's Oil.  The scripts may not be the tidiest, or the
best, but somehow, this director makes it all look alright, and still come
off with a story.</P>
<P>ANDRE is a story for children, but it is also a nice story for adults. It is
the story of a seal that got spoiled by a family, that took care of it when
it was young.  And despite the fact that the man taking care of the seal
happens to be the local harbor master, and he is violating rules by keeping
an animal captive, he manages to do his job and make a friend here and
there.  And, during what seems like a bad fishing season, the seal, is being
blamed for the poor fishing that all the hard working fishermen are having,
or at least for the fact that the harbormaster is more worried about the
seal, than he is about the welfare of the fishermen.</P>
<P>In time, the seal ends up going to Boston, some 200 miles from where they
are, and becomes a star in an aquarium.  But more importantly, Andre becomes
a star attraction in the small community, and seems to attract many
tourists.  And despite a few hang-ups, the devil may care attitude that the
seal has, manages to get it and some people in a bit of trouble, but mostly
in good humor.</P>
<P>While there is nothing fancy in this film, there is some real nifty shooting
in the water watching seals, and Andre do his thing, this film is nice
enough to grab your attention.  It isn't great, but it is nice.  And the
kids will love it.  Andre is an attention getter, and quite a critic, and tv
watcher.  And much smarter than we give him, and other seals, credit for.</P>
<P>Worth seeing, make sure the kids see it.</P>
