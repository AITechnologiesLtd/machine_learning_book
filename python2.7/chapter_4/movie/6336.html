<P>Decades ago, the  term "Theater of Silence" was applied in France to
plays in which rhetoric was replaced by restrained speech, where
dialogues comprised hesitations, where the subtext was more important
than the text. The appellation did not last long, yet found its
application in several theatrical genres, such as the work of Samuel
Beckett. </P>
<P>Most people have forgotten this. James Mangold probably never heard of
it, yet his "Heavy" fits that category well. A first feature yet a true
original, it was rightly awarded the Grand Jury Prize for Best Direction
at the Sundance Film Festival in early 1995. A good guess of why it was
released in the U.K. in 1995 but had to wait for U.S. distribution until
past mid-1996, is that this a maverick work, serious, non-Hollywoodish
and not catering to immature audiences. </P>
<P>Set in upstate New York in and around a roadhouse, the film has few sets
and even fewer characters. The tavern is named "Pete and Dolly's" after
the long-deceased Pete and his widow (Shelley Winters) who runs the
place. The sign ought to have changed to "Dolly's," but then time stands
still in this story. Regulars come and go as the diner also seems
isolated in space. We guess that it is near a town, but except for the
time when a hospital comes into the picture, "P & D" might as well be
miles from any urban agglomeration.</P>
<P>Molly's son, the thirtysomething Victor, is severely balding, heavy
(like "big" an euphemism for "fat"), 100 percent shy and 99 percent
silent. Not reserved, reticent, laconic. Not romantically taciturn. Just
silent. In the entire movie he utters just a few words, and when, under
stress, he does speak out, he breaks his record with two sentences.
That's near the end when he tells Delores  "You don't have to be nice,
only nicer" "Or what, Victor?" "I'll fire you." In a less restrained
movie you might feel like applauding.</P>
<P>The causes for this are not made known. One facile explanation goes that
Dolly is an overbearing mother --yet we don't see excessive control by
her, while her love for Victor is fairly obvious. There must have been
some sympathy for the heavy Victor character by Shelley Winters who went
from slim to...well, heavy. The Mama's Boy syndrome was much clearer in
"Only The Lonely (1991)"  a fine film where a Chicago policeman  (the
late, lamented, hefty John Candy) falls in love.  </P>
<P>The root of the trouble is more likely that Victor's poundage --tough
the man is far from  a monster of obesity --weighs heavy on his mind,
especially as he can't help eating  high-fat and junk foods. With
typical restraint, the film does not make a big show of this. But then,
to argue with myself, it is also clear that overeating can be a symptom
of other problems -- so we're back to square one.</P>
<P>In the meantime we might wonder at the increasing number of recent
movies that deal, directly or not, with food and sometimes with the
exclusively American problem of obesity. 
Let me only say that "Heavy" is a million times preferable to "Thinner." </P>
<P>The film opens with Molly hiring pretty Callie as a new waitress, to the
silent jealousy of Delores, the older barmaid and only other employee.
She has been around the block before, semi-flirts with elbow-bending
Leo,the most regular of regulars,ever-present on his bar stool. Delores
just might have views of permanency also with Victor. The un-cliched
Delores, warts and all like Molly, comes through as likable. </P>
<P>Callie is sweet, natural, none too talkative. He has an immediate,
silent crush on her and becomes even more conscious of his weight. The
rapport between the two, almost wordless, is immediate. But when, at
closing time, Callie declares :"My boyfriend is waiting," you can sense
the sky falling on Chicken Little.</P>
<P>There is little action and plot --as usually understood -- so that the
developments should not be divulged here. The film is, above all, one of
original, quiet yet minute observation of characters and relationships,
notably Victor's. It may, for some viewers, feel a bit heavy and in need
of some pruning, but on second thought, the same viewers might realize
that the length (not excessive by today's standards) allows the movie to
develop, so that several poignant, even heart-breaking passages
(Victor's mostly) can affect us as they do. Mind you, for the little
that is happening, a lot is happening too. What I mean by this paradox
will be understood by a sensitive public.</P>
<P>Lest one get the wrong idea, note that the beauty of "Heavy" is in its
details. The film is under the twin signs of naturalism and minimalism
in everything: script, direction, sets, the excellent photography and
editing, the music that does not obtrude and does the right thing at the
right moments. But naturalism does not preclude some very good scenes of
visions by Victor, including his first kiss with Callie -- as a
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. And  minimalism does away with
elaborations of unnecessary sights, such as details about the bar's
customers, or the guitar-strumming, singing Jeff, Callie's garage
mechanic boyfriend who is played by a member of the band "The
Lemonheads." </P>
<P>It came as no surprise to learn that 32-year old James Mangold is the
son of well-known painters, that among his earlier works was a
documentary about his mother, and that his father is a minimalist
artist. </P>
<P>Mr. Mangold has made no compromises. In its sympathetic but un-gooey
attitudes, the movie avoids the obviousness of melodrama, replaces
audience-pleasing but dishonest twists with real life (there is no
closure, for example), finds perfect interpreters in its cast.</P>
