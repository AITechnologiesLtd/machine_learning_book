<P>     If the idea of hearing "Rocks You Like Hurricane" played during a
racing scene doesn't gag you, then this is probably the film to see.
Halle Berry (who gets top billing!) and James Belushi star in this
dopey, feel-good family drama about a group of underprivileged Hawaiian
high-schoolers who design, build, and race a solar-powered car.  First,
in competition in Kona, and, then, as part of the 2000-mile, six-day
World Solar Challenge in Australia.</P>
<P>     Inspired by the true story, RACE IS SUN is amiable enough.  Adults
may fidget, but their kids won't mind the undercooked characters or the
sparse scientific detail.  (With seemingly no background, the class
builds a solar car.  Just like that!) The scenery is quite nice, and, as
honest happy endings go, any non-violent film that causes an audience of
kids to erupt into cheers is probably worth the stock it's printed on.
Now, if only someone could explain the odd resemblance, of late, between
James Belushi and Steven Seagal...</P>
