<P>    BEAN is bad, maybe unwatchable, as Rowan Atkinson's beloved Brit is
shoehorned into a pedestrian, poorly executed plot involving a famous
painting, a Los Angeles art gallery, and a classic case of mistaken
identity.  (You Know Who is believed to be... an art expert.)  The "Bean
bits"-- tampering with an amusement ride, pretending to have a firearm
in an airport, drying the front of his trousers with a restroom blow-
dryer, etc.-- arrive at infrequent intervals and too often consist en-
tirely of reaction shots.  Instead of just pointing the camera at Bean
and letting him do his thing, the filmmakers shift the focus to the
supporting stars and, by in large, that's a mistake.  (Okay, it *is*
pretty funny when Peter MacNicol's art curator goes nuts, after Mr. Bean
has his way with Whistler's Mother.) Worse is how Bean's scenes always
seem rushed.  He never gets to do more than three minutes of anything,
if that.  Even his most-elaborate routine-- a nighttime, commando-style
raid on the museum-- flies by at about four times the pace that it
should.  With Harris Yulin, Pamela Reed, and in a late and largely use-
less cameo, Burt Reynolds.</P>
