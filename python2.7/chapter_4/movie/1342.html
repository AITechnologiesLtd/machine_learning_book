<PRE>                                    WHORE
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1992 Lon Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Ken Russell
Starring Theresa Russell (no relation)
Rated and Unrated versions available</PRE>
<P>     There is an old saying which goes something like "The worst sex I
ever had was still pretty good."</P>
<P>     The closest film piece to this work (that I can think of) is TALK
RADIO directed by Oliver Stone and starring Eric Bogosian.  WHORE is
essentially a one-actor drama with other players.  The screenplay was
co-written by a woman and adapted from a stage play called BONDAGE.</P>
<P>     When the film had its theatrical release, there was nothing much
good that was said about it, save for very early on.  Prior to critical
review, WHORE was likened to a darker side of the popular film PRETTY
WOMAN which starred Julia Roberts.</P>
<P>     But as some reviewers today are pointing out, there is a difference
in watching a videotape out of one's house and going to the theatre.
WHORE, as a theatrical release, was a big bomb.  I didn't go to it
because, as many of you, I depend on the word of others to critique the
product beforehand.   And if going to the theatrical release of HENRY
AND JUNE can provide any insight, I think I was right is waiting for
the video release of WHORE.</P>
<P>     WHORE is a brutal film, but I also found moments of significant
humor.  And of course the humor has to do with sex.  This film, better
than any other shows the difference in the perception of sex between men
and women.  We're talking about sexual fantasy here and sexual fact.
Through the eyes of the prostitute, we see how ludicrous and funny
sexual fantasies can be.</P>
<P>     I need not enumerate what these fantasies are.  What the film shows
is the difference in point of view between the fantasy and the reality
and this can be quite funny and disturbing.</P>
<P>     In the concept of the Theatre of Cruelty created by French actor
and director Antonin Artaud, the author describes going to the theatre
like going to see the dentist: you know beforehand that you will be made
uncomfortable, but when it's all over, you will be better off for it.
It's doubtful that Ken Russell had the Theatre of Cruelty in mind, but
this is in effect what he accomplishes.</P>
<P>     See WHORE on video.  There is no need (or really any possibility
any longer) of seeing it in the theatre with guys with their hats in
their laps.  The NC-17 film has yet to made which does not make one feel
ill-at-ease with a room full of strangers.</P>
<P>     Make no mistake, there is much brutalizing that takes place in this
film, but that has all been done before.  What has not been done before
is to cast the cold eye of calculation on sex.  Who else is talking
about the use of condoms explicitly and repeatedly as a fact of life and
a part of *the job* in a work of fiction?</P>
<P>     The May 1992 issue of DETAIL magazine has a feature on the
Cabaret Royale in Houston: a new wave topless club with good taste: sort
of like a Playboy Club with "balls."  The author, after having talked
with the performers and the owner says of the performance:</P>
<PRE>     "She knows it's faker than fake... we all know ... but--at
     twenty-eight years old, quite a lot of love-of-my-life eye
     gazing behind me-- I realize something that I never knew.
     Something I never wanted to know. *I can't tell the difference*."
