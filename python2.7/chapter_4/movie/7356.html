<P>        The Cable Guy will get attention for three things: for being the film
that Jim Carrey first got $20 million for, the film that gave Carrey the
chance to ssttrreettcchh, and for being Carrey's first minor box-office
disappointment.  The surprising thing is that it is a very good movie.
It's Carrey's best to date and Broderick's best performance since The
Freshman(a little seen masterpiece with Marlon Brando).
        When he's not watching television, Chip Douglas(Jim Carrey) works as a
free-lance cable guy as a way to meet potential friends(he was fired
from dozens of real companies for stalking customers).  His latest
target is Steven(Matthew Broderick), a man living alone after he was
turned down for marriage to his girlfriend.
         At first, he seems friendly but strange, taking Steven to a huge
satellite dish (where he believes the entire world's cable comes from),
or to a restaurant called Medieval Times, where Steven and Chip joust in
the center ring(watch for Janeane Garfalo in a great bit as a waitress
at the restaurant).  But, after awhile, Steven doesn't need Chip
anymore(Mann has come back).  Chip is deeply hurt by this and sets out
to ruin Steven's life.  He turns Steven's family against him, gets Steve
fired, and gets him tossed in jail for receiving stolen property. 
        Matthew Broderick is the perfect Jim Carrey foil.  His calm, quiet,
sane acting style blends perfectly with Carrey's anything goes method.
They should make another movie together in the near future(How about if
Broderick plays the bad guy in the next Mask picture?).  The rest of the
cast does it's job well, but the movie is simply a showcase for Matt and
Jim.
        One of my problems with Batman Forever(and anyone who's read my VERY
long statement about B.F.; i.e., the reason Joel Schulmacher deserves to
die slowly and then burn in hell for all eternity, knows I have a few)
was that despite Jim Carrey's witty take on Frank Gorshin's Riddler,
Carrey didn't project a sense of menace.  Well, he's solved that problem
pretty well and I actually look forward to him taking on another
psychopath. 
But, Chip is a truly pathetic character; a desperately lonely man who,
because he grew up in front of the television(he learned the facts of
life from "The Facts of Life"), cannot communicate in any normal
fashion.  Everything Chip Douglas knows, he learned from television.
Every piece of advice he gives was from the tube, every joke he heard;
from the tube, in essence, he IS television(no wonder his favorite
restaurant is Medieval Times, its phony atmosphere is just like
something that you'd see on TV).  In the end, Chip's lack of knowledge
of the real world has doomed him to live alone forever.
        He is such a tragic character that we(or at least I) wanted him to
die.  In the end, as he plunges from the cable dish(how perfect: the
device that gave him "life" brings him death), we think that his
suffering is over, that he is at last at peace(of course, Stiller copped
out in letting Carrey live, as if watching him die would be too much for
his young fans).
        Of course, this film is supposed to be a black comedy.  It is very
funny at times.  During the first hour, Carrey's antic are silly, as
usual(his singing of "Somebody to Love", during a karaoke party,  is a
classic).  Even during the final 25 minutes, when Carrey takes on
Broderick atop the dish, there is always a sense of spoof in the
madness,  I am particularly fond of the moment where Carrey mentions
that real life doesn't have good suspense music; after which he starts
humming the same tune on the soundtrack, or when he holds Mann hostage
with... a staple gun.  Best of all is a very funny subplot about a
murder trial on the tube with former child sitcom star Stan Sweet(Ben
Stiller) accused of murdering Sam Sweet(Ben Stiller), after their sitcom
was canceled and they joined a religious cult(Stan claimed repeatedly on
the 911 call that Asians killed his brother, a really nasty swipe at the
Susan Smith case).
        Broderick once again proves he is a master at effective underacting,
and Carrey proves he can play both good and evil.  While the film is
very funny, it was the creepy elements that entertained me. I'll
remember Chip Douglas much longer than I'll remember AceVentura or Lloyd
Christmas.        "B+"</P>
