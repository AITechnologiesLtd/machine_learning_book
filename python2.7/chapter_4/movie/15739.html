<PRE>THE PRINCE OF EGYPT
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>When Dreamworks first set up an animation division to rival Disney, it
was a lofty goal.  And their first traditionally animated film, The
Prince of Egypt, makes some bold steps.  Telling the tale of Moses, the
film eschews Disney's traditionally comedic kid-friendly approach to
animation, in favor of a more serious, more adult style of animation.
Their experiment is a success.  While not a perfect film, its rich
visuals join with a strong storyline to create a true animated epic.</P>
<P>Fearing a population explosion, the Egyptian Pharaoh Seti (Patrick
Stewart) orders the murder of all Hebrew babies.  One Hebrew mother
(Ofra Haza) places her baby in a reed basket, and floats him down the
Nile to avoid his fate. Miraculously, the child ends up in the royal
palace, where the queen (Helen Mirren) adopts him and raises the baby
Moses as her own son.</P>
<P>Flash forward several years.  Prince Moses (Val Kilmer) and his elder
brother Prince Ramses (Ralph Fiennes) are a pair of royal
troublecausers.  They're particularly annoying to the royal priests,
Hotep and Huy (Steve Martin and Martin Short). However, Ramses, the
future Pharaoh, is also constantly worried about living up to the high
expectations set by his father.  Moses, on the other hand, is unaware of
his true identity, until a chance encounter with his real brother and
sister (Jeff Goldblum and Sandra Bullock), that is.</P>
<P>The brotherly conflict continues through adulthood, when each prince
takes a different path.  Ramses takes the throne and tries to expand and
surpass his father's empire.  Moses abandons his adopted family, and
instead opts for the life of a simple shepherd, and marriage to the
feisty Tzipporah (Michelle Pfieffer). But God has another destiny in
mind for Moses...one which will put him at odds with his former brother,
but which may finally grant freedom to the suffering Hebrew slaves.</P>
<P>With it's star studded cast, The Prince of Egypt suffers from the same
spot-the-star syndrome of Dreamworks' previous animated film, Antz.
Rather than blending seamlessly into the characters, the celebrity
voices leap to the forefront of your consciousness every time someone
speaks. (It's particularly distracting when The Voice Of God issues
forth, and, rather than being awe-struck, you're thinking, "Hey, isn't
that Val Kilmer...".)</P>
<P>The animation of The Prince of Egypt is nothing short of spectacular.
The special effects are appropriately awe-inspiring, but the film excels
at character detail as well.  If you're an animation enthusiast, the
quality here alone makes this film a must-see.</P>
<P>However, good animation aside, The Prince of Egypt can never quite shake
the mediciney feeling that this is animation which is supposed to be
"good-for-you"...both spiritually and visually. The film flows best when
it simply relaxes and lets the story unfold. However, there is a stiff
formality that hangs over several scenes of the movie.  It feels like
everyone involved tensed up at the same moment when they realized they
were doing something "important", and that translated on screen.</P>
<P>The Prince of Egypt has a big story to tell, and only 100 minutes in
which to tell it.  As a result, the story feels awfully rushed. Some
events are glossed over in montages, others (particularly the events
after the Red Sea) are mostly ignored.</P>
<P>Young children might get confused or frightened during some of the
film's more intense scenes (the plagues, for example).  But, for the
most part, the film is structured simply enough that kids should be able
to follow the story.  And though comic relief isn't stressed nearly as
highly as the standard Disney fare, there are some good humorous bits
here and there.</P>
<P>The flaws of The Prince of Egypt could be summed up by saying Dreamworks
was trying too hard.  The result is thoroughly watchable, and, at times,
technically brilliant, but a little stiff, awkward and rushed in places.</P>
