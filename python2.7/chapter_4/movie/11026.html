<PRE>SLIVER (1993)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *** (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Screenplay by Joe Eszterhas.  
Based on a novel by Ira Levin.  
Directed by Philip Noyce.  
Starring Sharon Stone, William Baldwin, Tom Berenger, Martin Landau.  
Unrated version (contains nudity, violence, and profanity)  108 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  Carly, a divorced, unhappy, 35-year-old book editor who must
work with intensely annoying, sex-starved Judy, moves into a dream
apartment where she meets an elderly, lonely professor and a has-been
novelist who likes to scare jogging women in Central Park.  Carly then
begins an affair with a young technogeek while a bunch of people are
murdered in the apartment building and someone watches it all with video
cameras.</P>
<P>Comments:  Three stars may be giving SLIVER a little more credit than it
deserves.  It's a big-budget turkey slammed by many critics when it was
first released, I won't deny.  Despite its many faults, however, SLIVER
does warrant a second look.</P>
<P>How do I come to that conclusion?  Though it is sometimes compared to REAR
WINDOW (and I do see the resemblance), SLIVER's plot still strikes me as
unique.  In fact, the interesting plot makes one want the movie to be
better than it really is.  I have never read a novel by Ira Levin (who
wrote the book from which this film is based), but Levin's work has
provided the basis for a number of classic science fiction and horror
movies over the years, most notably ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES
and its inevitable sequels.  SLIVER deals with a dark subject, voyeurism,
and the chilling possibilities open to a voyeur with developing
technologies.  Allow me to suggest, for a moment, something which I rarely
see suggested about SLIVER.  Yes, it is obviously an erotic thriller
(Sharon Stone strips naked frequently and makes out with William Baldwin
while a murderer runs around cancelling out his victims), but it is also a
science fiction film.  Good science fiction often takes a part (a sliver,
if you'll accept a bad pun) of modern day society and exaggerates it.  In
SLIVER, the apartment's owner secretly installs video cameras in every room
of the building for the express purpose of spying on his tenants.  Sitting
in an enclosed room, he watches over these people as if he were God.  Two
walls of television sets, a giant TV in the center, a computer console, and
a remote control make up the majority of his equipment, which apparently
set him back 6 million dollars.  He can zoom in and out on everyone, and
record anything which goes on.  This massive invasion of privacy is
frightening when thought about (imagine every moment in every day of your
life being secretly filmed), and it is here where a major motif of science
fiction resides: the dangers of emerging technologies put to unethical use.</P>
<P>The novelty of the storyline, however, does not excuse Joe Eszterhas's weak
screenplay.  SLIVER is riddled with poor dialogue.  Granted, poor dialogue
can sometimes be unintentionally funny, but in SLIVER's case, Eszterhas
tries to be clever and funny intentionally.  The lines, therefore, only end
up receiving groans from the audience.  Carly and another tenant discuss
moving in an early scene, for example, and the tenant says moving is "worse
than anal intercourse."  They share a chuckle.  The audience doesn't.  Or,
how about this for awful?  Judy, the most annoying coworker to ever stumble
into a movie (get down on your knees and *pray* you never have to work with
someone like Judy), suggests "Pearl Jam [is] some sort of oriental sex
thing."  Ugh!</P>
<P>Another criticism of SLIVER is that it moves too slowly during the first
half.  To be honest, I'm not sure if the screenwriter or the director is at
fault, or if the reason lies in the fact that I'm reviewing the unrated
version over the R-rated theatrical version (from my estimate, though, only
about a minute was added to the unrated version).  Carly's introductions to
the main characters feel contrived, and her "steamy" scenes both with Zeke
Hawkins (Baldwin) and without are drawn out much longer than they need to
be.  </P>
<P>For an erotic thriller, SLIVER possesses a very talented and experienced
cast of actors.  Sharon Stone ... well, she's Sharon Stone, and she
delivers what you'd expect to see after her career-making performance in
BASIC INSTINCT.  William Baldwin looks like a geeky freak, which is good
considering the sleazy character he plays, and he turns in a goofy but
enjoyable performance.  Veteran actors Tom Berenger and Martin Landau seem
to make the best out of their characters (they really aren't offered much
thanks to the script).</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this review without mentioning the music.  I don't
normally have much to say about a film's score or songs, but SLIVER
effectively uses a number of dance standards during several key sequences.
Most notably, Enigma's "Carly's Loneliness" and UB40's "Can't Help Falling
in Love" appear a number of times and serve as fitting themes for Carly and
Zeke respectively.</P>
<P>SLIVER certainly has its faults: a slow first half, bad dialogue, and, at
times, annoying characters (Judy, for instance).  However, a strong
concept, a mostly solid cast, and some well-chosen music almost saves it
from being a turkey and at least makes the film watchable.  The R-rated
version may flow a little quicker than the unrated version reviewed here (I
saw the R-rated version in the theater when it first came out, so it's been
way too long for me to confidently compare the two).  SLIVER also has one
of the more memorable endings to a thriller that I've ever seen, which is a
definate plus because I usually find the conclusions to thrillers cliched
and disappointing.  Some people I know who have seen this turkey hate it,
but I really don't think it's all *that* bad.  I'd give it a passing
recommendation, but keep in mind that it's certainly not family viewing.</P>
