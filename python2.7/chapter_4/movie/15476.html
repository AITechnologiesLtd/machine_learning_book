<P>REVIEW: Babe: Pig in the City
By Luke Buckmaster (<A HREF="mailto:bucky@alphalink.com.au">bucky@alphalink.com.au</A>)</P>
<P>Cast: Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mary Stein, Mickey Rooney, and
the voices of E.G. Daily, Gleanne Headly, Steven Wright, James Cosmo,
Stanley Ralph Ross, Danny Mann, Roscoe Lee Browne
Director: George Miller
Screenplay: George Miller, Mark Lamprell, Judy Morris based on "The
Sheep-Pig" by Dick King-Smith</P>
<P>Australian theatrical release date: December 10, 1998</P>
<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</P>
<P>The fundamental difference between 1995's surprise hit Babe and its
sequel, Pig in the City, is a change of tone.  Whilst Babe happily
indulged in occasional "serious" moments, Pig in the City often
surrounds itself in gloom, and its characters are forced to attempt to
emerge themselves through it.  That's quite a hard feat for a family
film to achieve without presenting its characters as equally somber as
their surroundings.  Achieving this much is something that director
George Miller (Mad Max, The Witches of Eastwick) can be proud of, at
least for the most part.</P>
<P>Miller adapted Babe from the novel written by Dick King-Smith (titled
The Sheep Pig), and does the same task for Pig in the City as well as
replacing director Chris Noonan.  He gives an unusual atmosphere to the
film, which is largely to do with the setting - "The Big City."  This is
one unusual place, with Venice like canals and a wide range of sights to
see - the Sydney opera house, the statue of liberty, the Eiffel tower
and the Hollywood sign.  Miller conveys that this fairytale city is not
located anywhere, so much as it is everywhere.</P>
<P>Pig in the City's story caps off directly after Babe's finishes.  Farmer
Hoggett (James Cromwell, who was Oscar nominated for his performance in
the original) and Babe (voice of E.G. Daily, replacing Christine
Cavanaugh) are local celebrities for their astonishing display in the
National Sheep Dog's Championship.  But unfortunately Hoggett takes a
bad fall down a well, thus making him unable to work. The farm soon
faces financial ruin, so Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski) plans to take
Babe to a state fair in search for enough money to save their home.
They end up stranded in The Big City, and stay at an eerie hotel for
pets.</P>
<P>Pig in the City is an ill-advised sequel.  Babe ended on a wonderfully
high note, pleasing audiences with scenes that were both artistic and
entertaining.  It was a rewarding tale brought to life largely from
Cromwell's performance and Babe's innocence.  Although the pig's
innocence is still very much a part of the sequel, Cromwell is severely
missed.  He was the sane center of the original; everyone acted crazy
around him.  This time Magda Szubanski is the lead human actor, but her
cheerful comic mannerisms are exaggerated to ridiculous lengths, and she
soon becomes more irritating than entertaining.</P>
<P>There is some truth behind the many allegations that Pig in the City is
too depressing and gloomy for children.  Some scenes - namely Farmer
Hoggett falling down the well and Babe saving animals from gruesome
deaths - are distressing to watch.  Although the underlining themes of
the film include friendship, determination and courage, it is only an
uplifting experience on very few occasions.  Pig in the City is
exhausting when it should be uplifting, and annoying when it should be
entertaining.</P>
<P>This is not to say that George Miller has not crafted some excellent
moments and characters.  Thelonius (voice of James Cosmo) is an old and
wise orangutan who always likes to be dressed for the moment.  He is
easily the most intriguing character, as every one of his movements and
words are emphasized by Miller, and the audience subsequently takes
notice. Thelonius is one of the few animals that gives a lasting impact,
and is able to burst out of his gloomy surroundings to create an
intriguing demeanor of his own.</P>
<P>Adults will appreciate the atmosphere that Miller creates more than
children will.  But as a family film, a sequel, and a candidate for this
holiday's box office trophy, Babe: Pig in the City simply doesn't bring
home the bacon.</P>
