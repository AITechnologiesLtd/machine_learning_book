<PRE>                                    SCHINDLER'S LIST
                       A film review by John Locke
                        Copyright 1994 John Locke</PRE>
<P>     This film has gotten plenty of praise, some of it deserved.  Here's
another side.</P>
<P>     The fundamental problem is that the stories of thousands (or
millions) of people are very appropriate to documentary filmmaking, but
not to dramatic filmmaking.  It's the intimate knowledge of a few
characters that makes empathy personal and not intellectual.
SCHINDLER'S LIST gives us an intimate look at a few characters but
there are problems with all of these.</P>
<P>     First, Schindler himself.  He is not a Jew or a prisoner, so from
a historical perspective, he is not a central character in the
holocaust, merely an interesting sidelight.  The choice of putting him
at the center of the story reminds me of films like SALVADOR, where
El Salvador's history is reduced to the experiences in an American
journalist's life, or CRY FREEDOM! which is a biography of Stephen
Biko, but makes a white journalist the central character.  In all
cases, I think the technique is a cop-out to market forces--the largest
percentile of the audience is given a character they are more likely to
relate to culturally.  It is not simply a matter--with SCHINDLER'S
LIST--of choosing to tell the Schindler story.  A Jew could have been
central while Schindler was made subsidiary.  The holocaust could have
been the foreground and Schindler's factory the background, rather than
the other way around.</P>
<P>     (A television movie, PLAYING FOR TIME, makes better artistic
choices in how the holocaust is portrayed.  First, the characters are
prisoners and central to the event.  At the same time, their
recruitment into a camp orchestra gives them a plausible reason for
staying around longer than the average prisoner, and experiencing the
camp both as a prisoner and with the broader perspective of a long-term
inmate.)</P>
<P>     So who are the central Jewish characters?  Stern, the factory
accountant, is the main one.  But he has a disembodied life--no
background we know of, no family, no passions.  He gives up little of
himself and hence engenders too little sympathy.  Worse still, he is
spared from the horrors of the holocaust, other than witnessing them.
So he is not at the heart of the matter.  How about the camp
commandant's Jewish housekeeper.  She is closer but, yet, she rarely
speaks so we never get to know her except as She Who Suffers in
Silence.  After her, it's all cameos: the woman engineer who wants to
make a good barracks, the hinge-maker, the worker who wants to thank
Schindler, etc.  These characters come on to illustrate individual
points and then leave, but we never know them as individuals.  After
them, there are simply masses of people running around with rabbit-like
fear.</P>
<P>     The lack of strong developed Jewish characters, ironically, tends
to makes us think more like the guards of the prisoners than their
saviors.  A guard may be shocked at first by the violence he witnesses
but becomes used to it because he doesn't know the people and they are
never allowed to speak and become human.  It's knowing enough about the
characters to care about them as individuals that prevents us from
seeing them as unfortunate sheep.</P>
<P>     Sadly, the most vivid character is the psychopathic commandant.
He is so outrageous and unpredictable he steals all the scenes he is
in.  What crazy thing will this lunatic do next?  Is he central to the
holocaust?  Yes, in a perverse way, but I think we would all agree that
the major theme of the holocaust is suffering, not sadism.</P>
<P>     For anyone who has seen documentaries or photographs of the
holocaust, the visual impact of the film is greatly diminished.
SCHINDLER'S LIST is a grim tour through a holocaust museum, but without
the insights of empathetic characters, it doesn't go far enough beyond
the historical record.</P>
<P>     Putting all that aside, Schindler *is* an interesting character,
but in a subtle way.  His behavior doesn't really change over the
course of the film--he starts off running a factory and ends up
running a factory.  It's his motivations, his reasons for running a
factory that change, and the change takes place over a protracted
period.  That should be enough, but subtlety is apparently anathema to
Spielberg.  He can't resist tacking on an emotional wallop to the end
of the story, wherein Schindler breaks down pitifully in regrets that
he couldn't have saved one more Jew with the sale of some jewelry or
ten more with the sale of his car.  It's an outrageous sob sell-out on
Spielberg's part.  Schindler's breakdown lacks common sense--he's
already done so much obvious good.  The breakdown doesn't appear to be
in character at all.  Furthermore, it's not plausible that Schindler
even thinks that way--he's an entrepreneur, not an accountant; he
thinks on a grander scale rather than a smaller. (Note that the
breakdown is Spielberg's invention; it's not in the book.)</P>
<P>     Still, it's an interesting film, better than most.  It will garner
many awards, as much for its intentions as its artistry.  I give it a
$5.50 out of $7.00.</P>
