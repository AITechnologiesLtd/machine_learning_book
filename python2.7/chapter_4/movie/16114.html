<P>   Hamlet contemplates suicide but gives pause when he
questions "what dreams may come when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil."  For him, the Long Sleep might not end "the
heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir
to."  What happens when the decision to live does not solve
the problem--when the ills we bear include the most dreadful
nightmares that flow on unceasingly?  Claire Cooper (Annette
Bening) faces this plight in Neil Jordan's Hitchcockian, adult
horror tale, "In Dreams," a piece that is edited (by Tony
Lawson) is such an abrupt and choppy style that the
audience cannot avoid being bewildered by the narrative line.
Strange to say, this disjointed mess was directed by a man
whose credits include the sensational "The Butcher Boy."</P>
<P>   "In Dreams" borrows from the usual conventions of the
horror tale--the individual with psychic powers, the concerned
spouse, disbelieving authorities, the deranged killer whose
loneliness leads him to serial murder.  Writer-director Jordan
winnows a measure of innovation but lets it float away like
the detritus of a flood which destroys his New England town
during the 1960s.  The screenplay, which borders on
incoherence, occasionally draws inappropriate laughter from
the audience.  Still, Annette Bening's fleshed-out performance
dares to give some integrity to the film, as she carries
virtually the full load of the fable in the role of a woman
whose recurring nightmares cause disbelief from the police,
skepticism from the medical profession, and an unhealthy
instability to her marriage.</P>
<P>   The fragmented nature of the film begins with the opening
scene, with its images of divers searching the wreckage of a
village which had been evacuated, rendered into a ghost
town by a flood which buried everything in its path.  Neil
Jordan cuts to a present-day vista, a spacious New England
home at the foot of a forest, unnecessarily concealing its
connection to the flood until midway into the movie.  Until
then we wonder whether he has patched together two
altogether distinct tales whose only commonality is its
Massachusetts whereabouts.</P>
<P>   The camera hones in on Claire Cooper whose idyllic life as
the wife of 747 pilot Paul (Aidan Quinn) and loving
relationship with her nine-year-old daughter Rebecca (Katie
Sagona) are sullied by a succession of disturbing dreams. 
She observes an innocent little girl walking hand-in-hand to
an unknown destination with a man whose intentions appear
to Claire to be malevolent.  Her husband, who is home only
sporadically between flights to Australia and other parts, is
annoyed with Claire's obsessiveness, complains that she is
"not there" when he returns, and who feels justified in having
a near-affair a woman he has met Down Under.  As Claire's
recurrent nightmares convince her that her daughter is in
mortal danger and that some lunatic killer is feeding her his
own fantasies, she goes off the deep end, and is hospitalized.
Soon she receives counseling from an incredulous
neurosurgeon, Dr. Stevens (Dennis Boutskikaris), a
psychiatrist, Dr. Silverman (Stephen Rea), and police
detective Jack Kay (Paul Guilfoyle).  The diabolical killer
Vivian Thompson, a character perhaps inspired by Alfred
Hitchcock's Norman Bates, does not appear until the final
one-third of the film, giving cinematographer Darius Khondji
the chance to portray some startling images of hospital
rooms, foggy groves, and a haunted house, as Claire
migrates through a sequence of nightmares so steadily that
we scarcely know when she is awake and when she is
unanchored.</P>
<P>   If Bruce Robinson and Neil Jordan's screenplay were as
carefully structured as the movie's visuals are astonishing, "In
Dreams" would have been that rare find: a genuinely adult
contribution to the genre of horror now dominated by
adolescent piffles like "I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer."  Bening's performance as a woman driven to
psychosis by a madman's exploits and Robert Downey Jr.'s
achievement as a Norman Bates without that psychopath's
charming, other self would have carried the show.  But
Rosco, a burly nurse whose job consists primarily in
restraining raving patients at the psychiatric facility, mirrors
the feelings of the audience. When the authorities explain the
whole situation to him, he looks puzzled and replies, "I'm
lost."</P>
