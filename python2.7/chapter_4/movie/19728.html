<P>Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams</P>
<P>It's a curious thing - I've found that when Willis is not
called on to carry the whole movie, he's much better and so is the
movie. Even though, in The Sixth Sense he is the "name", he doesn't
have the pivotal role. That honour goes to Haley Osment who plays Cole
Sear (cute pun, Seer) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts. If Osment
was cute or precious, the director going for the maudlin, this would
be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week, thankfully, Osment is not
only better than that, but in some instances, blows everyone else off
the screen in a bravura performance. We get to see his fears,
vulnerabilities, strengths and intelligence which makes The Sixth
Sense one of the best movies I've seen this year. The whole cast
matches him in quality, with Willis giving a fairly low key
performance that matches the subject matter.</P>
<P>One thing about this movie, its target. This isn't a sfxfest like
the Haunting or a gorefest, this is more what I'd call a
Supernatural Drama, more interested in characters than in dazzling you
with makeup.</P>
<P>One caveat: there's a lovely twist in the movie, something like the
Usual Suspects, where you end up replaying the movie in your head
rethinking what you have just seen. I was extremely lucky to see it as
a sneak preview in Toronto, before any hype or critical reviews were
out, so I went in with no biases. If anyone want to talk to about the
movie before you see it, DON'T let them. Let the director explain
on his own pace and you'll enjoy the movie vastly more.</P>
