<P>   The recent torture-murder of Matthew Shepard simply
because the young man was gay helps give "American
History X" a particular timeliness.  But then, hatred and
bigotry have always caused the acting-out of humankind's
worst side in most societies.  "American History X" deals on
the nefarious activiites of a gang of such haters known as
skinheads, focusing intensely on Derek (Edward Norton), a
confirmed neo-Nazi, and the powerful impact he has on the
thought and behavior of his kid brother Danny (Edward
Furlong).  Because the two young men are exceptionally
bright and articulate, they are all the more dangerous and
ultimately self-destructive.  While the movie condemns the
fascist behavior of a group of white kids, largely losers, it lays
out blame among other ethnic groups as well.  Nor does
David McKenna, who composed the screenplay for this taut,
tension-filled and violent picture, summarily dismiss some of
the arguments that the skins use for their activities, points of
view held by people of reason and non-violence as well as
those on the outer fringes of society.</P>
<P>   Employing color in the scenes depicting present-day
activities and black-and-white photography for flashbacks
narrated by young Danny, director Tony Kaye uses the
device of a conference between Danny and his high-school
principal, Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks), to lead into the tale. 
Called on the carpet for turning in a paper essentially praising
the ideas in "Mein Kampf," Danny is ordered by the school's
leader to write a composition overnight about the source of
his ideas.  As Danny pecks into his computer a tale of
danger, intrigue, and the politics of gangs, Kaye turns up the
flames to show the source of hatred which prompts Derek to
tattoo a swastika across his chest as a vivid symbol of his
extremist ideology.  Derek's dad, a fireman, had been
murdered in the course of duty by a gang member, pushing
Derek politically into a right-wing fringe group.  He develops a
simplistic and unoriginal philosophy blaming immigrants and
minorities for what he calls a deterioration of American
values.  After killing two young black men who are stealing
his car, one with exceptional brutality, he serves three years
in jail, which gives him the opportunity to rethink his ideas. 
When he returns to society, his hair has grown back and he
has done an about face, trying to persuade the brother who
loves and worships him to reverse his thinking as well.  </P>
<P>   While the transformation from hater to a virtual liberal is far
from convincing given the situations he finds himself in while
incarcerated, the story itself is gutsy, refusing to shrink from a
wholesale baring of some of the common, simplistic
contentions that Americans have locked into even before the
days of the Salem Witch trials.  Because the movie was
conspicuously re-edited to emphasize the ferocity of the
contending groups, director Tony Kaye has dissociated his
name from the movie.  Despite the attempts to inflate an
already highly controversial subject through pumped-up
music, muscular close-ups, and the portrayal of skinhead as
even stupider than their severest critics maintain, a robust
performance by the talented, multi-dimensional Edward
Norton keeps the audience juices flowing.  Guy Torry
supplies much of the scant humor of the film in the role of
Lamont, a black man who has been assigned to work
together in prison with Derek and who, through his sense of
waggery and kindly disposition can be considered the catalyst
for the charismatic fascist's evolution.</P>
