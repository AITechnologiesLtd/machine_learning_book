<P>The most frustrating movies to sit through aren't the ones that are bad
through and through; those you can usually spot early on and leave before
wasting too much time on them. The real killers are the films that have just
enough clever ideas or funny lines to keep you in your seat, hoping against
hope that some kind of knockout ending is going to make your investment of
time and money worthwhile.
 So it goes with "Urban Legend," which tosses in a few exciting moments, a
handful of snappy jokes and a potentially solid set-up only to self-destruct
in its excruiating last half-hour. Desperate to devise a finale sure to
stun, writer Silvio Horta concocts several and runs them back to back. The
result drove a sneak preview audience to scream alright, first in gales of
disbelieving laughter and then for their money back.
 "Urban Legend" is constructed around those deathless stories that somehow
circulate through every community. Everybody knows about the babysitter who
realized too late that the threatening phone calls she was getting were
coming from inside the house, or about how washing down Pop Rocks with soda
will make your stomach explode, and similar pop mythology.
 In Horta's script, a serial killer has decided to recreate these tales of
terror in and around Pendleton College, recently named "the safest campus in
America" by no less than U.S. News and World Report. So, for example, when a
young woman fails to check the backseat of her truck before cruising down
the road, singing along to Bonnie Tyler's "Total Eclipse of the Heart," the
line "every now and then I fall apart" takes on a whole new meaning.
 This recent burst of coed carnage coincides with the 25th anniversary of
Pendleton's fabled "Stanley Hall massacre," in which a knife-wielding maniac
went from room to room slaying dorm residents. The only survivor was
Professor Wexler (Robert Englund, re-establishing his credentials as an
actor with a capital "h") who now teaches a popular class on urban legends.
Could he secretly be doing some unauthorized first-hand research into his
subject matter?
 Maybe and maybe not. Red herrings abound in "Urban Legend." They're almost
as plentiful as director Jamie Blanks' use of the old
turn-around-and-bump-into-something-and-scream cliche, which loses its shock
value in this film somewhere around the middle of the second reel.
 The real horror lies in the performances of such generally reliable types
as Jared Leto and Alicia Witt, both of whom spend most of the movie
slack-jawed and trying hard to look frightened. They definitely have their
work cut out for them by the time Horta drops his final bomb, revealing the
maniac behind the murders. It's one thing to ask viewers to suspend their
disbelief, Mr. Horta, and quite another to heave all logic out the nearest
open window.
 A few intentional laughs are provided by Joshua Jackson (that makes James
van der Beek the only "Dawson's Creek" lead not to have starred in a horror
movie this year) and particularly by Loretta Devine as a security officer
who spends her spare time worshipping blaxploitation queen Pam Grier.
There's also a Noxema commercial joke to hint at the past (and future)
career of the utterly talentless ex-model Rebecca Gayheart, whose feeble
thesping as Witt's best friend makes one long for the days of talents like
Shelley Hack and Maud Adams.
