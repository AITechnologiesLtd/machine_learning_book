Bean (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 47</PRE>
<P>"Bean" is a comedy based upon the British television series
"Mr. Bean", which is familiar to American viewers due to runs
on PBS stations.  Rowan Atkinson is Bean, sort of a British
version of Pee Wee Herman, who makes goofy faces, mumbles
when it is a possible alternative to speaking, and conducts
experiments with people or physical objects around him
that usually end in disaster.</P>
<P>Bean is employed by a British museum.  He is regarded as
a useless and is relegated to sitting in a chair in a
corner, where he can do harm as long as he remains there.
To be rid of him, even temporarily, he is sent to 
a Los Angeles museum to preside over the ceremony of
that museum acquiring a priceless work of art.</P>
<P>Unlucky museum curator Peter MacNicol draws the assignment
of hosting Bean during his visit.  Out of his element, Bean 
gets into increasing trouble.  His inability to socially
interact with others alienates MacNicol's family, which
promptly moves out.  MacNicol soon has even worse fears
of unemployment and imprisonment, all due to Bean's
eccentric and destructive antics.</P>
<P>The movie is different from the series.  In the series, people
regard Bean as mostly normal.  In the movie, Bean, the exact 
same character, is regarded as bizarre, alien, and dangerous, 
and not merely eccentric.  This interesing tack would leave
us feeling sorry for Bean, if his behaviour would only deserve
such sympathy.  But heavens, he practically needs to be
institutionalized!</P>
<P>Although "Bean" is by no means a bad movie, it does have some
problems.  I can accept Bean's character, but not MacNicol's
bonding to this obvious destructive idiot who seems bent
on destroying his life.  I don't understand how Bean could
be left alone in a room with a priceless painting.  And Bean,
who is demonstrated to be incompetent in the first half of
the film, performs complex and heroic actions in the second
half that he seems nowhere capable of in the first half.</P>
<P>I don't like the character of MacNichol's daughter (Tricia Vessey).
What a brat!  Burt Reynolds has a cameo as a General.  His
character has some stupid lines, and he constantly has a smirk 
on his face (perhaps he is thinking of his paycheck for probably
one day's work).</P>
<P>Still, if you a fan of the "Mr. Bean" show, you will probably
enjoy the movie.  You may alternately laugh and groan as
Bean gets into trouble.  At ninety minutes, the film is the
proper length and doesn't drag often.</P>
