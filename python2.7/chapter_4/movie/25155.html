<P>Year: 2000. Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, 
Joan Plowright, Ossie Davis, Max Casella, Alfre Woodard, Samuel E. 
Wright, Peter Siragusa, Della Reese. Story by Thom Enriquez, John 
Harrison, Robert Nelson Jacobs, Ralph Zondag. Screenplay by Walon Green 
(original), John Harrison, and Robert Nelson Jacobs. Directed by Eric 
Leighton and Ralph Zondag. Rated PG.</P>
<P>"Dinosaur" is a great technical accomplishment. It's one of the 
best-looking movies I've ever seen. Every prehistoric creature is 
rendered in astonishingly convincing fashion, the backgrounds are lush 
and detailed (sometimes real-life locations into which the animated 
characters are placed), and the whole thing filled with crisp, colorful 
visuals. The first 15 minutes feature a breathtaking sequence in which a 
mother Iguanadon nests her eggs, only to lose them when a giant predator 
attacks. The egg is picked up by a Pterodactyl and deposited on a nearby 
island. All of "Dinosaur's" brilliance as a sensory experience is on 
display during this opening sequence. Then all potential for an 
original, innovative work gets tossed out the window when a little 
lemur-like creature opens its mouth and starts talking, in English, to 
its little lemur children, who also speak in English. Oh well.</P>
<P>It would be more honest, however, to say that the primary failure of 
"Dinosaur" is not, as some critics have suggested, that the dinosaurs 
talk. Nor is it that the film's plot is formulaic, though such an 
observation would certainly be true: The plot deals with an orphaned 
dinosaur named Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney), who is raised in the care 
of small mammals on a solitary island. A firestorm destroys Aladar's 
home, and after he and his adoptive lemur family narrowly escape the 
ordeal, they are forced to hook up with a group of migrating dinosaurs 
searching for the fabled "mating grounds," presumably an oasis in the 
hostile terrain. The dinosaurs are lead by Kron (Samuel E. Wright), a 
gruff Darwinist bent on following the "survival of the fittest" mantra 
to the death: He leaves all old or injured animals to fare for 
themselves, pushing only the able-bodied ones endlessly onward. Aladar, 
already having rubbed Kron the wrong way by sticking up for some older 
dinosaurs, runs afoul of the troop's gruff leader even more by taking a 
liking to his younger sister Neera (Julianna Margulies).</P>
<P>Sounds like many a Disney plot, doesn't it? In fact, the setup of the 
outcast looking for acceptance from his peers sounds alarmingly similar 
to that of "Tarzan," Disney's last animated feature. But previous Disney 
films have been enjoyable despite their predictability, so complaints 
about a formulaic plot seem somewhat wrong-headed. Likewise complaints 
about talking animals don't really get to the heart of "Dinosaur's" 
problem. The enjoyability of a Disney film stems not from its daring, 
ground-breaking originality, but from the "little things." You enjoy 
them because they tell a recognizable story in pleasing fashion, with 
amusing elements to spice up the proceedings. They have catchy songs 
("Beauty and the Beast", "The Little Mermaid"), exuberant voice work 
(Robin Williams in "Aladdin", James Woods in "Hercules"), or 
breathtaking action sequences ("The Lion King", "Tarzan"). "Dinosaur," 
unfortunately, is severely lacking in the little things. There are no 
catchy songs (not necessarily a bad thing, as the quality of songwriting 
had gradually declined as the years passed -- the songs in "Mulan" 
weren't memorable at all). None of the celebrity voices provide much 
distinction: You don't say, "Omigod! Julianna Margulies did such 
wonderful voice work!" You say, "Oh! That was Julianna Margulies?" The 
characters just come off as old Disney archetypes thrown into reptilian 
forms, and none of the humor is fresh or witty, unless one finds the 
term "jerkasaurus" absolutely hilarious. Some of the action sequences 
are exciting: A battle sequence between Aladar and some Carnataurs (a 
species invented for the film for reasons I've yet to discover) in a 
cave provides some excitement, and the aforementioned opening egg 
journey is quite breathtaking. But none of the scenes come as a natural 
continuation of what's occurred before them, and as a result, the story 
simply doesn't flow.</P>
<P>And that's the other big problem with "Dinosaur": It's okay in bits, but 
it doesn't cohere, doesn't involve the viewer. Most discoveries come out 
of nowhere. There is no catharsis when Aladar inevitably takes his place 
at the head of the herd, or when the nesting grounds are found. There is 
no urgency to the story. The herd marches towards something that they 
want to find tomorrow, but it doesn't make much difference if they don't 
find it until next week. Character arc is zero: The principle characters 
-- Aladar, Neera, Kron, and the lemurs -- don't much change at all from 
beginning to end. But the film's worst sin, again, is its complete and 
utter lack of flow. "Dinosaur's" structure is a strict cut-and-paste 
job, with pieces borrowed from earlier Disney films that worked their 
formulas to more pleasing effect.</P>
<P>So the story has no punch, the characters are bland, and the film 
contains almost no lively musical numbers, witty comic relief, or 
standout vocal characterization. What then can the audience enjoy but 
the visuals? And, to be fair, "Dinosaur" almost gets by solely on those 
merits. It's easy to conceive someone liking the film as nothing more 
than a sheer sensory experience (as I almost did). As a technical 
achievement, "Dinosaur" is stunning. As a movie, it's dull. For all its 
impressive wizardry, Disney's latest effort mostly comes off as a 
visually spectacular lesson in how not to tell a story.</P>
