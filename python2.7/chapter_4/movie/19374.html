<PRE>Lake Placid
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4) Lake Placid is a bad movie. But for a bad movie, it's
pretty fun. It has a good cast and it's "over the top." What else could
you call a movie featuring a wild animal death match between a crocodile
and a bear? (Okay, maybe Discovery Channel: The Movie.)</P>
<P>Lake Placid comes from a long line of ferocious animal movies with
titles like Tarantula! and Piranha! Its ancestors never rose very high
on the movie food chain, and Lake Placid doesn't rise any higher. It is
unmistakably a b-movie.</P>
<P>The ferocious animal in this movie is a gigantic crocodile and he's now
in Maine. Nobody knows how he got here, but there you have it. The first
sign of his presence is the disappearance of a few people from Black
Lake -- that plus the exaggerated, dark, symphonic soundtrack telling
you when to jump. Now, some people are starting to investigate.</P>
<P>Four people ultimately converge on the lake to investigate the mystery:
the local sheriff (Brendan Gleeson, fresh off his tour de force in The
General), a rep from Fish and Wildlife (Bill Pullman), a New York museum
paleontologist (Bridget Fonda), and a comically-eccentric, independently
wealthy, only-exists-in-the-movies, mythology professor (yes, mythology)
played by one of my favorite actors, Oliver Platt.</P>
<P>Leaving the monster aside, Pullman and Fonda were supposed to be the
love interest. Kelly (Fonda) had been dumped by her boss/boyfriend who
sent her to Black Lake ostensibly to look at the tooth from a recent
autopsy -- but really so that the boss can be alone with his new
girlfriend. Jack (Pullman) is a lonely man, just waiting for the right
girl to come along. The plot suggests that they were supposed to have
some chemistry, but there was never any spark between them. They were
one of the flattest screen "couples" in a long time.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there was some great chemistry between the professor
(Platt) and the sheriff (Gleeson). No, it was not sexual chemistry, it's
just that they had the most interesting relationship in the movie. The
sheriff was starting to get fed up with all the visitors to the lake.
Inevitably, they would end up in his boat, and inevitably they would
make all kinds of smart remarks to him.</P>
<P>The professor is just such a person, but three times as annoying.</P>
<P>Platt and Gleeson saw an opportunity to make their badly written
characters into something more interesting. They fed off each other and
escalated their little tiffs into show-stealing performances. Their
arguments were the best thing in the movie. I am sure their electric
relationship was completely unplanned and entirely to the credit of
these two very good actors. I wouldn't say they saved the movie -- it
was still pretty bad -- but they certainly made it more enjoyable.</P>
<P>In contrast, the comic relief was supposed to come from Betty White
playing Dolores. Dolores lives at the lake and takes care of the croc.
It is supposed to be funny that she cusses, swears, and feeds the beast
meat. Actually, it was kind of funny that she would take care of the
croc, but to have sweet old White swearing like a sailor just revealed
how uninspired and desperate David E. Kelley (the screenwriter) and
Miner were.</P>
<P>As for the movie's main character (the crocodile), he was almost
entirely rendered on a computer. For the most part, he was convincing
and was often worth marveling at. The image of a huge crocodile
advancing on a truckload of people was pretty tense, and surprisingly
believable. And when the thing moved, he had the look and feel of a real
reptile, not some computer-generated "reptile" formula.</P>
<P>So even though I know how bad this movie really is, I have to say I had
some fun. Still, I cannot in good conscience recommend it. It really is
a b-movie. The plot is pure formula, the lead characters were flat, and
the whole thing just crumbles under scrutiny. If you go, take your
lowest expectations and you might have some fun.</P>
