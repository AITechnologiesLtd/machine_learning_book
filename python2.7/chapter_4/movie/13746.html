<P>I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932)</P>
<PRE>Grade: 61</PRE>
<P>"I Am a Fugitive" is an action-packed, sensationalist
film that succeeds in conveying a mood of urgency and
desperation.  While entertaining, and effective at
depicting the terror of (some) prison work camps,
the direction is too campy and excited, and the film
loses credibility along the way.</P>
<P>Paul Muni is a war hero and factory laborer who
quits his dull job to seek construction work.  Unable
to get another job, he becomes a flophouse bum.
Forced into participating in a holdup, he is captured
and sentenced to ten years in a Georgia chain gang.
The inmates are given bad food, beaten cruelly, and
forced to labor throughout the day without breaks.</P>
<P>Muni manages to escape, flees to Chicago, and builds
a new life for himself.  However, he is blackmailed into
marriage by a good-for-nothing (Glenda Farrell) who
knows his secret.  When he decides to dump Farrell
for perfect woman Helen Vinson, Farrell informs.
Rather than fighting extradition, Muni stupidly agrees
to return to Georgia, and is again put to work in
a miserable prison camp.</P>
<P>"I Am a Fugitive" was based on the 1932 novel by
Robert E. Burns, apparently rushed to the screen.
Director Mervyn LeRoy could crank them out in a hurry.
The IMDB credits him with 22 films during the years
1930 through 1933, most notably "Little Caesar" from
1930.</P>
<P>"I Am a Fugitive" drew nominations for Best Picture
and Best Actor (Muni).  Muni's gives a hammy and excited
performance, undoubtedly prompted by the director.
Muni's closing line, "I steal!", intended to shock the
audience, is actually humorous instead.</P>
