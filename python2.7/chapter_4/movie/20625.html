<P>Ziad Doueiri is best known in the U.S. for being the cameraman for
Quentin Tarantino's films. But there is a story behind every person
(even in Hollywood). Doueiri has used his filmmaking experience to
bring his true childhood experiences to the screen in the poignant
"West Beirut". The film takes place in Beirut, Lebanon in 1975, where
a civil war is breaking out. For Tarek (Rami Doueiri) and Omar
(Mohamad Chamas), the cancellation of school brings a newfound
freedom.  They roam the streets of the war-torn city, making Super 8
films and generally causing mischief. The kids don't realize the
seriousness of the war, which has separated their city into two
sections; East (Christian) and West (Muslim) Beirut. Doueiri also
focuses on the tensions surrounding Tarek's parents. His father
(Joseph Bou Nassar) has faith in Beirut and will not leave, while his
mother (Carmen Lebbos) is overcome with tension and stays only because
she seems to have no choice.  For most of its 105 minute running time,
"West Beirut" is a vivid, involving slice of life showing us a city in
turmoil. However, in the final third of the film, the lack of a clear
plot undermines the realism, and the characters find themselves in
far-fetched situations. I would rather have had Doueiri let the story
tell itself. In the press notes, Doueiri remarks that he made the film
from memory of certain images, and not from memory of a story. But the
images are definitely there, and "West Beirut" is at times very
moving. The story behind the film is just as interesting as the film
itself. For the child actors, Doueiri chose his brother, Rami, to play
his alter-ego, and chose Mohamad Chamas, a penniless orphan, to play
his childhood friend. Chamas now lives in a shack in a Beirut refugee
camp. His only close relative, a brother, is in jail. The images in
"West Beirut" are therefore very real.  Ziad Doueri's debut film is
flawed, but it is a coming-of-age picture made with care and
relevance. In the early 1980's, Doueiri fled Lebanon and went to USC
Film School. Others will never be that lucky, and this film is for
them.</P>
