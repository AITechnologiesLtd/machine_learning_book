<PRE>                              REMEMBER THE TITANS
                          A film review by Bradley Null
                           Copyright 2000 Bradley Null</PRE>
<P>     Here's the pitch:  Take an emotional drama about the racial
conflict concerning the integration of a black high school and a white
one in the South.  Then wrap the entire plot around a hard-nosed high
school football coach (Washington) with an unorthodox style but an
uncanny ability to get the most out of his players.  As an added little
twist in this case, the old white head coach (Patton) stays on as an
assistant so we can play with a fair amount of racial conflict and power
struggle as these two egos collide, and ultimately generate a little
more emotion as they become friends.</P>
<P>     The last bit aside, we've all seen this movie a couple of times
before, so we know what to expect from the feel-good sentiment.  To be
sure, a lot of bigoted white folks are going to do a lot of mean things
until they slowly start to understand that we are all the same on the
inside.  And a bunch of jaded and underachieving high school athletes
will slowly learn what it is their coach is trying to teach them about
becoming men and champions.  Throw in the fat kid from the wrong side of
the tracks who finds his inspiration and a little pride along the way,
and we've got the most heartwarming film ever made.</P>
<P>     The only trouble with this concoction is that in trying to
concurrently satisfy these two very demanding genres -- sports story and
racial drama -- director Boaz Yakin and producers Jerry Bruckheimer and
Chad Oman felt compelled to include the same stock scenes that we've
seen before in both of these genres.  The townspeople rise up against
the outsider coach, the players who struggled under him at first come to
respect him, the white man finally realizes that he and his black
counterpart aren't that different, and of course, there's the
ever-popular brick-through-the-window of the new black family in the
neighborhood.  Of course, the filmmakers ride these powerful scenes for
all of the emotion they've got.  But ultimately, this continuous
stringing along of genre conventions weighs the film down, preventing
the filmmakers from bringing any really new elements to the table.</P>
<P>     Remember the Titans is based on a true story.  And thankfully so. 
If it weren't for that fact, audiences probably wouldn't buy all of
Yakin and Bruckheimer's string pulling.  As it turns out, even though
Bruckheimer, the action producer with the touch of gold, would seem
unqualified for this picture, these two manage to mine the emotional for
it's worth.  As it turns out, genre cliches turn out to be the most
powerful elements of the film, alongside the force of nature that is
Denzel Washington.  In particular, the emotional scenes of the team
coming together on the football field prove the most effective.  (If you
don't know much about football, you can identify these scenes by the
fact that they usually follow an impassioned speech by one or another
player or coach, and are always backed by an emotional rock or R&B hit
of the 60's or 70's.)</P>
<P>     Ironically, the occasions when the filmmakers aren't following
genre conventions (in the film's rare opportunities for originality) are
the times when the film tends to flounder the worst.  Most notably, the
subplot about a sexually ambiguous surfer-boy from California is simply
awkward and dilutes from tension at the heart of the story.  Also, the
decision to bookend the film with a funeral sequence from ten years
later is stupid and pointless.  It was unnecessary and overbearing in
films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, but here it is simply a
waste of the audience's time and attention.  You actually find yourself
wondering who is going to die and how that will tie in to the plot, only
to find out in the end that it doesn't tie in at all.</P>
<P>     All in all, the movie is very consistent if not overpowering. 
You've seen it all before, but the competent repackaging will manage to
tug at your heart strings anyway.  We're all suckers like that, I
guess.  And Jerry Bruckheimer knows it better than anyone.</P>
