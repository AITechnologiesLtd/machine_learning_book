<PRE>                         THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     I'll preface this review with the disclaimer that I am indeed aware
that James Bond thrillers do not bear any semblance to real-life
scenarios.  I'll also say that since I was a kid I've been a huge Bond
fan.</P>
<P>     And I'll also say that THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is one of the worst
Bond films to come along in years.</P>
<P>     What's to fault?  Look no further than the story, the product of
five screenwriters who appear to have reported to a committee that
mandated no fewer than one bad pun every two minutes.  As a script, it's
a patchy mess of scenes largely lifted from any number of other Bond
flicks, while at the same time feeling like a complete anachronism in
relation to the rest of the series.</P>
<P>     How silly is the story?  James Bond (Brosnan) is... drum roll,
please... a bodyguard for an oil magnate's daughter (Marceau).  Sounds
like a job for the British Secret Service, doesn't it?  What a film like
this needs is a good villain, and we get Renard (Carlyle), who has a
bullet lodged in his brain and has lost his sense of touch (and can't
feel pain).</P>
<P>     Cool idea, only it turns out Renard is the biggest wuss of all in
the pantheon of Bond villains.  Punch him in the stomach, and he
crumples like a daisy.  Where is Jaws when you need him?</P>
<P>     The rest of the film is just as worthless.  Denise Richards is the
least credible nuclear physicist I can imagine, Marceau tries to vamp
her way through the film and is inexplicably dressed in a robe in almost
every scene, Brosnan looks alternately tired and bored, and whole chunks
of plot appear to have been hastily excised at the last minute.</P>
<P>     But the worst failing of the film is that, despite lavish
production values and intricately staged action scenes, the `action' is
amazingly lacking.  I hate to say it, but the lifeless score is largely
at fault for this, never rising to the fevered pitch that the classics
of the series could do.  Ultimately, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH will be
forgotten quickly, adding nothing to the Bond mythology, and making one
long for the dramatic stylings of past 007s.</P>
