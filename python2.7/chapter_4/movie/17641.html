<PRE>The Innocents (1961)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 87</PRE>
<P>"The Innocents" is an excellent ghost story, set
in Victorian-era England.  The script, based on the
Henry James novel 'The Turn of the Screw', is first
rate, as is the direction and casting.  Child actors
Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin give performances
far better than could be expected, and the plot has
much drama and suspense.</P>
<P>The story has indifferent playboy Michael Redgrave
hiring first-time governess Deborah Kerr to care for
his orphaned cousins Flora (Franklin) and Miles (Stephens).
Upon arrival at the large, wealthy estate and mansion,
Kerr finds the children to be both happy and friendly.
But she is troubled by what she considers to be
sinister aspects to their personalities.</P>
<P>Kerr is startled but not intimidated by apparitions.
These ghosts resemble descriptions by housekeeper
Megs Jenkins of the former governess and valet, who
had a twisted affair and died violently.  Kerr believes
that these evil spirits are possessing the souls of the
children, and takes upon herself the task of exorcising
them.</P>
<P>Screenwriters William Archibald and Truman Capote no
doubt enjoyed adding creepy touches to the children's
dialogue (e.g. Flora delightedly tells Kerr: "Look!
A spider is eating a butterfly!") and in making the
ever-saintly Kerr appear to be losing her sanity.</P>
<P>Kerr's lack of assurance in the film's early stages
doesn't jive with her later strong will to confront
the spirits.  Jenkins' character concedes the children's
possession but disagrees with Kerr's confrontational
methods for helping them.</P>
<P>"The Innocents" was unjustly ignored by Oscar, but it was
awarded Best British Film by the British Academy Awards.</P>
