<P>_3000_Miles_to_Graceland_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Kurt Russell.  Kevin Costner.  Courteney Cox.  David Arquette. 
Christian Slater.  Bokeem Woodbine.  Howie Long.  Kevin Pollak.  Jon
Lovitz.  Thomas Haden Church.  Paul Anka.  Ice-T.  Bet you never expected
those last two, at least, to ever appear in the same film.  Yet despite
(or is that because of?) such a fascinatingly offbeat assembly of talent,
Warner Bros. has appeared to just about sweep _3000_Miles_to_Graceland_
under the proverbial rug, releasing the heist/road picture in an off-peak
season and giving it hardly the big promotional push that usually comes
with not one, but two name stars.  But who can blame them when the film
fails to even be amusing on a camp level?</P>
<P>        However, it must be said that the film is not a complete bore. 
In fact, once the film's first action sequence hits about 20 minutes in,
it looks as if a mildly diverting action thriller is kicking in.  Amid
the hubbub of Elvis week in Vegas, Russell's Michael and Costner's Murph
and three others (played by Slater, Arquette, and Woodbine) stage a
daring casino heist--all dressed up as the King, of course.  What begins
smoothly ends up culminating in a hail of bullets.  Director/co-writer
(with Richard Recco) Demian Lichtenstein, a music video vet in his first
big assignment, obviously studied up on John Woo before staging this
lengthy shootout, but there's no arguing the fact that such blatant
lifting gives this sequence a jolt.</P>
<P>        Sadly, that jolt is short-lived.  After some rather
rushed-through doublecrosses, the cast is whittled down significantly
(anyone familiar with movie conventions should figure out who gets offed
first), and the pace slows accordingly as Michael finds himself making a
quick getaway.  Weighing him down on his trip is not only a big bag full
of cash, but also overeager single mom Cybil (Cox, mysteriously billed
without the extra "Arquette"), with whom he's had some wild romps in the
sack; and her felon-in-waiting young son Jesse (David Kaye).  Meanwhile,
a not-so-happy Murph is following close behind, leaving a bloody trail in
his wake.</P>
<P>        Rumor has it that Costner and Russell put together two different
cuts; in the end, Russell's "character-oriented" edit was passed over in
favor of Costner's "action-oriented" version.  If this is the
faster-paced cut, I'd really hate to see the other one.  Once the
characters hit the road, the film slows to a snooze-worthy crawl, with
very few engaging moments breaking up the tedium.  These moments come
exclusively in the Costner section, which is less an indication of his
effectiveness here as a cold-blooded killer (he's simply functional) than
of how nothing of interest happens in the Russell thread.  Composed
mostly of soggy bonding between Michael and Jesse, this side of the film
is made memorable for all the wrong reasons by Lichtenstein's labored
efforts to make the audience care.</P>
<P>        But no one works harder to make some "emotional" connection than
Cox, who proves ill-equipped to handle material that can vaguely be
considered dramatic.  Her showcase Oscar clip is especially embarrassing;
while she has no difficulty in generating post-nasal drip, she fails to
squeeze out a single tear from her eyes.  By comparison, a bored-looking
Russell can only look good; and his ennui, in turn, makes Costner's
nominally more energized work look that much better.</P>
<P>        Lichtenstein finally gets guns blazing again in the long-overdue
finale, but by this point audiences will just be glad to be near the end.
 Without a particularly hissable villain nor a "hero" that holds any
rooting interest, _3000_Miles_to_Graceland_ doesn't even  get the basics
of a standard action thriller right.  Lichtenstein apparently thought
quirks such as a head-scratcher of an opening title sequence (depicting
two very CG scorpions engaged in fierce combat), a wacky Elvis-based
quasi-explanation for Murph's behavior, and the sight of Paul "Having My
Baby" Anka firing a rifle would be enough to keep a viewer entertained,
but like the film itself, these oddball touches sound a lot more
interesting than they really are.  </P>
