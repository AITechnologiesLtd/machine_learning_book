*This review contains moderate to major spoilers for "The Haunting"</P>
<P>    Some movies are born bad. This is one of them. "The Haunting" echoes
with the mind-numbing stupidity of your average summer CGI-piloted flick,
brimming with special effects in every nook and cranny, which do their fair
share of overshadowing what's really important here: the story which it
blatantly lacks. The premise is interesting: a psychologist lures three
insomniacs into a deserted, sprawling mansion under the pretense of helping
them achieve a good night's sleep. What he is really doing is setting them
up for a bizarre experiment in the elements of fear, paranoia, and dread.
Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson, in a silly role that the screenwriter probably
concocted while passing a kidney stone) comes upon Hill House, an immense,
beautiful estate which sits nine miles from any civilization.</P>
<P>And three people come upon Dr. Marrow's ad for the "insomnia research
project," promising handsome pay and a cure for their sleeplessness. The
first to arrive at the spooky mansion is central character Nell (Lili
Taylor, who absolutely shines), a fragile woman grieving over her mother's
death. She meets the creepy caretakers and then meets Theo (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), a bisexual tempest with a love for exotic fashion (she enters
the film in knee-high Prada boots and in later scenes sports sensual evening
wear and a fur coat). Then they both run into (literally) Luke (Owen Wilson
of "Armageddon"), the film's most enjoyable yet wasted character who makes
wisecracks and subtle advances at Theo, and is also the first of the three
to figure out that Dr. Marrow has something up his sleeve.</P>
<P>I have to admit that I liked the way that the picture started out. The
characters are interesting, if underdeveloped, and are played very well.
Early jumpy moments provide oomph for the plot to get going, because it does
take some time before the sleep-deprived trio begin wandering Hill House's
halls and find things that go bump in the night.</P>
<P>But two girls, a guy, and a spooky place is all that it really becomes,
when Nell digs into the house's sinister history and slowly becomes sucked
into its dark past. Hill House, we learn, was built by a man named Crane,
who operated mills and murdered children in his spare time (Nell finds bones
beneath a fireplace as well as a list of the deceased in one of his old
ledgers). From there, it goes downhill - fast. The others think that Nell is
going nuts, which forces Dr. Marrow to reveal the true nature of his
experiment. Gasp. That's what they try to make you do in "The Haunting," but
all you do is laugh - at multiple unintentionally funny moments. The people
in the row behind me cackled to themselves frequently, as did myself, as did
many people in the theater. I wish I could go into these over-the-top
moments, but I can only talk about movies this bad for so long.
Ultimately, Nell thinks that the house "wants her" and that it is full of
the lost souls of the murdered children put to work in Crane's mills. There
are several mentions of purgatory (a state in which a soul exists in neither
heaven nor hell) in the film, suggesting that this is where the souls of the
children (as well as Crane himself) exist. Actually, they're in a really
shitty script, but purgatory is fine too. The movie builds to such a
laughably silly climax that you will suddenly find the texture of your
shoelaces to be strangely interesting.</P>
<P>The evil soul of Mr. Crane is unleased and Nell battles him to both of
their ends, as he is sent to hell and she winds up dead herself. Dr. Marrow
and Theo (Luke was sadly decapitated in an earlier scene by a chimney flue)
look on as her spirit exits her body and begins to the guide the spirits of
the children, emerging from every corner of Hill House, and they all ascend
to heaven. Thus, the film ends. The bottom line is that "The Haunting" is
not a scary movie. Nevermind that it blows, it could at least pack a few
frights, but I only jumped once. An interesting new face in the film is Lili
Taylor, from "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "Ransom." She was also nominated for
an Emmy in a guest role on an X-Files episode. She sloshes through flat
dialogue (her final line in the film may go down as one of the worst uttered
in film history), but she performs the character very well. I hope we will
see more of her. The special effects are first-rate, but I think that in the
case of this movie they are put to bad use. The sets of the film however,
are jaw-dropping. If you are a fan of films that are interesting in concept
but ludicrous in climax, containing good actors and abundant eye-candy, "The
Haunting" may be worth a viewing. But don't get to immersed in it. You might
never want to see a horror film again.</P>
