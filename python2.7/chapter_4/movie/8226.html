<P>     Despite exploring a fascinating and lurid American subculture that 
rarely gets film exposure, JOHNS is consistently underwhelming.  The 
movie, brought to the screen by first-time director Scott Silver, would 
have been better served by attempting a low-key character study a la Gus 
Van Sant's similar, superior MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO.  Instead, what we get 
is a modern-day version of a Greek tragedy with some unnecessarily 
intrusive and irritatingly obvious religious symbolism thrown in for 
good measure.  If you haven't guessed the film's heavy-handed ending by 
the half-way mark, you aren't paying attention.</P>
<P>     JOHNS takes its name very seriously.  Not only is the movie about a 
pair of male prostitutes roaming the streets of L.A., but it seems that 
half the characters are named "John," including one of the two leads.  
The film is an episodic, "day in the life" account of John (David 
Arquette) and his best friend, Donner (Lukas Haas).  Many of the 
incidents are supposedly drawn from real-life stories, but Silver's film 
making never attains the level of gritty realism that would have made 
them believable.  His world is sanitized and idealized, and, while life 
on the streets isn't presented with the rosiness of PRETTY WOMAN, being 
a homeless prostitute doesn't seem like the worst career choice.  </P>
<P>     To give meaning to their lives, John and Donner are always working 
towards a goal.  At the beginning, John is trying to earn enough money 
so that he can spend his twenty-first birthday, which happens to fall on 
December 25, in a posh hotel.  He wants twenty-four hours of heaven.  By 
the end of the film, the objective has changed.  Now, it's an East Coast 
amusement park called Camelot, where the two have been offered jobs by 
one of Donner's relatives.  But the trip, like the hotel room, costs 
money, and that's something neither man has much of.  Plus, even if he 
did come up with the cash, John has a more serious obligation -- if he 
doesn't pay off a drug dealer (Terrence Dashon Howard, doing his best 
Cuba Gooding Jr. impression) he "borrowed" from, he won't survive this 
Christmas Eve.</P>
<P>     David Arquette (the deputy in SCREAM, and a sibling of Roseanna and 
Patricia) presents an effective portrayal of an aimless drifter.  His 
John doesn't expect much out of life, and his low expectations aren't 
disappointed.  The film opens with his "lucky sneakers" being stolen; 
after that, nothing seems to go right.  He has aspirations of "going 
somewhere," but both we and he recognize that he'll never amount to 
much.  We know far less about his past than we do his future.  When it 
comes to personal details, all we're told is that John is nominally 
straight, has an unbearably shrill girlfriend (Alanna Urbach), and is 
willing to do just about anything for a buck.  As JOHNS progresses, it 
becomes clear that John is a Christ-figure.  If the date of birth 
doesn't tip this off, the crown-of-thorns scarring on his forehead is a 
dead giveaway.</P>
<P>     The most compelling performance is turned in by Lukas Haas 
(EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU), whose sincerity and optimism as Donner is 
heartbreaking.  With his almost-feminine features, Donner appears very 
much the innocent, set adrift in Southern California when his parents 
disowned him after he confessed to being gay.  He's hopelessly in love 
with John, and, no matter how grim things look, he never stops dreaming 
that someday the two of them can be together in Camelot.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is peppered with familiar faces.  David Keith 
plays a mysterious stranger who wanders around offering a helping hand 
and a bite to eat to people in trouble.  Elliot Gould is wonderfully 
amusing as a family man who wants to keep his "dark" sexual life a 
secret, TV veteran Richard Kind is a sympathetic desk clerk at the Park 
Plaza Hotel, and John C. McGinley is a hard-bitten Hollywood producer 
who offers the barefoot John a pair of golf shoes as payment for 
services rendered.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the essential theme of JOHNS is summed up in one of John's 
lines:  "People come and go.  The only thing that stays the same is the 
Boulevard."  With varying effectiveness, JOHNS chronicles changes to two 
of the individuals who wander this immutable strip.  In the end, 
however, the film gets caught up in trying to tell a grandly 
melodramatic tale, when a simple, down-to-earth story of broken dreams 
and lonely characters would have been more engrossing.  Too often, the 
naturally-effective elements of JOHNS are swamped by the forced, 
scripted ones, and that curtails the movie's power and appeal.</P>
