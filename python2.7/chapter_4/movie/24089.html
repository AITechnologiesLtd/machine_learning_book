<P>When examining controversial subjects, discussions often diverge into
the emotional dimensions of the topics involved. This makes it
difficult to present a story based around a charged issue, because
there is the temptation to delve into the more sensational aspects.
With this film, veteran documentary filmmaker Errol Morris examines an
individual connected with two grave subjects, capital punishment and
the Holocaust.</P>
<P>The film begins by showing the main character, Fred Leuchter, sitting
inside a metal cage that is rising towards a Van De Graaff generator.
The artificial lightning repeatedly strikes strikes the cage,
symbolizing the controversy surrounding Leuchter. Then the narrative
slowly explores Leuchter's background, mostly in first person. He
immediately strikes the viewer as an odd character, with his mousy
appearance and whiny voice with a thick Boston accent. Morris' films
usually focus on individuals with odd or amusing interests and
passions, and this film is no different.</P>
<P>Leuchter has been associated with death and execution all his life.
His father worked at a prison, and growing up in that environment gave
Fred and interest in capital punishment. He taught himself the repair
and design of electric chairs. Eventually his interest branched out
into other forms of execution equipment, and he grew from a
self-taught technician to an engineer with a successful business. Few
people work in his field, so Leuchter established himself and designed
electric chairs, gas chambers, and gallows for the penal system for
several states.</P>
<P>Through this point in the story, Leuchter is an interesting character,
but hardly a controversial one. In fact, he even appears
compassionate. He is driven by the desire to make execution efficient
and humane. His primary concern is for the safety and dignity of both
the the executioner and the condemned. Although the tone of the
subject is morbid, there are numerous instances of odd humor based on
the quirkiness of Leuchter's character, like his claim to drink 40
cups of coffee a day.</P>
<P>The film then proceeds to examine the source of Leuchter's infamy--his
role supporting Holocaust denial. There are few topics as charged as
the mass slaughter of Jews that took place in Nazi Germany during the
middle of the Twentieth Century. It is a tragedy of such immense scope
that today it symbolically represents the lowest depths of evil to
which modern man can sink. However, there still remain a small
minority of Nazi sympathizers who dispute that the Holocaust actually
happened. Their claims of distorted pro-semitic propaganda are not
usually taken seriously, and the historical fact of its occurance is
not an open topic for objective analysis. When one particular
Holocaust denier seeks to scientifically examine whether the Holocaust
actually occurred, he is unable to find anyone who is willing to even
consider the question, except Fred Leuchter.</P>
<P>Unlike most people involved in this inquiry, Leuchter has no political
agenda. He is willing to keep an open mind and use forensic evidence
to determine whether six million individuals could have been killed by
the Nazi regime. Leuchter feels that as an expert on execution
methodology, he can determine whether the facilities proportedly used
for the mass killings were actually used. Leuchter travels to the
remains of a death camp and surreptitiously takes samples of the site.
He meticulously documents his research, including ample videotaping of
his activities. The viewer sees the diminutive, unassertive man
crawling through all parts of the historical site with a hammer and
chisel, chipping off pieces of the buildings so he can have them
tested for cyanide residue.</P>
<P>After he returns home, he has the samples analyzed and finds that
there is no basis, according to his knowledge of execution procedures,
to say that mass killings could have taken place. He publishes a paper
detailing this finding, and the infamous "Leuchter Report" completely
alters his life. It is obvious to the viewer that Leuchter has made a
Faustian bargain. He overestimated his knowledge of the scientific
basis of his testing. He took on an important study as an expert in
the field that boosted his ego, but it makes him more enemies than
friends. Eventually, Leuchter is shown in his present situation where
his wife has left him, he has become unemployable, and his only
admirers are people that no one takes seriously. He is merely a pawn
in a larger political game, but it is a role he entered voluntarily,
without assessing the consequences.</P>
<P>Unlike the majority of Holocaust deniers, Leuchter come across as
pitiable rather than evil. Most are anti-semitic radicals who believe
the Holocaust was an exaggeration, and are looking for proof to
support that belief. Leuchter, on the other hand, approaches the topic
from a completely objective perspective. He makes no assumptions, and
uses his expert knowledge to extract scientific evidence that either
support or contradict historical Holocaust claims. Ultimately the film
paints him as a pathetic victim of his own ego. Although he is an
expert on constructing execution machines, he is not qualified to be
an investigator of historical events. Interviews with other experts
reveal the fatal flaws with Leuchter's approach and methods. Being in
the middle of such heated controversy, most observers are split into
two groups, the fringe radicals who support him and believe his
conclusions, and the majority who denounce him as a tool for hatred.
Morris' film carefully avoids judgments and allows the viewers to see
the man clearly and allows the alternate assessment, that he is simply
a naive, pitiful fool who allowed his ego to drag him into his own
ruin.</P>
<P>The style of the film is different than what is typically seen in
documentaries in that actual footage is mixed with dramatizations.
These dramatizations are done for viseral effect. For example, there
is plenty of footage of Leuchter rummaging through the ruins of
Auchwitz, but there is also footage of Leuchter re-enacting those
actions in a studio, as an eerily backlit silhouette. By using
contrived scenes such as these, Morris is not augmenting the factual
basis of the narrative, but he is accentuating the imagery in order to
build mood. It is a bold style for a documentarian, and a technique
that Morris has perfected.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. The film deals with difficult and sensitive
subject matter, and although it is mostly free of disturbing imagery,
the topics discussed may be disturbing to sensitive viewers. That same
dimension makes it a powerful and thought provoking exploration of an
individual. Director Errol Morris skillfully navigates the narrative
through many charged subjects, but consistently keeps the focus on the
examination of the central character. He is brought to life and
objectively displayed for the audience to dissect and examine for
themselves.</P>
