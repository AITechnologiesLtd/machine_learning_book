<P>     In this cinematic era A.Q. (After Quentin), much film criticism is
filtered through the pop-culture sieve that is Tarantino.  We just can't
seem to help ourselves -- when we're not noting ways Tarantino has cribbed
from his film-making forebears, we're noting the ways his acolytes have
cribbed from him.  A gun can't be fired but his name is invoked; a
conversation can't be peppered with profanity and obscure references but
he becomes an adjective.  When a film like GO appears, so like PULP
FICTION in both narrative structure and style, it's easy to dismiss it on
a comparative basis without discussing why the Tarantino oeuvre has become
the Greenwich Mean Time for an entire genre -- the edgy, after-hours comic
thriller.  It's easy to miss why director Doug Liman's film works in the
ways it understands Tarantino's unique touch, and doesn't work in the ways
it fails to understand. </P>
<P>     Like PULP FICTION, GO involves several non-chronological yet
intertwined stories of Los Angeles denizens with less than glowing morals.
Ronna (Sarah Polley), a young grocery store clerk, takes the shift of her
co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew) to help pay back rent, then also takes
some of Simon's side business as a drug dealer to help a bit more
substantially.  Her two customers are Zack (Jay Mohr) and Adam (Scott
Wolf), a pair of party animals who may be undercover cops, or perhaps soap
opera actors, or perhaps some interesting combination of the two.  Simon,
meanwhile, is on a road trip to Las Vegas with a trio of pals including
Marcus (Taye Diggs), a road trip which always seems to be just one step
ahead of complete disaster.  These three stories meet, swerve and overlap
through one wild 24-hour period filled with sex, drugs and a pre-Christmas
rave.</P>
<P>     There's something to be said for a film with the ability to grab you
viscerally, which is one of the tricks GO manages to pull off.  That
description isn't just about pacing (though GO moves with the hypnotic
momentum of a rave beat), nor is it just about the level of violence and
action (though there's one kicker of a car chase through Vegas).  Like the
most memorable moments in PULP FICTION, the most memorable moments in GO
energize you with the sense that you're really not sure what's going to
happen next.  At key junctures, you realize that screenwriter John August
is in complete command of his narrative as he turns expectations upside
down in ways that make perfect sense, not just because he can.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that GO doesn't wander off on tangents just because
they might prove to be entertaining.  GO isn't a clean, linear story even
in the most fundamental ways, but it's also a case of a film that doesn't
let the main storyline get in the way of some hilarious distractions:
Ronna's entrepreneurial spirit as she sells her own special brand of pills
at the party; Zack and Adam at a Christmas dinner with ulterior motives;
Simon experimenting with tantric sex with a pair of bridesmaids; the
encyclopedic knowledge of a cat during a hallucinogenic trip.  Like much
of Tarantino's work, it's a loose and sloppy sort of a film, which doesn't
mean that there's no logic to what's going on.  It's just the logic of
giving an audience one heck of a ride, letting the characters stroll and
stray because the film-makers have created an atmosphere where we trust
they'll stroll somewhere interesting.</P>
<P>     Unlike much of Tarantino's work, however, there's not much going on
beneath the glittering surface of GO.  The closest it gets to a thematic
link is the idea that these young people dash into dangerous situations
with little restraint on their desire to...well, to go.  There's nothing
resembling the moral center of PULP FICTION, nor do August and Liman show
nearly as much affection for their flawed, self-absorbed characters.  The
performances are solid even when the chattery dialogue feels a bit forced,
giving us plenty of reason to follow the characters even when they seem
like hopeless screw-ups, but no one is experiencing a fundamental life
change.  GO is a dazzling demonstration of how good even a derivative sort
of film can be when someone grasps the basic principles of engrossing
film-making.  It also demonstrates what we talk about when we talk about
Tarantino -- a way of telling us something about humanity between the
bursts of dialogue and gunfire.</P>
