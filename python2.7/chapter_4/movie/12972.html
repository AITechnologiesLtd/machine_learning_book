<PRE>THE TRUMAN SHOW
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I don't know how many other people have had the idea cross 
their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched 
by another world of people, but it's something I used to wonder about 
when I was younger. I can't decide if I first thought it because I 
watched a lot of TV or because my brother hit me in the head with a 
baseball bat, but I'm pretty sure Andrew Niccol, screenwriter for THE 
TRUMAN SHOW, has had the same curious thought.</P>
<P>        THE TRUMAN SHOW is about a man (Jim Carrey) whose 
entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the 
public. Since birth, he's been living in the fictional island town of 
Seahaven, Fla., which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond 
the Hollywood sign. All the people in Truman Burbank's life are 
actors, and the anonymous townfolk paid extras. People watch 
Truman's life 24 hours a day, live, with no commercial interruptions. 
Revenue comes instead from product placement, a staple of 
contemporary Hollywood, with Truman's friends and relatives 
describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones. 
The sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else.</P>
<P>        Even if you haven't seen THE TRUMAN SHOW, you've probably 
learned most of the crucial details from the commercials, the trailer 
and other promotion blitzes. If anything I've written so far is a surprise 
to you, then I pity you for making me a primary source for your 
entertainment news. Either way, you should probably know the 
premise of THE TRUMAN SHOW going into it, because otherwise you'll 
probably think it sucks. It begins with Jim Carrey looking into a 
mirror, reciting the crucial "eat me" scene from ALIVE, wishing his 
neighbors a good day, afternoon and evening, and living in domestic 
bliss with his wife (Laura Linney).</P>
<P>        But weird things start happening. A stage light comes falling 
out of the sky, Truman hears people tracking his movements on the 
radio and he swears he sees his dead father. We learn through a 
flashback that his father drowned when Truman was a child, sailing 
through a rainstorm. The death was staged by director Christof (Ed 
Harris), who wanted to put a fear of water into Truman to keep him 
from leaving the island.</P>
<P>        Similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon 
the truth, not the least of them Truman's best friend Marlon (Noah 
Emmerich), who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the 
last thing he'd ever do is hurt him. As Truman's trusting eyes tear 
over, Christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide 
audience of people who apparently never watch anything else. There's 
even a daily behind-the-scenes update from Harry Shearer that 
captures the highlights of Truman's existence.</P>
<P>        The key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance 
between humor and drama, because a premise like this has its obvious 
implications in both directions. And it all hinges on Carrey, who has 
to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find 
out what the hell is going on. He's come a long way from talking butt 
cheeks in ACE VENTURA. Most fundamentally, it's just plain interesting 
to follow along as director Peter Weir shows us just how they can 
capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they 
coordinate extras, hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors.</P>
<P>        The most interesting thing about THE TRUMAN SHOW is that 
most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a 
show like this. Sure, the most interesting TV genre of the '90s has 
been reality programming and Jerry Springer's popularity is through 
the roof, but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their 
intimate details over to the airwaves. And when news shows use 
hidden cameras, it's done in the name of the greater good, not 
entertainment. But merge the two and you've got THE TRUMAN SHOW.</P>
<P>        Right now, it's implausible -- I mean, the FCC won't let you 
say the s-word on the air; do you think they'd let you broadcast every 
detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent? One day, 
though, it could happen. And, even though it would mean the end of 
privacy, people would eat it up. You know they would.</P>
