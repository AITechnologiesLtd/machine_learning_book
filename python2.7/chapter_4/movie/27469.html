 O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?</PRE>
<PRE>By Joel and Ethan Coen</PRE>
<PRE>De Vargas   PG-13   107 min.</PRE>
<P>     People love it or hate it.  The Times gave it a rave.  
Entertainment Weekly gave it an F and labeled it the worst picture of 
the year. </P>
<P>     Trust me (even though you should never trust anyone who says "trust 
me"): this is a wonderful movie.  The Coen Brothers have made a slyly 
crafted, joyously eclectic picaresque road/buddy movie drawn from 
sources as diverse as Preston Sturges and Homer, The Wizard of Oz, The 
Court Jester, It Happened One Night, Gunga Din, some Leni Riefenstahl, 
some Busby Berkeley, and maybe even a little Jean-Luc Godard.  Does that 
sound crowded?  It's just the tip of the iceberg. </P>
<P>     "Based," a title card announces, "on The Odyssey by Homer."  This 
odyssey starts with three convicts escaping a chain gang in the 
Depression-era Mississippi Delta, and setting off after buried loot.  
They're Ulysses (George Clooney) and his dim-witted companions Pete 
(John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Along the way they run 
into a gallery of Homeric rogues -- an old blind seer (Lee Weaver); 
three sirens (Mia Tate, Musetta Vander, Christy Taylor) who lull them, 
rob them, and turn one of them into a frog; a rascally one-eyed Bible 
salesman (John Goodman); Ulysses's wife Penny (Holly Hunter), not quite 
as steadfast and true as her classical counterpart.  Also livening the 
landscape are characters suggesting legendary Delta bluesman Robert 
Johnson (Chris Thomas King); Jimmie Davis, who wrote "You Are My 
Sunshine" and served a couple of terms as Governor of Louisiana (Charles 
Durning); and  a bi-polar Babyface Nelson (Michael Badalucco).</P>
<P>     This is a musical, and the music is terrific.  The centerpiece is 
the recording of "Man of Constant Sorrow" cut by Ulysses and his 
confederates under the moniker "The Soggy Bottom Boys" at a little radio 
station.  The genius of the Coens is to temper their gleeful 
extravagances with the unwinking straightforwardness of the music, which 
swells on the sountrack with studio values even when it's being sung al 
fresco.</P>
<P>     The movie's title comes from the Preston Sturges classic Sullivan's 
Travels; it's the social message film that Hollywood director Sullivan 
(Joel McCrea) wants to make for the common people when he goes out in 
search of the "real" Depression America, only to discover that the 
common people would rather laugh than be reminded of their misery. </P>
<P>     The Coens understand that.  Laughter surges through this movie like 
water bursting from a dam.  Some of the scenes may seem a bit over the 
top, but they're really more around the bend.  They're held in line by 
disciplined direction and beautifully-tuned acting.  There's almost a 
quality of down-home magic realism to this movie, a blend of cartoon, 
classicism, and social commentary, expertly filmed in yellowish 
nostalgic tones by Roger Deakins.   Some of it makes little sense 
individually, but there's a perfect sense to it overall.   </P>
<P>     The linchpin to the whole project is George Clooney's remarkable 
Ulysses Everett McGill.  This is a risk-taking Clooney you've never 
seen, a pomaded dandy with raffish Gable looks and a silver tongue given 
to locutions like "It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of 
the human heart."  If you weren't sure before, the jury is now in: 
George Clooney is a first-rate talent.  So are the Coens.  If there's an 
F here, it's for Fabulous.</P>
