<PRE>BY AARON MICHAELS</PRE>
<P>Disturbing Behavior is the newest teen horror film that desperately
tries to milk a little more money from the crowd that liked Scream and I
Know What You Did Last Summer. Disturbing Behavior doesn't hold a candle
to any of these films which in comparison deserve to be studied
thoroughly by film historians and placed on the AFI list.</P>
<P>The plot of Disturbing Behavior is so disgusting it's almost unbearable
to write it in the review. Steve Clark (James Marsden) and his family
move from Chicago to get away from the personal demons of an older son
who had committed suicide which we see in quick flashbacks. These quick
flashbacks
have absolutely no point and are only inserted to add gasoline to the
fire that will be created later in Steve's mind.</P>
<P>The family moves to a little fishing town called Cradle Bay which is
very reminiscent of the little fishing town the characters where
terrorized in I Know What You Did Last Summer. Of course we must go
through the 'I'm new here' scenes where Steve feels out of place. First
day of school rolls along and Steve is introduced to the gothic, stoned
teenagers Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl) and Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes of
WB's "Dawson Creek") who he becomes friends with.</P>
<P>Gavin has a theory that something's up with the popular kids at Cradle
Bay High. They call themselves the Blue Ribbons. They are the jocks and
cheerleaders who have bake sales and blood drives annually. Gavin
witnesses a murder in an earlier scene and this starts his mind running.
He believes that
teachers and parents are mindwashing bad students to make everyone
perfect. None of his goth friends believe his story and claim he was
just "high". Could these parents be purifying the world? Who will be
there next victim? You can only guess. You won't need to think hard.</P>
<P>Well the next 40 minutes is devoted to chases and body counts. Each
scene is shot very dark with gloomy images and whispers everywhere. Blue
Ribbon members mutilate people in large populated areas and are not
noticed whatsoever.</P>
<P>Is this movie an entire lost cause. Almost. There is one character I
liked quite a bit. William Sadler does a good job as the school's
janitor who is looked on as the village idiot. Could he be more?
Probably. He seems to be having a good time and plays his part very
excited.</P>
<P>This horror film breaks a lot of the horror film rules that were defined
by the modern day classics like "Halloween" and "Scream". They think
that just showing a person being murdered is scary. What the above films
do well is play with your mind. They don't believe the gorier the
better.</P>
