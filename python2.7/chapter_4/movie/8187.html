                             THE ODYSSEY 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky. Cast (in credits order) Armand Assante
- Odysseus; Greta Scacchi - Penelope, Geraldine Chaplin, Jeroen Krabb=E9,
Christopher Lee, Irene Papas, Bernadette Peters - Circe, Eric Roberts,
Isabella Rossellini, Vanessa L. Williams - Calypso. Written by Homer
(poem), Andrei Konchalovsky, Christopher Solimine.</P>
<P>Odysseus the cunning ruler of Ithica, who fought at the sides of
Achilles, and brought about the fall of Troy with his ingenious
contraption - the Trojan Horse. Who defied Poseidon, and claimed the
right of victory over Troy as his own; thus angering the gods and was
cursed for twenty years, never to return to his home land and fair
Penelope.</P>
<P>Dear Odysseus,
A few simple words from a lowly movie critic.
Have you ever heard of the phrase, "I'm sorry, I was wrong."</P>
<P>Obviously not. I guess it takes some people, especially Greek heroes of
the tragic realm, a lot longer to realise that they have made a mistake.
A simple apology would have saved Odysseus, and his crew a lot of
unnecessary demise and heart ache.</P>
<P>"PENELOPE" a non-rhyming poem by Tim Voon.</P>
<P>Penelope, fair Penelope. I weep for you.
Whilst you raised your son alone, and watched your mother-in-law die,
Your stubborn husband was being tossed through and fro on the waves of
destiny.</P>
<P>He claimed to be forever loyal, and loving,
He was in truth having one heck of a time in the bed of Circe (10
years);
When he was through with her, he moved on to Calypso (5 years).
I guess one goddess was not enough to quench his lusty loins.</P>
<P>Fair Penelope, ever true.
You kept your word, and lay not with another man,
If only your Odysseus was as pure, as your sweet, gentle heart.
You deserved better.</P>
<P>Comment: Now lets hear the tale again, Homer Simpson style.</P>
