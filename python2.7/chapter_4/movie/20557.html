R, 1999

<P>STIGMATA arrives in theaters amidst a certain amount of controversy 
over its negative portrayal of the Catholic Church's authority 
structure. Personally, I don't think it's worth anyone's effort to 
get offended over something as incoherent as this film, which amounts 
to little more than a two-hour music video. Some half-hearted 
attempts are made to tell a story about Vatican concealment of a 
previously unknown gospel, but most of it makes very little sense and 
is drowned out by the endless MTV-style cutting and the disruptively 
loud soundtrack. Viewers are more likely to come away questioning the 
screenplay's logic than questioning their religious beliefs.</P>
<P>The title refers to a condition reportedly experienced by various 
religious believers throughout history, in which the person 
mysteriously begins to exhibit the wounds inflicted on Christ before 
he died: nail puncture holes in the wrists and feet, lacerations from 
a whip and a crown of thorns, and spear wounds to the sides. STIGMATA 
begins by introducing us to Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne), a 
Catholic priest and a former scientist who investigates reports of 
miracles for the Church. He is sent to Pittsburgh when Frankie Paige 
(Patricia Arquette), a 23-year-old hair-stylist and, we learn, an 
atheist, begins to exhibit the stigmata. Andrew quickly realizes that 
this is probably legitimate, despite the fact that all previous 
stigmatics have been devout believers. She is taken to the hospital 
repeatedly for her injuries, supernatural events such as windows 
spontaneously breaking seem to follow her, she is hearing voices, and 
finally she channels an ancient Aramaic text and scrawls it on the 
wall of her apartment. Andrew's superior, Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan 
Pryce), however, is strangely disapproving and elusive, and 
eventually we learn why: the text that Frankie copied is a lost 
Gospel that Houseman fears could undermine the Church's authority, 
and he's willing to kill her to keep this discovery quiet.</P>
<P>If there's anything offensive to the Catholic Church here, it's that 
Andrew and Houseman both seem to be so ignorant about Catholicism. At 
the beginning, Andrew talks with his mentor in a Vatican library, who 
reveals that there are actually more supposed gospels in existence 
than the four in the Bible, and that mainstream Christianity simply 
hasn't accepted any of the others. This is very old news to anyone 
with even a passing acquaintance with Biblical scholarship, and to 
suggest that Andrew wouldn't already know this from his seminary 
training is impossible to swallow. The message contained in the lost 
Gospel that Houseman seeks to suppress is that the Kingdom of God is 
found everywhere, most importantly in the individual, and not just in 
"structures of stone and marble" (i.e. churches). Seeing as Jesus 
more or less said this in the four traditional Gospels, I can't 
fathom why Houseman would think it's dangerous. No Catholic priest 
would deny that the relationship between God and the individual 
supercedes the importance of an institution, and it isn't as if the 
text called for the believers to start tearing down churches. Perhaps 
the biggest howler is when Frankie worries that she will soon die 
because she will eventually receive the fifth wound of the stigmata 
-- the spear to the sides, which she calls "the one that killed him." 
Andrew appears to share her concern, but tries to reassure her by 
telling her that no one has ever received all five wounds of the 
stigmata. Evidently he skipped the parts of his training that 
required him to actually open the Bible, because otherwise he would 
know that Christ died from being crucified, not from being stabbed to 
death with a spear.</P>
<P>STIGMATA is filmed in a dimly lit, grainy style of cinematography: it 
seems to have been inspired more by BATMAN or DARK CITY than JESUS OF 
NAZARETH. Director Rupert Wainwright's hyperactive camera work is 
effective in capturing the hallucinatory power of Frankie's 
supernatural experiences, but it tends to distract in the other 
scenes, and characterization and plot get lost in the unnecessarily 
jumpy cutting and the brain-pounding music by Smashing Pumpkins 
songwriter Billy Corgan. There is only a superficial exploration of 
the relationship between Frankie and Andrew: much of it focuses on 
the relatively dull notion that he finds her sexually tempting, and 
their differences of belief are underdeveloped. Andrew is an 
interesting character in that he's found himself guided more by 
science than by faith, but this is unfortunately played out in scenes 
that seem to lack much internal logic. At one point, when Frankie is 
channeling, he says, "Who are you?" and the voice of a dead priest 
tells him, "The messenger is unimportant." Later, she is channeling 
this same dead priest, and when Andrew asks the spirit if he can be 
the new messenger, the spirit responds, "The messenger believes. You 
only have doubt." Now hang on a second: I thought the messenger was 
unimportant. And if belief is a necessity, why did the spirit choose 
an atheist as his medium?</P>
<P>The marketing campaign for STIGMATA has touted it as another entry in 
the recent wave of supernatural thrillers. It is, in fact, the 
supernatural sequences that are the most effective, since the 
disorienting music-video style is actually appropriate for these 
scenes. Wainwright uses a clever technique during the stigmata 
scenes, cutting back and forth between Frankie exhibiting the wounds 
and black-and-white flashbacks in which the hammer and nails and the 
whip are used on Christ. The scenes in which Frankie channels through 
a deep male voice are also pretty unnerving. I've been told that this 
was lifted from THE EXORCIST, which I haven't seen, but regardless of 
where the idea came from, it does work. Even these scenes, however, 
are marred by poor story logic and a tendency to go over the top. A 
sequence in which a hysterical Frankie runs out into the middle of 
the street and causes cars to swerve out of control and crash into 
each other borders on being unintentionally funny, and the film is 
never quite clear on who she is channeling and why. Most of the time, 
it seems to be the dead priest, but there is the hint of demonic 
possession at one point when she tries to seduce Andrew and then 
starts cursing at him and throwing him around the room. I was left 
wondering whether the filmmakers intended for us to think that she 
was channeling both the spirits of the deceased and demonic visitors, 
or if they thought for some reason that the spirit of a dead Catholic 
priest would behave like this. More to the point, I wonder if they 
even cared, given that they seem much more interested in flashy 
cutting and visual pyrotechnics than in probing the meaning behind 
the images they create.</P>
<P>There is a scene midway through the film which illustrates much of 
what is wrong with Stigmata. Andrew and Frankie are sitting in an 
outdoor café, discussing their respective lives as Andrew reflects on 
some of the sacrifices he's made to become a priest. Then their 
voices become inaudible, with saccharine music playing while we watch 
their lips move. Then the scene is interrupted by Frankie suddenly 
exhibiting the thorn wounds on her forehead and screaming 
hysterically. Riveting, certainly, but the opportunity for character 
development is wasted in favor of more showy camera work. STIGMATA is 
a film that would almost be better viewed with the sound turned off, 
so that the viewer could enjoy the flair and breakneck pacing of the 
visuals without worrying about the story possibilities that are being 
squandered along the way.</P>
<P>If this review comes off as unnecessarily harsh, that's probably 
because STIGMATA is the most frustrating kind of mediocre film: the 
kind that could have and should have been good. There are many routes 
that the filmmakers could have taken that would have resulted in a 
far superior product. The interaction between an atheist receving 
divine revelation and a priest plagued by doubt could have made for 
an intriguing character piece. Andrew's dilemma as a priest trying to 
balance his religious faith and his scientific skepticism would have 
been a worthy topic in today's world. Frankie's story actually 
carries some strong Biblical parallels, most notably that of the 
unbeliever chosen by God and the idea that divine service is equal 
parts reward and burden. The film refers to each of these issues, but 
it can't sit still long enough to explore any of them in any depth. 
Later on, it tries to switch into full-blown conspiracy thriller 
mode, but the notion of a cardinal trying to suppress a message 
that's already in the Bible is too ill-conceived for this to be even 
remotely convincing.</P>
<P>It has yet to be seen whether or not STIGMATA will inspire the same 
level of widespread protest as, say, The Last Temptation of Christ. 
Frankly, the screenplay's picture of the Church is so misinformed 
that nothing it has to say on the subject can be taken especially 
seriously. If you absolutely must protest this film, my advice would 
be to forget the half-hearted attempts at theology and complain about 
the overwrought visuals and the sloppy storytelling instead.</P>
