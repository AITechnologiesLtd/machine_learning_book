<PRE>A Little Too Open-Minded
Stir of Echoes</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>This film has been compared to "The Sixth Sense." While it has the
similarity of a man and boy who see a ghost, the rest is quite different. In
this case, the man (Kevin Bacon) is the boy's father and there is only one
ghost -- haunting their home.</P>
<P>Bacon delivers a strong performance, sporting an picture-perfect working
class Chicago accent. The build up of tension and suspense is sewn together
well, but the conclusion has more of a TV mystery show spirit than that of a
powerful feature climax.</P>
<P>The motions of the ghost (stirred by frame manipulation) create an
excellently eerie feeling to her presence. I also enjoyed the chilling way
Bacon's confrontation left him pale and out of breath. I could almost feel
that chill. However, there was little point in contriving a way to make the
ghost a threat to the living. (I'd have to fault the "Sixth Sense" for
taking a few stabs in that direction as well). It's already scary dealing
with a believable ghost -- there's no need to invent a threat to life.</P>
<P>Also, when the wife "accidentally" stumbles upon some information from
another guy who sees ghosts (and knows how to deal with them), she doesn't
share this information with her husband who is clearly less than stabilized
by his knew found "open-mindedness." Additionally, this character
(ghost-seer guy), though carefully introduced into the script; disappears
from it rather promptly without a trace.</P>
<P>Intriguing and chilling most of the way through, "Stirs of Echoes" is a
solid "B" film.</P>
