<P>Being tickled is horrible as well as enjoyable, but worth it for that moment 
of relief when the tickler finally stops. Alejandro Amenábar's "Open Your 
Eyes" is like that. The film involves us in one man's private hell, as his 
life falls apart and his understanding of why keeps lessening; but by the 
time it's over, and he gets an answer, we're so glad to stop holding our 
breath we leave grinning.</P>
<P>It's hard to describe the film's premise without spoiling any surprises. 
Eduardo Noriega plays César, who we first meet in a high-security psychiatric 
facility, trying to convince a psychiatrist that he is not guilty of whatever 
crime he's been accused of, and telling the doctor all he remembers of recent 
months. César was a promiscuous cad, we learn, who was involved in a car 
accident which left him horribly disfigured and bitterly angry.</P>
<P>His vile temper strained his friendships with best buddy Pelayo (Fele 
Martínez) and love interest Sofía (Penélope Cruz), until, César remembers, 
plastic surgeons managed to repair his face. His life started to get better, 
but then he suffered memory loss, saw people's faces change into those of 
others, and experienced various other weird happenings.</P>
<P>What was, and is, going on? Is César mad, or is somebody playing an elaborate 
prank? Is anything real? And of what significance is the cryptic Mr. 
Duvernois (Gérard Barray)? "Open Your Eyes", originally titled "Abre Los 
Ojos", involves and entangles us with these urgent questions until we DEMAND 
an explanation. It's been quite a while since I've seen a movie mystery, but 
this is clearly a good one.</P>
<P>Amenábar, the director, occasionally takes us inside César's dreams, but 
mostly relies on the screenplay's drama to be surreal enough, shooting his 
picture without a lot of flashy tricks. This is a good tactic, because it 
draws us in more realistically than a film like "The Matrix", which was more 
fun for style than story.</P>
<P>The performances, too, walk the line between the mundane and the strange. 
Noriega, Cruz, Martínez and Najwa Nimri speak and carry themselves fast and 
slow, confidently and cautiously. It's odd, and yet not odd, and certainly 
hard to describe... I guess it's intended that way.</P>
<P>"Open Your Eyes" is better than "The Sixth Sense", another recent film with 
an odd feel and surprise ending, which got great reviews, huge revenues and 
six Oscar nominations. I thought that movie was a con, purporting to be about 
one thing, making us wait for that thing's payoff, then pulling a stupid 
trick out of its hat with the hope of dazzling us. "Open Your Eyes", from 
very early on, takes unexpected turns, makes seemingly impossible twists and 
draws us into a confusing puzzle. When we realise what the score is, and 
everything slots into place, it's exactly what we've been waiting for.</P>
