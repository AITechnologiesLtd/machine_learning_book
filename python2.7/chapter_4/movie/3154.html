<P>While watching DROP ZONE, I kept thinking about those ski films Warren
Miller has been making for years.  You know the ones--they're
basically a bunch of impressive stunts and nice photography.  Well,
DROP ZONE looks like a skydiving version of one of those films, to
which someone has attempted to add a plot.  I emphasize the word
"attempted," and it's an extremely lackluster attempt at that.  There
is some great aerial footage in DROP ZONE, but the story is a complete
bore, and Wesley Snipes continues to bury himself in Z-grade action
films.</P>
<P>     Snipes plays Pete Nessip, a Federal marshall assigned with his
brother (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) to escort a mob computer whiz (Michael
Jeter) on a prison transfer.  While the plane is in mid-air, a group of
terrorists hijack it, and when there is an explosion during the attack,
Nessip's brother is killed, with Nessip himself blamed for contributing
to the disaster.  But Nessip doubts that it was a simple hijacking, and
he is right:  a team of expert skydivers led by Ty Moncrief (Gary
Busey) intends to use the computer whiz to break into government
records and provide drug dealers with the identity of undercover
agents.  With the aid of sometimes-reckless skydiving instructor Jessie
Crossman (Yancy Butler), Nessip sets out to infiltrate the skydiving
fraternity and thwart Moncrief's plan.</P>
<P>     We've already had one skydiving movie this year (TERMINAL
VELOCITY), and it wasn't a particularly good one.  However, TERMINAL
VELOCITY did have one very important thing going for it--no one
involved seemed to be taking themselves at all seriously.  It was
light-hearted, and occasionally quite funny.  DROP ZONE, on the other
hand, is best taken with meals as a mild sedative.  In lieu of creating
their own set-up, screenwriters Pete Barsocchini and John Bishop appear
to have given Snipes the opportunity to do PASSENGER 57 again (I
suppose to get it right this time).  They also wrack their brains to
come up with such cinematic innovations as a bar fight and a dead
relative to avenge.  It's not stretching the point to say that the plot
between skydiving sequences in DROP ZONE is somewhere on the order of
the plot between sex scenes in your standard X-rated film.</P>
<P>     Of course, as with that example, most viewers probably aren't
coming to DROP ZONE for riveting plot turns and crackling dialogue.
The skydiving sequences are fantastic, perhaps the best I've ever
seen.  They are creatively shot, and include some impressive
synchronized stunts.  As long as DROP ZONE is in the air, it is
something quite exciting.</P>
<P>     Then it hits ground again, and it burns in hard.  After beginning
as a rip-off of PASSENGER 57, DROP ZONE ends like a rip-off of DIE
HARD, and a really bad one at that.  Gary Busey delivers a performance
that has stamps on it, practically sighing audibly as he wanders
through a half-hearted version of his UNDER SIEGE psycho act.  It is
inexcusable in an action thriller to have a boring villain, and Busey
has not an ounce of charisma in this role.  Director John Badham has
made exciting films in the past, but even he appears to be slumming
here.  While the action in the air (which was not his to shoot) is
great, the action on the ground is often ineptly staged and badly
edited.</P>
<P>     What is genuinely depressing is watching the direction Wesley
Snipes' career is taking.  Snipes is a fine actor with a tremendous
range, but for a few years now he has appeared almost exclusively in
bad action films.  It is fine that he has carved out a niche for
himself, and heaven knows it's not easy being an African-American
leading man in Hollywood.  But Snipes should really think about taking
a few character parts that force producers to take him seriously as an
actor, and for him to have a chance at the kind of roles Samuel L.
Jackson and Laurence Fishburne are given a shot at.  His performance in
DROP ZONE is thoroughly competent, but that's all it has to be.  If he
contines to appear in films like DROP ZONE, he might as well take his
career and jump out of a plane with it.  Without a parachute.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 skydives:  3.</PRE>
