<PRE>My Name Is Joe ***1/2</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
starring Peter Mullan, Louise Goodall, David McKay, Anne-Marie Kennedy
written by Paul Laverty
directed by Ken Loach</PRE>
<P>For many years, Scottish filmmaker Ken Loach has made movies about the
struggles of the working-class citizen in today's society. His latest
film, MY NAME IS JOE, is one of the most powerful and intense
character studies I have seen in years. At the beginning of the film,
the title character, Joe Kavanagh(Mullan), announces that after being
an alcoholic for several years, he has finally sobered up. Joe is a
poor man who does odd jobs like coaching soccer. He runs into a woman
named Sarah(Louise Goodall) who works as a nurse and is higher up in
the ranks of society. Joe wants to ask her on a date, but he doesn't
have money for a fancy dinner, so they go bowling. At first she
declines his invitation, calling him too "wild", but she ends up
giving in to his charm. Also, both Joe and Sarah are trying to help
out Liam(David McKay) and Sabine(Anne-Marie Kennedy), a young couple
who are caught up in the underworld of drugs.</P>
<P>MY NAME IS JOE seems to be a simple and familiar story, but it rises
above mediocrity because of a raw, brutally sympathetic performance by
Peter Mullan, who won the Best Actor award at last year's Cannes Film
Festival. Mullan makes Joe such a three-dimensional character that he
makes up for the lack of depth in Sarah's character.  Few films can
match the emotional wallop provided by Joe's transcendence in MY NAME
IS JOE. The film also deserves praise for subtitling the thick
Scottish accents, providing us with pure English. Other British films
should take note of this new technique. It is a shame that MY NAME IS
JOE has been released in early 1999 and will definitely be forgotten
by next year's Oscars. But I'm glad to see that there are some
filmmakers interested in just putting out a film that's worth
seeing. MY NAME IS JOE is that, and more.  </P>
