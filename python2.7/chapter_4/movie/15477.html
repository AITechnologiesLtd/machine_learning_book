<P>     HAPPINESS is almost too difficult to watch -- not because of its
potentially shocking content, but because it's so achingly sad.  Lonely
men make obscene phone calls which only seem to make them more frustrated.
Stabs at romance turn into depressing one-night stands.  A few moments of
isolated contact quickly vanish in a rage of rejection.  The dozen or so
principal characters in Todd Solondz's bleakly funny suburban nightmare
fumble and fail so consistently in their pursuit of happiness you might
suspect it was unattainable.</P>
<P>     And, in the sense that some of them define it, it is.  HAPPINESS
deals with people whose chances for contentment are thwarted by yearnings
for things they can't have, or have been led to believe they _should_ have
by cultural signals like the shmaltz love ballads that permeate the
soundtrack.  Joy (Jane Adams), a single aspiring songwriter, feels she
should have a man and a stable life like her married older sister Trish
(Cynthia Stevenson); Trish, a housewife, feels inferior to sister Helen
(Lara Flynn Boyle), a successful author; Helen, meanwhile, wants a life of
danger to give her writing "authenticity."  Helen's lonely, obscene
phone-calling neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) longs for Helen
while considering her inaccessible, even as he becomes the object of
similar feelings from even lonelier neighbor Kristina (Camryn Manheim).
Solondz fills his world with people who want what they haven't got, never
realizing how much it could cost them.</P>
<P>     Nowhere is that more evident than in HAPPINESS' trickiest character,
Trish's husband Bill (Dylan Baker).  A successful therapist, Bill also
happens to be a pedophile who has unnervingly frank sexual discussions
with his 11-year-old son Billy (Rufus Read) and molests Billy's classmates
during sleepovers.  Baker gives Bill so many layers that he always seems 
human even through his predatory calculation.  His attempt to cajole
Billy's young friend into eating a drugged sandwich is as pathetic as it
is creepy, his parental concern as genuine as it is tainted.  Solondz is
never merely interested in the sensationalistic but trite notion that the
monsters who turn up in headlines are our neighbors.  He wants us to see
the misery of a monster who knows that he's causing pain but can't stop
himself because causing it at least for a moment eases his own.</P>
<P>     It's even more unsettling that Solondz sets Bill at one far end of
a continuum of pain selfishly inflicted in the desperate search for
fulfillment.  Allen humiliates women he calls in an attempt to feel
significant; the sisters' father (Ben Gazzara) abandons his wife in search
of something even another woman can't provide; Joy dumps a boyfriend (a
scathing cameo by Jon Lovitz) who may be a sensitive guy.  There are no
grand enlightenments in HAPPINESS, which may make it seem that Solondz is
simply reveling in the characters' degradation.  The fact is they're
merely deeply flawed, some making small steps towards defining their own
happiness, others too immersed in external definitions to be ready for
those small steps.</P>
<P>     Solondz's one real mis-step -- aside from the unnecessarily long
running time -- involves a murder/rape sub-plot which launches HAPPINESS
into an unnecessarily surreal direction.  The film doesn't need the cheap
laughs from references to cut up body parts in freezer bags, not when it
offers edgy humor that's so much more uncomfortably genuine.  A key scene
in HAPPINESS finds Billy sharing concerns with his father that he's not
"normal" because he may not be maturing sexually as fast as his peers.
It's brutally ironic that he's asking for advice on normalcy from a man
who may be nobody's paradigm of normalcy, but at least he's receiving
reassurance that he's not alone in his confusion.  The paralyzing pursuit
of "normalcy" is what makes so many of the people in HAPPINESS so
unhappy. Solondz turns what could have been a freak show into a
reassurance that we, too, are not alone in being something other than
"normal."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 happy endings:  9.</PRE>
