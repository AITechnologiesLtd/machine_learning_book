<PRE>                                    WOLF
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Jack Nicholson stars in a film that
     tells a very traditional sort of werewolf story and makes no
     attempt to redefine the sub-genre in any way.  Mike Nichols
     thankfully has more plot than special effects, but there is
     not enough here to sink your teeth into.  Rating: low +1 (-4
     to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The Frankenstein monster and the vampire each owe their popularity to a
single novel that captured the public's imagination.  Werewolves are much
more a product of the cinema, however.  The closest there comes to being a
classic werewolf novel that impacted cinema is Guy Endore's WEREWOLF OF
PARIS of 1933.  The first well-remembered werewolf film was 1935's WEREWOLF
OF LONDON.  That and THE WOLFMAN (1941) really were what captured the
public's interest in human-animal shape-shifters.  Since that time there
have probably been only four films that did anything really interesting with
the concept.  Those would be (the flawed but original) WOLFEN (1981),THE
HOWLING (1981), the under-rated CAT PEOPLE (1982), and THE COMPANY OF WOLVES
(1984)--odd that they should all be in the space of four years.  Most other
shape-shifter films followed the same rules with minor variations and said
little new about the condition of being a shape-shifter.  Generally you find
someone bitten by a werewolf, usually someone who is unable to express his
rage, who gets an outlet by turning into an animal and letting rage be
channeled in brutal ways.  Unlike vampires, werewolves usually detest their
condition, but they are powerless to control it.  The condition easily
applies itself to a metaphor for severe mental problems much as vampirism is
often a metaphor for drug addiction.</P>
<P>     Right down this centerline of interpretation with almost no spin on the
ball is WOLF.  Jack Nicholson plays Will Randall, an editor for a leading
publisher who looks for literary merit rather than books that will make a
fast buck.  When his publishing house is taken over by a corporate magnate,
Raymond Alden (played by Christopher Plummer), Randall finds himself being
replaced and given the choice of a bad job or none at all.  The old Will was
a softie who would have stood by and taken it.  However, after being bitten
by a wolf on a back Vermont road, Will feel unexplainedly invigorated and
ready to put up a fight.  What follows is an almost by-the-numbers
amalgamation of elements of WEREWOLF OF LONDON and THE WOLFMAN.  This could
almost be titled THE WOLFMAN OF MANHATTAN.</P>
<P>     This is one film that really could have benefited by being done in
black and white.  Director Mike Nichols occasionally manages an atmospheric
scene, but he is no Paul Schrader and Nichols probably would not have had
the clout to insist on black and white or highly muted colors even if he
wanted to use them.  (Perhaps he could have used a werewolf bite himself!)
He also makes the irritating mistake of showing Wolfman Will's superhuman
leaps in slow motion where they look totally unbelievable.  (With Nichols
directing, listen for a voice cameo by his wife, Elaine May.)</P>
<P>     WOLF features sound in THX, the screen's new abbreviation for "too darn
loud."  The werewolf makeup was the creation the talented Rick Baker, though
here the effect is a bit understated.  Wolf-Nicholson looks like a
Dickensian thug with an underbite.  Nichols probably could have chosen more
elaborate special effects but for once a director did not feel the need to
have elaborate special effects up-staging the actors.  However, perhaps
better effects were needed for animatronic wolves, which do not look
realistic.</P>
<P>     Nicholson is a rather obvious choice for a werewolf since he always
seems to be barely keeping his animal side in check.  Nevertheless as the
book editor with a heart who is always looking out for the interest of his
staff, he is less than totally convincing.  Michelle Pfeiffer is on-hand as
an heiress and a woman who runs (around) with the wolves.  James Spader,
Kate Nelligan, and Christopher Plummer co-star and each give a reasonable
performance.</P>
<PRE>     This is a film that gives all it promises, but little that is new or
novel in the werewolf film.  I rate it a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
