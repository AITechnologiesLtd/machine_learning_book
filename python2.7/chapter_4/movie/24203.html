Running time: 160 minutes.</P>
<P>With hits like The Pirates Of Penzance and HMS Pinafore to
their credit, lyricist William S Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composer
Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) are the toast of London theatre in
the latter half of the 19th century.  But by the mid 1880's the pair
have hit a slump as their creativity dries up.  Their latest musical
comedy Princess Ida receives only lukewarm reviews and audiences stay
away in droves.</P>
<P>Gilbert's lyrics have become repetitive and his ideas stretch
credibility.  Meanwhile Sullivan wants to be taken more seriously and
turn his hand to classical compositions rather than light weight
ditties for low brow burlesque shows.  When he steadfastly refuses to
provide the music for Gilbert's latest piece of "topsy-turvydom",
despite their contractual obligations, the pair reach an impasse that
threatens to destroy their friendship and working partnership.  Then
Gilbert's long-suffering but patient wife Kitty (Lesley Manville)
takes him to an exhibition of Japanese culture.  Suddenly inspiration
strikes, and he sets to work on writing The Mikado, arguably their
most enduring and enjoyable work.</P>
<P>Rather than a straightforward biopic tracing the careers of
Gilbert and Sullivan, Topsy-Turvy is an exploration of the backstage
dramas and creative clashes that went into the making of The Mikado,
with plenty of insight into the world of Victorian theatre This
ambitious but beautifully conceived period piece would seem an
uncharacteristic project for award winning director Mike Leigh, whose
films are normally confronting, bleak contemporary dramas exploring
the plight of the urban working classes (Secrets And Lies, etc).
However, under his skilful direction Topsy-Turvy becomes a
surprisingly colourful, robust and vastly entertaining romp.</P>
<P>In typical Leigh fashion, the director also taps into the
darker side of this world, exploring the insecurities and vanities of
the talented pair, and even briefly glimpsing the lives of their
extraordinary theatrical company.  Sex and drugs also rear their
heads, even in these puritanical times.  With meticulous care, Leigh
brings this world to life.  The costumes, set design and production
values are all magnificent, and reek of authenticity.</P>
<P>The wonderful gallery of characters come to life through the
superb performances of a talented, but largely unknown, ensemble cast
that includes Leigh regular Timothy Spall and Kevin McKidd in key
roles.  In particular, the two leads create a wonderful contrast
between the two collaborators, suffusing the film with a mixture of
humour and pathos.  Broadbent stands out as the stiff, bombastic and
emotionally detached Gilbert, while Corduner does a superb job as the
more liberated, free-spirited but ailing Sullivan.</P>
<P>Although the music may not be to the tastes of today's younger
audiences, the wonderful re-enactments of several scenes from The
Mikado are splendid stuff.  Somewhat surprisingly, Topsy-Turvy's 160
minutes just seem to fly past, without many dull spots to slow the
film down.</P>
