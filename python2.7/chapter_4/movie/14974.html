<P>Canadian director David Cronenberg remakes the original 1958 Vincent
Price semi-classic film and warns all audiences to "Be afraid...be very
afraid." This film was followed by a supposedly lame sequel, FLY II,
starring the omnipresent Eric Stoltz, and directed by the man who won
the "Best Makeup" Oscar for this film, Chris Walas.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Cooky & brainy scientist invents a method of teleportation, wherein a
human being could be transported from one place to another in a matter
of seconds. While testing his own invention, el geeko scientist does
not notice the presence of an insect in his transportation pod, and
soon finds himself fusing into an amalgamate of two living creatures.
Geena Davis plays the roving reporter who begins to follow the story on
the grounds of historical posterity, but ultimately maintains her
interest by the strength of her love.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Creepy, moody, and downright gory science-fiction horror flic that
generates many moments of utter disgust, revulsion, pleasure and
sympathy. This film was wonderfully stylized by Cronenberg, with a true
feel for the life of this poor soul, and the solitude that roomed with
his extreme intelligence. Goldblum seems to have finally found a place
for his stammering acting bit, and works wonderfully as the goofy, and
wildly intelligent, scientist with a plan. He brings caring to the
character, and allows you to give a crap about his future.</P>
<P>This film does actually contain a few extremely graphic scenes of
ickiness (which Mrs. JoBlo could've done without), and worked as a
complete slithering piece of pulp-sci-fiction. Many horror and
science-fiction movies have a tendency to overplay their fiction, while
dismissing the reality check that audiences look for in a credible
film. But this film moves along at a decent pace, always keeps you
informed on what and why everything is going on, and eventually turns
into a wild make-up fest that truly does make you feel and sympathize
with the Goldblum character (The horror, the horror!!).</P>
<P>Having said that, if nachos are your game for this one, I suggest you
salsa down during the first thirty minutes or so, because soon
thereafter, many of the gory scenes make their move. All in all, this
film does still manage to creep you out after all these years, with
kudos going out to Cronenberg's grisly mood setting, Goldblum's kickass
performance, the incredible makeup job and the solid plotline that
makes us all want to believe in this unbelievable scenario set forth by
this man.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Cronenberg has a small cameo in this film as the gynecologist
who delivers a "baby". He also had a small cameo as the "man at the
lake" in Gus Van Sant's TO DIE FOR (6.5/10) starring the ever-white
Nicole Kidman. He has frequent references to ``the flesh'' in his
films, and often uses explicit carnage. 
This film won an Academy Award for "Best Makeup" at the 1987 Oscar
ceremonies.
Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis met on the set of this film, and fell in
love. They got married in 1987, and got divorced in 1990. Jeff stands
6'4 and his middle name is Lynn. Geena stands 6', her real name is
Virginia Davis, she speaks Swedish and is a proud member of MENSA
(Private club gathering smart people with extremely high IQ's.)
Ex-boxer George Chuvalo has a small part as the arm wrestler Marky in
the bar.</P>
