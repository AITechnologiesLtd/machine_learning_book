<PRE>REAR WINDOW (1954)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Writer: John Michael Hayes (from a story by Cornell Woolrich)
Starring: James Stewart, Grace Kelley, Thelma Ritter, Raymond Burr</P>
<P>Watching a movie, viewing a story featuring characters alien to you, is
a lot like voyeurism.  This is what Hitchcock's film, "Rear Window," is
claiming.  And like any bold statement, it backs it up with a suspense
filled story that drawls us, and the protagonists, into its web.  What
results is, in essence, one of the greatest films ever made.  I'm
talking top 10 or 20 here.  Of course, it's from the greatest director
of all time, Alfred Hitchcock, who made, maybe, one bad film in his 50
film career.</P>
<P>Anyway, the film deals with a photographer (James Stewart) who has
wounded himself in an accident and is confined to a wheelchair for a
couple months, whereas he has become pretty much attracted with watching
his neighbors from his back window for hours upon hours, since he has
very little to do.  He names some of the people who do several things,
like naming a woman who lives alone, and suffers a bad date "Miss Lonely
Hearts."</P>
<P>However, one thing he sees is shocking.  He spies on a husband (a young
Raymond Burr) and wife, the latter who has disappeared suddenly.  He
starts to suspect foul play as evidence keeps turning up.  But what can
he do?  He's a voyeur, which is illegal and everything.  But like him,
we're obsessed with the story, which is very intriguing.</P>
<P>Also in his life is his gorgeous girlfriend (Grace Kelley), who he has
come to ignore and put down, since she's not as interesting as watching
the people from his window.  Not until she goes ahead and ventures out
as part of the world from his window, does he take notice.  And when she
comes back, he's infacuated with her.  There's also his physical
therapist (Thelma Ritter), who warns him about the dangers of being a
voyeur, and eventually joins with him and Kelley in their fascinatoin
and obsession with the world from the window.</P>
<P>To be brilliant, Hitchcock shoots the entire film (save a small bit at
the end) from the inside of his apartment, not allowing the viewers to
see the people from any close shots, and with no sound.  We, like
Stewart, are in a seat watching the events form across the way like
we're in a movie theater.  The fact that he's a photographer is also
very intriguing.  This whole film is filled to the brim with symbolism,
so that while we're watching a satisfying suspense/thriller, we're also
intrigued by the meaning of the film.</P>
<P>Unlike "Sliver," this film shows voyeurism in an intelligent light. 
It's fascinating, and the film does not totally condone it.  It can get
us into trouble though, when we start having trouble differentiating the
real world from that of the TV world.  With people watching more and
more TV these days, this film shows us a bunch of sick people who have
an obsession with other people's more fascinating lives.</P>
<P>The acting is, of course, wonderful.  Come on, it's a Hitchcock film. 
Stewart (who sadly passed away recently...but you already knew that) is
awesome as usual.  And Kelley is fantastic, as, well, she always has
been.  She was a gorgeous woman, but she wasn't all just looks, but she
could act too.  And Thelma Ritter almost steals some of her scenes with
Kelley and Stewart.</P>
<P>Did I forget the awesome screenplay?  These characters don't have a lot
to do in terms of action wise.  They're basically watching and talking
about the people they see, kind of like an audience.  And the talking
they do is almost as fascinating as the things that go on in the lives
of the other people.</P>
<P>And, of course, the direction is near-perfect.  Not only does he create
a greatly intriguing film, and give it a great theme and message, but he
doesn't take a negative view of his protagonists, much like what another
lesser director would do.  These people are us, and we're watching
ourselves on screen.  They're just normal people, with a lot of time on
their hands.  Kind of like us, since we're taking 2 hours to watch
this.  If he were to put them down, they'd put us down.  Good man, that
Hitchcock.</P>
<P>I love Hitchcock's films, and this is probably his best work.  I'm not
saying it is, it can be argued it's another one as much as it can be
this one.  But anyway, "Rear Window" is an entertaining masterpiece, a
film of style AND substance.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
