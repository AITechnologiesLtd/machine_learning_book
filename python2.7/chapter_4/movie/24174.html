Screenplay by Roger Rueff; based on his play
Directed by John Swanbeck

<P>A couple of things I've noted in other places about plays adapted to the
big screen, compiled here for the first time: They are "places" where
no-name actors can make a name for themselves if their performance is
great and if the film director can figure out how to make one set
interesting. They are opportunities for star-name actors to stretch
their acting chops with "pure" theater in which the odds are much
bigger. If the director can't make it interesting then the job of the
actors is magnified. Simply, if you walk into a theater thinking you'll
see, in this case, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito "on stage," and you
walk out thinking you've saved $65+ dollars from the cost of a Broadway
ticket, then they have failed. If you walk in to see Space and DeVito
perform and walk out having seen them transform into Larry Mann (Spacey)
and Phil Kooper (DeVito), then you've experience what would be called in
the theater, a "magic" night.</P>
<P>That didn't happen for the two critics (female) behind me, both of whom
admitted in their post screening talk that they didn't like Spacey's
movies, in general. Cranky admits to no such problem and can point with
great specificity to the point at which The Big Kahuna, essentially
three men in a hotel room, made that transformation from stars
performing a play to great acting performances on the screen. The set-up
.. . .</P>
<P>Mann is the salesman. Kooper the account manager. Both have been sent to
a convention in Wichita, Kansas with the intent of meeting, schmoozing
and signing up potential client Dick Fuller, President of a Company
which is the largest user of industrial lubricants in the Midwest. Third
man on the team, representing the research "brains" of the company is
Bob Walker (Peter Facinelli), a just-married, utterly devout Baptist who
has no idea of the kind of land he has wandered in to. The two veterans
snipe at each other like an old married couple and vie for influence
over the new kid. Both have their minds focussed on landing Fuller's
account as they schmooze a roomful of lesser freeloaders. When Fuller
doesn't show, both know that only the teetotaler Walker, who spent the
evening ineptly tending bar and talking about dogs and Jesus to some old
guy, will survive when the ax falls back at the main office.</P>
<P>Dogs and Jesus. A moment of revelation that hits you before it hits the
poor saps onscreen. Walker, with his priorities all in the wrong place,
essentially exits stage left to allow the veterans take full command of
the screen; characters that have been beaten and know they will never
rise higher in the corporate ranks talk grown-up talk about life, the
universe and everything. This third act alone is worth the ticket price
for it is here you sense all the power that you'd get from watching the
men live on stage.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to The Big Kahuna, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$6.50</PRE>
<P>When you're aware that you're watching a play, The Big Kahuna is a
better than average adaptation. When it hits the magic button, well,
that's what it is. Magic.</P>
