<PRE>STOP MAKING SENSE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>For it's 15th anniversary, Jonathan Demme's classic concert film STOP
MAKING SENSE is being re-released with a new print and a remastered
Dolby Digital soundtrack.  Starring David Byrne as well as the other
members of The Talking Heads, the film is certain to delight their fans.
With minimalist staging, lighting and camerawork, the concert
documentary may have a more limited appeal for those who aren't fond of
Byrne's strident singing style.</P>
<P>Older movies with large cult followings are some of the hardest films to
review.  People have already made up their minds about them.  Anything
less than complete praise will be derided by their fans.  And those who
didn't like the movie in the first place probably will not bother to
read the review.</P>
<P>For the record, I've liked a lot of music movies in which the music was
not of the type I normally enjoy.  I've loved rock concert movies
(MESSAGE TO LOVE), rock documentaries (HYPE!) and rock musicals (PINK
FLOYD: THE WALL).  STOP MAKING SENSE, on the other hand, did nothing for
me.</P>
<P>David Byrne is a hyper-energetic singer and dancer.  With his lean,
gangly body, his thin, geekish face and his exaggerated clothing, Byrne
stands out in any crowd.  (He was at our press screening and has changed
little over the years.)  He belts out his songs as if loudness were the
most important attribute of singing.  His aerobic dancing, however, is
mesmerizing.  He walks like a bird, undulates like a wave, jogs like a
yuppie and prances like a boxer.  The guy must be in tip-top shape to
endure his performances, and it is easy to see why he remains so lithe.</P>
<P>"The girls can do it too!" the drummer yells out to start the only
segment not featuring Byrne.  Called the Tom Tom Club, this silly
segment is the film's one attempt at comedy.  Even though I was glad for
a respite from Byrne's voice, I missed his stage antics.</P>
<P>The movie, filmed at a live concert, consists of a rapid succession of
songs without breaks.  If you like them, you will probably feel like a
kid in a candy shop, in which the owner says you have an hour and a half
to eat all the candy you want.  And if you don't like the songs, the
film can sometimes feel like living next door to a neighbor who plays
loud, harsh music that filters through your walls even when you have the
windows shut tight.  Luckily, Byrne's high spirits and undeniable
charisma offers something for everyone.</P>
<P>STOP MAKING SENSE runs 1:28.  It is rated PG and has nothing to offend
any age.</P>
