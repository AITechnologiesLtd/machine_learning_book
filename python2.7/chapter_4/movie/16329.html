<P>   "Gloria" is a lot like "Guys and Dolls," one of the great
musicals ever produced on Broadway, a hit that captures the
characters andthe vernacular of its thoroughly urban Damon
Runyon characters.  While the songs are terrific, it's not the
sort of musical you'd expect to find in theater revivals simply
because treating gangsters as Runyonesque eccentricities
and displaying the likes of Adelaide, its frequently jilted moll,
is pass‚.   So why update "Gloria," the moderately amusing
Cassavetes film of some two decades ago, when that story is
based as well on the Runyonesque personalities?  From the
looks of the picture, it's Sidney Lumet's showcase for Sharon
Stone, who turned in a terrific performance against type as
the cuddly mom of a terminally ill child in the otherwise
mundane "The Mighty."  The plot is by now so hoary that we
go to the show to see another aspect of Stone, whose New
York kind of nervousness can remind you of Jane Fonda's
performance in Neil Simon's "California Suite" but who simply
does not come across like any modern New Yorker you may
know.  In "Gloria" the tough-talking, impertinent urban woman
learns something about herself.  She may have always
thought, "What's the point" about kids--just as Kevin Kline
figured about dogs in "Fierce Creature"--but after she
undergoes an oreal with an orphaned tot, her mushy heart
says otherwise.</P>
<P>   Sharon Stone inhabits the role of Gloria, just out of a three-
year term in a Miami prison for taking the rap for her
gangster boy friend, Kevin (Jeremy Northam).  When one of
the mobsters in the gang wipes out most of a Hispanic family
to recover a diskette loaded with names of the crime family's
beneficiaries, Gloria winds up the unwilling caretaker of the
surviving son, six-year-old Nicky (Jean-Luke Figueroa). 
Realizing that the Irish-American criminals will kill the boy to
get the tape, she becomes perplexed for the first time in her
life.  Never mind her overblown, Hell's-Kitchen-inspired
appearance--long curly blond hair which makes her almost
unrecognizable, skin-tight dress, spike-heeled shoes and
utterly unmaternal attitude.  She's vulnerable: stuck with the
kid, responsible for keeping him alive.  To do so she must
negotiate with her ex-boy friend Kevin and especially with the
mob's leader, Ruby (George C. Scott), who still carries a
torch for the much younger beauty.</P>
<P>  To go to the source of this tale, return to 1934,
to the first version of Damon Runyon's tale "Little Marker," as
a bookie played by Adolphe Menjou is reformed together with
his whole New York City gambling colony by the adorable
little Shirley Temple.  Little Jean-Luke Figueroa as Nicky is in
no way as appealing as Ms. Temple, however.  He simply
does not exude the charm, the personality, the "it" but rather
comes across as bland and all-too-accepting of the radical
changes taking place in his life.  Sharon Stone is a proper
mixture of goofiness, durability and disorientation.  She
retains a Noo Yawk accent more successfully than Jeremy
Northam hides his elegant British enunciation, and fleshes
out the role of the title figure well enough.  But the rest of the
cast is simply not up to her achievement.  Not even the great
George C. Scott as an aging gunman with a soft spot in his
heart can win our sympathy, and the plot is too stale to churn
up much interest.  "Gloria" is a surprisingly uneventful movie,
not the sort of drama you'd expect from Lumet who has
riveted us in the past with intense, resonant productions like
"The Pawnbroker," "Dog Day Afternoon," and "Serpico.</P>
