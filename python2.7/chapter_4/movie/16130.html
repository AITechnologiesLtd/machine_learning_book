<P>When Gods and Monsters ended, I was confused.  I wasn't confused by the
film, but by the fact that I was unmoved by a story that should be
moving, and by a performance that rates among the best of the year.  The
performance to which I refer comes courtesy of Ian McKellen, who plays
James Whale, the director famous for such films as Frankenstein, Bride
of Frankenstein, and Show Boat.  Apparently, he's also famous for being
a homosexual.  Written and directed by Bill Condon, Gods and Monsters is
a film with immense potential.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it's also a conglomerate of missed opportunities.  Much
of the film is played for laughs, but not enough of it is taken
seriously to the point where we can identify with any of the
characters.  The moments that are serious are so straight-faced that
they seem to stick out, colliding with the playful tone that wants to
overtake the film.  McKellen's performance is a revelation -- it makes
the entire movie worth watching.  But it's one of those movies that
makes you wonder what it would have been without the masterful central
performance.  </P>
<P>Condon doesn't provide a very strong narrative; this seems to be his
intention, but the result is going to be a plot synopsis that doesn't
sound like much:  the film centers around the very-homosexual Whale in
his later years, living in a nice home with his housekeeper (Lynn
Redgrave), spying on young, muscular men who come to work on his house.  </P>
<P>The man who catches his eye is the very-heterosexual Clay Boone
(Brendan Fraser), a young go-nowhere type who finds Whale interesting
but not sexually desirable.  Whale wants to paint Clay's portrait, and,
because he's curious, Clay agrees.  From that point, the two men begin
an interesting platonic relationship.  Along the way, we see numerous
flashbacks to Whale's memories of World War I and to his days making
movies in Hollywood.  </P>
<P>The first thing I found disarming about Gods and Monsters is Condon's
use of flashbacks.  I find flashbacks distracting in general, although
they are sometimes appropriate when used in a non-intrusive manner.  The
problem with the flashbacks here is that they come at the worst time --
in one scene, Whale is telling Clay about the war as he paints his
portrait; McKellen's acting here is wonderful and intense.  But, just
when I was getting drawn into the moment, a flashback jostled me out of
it.  Most of the memories that are explained by flashbacks would have
been more effective as dialogue.  I did, however, like the scenes that
show Whale's passion as a director -- I think that side of him is
necessary.</P>
<P>What makes the entire film worth everyone's effort is McKellen's
performance.  There's something about watching a seasoned, experienced
actor play in a role that has so many levels as this one.  Whale is an
interesting character -- one of the more interesting layers is the
contrast between his service in the military and his active
homosexuality during that time.  McKellen nails the role without being
too flamboyant; you can see how much fun he's having in just about every
scene.  Of course, there are a few heavy moments -- the conclusion has
little space for laughs, but McKellen never lets us down.  I was also
impressed with Brendan Fraser, who is vastly suitable for this role; he
has that dumbfounded look to accompany the crew cut and perfectly square
body.</P>
<P>The real problem with the film is that it just isn't very engaging. 
The flashbacks are one problem, but it also doesn't give us a whole lot
to latch on to.  The performances are more enlightening than Condon's
script, which is based on the novel Father of Frankenstein by
Christopher Bram.  The ending, too, is anticlimactic;  I can not say why
without giving it away, but I can say that I wasn't sure what the
characters were supposed to have learned from their experiences.  What
Gods and Monsters comes down to is this:  there may be potential in the
story of the homosexual director James Whale, but Bill Condon's version
of it doesn't seem to find much of it.  But thanks to Ian McKellen, it's
still worth seeing.  Funny how that works.</P>
