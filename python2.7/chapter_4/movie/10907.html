<PRE>Evil Dead 2 (1987)
* * * 1/2
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1998 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: The funniest horror movie ever made; a melange of Dario Argento and
Wile E. Coyote.</P>
<P>EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is the result of an unstable fusion of Warner
Bros. cartoon slapstick and _giallo_ horror-movie conventions. It's a flick
with the mind of a splatter film and the heart of a Mack Sennett two-reeler.
In plain, non-fanboy language, it's a ton of disgusting fun. Example: A
monster of the undead rises from the cellar, only to have its head smashed
in the trapdoor. Its eyeball pops out and flies into the mouth of one of the
three screaming girls in the movie. GULP.</P>
<P>The plot, what there is of it, is simple to the point of irrelevancy. A
young man and his girlfriend head out to an abandoned cabin for a romantic
interlude, and unwittingly unleash the evil undead. The girl dies horribly
and the man (square-jawed Bruce Campbell) lives -- but as what? Horrendous
mutations strike him like epileptic fits. The dead rise out of their graves
and inflict ghastly punishments and tortures on him. His own hand rebels
against him (and the punishment he exacts on it is howlingly painful).</P>
<P>The majority of the movie is one long, roaring blast of slime, guts, special
effects and ear-drilling sound effects, but it's put together in a way that
gets more than a fair amount of good laughs. EVIL DEAD 2 is most likely
*the* item that started the whole trend of sly, self-referential horror
movies (culminating, of course, in the brilliantly nasty SCREAM), although
it's a lot more freakish and far-out.</P>
<PRE>The film gets a little predictable towards the end, which is kind of sad. If
the whole movie had moved with the manic inventiveness of the first thirty
minutes, we would have really had something here. But as it stands, it's
more than enough to, uh, turn a few heads. And the ending is *really* off
the wall, if that's any additional <A HREF="mailto:compensation.<HR>syegul@ix.netcom.com">compensation.<HR>syegul@ix.netcom.com</A>                                       EFNet IRC: GinRei
