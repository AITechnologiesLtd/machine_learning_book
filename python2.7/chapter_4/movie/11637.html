<P>Billy Crystal is one of the top standup comedians.  Despite his
boyish demeanor he has been around a long time.  In recent years no
one has been better as Master of Ceremonies of the Oscars than he.
How then explain that he wrote the story, along with David Seltzer
(who did the screenplay) of this one note boring movie?     An
essential attribute of every comic is timing.  How then explain that
he did not see (in his capacity as producer) that the director was
dragging his tail in this very slow-moving film.</P>
<P> As an agent, Sammy (Billy Crystal) has been almost always
unsuccessful. Opening scene is of him driving his car in Romania
looking for talent he can sign up.   Did it have to take what seemed
like a half hour of driving and voice over before he finally came
across Max, a 7'7" giant (Gheorghe Muresan) ("He can play 8' if he
has to.").    Max is happy as a caretaker living in a monastery but
he longs for his long gone girlfriend Lillianna (Joanna Pacula) who
for the past 22 years has resided in New Mexico.   New Mexico?  22
years ago?  What kind of story is this?</P>
<P> When Sammy convinces Max that he will be made into a movie star if
he goes to America with Sammy, the giant jumps at the chance.   Let
us spare you any more of the story.  Suffice it to say that Max was
mean and selfish to entice the giant to leave his homeland but
before the film ends, he realizes he has been a scoundrel and
changes into a good human being.   Give me a break.   Sounds like
Amateur Night.</P>
<P> Others who contribute (but not much)  to this lost cause are
Kathleen Quinlan as Sammy's wife, and Zane Carney as their son.</P>
