<PRE>                             MURIEL'S WEDDING
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A homely young woman with
          questionable values learns some self esteem in a
          plot with some unexpected twists, but which is
          ultimately quite predictable.  Writer}director
          P. J. Hogan takes some chances of alienating
          viewers from Muriel's character.  Rating: high +1
          (-4 to +4) text</PRE>
<P>     Reminiscent of British comedy/dramas of the 60s, particularly
GEORGY GIRL, the Australian MURIEL'S WEDDING tells the story of a
misfit finding self-esteem.  And while the film takes a lot of
unexpected turns along the way, its ultimate destination is obvious
from the beginning.</P>
<P>     Muriel (Toni Collette) is an over-weight and ungainly young woman
with absolutely no fashion sense.  Her home is the Australian town of
Porpoise Spit--I kid you not.  The clique of snooty school chums whom
Muriel considers her friends ostracize her for just being too frumpy to
be in their exalted presence.  Muriel gets little emotional support at
home from one of the ugliest families we have seen in film in a long
while, headed by an overly critical and unsupportive father (Bill
Hunter).  Our sympathies at first are with Muriel, but soon we find her
repeatedly stealing, first to have a dress to wear to a wedding and
then in order to be able to take a vacation with the women she
considers her friends--without their consent, incidentally.  On the
vacation Muriel discovers the vivacious and instantly likable Rhonda
(Rachel Griffiths), actually an old school friend, who strikes up an
unexpected close friendship with Muriel.  Much like the relationship in
HEAVENLY CREATURES, the very differences in their personality types
binds the two young women together.  But though the two form a solid
platonic relationship, events would soon take place that would place
heavy demands on that friendship.</P>
<P>     MURIEL'S WEDDING was written and directed by P. J. Hogan, her--
admittedly I am assuming it is a her--first such effort.  And it shows
in the freshness and the feel for unexpected situations in Hogan's
writing.  If this film were made in America, Muriel would likely be
written as an entirely sympathetic character.  Ironically, sympathetic
characters in American films live either apparently entirely moral
lives or are rebels and live entirely outside the law.  Of course in
life there are a lot of people who are in the gray area being mostly
honest and decent, but who would steal a little here or there and maybe
cheat on their taxes just a bit if they thought they could get away
with it.  That is the sort of person Muriel is.  People in her world
blame each other for their own shortcomings.</P>
<P>     Muriel's love of slightly tacky ABBA songs, matching her
questionable taste in clothing, is reflected Peter Best's score which
relies heavily on ABBA songs and a score that relies heavily on
dramatic variations on ABBA melodies.  As the Australians do so well,
this is not so much a good film but a clever reworking of a cliched
plot.  It takes several unexpected turns, but ends up where everyone
knew it was going all along.  I give it a high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
