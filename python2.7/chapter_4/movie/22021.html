<PRE>THREE KINGS
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1999 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        It's March 1991, George Bush is in the White House, the Gulf War
has just ended, and nobody--least of all the weathered U.S. forces who roam
the arid, alien landscapes of Iraq--has a clue as to why it even started.</P>
<P>        Prior to the ceasefire, Saddam Hussein has appropriated and
stockpiled anything of value, creating mountains of limousines, Cuisinarts,
and mobile phones.  Into this scene come four downtrodden GIs (played by
George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jonze; I guess "Four
Kings" didn't quite have the same biblical bent) who are about to see their
first real taste of action.</P>
<P>        Thus begins David O. Russell's "Three Kings," a post-Persian War
war satire framed around a hunt for stolen Kuwaiti gold that would have
John Wayne shifting uncomfortably in his army fatigues.  Unlike the Duke's
'rah-'rah action films, there's an innate pessimism that pervades "Three
Kings"; Russell's screenplay (from an original story by John Ridley) is
most effective in chronicling the randomness of war and the absurd
situations it creates, much in the spirit of Mike Nichols' splendid
"Catch-22" from 1970.</P>
<P>        Take the surreal scene in which NBS reporter Adriana Cruz (a
surprisingly effective Nora Dunn) laments over the ecological aftereffects
of man's absolute folly at a watering hole littered with helpless,
oil-soaked pelicans.  Although deftly played for laughs, it's a difficult
scene to stomach.</P>
<P>        That's true of a lot of the film.  In his thirst for satire,
Russell will occasionally go overboard in his graphic depiction of the
brutality of war--witness Wahlberg's torture at the hands of a Republican
Guardsman.  But for the most part, Russell's sleeve-worn political
viewpoint and disturbed visual style--a frenzied motif of grainy, hand-held
camerawork that's almost monochromatic in its starkness--cuts to the core.</P>
<P>        "Three Kings" further showcases the director's ability to work
something uniquely rich and extraordinary from material that has been
visited many times before.  In a number of ways this film shows a logical
maturation over his previous two directorial efforts, "Spanking the Monkey"
and "Flirting with Disaster."  He's certainly working with a much bigger
budget this time around, but continues to wring strong performances from
his leading players.</P>
<P>        Ultimately it's the director's confidence behind the camera that
makes "Three Kings" a powerful piece of filmmaking--as dry, bleak, and
brutal as the barren Iraqi desert.</P>
