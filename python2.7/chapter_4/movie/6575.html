<PRE>                                    MOTHER
                        Copyright 1996 D & S Associates</PRE>
<P>In albert Brooks' latest film, "Mother", science fiction writer John
Henderson (Brooks), suffering from two failed marriages and a severe
case of writer's block, decides to confront his demons - one of whom
may be his mother!</P>
<P>John sets out to find his true self and disprove the old adage, "You
can't go home, again," when he decides to move back home with his
mother, Beatrice, played by Debbie Reynolds. John feels his mother is
the key to what went wrong with his life and career.</P>
<P>What John discovers is unexpected by both him and Beatrice.</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Aside from a wonderful performance by Debbie Reynolds in the title
role, I didn't find the premise of "Mother" to be particularly
compelling. Brooks' character John is very flat, with little
development over the course of the film. He starts as a schlemeil, he
ends as a schlemiel with a date.</P>
<P>Debbie Reynolds, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film
and give a terrific performance and a decent character study of
Beatrice. She displays the kind of logic and sense that only a mother
can show. That's the strength of her performance - she reps all moms
to some degree. Reynolds als develops Beatrice all through the movie,
so, by the end, she is a complete different person, in your eye, than
at the start. This is mainly through the strength of the actor. I look
forward to her getting notice.</P>
<P>This is the least manic of Brooks' films, seeming that he has some
sort of internal ax to grind than audience entertainment as the goal
of the film.</P>
<P>I can't recommend seeing "Mother" at the theater, unless you take your
mother! Otherwise, leave it for video rental or cable.</P>
<P>I give "Mother" a C+, and loved Debbie.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Debbie Reynolds makes an amazingly impressive comeback after 27 years
as the title character of Albert Brooks' thoroughly amusing and
easily-identified-with "Mother".</P>
<P>Albert Brooks is John Henderson, the older of Beatrice's two sons.
His brother Jeff (Rob Morrow) is unusually close to his mother and
John feels he's much less liked.  After his second divorce, Sci-fi
writer John decides to go live with Mom for a while to discover if the
basis their relationship is why he can't connect with women.  The
mother he discovers is an eye-opener!</P>
<P>Brooks not only stars, but also wrote and directed.  His screenplay is
thoughtful, poignant and funny and his direction compliments the
production. Brooks' adventures with Mom include a visit to her 'food
museum' where ice crystals 'protect' the shebert and cheese comes in
frozen 3 lb. blocks, grocery shopping with strongly conflicting
economical philosophies and having Mom tell complete strangers his
life story everywhere they go.</P>
<P>Debbie Reynolds' performance is Oscar nomination calibre.  She
manages to appear rather clueless when she, in fact, is independent,
modern and artistic - the wonderful thing about the subtlety of her
acting is that you completely accept the her hidden capabilities and
talents as they're revealed.  Brooks is fine as the slightly pathetic
John.  Rob Morrow gives his best big screen performance as the whiny
mummy's boy who's initially presented as a successful sports agent and
eventually revealed as a selfish, needy child.</P>
<P>Go see "Mother" and I suspect you'll see something of yourself.</P>
