<PRE>                           GROSSE POINTE BLANK
                       A film review by Steve Kong
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>I saw the trailers for Grosse Pointe Blank and wondered what this movie could 
possible be about. And I think most people felt the same. The trailer does the 
movie no good. Grosse Pointe Blank is a movie that cannot be easily 
categorized. There is no a single genre that can describe Grosse Pointe Blank.</P>
<P>Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is a professional hitman. He is going through a 
life crisis. He is tired of his profession and is unsure of what he really is. 
By coincident, his next hit job is in his hometown and this tenth high school 
reunion also being held. Blank insists that he not go to the reunion. But with 
a little convincing from his office manager (Joan Cusack) and his fearful 
therapist (Alan Arkin), he agrees to do the hit job and to attend the reunion. 
Blank's hesitation to go to the reunion stems from what happened ten years ago 
during his senior prom. He left his girlfriend, Debi stranded, and unable to 
go go to the prom. Debi is played by the beautiful Minnie Driver. A funny 
subplot about a competing hitman trying to start a Union for hitmen unfolds 
during the movie.</P>
<P>The meat of Grosse Pointe Blank is a love story, and to a point, redemption 
story. Blank wants to get redemption from that one night when he stood Debi 
up. But she wants him to earn it. Along with this love story is a comedy that 
includes Dan Aykroyd as the opposing hitman trying to start the Hitmen's 
Union, two FBI guys, a therapist who feels threatened by Blank, and all of the 
people of Grosse Pointe. At one point Blank tells Debi's father that he is a 
professional hitman, the reply he gets is, "Good for you, growth industry." 
Then there is the action, and at times highly violent, portion of the film. I 
found this portion to be as well done as the previous two, but some may find 
this portion to be a turn off. With all of these different genres in the same 
film, the obvious question would be: Do the work together well? Yes, they work 
really well.</P>
<P>John Cusack, who is one of the four writers of this movie, gives a good 
performance of Martin Q Blank. Blank, who is the only sane character in this 
movie. Minnie Driver, although good in the movie, gives a flat dull 
performance as Debi.  I enjoyed the performances of Dan Aykroyd as the 
opposing hitman, and Alan Arkin as the threatened therapist.  Dan Aykroyd 
looks to be having the time of his life in this movie.  Arkin gives a 
wonderfully off-beat performance.</P>
<P>A special mention for Grosse Pointe Blank is it's soundtrack. The soundtrack 
is filled with 80's music and is a real joy. The soundtrack fits in well with 
the movie.</P>
<P>Grosse Pointe Blank is a quirky movie the defies categorization. It has a 
great mix of attitude and quirky dialog.  This makes for a fun movie that is 
enjoyable and well worth the money to see.</P>
