<PRE>TOKYO-GA (1985)</PRE>
<PRE>        3 out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>        With Chishu Ryu, Yuharu Atsuta, Werner Herzog;
        Written & Directed by Wim Wenders;
        Cinematography by Ed Lachman</PRE>
<P>        TOKYO-GA has been called a film "diary," but it might be more apt
to call it a scrapbook.  It is an assortment of images, clips, reflections,
and interviews assembled by Wim Wenders during a trip to Tokyo.  The
impetus for the trip, as described by Wenders himself, is to see whether
the Tokyo--and by extension the Japan--captured so precisely in the films
of Yasujiro Ozu still exists.  Wenders holds Ozu in the highest esteem: he
describes the revered Japanese director's oeuvre as the closest thing to a
"sacred treasure" in the cinema.</P>
<P>        The documentary was made in between two of Wenders's great works,
PARIS, TEXAS and WINGS OF DESIRE.  TOKYO-GA is a much more low-key,
personal work, although it has the same sense of introspection and
haphazardness that distinguishes the two fiction features.  It represents,
very deliberately, an attempt to wed Wenders's own style with that of Ozu;
to emphasise the point, TOKYO-GA is framed by the beginning and ending of
Ozu's most famous film, TOKYO STORY.  Wenders remarks at one point that
movies should be made the way we open our eyes: they should attempt simply
to see what is real, rather than trying to prove a point.  He believes that
Ozu's films achieve this goal, and his documentary is an attempt to do the
same.</P>
<P>        The movie is in effect a rather shapeless series of digressions and
anecdotes, connected tenuously by the twinned themes of Tokyo and Ozu.  It
is filtered through Wenders's own preoccupations with cinema and the ways
it can both reveal and distort truth.  He moves according to his whims from
one sequence of images to another, punctuating them with his thoughts on
the nature of representation, which tend to be less compelling than the
representations themselves.</P>
<P>        Although it is tedious on occasion--no one will ever accuse Wenders
of using overly short takes--there are many pleasures to be had from his
observations of Japan.  An extended series of images of Japanese
businessmen playing pachinko goes on for too long, but other moments are
humorous, human, and fascinating.  Members of the "Tokyo Rockabilly Club"
perform Elvis impersonations in a park; a mother tries to cope with a
petulant child in a subway station; ranks of people practice their golf
stroke on a driving range atop a skyscraper; children play baseball on a
cemetery path overhung with cherry blossom.</P>
<P>        It is in this sampling of everyday peculiarities that Wenders seeks
insight into contemporary Japan, circa 1985.  There is no attempt to
investigate broad social, political, and economic trends.   And his method
is effective: he succeeds in capturing, obliquely, something of the
paradoxes which underlie Japanese society, the marriage of Western fashions
to Eastern idiosyncracies.  There are also interviews with former
colleagues of Ozu: his cinematographer, his assistant director, the actor
Chishu Ryu.  All regard the late director with a sense of humility and
respect bordering on awe; one refers to him as a "king."</P>
<P>        Despite the evident fondness and open-hearted curiousity with which
Wenders approaches all he encounters, there is an air of studied detachment
to TOKYO-GA which tends to distance the viewer.  The feeling is not helped
by Wenders's laconic, unimpassioned voice-overs.  The notable exception,
and almost certainly the most affecting incident in the movie, is an
interview with Ozu's former assistant director, who, after lengthy
reminiscence, is overcome by emotion at the memory of his mentor, and
tearfully thanks Wenders and asks him to leave, turning away from the
camera in embarassment.  It is here, for the first time, that we really
sense the passion that Ozu and his movies inspire in people.</P>
<P>        At one point, Wenders meets fellow German director Wernor Herzog.
Standing on the observation ring of Tokyo Tower, backdropped by the city's
seemingly infinite skyline, a monument to the bewildering complexity of
human achievement, Herzog proclaims his belief that there are few "pure"
images left in the world and one must go to great lengths to find them, and
he would like to go into space for this purpose.  Wenders acknowledges
Herzog's point, but tells us that in Tokyo he finds all the "pure" images
he needs.</P>
<P>        TOKYO-GA thus becomes a refutation of Herzog's argument: "pure"
images are everywhere, if you can find them, and Wenders can.  Perhaps the
most remarkable are discovered during his trip to a factory that
manufactures the mouthwatering artificial dishes displayed in the windows
of Japanese restaurants.  These representations of food are, at a distance,
indistinguishable from the real thing.  Wenders finds men assembling the
imitation dishes with care and precision, consulting blueprints as they
construct each one.  It is a task which seems surreal at first--more effort
is spent on the fake food than would be on cooking the actual meal--but
Wenders takes the time to show us the craft with which the men perform
their labour.  Indeed, it is not surprising that he is sympathetic to their
efforts. What they are doing, after all, is approximating the real by means
of the artificial--like Ozu, like Wenders, like cinema.</P>
