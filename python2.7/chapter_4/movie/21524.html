<P> House on Haunted Hill (1999) 1 star out of 4. Starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye
Diggs and Peter Gallagher.</P>
<P>Why do filmmakers always feel that by adding color, gore and high-tech
special effects they can improve on old movies?</P>
<P>Case in point, the current dreadful remake of "House on Haunted Hill."</P>
<P> Up front, I will admit to a prejudice. The William Castle original is one
of my favorite childhood memories. I fondly recall sitting in the theater
watching Vincent Price ham it up on the screen, and listening to others -
but not me, of course - scream when the phony skeleton came flying down
from the rafters.</P>
<P>That was Emergo, Castle's gimmick to lure audiences to the theaters. We all
knew it was phony, but it was fun.</P>
<P>And that is what is missing from this lame remake. As hard as it tries,
it's not fun. The spirit of tongue-in-cheek, winking at the audience has
all but disappeared.</P>
<P> Oh, star Geoffrey Rush tries hard. Adorned with a pencil-thin mustache and
given the name Stanley Price, he is supposed to be a walking homage to the
great Vincent.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. Rush - Oscar or no Oscar - I knew Vincent Price - having the
privilege of twice interviewing him - and you are no Vincent Price.</P>
<P>This remake starts off promising, with a gruesome prologue that explains
how the house on haunted hill earned its reputation.</P>
<P>>From there we meet the bickering Prices who have as much love for each
other as Jesse Helms and Carol Mosley-Braun.</P>
<P>But once the movie shifts focus to the haunted mansion, it becomes nothing
but a series of chases as the various guests - none of whom are known by
either Price, nor do they know who invited them - merely run, gasp, scream,
shout and die.</P>
<P>The guests - including Taye Diggs and Peter Gallagher - are merely types,
and we really don't give a damn what happens to any of them.</P>
<P> If you want to have a really good time, forget this insult to William
Castle and rent the original. It's hokey, it's corny, but at least it has a
spark of life.</P>
