<PRE>Elizabeth</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Shekhar Kapur.</PRE>
<P>Starring: Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston,
Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough.</P>
<P>Well, everything good you've heard about Elizabeth is true. It's a
visually stunning movie with the most incredible performances
from everyone involved. This is definitely a masterpiece with only
one or two minor quibbles. Most certainly something that must be
viewed on the big screen. </P>
<P>Cate Blanchett, as everyone has noted, is magnificent in the role of
Elizabeth. She's fun, she's haughty, she's naive, she's strong at all
the right times, making an Elizabeth who's believable and
sympathetic while at the some time being something of a hero. </P>
<P>And Geoffrey Rush is the best I've ever seen him, with perhaps the
exception of A Little Bit of Soul. His Walsingham is a wonderful
mentor for Elizabeth, with the ruthlessness necessary to get the job
done. Similarly, Christopher Eccleston and Joseph Fiennes play their
roles magnificently. I had a minor problem with Richard
Attenborough, mainly because I feel he plays the exact same role,
no matter what movie he's in. As I watched him in Elizabeth, I kept
having visions of the guy who owned Jurassic Park! </P>
<P>The biggest problem I have with this film is a problem inherent
with almost all historical movies: what is truth? To tell a good
story, often facts need to be manipulated, or extra people added.
Douglas Adams once said that he never got his books from real life
because although real life provides interesting little incidents, it
rarely produces a beginning, a middle and an end. So, for Elizabeth,
choices need to be made as to what to show and what to leave out;
which bits of the life of Elizabeth are going to make up the movie;
what is the beginning, the middle and the end? Similarly, if
Elizabeth is our hero, who is our villain? </P>
<P>Elizabeth makes Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston) and the Catholic
Church the villain. While not arguing with the atrocities committed
by the Catholic Church in that and many other eras, this movie
suggests very strongly that any evil our heros did, they were driven
to by villainy of others. My history of this period is not good enough
to know for certain, but I doubt that Elizabeth was quite as
blameless as shown. I imagine it would be possible to make a
movie of the life of Norfolk, making him a hero and Elizabeth the
villain if we make different choices about what to show. </P>
<P>While on the topic of historical accuracy, one wonders whether
there were quite so many tall, willowy females in the court of
Queen Elizabeth. </P>
<P>Also, at times, the music threatened to swallow us all. There were
moments in the film when a less strident approach would have
been more suited to the moment. Any time where I notice the
music in a way that distracts from whatever is happening on the
screen is a bad music moment for me - and there were half a
dozen such moments in Elizabeth. </P>
<P>Be warned, however, this is not a Jane Austen period drama; this is
very gory stuff. The opening scene, for me, was the worst, more in
tone than gore. It begins with three people being burnt alive at the
stake. Very horrific. Later scenes of heads on sticks, slashed throats,
beatings, all contribute to a very dark mood for Elizabeth, matching
probably the mood of the times. If you can stomach the
gruesomeness of this move, I wholeheartedly recommend it. </P>
