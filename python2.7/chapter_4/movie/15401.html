<PRE>_Enemy_of_the_State_ (R) *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Anyone who thinks that the key to Will Smith's big-screen success lies
solely on his attitude and charisma will be proven wrong once and for all
by his work in Tony Scott's smart, stylish thriller.  Aside from a handful
of wry wisecracks delivered in the early going, Smith's Robert Clayton Dean
is a straight arrow, a labor attorney who is hunted down by some shady
government types after coming into possession of a videotape of a
congressman's (Jason Robards) murder.  Dean has trouble evading his
pursuers--and their high-tech surveillance equipment--until an equally
shady former NSA agent (Gene Hackman) arrives on the scene to offer some
reluctant help.</P>
<P>As amusing as Hackman and his riff on his character in _The_Conversation_
is, it is with his first appearance (which doesn't come until about an hour
in, if not more) that _Enemy_of_the_State_'s tightly coiled tension begins
to unravel somewhat; there is much more suspense when Dean, a common man
with no combat skills or the like, is called on to evade government
professionals solely on his wits.  But on the whole, David Marconi's script
is solid, intelligently bringing up realistic issues regarding privacy
while serving the slam-bang thrills required of any Jerry Bruckheimer
production.  Pulling the entire enterprise together is Scott, who uses his
large bag of dazzling visual tricks in good service to the plot; and Smith.
 He paints a vivid portrait of paranoia and fear, and his natural presence
and rapport with the audience is invaluable in creating a likable character.</P>
