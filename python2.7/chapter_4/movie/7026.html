<PRE>                              BLOOD AND WINE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Two crooks plan to steal a million-
          dollar diamond necklace, but having the necklace is
          one thing, holding on to it is something else.
          This is a violent and often bloody but low-key
          crime story set in grimy, sweaty, muggy South
          Florida.  The plot is tangled without being
          difficult either to follow or to believe.  Jack
          Nicholson and Michael Caine nicely outdo each other
          as slimeball thieves in the humid and sometimes
          sexy crime story.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     These days crime films seem to have spectacular gun-fights, big
explosions, crazed madmen, and, of course, tense car chases though
metropolitan centers.  The films go for the spectacular, roller-coaster
experience.  And the characters are bigger than life.  You cannot get
much better a feel for what has happened to the crime film than to
compare the original CAPE FEAR with its high-tech remake.  Explosive
film-making has replaced gritty little crime films.  One misses the
low-key crime dramas like the original CAPE FEAR.  Occasionally there
is a throwback like THE GRIFTERS, but they are all too few.  BLOOD AND
WINE has the feel of a John D. MacDonald novel from the 50s.  The
characters are smallish and petty, but they are believable and except
for perhaps its complexity, the story is believable also.</P>
<P>     Alex Gates (played by Jack Nicholson) runs a Southern Florida wine
store and in his spare time cheats on his wife Suzanne (Judy Davis).
Both Suzanne and his son Jason (Stephen Dorff) have had their fill of
him and the marriage is in its last stages.  Alex is fooling around
with the Gabrielle (Jennifer Lopez) the nanny of a rich customer, but
he also has his eye on that same customer's safe where he believes
there to be a diamond necklace worth over a million dollars.  To get
the necklace Alex has to go into partnership with Victor (Michael
Caine), a tubercular safecracker who might well just be using Alex.
This is not a very tightly-knit little group at the best of times and
add to the mixture a necklace with "diamonds the size of chocolates"
and the bonds of family and friendship may be totally forgotten.</P>
<P>     The film revolves around five characters, but the heart is
Nicholson and Caine, of course.  In a sense they are playing much the
same character, suddenly-violent, constantly-vile.  Caine plays the
British version of the character, Nicholson the American.  Bob Rafelson
has directed Nicholson before, in fact he was largely responsible for
Nicholson becoming a respected actor with FIVE EASY PIECES (1970) and
THE KING OF MARVIN GARDENS (1972).  It has been suggested that the
three films form a pattern with Nicholson playing a son in the first, a
brother in the second, and now playing a father.  There does not seem
to be a whole lot of connection beyond that.  To Nicholson's and
Caine's characters the greasy lowlife life-style comes naturally, but
Judy Davis seems to be someone who was once decent, but in self-defense
has been pushed to become the same sort of violent person her husband
is.  Significantly even after she has escaped the control of her
husband she is attracted to another man with many of the same
characteristics.  Her performance could easily be overlooked playing
against the two scheming greaseballs, but she does a nice job at
playing a no longer very nice person.  Jennifer Lopez is attractive and
reasonably convincing, but her thick Cuban accent obscures some of her
lines.  Stephen Dorff is nominally the main character.  But his
performance is the least textured of the five major characters.</P>
<P>     As films go today, this was probably a fairly low-budget one.  In
the realistic crime story style the characters use golf clubs against
each other rather than dynamite.  If there are explosions they are ones
of sudden anger.  This was a good role for Nicholson and a better one
for Caine.  The production values are decent, though I would swear
Nicholson's black eye comes and goes from scene to scene.  Other
continuity errors have been reported also, though I did not catch them.
This is a small film and one that works not on photography or
pyrotechnics, but in acting and script.  As such it may be a sort of
nostalgic reminder of the days when that went without saying.  This is
not a major film but it is watchable and at times tense.  I would give
it a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
