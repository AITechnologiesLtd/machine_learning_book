<PRE>                            WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY
                        [CHACUN CHERCHE SON CHAT]
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Paris. The present. Chloe, (Garance Clavel), a young woman, is fed up
with her life which seems to be at a standstill.   She lives with a
jet-black cat she calls Gris-Gris, even if it does mean "grey-grey",
and with Michel (Olivier Py) who is gay.  To get away from it all, she
takes off on a vacation by the sea but not before insuring someone
reliable will take care of her cat.   She finds her in the person of
Mme. Renee (Renee Le Calm) who is a bit batty and who has many of her
own cats.</P>
<P>While ostensibly about a lost cat, that thread is only to tell the
story of an ever- changing Paris, here personified in Chloe and the
many people with whom she comes in contact when on her return from her
vacation she learns that Gris-Gris has disappeared . . . wandered
off.   Mme. Renee has called on everyone she knows to help in the
search.    One of the volunteers in the search is a young Arab, Djamel
(Zinedine Soualem) who has a somewhat diminished I.Q. but makes up for
it in his crush on Chloe and devotion to the search.</P>
<P>Everyone joins in the hunt:   Mme. Renee's elderly friends; a
long-haired drummer, (Romain Duris) who seems to oddly show up wherever
Chloe just happens to be;  and Carlos, (Simon Abkarian) the
neighborhood know-it-all.</P>
<P>Just as Paris is changing, adapting to the new ethnic groups now found
in every country,  trying to deal with the new youth and their
lifestyles as well as the elderly who still reside where they always
have. . . .  so, too, is Chloe adapting and finding out about her life
and which way she ought to go and how to deal with her loneliness.</P>
<P>The film moves quickly with no wasted effort, much of it in an
improvisational manner by the writer/director.  Although actress
Garance Clavel  has had little film experience she was chosen for the
role because she exuded both fragility and the toughness necessary to
survive.    Renee Le Calm plays herself as do those in  some of the
smaller roles for which the director chose non-actors.   All in all an
enjoyable film.</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Cedric Klapisch</P>
