Sugar Town</PRE>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A solid "B" film. "Sugar Town" strums a strong steady beat that might get
you swaying, but lacks enough bass action to prompt a boogie.</P>
<P>Following four "aging" rockers as they try for a second round of success in
a fickle and slippery Los Angeles market; "Sugar Town" is the teen soap
opera genre re-written for forty-somethings.</P>
<P>Jade Gordon, playing a selfish mediocre singer, is annoying (but perhaps
that's her job). Ally Sheedy, as the nervously insecure Hollywood type,
performs marvelously. The writers deserve the largest praise for sound
dialogue.</P>
<P>Starring Ally Sheedy, John Taylor, Michael Des Barres, Martin Kemp, Larry
Klein, John Doe, Jade Gordon. Written and Directed by Allison Anders and
Kurt Voss. Produced by Daniel Hassid. Released through October Films. (C)
1999. 93 minutes. Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade ......................................... B</P>
