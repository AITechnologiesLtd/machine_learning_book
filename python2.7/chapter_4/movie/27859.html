SPRING OF LIFE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"Race is your fate," the head Nazi officer lectures the blue-eyed, 
blonde lasses assembled before him.  "He who defiles it shall die."  </P>
<P>Milan Cieslar's SPRING OF LIFE (PRAMEN ZIVOTA) examines the not 
well-known breeding program of the Nazis.  The program to exterminate 
"inferior" races, the "final solution," is well documented.  Less 
understood is the program of the Nazis to create a master race by 
breeding carefully selected Aryan women with SS studs.  And I do mean 
"breed."  Once the babies were born, they were whisked away lest the 
mothers develop an attachment to them.</P>
<P>The heroine of this story by Vladimír Körner, and based on his novel, is 
Gretchen (Monika Hilmerová), an innocent looking young Czech woman who 
lives in the Sudetenland.  She is carefully chosen for having an 
impressive X-ray, good lineage and just the right head shape.  Initially 
her village is tickled pink that one of theirs has been chosen to join 
such an elite program.  Just being in it instantly affords Gretchen 
special treatment at work and seating accommodations on trains.  The 
town's admiration, however, quickly turns to jealousy and fear among the 
inhabitants, knowing that she possesses the power to denounce them.</P>
<P>Soon after she is selected, she is whisked off to a sanatorium in 
Germany in which she is groomed just like a goose being fattened before 
the kill.  The women learn how to shoot and fence at something 
approximating a fancy summer camp except that the conditioning is done 
during the dead of a gorgeous winter.  To toughen them up, they are 
required to do calisthenics in skimpy little outfits in freezing 
weather.  They are given survival-of-the-fittest lectures, but most of 
them treat it like a long sorority sleepover with giggling being their 
chief pastime.</P>
<P>The beauty of the setting and the gaiety of the participants appear in 
increasing contrast to Gretchen's emotions of disgust and withdrawal.  
She appears to be the only one who didn't check her conscience at the 
door on arrival.  </P>
<P>The story's real downfall comes in the character of Leo (Michal 
Sieczkowski), the only Jewish man for miles.  The story was powerful 
enough without writing in a highly improbable love affair between 
Gretchen and Leo.  It is a distraction and the story never convinces us 
that it is anything other than a plot device to show us that Gretchen 
really isn't like the other Lebensborn breeders.  </P>
<P>Heavy Wagnerian music from Lohengrin and Tannhauser, along with talk of 
the Holy Grail, reinforce the gravity of the situation.  This is a 
stunningly beautiful picture, which is both its strength and its 
weakness.  Everything is so picture postcard perfect that you start to 
wonder what the Lebensborn program was really like.  Still, as a movie, 
it does a terrific job of dramatizing its points with poetic images that 
will be indelibly marked in your memory.</P>
<P>SPRING OF LIFE runs 1:47.  The film is in Czech with English subtitles.  
It is not rated but would be R for nudity and violence and would be 
acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
