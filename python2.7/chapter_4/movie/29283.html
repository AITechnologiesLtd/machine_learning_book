<PRE>BUBBLE BOY
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest
accomplishments to date are a handful of "award-winning" TV commercials,
as is the case with Bubble Boy director Blair Hayes.  That said, Hayes's
feature film debut lives up to expectations, coming off mainly as equal
parts offensive and moronic.  But occasionally, Bubble Boy transcends
its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social
commentary.</P>
<P>Those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film's two
stars, Jake Gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient Jimmy and Swoosie Kurtz
as his over-protective, hyper religious, Reagan-loving mother. 
Gyllenhall's sweet-natured delivery of Jimmy's hilariously naïve
narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age
story: Jimmy is a Bubble Boy, a kid born without immunity who could die
if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more
seriously in the John Travolta TV movie Boy in the Plastic Bubble and
less so on Seinfeld.</P>
<P>His mom home-schools Jimmy, filling his head with wildly twisted
conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages, until he's befriended
by Chloe (Marley Shelton), the beautiful girl next door.  Jimmy falls in
love with Chloe, but is afraid that his love will literally kill him, as
evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a
kiss.  But when Chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend, Jimmy
builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country
voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love.</P>
<P>The offensive bits have little to do with Jimmy's rare handicap
(regardless of what the film's protesters would have you believe), but
instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes, including a screaming
Chinese strip club owner and a devout East Indian Hindi.  But even if
you find stereotype humor funny, it's hard to muster more than a giggle
for these shallow gags.  They even manage to bungle some potentially
great moments with a group of carnival freaks.</P>
<P>But a few of the harsh jabs manage to work, especially in the case of
Kurtz, who very bluntly shows the dark, hypocritical side of the
religious right, and a wacky send-up of a cult called "Bright 'n Shiny,"
led by the inimitable Fabio.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, a few giggles can't make Bubble Boy the riotous,
off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be.  Honestly, it's a
mystery how on earth this movie was ever made, and I'm not just saying
that because it's so mediocre.  How odd for Disney to take a gamble on a
film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that
doesn't seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the
potential to offend so many.</P>
<P>And now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest
against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy David Philip
Vetter, maybe Disney's wondering the same thing.  Hope the opening box
office take makes it worthwhile.</P>
