                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Paul Hogan, Elijah Wood, Chelsea Field, Jonathan Banks, Isaac
Hayes, Jessica Wesson, Jason Fuchs Director: Alan Shapiro Screenplay:
Alan Shapiro</P>
<P>"I've lost all of my baby fat, but I'm still cute, so love me anyway.'
It must be hard for any child star (Wood) to enter that difficult period
of our lives known as adolescence. The teenage years are hard enough as
it is without the unnecessary attentions of fame and fortune, too easily
endowed on anyone who can help ‘Hollywood' earn a quick buck.</P>
<P>Turn on 'Water Music' meditate on dolphins, and watch your blood
pressure drop to safe limits. Out with the anti-hypertensive medication,
and in with 'Flipper'. This dolphin befriends a lonely, angry young boy,
detects bins of chemical wastes underwater, and cons children out of
free fish and pocket money. Now where can I find myself a pet fish like
this? (Ooops, I mean mammal).</P>
<P>Where we live the sun always shines, the surf is always blue, the
natives are always friendly, and Uncle Porter's (Hogan) speciality is
'toast ala welding torch'. Ahhh, sounds like a good place to retire.
Fresh air, the sound of the sea, endless summer, and don't forget the
sun tan lotion.</P>
<P>So come join 'Flipper' in yet another adventure where he battles the bad
guys of the sea. The environmentally unfriendly fisherman who shoots
dolphins and poisons the ocean floors; the giant hammerhead shark who
has an acquired taste for seagulls and little boys. At the end of the
day I didn't really enjoy the movie, but it did remind me of a much
needed holiday.</P>
<P>Comment: Not 'Waterworld', but certainly more intelligent.
Feel Scale: 0% Goldfish / *DOLPHIN* / White Shark 100%</P>
