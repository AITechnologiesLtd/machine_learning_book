<PRE>                              THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN
                        A film review by Christopher Null
                         Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN are three of the most engaging characters
you're likely to come across in American cinema this year.  A family of
Irish Catholics living in New York, their stories explore living a morally
upright life in the 90's, dealing with failed romances, and the timeless
question of how to commit.</P>
<P>     Jack (Jack Mulcahy), the only married brother, is tempted by another
woman.  Patrick (Mike McGlone) is torn between committing to his long-time
girlfriend and striking out for something new.  Barry (Edward Burns, who
also wrote and directed), is the classic slacker, unable to even conceive
of commitment and an unbeliever in the very notion of true love.</P>
<P>     After the funeral of their abusive father, the trio's mother moves
back to Ireland to be with her lover of 35 years ago.  She leaves Barry
with a singular warning, "Don't make the same mistake I did."  That's all
the encouragement he needs, as Barry becomes the devil on the shoulder of
his brothers, trying with all his might to keep them away from the evils
of commitment.  For Patrick, a devout Catholic and complete neurotic,
marriage is a necessity in living the good life, and Barry is no help at
all.  Jack's infidelity is another problem altogether.  And as the
brothers explore their own problems in the game of love and
self-discovery, each eventually finds the answers.</P>
<P>     This lighthearted romance masks the serious issues it addresses with
heavy doses of nonstop humor in some of the funniest and most genuine
dialogue to ever hit the screen.  The perfect blend of seriousness and
laughter, it's truly that perfect date movie you've been looking for.</P>
<P>     While the film is very skewed toward Irish Catholic culture, we've
all had these feelings, and newcomer Burns establishes himself as a true
creative genius in American film.  There's no slapstick here, just some
excellent conversations about the meaning of life and happiness.  You
*will not* be able to stop laughing.</P>
<P>     It's rare that a film has as profound an emotional impact as THE
BROTHERS MCMULLEN, especially a comedy.  But Burns has crafted such an
incredible picture, that even the most crusty viewer will come out
smiling.  Highly recommended.</P>
