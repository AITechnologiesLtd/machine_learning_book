<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>In some of my recent reviews I have talked about the expected audiences for
movies. If examples like this would happen more often, I would easily be able
to write an essay on the subject, my thesis would be that the movie is the
audience. Likewise, the audience is the movie. During the press screening of
Road Trip that I attended, a local radio station had also given away several
tickets to that show. DJs from the station proceeded to throw everything from
gum, Frisbees, Cds, posters, keychains, and yes, even condoms at us from the
front and the back of the theater, before and after the movie. This gave me a
strong impression of the movie before it even began. The sexually charged film
is a masterpiece for its frat boy audience. The audience indeed laughed their
heads off. I admit that most of the time I was laughing along with them. The
talking dog, the grandpa who uses Viagra, and the talking penis. All at the
time were very funny. However, Road Trip is one of those comedies that, in
retrospect, you can't think of why you laughed it at all. It does a great job
of keeping us interested in the rebellious actions and anarchism happening on
screen; but just hours later, all I had left was an empty feeling. Maybe it's
because it isn't really summer yet. Perhaps I'm still expecting some artistic
value in a movie. However, it could be that the characters are just as hollow
as my feeling of the movie was.</P>
<P>Josh Porter (Meyer, who starred in the excellent teen movie Dancer, Texas Pop.
81) is in a long distance relationship with Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard). He goes
to Ithaca in New York and she does to the University of Austin. One night, Josh
has sex with Beth (Amy Smart) who insists on filming themselves while they make
love. Somehow, the tape of the two's rendezvous gets mailed to Tiffany, so Josh
and three of his buddies must drive to Austin and intercept the tape before it
reaches Tiffany’s eyes. This is a setup for the usual R-rated teenage movie
fodder that includes the essential elements like drug use, explosions, and
virginity shattering sex. Each of the four main characters is supposedly
different, we get traits to associate them with, but they are really just the
same horny college guy. Thus, we get left with the female characters to watch.
One of which is an idiot (Tiffany), while the other (Beth), begins to doubt her
expectations of a relationship from her night of sexual passion. On a bus, she
asks the woman next to her if there is any hope for a solid relationship in the
world. Yes, the woman replies. She also adds that it comes with batteries. </P>
<P>With so many indistinguishable characters, where does the film find it's real
comedy? The answer is also the casting director's greatest triumph; the triumph
is Tom Green. Green, who has become well known as the gross-out king on his
show that currently airs on MTV, breathes some much needed life into this
movie. He does not participate in the road trip, but does have some fun with a
friend's snake whom he tries, unsuccessfully, to force feed a mouse. He tells
the snake to, "Unleash the fury" with no avail and his unpredictable and
annoying actions (the reasons I never watch his show) are right at home in this
movie. Seann William Scott (who also starred in the similarly themed, but far
superior American Pie) proves once again (as if Final Destination wasn't
enough) that there isn't a good acting bone in his body. Meyer and Smart have
both been in better movies, and the rest of the cast is relatively unknown. The
thing I found most disappointing about Road Trip though, was its conclusion.
There wasn't really a climax to any of the events of the previous 85 minutes.
The only climaxes occurring in this movie came from the genitalia of the
characters. At least five different female’s breasts and a scene of brief
full frontal nudity later, I could tell the film succeeded with its intended
crowd. The shopping complex I attended the screening at was closed that evening
because they were hosting the after movie party for the opening night of the
Seattle International Film Festival. Something interesting happened while I was
paying for parking. A young couple, both wearing a wardrobe consisting of
entirely genuine, all black leather, were talking about the artistic meaning of
the movie they just attended in front of me. In the line next to me, a fortyish
man with a large beer gut was partying with teenagers half his age as they
passed around the condoms, Road Trip posters, and radio station bumper stickers
distributed earlier. I was in no way drawn to this movie, but as I looked at
the couple in front of me again, and then back to the adolescents, I couldn't
help but smile.</P>
