<PRE>                             TRIAL AND ERROR
                       A film review by Phil Brady
                        Copyright 1997 Phil Brady</PRE>
<P>When I first heard the setup for Trial and Error, I registered a
small wince. It sounded like "My Cousin Kramer," and I'm sure that easy
dismissal will pop up in many reviews. "My Cousin Vinny" had Joe Pesci,
Marisa Tomei, and Fred Gwynne, all perfectly cast for their roles. The
story was cute, and it looked like its premise had been copied as a
vehicle for Michael Richards. Lightning was unlikely to strike twice,
and I have a rooting interest in Richards. I had learned his name before
Seinfeld, when he was the only good thing in the movie "UHF" (1989 -
Weird Al Yankovic was the "star"..'nuff said). Well it works just fine.
Richards, Jeff Daniels and Austin Pendleton are just as well cast, and
actresses Charlize Theron and Jessica Steen are very right for their
roles, too.</P>
<P>Daniels plays a fast-track lawyer. He's a new partner, about to
marry the boss' daughter when that boss sends him on a short errand in
Nevada. A brief continuance request is rejected, and now he must defend
a guilty-as-sin swindler Rip Torn. Rip doesn't steal any scenes, but
they do allow him with a neat piece testifying on the stand in his own
defense. Where does Richards fit in? Well, it seems he engineered a
bachelor's party the night before, and Jeff is unable to even stand up.
Richards, playing an unsucessful actor, takes it upon himself to
impersonate his buddy for a "one-line walk-on." When the continuance is
denied, he's stuck with the case, unless he wants to admit to violating
all kinds of laws.</P>
<P>Early in the movie, we get a lot of Richards' physical comedy, very
good bits, but they won't carry a movie. Midway through, these schticks
drop away, and we see capable acting carry him through the rest of the
film. Daniels serves as more than just a foil for Richards, coming to
terms with his marriage to a woman he doesn't love. The reality that
jolts him out of it is Theron's radiant barmaid. She could jolt quite a
few men with her sweet manner, knit tops and cutoff jeans..oh, where was
I? Daniels and Theron have quite a few good scenes away from the
courtroom (did I mention she was blonde?).</P>
<P>The primary job of reacting to Richards belongs to Pendleton, as the
bemused judge, and Steen as the incredulous prosecuting attorney. They
do so well that we easily brush aside any concerns about how far real
courtroom types would put up with Richards' disorderly ineptitude. The
screenplay spreads the humor out well, physical comedy here, wordplay
there, with situations and reaction shots providing a balanced attack.</P>
<P>All my fears were unwarranted. Its not fair to compare this film
with "Vinny," since both are excellent comedies. Richards does the big
screen thing well, and Daniels' career as an ack-TORE is further
derailed by another brilliant comedy outing. Don't miss this one.</P>
