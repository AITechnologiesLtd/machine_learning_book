Christopher Lloyd, Bill Nunn, Jack Warden, Steve Buscemi, Gabrielle Anwar, 
Fairuza Balk, Michael Nicolosi and Josh Charles.</P>
<P>Just take a look at the amazing cast list for this film- pretty impressive 
isn't it?  This is almost a dream time of actors and it says so much for 
this film's calibre that such a heavyweight team of actors was drawn to this 
project.  So it is very sad to note that this film didn't do at all well in 
the US, and it really is a crying shame since this film has everything going 
for it : a great script with cracking dialogue, great characters, excellent 
performances and a good story. So why did this film fail ?  I think I may know 
why, and I will come back to this later.</P>
<P>When we first meet Jimmy "The Saint" Tosnia (Andy Garcia) he is seen trying to 
drum up some business for his video service.  He runs a company which films 
dying people giving advice to their relatives in their absence.  His business 
isn't doing well and this is noted by Jimmy's former boss, The Man With The 
Plan (Christopher Walken).  Jimmy used to lead a life of crime but has long 
since gone straight, although his former boss still feels that Jimmy will be 
just the right man to do a "piece of work" for him.  The Man With The Plan is 
a quadriplegic and lives in a huge mansion with his nurse, his two brutish 
bodyguards and his slow-minded son Bernard. </P>
<P>We learn that Bernard has been having a very hard time getting over a 
long-term relationship with his childhood sweetheart who is now about to get 
married.  It turns out that her husband-to-be is about to arrive in Denver in 
a few days time and The Man With The Plan wants him to receive a bit of a 
scare from Jimmy and his old associates.  Jimmy is not at all keen at first, 
but The Man With The Plan doesn't seem the sort of guy you say "No" to, so
Jimmy accepts.  Jimmy gathers up all his old mates from his former days of 
crime: Franchise (William Forsythe), Critical Bill Dooley (Treat Williams), 
Pieces (Christopher Lloyd), and Easy Wind (Bill Nunn).  Jimmy plans the whole
procedure and allows Critical Bill to be one of the two men who stop the 
groom Bruce (Josh Charles) on the road into Denver.  Jimmy isn't keen to let 
Critical Bill take such an important role, since he has a bad reputation
for being a bit explosive and prone to unnecessary acts of violence.  Against 
his better judgement Jimmy is swayed when Critical Bill assures him that
those days are behind him.  When the night arrives to scare Bruce, things do 
not go to plan and Bruce ends up dead.  The Man With The Plan never intended 
this to happen and is not pleased. He orders that Jimmy's associates be killed 
and warns Jimmy to get out of Denver or face the same fate.</P>
<P>The rest of the film shows how Jimmy tries hard to save his friends' lives as 
well as that of his young girlfriend, Dagney (Gabrielle Anwar) who is now in 
danger too.  We also meet a young prostitute, Lucinda (Fairuza Balk) who 
clearly dotes on Jimmy and talks of how she wishes she could have a love-child
with Jimmy.  Jimmy is shown, throughout the film, looking out for Lucinda's 
interests and this is vividly shown when he barges into an office and punishes 
a businessman who has assaulted Lucinda.</P>
<P>I can't speak highly enough of this film, it is simply wonderful.  I have seen 
it twice now and I am looking forward to seeing it again later this week (it 
is still showing in London).  It has everything that I like to find in films : 
a great story that keeps you interested, great characters who you come to 
care about, excellent dialogue that sticks in the mind, marvellous acting from
the entire cast and it looks good too ! I have no criticisms to make.  I 
think that the reason this film was so unsuccessful in the US is due to the 
misapprehension that this is somehow a Tarantino rip-off or a self-consciously 
hip movie.  Both these assumptions are not true and I feel that people who 
may have heard these comments are really missing out on a great film.  I 
believe the film was written before RESERVOIR DOGS came out so the Tarantino 
jibes are unfounded.  The idea that it is a trendy "hip" movie is perhaps due 
to the title of the movie, which unfortunately does give this impression. I 
think that when I heard this title for the first time I got the feeling that 
perhaps this movie was wanting to sound cool and trendy, which is not a good 
impression to get.  So perhaps the title is unwise.  </P>
<P>I have also seen people write about some of the stylised dialogue in the 
film . There are a lot of words and phrases used in the movie that are 
clearly made up and unique to the film and its characters.  Some of these,
including : "Give it a name", "Boatdrinks" and "Buckwheats" and indeed many of 
the characters' names may seem a little forced and a tad pretentious.  Many 
of the phrases are, at first, hard to translate but they get used so often 
that their meaning is very quickly picked up.  The meaning of "Boatdrinks" is 
explained early in the film and vividly and, frankly, beautifully demonstrated
later in the film ( I want to expand on this further but I wouldn't want to 
spoil it for anyone).  My personal feeling is that the creative use of new 
phrases throughout the film lends the film a lot of charm and gives the film 
a very unique feel.  The phrases are never used to distance the viewer, far 
from it.  I felt that it made me like the characters even more, because they 
had such a wonderful way of expressing themselves.</P>
<P>The acting from the entire cast is impeccable.  It's the kind of film that If 
I were an actor I would be so proud to have been a part of it. Indeed, in a 
TV interview I saw with the writer and director they said that once the script 
started doing the rounds in Hollywood, actors all over town were *very* keen 
to get involved. This is a great film for actors because the parts are all so 
well written and the dialogue really gives the actors some wonderful lines to 
play with.  To pick out actors for particular praise is hard, because everyone 
deserves praise.</P>
<P>Christopher Lloyd has one of the most powerful scenes in the
film, where he explain to Jimmy that he knows that he has lived life to the 
full and is prepared to face his impending death with dignity.  Christopher 
Lloyd's acting here is just sublime and had me very close to tears.  Andy 
Garcia is also excellent in this scene as he struggles to come to terms with
what Christopher Lloyd's character is saying. Indeed Andy Garcia
is solid as a rock throughout and gives a hugely charismatic performance that 
just shines off the screen.  Gabrielle Anwar as the beautiful Dagney gives a 
captivating performance, especially in her first scene when she playfully 
makes fun of Jimmy when he attempts to use what she feels are practised
lines in showing how enchanted he is with her.  Her character is essentially 
similar to her part in SCENT OF A WOMAN, but she plays it well and lights up 
the screen when she appears.  Jack Warden has a small role in the film, but he 
is very memorable.  He is seen mostly in a diner, talking to anyone one who 
comes in about Jimmy and his friends.  He is such a master actor that with 
what little he had to do, he creates such a big impression.  Fairuza Balk 
gives a luminous performance as a teenage prostitute and is clearly a very 
talented actress.  She is surrounded by vastly more experienced actors yet she
still gives an excellent performance which has a lot of depth and makes you 
feel very protective for her character.  Her character is so brash on the 
outside yet Fairuza Balk shows her vulnerability very well.</P>
<P>I could go on forever praising all the other actors (Treat Williams and 
Steve Buscemi are superb- there, I got in two more! ), but I think you get 
the point.  Gary Fleder and Scott Rosenberg have made a fantastic film and if 
just one person checks this film out after reading my review, I will be a 
very happy man.</P>
