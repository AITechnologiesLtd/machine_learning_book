<P>Plot: An assassination attempt is made on celebrity virtual reality games 
designer Allegra Geller as she premieres her new VR game eXistenZ in a  
church. She flees, accompanied by her appointed security aide, Antenna 
Research corporate intern Ted Pikul. Attempting to introduce the VR neophyte 
Ted to her work, she has him implanted with one of the spinal bio-ports into 
which the organic consoles plug. But once inside eXistenZ, they are drawn 
into a disturbing game between two rival factions that are seeking to gain 
control of the game where they are no longer sure what is real and what is 
illusion.</P>
<P>If 1998's big theme was asteroid collision and tv-turned-reality movies and 
1997's was volcano disaster movies and 1996's was big budget alien invasion 
films, then this year's trend is shaping up to be Virtual Reality movies - 
what with ‘The Matrix', ‘eXistenZ' and the upcoming ‘The Thirteenth Floor'.</P>
<P>‘eXistenZ' is the second of the year's VR movies. Although jumping on the 
Virtual Reality trend, or any type of bandwagon, is never exactly something 
you could accuse Canadian director David Cronenberg of doing. Cronenberg is 
probably one of the most unique and original voices in the sf/horror genre. 
His body of work - which ranges from ‘Stereo' (1969), ‘Crimes of the Future' 
(1970), ‘Shivers' aka ‘They Came from Within/The Parasite Murders' (1974), 
‘Rabid' (1976), ‘The Brood' (1979), ‘Fast Company' (1979), ‘Scanners' 
(1981), ‘Videodrome' (1983), ‘The Dead Zone' (1983), ‘The Fly' (1986), ‘Dead 
Ringers' (1988), ‘Naked Lunch' (1991), ‘M. Butterfly' (1993) and ‘Crash' 
(1996) (with all bar ‘Fast Company' and ‘M. Butterfly' being sf-horror 
works) - is something that rings with a voice of startling originality. 
Throughout Cronenberg's work runs a fascination with bodily horrors - he 
could be accused of being the first Manichean horror film-maker. Cronenberg 
regularly crafts striking metaphoric images - be it a woman's body being 
taken over by a vampiric organ under her armpit in ‘Rabid'; psychological 
repressions manifesting themselves in flesh form in ‘The Brood' or the 
scientist slowly melding into a fly in ‘The Fly'. But, unlike any classic 
horror film, the process of mutation, indeed the mad scientists themselves, 
in Cronenberg's oeuvre, are rarely processes of horror in any established 
sense - they are ones that seem to be welcomed as transformational 
experiences by the victims. In ‘The Fly', for example, the protagonist 
welcomes his transformation with an eager scientific fascination; in 
‘Videodrome' and ‘Crash' we see people integrating with tv's and cars in 
ways that offer perverse new combinations of humanity and technology.</P>
<P>‘eXistenZ' is Cronenberg's most overtly commercial film in more than a 
decade. From ‘Dead Ringers' onward Cronenberg has determinedly pushed 
boundaries in terms of sheer perversity while having left behind any easy 
pigeonholing as a genre director. His adaptations of ‘Naked Lunch', William 
S. Burroughs' surreal and plotless ramble through drugs and homosexuality, 
and ‘Crash', J.G. Ballard's work of ‘auto'-eroticism, have been 
controversial to the say the least, being dogged by jittery financiers and 
distributors, while his mainstream adaptation of ‘M. Butterfly' was a 
commercial flop. During this time Cronenberg's career was on such shaky 
financial ground he was been forced to make ends meet by working as an actor 
in films like ‘Nightbreed' (1990), ‘To Die For' (1995), ‘Extreme Measures' 
(1996) and ‘Last Night' (1998).</P>
<P>Amid the dross that is being churned out on in the name of Virtual Reality 
cinema, one looks with interest to see what Cronenberg's peculiarly carnal 
fascinations would bring to the subject. His fascination with bio-technology 
immediately starts to creep in. Instead of keyboards people manipulate 
consoles that look like sheep's bladders which are attached via an 
intestine-like cable to a puckered orifice in the spinal column. Naturally 
being Cronenberg, the spinal bio-port orifice is played up for maximum 
sexual imagery with people seen tonguing and fingering it. Meanwhile 
assassains wield guns that are made out of human bone and tissue, in order 
to get past metal detectors, and which fire teeth. The start of the film 
with the assassination attempt, the flight and the encounter with Willem 
Dafoe (in an amusing cameo that in any lesser budgeted film should be 
mandatorily played by Brad Dourif) is engrossing. It is all aided by a 
marvellously brooding and oppressive score from regular Cronenberg 
collaborator Howard Shore.</P>
<P>The first entry into VR doesn't come until nearly 30 minutes into the film 
and is well led up to. But thereafter the film sorts of falls apart. In fact 
for the high standards that one expected of Cronenberg, the script falls 
into some of the more disappointingly hackneyed cliches that has dogged the 
VR film. Like engaging in the series of perpetual flips where people are 
wondering if the game is over yet and what is assumed to be reality is 
intruded in upon - ‘Total Recall' (1990) (a disappointing treatment of the 
VR theme which incidentally was originally to have been made by Cronenberg) 
did these types of flips with far greater dexterity than Cronenberg does 
here. There's a labyrinthine (and never entirely clear) plot (reminiscent of 
the 1993 tv mini-series ‘Wild Palms') involving two different factions 
trying to, for reasons obscure, gain control of the VR game. As one of the 
character's eventually says "There are too many twists going on to follow." 
Indeed the rules of the VR game ‘eXistenZ' are never spelt out. Nor does 
what happen ever seem particularly game-like - Cronenberg seems to have 
taken a leaf from the book of David Lynch in having people standing about 
muttering surreal non-sequitirs in arch deadpan. The VR sequences are not 
without their amusements - like when the two leads find themselves 
controlled by character development and being forced into a gratuitous love 
scene. But when the film ends on what has rapidly become the VR equivalent 
of the old "It was all a dream" twist ending, one wants to yell at 
Cronenberg at the corniness of the device.</P>
<P>‘eXistenZ' feels like Cronenberg's least personal and most routine film 
since his adaptation of Stephen King's ‘The Dead Zone'. It feels less like a 
Cronenberg film than like a film in which a by-the-numbers VR plot has had a 
handful of Cronenbergian imagery grafted onto it. And when one looks for the 
characteristically perverse Cronenbergian flourishes, the imagery seems 
conspicuously lacking in any of the vividity of scenes in past Cronenberg 
films - like Samantha Eggar's brood of external foetuses in ‘The Brood'; the 
wonderfully queasy image in ‘Videodrome' of James Woods tentatively poking a 
gun inside the hole in his stomach then losing it; or in ‘Crash' of James 
Spader having sex wherein he treats the wound in Rosanna Arquette's leg as a 
substitute vagina. Even the most vivid image of the organic gun here seems 
to be one that Cronenberg has cannibalized from the image of the literal 
‘hand-gun' fusion in ‘Videodrome'.</P>
