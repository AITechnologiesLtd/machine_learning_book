<PRE>                              BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Brian Lehr
                        Copyright 1995 Brian Lehr</PRE>
<P>     Riddle me this ... which film which is already one of the biggest
hits of the year made just about as much money on it's third weekend as
POCAHONTAS did on its first?  Holy Big Bucks Batman!  But was this film
as good as it's marketing?  Yours truly went on the opening weekend
(and had to buy tickets two hours early, then arrive at the theater
half an hour before the movie began to get a decent seat) to find
out....</P>
<P>     I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this
movie.  From the very start, with the WB logo morphing into the bat
shape and the credits flying all over the screen, you knew this was
definitely different.  And after the McDonalds intro with the "new"
Batmobile zipping off to get drive-through on its way to stop Two-Face
...  I blinked when I saw Gotham.  It had been transformed from
Burton's gothic, mysterious town into Tokyo, with neon lights flashing
in every corner.  But let me be one of the first (or not) to say I
didn't give a rip.  The movie certainly doesn't wait for you, it zips
right to the action, maybe a little too quickly, but after awhile the
audience gets used to it.</P>
<P>     As for the *big* change in Batmen, all you can see are the lips
when they're in those suits, so who cares?  I felt Val Kilmer did fine
in his role as the Dark Knight, though the Knight wasn't so dark
anymore, along with the rest of Gotham.  He even cracked a few jokes,
while Keaton's Batman just kept his mouth shut and stayed off the
screen for as long as possible.  Possibly Keaton did a better Bruce
Wayne, but the movie's called BATMAN, right? :-)  Tommy Lee Jones did
pretty well as Two-Face, screaming out his lines with a flourish that
he doesn't get to as lawyers or police officers (THE CLIENT and THE
FUGITIVE, both good).  A little more history about him would have been
nice, instead of another of those news clips that Bruce Wayne watches
all the time to give us plot points.  Jim Carrey certainly got his
background stuck in there as the Riddler, and more.  He played very
nicely off of Jones, every once in a while stealing the stow entirely
with his charisma.  Chris O'Donnell did pretty well for the role he
was cast for, as a 20-something teen idol for the girls in the audience
to ooo and aah over (when they weren't showing off the Bat Buns).
Nicole Kidman was just *there*.  She wasn't all that bad, she just
lacked Michelle Pfieffer's oomph ;-) (possibly the only good thing about
Batman Returns).  She has lost some of her own oomph from great flicks
like MALICE; and along with it, she has lost all of her Australian
accent in this film.  I mean, when you don't get your own McDonalds
collectible glass, you know something's gone wrong (Holy Licensing
Agreement Batman!).  Returning from the first two "Batman" movies are
Michael Gough as Alfred (who is superb!) and Pat Hingle as Commissioner
Gordon (who is as okay as his 7-8 lines and static character let him
be).</P>
<P>     Joel Schumacher does job directing this, with new, interesting,
and strange shots of things from every angle, along with decent special
effects.  The score is great, so great I bought it ... well worth the
US$17.99.  Elfman's theme from the first two movies isn't in here, but
Elliot Goldenthal makes up for that nicely by making his own recurring
themes heard throughout the movie.</P>
<P>     All in all, I'd say this is a movie worth seeing, even though the
first two films might scare you away.  Let me tell you this if you
haven't figured it out: This is nothing at all like them.  The plot is
light as fluff and has no "deeper underlying purpose or story" like
Burton tried to convey in his films, but that's the beauty of it.  It's
not made for the meaning, it's made for the ride!  It reminds me
distinctly of another movie with dinosaurs I saw awhile back ...</P>
<PRE>This movie scores with 4 out of 5 bats with me!</PRE>
