<PRE>2D or Not 2D? That is the Question
Encounter in the Third Dimension</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Many of you may have heard about the newer 3D films that have been playing
at IMAX theaters. This is the one to see. Encounter offers an education on
itself -- the history and techniques of 3-D photography. But don't get the
wrong idea -- at every turn twist and protrusion it's a thrilling, learning,
theme park ride on (and sometimes off) the screen .</P>
<P>An "absent-minded professor" and hovering mechanical pal (Max) host you
through a film that doesn't let you sit back and relax. The professor's 3D
presentation of Elvira (yes, the Mistress of the Dark), having yet a few
bugs, traps her between the third and second dimensions. So while he's
trying to free her from the "second and a half" dimension, hi-tech jokester
Max begins the lesson.</P>
<P>In addition to early photo's originally shot in 3D, you'll see a 1903 clip
from the very first 3D motion picture, tidbits from the 3D fad of the early
'50's, equilibrium-challenging shorts and the 100 foot chrome spider from
Universal's T2 in 3D. You won't be thinking ... "Boy these 3-D glasses are
goofy" ... you'll be thinking ... "If those steel feelers touch me, there's
going to be lawsuits!"</P>
<P>You'll step out of the theater wiser, but nonetheless, wanting to ride it
again!</P>
<P>Starring Stuart Pankin & Elvira
Directed by Ben Stassen
Produced by Charlotte Clay Huggins at nWave Pictures n.v.</P>
<P>Grade..........................A
