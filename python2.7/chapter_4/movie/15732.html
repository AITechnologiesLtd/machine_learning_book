Sour Grapes (Reviewed on Dec. 15/98)</PRE>
<P>Starring Stephen Weber, Craig Bierko</P>
<P>"Sour Grapes", newly released on video, is Larry David's directorial 
debut.  Larry David, for those of you not in the know, is the co-creator 
of Seinfeld and also the man responsible for writing many of the most 
classic episodes of that sitcom, including the infamous "Contest" episode.  
Knowing that, one would expect that "Sour Grapes" would reach new heights 
in hilarity.  Well, this does not exactly happen, but it is one of the 
funnier movies of the year.</P>
<P>The film stars Stephen Weber (from Wings) and Craig Bierko as cousins; 
one is a doctor, the other is a designer of running shoes.  Along with 
their respective girlfriends, they spontaneously decide to head to 
Atlantic City for a night of gambling and quote hotel sex.  Needless 
to say, they both find themselves broke quite quickly.  Just before 
giving up, they decide to spend their last few quarters on the slots.  
At the machines, their luck is equally bad, until one of them hits the 
big jackpot and wins 400 thousand dollars.  There's only one problem.  
He won with two quarters the other lent him.  The rest of the film has 
the two cousins fighting over the money, with often wacky, sitcom-like 
results.</P>
<P>I hope my cynical tone doesn't give you the impression that I disliked 
the film.  Quite the opposite, actually.  While not consistently funny, 
it's never boring.  The films strong suit is it's actors, particularly 
Stephen Weber and Craig Bierko as the fuedin' cousins.  They're so 
gleefully over-the-top, you can't help but laugh at their nutty antics.  
Weber, in particular, was a surprise.  After hitting it big with Wings, 
he didn't really seem to do anything.  "Sour Grapes" essentially returns 
him to his area of expertise, sitcoms.  The movie plays like an overlong 
pilot for a sitcom.  Don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing.  
Especially when someone as talented as Larry David is involved.</P>
<P>As a person who was quite dismayed when Seinfeld went off the air earlier 
this year, I had quite high expectations for this movie.  Seinfeld has 
been the only sitcom that has ever made me laugh as consistently as it 
did, and most of the funniest episodes were in fact written by David.  
And seeing as though David is credited as the sole writer for Sour 
Grapes, one would expect that the joke to laugh ratio would be quite high.  
While there are several moments I found myself laughing outloud, there are 
too many instances in which the plot gets in the way.  David keeps 
throwing in more and more ludicrious hoops for his characters to jump 
through, and I got a little tired of it after a while.  I would have 
liked it if he could have done what made his show so famous, and made the 
movie mostly about "nothing".  David's strong suit is his dialogue, so 
he should have included more dialogue-driven scenes, and less gimmicky 
plot devices.</P>
<P>Those familiar with David's work on Seinfeld will likely have a good time 
spotting the similarities between the two.  For one thing, David includes 
classical music into a number of scenes, including the very same piece 
that was heard in Seinfeld's "Barber" episode.  Also, a prominent 
character in the film is Beirko's domineering, exaggeratingly Jewish 
mother, which is very similiar to George's mother on Seinfeld.</P>
<P>"Sour Grapes" may not be the funniest movie of the year, that honor goes 
to the vastly underrated "BASEketball", but it's always entertaining, and 
in the end, isn't that really all that matters?</P>
