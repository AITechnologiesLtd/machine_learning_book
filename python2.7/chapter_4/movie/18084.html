<PRE>Review of Entrapment
Written by: Ronald Bass and Michael Hertzberg
Directed by: Jon Amiel
Rating: * out of ****</PRE>
<P>        I have no real tangible proof of this, but I swear that there
are a lot of producers in Hollywood who adamantly believe that if you
take a bad script, written by a bad writer and give the project it to
an equally bad director, then it is actually possible to make a good
movie. Using their logic, all that really needs be done to change the
bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and
provide an almost unlimited production budget.</P>
<P>        This is the only way I can fathom how 20th Century Fox hired
Jon Amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my
time (not counting the time it took me to get to and from the
theatre). Now, before I continue to ferociously attack what's wrong
with this film, I just want to point out that one of the reasons it
fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an
exciting thriller. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Virginia Baker, an
insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named
Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery). If you've ever seen any Hollywood
blockbuster before, I really don't have to spend too much time on
frivolous plot details: the two team up for various jobs, stealing
various things for various purposes. </P>
<P>        The problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few
billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the
big-budget/Hollywood/action genre. The result is that the entire
production feels contrived. I'm going to be completely honest here:
pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time
was looking at Catherine Zeta-Jones. Now while this may be a
compliment for Ms. Zeta-Jones, it certainly isn't for either the
writers or the director, who are not nearly as clever as they think
they are. Just about the most profound thought they can inject into
this film is when they have MacDougal lecture Baker on the semantic
difference between "entrapment" and "blackmail". </P>
<P>        With an eighty million dollar budget, you'd think that
Entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or
breathtaking special F/X. Well, you'd be wrong. The action that is
present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is
relatively unspectacular. Unfortunately for all those involved with
Entrapment, Die Hard narrowly beat it to the screen by… 11 years. The
reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture, you know
exactly what's going to happen, despite rather pathetic attempts in
the screenplay to throw in plot twists.</P>
<P>        Many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit
Zeta-Jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing. One particular scene
features Baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she
tries to steal an ancient Chinese mask. Nothing wrong with that, but
she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask
was - so why didn't she and MacDougal tunnel in directly under the
mask instead of the other side of the room? I'll tell you why: because
it's a great excuse to photograph Zeta-Jones' posterior as it slides
underneath those beams (and it also allows a second scene of the exact
same thing - the rehearsal).</P>
<P>        Ving Rhames also makes an appearance in this movie, and though
he has great screen presence (although so do Connery and Zeta-Jones)
and the most interesting character in the film, not even he can rescue
this film from the depths of the Boring Film Abyss (a concept I
invented just to describe this picture). </P>
<P>        One last complaint: Entrapment is littered of instances where
MacDougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building, or he
becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot,
he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion. I can picture
Amiel patting himself on the back, thinking to himself "It'll leave
the audience wondering for days: How did he do that?" We know Jon,
it's called editing.</P>
