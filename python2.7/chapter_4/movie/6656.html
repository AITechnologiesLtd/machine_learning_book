<PRE>                          THE GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI
                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1997 John Schuurman</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Rob Reiner
Written by Leo Colick</PRE>
<P>"You are dealing with the past in Mississippi. That is not
where you want to be," so says State's Attorney Ed Peters
(Craig T. Nelson) to his assistant, Bobby DeLaughter (Alec
Baldwin). The utterance expresses the agony of both this story
and that of the "New South": You don't want to go back, because
it is shameful and painful back there, but sometimes you have
to go back; things change and if you don't go back, sometimes
you can't go anywhere. </P>
<P>One such time was years 1989-1994 when the Medgar Evers murder
case of 1963 was revisited by the States Attorney's office of
Mississippi. THE GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI is the story of that
revisitation. </P>
<P>Medgar Evers was a civil rights worker in Mississippi in the
early 1960's. He was shot in the back by a white supremacist,
Byron De La Beckwith (played with chilling accuracy by James
Woods). Beckwith had been tried before two all-white, all-male
juries in the 60's but both juries were divided and he went
free. </P>
<P>Now, 30 years later, Evers' widow, (Whoopi Goldberg), after a
nearly solitary struggle to get the case reopened, has finally
managed to get a little bit of action out of the State's
Attorney's office. Bobby DeLaughter, assistant S.A., is
assigned to look into it again. DeLaughter, is a perfect
character to pick up this cross. He is a son of the Old South,
married to DIXIE De Laughter ("the daughter of the most racist
judge in Mississippi"), he puts his kids to bed by singing,
"Dixie," and he loves his home, his life and his state. </P>
<P>According to this partly fictionalized movie, (some scenes and
dialogue were invented for dramatic effect), De Laughter's
looking into it and his developing passion for the case are
occasioned not so much by the facts that he uncovers -- the
evidence that Beckwith killed Evers was beyond dispute -- but
more by his reflection on the fact that a man, (like himself), 
with young children, (like his), was violently taken away from
those children. His moral outrage at the violation of those
children's right to their father is the engine that drives him
to stick with the case in spite of the hate mail, threats,
vandalism, and the  disapproval of his own family. When tempted
to abandon the painful old case that only the very few still
care about, he goes to the scene of the crime. He plays it over
in his mind and always there are the children. "No man has the
right to take a man away from his children." </P>
<P>While flawed with energy lapses, and some writing that is more
than a little contrived, the film works pretty well on the
premise that we finally seek justice and redress of wrongs for
the sake of succeeding generations. All of our logic says, "Let
it go. No one cares anymore. Why stir up painful things?" A
glance at the trusting, upturned faces says, "Go back. Try
again. This is not about what is easy; it is about what is
right."</P>
<P>This movie is a great lesson in history and a Biblical
understanding of hope. We see the sinful past -- in this case
the sad and violent story of the Old South -- a South that
still can hurt and still thrashes around as if in death throws.
And then we see the future: there are the children and the
promise of the New South -- a New South that is already
blossoming and coming to life. As one character says, "This
whole case is one big resurrection." And --  as always -- we
stand at the crossroads with a burden on our shoulders and
decisions to make. </P>
<P>Biblical hope is exactly like that: Fully (painfully) aware of
a shocking and shameful past, the hopeful one returns to it on
occasion for the sake of repentance. As De Laughter says, "We
never get even for the wrong we do." And then, having grown,
the hopeful, turns and starts living in a future that has
already begun. </P>
<P>The ghosts of Mississippi will still come around -- there are more
defeats they have yet to suffer. But the future belongs to the
resurrection, to healing and to peace.</P>
