                        REVIEW: MAD CITY (1997)
                by Chris Webb                copyright 1997</PRE>
<P>Cast: John Travolta (Sam Baily), Dustin Hoffman (Max Brackett), Mia 
Kirshner (Laurie), Alan Alda (Kevin Hollander).  Directed by 
Costa-Gavras.  Written by Tom Matthews and Eric Williams.</P>
<P>        You have seen it every night on the television: pushy reporters, 
microphones flying, cameras rolling at times of tragedy, the spotlight on 
the victim, innane questions from the anchor desk.  Its the mind-boggling 
flurry of the media blitz at its best, searching for the best, most 
sensational story, controlling the way the public sees the news.  Behind 
the scenes are the back-stabbing egomaniacs searching for the upper hand 
on the other guys.</P>
<P>        "Dog Day Afternoon" showed the effects of hostage-taker on the 
media.  "The Chase" showed the media's ratings-conscious attitude toward 
tense situations.  "Absence of Malice" displayed the way the media can 
harm its subjects.  Costa-Gavras' "Mad City" mixes all three of these, 
creating one of the more thought-provoking films of the year.  While 
countless films have examined the cutthroat world of journalism, they 
seem to forget about how they deal with the people inside the story.</P>
<P>        Max Brackett (Dustin Hoffman) was once a leading network reporter 
whose grandstanding of Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda) during an airline 
crash has left him demoted to local news in Madeline, California.  
Covering fluff pieces and toting intern Laurie (Mia Kirshner) around 
leave him with little hope for reentering the big time.</P>
<P>        Sam Baily (John Travolta) was a security guard at the local museum, 
a victim of budget cuts.  Unable to tell his wife or to provide for his 
children, he returns to the museum with gun in hand so that he will be 
heard and hopefully regain his job.  Brackett had just done a story on 
the museum, placing him in the middle of what turns into a hostage 
situation.  A school field trip is trapped inside, raising the potential 
attraction of the story.  These two downward spiraling men become the 
nations attention.</P>
<P>        Baily accidentally shoots a black guard who kept his job, moving 
Brackett into the position of damage control.  In effect, he becomes the 
producer, director, and writer of the "greatest show in town" that will 
raise his credibility level in the media.  Brackett wins public opinion 
for Baily, running in and out of the museum controlling police action 
and how the public perceives who should be the villain.  Sam Baily 
becomes a hero who just wants his job back.  As the story becomes 
headlines, Hollander moves in.  In his private war with Brackett, 
Hollander upstages the event through some editing that turns Baily and 
Brackett into mere pawns in the hands of the fickle public.  </P>
<P>        Freshman writers Tom Matthews and Eric Williams hit upon a topic 
that will keep audiences seated, manipulating our emotions the way our 
onscreen counterparts are swayed by each shred of information.  Some 
lapses involving smaller stories do exist, but overall they have crafted 
an intriguing overview of the media-public relationship.  </P>
<P>        Brackett knows the game, teaching the hapless Baily the rules along 
the way.  Sometimes it is difficult to tell who has taken hostages 
here.  While Baily holds fifteen people, Brackett holds the world at his 
mercy.  He orchestrates the ordeal, forgetting that he cannot pull the 
plug; only Baily can finish it.  As much as Brackett thinks so, he 
essentially becomes powerless in his own production, going from 
following the story to part of it.  His decline in stature as the 
situation spins out of his control is most enjoyable to watch.</P>
<P>        Hoffman and Travolta put in solid performances, as control-monger 
and poor soul.  After appearing briefly in the aptly named 
"Sleepers," Hoffman seems to be back to his commanding form.  Travolta, 
meanwhile, continues his hot streakon the heels of this year's 
"Face/Off" and his well-received performance in the otherwise 
lackluster "She's So Lovely."</P>
<P>        "Mad City" closes with a view from above: booms, microphones, 
cameras, police, and a mob of reporters.  The consequences of 
Brackett's and Baily's actions pale in the face of the edgier story, 
business continues as usual.  This film leaves the viewer with the 
question: who are the victims in the media blitz?  This movie argues 
that everyone is.  From the reporters' integrity to the audience's 
trust, nothing is untouched or unsoiled by the finish.  While the 
characters of "Mad City" learn nothing, the viewers of this solid and 
enjoyable film can go home and ponder the message.  </P>
