<P>"My Dog Skip" (2000) **1/2 (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Jay Russell
Writen by Gail Gilchriest</PRE>
<P>Starring Frankie Muniz, Dinae Lane, Kevin Bacon, Luke
Wilson,Peter Crombie, Clint Howard, and the voice of
Harry Connick Jr.</P>
<P>Two young boys fail to become friends due to racism in
their hometown. A father, injured during the Spanish
Civil War, fears that his son may live the same life
as him and thus becomes overprotective. A recent high
school graduate is sent off to fight Hitler but comes
back an alcoholic trying to drink his troubled
experiences away. These examples and many more are all
introduced in My Dog Skip, then you never hear about
them again. Instead director Jay Russell takes the
easy way out and makes a simple movie about a boy and
his dog. Sure the terrier is cute and you feel good
once the movie ends, but this could have been much
much more. Introducing these subplots must have been
Russell's idea of playing a joke on the audience. He
holds them out like carrots in front of a donkey but
he never rewards you by completely developing them. 
For a film that takes place in Mississippi during the
second World War, My Dog Skip does not take enough
advantage of the time and place it is set in.</P>
<P>The movie should entertain young viewers though.
Although they might not understand any of the World
War two references, they will surely enjoy the
charismatic little dog that stars in the film. As for
adults, the movie may recreate some nostalgic moments
for them and the dialogue isn't too amateur like other
child flicks. I wasn't disappointed with My Dog Skip,
except, like its dog, it's too small of a movie to
stand out from others with similar plots. This should
sound familiar… a nine year old boy, Will, (Frankie
Muniz), scrawny and friendless, is the target for your
average cliched school bullies. However, once he
receives a dog for his birthday, Will's confidence
soars allowing him to get the girl, friends, and
respect from everyone in his hometown of Yazoo,
Mississippi. But can he and his dog stay out of
trouble?</P>
<P>I'll be honest, it was difficult seeing the titular
character of Malcolm in the Middle, Frankie Muniz, 
playing another character in another time period. To
be honest, his performance as Will was not very
convincing. The southern accent Muniz uses seems fake
and at times he lacks any emotion (no nine year old
would have a blank look on his face if a drunk looter
through an empty beer bottle at him). Muniz has shown
extraordinary talent on his television show but he
seems to lack it in this role. Other actors are wasted
in My Dog Skip. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane, as Will's
parents, are wonderful but rarely used. Luke Wilson,
playing the athletic Dink Jenkins, Will's idol living
next door, is never given complete closure. The real
star here is the dog, who instantly captured the
hearts of every member of the audience.</P>
<P>My Dog Skip is a very small movie. There is nothing
extravagant here but it still should be fun to watch.
If only Russell had dug deeper into the plot and made
it a little more specific. He had so many chances to
do this, with so many different subplots asking to be
developed. Oh well. </P>
