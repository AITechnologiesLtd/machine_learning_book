<P>PLOT:
Two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family, which
prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover. The hex invokes
the eventual demise of their loved one. When one of their past loves comes
back to haunt them, they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I've been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now, but hold on to
your brooms and incantations, cause this puppy is far from being it! For a
film that has the word "magic" in its title, this movie contains very few
moments of magic...or humor for that matter, drama, suspense, or romance.
Well actually, there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so
muddled, it never lets you in on whether it's a comedy, a drama, a horror
show, or a murder mystery. Or maybe it's a romance, eh? It doesn't really
matter, cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting,
that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them, or the film as
a whole. If only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they
did the sinfully obvious soundtrack, this film might've had a chance to be
more than what it is now. Which is an unentertaining, crappy film that uses
the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab-bag
of stupid voice-overs, overdone songs, melodramatic romance, undeveloped
story and uneven acting. I only wish that I could make that one hour and
forty-five minutes of my life re-appear, but alas, it is lost in the
spiritual world of "interesting ideas gone wildly awry".</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film is based on the novel written by Alice Hoffman.
Co-screenwriter Akiva Goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997's BATMAN &
ROBIN.
Director Griffin Dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as AN
AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and AFTER HOURS.</P>
