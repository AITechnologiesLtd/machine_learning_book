<P>     Valentine (Irene Jacob, the star of THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE)
is a model living in Geneva (the poster for RED shows a picture of
Valentine used in an advert for confectionery).  She runs over a dog
belonging to a retired judge (jean-Louis Trintigant), and as a result
becomes his confidante.  In an attempt to shock her out of her
idealism, the judge reveals to her that he spies upon the telephone
conversations of his neighbours.</P>
<P>     Valentine insists that something should be done, but learns that
the connections between people are more complex than she realises.  She
listens to a married man talking on the phone with his male lover and
determines to tell the wife about this betrayal, but then learns that
the marriage is a happy one.  She does not know which is the lesser
evil: to tell, and break up the marriage, or keep silent, and allow the
betrayal to continue.  She keeps silent.</P>
<P>     But the learning process is two-way.  The judge explains that he
had lost his youthful idealism when his girlfriend had left him on the
day he passed his final legal exams.  In the course of talking with
Valentine he recovers some of this idealism and loses his cynicism.
The conversations between Valentine and the judge are glorious to
watch; the house is beautiful in the dim light of evening and the two
characters are obviously attracted to something in each other they
cannot name.  The judge wishes he were forty years younger.</P>
<P>     RED is a film about connections between people, about the ways in
which people meet and interact with others, sometimes not even being
aware of these connections.  A young lawyer, about to take his final
exams, lives across the street from Valentine, but they have never
met.  Like the judge, he is being betrayed by his girlfriend; like the
judge he will leave on a futile trip to England to try to win her
back.  If the judge were forty years younger, perhaps he would be this
young lawyer.</P>
<P>     To emphasize this theme of connection between people, telephones
and red cars feature strongly and symbolically.  The film opens with a
phone call to America, and the camera follows the trans-atlantic cable
to suggest a world of visible and invisible threads joining people.
Other references weave in and out of the film and connect it to other
of Kieslowski's films: the photo of Valentine that adorns the
confectionery poster catches her in exactly the same pose as a final
shot of her on television; the young lawyer drops his books in the
street on the day before his exams (the judge had dropped his books in
the opera the night before his exams; the two Veroniques in THE DOUBLE
LIFE had dropped documents in the street to suggest their connection);
and so on and so on.</P>
<P>     RED is a marvel to watch, both for its visual beauty and for the
subtle and convincing development of the characters.  If it has to be
Kieslowski's swan song, then it is a good choice.</P>
