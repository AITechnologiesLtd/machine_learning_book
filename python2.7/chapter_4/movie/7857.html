<P>     ULEE'S GOLD is the first movie since MICROCOSMOS to prod my 
thoughts towards the invisible world of insects (bees in particular).  
This film illustrates that the power of motion pictures isn't always 
about taking us to strange worlds or putting us in the path of an 
enraged dinosaur.  Instead, it can be something as simple-yet-profound 
as opening our eyes to how different people survive in the real world.  
The title character in ULEE'S GOLD is a beekeeper who lives and works in 
the Florida Panhandle's tupelo marshes, and, although this is a 
narrative feature, not a documentary, it taught me a great deal about 
the difficulties of harvesting of honey.  Yet, as important as 
honeycombs and beekeeping are to the story, they are not the central 
focus.  This movie, from writer/director Victor Nunez, whose previous 
film was Ashley Judd's debut, RUBY IN PARADISE, is about damaged 
characters and fractured relationships.  Ultimately, it's this aspect of 
the film that makes it compelling; the honey-making stuff is an added 
bonus.  </P>
<P>     It's worth noting that Ulee (Peter Fonda, in a performance that 
recalls the work of his late father, Henry Fonda) is more comfortable 
dealing with his bees than with people.  Since the death of his wife six 
years ago, he has turned into a physical and emotional recluse.  He 
lives with his two granddaughters, Penny (Vanessa Zima) and Casey 
(Jessica Biel), who were abandoned by their parents.  Their father and 
Ulee's son, Jimmy (Tom Wood), is serving a sentence for armed robbery.  
Their mother, Helen (Christine Dunford), has dropped out of sight.  One 
day, during the busiest time of the honey-making season, Ulee receives a 
call from Jimmy, who claims that a couple of his former criminal 
associates have located Helen, strung out on drugs, in Orlando.  
Reluctantly, Ulee makes the trip to bring his daughter-in-law home, and, 
in the process, becomes involved in a search for old robbery money.</P>
<P>     The crime-related activities of ULEE'S GOLD represent the film's 
least interesting aspect, and the criminals (played by Steven Flynn and 
Dewey Weber) scarcely rise about the stereotype level.  Fortunately, the 
movie offers far richer and more complex elements, such as how Ulee 
relates to Penny, a quiet, introverted child who misses her mother, and 
Casey, a rebellious teenager.  Or how he struggles to mend fences with 
Jimmy and Helen.  Or how he learns to once again trust outsiders, 
including the local sheriff (J. Kenneth Campbell) and Connie (Patricia 
Richardson), an attractive nurse renting a house across the street.</P>
<P>     With ULEE'S GOLD, Peter Fonda reminds us that he is capable of much 
more than making quirky cameos in the likes of LOVE AND A .45, BODIES 
REST AND MOTION, and ESCAPE FROM L.A.  This is a subtle, nuanced 
performance that brings to the fore all of Ulee's pain and uncertainty, 
then hides it beneath a carefully-constructed facade.  Fonda shows us a 
man who wants to relate to those around him, but is no longer sure how.  
It's fitting that Ulee bonds with his daughter-in-law and granddaughters 
amidst the bees and honeycombs.</P>
<P>     Supporting Fonda is a cast of fresh and familiar faces.  Patricia 
Richardson, best known for her role in TV's HOME IMPROVEMENT, plays a 
decidedly different sort of character here, and acquits herself 
admirably.  As Ulee's granddaughters, Vanessa Zima (THE BABYSITTERS' 
CLUB) and newcomer Jessica Biel give strong, unaffected performances.  
Christine Dunford has the difficult task of essaying the drugged-out 
Helen, and Tom Wood is quietly effective as Jimmy.  </P>
<P>     Nunez's script is thoughtful and intelligent, and it challenges his 
actors with fully-formed personalities for them to breathe life into 
(Peter Fonda, in fact, called Ulee "the best character I've ever read").  
The highest compliment I can offer ULEE'S GOLD is that it plays more 
like real life than a movie.  During the course of the film, we learn a 
little about the different grades of honey.  And, just as the light 
golden Tupelo is in the top echelon, so too is ULEE'S GOLD.</P>
