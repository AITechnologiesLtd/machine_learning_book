<P>Kevin Bacon is another one of our most unsung actors in the movies whose talent
is often unspoken of. This man has appeared in "J.F.K," "Sleepers," "A Few Good
Men," and "Apollo 13." He has also had his footing in the sci-fi/horror genre
in films like the original "Friday the 13th," "Flatliners" and "Tremors." It is
nice to see him back in this genre with the fitfully exciting and alternately
disturbing "Stir of Echoes." </P>
<P>Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a telephone service repairman with a faithful, pregnant
wife (Kathryn Erbe) and a cute son (Zachary David Cope) who talks to himself in
his bedroom and in the bathtub. But who is he talking to? Some unseen force or
spirit, or is it the kids' imagination? Of course, a creepiness sets in when we
see that he is talking to us, and we are the spirits.</P>
<P>One night, Tom goes to a neighborhood keg party and is hypnotized by his
sister-in-law (the quixotically alive Illeana Douglas). Afterwards, he begins
to get headaches, drinks orange juice by the gallon, and feels the need to dig
his backyard searching for something. Tom also sees visions of the ghost of a
missing girl in the neighborhood, and every time he gets close to her, he feels
cold and sees frost in the air (shades of "The Sixth Sense"). Everyone thinks
he is going crazy except for his son who tells him not to be afraid.  </P>
<P>"Stir of Echoes" is great, intriguing entertainment for the first hour. Tom's
visions begin to get more bizarre and violent, and he also foresees the future.
We also see how this affects his wife, their sex life, and his son who seems to
embody other spirits (he is possessed briefly at one point). Unfortunately, as
written by Richard Matheson (based on his 1958 novel) and David Koepp, the
movie gradually stirs itself into a narrow corner. Too many plot threads are
left hanging and we are left with a movie about the spectre of a dead girl who
affects an entire neighborhood.</P>
<P>Once the film examines the mystery of this girl, "Stir of Echoes" never truly
builds on the psychological layers of Tom's character to see how this might
affect him. There is nothing here to suggest the implicit ironies of "The Sixth
Sense" or Roman Polanski's masterpiece, "The Tenant." And the anticlimactic,
mediocre ending lends little in the film's favor. </P>
<P>There is still a lot to savor in "Stir of Echoes." Kevin Bacon projects anxiety
and fear in a nicely balanced performance - his cocky, tense behavior is
well-modulated but he could have done so much more with an in-depth script.
Illeana Douglas is a sprightly wonder and brings the film alive with her
charisma. A real shame that she is so underused considering she unleashes the
can of visions to Tom in the first place. I also enjoyed Kevin Dunn's brief
role as Tom's sexually lustful friend. </P>
<P>There are some surprises but not enough to overcome the fact that "Stir of
Echoes" is nothing more than an extended "Twilight Zone" episode. It had more
potential than that, if only writers Matheson and director David Koepp stirred
all the elements to come up with a fruitier mix.</P>
