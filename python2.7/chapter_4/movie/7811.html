<P>     In a summer when dinosaurs are king, what chance does a gorilla not 
named King Kong have?  Since many parents have decided that THE LOST 
WORLD is suitable fare for youngsters, it's easy to overlook a film like 
BUDDY, which director Caroline Thompson (BLACK BEAUTY) clearly crafted 
with children in mind.  (Don't mothers or fathers care that THE LOST 
WORLD is rated PG-13 for a good reason?)  Unfortunately, this movie is 
an unremarkable example of film making, and doesn't distinguish itself 
in the way that recent family features like BABE and SHILOH have.</P>
<P>     BUDDY is loosely based on a true story (although it takes 
considerable liberties with the facts).  In 1931, a wealthy Brooklyn 
eccentric named Gertrude Lintz (played by Rene Russo) took a sick baby 
gorilla into her care, and, with the help of her husband, Bill (Robbie 
Coltrane), and her assistant, Dick Kroener (Alan Cumming), nursed him 
back to health.  She kept the animal, named Massa in real life but 
changed to Buddy for the movie, for the next four years.  Eventually, 
when he became too large and dangerous for a domestic environment, 
Gertrude donated him to the Philadelphia zoo, where he lived until 1984, 
setting a record for captive gorilla longevity.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem with the movie is that BUDDY relies too much on 
its animatronic inventions and its real animals, relegating both the 
story and the human actors to places of secondary importance.  In 
addition to the title character, a product of Jim Henson's creature 
shop, there are four chimpanzees, a parrot, kittens, raccoons, and 
numerous other representatives of this planet's wild life population.  
Each of these four-legged scene-stealers has at least a moment or two, 
the most memorable of which belong to the chimps.  None of the humans, 
except perhaps the delightful Irma B. Hall as the Lintz' maid, can hold 
their own in such furry and feathered company.</P>
<P>     The animatronic work on Buddy is impressive enough to be almost 
believable (it's certainly a far cry better than Rick Baker's monkey 
suit performance in 1976's KING KONG), although I never for a moment 
thought I was watching a real gorilla.  The chimpanzees are BUDDY's 
legitimate stars, though, primarily because they're the real thing, not 
marvels of modern motion picture technology.  On the other hand, Rene 
Russo, who gets top billing, does little to distinguish herself or 
develop Gertrude into a multi-dimensional character.</P>
<P>     One of BUDDY's themes might remind attentive viewers of an element 
of JURASSIC PARK -- that humankind, no matter how good its intentions, 
cannot bend nature to its will.  In Spielberg's film, the dinosaurs got 
out of control and went on a rampage.  In BUDDY, the ape becomes 
frightened and confused, and reacts with such violence that not even 
Gertrude can calm him down.  Actually, had the movie concentrated more 
on this aspect of the story rather than expending so much time and 
effort being "cute," it might have been more gripping.  </P>
<P>     The most interesting sequence takes place during the 1933 World's 
Fair in Chicago, where Gertrude appears in a pavilion with her gorilla 
and chimps.  Buddy escapes and wreaks havoc, but the movie passes 
quickly through this critical juncture, failing to exploit opportunities 
to fashion a narrative of greater scope and depth.  Too often, BUDDY 
seems rushed like this, and its sketchy approach to compelling issues 
about human interaction with animals can lead to a certain amount of 
dissatisfaction.  To a degree, BUDDY works as light entertainment, but 
it misses an opportunity to be much more.</P>
