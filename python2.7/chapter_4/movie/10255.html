<P>Usually, movies are best enjoyed if you enter the theater knowing as 
little as possible about what you are going to see. In this age of media 
overload, people receive so much advance information about films; through 
trailers, "insider" shows like "Access Hollywood", magazines such as 
"Entertainment Weekly" and ubiquitous movie reviews, that by the time 
they actually watch the finished product, the experience has been ruined. </P>
<P>In the case of "The Pillow Book", however, some advance information is 
probably useful. In order to appreciate a film this unusual, you need to 
be in the correct frame of mind. Try to go to the theater with the 
attitude you would have when viewing an art exhibit. Forget traditional 
narratives and just let the film flow over you. "The Pillow Book" isn't 
simply an example of style over substance. In this movie, the style IS 
the substance.</P>
<P>The Pillow Book", the ninth film from director Peter Greenaway ("The Cook,
 The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"), does have a story, but it is told 
more in images and presentation style than in dialogue. Nagiko (Vivian Wu 
from "The Joy Luck Club") is a Japanese-born fashion model obsessed with 
calligraphy and justice. As she grew up, her father (Ken Ogata), a master 
calligrapher and mediocre writer, had a unique birthday ritual. Each year,
 he would celebrate his daughter's birth by painting her face in script, 
while reciting an ancient blessing. Nagiko worshipped her father and 
cherished the annual rite. She also loved the selections her aunt would 
read her from "The Pillow Book Of Sei Shonagon", a 1000 year old volume 
of romantic reminiscence. Nagiko was so enamored with the writings that 
she routinely took meticulous notes on her experiences and feelings to 
create her own pillow book. </P>
<P>While still a child, Nagiko peeked through a door at just the wrong 
moment and caught a glimpse of her father sexually submitting to his 
publisher (Yoshi Oida), the "fee" for getting his work printed. Young 
Nagiko didn't understand what she saw, but the image would haunt her over 
the years. When she reaches adulthood and her father stops the annual 
birthday ritual, Nagiko flees Japan, and an arranged marriage with the 
publisher's boorish son. In Hong Kong, she becomes a successful model and 
spends her free time seeking sexual and emotional satisfaction, trying to 
get men to paint script on her body. Eventually, she meets Jerome (Ewan 
McGregor from "Trainspotting"), a British translator who suggests she use 
his body as the canvas for her work. The driven woman develops a strong 
erotic and literary relationship with the young man, made all the richer 
by the knowledge that Jerome is the lover of the same publisher who once 
used her father for sexual gratification.</P>
<P>Director Greenaway manipulates images to paint his own pillow book. Most 
of the film is presented in the letterbox format, with occasional 
subtitles (the film's sparing dialogue switches casually from English to 
Japanese) drifting by. The images are layered, with shots on top of other 
shots, and elegant script superimposed on the screen. Music is used with 
strong effect as well, creating a deeply textured multi-media 
presentation that works far more often than it does not. Ironically, some 
of film's most striking images are the simplest: ink-saturated water 
swirling down a drain, Nagiko curled in the fetal position in a round 
basin, and the many body canvases covered in beautiful script. </P>
<P>There is a great deal of full frontal nudity in "Trainspotting", 
particularly from the remarkably uninhibited Wu and McGregor, but overall 
the effect is not erotic. Greenaway's multiple-imaging echoes and 
amplifies Nagiko's state of mind. She is obsessed with calligraphy and a 
desire for justice. The nude men she paints, except for Jerome, are 
little more than canvases, vehicles for her attempts to satisfy her 
obsessions, and we view them that way as well. Nagiko's obsession and 
self-absorption is the center of "The Pillow Book". She is the only 
character of substance, which is the film's weakest point and probably 
central to what makes it so memorable. </P>
<P>"The Pillow Book" completely puts the viewer into another person's shoes, 
something that rarely happens in modern film. Nagiko's mind is not a 
pleasant place to be, but it is fascinating. "The Pillow Book" is a 
difficult film, and Greenaway's imaging occasionally seems more like 
grandstanding, but the sometimes disturbing, often beautiful images offer 
an experience one rarely will encounter in a multi-plex. </P>
