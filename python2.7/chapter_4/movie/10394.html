<PRE>                           GOOD WILL HUNTING
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A twenty-year-old super-genius works
          as an anonymous janitor at MIT.  He is also into
          brawling and getting into trouble with the law.  A
          parole is arranged on the conditions that he do
          mathematics and get a psychological analysis.  This
          is key to a difficult turn in his life.  Ben
          Affleck and Mark Damon wrote the screenplay and
          play major roles in the film.  Gus Van Sant
          directs.    The character is a little too sharp and
          the action a little too dull.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10),
          low +1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 18 positive, 1 negative, 1 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Frankly, the film did not do a lot for me.  I could not believe
the mail character.  Goethe was one of the great geniuses in history
and he excelled, as opposed to just being good, in only a few fields.
The premise of GOOD WILL HUNTING bothered me from the very beginning
because it was too difficult to believe that Will Hunting could be as
brilliant in as many different fields as the script requires him to be.
To have a super-genius of his caliber places this film more in the
category of science fiction than that of a believable drama.  The
premise that there is someone out there of this magnitude of brilliance
who has not by the age of 20 come to a lot of people's attention seems
unlikely.  Here he is working as a custodian at MIT and he can easily
beat the best mathematics professors on the faculty.  Then he
demonstrates he is way ahead of an economics graduate student in that
student's own field.  This would be hard to believe of someone who
spends his full time studying, but Will Hunting (played by Mark Damon)
seems to spend very little time in books.  Instead he spends most of
his spare time drinking with his blue-collar buddies and getting into
trouble with the law.</P>
<P>     His real genius is discovered by mathematics Professor Lambeau
(Stallan Skarsgard), winner of the Fields Medal (the most prestigious
award in mathematics).  Lambeau gives his classes a prize problem to
see if one person can get it over the semester.  Janitor Will Hunting
solves it with the effort of doing the Times Crossword Puzzle and
leaves the answer anonymously on a hallway blackboard.</P>
<P>     Lambeau sets a harder problem and Hunting solves it also, but is
seen leaving the answer.  This gives Lambeau the clue needed to track
down the mysterious genius whom he finds conducting his own legal
defense after having attacked a police officer.  Hunting fails to
convince the judge and is sentenced to jail. Lambeau arranges a parole
on two conditions: Hunting will undergo analysis and will do math with
Lambeau.  Once he is discovered, different people fight to understand
Will Hunting and to pull him in different directions.  For a long
stretch there are just four breeds of scene in this film.  Hunting
carouses and drinks with his rough-playing blue-collar buddies; Hunting
does math with Lambeau, proving himself a far better mathematician than
anybody on the MIT faculty; Hunting has a relationship with Skylar
(Minnie Driver), an English Chemistry student; Hunting has mutually
parasitic mind game sessions with his analyst (Robin Williams).  The
film just goes back and forth among these scenes until Hunting decides
how to handle his life.</P>
<P>     Hunting's ability to turn psychiatrists into raving animals in
minutes seems more modeled on Hannibal Lector than on anything human.
It takes many sessions with his analyst before they can talk in
anything but sarcastic jabs.  The film does a decent job of showing the
relationship between Hunting and his lifelong friend Chuckie (Ben
Affleck) who really care for each other.  The relationship with his
girlfriend was OK, but covers well-trodden territory.  But Hunting's
mind seems really clear only when he is doing mathematics.  It is never
clear what exactly is going on in Hunting's mind or why he changes in
just the ways he does, sometimes playing games and others following the
simplest of advice.  This is a film with a serious credibility problem
and one which stagnates in the middle act.  I would give it a 5 on the
0 to 10 and a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Side comment: It is difficult to present someone superbly
brilliant in a film without having someone being superbly brilliant to
write the script.  Damon does a reasonable job playing the troubled
super-luminary who has buried himself in a lower-class lifestyle, if
any such person has ever existed.  The film draws false parallels to
Ramanujan and Einstein, neither of whom had Will Hunting's broadband
versatility.  For what it is worth, this is one of the few film that
did a reasonable job of representing higher mathematics. Certainly the
they got the facts on the Fields Medal (though they omitted to mention
that you have to be young to win the Fields).  Ramanujan did not
actually work for "many years" with Hardy as stated.  He died quite
young, probably in large part because of his transplanting from his
native climate to England. It was a tremendous loss.</P>
<P>     I would have assumed that answers to really difficult problems in
combinatorics might involve complex counting arguments and would not
fit on a single blackboard, but it is possible.  It filmed nicely, but
it is unlikely a mathematician would do math with a marking pen on a
mirror.  It is too easy to accidentally rub off, it does not give
enough writing space, and the results are not easily portable or
savable.  He may have done some scratch-work there, but even that seems
unlikely.</P>
<P>     It is hard to believe an American mathematician would not know who
Ted Kaczynski is.</P>
