<PRE>                                BEING THERE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>Being There (1979) **** out of ***** - Cast: Peter Sellers, Shirley
MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas, Jack Warden, Richard Dysart, Richard Basehart,
James Noble. Written by: Jerzy Kosinski. Directed by: Hal Ashby. Running
Time: 124 minutes.</P>
<P>Peter Sellers tried to get "Being There" made for eight years, and I'm very
glad he succeeded. He plays a childlike gardener named Chance whose only
knowledge about life is from what he sees on television. When his father
dies, he is forced to leave his home for the very first time in his life. He
proceeds to get into situations where people keep thinking he's brilliant,
even though he is saying very little about anything except gardening.</P>
<P>I must admit that I do not understand the final shot of the film. Something
odd happens which I think I understand, but I could be wrong. And even if
I'm right, it doesn't make much sense.</P>
<P>One thing that bothered me while watching the film (and though it did bother
me, it did not have any bearing on the film's rating) was watching Melvyn
Douglas' performance. He won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year OVER
Robert Duvall from "Apocalypse Now" which I feel is a travesty. Douglas is
ok in the film, but he's just a dying old man. Nothing special. But like I
said, it didn't influence my opinion of the film. I just wanted to voice
that opinion that Duvall was robbed.</P>
<P>Sellers, who's health was failing at the time of the film, desperately
wanted to win the Best Actor Oscar which he had lost in 1964 for Dr.
Strangelove. He came very close. He did win the Golden Globe award, but lost
the Oscar to Dustin Hoffman.</P>
<P>As brilliant as he was as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau and in "Dr.
Strangelove", "Being There" is his greatest performance on film. Just in the
very first minute, before he even says a word, you can see in his eyes that
this character has the mentality of a child. Many who worked on the film and
who worked with Sellers in the past said that Sellers was very similar in
real life to Chance, which makes his final great performance even more
touching.</P>
