<P>Eye of the Beholder: the monitor and the monitored</P>
<P>Eye of the Beholder is a movie in which many secrets are kept. Most
importantly, we never get a clear idea why the Eye's (Ewan McGregor) wife
and kid might be estranged, and we never get a good handle on the clinical
aspects of Joanna's sociopathic compulsions. And these are the two main
characters, the ones we're supposed to understand. With most movies, lapses
like this would be enough to bring them down. But most movies aren't like
Eye of the Beholder, which is able to get way with such indiscretion simply
because the fairy-tale structure is so complete and so powerful.</P>
<P>On the one hand, you have this Eye, for whom privacy is a laughing matter
(if he ever laughed, or had reason to laugh). Like all good British agents,
he has enough hi-tech surveillance equipment that he could pawn it and buy
small island somewhere. Like all good private eye-types, too, he's in over
his head with Joanna, has proven once again that private eyes in the movies
are always a bargain: pay them a few hundred dollars, and--when they set up
their stake-out--they'll invariably see much more than they were paid to
see. The Eye does, and--this is telling--he doesn't blink. Instead he does
the old assassin-in-the-movies shuffle, and falls for his 'target,' goes
AWOL from his employer, then spends the rest of the movie protecting her
from harm--the harm he used to stand for. It's a neat little dynamic.</P>
<P>On the other hand--talking fairy-tale structuring--there's Joanna, playing
more or less a talented Ms. Ripley: time and again, she's surprised at the
violence she's been psychologically programmed to carry out. But then too,
she's cold enough to turn off the guilt, which means she's pretty much the
perfect killer, which is to say she's the only 'target' really worth viewing
by this Eye. His talent is wasted one everyone else, as is established early
on. And that's the fairy-tale part, the Insider part: ideal characters
coming together.</P>
<P>The pairing structure goes deeper, too, though. Not only are these two
people destined to meet by dint of their respective abilities/lifestyles,
but they're also both injured enough emotionally that no one else would
do--they're made for each other. All the same, though, it's a long-distance,
telescoped relationship, with the Eye playing guardian angel to Joanna by
appealing again and again to his guardian angel (KD Lang, at British HQ; and
yes, 'guardian' and 'Gordian' is perhaps an intentional homonym, here). No,
you never do understand a lot of things, but at the same time everything
that happens feels so inevitable that your unanswered questions don't matter
so much as whether these two starcrossed lovebirds will ever get on screen
together, in the closing frames, for however long. It's a romance; you get
caught up in it. And yes, Eye of the Beholder is something of an art-film
trying to go mainstream with starpower (per Magnolia, Being John Malkovich),
but still, not everyone will appreciate the End of the World-ish (Wem
Wenders) pacing, the psychological personifications, the long moments with
soft music. Eye of the Beholder is an acquired taste, isn't simply Enemy of
the State gone noir. It's something in it's own right, something much more
powerful, a muted psychological thriller which attempts to pass the
microscope over the human condition, and then linger for a while.</P>
