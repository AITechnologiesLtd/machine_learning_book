<P>
Seen within a few minutes of one another last week in London: a series 
of advertisements for computers running the Windows NT system, with the 
slogan 'The Full MoNTy', and a headline in a tabloid newspaper crying 
'Give us the Full Monty, Gordon'.</P>
<P>It's a measure of the film's success that the description 'the full 
Monty', until now more often associated with the English cooked 
breakfast, has become so widely used in recent weeks.  And, given that 
the film is about male strippers, the mind boggles at that tabloid 
headline, which was actually about Britain's reluctance to commit to a 
fiscal union with the rest of Europe.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is very simple - a group of redundant Sheffield 
steelworkers are looking for alternative ways to earn their keep and, 
in desperation, come up with the idea of mounting a strip show.  But 
the effect is in the execution, and in the acting; there are such 
wonderful moments as when a redundant foreman, played by Tom Wilkinson, 
has a visit from the bailiffs, or when the slightly tubby steelworker 
played by Mark Addy attempts a very novel approach to losing weight.</P>
<P>Starting with an archive film from the 1970s, about Sheffield's then 
thriving industry, 'The Full Monty' actually tells us a great deal 
about the collapse of a society based on heavy industry.  Light-hearted 
as it is, it addresses a very important question: when the traditional 
sources of livelihood in places like Sheffield disappear, what needs to 
replace them?</P>
<P>It's good fun, and good-natured fun as well because the characters are 
invariably both fallible and likeable.  Despite being set among such 
economic desolation, a genuine feel-good film.</P>
