                                   HENRY V
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Kenneth Branagh shows that there is
     more than one way to play Henry, though his way does not
     always seem convincing.  Visually the film is splendid.
     Rating: +2.</PRE>
<P>     The advantage of the longbow over its shorter predecessors is, of
course, range.  It is entirely feasible to create a shower of falling arrows
that your enemy must enter before he can even come near you, provided you
have brought enough arrows along.  This is *probably* the reason that the
English at the Battle of Agincourt were able to kill what is quoted as ten
thousand French while losing only 29 of their own numbers.  Bill
Shakespeare's script for the current HENRY V tends really to downplay the
technological advantage the English had at the battle, implying the
imbalance in casualty figures can be attributed instead to the fact that Old
Hank really knew how to give one heck of a good pep-talk.  Well, song-
writers tend to glorify song-writers, and film-makers like to make films
about film-makers, so it isn't surprising that Shakespeare's stuff tends to
glorify wordsmiths.  Even though the actual casualty numbers were probably
closer to 200 and five thousand, Shakespeare still seems to over-rate
Henry's speech-making.</P>
<P>     That technical issue aside, how is HENRY V anyway?  I do not claim to
be a judge of Shakespearean acting and presumably the main virtue of this
film is Branagh's much-vaunted interpretation of Henry.  I can tell you that
in the early scenes he delivers his lines with very little expression at
all.  I am sure this is intentional, but after a supremely dramatic entrance
he strikes the viewer as being a sort of a cold fish.  As time goes by he
puts more emphasis in his words, and by the love scenes at the end he seems
not just human but positively likable.  One gets the impression that henry
was a wild teenager who rises to his office as king while we watch.  Still
Branagh seems only a good actor who has the audacity to cast himself in a
great role.  He may become a Rupert Pupkin of Shakespearean actors.</P>
<P>     This is a Shakespeare for the late Twentieth Century, with far more
dramatic visual images than in previous versions.  Notable particularly are
Henry's entrance and a scene of Henry on a rearing steed at "the breach,"
back-lighted by fire.  The battle scenes are beautifully filmed, somewhat in
the style of EXCALIBUR.  Ironically, the narrator tells the audience to work
hard to picture the scene while the audience have only to sit back and let
it flow over them.</P>
<P>     While they did not remove the line to tell the audience to work to
visualize the scene, some liberties were taken.  Flashback scenes were added
to show Henry's past with Falstaff.  Presumably Branagh undertook to write
these himself in a Shakespearean style.  There was a deletion to references
to the English killing French prisoners which probably would not play as
well on modern audiences as it did in Shakespeare's time.</P>
<P>     This is a memorable film and probably one that will be playing on PBS
in 2010 when most of the rest of this year's films are forgotten.  My rating
is a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
