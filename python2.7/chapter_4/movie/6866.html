<P>What can you say about the director of 'Rambo: First Blood Part II'
(1985) and 'Cobra' (1986) making a movie about a major U.S. government
conspiracy?  Well, not much.  'Shadow Conspiracy' is a laughably bad
and totally far fetched piece of wretched garbage which is an insult to
those who believe in on going conspiracies in government world wide.
Charlie Sheen stars as a White House advisor to the President who
becomes gains knowledge of a massive government plot to commit
treason.  The movie has absolutely no depth of focus and instead of
building the story slowly in a fascinating manner piece by piece, it
instead dives right in and is nothing more than a tedious chase
picture.  Sheen is suspicious of the White House chief of staff (Donald
Sutherland) who may or may not be the bad guy.  Linda Hamilton rounds
out the major members of the cast as a reporter who aids Sheen in the
run for his life.  Even sillier than this, there is a nasty hitman for
hire who parades himself throughout the movie in a nameless and
speechless manner picking off people like insects and a scene near the
beginning of 'Shadow Conspiracy' is straight out of 'Three Days of the
Condor' (1975).  Director George P.  Cosmatos is not a filmmaker suited
for this type of material.  The unbelievable twists and turns in this
movie have no credibility and one scene involving a toy plane rigged
with a murdering machine gun mechanism had me almost walking out on the
film.  Sam Waterston ('The Killing Fields') gives a career worst
performance as the President and Ben Gazzara is equally stiff and dull
as the Vice President.  There isn't one single redeeming thing about
this movie and for all those people who complained that Oliver Stone's
'JFK' (1991) was an indictment of the system blown out of proportion,
'Shadow Conspiracy' will only serve to double that movie's stature as a
great film.</P>
