<P>Okay, it's a minor gripe and it wouldn't hurt the potential enjoyment of the
film by anyone. But it would have been nice if the character of Dock Newton
was played by Woody Harrelson.</P>
<P>Now I'm not knocking Vincent D'Onofrio by any means. He's wonderful here, one
of his best performances since that great one he gave in in `The Whole Wide
World.' In fact everybody's great in this flick.</P>
<P>I just think that Harrleson looks like Matthew McConaughey is all.</P>
<P>Now that that teensy rant is over, we come to what's the best movie to open
since the beginning of the year.</P>
<P>McConaughey plays Willis Newton, who when the movie opens is just out of
prison for a crime he didn't commit. He arrives home to the rural Texas of
1919, which for all intents and purpouses is still the old west. </P>
<P>His possibly widowed mom(Gail Cronauer) owns a small ranch where her younger
sons Jess(Ethan Hawke) and Joe(Skeet Ulrich) break horses and live happy-go-
lucky lives.</P>
<P>Which is nice and all, but Willis is thinking bigger than that. He's getting
together with Brentwood Glasscock(Dwight Yoakam) and  a guy named Slim(Charles
Gunning) go start a career as a bank robber.</P>
<P>Slim's plan backfires, and with him out of the picture for a while, Willis and
Brentwood decide to bring Jess and Joe into the enterprise.</P>
<P>...And thus begins a hybrid western/gangster film that would be welcome in
either genre.</P>
<P>Rounding out the mob is Brentwood's wife Avis(Chloe Webb) and later the
aforementioned brother Dock.</P>
<P>There's also a romance between Willis and Louise(Julianna Margulies), who
works at a magazine stand in a hotel our heroes are staying at.</P>
<P>The characterizations are all wonderful. The acting is fine, the story
compelling, and there is action from beginning to end.</P>
<P>Had this come out three months ago, it would be up for an Oscar for something.
It's well worth the bucks.</P>
