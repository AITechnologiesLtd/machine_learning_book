<PRE>Analyze This</PRE>
<P>When cinema's history books are written, Robert De Niro would definitely go
down as one of this generation's greatest actors.  Great as he is, however,
he won't be noted for his versatility.  A cursory look at his filmography
shows him typecast as (A) a mafioso/hoodlum (_Taxi Driver_, _GoodFellas_),
(B) ordinary schmoe (_Deer Hunter_, _Falling in Love_), or (C) comic
personality (_Brazil_, _Midnight Run_).  Shakespeare, he isn't.  </P>
<P>_Analyze This_, to my memory, is the first film he's made where he tries to
reconcile all three personality types in one film.  He's a tough
gangster-type, who really is an ordinary schmoe, only to a comic extreme.  </P>
<P>De Niro plays Paul Vitti, a tough mob boss who is starting to get panic
attacks, days before a huge mafia "convention."  He secretly pulls himself
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) who is terrified to get involved, and who
is planning to get married that week.  Complications ensue.  Hilarity is
blueprinted.  The comic apex is how De Niro totally breaks down and cries
like a baby in these sessions.</P>
<P>You'd think De Niro could pull it off.  Not quite.  The result is terribly
disorienting.  The opening scenes have him playing "Mr. Tough Guy," but
later, we see he's _really_ somebody who has panic attacks and low
self-image.  Sure, it's funny, but it leaves a sour aftertaste.  Are these
two caricatures from the same person?  I'm pretty good at suspending belief,
but this I just don't buy.  </P>
<P>Worse off, there's no real logical impetus as to why Vitti is getting
scared, around now.  He's had to deal with his adversaries his whole life,
and certainly the fear that he would be killed by an assassin's bullet at
any given moment carries far more tension than facing a competing
mafioso-boss (Chazz Palminteri).  And is there any guilt within him, for all
the crimes he's committed in the past?  No.</P>
<P>Because I can't accept this premise, the movie collapses.  Simple as that.</P>
<P>Billy Crystal tries hard, but face it.  This is a role _anybody_ could play.
He's just the straight-man here, being continually usurped by De Niro and
occasionally funny dialogue from his patients.  </P>
<P>Did you know Lisa Kudrow is in this film?  Wasted.  Bill Macy?  Wasted.
Molly Shannon?  I don't even remember who she played.  A cameo from Tony
Bennett?  Been there, done that, burned the t-shirt.</P>
<P>The film's saving grace is played by heavyweight (literally) Joe Viterelli.
In perhaps the most understated performance in the film, he singlehandedly
is both menacing and endearingly comic, moreso than De Niro.  He gets the
laughs, and doesn't have to change his character to do it.</P>
<P>In summary, AT has a few laughs going for it, but if you're lucky, you've
seen them in the previews.  Previews are good like that.  They rat-tat-tat
the jokes and the assumption is that the film would do the same for the
entire two hours.  They don't carry the burden of actually making sense.</P>
