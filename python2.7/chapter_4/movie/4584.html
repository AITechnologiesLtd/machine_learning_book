<PRE>                               EYE FOR AN EYE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     EYE FOR AN EYE is a thriller about vigilantism.  Depending on your
point of view, it is either a disturbing real drama about a mother
trying to avenge her daughter's killer or is a poorly acted,
manipulative, and ridiculous soap opera.  Although I am firmly in the
latter camp, I should point out my wife was very upset by the movie but
thought it was excellent.</P>
<P>     As the story begins, Karen McCann (Sally Field) is at a standstill
in heavy traffic.  She is talking on her cell phone to her 17 year old
daughter Julie who is at home working on the fourth birthday party for
her sister Megan (Alexandra Kyle).  While Karen listens, Julie is
brutally raped and murdered.  Although the audience is forced to see it
all, Karen can only listen.</P>
<P>     Soon Karen and her husband Mack (Ed Harris) are speaking with
Sergeant DeNello (Joe Mantegna) who is the investigator in charge of
the case.  Although he gives the appearance of being an incompetent
cop, he quickly finds the killer, Robert Doob (Keifer Sutherland).  The
new prosecutor assures the McCanns that the killer's conviction is
certain.  In the great tradition of recent American justice, the killer
is set free because the evidence, although conclusive, is not large
enough to divide in two so the defense have part.</P>
<P>     In a scene straight out of the recent movie THE CROSSING GUARD,
Karen and Mack joint a support group for relatives whose children have
been killed.  Soon Karen hooks up with a vigilante group and is off to
kill Doob before he kills again.  Of course, Doob in turn threatens the
whole family, especially little Megan.  Most of the movie then is a cat
and mouse game where Karen is stalking Doob.  Will she kill him or
won't she?  That is what the movie is purportedly all about.  Actually,
it rarely rising about the level of cheap thrills, and thanks to a
ridiculous and poorly written script (Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa),
its believability quotient is quite low.  Although the rape and murder
part is realistic, the vigilante portion, which occupies most of the
movie, feels highly contrived.</P>
<P>     Director John Schlesinger takes four brilliant and accomplished
actors and, somehow, manages to get little out of them.  I can think of
many movies each one of them has made where they were great.  Take for
example, Sally Field's somewhat similar role in NOT WITHOUT MY
DAUGHTER.  There her emotion was intense and believable.  She is too
reserved and just not convincing in EYE FOR AN EYE.  Ed Harris is not
given much of a part and is unable to take what lines he is given and
do much with them.</P>
<P>     Poor Joe Mantegna is stuck as a cop in a show where the police are
cartoon characters.  He gets to explain his interrogation secrets with
such lines as "Poor man's truth serum - caffeine and sugar".  He beats
up suspects and tells them to "get out of my city".  Although the
writers reserve the worst blather for the cops, the rest of the script
is not much better.  When Karen feels Sergeant DeNello is not trying
hard enough to get Doob, she ridicules him with, "why don't you offer
him a candy bar and maybe he will confess?"  The script is simplistic
and predictable.  I found the ending, which it is telegraphed way in
advance to the audience, to be too abrupt.</P>
<P>     In the only almost decent piece of acting, Keifer Sutherland does
a passing job as a twenty-six year old delivery man for Catalina
Liquors.  His performance is one dimensional, but at least he is
suitably creepy.  To show how mean he is, the writers have him pour hot
coffee on a stray dog.</P>
<P>     The minor characters are even weaker than the four leads.  Beverly
D'Angelo plays Karen's friend and coworker.  She demonstrates little
visible talent which, to be honest, is consistent with many other
movies I have seen her in.</P>
<P>     There is a single funny scene in the show.  Suffice it to say that
learning self-defense does have its downsides.  There is one other good
part, the sets by Stephen Hendrickson provide a strikingly gritty view
of a poor section of the city.</P>
<P>     EYE FOR AN EYE runs 1:43 but thanks to the slow pacing by editor
Peter Honess, it dragged a lot.  Certainly, not the fast pace you would
expect in a thriller.  It is rated R for graphic violence including
rape and murder.  Very bloody and potentially, extremely disturbing.  I
would not let teenagers go unless they were quite mature.  I would be
especially careful of letting teenagers girls go, lest they end up with
nightmares for a long time.  I can not recommend this show to anyone,
and I give it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
