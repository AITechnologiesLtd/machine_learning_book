<PRE>                            DENISE CALLS UP
                     A film review by Carrie Gorringe
                      Copyright 1996 Carrie Gorringe</PRE>
<P>"Denise Calls Up".  Written and Directed by Hal Selwyn.  Starring
Tim Daly, Caroleen Feeney, Dan Gunther, Dana Wheeler Nicholson,
Liev Schreiber, Aida Turturro, Sylvia Miles and Alanna Ubach.</P>
<P>        In Hal Selwyn's new film, "Denise Calls Up", one of the central
characters, Gail (Wheeler Nicholson), in a telephone conversation
with her ex, Frank (Daly) pinpoints the central problem that all of
the characters are having.  She tells him, "Work can swallow you up
if you let it."  His response:  "And we let it."  But even this
realization isn't enough to shake any of these young New York
professionals out of their interrelational torpor;  being "zenned out
on work" is the excuse for limiting their communications to
telephone calls;  when they require visual reminders of what
someone looks like, they resort to faxes.  Their entire lives consist
of almost nothing but electronic interfacings.  While this is not an
unusual affliction in the modern era, their problems go deeper than a
mere dependence upon technology;  rather, it is the convenient way
in which technology has allowed them to forego the "messy" nature
of face-to-face meetings, with their inconvenience, demands and
potential for pain.  Laptops and telephones ever at the ready, they
break luncheon and party dates while pouring a never-ending, if
unvarying, stream of post-facto platitudes through their
mouthpieces.  A funeral for one of their group brings out only one
mourner, who consoles one of the nonattendees named Linda
(Turturro) with one of the most ironic lines in the film, "Death isn't
for everyone."   Even their sexual relationships have an aseptic
quality to them;  one couple, Barbara (Feeney) and Jerry (Schreiber)
meet, and conduct a torrid affair without ever once experiencing
physical contact. But, of course, that's exactly the point, since all of
them have become little more than mere extensions of their
electronic equipment (underscored, with a delectably nasty touch, by
the manner in which their friend is found dead).</P>
<P>        Into this emotionally sterile existence bounces Denise (Ubach),
the outsider who literally takes advantage of one of the group during
one of his weaker moments.  It seems that Martin (Gunther) decided
to "do his bit" for society by donating to a local sperm bank.  One of
Denise's friends, who works at the sperm bank, made the donor's
identity known to Denise, who begins to flood Martin with phone call
after phone call with details of her pregnancy while travelling on
various forms of public conveyance (unlike the others, she is not
afraid of the outdoors;  whenever any of them venture outside of
their individual spheres of influence, bad things seem to happen to
them).  Everyone in the group becomes involved in the pregnancy's
progress, and its effect upon the group's dynamics, or lack thereof.</P>
<P>        "Denise Calls Up" is the type of film that will either cause you
to laugh knowingly, but uncomfortably, at your own plugged-in
existence, or it will set your teeth on edge at the monotonously
self-indulgent antics of a group of immature people who, deep down,
are  not only afraid of having a life, but of even getting one.  As if to
underscore just how much, the film cleverly maintains the rhythm of
their short and essentially meaningless communications through
considerable amounts of cross-cutting;  the audience never gets to
see each individual for much more than a few seconds on-screen.
After a while, it becomes quite obvious that, if technology did not
exist as their excuse, it would become necessary for them to invent,
something -- anything -- to take its place.  When these people use
words like "responsibility" and "commitment", you can hear their
voices choking on the terminology.  They have more than a good idea
as to what those terms mean for them:  a relationship equals
compromise which equals a loss of self.  And, although you can't lose
what you never had, that is one fact that they all keep safely at a
distance.  Unfortunately, the more willful forms of self-delusion
have never been a trait exclusive to any era.</P>
<P>        To his credit, Selwyn has assembled a marvelous cast to
conduct his broken-telephone comedy of errors.  Standouts include
Gunther and Ubach as the unlikely expectant parents, whose budding
relationship (in more ways than one) becomes a necessary fulcrum
for balancing the almost farcical solipsism that embodies the rest
of the film.  Sylvia Miles is unhealthily funny as Gale's yenta of an
aunt.  So, if you've been staring at a computer screen too long,
"Denise Calls Up" just might be the recharge you're looking for.</P>
