<PRE>Life is Beautiful
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4) LA VITA É BELLA (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) is a lightweight
drama. Directed by and starring one of Italy's greatest living comics,
it naturally contains some comic scenes. I mention these facts up-front
because they become interesting once you know that half the film is set
in a Nazi prison camp.</P>
<P>Mixing humor and concentration camps is audacious, and it has stirred a
healthy amount of controversy. Some say that the very idea cheapens the
memory of those who lost their lives. Frankly, it's hard to argue with
that point of view. If you can't forgive a movie for attempting such a
combination, you should skip it.</P>
<P>However, if you're willing to be open, Benigni handles the mix very
well. By focusing on the bond between father and son, and only drawing a
sketchy picture of the horrible life of Jewish prisoners, Benigni moved
and shrunk the target for criticism, and he allowed the small human
story to bloom.</P>
<P>The movie begins like any other light romantic drama. It is Italy,
before the war. Guido (Benigni) is a waiter with a penchant for riddles.
He is in love with a woman whom he's met only once. Through a series of
coincidences (some of them arranged) he finally gets to know Dora
(Nicoletta Braschi), the woman of his dreams.</P>
<P>Guido learns that Dora, a schoolteacher, is already promised to someone
"better," someone with more prestige and money than him. Nevertheless,
he persists in pursuing her affections.</P>
<P>Guido's charm is amazing. In one of the finest comic set pieces on film,
several gags, which have been set up over about 20 minutes of screen
time, are paid off, one by one, all to impress a beautiful girl. The
effect marvelous, both for the audience and for Dora.</P>
<P>One evening at a party, the cheerful harmony of the film starts to
shift. A horse of Guido's uncle has been painted bright green with
anti-Semitic slogans. A handful of partygoers, interested in the new
German situation, talk casually about mathematical word problems
involving money saved by executing cripples. Nevertheless, the film's
melody remains bright, for this is the night that Guido finally captures
Dora's heart, her soul, and her body.</P>
<P>The film cuts forward in time. Italy has changed drastically, especially
for Italian Jews. Guido now has a son, to whom he teaches meekness in
the face of repressive Italian authority. Meekness is life. The
alternative is death. And as the title reminds us, life - any life - is
beautiful.</P>
<P>Although he doesn't deal with the mistreatment of Jews as a whole,
Benigni shows how institutionalized racism affected a single ordinary
man. On their way home one day Guido and his son Giosué (Girogio
Cantarini) encounter a storefront sign that says "No Jews or Dogs."</P>
<P>How would you explain this sign, not as a historian, but as a father to
your son? How do you tell him what it means without blackening his
heart? Guido not only answers his son's questions, he does it in a way
that removes them from the cruelty, and elevates them above their cold
reality. In addition, it illustrates for the audience how childish the
sign really is.</P>
<P>Needless to say, the sign was a sign of worse things to come. It isn't
long before Guido and his son are shipped off to a prison camp. Now
instead of a single insulting sign, Guido has a whole world, an entire
reality, to explain away.</P>
<P>In this last half of the film, Guido tries desperately to come up with
an elaborate explanation of their situation. They are not in a prison
camp, they are playing an extended game. There are rules, opponents, and
points earned for bravery and for not talking. If they can only earn
1,000 points, they will win a tank and get to go home.  </P>
<P>The real heart of the movie is that Guido doesn't see anything fun about
his "game." He loves his son so much that he will risk everything, not
just to protect his body, but to protect his mind and soul as well. The
task is overwhelming, and it seems doomed to failure, but Guido refuses
to quit.</P>
<P>It is this indomitable struggle for some tiny shred of goodness and
hope, in the face of an overwhelming evil, that makes this film so
moving.</P>
<P>Benigni is great in the role of Guido. He knows that fighting the
situation head-on is futile. All he can do is smirk at the absurdity of
the Nazi ideology. But Benigni is careful never to laugh too hard, and
he never pretends he can fight head-on as a prisoner. He plays the part
with an ironic resignation that is perfect for this film.</P>
<P>This film has stirred resentment and disdain in some critics. That a
light, often humorous drama is set in a Nazi prison camp are an
unacceptable mix, they say. Others blame the director for deliberately
using that combination to push buttons and pull strings.</P>
<P>While I wouldn't argue with them - I don't think I could say anything to
change their minds - I do disagree. To the first objection I would say
that Benigni has as much right to set a story in a prison camp as any
other filmmaker. While his depiction wasn't as grim or graphic as in
other films, he still handled the setting with an appropriate gravity.</P>
<P>To the second objection, I would say: let your buttons be pushed and
your strings be pulled. Why else do we go to movies if not to be moved?</P>
<P>Giving myself to the film, I was rewarded with one of the most moving
and crushing films in years. Though I often cry at movies, I rarely lose
control. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, and its simple message that life - any life
- is beautiful, nearly succeeded.</P>
