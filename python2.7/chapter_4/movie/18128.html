<PRE>LITTLE VOICE (1998)
Rating = *** out of ******

<P>In a drab English seaside town, Mari Hoff (Brenda Blethyn) whiles
away her middle-aged widowhood in her chaotic home (a closed up
record shop) in the local pub. However, she is the last to admit
that age is overtaking her, as she totters about in high heels,
gaudy make-up and low-cut, tight-fitting tops. She blatantly
flirts with the two phone engineers who install her phone, making
fun of the shy younger Billy (Ewan McGregor) and his hobby (he
keeps homing pigeons). She also screams constantly at her painfully
shy daughter, LV (Jane Horrocks). LV (which stands for Little Voice
because she is so shy) spends every day in her bedroom which is
the only neat room in an otherwise slovenly house. There, she listens
to records by Edith Piaf, Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland and others,
that her dead father had given to her.</P>
<P>One night, when Mari lurches home from the pub with a washed-up
showbiz promoter called Ray Say (Michael Caine) for a bit of slap
and tickle, LV breaks into song. She can imitate any of the singers
whose records she has listened to for years. Ray sees her as a way
of establishing his showbiz credentials and a means of escape from
the grotty venues and third-rate acts that he normally peddles. He
cajoles her into performing in public (by persuading her that her
dead father would approve), and begins to plot her (and his future)
career. Meanwhile, Billy (who glimpsed her while installing her
mother's phone) tries to meet with her again - since both of them
are so shy, the relationship develops very slowly indeed.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Jim Cartwright is based on his own play The
Rise and Fall of Little Voice, which also starred Jane Horrocks.
The leitmotif of a caged bird is firmly established and relentlessly
re-affirmed throughout the movie. Both LV and Billy are too shy to
fly free of their shackles - Billy's pigeons are an obvious reminder
of their straitened circumstances. However, the film itself never
flutters free from its stage origins. Cartwright and director (and
co-writer) Mark Herman don't make use of the extra possibilities by
transferring the story from stage to screen. The result is that some
of the performances are a little too theatrical - dialogue delivered
to a live audience requires a more subtle touch for cinema. Brenda
Blethyn's performance garnered her a Golden Globe nomination and an
Academy Award nomination for a performance which teeters between
overwrought and over-the-top, and lapses into parody on several
occasions. It's a pity because the character is well written. Michael
Caine fares better as the down-at-heel impresario, and deserves his
Golden Globe award. Ewan McGregor is quietly effective as a minor
character, but it is Jane Horrocks that grabs the attention.</P>
<P>Jane Horrocks has had a varied acting career - she captured headlines
for a hard-hitting version of Macbeth (which involved her character
urinating on stage nightly) but is probably best known as Bubbles,
the airhead assistant in Absolutely Fabulous. She performs all the
singing in Little Voice, and she is an excellent mimic as well as
singer. However, there isn't much singing in the film. There is,
however, a lot of screaming and shouting, courtesy of Blethyn, and
as the movie progresses, the story becomes ever more predictable.
It is also surprisingly grim, though there are nice flashes of comedy. 
Unfortunately, there are not enough of them, and the story is not 
sufficiently plausible or strong to work as a straight drama. Herman's 
previous directorial effort was Brassed Off, which shares many of the 
bittersweet, small-scale sensibilities of Little Voice (as well as Ewan 
McGregor). However, despite his best efforts, Little Voice never really 
escapes from its stage origins, and the film never really hits the high 
notes that Horrocks' talent could have delivered.</P>
