<PRE>                                RICHARD III
                       A film review by Martin Rich
                        Copyright 1996 Martin Rich</PRE>
<P>Shakespeare's plays contain some of the most graphic descriptions of 
inhumanity ever.  We tend to overlook these, perhaps because we are used 
to quite decorous productions of Shakespeare, but this adaptation of 
Richard III for the cinema proves that Shakespeare is still well able to 
shock.</P>
<P>There is, in fact, blood and gore a-plenty.  We have children being 
suffocated, a man stabbed while having sex tied to a bedpost, one of the 
King's brothers attacked in his bath, and a hospital of the most 
extraordinary grimness.  I wonder through what quirk of literary 
sensibility the film came to be classified as a '15' in Britain.</P>
<P>But, if you can stomach the violence, you will see a fine portrayal of an 
empire weighed down by decadence, and by lack of respect for human life. 
Ian McKellen is Richard, and also collaborated on distilling the 
screenplay from Shakespeare's original work.  As a callous, embittered, 
hunchback he is frightening - the more so because he is so cool and 
embittered.  The cast is tremendous - especially Annette Bening and 
Maggie Smith as two of the women caught in Richard's machinations.  
Shakespeare's text has been cut to little more than half its original 
length, but preserving much of the original wording and ensuring that the 
story moves on at an impressive pace.</P>
<P>Thanks to carefully designed sets, costumes (details such as the watch 
that Richard wears), music, and some terrific locations, the film has a 
fine and accurate period feel.  But it isn't Richard III's period, nor is 
it Shakespeare's.  This production is set in a mythical 1930s London, 
torn by civil war, and lest we doubt the sort of monarch that Richard 
was, his supporters wave red and white banners which owe a lot to Nazi 
imagery.</P>
<P>Setting Shakespeare out of his own time will always be controversial.  
But some of the best stage productions have been in twentieth century 
dress: during the 1980s the Royal Shakepeare Company transplanted the 
Merry Wives of Windsor to the 1950s, an age of 'new Elizabethans', and 
more recently the Royal Court staged King Lear in the early 20th century. 
In the same way, this adaptation uses its new context to advantage.  
Richard's fascist tendencies, and his predecessor's glamorous American 
wife, both have echoes of Edward VIII.  And Shakespeare's 
characterisation is timeless; he didn't write plays to be performed as 
period pieces, and it's appropriate that we don't see them as period 
pieces either.</P>
<P>Those locations deserve a few further remarks.  The 'tower' is actually 
Battersea Power Station.  For the final battle it is pictured overlooking 
a vast open space - Bosworth Field - in defiance of both history and 
geography, but to great effect.  The film owes a lot to the Gilbert Scott 
family of architects, as St Pancras Station also appears on several 
occasions.  And there is Brighton Pavilion, its fanciful architecture and 
its associations with yet another generation of royalty making it into a 
symbol of royal decadence.  Shell-Mex House is the King's urban base.</P>
<P>If you're prepared to see Shakespeare in a new light, see this film.</P>
