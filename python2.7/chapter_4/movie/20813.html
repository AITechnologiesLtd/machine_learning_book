<P>Gorgeous scenery and superb cinematography are not enough to
prevent this new film by Spanish director Julio Medem (The Red
Squirrel, etc) from becoming something of a gloomfest.  This is a love
story spanning some 25 years, and following two people whose lives are
governed by coincidence and chance.  It bears a vague resemblance to
Vincent Ward's dream-like Map Of The Human Heart.  But in that film
the lovers were separated by the gulf of international events like a
world war; here they are merely separated by personal problems,
misunderstandings and jealousy.</P>
<P>Otto (Fele Martinez) and Ana (Najwa Nimri) first meet as eight
year olds attending neighbouring schools.  They are intrigued by the
fact that both their names are palindromes.  But the pair soon share
more, as Otto's father falls in love with Ana's widowed mother.  As
they reach adolescence, Ana and Otto become illicit lovers.  When
Otto's mother dies, he is consumed by guilt and runs away to find his
destiny as a mail pilot flying to remote corners.  Ana follows her own
path, but the pair can never quite forget each other.  As their lives
take them in different directions, their paths occasionally cross even
though they are unaware of it.  Finally, Ana moves to a remote cabin
on the Arctic circle where she awaits an ill-fated reconciliation with
Otto.</P>
<P>The philosophy behind Lovers Of The Arctic Circle seems to be
that life goes in cycles, and everything follows a predetermined
pattern.  The film's structure unfolds in a neat circle as Medem takes
us from the opening prologue back to the same events, and there is a
lot of repetition of smaller and insignificant events.  Medem's
sometimes allusive style sees events unfold from the different
perspectives of its two central characters.</P>
<P>Medem takes his time in allowing the story to unfold, and
often Lovers Of the Arctic Circle seems to be going in circles,
heading nowhere fast.  Medem uses ominous symbolism and obtuse
narrative styles to tell his epic tale, and the result is occasionally
boring and repetitive.  There seems to be a lack of real passion here,
and a suspension of disbelief is required to accept some of Medem's
more fanciful coincidences.  However, Gonzalo F Berridi's
cinematography is sumptuous, creating a series of haunting images, and
he brings a rich visual quality to the film.  The stunning locations,
ranging from Madrid to Helsinki, also enrich the movie.</P>
<P>The cast give solid performances, although newcomer Peru
Medem, who plays Otto as an 8 year old, is a standout and brings a
seriousness and soulfulness beyond his years to the role.</P>
