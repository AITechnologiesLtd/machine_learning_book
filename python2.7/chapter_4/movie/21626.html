 Being John Malkovich (1999) 4 stars out of 4. Starring John Cusack,
Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman. Directed by Spike Jonze</P>
<P> If you want a different type of movie experience, than "Being John
Malkovich" is it.</P>
<P> A true original, "Being John Malkovich" is a surreal journey. If you wish
the vicarious adventure of knowing what it's like to walk in another
person's shoes, than this is your ticket.</P>
<P> What makes "Being John Malkovich" so appealing is its primal familiarity.
It taps into a universal fantasy: How would it be to live the life of a
celebrity for day? An hour? Or even 15 minutes?</P>
<P> It's a dream we all share. And Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) surely
qualifies as a dreamer.</P>
<P> Craig is a puppeteer who creates elaborate, cerebral shows using his
puppets who - coincidentally look like him and his wife, Lotte (an almost
unrecognizable Cameron Diaz).</P>
<P> Lotte, who works at a pet store and tends injured and sick animals in her
and Craig's basement apartment, convinces Craig to look for a job since he
is not earning much of a living as a puppeteer.</P>
<P> Because he has fast hands, Craig gets a job as a file clerk at LesterCorp,
located on 7 1/2th floor of Manhattan's Mertin-Flemmer office building.</P>
<P> It also is where he meets Maxine (Catherine Keener), a free-spirited young
woman who becomes Craig's obsession. However, he's just another loser to
her.</P>
<P> One day, trying to retrieve a file that falls behind a cabinet, Craig
uncovers a small passageway. He climbs in and gets sucked through a tunnel.
Next thing he knows he is seeing through the eyes of John Malkovich.</P>
<P> To tell any more would ruin the absolute surprise and wonder of this most
unusual, bizarre and unique feature.</P>
<P> Suffice it to say that Craig and Maxine join forces and charge a $200 fee
for allowing people to traverse the portal and enter the mind of Malkovich.
The trip is fleeting, lasting only 15 minutes before the traveler is dumped
along the New Jersey Turnpike. I told you this is a weird movie.</P>
<P> Yet :Being John Malkovich" is so disarming, so much fun that you sit in
the dark and wish you were the one on screen taking the plunge.</P>
<P> The script for "Being John Malkovich" was written by Charlie Kaufman. It
is his debut feature, and a more auspicious beginning I cannot imagine.
Kaufman's name will be among those listed for original screenplay come
Oscar roll call, and I wouldn't be surprised if he walks away with the
statue.</P>
<P> Cusack, as usual, gives a brilliant performance as a man who likes the
pull the strings - literally. With his discovery, he becomes the ultimate
puppet master, using Malkovich to serve his own selfish ends.</P>
<P> Diaz is at first a bit drap and unkempt as Lotte, but as her fascination
with Malkovich builds, her looks and demeanor seem to improve. It's a nice
comic turn.</P>
<P> Keener nearly steals the film as the amoral Maxine who - at first - only
sees profit in the Malkovich venture. She deserves a supporting actress
Academy Award nomination.</P>
<P> And then there is John Malkovich. What a sport. What a performance. To
allow himself to be used - and abused - as he does shows not only what a
trouper he is, but what a selfless and generous talent he possesses.
Clearly, Malkovich knows who he is and is comfortable in his own skin. He
must also own one hell of a sense of humor.</P>
<P> Kaufman and director Spike Jonze (Mark Wahlberg's ill-fated GI comrade in
"Three Kings"), making his feature film debut, have created some very
surreal moments, especially one in which Malkovich enters the portal to get
inside his own head. It is hilarious, wild and a bit scary - almost
something out of a Luis Bunuel movie. The film, despite its comic emphasis,
has a tragic undertone that helps keep everything grounded in a straunge
kind of reality.</P>
<P> "Being John Malkovich" is that rarity, a movie that stands apart. Nothing
like it has been seen before, and I doubt they'll be many filmmakers trying
to copy it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime, "Alice in Wonderland"-like look
at obsession, self-discovery and love. Don't miss it.</P>
