                                BLACK RAIN
                       A film review by Steve Miller
                   (this review is in the public domain)</PRE>
<P>Capsule:  A streetwise superman from the NYPD loses a prisoner upon delivery in
Japan.  While tracking the prisoner down, he finds time to point out some basic
flaws in Japanese society, break a number of laws, witness the death of his
partner and reaffirm the fundamental superiority of western man.</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas is a great actor, capable of range and depth.
Unfortunately, he exhibits neither in Ridley Scott's deeply bigoted film,
BLACK RAIN.  Douglas and his detective partner from New York witness a killing
of and by a Japanese man.  They capture the killer, but are not allowed the
"collar" for themselves.  Instead, they are ordered to return him to Japan,
where he is a wanted man.</P>
<P>     Nick (Douglas) resents his orders, but complies, partly to avoid the
scrutiny of the "suits," who are investigating him for theft.  Upon arrival in
Japan, Nick loses his prisoner to members of Japan's organized crime, disguised
as local police.  Understandably upset, he offers to help in the prisoner's
recapture.  The local police are cool, but courteous, and drag Nick and partner
around as "observers."  Unhappy with that limiting role, Nick bends, breaks and
otherwise nullifies the rules under which his hosts expect him to behave.</P>
<P>     A local detective, whom Nick calls "Mass," since he apparently cannot say
(any more than I can spell) his real polysyllabic name, follows Nick, trying to
keep him out of trouble, while the Japanese police attempt to do their jobs.  </P>
<P>     Further summation of the story would be spoiling, so I won't go on.  The
point, of course, is that Nick is a stranger in a strange land.  As such he is
naturally open to some culture shock.  Being a headstrong cop, Nick responds by
clinging to his own culture, his own ways and by refusing to consider local
customs as options.  The film thereby sets Nick up for a catharsis; some point
must come when he confronts the inappropriateness of his New York bred methods
when they are transplanted to another country.  When Nick is forced to watch
the murder of his New York partner, that moment has clearly come.  Surely, he
must search his soul, finally to take the advice Mass has given him, that he is
"part of a group," and should "consider the Japanese way."  Surely.  Surely....
Nah...  .</P>
<P>     The Japanese way never gets a chance, even though this is Japan.  Nick
finally solves his problems (and some of those he creates for Mass) in a Rambo
fashion; very American.  When the climax came, and Nick refused to admit his
errors, the film changed from interesting to maddening.  He is never made to
confront his own biases, or his own shortcomings.  Instead, fate plays along
with him, granting either victory or good excuses for failure (i.e.  the local
police let the bad guys get away).</P>
<P>     Now, as anti-Japanese as this film is, it is nonetheless a stunning piece.
Scott's vision of Japan is a mirror of his future city in BLADERUNNER.  It is
atmospheric, high-tech and pays its bills by the megawatt.  Visually, this is
great stuff.  And, if one is fond of the street-smart-cop vs.  The Great Big
Machine kind of story, one might like BLACK RAIN.  Not this one.  If once, just
*once*, it had seemed that Nick gained something of value by trying the
Japanese way, I might feel different.  But it didn't, so I don't.</P>
<P>     BLACK RAIN is a brilliantly directed, visually gripping film, with a good
story and some terrific action.  Sad to say, those features will probably
make it one of the highest grossing works of self indulgence and bigotry
of the year.  4 out of 4 for execution, 2 out of 4 for artistic honesty.
