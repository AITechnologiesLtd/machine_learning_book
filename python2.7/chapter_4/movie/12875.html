<P>"Bulworth" is something of a mess. But it is a Good Mess. It  is the first
summer film that I saw on my return from the Cannes Film Festival --and I
feel pretty good about it. I wish it had been selected for Cannes instead
some other US movies. Had this been the case, I guess that "Bulworth"'s
strong, idiomatic hip-hop dialogue, its African-American nature, its
in-references, would have puzzled the public. Yet its liberalism and
reformism would have found a receptive audience among the French and other
nationals who are much more militant than the Americans.</P>
<P>For Warren Beatty it's a strong comeback after the insipid, flat fiasco of
1994's  "Love Affair," a re-remake of two earlier movies --the first one
excellent, the second good. In version 3, Beatty had co-written, produced
it and sort of starred, along with wife Annette Bening. In "Bulworth" he is
the movie by his presence, plus co-producing, co-scripting, as well as solo
directing -- the latter for the third time, following his "Reds" and "Dick
Tracy."</P>
<P>Beatty directs himself as incumbent California Senator Jay Bulworth, a
Democrat, whom we meet in the last three days of the 1996 primaries. In his
Washington office, surrounded by photographs of 1960s liberal icons JB
keeps clicking his remote control, watching on the monitor an endless
parade of his campaign footage that endlessly uses his inane slogan "We
stand at the doorstep of a new millennium." The man hasn't slept or eaten
in days. In a near-catatonic state of depression, he takes stock of his
sorry condition, his abuses of power and betrayals of a political past that
once was rife with post-New Deal, Kennedyite ideals. Like too many others,
he's sold his soul to the company store.</P>
<P>The opening sequences are brilliant, hard acts to follow. Additional deft
strokes show Jay's entourage, make us aware of his corruption. Promising a
lobbyist for the insurance industry his help in defeating a plan that would
provide coverage for the have-nots, Jay extracts a ten million dollar
freebie, a life insurance to be paid to his (unseen throughout the film)
daughter. With a sleazy middleman, Bulworth arranges for a contract -- on
his own life. A breakdown can't go any further. It may seem unbelievable
but it is fascinating.</P>
<P>Landing in California, acting oddly from alcohol and his breakdown,
Bulworth is whisked off to a black church of South Central Los Angeles,
where things get curiouser and curiouser for an audience who couldn't guess
in a million years that the Senator's decision to end it all has freed him
to --in 60s parlance -- "tell it like it is." And does he tell them!
Throwing away his speech, with  total honesty, he scolds (with some
affection) the African-Americans about their shortcomings then denounces
(with no affection) the white Establishment that keeps no promises and does
nothing for a minority that cannot contribute millions to politicians.</P>
<P>Panicked, his chief-of-staff (Oliver Platt) throws a fire alarm. All rush
out. Somehow Nina, a gorgeous young woman (Halle Berry) and her two perky
female friends get into Jay's stretch limo, along with the Senator's men
and a videographer from CNN. They all find their way to a Beverly Hills
reception by showbiz personalities whom the Senator shocks by continuing
his stream of criticisms and unpleasant verities. The next stop is an
all-black, all-night disco, with gang-like figures and much snorting of
white stuff. Jay carouses, dances non-stop with Nina, boozes, and,
surprise! discovers a new joie-de-vivre.</P>
<P>At dawn, this entourage moves to a fund-raiser at the Beverly Wilshire,
where the unkempt Jay in a wine-stained shirt, goes now on a veritable
rampage of denunciations. He stupefies the audience with a merciless
harangue, magically delivered in rhyming rap-style. It's unbelievable but
also powerful and funny. While, in spite of the abundance of the f and the
m-f words this is no genuine protest rap, it serves its purpose, is
entirely comprehensible to white ears, and adds to the many outrageously
comic elements of the movie. From now on, it will be the Senator's main
mode of communicating. His transformation gets increasingly weird, to the
point of his dressing like a homeboy. Valiantly, Beatty keeps up his
specialty, found in many of his films no matter what the role, that is, a
self-mocking goofiness through thick and thin, here even as, with his new
taste for life, Jay now frantically tries to rescind the contract on
himself.Complications and episodes pile up.</P>
<P>Beatty, always a card-carrying, liberal activist among the Hollywoodians,
but unlike most of them, semper fidelis, gives his all to his role in
"Bulworth." His heart is in the right place, his old pretty-boyishness  (in
spite of the tiniest eyes this side of Norma Shearer and Dianne Wiest) has
given way to his uncamouflaged 61 years. The real Beatty may have a high
I.Q. but most of his screen personae have looked dim to me. In "Bulworth"
this works in his favor, since I share with many the impression that too
many politicos are more canny than brainy.</P>
<P>Jay is in a state of divine madness. Almost infectious is his relish in
exposing the infinite ambitions and corrupting mega-powers of corporate
America and multi-national conglomerates that buy and sell  politicians.
His denunciations of the puppets in government are vibrant. Even though his
targets do not include everyone, viewers probably sense that the
accusations cover untold numbers of office-holders, from petty officials to
ward heelers (who are not healers) on up.</P>
<P>With the focus so persistently on Bulworth, the very able supporting cast
(meaning everyone else), hardly ever goes beyond sketchiness. In context
this would be no filmic sin, except that a surplus of directions taken and
characters shown, some key roles -- like Nina's-- remain hazy. There are
needless red herrings too. The finale is strictly from hunger.</P>
<P>Among the in-jokes popping up is writer Amiri Baraka ( ne LeRoi Jones)  as
a presumably homeless old fellow who, in indistinct ways, plays soothsayer,
chorus or cheerleader to  Bulworth. He could have been skipped. But the
contract-killer device is no gimmick, since it gives Jay his freedom of
thought and of speech. Coincidentally, the mysterious hired assassin and a
major change of mind were the engine of Vyacheslav Krishtofovich's fine
Ukrainian movie "A Friend of the Deceased" (1997), very recently released
in the U.S.</P>
<P>Beatty's decision to use literally and symbolically Black America as his
main leitmotif is a strong, clever focus, but here comes the major rub. In
his too-quick immersion into black culture, Jay shows us a very real
subculture that has life and soul (good), but also an under-culture (bad)
of drug-dealing, gun-toting, profanity-prone adults as well as kids.
Unwittingly and unconsciously -- I'm sure, -- and probably because the
scriptwriters got carried away and were unable to have a tighter structure
that would consider all the trees in the woods, Beatty and Pisker demean
the millions of neglected, minority Americans who, against the odds, try to
live decent lives.</P>
<P>If you haven't  guessed by now, "Bulworth" is a postmodern (whatever that
means), hip-hop variant of Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" or
"Meet John Doe." Although basically as sentimental and unlikely as those
movies, its savage truths make of it a daring, fresh political work more
than a fantasy.</P>
<P>P.S. Some statistics. Beatty, in 37 years of movies, has been in some two
dozen films, an average of 0.64 per annum. In an earlier generation,
Gregory Peck, in 49 years, was in 59 movies, a rate of 0.83 per annum.
Earlier yet, in the keep-churning-them-out studio age, in 37 years (like
Beatty), Clark Gable made about 75 films, an annual rate of 2.02.</P>
