PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>Krippendorf's Tribe.  A movie about a guy who lies about stuff to get
free money.  It sounds like the plot for the new Pauly Shore movie (and
who decided to stop letting him make films?).  Unfortunately, it's the
latest vehicle for Richard Dreyfuss (Mr. Holland's Opus), who either
doesn't read his scripts anymore or saw Ace Ventura 2: When Nature
Calls…and really really liked it.</P>
<P>Dreyfuss stars as James Krippendorf, a chaotic unkempt archeology
professor at an unnamed university.  As the film opens, we finds James
nodding off while watching home videos of a New Guinea trip that he took
with his wife and children.  It seems that he and his wife, who was also
an archeology professor, were in search of a `lost tribe' that has never
had contact with outsiders.  I remember reading about a tribe like this
in the seventh grade, and I was just as frigging bored then, too.</P>
<P>James wakes up from his flashback to a filthy cluttered home he shares
with his three kids.  Apparently, his wife has died and James has used
the grant money they had earned to keep the family afloat financially.
Talk about a great role model for all of those current (and future)
single fathers out there.</P>
<P>Things begin to spin out of control when Veronica (Elfman, Dharma &
Greg), an adoring former student who is now a new professor at the
university, pops in to remind James about his big lecture on the lost
tribe.  Big lecture!  Oh, no.  James has forgotten all about it and is
completely unprepared.  The humanity of it all!</P>
<P>Now, your average person in this situation might fib a little bit to get
out of a jam and hope that the problem just goes away, but not our
James.  He not only confirms his contact with the lost tribe, but also
makes up facts that are so astounding that he effectively turns the
archeological community on its collective ear.</P>
<P>Igniting the public's interest with his marvelous story, James is
pressured to produce video of the tribe.  Again, the average person
would probably be able to quickly sidestep this issue, but not our
James.  He actually decorates his back yard and dresses his kids up to
film a faux version of his fantasy tribe.  The tape generates more
excitement and James must make more phony tapes to quell the teaming
masses.</P>
<P>The ensuing scenes are predictable and, for the most part, boring.
James does get to dry hump his Father-in-law (Tom Poston, Newhart) while
dressed as the leader of the tribe.  Oh, yeah, and he somehow cons a
drunken Veronica into face paint and shags her rotten while filming the
entire event as a tribal mating ritual.  And there is a scene at the end
when James and Veronica have to keep switching in and out of the
tribesman costume that is very reminiscent of The Brady Bunch Halloween
episode where Peter has two dates and one thinks he's Frankenstein and
the other thinks that…oh, just forget it.</P>
<P>Dreyfuss tries to be hilariously over-the-top (as in Jim Carrey) and
Elfman seems wasted in an underdeveloped role.  The kids, led by Natasha
Lyonne (Everyone Says I Love You), are a predictable bunch: the eldest
is the mother figure, the middle one wants a dog and the youngest hasn't
spoken since Mom died.  And we never find out why she died either.  I
expected more from Todd Holland, who also directs the outstanding HBO
series, The Larry Sanders Show.</P>
<P>The truly amazing feat is that these archaeological experts are so
easily duped.  James would have needed an eight-camera shoot to pull off
the video that he presented to them.  They somehow don't seem to grasp
the idea of film editing.  Wrap that up with an ending so implausible
that it actually gave me diarrhea, and you've got yourself one fine
picture.</P>
