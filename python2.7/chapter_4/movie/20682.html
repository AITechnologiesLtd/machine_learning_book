<P>For film buffs, there are few things more annoying than movie trailers 
that give away too much of the plot. The pinnacle of this peculiar form 
of marketing comes with the promotional campaign for "Double Jeopardy," a 
"Fugitive" knock-off starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. If you've 
seen the commercials for the film, there's no need to visit the theater, 
because the ads are a veritable Cliffs Notes version of the thriller, 
spilling every major plot point of the story. </P>
<P>Here's what the ads reveal (SPOILER ALERT: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS THE 
ENTIRE PLOT). We open with Ashley Judd and Bruce Greenwood, sailing 
happily on a sunny day. Cut to night, as Ashley searches for her husband. 
She finds a bloody knife on the deck and picks it up, just in time for 
the Coast Guard to appear and order her not to move. Cut to a man 
informing the stunned Ashley that a $2 million insurance policy would 
certainly be considered motive for murder. Ashley exclaims "I didn't kill 
my husband!" Cut to Ashley in prison, as the announcer intones "In prison 
for a crime she didn't commit... " Cut to a woman answering the phone 
with Ashley's son at her side. Just as mother and child begin their 
tender phone reunion, we see the father walk in the door. The young lad 
happily shouts "Daddy!" Cut to a close up of Ashley, shocked beyond 
belief as she realizes the truth. Cut to a fellow inmate, who explains to 
Ashley that having already been committed of murdering her husband, she 
could now kill him without fear of legal repercussions, thanks to the 
"double jeopardy" rule that protects a defendant from being tried twice 
for the same crime. Cut to Ashley, out of prison, being pursued by Tommy 
Lee Jones. Cut to an elderly lady informing Ashley that the man she is 
searching for recently lost his new wife in a "tragic accident." Ashley 
nods knowingly. Cut to Tommy Lee, telling an officer "Did you ever arrest 
anybody you thought was innocent?" Cut to Ashley, confronting her husband 
while holding a gun in her hand and saying "I could shoot you in the 
middle of Mardi Gras and the cops couldn't do a thing." Cut to Tommy Lee, 
who tells the man "As a former law professor, I can assure you she's 
correct." The panicked hubby begs for help, only to have Tommy Lee smile 
wryly and say "Why are you talking to me? She has the gun." (END 
SPOILERS)</P>
<PRE>Sheesh!</PRE>
<P>For the benefit of those who skipped the spoiler section and didn't see 
the ads, the film, which starts in the Northwest and ends in New Orleans, 
is an idiotic potboiler, redeemed only slightly by pretty scenery, a 
couple of well-staged chase scenes and the presence of Ashley Judd and 
Tommy Lee Jones (although why they are slumming in glossy trash like this 
is beyond me). "Double Jeopardy" is fun only as a guilty pleasure, one of 
those "so-bad-that-it's good" movies. Unless you're a fan of that genre, 
I suggest you simply watch the commercial and save 105 minutes of your 
life.</P>
