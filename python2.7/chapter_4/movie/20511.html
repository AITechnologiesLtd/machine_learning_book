<P>   So you want a woman to like you, to feel desire for you? 
Forget yohimbe and Spanish fly.  Instead, become highly
successful, preferably a celebrity.  Females are attracted to
alpha males the way felines are captivated by catnip.  If
you're a rock star--or even just a major-league baseball
player--don't be surprised if you're surrounded by groupies,
people who will offer you everything they have for the mere
thrill of being with you, of having your renown rub off on
them.</P>
<P>   "For Love of the Game" is about a celebrity whose girl
friend is no groupie.  She's not greatly impressed by her
man's name and fame but is nonetheless in love with him.  
Something keeps them apart, the typical motif of just about every
romantic comedy or drama. In films of this nature, the leading
man and principal woman have a passion for each other, but
a barrier is put in the way of their happiness.  Each time they
feel the potentiality of getting together for good, something
stands in the way.  In "For Love of the Game"--about a 40-
year-old pitcher for the Detroit Tigers whose life comes
simultaneously to a professional and amorous crossroad--a
woman's unwillingness to share her man with his love of the
game is that obstruction.  </P>
<P>   Sam Raimi, whose writing and direction run the gamut from
cult horror works like "The Evil Dead" to surreal comedies like
"The Hudsucker Proxy," appropriately casts Kevin Costner as
the middle-aged ball player who has just been traded from
the Tigers and is engaged in what may be the last game of
his flourishing career.  On the mound against the New York
Yankees, Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) meditates upon a
romantic attachment of the past five years, talking to himself
each time a Yankee comes to bat.  Already assured a slot in
the Cooperstown Hall of Fame, he wonders whether he will
himself strike out in the love department.  Jane Aubrey (Kelly
Preston) has assured herself a slot in his mind and has fallen
for this larger-than-life fellow, but she is not particularly
impressed by baseball and needs a full-time husband and not
one who is regularly besieged for autographs and importuned
by other women.  The movie recalls Hal Ashby's messy,
disjoined 1985 story "The Slugger's Wife," about a baseball
star who falls in love with a singer.  The singer, played by
Rebecca De Mornay, is not awed by the role of a player's
wife who must dutifully follow her hero around and sit in the
box seats with the other players' wives.</P>
<P>   "For Love of the Game" has a script that is not so much
lame as it is predictable and sticky.  A feel-good movie in
every sense ("Waterboy" for a more mature audience), "For
Love of the Game" is overlong at (count 'em) 137 minutes, a
span that allows Raimi to display Costner winding up and
throwing curves and speedballs as incessantly as those
automated games in theme parks.  Whenever Yankee
Stadium is not in the foreground, Raimi focuses on the off-
again, on-again relationship of Billy and Jane, who approach
and depart like two dogs, each unsure of the other, who
advance and retreat in a comic dance of indecision.</P>
<P>   Billy Chapel is about to pitch that most uncommon of
rarities, the perfect game.  Reminiscing on his life, he takes
us back to his youthful days when he had acquired a love of
the game, his dad playing catcher to the little-leaguer and
encouraging the boy's dream of becoming a big-time hurler. 
The major portion, however, deals with his relationship over
the past five years with Jane Aubrey, whom he meets on the
highway when he stops to help her fix her disabled auto. 
Inviting her to watch him in what turns out to be her first
baseball game, he is wrapped up in himself, unaware that
she is not as immersed as he in the game and that she is
embarrassed to sit with the players' wives (where she
overhears one whispering about her being yet another of
Billy's girl friends).  Following Michael Shaara's posthumously
published novel, Dana Stevens's script tracks the progress of
the romance, as Jane appears enchanted with Billy's tight-
lipped demeanor but annoyed by his lack of focus on her and
on her teen-aged daughter Heather (Jena Malone).</P>
<P>   While Costner and Preston display reasonable chemistry
together, their dialogue is as pat as the ballpark scenes  are
formulaic.  Raimi waxes sentimental in both areas, showing a
Billy Chapel who is determined to pitch only to his best friend,
catcher, Gus (John C. Reilly) and concerned to the point of
mushiness about his wavering girl friend.  The film does not
display the sharpness of Ron Shelton's 1988 "Bull Durham,"
largely because the script does not allow Preston to project
the charm of Susan Sarandon--who in "Durham" performed
as an intellectual groupie who is determined to mature one
ball player each season.  Well-lit, capably photographed
(especially in tracking Billy's whizzing fast balls), "For Love of
the Game" is watchable enough but ultimately forgettable.</P>
