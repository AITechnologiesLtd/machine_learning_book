<PRE>                                FALLING DOWN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Michael Douglas plays the kind of
     angry, hard-hitting role his father would have played.  After
     being pushed and chafed by society, one day he just decides
     to fight back at all the small annoyances that degrade the
     quality of life.  That may make him a villain but, as with
     Bernard Goetz, it is hard to condemn him.  Rating: high +1
     (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Life is a sort of social contract.  You put in your work at school and
then in your career.  You pay your dues and you expect to be paid back with
a reasonable level of happiness.  You expect to reap the rewards of your
work.  You expect to live in a society where the rules seem to make sense
and where justice prevails.  And, of course, all those expectations are in
varying degrees wrong.  If you walk places where you have a right to walk,
you are very liable to be beaten and robbed.  If you go into a convenience
store, you very often find prices are just too darn high.  The hamburger may
look good and juicy in the picture, but when you actually get it, it is
flat, dried out, and unsavory.</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas plays "D-Fens," a 30-something nerd with a crewcut who
by his accounting is just not getting his fair share out of life.  His
marriage has gone sour, his career has gone sour, and life just seems to
have picked him to dump on.  On a  hot day in Los Angeles with traffic at a
total standstill, he abandons his car and sets off on foot to get to his
daughter's birthday party and at the same time just let everybody know that
he is fed up.  Today he is going to make sure he gets satisfaction.
Overcharge him, and be prepared to have him take your store apart.  Push him
and he is going to push back.  Cheat him only in peril of your life.  Then
there is Prendergast (played by Robert Duvall).  On Prendergast's last day
of police work, he becomes fascinated by a string of incidents that he can
plot in a line on a map.  Somebody is fighting back against all the
indignities of life, the same ones that frustrate Prendergast, and
Prendergast has to stop him before he gets in serious trouble.</P>
<P>     FALLING DOWN is an angry howl against the deterioration in the quality
of life we all face.  Joel Schumacher directing from Ebbe Roe Smith's script
has created a villain cut from the same cloth as Bernard Goetz.  It is hard
not to sympathize with Douglas's angry man.  It would be easy to identify
Douglas's character with one political wing or the other, but as he goes
from venting his anger on a Korean grocer, to Latino gang members, to a
neo-Nazi, and finally to rich, selfish, over-paid whites, we see Douglas as
surprisingly center-of-the-road.  He is a Moderate who has run fresh out of
moderation.  This is a protest film that could have been made in the 1960s.
(My wife, I, and Vincent Canby independently thought to compare it to THE
SWIMMER.) Only toward the end does FALLING DOWN lose its power and become
somewhat prosaic.  But the film is angry and takes chances few Hollywood
films are anxious to take anymore.  I rate it a high +1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
