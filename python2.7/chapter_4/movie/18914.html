<P>(Dialog in Bengali, English subtitles)</P>
<P>The purpose of a vacation is often to forget the details of daily
life, using the fresh surroundings to cleanse the mind and to reflect
upon some aspects of life from a different perspective. The Choudhuri
family is spending a some time at the beautiful hill station of
Darjeeling doing just that, and as the story opens, they are nearing
the end of their trip. The majestic peak of Kanchenjungha has been
obscured by clouds, and likewise, some of the individuals are
symbolically having difficulty seeing with clarity what they want in
their own lives. The patriarch, Indranath (Chhabi Biswas) has no
problem understanding what has made him a powerful and successful
industrialist -- adopting the values of the system. His main concern
at the present time is the impending marriage of his youngest
daughter, Monisha (Alaknanda Roy). She is at a good age to marry, but
she has not completed her studies, and is unsure of what she wants
for herself. Indranath approves of the good match they have found
in Bannerjee (N. Viswanathan), who is a rising professional with a
bright future. However, Monisha fears he would make a dull, although
secure, husband.</P>
<P>Ashoke (Arun Mukherjee) is a struggling young man, on holiday with
his uncle, who had tutored Indranath's son Anil when he was a little
boy. By coincidence, they run into Indranath, and it seems to be
good fortune that they may be able to use this connection to land
Ashoke a job that he desperately needs. The meeting also offers an
introduction to Monisha who sees in Ashoke some characteristic that
she finds more appealing than Banerjee. Also with the family is
Monisha's older sister, Anima (Anubha Gupta), and her husband Shankar
(Subrata Sen Sharma), and it is clear that their relationship has
become strained.</P>
<P>Satyajit Ray displays the full force of his talent in this film.
In addition to producing and directing it, he wrote the original
screenplay and composed the original music. This was also Ray's
first color film, and the use of color is important because it
displays the natural beauty of Darjeeling as an integral component
of the film. (Ray returns to black and white for his next few films.)
All the characters are enchanted by the natural beauty, which fills
them with a sense of idealism and allows them to evaluate themselves.
Ray effectively communicates this through the visual imagery and
through the charming music.</P>
<P>The writing is exceptionally poignant in its decision to remain
understated. Although characters reach decisions at their turning
points, it is always clear that it was done in the intoxication of
idealism. The possibility that they may think differently when they
return to their mundane city lives is never expressed explicitly,
but it is an obvious possibility. The dilemma faced by Monisha is
usually not a dilemma in formulaic stories; often a woman is being
forced to marry a despicable man she dislikes while desiring a
virtuous man she cannot have. That is not the case here. Both men
are decent, likable men. Bannerjee is noticeably older than Monisha
and as a result he represents to her the selling of youthful idealism
for safe, drab existence. Her dilemma is not that she trying to
escape this path, but that she is not sure if it is what she wants.
When she comes to a decision, this will be a possibility.</P>
<P>The story contains many parallel subplots. As characters stroll
through the scenic hill station, they chance upon the other
characters and establish the many interconnected components of the
story as a whole. The viewer remains a detached observer, just like
the native villagers who are going about their daily lives as the
outsiders are on vacation.</P>
<P>The subplot of Anima and Shankar does not contribute as much as
the other component stories, but its inclusion adds a more dire
dimension that the other threads In contrast, the character of
Monisha's brother Anil (Anil Chatterjee) appears briefly, mostly
for comic relief. However, he also represents how some people have
the luxury of being light-hearted when dealing with issues that are
much more serious to others.</P>
<P>The acting in the film is uniformly superb, with the standout
performance being that of Indranath by Chhabi Biswas. Indranath
is a much deeper character than he may initially appear. Being that
the story takes place not long after Indian independence, his
admiration of all things British represents his knowledge of how to
work within the system. In the course of his stroll with Ashoke, he
delivers a long speech of his beliefs, which basically is a
demonstration of how he has sold out at every step and how he reaped
the rewards. He has been a complete success and "his lordship" usually
gets what he wants, but it is real concern and not selfishness that
guides him. This time, when the mist clears and characters see the
elusive Kanchenjungha, he may or may not get what he wants.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This one of Ray's more obscure films, but it is
a masterpiece. It interweaves several story lines into a rich
tapestry, and uses multiple layers of symbolism. Ray exercised total
creative input into the film and executed it flawlessly.</P>
