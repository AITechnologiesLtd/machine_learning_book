<PRE>THE BIG LEBOWSKI</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: ***1/2 (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>Gramercy / 1:50 / 1998 / R (violence, language, glimpses of nudity, drug use)
Cast: Jeff Bridges; John Goodman; Julianne Moore; Steve Buscemi; David 
Huddleston; Peter Stormare; Tara Reid; Philip Seymour Hoffman; Flea; John 
Turturro; Sam Elliott 
Director: Joel Coen 
Screenplay: Ethan Coen; Joel Coen </P>
<P>You know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you 
realize Steve Buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal 
character. Such is the case with "The Big Lebowski," Joel and Ethan Coen's 
first venture since their "Fargo" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece 
of Academy Award nods. There's no need to fear that the Coens suffered 
creative burnout with that accomplishment, because "Lebowski" is an effort 
that makes words like "strange" and "unusual" seem like an understatement. 
Thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of 
humor, the film is a smashing success. </P>
<P>The central oddball here is the Dude (Jeff Bridges), an unemployed cad whose 
ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot, drinking beer and going 
bowling (are you college students already rooting for him, or what?). One 
night, a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet, a 
threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous Pasadena 
millionaire (David Huddleston) who shares his birth name -- Jeff Lebowski -- 
with the Dude. Once the Dude realizes this coincidence, he visits the Big 
Lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug, and is back to his 
normal life with alley pals Walter (John Goodman), a hotheaded Vietnam vet, 
and Donny (Buscemi), a mild-mannered surfer, before too long. </P>
<P>Soon, though, Lebowski's trampy trophy wife Bunny (Tara Reid) is kidnaped and 
held for a hefty ransom, and he turns to the Dude for help. It seems Bunny's 
troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- 
she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer 
named Jackie Treehorn. The Dude, now on Lebowski's payroll, accepts the offer 
and agrees to handle the money drop; Walter tags along and insists that the 
Dude keep the cash for himself. Chaos obviously ensues, and the Dude 
eventually finds himself in hot water with cops, crooks and Lebowski's 
ultra-eccentric artist daughter Maude (Julianne Moore). </P>
<P>"The Big Lebowski" deserves to win the Coens the same amount of acclaim that 
"Fargo" did; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film, 
"Lebowski" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative. The movie boasts a 
mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over, but 
thankfully never does. The Coens (Joel directed, Ethan produced and both 
wrote) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale, and 
must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would 
expect to find in a Robert Altman flick. Whether we're watching Bridges fend 
off a marmet in his bathtub or Moore don Viking duds and dance in a Busby 
Berkeley-esque dream sequence, "The Big Lebowski" is immensely lively. There 
are those who will dislike this film, but not because it's boring. </P>
<P>The cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given. 
Bridges exudes a likeable, surprisingly sweet presence; his Dude sure isn't 
the cleanest guy around, but you'd still follow him to another movie. Goodman 
merits 1998's first Oscar consideration, as Walter's manic temper is one of 
"The Big Lebowski"'s many highlights; the same goes for Moore, whose throaty, 
delectable performance as Maude is a hilarious hoot. John Turturro may very 
well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival 
faction. Sam Elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start. 
And some will recognize Peter Stormare -- "Fargo"'s silent heavy -- as Carl 
Hungus, a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding German nihilist and 
has-been pop star. </P>
<P>Only in its final third does the movie falter, with a couple of loose plot 
threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a 
curtain call. These flaws are forgivable, though -- the Coens have crafted a 
tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product 
with anything but a big grin on your face. Without a doubt, "The Big 
Lebowski" is the best film so far this year. Sure, we're only three months in 
and the competition ("Deep Rising," "Desperate Measures," "The Wedding 
Singer," etc.) has been pretty bland, but it's still the gospel truth. Maybe 
during next awards season, "Lebowski" won't be a far cry from "Fargo." </P>
