<P>Some movies are easy to pick or pan; their brightly shining goodness 
(KEEPING THE FAITH) or dull, throbbing badness (WHERE THE MONEY IS) make 
it easy for me as a movie critic to greenlight those that I'd recommend 
my readers rush out to see, or redlight those that should be taken out 
with the day's garbage.</P>
<P>And then there are flicks like FREQUENCY; movies that have Issues that 
prevent me from giving them an unqualified greenlight, but that I still 
liked well enough to not apply the slow-your-roll brakes on for a 
yellowlight rating.  These are the movies, indeed, that make writing my 
reviews all the more hard.  Thus, I'm writing this on Sunday afternoon 
instead of last night after I came back from the theater, which allowed 
me to sleep on it.</P>
<P>But enough of this filler; on with the show.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
The pretty lights in the sky--the storm known as the aurora 
borealis--have a surprise in store John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), a 
Queens cop who still mourns the death of his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 
30 years past.  As the movie opens, John, his best friend Gordo (Noah 
Emmerich), and Gordo's son Gordy Jr. (Michael Cera) discover a chest 
belonging to Frank, a firefighter during 1969; the chest contains a 
shotgun, pictures of his father--and a ham radio ("so this is what 
people used before the net, huh?") that will link him to his father in 
ways he never believed could happen.   </P>
<P>The radio allows John to reach out to his past and change it, affecting 
the lives of not only he and his father, but also of his mother Julia 
(Elizabeth Mitchell), the young Gordo of his past (Stephen Joffe), 
John's current boss and his father's best friend, Satch DeLeon (Andre 
Braugher), and even John himself as a young boy (Daniel Henson).  But 
changes made in the past have a direct effect on the future--John's 
present time--and because of these changes, a serial killer may have 
been allowed another chance to kill again.</P>
<PRE>The Upshot:
Issues, Issues, everywhere...</PRE>
<P>Issue #1: the movie's treatment of the concept of time travel, through 
what writer Toby Emmerich (brother of Noah, who plays Gordo) calls 
"multiverses".  If you can't get past this concept and suspend your 
disbelief from the start, you will likely not be able to enjoy this 
flick.  I got past it, though I still have questions about how 
"multiverses" effect some parts of the character's lives, but not 
others.  For instance, in a scene shown in the movie's trailer **[MINOR 
SPOILER AHEAD]**, a big deal is made of the 1969 Frank putting his 
wallet in a common area for the 1999 John to find (immediately, not "in 
the future". These notes are gonna make me dizzy); similar situations 
occur throughout the movie.  That's all well and good--but if that's the 
case, why don't other everyday changes to the environment from 
"now-time" 1969, affect the now of 1999? (Yeah, definitely dizzy).  
Shouldn't simple things like the 1969 Sullivans taking items in and out 
of the refrigerator, making the bed, or even going to the bathroom 
(ugh), leave marks on the 1999 Sullivans' lives?  Hmmm... **[END MINOR 
SPOILER]**</P>
<P>Issue #2: the way director Gregory Hoblit chose to let the viewer know 
there was some Important! Stuff! about to happen.  Hoblit all too often 
hit the audience the dreaded Whifflebat Of Exposition, by way of using 
closeups on things that Joe Viewer should pay close attention to, as 
they would be of great import later on in the story.  There's an aurora 
borealis storm out tonight...wham!  And look! at that dead cop's 
name...wham! And watch...wham!...things drop...wham!...simultaneously... 
wham!...in slow motion...WHAM-0!   But even with that Whifflebat hitting 
me upside the head as often as it did, I still missed a couple of key 
sequences that left me wondering what was going on at certain points in 
the movie.  Lucky for me, my husband caught me up afterwards.</P>
<P>Issue #3: Call me picky, but if you're gonna begin with one 
premise--that using a ham radio requires you to hold down the talk 
button ("keying") to transmit--you damn well should stick with that 
premise.  I'd rather be asked to believe that you don't key the mike to 
talk, than to have characters start keying at first, but later have 
radio conversations from clear across the room with no microphone in 
sight, much less actually pushing the damn button.  Hey, I've walked out 
on movies for less; I cannot stand having my intelligence insulted, and 
this singular detail pushed my buttons.  </P>
<P>With all those Issues in the way, you might think I didn't like the 
movie, but actually, I did.  Though it wasn't great, it was good enough 
to keep me interested in what was going on; and the sense of sincerity 
that came across from the actors--especially Dennis Quaid and Jim 
Caviezel--made it convincing, even if it's a bit far-fetched.  Given the 
nature of the parts they're playing, a father and son caught up in what 
seems like an implausible situation, Quaid and Caviezel go beyond the 
gimmickry  in science fantasy, making the viewer believe that they have 
genuine affection for one another.  It borders on saccharine at times, 
but the movie rarely suffers for the melodrama inherent in such a tale.  </P>
<P>The supporting players, especially Noah Emmerich as the humorous yet 
never buffoonish Gordo, and Shawn Doyle in a particularly slimy but 
pivotal role, did well in their parts; and the younger versions of John 
and Gordo (Daniel Henson and Stephen Joffe) never came off as typical 
bratty movie kids.  The special effects and opening titles were 
well-done, and the attention paid to story-continuity, except with 
regards to one character (noted below), was noteworthy.  And if nothing 
else, FREQUENCY succeeds because it does leave the viewer pondering the 
question at its base: "What if...?"</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
Issue #4: One of the best actors you've Never Seen--Andre Braugher as 
Satch DeLeon cum "Frank Pembleton".</P>
<P>Three side issues regarding Braugher, actually: one, his was the only 
character that did not age well.  Given that there were 30 years between 
the time that he knew both Sullivan men, Satch should have looked a lot 
older than he did in his scenes with Caviezel.  Most of the other 
characters aged correctly, but except for a few bags under his eyes and 
a gray hair or two, there was hardly any noticeable change in Satch.  It 
bothered me that I had to be reminded of last week's Rules Of Engagement 
when watching this movie; on both movie sets, whoever dropped the ball 
in Makeup, needed to be whupped.</P>
<P>Two, the bizarre decision to cast Braugher as a cop here; after watching 
him work magic in "The Box" as Detective Pembleton on NBC-TV's HOMICIDE: 
LIFE ON THE STREET, it was extremely disconcerting to see his character 
placed in much the same situation--and even dressed the same way, 
complete with Pembleton-like suspenders.  It was downright rude that, in 
this similar role, he had to address someone else as "Frank"--his 
character's name on the TV show.  And it was a criminal act when one 
interrogation scene with Satch and John bore shades of Frank and the 
execrable Falsone from "Homicide".  It felt like I was having a bad LSD 
flashback--and I've never touched the stuff.</P>
<P>And three, you've "never seen" this actor play to his full potential, 
unless like me you've seen him in "Homicide", or in the Spike Lee Joint, 
GET ON THE BUS. More's the pity--because Braugher's one baaad mutha 
[shut yo' mouth], when he's allowed to cut loose.  Forget the 
conditional "Black"; he's one of the best actors out there, period.  
Here's to Braugher, being Seen.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
FREQUENCY had lots of plot holes, and some things that made my eyes 
roll; and casting Andre Braugher in a very Frank Pembleton-like role, 
was unnecessarily confusing as far as this former "Homicide" viewer is 
concerned.  But it was interesting enough to have my husband and I 
discuss it for almost an hour after we saw it, so I'm giving it a 
qualified greenlight.  Not great, and the science (fiction) is iffy, but 
the special effects were very well done, and the audience was cheering 
and crying in all the right spots.  It's certainly worth a look-see.</P>
<P>FREQUENCY (rating: greenlight): 
But stop me before I say something corny like "received transmission 
loud and clear".</P>
