<PRE>                        GOOD WILL HUNTING</PRE>
<P>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the wonderfully mature and
perceptive  script while still in college.   That in itself is quite
astonishing; one does not usually find such insight in the young.
In addition, the dialog was excellent; funny when that was its
intent, on target when a point was to be made.  All of which
contributed to a most captivating film.</P>
<P>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a genius, not only in math but in just
about any other field.    With a photographic mind, he has total
recall.  He is not a "mixer," having but a few close friends,
especially Chucky (Ben Affleck).  Fame and fortune are not his bag
so that when his professor, the brilliant mathemetician Lambeau,
(Stellan Skarsgard) poses a difficult problem on the blackboard,
Will solves it quickly but leaves no name as to who had worked out
the problem.</P>
<P>Will, an orphan with a step-father who abused him,  does not take
guff from anyone so it is not surprising that he gets in trouble
beating up a policeman.  One scene shows this genius mopping the
floors of his school, MIT.    Eventually, Lambeau realizes it is
Will who solved the math problem even he was unable to do.   He then
makes it his mission to bring Will out of his mode of living and of
his behavior and send him to several psychiatrists, none of whom are
able to handle this genius.   Finally, Will is asked to see
Lambeau's  old school-friend, psychology professor Sean McGuire
(Robin Williams).</P>
<P>The whole portion of the film devoted to McGuire is beautifully
rendered with many subplots about Sean teaching at a lowly community
college whereas Lambeau has it made at MIT.  Some very  pithy remarks
and exchanges take place between the genius and the professor.  When
Will tells Sean that he has a girlfriend (Minnie Driver) whom he
loves; that both she and he are perfect, Sean replies "Neither you
nor your girlfriend are perfect but what matters most is, are you
perfect for each other?"     When Lambeau tells McGuire that Will
has the potential to be world-famous, Robins asks, is that what you
want for him or is that what Will wants?</P>
<P>All in all, a most involving film with Robin Williams again giving
his usual very fine performance and Matt Damon fulfilling his role
admirably.   Not to be missed.</P>
<PRE>                    Directed by Gus Van Sant.</PRE>
