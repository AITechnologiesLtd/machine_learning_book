<PRE>UNDER SIEGE 2: DARK TERRITORY (1995)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>It's hard to force myself to watch Steven Seagal movies.  But, since I
enjoyed Under Siege so much, I thought I'd catch Under Siege 2 for fun.</P>
<P>As introduced in the first film, Steve Seagal's character, Casey Ryback is
a Navy cook.  But, are we to believe that's all he is?  Heck no.  Ryback is
really a highly trained Navy SEAL who is able to disable or kill men with a
chop of his hands.  He knows many ways to inflict pain to bad guys, and he
shows us many.</P>
<P>In Under Siege 2 Casey has retreated to a quiet life as a cook in a big
restaurant.  Customers come to visit the restaurant not because of the good
food but because of Seagal's shiny personality.  Like many other
professions, you can take the man out of the Navy, but you can't take the
Navy out of the man.  When needed Ryback still goes active with the Navy on
top secret tasks.  Casey's brother just died and Casey needs to get out
West to pay his respects.  Tagging along is his niece-with-an-attitude
(Katherine Heigl).  Since Casey doesn't like to fly, he and his niece take
a train out West.</P>
<P>Unknowingly to Casey a high-tech group of men want to earn some money and
use this train as their mobile headquarters.  The group of men wants to
earn their money by using a new Navy satellite to strike terror in the
heart of the US.  They are going to destroy the Pentagon with the satellite
which can cause natural-looking earthquakes.</P>
<P>The story is enough to string along the action sequences.  The action
sequences are fun but rather generic.  None of the memorable.  Also, Seagal
isn't allowed to show off much of his martial arts skills.  Some of those
fighting sequences also use some laughable techniques, including one that
sped up the film.</P>
<P>As with most all of Seagal's other films, all the characters are one
dimensional cardboard cutouts. Eric Bogosian as the crazed villain, Dane,
doesn't come close to Tommy Lee Jone's crazed villain in the first film.
And director Geoff Murphy isn't able to create as much excitement as Andrew
Davis did in the first.  Steven Seagal, well, he is Steve Seagal.  His one
scene where he has to show some emotion is quite laughable.</P>
<P>Worth mentioning is Basil Poledouris' score for the film.  This is a very
thematic score and works well with the film.</P>
<P>Under Siege 2 feels different than the first.  The first had a more serious
and believable feel to it.  This sequel has a silly feel to it and some
parts are utterly unbelievable.  This is shown with a version of the
run-faster-than-a-fireball sequence with a twist. (Lets just say the
fireball is replaced with a train).</P>
<P>Though not as good as the first, Under Siege 2:Dark Territory is inevitably
fun.  If you have two hours to spare, catch Under Siege 2:Dark Territory on
video. </P>
