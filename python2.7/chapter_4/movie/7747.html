                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1995, R, 179 minutes [2 hours, 59 minutes]
[crime/drama]
starring: Robert De Niro (Sammy "Ace" Rothstein), Joe Pesci (Nicky Santonio),
Sharon Stone (Ginger), James Woods (Lester), produced by Barbara DeFina,
written by Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pieggi (based on his novel), directed by
Martin Scorsese.</P>
<P>Las Vegas is all about greed, everyone knows that. It was founded by
gangsters in the 1930s and continued to be run by organized crime for about
40 years. "Casino" is a good crime film that pulls no punches in its
depiction of Las Vegas as seen through the mafia. We get a lot of complex
criminal operations with families, honor, etc., but underneath it all lies a
typical soap opera. Even the criminal element can't get away from melodrama.</P>
<P>Robert De Niro stars as Sammy "Ace" Rothstein, a typical 1970s "Family Man"
who turns his attention to Las Vegas. His problem is he doesn't know who to
trust or what to do. He seems to want to run a legitimate business, but he
still must respect his elders through charitable, yet illegal, donations. He
meets a woman named Ginger (Stone), who, much like him, is a master swindler
and gambler - who says opposites attract? Eventually they marry but Ginger
never seems to truly love Sammy. She is perhaps an even better con artist
than he and manages to swindle $2 million in cash and thousands of dollars in
jewelry from him because he trusts her.</P>
<P>One of the passive themes of the film is love and trust, especially when it
comes to organized crime. Which is more important, loyalty to the mob or
one's lover? However, this is only implied as such, there is not enough
detail put into the relationship between Sammy and Ginger. At first they are
in love, but then their lives fall apart because Ginger still is a loose
cannon and is swindling her husband's money. She becomes an alcoholic and a
drug addict, letting her own life be ruined even though she has everything
she needs.</P>
<P> Of course there's Joe Pesci as the stubborn and vicious crime boss Nicky San
tonio, who moves to Las Vegas and tries to take over a city that is not his.
Meanwhile Sammy is trying to run a reputable casino, but has constant clashes
with Nicky are affecting his personal and professional life.</P>
<P>It certainly is interesting to watch how the mafia ran Las Vegas and the
attitude they had, but at times it becomes too confusing and too detailed for
its own good. Then again, the details make the story very suspenseful, and
almost scary in a way.</P>
<P>"Casino" works well as a crime film and a straight drama, although it does
become somewhat melodramatic at times. Even a great director like Scorsese
probably wouldn't intentionally include standard, dramatic elements just to
tell a story.  I've got no problem with drama, it's melodrama that bothers
me.</P>
