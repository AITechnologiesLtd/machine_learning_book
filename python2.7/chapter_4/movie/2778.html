<PRE>                                  BARCELONA
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Taylor Nichols, Chris Eigeman, Tushka Bergen, Mira
Sorvino, Pep Munne.
Screenplay/Director:  Whit Stillman.</P>
<P>     I remember missing Whit Stillman's METROPOLITAN when it was in
theaters in 1990, and eagerly awaiting its video release.  I had heard
Stillman compared to Woody Allen, and I've always been a sucker for
urbane banter.  But I was disappointed with METROPOLITAN; pithy
dialogue only goes so far without any real story.  BARCELONA is a step
in the right direction, but just a step.  There is more substance
unifying Stillman's clever observations, but BARCELONA will still come
off as far too slow and talky for many viewers, a 100 minute long New
Yorker cartoon with a view.</P>
<P>     Set in "the last decade of the Cold War," BARCELONA focuses on two
Americans living in the Spanish city.  Ted (Taylor Nichols) is a sales
representative for an American motor company, wrestling with career and
romantic uncertainties; his cousin Fred (Chris Eigeman) is a cocky
naval officer sent as an advance scout and unlikely goodwill ambassador
for an upcoming fleet visit.  While Fred is visiting Ted, both men find
themselves in tricky situations.  Ted falls for Montserrat (Tushka
Bergen), a Spanish woman still living with another man; Fred finds
anti-American sentiment running high, fanned by Montserrat's journalist
boyfriend Ramon (Pep Munne).  The cousins make their way through the
city sharing their thoughts about love, sex, family and international
relations.</P>
<P>     Where METROPOLITAN suffered from too many characters too sketchily
drawn, BARCELONA wisely narrows its focus.  Taylor Nichols plays Ted as
the quintessential over-thinker, a man who rationalizes himself into
complete inaction over his job, his romances and his relationship with
Fred.  Chris Eigeman's Fred is a continuation of his delightfully
insufferable Nick from METROPOLITAN, and he launches into his role as
the ugly American abroad with tremendous enthusiasm.  Both performances
are extremely strong, but unfortunately both characters are a bit
annoying.  With significant stretches of BARCELONA consisting almost
entirely of conversations between Ted and Fred, their prep school
petulance grows tiresome, and you begin to wish for absolutely anything
to _happen_ to these guys.  When it does, it's a welcome change of
pace.</P>
<P>     If there is one thing Stillman does know how to do, it's how to
load his films with quotable lines.  Ted has a sharp little monologue
about why he has decided only to date "plain, or even rather homely"
women (a resolution he promptly breaks); Fred counters with
observations on his confusion over the correct way to shave, as well as
why American society is mis-perceived as more violent ("We're just
better shots").  There are a number of moments which prompt genuine
laughs, but Stillman doesn't seem to know how to incorporate them into
a plot.  Everything comes to a halt so that his characters can trade
bon mots, and it begins to seem as though Stillman has simply set up
his camera in front of an expatriate version of the Algonquin Round
Table.  When he does pull out some quirky, character-based physical
comedy, like Ted cutting a rug to "Pennsylvania 6-5000" while reading
the Bible, it's as though he's jolted the entire production to life
with a cattle prod.  Only eventually it settles back into wry
philosophizing.</P>
<P>     BARCELONA does manage some keen insights into European perceptions
about American society and politics, and when Stillman focuses his
attention on that theme he is frequently on target.  His most
perceptive observation connects the attitudes of Europeans towards
American tastes to the miserable quality of hamburgers abroad, and it
was one of those rare movie moments where I saw the world, if only
briefly, through different eyes.  That achievement alone warrants
praise, and a moderate recommendation.  But I sense there will be many
viewers who will grow restless waiting for Stillman's characters to get
a life.  BARCELONA is just clever enough to get by on its charm, but
Stillman really needs to stop wallowing in his own cleverness and start
telling stories.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 expatriates:  6.</PRE>
