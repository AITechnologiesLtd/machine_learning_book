<PRE>**1/2 out of ***** (Mediocre)</PRE>
<P>        SNAKE EYES, the latest thriller from director Brian DePalma,
centres around a high-profile heavyweight boxing match. Corrupt cop Nick
Santoro (Cage) has been invited by best mate Commander Kevin Dunne
(Sinise), who also happens to be in charge of security. With a hurricane
raging around the hotel where the fight is being staged, things turn nasty
when the US secretary of defence attending the fight is assassinated.
Santoro is placed in charge of investigating the shooting, and uncovers
all the usual conspiracy-type dodgy goings on in the process.
        There are many moments in the movie where the relatively good
direction can do little to hide the deficiencies in the screenplay,
notably one sequence showing birds eye views of the rooms in the hotel.
With a better script, this could easily have set up a suspenseful scene,
but here it seems to have little purpose other than to fill up a few more
seconds. 
        Even the terrifically done opening, a twenty minute continuous
steadicam shot, is lost amidst near unintelligable dialogue. Nick
Santoro's seeming inability to anything other than to go around yelling
quickly becomes irritating. One scene in particular, where he
confronts one of the boxers (Stan Shaw) over match rigging, degenerates
into nothing more than a contest to see who can shout the loudest.
        Occasionally, there are flashes of inspiration that do just about
enough to keep the viewer interested. The eyewitnesses' different
views of events leading up to the shooting, told in flashback, are more
than competently handled and work well. 
        Another fault that keeps the excellent premise from becoming the
bookend to an equally good thriller is the premature unveiling of the
villain. Although the enormous lack of potential suspects make the
revelation more than a little obvious, the suspense completely evaporates
afterwards, leaving us with inferior cat-and-mouse antics supported by an
unimmersive soundtrack. The ending is a seriously silly anticlimax,
strongly supporting theories that it was very different from what DePalma
had in mind.
        The movie, like so many thrillers, is also riddled with plot holes
obvious even to viewers of average intelligence -- spectators returning
to a normal life moments after witnessing a cold-blooded act of supposed
terrorism, nobody seeming to notice one of the witnesses' blood covered
clothing -- to name but a few. 
        Despite its shortfalls, SNAKE EYES isn't the worst film of its
type you'll ever see, and may entertain some people, though it might be
best to wait for the video.</P>
