<P>(Seen at the 22nd Portland International Film Festival, in Portland, Oregon)</P>
<P> Some films have glitz. Some have actors. And we rarely tire of seeing these
things. And then there are some films that just "are" and are not trying to
be anything symbolic or meaningful, except to "exist". This is one of those
films.</P>
<P> THREE SEASONS has a series of threads, or stories, that do resolve
themselves rather well. However, if this film is a sign, this is about the
way that Vietnam has grown since the end of the war, and how it has become a
more modern country, while also showing us what it has not left behind. I am
not convinced that the film is really trying to bring across anything of a
statement, since the film maker is obviously well defined in terms of what
his vision is, and these kinds of films, one goes to see for its vision, not
its gut wrenching story. This is here also, but in many ways, it is a sort
of poetic justice, that the Vietnamese culture may be starting to create for
itself.</P>
<P> Of the four stories, one can hardly separate what this is leading to. They
do cross each other's paths here and there in rather subtle ways, but never
to interfere with each other's path. So one could easily define this as a
"day in the life", and a photographic style that is so caring and
understanding that it helps us really fall for the beauty of the film. It
has heart and then some. One could hardly expect any more from a film.</P>
<P> One story centers around a young girl who has joined a group of women to
pick up lotus flowers and then go sell them in the streets. Unlike the older
women, she decides to sing a different song one day, and she attracts the
religious leader, who is very ill and has stayed away from the public for
some time. Even though there is no hint of it, I suppose that we could think
of him as a war casualty. The young man has lost his fingers and can not
write poetry which he used to in his younger days. His face, and no doubt
his body, are terribly disfigured. And the young girl is allowed to visit
him. She has a liking for poetry and words and takes on the job of writing
down the stuff that he recites. As he dies in the end, she takes it upon
himself to put into action one of his visions, or dreams. A really beautiful
little story that gives us at least one thing that we take for granted in
life, that we rarely work with. Make a poem out of life, and live it
through. The second story is the one that seems slightly out of place, but
must have been added to the whole, and it does not take anything away from
the film. An American comes back to Vietnam to see if he can meet up with
the woman he had lived with (or married - not clear), and had fathered a
child. His campaign is hitting dead ends until the day before he is to leave
when he meets a young girl that looks like is the one he is looking for.
Apparently it is, and he ends up in a restaurant talking to her. He had sat
in front of the restaurant the whole time in the film,  probably as some
sort of memory that this was not a restaurant way back then, and was the
location that got him what he has come to realize was a gift. The third
involves a small child who walks the streets selling small items for his
boss. One day he meets the American and his box of goodies is stolen. He
gets punished by his master, and continues his journey looking for the box.
Eventually he finds it, and along side comes another young girl, who will be
his companion. This is the story that hits us the strongest, and in of
itself may be the one that has the largest point to make about anything.</P>
<P> And the fourth story is the one that we can not get away from. A young
prostitute is making a living and has high hopes and dreams that one day she
will not have to walk the streets again. A cyclo driver decides to help her
as much as he can and drive her whenever she needs. But her dates do not
seem to be picking her up, as much as they dump her. Her hopes are dashed
and this is something that she does not wish to face. The cyclo driver gets
a chance to make some money and fortune is on his side. He buys her for the
night, and gives her a dress, that is rather old fashioned compared to the
clothes that she wears. And instead of him wanting to make love to her, he
wants to watch her sleep. He leaves her breakfast in the morning.
Unfortunately, he has made displayed the very thing she has hoped for, but
can not get from the men she picks up, and this brings out a crisis for her.
In the end, it appears that she has given in to this man, who genuinely
cares for her, above all else, something that she has not been able to
appreciate yet.</P>
<P> Of all the films in the 22nd Portland International Film Festival I have
seen, this one stands out as the premiere one. It's one of those films that
is difficult to let go and not appreciate. The direction all through out is
so clean and well done, using different styles for each story, to create a
wonderful tapestry that is rare in many films. This is a film that is not
trying to impose anything on our minds, not trying to say anything, and yet,
the one thing it teaches us is that poetic justice does exist, and perhaps
this is the one thing that Vietnam has grown to become that we have not yet
seen, or learned about.</P>
<P> With some magnificent music along the way, this is a truly stupendous film
that deserves a wider audience, were Vietnam not a sore point for too many
Americans. Here is a country that has grown out of the war, and is making
something of itself, if the film has its only point that it is making.</P>
<P> Outstanding acting, and work through out, it is without a doubt one of the
nicest films this reviewer has seen in a long time.  Few films feel this
good, and show you the "good" come out ahead. If anything, this is as
positive and hopeful as anyone can look at anything, be it a country, or the
very people that make up that country. And it takes a very special film
maker to do something like this, one that has the courage to dare see the
good side of things, and find the good people.</P>
<PRE>A must see film.</PRE>
