<P>_The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence_ (R) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>Writer-director Mike Figgis has described _The_Loss_of_Sexual_Innocence_
as his most personal film, and one would be hard-pressed to argue.  So
personal as to be self-indulgent, so self-indulgent as to make not a
single iota of sense to anyone _but_ him, this admittedly captivating but
wholly incoherent and utterly baffling experience will likely leave
everyone else dumbfounded.  That the film has no plot is of little
consequence; I actually applaud Figgis for being so boldly experimental,
studying his main character, filmmaker Nic (played as an adult by Julian
Sands), through key yet completely unrelated episodes throughout his
life.</P>
<P>But when one goes for broke, one can often crap out, and that's what
Figgis has done here in every sense that expression can be taken. 
Despite the stunning cinematography of Benoit Delhomme, his interesting
idea becomes increasingly less so as the film progresses, for few of the
vignettes make any lasting impression.  It is telling that the most
effective of the episodes has the least to do with Nic and, hence, the
entire film: a haunting sequence (eerily scored by Figgis) detailing the
chance meeting of now-adult twins (Saffron Burrows) who were separated at
birth.</P>
<P>But the individual vignettes' lack of interest is the least of Figgis's
problems--his largest is his self-important pretentiousness.  In a truly
headscratching move, he has Nic's (for lack of a better term) "story"
intercut with wordless scenes of Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) and Eve (Hanne
Klintoe) frolicking in the Garden of Eden.  (Included is a laughably
earnest scene where Adam and Eve watch each other in wonder as they both
urinate.)  The Nic episodes by themselves don't make any collective
impact nor sense, let alone when grouped with the (as billed by the
on-screen intertitle) "Scenes of Nature."  Appropriately enough, Figgis's
artistic fall is best exemplified by his description-defying depiction of
the Fall: Adam and Eve are run out of the Garden of Eden by military
police, accompanied by the requisite barking hounds; awaiting the couple
just outside the gates are swarming paparazzi, who chase them into the
night.</P>
