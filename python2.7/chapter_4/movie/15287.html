<PRE>TRAGEGY PLUS NOT ENOUGH TIME</PRE>
<P>The scene:  a Nazi concentration camp.  Michael Palin is in a SS uniform,
clipboard in hand.  He asks each of a queue of prisoners, "Zyklon B?" 
Each replies, "Yes," and Palin says reassuringly, "Good; out the door,
shower on the left, one bar of soap each."  Eventually he gets to Eric
Idle, who when asked, "Zyklon B?" replies "Ah, no, freedom"  Flustered at
the novelty, Palin asks, "What?"  Idle explains, "Uh, freedom for me. 
They said that there was nothing really wrong with being a Jew, so they
said I could go free and get on a plane to England."  Palin is confused,
but no less pleased for Idle for it;  "Oh, well, that's jolly good.  Well,
off you go, then."  Idle relents, though, "No, I'm only pulling your
leg--it's Zyklon B really."  Palin is amused (and relieved), "Oh I see,
very good, very good.  Well, out the door--"  Idle enthusiastically
finishes Palin's sentence for him, "I know--out the door, shower on the
left, one bar of soap each," and bounds out the door.  The disruption
over, Palin turns his comforting mien to the next prisoner. </P>
<P>Is the above any less funny than the Roman crucifixion version featured in
"Life of Brian"?  To me, it is (slightly).  And that "slightly" is,
ultimately, what will determine whether one can enjoy La Vita e bella as
fully as the Cannes jury apparently did.  Roberto Benigni's comic farce
set in Fascist Italy from 1939 to 1945 has been met with both unqualified
praise and righteous indignation, neither of which forms a satisfactory
response to the vexing challenge posed by Benigni's artistic choice. </P>
<P>The first half of "La Vita e bella" is a romantic comedy as Benigni's
character Guido arrives in a Tuscan town to take a position as a waiter in
his uncle's restaurant and save up money to open a bookstore. This latter
ambition is thwarted by the bureaucratic hostility of Rodolfo, the local
Fascist potentate (Amerigo Fontani); meanwhile, the bulk of Guido's energy
is devoted to the pursuit of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), who is of course
engaged to Rodolfo.  Awareness of the racist climate creeps in when Guido
impersonates a Fascist inspector at Dora's school in order to arrange a
date with her, and finds himself expected to give a lecture on the
superiority of the Aryan race.  The hilarious satire that results marks
the high-water mark of Benigni's attempt to marry his slapstick genius
with the historical reality of the Holocaust.  Subsequent foreshadowing
seems insultingly mild; our first notice of Guido's Jewishness is
occasioned by the "vandalism" visited upon his uncle:  his horse is
painted green and labeled "Achtung! Jewish horse!"  Kristallnacht this is
not.  Eventually (and very entertainingly), Guido wins out and convinces
Dora to marry him instead. </P>
<P>Flash forward five years:  Guido and Dora are married, they have a son,
Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini), and Guido owns his bookstore (Rodolfo must
have left town in shame rather than use his formidable resources to harry
Guido).  When Giosue asks why certain businesses have signs stating "No
dogs or Jews allowed", rather than giving his son a useful lesson on the
perils of being Jewish in an anti-Semitic society, Guido makes a joke
about how they will put up a sign in their store stating "No spiders or
Visigoths."  One day, Dora comes home to find that Guido, his uncle, and
Giosue have been arrested.  In order to spare his son the reality of what
is about to happen to them (!), Guido decides to pretend that everyone in
the camp is competing in a contest, the grand prize being a real,
life-size tank, and that by hiding from the guards (who "aren't really
mean; that's just they way they have to act in order to win the game"),
Giosue will help them earn points toward victory.  Dora gallantly demands
to be let on the same train with her family, which helps Giosue believe
his father's fabrication.  Rather than being a desperate struggle to avoid
death, however, the film remains a comic farce as the SS guards are
straight men to be mocked by Guido, and the other prisoners merely part of
the scenery (or worse, obstacles to Guido's fantasy, as when one
inconsiderately tells Giosue that "they make buttons and soap out of us",
providing another occasion for Guido to make fun of industrial-scale
murder). </P>
<P>My poor reaction to the second half of the film is particularly vexing, as
I have long protested against any tendency to apotheosize the Holocaust as
the single greatest evil in history, to set it beyond the realm of
comparison with other human atrocities.  To do so, to call the Holocaust
"inhuman", to claim that the hatred, cowardice, and submission of
individual conscience to group "will"  exhibited in Nazi-dominated Europe
is qualitatively different from that displayed in other atrocities before
and since, is to blind oneself to the very human qualities that made the
Holocaust possible, and therefore to invite it to happen again.  I am
therefore hard-pressed to explain why Benigni made me uncomfortable and
Monty Python did not. </P>
<P>It's not as if I'm (over-)sensitive to distasteful subject matter in
films.  I cheered the poetic justice at the cannibalistic climax of "The
Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover".  More recently, I was genuinely
sympathetic to the plights of Dylan Baker's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's
characters in "Happiness", and when Ian McKellen's Nazi war criminal in
"Apt Pupil" maneuvered the film's title character into finding out,
first-hand, just "what it was like," I cackled right along with McKellen. 
So why couldn't I let myself be charmed by Benigni's undoubted comedic
talents into accepting the film's triumphant conclusion?</P>
<P>Despite today's marketers' ham-fisted-best attempts to spin-target film
trailers and commercials, there's really no longer any excuse for
film-goers not to know what they're getting into.  While the number of
films that I have walked out of (or wish that I had) prior to film's end
can be counted on one hand, my awareness of the film's controversial plot
no doubt spared me the rude surprise that must have befallen the handful
of people who walked out of "La Vita e bella" (much fewer, it must be
said, than walked out of any of the three films mentioned above).  This
awareness, however, primed me to be on the alert for any attempt by
Benigni to dilute the Holocaust to make room for his buffoonery.  But why
should I care?  Perhaps I was afraid that Benigni's film could not avoid
appearing to say that more Jews would have survived the camps had they
memorized more Buster Keaton routines.  Another viewer offered the
interpretation that the film's concentration camp scenes are to be seen as
the perspective of the five-year-old Giosue.  This is a cogent point, as I
was fully able to enjoy the child's perspective on the London Blitz in
John Boorman's "Hope and Glory" (to be sure, Boorman never pretended that
the Luftwaffe dropped cotton candy).</P>
<P>I have come to conclude that the historical context of the last fifty
years prevents me from not insisting on deadly accuracy in every depiction
of the Holocaust.  Paradoxically, while the Holocaust is one of the most
thoroughly documented genocides in history, its authenticity has come
under the most venomous attack.  I was born 23 years after the last camp
was liberated, yet that's not long enough for me to be untouched by the
mandate, "Never Forget."  Benigni isn't exempt from this, either; he's not
some ignorant American high school student turning in a paper claiming the
Holocaust wasn't as bad as everyone says.  When Guido comically
mistranslates the German guard's instructions to the prisoners in order to
establish the "rules of the game" for Giosue, Benigni wants us to forget
that their fellow prisoners will suffer for their ignorance of camp
regulations.  When Guido and his son take over the camp's PA system to
wish a happy birthday to Dora in the women's barracks, Benigni wants us to
forget that, as a consequence, Giosue will most surely be discovered and
gassed.  When Guido is sprinting about in drag in order to reunite his
family just prior to the camp's liberation, Benigni wants us to forget
that by war's end few prisoners possessed the strength to walk, let alone
pratfall.</P>
<P>I recognize that my inability to accept a watered-down version of the
Holocaust is a cultural artifact, part of a historical context populated
by both camp survivors and virulent revisionists.  If there were any doubt
that Benigni does not also share this context, it is dispelled by the fact
that the moral that Benigni proposes we draw from "La Vita e bella", that
in the face of hardship and cruelty beyond our control we are responsible
only for the bravery of the individual spirit, is straight out of the
Existential tradition that followed the Second World War.  Where Benigni's
philosophy fails is that that same tradition requires an honest
confrontation with the horrors of the human condition, which Benigni
denies us in "La Vita e bella" (a phrase from Trotsky, written while
awaiting assassination by Stalin's thugs).</P>
<P>Perhaps in another fifty years, when all the survivors and anyone who knew
them are gone, it will no longer be distasteful to make a vaudeville out
of Auschwitz.  Part of me feels that's all it is, a matter of taste. 
There are plenty of people, from critics to film-makers to ordinary folk,
who think Benigni's comic talents and his life-affirming message transcend
the historical inaccuracies of the film, and I know enough of them well
enough to be unable to dismiss them as morally handicapped.  My
difficulties with "La Vita e bella" will certainly not prevent me from
enjoying Benigni's other work, nor will I deny that the poeticism of the
film's final scene makes a compelling case for Benigni's excellent
craftsmanship as a film-maker.  I admire Benigni, and I'm in awe of what
he thought he was attempting.  In an era which most of the film industry's
attention and money goes to abominations like "Armageddon" and
"Pleasantville", it's hard to accuse "La Vita e bella" of poor taste.  I
will therefore settle for accusing it of poor timing. </P>
