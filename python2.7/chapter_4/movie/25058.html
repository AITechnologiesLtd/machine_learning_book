<PRE>BEAU TRAVAIL
------------</PRE>
<P>In current day Marseilles, Galoup (Denis Lavant, "Lovers on the Bridge")
goes through the regimen of daily life while contemplating his recent
past as a Chief Master Sargeant of the French Foreign Legion ('From a 
certain point of view, I screwed up, and points of view are important.')</P>
<P>Cowritten (with Jean-Paul Fargeau) and directed by Claire Denis ("Chocolat"),
"Beau Travail" is based on Melville's "Billy Budd," but shifts the focus from
the innocent victim to his tormentor.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Beau Travail" is a mood piece with limitted dialogue and a relatively
langorous pace.  However, if you can accept the irrational hatred of Galoup
for one of his soldiers, Sentain (Grigoire Colin, "The Dreamlife of Angels"),
and give yourself over to this film, you may find yourself experiencing 
cinematic splendor.</P>
<P>Galoup clearly loves his Legionnaire life, as well as the attention of his 
superior, Commander Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor).  The Commander is
content to use the Djibouti equivalent of marijuana even as he still keeps his
experienced gaze upon Galoup and his praiseworthy group of displaced young men, 
He's also wise enough to warn Galoup about his overreactions to Sentain, a 
young man liked by all.  All is well as Galoup guides his men through their 
daily training, followed by the inevitable laundry and outdoor ironing, 
rewarded by weekends spent at a disco, where the men dance around their
undulating local girlfriends. </P>
<P>Then a helicopter crashes into the sea during a training exercise and 
Sentain emerges a hero, decorated by their Commander.  Galoup's jealousy
continues to build and he brings his men to camp in a desolate area,
ostensibly to perform road repairs.  Instead Galoup engineers his group's
dynamics until he has a valid complaint against Sentain.  Galoup chooses
to punish Sentain (who ironically was standing up for another soldier
Galoup was punishing too severely and inhumanely) by abandoning him in 
the desert with a compass he knows to be faulty - a death sentence in this
harsh environment.  Forestier is forced to court martial Galoup and we're
brought full circle to where the tale began.</P>
<P>Denis' film features striking imagery (cinematography by Agnes Godard,
film Editing by Nelly Quettier), juxtaposing waves in sand and in sea,
salt encrusted on land (and a found compass).  She glorifies the male 
body like a color film version of Leni Reifenstahl's "Olympiad" with 
bare-chested men crab-crawlinging under obstacles, wire-walking, thrusting
and parrying.  Her images have a gorgeous, crystal clarity which are
superbly set to the music of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd opera and
original music by Charles Henri de Pierrefeu.</P>
<P>Of her cast, only three men really matter.  Colin is mostly an object of
desire, either stoicly performing his duties or letting a open smile overtake
his features when relaxing with his peers.  Although Lavant narrates the
story, Subor almost acts as the audience's point of view, even when he's not
present.  Bleery from local drugs yet cognizant of everything, he remains
distanced from the action.  In Lavant, Denis has found the lifeforce of her
film.  This actor demands your attention with his pockmarked face and
urgent body language.  Lavant gives a compelling performance, evoking 
audience sympathy even as he acts badly.  When the film ends, we believe
we're about to witness Galoup's suicide, then Denis cuts to him alone in
the disco, where the tightly wound coil of his body literally explodes
in dance as the lyrics "This is the rhythm of the night, this is the rhythm 
of my life" pound out over the dance floor, a powerful release from all
that's been witnessed.</P>
