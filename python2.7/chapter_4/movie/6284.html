<PRE>                           THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT
                       A film review by George McAdams
                        Copyright 1996 George McAdams</PRE>

<P>        Thirty years ago, if you were told that women would become beat
policemen, serial killers, or spies, chances are you seriously doubted
the first two suggestions, but not the third, after all the exploits  of
Mata Hari had been indoctrinated into the beliefs of the American male.
While the last thirty years has seen women become an integral part of
police departments everywhere and an occasional woman serial killer has
surfaced, the female spy has only taken a supplementary role in the
cinema. 
        In The Long Kiss Goodnight ( <A HREF="http://www.longkiss.com/">http://www.longkiss.com/</A> ), Geena Davis,
under the direction of her husband Renny Harlin, has broken, not only
the screen image "sweetness" that she has been saddled with since her
television days on "Buffalo Bill," and continued with "A League of Their
Own" and "Speechless," but she has given us a credible female spy/action
figure with her characterization of "Charly Baltimore, a former CIA
agent, who everyone thought had been killed, but who was really living
the life of her undercover character, Samantha Caine.
        Of course, she's not the first female to play a spy or an action
figure, Cynthia Rothrock tried, and Anne Parilla, in La Femme Nikita,
succeeded, but while it's one thing to succeed in France, one's not
really successful until the movie's made in Hollywood--and please don't
even think about Bridget Fonda's remake of Nikita, Point of No Return,
being successful because it lacked Parilla's conviction, however
misguided.
        As Geena Davis morph's into the character of Charly Baltimore, she
takes on a toughness that comes from living on the edge with glee.  As
her past creeps upon her, and her lurid past becomes an exciting
present, a spark returns to her life that Samantha Caine, schoolteacher,
had unknowingly suppressed.  For me the image of Charly, rolling a shot
glass of booze over her cheek until it's wrapped around her lips, speaks
more of her character than the hundreds of bullets she shoots from the
guns that abound every other frame of this action packed adventure.
        The web pages for The Long Kiss Goodnight are exceptional in their
delivery of behind the screens interviews from not only Geena Davis (
<A HREF="http://www.longkiss.com/Geena/gnacontnt.html">http://www.longkiss.com/Geena/gnacontnt.html</A> ), but also Samuel L.
Jackson ( <A HREF="http://www.longkiss.com/Sam/samcontnt.html">http://www.longkiss.com/Sam/samcontnt.html</A> ).  Whole scenes of
dialogue are also available, with even storyboards of crucial ones such
as the scene where Charly is being tortured by being immersed underwater

        If you long for a credible action movie and can accept that the lead
actor is a woman, then The Long Kiss Goodnight is just the movie for
you.
