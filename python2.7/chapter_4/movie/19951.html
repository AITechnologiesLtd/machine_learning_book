<P>One exits "Teaching Mrs. Tingle" wishing horror scribe extraordinaire
Kevin Williamson had been taught a few more lessons before being set
loose on his own. Sure, the guy knows his genre well, as evidenced by
his fun screenplays for boo-machines from "I Know What You Did Last
Summer" to "The Faculty." And no doubt he learned the tricks of the
trade during his two "Scream" collaborations with suspense maestro Wes
Craven. But for some reason, tangled "Tingle" - Williamson's debut
wearing both screenwriting and directing hats - doesn't find the
wunderkind at the top of his game.</P>
<P>Maybe it's the story, which exchanges the subversive humor, staggering
body counts and spiffy plot twists synonymous with Williamson projects
past for 90 minutes of talky, tawdry psychological warfare between four
people - a trio of high school students and the meanest history teacher
to ever grade papers. As the terrible Mrs. Tingle (the latter, in case
you're wondering), great British actress Helen Mirren comes off like
Margaret Hamilton in librarian ensembles and would feel right at home
alongside the evil educators in "The Faculty." For finer Williamson,
rent that 1998 sci-fi lark and skip this messy melodrama.</P>
<P>Tingle catches straight-A senior Leigh Ann ("Dawson's Creek"'s Katie
Holmes) with a crib sheet she was only holding for her boozer
boyfriend-wannabe (Barry Watson) and decides to report them to the
principal - just days before graduation. What's a distressed missy with
valedictorian potential to do? Why, traipse across the neighborhood to
Mrs. Tingle's residence with a third pal/witness (Marisa Coughlan) and
plead her case in person, of course. And if, upon arrival, a struggle
erupts and Tingle ends up tied to her bed? Well, this kind of
problem-solving they didn't cover in fifth period.</P>
<P>Never explored: How Tingle retains her Mrs. status when no husband is in
sight and she's carrying on with the football coach (funny Jeffrey
Tambor, around to enliven the movie's midsection). Or if woodworking is
among the talents of one character, who breaks and then must reassemble
a headboard so that a later scene can occur. Or from where a strangely
sudden sex romp between Holmes and Watson comes. This kind of disturbing
behavior is expected from a hormonally-charged "Creek" gal, but he - a
regular on the WB's inspirational "7th Heaven" - should know better.</P>
<P>Mirren adds chilly class to "Teaching," then gets shortchanged when her
Tingle goes full-tilt psycho for a bone-smashing, crossbow-chucking
climax. Holmes surrenders to similar circumstances, introduced in the
movie as a rational straight-arrow and finishing on a level of dementia
equivalent to that of her adversary. By the time the final image
flickers across the screen, ask yourself two highly problematic
questions: Does a key line of dialogue negate the fact that these kids
committed a vast array of imprisonable offenses? And does the film
really suggest they deserve what they get?</P>
<P>"Teaching Mrs. Tingle" might keep you interested to see how Holmes and
posse escape from the corner they paint themselves in, but it's soon
apparent that a similar fate has befallen Williamson. However, since his
treatment for the eagerly-awaited "Scream 3" is currently finalizing
principle photography and slated for a December release, we'll cut him a
bit of slack for this dishonor-roll flick: detention instead of
expulsion.<HR></P>
