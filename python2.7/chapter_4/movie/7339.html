There is something so sardonic and humorously delightful about movie 
hitmen that the big movie screen cannot seem to get enough of them. 
These hitmen seem to invade our cinema psyche. Let's see, there was 
PRIZZI'S HONOR, PULP FICTION, GET SHORTY, and now another twisted 
spin on the "hitmen-are-hip" circuit with GROSSE POINTE BLANK, a quirky
high-caliber dark comedy that is bound to send your cynicism and
funnybone to the same repair shop. GROSSE POINTE BLANK is so effortless
in its relentless send-up of everyday drivel that this film shamelessly
makes a sympathetic point out of becoming a hitman just to spite the
ordinary contrivances of lackluster life.
Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is a suburbanite who is sick and tired 
of his life, specifically his run-of-the-mill office job. Everything
seems so bleak to him. On top of all that is incredibly dull for him, he
has to seek professional help from his shrink (a funny Alan Arkin) who
cannot stand Blank and is constantly trying to avoid him at all costs.
Then there's Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), another hitman who is constantly
after Blank because, get this, Blank won't commit to joining a hitman's
union he is trying to establish. As a result, Grocer spends his time
trying to "off" Blank for his defiance. There is even a hilarious
shoot-out scene between Blank and Grocer in close proximity involving a
kitchen counter. This is all very humorous stuff. After awhile, Blank is
convinced by his employee Marcella (Joan Cusack) to take some time off
and go back to his Detroit suburb of Gross Pointe to attend a ten year
high school reunion. The advantage to this would be the pleasure of
reuniting with an old high school sweetie named Debbie (Minnie Driver),
an
ex-girlfriend Blank has never quite gotten over emotionally.
GROSSE POINTE BLANK is so offbeat and uniquely flagrant that one cannot
help wondering why this cunning comedy seems so lofty despite its
touching and tepid appeal at times. Well, for obvious reasons, credit
needs to go to a superb cast led by John Cusack (he helped contribute to
the screenplay). Cusack is such an underrated actor (for proof, witness
THE GRIFTERS) that 
audiences tend to take his acting ability for granted. And the
supporting players, all Oscar-nominated previously, are no slouches
either in the talent pool of Aykroyd, Arkin, and Cusack's sister Joan.
Director Armitage, whose underappreciated film MIAMI BLUES was another
off-kilter study of an individual's intolerance with predictable rut,
manages to assemble a caustic comedic tone in Cusack's performance. Even
the protagonist's last name Blank has a double meaning: emptiness
looking for something to take its place 
desperately. Besides, having a hitman named Blank must present some sort
of prankish paradox. Yes, Martin's life may be "blank" in terms of
fulfillment, but one thing definitely not lacking in this dead-pan funny
film is a sizzling screenplay by writers who know how to deliver a witty
and whooping movie.
Frank rates this film: ***1/2 stars</P>
