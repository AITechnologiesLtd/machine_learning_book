<PRE>Deep Blue Sea (1999)
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Thomas Jane; Saffron Burrows; Samuel L. Jackson; Jaqueline McKenzie
& Michael Rapaport</B></P>
<P>Let me first start out by saying that Steven Speilberg made the greatest
shark film ever made with Jaws. But Renny Harlin has come in a very, very,
very close second with Deep Blue Sea. Deep Blue Sea is easily the best new
movie that I have seen this year, and is far and away the best of the crop
from the summer of '99. Sure, The Phantom Menace was spectacular, but no
movie has been this much fun in a long time. I can honestly say that do not
remember ever having jumped so much during a film. When I was not jumping in
my seat, my hands were firmly grasping the armrests steeling myself for the
next scare that I knew was going to be right around the corner. At one point
in his career, director Renny Harlin looked as if he may easily become one
of the best directors in the business. His successes included Die Hard 2 and
Cliffhanger. In recent years he has faltered, making such fare as Cutthroat
Island. Well, Renny is back, and with a vengeance.</P>
<P>Saffron Burrows stars as the head of a scientific research team that is
trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Their potential cure
involves extracting fluids from the brains of mako sharks. In order to get
as much as they can, they have genetically enlarged the size of the shark's
brains. You can probably guess where this is headed. Bigger shark brains
equal smarter sharks. And these smart sharks have a distinct attitude
problem. Burrows and her crew, along with Samuel L. Jackson (playing the man
funding their research) are all on board their research lab in the middle of
the Pacific during a severe storm. This is when they realize that the sharks
are now Einsteins with big teeth. They quickly find out that the sharks are
looking for a meal and that they are the main course on the menu.</P>
<P>Let me first start with the flaws of this movie, as minor as they are. The
writers obviously watched Jaws and it's first sequel a few times, since they
do seem to "borrow" a few things from those two movies. This minor lack of
creativity can very quickly be excused though. The writers then proceed to
apparently borrow a few other things from these films, only to end up
throwing the audience for a bit of a loop. Let's be real clear, this is not
a real deep movie (if you'll pardon the pun). It is written with scares in
mind. And on that count, it delivers beautifully. In many cases, I had a
pretty good idea what was going to happen next -- but I didn't care. I was
just having too much fun. Of course, part of the fun in these types of
movies comes at the first of the movie when you can go through the cast a
pick which ones are going to be shark food and which ones are going to
return in any potential sequels. Most times the audience can guess pretty
accurately. This movie is no exception. Although, I can almost guarantee
that nobody is going to be 100% accurate on their predictions.</P>
<P>The special effects are excellent. Every bit of what one would expect from a
summer popcorn flick like this. The underwater sequences are particularly
impressive as are the real stars of the movie -- the three mako sharks. The
sharks were done with a combination of live shots, animatronics and live
action. For the most part they are all blended fairly seamlessly together.
The sets are amazing. This lab is supposed to be an old World War II sub
base and it is very cool. I must admit that I'm always a sucker for the old
flooded-set movies with everyone running around waist deep in water. This
one is particularly well done -- mostly because you are never quite sure
what is swimming around under that water.</P>
<P>Samuel L. Jackson is always a whole lot of fun to watch, so it should come
as no surprise that he is his usual cool self here. Mark my words, English
beauty Saffron Burrows is one her way to superstardom. She has a commanding
presence on screen and rivaled Jackson's talent in the acting department.
Plus, that accent is just so darn sexy. The real surprise is LL Cool J. He
has done a pretty decent job in his past films, but he absolutely,
unequivocally steals this movie. This guy is great. On top of every other
wonderful point of this movie, his scenes were the highlights.</P>
<P>The special effects were very plentiful, but I never found myself being
overpowered by them. The other thing that surprised me was the noticeable
lack of gore in this film. Sure, you have a couple of scenes -- it wouldn't
be a killer shark movie without people being eaten -- but the restraint
shown on the old blood and guts was commendable. It seems as though
everything that Renny Harlin tried in this movie worked. That included a
cheesecake shot where Burrows strips down to her skivvies. You almost buy
that she is down to her bra and panties because it is integral to the story
line and not because Harlin wants to show off her fabulous body. Almost, but
not quite. But, if Harlin feels he has to include shots like that, I guess
we are just going to have to suffer through them. Oh, the agony.</P>
<P>I loved this movie. Everything about it was just plain fun. It was scary, it
was fast paced, but above all, it is the kind of movie that makes me
remember why I love going to the movies. Go see Deep Blue Sea -- you will
not be disappointed.</P>
