HARDCORE
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Some of my friends who went to live in USA complain about
one thing - that country is very different from the one
depicted in Hollywood movies. That is especially true for
those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between
Los Angeles and New York where they find, to their big
surprise, that the majority of people vote Republican, go to
church every Sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal
attitudes that are taken for granted in an average American
film. Such rude awakening, however, can happen in another
direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to
discover unpleasant truths about world they live in.
Something like that happens to Jake Van Dorn (George C.
Scott), successful Grand Rapids businessman who shares
strong Calvinist convictions with the rest of his community.
One day his daughter Kristen (Ilah Davis) disappears from
Calvinist Youth convention in California. Van Dorn is
worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would
run from home. However, the truth delivered by private
investigator Andy Mast (Peter Boyle) is even harder -
Kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film. Infuriated
Van Dorn is unsatisfied with the way Mast's investigation is
going, so he goes to Los Angeles to search for Kristen
himself. Unfortunately, he lacks experience and the quest,
that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld, is
fruitless. Things change when he devises cunning plan and,
while doing it, stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part
time porno actress Nicky (Season Hubley).</P>
<P>Almost two decades after its release, HARDCORE is mostly
forgotten by critics and film scholars. It is a real shame,
because very few movies in today's Hollywood would dare
tackle controversial issues that writer and director Paul
Schrader explored in his second directorial attempt. In late
1970s, it was totally different situation - films were
expected to have mature, serious themes for the mature
audience. For Schrader this film was nice opportunity to
expand the subplot of his previous work, TAXI DRIVER - one
that deals with the great generational divide that tormented
the American society in 1970s. On one side we have an old
America that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and
strict morals that made that country great. But that America
is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought
by the social turmoil in 1960s and, instead of facing them,
prefers to live in rural, conservative cocoons. The new
America, on the other hand, fares no better - ideals of the
so-called "sexual revolution", same as all other
"revolutions" of the Swinging Sixties, degraded into
exploitation and depravity. Instead of being "liberated",
Baby Boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with
the newly discovered freedoms. Schrader very cleverly brings
the idea that those two Americas, actually, aren't so far
away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which Van Dorn,
already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic
capitalist, meets sleazy porno producer; the latter one also
turns out to be authoritarian, paternalistic and very
dedicated to this job. The difference between the two is
simply in the line of work.</P>
<P>Many contemporary critics actually accused Schrader of
promoting conservative agenda. On the surface, it may look
that way - audience is forced to sympathise with Van Dorn
and his quest. In the first scenes, he is portrayed as nice
family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience
parent's worst nightmare. The scene in the porno cinema that
reveals Kristen's fate is extremely cruel; pain and
humiliation, brought by Oscar-winning actor George C. Scott,
is of such intensity, that the audience feels sorry for him
and simply must support his agenda. Van Dorn is perhaps
flawed, and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth
at the end; but the viewers simply know that his cause is
just, and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her
loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only
want to exploit her body. On the other hand, Schrader, who
grew up in an environment very much like Van Dorn's (his own
parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18),
knows better and tries to bring another side of coin. Even
the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming
qualities - like Nicky, who actually tries to improve her
life, and sleazy detective who develops something like a
conscience at the end. Unfortunately, Schrader fails to
erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning, and
his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of America seems
lost in somewhat clich‚d finale.</P>
<P>The script is slightly flawed, and Schrader as director
doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too
influenced by techniques that Scorsese used in TAXI DRIVER.
Apart from the scenes in Grand Rapids, those two films even
look alike. But the content might be more than interesting
for today's viewer, especially those inspired by the current
70s revival. Until BOOGIE NIGHTS, no Hollywood mainstream
movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in
1970s. HARDCORE, on the other hand, might serve as precious
document, because it depicts sex film industry in the period
often regarded as the Golden Age by connoisseurs - before
the advent of video, when many of the porno filmmakers could
afford to think of themselves as artists. The view of such
age and the industry is very unflattering, though, but for
the film whose main character takes time to explain
Calvinist doctrines to the audience, that shouldn't be too
surprising. Anyway, despite some flaws, HARDCORE remains
very interesting and powerful piece of cinema.</P>
