<P>You don't need to be a Star Trek connoisseur to enjoy "Trekkies," an 
affectionate portrait of some the more "colorful" fans of the ubiquitous 
sci-fi phenomenon. The funniest documentary since "Cane Toads: An 
Unnatural History," "Trekkies" draws more belly laughs than any film in 
recent memory, including "There's Something About Mary." </P>
<P>Working on a shoestring budget with film stock of varying qualities, 
director Roger Nygard copes by editing "Trekkies" in the herky-jerky 
style popularized by MTV. In fact, an apt subtitle for the film would be 
"The Unreal World." Denise Crosby, Tasha Yar from "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," serves as tour guide into the realm of Trek fandom, setting 
the benign, nonjudgmental tone that makes the feature work so well. While 
I enjoyed Michael Moore's "Roger and Me" and "The Big One," how 
refreshing it is to see a humorous documentary that doesn't batter its 
subjects with snide commentary. "Trekkies" simply lets the fans speak for 
themselves, with hilarious results.   </P>
<P>Working off a "schematic" scrawled on a piece of notebook paper, one 
fellow shows off a glittery ball with assorted attachments. "It's a 
Romulan cloaking device," he explains without a hint of irony, "but I 
think I can modify it to work on a Federation ship." You know, I bet he 
can. Watch a befuddled Radio Shack clerk, eyeing the camera warily while 
the Trekkie shops for parts. Try, just try, to keep a straight face as 
the Uberfan tools down the street in his customized Captain Pike life-
support motorized space-chair, with only his head sticking out of the 
bizarre contraption. As if the spectacle isn't freaky enough, he sports a 
brown corduroy winter hat with earflaps because, hey, it's chilly out 
there.</P>
<P>We also meet Barbara Adams, an employee of the Sir Speedy print shop who 
gained national prominence when, as a Whitewater trial juror, she 
insisted on wearing her Federation uniform to court. "Every day I would 
walk past the reporters with a Vulcan-like stoicism," she says with pride,
 before launching into a sermon on the ideals espoused by "Star Trek."</P>
<P>The original "Star Trek" debuted in the '60s, when the Vietnam war and 
sweeping social changes were turning the country upside down. The show 
presented a vision of a future where mankind not only survived, but 
thrived, with adventurers of varying races and nationalities united as 
they explored the far reaches of the heavens. Despite the mini-skirted 
sexism and imperialistic undertones of the show (as well as a notable 
lack of gays that continues to this day), the optimism of the series 
resonated with a determined group of disenfranchised viewers. More than 
30 years, three TV series, nine films and countless books later, "Star 
Trek" lives on.</P>
<P>There's a sweet naiveté beneath the ridiculous costumes and garish make-
up of these "Star Trek" fans that makes their eccentricities, if not 
necessarily endearing, at least understandable. Faced with a tumultuous, 
uncertain world, they've elected to move to a nicer one. I laughed at 
Gabriel, a 14-year old computer whiz who fusses over the detailing of his 
Federation outfits while over-enunciating multi-syllable words, but I 
also remembered my own painful adolescence enough to like him.  </P>
<P>Some of the folks are considerably weirder. There's the transvestite 
Trekkie who dresses as the nameless wife of some obscure peripheral 
character, the guy considering having plastic surgery done to give his 
ears Vulcan-shaped points, and the "Spiner-Femme" who displays an album 
stuffed with photos of Brent Spiner (Data from "The Next Generation"), 
before aiming her telescope into the distance and wistfully noting that 
she can almost see the roof of the actor's home. Incidentally, I'm barely 
scraping the surface here. Wait until you hear about the "Q" virus!</P>
<P>"Trekkies" gets a bit stuffy towards the end, devoting too much footage 
to testimonials about the spirit of "Star Trek" before recovering with a 
last dash of humor, but that's a minor quibble. The film is an absolute 
hoot, an extremely funny cavalcade of outrageous fans who, outlandish 
costumes aside, are just people like the rest of us. At one time or 
another, we all get passionate and obsessive about something. We may not 
dress like Klingons or wave around phasers, but when you come right down 
to it, we're all pretty damn silly. Trekkies just wear their goofiness 
with pride.</P>

<P>A Discussion with Denise Crosby and Roger Nygard of "Trekkies"</P>
<PRE>by Ed Johnson-Ott, NUVO Newsweekly</PRE>
<P>Whether you're filming the founder of the Interstellar Language School, a 
man who legally changed his name to James T. Kirk, or a group of Klingons 
dining at a fast food joint, the trick is to avoid making color 
commentary. That's the philosophy behind "Trekkies," a hilarious 
documentary about Star Trek fandom. "We knew the audience would get it," 
explained Denise Crosby, co-executive producer of the film. "Just let 
them reveal themselves and tell their tales and you'll be touched, you'll 
be moved, you'll laugh, you'll go 'Oh my God, I thought I had some odd 
pastimes!'"</P>
<P>Crosby and "Trekkies" director Roger Nygard talked "Trek" during an 
interview at a downtown Indianapolis hotel. I congratulated Crosby, who 
just finished a year-long break after appearing in "Deep Impact" and 
having a baby, on her personal restraint in "Trekkies." Where many actors 
would have hogged the camera, Crosby served only as a pleasant, subdued 
host to the proceedings. She responded, "It was refreshing, actually, to 
be in that position. I can't stand that bombarding ego that actors have, 
so I was really happy to just kind of... " Nygard finished her sentence, 
saying "Be the Anti-Shatner?" The pair broke into gales of laughter over 
the dig at William Shatner, the notorious ham who played Captain Kirk. 
Crosby threw up her arms and gleefully shouted, "Yes, that's it, I am the 
Anti-Shatner!"</P>
<P>Denise Crosby gained fame as Tasha Yar on "Star Trek: The Next Generation,
" considered by many to be the best incarnation of the venerable 
franchise. Several months into the series' extremely shaky first season, 
she asked to be written out, frustrated with scripts that left her 
standing around far too often. "I was going to become sort of lobotomized 
if I stayed on the show much longer," she said. Ironically, the episode 
where her character was killed offered her a long, eloquent monologue, 
exactly the kind of material she had craved in the first place. "It was 
very beautifully written, and really hit some personal notes, how I 
personally felt about all those actors," she explained. As to the rather 
arbitrary method the writers used to dispose of Tasha Yar, she said, "I 
knew the concept that Gene Roddenberry was after, that my character's 
death should be so unprovoked and so sudden that it would render itself 
horrific, but in hindsight it just fell flat. I think most people felt 
that, here you are killing off a well-loved character and it should have 
been more spectacular."</P>
<P>I asked about one the first season's most notorious episodes, a story 
which reinforced negative racial stereotypes. "We were just talking about 
this," Crosby said. "I think that show will go down in history... people 
will scratch their heads and say 'How did this ever get on the air?' I 
mean, they finally have a planet that's populated with a black race and 
then they present them as savage warriors, and the men want the white 
girl!" Shaking her head and laughing, she went on. "And they speak like 
the guy from the old Cola-nut commercials! Oh my God, I was just rolling 
my eyes the whole time."</P>
<P>In subsequent seasons, when the quality of the show radically improved, 
did she ever regret leaving the series? "You know, I never looked back," 
she answered. "I'm going to be really honest, I've never seen an episode 
since I left the show and I've never seen 'Voyager' or 'Deep Space Nine.' 
It's not that I have some sort of distaste for it, there's just not a lot 
of TV that I do watch. I watch films." "And documentaries!" Nygard 
chirped with a grin.</P>
<P>Crosby remained close with several cast members after leaving the show 
and was pleasantly surprised when the producers invited her to revisit 
her role in a superb time-travel story. The episode, "Yesterday's 
Enterprise," caught her by surprise. "When I left the show, that was it," 
she explained. "I had no plans of ever returning, I was dead. And then 
they called me up and said they had this idea and would I be interested? 
I said 'Absolutely.' They sent me this great script and I thought 'This 
is so clever! This is wild!' I had a great time doing it. And I got to 
work with Whoopi Goldberg, which I had missed due to my departure." </P>
<P>The success of the episode led to Crosby's idea for another character. 
Sela would be the child of Tasha Yar, born when she traveled backwards 
through time (don't ask). In Crosby's conception, the child would be a 
human raised by the Romulans, enemies of the Federation. "I had a meeting 
with Rick Berman (head honcho for the franchise after Roddenberry's 
death) and pitched the story," she said. "He kind of went away and 
thought about it for a couple of months, then called me and said they 
wanted to go with the idea, but with the slight variation that Tasha was 
pregnant by a Romulan general, so she had a half-human, half Romulan 
daughter." Nygard laughed and added, "Yeah, with the slight variation 
that you don't get paid for the idea!" Crosby appeared as Sela, and was 
invited back as Tasha Yar for the series' grand finale. "I thought that 
was really nice, actually," she said. "That was a surprise. I just had 
wished that Wil Wheaton was there. He was missing from the last show and 
it would have been nice if everyone could have been there."</P>
<P>Crosby met Nygard in 1991, when he cast her in the comedy "High Strung." 
A veteran guest at numerous "Star Trek" conventions, she proposed the 
idea of a documentary about the fans to Nygard, amazed that one hadn't 
been made already. Producer Keith Border financed the film through his 
company and shooting began in 1996.</P>
<P>The team received no help from Paramount, parent company for the "Trek" 
franchise. Instead, they attended conventions, ambushing cast members for 
interviews and eventually shooting 35 hours worth of footage. So when did 
Paramount, distributor of "Trekkies," finally embraced the film? "When we 
had an offer from a competing studio," laughed Nygard. "We always wanted 
to give them the benefit of first choice," said Crosby, "because 'Star 
Trek' is their franchise and I have a history with the studio, but they 
weren't jumping to the mat, so we shopped it around. Our lawyers got back 
to them and said 'We're moments away from letting so and so have this 
film. Does that interest you at all?' Boom. Offer's on the table."</P>
<P>Crosby and Nygard, who is currently finishing "Six Days in Roswell," a 
documentary about UFO enthusiasts, may do a follow-up "Trek" documentary 
focusing on the vast European fan base. They're not overly concerned 
about offending Trekkies. Nygard explains that any fan going out in 
public in "Trek" regalia knows they'll be noticed and possibly laughed at,
 and is willing to accept the consequences. Referring to one fan who 
tools around in a motorized "Trek" space-chair, he said affectionately, 
"That's just his preferred mode of transportation, because it shows his 
love of 'Star Trek.'"</P>
