<PRE>               APRIL STORY (Japanese with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A pleasant slice-of-life about a woman from Hokkaido
adapting to life at a Tokyo University.  Toward the end there is a
twist and the viewer discovers the plot has been developing all along.
Rating: 6 (0 to 10),  high +1 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Shunji Iwai
   - Young woman leaving Hokkaido to go to Musashino University in
     Tokyo.
   - Slice-of-life style just shows what life is like adjusting to her
     tiny dorm room, her nervousness about meeting new classmates,  We
     also see her recreation as she goes to a movie, becomes a regular
     at a local bookstore, makes a few friends, joins a school fishing
     club.  Her life seems very lonely.
   - Story could have taken place in England, US, Canada, etc.
   - Dorms in Japan seem very depressing.  Tiny rooms, rundown walls,
     rust on metal.
   - Appears to be snowing when she leaves Hokkaido and when she
     arrives in Tokyo.  You realize in Tokyo it is actually not snow
     but apple blossoms falling.  There is a pleasant musical theme as
     the score.  It seems to be played on a single piano.
   - Film is short, about 67 minutes.  Seems like it could be an
     afternoon TV program for high school girls.</P>
