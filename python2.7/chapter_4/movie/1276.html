                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by John Locke
                        Copyright 1992 John Locke</PRE>
<P>     As it happened, I saw BUGSY the day after seeing THE ROCKETEER on
laser disc.  (The disc envelope quotes Siskel & Ebert: "Two thumbs up!"
I suspect both thumbs belong to Gene.  Either that, or Roger was extra
tickled by his performance on THE ROCKETEER's "test your 1930s IQ"
stuff.)  The two films have superficial similarities.  They're period
pieces set in the same era.  They also suffer from the same overall
defect of yawn-daring pacing broken up unredeeming thrills.  But at
least THE ROCKETEER isn't pretending to be film art.</P>
<P>     BUGSY ends with a tribute to kitsch, but the film itself is laced
with bad poetry.  Worst of all is the "death of Bugsy" scene.  Bullets
come flying through the window.  Zing!  Bugsy takes it right through the
pump.  Then we get a series of errant, albeit artistically profound
shots.  One takes out the cosmic chimney on the Flamingo Hotel model.
Another blasts a hole through the screen playing Bugsy's lousy screen
test.  A third hits Virginia Hill's photo, shattering the glass.  P.U.</P>
<P>     Tearing a page from the book of amazing coincidences, Bugsy admits
to his wife he wants a divorce as WWII has ended.  Outside the
celebrants are going crazy.  The problem with the scene, besides its
obvious cheap juxtaposition, is that it gets the order backwards.  We
find out Bugsy is ruining his wife's life, then we find out he's ruining
V-J day for her.  It mutes the effect of her sorrow.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the worst scene, though, was the one in which the mob
chieftains pay a visit while Bugsy is fixing his daughter's birthday
cake.  He bounces back and forth between his blood family and his crime
family.  The blood family quietly abandons hope and goes off to sulk.
The problem is first their overreaction to a minor disturbance.  Second,
it's the screwed up pacing of the scene which prevents you from
evaluating their reactions realistically.  He only seems to be with the
crime boys for a few minutes, but when we see the wife and kids it seems
like hours are wiling away.  The wife and kids are just puppets of the
scene's requirement to illustrate Bugsy's neglect of his family.</P>
<P>     The character of Virginia Hill is a major problem.  What is she?
She seems to be appalled by Bugsy's humiliation of Jack Dregna (stealing
a famous scene from DELIVERANCE he is made to "oink like a pig").  But
a minute later we find that she has gotten a giant sexual charge out of
it.  The film flatters her at every turn, so are we supposed to admire
her strength in tolerating Bugsy's psychopathic temper?  Or is she a
psychopath, too?  Later she is a virtual witness to Bugsy's murder of a
mob informant that she has some affection for.  She apparently keeps
quiet about it, because when she remarks on it much later, it sounds
like it has never been brought up before.  Her silence in the face of
evil is not admirable--she should have left Bugsy, at least--but the
film struggles to keep her a sympathetic character by concentrating on
her love and her loyalty to Bugsy, as if that was enough to define her.
We buy into it, of course, and so when Bugsy is tipped off that Virginia
has embezzled two million dollars, we know they are wrong.  We can see
that the purebred paranoia of these thugs is going to break up a great
romance, against all justice.  But then when we find out she did swipe
the money and, even more unsettling, that she lied quite convincingly to
Bugsy (and to us), the rug is pulled out from under her entire
character.  Was she ever more than an opportunist?  What we bought into
now looks more problematic.  Yet the film, falsely, maintains the
fiction, the touching parting scenes in which she says she embezzled the
money for the both of them.  Uh-huh.</P>
<P>     Bugsy, apparently, is to be admired as a guy that gets things done.
If that means cracking a few heads, so be it.  We know that timid people
never get anywhere.  The carrot the film dangles before us is the
Flamingo Hotel, being built in the Nevada desert by Bugsy's raw vision
and a few carpenters.  But there's no story there.  We see Bugsy's
superior judgement at work.  The impractical architect does not even
realize the pool will be shaded until Bugsy straightens him out.  But
then the pool is moved in the actual construction and another problem is
created.  You have to wonder whether Bugsy looked at the design, said
"move the pool," and never looked at the design again.  It's a fake
predicament though more dramatic than attributing the cost overruns to
the price of lumber.  When the hotel opens we get another fake
predicament.  No guests show up.  It's a bad piece of scripting.  Our
worst fears are perfectly, conveniently realized.  Like Bugsy wouldn't
have paid a crowd of extras to mug for the press.  In the end, we're
shown the contemporary Las Vegas skyline and told how much the Flamingo
is now worth.  The confirmation of Bugsy's brilliant vision.  This must
be pretty thrilling for the Sinatra worshippers.  Is anyone under the
age of sixty supposed to give a damn?</P>
