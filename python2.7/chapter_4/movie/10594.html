<P>4 Little Girls (1997) **** out of ***** - Produced and Directed by: Spike
Lee.  Running Time: 102 minutes.</P>
<P>It was 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama.  A blast ripped apart a Baptist
church, killing four young black girls.  That's the story told in "4
Little Girls", the latest film by Spike Lee.  Unlike Lee's other films, "4
Little Girls" is a documentary, told only through old news footage and the
recollections of family and friends of the victims.</P>
<P>The story told is a compelling and emotional one, and for the most part it
is well presented.  A couple of times the subject does seem to wander into
broader areas, as other events in Birmingham are discussed.  This isn't
such a horrible complaint, but the film is called "4 Little Girls" and not
"Birmingham in the '60s".  I would have rather seen more stories and
memories from the friends and family.</P>
<P>Also on hand to deliver their thoughts are Jesse Jackson, Bill Cosby, and
Green Bay Packer Reggie White.  Thankfully, these "outsider" interviews
are kept to a minimum, leaving more time for the family members to speak. 
However, there are a few seconds of interviews with former Alabama
governor George Wallace that are oddly fascinating, and almost deserve
their own film.</P>
<P>I understand that all revenue from the theatrical run of the film will be
donated to a college scholarship fund in Birmingham.  So if it's playing
in your area, you can go help out a good cause and get a fine documentary
for your troubles.  This would also be an excellent film for students and
teachers studying/teaching the civil rights movement.  [NR]</P>
