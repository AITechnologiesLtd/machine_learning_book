<P>        It was once said that ignorance is bliss.  But how can you
know bliss while ignorant?  If you know not sorrow, you know
not happiness, and vice versa.  Such is the story of Pleasantville,
a movie that's, quite frankly, inspired.  The story of a 1950's town
who's long lasting ignorance is challenged by modern day pop culture.
The result of society's ultimate reaction to change.
        In today's world, we treat life loosely, with little value.
Many consider material things to be more valuable than long term
happiness, and simply obtain them to fill such holes of loss and
greed.  Others search for a happier time and place, and secretly
hope for a return to our past.  A time many call safer, better, more
compassionate. Two such examples are modern day teens David
(Tobey Maguire) and Jen (Reese Witherspoon).  While David regularly
drowns out his chaotic reality by immersing himself in reruns of the
1950's sit-com, Pleasantville, sister Jen lusts after cute boys as an
admitted slut, climbing the social ladder through sex appeal.  But,
as Jen prepares for a date with MTV, and David for his much anticipated
Pleasantville marathon, a doorbell is rung.  A strange, unrequested
TV repairman (Don Knotts) gives them a remote to replace their
recently shattered one, after quickly quizzing David as to his
knowledge of Pleasantville.  After his departure, the two teens
quarrel in an effort to win the remote.  During the fight, a button is
pushed, and the two are transported into the very fictional, very
colorless world of Pleasantville.
        David, realizing that if they wish to get out soon they
can't tinker with the mindset of pleasant-folk, urges Jen to do the
same, and play along.  While she starts out well, she quickly loses
her balance, creating a domino effect of immense proportions, after
introducing the element of sex to the quirky little town.  Soon,
the black and white universe begins to sprout color.  Among the
newly enlightened, the perfect Pleasantville mother, Betty
(Joan Allen).  But, it's not just about sex.  Color can appear as
a result of love, compassion, anger, or hate.  It is about
individuality, the free agency to choose between what is right
and what is wrong, rather than stay confined to a "normal" and
supposedly perfect world.  We cannot become perfect by force, but
must be allowed to make mistakes, and strive to ascertain it
through correction and discipline.
        One of the film's few missteps hits when it fails to actively portray
some of the unfavorable consequences that can result from such
promiscuous behavior, as our society learned quickly after the sexual
revolution of the 1960's. Though it maintains the absurdity of racism,
another immorality.
        And while, throughout the film, Director Gary Ross may trip a bit with
his "hang on a sec while I beat you over the head with my message so
hard you won't soon forget it" strategy, such as the inclusion of signs
stating "No Coloreds", it does work, something that is a credit to his
history as a screenwriter.  He's also assembled a very capable cast,
including supporting actors Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber), William H.
Macy (Fargo), and the late J.T. Walsh (Breakdown, JFK), as well as the
two leads and Allen (Face/Off).
        The cornerstone of the movie, the gradual inclusion of color
as the town progresses, also has a wide range of integrity, and is
constructed with great subtlety and detail.  It alone is a good reason
to see the film.
        The bottom line is that Pleasantville is a fantastic vision of
our society as its progressed, and while many may still hope and
remember the "good old days", we always must focus ahead on
what will be, not what could've been.</P>
