<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Well, it finally made it.  After wreaking havoc with summer film
   release schedules by missing its original release date, after
   overshooting its target and achieving notoriety as the most expensive
   film shoot in history, after bizarre mishaps and calamities during
   production (how often is it that the catering's laced with PCP,
   anyways?), James Cameron's mega-epic TITANIC has finally sailed into
   dock.  While in the months leading up to its release many curmudgeons
   decried its four-plus minute trailer, replete with soapy
   sentimentality and gun battle, I couldn't have disagreed more -- I
   found that the promotional footage splendidly whetted my appetite for
   the film with the promise of grand old-fashioned melodrama of the
   first order amidst a faithful re-creation of one of the most
   spectacular disasters in modern history.</P>
<P>   The first impression the film leaves is a striking one: as is
   typically the case in Mr. Cameron's productions, TITANIC is visual
   eye-candy.  The film's re-creation of the mighty R.M.S. Titanic is a
   stupendous achievement, convincingly colossal and breathtakingly
   majestic.  The sheer magnitude of the ship is immediately conveyed,
   and from the vessel's grimy, hellish, coal-ladened bowels to the
   lavish sets and extravagantly grandiose interiors of the stately
   ballrooms, the net effect is never less than stunning.  From the
   dazzling period costumes right down to minisculars like the woodwork
   and even ashtrays, the film's faithfulness to authenticity is
   impressively persuasive; it's if we're truly back in 1912 on board
   the ship's maiden voyage -- fine praise indeed.  The verisimilitude
   and grandeur of the finely-observed vessel is a marvel of modern-day
   filmmaking.</P>
<P>   No doubt about it -- the ship looks terrific, and the awesome
   duplication is emphasised by repeated matching dissolve shots between
   the sunken rusted carcass of the real-life boat and that of Mr.
   Cameron's cinematic creation, tiny people scurrying about on its
   deck.  Employing this technique, the splendour of his vision is
   dazzling, contrasting the submerged, dead vessel with the shining
   lustre of his Titanic, but soon wears thin after multiple match
   dissolves.</P>
<P>   Of course, as spectacular as his ship may be, it's not enough to
   cinematically resurrect the Titanic simply in order to sink it, and
   Mr. Cameron has consequently grafted a simplistic tale of romantic
   fiction onto the film, focusing upon two young characters:
   devil-may-care drifting artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who
   won his steerage-class ticket back to America in a last-minute poker
   game (a silly but fairly effective plot device), and upper-class Rose
   DeWitt Butaker (Kate Winslet), onboard along with her domineering,
   class-conscious mother (Frances Fisher) and haughty, prosperous
   fiance Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  As one can expect, the lovely Rose
   feels stifled by her mother's officiousness and is miserable about
   her engagement with the insufferable Cal -- so much so that only
   Jack's unexpected intervention prevents her from diving overboard one
   fateful evening.  The two begin an affair.</P>
<P>   While Mr. Cameron did weave a set of fictional characters for the
   ride on the Titanic, he didn't give them much depth; there's a lot of
   one-note characterization in the film, which is surprising coming
   from him given his impressive track record of creating involving,
   thoughtful characters in genres where it's usually considered an
   afterthought.  In TITANIC, villainous Cal Hockley is a snooty
   aristocrat who's, well, a snooty aristocrat, while our dashing hero
   Jack is hopelessly lovable.  Meanwhile, the film depicts all of the
   third-class passengers as the salt of the earth, while the
   first-class people are impossibly pompous and arrogantly
   class-conscious, except for the irrepressible "unsinkable" Molly
   Brown (Kathy Bates), whom, it is pointed out, is a third-classer at
   heart and in spirit.  Aspects of the Edwardian class struggle
   inundate themselves so fully into the film that by the time
   star-cross'd lovers Jack and Rose reject a dull first-class dinner
   party for a third-class romp in steerage (complete with fiddler), the
   point has already been clearly driven home.</P>
<P>   The characters in the film are essentially tired, cliched archetypes,
   but that's not necessarily detrimental, particularly in this case;
   indeed, such uncomplex characters lend themselves most handily to
   melodrama, where the more sharply-defined the division between good
   and evil, the better.  Let's see: we have the winning, scruffy,
   poor-but-good-hearted young hero with the spirited, beautiful heroine
   at his side; the hissable, sneering rich villain (with the haughty
   accent to boot) -- perfect, right?</P>
<P>   By all rights it should be, and yet the film is lacking that little
   extra push to drive it into full-fledged, unabashed melodrama; it's
   timidly toeing the water rather than plunging right in.  There's an
   intimate scene shared by Jack and Rose on the apex of the bow railing
   where she excitedly gasps, "I'm flying!"; it should be a
   spellbinding, dizzying moment, yet it somehow lacks a sense of
   rapturously wondrous magic that symbolises their passion.  Throughout
   the film, the score by James Horner fails to lend the emotional punch
   it so sorely requires; consider the effectiveness of his score in the
   last big-budget melodrama brought to the screen, LEGENDS OF THE FALL,
   and contrast with his nautical New Age hodgepodge here.</P>
<P>   One can certainly make an arguable case that Mr. DiCaprio and Ms.
   Winslet are the two best actors of their generation -- I can't
   imagine too many filmmakers frowning at the prospect of them in a
   cast list -- and landing them both for the film was a bonafide coup.
   Still, their performances in the film are at times somewhat tentative
   and reserved amidst all of the unblushing romanticism that Mr.
   Cameron's screenplay churns up; the melodrama of the piece is best
   served during the moments where they throw all caution to the wind
   and simply embrace the brazen sentimentality pervasive in the
   dialogue; I couldn't help from mentally coaxing "More ... more ...
   play it bigger!" during scenes where a more naturalistic acting
   stance was adopted.  Obviously, their respective performances remain
   more than serviceable, but I can't help from wondering how much more
   grand the net effect would be had the characters been portrayed as
   larger-than-life.  At one point, Rose gasps "This is where we first
   met!"; there should be an overflowing of emotion, pathos, and
   poignancy at her utterance, but the actual associative sentiment is
   rather hollow.</P>
<P>   The entire 1912 saga is framed by present-day intrigue involving
   Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton, a veteran on Mr. Cameron's films) and what
   appears to be the insufferable team from TWISTER transported
   underwater (when one yahoo quipped, "Oops, somebody left the water
   running," I hoped someone would toss him overboard) in search of an
   invaluable diamond.  The pursuit of Le Coeur de la Mer is a decidedly
   hokey plot device, but at least it brings the refined grace of Gloria
   Stuart, who plays Rose at age 101, and who narrates the flashbacks
   which comprise the bulk of the film.</P>
<P>   Although the film is primarily set over eighty years ago, Mr. Cameron
   takes great pains to ensure that it's not a stodgy period piece.
   There are dubious anachronisms incorporated in the story which
   blatantly serve to cater to present-day audiences: Jack and Rose
   engaged in spitting lessons, and lady Rose issuing The Finger, as
   well as crowdpleasing moments such as throwaway references to Picasso
   and Monet, Jack strutting faux-haughtily in a new tuxedo, and the
   utterance of various seriocomic one-liners.</P>
<P>   It takes a while for the iceberg to finally down the mighty ocean
   liner, but when it does, it's a one-of-a-kind spectacle and a triumph
   of visual effects.  Breathtakingly played out in approximate
   real-time, the cataclysmic death throes of the Titanic are
   astonishingly realistic.  To his credit, Mr. Cameron ensures that the
   logistics of the vessel's demise are clearly handled via the
   presentation of a computer simulation at the beginning of the film,
   removing any uncertainty about the technical manner of the sinking,
   and, if anything, adding a layer of dread to the entire affair.</P>
<P>   While the Titanic's swan song is undoubtedly the showstopping
   centerpiece of the film, the romance of the first half isn't left
   neglected; indeed, despite the fact that the troubles of our heroes
   are dwarfed by the magnitude of the ongoing catastrophe, the film
   resolutely continues to cut back to them.  More than any of the
   previous films which have dealt with the tragedy of the ship, this
   film specifically focuses on a small core of characters, and
   questionably shares equal amounts of screentime with the craft's
   apocalyptic destruction as it does with the fictionalized below-decks
   escape plot, involving handcuffs, blazing pistols, and countless
   shots of corridors flooding with water.  I felt that the balance
   should have been somewhat swayed; the interesting goings-on outside
   involving the boarding of the lifeboats, the barricading of the
   steerage-class, and the rapidly emerging realisation of the
   situation's gravity was far more fascinating.  (Mr. Cameron also
   continues to play out the class card well into the sinking, depicting
   many of the snooty rich people as being mildly irked by the
   inconvenience of being put on alert and even sending their assistants
   for tea.  Those dumb rich people.)</P>
<P>   The most earthshattering moment in the film is when the ship cracks
   apart and plunges perpendicularly into the icy depths of the
   Atlantic.  ("This is it!" shouts one character in a tone which rather
   distractingly belies excited anticipation more than fear.)  As the
   camera cranes up, revealing passengers vainly struggling to hold onto
   something -- anything -- and others sliding down the now-vertical
   deck of the ship, plummeting into the darkness of the churning water
   below, the vision is truly nightmarish.  There are a lot of terrific
   shots during the film's latter half -- a quick glimpse of a group of
   people floundering in the water like thrashing fish is particularly
   memorable -- but there's plentiful usage of easy sympathy devices --
   women clutching crying little children and the like.  In some
   respect, Mr. Cameron's helming of the human effect of the calamity is
   literally Spielberg-esque in its calculating nature.</P>
<P>   The film reaches emotional resonance in the wake of the disaster,
   which finds the two leads hitting their stride and acting their
   hearts out in a stirring scene of remarkable tenderness and
   poignancy.  It's a heartbreaking moment, and a fantastic payoff to
   the romantic angle in the film.</P>
<P>   TITANIC hinges upon the performances of its two leads, who are
   front-and-centre throughout the flick.  Ms. Winslet, sporting an
   excellent American accent here, has had a remarkable film career to
   date; save for her first Hollywood production, she's turned in one
   award-calibre performance after another.  She's good here, although
   she sadly lacks the vivacity which have marked her previous turns.
   (One is left wondering if her alleged unhappiness during the shoot
   drained her zeal.)  Mr. DiCaprio is saddled with a difficult role in
   the film -- a flawless, dreamy caricature; the man of every girl's
   dreams, and the man that every guy would like to be: dashing,
   handsome, adventurous, spirited.  He pulls it off well, but he's at
   his best in the film's dying moments as his character struggles to
   guide Rose to safety, displaying a remarkably steady and calming
   presence that belies his youthful vigour.</P>
<P>   When the concept for the project was being developed, it was pitched
   to the studios as "Romeo & Juliet onboard the Titanic" (and, to that
   ends, how incredibly apt it was that the most recent film incarnation
   of the Montague spawn was eventually cast as the dashing hero, wasn't
   it?).  TITANIC has the latter part down pat; if the former section
   were nearly as assured, we'd really have something.</P>
