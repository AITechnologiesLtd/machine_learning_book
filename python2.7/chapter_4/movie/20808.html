<PRE>An Alex Ioshpe Review</PRE>
<P>PRODUCED AND DIRECTED BY: Stanley Kubrick, WRITTEN BY: Stanley Kubrick and
Fredrick Rafael, ACTORS: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollack, Todd
Field, RUNTIME: 159 , MPAA: Rated R for strong sexual content, nudity,
language and some drug-related material.</P>
<P>RATING: 10/10 - ALTERNATIVE RATING: A</P>
<P>After 12 years, Stanley Kubrick finally directed his last feature, dieing
right after the production was completed. He never got the chance to witness
the audience react to one of his greatest achievements.
Only "The Phantom Menace" shared the controversy and the anticipation of
Kubrick's return to the big screen. But when some Star Wars-fans can (and
probably will ) be a bit disappointed by Lucas' new fantasy,
Kubrick-supporters will recieve everything  they have been waiting and
hoping for.</P>
<P>So far the greatest achievement of the year, his latest, and final, triumph
is a Kubrick picture in every sense of the word. It is beautiful, sensual,
at times creepy, gothic and mystifying.  It leaves the viewer with a lasting
impression. Intellectual and fascinating. The unforgettable characters make
you dive into the world of "Eyes Wide Shut" from the first scene. It is more
tender, sensual and human, than in any of Kubrick's previous films.
Set during the week before Christmas in New York City, Dr. Bill Harford (Tom
Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), live in a large Central Park
West apartment with their 7-year-old daughter, Helena (Madison Eginton).
Happily married, when Bill and Alice make their way to a ritzy holiday party
given by their friend, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), they find themselves
both having to turn down members of the opposite sex that make sexual
advances toward them. The next night, Alice finds herself confessing to Bill
that in the previous summer, she briefly met a devastatingly handsome naval
officer. "..That afternoon you and I made love and talked about our future,
and our child...Just the sight of him [naval officer] stirred me deeply and
I thought if he wanted me, I could not have resisted.  I thought I was ready
to give up you,  the child, my whole future..."</P>
<P>This sudden and unexpected revelation shatters the stability in Bill's
everyday life, moving him farther and farther away from his everyday
existence into a completely different world. He leaves home to visit a
patient, but instead of coming back, he wanders the streets of New York. A
series of mysterious chance encounters leads him on an unexpected path of
discovery into a bizarre sexual underworld, where the rich and famous have
their sex games. What happens next depend on the path he chooses.</P>
<P>Kubrick doesn't hurry. At the same time, the characters discover more about
each other during these 24 hours--their dreams, feelings, and fears--than
they ever thought they would in a lifetime. And when the film ends, and a
new day is slowly emerging, you still don't know whether it was real or only
a dream. Kubrick slowly guides us through Hell, and brings us back at the
end, exacly where we started, giving us a chance for a fresh start.</P>
<P>"Eyes Wide Shut" is in many ways a perfect film. It is beautifully directed.
Every shot, every move, every camera angle and every cut has been wisely
selected with great care and professionalism. Both the cinematography and
editing as well as the beautiful art direction are award worthy. The acting
is flawless and every charecter has its place. Nicole Kidman has been
granted surprisingly little time, at the same time her charecter is the
heart of the movie. Kidman is nothing less than wonderful. Cruise really
caries the film on his shoulders, the evolution of his charecter is
incredibly essencial for the picture. This is probably his most mature and
serious part and he is incredible - greater and more powerful than ever. The
music does not bare the mark of a genius, but is incredibly effective,
giving the film a feel of terrifying horror, reminding about Hichock and
Carpenter's "Halloween".</P>
<P> The film created a lot of controversy concerning sex. First I want to point
out that Kubrick's portrayal of sex is graphical, but never pornographic.
The beautiful castle in the woods, the mediaeval costumes, masks and
frightening choir create a creepy, gothic effect. All the couples are
masked. They can not kiss or see eacthother's faces, and for most part they
do not speak. Sex is here pictured as cold and ritualistic - more disturbing
than erotic, partly because of an underlying danger that is always present.</P>
<P>"Eyes Wide Shut" is by no means an easy movie. It's a personal, emotional
and  heavy drama, created to provoke thought and debate. The film generates
many interesting ideas, and the question "what is this film about" must be
answered by every individual. I think that Kubrick's new motion picture is
about several things. It is about the terrible suspicions that creep into
our minds and drive us to the brink of madness, when we find out that the
great love of our life may not be as faithful as we had imagined. It's about
modern society and moralizm, sex and family. But mostly it's about a theme
that has been present in almost every of Kubrick's previous films:
dehumanization of society.</P>
<P>It is strange that right before his death, Kubrick directed the most human,
and sensual film in his legendary and rewarding career.</P>
