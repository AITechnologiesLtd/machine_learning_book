SUPER FEATURES:  Very funny film.</PRE>
<PRE>          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>There is only one word to describe this film. FUNNY.</P>
<P>A group of friends have lived proudly of their ability to stay single for a
long time.  Their life seems to consist of school, and a few parties here
and there to entertain themselves, and their friendship.  But they are all
reaching the age, when the partying is fun, but the being alone part is not.</P>
<P>And they all set out to score a partner for marriage.  They all succeed
except our hero, who has fallen in love with an American socialite ( if that
is the word ) that has decided to take up with an Irish man.</P>
<P>And when all is lost, our hero has settled for second best, the woman that
has liked him for a long time, but is ill suited for his tastes.
Fortunately for him, he has just enough of the free spirit in him to not
forget the one person he has come to love, even if she is impossible to
reach.</P>
<P>The film is full of situations that are extremely funny.  The rookie priest
performing his very first wedding can't help mix up, and forget the words he
is supposed to say on account of his nervousness.   Our hero's younger
brother saying the wrong things at the wrong time.  And our hilarious and
crazy man who is the oldest of the group, who is
ever ready for a party and another drink.</P>
<P>In between, each member of the group gets acquainted with someone they end
up marrying.</P>
<P>The funny way this film is done is very entertaining, and while the language
is on occasion a bit on the fowl side, the film is very enjoyable.  These
kind of comedies do not come around all the time, and they are a treat when
they do.</P>
<P>Hugh Grant is exceptional, as is Andie Macdowell, and the various members of
the group, all of which have very extreme personalities. And to see one of
them hook up a Texan cowboy, is odd, but then, this group is odd.</P>
<P>Should see.  Very funny, and hard for a reviewer not to give away. The first
six words in the film tell it all.  Fast, funny, weird, and hilarious.</P>
