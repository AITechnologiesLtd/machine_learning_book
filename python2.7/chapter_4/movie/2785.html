<PRE>                             THE SLINGSHOT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is the story of a very bright
     boy growing up in Stockholm early this century.  The
     Socialist activism of both his parents and the fact his
     mother is Jewish make him the butt of bullying from all
     directions.  Still he manages to survive and bounce
     back.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Roland is a boy growing up in Stockholm in the 1920s (or so) with
just about everything going against him.  His father is a Socialist,
his mother is a Russian Jew fighting an illegal battle for family
planning.  Roland's father is an autocrat with little empathy for the
boy.  Roland's teachers are anti-Semitic and anti-Socialist and have
little use for the boy except as a bad example and as a target for
occasional sadistic corporal punishment.  Roland's schoolmates cheat,
exploit, and play cruel tricks on young Roland.  And in spite of all
this, Roland has an irrepressible spirit.  He sometimes does fight
back, but chooses his fights where he thinks they will do the most
good.  He also has an ingenious and a creative mind.  The story always
has the feel of an autobiography of somebody who achieved something
great later in life.  In fact, it is the adaptation of a semi-
autobiographical novel by Roland Schutt, so we know he at least became
a novelist.  The book was adapted for the screen and directed by Ake
Sandgren.</P>
<P>     THE SLINGSHOT takes its title from one of many applications young
Roland finds for the condoms that his mother illegally distributes.
Without understanding the actual purpose for the devices, he is able to
see in them and improvise several unexpected uses, each only getting
him into deeper trouble.  One keeps expecting somebody to notice the
genius of the ten-year-old, much as the boy comes to be appreciated in
MY LIFE AS A DOG, but this is not a film with simple answers and
obvious scenes.  Roland's rewards will be far more abstract and not so
dependent on others.</P>
<P>     Jesper Salen stars as Roland and manages a better performance with
more depth than many better-recognized actors in this country give.
Many actors his age just read lines and go through some motions for the
camera.  Jesper's acting is intelligent and convincing.  You always
have a feeling that there really are intelligent mental processes
behind his actions.  Stallen Skarsgard plays Fritiof, the father who
thinks himself a great liberal thinker but who runs his family like a
despot.</P>
<P>     While the film leaves the character of Zipa (Basia Frydman) at the
stereotypical loving mother level, we do get to know a lot more of
Roland's father.  He is harsh and demanding of his sons.  He is
determined not to let a spinal condition, which is slowly taking away
his ability to walk, undermine his control on his family.  He is a
walking (or nearly so) contradiction trying to hold on to some of the
values of the past while trying to change the social order of his
country.  He despises the government while envying the trappings of
being the king--trappings that he gets a chance to sample for himself.</P>
<P>     Roland is not a victim of the Holocaust and he lives in a country
not generally associated with discrimination and bigotry.  But the
prejudice he faces is clearly a major part of forming his character and
his ability to remain strong and to rebound still makes for a moving
story which I give a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
