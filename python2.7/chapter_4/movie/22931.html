gore)</P>
<P>Unless you are a fiercely militant member of the BBNMM group (Bring 
Back the Ninety Minute  Movie), you can not only endure but enjoy 
this long film. Enjoy visually, that is. "E & A" 's top award for 
production design at Cannes '99,  was deserved. The sets and 'scapes 
-- as well as the photography and the mass movements -- are 
breathtaking.</P>
<P>If you are a scholar of Chinese history, this story, climaxing in 221 
BC, may thrill you for its subject. It may also get you going 
pointing out liberties taken with history, inaccuracies, inventions 
or fictionalizations--but I wouldn't worry about that. Few moviegoers 
outside China are specialists. College-age film students in 2000 AD 
have little historical memory, not to mention knowledge. This, in 
spite of the abundance of historical programs on TV. Ignorance of 
even major events of the 19th century often finds an  astounding 
alibi in "that was before my time."</P>
<P>The convoluted story centers around the efforts of Ying Zheng, the 
King of Qin.  After centuries of turmoil, Qin and six other kingdoms 
(The Seven Warring Kingdoms) were China's main subdivisions. (The 
film deals wit four of them.) Ying is obessed with unifying them 
under his rule, or in less polite terms, of conquering them. His 
methods are ruthless. He also plots with his lover Lady Zhao for 
skullduggery which would give him  "legitimate" cause for attacking 
the most powerful of the other kingdoms, the neighboring Yan. The 
trick is to make of Lady Zhao what, in today's parlance we might call 
a mole or a double agent who would arrange for a professional 
assassin in the pay of Yan to attempt murdering Ying, thus clearing 
the way for the latter's invasion of the kingdom of Yan.</P>
<P>This is the main thread of a tale so complex that it requires printed 
explanations on the screen. It includes a great many atrocities as 
Ying evolves from idealist to tyrant; a betrayal of Lady Zhao by her 
regal lover; her falling in love wit the assassin Jing Ke; the 
newfound scruples of the now-retired killer; and many other twists, 
events and characters, plus a host of warriors.</P>
<P>This is epic filmmaking that melds Hollywood spectaculars by C.B. De 
Mille, other lavish historical films ("Ben-Hur," "Spartacus," etc.), 
crowd scenes a la Sergei Eisenstein, certain Kurosawa movies, even 
some Italian epics made in the early 1900s. It is impressive. It is 
splendidly photographed. It is color coordinated (oh those Chinese 
reds! Colors that is, not Reds).</P>
<P>Much pomp and many circumstances have made "E & A" the most expensive 
Chinese film ever. It was three years in the making. Its first 
test-screening, in Japan, was of about 3 hours (180 minutes.). The 
next cut was down to 160 minutes.  A third went down to 140 minutes. 
The fourth and final one, went back up to 161 minutes. Curiously, it 
was not shot, as it should have been, in 70mm widescreen.</P>
<P>The film was partly financed by sources outside China, notably French 
ones. The actual cost has not been divulged, but calculated guesses 
range, in US Dollars,  from 10 to 30 million. Even at the top figure 
the movie is amazingly cheap by European standards, dirt-cheap by 
American standards. I would guess that its Hollywood cost would be 
close to 200 million.</P>
<P>Chinese labor and other costs are so low that I can also guess that 
given the right political and trade circumstances, there would be a 
spate of movies filmed in China by foreign interests.</P>
<P>The director is Chen Kaige who, along with Zhang Yimou is today the 
super-star of the so-called Fifth Generation of China's filmmakers. 
This is the seventh feature by Chen who skyrocketed to international 
renown with his fifth, "Farewell My Concubine," the co-winner of the 
1993 Cannes Festival along with Jane Campion's "The Piano."</P>
<P>For the beautiful and talented actress Gong Li (Lady Zhao) this is 
her third film with Chen. Her debut was in "Red Sorghum" (1987) which 
was also the directorial debut of Zhang Yimou. I don't know when 
those two became "an item," but they worked together in all the other 
six Zhang features between 1989 and 1995: "Codename Couguar," "Du 
Jou," "Raise the Red Lantern," "Qiu Ju," "To Live," "Shanghai Triad." 
Then they separated, both in real life and in films.</P>
<P>"E & A" is said (but no one seems to know the specifics) to have 
employed 300,000 extras ( I suspect set-builders are included in this 
figure) and many thousands of Red Army soldiers. Many lavish and 
detailed interiors and exteriors were constructed. Ying Zheng's 
palace was conserved as an attraction for visitors, a show place. In 
another show place, Beijing's Great Hall of the People in Tienanmen 
Square, the movie was projected in 1988 to three thousand guests, 
probably a first of its kind in China. Chen, who had not always been 
the darling of censorship, was not criticized. Ying, the King, then 
Emperor of the film, is by tradition one of China's great heroes. 
Eventually however, the Chinese media were critical of the 
unflattering presentation of Ying.</P>
<P>There is also a debate about Ying the Unifier and Mao that other 
Unifier. The two are often compared. However, some people feel (but 
director Chen Kaige evades the question) that the movie is an 
allegory for Mao's Great Leap Forward.and his catastrophic Cultural 
Revolution.</P>
<P>With its enormous stress on visuals and often melodramatic twists and 
turns, there is no real room left for the analysis of characters. The 
performances are good. They include the principals as well as some 
supporting parts such as a charming blind girl whose family the 
assassin had destroyed, and a canny, effeminate Marquis . He is the 
Queen Mother's lover, wily, role-playing and the exact opposite of 
what is called in computerese WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get).</P>
<P>The various illustrations of "power corrupts; absolute power corrupts 
absolutely" are points made vividly. And the impermanence of tyranny 
(think Hitler, Stalin ...and Mao) is a post-scriptum in the film, as 
one learns that the King became Emperor, but only for fifteen years.</P>
<P>PS.  Ying Zheng was responsible for the Great Wall of China. It is 
also his tomb, at Xian, that is guarded by that huge, famous 
collection of terra cotta soldiers.</P>
