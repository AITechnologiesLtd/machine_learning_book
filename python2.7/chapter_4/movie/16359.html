<P>Legend-in-his-own-time Stanley Kubrick has not made a movie since Full
Metal Jacket (1987). Now, Eyes Wide Shut, his 16th feature (and the most
anticipated film of recent years), is getting closer to release. The other
legend, Terrence Malick, had made only two pictures until now: Badlands
(1973), based on the 1958 killing spree of Charlie Starkweather and Caril
Ann Fugate, and the poetic Days of Heaven (1978), both of which represented
until now the sum total of his work, have attained cult status. Even  more
than Kubrick, Malick has been a mysterious, even reclusive figure.
Suddenly, in late 1998, Malick-Lazarus rose from the dead with The Thin Red
Line. Outside the circle of movie insiders who knew that this movie had
been worked on for years, TRL came as unexpectedly as a new comet.</P>
<P>The title of the autobiographical source book for TRL comes from novelist
James Jones' saying that sanity and insanity are separated by a thin red
line. It applies perfectly to wars, of any kind, and here, specifically to
the battle of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal , the largest of the
Solomon Islands (August 1942-February 1943), one of the bloodiest
confrontations of World War II.</P>
<P>The film is bloody, all right, but as a war movie, something of a maverick,
complex, introspective work that is unlike anything else in the genre. Its
central part follows the Army rifle group Charlie Company (I wonder why it
is always "Charlie" in movies?) that disembarks in Guadalcanal after the
initial American attack. They wait, fight, lose men, capture a lethal
Japanese bunker on a hilltop, mop up, leave --though the film still goes on
after their departure.</P>
<P>But there's another side to this, a sort of first in war movies, something
that may jar the audience and make it wonder what it's all about, or,
contrariwise, fill some hard-core Malick aficionados with wonder. This is
the voice-over narration by many of the soldiers. In his previous two
movies too, Malick had resorted to voice-overs, quite successfully. Here,
however, it is not the description of the acts that is related, like the
familiar "...we were all still licking our wounds from the attack when the
captain issued the order to...," but a series of introspections,
psychological/philosophical/mystical thoughts by the men. It's all in their
heads, and much of the time it is well nigh impossible to determine who is
thinking those thoughts.</P>
<P>This is made even more complex by the fact that Malick has cast three
different categories of actors : familiar ones, semi-familiar, and unknown,
many of them looking enough alike to confuse the audience.</P>
<P>Unlike all war films (both formulaic and original) there are few clear-cut
types, whether in physical appearance, characteristic behavior, ethnic
provenance : the Italian-American, the Jew, the drawling Southerner, the
tough-but-great sergeant, the intellectual, the Brooklyn boy who dreams of
a big juicy steak when --never "if"-- he'll get home, etc.)</P>
<P>Malick's "military facelessness" and de-personalization are more true to
wartime than the standard way of having individuals stand out, but the
process is carried too  systematically, too far. There are exceptions, such
as the top man, Colonel Nick Nolte, a career officer whose purpose, it
would seem, is less patriotic duty or hate of the enemy than
self-advancement. "This is my first war " he says, and intends to make the
most of it. Or Captain  Elias Koteas, who is humane and ironically a lawyer
by  profession. (By coincidence, this is the second, very recent
humanization of lawyers, after Travolta's in A Civil Case. Travolta, in an
unbilled cameo, plays a General in TRL. Clooney is billed but makes merely
a microscopic appearance).</P>
<P>At times, the para-Hamletian or Oriental guru-like soliloquies of the men
may make a number of points, but I'd have to see the film again to sort
them out. There seems, however, to be a disconnection between the soldiers
and the nature of their thoughts. One case, clearer than most, is that of
Pvt. Bell ( Ben Chaplin) who is haunted -- in arty visual flashbacks too--
by his young, adored wife. But then this is spoiled by his quoting himself
telling her " If I go first I'll wait for you on the other side of the dark
waters." Were the men at war as poetic as all that??? In fact, did they
ever cogitate in the abstract rather than think numbly of their pains and
troubles?</P>
<P>The simple answer is that there is a single thinker, Harvard graduate and
Rhodes scholar Malick who has parceled out his would-be philosophical,
poetic ramblings to a number of characters. Putting thoughts in the
soldiers' heads is no more than a literary conceit.</P>
<P>The film opens with bucolic (not literally, as their are no cattle) vistas
of a smaller island where two GIs have gone AWOL. From this romantic
paradise (a la Jean-Jacques Rousseau the writer and Douanier Rousseau the
painter), the two men are taken to the ship that's carrying Charlie Company
to Guadalcanal.</P>
<P>This section is for me the best of the film, especially the sequences
where, in the vessel's very cramped innards, we see the mass of soldiers,
near-silent, worried, puzzled, fearful, sailing toward a future that's
unknown except for the fact that things will be bad. On land, much of this
is very well shown too. But I will not get into the critical cliche of "you
feel you are there." No film viewer has ever felt in his/her seat, even
remotely, what it is like to be in combat, in a death camp, a prison's
work-gang, a landing craft, and on and on.</P>
<P>What we really feel like is that we know nothing of the way the men feel
like, what the smells, the itches, the normal pains and the pains from
wounds, the fears, the thoughts of any individual are like, and the
confusion of all, at all times.</P>
<P>The interior monologues have a visual counterpart in the stylization of
nature. As an incurable history buff, I have looked at  endless footage by
combat cameramen. The Guadalcanal I've seen often makes Malick's island
seem arty. (He shot about four fifths of it in Australia  and one-fifth in
the Solomons). He has depicted much of the land in esthetic ways in order,
I suppose, to contrast the inhumanity of humans and of the animals'
survival of the species to the beauty of nature. Nothing wrong with this,
but over-underlining it can be counter-productive and distracting.</P>
<P>People in the know, too, may wonder about the absence of mosquitoes. At
Guadalcanal there were  24,000 Japanese killed,  and 1,600 Americans, but
there were many more thousands who died of malaria and other tropical
diseases.</P>
<P>This romanticism, however, is counterbalanced by combat scenes that are
mercilessly naturalistic and impart a feeling of "real time." The
piece-de-resistance attack on the Japanese bunker is splendidly
choreographed and shot. Notable too is the fact that unlike other movies,
the enemy are not "them dirty Japs" but anonymous human beings who, when
vanquished, become pitiful in their terror. Excellent too is the score by
the ever-original Hans Zimmer. Production designer Jack Fisk (Sissy
Spacek's husband) had also designed the sets for the other two Malick films.</P>
<P>Seesawing between realism and surrealism, cold facts and nebulous thoughts
where one cannot separate wheat from chaff, the movie may appear to be
suffering from personality disorders. In fact, it does. Beginning about ten
years ago, the genesis, preparation and realization of TRL have been an
epic mess. For his casting, Malick approached a Who's Who of performers,
sent many of them the script, had many read for him. The cast kept
changing, actors engaged were dismissed, replacement actors also were
canceled, texts constantly modified, parts modified or cut. During filming,
changes seem to have occurred by the hour. After certain ( many!) scenes
and sequences were done, Malick re-did them, often with major parts getting
reduced to near-zero. The actors were driven batty. And in the editing
stages, Malick re-re-remade his film in the cutting room.</P>
<P>The red line that separates sanity from madness was, indeed, very thin in
the making of this picture. It's a wonder that the end result, with all its
chaotic peculiarities, is nonetheless, memorable. And it does have one
happy aspect: the soldiers, who worry about everything, do not worry about
getting killed by their chain-smoking cigarettes.</P>
