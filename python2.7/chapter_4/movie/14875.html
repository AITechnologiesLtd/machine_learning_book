<PRE>PRACTICAL MAGIC (Warner Bros.)
Directed by Griffin Dunne</PRE>
<P>        All Sally Owens (Sandra Bullock) wants is a normal life.
Unfortunately, her heritage keeps tripping her up.</P>
<P> Sally is a descendent of a long line of witches -- she still lives
in a tumble-down old house with her kooky aunts (Dianne Wiest and Stockard
Channing) who sell love spells to local sufferers of heartache -- and
everyone in her small New England village insists on reminding her of that.
Her shamelessly raunchy sister Gillian (Nicole Kidman) split town long ago
to avoid local scorn but Sally has stuck around, trying desperately to live
down the ridicule and struggling to break the curse that dictates every man
an Owens woman loves will meet an untimely death.</P>
<P> There's a lovely theme about coming to terms with your history at
the heart of "Practical Magic," and it's drawn straight from Alice Hoffman's
enchanting best seller. Would that screenwriter Robin Swicord had taken a
bit more from the book, a character-driven chronicle of passions both earthy
and supernatural.</P>
<P> Instead, the movie beefs up one of the story's least interesting
elements, the violent relationship between Gillian and her derelict beau
Jimmy (Gorin Visnjic). It plays like "Bewitched" meets "The Burning Bed,"
particularly in a woefully miscalculated finale that almost sabotages the
entire film. In the novel, Jimmy's ghost makes trouble by haunting Sally's
garden; the movie opts for a more vicious, less intriguing form of
retribution.</P>
<P> The most appealing aspect of "Practical Magic," unsurprisingly, is
the pairing of Bullock and Kidman, two of the most likable stars around.
Both are in terrific form here and the chemistry they generate
single-handedly powers the film.</P>
<P> Sally proves to be one of Bullock's more challenging roles,
requiring the actress to bury her sex appeal beneath layers of grief and
dread until circumstances drive her to take action rather than always
cowering on the sidelines. Generally thought of as a dramatic lightweight,
Bullock's impressive emotional range here may silence some skeptics. Kidman
is handed a far less complex role -- Swicord sees Gillian as basically a
slightly long-in-the-tooth sex kitten -- but she packs enough humor and
subtle self-disgust into it that she manages to give a bit of depth to a
stereotype.</P>
<P> Director Griffin Dunne, whose acid-tinged "Addicted To Love" was
one of those movies you either loved or hated, can't quite decide which way
he wants to play this material and the tone of "Magic" swings freely between
lighthearted fun and unscary horror. The movie is at its best when Sally and
Gillian are in the process of re-establishing their sisterly bond, making
mischief at a mothers' "phone tree" meeting or frantically casting a spell.
The scenes involving the small-minded locals are unconvincing and beg the
question of how Sally's boutique manages to stay in business when everyone
around seems to despise her.</P>
<P> "Magic" ultimately gets by on the combined strength of its leads
and the able assistance of Channing and Wiest, who bring a gleeful
eccentricity to their work. The movie is agreeable fluff, but if the
filmmakers had thrown in an extra dose of Bullock and Kidman and several
more pages of Hoffman's original they would have concocted a much more
potent brew.
