<P>     Originally distributed in 1971, WALKABOUT has become director 
Nicolas Roeg's "lost work".  The film, which had five minutes of Jenny 
Agutter's frontal nudity cut from its original U.S. release, was never 
transferred to video.  As a result, this is the first opportunity for 
the under-30 crowd to experience the film, and the first chance for 
North American movie-goers of any age to see the entire, uncensored 
version.  (Incidentally, by today's standards, the nude scenes of 
Agutter wouldn't earn anything more sensational than an "R".)</P>
<P>     WALKABOUT is the story of two children -- a teenage girl (Agutter) 
and her 7-year old brother (Roeg's real-life son, Lucien John) -- 
stranded in the Australian wilderness.  They become trapped there when 
their father drives them out in the middle of nowhere, lights the car on 
fire, then shoots himself in the head.  Lost and alone, the two must 
attempt to find their way back to civilization.  Just when their 
provisions have run out, an Aboriginal man-child (David Gumpilil) finds 
them and guides them through the bush.  He's on his "walkabout" -- a 
several months' journey across Australia where he must survive off the 
land -- but the end of his odyssey is something that neither he nor his 
two white charges could have anticipated.</P>
<P>     WALKABOUT is about the never-ending conflict between civilization 
and nature, and how the two constantly work to destroy one another.  Man 
is continually tearing down the wilderness to build concrete fortresses 
that, left unattended, are reclaimed by the land.  It's clear here, as 
it was in many '70s pictures, that civilized humanity is the enemy -- 
the scourge and rapist of nature.  By today's standards, the film's 
message may seem a little naive, but that by no means renders it 
invalid.  There are Biblical allusions as well, such as snakes in a tiny 
desert oasis, but the real serpent in this Eden is the industrialized 
society.</P>
<P>     For the most part, WALKABOUT is an involving, occasionally 
hypnotic, motion picture.  Some of the photography, including images of 
the outback and its denizens, is spectacular.  There are also several 
effective visual contrasts between man and nature, such as the sequence 
where Agutter's character, a child of civilization, is enjoying a quiet 
swim in a natural pool while a group of Aborigines, children of the 
wilderness, are curiously exploring the burnt-out shell of a car.  All 
throughout the film, the differences between man and his world are 
highlighted, and the ending, which, while tragic, seems almost 
inevitable.</P>
<P>     Not every aspect of WALKABOUT is successful, however.  Roeg 
occasionally resorts to intrusive camera tricks to get his point across, 
and, without exception, these work to the film's detriment.  The use of 
still frames, hand-held shots, and bizarre inserts interferes with the 
simple beauty of the film, temporarily distancing the viewer from what's 
transpiring.  These supposedly-artistic riffs are uniformly more 
distracting than effective.</P>
<P>     Certainly, the most fascinating aspect of WALKABOUT is the 
relationship between the white children and their black guide.  The 
Aborigine is comfortable with the land and his body.  Not so for 
Agutter's character, a wild flower wilting under the relentless sun.  
There's a subtle element of sexual tension in their relationship, but 
it's kept in the subtext.  I doubt any film made today would be as 
oblique about this.  There's also an aspect of disdain (and, 
occasionally, fear) in the way Agutter deals with the Aborigine.  This 
is offset by the attitude of John's character, who treats the guide as 
his sister's equal.  The climactic moment, and the different ways the 
three characters face it, says more about the contrast between the 
"civilized" and "uncivilized" than anything else in the film.</P>
<P>     It's difficult for me, reviewing WALKABOUT more than a quarter 
century after its initial release, to get a sense of what the movie 
meant then, when its method and approach were fresher and more unique 
than they appear now.  By 1997, we've seen innumerable films with the 
same message, and that makes parts of WALKABOUT appear outdated.  
Nevertheless, even considering that this motion picture has not aged as 
well as some other landmark '70s movies, certain aspects of the film -- 
notably its lush, evocative photography and forceful emotional component 
-- make it a worthwhile experience for a '90s audience.</P>
