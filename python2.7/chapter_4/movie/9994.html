Cunningham</PRE>
<P>   John Wilkes Booth, Sirhan Sirhan, Gavrilo Princip, James
Earl Ray, Lee Harvey Oswald--all succeeded in assassinating
their political targets.  But all were caught and punished.  In
the movie, "The Jackal," IRA terrorist Declan Mulqueen
(Richard Gere),  responsible for the death of several British
subjects, was likewise caught and imprisoned.  Only the
Jackal (Bruce Willis) has succeeded in removing his marks
from the scene and getting away with it, the only thing held
behind bars being the millions upon millions of dollars he has
accumulated from the wealthy men who have given him
assignments.  Though he could have retired to the tennis
courts and golf courses long ago, he is a professional killer
who gains great delight in doing his job.  When he is given
$35 million in advance of a killing with the promise of another
$35 mil after the deed is done, he could easily have taken the
money and run.  But the Jackal, like the animal for whom he
is named, derives as much pleasure from the hunt as from
the kill. </P>
<P>   Based loosely on Fred Zinnemann's 1973 British-French
thriller "The Day of the Jackal"--about the intricate plan to
assassinate French leader Charles De Gaulle on the Champs
Elysees--Michael Caton-Jones's film plays by the numbers. 
Annoyingly enough, it recycles the age-old flaw of so many
murder plots: when the villain gets the drop on the pursuers,
he could easily go away the winner, but takes so much time
meditating on the imminent murder he is himself deleted. 
Despite its formulaic format and absence of witty dialogue
"The Jackal" has some things going for it, notably the weapon
which the title character uses to execute his target and the
disguises he assumes to get into the United States and work
his way to the victim's zone.</P>
<P>   The story opens in Moscow where a group of Russian
militia together with agents from the American FBI raid a night
club and kill a Mafia chieftain who, in a most uncool manner
curses out the officials before his public.  Determined to get
revenge on the United States for its part in the slaying of this
gangster, his brother hires the Jackal (Bruce Willis) to take
out a prominent target in the U.S.--$35 million before, an
equal amount after the execution.  Director Michael Caton-
Jones has quite a bit of fun dressing Willis up in an
assortment of wigs and mustaches, all designed to ease his
way into the U.S. and manipulate his victims.  In some scenes
Willis is unrecognizable with thick mustache, five-day growth
of beard and long hair, in others he is his usual handsome
self though he switches from gray hair to light brown to dark
coloring.  Caton-Jones has much less fun with the good guy,
Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere), an IRA terrorist being held
in a maximum security prison, who is offered the chance for
either a pardon or a transfer to a country-club jail if he will
assist the FBI in tracking down the Jackal.  Gere goes
through the motions mechanically, holding on to his Irish
brogue throughout the movie, but otherwise coming across as
a colorless individual who never shows the passion he should
about gaining revenge on the criminal who at one time shot
his girl friend, killing her fetus.</P>
<P>   "The Jackal" from time to time draws on the 007 genre,
apparently filmed in Moscow, London, Montreal, and
Washington, highlighting the killer's intricate strategy in
sneaking into the U.S.--by flying to Montreal with a false
Canadian passport, buying an expensive boat, and sailing as
part of the Mackinaw-Chicago race.  Equally amusing is his
purchase of a super gun which can shoot several rounds per
second and discharge minor missiles as well.  At one point he
coats the back of his van with a deadly poison, which, when
touched by one of his enemies, causes the man's gruesome
and violent death.</P>
<P>   Diane Venora plays the most captivating character, a
rough-tough Moscow agent with pronounced facial scars who,
if not mercifully shot in this movie would surely have been
done in by lung cancer.  When she is not huffing and puffing
on a cigarette she is busy lighting another.  You wonder how
much the tobacco industry contributed to the making of this
movie: why else provide the mostly young audience with such
a chain-smoking role model?</P>
<P>   For all we know, weapons such as the one used by the
Jackal exist today, but they are most likely in the hands of the
governments of the great powers than in those of an
individual.  Willis gets to send out a great deal of firepower by
simply tapping a few keys on his laptop, giving new meaning
to those ads in Tuesday's New York Times for ever-more-
powerful computers. Rated R.  Running Time: 119 minutes.
