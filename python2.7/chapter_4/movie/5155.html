<PRE>                                  FLIRT
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>"The publicity release for "Flirt" sums it up: " 'Flirt' is
the same story set in three different places and told in three
different ways; an exploration of the universal themes of
commitment, betrayal, indecision, catching a plane, losing a
lover, and getting shot in the face."  That's it. That's the
movie, and that's Hal Hartley.</P>
<P>He has made an extremely funny and provocative statement
about personal commitment as a global condition, and he has made
it in bold, direct language and colors. The colors, even in the
Tokyo night, are strong and clear, and the story is presented
with stark clarity by American, German, and Japanese actors in
Los Angeles, Berlin, and Tokyo. By keeping his script spare,
Hartley shines the spotlight on his chosen themes with an economy
of words, the better for us to ponder them.</P>
<P>The script is superbly superficial, a wonderfully comic
statement that we humans usually reduce big themes to simple
terms. When we're surprised, words fail us altogether. Mired in
indecision, Hartley's characters beg others to make their
decisions for them. They look at their  dilemmas through a
magnifying lens, making each decision far bigger than it need be,
talking each one to death in the absence of ability to take
action. Maybe the problem will go away, or at least solve itself.</P>
<P>Bill (Bill Sage) is comfortable in his lack of commitment
to Emily (Parker Posey). Maybe there's something better out
there, maybe he can have it all. In the 90 minutes she gives him
to make his commitment to her as she leaves for Paris, Bill
explores his options, gets shot in the face, and ends up in the
hands of the most indecisive emergency room doctor this side of
hell. </P>
<P>Desperate for help with his decision, Bill finds it in the
men's room from a trio of toilet stall philosophers, who discuss
his situation with hilarious self-absorption. And so it goes in
Berlin, where a group of construction hard hats addresses
Dwight's dilemma with utter gravity: "To flirt is to exist in
ambiguity; we can't exist in ambiguity forever."  And so it is in
Tokyo with Miho, who is jailed for gun possession and receives
wise and comic counsel from a marvelous trio of cellmates. </P>
<P>In a world where everyone tries to make decisions of the
heart with reason, love and passion are lost in triviality.
Someone always asks, "Is there a future for us?"  Can a flirt
ever stop wanting more time or more proof?</P>
<P>The movie is sharply suggests that we take ourselves far too
seriously, that we reason the love right out of our lives. It
hands us the comforting remedy of perspective by reminding us,
three times over, that everything we have ever said, done, or
thought of doing has been done a thousand times in our own and
other languages. A flirt is a flirt is a flirt.  </P>
