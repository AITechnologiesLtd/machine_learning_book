<P>   "I'm the worst person in the world," moans Woody Allen's
character, Harry Block, in Mr. Allen's latest exploration of the
psyche, "Deconstructing Harry."  When challenged by the
view that Hitler was worse, Block thinks it over briefly and
retorts, "Well, yes, after Hitler, Goebbels and Goering--I'm the
fourth worst person in the world."  That one-liner, one of the
many laughs in this briskly paced dark comedy about a guy
who never grew up, raises the tantalizing issue: Just how
much of the movie is art, and how much is Woody's own life? 
The point is exploited by the issue of "Time Out" magazine,
which hit the newsstands one week before the opening of the
film.  While Allen does mull over some real-life events in
"Harry"--his many divorces and plethora of psychiatrists--we
want to know: is this guy who has so frequently turned
nebbishness into entertainment really so down on himself?  It
appears so, that is, if you believe another gem from the lips of
Harry Block, "Writing and entertaining people is not enough."  </P>
<P>   Backed up by a stellar cast made up largely of Friends of
Woody, "Deconstructing Harry" examines the tribulations of a
fifty-something guy (Allen is himself 62) who is as obsessed
with sex as a teenager with a library of Playboys.  He simply
cannot pass an attractive woman without imagining what
physical intimacy would be like with her.  He is so consumed
by its fires that he has writers' block--a point made doubly
clear by her very name.  Still, he has churned out some
decent manuscripts in the past and so the college he
attended decades earlier has decided to honor him.  No
matter that the university expelled him at one point for giving
the dean an enema.  Harry Block has become its golden boy
and now, despite his many conquests, he seems unable to
find someone to join him socially on that day.  Ultimately he
digs up a motley crew made up of his son Hilly (Eric Lloyd
whom he has "kidnapped" because the boy's mom Joan
(Kirstie Alley) will not permit him to go; his friend Richard (Bob
Balaban); and a hooker, Cookie (Hazelle Goodman) with
whom he had spent the previous night.  Off goes Harry Block
in his car in a theme that brings to mind  "Wild Strawberries,"
Ingmar Bergman's 1957 drama about a Stockholm professor
who reviews his life's disappointments while traveling to a
university to receive honors.</P>
<P>   As in Luigi Pirandello's "Six Characters in Search of an
Author," Woody Allen's latest movie features a continuous
interplay of real-life people with fictional folks created by Harry
Block in his novels.  It's no wonder, then, that we see the
author as a younger person in the fanciful Ken (Richard
Benjamin), who grabs another man's wife during a Sunday
barbeque and has a quick round of sex with her in the
kitchen, just meters away from the woman's husband.  (In one
of the movie's more hilarious scenes the blind grandma
suddenly enters the room while the couple are in flagrante
and misinterprets Ken's rapturous outbursts as agreements
with some of her statements.) Harry proceeds to take us
around and around the block to introduce others in his life,
others who are so thinly disguised that he is confronted by a
furious and comically seething Lucy (Judy Davis), one of the
author's flames, who goes ballistic at the author for revealing
all.</P>
<P>   "I create my own universe," says Block, and "I make
everybody suffer and turn it into literature."  And we the
audience profit mightily from the writer's own dysfunctional life
as he lays on invention after delightful fabrication to entertain
his loyal followers in their theater seats.  Lacerating others
and himself alike, he torments his sister Doris (Caroline
Aaron), whom he visits after a four-year hiatus, spoofing her
decision to become a truly practicing Jew--saving some prize
comments for her Orthodox husband Burt (Eric Bogosian). 
Block, whose deity is science, exclaims, "Between Pope and
air conditioning, I'll take air conditioning."   To his old friend
Larry (Billy Crystal), who steals Block's girl friend Fay
(Elisabeth Shue), he offers the fires of hell--which the camera
displays to us in all its incendiary splendor.</P>
<P>   "Deconstructing Harry" features some particularly strong
roles for women, with Kirstie Alley coming across with
exquisite humor as a former wife, a psychoanalyst, who
frequently interrupts a session with a client to verbally abuse
the poor Block and throw him out of the house.</P>
<P>   We learn the meaning of the title only as the story comes to
a close, as one appreciative woman who shows up for the
college honors ceremony advises Block, "Your stories are
sad, but I like to deconstruct them because they're happy
underneath." Does this mean that Woody Allen himself, who
in real life has been on the couch for decades, has a glimmer
of awareness that underneath it all he really is a happy man? 
It must might be that he finally accepts the counsel of another
dignitary that "to be alive is to be happy."</P>
<P>   "Deconstructing Harry" emphasizes Susan E. Morse's sharp
editing.  Morse flashes backwards and forwards seamlessly,
making the story line absolutely clear, and not infrequently
interrupts jump-cuts a scene to underscore the title
character's uneven emotional life.  Allen is in his typical role
as the confused, unhappy nerd, though he seems to succeed
in the sexual area--a point which unfortunately undercuts any
criticism of his immaturity.  Robin Williams performs well as
one of Block's alter egos, a guy who is literally out of focus
(Carlo Di Palma's camera makes the man authentically
blurred), with Judy Davis and Kirstie Alley standing out as
exceptionally whimsical.  </P>
<P>   One day after screening the movie I happened to listen to
Gary Null's talk show on WBAI-FM.  Null laced into those of
us who insist on being martyrs, people who refuse to believe
that life is within their control.  "We see Woody Allen movies
about dysfunctional people as though there would be
something wrong with watching a happy family at work,"
complains the show's host.  Sorry, Mr. Null, but the
sophisticated among us who love anything touched by Woody
Allen are no longer amused by stories of the Brady family. 
Humor derives to a great extent from the suffering of others. 
We laugh at entertainers who slip in banana peels, not at
those who walk calmly down the street without a care in the
world.  "Deconstructing Harry," brimming with oddball, often
hilariously damaged people, should convince Mr. Allen that
writing and entertaining us with such humanity is absolutely
enough.  Rated R.  Running Time: 98 minutes.  (C) 1997
