<PRE>                                ALIEN RESURRECTION
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ** (Maltin scale)</PRE>
<PRE>Been there.  Done that.</PRE>
<P>"Alien Resurrection" feels less like another episode in the popular Alien
series and more like a predictable, visceral walk down memory lane,
reminding us--with its almost casual approach to brainless humans being
gored by big nasty monsters--what made the first three films much more
memorable.</P>
<PRE>And that *does* include "Alien3."</PRE>
<P>Fans of the series are strongly divided between two camps: whether Ridley
Scott's original was better than James Cameron's sequel (it's a debate that
seems senseless, given how different these two films are in terms of
style--Scott's played like a classic monster movie set in deep space;
Cameron's was a testosterone-laden, hardware-heavy shoot-em-up).  On the
less successful end of the scale, David Fincher's 1992 "Alien3" was
unanimously dismissed out of hand as the bleakest and weakest chapter, but
with "Alien Resurrection" there's finally new hope for Fincher's effort.</P>
<P>This time around we get the typical rag-tag band of heavily-armed space
derelicts who happen onboard a scientific research vessel.  Here they mess
with an equally rag-tag band of covert military operatives engaged in some
not-for-prime-time experimentation with--you guessed it--those drooling
skeletal creatures with the stainless steel teeth.  Head of the group is
General Perez, played in flamboyant fashion by Dan Hedaya, whose furry
shoulders are probably the scariest thing in the film.</P>
<P>Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, even though her character died in the
third Alien picture.  Watching Weaver in a bad Alien movie is always more
interesting than watching her in a good, non-Alien movie ("The Ice Storm,"
for example) so whenever she's on camera, there's hope.  But perhaps
because her character is a clone (like everything else in the film), Ripley
is lacking a vibrancy and passion the film badly needs.  We can't blame
Weaver, since the Ripley character has been genetically mutated, but her
new spiritual relationship with the aliens just doesn't drive "Alien
Resurrection" as effectively as her tough, human compassion did in the
earlier films.</P>
<P>Call, a space pirate with very much her own agenda, displays some of the
emotions missing from Ripley, but as played by a miscast Winona Ryder,
she's too wimpy and simpy to be of any real value.</P>
<P>The aliens are as slimy and single-mindedly menacing as usual but with no
audience empathy for the crew members, the buffet can't start fast enough.</P>
<P>"Alien Resurrection" is directed by the provocative Frenchman Jean-Pierre
Jeunet ("City of Lost Children," "Delicatessen") but you'd hardly know it.
The film has a very standard look, as if the production team used leftover
sets from "Event Horizon" (another disappointing science fiction thriller
that wastes a decent cast).  200 years on, we're still looking at the same
old grungy, mechanized interiors with lots of escaping steam; the only
notable technological advance appears to be breath recognition!  Jeunet
should have given us something a little more surreal or at least
imaginative.  Writer Joss Whedon's script is definitely lost in space.</P>
<P>Although "Alien3" wasn't the most satisfying end to the trilogy, "Alien
Resurrection" reminds us that sometimes the kindest thing you can do is let
the dead rest in peace.</P>
