<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Taxman is a wonderfully played cynical, offbeat, low-key thriller with
comic undertones, also exhibiting plenty of local atmosphere and human
intensity. It is about a mysterious moneyman in the Russian community of
Brighton Beach who is skimming tax money from his gas station operations
thereby defrauding New York State of millions of dollars in tax money,
and it is also about two unlikely pursuers of this scam, who are scorned
low-level workers who get involved with Mafia-type Russian mobsters,
getting into a scenario that is way above their inept heads. They are a
self-righteous New York State tax investigator Al Benjamin (Joe
Pantoliano) and an artless rookie Puerto Rican policeman Joseph Romero
(Wade Dominguez), whose main asset to the department in Brighton Beach
is that he speaks Russian.</P>
<P>The Israeli-born Avi Nesher co-wrote the screenplay with Roger Berger,
who did the real-live tax investigation of this actual case. Nesher
directed the film with a flare for making a caper film come to life. The
film looks closely at the two obsessive and forlorn workers, who go
against the grain of both their bureaucratic department's archetypes, in
the sense that they care about people and are willing to do more than
what their job calls for. The Taxman is an attempt at remaking that
dreaded occupation's negative image, that has been maligned ever since
Biblical times, as he becomes someone who tries to do good, but is so
blinded by gaining personal glory and not compromising, that he ends up
hurting those he is helping, anyway.</P>
<P>The two would-be sleuths meet accidently at the crime scene of a Russian
Mafia rub out  of six employees of a small but growing gas station
company called M.A.R.S., that the taxman is suspicious of, as he has
been investigating them for months without his bosses approval, trying
to figure out how they are running a tax scam. Unfortunately, no one
else cares.</P>
<P>Benjamin and Joseph are poorly thought of by their bosses. They both
can't help it, they have personalities that rub people the wrong way,
even if they don't mean to be annoying and are supposedly intelligent,
they are still kept at the bottom-level of their jobs. Benjamin's boss
considers his persistence uncalled for even though he is a veteran
investigator who is dedicated, and the rookie Romero, is asked to do the
details in the department no one else wants, like guarding dead bodies
to prevent their personal belongings from being stolen at a crime scene
or he is used as the police's errand boy to get coffee. He got high
marks at the Police Academy in the academics, but did poorly on the gun
range and can't drive a car well.</P>
<P>The fun in the movie is to see these two diverse outcasts get together
and form an iron-clad Abbott and Costello-like partnership and stumble
along on a case that no one else wants to touch with a ten-foot pole.
They make headway by starting at the bottom of the chain of mobsters and
doggedly get to meet the shakers in the crime world of the exotic
Russian community, as they eventually find links with the Russian
mobsters and a major American oil company.</P>
<P>The first helpful figure they meet is the Russian emigre Andre Rubakov
(Michal Chiklis), who owns 16 gas stations and is a good boss to work
for, as he takes good care of his workers in a paternal way. He is also
a family man, who has a beautiful and spirited daughter, Nadia
(Elizabeth Berkley). Andre refuses to sell his gas stations to the
mobster operated M.A.R.S. company, that is tied in with the so-called
cabbage: the Russian Big whose silent partner is a big American oil
company. He simply works his own scam by just not paying the authorities
the taxes he owes. As a result of him not selling his stations, he is
gunned down at a Russian bathhouse, but survives. His more fatal outcome
comes when he can't stop the taxman from following him around to a
family outing in a skating rink, arousing the suspicion of the Russian
gang.</P>
<P>A reluctant prosecutor in the U.S. district court, Peyton Cody (Robert
Townsend), decides to take the case presented to him by the two sleuths,
which was turned down by every other prosecutor and the bosses in their
own departments. He ascertains that the case could make newspaper
headlines, which is good for his career, as it involves a big oil
company and he feels these two might have come up with something if they
can get Andre to reveal who the "cabbage" is.</P>
<P>The film had many different mood swings -- ranging from the joyous
Russian wedding reception for Nadia the two sleuths attended, their
frustrating conversations about the ups-and-downs of the case, and the
action-packed mob hit by the two suicidal Chechnyan hit men of the
likable gas station owner, and the chase of one of the hit men through
the off-season beachfront property of Coney Island.</P>
<P>In the end, these two did all they could to get justice, and the results
were mixed, but better than what could be expected. The taxman's reason
for putting his life and career in jeopardy, is stated in his response
to the cabbage man who tries unsuccessfully to bribe him: "The truth is,
that people like you piss me off."</P>
<P>The film had many endearing qualities: The cast was magnificent; the
novice cop was an unforgettable character; the taxman was even more
unforgettable; Elizabeth Berkley is a beautiful sight for sore eyes and
her Russian accent was as good as pate from Zabars; and, the story,
though thoroughly routine, was presented with a certain grittiness that
elevated it to the level of those el trains running above the Brighton
Beach Russian community.</P>
