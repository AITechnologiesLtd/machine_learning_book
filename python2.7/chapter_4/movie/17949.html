<PRE>BEVERLY HILLS COP III
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov</PRE>
<P>These days the lack of originality in Hollywood reflects
itself in the deluge of remakes. But, only a few years ago,
before Wes Craven publicly made fun of the practice, sequels
had been more popular among Hollywood producers. Sequels
also used to be popular among directors and movie stars
whose careers went south. The way to regain popularity and
prestige, they thought, was the use the same formulas,
characters and story lines that brought them success in the
first place. One of such celebrity was Eddie Murphy, black
comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the
first part of this decade. In order to return to the
spotlight, he chose to resurrect the franchise created by
his most popular film, BEVERLY HILLS COP, 1984 action comedy
that had already spawned the sequel in 1987. Seven years
later, for the third instalment, he used the directorial
service of John Landis, another fading star, with whom he
successfully collaborated twice - in TRADING PLACES and
COMING TO AMERICA. This time, however, third time wasn't the
charm and BEVERLY HILLS III was failure. Eddie Murphy had to
wait few more years for real comeback.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy here plays Axel Foley, fast-talking streetwise
Detroit policeman, who raids illegal chop shop. The routine
police action ends in tragedy, when the criminals kill
Foley's boss. Determined to bring the killers to justice,
Foley realises that their leader is Ellis De Wald (Timothy
Carhart). When it turns out that De Wald happens to be
security chief for Wonderland theme park in Los Angeles,
Foley goes back to Los Angeles. There, with the help of his
old friend, local policeman Rosewood (Judge Rheinhold),
Foley would clash with money counterfeit ring.</P>
<P>Ten years has passed since the original and times are
definitely different. In this decade, the contrast between
blue collar Detroit and yuppie Beverly Hills, which provided
a lot of gags in 1984 film, simply doesn't work.
Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza provides another conflict,
this time between the childish sillyness of the Good Guys
and business-like professionalism of the Bad Guys. Since
Foley belongs to the former, his character had to watch his
language, and the tone of the film in general is more
infantile. Unfortunately, this film still belongs to action
movie genre, and there is too much violence for little
children. Nice example is the humorous scene in the
beginning, which turns into standard Ramboesque bloodbath.
Unlike Donner with the LETHAL WEAPON series, Landis simply
can't balance the comedy with "regular" action, and the
result is a film that fails in both aspects. Action scenes
are sometimes interesting, but not too spectacular (at the
end, scenery of Wonderland is more fascinating than the
action itself); humour, on the other hand, falls flat. To
make even worse, some minor characters from 1984 film gets
unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure
(especially art expert turned into arms dealer, played by
Bronson Pinchot). In the end, although the film provided
some entertainment, viewers, at least critical ones, would
probably be happy to know that there aren't any plans for
BEVERLY HILLS IV.</P>
