<PRE>                                    AVALON
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  A loving portrait of a Jewish family in
     post-World-War-II Baltimore makes AVALON one of Barry
     Levinson's best films to date.  Levinson has a real talent
     for dialogue and for creating memorable characters.  This is
     a film to be enjoyed more than once.  Rating: +3.</P>
<P>     Barry Levinson has made such diverse films as THE NATURAL; GOOD
MORNING, VIETNAM; and RAIN MAN.  But he chronically returns to his native
Baltimore to tell the stories of the people he knew when he was growing up.
His first film was the excellent DINER.  TIN MEN was set in part in the same
Baltimore diner, though the story was a cut below his first film.  AVALON is
a very different Baltimore story and rivals THE NATURAL as Levinson's best
work.  AVALON follows the fortunes of an immigrant Jewish family in the
years following World War II.  Central to the story is a grandfather-
grandson relationship, very probably based on Levinson's relationship with
his own grandfather.  The portrait of the family is at once realistic and
endearing.  This is not so much a story with a single conflict that is
resolved in the end, but more a chronicle told in episodes.</P>
<P>     As the film opens, we are in the mind and memory of Sam Krichinsky as
he is remembering and relating to his grandchildren how he came to the
United States in 1914 and settled in the beautiful city of Baltimore.  He
arrived on July 4th and he is telling the story before dinner on
Thanksgiving.  As the family history progresses, it returns again and again
to what the family was doing on those two holidays.  The story is seen very
much through the eyes of young Michael Kaye, Sam's grandson.  Levinson's
Baltimore films all have excellent dialogue which is at the same time
believable and surprisingly entertaining.  Just simple family chit-chat in
Levinson's hands becomes both revealing and endearing.  Michael's father
Jules is a salesman who is mugged in front of Michael.  To keep Jules
entertained as he is recovering his cousin buys the family's first
television set.  This leads to a whole new career of selling first
televisions, then appliances at discount.  The success brings tragedy--at
least as far as Michael is concerned: the family moves to the suburbs.  Soon
conflicts arise that seem serious to the family, but which clearly seem
petty and minor to the viewer.</P>
<P>     Armin Mueller-Stahl (who played a suspected Nazi in THE MUSIC BOX)
plays the patriarchal Sam Krichinsky.  His son Jules is played by Aidan
Quinn.  And Jules's son Michael is played by Elijah Wood.  Elizabeth Perkins
and Joan Plowright help to round out the cast in this loving scrapbook of
the life of a family.  This is certainly one of the most moving and best
films this year.  I give it a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
