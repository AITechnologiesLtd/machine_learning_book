<PRE>                             OUT OF SIGHT
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An escaped bank robber heads for a
          big score while being chased by a female federal
          marshal, each of whom really wants to know the
          other better.  Hunter and quarry are romantically
          entangled, but are they going to let romanticism
          get in the way of their professional interests?
          Steven Soderbergh balances light and dark elements
          of this sometimes comic, sometimes violent
          adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel.  Rating: 6
          (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     This is the season for "good guy" bank robbers.  Earlier this year
we had THE NEWTON BOYS about the most successful bank robbers in
American history, but who remained nice guys through it all.  Perhaps
inspired by them is Jack Foley (George Clooney) who has robbed more
than 200 banks without anyone ever being hurt.  That record is almost
believable as the film opens with Foley using his charm and a clever
plot to rob one more bank.  This time his luck is against him and he is
caught and thrown into prison.  Nor do the breaks come his way when he
tries to escape from prison.  Just as he has tunneled out, gun-loving
federal marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) is there by chance.  Foley
and company have to take shotgun from her and kidnap her, throwing her
in the same trunk in which Foley will hide.  Even under the
circumstances there is chemistry between them, and even after she
escapes, each continues to think about the other.  This could be bad
for either of them since professionally they are opponents.</P>
<P>     George Clooney is sort of a bland actor who floats along on his
good looks.  I have yet to see him show anything akin to emotional
intensity in a role.  And because his characters are not stressed, we
never see what they are made of.  That gives him a nice sturdy screen
persona, but it is not going to win him any acting awards.  Clooney
glides through Jack Foley effortlessly and leaving behind little
memorable but his smile.  Jennifer Lopez's Karen Sisco is only a little
more interesting.  She is more of a prime mover in the story, but as is
much to frequently the case in 90s popular films, the main characters
more have to look good than to create memorable characters.  More
interesting roles went to Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, and
especially Dennis Farina.  Watch for two major actors who have cameo
roles.</P>
<P>     Scott Frank's screenplay is deliberately non-linear and a little
confusing, jumping without warning into or out of flashbacks.  Perhaps
this is even a good thing since the story itself is fairly
straightforward.  The solution to the puzzle may be simple, but there
is enough spin on the ball when the story is told to make the viewer
feel good when the pieces fit together.  When the film starts we have
several seemingly disconnected strands of plot with different
characters, but the strands are quickly brought together.  Some of the
photographic touches are a little obvious.  Scenes that take place
under the warm Florida sun are shot with bright colors, but scenes that
take place in Detroit are shot mostly with a blue filter to give them a
sort of run-down look.  The dialog is humorous, but a little more
down-to-earth than Quentin Tarantino might offer.  But then Elmore
Leonard has his own strange touch when it come to dialog.  There is
little actual sex in the film that the audience sees--two characters
undress in front of each other, but we see little we could not see on
the beach.  The conclusion of the film, on the other hand, is fairly
gory and we do see the blood.</P>
<P>     OUT OF SIGHT is not one of the great crime films, but it is
entertainment with a little challenge to the audience.  It does not
push the outside of the envelope, but it gets its job done.  I give it
a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
