<PRE>"The 6th Day"</PRE>
<P>What does the future hold for us? Genetic engineering could eliminate world
hunger, cure disease, and remove the threat of extinction and stock the
medical labs with cloned organs for transplant. It could also open the
Pandora's box of mankind's most elusive desire - immortality.</P>
<P>Adam Gibson (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is and old-fashioned family man with a
happy and loving little clan of wife, Natalie (Wendy Crewson), and
daughter, Clara (Taylor Anne Reid). He comes home one night brandishing a
surprise gift for Clara, only to find his place taken by an exact duplicate
of himself. His perfect life wrenched away, Adam is plunged into a sinister
world of murder, corruption and high tech skullduggery in a tale about the
dangers of cloning, "The 6th Day."</P>
<P>Deriving its title from the bible - "and God created man on the sixth day"
- this latest Arnold flick utilizes a very hip and controversial subject,
cloning, as its high-tech draw. And a rather cool one it is. "The 6th Day"
begins with true and fictional reports of the progress of cloning from the
first success, Dolly the sheep, through the failed attempts at human
cloning and the eventual banning of the process if it involves people. This
future world does accept the simpler aspects of the technology, though,
with such specialized companies like RePet, Nu Salmon and Real Grain. These
new companies can recreate your beloved, but dead, pet, or fresh food for
your table. A lucrative industry in creating spare body parts has sprung
up, too. But, because of the ban, whole body cloning is definitely a no-no.</P>
<P>Enter our hero, Adam Gibson. Adam is an adoring husband and father who
leaves the house on his birthday not suspecting that a sinister plot is
about to change his life. He and his partner, Hank (Michael Rapaport), have
a lucrative helicopter business, Double X Charters, which ferries
snowboarders up into the mountains to ski. Hank convinces Adam to take his
special day off and the younger man takes the charter of a wealthy genetics
tycoon, Michael Drucker (Tony Goldwyn). The impact of this fateful decision
is made vivid to Adam only hours later.</P>
<P>Arriving at home with a new life-size talking doll, SimPal Cindy, for his
daughter, Adam is confronted by an unbelievable site. Hearing everyone
singing "Happy Birthday," he looks in the window to see himself and his
family celebrating his birthday. Two thugs arrive on the scene to take Adam
away, telling him that there has been a "sixth day violation," that he was
erroneously cloned and that, should his family find out, they will all be
killed. Adam must face the powerful, greedy corporation, led by Drucker,
which stole his life and fight to get it back.</P>
<P>"The 6th Day" moves, despite the high-tech, sci-fi premise, along a
well-traveled road about one innocent man pitted against a corrupt, evil
system. Here, the cloning technology has advanced to the point where
immortality is within the grasp of man, but society has deemed such an
advance as too dangerous. Arnold, as the muscular everyman Adam Gibson, is
thrust into a world of duality as our hero is brought to question his own
existence, his own reality in this world. Is the Adam who is fighting so
hard for his life and family truly being persecuted or is he merely a clone
remembering a life not his? And, if he does remember another's life as his
own, isn't, then, truly his?</P>
<P>All of this is a really good premise for a movie and, if it weren't
burdened with a former action megastar who wants to return to his former
glory, there may have been a good movie here. Instead, we see Arnold in
transition. The former Mr. Universe has been through some major heart
surgery and you can see that he just can't do what he used to in his films
like "Predator" and the "Terminator" franchise. Now, Arnie has to do more
thesping and less butt kicking and he is simply not up to the task. When he
is playing the loving husband and father opposite Crewson and Reid, it made
me want to cry - but, not from emotion for the scenes! With all the
millions Arnold has made from his flicks over all these years, he couldn't
have invested in a few acting lessons, maybe.</P>
<P>Given an actor in the lead role, I think that, with everything else
associated with "The 6th Day," there could have been a good sci-fi actioner
here. As it is, the supporting cast - with Tony Goldwyn as the greedy
high-tech entrepreneur, Michael Rooker as his chief henchman, and Robert
Duval as the well meaning mad scientist - is left to hang in the breeze
with nothing to anchor on to. The F/X showing the brain drain process that
makes cloning possible reminded me of the 1980 Ken Russell film, "Altered
States," and doesn't cover any new ground.</P>
<P>At a little over two hours long I thought that "The 6th Day" could have
easily lost 30 minutes and have been a better movie. Losing Arnold would
have been another good move. I give it a C-.</P>
