<PRE>American History X
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>***1/2 (out of 4) There is nothing like AMERICAN HISTORY X in theaters
or on video. No other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the
lure, the culture, and the brotherhood of white supremacy.</P>
<P>Nice guy Ed Norton Jr. (who sang in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU) plays
Derek, a twenty-year old skinhead. Dad's subtle racism grew large in
Derek, after gang members killed his father. Dad was fighting a fire
when they shot him. Now Derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant
swastika tattooed over his heart.</P>
<P>Derek is more interested in the IDEAS of white supremacy than in its
culture of violence. At a basketball court, black and white tempers
flare. Derek channels the aggression into a game, black versus white,
for ownership of the courts. When the choice presents itself, Derek goes
for game point instead of the sucker-punch. </P>
<P>Cameron (Stacy Keach) steps in to Derek's life as a surrogate father. He
takes Derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings. Keeping his
own criminal record spotless, he uses Derek as a leader and organizer
for high-visibility racial intimidation. Derek obliges by leading his
younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes. At the bottom
of the chain, Derek's younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong, made famous
in TERMINATOR 2) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual
reasons, but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong.</P>
<P>One night three black youths break into Derek's truck, which is exactly
what Derek has been waiting for. Outside in his shorts and his tattoo,
he shoots them all. The third would-be thief, unarmed, is only wounded.
In the key scene of the film, Derek commands the kid into a position
where he can be killed with one glorious, enraptured, awful stomp. (The
fun-spoiling NC-17 of ORGAZMO seems even more inappropriate, considering
AMERICAN HISTORY X was rated R. What sort of country is this that says
sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal, ecstatic
violence?)</P>
<P>The police arrive just as Derek kills the last thief. Derek does not
resist the cops, and as they spin him around to cuff him, the film slows
down. Derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a
chilling, sadistic, satisfied grin.</P>
<P>Now in prison, Derek faces new challenges. As the black man in the
laundry tells him, "in the joint, you the nigra, not me." There is a
clique of swastika-wearing skinheads, but they are not interested in the
ideology of white supremacy. They only use the symbols as a means of
intimidation. Derek finds himself truly alone, truly in danger, and
truly afraid.</P>
<P>When Derek finally gets out of prison, he finds that his friends from
the gang have also changed. Without Derek's leadership, they have
shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist
culture. It is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's
screwed up. In the end, he spends quality time with is brother trying to
undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in Danny.</P>
<P>The film ends a little too deliberately, too neatly after the unchained
emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film, but it barely detracts
from the overall experience.</P>
<P>Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Although some of his
dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction, Norton's
performance compensated. (An example that comes to mind is his pep talk
before looting the store.) He also captured the essence of an older
brother. He took his responsibility as a role model to his younger
brother very seriously, very lovingly, both before and after his change
of heart.</P>
<P>Though clearly not for all tastes, this film is bold and daring. The
subject matter is ugly, cruel, and at times hard to look at.
Nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face. Kaye gives
us a good look at this fascinating, if distasteful, American subculture.</P>
