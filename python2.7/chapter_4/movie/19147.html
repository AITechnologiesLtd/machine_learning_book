<PRE>*1/2 out of four</PRE>
<P>Starring Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Rosie O'Donnell, Ross Malinger, Bill
Pullman. Rated PG.</P>
<P>I have nothing against unabashedly romantic films. When done right, with
at least slightly evident restraint, they can be engaging, sweeping,
appealing. But it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly
as Nora Ephron botched Sleepless in Seattle, a hollow, boring romance
that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers; the ones
willing to buy into Ephron's whiny views of life and romance.</P>
<P>Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, two of Hollywood's most likeable stars play Sam
Baldwin and Annie Reed, repectively. Baldwin's wife recently died and he
moved to Seattle with his son, Jonah, seeking to get away from the
familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse. Jonah senses
tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their
problems. Sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show, but
when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out.</P>
<P>Ephron has him do this so that Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) can hear it. Annie
is a happy woman. She is engaged to Walter, an allergy-prone working man
and seems to be perfectly content. But after hearing Sam the widower on
the radio show, she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is
willing to risk her engagement for it.</P>
<P>Five years after this movie hit theaters, Hanks, Ryan and Ephron would
team up again in the far better, although still sub-par romantic comedy
You've Got Mail, which is about people who hate each other in real life
falling in love on the internet. At least that movie had a sense of
spontaneity. Here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist
solely to set up for the last five. The fact that Sam and Annie will
finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is
perfunctory.</P>
<P>Sleepless in Seattle is full of wonderful performers; from its two leads
to supporting stars like Bill Pullman and Rosie O'Donnell. But none of
them can save the film from being a bore. Its characters are dull and
empty, its script isn't funny or particularly charming. The script has a
fundamental problem: Annie gives up, for little reason, her life with
Walter to pursue "Sleepless in Seattle," whom she has never even seen.
It's the kind of life decision that real people don't make, and its a
major, unforgivable plausibility sacrifice.</P>
<P>In essence, this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that
shouldn't even exist. It's a ten minute short film with ninety-five
minutes of filler. If you were to show me Sleepless In Seattle and I
didn't have to review it, you could just call me "Asleep in
Philadelphia."
