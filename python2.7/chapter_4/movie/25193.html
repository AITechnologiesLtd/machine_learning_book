"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>DreamWorks has more than made up for its recent family debacle The Road
to El Dorado with Chicken Run, the best children's movie since the
inception of the Toy Story franchise.  The premise – a unlikely blend of
Nick Park's quirky, Oscar-winning animation and British humor combined
with the prison-break genre – hardly seems like the kind of thing a
typical American family would drag their kids to on Saturday afternoon,
but Run is the rare exception of a film that is extremely enjoyable
across the entire demographic board.</P>
<P>Armed with clever television spots that rip off Gladiator (`The egg that
became a chicken') and Mission: Impossible 2 (read C:R-1), Run is set on
Tweedy's Farm, where a large group of chickens lives in constant fear of
the low egg production that would enrage the farm's diabolical owner,
Mrs. Tweedy (Miranda Richardson, Sleepy Hollow).  If you don't make with
the embryos, you get the axe, and most of the chickens are happy enough
to go along with the farm's simple rules.  The one exception is a spunky
hen named Ginger (Julia Sawalha, Saffron from Absolutely Fabulous), who
spends her days dreaming up ways to escape.  It's easy enough to for her
to break out on her own, but Ginger is determined to take all of the
other chickens with her, as well.  To get supplies for her schemes, she
trades eggs with two entrepreneurial rats dressed in bad suits.</P>
<P>Run's hilarious opening credits feature a montage of Ginger's failed
Wile E. Coyote-type escape attempts (featuring the funniest blueprints
since Jay and Silent Bob's drafts in Mallrats), each resulting in her
being tossed into the coal bin by the henpecked Mr. Tweedy (Tony
Haygarth) and his two vicious dogs.  One night, while Ginger is
wallowing in self-doubt about her ability to rescue her friends, she
encounters what appears to be a flying rooster that lands in the chicken
compound.  The cock is Rocky `the Rooster' Rhodes (Mel Gibson, Payback),
and as he streaks through the sky, he shouts `Freedom!' like Gibson's
memorable deathbed line in Braveheart.</P>
<P>Ginger and her mates see Rocky as their saving grace and agree to
temporarily hide the rooster from his former keepers (a circus, where he
performed as `The Lone Free Ranger') in exchange for flying lessons.  Of
course, roosters can't fly, and the middle third of the film
concentrates on the American Rocky scamming the British chickens by
saying he'll teach them everything he knows about flying.  Standouts
among the other birds include a dimwitted knitter named Babs (Jane
Horrocks, Little Voice) and a crusty ex-RAF rooster named Fowler
(Benjamin Whitrow).</P>
<P>The need to escape Tweedy's Farm is hastened by the arrival of a
barn-sized machine that makes chicken potpies (`chickens go in – pies
come out').  The contraption is featured in a fantastic scene where
Rocky and Ginger try to escape its gravy-slicked clutches.  It's a
better action sequence that anything in M:I-2 or Gone in 60 Seconds (but
not Gladiator), and it made me incredibly hungry, too.</P>
<P>In addition to sharp marketing slogans (`Escape or Die Frying' and
`Learn to Fly or Bake Like Pie'), Run is full of clever puns (like `It's
raining hen' and  `She's poultry in motion') and makes numerous
references to other films (they meet in Coop No. 17 for their covert
meetings, a la Stalag 17).  At one point, when it's becoming clear that
Rocky might be a scam artist, one hen loudly wonders if the rooster is
even American (Gibson is from Australia).  And on the educational front,
we also learn that chicken not only have teeth, but lips, too (one plays
the harmonica).</P>
<P>Run was co-directed by Nick Park and Peter Lord, whose animated Wallace
& Grommit won two Oscars for Best Animated Short.  The screenplay was
written by Karey Kirkpatrick (James & The Giant Peach), who based the
script on an original story by Park and Lord.  Run may be a little
intense for some young children – especially the pie machine, and the
fantastic finale, which I won't even begin to describe here.  The `G'
rating seems a little light here, considering the amount of cowering I
witnessed during these two scenes.</P>
