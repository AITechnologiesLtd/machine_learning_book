<P>"In Love and War" is a movie on tranquilizers.</P>
<P>When the U.S. entered World War I, Ernest  Hemingway, then a cub reporter,
wanted to join the fight in Europe but was rejected because of a bad eye.
He succeeded however  to be sent to Italy as an American Red Cross
ambulance driver. Soon after his arrival at the front where Austrians and
Italians were fighting, on July 18, 1918, just three days short of  his
19th birthday, he was seriously wounded in the leg. At the hospital he fell
in love with 26-year old nurse Agnes von Kurowsky. When he proposed to her,
first he was accepted, then Agnes changed her mind. They met just once in
Michigan and parted forever. Later Hemingway claimed that the two had made
love, while Agnes denied it.</P>
<P>Those adventures were later transformed into the classic Hemingway novel "A
Farewell to Arms." The book was touchingly filmed in 1932 with Gary Cooper
and Helen Hayes. The 1957 remake with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones is not
a particularly good movie but it does get partly redeemed by the supporting
cast, including talented Italian performers like  including Vittorio De
Sica and Alberto Sordi. In retrospect, it also gets redeemed by the
comparison with "In Love and War" which is based on  published research on
the actual Ernest-Agnes relationship.</P>
<P>After war's end, in the film  Agnes and her former patient Harry, meet in
New York. Says he: "It feels like one hundred years, not the eight months
since we left Italy."  The film too feels longer than its running time,
though the start is promising.</P>
<P>There are excellent war-scenes drawings behind the opening titles. The
arrival of American nurses in a small town has some humor. A marching band
delivers a raucous "Beer Barrel Polka," which most people think is a World
War II British song, whereas it was a Czech composition.  Apparently it
already existed in the Great War. That's one of this film's  contributions
to knowledge.</P>
<P>Soon matters go flat. As young Hemingway eagerly walks to the front lines
we hear the music of "The caissons keep rolling along." Yes,we get the
message: gung ho Ernest is earnest. Some hospital scenes are rather good,
even though certain points could have used greater stress --like the fact
that in wartime it was simpler to amputate a leg rather than painstakingly
try to avoid gangrene.</P>
<P>The Ernest-Agnes affair proceeds sluggishly. The the entire cast is low in
the personality department. Sandra Bullock can be a charmer, but  here her
appeal is below that of her other roles, and her acting is minimalistic.
Ditto, in spades, for  Chris O'Donnell. He is painfully young, an
end-of-century kid rather than a 1918 youth. He never hints at the
writer-to-be, at the macho figure that will become the Lost Generation
novelist, or at the older Papa Hemingway.  During what Mrs. Bucket would
call  "a riparian entertainment," -- a picnic by a river -- Ernest's
callowness causes Agnes to slap his face. You know that love-making cannot
be far behind.</P>
<P>Some episodes have the beauty of Italy as a pleasant distraction, but this
does not add anything to the story. Most scenes, too,are burdened by
persistent, characterless background music. Often praised composer George
Fenton must have been following misguided specifications.</P>
<P>First kiss--the music swells romantically. Ernest reads a letter--to
plaintive, unseen  strings. Ernest revisits the front --and more caissons
roll along. The couple's one and only sexual encounter just before Ernest
leaves for home, takes place in a bordello's rented room. It  comes with a
sentimental accordion melody ( a cliche usually reserved for shots of
Paris), before reverting to more strings. Finally, the sounds, now from
woodwinds and piano, become downright intrusive when Agnes visits Ernest in
Michigan.</P>
<P>Among the bits that may have been true but feel false, we have Agnes,
invited by an Italian surgeon and suitor to his house in Venice,
predictably finding out that it is a luxurious palazzo. Back in the USA,
Ernest reads Agnes's Dear John letter, has a fit, breaks everything in
sight. It's unconvincing, especially after Orson Welles had done so
smashingly better in his "Citizen Kane" bust-it-all scene.</P>
<P>Earlier, a letter from Ernest  to Agnes described future bliss: "You'll be
keeping the place spic and span while I write." The audience I saw it with
must not  have included feminists. No one giggled, gasped or howled.</P>
