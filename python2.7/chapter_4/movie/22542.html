<PRE>THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Like a filet mignon served rare, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is an
exquisite sensory experience that's cold at the center.</P>
<P>        Anthony Minghella's film (he made "The English Patient") is the
second adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel; the first, a 1960 French
feature starring '50's heartthrob Alain Delon, was called "Plein Soleil"
("Purple Noon").  As time and circumstance would have it, the films share
some impressive strengths: they're intensely rich and colorful, feature an
impressive cast (this one stars Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate
Blanchett, and Jude Law), and provide dazzling entertainment for a solid
couple of hours.</P>
<P>        However, "The Talented Mr. Ripley" often seems like a completely
different motion picture from "Purple Noon," since Minghella has developed
themes and characterizations not pursued in René Clément's original.</P>
<P>        Damon plays the talented Tom Ripley, a sometime pianist, oft-time
bathroom attendant, and full-time sociopath.  Early in the film, shipping
magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn, soon to be seen as the
prosecuting attorney in "Snow Falling on Cedars") mistakes Tom for a friend
of his errant son Dickie, currently living the playboy life on the Italian
Riviera.  Greenleaf, quite taken with Tom, makes him an offer he can't
refuse: bring Dickie back to New York for the princely sum of $1,000.</P>
<P>        In the Mediterranean resort of Mongibello, Tom quickly insinuates
himself into the lives of Dickie and his classically bland fiancée Marge
(Paltrow).  He wears Dickie's clothes, drinks Dickie's champagne, spends
Dickie's money.  But when Dickie grows tired of Tom, the talented Mr.
Ripley will stop at nothing to protect what--and whom--he has worked to
become.</P>
<P>        Damon and Law are as sun-drenched and handsome as the surrounding
topography, yet Paltrow is oddly graceless.  She really only impresses the
once, the lump-in-the-throat "I don't believe a single word you've said"
scene that's in the prevalent trailers.  Blanchett is much more interesting
as Meredith Logue, a slightly naïve socialite who keeps turning up in the
last places Tom wants to see her.</P>
<P>        Whereas I cannot fault "The Talented Mr. Ripley" in terms of its
technical accomplishments or star power, that cold center left me feeling a
little detached.  These are beautiful people for sure, but their
cold-heartedness left me more with a craving for hamburger than for prime
steak.</P>
