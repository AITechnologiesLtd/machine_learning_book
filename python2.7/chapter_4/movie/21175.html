<P>A number of well-known comedy directors - Joe ("The Howling", "Gremlins") 
Dante, John ("The Blues Brothers", "Kentucky Fried Movie") Landis and Carl 
("Caveman") Gottlieb - came together to make this grab-bag of comic 
sketches. The sketches self-consciously delve through various popular 
culture and genre parody without ever really amounting to anything 
particularly funny. There are a couple of segments that are amusing - a 
Landis-directed skit in which Arsenio Hall becomes accident prone all at 
once in his apartment; and a "Ripley's Believe It Or Not" send-up which asks 
the question: Was Jack the Ripper really the Loch Ness Monster ? The "Son of 
the Invisible Man" piece, parodying the 1940s "Invisible Man" sequels, in 
which Ed Begley Jr goes dancing around naked thinking he is invisible, and 
the title story parodying fifties B-grade outer space films, would probably 
have sounded funny on paper, but seem terribly belaboured on film. On the 
other hand there is that which would have sounded pretty juvenile on paper 
too, ranging from the instantly forgettable - the literally interpreted 
"Video Pirates" piece, one about a lonely bachelor who finds a participatory 
dirty video - to that which goes on at length to no - one where Rosanna 
Arquette's computer throws Steve Guttenberg's pick-up lines back at him - or 
quite awful points - Griffin Dunne's thoroughly terrible acting as a doctor 
who misplaces Michelle Pfeiffer's baby.</P>
