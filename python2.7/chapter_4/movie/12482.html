<PRE>"LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR" (USA, 1977)
A Film Review by James Kendrick
**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard Brooks || Screenplay: Richard Brooks (based on the novel by
Judith Rossner) || Stars: Diane Keaton (Theresa Dunn), Tuesday Weld (Katherine
Dunn), William Atherton (James), Richard Kiley (Mr. Dunn), Richard Gere (Tony),
Alan Feinstein (Martin), Tom Berenger (Gary), Priscilla Pointer (Mrs. Dunn) ||
MPAA Rating: R</P>
<P>"Looking For Mr. Goodbar" is a none-too-subtle cautionary tale about the dangers
of living a hedonistic nightlife masked by a legitimate daylife. The film stars
Diane Keaton as an attractive young woman named Theresa Dunn, who is a
successful and caring teacher of deaf students by day, and a nightclub-carousing
libertine by night. The message of director Richard Brooks, who adapted Judith
Rossner's popular novel of the same title, is twofold: first, a person can't
wear two faces at the same time without them interfering with each other, and
second, hedonism can only lead to eventual self-destruction.</P>
<P>Brooks gives us numerous reasons to explain Theresa's dangerous and often stupid
behavior when it comes to sex with strange men. Some of it is due to the
Freudian relationship with her overbearing father (Richard Kiley), as well as
her strict Catholic upbringing (why is Catholicism always blamed for sexual
dysfunction?). There was also a childhood episode involving extensive back
surgery, which left a long scar to remind her of the year she spent miserable in
a body cast.</P>
<P>Brooks also spends the first half-hour of the film detailing an unfulfilling
sexual relationship with her college professor, a blunt married man named Martin
(Alan Feinstein). Theresa has a crush on Martin, and although she gives up her
virginity to him, he basically treats her like dirt and dumps her, thus
introducing her to the notion that sex and love don't necessarily have to be
related. For the rest of the film, Theresa reverses the scenario with other men,
making sure that she is in the position of being the uncaring recipient of
pleasure, who doesn't have to take any responsibility for her actions.</P>
<P>And then there's the influence of Theresa's sister, Katherine (Tuesday Weld), a
light-headed airline stewardess who has numerous affairs and at least one
abortion, jumps into a quickie marriage with a Jewish man, and then experiments
with drugs, pornography, and group sex. Watching the two sisters develop as
characters is like watching side-by-side elevators going in opposite directions
- Katherine ends up getting clean and taking control of her life again, while
Theresa sinks into drugs, nameless sex, and general hedonism.</P>
<P>At one point in the film, Katherine tells Theresa that everybody is somehow
hurting, so everybody is looking for a painkiller; for Theresa, her heedless
lifestyle is her painkiller. She thinks that if she can have fun by sleeping
with strangers who never stay the night, she can absolve herself of the burden
of responsibility. The fact that it didn't work for Katherine should have been a
lesson for Theresa, but some people are simply intent on learning life's
harshest lessons firsthand, even if it means paying the ultimate price.</P>
<P>During the course of the film, Theresa meets a string of men, all of whom are
dangerous in one way or another. First, she meets a swinging, somewhat psychotic
playboy named Tony, played by a young Richard Gere with a bad Italian accent.
She later meets a liberal social worker named James (William Atherton), and
although he seems squeaky-clean on the outside, he harbors darkness inside.
There are others that are briefly mentioned in fleeting scenes, including a
perverted furniture salesman and a hypocritical police detective. Theresa sleeps
with all of them, because to her it's the sex that matters, not the person.</P>
<P>Parts of "Looking For Mr. Goodbar" are successful, especially its detailed
depiction of the Manhattan nightlife in the seventies. Some of it looks
painfully dated, especially the disco-themed soundtrack, but the basic timeless
elements are all there - heavy drinking, drug use, impulsive behavior, and an
atmosphere or reckless abandon.</P>
<P>The film was made several years before the AIDS epidemic struck, but that should
not blur the film's message. People sometimes forget that venereal disease is
not the only negative consequence of casual sex - there is a personal and
spiritual destruction, as well threats of physical violence. Anytime a person
allows someone else into that kind of physical closeness without knowing a thing
about him, there is an inherent element of risk that is made abundantly clear in
the film's graphically violent, but somehow inevitable conclusion.</P>
<P>Brooks, who has made many gritty, realistic films like "The Blackboard Jungle"
(1955) and the stark adaptation of Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood" (1967), would
seem like a perfect choice for this material. Social reality seems to be his
forte, but he goes against his better instincts by including several needless
fantasy sequences that are intended to illuminate Theresa's thoughts and dreams,
but end up being silly and distracting. Brooks also could have trimmed the film
by about twenty minutes, because it takes much more time than is needed to make
its point.</P>
<P>Much of the film's success can be attributed to Diane Keaton's stunning
performance. Almost the entire film is told from her point of view, which means
she is on-screen in almost every scene. Keaton makes Theresa into a complex
woman who knowingly wears two faces despite the obvious damage it is causing.
This is an incredibly difficult role to pull off, because Theresa must be both
infuriating and sympathetic at the same time. Keaton manages to do just that,
which lends weight and credibility to the cautionary tale the movie is so
desperate to put forward.</P>
