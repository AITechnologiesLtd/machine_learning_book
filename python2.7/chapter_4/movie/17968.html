Susan Granger's review of "eXistenZ" (Dimension Films, a division of Miramax)</P>
<P>The title, "eXistenZ," is the name of a virtual reality video
game in this psychologically disturbing sci-fi horror tale. Like
"Naked Lunch," "The Fly," "Crash" and other David Cronenberg films,
it's ghoulish, grisly and grotesque, filled with slimy, squishy,
repugnant creatures and cryptic sexual imagery. Jennifer Jason Leigh
stars as Allegra Geller, the supposedly brilliant designer of the
world's most awesome and challenging games. Accusing her of being a
"goddess" and "demoness," an enemy of reality, various people are
attempting to assassinate her, using a gristle gun, defined as "A
pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of
a small mammal, whose snout is the barrel and whose rigid hind leg is
the trigger. Instead of bullets, the gun shoots human teeth." So she
retreats to a throbbing fantasy world by stroking a "game pod," a
fleshy lump with various indentations and nipples, that is attached to
a "bioport" that is surgically inserted in game players' spines and
connected by an umbilical cord. She is accompanied on this wild
journey by a bland, bewildered companion, played by Jude Law, and her
most memorable trippy encounter is with Willem Dafoe, as a demented
mechanic. Allegedly, David Cronenberg was inspired by the plight of
Salman Rushdie when he concocted the exaggerated "writer in jeopardy"
premise and asked his actors to read philosophy of Sartre, Camus,
Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche to get into the mood of the picture. But
much the same satiric concept was already explored in "Strange Days"
(1995) and the final, eerie, macabre plot twist is painfully
obvious. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "eXistenZ" is an
artsy, absurdly weird 5. At one point, Jude Law says, "I find this
disgusting but I can't help myself." Me, too.</P>
