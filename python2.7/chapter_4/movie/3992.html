<P>     The future for earth is bleak.  Our home planet has turned mostly
into desert (global warming?) and pollution is worse than anyone could
imagine.  The harsh conditions has earned Earth the term 'The Cursed
Earth.'  People no longer live anywhere they wish, all of them cram
into Mega Cities (very-very large cities), which brings us to Mega City
One, Dredd's very own playground.  In Mega Cities, the higher up the
building you live, the safer you are, the higher your status.  Down on
the street, crime and chaos rules.  The normal judiciary system is no
longer useful in bringing justice to Mega Cities, there is just too
much chaos.  Instead, police-cum-army-cum-judge enforcers are
deployed.  Judgement is passed by the arresting judge as soon as
wrongdoers are arrested.</P>
<P>     Based on the phenomenal British comic series of the same title,
JUDGE DREDD showcases lots of dead bodies (as in the comics) and some
really impressive action sequences laced with goo-goo-bytes of computer
generated special effects.  Judge Dredd (Stallone) prowl Mega City One,
passing judgement on those he arrests.  Meanwhile, a notorious villian,
Rico (Assante) escapes from a penal colony, wreaks chaos in Mega City
One and also contributes to the tons of bodies already donated by
Dredd.  The sets are lavish, the computer generated city is
breathtaking but the costumes, well...a bit too colourful and clean to
be taken seriously.</P>
<P>     The plot is typical of most of Hollywood's action films; just
about as thin as the air in outer space.  I was lucky to have a Judge
Dredd comic fan sitting next to me, and he explained nearly all of the
jargon and culture that only Dredd fans would know.  I actually enjoyed
the movie quite a bit.  The introduction was a bit corny but the thick
action helped erase that negative thought.  There is enough action to
satisfy action-hungry and entertainment-seeking movie goers but the
ending really really does leave a lot to be desired.  The script, too,
proved too corny at times but hey, so were most of Stallone's previous
action flicks.</P>
<P>     Stallone is his usual self; minimal dialogue, 'action speaks
louder than words.'  Assante, though physically less appealing than
Stallone, managed to play the psychotic Rico rather well.  Apart from
the really weak, anti- climactic ending, JUDGE DREDD is a pretty
polished action movie.  I particularly liked the fast-paced chase
sequence around, on top and under the buildings of Mega City One.  The
ABC War Machine which Rico uses as his bodyguard was really menacing.
You'll probably like this movie if you don't mind the ending (highly
unlikely) or you're a true blue Stallone or Judge Dredd comic fan.</P>
