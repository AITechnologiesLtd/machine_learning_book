COLOR OF NIGHT
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>When I was little boy, I wanted to grow up and become
psychiatrist. It looked like a really attractive profession
to me - you earn money by doing nothing, just sitting and
listening to complete strangers while they confess the most
intimate details of their lives. However, even such life can
have some bad sides - some psychiatrists may become wanted
war criminals, and some, like Robert Capa, protagonist of
1994 thriller COLOR OF NIGHT, may happen to see their
patients jumping to their deaths through his own office
window. Capa (played by Bruce Willis) is shaken by
experience, so he needs some help from his old friend and
colleague Bob Moore (Scott Bakula) who lives in California.
However, after repeated death threats, Bob gets killed and
Capa, advised by police Lt. Sanchez (Ruben Blades), decides
to find the killer among the picturesque members of Bob's
therapy group. When he isn't solving the mystery, Capa is
engaged in passionate love affair with mysterious and sexy
girl name Rose (Jane March). In the meantime, the killer
begins stalking and targetting Capa too.</P>
<P>Many people actually despise this film, and they probably
have a lot of good reasons. First problem is in the
disorganised screenplay by Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray,
which is strange and not very successful mix of Agatha
Christie-like "whodunnit" thriller, and psychological drama.
Another is terrible miscasting of Bruce Willis who has some
serious problems in convincing the audience that he is
actually intellectual. Then, there is a bunch of awfully
stereotyped minor characters that serve as collective comic
relief. The plot is, of course, formulaic and totally
predictable, with the obligatory and not very thrilling
climatic showdown in abandoned warehouse. And, finally, many
film-lovers were disappointed to see Richard Rush, very
talented director of 1970s, engaged in this typical
Hollywood garbage, far bellow high standards of that golden
era.</P>
<P>However, what saves this film from total failure are the
actors. Brad Dourif and Lesley Ann Warren are charming as
the members of Capa's support group, same as Ruben Blades as
Chicano detective. Finally, Jane March looks really
attractive and although her allegedly steamy sex scenes with
Willis (the ones that caused some rating controversy)
definitely aren't worth the hype, she is at least good thing
to see. And finally, some elements of the screenplay, like
the lesbian relationship, have certain trash quality that
would give this film certain aura of "it's so bad that is
good" guilty pleasure. Anyway, with more of two hours of
length (with extra twenty minutes in integral version) this
film can be hard to watch for those expecting high quality
entertainment. Those more relaxed and equipped with the
benefits of VCR technology, might enjoy it a little bit
more.</P>
