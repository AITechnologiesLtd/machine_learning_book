<PRE>BATMAN & ROBIN (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>"Bring back Tim Burton! Bring back Tim Burton!" the little voice in the
back of my head kept screaming, and this was only five minutes into Batman
& Robin. The voice got louder and louder as the movie got worse and worse.
I've always loved Batman, from the cheezy campy TV show that I watched as a
kid to the comics to the Tim Burton movies to the animated series. When
Joel Schumacher came on board with the third installment of the big screen
Batman series, I thought he made a decent attempt a directing Batman
Forever. Sure, Forever had a different look and a different -- more action
-- feel to it, but it was a fun film.</P>
<P>With Batman & Robin it looks like Schumacher wants to take the series back
to the old days of the Batman TV series, adding a full compliment of
campiness to it. I'm thankful he hasn't -- yet -- brought the big exploding
lettered action cards to the big screen (remember? BLAM! CRASH! ZOW!) But,
Schumacher comes pretty close to it. To say the least, Batman & Robin is
the worse of the big screen Batman series. To be even more honest, it's one
of the worst big budget movies I've seen this year.</P>
<P>The script by Batman Forever's Akiva Goldsman is so paper thin that I'm
hesitant to even waste time explaining it. In one sentence: Mr. Freeze and
Poison Ivy want to kill Batman, Batman and Robin want to kill each other,
and we get a new add-on rubberized suit super heroine.</P>
<P>How's George Clooney as the new face behind the mask?  Clooney gives an
admirable performance as Batman, and is the only actor in Batman that is
not over-the-top or sliding deep past overacting. I like Clooney as Batman
more than I did Kilmer, but I still think that Michael Keaton is the real
Batman.   Chris O'Donnell is annoying as the annoying Dick Grayson/Robin.
Arnold Schwarzenegger must have been paid a lot of money to throw his
reputation on this awful movie.  He gives the worse performance of the
whole cast of big name stars.  His overacting is unbearable.  Uma Thurman
does a bit better than Arnold Schwarzenegger, but not by much.  And Alicia
Silverstone looks like she can barely fit into that kinky rubbersuit.</P>
<P>As for Clooney, of the three action films that I've seen of his -- Batman &
Robin, The Peacemaker, and From Dusk Till Dawn -- this is the worse film of
his action career.  He's a good actor, and he really deserves better that
any of his previous action films.  If you want to see Clooney in a somewhat
decent action movie, try The Peacemaker.
Schumacher has brought the whole Batman series to its lowest point with
this film.  And with rumors of another film in the series, I have only one
piece of advice for the studios, "Bring back Tim Burton!  Bring back Tim
Burton!"  As much as I like Clooney as Batman, at this point just about
anyone can be Batman.  Burton's Batman was a dark man living in a dark
world.  Schumacher's Batman is a cardboard cutout comic character running
around like a headless chicken in a comic book world.</P>
<P>Batman & Robin is just plain awful.  Save your money.  Miss it, Miss it,
Miss it.  I'm sorry I spent the two hours watching this film.  The only
thing that carried me on watching was to see how much worse the film could
get.  And after the first few minutes when the film starts to go down hill,
the hill becomes intangibly more steep as each passing minute comes along.
This film is not fun it's just painful.  Save yourself from the pain.</P>
