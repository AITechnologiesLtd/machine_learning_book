<P>   Whenever I see a movie like "The Godfather," brimming
with bad guys and bustling with rackets, I think: "These fellas
are making big bucks, but they're also taking big risks.  They
get executed by their own kind, shot up by the cops, and sent
up the river for life without parole. If they manage to survive to
the age of 70, what have their done with their millions of ill-
gotten lucre?  They don't travel, they don't eat out much, their
houses are ordinary (though they may have thousand-dollar
suits), their cars are affordable by ordinary Joes, and what's
more they have to pay a good part of their earnings to
bodyguards and alarm systems and police payoffs."  Then I
realize. These characters are not in it for the money but for
the thrills, the discharge of power, the fun of thumbing their
nose at society's rules, and most of all for the high they get
for stepping back into the past and acting like tribal chieftans. 
So it was with Martin Cahill, the most infamous Irish criminal
of the 1980s.  Sit engrossed through John Boorman's new
movie, "The General," and you get the impression that Cahill
robbed, severely disciplined his band of punks, and lived
happily with two "wives," to display his contempt, his disgust,
his feral hatred of society's institutions.  In Boorman's two
hour and nine-minute work, filmed in black-and-white to
cement the mythic, atavistic nature of the story, Cahill
(Brendan Gleason) is nothing if not inflamed by the Dublin
establishment: the Church, the police, the pols.  He hates
institutions so much that he has contempt even for the fellow
Catholics in the IRA which he looks upon--for its radicalism--
as nothing less than another rigid organization.  Never mind
that he ran an association himself, a group of eight or ten
cohorts whose passion is provoked more for the punts than
the veneration.  In splashing the story of this slippery
individual--who relied on clever counselors and counterfeit
alibis to avoid being on the run--Boorman instinctively
conveys a portrait of a cross-section of Irish society which
looked upon Cahill as a modern Robin Hood.  </P>
<P>  "The General"--which netted writer-director Boorman the
well-earned best-director's prize at the '98 Cannes Festival
before it took to rest of the film-festival circuit--begins with the
title character's execution at the hands of a lone member of
the IRA.  A flashback takes us to Cahill's boyhood (played by
"Butcher Boy" Eamon Owens) in a Dublin slum where he
helps support his family by stealing food, in one instance a
whole pig, to the cheers of his neighbors--who find time to
pelt the pursuing police with assorted missiles.  Apprehended
and sent to a Church-run reformatory, he succeeds in fending
off the sexual advances of a priest, and so appends the pious
to his inventory of hateful institutions.  When he is
thrown out of his housing by well-meaning urban renewal
people, though not after camping out in a desperate attempt
to stop the demolition, he acquires a distaste for the
government.  Thumbing his nose even at the institution of
marriage, he sets up a conjugal arrangement with Frances
(Maria Doyle Kennedy) and Frances' younger sister Tina
(Angeline Ball), whom he impregnates without acquiring a
scintilla of Frances' covetousness.  After a series of break-ins
to acquire gifts of trains and the like for his family, me moves
to the big time, he and his gang of amiable ruffians robbing
O'Connors carefully-guarded jewelry outlet of millions in
jewels and gold bars, then proceeding to carry away a
Vermeer worth twenty million punts.  ("I don't know much
about art," he muses, "but I know what I like.")  Though
awash in capital, he continues to live frugally, getting his kicks
from breaking into a home to threaten a woman about to
testify against him in court.</P>
<P>   If Boorman has a central focus it is with the series of
confrontations between Cahill and a police inspector
determined to bring him down, Ned Kenny (Jon Voight).  With
Kenny as Javert to Cahill's Jean Valjean, Boorman furthers
the criminal's reputation by tallying his ability to bring the tight-
lipped, socially-conscious policeman to Cahill's base level. 
While at an earlier time Kenny gives Cahill some avuncular
advice about getting a respectable job and moving out of his
"sewer" of a neigbhborhood, he ends by lashing out physically
against the man he has grown to despise utterly and
becomes tainted with the suspicion that he set Cahill up for
an IRA hit.</P>
<P>   While there is one spot of unequivocal violence in the
picture, when Cahill virtually crucifies a member of his gang
for allegedly stealing from the booty, Boorman fixes on Cahill
the man.  Not previously known for much depth of
psychological insight (his best-known film "Deliverance," also
featuring Jon Voight, stresses pure terror over cerebral
depths), Boorman has succeeded splendidly in interpreting a
criminal's disposition: Cahill's sense of humor which serves
him well in evading a police surveillance team, and
particularly his habit of covering his face with his hands when
surrounded by photographers, who seem never to get a clear
shot of him for their papers.</P>
<P>   Brendan Gleeson, who plays the arch-criminal, is well-
known in Ireland, less celebrated in the U.S.  He is not the
sort of actor that American studios would select for the role,
preferring glitzier figures like Antonio Banderas, Al Pacino and
Robert De Niro.  After all, Gleeson is short, plump and
baldish, a fellow who can be designated "the Irish Gerard
Depardieu," and perhaps because of this humanity is able to
enlist our sympathies.  Jon Voight, then, becomes the ideal
choice for his nemesis, his antithesis: a bourgeois police
officer intent on keeping his district neat, clean, orderly and
yes, bland.  "The General" is an original take on the crime
genre, photographed in black and white and cleverly edited to
underscore its title character's status as a legend in his time,
a man who pays homage to his country's roots as a land
governed not by impersonal, central forces but by the vigor of
Celtic tribes.</P>
