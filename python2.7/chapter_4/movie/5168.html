<PRE>                                 D. C. CAB
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1983) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        If anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late-night cable 
show hosted by Gilbert Gottfried showcasing some of the worst films 
of the 80's, they'd agree D.C. CAB is the quintessential "USA Up All 
Nite" movie. It's one of those childish R-rated movies that kids would 
love but can't see until it's edited for TV. It's also one of those 
pointless, almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs. And, 
strike three, it pairs Mr. T with Gary Busey.</P>
<P>        I heard Gilbert say D.C. CAB had "an all-star cast," but I'm 
still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement. 
When third-billing goes to a two-minute appearance by famed 
flashdancer Irene Cara "as herself," you can't say a damn thing 
about all-star casts. Likewise for token appearances by Marsha 
"Roz" Warfield, Paul Rodriguez and "Politically Incorrect" host 
Bill Maher, before he was somebody. Appearing in D.C. CAB 
pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else, especially 
Irene "I'm Gonna Live Forever" Cara.</P>
<P>        D.C. CAB is an ensemble comedy from Joel Schumacher 
(who would go on to direct BATMAN FOREVER) about a bunch of 
misfits who drive cabs. You get the feeling if the POLICE ACADEMY 
cadets had made a different career choice, this would be the result, 
except here you have such interesting characters as the "token white 
guy" (Busey) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before 
they take over the world, the token jive talker named Tyrone (Charlie 
Barnett) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word "honkey" as 
much as possible, the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains 
(Mr. T -- a real stretch for him), the aspiring musician waiting for his 
big break (Maher), the Mexican gigolo (Rodriguez), the woman who 
actually wants to drive cabs for a living (Warfield) and the guy who 
wants to own a cab company for a living (Adam Baldwin).</P>
<P>        We've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80's. Some 
are fun to watch and some are actually funny. This one is more or 
less neither. You'd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the 
assemblage of talent (whatever), but D.C. CAB more or less falls flat 
on a continual basis, culminating in the usual contrived Hollywood 
finale as Baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to 
rescue him. It's a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the 
depths of stale jokes and unoriginality. D.C. CAB has rightly earned 
its position on "USA Up All Nite."</P>
