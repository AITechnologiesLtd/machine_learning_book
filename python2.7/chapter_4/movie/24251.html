- Tom Ripley, THE TALENTED MR.RIPLEY</P>
<PRE>RATING: 10/10 - BEST PICTURE - #4</PRE>
<P>After the passionate and sensually seductive "The English Patient", everyone
were waiting in anticipation for director Anthony Minghella's next film. And
here it is. A sophisticated and brilliantly creepy film experience that will
mesmerize and shock you to the last frame. This is as far as psychological
thrillers go. Hichock's "Psycho", Kubrick's "The Shining", Demme's "The
Silence of the Lambs" and Fincher's "The Game" can be compared to this
spine-chilling masterpiece. Minghella offers you the guilty seasonal
pleasure of pure evil in its most luxuriant form.</P>
<P> The film is based on Patricia Highsmith's 1955 cult novel with the same
title. Set in the mid-50s, the story begins in an exquisite garden party,
where Tom Ripley (Matt Damon ) is playing the piano for the cream of
aristocracy. When finished, he is stopped by a wealthy businessman that
mistakes him for being a friend to his son, Dickie (Jude Law). Tom is then
offered $1000 for going to Italy and bring his irresponsible son back from
his dream world to his father and the real life. Tom, pretending to know
Dickie, agrees. It is here we start suspecting that Tom is more than a good
looking pianist. He is starting to prepare for his trip, collecting all
information about Dickie, including his taste for music. In Italy, Tom is
instantly liked by Dickie and Dickie's cultured fiancé, Marge (Gwynlyth
Paltrow ), pretending to love jazz and having the same interests, while
soaking into luxury. Here, the audience and Dickie is about to discover that
there is a lot hiding under Tom's mask of innocence. He is a man of many
talents, including lies, forgery and such accurate impersonations of
different people, their voices and behavior, that hair will rice on your
heads. His solitary life makes him vulnerable and he is reaching for
attention and love. This is how it begins -- as a story of possession. Tom
wants Dickie. He wants to be the center of Dickie's world and, because he is
a new refreshment in Dickies privileged life, he is. At this time Minghella,
his cast, crew and audience are taking a wonderful vacation. You can almost
feel the fresh ocean breeze and gentle sun. You can relax in the lush
vineyards with Dickie, Marge and Tom, while enjoying the intoxicating blend
of jazz, suntan lotion and gin-and-tonic-on-the-rocks. This is heaven on
earth. Seductive, fresh. You never want to leave. But Dickie bores easily,
and when his old-time pal named Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman ) shows up,
Tom is brutally pushed into the background, with all feelings slowly
cropping up. Now he wants Dickie in another way. If he can't his love, he
will have Dickie's life, with all its pleasures..</P>
<P>Minghella is exploring the human nature, mind and soul. Like American Beauty
and Eyes Wide Shut, this is a film about two worlds, two plans of existence.
In one you are who you are and in another you are who you are supposed to
be. One is a world of masks and illusions, another is a reality that we all
hide. Tom Ripley is caught between these two worlds. He is charming,
beautiful and can make anybody like, love and respect him. But behind the
mask of innocence and charm, lurks another truth, that is more frightening
than anyone imagines. In truth he is searching, as everyone else, for
fulfillment, happiness, peace. In other words for a perfect life. His
methods, however, are close to paranoia. It is a frightening story about
class envy. Tom is so unsatisfied with his own life and himself, that he is
willing to sacrifice his soul, his identity, his life to become someone
else. He ends up in a solitary existence (portrayed in a powerful scene
where he alone unpacks his Christmas presents that he has bought for
himself). In numbness and emptiness. His life becomes an eternal fear and
charade, as he covers up his true identity with mask after mask, until he
looses it completely. In several scenes it seems that Tom is a homosexual,
in others he is definitely not. This is never explained and that is the
point. He becomes nothing more than a combination of masks, under which is
nothing, emptiness. Somewhere you can sense an echo of critique of the
modern society, where money, status and image is everything, including
fulfillment. In his bizarre and twisted search for happiness, Tom has
misunderstood money for bliss. There are moments, when he dreams of giving
someone the key to his dark soul, but he realizes that it is too late and
that there are too many demons in his past for him to start a new. His past
can not be washed away. Hurt, angry and confused, he couldn't understand
where he did go wrong.</P>
<P>Matt Damon (Saving Private Ryan and Dogma) plays this spine-chilling
chameleon with uncanny -- and quite spooky -- ease. It is frightening to see
him  float into different persons, copying their voices and personalities.
This talented young actor is a joy to behold and should get a nomination at
this years Academy Awards. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see Tom
Ripley become a recurring antihero -- like a Hannibal Lecter (returning next
year in "Hannibal"). Equally magnificent is the surprisingly fascinating
performance of Jude Law ("Gattaca", eXistenZ) as the sharp, fresh young
Casanova, reminding about Sonny from the "Godfather". Gwynlyth Paltrow
("Sliding Doors" and Shakespeare in Love) is impressive as always as the
smart, good-hearted Marge and Cate Blanchet (Elizabeth) is fabulous as the
elegant, sophisticated beauty that falls under Tom's spells, naively
believing his lies. Another interesting performance is provided by Hoffman
("Boogie Nights" and Magnolia). Speaking in a lockjaw tone, he is amusing as
the local "provider" of earthly pleasures. The supporting cast is equally
convincing.</P>
<P>This film is so beautifully shaped, that there are not enough words to
describe its perfection. The elegant cinematography, rich art direction,
precise editing and heavenly music (Gabriel Yared) combine in a colorful
blend that will electrify you from the first to the last frame. And yet, it
is not the visual aspect that makes this a powerful and memorable
experience. It is the intellect and sophistication of the plot and the
magnificence of the acting that create a frightening, thought provoking
epic, that even Hichock would not direct any better.</P>
<P>- "What ever you do..How ever terrible, how ever hurtful..No body thinks
that they are a bad person.."
