<P>   When Loews was about to open the big, new Kips Bay
Theater in midtown Manhattan, the company's ad campaign
emphasized that the building would serve the city's eight
million movie critics.  If everybody's a critic, we're all actors
as well.  We've been putting on acts ever since we were little
kids, performing for our parents.  When we become adults we
don't all try to become professionals, but it seems that way. 
After all, a profession that leaves 96% of its staff unemployed
at any given time is overcrowded to say the least.  Some of
us say that we'd give our right arm to play the part of Cyrano,
or Juliet, or Agamemnon, but the less masochistic among us
would "kill to get the part."  Writer-director Amos Poe takes
that last exclamation literally and in so doing fashions an
imaginative neo-noir comic romp that is alternately bloody
and mirthful, unfeeling and sentimental, expressive and
frosty.  What a pity that as a story "Frogs for Snakes" does
not gel, as the imaginative indie features a stunning
performance by Barbara Hershey in the role of the only
member of an acting class that can actually enact a scene
convincingly.  She's bogged down by a plot that for all its
brevity is more convoluted than "Pulp Fiction" while at the
same time possessing its share of engaging surprises. </P>
<P>   As Eva, Barbara Hershey appears all things to all people. 
By day a waitress in a lower-Manhattan diner, she spends
her nights alternately working as a violent collector for a loan-
shark and as a burnt-out student in an acting class.  With a
five-year-old son in tow, she longs to get out of the rat-race,
to move to a small home on Long Island, get a job
somewhere, and give up the hip, stressful milieu that makes
New York the world's most exciting city.  The ex-wife of gang
boss Al Santana (Robbie Coltrain), she continues to work for
the man by maiming his deadbeats while for his part, Al
considers himself more an impresario than a mafioso.  Al,
who runs an off-Broadway theater, is currently casting for
David Mamet's "American Buffalo."  Never mind how shallow
some of his fellow mobsters appear: all fancy themselves to
be contemporary Marlon Brandos.  When they're not killing or
crippling deadbeats, double-crossers, and especially those
who are competing with them for the precious three roles in
the play, they are practicing monologues in their desperate
desire to strut their stuff on Al's miserable stage.</P>
<P>   At times you'll not know for sure when the actors are
continuing their conversation or entering into monologues, so
closely are life and art blended into director Poe's tangled,
meandering plot.  Nor is there much justification for some of
the murderous actions, particularly one that takes place in a
bar--a shootout that reminds us of the turbulent scenes that
took place in Dodge City saloons between songs performed
by a chanteuse named Kitty.  </P>
<P>   The cast seem to be having fun, though.  John Leguizamo
as Zip is somewhat more passionate about his Marlon
Brando impersonation than about his sexy liaison with Eva,
while Debi Mazar as Simone resembles every director's
groan of a loser: a vindictive bimbo who is among those who
murder the competition for time on the stage.  Eva's decision
to take off from the Big City and head out to New York's
lighthouse country down east does not seem convincing.
She's too hip to last a month vegetating in a Long Island
shack, as he ex, Al, puts things.  Hers is a dazzling
performance, all the more so because she stands out among
the losers to do their best for Poe to sound like frustrated
thesps.  On the whole, the cast strain so much for
amateurism that the movie as a whole comes across as
though from a neophyte director's overly ambitious excesses. 
The title of the movie is from Sonny Boy Williamson's 1957
song "Fattering Frogs for Snakes," which has the lyrics, "It
took me a long time to find out my mistakes.  It took me a
long time to find out my mistakes, but I bet you my bottom
dollar, I am fatterning no more frogs for snakes."  Or so Eva
feels as she leaves her corrupt life behind.</P>
