<P>What a pleasant way to wrap up the summer film season. Leisurely and 
smart, "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" is the cinematic equivalent of 
sipping an umbrella drink on a warm, breezy evening. There's no meteors 
racing towards Earth here, no wisecracking cops, evil spies or government 
conspiracies. There's not a single explosion in the film. "How Stella Got 
Her Groove Back" is the kind of movie that invites you to relax, ease 
back in your seat and simply enjoy spending a couple of lazy hours with a 
group of likable, extremely well-drawn characters. </P>
<P>Based on the novel by Terry McMillan (who co-wrote the film with Ron 
Bass), "Stella" is a laid-back, intelligent and often funny love story, 
gently examining how pursuing financial security and adhering to social 
rules can divert a person from the things that really matter. Some 
critics dismissed the novel, stating that in contrast to her other books 
("Mama," "Disappearing Acts" and "Waiting to Exhale"), "Stella" was just 
a trifle. Having not read any of her work, all I can say is that this 
"trifle" certainly translates wonderfully to the screen.</P>
<P>Stella (Angela Bassett) is 40 years old and settled in her ways. A single 
mother, she juggles a highly successful career as an investment analyst 
with caring for her bright young son. Her friends repeatedly urge her to 
take a break from her heavy workload, but Stella ignores them until one 
day, while her son is away with relatives, she gets a whim and takes off 
with her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) for a vacation in Jamaica.</P>
<P>Once on the Caribbean island, the movie finds its groove, even while 
Stella struggles to locate hers. Brimming with beautiful landscapes, 
gorgeous sunsets and happy tourists, the playful, almost giddy mood is 
infectious. Bassett delivers a smoky, multi-layered performance and 
Goldberg is delightful as the outspoken, horny Delilah, who divides her 
time between trying to help Stella loosen up and trying to get herself 
laid. </P>
<P>Soon enough, Stella meets Winston (Taye Diggs), a charming, great-looking 
Jamaican man 20 years her junior. Sparks fly, and the two quickly end up 
playing out the kind of magical love affair most vacationers only dream 
of. But what will they do when the vacation is over? Their social, 
cultural and financial worlds are as different as their countries and, of 
course, there's that age-difference business.</P>
<P>Choices are weighed, decisions made, and before you know it, Winston is 
in San Francisco, trying to adjust to life with Stella and her son. 
Naturally, there's complications galore, but while their fates are 
uncertain, it's clear to the viewer that these people were made for each 
other.</P>
<P>If it all sounds too good to be true, try this out for size. The story is 
loosely based on McMillan's real-life affair with a younger Jamaican man, 
who currently lives with her in California. Whether it's sheer writing 
skill, knowledge based on experience or, more likely, a combination of 
the two, McMillan's characters have a depth and resonance uncommon for 
players in such frothy fare. </P>
<P>The cast has a great time with those characters. Angela Bassett was 
sensational in "What's Love Got To Do With It" and it's nice to see her 
get another major showcase for her skills. After great turns here and in 
"Ghost," Whoopi Goldberg should seriously consider skipping the starring 
roles and focusing her talents on supporting characters. And watch out 
for Taye Diggs. Sexy with an assured, but sweet presence, this 
charismatic young actor has a big future ahead of him.</P>
<P>>From the title alone, it's easy to predict how a film like this will end, 
but getting there is such a pleasure, thanks to fine acting, characters 
you can relate to, and a number of finely spun vignettes. A nice example 
is a scene where Winston meets Stella's ex at a barbecue. When the older 
man sees the young buck with Stella, what does he do? He shares a beer 
with the kid and give him some sage advice. McMillan has a knack for 
taking conventional scenes and zigging where most writers zag, adding a 
fresh feeling to the proceedings. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the proceedings go on a bit too long. At roughly two hours,
 "Stella" is about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. Where, oh where,
 are the editors when we really need them? Why can't they realize that 
with elegant, eloquent films like "Stella" and "The Horse Whisperer," 
there definitely can be too much of a good thing?</P>
<P>Despite being overly long, "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" remains one 
of the most gratifying films of the summer. After months of enduring 
overblown event movies that failed to deliver on their promises, a warm, 
winning confection like "Stella" serves as a welcome mini-vacation from 
the Hollywood hype merchants.</P>
