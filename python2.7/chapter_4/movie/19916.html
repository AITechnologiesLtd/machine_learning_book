<PRE>`Mystery Men' – Nothing Super Here
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>In the neon-heavy metropolis of Champion City, crime has been all but
quashed by the strong arm of justice possessed by the local superhero,
Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). Due to his ability to fight crime,
there hasn't been much need for him anymore.  His latest act of heroism
involves rounding up a group of goggle-wearing punks that disrupt a
party at a nursing home.  This is hardly the stuff of superhero legend
and the Captain knows it.  His solution is to recommend the release of
one of his archenemies, Dr. Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush), from
his prison sentence.  Perhaps a renewed battle of good versus evil will
elevate his status among the people.  This would not only keep his ego
healthy, but would keep his publicist happy as well.  Yes, a publicist.
 After all, you won't be popular just because you're super-strong and
can fly like a bird.</P>
<P>`Mystery Men' takes a comedic look at the life of a superhero.  These
guys aren't millionaire playboys.  Rather, as in Captain Amazing's
case, they need advertising sponsors to defray the cost of
crimefighting.  It's probably pretty expensive dry cleaning those
outfits.  Captain Amazing wears a suit covered with so many sponsor
patches that you're not sure whether he's a crimefighter or a stock car
racer.  Alas, Amazing's plan backfires and now the evil Dr.
Frankenstein holds him captive.  Luckily, within Champion City are a
slew of Amazing wannabes that also wants to fight crime.  They include
Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) whose power seems to be making empty threats
while seething with anger; Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) who can throw forks
with amazing accuracy and strength; and The Shoveler (William H. Macy)
who whacks people with a huge spade.  Why don't these guys deserve more
credit for their crimefighting efforts?  Probably it's because they are
terrible at it.  They wind up hurting each other more than the bad
guys. But soon, these three half-baked heroes will discover that the
fate of Champion City will be in their hands.</P>
<P>But they need help, and eventually enlist Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell)
who can only turn invisible when you don't look at him, The Bowler
(Janeane Garofalo) who has a bowling ball with a mind – skull actually
– of its own, and The Spleen (Paul Reubens) whose weapon is noxious
gusts of flatulence.  It's a pretty strange assortment of heroes who
will be saving us all, but at least they didn't recruit other
questionable heroes like Waffleman (who hits people with a griddle
pan), the Pencilhead (who erases crime), or PMS Avenger (who only works
4 days a week).  To channel their energy and to develop their skills in
preparation for the big battle with Frankenstein, they accept tutelage
from The Sphinx (Wes Studi) who is a fountain of stupid aphorisms.  He
says things like `learn to control your rage our your rage will control
you' and `be a part of the wolf pack and not part of a six pack.'  </P>
<P>At its heart, Mystery Men has some clever ideas about what the average
‘blue-collar' crimefighter is like.  My favorite scene was when these
three contemplate the true identity of Captain Amazing.  Though Amazing
and his alter ego look obviously identical, when one wears glasses, the
resemblance disappears!  Much of the script is written to take
advantage of the comedic gifts of Stiller's dysfunctionality and
Garofalo's charm.  But ideas and words are not enough.  It becomes very
apparent that this film has neither direction nor structure to speak
of.  The abundance of characters makes this film chaotic at times. 
Couple this with a lot of swirling special effects, the result is a
film that's too cluttered to enjoy.  It almost made me want to leap off
a tall building in a single bound.  How the likes of Mr. Furious and
his crimefighting sophomores manage to actually save the world is a
complete mystery to me.</P>
