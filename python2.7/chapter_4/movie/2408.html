<P>     For those who think that foreign-language films must always be
pretentious and lugubrious, COMBINATION PLATTER provides a pointed
counterexample.  Although this is not an entirely Chinese movie (it
takes place in Flushing, New York, and approximately forty percent of
the dialogue is in English), the presence of frequent subtitles will
argue otherwise as far as most casual movie-goers are concerned.</P>
<P>     Everything that happens in COMBINATION PLATTER revolves around the
employees at Flushing's Szechuan Inn, a Chinese restaurant with a mixed
staff of native Chinese, American-born Chinese (or "ABCs", as they're
referred to), and Americans.  The largest piece of the plot goes to one
of the waiters, Robert (Jeff Lau), a Hong Kong transplant who's willing
to try just about anything to get his green card, including paying
$25,000 for a citizen (preferably one of Chinese descent, although she
doesn't have to speak the language) to marry him.  Sam (Lester
"Chit-Man" Chan), a waiter possessed of a suave and arrogant
disposition, has a gambling problem.  Benny (Colin Mitchell), a busboy,
is finding it a little odd working in an establishment where so many
people speak a language other than English.  Then there are the regular
customers, including a pair of sports fans who tell "great stories" and
a couple that argue even as he searches for a memorable way to propose
marriage.</P>
<P>     Most movies are designed as methods of escapism, opening windows
on lifestyles and stories that, whether momentous or not, are generally
unfamiliar to the bulk of the audience.  Once in a while, however, a
film manages to capture the essence of a familiar reality, and its
attention to detail can make viewing the commonplace a
highly-entertaining experience.  COMBINATION PLATTER is such a motion
picture.</P>
<P>     Helped immeasurably by Yoshifumi Hosoya's 16 mm camerawork and
filmed in a restaurant owned by the director's family, Tony Chan's
motion picture seems almost like a documentary.  His dialogue is
earthy, his characters have the "feel" of real people, and his comedy
is natural (as opposed to the often-contrived and artificial humor of
most films).  Granted, there aren't any scenes in COMBINATION PLATTER
that will cause audience members to roll in the aisles with laughter,
but the movie's sardonic wit will provoke chuckles aplenty.</P>
<P>     Ever wonder what it's like behind-the-scenes at a restaurant?
COMBINATION PLATTER gives an uncompromisingly accurate view, broadening
its scope beyond the daily grind at the Szechuan Inn to follow one of
the characters, Robert, home.  His quest to find a wife could be (and
has been) the premise for romantic comedies, but Tony Chan handles this
situation much differently than a GREEN CARD.</P>
<P>     COMBINATION PLATTER also attempts to present a different
perspective on the immigrant experience.  By using a uncommon setting
and not dwelling on the potentially-downbeat elements of the situation,
Mr. Chan succeeds at this difficult task.  Despite the pursuit of
immigration officials, the employees at the Szechuan Inn have a
positive outlook on the country they're presently living in.</P>
<P>     One might wonder what could be so fascinating about spending
eighty-odd minutes with the employees of a Chinese restaurant?
Fortunately, it doesn't take long for the script and actors to answer
that question.  COMBINATION PLATTER is light entertainment, a motion
picture "snack" of sorts.  And speaking of food, it might be best to
see this film on a full stomach, lest you may find yourself leaving the
theater for the nearest establishment offering Moo Goo Gai Pan.</P>
