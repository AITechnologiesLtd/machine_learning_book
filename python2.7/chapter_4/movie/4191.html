<PRE>                               GET SHORTY
                       A film review by Ed Powell
                        Copyright 1995 Ed Powell</PRE>
<P>     Take one Miami loansharker (John Travolta), send him to collect
$300,000 from someone who was gone to L.A., and mix him with a horror
movie director (Gene Hackman), an actress from his movies (Rene Russo),
and a bigtime actor (Danny DeVito).  Add several twisty plotlines, and
let insanity ensue.</P>
<P>     GET SHORTY is a tounge-in-cheek look into the world of film making
and organized crime.  While is was a very entertaining and engrossing
film, I couldn't help but be confused with the way that the many
plotlines were intertwined.  It seems as if the writer was trying to
get too creative.  Not that there is anything wrong with creativity,
it's just that the writer could have directed it towards clarifying
fewer plotlines.  Overall, however, I give high marks to the writer and
director for overall story execution.</P>
<P>     Four big names in a film ... I usually take that as a sign that
those names are trying to cover up for a weak story.  The story wasn't
weak, though, and the acting was excellent.  John Travolta is made for
playing a loansharker, Gene Hackman is good in anything, and Rene Russo
and Danny DeVito are excellent actors playing actors.</P>
<P>     The settings were well thought out, the music was well suited for
the action, and the director made fine use of several fancy camera
moves, even if there were a few too many.</P>
<P>     GET SHORTY is a wonderful film, and I wouldn't be surprised if it
gets an Oscar or two.  It seemed a little short, and it ends rather
suddenly, but it is well worth paying to see.</P>
<P>Produced by Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg, and Stacey Sher.
Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld.  An MGM release.</P>
