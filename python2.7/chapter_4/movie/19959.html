<PRE>        Just what is a horror movie?</PRE>
<P>Over the past one hundred years, many movies have been given
the moniker, "horror film," but few have deserved it. They were given
that title mainly due to their subject matter, but a vampire,
werewolf, zombie, ghost, maniac with an ax, demon, or even the Devil
himself does not a horror movie make. There have been many a valiant
effort. Some even managed to truly scare their audience, but they have
sadly fallen short of what a true horror movie is suppose to do. A
true horror movie's objective is not to just frighten you, but to
upset you; to make you feel uneasy as you are watching, and to make
that feeling follow you, even after you have left the theater. It is
not supposed to gross you out with gory make-up effects. It is not
supposed to  amaze you with what can now be put on the screen with
state-of-the-art computer effects. It is not supposed to make you feel
like you have been on a roller coaster after it is all over. A horror
movie is supposed to make you feel like you have been hit in the face
with that roller coaster. </P>
<P>The "politically correct" 90s, where everyone is supposed to
feel happy, and you are not supposed to upset anyone, have not been a
very good time for "Hollywood" horror movies. Not to mention the ones
that are suppose to "rock the boat" and come right out and slap the
audience in the face. So, I was beginning to believe that the 90s were
going to be the first decade since the modern horror movie began (the
1920s)that we were not going to have a true horror movie; a classic in
the genre. But thankfully, I was wrong.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project just did make it with less than six
months left in the decade, but there it is, standing as an example of
what a horror movie should be. Made on a budget of  sixty thousand
dollars, and by a group of unknowns, TBWP, is well on its way to
earning more than one million dollars in only its first month of
release. It is setting box office records and has people standing in
LONG lines; lines that have not been seen since another horror classic
was in theaters, The Exorcist. </P>
<P>The back story is simple enough. In 1994, three student film
makers went into a wooded area of Maryland to make a documentary about
the local legend, the Blair Witch. They never returned. The movie
consists of the footage that they shot and that was supposedly found
one year after their disappearance. What follows is a movie that
succeeds where all other so-called horror movies have failed. It is
nearly a textbook on how to make an effective horror film; on how to
manipulate your audience; on how to take ordinary places and
circumstances and make them terrifying by turning the familiar into
something unfamiliar. In a true horor film, it is not the film maker
that frightens the audience. They can put in "surprises" that make
people jump in their seats, but that is not horror. In a horror film
that is doing its job, it is the audience that is frightening the
audience.          </P>
<P> Since the entire movie was shot with a video camera and a
regular film camera, TBWP. has a "reality based" feel to it. People
are used to seeing that only on television, not at a movie theater.
Then there are only three characters throughout the majority of the
film, so you have a very intimate setting and at times you feel like a
voyeur. Then since this is all "amateur" film making, there is no
blaring soundtrack of intrusive, popular songs. There is also no Dolby
surround sound, so you are forced to pay attention to dialogue. There
are bits of dialogue that you cannot make out, so like the characters
you are watching, you are not quite sure just what is going on in some
spots. All of this works to pull the audience into the movie and
forces them to be a part of it; something modern audiences are not
used to and that adds to the feelings of unease that are already
brewing because this movie is breaking so many rules. Then, this is
not a movie where action scenes are pilled on top of action scenes.
When something exciting is going on, the camera movement is jerky and
disorienting, and you can't always hear what is being said.</P>
<PRE>        The audience anxiety grows. </PRE>
<P>Then as if to add a final insult, there are no breathtaking,
wowie- zowie special effects. Just trees and raw human emotion. You
watch as the three film makers become more lost and frightened and you
are forced to observe their slow decent into near madness. A situation
that no one is comfortable with. And because you already know that
these people never make it out of those woods, you begin to wonder
just what IS going to happen to them? What horrible fate awaits them?
You find yourself rooting for them, even though you know that they are
doomed. Now the movie-going experience is completely out of whack.
Characters in a horror movie that you really like and care about? What
it all adds up to is that without even noticing it, you have become
involved. You are now a participant, be it willing or unwilling. There
is now a sort of audience participation going on and that is the key
element in any successful horror movie; or any other movie for that
matter. By this time, the audience is not really sure what is going to
happen next. Some are truly scared because of that very fact; they
don't know. To its credit, TBWP is not predictable. Some are mad
because they ARE scared and not used to that feeling in a 1990s horror
movie; others are mad because this movie is breaking all the rules.
Where is all the blood? Where is all the slam-bam action? Where are
all the bodies? How dare they. Others are just praying that this whole
damn thing will be explained to them at the end. But ALL are riveted
to their seats because no one knows where all this is leading.</P>
<P>We are all exactly where the movie wants us to be; off
balance, tense, and uneasy. We have been manipulated and placed in a
situation that many don't want to be in. Some are not even sure how
they got there. Then the final trap is sprung and we watch as the
final fate of the three characters that we have lived with for the
past hour and a half unfolds. Not wishing to give anything away, let's
just say that it is an ending that will be written about and discussed
in film classes for years to come. But the end credits roll, the house
lights come up, and the ordeal is over.</P>
<PRE>If only it was that simple.</PRE>
<P>The effects of a true horror film last long after the credits
have faded from the screen. The images stay with you, they make you
take those quick glances over your shoulder as you make your way to
your car. Then if you go get something to eat afterwards, what you
have just seen is all that you can talk about. On the drive home, it
is all you can think about. Then when you are "safe" at home and in
your bed and the lights go out, you try not to think about what you
have just witnessed anymore. But it is no use. All the uneasy feelings
refuse to go away. And now that you are in darkness, they are
magnified. You are no longer in the relative safety of a crowed movie
theater. You are alone, in a state of undress, and laying there
wondering if there is something lurking out there in the dark that is
surrounding you. Just like the three film makers you had just seen had
wondered when they put their lanterns out. You try to tell yourself
that conventional wisdom is right, and that there is nothing in the
dark but the darkness. But you can't shake the feeling that
conventional wisdom just might be wrong. After all, it was wrong in
the case of the three young people in The Blair Witch Project. But
that was only a movie. Or was it?</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project gets a very much deserved **** and
will join films like Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist,
and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a true horror film.</P>
