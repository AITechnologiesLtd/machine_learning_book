<P>Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) ** (out of four)</P>
<PRE>Directed by John Woo 
Written by Robert Towne </PRE>
<P>Starring Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, Thandie Newton,
Ving Rhames, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Roxburgh,
William R. Mapother, and Anthony Hopkins. </P>
<P>In 1996, Mission: Impossible confused the heck out of
me. A movie way too complex for its own good, only the
heart-poundingly superb action sequences by director
Brian De Palma made it worth watching and remembering.
When I heard that John Woo would direct the inevitable
sequel, I was somewhat excited - it's pretty much one
great director replacing another. But my primary
concern with Mission: Impossible 2 was that the script
would once again outwit the visuals and when Robert
Towne (who co-wrote the first one) signed onto the
project as screenwriter, my worries failed to go away.
You see, Towne also wrote the script for Chinatown,
without a doubt an excellent movie, but one even more
confusing than M:I. To me, Chinatown is the epitome of
confusion; one of those movies you have to see
multiple times to understand the basic plot. The night
before M:I 2 opened, I prayed I wouldn't have to watch
a movie that felt like solving a Rubik's cube. </P>
<P>To my surprise and chagrin, it turns out that in order
to dumb down a plot, suspense, excitement, and twists
all have to be sacrificed. The movie spends so much
time trying to explain and re-explain the rudimentary
premise that for the first hour and a half, mainly all
there is on screen is lots and lots of talking. A lot
of dialogue can, if executed correctly, make a film
work but if you're expecting a loud, action packed
summer popcorn flick and you get a lot of bland
conversations - it is very difficult to sit through.
Unlike the original Mission: Impossible that
forcefully grabs your attention with a mission gone
fatally awry, there is nothing in the sequel to get
the audience pumped and excited for the final act. To
start off the film, there is a plane crash and then
some beautiful shots of daredevil spy Ethan Hunt (Tom
Cruise) climbing a massive rock without a helmet,
ropes, or even a pair of gloves. But both of these
scenes are lacking; the brief incident involving a
plane crash is far from interesting and the rock
climbing scene is held back by a ridiculous and
distracting folk song playing somewhere in the
background. </P>
<P>Hunt, conveniently cured from all of the tragic events
that happened in his past, is assigned a new mission
by his mentor (a cameo appearance by Anthony Hopkins).
It turns out that another spy, Sean Ambrose (Dougray
Scott), who occasionally substituted for Hunt to
complete especially dangerous missions, has turned bad
stealing a cell destroying virus called Chimera from a
Russian Scientist. It is Hunt's job to find out what
Ambrose is up to and who his business partners are.
Why does this seemingly routine stand out from others
(or why is this movie-worthy material)? Well there is
a girl involved. Hunt is ordered to use the angelic
and mysterious thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), an
ex-girlfriend of Ambrose, to get closer to his arch
nemesis. The catch is that, in the process, Hunt
almost hypnotically falls for her beauty and really
never wants to let her go. M:I 2 is much more romantic
than its predecessor when it asks the question - which
guy is going to get the girl. The attractive Newton
outperforms Hollywood Hot Shot Tom Cruise and is
definitely the best part of this movie. Her character
contains a certain amount of power that you would
never find a female character hold in, say, a James
Bond movie and change like this is great to see. But
when the plot starts heading into the category of
predictable romance story, I knew that this Mission
Impossible would not have the paranoia and
double-crossing that the original one had. </P>
<P>When something finally happens (during the last half
an hour of the movie), it seems particularly out of
place from the mild story that started the movie. 
John Woo, whose unique style of choreographed battle
scenes reached its zenith in Face Off, just does not
have control over the film. He makes this movie way
too serious, when it really should have been a guilty
pleasure. For example, instead of Hunt just hitting a
guard in the neck and dragging them into an alleyway,
he does a cheesy Matrix-style back flip/ jump kick in
the air first. After Hunt does this ten times in a
row, it is no longer absorbing, just annoying. Another
aggravation in this movie was the excessive use of a
character wearing a mask and looking like another
character in order to fool everyone except,
unfortunately, the audience. </P>
<P>The good news is that Towne made the movie
comprehensible. The bad news is that the movie is just
not interesting enough to recommend. A dull first and
second act and an unsuccessfully exaggerated boost of
energy in the third act, makes Mission: Impossible 2
the kind of movie that tries too hard to be what is
should never have even thought of. </P>
