<PRE>                            WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     You know right from the start that WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING isn't going
to be the uplifting tale that you might have thought it would be, as it
cuts quickly from a bizarre underwater dream to a scene in which the main
character, Camille (Pascale Bussières), discovers her dog has died.</P>
<P>     Patricia Rozema's odd melodrama tells Camille's story.  A Calvinist
professor at a Christian college, she is on the fast track to a position
as co-Chaplain of the university along with her conservative boyfriend
Martin (Henry Czerny).  Suddenly, circus performance artist Petra (Rachael
Crawford) comes into her life, and everything changes.  Petra is almost
obsessively infatuated with Camille, and the once-traditionalist Camille
very quickly finds herself developing an inexplicable attraction for
Petra.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, this obsession and inexplicability together create a
situation which is difficult to empathize with, largely because Camille's
motivation is a complete mystery to us.  The movie is thankfully
well-constructed technically, with nicely-crafted cinematography, tight
editing, and an interesting variety of settings and costumes.  Of course,
this can't overcome a very weak story, but it does give the film a
worthwhile aspect to balance the plot.</P>
<P>     By the end of WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING, we're not really sure if
Camille's metamorphosis was a spur of the moment infatuation or if she
really harbored these emotions deep inside.  The producers are obviously
hoping you'll go for the latter, but I don't think we'll ever know.</P>
