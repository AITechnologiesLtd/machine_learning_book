<P>In the motion picture industry it's not easy to win an Academy Award for your
first effort on screen, especially if you hapen to be the film's director but
that's exactly what happened to Robert Redford as his emotional and
psychological drama 'Ordinary People' walked away with additional Oscars for
Best Supporting Actor (Timothy Hutton), Best Screenplay Adaptation (Alvin
Sargent based on Judith Guest's novel) and the most distinguished prize, Best
Picture of 1980.</P>
<P>The film starts off simple, almost non-effective and tells the story of an
upper class family whose struggle to stay together is constantly tested after
the eldest son dies at sea in a boating accident.  Donald Sutherland and Mary
Tyler Moore portray the parents and Timothy Hutton is their only remaining
son who was on the boat with his elder brother who died.  Hutton's character
develops a mind bending trauma based on self created guilt and a confusion of
conscience and seeks help from a psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) for his problems.</P>
<P>As 'Ordinary People' progresses there is a steady deterioration of the
relationship between Moore and Hutton as their mother and son relationship
takes a turn for the worst every time they are forced to be close together as
one example points out when the family is visiting other relatives for a
gathering and Hutton stands with his arms folded in front of his body when
near his mother as she feels uncomfortable about having a picture taken with
her son because deep down, there is unjust resentment towards him for the
accident previously mentioned.</P>
<P>'Ordinary People' becomes a fascinating and grand character study each minute
more its on screen and concludes with what is a debatable ending of whether
or not the characters involved can truly get on with their lives in an
'ordinary' fashion.  One of the truly stunning and deeply moving films of the
1980's.  </P>
