<PRE>The Fine Art of Getting Ahead
Sleepy Hollow</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Tim Burton's films are oft anticipated for his boldly off-center and usually
dark art direction. "Sleepy Hollow" is no exception. The warm colors have
bled from the footage leaving the flesh stark, cold and clammy, and the
darks -- soot black. Burton also enjoys painting a "small world" set with
which to stage his sideways stories. Frequently, these worlds are neither
live action looking nor quite animated. I find them cartoony, claustrophobic
and distracting, but I'm probably one of only a handful; others seem to
enjoy them.</P>
<P>Gadgetry, on the other hand, Burton excels in -- gadgetry and freakish
characters. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) wields coroner's tool that look as
if they were designed for handicapped piranhas. And Burton's Headless
Horseman is simply magnificent; it's the heart and soul (though not brains)
that keeps this "Sleepy Hollow" charging mightily through the foggy twisted
forest. This powerful black torso with limbs spinning sword and hatchet from
atop a pounding steed is as splendid as a bolt of lightening from the
heavens.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, sleepy and hollow all too appropriately describe the first
half of the production (prior to any significant appearance of the
horseman). Wrought with exposition and an elusively wry sense of humor
giving even the artfully apt Depp a larger foe to over come than the one of
high shoulders; the horseman charges on, breathing life (from it's severed
esophagus) into this paling production.</P>
