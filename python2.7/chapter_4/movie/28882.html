<PRE>BURNT MONEY (PLATA QUEMADA) * </PRE>
<P>2000 - Argentina 
Director: Marcelo Piñeyro 
Starring: Eduardo Noriega, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Pablo Echarri, Leticia Brédice </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Frankie Paiva </PRE>
<P>Burnt Money is the perfect festival film. It will show once or twice, and 
then no one, thankfully, will ever have to hear from it again. This film from 
the Seattle International Film Festival 2001's Emerging Masters series is 
easily one of the year's worst. Billed as a gay `Bonnie and Clyde', this 
gritty film from director Marcelo Piñeyro has its only highlight in a 
well-designed title sequence. </P>
<P>Two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader, whose 
plan they screwed up, angry. This causes the gang leader to send his boys out 
to get the gay guys, one of whom may not actually be gay. Hiding out in a 
prostitute's apartment, the two men must fight off police and gang members in 
a very long showdown for the movie's conclusion. If caught, they risk losing 
all the money, and their love. As an added emotional bonus, one of the gay 
men is dying. </P>
<P>Or something like that. Everything that happens is so quick and confusing I 
was completely lost. Clarity isn't exactly this movie's striving virtue, so 
it was a little hard to pick up. Not much could have really happened though. 
The main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and 
heterosexual sex, graphic drug use, extreme violence, and strong language. 
Lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when there's a reason, but 
there's no purpose to anything in this film. Most of the sex and violence 
scenes come off as silly, while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous 
and depressing. It appears Piñeyro (who co-wrote with Marcelo Figueras, from 
a novel by Ricardo Piglia) purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for 
his own amusement. He makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible, makes 
them snort cocaine, gives them guns and condoms, and lets them go. </P>
<P>Burnt Money is pointless. The performances are bad. It tries to thrill and 
shock, but only causes boredom. God forbid it will ever get a distributor. 
Another disappointing film from this year's so-called Emerging Masters 
series. Pass on by. </P>
