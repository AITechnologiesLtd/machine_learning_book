<P>The Disney Industrial Complex and Atlantis: The Lost Empire
A feature story by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</P>
<P>Say what you will, but the Disney juggernaut is a sight to behold. 
Recently, filmcritic.com sat down with a few of the biggest names in
Disney, to discuss its big 2001 summer release (Atlantis) and the future
of animation as we know it.</P>
<P>We talked with Thomas Schumacher, the head of Disney Animation, who
discussed the main elements for creating a financially successful
animated feature, as well as with Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale,
directors of Atlantis, to discuss the process of creating an animated
feature through CGI and traditional cell animation.</P>
<P>Thomas Schumacher -- Head of Disney Animation</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: Does Atlantis mark a departure from the Broadway
musical-style of Disney's past?</P>
<P>Schumacher: Disney actually produces an entire canon of musicals as
first envisioned by Walt Disney -- the Broadway musical style, the film
musical style, the pop musical style such as Tarzan -- and with
Atlantis, the film represents the first time we didn't use music or
songs for character illuminating or storytelling.  Looking forward
though, Lilo and Stitch [Disney's big 2002 release] uses six Elvis songs
-- original tracks used for storytelling purposes -- which is called in
the business "needle drop music" -- songs which people are familiar
with.  That film represents the first time Disney is using that type of
known music in one of its animation features.  Phil Collins is working
on another animated feature for Disney as well.  Even John Resnick from
the Goo Goo Dolls is contributing a song to the upcoming animation
feature Treasure Plant -- a retelling of Treasure Island set in outer
space, equipped with Long John Silver and his cyborg, shape-changing
parrot.  All of these projects represent Disney's continued support of
various music styles incorporated in its feature animation pieces.</P>
<P>Was there a concern about the PG rating of Atlantis?</P>
<P>No because the last summer's Dinosaur was PG, and if Atlantis could do
the sort of business that movie did [$140 million domestic and the
number one U.S. animated movie in Japan of all time], I would be very
happy.  The market varies all the time and I also believe that if Lion
King came out today, it would have a PG rating as well.  I am not
nervous at all.</P>
<P>That said, there has always been a history of controversy in Disney
animation features.  There was a particular sequence in Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs that had to be cut due the reactions of the audience. 
The dramatic elements of the characters always have been a trademark of
films produced by Walt Disney all the way up to the current animation
features of today.</P>
<P>How will Atlantis -- which is mainly being viewed as another big Disney
summer movie -- be positioned to stand out among the big summer releases
of 2001?</P>
<P>Atlantis does fit into "The Disney Brand."  It does represent the type
of film Walt would have made.  Atlantis is being positioned as an
"action film" and its trailers will be seen with such films as Pearl
Harbor.  These trailers will give the audience the clear impression that
you are not watching another Beauty and the Beast.  It's a kids' film as
well as a film that will fill the seats with adults during the nighttime
screenings.  Given that, many different pockets of animation lovers will
be drawn to the film.</P>
<P>Generally, are Disney's animation features more financially successful
than its live-action movies?</P>
<P>2/3 of an animation feature's business is done internationally.  During
the heyday of home video, for every $10 million of domestic box office
revenue for a Disney animated feature, you would expect to sell a
million videos.  That trend started to dip when every household had 50
to 70 videos in their libraries.  But with the advent of DVD, that trend
is starting to pick up again.  The DVD of Atlantis has already been laid
out with all kinds of different supplement materials.  Animation films
also make a sizable amount of money from merchandising.</P>
<P>Has the Happy Meal deal already been set up?</P>
<P>Yep, the McDonald's promotion is always very successful because it
elevates their brand with the association with all different Disney
characters -- including the characters of Atlantis.</P>
<P>What other projects are generated from a single Disney animation
feature?</P>
<P>Generally, live action features do not the have the life spans that
animation features are able to produce.  For example, Lion King had the
original movie, the Timon and Pumbaa cartoon show, Lion King II: Simba's
Pride, Lion King III (in production), and ultimately a re-release. 
Also, the Broadway version of Lion King was the most successful
production of the decade.</P>
<P>A new IMAX version of Beauty and Beast -- with added footage -- is
scheduled for release next year.  The direct-to-video sequel Lady and
The Tramp II will possibly generate the largest video sales of the year
for Disney.  Also, a weekly cartoon show derived from Atlantis is in the
works as well.</P>
<P>Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise -- Directors of Atlantis</P>
<P>How do you two share the directorial duties of an animation feature?</P>
<P>Wise: Animation is mainly a strong collaborative medium.  Gary and I
were fortunate to work with many talented artists during the making of
Atlantis.  Our relationship on the movie is mainly based on
collaboration -- the story, design and look, the editing of the movie. 
The only time we split up was during the full production mode of the
movie.  I mainly worked with the animators and the clean-up artists and
Gary would work with layout and special effects.  It's a very informal
division.</P>
<P>Trousdale: During the screenings of the dailies, if Kirk sees some
special effects he doesn't like or I see some animation I don't like,
we're pretty vocal: "What the hell were you thinking?"</P>
<P>Wise: It's understood, though, that not one area of the film is one
person's own turf.  Some days Gary would work with the animators and I
would work with the special effects guys.  It's a very big give and
take.</P>
<P>Trousdale: It's kind of an experimental division.  When we worked on
Beauty and the Beast, it just kind of worked, so we've used it ever
since.</P>
<P>What part of animation is the most challenging when making a feature
length movie?</P>
<P>Wise: The longest process is mainly the story development and
pre-production.  Pre-visualing the entire story on storyboards.</P>
<P>Trousdale: It's an ongoing process when we are working on the story.  We
don't work with a script like a live-action movie but with a basic
script outline.  We give those to our animators.  The script pages may
say something like, "The submarine is attacked by a huge sea creature." 
We've got six minutes to do this and you mainly rely on your story
artists to visually create that scene.</P>
<P>Wise: The story artists have tons of freedom to create action, dialogue,
and every facet of the script's outline.  The storyboard artist's
effects are what shape the story and its characters.  Sometimes, the
storyboard artist's suggestion can change the makeup of a certain
character.  In the case of Moliere [a character of Atlantis], as
scripted, he was a very stuffy, professorial guy -- a French
mineralogist who was a connoisseur of dirt.  One of story artists took
this original concept and juiced up the character into this horrible
little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with
extending eyeballs.  We were so enthralled with the new look that we
changed to script to fit the new character.</P>
<P>What other characters in Atlantis didn't make the final cut?</P>
<P>Wise: In the early drafts of the story, Preston Whitmore had a nephew --
sort of like a Miles Crane character -- who was always getting into
trouble on the expedition.  We decided to cut him because the story was
more about Milo and his 'odd-man out' scenario and the nephew character
ended up being too distracting from that key element of the story.</P>
<P>Milo, at one point, had a pet rat that lived in his pocket.  But as the
story progressed, we felt it was too familiar, like we've been down that
road before -- the animal sidekick that would mimic Milo's actions.  The
main reason for discarding that character was because you would have
expected it from a Disney story.  We want the story to be about Milo --
his story and his relationship with the characters -- instead of some
cute sidekicks.</P>
<P>How did the Atlantian language that was used throughout the film
develop?</P>
<P>Wise: It was inspired mainly by other works of fantasy we like.  We are
big fans of the Star Wars series and Star Trek series -- and even Lord
of the Rings.  Any scenario where an alien culture is so well
thought-out with history and customs and language -- Atlantis present
the unique opportunity to create a similar vein as seen in previous
fantasy pieces.</P>
<P>Trousdale: The issue of the language came up when we talked to linguist
Mark Okerran -- we wanted something like a Tower of Babel kind of
language -- a language which birthed many other languages.</P>
<P>Mark used a combination of dead languages from extinct California-based
tribes, Hebrew, Chinese, and a pinch of Latin for the final product of
the Atlantian language.</P>
<P>Wise: Mark was like the real-life version of Milo Thatch.</P>
<P>Was the production time lessened by using CGI (computer generated
images) components in the film versus the traditional cell animation
techniques?</P>
<P>Trousdale: It's not any easier. It's not any shorter.  It's not any
cheaper.</P>
<P>Wise: Certain sequences like the leviathan sequence would have taken ten
years to draw in traditional cell-based animation.  As you get more and
more tools for placing images on the screen, your appetite grows and you
start imaging things like, "Hey, we could build a mile-long giant
lobster with these things."</P>
<P>Trousdale: The fact is, Kirk and I come from an era before the inclusion
of CGI animation in a feature.  We always tell the guys that build the
CGI stuff, "Don't get too cocky because we could always do this
traditionally."  We always have a plan B up our sleeves.</P>
