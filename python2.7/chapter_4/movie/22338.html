<PRE>Faith or Miracle?
The Third Miracle</PRE>
<PRE> By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A little slow in getting started, "Third Miracle" builds well, Ed Harris
filling the screen with brilliant acting.</P>
<P>Tip-toeing along some of the same lines as "Stigmata," this film sheds a
kinder light on Catholics and dwells more on contemplation than graphics. Ed
plays a doubting Thomas priest and postulator (spiritual detective) who is
sent to investigate the miracle of a crying statue and verify a woman
(Barbara Sukowa) who abandoned her daughter (Anne Heche) as a genuine
American saint. But the film is really about Ed's internal struggle with
doubt.</P>
<P>The press kit provides this appropriately profound quote from charismatic
genius Albert Einstein, "There are only two ways to live your life. One is
as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a
miracle."</P>
<PRE>A very strong "B+."</PRE>
