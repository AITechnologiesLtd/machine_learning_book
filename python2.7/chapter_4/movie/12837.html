<P>This children's picture melds the comedic spirit of the original HOME
ALONE (7.5/10) picture, with the style and darkness of the ADDAMS
FAMILY movies.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two unique brothers inherit a historically rich mansion from their
dying father. After valuing the house at over a million dollars, they
decide to hold an auction at which all interested parties could bid.
Unfortunately for them, there is one feisty little mouse in the house
that does not want to let anyone rest in peace. Mayhem ensues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Mostly enjoyable but redundant picture that pits two brothers against
the dynamic smarts of a two-inch mouse. This movie had many funny
moments, as well as many not-so-funny ones. Kids under ten should enjoy
this picture whole-heartedly, while all others might meander between
the "hit" and "miss" classifications. I guess it all depends on how
interested you are in seeing the hundreds of different ways that a tiny
mouse could frustrate two grown men. I personally was never really
bored during the entire picture, so I guess that's a pretty good sign.</P>
<P>Also, one of my favourite actors, Christopher Walken, makes an
incredible cameo as the "exterminator from hell" who owns every single
device known to man to deal with this defiant rodent. His fate is a
pretty slick sequence to behold. Other than that, not too many scenes
stick out in my mind, but the style of the picture is very cool and
Coen-esque. It's also very dark and colorless, unlike a lot of other
children's movies. This is an aspect that I embrace in pictures, but
you might not.</P>
<P>The actors are all fine in their roles, while the mouse also pulls off
an overall authentic vibe throughout the entire movie. All in all, I
guess that if you're in the mood to laugh at some morons getting
tricked by a cute mouse, this is your nacho plate for the night. If
not, skip this puppy and rent THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (8/10) for
some real kid's dark, spooky fun.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Christopher Walken's real name is Ronald Walken (I wonder why he
changed it? :)). He was born in Queens, New York, in 1943, and has been
married to the same woman since 1969, Georgianne Walken. He won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in 1978's DEER HUNTER (7.5/10). 
Ernie (Nathan Lane) greets Maury (Ernie Sabella) at the auction by
saying "Hakuna Matada", a reference to Lane and Sabella's roles in the
animated children's feature, THE LION KING (7.5/10).
Gore Verbinski was a TV commercial director before hitting the
feature-film realm. He directed the first "Budweiser Frogs" commercial.
Nathan Lane's real name is Joe Lane. He was born in New Jersey in 1956.
Lee Evans was born in Avonmouth, England.<HR>Visit JoBlo's Movie Reviews
