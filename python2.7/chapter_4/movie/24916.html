<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Culture clash, you aren't human if you haven't experienced it. For members of 
the Khan family it's the regular routine. Dad George, (Puri) believes that 
even though his children are of mixed Pakistani and English descent, that 
they will follow every rule and traditional custom as if they were living in 
Pakistan. This is very hard to enforce, because it's the early 1970s, his 
family lives in a Manchester suburb, and six of his seven children want 
little to do with him or Pakistan. Maneer Khan is the son George wishes the 
other five boys were. A traditional Muslim, he sees his fathers ways as a 
sanctuary from pop culture. While not as religious as Maneer, Abdul Khan is 
another good son. He's very prim, always showing up in a suit, and says very 
little. Saleem Khan is an aspiring sculptor who tricks his dad into thinking 
he's going to college to become an engineer. Tariq Kahn is the rebellious 
badboy who is dating the dimwitted girl next door and frequently attends the 
forbidden discos. Sajid Khan is the youngest Khan who just got circumcised, 
and always wears a parka no matter what the weather is like. Meenah Khan, the 
only girl in the family, and she loves to play soccer on the streets. 
Finally, their mother Ella Khan (Bassett) loves her husband, but also wants 
the children to have lives of their own. There is actually one more Khan 
named Nazir. George arranged a traditional Pakistani marriage for the boy 
(where both the bride and the groom have not met until the ceremony takes 
place) who runs from the altar and disgraces the family. George forces the 
family to refer to Nazir as "dead."</P>
<P>This unique bunch could produce a bounty of humor, and at times it does. A 
lot of this movie is very, very funny. However, it is also very, very sad. 
George is so set in Pakistani ways that he frequently beats his wife and 
children when they disobey him or Pakistan. He spouts off insults, calling 
them illegitimate children, female dogs, etc. In today's times he would get 
sent to jail instantly. Georges actions detract from the film because editing 
is not this movie's greatest marvel. A scene of George continuously beating 
his wife is put in between two funny scenes involving the sexual preference 
of Nazir. One thing I absolutely will not forget about this movie though, are 
the two brides George tries to set Abdul and Tariq up with late in the film. 
There is no real way to describe them, they have no actual lines, but they 
alone are worth the price of admission. Performances are very good in this 
movie. Om Puri and Linda Bassett are effective in both the dramatic and 
comedic sequences. All the Khan children are excellent as well. Bit players 
also make up a large part of the movie. A young woman in love with Saleem, an 
anxious dalmation, and a little boy who is Sajids friend are all memorable. 
If you listen very closely to the last few lines of the movie, I bet you'll 
be rolling in the aisles. While the film tries to leave you with a humorous 
intention, that still doesn't overshadow the domestic abuse subplot. The 
movie got too disjointed between the two for my tastes, and I left the 
theater thinking the movie was just OK. My opinion later changed to a 
slightly more positive one, but it's still only enough to mildly recommend 
this movie. So is this, "A comedy with attitude from a house with no 
latitude?" The film's tagline promises us that, but it's far from the truth. 
Despite great performances from a relatively unknown cast, and some very 
funny material, East Is East is much better off as the comedy the posters 
promote, not the drama that lies beneath.</P>
