<P>     Sturdy filmmaker Fred Schepisi follows up his delightful
MR. BASEBALL with the equally enjoyable SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION.
Though so-so as social commentary, this is cunning comedy when it
works.  Which is most of the time.</P>
<P>     SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is based on the award-winning stage
play, which, in turn, is based on the real-life story of a young man
who conned several members of New York City's "upper echelon" by posing
as the son of a famous actor.</P>
<P>     The film opens on Flan and Ouisa Kittredge (Sutherland and
Channing), a posh Fifth Avenue couple with an incredible story to tell
(via flashback).  The night before, a wounded young black man, Paul
(Smith), arrives at their door.  He claims to know their children at
Harvard. He also claims to be the son of Sidney Poiter (!).</P>
<P>     To the insulated couple, he certainly looks and sounds the part.
He says he's in town to make a film of "Cats."  He say he's in charge
of hiring extras.  And he says he was mugged and his thesis--on
CATCHER IN THE RYE as a hate doctrine (!)--was stolen.</P>
<P>     Soon, Paul's poise and charm has his hosts hanging on his every
word.  And, after serving them up a spectacular meal, the couple
insists that he stay the night.  Which leads to disaster on the
morning-after.  Paul is kicked out, the flashback ends, and the
Kittredges become the talk of the town....</P>
<P>     The first 45 minutes of SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is brash,
unpredictable fun.  The dialogue is a stitch, the pace is lively, and
the gullibility of Fran and Ouisa radiates like sunshine.  Watching
Paul worm his way into the controlled lives of the Kittredges is
classic comedy.  But it ends when the flashback does.</P>
<P>     Once the con is gone, the film deflates a bit.  The plot becomes
more conventionally paced as everyone struggles to understand the hows
and whys of what happened to them.  Comedy takes a breather as social
commentary rears its ugly head.  The whole things goes on
twenty minutes too long and wraps with an embarrassingly literal
finale.</P>
<P>     SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION strives for the subtlety of Woody Allen.
But even with all the high-brow humor, this is really just pop comedy
with class.</P>
<P>     That said, there's a ton to enjoy in this film.  Great gags, great
lines, and a cast that's perfect.  Sutherland is droll fun, playing
comedy for the first time in who knows when.  Channing is wide-eyed and
wide-open and the real anchor of the film.  She's Oscar-nomination
good, even when saddled with an awful closing speech.</P>
<P>     Then there's Smith.  The young actor/rapper continues his upward
spiral as a rising talent.  He shows a nice range of emotions in the
film's most dimensional role.  And watch the supporting cast for a
surprise turn from former John Hughes habit Anthony Michael Hall.</P>
<P>     Though seemingly a "light" comedy, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION does
a boast a strong sexual content that may surprise some viewers.  But,
after all, it *is* New York.  -:)</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:     SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is two-thirds comedy and
                 one-third commentary.  The former is much funnier than
                 the languid latter in this engaging story about a young
                 con man who wormed his way into the life of a posh New
                 York City couple.</PRE>
