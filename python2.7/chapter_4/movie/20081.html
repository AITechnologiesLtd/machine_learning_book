<P>Waitasec. Backup to the English thing. My femme friends tell me that
should read "A well dressed cuddly bunny cute Englishman . . ." 'cuz
lightning has struck for the second time this summer; Hugh Grant stars
in a great date movie. Here's the secret to Grant -- he's a
non-threatening cuddly bunny, a perfect everyman in a strange land;
whether it's in the Hollywood star system or the generic Mafia
stereotype it makes no difference. He makes men and women laugh. He
makes us all happy when he lands the woman he wants. Warm fuzzies all
around in most of his flicks; simply great date material.</P>
<P>This time out, Grant is Michael Felgate, an auctioneer at the New York
based Cromwell's Auction House. He is madly in love with a school
teacher Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and, after three months, is ready to
propose marriage. This comes early in the movie -- she's going to say
"no", but that's just a comic coda to a scene side splitting enough
that, in any other "ordinary" dateflick, it would be enough to make you
happy you spent the cash on tickets. Luckily, there's a lot more, and a
lot more funny stuff, coming.</P>
<P>Trying to figure out this unpleasant turn of events, Michael tracks down
Gina's father Frank Vitale (James Caan), owner of an Italian restaurant
called "The La Trattoria". The sight of actor Joseph Vitterelli, you'll
know him when you see him, sitting at the bar clues us in to the fact
that Michael has never seen a Godfather-style movie in his life. He is
not ignorant of The Mob, and his protestations that they will never
affect his love or his life to be with Gina are, of course, the
cinematic equivalent of spitting in the wind. Which leaves a standard
stranger in a strange land premise, always good for a story and, in this
case, perfect for a Hugh Grant romantic comedy.</P>
<P>The plot points include money laundering, murder, an FBI sting and the
inevitable bloodbath. Each sets up a series of gags that are
increasingly funny. I don't have to tell you about Grant trying to fake
the accent when he's passed off as a mobster from Kansas City -- it's in
the teevee commercial. The strength of this flick is that, even when you
know the joke from the advertising, there's still plenty left in the
flick that tops what you know. Like I wrote, a motherlode.</P>
<P>Unlike the earlier Mob spoof Analyze This, Mickey Blue Eyes is virtually
profanity free. Yes, the Italian Mob stereotype gets shredded for comedy
punchlines, making Cranky wonder where the Italian-American
Anti-Defamation League is, but Grant allows Adam Scheinmand and Robert
Kuhn's screenplay to lob a couple of grenades towards the English as
well. You'll know it when you see it.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mickey Blue Eyes, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$7.50</PRE>
<P>Damn fine fun.
