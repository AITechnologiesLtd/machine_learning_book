<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Who knew? Who knew that there was a brain beneath the thick skull of Wesley
Snipes, able to not only produce, but to choreograph? And good God can he
choreograph a fight scene. I haven't seen such elaborate ones since the John
Woo cult action Hard-Boiled (which, sadly, you must experience subtitles in
order to enjoy). I came into the lobby of the theatre with 0 expectation,
and, after being cajoled and told how great it was by one of the workers
(talk to them, people, they're good conversation), figured it might not be
so bad.</P>
<PRE>He understated it.</PRE>
<P>The film, based on a Marvel comic book, is about a half human, half vampire
(his mother was attacked while in labor) who psychotic evil vampire Stephen
Dorff (did he get the role in the Ray Ban commercial after the role in Blade
or visa-versa?) needs in order to become a vampire god. Check this guy out,
he looks psychotic off the bat.</P>
<P>It grabs you in the opening credits, showing a particularly graphic picture
of an innocent man taken into a nightclub full of vampires dancing to techno
music, then cascading into an excellent fight scene in which Blade
dispatches most all of them. If you have a hard stomach, it's a treat and
worth it.</P>
<P>It's not without its bad points. Like most action movies, it still needs
lines that any one of us would ever say in our right minds, characters we
can attach to, and victims we care about. But, wait a sec, this is a
hard-core action flick we're talking about. To hell with having a brain… it
was FUN!</P>
