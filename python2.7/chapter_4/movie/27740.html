_Recess:_School's_Out_ (G) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        At one point in this film, an adult character says something
along the lines of, "Even grown-ups know the value of recess." 
Similarly, the appeal of _Recess:_School's_Out_, a big-screen extension
of the popular TV cartoon series, won't be lost on the older viewers in
the audience.  Make no mistake--this is a film made for the kiddies, and
it's the young 'uns who will take the most from the animated antics.  But
there's enough likable qualities displayed here to keep the parents
interested though not entirely bowled over.</P>
<P>        Part of the problem is the film's no-frills animation style, that
makes the film look exactly like what it is: a big-screen blowup of a
Saturday morning cartoon.  Even the _Rugrats_ films exhibited some
greater ambition with its visuals, however slight.  Here, all we get are
a couple of too-obviously computer-generated overhead shots, one for the
very beginning, and one for the very end.  Making matters worse is the
fact that the CG shots hardly feel of a piece with the traditionally
drawn bulk of the film.</P>
<P>        This complaint is of little consequence to the target audience,
who will certainly eat up this amusing kids' fantasy.  As the title
suggests, school is out, and mischievous T.J. Detweiler (voiced by Andy
Lawrence) is looking forward to a summer of fun with friends Gus
(Courtland Mead), Gretchen (Ashley Johnson), Vince (Rickey D'Shon
Collins), Mikey (Jason Davis), and Spinelli (Pamela Segall).  However,
that doesn't appear it will be the case, for he is the only one of the
gang not going to a special camp for the summer.  But when he stumbles
upon an evil plot involving what appears to be a large laser cannon (!)
being cooked up within the closed walls of Third Street Elementary, T.J.
must break out his friends to set things right.</P>
<P>        The kid-aimed story is interesting and fast-paced enough to keep
the adults somewhat amused, but there are also touches in
_Recess:_School's_Out_ blatantly designed to  engage the adults: an
extended flashback to the late-'60s-set early careers of Third Street
Principal Prickly (Dabney Coleman) and the main bad guy, a former
secretary of education (James Woods); and an especially effective running
gag involving Mikey's impressively developed singing voice (provided by
Robert Goulet).  But when it all comes down to it, the comedic fights
(some involving ninjas) and slapsticky chases that make up most of
_Recess:_School's_Out_ were meant for viewers that are in the same age
range as the main characters, and unless you have kids, there's nothing
here that's compelling enough to merit buying a ticket.</P>
