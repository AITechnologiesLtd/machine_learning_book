<P>     As a made-for-HBO television series based on a defunct 1950s comic 
book, TALES FROM THE CRYPT has had its share of witty, clever, and 
entertaining episodes.  True, the segments invariably tend towards the 
macabre, but what else would you expect from something with that sort of 
title?  Now, with DEMON KNIGHT, TALES FROM THE CRYPT makes the jump to 
the big screen (not that this has stopped its pay TV run).  For those 
that don't subscribe to HBO, this may be their first exposure to the 
Crypt Keeper and his gallery of grotesque stories.  Frankly, it's a 
terrible introduction.  </P>
<P>     Horror movies are supposed to be scary--or, at the very least, a 
little shocking.  Unfortunately, the only frightening thing about DEMON 
KNIGHT is that Universal chose to release it.  This film is bad.  It's 
not funny, it's not intelligent, and it lacks just about every quality 
that makes the occasional episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT worth sitting 
through.  </P>
<P>     There isn't much of a plot.  At the outset, we're introduced to 
Brayker (William Sadler), a man on the run.  Later, it's revealed that 
he's some sort of long-lived warrior who fights against the "demons in 
the darkness", and that his pursuer, an enigmatic entity known only as 
"the Collector" (Billy Zane), is an agent of evil.  This sets up the 
latest battle in the never-ending spiritual struggle.</P>
<P>     The setting is a gothic boarding house (or boring house, if you 
prefer).  There, the few inhabitants become involved in the nightmarish 
turn of events.  Present are the landlady, Irene (CCH Pounder); her work 
release assistant, Jeryline (Jada Pinkett); and a series of assorted 
losers and has-beens (most of whom don't survive the film).  One way or 
another, these characters are sucked into the confrontation between 
Brayker and the Collector.</P>
<P>     DEMON KNIGHT's special effects are passable, but the same can't be 
said of the work done by the makeup artists .  Blood, gore, and various 
ghastly wounds all look especially cheesy, and the supposedly-horrifying 
demons are reminiscent of a cross between SPITTING IMAGE puppets and 
refugees from the ALIEN movies.</P>
<P>     There are occasions when Pinkett and Zane almost make this film 
worth watching.  These two appear to be enjoying themselves, and their 
sense of fun is infectious.  It doesn't last long, though.  Energy and 
enthusiasm can't sustain this sort of mess.  </P>
<P>     Since TALES FROM THE CRYPT is a half-hour program, it might have 
been reasonable to expect the motion picture version to string together 
three typical episodes.  Instead, the producers opted to make a single-
story feature.  If nothing else, this choice emphasizes a lesson.  Good 
entertainment stretched to three times its natural length is rarely three 
times better, but bad entertainment dragged out that long will typically 
be three times worse.  In the case of DEMON KNIGHT--which probably 
doesn't have ten minutes of worthwhile material--such a statement could 
be regarded as infinitely kind. </P>
