<PRE>                              LATE FOR DINNER
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     LATE FOR DINNER is a film by W. D. Richter, written by Mark
Andrus, starring Brian Wimmer, Peter Berg, Marcia Gay Harden, and
Colleen Flynn.</P>
<P>     (Very minor *spoilers* follow, since I have to assume the premise of
this film is unknown to the majority of you.  It suddenly appeared in
Seattle without any advance word, as far as I know.)</P>
<P>     W. D. Richter was the director of BUCKAROO BANZAI (1984).  And in
its way, LATE FOR DINNER is just as odd, idiosyncratic, and surprising.
It is also half BACK TO THE FUTURE and half GHOST, with a touches of
BLADERUNNER thrown in for the hell of it.  This is a film about time
travel through hibernation, a theme at least as old as the novel LOOKING
BACKWARD, which was published in 1888; chances are one or more of you
will write me or post an even older example.  But LATE TO DINNER works
here, freshly and touchingly.</P>
<P>     Frank, played by Peter Berg, is our narrator, and, typically of
Richter, we get to see the entire movie through the eyes and perceptions
of someone who was brain-damaged at birth and left with the IQ of a
small child.  </P>
<P>     He and his brother-in-law, Willie, played by Brian Wimmer (who I
understand had a role on the TV series CHINA BEACH), get into some deep
trouble in 1962 in Santa Fe, are aided in his own way by a slightly mad,
or at least off-center, cryonics researcher, and who are accidentally
and impossibly reanimated in 1991 in Pomona.</P>
<P>     Wimmer is the heart of the movie, which depends for its success on
the success of his performance.  He succeeds beautifully.  I've never
seen CHINA BEACH, so I'm unfamiliar with his acting.  Here he's a kind,
sensitive, country boy, with slightly antiquated manners, but a
willingness to think the best of every situation.  He is a romantic and
a family man.  He not only is his wife's lover, but he is also the
utterly devoted father of his child.  His greatest loss is the loss of
decades with the two women he loves the most.  He speaks with a charming
down-home accent that makes him the personification of sincerity itself.</P>
<P>     The first half of the movie is the set-up, including a flash-back,
and the BTTF future shock of encountering 1991 without having the chance
to ease into it like the rest of us.  Richter has a wonderful talent for
making our own era look like the future to us, and it is this sequence,
which has a lot of comedy in it, that we experience odd little moments
right out of BLADERUNNER (very strange, totally ignored business going
on the background of the main actions), at least for me.  But if this is
the BACK TO THE FUTURE half, it lacks the extremism and gimmicky
desperation of those films, giving us instead a much more human plight,
even in a fantasy context (it's hard to remember that, as one character
remarks, "cryonics is a joke -- you can't freeze somebody like a piece
of hamburger").</P>
<P>     The second half is thematically and effectively quite a different
movie, the GHOST half, if you will, very romantic and not a little
weepy.  A feel good section, in which the main tension is not solving
crimes (they were solved decades before by the wife) but rather whether
the two lovers can bridge the missing years and get back together.</P>
<P>     It's this second half, particularly, which stands LATE FOR DINNER a
chance of being another spectacular sleeper success, like GHOST.  I've
seen the movie twice in one weekend and both audiences ate it up.
People were crying happily all over the auditorium.  It is sweet and
satisfying.</P>
<P>     And not only do we have an epic love story of sorts, but we have a
beautiful friendship between the brothers-in-law, a friendship where man
has to look out for and care for the other.  I am a sucker for this
particular story element, I have to confess.</P>
<P>     All the principals give first-rate performances.  The two men never
let up, as Lyndol remarked; their roles seem especially difficult and
they never lose their characters for a moment.  The two women get to
demonstrate less range -- basically they're limited to shock and denial.
Harden plays Joy, the long-abandoned wife who had to find her own way to
the Nineties; Flynn plays Jessica, the grown daughter, who has to help
ease her father back into her and her mother's lives.</P>
<PRE>     (BTW, Kyle Secor, late of DELUSION, has a small part in LATE FOR
DINNER.)</PRE>
<P>     This is an odd movie and the oddest thing about it in a way is that
it works.  It surprises us over and over even at its romantic core; it
has a easy, low-key, kind of aw-shucks sense of humor; and it was some
winning performances.</P>
<PRE>     I recommend LATE FOR DINNER, even at full prices.</PRE>
