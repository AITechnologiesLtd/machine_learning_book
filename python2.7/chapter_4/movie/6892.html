<P>     Billy Bob Thornton has presented me with a wonderful dilemma in SLING
BLADE:  I don't know where to begin praising him.  There are writers who
get a shot at directing films, and actors who do some writing, and
film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera, but in
most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct, or an actor
write, or a director act.  In SLING BLADE, you never feel as though you
are watching a writer try to act, or an actor try to direct.  You realize
you are watching a natural born story-teller who understands that the
words, the performers and the images are not discrete elements, but
indivisible parts of a cohesive story.</P>
<P>    In SLING BLADE, that story is an enthralling drama centered around
Karl Childers (Thornton), a mentally handicapped man who has spent the
last 25 of his 37 years in a psychiatric hospital for murdering his mother
and her lover after catching them together.  Deemed fit to return to
society by the state, Karl is released from the hospital and returns to
the small Arkansas town where he grew up.  There he finds work as a
mechanic, and befriends a fatherless boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas
Black).  Karl is invited to live with Frank and his mother Linda (Natalie
Canerday), but he same welcome is not extended by Linda's abusive
boyfriend Doyle (Dwight Yoakam).  As Karl tries to adjust to life in the
outside world, he finds himself caught in the middle of a growing domestic
crisis, and faced with some challenging decisions.</P>
<P>     Thornton, who co-wrote the acclaimed ONE FALSE MOVE with Tom
Epperson, is a writer who seems to understand every facet of the craft as
though he created it.  His setting, an insular Southern town, is rendered
with a vivid combination of characters and locations; his characters, down
to the last minor player, are given personalities uniquely their own.  But
it is the remarkable dexterity with which Thornton weaves the threads of
his story that makes SLING BLADE so powerful.  It is the story of a
simple-minded man trying to understand Christianity directly from the
source, the Bible, after being schooled in a twisted version of the faith
by his unstable parents.  Even that effort is complicated, however, by an
experience of the world which seems to contradict the Bible, particularly
when he comes to respect Linda's gay friend Vaughan (John Ritter).  Karl's
story is heart-breaking because he always is striving to do the right
thing, but it is terribly hard for him to get his mind around what that
right thing is supposed to be.</P>
<P>     It is a marvelous character Thornton has written for himself, and he
does an astonishing job of bringing Karl to life.  Playing someone with a
mental or emotional handicap is one of the most treacherous assignments in
acting (right up there with playing an alcoholic), because it is so easy
to nail the character's twitches without nailing his soul.  The former can
be achieved through technical proficiency and a gift for mimicry, with
Dustin Hoffman in RAIN MAN and Geoffrey Rush in SHINE as a couple of showy
recent examples.  Neither of those roles, however, showed us a character
trying to grow as a person, and that is what Thornton accomplishes in
SLING BLADE.  Karl is far from oblivious to the world around him; he is
trying to understand morality, atone for his sins and learn from the
wrongs that were done to him.  While Thornton does turn in an exceptional
physical performance, which his polite demeanor and quirky speech
patterns, he does not allow Karl to be defined by the way he talks.  This
isn't a character you feel sorry for, like a pet; this is a man you feel
for as a fellow human being.</P>
<P>     Thornton the director draws similar superb performances from his
entire cast, particularly Dwight Yoakam (yes, _that_ Dwight Yoakam) as the
cruel Doyle.  He is casually chilling as he mixes insults and threats with
chuckles and expressions of endearment as though incapable of telling the
difference, and we can see the pathetic man behind the monster.
Complexities spill over from SLING BLADE, a film so perfectly crafted and
acted from the moment Karl leaves the hospital that I wish Thornton had
reconsidered the first fifteen minutes.  That opening finds Karl
describing his crimes to a reporter in a darkened room, with Thornton
re-creating the stage monologue which inspired the film.  It is an awkward
conceit which gets SLING BLADE off to an uneven start, but it is just as
well Thornton demonstrated imperfection as a director.  With the kind of
flawless work he does as writer and star of SLING BLADE, he might have
become positively insufferable if he had directed a perfect film as well.</P>
