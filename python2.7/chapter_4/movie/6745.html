<P>One thing or another kept me from seeing 'Michael' around the hoidays and
after finally getting around to see it I was pleasantly surprised.  I
expected it to be just another picture about and angel doing good deeds for
the sake of his eternal home but this is an offbeat picture which dwells on
the characters that matter and has a touching and good natured feeling.  A
group of tabloid newspaper employees from Chicago (William Hurt, Andie
MacDowell and Roberet Pastorelli) travel to small town Iowa with the paper's
mascot, a little dog named Sparky and investigate the claim by a kindly
elderly woman (Jean Stapleton --- yes, 'Edith Bunker') of an angel living
with her.  She tells the newspaper that her prayers were answered when she
asked for help and that Michael is her saviour.  At first the reporters are
humourously skeptical and doubt the claim is true but....well, without giving
away too much of the movie my plot description stops here.  As for the
analysis, John Travolta has made a wise choice in his career which continues
to grow and Travolta is remaining diverse since his comeback role in 'Pulp
Fiction' from 1994 and he has an amazing amount of droll charisma which women
find sexy and men find appealing.  'Michael' has all the makings for a
sensitive and moving holiday picture which plays amazingly well whenever you
view it.  There's a strange message of destiny in Travolta's character as the
movie's purpose is revealed in the end to a magical and heartfelt conclusion.
 Director Nora Ephron ('Sleepless in Seattle') uses a sure footed approach to
the material she co-wrote and blends it with tenderness and personality.
  Micheal isn't a great film but it never set out to be and is a picture that
knows it limits and deserves praise for that alone.</P>
