<PRE>                                 CARLITO'S WAY
                       A film review by Vjay Ramanujan
                        Copyright 1993 Vjay Ramanujan</PRE>
<P>Cast: Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller</P>
<P>     From the opening shot of Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) being shot
in Grand Central Station, with his girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann
Miller) by his side, you know there is going to be precious little
suspense in this movie.  Even the killer's identity is obvious halfway
through the movie (if it takes that long).  And in this case, that lack
of suspense is crucial to the success of the movie.  It doesn't allow
you to spend so much time guessing that you miss the real substance of
the movie, a character drama about a reformed mobster trying to detach
his survival instinct from his killer instinct.</P>
<P>     Brigante is released from prison on a technicality five years into
a thirty-year prison term, and takes this second chance as an
opportunity to go clean.  He gives an acceptance speech in the
courtroom, thanking his lawyer, his supporters, and even the
prosecutor, for obtaining evidence illegally.  His dream is to save
$75,000 to buy into a friend's car rental place in the Bahamas, and to
hook up with Gail, the girlfriend he dumped on the way into prison.</P>
<P>     Right from the start you know two important things. 1) Carlito
doesn't make it.  You've already seen his get shot. 2) There's
something not quite right with Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), Carlito's
lawyer.  Sean Penn turns in a great performance as the coke addicted,
unscrupulous attorney trying to become a player in the Hispanic/Italian
mob scene.  He brings Carlito into partnership with a mobster, as part
owner of a night club.  He steals a girl from Benny Blanco, an up and
coming leader in the drug trade.  He steals $1 million from a client,
bribe money intended to silence a witness.  Now the client is in jail,
and ready to kill Kleinfeld if he doesn't arrange a jail break.</P>
<P>     Carlito is not your typical mobster hero, in control of everything
and everyone.  In fact, there are strong indications that he is washed
up, unfit for the streets.  The first scene is an obvious tip-off.
Carlito doesn't realize that making his way out of the game is probably
harder than surviving within its confines.  He can't afford to take the
liberties with the law that his adversaries can.  Given a chance to
kill Benny Blanco, he tells his henchmen to let Blanco go, admitting
that it is probably a mistake.  But if he doesn't make that kind of
mistake, he is back in again.</P>
<P>     With those two characters in place, the movie is filled out with
the usual backups.  There's the suffering girlfriend who dreams of
becoming a Broadway dancer, but bides her time in a topless bar.
There's Benny, the street punk who thinks he deserves respect from the
legend, Carlito.  There's Carlito's cousin, who is making small cash
running drugs, and makes the mistake of trusting the people he deals
with.  There's the loyal sidekick, Pachango, and Sasso, the old
washed-up loser who Carlito goes into business with.  However, all of
them take on some personality of their own, with the possible exception
of Gail.</P>
<P>     As for the acting, the leading roles were exceptional.  On the way
out of the theater, one of the people I had seen it with complained
that Pacino no longer had the screen presence that he once had, that he
doesn't seem as intimidating and as for the acting, the leading roles
were exceptional.  On the way out of the theater, one of the people I
had seen it with complained that Pacino no longer had the screen
presence that he once had, that he doesn't seem as intimidating
anymore.  All of those things could be said of Carlito.  He not only
looks confused, but gives the feeling that this used to come
naturally.  And Penn, as I said earlier, was excellent in showing
Kleinfeld's descent, and eventual madness.</P>
<P>     The supporting roles were good, especially Blanco, but nothing
spectacular.  The direction was obviously well done, especially the
first and last scenes, in Grand Central Station.  Overall, the movie
rates a high three on a four-point scale.</P>
