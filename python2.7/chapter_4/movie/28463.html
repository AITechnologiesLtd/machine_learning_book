<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Legendary schlockmeister Ed Wood cited for winning the Golden Turkey
Award for Worst Director of ALL Time and for bad films such as Glen or
Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 from Outer Space, and for being
an inspiration to all bad directors, tries desperately to make a film
noir out of Jail Bait. The film is so poorly acted, the script is so
ludicrous, the settings are so tacky but, unfortunately, for Woods, the
plot and the narration tell a complete and understandable story
(something not done in Wood films). This is Wood's attempt to be taken
seriously, and he makes this the best film he has ever made.
Unfortunately, this film is not as prone to unintended laughs as his
others and therefore fails to live up to what the director has built his
reputation on. But this film has its moments, such as when Inspector
Johns (Lyle Talbot) says: "Carrying a gun can be a dangerous business."
Doctor Gregor's daughter Marilyn (Dolores Fuller) responds: "So
can...building a skyscraper."</P>
<P>Jail Bait tells a conventional tale about the misfortunes of Don Gregor
(Clancy Malone), the privileged son of a successful plastic surgeon
(Herbert Rawlinson, in a part intended for Bela Lugosi...it should be
noted that Rawlinson died on the night after the film was completed. It
should also be noted that Bela Lugosi died after four days of filming
Plan 9 from Outer Space (58) and was replaced by Wood's chiropractor).
He comes to a life of crime when he takes up with a small time criminal
Vic Brady (Timothy Farrell) in his pursuit for juvenile kicks.</P>
<P>When his sister Marilyn comes to the police station and talks with
Inspector Johns and Detective Lawrence (Steve Reeves-the future Hercules
and Superman in his first talking role in films), they explain that her
no-good brother, Don, is hanging out with criminals. She bails him out
for carrying an unlicensed gun and he returns to his father's place and
takes another gun with him before storming out of the house.</P>
<P>"Jail Bait" is a misleading title for the film, as it is a phrase that
usually refers to underaged women. In this film "jail bait" refers to
the fact that when Don takes the gun it becomes "jail bait," being that
he will be placed in jail, if caught, for a violation of bail terms.</P>
<P>At the Hunters' Inn he gets his cut from a robbery pulled earlier on
from Vic Brady, and is talked into going on another heist. They rob a
theater of $25,000, but in the process Don gets nervous and kills the
nightwatchman (Osborne), who happens to be a retired cop. This makes him
a cop killer. Thereby, Vic wounds a secretary (McKinnon) who was working
late and just happened to be passing, as he wants to make sure there's
no one around to identify them.</P>
<P>When Vic takes the frightened Don back to his swell pad he keeps with
his gun moll girlfriend (Thurman), Don mentions that he wants to give
himself up to the cops -- which greatly displeases Vic. He sneaks out of
Vic's place and visits dad's office, where he promises to give himself
up soon. But as he leaves dad's place, he is grabbed in the back alley
by Vic and taken back to his apartment. Vic then kills him so that he
won't identify him with the crime and stuffs his body in the kitchen
telling his girlfriend, we'll dump his body in the river later at night.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>Vic then gets the bright idea that he'll force Don's dad into doing
plastic surgery on his face so that no one will recognize him. Dr.
Gregoris told that once the surgery is successful the ones holding Don
will release him. But, while in the kitchen to get some water, the doc
discovers the body of his dead son. He completes the surgery and utters
out loud "that plastic surgery at times seems to me to be very very
complicated." When the operation is over he tells Vic not to take off
the bandages until two weeks pass. At that time, the doc has the police
over to his place and when the bandages come off, the face is that of
Don's. Not wanting to go to the electric chair Vic tries to escape, but
is gunned down by Johns.</P>
