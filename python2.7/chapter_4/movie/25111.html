<P>Wolfgang Petersen's latest, The Perfect Storm, is like
a pineapple. It only tastes good after arduous peeling
and digging - if you try to eat the fruit, spikes and
all, it's going to hurt…quite a bit. OK, maybe that
was a confusing analogy, so here's my main complaint
about the latest man battles nature flick: there isn't
really much of a story to tell. Basically, a
Massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small
boat, called the Andrea Gail, and gets stuck in the
middle of "the storm of the century." How much time
does it take for Petersen to tell this story? Not
nearly enough. So he spends the majority of the film
developing pointless side stories which all eventually
become superfluous. Audiences want to see the storm,
they want to see a fight for survival but what they
get is a lot of cliched, maudlin drivel. The last
quarter of The Perfect Storm is utterly perfect in
every aspect, but just try lasting the first
three-quarters. </P>
<P>I have yet to read Sebastian Junger's The Perfect
Storm, but from what I have heard it is an
unforgettable tale. Based on a true story, the book
must have found some other way to introduce the
characters because in the movie version, the approach
is weak. Using a wonderfully patriotic score by James
Horner, Petersen almost hides the in-your-face
banality. Right away the central characters are
introduced: the gritty, determined captain (George
Clooney), the ingenue (Mark Wahlberg) torn between his
job and his girlfriend (Diane Lane), the loving father
(John C. Reilly), the comic relief who's always trying
to get laid (John Hawkes), the new guy (William
Fichtner) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and
the quiet, French guy (Allen Payne). So many problems
strike the opening segment of the film that the
remaining portions directly suffer. It is not the
all-star cast's fault, just the characters designed
for their portrayal. Allen Payne's character never
speaks in the entire movie, not because he is mute,
but because he's never given any lines! Are we
supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are
never given a chance to interact with? Fichtner's
character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know
what he's doing there, where he's from, or who he's
supposed to be. The remaining four fishermen are all
cardboard stereotypes (Hawkes says to a female
stranger in one scene "You know what would look good
on you? Me!" Ooooh real creative).</P>
<P>As the script advances and the Andrea Gail floats
farther out into the waters, the crew continues to not
feel human. Only when the storm takes center stage
does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk. The
computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing
against a helpless boat are thunderously real. I can
only imagine if this was an IMAX film, this city kid
would surely never go in the water again. This is
loud, jolting entertainment - adjectives that
completely negate the rest of the film. </P>
<P>The Perfect Storm was unfortunately a disappointment.
The maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything
else failed to do so. I guess I'll stick to that other
Survival spectacle…you know the one on CBS?</P>
