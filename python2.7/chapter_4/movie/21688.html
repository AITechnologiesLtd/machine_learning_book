<PRE>                         BEING JOHN MALKOVICH
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule:  Paydirt!  A really, really off-the-
          wall fantasy that provides just one strange idea or
          one weird insight after another.  An office worker
          discovers his file cabinet hides a doorway into the
          head of John Malkovich so that fifteen minutes at a
          time the visitor can be the famous actor.
          Different people are affected differently and the
          implications of the premise are used in multiple
          comic ways.  Rating: 9 (0 to 10), +3 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is an audacious new comedy that starts
strange, keeps getting stranger, then hits an idea so weird that it
takes the rest of the film to explore only some of the many
ramifications.  "Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry
economic climate," complains Craig Schwartz (played John Cusak) an
out-of-work puppeteer to his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  Craig has been
reduced to street performances of Heloise and Abelard for change, and
even that does not work for him.  Lotte looks and dresses and generally
lives like a hippie.  She works in a pet store and has turned the
Schwartz's modest apartment into a menagerie of distressed animals.  In
his desperate efforts to find work Craig takes a job as a filing clerk
on the seven and a half floor of an office building.  The floor only
about five feet high was created to provide equal access for midgets.
Craig reluctantly settles into his job and starts having designs on the
office beauty, a leggy clerk named Maxine (Catherine Keener).  When
Maxine finds out Craig is a puppeteer his attentions are only a little
less welcome than the strep throat.</P>
<P>     Then Craig discovers that there is a little doorway hidden behind
an office file cabinet.  Behind it lies a dark, damp, gratuitously
Freudian tunnel that drops the trespasser into the mind and body of
John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich).  For fifteen minutes the
visitor sees what Malkovich sees, hears what Malkovich hears, and feels
what Malkovich feels.  Then the visitor is gently dropped from thin air
to the ground next to the New Jersey Turnpike.  For Craig the strange
phenomenon is his inroad to win the attentions of Maxine.  Maxine sees
the Malkovich tunnel as a giant moneymaking opportunity.  When Lotte
tries the tunnel she discovers that she likes to be Malkovich to ...
well that would be telling.</P>
<P>     Charlie Kaufman's script never slows down and never leaves a scene
with the expected.  And only toward the end is the plot so convoluted
that it stops making sense.  Not all the story possibilities are used,
but Kaufman does carry the premise and its ramifications to some
strange extremes.  Different people get different benefits from the
Malkovich ride.  Some visitors want to try just being in another body;
some want a taste of the Malkovich life style.  Malkovich's finely
appointed, but sterile and lifeless apartment is a stark contrast to
Craig's cluttered low-rent apartment teeming with animals and life.
Other people want to share the actor's sex life.</P>
<P>     John Cusak seems to have a taste for intelligent humor and takes
to his role with gusto.  For some reason he looks as seedy as he has
ever looked on the screen.  Cameron Diaz, who has been alluring in most
of her other films here is almost unrecognizably frumpy in a mop of
flyaway hair.  They are both made as unglamorous as possible to define
their rank in society and to contrast with Catherine Keener, one of the
beautiful people who can have a lover like Malkovich for the asking.
And the old doctor with a voice like Orson Bean really is played by
Orson Bean.</P>
<P>     At last something new and original in a movie.  This is a film as
fresh and entertaining as was the story ALICE IN WONDERLAND when it was
new.  It would be nice if following the lead of BEING JOHN MALKOVICH
filmmakers would realize that you could start with some really crazy
premise, possibly fantasy, and just follow it to wherever it leads.  I
rate BEING JOHN MALKOVICH a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     Maybe someone who knows more about the state of marionette
techniques than I do.  Can a good puppeteer really make a marionette do
a somersault and not get the strings tangled up.  Questions unanswered:
Is there a separate in-house documentary about the seventh floor?
After all we know from the outside of the building that the floors
started out all the same height, so they must have divided the seventh
floor.  I was willing to suspend my disbelief for that; I was even
willing to suspend my disbelief on the major premises of the film.  But
one thing is minor premise goes a little too far.  I find it very
difficult to believe that without benefit of a magical tunnel anybody
could get from an office building in Manhattan to the New Jersey
Turnpike in only fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>     When Malkovich enters the tunnel the result is a really bizarre
scene borrowed from a "Twilight Zone" episode, but it is totally
unsatisfying as what would be seen.  I was expecting to see an ever-
diminishing tunnel or repetitions, not unlike the mirror scene in
CITIZEN KANE.  But my question is what did the Japanese tourist who was
in the tunnel with him see.  I assume from the script that Malkovich
really has never played a jewel thief.  However the reference to him
playing someone mentally retarded was probably to his performance as
Lenny in John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN (1992).</P>
