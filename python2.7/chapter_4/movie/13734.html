<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>BASEketball is a fantastic assembly of failed jokes.  I sat
straight-faced through much of the film, enduring the agonizing
experience of a make-fun-of-sports film that is rarely imaginative,
funny, or smart.  Oh, I know, a film like this isn't supposed to be
"smart," right?  Well, the funniest films have underlying intelligence
-- a feeling you get knowing that the makers had some kind of thought or
vision while creating their picture.  BASEketball gave me no such
feelings.  I just sat and watched actors romp around a script that
relies almost entirely on toilet humor.</P>
<P>It is a bad film.  I would have preferred to dislike it more, but the
presence of Trey Parker and Matt Stone keeps me from despising
BASEketball.  I've never seen these guys before (and I've never watched
an episode of "South Park," which is their creation), but they have a
strange kind of presence that had me entertained throughout
BASEketball.  I wasn't always laughing, but I was amused.  On the basis
of this, I begrudgingly award the film my lowest-possible rating in the
"mediocre" category.</P>
<P>Parker and Stone play a couple of loser buddies, Coop and Doug.  One
day, in their driveway, they create a game, which turns out to be a
strange and frightening amalgamation of baseball and basketball.  It
becomes a neighborhood hit, when finally a rich guy (Ernest Borgnine)
comes to buy the game and make it a professional sport.  Cut ahead five
years, and our heroes are playing in the national BASEketball league
(their team name is the Beers, which is supposed to be a joke).  </P>
<P>One of the rules of the game is that players can't trade teams, and
teams can't move to different cities.  This is where the story comes
in!  See, when the rich guy dies, another rich guy (Robert Vaughn) wants
to break the previously mentioned rules.  It's up to our heroes to stop
this other rich guy.  In the meantime, the two of them are fighting over
the nice-looking director (Yasmine Bleeth) of the Dreams Come True
Foundation.</P>
<P>Unlike Mafia!, BASEketball takes itself seriously from time to time.  A
film this silly should never, ever take itself seriously.  There should
be absolutely zero "tender" moments between our hero and the love
interest.  There shouldn't even *be* a love interest:  the mere presence
of a love interest is an immediate removal of points on my scorecard,
because it requires scenes in which the two characters kiss, or almost
kiss.  I despise scenes like these.  They aren't funny, and every scene
in a film like this should aspire to new comic heights.</P>
<P>It doesn't help that director David Zucker has no focus on his humor. 
Sometimes BASEketball spoofs films.  Sometimes it spoofs the sports
industry.  Sometimes it's nothing more than a big fart joke, no more
complex than Doctor Dolittle or There's Something About Mary.  I like
films that spoof specific things like films and sports, and even big
fart jokes have their place in certain movies, but Zucker never follows
through with any of his attacks, and the result is a slew of jokes that
seem like they all belong in different films.  Some of them are funny
(the locker room scene is great), but too many fall flat.  Not laughing
during a comedy is like an uncomfortable silence on a first date.</P>
<P>But there's something interesting about Parker and Stone.  They're both
endearing -- it seems they knew that much of this material wasn't very
funny; the interesting thing about BASEketball is that, despite it's
failure as a comedy, it's never boring.  In fact, is usually amusing,
thanks to Parker and Stone.  These guys have personality, and they
certainly know how to kiss (the scene in which they make up is rather
unexpected).  This isn't a good film, but it's a good introduction to a
couple of funny guys who may have found a place for themselves in the
industry.</P>
