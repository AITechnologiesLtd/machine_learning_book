<PRE>Review: Saving Grace (2000)</PRE>
<P>There's a new genre of film appearing at the ‘Plex these days. It's the
Quirky British Village That Comes Together genre. Think of THE FULL
MONTY, WAKING NED DEVINE and LOCAL HERO. They're all about how the folks
in the town support some ziggy plot that one of the locals has hatched.
They are contagiously genial and charming films -- the kind of movies
you watch with a little grin on your face the whole time.</P>
<P>Now comes SAVING GRACE, a sweet exploration of how the best things in
life are the things you don't necessarily plan for. Grace Trevethyn is a
rather proper, orchid-growing, middle-aged British lady. When her
husband dies suddenly, leaving her in debt, she decides to grow
marijuana in her greenhouse in a last ditch effort to save her home.
Using the same techniques she does with her pampered orchids, Grace
grows a crop of weed in her greenhouse that would bring Jerry Garcia
back from the Dead. When it's time to harvest and sell her crop,
everything goes wackily wrong, all at once. But the crusty lovable
townspeople save the day.</P>
<P>And there's the rub with SAVING GRACE. It's infectious and fun but it
doesn't really cover any new territory. It's not hard to see where it's
going. (Although the coda has a few undetected surprises) And everyone's
so predictably benign in their eccentricity.  Certainly there must be
one dullard or mutant or evildoer in the bunch. Maybe it's more of a
sub-genre than a full-fledged genre unto itself. Maybe it's an offshoot
of that big category I fondly call `British Humor' -- ranging from the
incomprehensibly successful Benny Hill to the sublime Monty Python to
those ladies-on-holiday films. It's all about the pluck and
determination of post-War Britain -- the Britain that remembers how
important it is to get along and just be nice.</P>
<P>Grace is played with spunk and kewpie-doll cuteness by Brenda Blethyn --
who deserves a lifetime supply of whatever vice she chooses for her
work. Each time this woman appears on screen, she is thoroughly someone
else. From SECRETS & LIES to LITTLE VOICE to A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, Ms
Blethyn offers up cinematic portraits of vulnerability and pluck.  Her
Grace glides seamlessly from grieving, frightened widow to giggly
co-conspirator to not-so-suave drug dealer to...well...that would just
spoil too much of the fun. Suffice to say, Ms Blethyn is convincing
every step of the way.</P>
<P>As in it's precursors, SAVING GRACE depends on its cast of small town
eccentrics to lift it above the ho-hum. There's the priest who loves
vampire movies and the doctor who reads Jackie Collins. The female love
interest is a fisherman and the male love interest  -- Grace's partner
in crime -- thinks being responsible is highly overrated. Two elderly
shopkeepers enjoy Grace's `tea'  quite a lot. A drug dealer has to pick
up his daughter after her flute lesson.</P>
<P>Inside these delightful characters are real-looking actors with spirit
and appeal. They work together like they've all lived in the same small
coastal town forever and ever and happily coexist with each other's
idiosyncrasies. They are the backbone of this new sub-genre. And they
make the two movie hours of your life perfectly satisfying. Even if you
have seen it all before.</P>
<P>People who inhale and people who don't need not fear: SAVING GRACE
appeals to anyone willing to go along for the high.  There's nothing
deviant or crude about marijuana in SAVING GRACE.  No evil pot-heads. No
lurking junkies. Just a bunch of really appealing folk from the
countryside of England, enjoying a romp. And a toke.</P>
