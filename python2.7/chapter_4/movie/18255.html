<P>One of the most interesting scenarios that is posed by United States law 
is the option for the military to take control in a time of crisis, and 
declare a state of martial law. Being that this has never been done for 
a period of time long enough to encounter the various circumstances it 
would raise, martial law remains a mysterious threat to the American 
people. It could be a saving grace or it could be a nightmare. With that 
known, martial law could have provided one of the greatest settings that 
is possible for a movie. And then, imagine this moving having 3 great 
actors like Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis and Annette Bening. The 
Siege had potential written all over it. And, to some degree, it met 
it's potential. However, for the most part, The Siege turned out to be 
little more than an average films with a few high points.</P>
<P>The year is 2000. (Although that is never actually stated, the Oklahoma 
City bombing is often mentioned as having been 5 years earlier.) That 
gives a time in the future so that we may suspend all belief, but it 
also allows for a present day society. Somewhere in the middle east, an 
Islamic leader is taken hostage by the US military. This is classified 
information though, and ranks as high as the president are not informed. </P>
<P>New York City is suddenly taken by surprise as a series of massive 
terrorist attacks all take place in Brooklyn. FBI/NYPD officer Hubbard 
(Denzel Washington) is at the very front of the investigation. His 
partner is the Lebanese-American Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub). And CIA 
agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening) is brought in to assist. On top of 
that, General Devereaux (Bruce Willis) of the US military, is in New 
York offering his assistance as well.</P>
<P>The biggest problem in looking into these terrorist bombings, is that 
they are all suicide bombings. Other than the fact that the bomber is 
always Islamic, the FBI/CIA/NYPD/Military have nothing to work with 
because the suspect is always dead, and therefore there are no links 
left back to the mastermind. Even worse, it is feared that there may not 
be a mastermind, but rather the "mastermind" is the Islamic faith.</P>
<P>Through a series of events, Brooklyn is declared to be a dangerous area 
and a war is declared against terrorism. However, unlike previous events 
in American history in which the president declared a "war on 
terrorism," this war is quite literal. General Devereaux is put in 
charge, and New York quickly becomes a city under siege. Every street is 
covered with military, and traffic isn't caused by cars, but rather 
tanks. AK-47 Assault Riffles become as common as candy during the 
holiday season.</P>
<P>What you have in The Siege should be every American's worst nightmare. 
The basic rights that are often taken for granted, are revoked. Freedom 
of speech is quick to go, and from there life is a rapid deterioration. 
The mere thought of a martial law is intensely frightening. The Siege 
has 3 big name actors that help make this one of the most intense films 
of the year. Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis are brilliant. Often 
given the opportunity to deliver monologues and speeches, they are the 
most powerful part of this film. Not since Michael Douglas declared 
greed to be good in the 1987 award winning film Wall Street, have lines 
been delivered that well. However, Annette Bening is a huge 
disappointment. Not only is she remarkably not believable in what 
appears to be a simple role, but she is frustrating to watch. You are 
reminded of the little kid in a school play who just can't remember that 
one line. But, on a brighter note, the relatively unheard of Tony 
Shalhoub in incredible. Though never given a huge scene, or monologue of 
a comparable nature to Willis or Washington, he gets the job done in 
stylish fashion.</P>
<P>The last problem that The Siege encounters, is the incredibly racist 
message. The Nation of Islam is the villain. Not a member of the faith, 
although members are singled out, but rather the impression given is 
that the entire faith is somewhat at fault for terrorism. Throughout 
Washington D. C. this film has been protested. Upon exiting the theater, 
I was given a flyer by a protester explaining what the true beliefs are 
and how the movie distorted them. To find a movie as ignorantly racist 
as this, you would have to go back to 1915 and D. W. Griffith's The 
Birth of a Nation. And yet, that managed to survive all these years 
because it was a ground breaking masterpiece. Unfortunately, the siege 
doesn't have those values to it.</P>
