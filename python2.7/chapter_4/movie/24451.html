<PRE>Lions and tigers and Crowe. </PRE>
<PRE>Oh my.</PRE>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Corrupt politicians.  High-profile athletes.  Bloodthirsty fans.  No, 
it's not business as usual in modern-day America...  </P>
<P>It's 180 A.D; Maximus (Russell Crowe), fearless and beloved General in 
the Roman Empire, has had a hard two years and 234 days and one morning, 
and just wants to go home to his wife and son.  But Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius (Richard Harris) has something else in mind for the General: 
declaring Maximus "the son I wish I'd had", Marcus wants Maximus to 
insure that Rome returns to public rule by taking interim control of the 
Empire until the Roman Senate can get it together enough to take over.  </P>
<P>This does not sit well with Marcus' actual son (and next-in-line for the 
Emperorship), the pampered Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix); feeling cheated 
out of his rightful place in life, he conspires against Marcus and 
Maximus, as well as his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and her son 
Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark), and Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to 
become the next Emperor of Rome.  Commodus [am I The Only One who can't 
help thinking of a toilet bowl when seeing that name in print?] does Bad 
Things that eventually lead to Maximus being made a gladiator-slave in 
the servitude of Proximo (Oliver Reed), who teaches Maximus and fellow 
gladiator-slave Juba (Djimon Hounsou) the rule-of-thumb of becoming a 
successful--that is, living--gladiator: "win the people, and you'll win 
your freedom".</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Hmmm...that shorthand synopsis sounds a bit soap-operaish, and in fact, 
elements of the story do bring in mind something along the lines of All 
My Decadent First-Century Children.  And a soap isn't the only thing the 
storyline of GLADIATOR brings to mind; the movie reminded me of any 
number of things, from NFL players in a stadium, to the American 
Congress, to other movies (like, of all things, Kevin Costner's version 
of "Robin Hood", and of course, classics like BEN HUR and SPARTACUS).  
But mostly, GLADIATOR reminded me just how brilliant and chameleon-like 
Russell Crowe is as an actor.</P>
<P>It's breathtaking to watch Crowe so easily losing himself in his roles, 
while totally drawing the viewer in and keeping them believing; just as 
Crowe *was* the downtrodden, overweight, middle-aged protagonist in THE 
INSIDER, he is equally convincing here as Maximus--about as far from 
Jeffrey Wigand as he could be.  Yet, both characters have something in 
common: their sense of family and the need to make things right.  And 
whether it's from under a business suit or a suit of armor, Crowe 
portrays those strong character traits skillfully.</P>
<P>That said, the movie suffers most whenever Crowe is not involved in a 
scene.  To be sure, most of the supporting cast is capable, if not 
strong--Richard Harris in his brief turn as the Emperor, Oliver Reed in 
a meatier role as Proximus, and Derek Jacobi's Gracchus, being standouts 
among them--but the movie seems to crawl along most noticeably in 
Crowe's absence, and when the action stops.  That, and the difficult 
time I had believing that Commodus would last a day as Emperor [could he 
be more whiny?] or that Lucilla would suddenly become powerless and 
demure in the presence of her rather limp brother, threatened to wreak 
havoc with my suspension of disbelief...until Crowe showed up on the 
screen again, and everything was Made Right once more.</P>
<P>And speaking of "action", director Ridley Scott pulled out all the stops 
to bring it to the audience, in full, bloody gore.  The special effects 
are seamless and spectacular; never getting in the way of the story, it 
wasn't until the closing credits rolled that I remembered that so many 
of the background images were computer-generated.  Effects alone doesn't 
pay the bills, though; and the interplay between Crowe and Nielsen, and 
Crowe and Phoenix, and Crowe and [insert castmember's name here] show 
the earmarks of good directing on Scott's part.</P>
<P>The parallels in GLADIATOR with American politics were humorous--a 
leader would give power back to The People by empowering The Senate?  
bwah!--but those parallels also made it all the more easy to follow the 
plotline.  And before the viewer has a chance to get comfortable with 
the humor, Scott and Crowe come back with a testosterone rush and get 
the adrenaline pumping again.</P>
<P>Now *that's* how you kick-start a Summer movie season!  </P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
Spectacular images, remarkable action, powerful scene-chewing by Russell 
Crowe in the lead - on top of a hit-and-miss story presented whenever he 
wasn't on-screen.  Oh well; three outta four ain't bad...</P>
<P>GLADIATOR (rating: greenlight): 
It ain't Spartacus, but it's most def good enough for a repeat 
performance, if only to see Crowe sizzle again.</P>
