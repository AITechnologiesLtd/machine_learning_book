<PRE>RUSH HOUR (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Brett Ratner
Writers: Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna (story by LaManna)
Starring: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson, Elizabeth Peña, Mark
Rolston, Tzi Ma, Rex Linn, Ken Leung, Julia Hsu, Chris Penn, Philip
Baker Hall</P>
<P>The buddy pic is easily one of the most tiresome and overused formulas
for a film we've ever had, but for some reason, the Hollywood machine
pumps a couple out every year, munundating all of us with half-assed
storylines, and mispaired pairs that make for a really unenjoyable
movie.  In theory, then, "Rush Hour" should be no exception.  Chris
Tucker is still a bit iffy, with his helium-affected motor mouth being
occasionally amusing, but never rather funny (do any of you remember how
the film stopped when he came on screen in "The Fifth Element?").  And
Jackie Chan's one of the world's greatest entertainers, a dare devil
comic action hero with the best coordination and control over all bodily
movements I've ever seen.  The pairing of these two just shouldn't work
out, and it should have been forgettable.</P>
<P>Well, yes, it's rather forgettable, but that doesn't mean it's not
actually charming when watching it.  "Rush Hour" is not a great buddy
pic like, say, "Lethal Weapon," and in about a year, everyone will be
wondering what all the fuss was about.  In short, this is no classic,
and I doubt there'll be a successful franchise.  But not every buddy
pic, or any film for that matter, has to do that.  Some can be just
entertaining, and for an hour and a half, it is.  If it's content to be
just good, then there's nothing really wrong with that.</P>
<P>"Rush Hour" takes advantage of the Hong Kong transfer of power in '97,
as a couple films this year have ("Chinese Box" and, most recently and
most appallingly, "Knock Off"), and uses the arrival of the Chinese
Consul in L.A. (Tzi Ma) to bring about an elaborate kidnapping scheme by
an underground villain, dubbed JunTao.  The FBI wants to help out, but
so do the LAPD, but the Consul wants to hire an old friend of his,
Inspector Lee (Chan), to come in.  He does, but the LAPD gives him over
to their most troublesome detective, James Carter (Tucker), a reckless,
goofy, but driven detective who doesn't like for one second that he's
been saddled with Lee.</P>
<P>"Rush Hour" wastes no time in utilizing the old cliches, including the
beloved first meeting where they hate eachother, but slowly growing to
respect their own traits and rub off on one another.  In one scene, they
go into a pool hall for some information, and after an admittingly funny
faux pas, Chan is found fighting the inhabitants of the ghetto hall,
much to the distaste of Tucker, but they gradually like eachother,
bringing about the scene where they swap personal likes and dislikes.</P>
<P>Oh, and the plot still has to be resolved, but you know it'll be handled
without the least bit of care.  You can guess who JunTao is fairly early
on (hint: he's British, therefore he's evil), and the scenes involving
the kidnapping instead come off as comic action sequences without a ton
of suspense, but a lot of joking around.  Tucker says a couple of
sarcastic remarks and his overblown self confidence gets him in some
trouble, and then Chan comes in with his Chaplin-esque comic timing,
then kicks some ass the way only he can.  And so forth.</P>
<P>What's surprising is that though this should be crap, and perhaps it is,
it doesn't come off that way.  The reason is because of Chan and
Tucker.  Their chemistry is extremely good, and they work well together
while still retaining each of their own respective individual traits
(even Tucker comes off as charmingly humorous).  Many buddy pics forget
about chemistry, but this is essential to creating a film that is
entertaining and engrossing, both which "Rush Hour" is, and why so many
people are actually enjoying it.  It's not because of the plot, which is
so arbitrary it's a wonder actors like Tom Wilkinson, Elizabeth Peña,
and Philip Baker Hall would sign on for any other reason than an easy
pay check.</P>
<P>But Chan and Tucker aren't the only reason this is likable.  It has a
light feel to it that makes it easier to intake, and allows goodness to
seep in not just from Chan and Tucker, but also from other members of
the cast and other assortment facets of the film.  Although cliched and
not terribly suspenseful, the action sequences are surprisingly adept
and supply entertainment.  I liked some of those added nuances, like the
handling of the kidnapped daughter as a real form of personality (when
saved by Chan, she kicks him for not saving her earlier).  And
Wilkinson, a great actor who's been in everything these days (notably
"The Full Monty," in which he was brilliant), has an icy dignity he
brings to the role of the villain, as if he's being a good sport about
being in his first big American movie ("I know I'm doing this mostly for
money and exposure, but what the hell - I'll have some real fun with
this role.").</P>
<P>But when you really come down to it, it's mostly the buddy chemistry
that keeps this afloat.  It lives and dies with the casting of the
leads, and luckily Chan and Tucker are so amiable apart and together
that the film is a slight success.  It's not incredibly ambitious, but
for awhile, it's mildly distracting, which is more than you can say for
a lot of the films Hollywood is putting out these days, I suppose.</P>
