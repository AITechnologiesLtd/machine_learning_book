<P>ROMEO + JULIET does to Shakespeare's play what CLUELESS did to Jane
Austen's novel: it modernizes and updates a classic work for the 18-24
year-old market. After seeing this loud, ambitious movie twice, I remain
conflicted about it: while I was moved by it, I also think that it is a
piece of manipulative fluff--a kind of "Teen Beat" magazine in
cinemascope.</P>
<P>Each generation reinvents Shakespeare for itself. This ROMEO + JULIET is
ridden with 90's kitsch. It uses Shakespeare's
words, but takes its imagery from the exaggerated vocabulary of soap
operas, MTV, and Andy Warhol. It was filmed in
Mexico City, which is an exaggeration of urban life in itself. The
kitsch works well in some sequences: in an invigorating party
scene, at which Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes)
first meet, characters wear costumes that effectively
communicate their personalities: Romeo wears the stylish armor of a
post-modern knight, Juliet wears the foam wings of an
earthbound angel, Capulet (Juliet's dominating father) wears the
Caesaric robes of an august patriarch, Mercutio (Romeo's
friend and the Prince's kinsman) wears the sequined dress of a drag
queen, and Paris (Juliet's establishment-minded suitor)
wears the dorky space-gear of an enthusiastic astronaut. I appreciated
the way the movie updated Shakespeare's characters.
In this movie, the Prince of Verona is a tough police commissioner, the
Capulets and Montagues are rival gangs, the chorus is a
TV anchorwoman, and the Friar Laurence (Pete Postlethwaite, who gives a
fun performance) is a hip priest who proclaims the
benefits of "herbs." Many of these touches are original and
thought-provoking; this movie could be understood as a comment
on recent racial disturbances in Los Angeles, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Miami,
and Crown Heights. The problem is that I'm not
sure what, exactly, it might be saying.</P>
<P>As Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines give effective
performances. The camera adores these young stars. As soft golden light
plays over DiCaprio's wet hair, skinny torso, and sensuous lips, one
thinks of James Dean's body and Marlon Brando's cheekbones. As the
angelic Juliet, Danes looks pristine--until she smirks naughtily while
considering that "other part/ belonging to a man." The single best scene
of the movie occurs when DiCaprio and Danes first lock eyes through a
fish tank. For a few brief moments, pure innocence and charm take
command of the screen. These actors, both on the cusp of puberty, convey
the wonder and the angst of two young lovers in the throes of an
overpowering, but impossible, love. DiCaprio and Danes are a perfect
Romeo and Juliet for the 1990's: their budding bodies are completely in
sync with the recent trend of unisex ad campaigns.</P>
<P>At a certain point during the movie, the many excesses began to bother
me. The brashness that was at first charming soon
became tiresome. In many scenes, such as the one in Church where Juliet
reposes amid millions of crosses and candles, the
layers of kitsch became so thick that I had trouble locating any glimmer
of sincerity or feeling. The imagery of ROMEO + JULIET has the puffed-up
ethos of a TV commercial. Watching this movie made me think of Thomas
Carlyle, who, in Past and
Present (1843), decried the effects of advertising on shoemaking: "Thy
shoes are vamped up falsely to meet the market;
behold, the leather only seemed to be tanned; thy shoes melt under me to
rubbishy pulp, and are not veritable mud-defying
shoes, but plausible vendible similitudes of shoes." At their best,
movies like ROMEO + JULIET cannot create true emotions,
because they themselves evince none; they can only produce "vendible
similitudes" of emotions. In the end, that's just not
enough for me.</P>
