<PRE>                               FAR AND AWAY
                       A film review by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1992 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     By now nearly everybody has heard that Ron Howard's FAR AND AWAY is
the first film to be shot in 70mm in nearly twenty years.  I'm happy to
report that it looks wonderful (if you don't see this in 70mm you'll be
sorry).  I'm even happier to report that the gorgeous cinematography is
completely at the service of the story.</P>
<P>     FAR AND AWAY gets of to a bit of a slow start, but by the time the
action moves from Ireland to Boston and the second act kicks in it
really works.  The last act is nearly all done literally on the run.  I
saw the film in a sleep-deprived state and it kept me awake, alert and
interested all the way through.</P>
<P>     Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman each turn in excellent performances.
Cruise infuses his character with real fire once the script catches up
with him in Boston.  Kidman gets the more interesting role of the
character who goes through the most changes, and she's equal to it.
They both create thinking, feeling, believable characters who fall in
love on the way to their dreams.  The screenwriting and direction show
respect for our intelligence as they let the love story play out almost
entirely in the subtext, a most refreshing thing in a world of
how-about-breakfast-and-what-was-your-name-again movies.</P>
<P>     Their physical attraction is clear, but then who wouldn't be
attracted to people who look like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman?  By
bypassing the nearly requisite and quite misnamed "love" scene Hollywood
loves to dish out when writers don't want to think, Howard, Cruise and
Kidman deliver the much more romantic and interesting process of two
people learning to love each other in spite of, and at times because of,
their faults and differences.  The love story is woven through the
process of reaching the Oklahoma land rush, and the independence that
owning land represents.  Just like so many real people, they
occasionally lose sight of the goal and get sidetracked.  As strong
characters, the conflict only makes them stronger.</P>
<P>     Howard's direction also delivers humor, action, and a world peopled
by desperate eccentrics.  His America of the late Nineteenth Century is
at once welcoming and frightening, dangerous and full of promise.  The
casting is good all around, and fans of "Hill Street Blues" should get a
particular kick out of Nicole Kidman's screen parents.  FAR AND AWAY is
a film which, if you are at all interested in seeing, should be seen on
the biggest screen and in the best theatre you can find.</P>
