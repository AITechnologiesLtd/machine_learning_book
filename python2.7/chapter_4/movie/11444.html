The Daytrippers</PRE>
<PRE>Written and Directed by Greg Mottola</PRE>
<P>Starring Hope Davis (Eliza D'Amico), Stanley Tucci (Louis D'Amico),   
Parker Posey (Jo), Liev Schreiber (Carl), Anne Meara (Rita Malone), Pat   
McNamara (Jim Malone), Campbell Scott (Eddie)</P>
<P>THE DAYTRIPPERS is Greg Mottola's feature debut, and it's a fairly   
promising one, full of fine performances and well-written scenes.  But if   
you find the memory of it slipping away from you within moments of its   
denouement, don't be surprised.  The film's plot is loosely constructed,   
and although there is an intriguing interplay of theme and story, Mottola   
ultimately doesn't have enough control over his material to turn it into   
anything affecting or memorable.  But his little micro-Odyssey is   
nonetheless a good trip; it's worth going along for the ride.</P>
<P>The story is rather picaresque in structure; our heroes, somewhat hapless   
suburbanites, take an impromptu trip through the amoral jungles of   
Manhattan.  All this gets rolling when Hope, who appears to have a   
strong, loving relationship with her husband, Louis, finds a love note in   
the form of an early modern lyric poem, and doesn't know what to make of   
it.  Encouraged by her domineering and slightly unhinged mother (played   
with frightening presence by Anne Meara), she decides to head down from   
Long Island to Louis's Manhattan office to ask him in person.  Dad (an   
underused Pat McNamara) drives; Mom, younger sister Jo (played with   
casual quirkiness by Parker Posey), and younger sister's beau Carl (Liev   
Schreiber) tag along for the ride, offering moral support and comic   
relief, as the mood dictates.</P>
<P>When Louis turns out to have taken the day off from work, the family's   
suspicions grow, and they spend most of the rest of the film searching   
around Manhattan for Louis, or for evidence of his infidelity.  This   
quest, such as it is, is the real meat of the film, for as our displaced   
adventurers roam about town, they bump into all sorts of eccentric urban   
types whose concerns are, more or less, intertwined with their own.   
 Everyone's life in the city is all about sex, and about family.  The   
dysfunctional troupe meets up with a son who's hiding his   
child-support-dodging dad from the police; with sisters squabbling over   
their mother's estate, fighting tooth and nail down to the last codeine   
pill.  Hope meets a spurned lover at a party, while Jo meets a man who   
might be perfect -- or might be a clever, manipulative schemer.  It's   
just another day in the big city.</P>
<P>But the real theme here is how the thick glaze of a good story gets   
scraped away by real pain.  Most of our little suburban squadron looks at   
their trip into the city as something of a lark, but for Hope and Louis,   
it's deadly serious.  Mottola has found a great newcomer in Eliza   
D'Amico; she's able to make her face speak louder than her family's   
words, and some of the film's most affecting moments come while we watch   
her face tugging at itself with worry while family glibly froths.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is also strong.  Liev Schreiber gives a convincingly   
naive performance as a young intellectual without many good ideas; he has   
some difficulty in scenes that require more emotional intensity, but   
then, so does his character.  And Stanley Tucci, during his brief moments   
on screen, is utterly, hopelessly, devastatingly convincing in a part   
that requires him to play a good liar.</P>
<P>At its best, THE DAYTRIPPERS reminds me of recent films that celebrate   
the bizarre way that human lives are woven together in the modern city --   
films like Krzysztof Kieslowski's RED and Wong Kar-wai's CHUNGKING   
EXPRESS.  But here these themes serve more as connective tissue than   
anything else, holding together a plot that might otherwise -- and   
sometimes still does -- seem rambling and pointless.  In the end, the   
film's main pleasures are momentary and idiosyncratic -- the leisurely   
progress of a plot and the pleasantly unpredictable performances of the   
lead players.  These are not pleasures to be sneered at, mind you.   
 Mottola's debut is on the whole a real pleasure to watch, a deft piece   
of storytelling with some moments of real beauty and passion.   </P>
