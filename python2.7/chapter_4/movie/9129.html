<P>     When Henry James wrote THE WINGS OF THE DOVE around the turn of the 
century (he first put pen to paper in 1894; the novel was published 
eight years later), one of his primary objectives was to dramatize the 
conflict between the fading morals and traditions of the 19th century 
and the emerging, "modern" liberality of the 20th century.  The 
resulting book has been numbered among James' richest and most 
intriguing works -- a tale that has lost none of its fascination and 
relevance nearly 100 years later.  </P>
<P>     When adapting classic novels (such as THE WINGS OF THE DOVE) into 
movies, there are generally two approaches that film makers consider.  
The first is a straightforward, literal translation that leaves the 
characters, narrative, and dialogue intact (this can often be a 
cumbersome approach for a motion picture, unless the source material is 
short).  The second is to opt for a more "free" adaptation that allows 
condensation, change, and, in some cases, "modernization."  Sometimes it 
works (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY), sometimes it doesn't (ANNA KARENINA).  At 
any rate, the latter method is the one chosen by director Iain Softley 
and screenwriter Hossein Amini for THE WINGS OF THE DOVE.  While leaving 
the general storyline and basic themes of the novel intact, these two 
men elected to alter certain key aspects of James' book to make it more 
cinematic and to give it greater appeal for a 1990s audience.</P>
<P>     As might be expected, the basic plot of the movie and the book is 
the same (although the time line has been shifted by ten years to 1910 
in the film).  THE WINGS OF THE DOVE opens with Kate Croy (Helena Bonham 
Carter) going to live with a wealthy, cultured aunt (Charlotte Rampling) 
shortly after the death of her mother.  Kate's aunt has every intention 
of setting up her niece in a comfortable, socially-acceptable marriage.  
But Kate, who has fallen in love with Merton Densher (Linus Roache), a 
poor journalist far below her social station, has other ideas.  But when 
her aunt threatens to disinherit her if she doesn't break off the 
illicit relationship, Kate is faced with a moral dilemma.  Her singular 
solution proves to be damaging to all involved.</P>
<P>     Kate befriends a wealthy young American, Milly Theale, who has come 
to Europe for health reasons.  Milly is seriously ill, and her state of 
health suggests a plan to Kate, who contrives for Milly to meet Merton.  
Soon, Milly is hopelessly in the thrall of the handsome journalist, and, 
with Kate's aid, Milly makes a play for him while all three are on a 
holiday in Venice.  It is only then that Merton divines the nature of 
Kate's plot:  that he should marry Milly for her money, then, upon her 
death when he would be rich, he could marry Kate.  </P>
<P>     THE WINGS OF THE DOVE is very much an actors' film because, 
although the characters are set down on paper, it's up to the performers 
to bring them to life.  A viewer's appreciation of the film, with all of 
its powerful drama and uncomfortable moral questions, depends on his or 
her acceptance of each of the three principals as unique individuals, 
not stereotypical "heroes" or "villains."  Kate, who was presented 
harshly in James' novel, is developed in the movie as a flawed woman 
trapped between her desire for love and wealth.  And, although her plan 
is calculated and manipulative, she embarks upon it with deep misgivings 
and emerges from it with scars that will never fade.  Likewise, Merton, 
although Kate's reluctant accomplice, shares a portion of the 
responsibility, since he wants Kate more than anything.  And Milly, who 
could easily be portrayed as the helpless victim, is given a backbone 
and strength of personality to go along with her love of life.  She is 
willing to do just about anything to capture and hold Merton.</P>
<P>     The trio of actors in the lead roles all perform effectively, using 
facial expressions (Softley employs numerous closeups) and body language 
to highlight the moral ambiguities of their characters.  Helena Bonham 
Carter, who is presented with the difficult task of fashioning a 
sympathetic character whose actions are distasteful, offers an 
emotionally naked portrayal of a woman who makes all the wrong choices.  
Linus Roache (who played the title character in PRIEST) develops Merton 
as a man who suddenly finds that he wants more than he can ever have.  
And, as Milly, Alison Elliott (THE SPITFIRE GRILL) embodies the woman 
about whom James wrote, "She is in love with life, her dreams of it have 
been immense, and she clings to it with passion."  Supporting roles are 
filled by Charlotte Rampling as Kate's cold, stature-conscious aunt; 
Michael Gambon as Kate's penniless, debauched father; and Elizabeth 
McGovern as Milly's companion.</P>
<P>     Much as he did with his adaptation of Thomas Hardy's JUDE THE 
OBSCURE, screenwriter Amini focuses on the emotional aspects of the 
story, detailing how the consequences of each of the characters' actions 
tears at their psyches.  Like JUDE, THE WINGS OF THE DOVE is not a happy 
tale, but it is a vivid and unforgettable one, featuring multi-
dimensional characters, beautiful cinematography, impressive set design, 
and accomplished acting.  THE WINGS OF THE DOVE will surely be one of 
the Fall's most thoughtful and impressive motion picture adaptations of 
a classic novel.</P>
