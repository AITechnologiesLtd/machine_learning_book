<P>         With its lush imagery and muted colors, "Snow Falling on
Cedars" is a first-rate example of a feature film that should have been
a coffee table book instead. Apparently, director Scott Hicks ("Shine")
was so intent on getting the perfect shot of a drop of water sliding off
a fern or in finding bicycle bells that perfectly corresponded to the
sound of Japanese wind chimes he overlooked the fact that most people
who buy tickets to a movie are looking for a story, preferably something
with a little action, romance or humor. Those ingredients are in short
supply in "Snow," but if you want to see how lovingly an amputated arm
can be photographed, by all means, step right up.</P>
<P> Hicks' self-conscious style is crippling to a story which
depends on passion and mystery to hold an audience's attention. Set in
Washington state in 1950, when much of the country was still grappling
with anti-Japanese sentiments left over from WWII, "Snow" follows the
trial of Kazou Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a fisherman accused of murdering an
American. Covering the court proceedings is reporter Ishmael (Ethan
Hawke), whose real interest lies in Miyamoto's wife Hatsue (Youki
Koduh).</P>
<P> Hatsue and Ishmael were childhood sweethearts before the war
but were ultimately torn apart by Japanese traditions and her family's
exile to the Manzanar internment camp. The two barely found time to make
love in a hollowed-out cedar (and you thought back seats were bad!)
before their separation. Nine years later, Ishmael is still nursing his
broken heart.</P>
<P> In its supporting roles, "Snow" employs several reliable
character actors -- James Cromwell, James Rebhorn, Richard Jenkins --
but it seems Hicks' only direction to them was to look as morose as
possible. Hawke, too, is such a Gloomy Gus he's extremely difficult to
identify with and both Ishmael and Hatsue's characters are so sketchy we
never get a sense of any bond between them, aside from the tryst in the
tree perhaps.</P>
<P> The movie proceeds at a lethargic pace as Hicks stacks his
visuals one on top of another, smothering them in echoing dialogue and
an elegiac score by James Newton Howard, all of which keeps us even
further away from any developing drama. Any genuine emotion seems to
have been drained out in the name of art. Even when the camera glides
past scores of soldiers' bodies washed up on the beach at Normandy, the
movie remains so aloof, you might think you're looking at part of a new
campaign for Calvin Klein's Obsession. Like snow itself, the movie is
picturesque but chilly -- and a chore to plow through. James Sanford</P>
