WAKING NED DEVINE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Will it be prison for Jackie and Michael, senior citizens living in a
remote Irish village? Or will it be great riches instead?</P>
<P>It all depends on the success of their big scam in WAKING NED DEVINE.
Honest all of their lives until a great temptation comes their way in
the form of an unclaimed lottery ticket, they are now ready to
prevaricate day and night.</P>
<P>Someone in their little hamlet has won over six million pounds in the
lottery, but who?  With only 52 residents they devise a scheme whereby
they will wine and dine the locals in hopes of getting in the good
graces of the winner.  Along the way they engage in a detective game to
ascertain who the lucky person is.</P>
<P>Veteran actors, Ian Bannen and David Kelly, play Jackie and Michael with
such great gusto that it is obvious that they are having the time of
their lives.  Fionnula Flanagan plays Jackie's wife and co-conspirator.</P>
<P>Eventually Jackie and Michael locate the lucky bloke, one Ned Devine.
He turns out to have suffered a fatal case of excessive luck, having
died in front of his TV when the numbers were chosen.  Jackie and
Michael find him with a big frozen smile on his face and his winning
ticket clinched firmly in his hand.</P>
<P>The rest of the movie has them enlisting the entire town to collude in
hiding Ned's death and convincing the lottery man from the big city that
Michael is Ned.</P>
<P>Will the town pull it off and share in the riches or will their plan
somehow go awry?</P>
<P>WAKING NED DEVINE suffers from an excess of good concept and casting and
a deficit in plot development.  The movie runs on autopilot most of the
time with the townsfolk making small talk and hanging out at the local
pub.  Scenes of naked octogenarian males on motorcycles are certainly
different, which is not the same thing as interesting.</P>
<P>A good-spirited film, it features lovely pictures of the Irish coastline
and countryside.  Although there is nothing wrong with the picture, it
is rarely compelling.  Without much of an ending, the film basically
just stops.  We are left with some nice characterizations but a series
of missed opportunities in the script development.  A pleasant enough
movie, it could and should have been more successful.</P>
<P>WAKING NED DEVINE runs about 1:30.  It is not rated but probably would
be an R for brief scenes of full-frontal male nudity and would be fine
for teenagers.</P>
