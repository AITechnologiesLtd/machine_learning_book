Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>Well, with "Enemy of the State," the new Jerry Bruckheimer-produced and 
Tony Scott-directed action picture, two things are certain: this film is 
five times better than Bruckheimer's previous embarrassment, 
"Armageddon," and Scott is a much better director than "Armageddon" 
alumni, Michael Bay. Of course, that isn't to say that, "Enemy of the 
State," is actually good. It's just saying that it isn't terrible.</P>
<P>In a refreshing change of pace from usually playing a comedic role, Will 
Smith stars as Robert Dean, a high-pofile lawyer with a loving wife 
(Regina King) and young son (Jascha Washington) living in Georgetown, 
Maryland, who finds his pleasant life quickly start to crumble around 
him. While in a lingerie store buying something for his wife for 
Christmas, a former college friend (Jason Lee) of his bursts in, tries 
to tell him something, and then while Robert isn't looking, drops a 
piece of incriminating evidence into his shopping bag that is proof that 
the National Security Agency murdered a congressman (Jason Robards, who 
appears unbilled) for opposing a Telecommunications Security and Privacy 
Act. Immediately afterwards, the friend is hit by a truck and killed 
while being chased by the NSA. After Robert is linked to the tape that 
shows the murder, his clothes unknowingly are bugged, and he must leave 
his wife and go on the run, even though he does not know what they want, 
at first.</P>
<P>The premise of, "Enemy of the State," is a complex one, to be sure, as 
it also includes a subplot involving Robert and his former girlfriend 
(Lisa Bonet), which I personally found more interesting than the central 
storyline. For the first hour, I was intrigued by, "Enemy of the State," 
and surprised that it wasn't simply a non-stop action movie without any 
character development. The setup for the film was entertaining and 
clever enough, and I liked the relationship set up between Smith and 
Regina King, who is a criminally underrated actress. Meanwhile, Smith 
and Bonet, who I was happy to see again after her absence since the 
cancellation of, "The Cosby Show," had a few nice scenes together. And 
Smith himself, was surprisingly appealing. It is good to see him try a 
more dramatic, challenging role, so he is one step in the right 
direction to being a true breakthrough film star. Gene Hackman has a 
supporting role as Brill, a former agency operative who has been in 
hiding since 1980, who tries to help Robert, but makes very little 
impact.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the main story, although somewhat thought-provoking when 
dealing with the idea that there is so much high-tech spying equipment 
and cameras nowadays that, for all we know, we might be being watched 
non-stop, the conventional action stuff comes into full-blast in the 
second hour, and to me, it took on a definite "been-there-done-that" 
feeling. This sort of conventional chase picture has been done to death, 
and I think the filmmakers could have thought of something a little more 
original than ending it with a boring shoot-out sequence. It also didn't 
help that the movie could have easily been shortened by at least fifteen 
minutes.</P>
<P>What it all comes down to is that, "Enemy of the State," is a step up 
for Bruckheimer, but is still not very successful, as it still has many 
of his trademarks: a frenetic pace, odd camera angles, and a bunch of 
supporting characters who are only there to sit in chairs and read 
things from monitors. "Enemy of the State," is a sure sign that 
Bruckheimer might one day be able to make a really good film. That is, 
if he learns to focus more on the story, rather than a bunch of 
explosions. </P>
