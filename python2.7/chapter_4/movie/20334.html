<P> In a review of Clue I restated the well-known fact that Hollywood is
unpredictable.  Clue was a good example, but Bowfinger is a perfect one.  As
much as Hollywood doesn't like to admit it, it's a highly touchy group.
Movies that are politically risky are ignored.  Movies that question the
system are feared.  This, by the way, explains Oscar snubs for movies like
The Truman Show, Chasing Amy, Mother Night, Lolita, Smoke Signals, and
countless others.</P>
<P> As touchy as Hollywood is, it can always surprise with the capability to do
something completely bizarre and unexpected.  Case in point: Bowfinger.
Yeah, it's childish.   Yeah, the jokes are cheap.  But guess what's the nip
of the jokes... Hollywood itself.</P>
<P> Not since Get Shorty has Hollywood dared to take itself out and beat itself
up.  Its a universal constant that no one wants to admit that they are
hypocrites (the particular breed of person that makes up most of the true
power in Hollywood), and movies like Bowfinger expose the hypocrisy of
Hollywood in a very public way.</P>
<P> Bowfinger centers around Robert Bowfinger (Steve Martin), failed movie
producer who decides to give it one last go after reading the script for a
movie "Chubby Rain", a highly B-movie science fiction yarn that gets its
title from the fact that the rain becomes chubby as the aliens fall to Earth
encased in it.  Bowfinger decides that he needs superstar Kit Ramsey (Eddie
Murphy) in the film in order to make it work, and, when Kit doesn't want to
be in it, Bowfinger decides to film him without his knowledge.</P>
<P> He enlists a failed stage actress Carol (Christine Baranski), a crew
composed of illegal immigrants (the funniest moment in the movie comes as
INS does a roost of a field while people are motioned into a van to work on
the movie), an actress from Ohio who knows what you really need to do to get
ahead in Tinsel Town (best described in the single line acceptance speech
for an Emmy winning Oscar telecast "I'm sorry I didn't have to sleep around
to get this part") played by the always fun to watch Heather Graham and a
wannabe cinematographer named Dave (Jamie Kennedy).</P>
<P> The sad thing about Bowfinger is that, for all of its hard work and
perseverance of making fun of moviemaking, the people in it have such an
obvious allure towards the industry that they ultimately fail at their goal.
There is no incredible sense that you are laughing at Hollywood in general.
You just laugh at Bobby Bowfinger et al.</P>
<P> It seems particularly ironic, though; that a film that had such perfect
potential for skewering the Hollywood system was ultimately trapped by it.
That, in being both anti-Hollywood and Hollywood at the same time, it comes
out with only good one liners and gags.  And, as we all know, good
one-liners do not a movie make.</P>
<P> Another particular irony is that, as Bobby Bowfinger is so often the but of
the movie's jokes, Steve Martin seems to be the but of the joke of the
movie.  He seems to not be able to go beyond being a charicature.  Daisy
(Heather Graham) does go beyond her character, but not enough to make up for
the lack of personality that Bobby Bowfinger has.</P>
<P> Oh well.  These things happen too often and too well.  Such ends up being
the fate of people brave enough to be working against the industry that they
have worked with for so many years.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
