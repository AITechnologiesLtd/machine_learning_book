<PRE>Evaluation **** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>High Noon is a Western. Yet while comfortably residing in this cinematic
niche, it transcends the typical spaghetti Western by creating a story far
more intricate than cowboys and Indians. The Western as a film medium is by
its very nature a remnant of America's dirty little imperialist past. As a
result, the idea of the Western seems to connote ideas of prejudice and
perhaps even genocide. High Noon, however, does not pander to the audience's
expectations of a Western; instead, we find a revisionist film with a female
Mexican shopkeeper, few shootouts, and a hero whose intentions are unclear.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most obvious stereotype-breaking element in High Noon is found
in the character of Helen Ramirez. Helen is the strongest person in the
town. This fact may be overlooked by her decision to leave the town. But in
her relationships with people it is clear that she is the more powerful.
There are also more subtle ways in which she shows her strength – for one,
she is the only character in town who accepts and understands Will Kane's
decision to stay. It is also important to note that while the character of
Helen Ramirez is certainly uncommon in the films of High Noon's era and
genre, her role is effortlessly convincing, unlike some politically correct
presidents appearing in movies lately.</P>
<P>One should not overlook other ways in which High Noon defies
conventionality, either. The character of Will Kane seems to break just as
many rules as the character of Helen Ramirez. Kane never chases his enemies
in the film; enemies chase him. Even in the movie's lone gunfight, Kane is
always in retreat throughout the scene (though this may also be attributed
to the fact that he is outnumbered). This retreat, the unwillingness to
confront the other members of the gang before Frank Miller's arrival, is
both a result and reflection of the town's own withdrawal.</P>
<P>There's a poignant scene near the end of the film when Will Kane essentially
awaits his execution. The camera starts with a close-up of Kane and then
cranes dramatically away form him, heightening the sense of Kane's
desolation/abandonment. What is particularly stunning, however, is the
exaggerated movements of Will Kane; his eyes are wide open and dart back and
forth, he blinks involuntarily, he makes a feint to his guns, and wipes the
sweat from his brow and with a deliberate movement, flicks his fear into the
ground. Kane in this scene shows a great amount of fear, and we find our
hero is full of doubt. High Noon does not let us take the hero for granted;
instead, it questions whether the hero did the right thing by staying.</P>
