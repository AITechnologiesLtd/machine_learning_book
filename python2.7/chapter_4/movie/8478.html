<P>For Sony Pictures to put "Dream With the Fishes" in the "Classics" group
is a bit of a stretch. A small picture in budget and production values, it
is also small on ambitions. But it is a somewhat offbeat buddy movie,
perhaps bizarre for the 1990s but quite close to certain films of the
hippie days.</P>
<P>Scriptwriter and now first-time director Finn Taylor has concocted a
relatively brief encounter of two youngish men from different backgrounds.
Terry is a "suit," a sad-sack accountant-type (with my apologies to that
profession). We get no details or explanations about the man, his
character, or his life, but it is clear that unspecified insecurities,
sexual frustrations and such have made him very lonely. Whether a result of
those deep seated problems or of others, Terry has become a binocularized
voyeur. From his apartment he spies on the apartments across the street,
catching especially female nudity. It is joyless, unexciting voyeurism
rather than "Rear Window" curiosity or esthetic appreciation and
gratification.</P>
<P>Soon we meet Terry on the Golden Gate Bridge as he prepares to jump. By an
unlikely movie-coincidence, Nick, a stranger whose girl-friend Liz Terry
"voyeurizes" most, is around on the bridge.He talks him out of this manner
of suicide, suggesting with some black humor better ways. He takes him to
his place. Terry blurts out that the death of his wife in a car accident
had made his life meaningless. (It's not that simple but I'll keep mum).</P>
<P>After some unconvincing stuff involving Terry's watch, it is traded with
Nick for a bottle of sleeping pills. But after swallowing them, Terry
changes his mind. When his stomach is pumped he finds out that the pills
were multi-vitamins.</P>
<P>The undead Terry is furious at Nick. (Why? A good question since "practical
joke" aside, Terry had balked before suicide). He finds out that Nick has
an unnamed disease and only weeks to live. One thing leads to another.
Nick, wishing to fulfill his fantasies before he dies, proposes that Terry
bankroll him and join him in living life "on the edge." This will be good
for both men. The ultimate bonus is that Nick promises to kill Terry at the
end of their explorations.</P>
<P>The Kevorkianish pact is a done deal. It's all the more incredible as
earlier Terry apparently wanted to go on living. Or did I miss something?
It was perhaps the method (suicide-by-pills) he had rejected.</P>
<P>The two new companions embark on a small-scale series of desultory
wanderings that hardly deserve to be called a Micro-Odyssey. Early on, high
on acid, they go to what's like an amusement park. Unless you know San
Francisco and identify Fisherman's Wharf it could be anywhere.(The same
goes for all settings). The episode is a stoned variant of the old
boy-dates-girl and my oh my, aren't amusement parks fun! A fortune-teller
tells Nick : "In three weeks you'll be given the job of protecting the life
of all the fishes." Since "to be with the fishes" means -- at least in
gangster films-- that a victim was executed and thrown in the waters, the
expression is none too relevant here.</P>
<P>Life on the edge is a pathetic affair. It involves bowling in the nude
(with women); visiting Nick's Auntie, a retired stripper; seeing Nick's
alienated father; meeting an old failure of a pal; and other such
unexciting activities. They crest with Nick, nearing his end, trying to rob
a bank in the nude.</P>
<P>In my notes I often find the word "uninteresting." That's what all the
characters are. Realistic-naturalist--untheatrical acting can be a good
thing but loses its value when characters and situations lack interest.</P>
<P>The strongest element here is death, which was called "the ultimate
obscenity" by, I believe, writer Albert Camus. No matter to whom it comes,
death is death. In movies, audiences rejoice at the death of villains. In
movies at least, death becomes more affecting, pathetic or tragic when it
happens to heroic characters, good persons, innocent individual or masses,
or simply to interesting persons. And even with many negative types, there
can the sadness of those left behind. In "Dream" there's very little of all
this. We also sense that Nick will not be really missed, even by Liz whom
he marries on his death bed.</P>
<P>Terry alone will miss him. The finale combines an unlikely bit about
Terry's watch and the predictable conclusion that Nick's life-affirming
love of just being, will make a new, unsuicidal man of Terry. However, the
movie's moving side is that step-by-weird-step, true friendship has grown
between the two protagonists. Shown without sentimentality, this is the
film's main value.</P>
<P>Technically "Dream" is fuzzy. Whether deliberately, to go for a realistic
look in defiance of studio precision, or from amateurishness, I can't tell.
Camera movements can be jerky, colors often poor or washed out, the
lighting inadequate. Work like this one that strive for a semi-documentary
look (e.g. using just existing light), would be better off in black and
white that tolerates contrasts better. Yes, I know that, sadly, viewers
generally do not like black and white. But many connoisseurs do, and this
is a film that will be seen by art house, not mainstream, audiences.</P>
