5 Star Rating: * * * *</PRE>
<P>In Brief: Fun, enjoyable, amusing and touching…but maybe a tad over-rated.</P>
<P>THE FULL MONTY, I believe, has become the most successful British film of
all time, surpassing FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL which previously held that
distinction. To be honest, its success is perhaps a bit baffling -- I mean
it certainly has a lot going for it (a lot more than its title or premise
would seem to suggest) but it's not the type of film that seems to thrive
in the Film industry nowadays. It's low-key, understated, with no real
big-star names (perhaps excepting Robert Carlyle), no big action scenes, or
no gimmicky special effects. Unfortunately, that's the kind of film that
seems to be most popular these days, and low-key character pieces tend to
slip by unnoticed, regardless of how good they are.</P>
<P>In a way, the success garnered by THE FULL MONTY is quite encouraging. It
goes to show that we're capable of watching and enjoying something other
than the brainless or violent mediocrity than generally tends to
proliferate Hollywood. THE FULL MONTY is a quiet, rather unassuming
character drama (touted as more of a comedy, I know) which has heart. Let's
face it, though, based on its premise -- unemployed guys who decide to
become strippers -- it doesn't exactly sound enthralling. If it hadn't been
for its critical and commercial success, I very much doubt I'd have had the
urge to go and see it.</P>
<P>But it takes a potentially iffy premise and builds on it, adding some
emotional resonance and milking it for all the humour its worth. It has to
be said that as a comedy, THE FULL MONTY isn't one of the funniest I've
seen. The humour is very much understated, and whilst some may find this
disappointing, it's still quite effective. However, the film's biggest
triumph is the adept way it portrays an ensemble of interesting,
three-dimensional and very human characters. It avoids lapsing into
redundant sentimentality but still manages to be quietly touching. It
touches upon some very real issues that affect real people, such as
divorce, impotence, and unemployment. It looks at how we tend to value
ourselves on the jobs we have and the money we make, and how losing that
stability can shatter one's self esteem.</P>
<P>The film follows several blokes who have recently lost their jobs, and they
decide to become male strippers. The justification is rather flimsy, but
it's merely a plot device - the real gist of it is them reclaiming their
sense of self-worth, realising that it's basically up to you whether you
lose your sense of purpose or simply move on in life. That's a relevant,
important message to get across, and I suspect that's why the film has
struck a chord in so many people. It's a feel-good film, not too reliant on
its slippery plot nor its humour as much as its undertones of optimism.</P>
<P>THE FULL MONTY boasts some charismatic performances by its solid cast,
including Robert Carlyle, who gives his characteristically understated, yet
compelling performance. Directing-wise it's certainly proficient, if
perhaps lacking much visual flair. As far as production goes, well, it's
not a film that required a huge budget, and all the more effective for it,
being eloquent in its simplicity. </P>
<P>The more I think about this one, the more I like it. But it's not, as some
suggest, one of the very best films ever made. It takes a good while to get
going, and the plot itself is pretty thin. The humour, as I've noted, feels
rather restrained, and as well-played and poignant as it is, the character
drama often lacks the emotion to give it real punch. What makes THE FULL
MONTY so enjoyable is, to a large extent, the reasoning behind the plot.
The story's wonderfully optimistic, feel-good underpinnings are both
inspiring and uplifting. And that more than overcomes the film's (few)
shortcomings.</P>
