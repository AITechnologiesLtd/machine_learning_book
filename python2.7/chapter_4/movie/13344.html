<P>  In "Gone With the Wind," which is now enjoying a revival
with a spruced-up sound track, Rhett Butler says to Scarlett
O'Hara, "You need kissing."  Substitute the word the studios
would use in the 90s for what David O. Selznick chose for the
30s and you'll get an idea of what Butler believes would make
Scarlett a happier person.  This speculation carries over to
Benoit Jacquot's "Seventh Heaven," or in the French, "Le
Septieme Ciel."  Jacquot, fascinated by his psychoanalytic
readings on the role of the unconscious, focuses on a 28-
year-old anhedonic woman, unable to experience pleasure in
life, presumably because she has never had an orgasm.  The
picture takes her up to and through her first--and
second--period of sexual bliss and how her sudden change
affects her husband.</P>
<P>   If you did not get to see "Bliss," last year's most underrated
movie, you can take in Jacquot's film, the closest thing to
Lance Young's creation.  "Seventh Heaven" has a similar
theme with parts that seem virtually plagiarized from that
genuinely fascinating work which was filmed in 1995.
"Bliss" focuses on a nonorgasmic wife who joins an army of
women seeking help from a sex therapist, Baltazar (played
wonderfully by Terence Stamp).  When she is swiftly
liberated, her husband becomes suspicious, follows her to the
analyst's studio, and has a violent showdown with the good
doctor.  "Bliss" is sometimes clinical but at its core is full of
action, a swiftly-moving often quite humorous take on the
profession of psychoanalysis and a showcase for Mr. Stamp's
considerable talents.</P>
<P>   Unfortunately, "Seventh Heaven" does not approach its
prototype in any regard.  Shot virtually in real time as is this
director's inclination, it is yet another example of arty French
film.  It's talky and clinical, loaded with the sort of stuff with
which novels and perhaps the stage do a better job. 
Its principal character, Mathilde (Sandrine Kiberlain) has none
of the appeal of the gorgeous Virginie Ledoyen.  Ledoyen's
star-making performance in Jacquot's 1995 film "A Single Girl"
fashioned a bright slice-of-life story about a 19-year-old
woman who faces pressure in her job as a room service
waitress in a fancy hotel.  When a smile crosses Kimberlain's
face--which it does only in the final segments of the
movie--she's captivating.  In other scenes her wall-eyed
asymmety dampens potential audience appeal.</P>
<P>   Kiberlain, the 28-year-old wife of a surgeon eleven years
her senior, is first seen as a blurred image on the camera, an
obvious metaphor for her clouded mind.  She walks the
streets of Paris in much the way that Julianne Moore's Carol
White wanders around her own home in Todd Haynes's
"Safe": eclipsed as though her body has been taken over by
impurities that deaden her chance for joy.  She shoplifts
aimlessly, stuffing the toys into a trash bag at home; faints
when she's caught or else for no apparent reason; and one
day runs into a strange man on the street who calls himself a
hypnotist and invites her to an expensive restaurant for her
first session.  This doctor (Francois Berleand), a serious man
who never smiles, urges her to practice feng shui, a Chinese
system of living harmoniously. Though moving her bed to face
a recommended direction does not help her to attain orgasm,
a second session does.  When her husband Nico (Vincent
Lindon) beholds his own success in giving her pleasure in
bed, he becomes ironically turned off, scared, as though she
were doing this to show him her independence.  His anxiety
drives him into the office of another hypnotist and into a
confrontation with a man he believes to be his wife's
practitioner--the only comical episode in the story.</P>
<P>   To Jacquot's credit he occasionally summons some of the
mystery of Alfred Hitchcock, particularly as we observe the
strange encounter between Mathilde and the doctor on the
street.  We wonder what the man has in mind by escorting
her to a salmon-and-wine luncheon, why he insists on her
paying him in cash, what he will do with the ring she leaves
with him as a security deposit.  Ultimately, little is made of
these incidents which are supposed to be taken as clues to
the doctor's character, nor are we really clear on husband
Nico's paradoxical reaction to his wife's new and giving
personality (unless this successful surgeon is aghast that she
could be so independent-minded).</P>
<P>   The film is decently acted by Vincent Lindon as the
bewildered husband who, like physicians everywhere, cannot
tolerate the existence of alternative therapies.  Jacquot,
hwoever, is too vague throughout.  He states, in an inteview,
that his girls "are born to be alone, and they find their
freedom knowing they are alone."   What freedom?  Mathilde
is an unhappy woman who finds pleasure only when she
finally connects.  When she is "free" of others, she is sickly
and overrun with a compulsion to steal.  People talk as they
might in real life, not really advancing the plot as much as
dropping sound bites about the healthful properties of sex and
union.  Finally, "Seventh Heaven" is as pretentious and
serious as the two hynotherapists employed by the fragile
couple.</P>
