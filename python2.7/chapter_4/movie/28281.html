BREAD AND ROSES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>BREAD AND ROSES, by director Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty, who 
collaborated last on MY NAME IS JOE, tells a fictional story with a 
documentary feel about organizing L. A. janitors.  Two of the story's 
three leads are sisters who work as non-union janitors in a typical 
skyscraper.  One sister, Maya (Pilar Padilla), is idealistically and 
bravely pro-union, whereas the other, Rosa (Elpidia Carrillo), is 
pragmatically and just as bravely anti-union.  Both are completely 
believable and deliver strong performances, but Carrillo steals the 
movie in a long dramatic scene towards the end.</P>
<P>We see the workers verbally abused and threatened as they attempt to 
organize.  Although the bosses draw most of the writer's fire for 
underpaying the janitors, the leaders of the union are criticized in one 
scene in which the union organizer complains that the money they raise 
will be thrown away like the $40,000,000 that the unions gave last year 
to the Democrats.</P>
<P>Although it is a powerful film at times, Loach makes two strategic 
mistakes that significantly and needlessly detract from its message.  
The first is the casting of Adrien Brody as Sam, the paid union 
organizer.  Brody, a Tom Green look-alike who darts around like Harpo 
Marx, gives the movie a comedic side that is jarringly out of place with 
the rest of the drama.  </P>
<P>The second mistake concerns the subtitles.  Since the characters would 
naturally speak a mixture of English and Spanish, Loach keeps switching 
the language that is being subtitled.  In theory this may sound 
sensible, but in practice it is a disaster.  If you try to read the 
subtitles and they turn out to be in a language you don't understand, 
then, by the time you stop reading and start listening, you've missed 
the first few words of the sentence and are frequently unable to parse 
what is being said.  The reverse is true if you're listening carefully, 
only to realize that you should have been reading.  Since these switches 
may occur several times per minute, it is hard to keep track of the 
dialog.  If Loach felt that dual language subtitling were necessary, 
there are two ways that would have solved the problem.  Either have both 
languages subtitled all of the time -- Films shown in multilingual 
countries like Switzerland do this -- or use different colors with, say, 
white for English and yellow for Spanish.  </P>
<P>"I believe in nothing but this," says Rosa, holding up her hand to her 
sister.  BREAD AND ROSES makes some powerful points for the union while 
reminding us of everyone's believe in self-reliance.  Were it not for 
the miscasting of the comical Adrien Brody in a serious part and for the 
distracting and constant switching of subtitles, I would have been able 
to recommend BREAD AND ROSES.</P>
<P>BREAD AND ROSES runs 1:50.  It is rated R for strong language and brief 
nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens in nationwide release in the United States on Friday, 
June 1, 2001.  In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera 
Cinemas.</P>
