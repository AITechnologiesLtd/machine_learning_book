<P>      Perhaps there are a few moviegoers who've been anxiously anticipating
their chance to watch Michael Keaton break his own thumb and operate on his
own wounded leg. Maybe these are the same unfortunate few who've dreamed of
the day they'll see Andy Garcia plow through an emergency room on a
motorcycle and get shot through the armpit. Well, folks, your ship has come
in: All this and much, much more await you in "Desperate Measures," an
astoundingly inept thriller that's easily the worst movie ever directed by
Barbet Schroeder ("Reversal of Fortune") and may well prove to be an
all-time low for everyone else involved with it.</P>
<P>David Klass' screenplay is set in San Francisco, although for all the
sense it makes Wonderland might have been a more credible locale. Garcia,
who has now played a cop as often as Teri Garr has played a dizzy housewife,
is cast as Frank Connor, a lawman obsessed with finding a compatible donor
whose bone marrow could save his dying son Matt (Joseph Cross). Jailbird
Peter McCabe (Keaton) seems to be the only one in the world whose marrow
matches, so Connor pulls strings and springs McCabe for a day on the
operating table.</P>
<P>But somehow everyone completely forgot that not only is McCabe a
psychotic, he's also an evil genius who earned his doctorate while in
prison. Who knew?! McCabe escapes, torches a few nurses, shoots some cops
and miraculously manages to hack into the hospital's computer system with
only a couple of keystrokes.
But McCabe's not smart enough to bandage a bleeding leg, which leaves a
trail for his pursuers to follow, or to realize that if you want to go
unnoticed in a medical facility smoking in the hallway is not the best idea.</P>
<P>While Matt's life hangs by a thread, Connor hunts down McCabe (who must
be brought back alive in order for theoperation to proceed), and "Desperate
Measures" blossoms into awe-inspiring absurdity, with random explosions,
ridiculous car chases down the least congested freeways California has ever
seen, and a few bizarre comic inserts from McCabe that are almost as funny
as, well, a bone marrow transplant. After about 100 minutes, Schroeder
simply stops the madness without bothering to give it any sort of proper
ending, perhaps figuring few viewers would bother sticking around for the
finale anyhow.</P>
<P>"Desperate Measures" also deserves special condemnation as one of the
ugliest-looking films in years. The entire picture is drenched in washed-out
blues and greys, as if Tri-Star didn't bother paying the lab bill to have
the visuals color-corrected. Certainly that would have been the easiest part
of this fiasco to fix: The rest of it is far beyond repair.
