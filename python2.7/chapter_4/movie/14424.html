<P>starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Lili Taylor, Brendan Sexton
III
written and directed by John Waters</P>
<P>I wish so badly I could call myself a John Waters fan. His brand of
outrageousness is gleefully offensive and wholly sincere; Waters'
gross-out tendencies are his second-nature. It is his emotional
detachment, rather than his penchant for the perverse, that turns me
off. PECKER starts out promising, and it is a warm-hearted movie, I
suppose, but ultimately Waters goes through his standard
motions-suburbia as sideshow. </P>
<P>T2's Furlong stars as Pecker, nicknamed so because he eats like a
bird. He is an obsessive photographer, snapping anything that falls
before his lens. His girlfriend, Shelly (Ricci), is a bitter
laundromat manager; his big sister (Martha Plimpton) works at a gay
strip bar; his best bud (Sexton) is a professional shop lifter; his
grandmother (Jean Schertler) does a Charlie McCarthy routine with a
Virgin Mary puppet; his little sister is addicted to sugar (as
Chrissy, Lauren Hulsey thieves every scene she's in); and so on. They
are all his subjects; when one of his exhibits is observed in a
Baltimore sandwich shop by Rorey (Taylor), a traveling New York art
dealer, Pecker and co. pack it up and head for the big city, where
they cause quite a stir. Rorey is allured by Pecker's naivete,
lavishes him with money and gifts. The impact is negative: the people
of his hometown begin to resent Pecker's success. </P>
<P>Scenes of Pecker taking pictures with his beaten up camera are
inspiring and amusing. (His work is terrific.) The trouble is, that's
all there is to Pecker: he is a shutter-happy machine. While Furlong
is likable in the role, his character is never anything more than a
nice guy with an awe-shucks demeanor that contradicts his
surroundings. As well, the culture clash between the Manhattanites and
the 'Baltimore Hillbillies' that transpires is disappointingly
obvious. Waters has given the film a more realistic look than some of
his beach movie-coloured fantasies of the past, which is why some
scenes-like a surrealistic advertisement for Ritalin-induce more
discomfort than laughs: they feel out of place and laboured. Yet I was
never less than entertained by PECKER--the cast looks like it's having
a ball--and it's sure to start THE new term: teabagging. (I'll let
your imagination run wild.) Fine Line Pictures, which is releasing the
film, certainly agrees: after the press screening, they passed out
teabags inscribed with the "Pecker" logo. </P>
<P>In this scatalogically-desensitized landscape, the most shocking thing
Waters could do these days is make a movie without any repulsive
jokes. Like Pecker, perhaps he should take a more observational
approach: in 1998, reality is much weirder than his blatant cinematic
universe. </P>
