                         A LITTLE PRINCESS 1995
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                   3 :-) :-) :-)  for sugar and spice</PRE>
<P>Cast: Liesel Matthews, Eleanor Bron, Liam Cunningham, Vanessa Lee
Chester, Errol Sitahal Director: Alfonso Cuaron Screenplay: Richard
LaGravanese and Elizabeth Chandler based on the novel SARA CREWE by
Frances Hodgson Burnett</P>
<P>Strip away the pink petty coats, frills and white lace and you're left
with a pair of shiny silk stockings. Like these stockings, this movie
shines a star or two above the mundane nylon/cotton crap giving the
general public an outbreak of jock itch, and other fungal infections. "A
Little Princess" is like a gem hidden beneath layers of sugar and spice,
and everything nice. Just don't choke on the rock when you guzzle down
the desert.</P>
<P>I was enchanted by the sweet experience of growing up in a fairy tale
world, where the niceties of living include having an adorable father
who adores you even more. This is the story of a child who goes from
riches to rags, with a life and death experience thrown in somewhere
between. Despite being maltreated and traumatised, this orphan keeps her
dignity and compassion throughout the ordeal. She holds firm to her
belief that every child is "A Little Princess" - meaning that all
children are special, despite their circumstance. This message holds
true with every child, but can the same be said in ten years time when
they grow into bratty, selfish teenagers? Or in thirty years time when
they develop power hungry tendencies? By sixty they should all have some
form of coronary heart disease.</P>
<P>I was impressed by the brazen colours, the bold images and insightful
themes. The most potent point in the movie is when the orphan girl
confronts her tormentor, the spinster head mistress, with a powerful
statement - "Didn't your father ever tell you that you were a princess?"
The Mistress's face grows cold, her eyes narrow and she storms out of
the room in a fit of rage - evidently not. All children are like royalty
when they enter the world, but depending on how they live their life,
the same cannot be said about them when they make a hasty exit.</P>
<P>This is an exceptional true to life story for children of all ages. Well
recommended and much enjoyed.</P>
