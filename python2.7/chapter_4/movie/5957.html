<P>     Pam Grier as a transsexual in ESCAPE FROM L.A.?  Ellen Barkin as a
Sports Babe sportscaster in THE FAN??  Marlon Brando impersonating a
Polynesian circus tent in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU???  We've had no
shortage of strange sights this summer and, yet, none may be as weird as
what ends CARPOOL, an excruciatingly dumb kiddie flick that puts five
brats and two adults (Tom Arnold and David Paymer) in a minivan and
chases them by the police under the guise of a hostage situation.  Tom
Arnold plays the crazed carnival owner with a gun, while Paymer attempts
an exasperated advertising executive.  Together, they provide the
running commentary during such silly set-pieces as a mosey through the
middle of an indoor shopping mall.  Groan, he says, remembering that THE
BLUES BROTHERS did it first and better.</P>
<P>     Only in the final reel does CARPOOL warrant a walk-out.  A runaway
Ferris wheel signals the beginning of the end-- an atrocious two-part
finale where the story tries to get serious.  Paymer playing Spiderman
and climbing a carnival ride is a sight to behold, but none is more
strange, more weird, and more utterly unexpected than that of Rod
Steiger's grumpy grocery store owner expounding upon the delights of a
chocolate donut.  Don't ask.  The movie is bad, the endings are
terrible, and, after a mere ten minutes of screen time, Mr. Steiger has
managed to sink even lower than his Cuban- accented turn in the stinky
SPECIALIST.  Directed by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
President Arthur Hiller, who proves what Paymer's character says on the
subject of carpools:  "They're not supposed to be fun." (Rated "PG"/93
min.)</P>
