<P>     Los Angeles has now been destroyed twice in one summer.  Is this 
wish fulfillment for audiences or for the men and women who make movies?  
Either way, both apocalyptic scenarios are visually impressive, offering 
arrays of death and disaster as L.A. is reduced to a smoldering shadow 
of what it once was.  In John Carpenter's ESCAPE FROM L.A., the cause is 
a mega-earthquake, not an alien attack as in INDEPENDENCE DAY, but the 
results are similar.  </P>
<P>     The prologue to ESCAPE FROM L.A. takes place shortly after the 
conclusion of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.  On August 23, 2000, the "big one" 
hits the west coast, severing Los Angeles from the mainland.  The new 
President of the Moral United States (Cliff Robertson, giving an eerily 
Reagan-esque performance) declares that L.A. is no longer part of the 
country.  It becomes the deportation zone to which all those convicted 
of moral crimes are sent.  Los Angeles is viewed as an island of 
depravity and violence, populated by psychos, criminals, and other 
assorted weirdoes -- not that different, some would argue, from what 
it's like today.</P>
<P>     Fast forward to 2013, where we once again meet the infamous 
criminal, Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell, reprising the role he first 
essayed 15 years ago).  For a second time, the government needs him for 
a rescue-and-retrieval mission.  This time, the object of his quest 
isn't a person, but a thing.  The President's daughter, Utopia (A. J. 
Langer), has stolen the remote control unit for a doomsday weapon and 
given it to a guerrilla leader (George Corraface) on Los Angeles Island.  
So Snake, who has been injected with a virus that leaves him ten hours 
to live, has to go in, complete his mission, and escape to get the 
antidote.  </P>
<P>     If this premise sounds an awful lot like that of ESCAPE FROM NEW 
YORK, it's no coincidence.  John Carpenter isn't just making a sequel to 
the 1981 cult classic, but, armed with a considerable budget, he's also 
doing a partial remake (much like the tactic employed by Robert 
Rodriguez with EL MARIACHI and the subsequent DESPERADO).  ESCAPE FROM 
L.A. follows an almost-identical trajectory to its predecessor, only 
this time all the action takes place against the backdrop of the 
Hollywood Hills rather than under the shadow of the World Trade Center. </P>
<P>     All things considered, ESCAPE FROM L.A. is a significant 
improvement over the first Snake Plisskin adventure.  The action 
sequences are better paced and directed.  The erratic, tongue-in-cheek 
comedy of NEW YORK is back, but, in this picture, it is supplemented by 
a barbed satire of family values and political correctness.  Best of 
all, however, the basic premise is satisfactorily explored rather than 
just existing as a jumping-off point.  In the previous outing, Snake was 
dropped in the midst of a generic New York that could have been any 
abandoned city.  Here, Los Angeles is clearly Los Angeles (or, more 
appropriately, what's left of Los Angeles), and we are given a tour of 
both the changed geography and the bizarre cultures rising from the 
ashes.  This aspect of the movie, rather than any other, makes ESCAPE 
FROM L.A. a more fascinating piece of film making.</P>
<P>     There's a shade less atmosphere in L.A. than in NEW YORK, but the 
production values and set design in the sequel are still top-notch.  
There are some truly breathtaking sequences, such as the spectacle of a 
tsunami bearing down on the coast or an overhead shot of what became of 
Disneyland.  Borrowing from BLADE RUNNER and other futuristic features, 
Carpenter has made ESCAPE FROM L.A. visually striking, and, if audiences 
aren't already exhausted by this summer's other action fare, it should 
play well.</P>
<P>     The only returning actor is Kurt Russell, who slips effortlessly 
into his character as if a decade-and-a-half hadn't passed.  Little has 
changed -- Snake still talks with a Clint Eastwood-like rasp, sports a 
heavy five o'clock shadow, and openly despises authority.  It's a 
tribute to Russell that, after so long, he can accurately and 
effectively re-create his first action role.  Though Snake may have 
aged, the self-deprecating, angry core that makes him more than a mere 
caricature hasn't changed one bit.</P>
<P>     The supporting players are all new.  Most of them aren't on screen 
for very long, and, as a result, don't leave much of an impression.  
Bruce Campbell, for instance, has a wacky two-minute sequence as the 
Surgeon General of Beverly Hills, then isn't seen again.  Valerie 
Golino, Pam Grier, and Peter Fonda fall into the same near-cameo 
category.  Steve Buscemi plays another in his gallery of strange people 
-- a double-crossing "Map of the Stars" salesman.  George Corraface 
isn't a very effective villain, especially compared to Isaac Hayes' Duke 
of New York (although they both drive similar style cars).  Stacey Keach 
is the top military honcho in charge of sending Snake into L.A.  
Suitably hard-bitten, he's a worthy successor to the late Lee Van Cleef.</P>
<P>     ESCAPE FROM L.A. is the first sequel directed by Carpenter, and, as 
such, represents a change of direction.  It's also the best film he's 
done in quite some time, although considering his recent resume -- 
VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, and THEY LIVE -- that's 
not saying much.  Will Snake be back again?  Probably not, but if he 
does return, at least there's no shortage of possibilities for the 
title.  Anyone for ESCAPE FROM CHICAGO?</P>
