<PRE>EUREKA
------</PRE>
<P>Brother and sister Naoki (Masaru Miyazaki) and Kozue (Aoi Miyazaki, "One 
Summer's Day") leave their rural Japanese home for school as their mother
waves
in the distance.  They board a bus which snakes along country roads.  One
quick edit later and that bus' windows are covered in newspaper, all other
passengers save the bus driver Makoto (Koji Yakusho, "Shall We Dance?")
are dead and a crazed hijacker (Go Riju) talks to police on his
cell phone while ruminating on Naoki and Kozue's fate in writer/director
Shinji Aoyama's Cannes 2000 Ecumenical Jury prize winner "Eureka."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Makoto bravely saves the day and he and the children survive the horrific
event only to watch their lives unravel.  Naoki and Kozue's mother leaves
their home for another man after being beaten by their father, who kills
himself in a drunken car wreck.  The two children withdraw from society,
cease speaking, and live alone in their odd, chalet-like home.  When Naoki
receives a phone call from an aunt (clearly more interested in insurance
money than the childrens' welfare), he simply hangs up on her.</P>
<P>Makoto arrives home after an undetermined, but obviously lengthy, absence.
He obtains a job as a day laborer with his old friend Shigeo (Ken Mitsuishi,
"The Pillow Book"), who tells him about the children living alone in the
strange, isolated house.  Misunderstood by his family, Makoto arrives at
Naoki and Kozue's home and quietly becomes the patriarch protector of 
the silent duo.  Twentyish city cousin Akihiko (Yoichiro Saito, "Wild Life")  
arrives to spend his summer holiday (clearly also acting as a scout
for that noisy aunt) and livens things up, but a pall is cast over the town
when it becomes apparent that a serial killer is targetting its young women.</P>
<P>After Mikiko (Machiko Ono), a young woman who'd taken a shine to the distant
yet polite Makoto, is found dead, Makoto is arrested as a suspect by the
same cop who witnessed his heroism, but he's released for lack of evidence.
Makoto buys an old bus, converts it for travelling and takes his two charges
and an initially reluctant Akihiko on a journey to find themselves and begin
again.</P>
<P>The heavily spiritual feel and theme of "Eureka" are similar to Peter
Weir's "Fearless," yet Shinji Aoyama ("Wild Life") takes a completely 
different approach.  "Eureka" is shot in black and white (sepia and white, 
actually) and unfolds at a languid pace over 217 minutes.  Aoyama's ambitious 
story also covers more ground, addressing not only survivor's guilt, but
loss, 
unspoken communication and family.  Unfortunately, his serial killing subplot 
rings false, severely damaging the impact of this otherwise unique and 
fascinating film.</P>
<P>Koji Yakusho grounds the film with his emotional truth while Ken Mitsuishi
and Yoichiro Saito provide some much needed levity, particularly in their
country man/city boy verbal sparring scenes together.  Masaru Miyazaki plays
Naoki as a sullen cipher except when we see him alone, thinking, while 
Aoi Miyazaki portrays Kozue as a more normal, albeit silent, child with 
a trusting, loving nature.  Machiko Ono is touching as Makiko.</P>
<P>The film is an artistic stunner.  Cinematographer Masaki Tamura can make
heat shimmer almost yellow in a black and white world, a light which often
threatens to obscure the film's images.  The three central
characters are frequently framed in center, like a still photograph which
accentuates their alienation.  The slow moving images are punctuated with
squeaky cricket chirping and the sound of waves which symbolically open and 
close the film (sound by Nobuyuki Kikuchi).  Original music by Shinji Aoyama 
and Isao Yamada features guitar, flute and piano lends a dreamlike quality.</P>
<P>"Eureka" demands that the viewer accompany its characters on a long, sometimes
arduous journey.  While one of its major roads leads to an unsatisfying
destination, the trip on the whole is one worth taking.</P>
