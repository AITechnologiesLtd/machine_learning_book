<PRE>                       ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES is a film starring Kevin Costner,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Rickman.  The
film was directed by Kevin Reynolds, written by Pen Densham and John
Watson.</P>
<P>     This morning before I went to the first showing of ROBIN HOOD I
read a review of the film in the morning paper.  The reviewer was pretty
disappointed and reading the review so was I.  A few hours later I was
sitting the darkened auditorium and enjoying the hell out of myself.  I
have some reservations, mostly about Costner himself, but overall I can
recommend ROBIN HOOD to anyone who enjoys action/adventure movies.</P>
<P>     All the principals and most of the supporting players are obviously
having a wonderful time.  The exception, as I have indicated, is Kevin
Costner.  Now, I am a fan of Costner's, but I felt he was very
uncomfortable with large parts of his role here.  Often his speech was
too flat, as if he didn't know how to read his lines, hampered by the
most curious and unnecessary accent.  Being an American actor, Costner, 
apparently, is not trained in doing accents, so he did not attempt to
sustain even a stage-British accent, but instead compromised by
broadening some vowels and dropping some r's.  The effect is slightly
silly, but most noticible only when he is slugging his way doggedly
through set-piece speeches.  In a tete-a-tete, on the other hand, with
Mastrantonio, he speaks and sounds easy and natural, with richer
inflections and a blessed reversion to his natural accent.  I think, I'm
afraid, that Costner should have limited himself to the role of producer
for ROBIN HOOD and in the future to stick the purely American roles that
I have loved him previously.  (Lyndol, my best sounding board, however,
says he had no problems with Costner as Robin Hood, so I expect as many
viewers to say I'm too harsh as to say I'm too easy on our star.)</P>
<P>     Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, on the other hand, was simply perfect
as the Lady Marian.  She brought a strength and independence to the
familiar character that I've never seen before (although I've never seen
ROBIN AND MARIAN, so I'm prepared to be corrected here, as elsewhere).
She's brave, intelligent, aggressive and assertive, a natural born
leader herself.  And she's an older Marian than the one's I'm used to,
not a crone, but surely a mature woman.  All these reasons make her
excessive screaming in the climactic sword fight all the more
unacceptable and irritating.  This is certainly a Hollywood tradition
(Basinger in BATMAN, or Hawn in BIRD ON A WIRE, par exemple) and maybe a
dramaturgical problem as well (the third party has to have something to
do while she's on "stage"), but I don't have to like it.</P>
<P>     An unusual addition to the familiar cast of the Robin Hood legend
is Azeem, the Moor, played by Morgan Freeman.  I enjoyed Freeman's
charaterization of Azeem enormously.  In some ways, he was our
spokesman, our eyes, the one who sees the barbarism of Merry Olde
England and comments on it both in words and body language.  Also,
Freeman was subtly and hugely funny; his relationship to Robin was the
occasion of several of the better jokes in the movie.  And Freeman look
marvelous, younger and in better shape than I've seen him in years.
Some people are going to say that Azeem was added to the story as a
token gesture to Costner's sense of political correctness, but I
remember that wondeful Richard Greene Robin Hood TV series from the
early 1950s in which one episode featured a Saracen dazzling the Merry
Men with his superior technology and nobility, and another episode
featured a Byzantine princess, who was even more exotic in that context
of Sherwood Forest.  Legends are always updated in their details by the
storytellers, and the presence of Azeem in this version is both welcome
and interesting, in my humble opinion.</P>
<P>     And speaking of comic roles, I was totally unprepared for the
hilarious reading Alan Rickman brought to his interpretation of the
Sheriff of Nottingham.  Rickman, of course, is famous nowdays as a major
heavy, genius, psychopath, torturer (do see CLOSETLAND if you can).  And
here as the Sheriff, a role usually more buffoonish than satanic, he
combines the psychopath with the comedian in way that was sinister,
ridiculous, threatening, hilarious, and made all the more evil by an
underlying childishness.  Rickman is a brilliant actor, who has mastered
the physical side of acting.  The slightest gesture, the smallest
movement of his eyelids communicate and communicate volumes about his
character.  Rickman is the true star of ROBIN HOOD and the real reason
to see it.</P>
<P>     (Another acting appearance I was also unprepared for comes in the
form of a surprise and wonderful cameo at the very end of the movie.
You will love it.  But don't spoil for anyone else.)</P>
<P>     There is an element of fantasy that has been added to the legend
here, also, which I am of two minds about.  The Sheriff keeps a witch in
his castle, a witch who raised him, who advises him, who prognosticates
successfully for him, and who even fights for him.  It's not quite
right, not quite wrong, and I'll be interested to hear how others react
to it.  Generally, I like magic and witches in my movies, and this witch
is having a grand time living up to the traditions of her role.  But is
it really necessary in order to give some rhyme or reason to the
Sheriff's personality?</P>
<P>     The photography, the sets, and the location scenery are all
wonderful, as they should be for $50 million.  The action is decidely
Spielbergian; the director Kevin Reynolds is a former protege of the
master and he learned his lessons well.  Unfortunately, he didn't have
much control over the other Kevin; indeed, the gossip is that the two
men were close friends going into the project and are no longer on
speaking terms, thanks to Costner's interference.  Costner, himself, has
been quoted recently as saying that it isn't what he wanted it to be;
he's complained that the relevance and meaning of the coy nude scene
(using a body double, I hear) was lost on the cutting room floor --
Marian is supposed to see the scars on Robin's back and understand that
he's grown during the Crusades.  From other things Costner's been
saying, I'd say he needs a good enema, but hey! what do I know about
the pressures of being a superstar?</P>
<P>     I miss Prince John, however.  Making the Sheriff, a royal servant,
into a major player in England's dynastic politics makes no sense
historically and introduces more ridiculousness into the script than a
boatload of Moors and witches.  The script, by the way, is loaded with
awkward locutions, stilted speeches only marginally made acceptable by
the skill of the actors.</P>
<P>     ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES, is not an unqualified success, but
it has more enough strengths and will be talked about enough this summer
that I can, without hesitation, recommend it to you, even at full ticket
prices.</P>
