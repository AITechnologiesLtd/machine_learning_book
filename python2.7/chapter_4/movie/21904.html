<P>Dead Poets Society, starring Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke,
Josh Charles and Gale Hansen.  Directed by Peter Weir.  1989.</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Carroll.</PRE>
<P>   The "hero" movie is very common among movie buffs, however, most of these
films are only about sappy and cheap sentimental value.  However, the "hero"
films that tend to stand out are the ones made to perfection.  Rocky and Rudy
are two fine examples, and one more to add to such a prestigious list is Dead
Poets Society, in which a group of boys become men throughout the trials and
tribulations and school.  Terrific performances are turned in by such a young
cast and Robin Williams once again adds his unique sense of humor and drama to
this film.</P>
<P>   With the teen drama so burnt out these days following catrastrophes like
Drive Me Crazy and Teaching Mrs. Tingle, Dead Poets Society stands out like The
Blair Witch Project among the summer blockbusters.  The actors are all mainly
young and in their first big screen roles, and all turn in terrific
performance.  With Robin Williams starring, the movie should obviously flow
around him, yet it does not.  Williams starts the film off strong, but then
gives it off to Hawke, Leonard, Charles and Hansen, just to name a few.</P>
<P>   This young cast should not have been expected to do much, but even so, they
go above and beyond the line of duty.  Such an emotional film calls for
believable acting, among other things, otherwise, it just looks like another
sentimental piece of trash.  The two main roles for the youngsters are those of
Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) and Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke).  The two play
opposite ends of the rainbow, with Perry acting as the opportunistic student
turned actor and Anderson playing the pessimistic youngster who wants to let
everything out, but turns back to the old way of doing things.  However, the
Dead Poets Society that is formed by the boys turn out the real people beneath.
 They truly enact the theme of the film to "Seize the Day," otherwise known as
Carpe Diem.</P>
<P>   The rest of the cast is terrific, and perhaps the best performance of them
all, comes from Gale Hansen who provides a stunning sense of humor to a film
that may have suffered without it.  Despite being such a meaningful film,
Hansen is able to portray the sense of youth among all of the boys becuase
despite the true intentions of the film, the setting is still in a high school.</P>
<P>   Dead Poets Society also proves why Peter Weir always tends to deliver in his
films.  After seeing The Truman Show, I personally did not think Weir could
outdo that performance, and he comes oh-so-close with Dead Poets Society.  He
consistently delivers in his films, ranging from uniqueness with The Truman
Show to thrilling us with Witness to putting everything into perspective with
Dead Poets Society.  Weir exemplifies good cinema and Dead Poets Society is a
definite for even the mildest of Weir fans.</P>
<P>   Boiling down, Dead Poets Society finishes up strong.  As the film
progresses, the ending becomes pretty predictable, yet Weir is able to
concentrate on the effects it has on the characters, not the actual event. 
This once again enforces the whole point of the film, instead of trying to play
off a sentimental finale.</P>
<P>   Dead Poets Society ranks high up on a must-see list, and for very good
reason.  It provides all different aspects of entertainment and is very hard to
find one bad point with it.  When you finish viewing Dead Poets Society, only
one thought should be left in your head:</P>
