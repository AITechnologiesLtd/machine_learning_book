<PRE>                                 SHORT CUTS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Several unrelated stories by Raymond
     Carver are braided together into one overly-long telling.
     Carver's Pacific Northwest tales are moved to Los Angeles.
     Unfortunately none of the individual stories is particularly
     interesting and the whole is little more than the sum of
     those parts.  Rating low +1 (-4 to +4).</P>
<P>     By all accounts the stories of Raymond Carver are strong on describing
the texture of life in the Pacific Northwest, but plotwise have been
described as "minimalist."  In SHORT CUTS, Robert Altman relocates those
stories to give a feeling for the texture of life in Los Angeles.  In fact,
they probably could have been moved to Massachusetts, Texas, or Wisconsin
without doing much harm.  The narrative approach is a lot like that of
1980's SERIAL, though the end result is neither so cohesive nor so humorous.</P>
<P>     There is no single unifying element to the stories tied together in
SHORT CUTS, though many of the plotlines do involve men who act selfishly
and in unfeeling ways.  A philandering traffic cop secretly rids himself of
the family's obnoxious but loved dog.  Some friends on a fishing trip put
off reporting the discovery of a body in order to get in more fishing.  An
alcoholic keeps pestering his long-suffering wife who seems unaccountably to
love him in spite of his personality.  Another man executes a painstaking
revenge against his former wife.  Revenge is also on the mind of another man
who terrorizes a woman over what seems like a trivial offense.  This film is
over three hours long to tell all these stories simultaneously, yet none of
the stories is particularly enthralling in itself.  What becomes more
interesting is the manner in which these minor stories are tied together
with each story touching nearly all the others.  However, that also strains
the credibility a bit since all these people have dramatic stories which
start within hours of each other and end the same way.  The main story line
is of Ann and Howard Finnigan (played by Andie McDowell and Bruce Davison)
facing a crisis when their son is hit by a car.  Ralph and Marian Wyman
(Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore) have unfinished business about and
incident in Marian's past.  Jerry Kaiser (Chris Penn) can't quite come to
terms with his wife's (Jennifer Jason Leigh) phone sex business.  And the
list of plots could go on and on.</P>
<P>     Robert Altman directs and co-authored the screenplay with Frank
Barhydt.  The style is remiscent of NASHVILLE with its set of intertwined
stories, but without nearly so much a sense of why tell this particular set
of stories.  Perhaps one advantage to this manner of story-telling is to
allow the viewer to see the diversity of lifestyles that can be found in one
small community.  The stories include liberal amounts of female nudity,
often with no more necessity than to dress up (or undress) a scene.  There
are several scenes of light comedy, warm humanity, or cold tragedy.  One
sequence will seem very timely but at the same time the flaws of the
sequence will be more obvious than when the film was made.</P>
<P>     SHORT CUTS is yet another film this year that did not quite come up to
most critic's estimation.  My rating is low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     The Raymond Carver stories adapted in SHORT CUTS as reported in VARIETY
are "Jerry and Molly and Sam," "Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?,"
"Collectors," "Neighbors," "A Small Good Thing," "So Much Water So Close to
Home," "They're Not Your Husband," "Vitamins," "Tell the Women We're Going,"
and the poem "Lemonade."</P>
