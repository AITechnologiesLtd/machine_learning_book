<PRE>                                BATMAN FOREVER
                       A film review by Matthew Turner
                        Copyright 1995 Matthew Turner</PRE>
<P>     Okay, so what if the newest Batman movie doesn't follow the
path/look/spirit of its angsty, semi-nihilistic comic counterpart?  I
hope no one takes this as shallow as it may seem, but I do not go to
movies about superheroes to see regular people.  I go to see the
superheroes, the supervillains, the larger-than-life conflict, an
episode in the never-ending battle between Good and Evil, between Law
and Chaos.  What if we sacrifice a little character-depth for it all?
So what? I didn't go into BATMAN FOREVER on its opening night looking
for an angsty, self-indulgent overanalysis of character that would bore
Sigmund Freud to tears.  I went to see The Batman go up against
Two-Face and The Riddler.  I was only slightly let down.</P>
<P>     It didn't make lots of difference for me that Val Kilmer was
playing Batman.  He contributed a certain slickness that Michael Keaton
lacked, but Keaton was older and seemed a tad more complex of an
individual, more of a grown-up.  I was happy that Tim Burton *wasn't*
directing this installment.  I disliked BATMAN RETURNS, and I disliked
it a lot.  It wasn't just dark.  It was pitch.  It's probably just me,
but that kind of movie I can do without... unless it's just flat-out
done better.  Joel Schumacher did an excellent job of bringing a comic
book feel to the movie.  It reminds most people of the ones they read
as kids, bright, flashy, quick, slick and filled with some cool
one-liners.  In the older comics (ones of the late 70s and early 80s)
we didn't have these superheroes with tortured souls.  It was the BAD
GUYS with the tortured souls.  That's why they were BAD in the first
place!</P>
<P>     Jim Carrey pulled off The Riddler like Frank Gorshin with a twist,
a meaner twist. (For those who *don't* know, Frank Gorshin was the best
Riddler from the original Batman series.) It was a terrific job for
Carrey.  He was made for it.  Enough said.  I was disappointed with
Two-Face, though.  I thought Tommy Lee Jones was fantastic ... when I
saw him.  In the opening, the surrounding noise was so loud I couldn't
understand what he was saying a lot of the time.  What I saw of
Two-Face I liked, and I kept wishing for more.  I was also let
waaaaaaaaaay down by the way in which Two-Face was defeated.  I don't
know what, but I thought it should've been a different end to
Two-Face.  It seemed like only an afterthought, like they said, "Oops.
Gotta kill Two-Face.  Oh!  I know...."</P>
<P>     .... and Robin.  Robin.  Robin.  Robin.  I always HATED Robin.
In the TV show I always hoped that one of the villains' traps or
torture devices or murder machines would've chopped him into a billion
billion pieces and hurled them into the Sun.  But Chris O'Donnell did
pretty good.  I actually didn't want him to die.  It was cool.  As for
Nicole Kidman.  She was okay.  She looked nice in a bedsheet, I
suppose.  And Michael Gough *rules* as Alfred.</P>
<P>     The special effects were niff-neato, though I thought "The Box"
should've been either a box or called something else.  The City of
Gotham (computer-generated), I thought, was really good.</P>
<P>     In all, BATMAN FOREVER is better than the comics-junkies might
believe.  After all, I spend much of my time in movies and less time in
comics.  I may not be as good a judge of comics as movies, but BATMAN
FOREVER *isn't* a comic.  It's a movie.  Remember that, and you'll
probably like it.</P>
