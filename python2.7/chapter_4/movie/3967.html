<P>     Let's face it: since WATERWORLD floated by, the summer movie
season has grown *very* stale. With no new eye-candy for four weeks
straight, we've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi-nutritional value
of cheatin' husbands, traveling chocolate salesmen, and computer-
generated serial killers.  Sigh.  Thank God for DESPERADO.</P>
<P>     The freewheeling sequel to EL MARIACHI--director Robert
Rodriguez's notorious $7000 debut--stars a cool Antonio Banderas as the
returning Guitarist with No Name.  He's a man in black with revenge on
his mind, and an arsenal in his case.  (The woman he loved was killed
in the first film.) So, he spends the entire story shooting drug
dealers; sort of a Tex-Mex version of the Punisher, if you will.</P>
<P>     There isn't much of an emotional core to DESPERADO.  Rodriguez is
having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to
John Woo.  (And Sergio Leone... and Sam Peckinpah...)  Some may wince at
the body count--at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate--but
it's all played for laughs.  Big, broad, Hispanic laughs that, for me,
recall the physical comedy of Blake Edwards and his PINK PANTHER
films.  Sick, slick fun.</P>
<PRE>     I can't wait to see it again.</PRE>
