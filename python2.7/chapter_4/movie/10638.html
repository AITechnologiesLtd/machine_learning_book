A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Mikael Salomon</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Graham Yost</PRE>
<P>Starring: Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver,
Ed Asner </P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Pouring rain, small flooded town, damn about to burst, bad guys going
after millions of dollars</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
At one point in the story townsperson Karen asks hero Tom what happened
to her church. He replies something like: "The church is flooded but at
least the floodwaters put out the big fire. Well, the fire wasn't that
bad, since, while the church was burning, looters apparently thought it
was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass
windows."</P>
<P>In HARD RAIN a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding. Everyone
has had to evacuate because it's raining, and now floodwaters are rising
so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about
to break. Enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver
named Tom (Christian Slater). Suddenly his security truck carrying over
three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by
armed looters. Tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money, hide
it, and swim for his life. This makes for an action movie full of jet
skis, speedboat chases, and gun battles, as Tom tries to evade and
outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the National Guard can
answer his distress call. He is befriended and aided by a spunky
churchgoing young woman from town named Karen (Minnie Driver). But
unknown to Tom and Karen, the National Guard never heard Tom's initial
distress call. Will Tom and Karen survive the natural and manmade
disasters?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics. There's not much
more to this movie than hiding, running, swimming, shooting, and saving
handcuffed heroes from drowning, but that's what makes it escapist and
fun. Relax, take your shoes off, and break out the popcorn.</P>
