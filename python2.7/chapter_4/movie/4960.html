<PRE>                                BLACK RAIN
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        BLACK RAIN has all the trappings of a hit movie.  Its director is
Ridley Scott, best known for ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER.  The movie was
produced by the red hot team of Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lansing, who gave
us THE ACCUSED and FATAL ATTRACTION.  The lead role is played by Michael
Douglas, a proven box office draw.  With this line-up, it should come as no
surprise that BLACK RAIN is as slick as the beaches in Alaska.  But
unfortunately, while it looks great on the surface, BLACK RAIN is empty at
the core.</P>
<P>        Douglas plays Nick Conklin, a street-smart New York detective.
Andy Garcia plays his partner, Charlie.  Together, they're assigned to
deliver a vicious killer to the police in Osaka, Japan.  But at the
airport, their prisoner escapes, and they're forced to stay in Osaka to
recapture him.  The movie offers loads of gritty and gory action, while
also exploring the culture clash between the American detectives and their
Japanese counterparts.</P>
<P>        Conklin is your generic, macho tough guy.  He drives a big
motorcycle, wears black leather, and doesn't like to play by the rules.
And therein lies a major problem with BLACK RAIN: the main character is not
only unlikable, but also an uninspired regurgitation of Dirty Harry and his
imitators.</P>
<P>        Andy Garcia is appealing as Charlie, but unfortunately his
character is woefully underdeveloped.  Kate Capshaw provides unnecessary
window-dressing in a small supporting role.  The stand-out is Ken Takakura,
a Japanese superstar appearing in his first high-profile American film.  He
plays the conservative, Japanese detective assigned to baby-sit the
American cops.  Takakura showers his character with depth and conviction,
but there's only so much he can do with the limited screenplay.  The movie
invests far too much energy into its cops and robbers plot and far too
little into character development.</P>
<P>        The real stars of BLACK RAIN are the stunning direction and exotic
setting.  BLACK RAIN is the first American production to be filmed in
Osaka, Japan's third largest metropolis.  The city streets are crowded and
bustling with life.  The night-time is pierced by more neon than you'd find
in Las Vegas and Times Square combined.  Ridley Scott captures Osaka's
excitement and intensity with a strong eye for composition.  His lighting
and shadow effects are exquisite and live up to the finest film noir.</P>
<P>        The movie's problem is that it asks us to take it seriously as a
character study and as a cross-cultural comparison.  But on those levels,
BLACK RAIN is a washout.</P>
