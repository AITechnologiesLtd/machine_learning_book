<P>     You can count the number of decent time travel movies on two hands
and, unfortunately, TIMECOP isn't one of them.  But don't blame the Van
Damme man--director Peter Hyams deserves all the credit for this only
okay trip back to the future.</P>
<P>     Based on the Dark Horse comic series, the story introduces the
Time Enforcement Agency, created in 1994 to police existing (!) time
travel technology.  The agency's stance is simple:  no one goes back to
get rich or get even.  Cut to 2004 and top agent Max Walker (Van Damme)
has just returned from 1929, with his former partner in chains for
trying to make a deal in the Depression.  The verdict is guilt and the
sentence is death--but not before Max learns of a bigger conspiracy
involving a U.S. senator (Silver) who's traveling time to fund his run
for the presidency.</P>
<P>     What sounds confusing is really a gas, courtesy of a smart script
by comics writer Mark Verheiden.  Lay people may have a tough time
navigating the narrative, but the story makes perfect sense to anyone
raised on Marvel Comics and "The Fantastic Four." Verheiden also
includes a double does of humor, ranging from a slam on Van Damme's
accent to a virtual reality gag that's virtually worth the price of
admission.</P>
<PRE>     Too bad the direction isn't.</PRE>
<P>     Peter Hyams is an old sci-fi hack who directed OUTLAND, 2010, and
O.J.  Simpson in CAPRICORN ONE.  But TIMECOP gets away from him and the
result is a goofy tone with zero realism (nobody can shoot to hit) and
too many (poorly filmed) fight scenes.  In fact, most of the action
sequences are pretty pathetic.  The high low-point is a absurd finale
that has three or four or fifteen characters climbing all over a
rain-swept roof.  At night.</P>
<P>     And what's with those silly looking "future cars?"  Is someone
remaking SLEEPER on a nearby lot?</P>
<P>     Acting abilities are all over the place.  Both Ron Silver and Bruce
McGill (as the TEA head) are in top form.  Van Damme needs work, no
duh, but he's three times better than co-star Mia Sara, who plays his
wife.  Badly.</P>
<P>     TIMECOP wraps with a happy ending you can see a year off.
Missing: a humorous coda explaining just how the happy ending is
supposed to work.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:   Time travel is always a blast, even with poorly staged
               sequences of Jean-Claude Van Damme as a kick-boxing
               "time cop."  Think of a comic book with good writing and
               lousy art.</PRE>
