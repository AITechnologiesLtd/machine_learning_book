<PRE>                                 MULAN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A young woman secretly substituting
          for her father in the all-male army becomes a war
          hero. Disney Studios' resurrection of a Chinese
          legend is one of their best animated films since
          BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The animators know how to
          use computer animation to create some fantastic
          effects.  If only they would learn not to sacrifice
          the carefully achieved style for the sake of some
          uninspired silliness. Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The first thing I ask of a Disney film is whether the storyteller
took large liberties with the original source. Unfortunately, though I
have several books on Chinese history and folklore, Hua Mulan (or Fa
Mulan, as she is called in this film) lies somewhere in the gray area
between the two, a real person of whom much is told but little is
remembered.  There were some patchy references to Mulan on the
Internet, the best of which were under <A HREF="http://www.chinapage.com.">http://www.chinapage.com.</A>  That
reference indicated that there are is only a little in common among the
tales of Mulan, and for the most part this animated story is fairly
accurate to what is common in those tales.  The one variance is that
the original Mulan stories had her fighting for years and then retiring
before her ruse was revealed.  The Emperor offers her a position at
court, but she refuses it and takes instead a horse as her reward.
This is somewhat different from the Disney version, but then it is hard
to compress an entire military career to an 88-minute movie.  Since
there are no specific stories of her service, the scriptwriters are
probably justified in presenting the time as being just a few months.
For once Disney Studios animated films are reasonably accurate to the
source material.  Perhaps this is some penance for their travesty on
Victor Hugo's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.</P>
<P>     Fa Mulan is the daughter of a former soldier, once a strong
soldier but now old and infirm.  The high- spirited young woman is
being forced into the traditional role of young Chinese women her age.
She has to try to make herself look pretty and submissive enough to be
matched with a man who will prize a submissive and pretty women.  But
she knows that is not her.  She asks her mirror, "When will my
reflection show who I am inside?"  But the time is approaching.  The
Huns have attacked the Emperor's lands and her father is called into
service in the Emperor's army.  Mulan's father is old and sickly, but
the law says that each family must provide a soldier.  (In the legend
Mulan has brother, but he is too young to fight.)  To the mind of the
army that means that Mulan's father must return to military service.
But Mulan knows her father is too weak to serve, and she has other
ideas.  She disguises herself as a man and joins the army herself.
Mulan's ancestors wish to send a powerful dragon spirit to guard her
and give her wisdom, but through a trick they instead send Mushu, a
comical little dragon who needs protecting himself.  Well, you probably
know the rest of the story.  This is a standard telling complete with
the nudity jokes that might seem out of place for a Disney Studios
animated film.</P>
<P>     The artwork is generally extremely good in MULAN, though for
stylistic reasons most of the characters look two-dimensional, and
perhaps a little less realistic than characters drawn in the past.  On
the other hand, there are spectacular aerial views that look more like
live-action film than animation.  Other scenes show good imagination in
recreating classical China from village life to the Emperor's palace
suggesting the Forbidden City, but exaggerated from what that palace
was to what it might have been in stories.  In a film about Chinese
fighting in hand-to-hand combat, the film could have easily degenerated
into excessive and ultimately boring animations of martial arts
techniques.  Happily, the Disney animators resisted that temptation, if
indeed they had it.  And once again each major character is created by
a different team who does art work.  That is the right approach.
Familiar actors voice many of the characters, and I strongly recommend
that the audience stay for the credits.  But I would like to call
specific attention to the speaking voice of Mulan's grandmother done by
the wonderful June Foray.  Foray was the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel
and virtually all of the female characters on ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE.</P>
<P>     But the film is far from perfect.  The antics of Eddie Murphy as
Mushu--who presumably takes his name from a popular Chinese dish--are
sure to be a pleaser, but only for those in the audience for whom any
comedy is better than no comedy.  But it is a sad misstep for others.
One can only feel sorry for the stylists who worked so hard trying to
create an atmosphere evocative of China of the ancient past only to
have that effort sabotaged for the sake of a joke.  The inclusion of
Murphy's Mushu was obviously inspired by the Robin Williams schtick in
ALADDIN, which was equally out of place.  The Chinese history is a
little amiss also.  If this were, as is claimed, the Emperor who had
the Great Wall built, that would make him the Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi.
But he ruled from 221 B.C. to 206 B.C., well before the time of the
Huns, and was anything but the benevolent despot we see in the film.
But except for the inclusion of the painfully inappropriate Eddie
Murphy this is a respectful and respectable version of Mulan's story.</P>
<P>     In the end, MULAN is a sort of YENTL with warfare.  Even at its
silliest it is fun, and at times the images on the screen are the most
impressive of any Disney animated film to date.  Probably the best two
Disney animated films in recent years, or any years, are BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST and MULAN.  Perhaps at Disney they do their best work treating
vulnerable female heroes.  Overall, Walt would have been proud.  I rate
MULAN 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<PRE>Ode of Mulan</PRE>
<PRE>Anonymous (c.5 A.D.)</PRE>
<PRE>Tsiek tsiek and again tsiek tsiek,
Mu-lan weaves, facing the door.
You don't hear the shuttle's sound,
You only hear Daughter's sighs.
They ask Daughter who's in her heart,
They ask Daughter who's on her mind.
"No one is on Daughter's heart,
No one is on Daughter's mind.
Last night I saw the draft posters,
The Khan is calling many troops,
The army list is in twelve scrolls,
On every scroll there's Father's name.
Father has no grown-up son,
Mu-lan has no elder brother.
I want to buy a saddle and horse,
And serve in the army in Father's place."</PRE>
<P>In the East Market she buys a spirited horse,
In the West Market she buys a saddle,
In the South Market she buys a bridle,
In the North Market she buys a long whip.
At dawn she takes leave of Father and Mother,
In the evening camps on the Yellow River's bank.
She doesn't hear the sound of Father and Mother calling,
She only hears the Yellow River's flowing water cry tsien tsien.</P>
<P>At dawn she takes leave of the Yellow River,
In the evening she arrives at Black Mountain.
She doesn't hear the sound of Father and Mother calling,
She only hears Mount Yen's nomad horses cry tsiu tsiu.
She goes ten thousand miles on the business of war,
She crosses passes and mountains like flying.
Northern gusts carry the rattle of army pots,
Chilly light shines on iron armor.
Generals die in a hundred battles,
Stout soldiers return after ten years.</P>
<P>On her return she sees the Son of Heaven,
The Son of Heaven sits in the Splendid Hall.
He gives out promotions in twelve ranks
And prizes of a hundred thousand and more.
The Khan asks her what she desires.
"Mu-lan has no use for a minister's post.
I wish to ride a swift mount
To take me back to my home."</P>
<P>When Father and Mother hear Daughter is coming
They go outside the wall to meet her, leaning on each other.
When Elder Sister hears Younger Sister is coming
She fixes her rouge, facing the door.
When Little Brother hears Elder Sister is coming
He whets the knife, quick quick, for pig and sheep.
"I open the door to my east chamber,
I sit on my couch in the west room,
I take off my wartime gown
And put on my old-time clothes."
Facing the window she fixes her cloudlike hair,
Hanging up a mirror she dabs on yellow flower powder
She goes out the door and sees her comrades.
Her comrades are all amazed and perplexed.
Traveling together for twelve years
They didn't know Mu-lan was a girl.
"The he-hare's feet go hop and skip,
The she-hare's eyes are muddled and fuddled.
Two hares running side by side close to the ground,
How can they tell if I am he or she?"</P>
