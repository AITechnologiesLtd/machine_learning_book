<P>BABY, IT'S YOU (1998 POV Documentary)  Directed, written, produced by Anne
Makepeace. Photography, Uta Briesewitz. Editing, Jennifer Chinlund & Anne
Makepeace. Music, Simon Kendall.  A P.O.V. release. Approcx  60 min.</P>
<P>The title has been previously used in a fiction feature (1983) , the story
of an inter-faith romance. It was the second movie written as well as
directed by John  Sayles, that superb independent film-maker. Do not
confuse it with the current film  that opens the 11th season (1998) of the
P.O.V. (Point Of View) documentary series airing on PBS.</P>
<P>The 1998 "Baby," by prize-winning film-maker Anne Makepeace, is an
autobiographical slice of life and time. Centering around Ms.Makepeace and
her Canadian-born husband, writer Peter Behrens, it includes a "supporting
cast" of their non-mainstream  (when not downright weird by conventional
standards) baby-boomer siblings.</P>
<P>Having reached their late forties the childless couple decide to have a
baby.  Says Anne : "At my age it's really hard to get pregnant the fun
way," so the two decide to undergo modern fertility procedures. These
become a medical micro-Odyssey involving body, mind and feelings.  I will
not reveal what actually happens (or does not ) since the film is, in its
way, a suspense story of private lives made public. There is a built-in
element of voyeurism as the filmed events proceeds, branches out into the
families and friends of Anne and Peter, provides a number of revelations.</P>
<P>To various degrees, the latter involve Anne's brother Douglas who, in Utah,
is planning to embark on polygamy and have 20 kids; Doug's patriarchically
bearded neighbor who has seven wives; Anne's hippie-ishly bearded other
brother Roger, a semi-recluse in Appalachian mountains with his company of
goats; uncles and aunts from prim New England; Peter's artist sister Mary
whose quandary parallels that of Anne in her first days in college; Peter's
sister Anne in Canada, and her lover Tanya as they adopt a baby.</P>
<P>Well shot by Uta Briesewicz, the film follows chronologically and
step-by-step the efforts, dashed hopes and new hopes of the potential
parents, shows a solid marriage, Anna's reflections on her past, especially
her upbringing.</P>
<P>In a sense, she, as the documentary's prime maker, is stalking her own
self, but with naturalness and no trace of play-acting, setting up
situations or staging anything.</P>
<P>Andy Warhol's dictum  that sooner or later everyone will have fifteen
minutes of fame is debatable. What is unarguable however, is that, as
"Baby" proves, the lives of all human beings contain at least one movie
subject.</P>
<P>It touches on family relationships, marriage, abortion, unexpected drama,
changing or new standards and mores. "To breed or not to breed? That is the
question." The belated decision to beget in mid-life, while not elaborated
upon, is obviously related speaks to the colossal growth (and siren song)
of professional women, to the race for success and financial security, to
the business and busy-ness of this waning century.</P>
<P>Other problems of Anne and her brethren can be laid on the doorstep of
their Yankee parents whose relations with their children were hardly
confidential, and for whom any mention of sex was inconceivable.</P>
<P>It's all there, both in text and sub-text, both in the banality of life and
its unconventionalities. To what extent viewers will be touched or
enlightened is an open question. The persons shown, including the offbeat
types, have no special interest per se. But the dilemmas of the
ever-increasing number of women who, unlike their parents and their
parents' parents, now decide to have a career first, then to try to
conceiveas their hair grows gray, are major problems of industrialized
nations in the last decades. Over and above discussions and arguments, it
is good that such such concerns be made vivid by the visual media.</P>
