<P>   Aris Iliopulos, who directed this film written by Ed Wood, must 
have woken up early one day and decided to make a film out of a 
script that had apparently died and rested in peace for over twenty
years.  Having won from the writer's widow, Kathleen Wood, 
the right to translate the text to celluloid after convincing her that he
would not put a word of dialogue into the movie, Iliopulos--a
portrait painter and photographer as well as a filmmaker--
somehow scraped up some of Hollywood's celebrated stars
to appear in this no-budget silent.  With Billy Zane ("Titanic,"
"Orlando," "Dead Calm," "Back to the Future") in virtually
every scene of the 90-minute, unabashedly "B" movie, the
entire cast seem to be having a ball hamming it up, struggling
to keep a straight face in a movie with Ed Wood's
characteristic 1950s ambiance.  Wood, considered by
cognoscenti to be the worst American director of all-time,
gained celebrity status when Johnny Depp and Martin Landau
starred in Tim Burton's 1994 film "Ed Wood," a film with a
decidedly loving look at the no-talent helmer whose "Glen or
Glenda" (1953) docu-fantasied about transvestism (Wood
himself starred as the title character who cannot decide how
to tell his fiancee he wants to wear her clothes) and "Plan 9
from Outer Space" (1959), about aliens seeking to conquer
our planet by resurrecting corpses from a San Fernando
Valley cemetery.  </P>
<P>   Iliopolus could have made a film to satirize Wood, but why
beat a dead horse? Besides he obviously has a soft spot in
his heart.  How can you help loving a guy with no aptitude
who carried on making film after film while riding on pure
enthusiasm?  Though "I Woke Up Early" has the feel of early
Wood, Iliopulos takes advantage of a few modern special
effects techniques to the extent that his budget would allow,
juxtaposing black-and-white dream sequences from the
principal character's youth with boldly colorful scenes
depicting his current odyssey.  This is the sort of film that 
kids in the seventies might have turned out for at midnight,
toking their weed and establishing their hip quotient by
turning out for the show on Saturday nights for a few weeks.  </P>
<P>   We can guess that widow Kathy Wood insisted  no
dialogue mar the film because any verbal exchanges would
put "I Woke Up Early" in the category of just another movie,
one to be judged critically by the usual standards.  By barring
conversations, she perhaps hoped to cement the movie's cult
status, signalling reviewers and Joe Sixpack alike that this
work should be judged on its own unique merits.  This is not
a silent film in the way we perceive the genre, though at
times Billy Zane may remind us of Chaplin and Keaton. 
Instead the soundtrack is filled with shrieks and eerie music
from the haunting, even maddening, strains of a Scottish
bagpipe (actually played by Ron Perlman who spent quite a
while learning to conquer the basics of the unusual
instrument) to the mellifluous tones of Nat King Cole crooning
"Nature Boy."</P>
<P>   While there is no maxim to be learned from the film--no
"love conquers all," or "life is short," or "persistence pays"--
the movie enjoys incorporating elements of Hitchcock, Brecht
and Fellini, challenging serious viewers to show their
erudition by analyzing the work semiotically and casual
moviegoers to open their minds to an experience unlike any
other they're likely to see this year.</P>
<P>   The plot is anything but confusing.  The Thief (Billy Zane)
escapes from a California mental institution by knocking out
or perhaps killing a nurse (he plunges the long syringe all the
way into her arm), donning her uniform, and making his
getaway.  Quickly stealing clothes more appropriate to his
gender from the local clothes lines, he robs a lending
institution of $15,000 and becomes a wanted man after
shooting the owner.  Attending what he thinks is the victim's
funeral, he hides the money in a coffin which locks the cash
in, making it inaccessible to the thief.  He then shadows each
of the mourners in turn hoping to find the loot.  </P>
<P>  Staying a step or two ahead of the police (Andrew
McCarthy, Steven Weber and Rick Schroder), he confronts
the caretaker (Ron Perlman) and a succession of mourners
whose names he finds on a list.  During his murderous
adventures, he attracts women at a dance hall and, in one
more or less compelling scene is invited to have fun in his
flophouse room by a teenaged hooker (Christina Ricci).  </P>
<P>   If you judge the picture as though it were just another entry
in the annual march of cinema, you will likely conclude that "I
Woke Up Early" is a hollow experience: unemotional, bereft
of traditional character development, pointless, just one-
damn-thing-after-another.  The movie is all that, but what
redeems the whole enterprise is the affection that
paradoxically comes through from its director, who obviously
has tender memories of Mr. Wood.  From time to time, we
regular moviegoers need to watch both serious and comic
stars simply cut loose and have a good time with a script that
is so silly that we wonder whether its writer was as nuts as
The Thief who's in the limelight.  If nothing else, the film may
encourage us to go back to the silents to see how all those
movies made from 1895 to 1927 succeeded in riveting
audiences purely on their visual imagery.  While "I Woke Up
Early" can hardly be called riveting--it's no "Birth of a Nation"-
-there is somehow enough going on visually and sufficient
charm exuded by the admittedly undeveloped characters to
keep us in our seats, despite its absence of either flat-out
laughs or authentic Hitchcockian suspense, genuinely
Brechtian devices or seriously amusing Felliniesque
characterizations.</P>
