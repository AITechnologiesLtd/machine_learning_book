<P>Before you leave for the theater take a glance at your kitchen sink, 
because that's the only thing that doesn't get thrown into "Armageddon," 
the second of this year's "Uh oh, big rock!" movies. In its quest to 
become the ultimate summer spectacular, this "Dirty Dozen in Outer Space" 
hits the audience with two and a half hours of virtually non-stop action, 
punctuated with wisecracks and showcasing every cliché in the history of 
movies. "Armageddon" is the kind of blockbuster that leaves you feeling 
exhausted and entertained, though you may have trouble respecting 
yourself the next morning.   </P>
<P>As far as junk food movies go, "Armageddon" is a super-sized value meal, 
with just as little nutritional value. Please understand, I had fun 
during the movie. The special effects were killer, the action scenes 
gripping and most of the jokes were funny. Shucks, I even teared up at 
the appropriate moments. But later, while reflecting on the stock 
characters, contrived situations, and the film's ultra manipulative 
nature, I grew annoyed. Event movies don't have to just be testosterone 
drenched hooey. Without wasting a lot of space pontificating, I suggest 
you look back at "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." Then 
consider the recent "Independence Day" and "Godzilla." Are we truly 
doomed to a future where you can't enjoy a summer blockbuster without 
first disconnecting your brain? </P>
<P>Like "Deep Impact," "Armageddon" deals with a "global killer" headed 
straight for Earth. As in "Deep Impact," the big plan is to land on the 
asteroid, drill deep into the rock and blow the thing to kingdom come 
before it can do the same to us. To that end, NASA recruits a group of 
rowdy oil riggers, lead by Bruce Willis. His team includes the requisite 
archetypes: cocky stud Ben Affleck, wise-guy Steve Buscemi, repentant 
father Will Patton and righteous dude Owen Wilson, plus a whacked-out 
muscleman and a goofy fat guy. Adding spice and romance to the mix is Liv 
Tyler as Willis' spunky daughter and Affleck's honey bunny. </P>
<P>After a high octane opening, where a dazzling meteor shower rips up New 
York (and the filmmakers get in a funny dig at "Godzilla"), NASA honcho 
Billy Bob Thornton rounds up Bruce's roughnecks to undergo abbreviated 
astronaut training. Before you can say "they're ripping off 'The Right 
Stuff,'" the guys are ready to go. But prior to leaving to save humanity, 
the crew gets a night off, so that each character can underline his one 
distinguishing characteristic, while Ben and Liv share an MTV video 
moment, making out against the sunset during a drippy Aerosmith power 
ballad. </P>
<P>Then, after a patriotic speech and a shot straight out of "Top Gun" 
showing the uniformed crew walking stoically in slow motion, it's off to 
the shuttles, for a marathon session of derring-do and heroic sacrifice 
in asteroid land. Things go from bad to worse, of course, allowing Bruce 
to get on the mike and say, "Houston, YOU'VE got a problem."</P>
<P>On paper, the derivative and downright cheesy nature of the production is 
obvious, but it's easy to get caught up in it all during the film, thanks 
to breakneck pacing and hyperactive editing. Veteran video maker Michael 
Bay directs the film like a Mountain Dew commercial on amphetamines. With 
camera cuts every 3-5 seconds, this thing makes "Con Air" look sluggish.</P>
<P>The actors play their roles gamely. Billy Bob Thornton anchors the film 
nicely, while Bruce plays the hero, using an odd, semi-Southern accent 
where he kind of swallows his words. Ben and Liv are okay as Ken and 
Barbie with attitude, and Steve Buscemi breaks the tension just enough 
with well-timed, generally funny wisecracks. Newcomer Owen Wilson steals 
scenes as the only crew member totally enthusiastic about the adventure.</P>
<P>As far as the actual plot mechanics, no cliché is missed, including the 
time-honored "should I cut the blue wire or the red wire" bomb defusing 
scene. Incidentally, if the weatherman ever forecasts meteor showers, 
here's a tip. Just drive to the suburbs, because meteors only hit big 
cities. And if you're stuck in New York, for God's sake, avoid the 
Chrysler building, because that sucker gets nailed every time.</P>
<P>I realize this piece has been unusually snide, so let me stress once more 
that I had a good time watching this film. It was only later that the 
cynicism really crept in. As far as late 90's summer blockbusters go, you 
could do lots worse than "Armageddon." Compared to "Batman and Robin" or 
"Godzilla," this thing is "Citizen Kane." But I miss the days when movies 
were made by artists instead of technicians. If, like me, you enjoy 
"Armageddon" while in the theater but feel cheated later in the evening, 
do yourself a favor. Rent "The Right Stuff" and watch a real movie by 
real artists about real heroes.   </P>
