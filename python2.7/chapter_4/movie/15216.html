<P> "The Siege" is already under attack by Arab anti-defamation groups, thanks
to its alarming -- and misleading -- trailer which shows U.S. army troops
rounding up Arabs and forcing them into internment camps ringed by
barbed-wire fences. However, anyone who shows up to protest what they assume
is going to be an ultra-right-wing fantasy about the benefits of martial law
will feel rather silly if they actually watch the film, which all but bends
over backward to portray Middle Easterners in a favorable light. "The word
'Arab' is not synonymous with the word 'terrorist'," an off-screen voice
assures us at one point.
 But at the same time, "The Siege" also errs in making most of its Arab and
Arab-American characters faceless and nameless. Rather than being depicted
as real people, they're shown largely as a mass of bodies being pushed
around, waiting to be rescued by sympathetic outsiders. It's almost as silly
as the infamous "Cry Freedom," which tried to relate the story of  Steven
Biko through the eyes of a white English family.
 In many ways, "The Siege" is a movie operating at cross-purposes with
itself, a tell-tale sign that too many writers worked over the script. In
this case, three are credited, although the writing is so uneven you can bet
many more cooks stirred this particular potboiler. Thanks largely to
director Edward Zwick ("Glory," "Courage Under Fire"), "The Siege" does
manage to pull off a few genuinely startling moments, such as when a meeting
of leaders is mysteriously disrupted by one pager after another going off,
or when tanks roll through the streets of New York.
 In the film, New York is targeted by terrorists, and FBI agent Anthony
Hubbard (Denzel Washington) and his partner Frank Haddad (Tony Shaloub) are
forced to accept the assistance of mysterious Elise Kraft (Annette Bening),
who's had more than diplomatic relations with some Arab suspects. In fact,
Elise's idea of pillow talk includes asking about the location of terrorist
cells in the vacinity of Manhattan.
 When the combined efforts of the FBI and the CIA fail, the President sends
General Deveraux (Bruce Willis) and scores of troops to seal off Brooklyn
and enforce martial law. Though Deveraux appears to be level-headed at
first, soon he's become a maniac who bellows "I am the law" and feels no
shame about torturing civilians. Consistency is not one of "The Siege"'s
strong suits.
 Then again, the movie is more successful at creating tension than in
building credible characters, which sometimes leaves Washington and Bening
looking borderline silly as they try to rationalize Hubbard and Kraft's
schizoid personalities. As in too many of his other recent appearances,
Willis is present only to preen, in this case underneath one of the worst
toupees since Burt Reynolds' heyday. Perhaps "The Siege" should be
picketed -- by former fans anxious to see Willis break out of his terminal
self-adoration and begin acting again.
