<PRE>`Things crawl in the darkness
That imagination spins
Needles at your nerve ends
Crawl like spiders on your skin
Pounding in your temples
And a surge of adrenaline
Every muscle tense to fence
The enemy within...'</PRE>

<P>    Is there really anything scarier than the unseen? Don't you get scared to 
death when you come across one of those science shows on PBS about the 
millions of bacteria crawling all over you? Don't you freak out when you wake 
up in the middle of the night and hear a loud noise coming from within your 
house? Have you ever been told an urban legend while sitting around a 
campfire or walking down a dark alley?
    That paranoia associated with the little voids that exist within our own, 
supposedly secure and advanced world is what `The Blair Witch Project' 
attempts to deal with through a unique style of filmmaking almost never 
utilized by the movies.
    The film puts itself forward as a collection of `real' footage shot by 
three film students who were never seen from again after they set out into 
some supposedly haunted woods in October 1994 to make a documentary on the 
local legend of `The Blair Witch.' There is no narration or outside footage 
except what was shot by the students (the actors) themselves. 
    In case you don't know, the directors/creators Daniel Myrick and Eduardo 
Sanchez conceived the film as being the most realistic work of fiction an 
audience could see. They didn't write a script, all they did was come up with 
the major plot points and character traits and then sent the three actors out 
into the woods to make the movie themselves. Myrick and Sanchez and a few of 
their crew members kept tabs on the actors through global positioning units 
and had `booby traps' set and waiting so that everything the three 
experienced would be real. This technique certainly works for the film's many 
emotional points, although the lack of interesting dialogue and 
characterization serve as noticeable flaws.
    I'm not sure which is the most innovative concept at work here: the way 
the film was made; the fact a distributor decided to take a chance on it; or 
the fact that mainstream audiences seem to be just as excited and anxious to 
see something of the tiniest scale as they were for a few other summer flicks 
of the largest scales.
    Anyway, the film starts out with a lot of interviews with the local 
townsfolk and their interpretation, stories and alleged personal experiences 
with the Blair Witch. Some blow it off as nonsense, but others take it 
seriously. This lays the foundation for the bulk of the film and the actual 
climax itself which probably would have worked as well as it does whether or 
not this attempt at a backstory had been included. In fact, this is the 
film's weakest aspect because the interviews are a bit too short and informal 
and the characters don't think much of it either.
    Oh yes, the characters are: Heather (Donahue), the director who shoots 
almost everything she and her crew say on home video (which gives the film a 
realistic feeling because almost everyone has seen themselves on their 
parents' or their friends' home videos); Mike (Williams), the sound guy who 
doesn't say much at first except for a few snide remarks and one-liners, but 
who will later become full of emotion; and Josh (Leonard), the 
cinematographer who uses a grainy 16mm black-and-white camera.
    The three set out into the woods to hike to some specific landmarks 
associated with the legend which includes your common tall tale stories and 
places such as `Coffin Rock' and an old hermit's home and stories of children 
and hunters who were abducted and slaughtered by the witch. What ensues is 
not the three students' serious study of the legend, but of the psychological 
terror they will endure when they get lost, run out of food, fight with each 
other and then panic when they all fear they are being hunted.
    It's obvious to us why the three begin to break down and lash out at each 
other and what the strange sounds are that they hear at night. The most 
chilling and enduring scenes last only a few minutes when the three set up 
camp for a night and are awakened by noises and movement in the dark they 
attribute to either backwoods survivalists, animals or just the wind, but 
they never say what's clearly on their minds (and ours) - it's the witch. One 
of the single, most frightening moments I can recall occurs during one of 
these scenes where the crew is awakened by a presence outside their tent and 
the three flee into the woods, cameras rolling, and in the distance we see 
Heather running away and she screams, `My God, what the hell is that!?' 
    This is what makes `The Blair Witch Project' so superior to the countless 
Hollywood gorefests about monsters, serial killers and vicious animals. It 
relies on our own imagination to determine just how horific the elements at 
play might be. Throughout the film the three encounter signs of an 
intelligence such as piles of rocks and stick figures hanging from trees that 
weren't there before. These things are so simple yet they are frightening 
because of their nature alone. We want to believe that we can logically 
explain any occurrence in this day and age, but the atmosphere of paranoia is 
too thick and overbearing and thus it's all pure fear.
    The final scene is the culmination of everything the film is. It's 
disturbing, scary and realistic and when the climax ensues and there hasn't 
been a drop of blood shed or a villain in a costume or a CGI, it's a powerful 
moment.
    However, I take issue with the fact so much more backstory about the 
Blair Witch legend and the students' film expedition has been covered on the 
movie's web page and other media sources than what was included in the film 
itself. To have the film be entirely a string of Heather, Mike and Josh's 
footage is a great idea and works well, but what if the film had been a 
fictional documentary about the students' documentary? It could have been 
complete with a vast historical background of the Blair Witch legend and the 
rescue efforts that supposedly took place in the days after the students were 
declared missing. That might contradict the theory Myrick and Sanchez were 
going for, but I doubt it would have hurt (especially considering the film's 
running time is less than 90 minutes and seems to fly by).
    Still, as my friend and fellow film critic Dustin Putman said, to see 
`The Blair Witch Project' is not just to sit in a theater and watch a movie, 
it's to really experience something. It works on an emotional and intelligent 
level I've not seen since `2001: A Space Odyssey,' in that an invisible 
powerful force has outsmarted us in a day and age where we think we know 
everything there is to know.</P>
