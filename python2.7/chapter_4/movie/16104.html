<PRE>THE MATCHMAKER
Directed by Mark Joffe</PRE>
<P>Every so often a new talent appears on the scene and instantly wins a
devoted following. That was certainly the case with Janeane Garofalo
last year: Her not-so-ugly duckling turn in "The Truth About Cats and
Dogs" proved to be an inspiration to millions of women who don't look in
the mirror and see Julia Roberts. It also provided plenty of room for
Garofalo to show off her sassy, self-deprecating style, previously seen
only in small doses in "Reality Bites" and "Bye Bye Love."</P>
<P>"The Matchmaker" probably seemed like a solid choice for a follow-up
vehicle, another romantic comedy casting Garofalo as a tough cookie with
a tender heart, who finds love when she finally breaks out of her usual
insulation. In this case, she's an American single women who finds
herself stuck in a small Irish town during the annual matchmaking
festival, a set-up that should have been the perfect springboard for
Garofalo's stinging observations about cultural differences and the
mysteries of the heart.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, though Garofalo is still a treasure, "Matchmaker" proves
to be a crock of fool's gold. The screenplay was penned by one writer
and reworked by three others, and the story bears the fingerprints of
too many hands. Often there's so much going on in this tale director
Mark Joffe doesn't have time to capitalize on what should have been
sure-fire comic ideas. Nor does Garofalo get many chances to fling her
customary zingers, which could have put some much-needed punch into this
nicely photographed but uninspiring blarney. James Sanford</P>
