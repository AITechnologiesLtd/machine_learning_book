<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This original youth film, that has the look of a pseudo-documentary but
is a work of fiction, with the nonprofessional actors seemingly changing
mid-scene from reading a script to doing ad-libs, fails to answer the
simple questions I put to it about what it is trying to accomplish. This
is director and writer, Harmony Korine's (screenwriter for Kids), debut
film as a director, accomplished with all the verve and necessary shock
and schlock he can muster. What results is a pointless but engaging romp
through a Midwestern fictional suburban city, Xenia, Ohio, and its
dysfunctional inhabitants, mostly white redneck youth, who either seem
retarded or prone to violence, as they are searching for something to do
with themselves in a city still suffering from the devastations of a
tornado. The film was actually shot not in Ohio but in Korine's
hometown, outside Nashville, Tennessee.</P>
<P>The film opens to a shaky home video footage of a tornado that passed
through town and killed some of its inhabitants, as we view some of the
damage and hear the youngsters cursing. We then mainly follow two
youngsters (the sallow looking Jacob Reynolds & Nick Sutton-discovered
on a troubled teen episode of Sally Jessy Raphael) who kill cats and
sell them to a supermarket that sells them to a Chinese restaurant. The
rest of the time, they sniff glue, pay for sex with an older woman, and
take one of their Granny's off a life support respirator, thereby
killing her.</P>
<P>Another odd character, Jacob Sewell, plays a boy dressed in pink fluffy
rabbit ears who pisses down on traffic from a bridge and walks through
town playing toy gun games with some little kids, looking like he's lost
his marbles. Korine is non-judgmental about any of his characters. But
is that necessarily a good thing?</P>
<P>What saves this film from being a complete absurdity, is the raw energy
exhibited by the director, as he is on the cutting edge of cinema
verite, showing the pent-up hostility and alienation these trashy young
people have. He seems to be painting his words with images of the most
freakish things you can see in America's wasteland, and not caring
whether you believe what you are seeing or not--his aim seems to be to
shock the audience and for the audience to respond and say how "hip" he
is to be showing us all these revolting and boring images. But is that
enough to make this a satisfactory film?</P>
<P>His characterizations of people are all off-the-wall, such as the
retarded woman who treats a doll as her baby or the albino cook who
proudly says Patrick Swayze is her favorite movie actor and she would
pay to have him touch her. Then there is the chubby, painted,
simple-minded housewife who is sold by her husband (Max Perlich) as a
prostitute to our very young protagonists. A drunk gay man (Korine) who
tries to seduce an encephalitic black dwarf (Crenshaw). Two skin head
teens senselessly punching it out with each other for an interminable
amount of time in their kitchen for fun and macho pride. And, the
sisters (Darby & Chloe), preoccupied with making their nipples grow
bigger, as they put duct tape on them and then pull it off, so as to
make them stick out. They are shown in another scene, fondled by a
pervert, who is pretending to help them find their missing cat. But by
showing all these freaks, is the director not just using them without
any purpose but to exploit their oddness?</P>
<P>Linda Manz as Solomon's Mom, does a bizarre tap dance, and has a strange
way of raising her son as single-parent--jokingly pointing a gun at him
to try and get him to smile. Is this funny scene a comment on
single-moms?</P>
<P>The film has an attention disorder disturbance of its own, as it keeps
going at random from one vignette to another, without any deciferable
plot or storyline, which should be a real treat for heavy metal
enthusiasts with low attention spans and those who respect the personal
creative nature of film and can overcome the depravity of what they are
seeing and its immature fixations, and be impressed with the film's
originality. For those lucky souls, they have found a film that is a
rarity. But have they found a good film?</P>
<P>Others who might like this film, could be taken in by the audaciousness
of the director's style and the fast-pace of the film and its easy
disposable use of images. But to its credit, the film does capture some
of the fears the youths have about growing up and it does show that
there are no role models around to help the children. But does the
filmmaker really care about what he is seeing?</P>
<P>This film will probably be viewed as one that you either hate or love,
and no one can convince you otherwise. Since I was caught being in a
voyeuristic mode by some of the film, then found myself tuning it out as
I became bored with it; I, therefore, can only say that the film did not
work for me. It is hard for me to warm up to those who kill cats, yet I
wanted to see how the minds of such people work. That I found out. Their
mind's don't work. Which is the problem I had with watching the film, as
I felt that I didn't need a mind to see it.</P>
<P>This film lacked the needed pathos to make the youngsters' story seem
more than a provocative freak show; it failed to offer some meaning to
their life, which resulted in giving the film a disjointed look, even
though Korine should be applauded for sticking to his personal vision.
But, the final question is, do you think the director is really
interested in showing us anything but a freak show?</P>
