<PRE>NOTORIOUS (1946)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Writer: Ben Hecht
Starring: Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Louis Calhern,
Leopoldine Konstantin, Reinhold Schünzel, Alex Minotis, Ivan Triesault,
Moroni Olsen</P>
<P>If "Rear Window" was brilliant because of how deep it was, and "Vertigo"
was brilliant for how existential it was, "Notorious" is brilliant
because of how simple it is.  It's nothing more than an almost-typical
Hichtcock plot, with lots of tension, espionnage, and attractive stars,
but that's what's so amazing about it.  It is one of the best examples
of Hitchcock making a simple story into a gem.</P>
<P>"Notorious" came out around the time of Nazism, so it has a modern (for
'46) feel to it, as the chief "villain" is none other than a Nazi in
hiding.  The story revolves around a love triangle which takes place
during the wave of nazism, involving a secret agent, a notorious
daughter of a recently deceased nazi, and a living nazi.  With this,
Hithcock tells a simple yet amazing tale, which shows off a lot of his
camerawork, all while telling a story which never stops being
interesting.</P>
<P>The story takes place following the death of a nazi, and then introduces
us to his infamous daughter, Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), a
promiscious drunkard of a woman.  At a party, she meets a man named T.R.
Devlin (Cary Grant), who turns out to be a secret agent, luring her to
work for the government to expose a nazi hiding in Brazil: Alexander
Sebastian (Claude Rain, rejoining Bergman to get that cool "Casablanca"
feel to it).  The two share a brief non-sexual affair (this is 40s
cinema, after all), and eventually and reluctantly agrees to get the
government closer to Alex by flirting with him.</P>
<P>Soon, Alicia and Alex are a hot item, all while Devlin is still lurking
around, and sneaking around with Alicia.  Despite the fact that Alicia
and Alex are together, she still has a tiny thing for Devlin, and vice
versa.  What results is a fascinating and creepy film, resulting in one
of the best endings to a Hitchcock film ever.</P>
<P>The strength of this film is really in the characterizations and
writing.  The relationship between Grant and Bergman is a touching one,
and one that is always interesting.  Because the writers have made these
two out to have a rocky relationship, the two of them are never boring. 
And with chemistry between Grant and Bergman filling in some answers to
unanswered questions in the script, the two work as a couple.  And, of
course, the two are both brilliant in their roles.</P>
<P>But the best achievement, character-wise, is that of Alex.  Instead of
him being a flat villain, he's more of a semi-villain.  He has a heart
and feelings...I mean, just because he's a nazi doesn't mean he's
totally evil.  He is a man who is trapped in a lifestyle which will
ultimately destroy him: he's a notorious nazi, and seems to be equipped
with a massive oedipus complex, as his mother (Leopoldine Konstantin)
seems to rule his life, much like Norman's mother did in "Psycho."  As
played by Claude Rains, he's almost sympathetic at times.  Rains gives
the best performance of the film.</P>
<P>The film is also a show-off for the talents of Hitchcock.  "The Master
of Suspense" never has any action sequences or anything, but instead
creates several moments of pure tension, and usually in the most bizarre
places.  One sequence which is notable (which we watched in film class
once) is a party scene where Grant and Bergman have to get into the
locked wine cellar of Rains's house to find some clues.  With wonderful
camera movement, tense parallel action, and some truly ingenius set-ups,
it's a classic of American cinema.</P>
<P>Also standing out are a sequence where Bergman finds out that she's
being poisoned by Alex and his mother (complete with some pre-60s
psychedelic pioneering), and the ending, which is nothing short of
flawless.  The latter is perfect because it shows us how truly trapped
Alex is in his life, and uses an ingenius idea and never throws that
particular punch.  The final shot is classic too; a creepy,
grin-inducing finale which remains stuck in memory for eternity.</P>
<P>Many people claim that a film which is simplistic is not extraordinary. 
Not so.  "Notorious" is proof that a director can tell a simple story,
and still make a film which can stand the test of time.  Sure, it's not
"Psycho," "Strangers on a Train," or "North by Northwest," but it's
still one of the director's best because it shows how truly great he was
by showcasing him in unambiguous mode.  I loved every second of it.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
