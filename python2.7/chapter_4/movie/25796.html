<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Whatever the medium, surrealism is a difficult technique to pull off.
Often, it comes across either as overly complicated, an indulgment in
weirdness at the expense of a logical storyline, or as too mundane, taking
perfectly evident plot points and tarting them up needlessly. The first
type usually leaves its audience hopelessly confused (or, at best,
requiring multiple screenings) while the second frequently just makes one
wonder what all the fuss was about.</P>
<P>Although it makes a valiant effort, "The Cell" falls into this latter
category. The film, by first-time director Tarsem Singh (pretentiously
going only by his given name), tries to put a novel spin on the "bizarre
serial killer" concept popularised by films like "Silence Of The Lambs"
and "Se7en". Whereas those movies merely speculated about how the minds of
their antagonists worked, "The Cell" literally takes us inside its
villain's head. But while the visuals accompanying these scenes are
stunning, the sequences are too elementary in their conception, lacking
the shrewd symbolism which is the hallmark of great surrealism.</P>
<P>"The Cell" opens on a vast desert landscape, through which a woman in a
feathery white dress, Catharine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), is riding on a
black horse. We soon learn that all this is taking place inside the mind
of a young coma patient. Catharine, a child psychologist, has had her
consciousness inserted into the boy's mind using revolutionary new
technology, and is trying, so far without success, to coax him into
awakening.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) tracks down a serial
killer named Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio). Stargher has murdered
several women by trapping them in a sealed container which automatically
fills with water after forty hours. He then bleaches their flesh to make
them look like dolls before dumping their bodies. Just before his arrest,
Stargher experiences a massive seizure, plunging him into a coma from
which he will likely never emerge. Unfortunately, he has recently
kidnapped a woman, and has left no clues as to where she is being kept.
With less than two days to rescue her before she drowns in Stargher's
contraption, Novak turns to Catharine Deane, who reluctantly agrees to go
inside Carl's subconscious.</P>
<P>It is these scenes, set inside the mind of the killer, that form "The
Cell"'s centerpiece, giving Tarsem a tremendous opportunity to strut his
stuff. Having cut his teeth on such visually memorable music videos as
REM's "Losing My Religion", Tarsem brings a number of striking touches to
"The Cell". Consider, for example, a disturbing scene in which Catharine
walks through a gallery of Stargher's previous victims, all in various
stages of becoming doll-like and mechanically acting out vaguely obscene
movements. Also very impressive is Stargher's representation of his evil
side, a demonic-looking figure brilliantly realised by costume designers
Eiko Ishioka and April Napier. Tarsem does a fine job of filming
D'Onofrio in these scenes in a manner that gives him a sensation of
absolute enormity.</P>
<P>But one of the joys of surrealistic works is in deducing the meaning
behind the symbols. But Tarsem does not make much use of symbolism in "The
Cell". Though he does paint an eccentric and original mental terrain,
Tarsem mainly depicts Stargher's mindscape as simply a collage of moments
from his past. This makes the whole thing at times feel like nothing more
than a heavy-handed way to insert flashbacks into the narrative. Most
things in Carl's subconscious are exactly what they seem to be, and while
there is enough of the bizarre and the fantastic to impress the eye, I
found myself left with a slight feeling of hollowness.</P>
<P>Indeed, I was sometimes more intrigued by the boy Catharine is treating
than I was by the Stargher storyline itself. Here we do get flashes of the
sort of clever associations I was anticipating (inside his mind, the boy
lives in fear of a creature Catharine later reveals is derived from Mother
Goose), and it is unfortunate that these sequences were used only as
bookends for the main action. They had the potential to form the
cornerstone of a very intriguing movie in their own right.</P>
<P>The two main protagonists, Lopez and Vaughn, give passable performances.
Lopez's Catharine seems rather weak and half-formed throughout. This may
have been intentional, to contrast the character with the way she behaves
after falling under Stargher's thrall, but these sequences are too brief
to support the decision. Vaughn, meanwhile, plays Peter with little
variation on the standard FBI stereotype. Intriguing hints that he may
have gone through much the same childhood experiences as Stargher are
left disappointingly underdeveloped.</P>
<P>D'Onofrio, on the other hand, ably handles the variety of material he is
given, playing everything from a simpering child-man to an imposing beast.
The biggest problem is that Stargher just is not a particularly memorable
villain. Although scriptwriter Mark Protosevich gives him some interesting
characteristics (he has hooks embedded in his back so that he can hover
from ropes over his victims, for example), these just seem like so much
window dressing. Stargher's own personality is pushed to the background
for much of the film.</P>
<P>"The Cell" also goes a little overboard in trying to make Stargher seem
like less of a monster, passing the blame on to his abusive father.
Although this does provide some insight into Carl's motivations, it also
feels like something of a cop-out. And surely, if we are expected to
excuse (or, at least, understand) Stargher's behaviour on this basis, then
mightn't his father be worthy of the same consideration? Isn't it a little
too pat to just set him up as the ultimate villain?</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that "The Cell" does not tackle such issues, nor take
better advantage of its great premise. Instead, it ends up as essentially
just another serial killer movie. It can be recommended on the basis of
its visuals and sheer entertainment value, but it falls short of being a
great movie, unfortunately settling for just being pretty good.</P>
