<P>   Nothing's permanent on this Earth of ours, not even life. 
Love is transitory.  If fifty percent of American marriages now
end in divorce as couples outgrow each other, think of how
many kids separate permanently from their toys when they
get tired of them or when the playthings are inevitably
outgrown.  We'd not be surprised to learn that close to one
hundred percent of our miniature trinkets and gadgets wind
up in the trash bin or in the yard sales--torn, raggedly,
misused and tired--the feelings of our little friends obviously
hurt beyond repair.  In the vivid imaginations of scripters
Andrew Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin and Chris
Webb, human tykes are not the only ones who may be bereft
when their usually inanimate pets are broken.  The soldiers,
sky-walkers, doggies, piggies and miscellaneous other once-
sturdy pals are emotionally crushed as well.  What's more,
never do these buddies become indifferent to their caretakers
as their stewards so often become to them.</P>
<P>   "Toy Story 2" is a homage to the immeasurable charms of
the eponymous critters, a testimony to the impermanence of
inanimate things which have given us alternately selfish and
sentimental human beings so much gladness during our most
wonderful years.  Featuring the ultimate in 3-dimensional,
Pixar animation, director John Lasseter's tale of
homesickness and bonding cuts neatly across audience
barriers of age, race, social class to provide a heartwarming
portrait of the chums we've all enjoyed or are savoring still,
whether the rag dolls of financially strapped kids or the
computerized zappers of the rich and famous.  Utilizing the
voices of such greats as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kelsey
Grammer and Joan Cusack to get into the heads of the
characters, director Lasseter--whose job has been made easy
by a large team of crack designers--unfolds a story whose
plot is as absorbing as the animation is colorful and vivid.
Anyone who has ever felt guilty when leaving a beloved dog
home alone while heading off to work or school now has
reason to feel even more contrite, however. You see, the
slinky-dogs and other trinkets that line the shelves of the little
ones have lives of their own.  They miss you when you're
gone.  But happily, they have their own little pals to enjoy
while their owners are engaged in less important matters than
playing.  We know that now that we've seen this frenetically-
paced yarn, an often bust-out-laughing tale of toys and tykes.</P>
<P>   The story opens as little Andy heads off to camp, leaving
cowboy Woody (Tim Hanks) behind under his mom's care. 
When Woody is kidnapped by a greedy collector (Wayne
Knight), more interested in investments than in art, he learns
that he is part of a set whose value has dramatically
increased when he is added to the combo.  While Woody's
pals back home led by Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) head out to
the collector's business to rescue him, Woody discovers that
he was once a 1950's TV star in the role of a puppet (think
Howdy Doody) and that he had been part of a family that
includes a horse named Bullseye, a prospector named Stinky
Pete (Kelsey Grammer), and a cowgirl that seems to run
through her role on speed, Jessie (Joan Cusack).  Woody is
given a guilt trip that more than matches his journey to the
collector's store.  His rediscovered family tell him that if he
deserts the brood, they will be placed in boxes, stored away
indefinitely in the dark.  How will the cowboy solve the
dilemma?  If he stays, he will betray his beloved owner,
Andy.  If he goes back home, he will abandon his own
extended family.  While Buzz has his own, more visceral
friction with his arch enemy, Emperor Zurg (Andrew Stanton),
Woody is faced with a crisis of conscience that could take 15
years of couchwork to resolve.</P>
<P>   Parents of exceptionally sensitive kids could be concerned
that their own young-uns could wind up afflicted with guilt
over the toys they once discarded.  There is probably little to
fear, though, as the little ones who will delight in the
unaffected performances of these figures (just about all
adorable except for Stinky Pete who is bitter because he has
never been bought and unwrapped) will simply eat up the
luminous landscape of this wonderfully realized film.  Oddly
enough, the movie was at first intended for direct-to-video
release, but once the producers got over that silly notion they
made sure that considerable attention to every technical
detail was put into the happy story.</P>
<P>Rated G.  Running Time: 85 minutes.  (C) 1999
