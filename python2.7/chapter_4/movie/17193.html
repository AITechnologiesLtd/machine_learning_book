PAYBACK (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Brian Helgeland</PRE>
<P>Writers: Terry Hayes and Brian Helgeland (based on the novel "The 
Hunter" by Donald E. Westlake)</P>
<P>Starring: Mel Gibson, Maria Bello, Gregg Henry, David Paymer, Deborah 
Kara Unger, Lucy Alexis Liu, William Devane, John Glover, James Coburn, 
Kris Kristoferson, Bill Duke, Jack Conley</P>
<P>Like I did with "American History X," I wonder if there's a different 
cut of "Payback," a Director's Cut if you will, that is significantly 
better than the one I saw. As you've probably heard, as it was official 
controversy, both films were subject to re-cuts by each film's 
respective star, and in the case of "Payback," multiple reshoots, 
changing the original cut of the film which either didn't test well with 
said actor, test audiences, or both. But as I also did with "American 
History X," I bet the original cut, though perhaps better, is not 
exactly stupendous. At best, "American History X" was a very good TV 
movie, boasting at least some intensity from its lead actor (Edward 
Norton) if not some truly obvious jabs at contemporary racism (no way! 
racism can transform people into monsters?!). But with "Payback," it's 
at best a really entertaining, silly bad guy flick. The focus of 
"Payback" is, of course, on a "morally corrupt individual" (read: the 
villain, if this was another movie) and his numerous attempts at 
cold-hearted vengeance. Many of the criticisms of "Payback" bring this 
out about the movie: the lead character's completely unsympathetic, the 
movie's too dark and too violent, and it's too bleak. My estimation: 
he's not unsympathetic enough, and the movie's not nearly as dark, 
violent, or bleak as it should be.</P>
<P>My guess why: Mel Gibson, the film's star, who perhaps was not man 
enough to go the distance and make his character a completely repellent 
character. Normal audience members hate to see movies where they have 
conflicting views on the lead character, and they bitch and moan when a 
movie puts them in a position where they are forced to follow things 
from the point of view of a character they are opposed to, for whatever 
reason. The supreme example of this is with "A Clockwork Orange," where 
the lead character is a complete deviant: a thug, a rapist, and a 
self-centered sonofabitch. But because it's his story, because there is 
voice-over narration by him, and because the film puts him in a position 
where instead of him being the torturer, he's the captive, we are forced 
into a peculiar catharsis where we have to wonder if we're supposed to 
like this character or not. Either way, we care about him in some 
capacity, and listening to different people's reactions, including your 
own, is intriguing.</P>
<P>This probably should have happened in "Payback," another film adaption 
of the Donald E. Westlake novel "The Hunter," which was adapted back in 
1967 by John Boorman as "Point Blank," a classic noir film starring Lee 
Marvin which I've not seen but hear it's so cold and bleak that it's 
incredible. The same will not happen for this film: yes, it's very cold 
and bleak and the character is generally a bastard, but it's the things 
that Gibson has added that lessen the edge on the film and make it more 
of a hoot-and-hollering bit of entertainment: the audience laughs 
hysterically at the twists because they're proposterously ingenius. A 
bit with a bomb and a hotel room is only a nice touch because it 
requires skillful manipulation on the part of Gibson's character over 
the rest of the characters, shrewd intelligence that no one else seems 
to have. At one point, he walks into said hotel room, the phone 
mysteriously rings, and he finds the bomb. Next shot is of the bad guys 
who planted it there sitting in their car, and trying to set it off 
again. Suddenly we see someone cutting the fuel tank underneath the car. 
A couple seconds later, we're back in the car, and Gibson is seen 
menacingly through the rear-view mirror, puffing on a cigarette. A large 
lake of gasoline has spread from underneath the car to his feet. He 
drops the cigarette, the car explodes. Audience roars with laughter, and 
maybe some applause.</P>
<P>It's this kind of showmanship that disengages us from the cruelty that 
could be and might very well be the original cut of "Payback." At heart, 
this film yearns to be brutally bleak and questionably immoral because 
it's teeming with villains - there's really not one 100% likable 
character in the movie. The film's plot is even gritty and admittingly 
great: Gibson's character, with the simple moniker of Porter, is a 
career criminal who does a small job with his wife (Deborah Kara Unger) 
and a pal crook of his (Gregg Henry, a greasy DePalma regular) only to 
be shot in the back and left for dead by the two others. He lives, 
though, and when completely rehabilitated, he comes back not just for 
vengeance, but for his cut of the money. His wife is quickly offed via a 
drug overdose (a shame, considering Unger is such an interesting actress 
as evidenced by her performances in "Crash" and "The Game"), but his 
other two objectives are harder to get at. Henry, as it turns out, has 
joined a large crime corportation dubbed "The Syndiacate," and entry 
contained Porter's cut of the money. Not only is Henry harder to get to, 
but now he also has to go through the numerous levels of this Syndicate 
to obtain his biggest objective.</P>
<P>That he's so concentrated on this objective is what's so entertaining 
and so silly about this film. We end up rooting for him not only because 
he's the one dolling out the narration, but because his ambition 
measures head-for-head with his brain, and that he manages to be so 
precise while being so crazy (going head-to-head with this Syndicate for 
a mere 70 grand is a joke in itself). It's a not-bad plot, but let's 
face it: we can't take what he goes through seriously at all since he 
goes so over-the-top in his attack on the corporation, and thus I wonder 
if that other cut is more subtle and more believable, and therefore more 
engaging. Not to say this film isn't engaging: "Payback" is furiously 
entertaining, a showstopper that leaves you with a big stupid grin on 
your face, or at least that was my perception. In short, it's fun. 
Gibson's Porter is weirdly likable, and the opening moments of this film 
are mesmerizing. We see him getting the bullets taken out of him by a 
criminal's doctor, then getting back in the game by stealing a man's 
wallet and spoiling himself, all with a deadpan look on his face, like 
he's not really enjoying himself, he's just being true to his nature.</P>
<P>In fact, Gibson is superb here. With a low, gritty, tobacco-induced 
voice that sounds eerily like the computer in "Alpahville," Gibson plays 
him as a man who doesn't seem to have a real emotion in his body and 
reacts to the doublecross by merely wanting to get his money back, and 
maybe getting vengeance on his traitors as a little bit of extra credit. 
He makes it tough on the audience to really like him, and surprisingly 
enough, Porter doesn't evoke at all his Mad Max character, the antihero 
who has had the soul drained out of him. But then again, there's the 
rest of the film, which tries to make him more sympathetic by 
introducing a romantic interest in the form of a prostitute (Maria 
Bello) whom he comes to for help and becomes interested in. Their 
half-assed potential romance is just that, and it's something I wish had 
been done in a far more subtle, more bleak fashion (I hear "Point Blank" 
reduces their romance to a one-night stand which is far more compelling 
and true to form than the bit in this film). As such, it corrupts the 
film, and makes it seem like Porter is perhaps not being shown in his 
true colors, like he's been distilled for a mainstream audience.</P>
<P>Other parts don't bode too well either: the subplot involving Kris 
Kristoferson as the head of the Syndicate is, yes, entertaining, but 
it's also distracting from what this film should be. Originally supposed 
to be an off-screen Angie Dickenson, Kristoferson's role is there merely 
so that the audience will be whipped into a frenzy by the sheer 
theatrics of the production (meanwhile, William Devane and James Coburn 
as the two sub-heads of the Syndicate, who were in the original cut of 
the film, work nicely). None of this is a bad thing, in particular. I 
really enjoyed "Payback." For what it is, it's a very good flick, a nice 
deterent from the usual Hollywood films that sometimes can't even rise 
to give us any interesting elements, or at least any witty material. 
This film at least has hilarious subplots, like run-ins with crooked 
cops, an incompetent bookie (David Paymer), and a sadistic dominatrix 
(Alexis Liu), all which register well. Its cinematography is exquisite, 
all drained and pale, accenting grays and blues, giving the film a 
wonderful tone that may be the very best thing about this movie. And 
it's never boring or excruciatingly stupid (well...the bit with the dog 
was rather retarded, but ah well...). In short, it's basically 
everything a Hollywood piece of entertainment should be. But should 
films ever merely settle for being a Hollywood piece of entertainment? 
That, of course, is a rhetorical question.</P>
