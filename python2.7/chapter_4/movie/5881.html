<P>     The notoriously sap-averse Hollywood insiders at this year's Sundance
Film Festival went absolutely nuts over THE SPITFIRE GRILL, resulting in a
bidding war which found Castle Rock paying a head-spinning $10 million to
distribute an independent film.  Maybe they smelled a female-appeal hit
like FRIED GREEN TOMATOES; maybe they liked the idea of countering the
Hollywood filth-monger mentality by supporting a film produced by clergy;
maybe, just maybe, they were genuinely touched by the story.  Whatever the
reason, they have themselves a film which doesn't just jerk tears -- it
slaps, kicks, pinches and pleads for them.  THE SPITFIRE GRILL may be
positive and uplifting, but it is so aggressive in the pursuit of your
sympathy that it becomes exhausting.</P>
<P>     THE SPITFIRE GRILL stars Alison Elliott as Percy Talbott, a young
woman just released after five years in a Maine prison and looking for a
fresh start in life.  That search brings her to the small town of Gilead,
where she goes to work at The Spitfire Grill for Hannah Ferguson (Ellen
Burstyn), a feisty widow recovering from a hip injury.  Hannah has been
trying -- unsuccessfully -- to sell the grill for many years, which leads
Percy to suggest an essay/raffle contest to give it away.  Most of the
townspeople are suspicious of Percy's motives, including Hannah's nephew
Nahum (Will Patton), but Percy still manages to make some unlikely
friends, including Nahum's timid wife Shelby (Marcia Gay Harden) and a
mysterious figure who lives in the woods.  Still, it is difficult for
Percy to escape a past which she is reluctant to discuss but which Nahum
is intent on discovering.</P>
<P>     On its most basic level, THE SPITFIRE GRILL is yet another in a long
line of films about benevolent strangers who teach intransigent folks a
lesson in tolerance, and again the lead character is perhaps the most
troubled, but not really the character who grows and changes.  Alison
Elliott is the best thing about THE SPITFIRE GRILL, a talented young
actress who turns in strong and emotional work as Percy, a woman who is
just as unable to forgive herself as others are to forgive her.  She is
the sympathetic core of the film, and we grow to care about whether she
will be able to find redemption.  Unfortunately, we never get to see her
experience that redemption, and it is something of a cheat.  It is never
nearly as important to us that Hannah makes peace with her demons, or that
Nahum learns to be accepting, or that any particular person ends up with
the grill, but those are the only scraps we are tossed to give THE
SPITFIRE GRILL any sense of consequence.</P>
<P>     In place of consequence, writer/director Lee David Zlotoff provides a
film which often feels like a string of feel-good cliches, scored by James
Horner, the master of feel-good cliche music.  Zlotoff never misses the
opportunity to send out scenes like tear-seeking missiles, scenes which
might have been effective individually but en masse serve only to batter
you insensible.  For the record, THE SPITFIRE GRILL includes an abusive
husband to boo, a story about an abusive stepfather to feel outraged over,
a story about a troubled Vietnam veteran to feel sorry for, three
different stories about lost children to sob over, three different
wrenching tales from the essay contest to sob over some more, one
mother-and-child reunion to sob over still more, a wedding proposal to
feel warm and fuzzy over, a funeral oration for moral uplift and a scene
of a once near-catatonic man emerging into the sunlight to provoke
unintentional snickers.  If my description seems cruelly cynical, it is
only because THE SPITFIRE GRILL numbs you with its pathos.  In its own
way, it is just as shallow as an action film which is just one explosion
after another.</P>
<P>     The story goes that THE SPITFIRE GRILL was "commissioned" by a
collective of Catholic priests who wanted to back a film with "positive
human values," and I suppose you could say that they got what they
ordered.  Everyone in Gilead eventually Does the Right Thing, and it is
the kind of film which will probably end up on Bob Dole's Hit Parade.  But
in the course of injecting those human values, Lee David Zlotoff didn't
bother to inject many human beings -- Gilead, Maine and nearly everyone in
it (particularly the terminally irrascible Hannah) seems plucked from a
Pepperidge Farm commercial.  Alison Elliott's performance is strong enough
that, for a while, you might think THE SPITFIRE GRILL is about something,
but it isn't about people whose troubles make you emotional.  It's more of
an endurance contest between you and your supply of facial tissues.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bombs in Gilead:  4.</PRE>
