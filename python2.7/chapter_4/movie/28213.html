<P>   In a society that's increasing less tolerant of crime, calls are
regularly sent out and political campaigns are based on
demands for tougher sentences and for prisons that punish. 
"Greenfingers" is a refreshing antidote to such mindless
chatter.  Wearing his heart on his sleeve, Joel Hershman
treats us to a movie based on a true story that punctuates the
effect of a so-called country club institution on its inmates. 
"Greenfingers" is upbeat, a feel-good British light comedy with
a couple of juxtaposed romances, but the enterprise is as
prettified and bland as the lovely Primrose Woodhouse
(Natasha Little), one of its rich young characters who inhabits
the role of a repressed mama's girl longing for the strong
arms of a handsome and unpredictable man.</P>
<P>   Taking place in one of Britain's alternative prisons--which
houses criminals who are specially chosen by their potential
to redeem themselves though convicted of violent crimes like
murder and rape--"Greenfingers" focuses on a robust fellow
with exquisite leadership possibilities, Colin Briggs (Clive
Owen).  Jailed for accidentally killing his kid brother whom he
had caught in flagrante with his fiance, Colin has spent more
than half his life in prison and has given up on himself when
by accident, he discovers that he has a green thumb.  Having
planted violets in a particularly barren little plot of land on the
jailhouse grounds, he is as surprised as everyone else that
his flowers have bloomed--as he, too, will in this by-the
numbers picture which trots out the usual stereotypes.  These
caricatures include one kindly old feller, Fergus Wilks (David
Kelly), who despite his charm had killed all three of his wives;
a big, bald, tattooed type; and the youthful, impulsive Tony
who seduces a most willing volunteer to the institution.
Encouraged by Fergus to make use of their latent talent, four
inmates make their little desert bloom, attracting the attentions
of the stuffy horticulturist Georgina Woodhouse (Helen
Mirren)--who encourages the men to strive ever onward by
entering the annual Hampton Court Palace Flower Show.</P>
<P>   Whether or not the men can garner some of the prizes
bestowed by the aristocratic judges and hosts of that
prestigious show, "Greenfingers" becomes a British version of
"Waterboy," cultivated where the Adam Sandler vehicle is
vulgar, but calculated and hackneyed nonetheless.  Given the
astonishing good looks of Clive Owen, this movie could turn
out to be a chick flick, bringing in the romantic women to
whom it's targeted, but to see Mr. Owen in this after his
spellbinding turn in the far more developed "Croupier" is
disheartening.</P>
