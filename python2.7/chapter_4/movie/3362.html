<PRE>                              MURIEL'S WEDDING
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Toni Collette, Bill Hunter, Rachel Griffiths,
           Daniel LaPaine, Jeanie Drynan, Sophie Lee.
Screenplay/Director:  P. J. Hogan.</P>
<P>     MURIEL'S WEDDING presents me with a critical poser:  what do
you do with a movie when there was only one thing about a movie that
you liked, but you liked that one thing a *lot*?  I mean, *really*
liked it a lot.  MURIEL'S WEDDING is a truly disjointed effort,
bouncing from slapstick comedy to depressing domestic drama, but its
lead character is a marvelous creation, played with love and
sensitivity by Toni Collette.  I was always interested in what might
happen to her, but I was frequently disappointed by what happened
around her.  Does that one great piece outweigh all the other less
effective pieces?  In a word, yes...but just barely.</P>
<P>     Toni Collette plays Muriel Heslop, a homely, unemployed
22-year-old living in the seaside Australian community of Porpoise
Spit.  Muriel is obsessed with the idea of being married, convinced
that it will separate her from her layabout family and mean that she
has become a success.  She sees an opportunity in a blank check, and
steals several thousand dollars from her father (Bill Hunter), a
pompous local politician, to take a luxurious island holiday.  There
Muriel runs into Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths), an old schoolmate with a
zest for life.  The two become fast friends, and move to Sydney
together, but marriage is still foremost in Muriel's mind.  When an
opportunity does present itself, it forces Muriel to consider her
priorities carefully.</P>
<P>     Here is what is right with MURIEL'S WEDDING:  Toni Collette,
who walks the fine line between making Muriel sympathetic and
making her pathetic.  Collette gained over 40 pounds to play the
dumpy Muriel, but to her eternal credit she plays against Muriel's
physical appearance, letting the audience see the swan behind the
ugly duckling.  She does the most with her expressive mouth, as her
bouts of giddiness cause her to burst into a huge toothy smile,
frequently with her tongue stuck out through them.  Her performance
is by turns hilarious (her hysterical reaction to a date attempting
to remove her clothes) and touching (her wistful sing-alongs to
ABBA's "Dancing Queen").  It is a marvelous piece of work, made all
the more impressive because she never tries to inject any irony into
Muriel's decidedly un-liberated dreams.</P>
<P>     Here is what is wrong with MURIEL'S WEDDING:  Muriel is stuck
in an episodic story which doesn't add up to all that much.  The
sequences at the Hibiscus Island resort are pure raucous comedy,
highlighted by Collette and Rachel Griffiths (a dead ringer for
Juliette Lewis as Rhonda) doing a lip-synch performance of ABBA's
"Waterloo."  Then the switch to Sydney brings a tragic turn which
seems really inappropriate, followed by a bride-for-hire section
again focused on comedy.  Finally, there is yet another tragedy, and
a decision by Muriel for which the justification doesn't seem quite
right.  It is often difficult to get caught up in Muriel's story,
because it takes so many detours.</P>
<P>     She is also surrounded by characters who are mostly paper-thin by
comparison.  Griffiths has some nice moments as the brassy Rhonda, and
Jeanie Dryden has a couple of heart-breaking scenes as Muriel's
beaten-down-by-life mother.  But Bill Hunter is merely loud and
slightly oily as Muriel's father, and Sophie Lee leads a group of
stereotypically catty Barbie dolls who snub Muriel.  There is also a
strange bit by Matt Day as the young man who pines for Muriel then
disappears from the story.  I can understand the attraction--Muriel is
a splendidly crafted character, acted with a grace that made me care
about her life.  She deserved something more cohesive than this jittery
wedding.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dancing queens:  6.</PRE>
