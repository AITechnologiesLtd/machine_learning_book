<P>THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION stars "Friends"' Jennifer Aniston as Nina Borowski,
a social worker who falls in love with gay school teacher, George Hanson
(CLUELESS' Paul Rudd). After a disheartening breakup with his boyfriend, Dr.
Robert Joley (Timothy Daly), George finds himself moving in with Nina, a woman
he barely knows but quickly bonds with, becoming best of friends. Things run
relatively smooth until Nina discovers she is pregnant and realizes she wants
much more of George than simple friendship. Convinced George could make a much
better parent than arrogant biological father, Vince (John Pankow, best known
as Ira on "Mad About You"), Nina struggles with the realization that George
will probably never love her the way she has come to love him.</P>
<P>If the plot vaguely reminds you of last year's CHASING AMY, that's because it
*is* vaguely like CHASING AMY, but the two are approached differently enough
(and not just thru opposite gender roles) that THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION
never feels like a phony impersonation. The two films are distinct, most
notably the fact that OBJECT is a million times more "commercial",
disregarding the highly risque sexual observations and potentially offensive
dialogue that AMY thrived on. In fact, OBJECT deals with the homosexuality
issue much more discreetly than most "gay" movies. For the most part, the
character of George avoids the stereotypical clichés that could've turned his
character into a running gag as opposed to a genuine, caring persona. Rudd's
subtly sweet performance also gives George the right level of boyish charm
without becoming emotionally manipulative.</P>
<P>Aniston effortlessly proves here that she is the most talented of the
"Friends" sextet with yet another praiseworthy performance, outshining her
PICTURE PERFECT run. Sincerely conveying her character's struggle, Aniston
makes a good lead - both sweet and beautiful to gaze upon. With the rest of
the cast performing at top notch (particularly Alan Alda and Nigel Hawthorne
in smaller roles), it is obvious the flaws held by THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION
lie within the story, not it's transference to the screen. It's a shame that a
film with so many delectable one-liners tucked snugly into its script allows
for so many misfires in way of development. To speak vaguely so as not to
"spoil" the film, why are some things revealed that are nearly contradicted by
the whole premise? Why do they even show up when they will just as soon be
abandoned, leaving the audience highly justified with their notice of such an
obvious frailty?</P>
<P>It is OBJECT's good intentions and easy approachability that make it a likely
winner with most audiences. The film would not have suffered any if George was
a heterosexual who simply didn't return Nina's affection, but the
homosexuality "gimmick" (to put it a bit vulgarly) puts an even greater spin
on things. The ending worked well, allowing for happy resolutions all around -
something the audience is likely to ponder the likelihood of from the get go.
The audience I was in attendance with even broke into a round of applause with
one of the redeeming surprises. And so, while a tune-up could be appreciated,
THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION is a conventionally unconventional film that will
gain the affection of most movie goers.</P>
