<PRE>Sleepless in Seattle
directed by Nora Ephron
starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan
rated PG (brief language)</PRE>
<P>We have seen this scenario before- several times, actually, but we never
tire of it.  The "destiny" element in a romantic movie, that
they-were-meant-for-each-other feeling, the giddiness.  Sleepless in
Seattle will be called overrated because it feels familiar, but from the
familiarity, director-writer Nora Ephron pulls in a nearly extinct
gadget called satire.  Sleepless in Seattle, at heart, is not meant as a
satirical look at the 50s romances, but as something sentimentalists can
get "high" on, something cynics will soften up to.  It's sheer fun that
doesn't require much intelligence, but a good amount of subdued zeal.</P>
<P>The two main characters are played by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  They're
performances are reserved, which fits the movie well- it, too, is a
quiet, light experience.  Sam, the Hanks character, is a man who has
just become a widower.  He is left to be a single-parent for his young
boy and is fed up with people trying to soothe him with "work will get
you through this" comments.  He moves to Seattle.  Annie Reed, played by
Ryan, lives cross-country in Baltimore, where she is engaged to a drab,
low-key guy named Walter (Bill Pullman) who is allergic to nearly
everything.  She doesn't indulge in dreamy, romantic fantasies- she is
extremely down-to-earth, a woman afraid of flying.</P>
<P>Back in Seattle, Sam's son Jonah discreetly calls a radio psychologist
to report that his father is "Sleepless in Seattle," an insomniac who
cannot grasp the reality of his wife's death.  Sam is literally forced
out to pour his heart and soul onto the telephone, onto radio, where
millions of listeners tune into this heartfelt sobstory of love lost.
Annie Reed hears this in Baltimore and falls in love with Sam at first
listen.  She is in tears by the end of his "our-love-was-magic" speech
and is convinced Sam is her destiny, her fated true love.</P>
<P>This from a woman who, in the beginning, said "Destiny is something
we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that
happens is accidental."  Now, she is willing to drop the Walter dweeb
for this sweet, charismatic voice to whom she has no idea it belongs.
She asks her brother (David Hyde-Pierce) if this is just pre-wedding
jitters and he replies "Yes".  She is extremely confused.  She knows
she's not the only one pursuing this dream guy "Sleepless in Seattle"
but she feels something in her gut- telling her "if you don't find this
guy, your destiny will not have been fulfilled".</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Jonah gets a letter from Annie and he, too, is convinced this
is the gal for his dad.  Sam, who already has a ditzy girlfriend,
dismisses the letter which says they should meet atop the Empire State
Building.  "Hah," he scoffs.  Jonah is concocting plan after plan
because he instinctively knows this is his destined stepmother.  Annie
is full of itching curiosity- who is this "Sleepless in Seattle" guy, he
sounds like a dream, he is my destiny!</P>
<P>The film continually alludes to the Cary Grant sobfest An Affair to
Remember, from which it steals from frequently.  That's the satire part,
but it's satire done in a care-free way.  The cynics have said the movie
can't stand on its own, that its too loaded with false romance.  It is
false romance, borrowed from old 50s movies.  We, the audience, don't
actually believe this is real because we know life just isn't that
coincidental.  We would love life to be this way and some of us do
believe in destiny (myself nearly included).  Sleepless is rather
manipulative like An Affair to Remember, but it's the kind of
manipulation we don't mind- we were manipulated in Terms of Endearment
and did we mind (I loved it.)</P>
<P>Although the movie has its elements of satire, it is basically a
(highly) pleasurable romantic-comedy that doesn't let explosive,
extremely funny humor get in the way of its dreamy, surrealistic
love-destiny story.  How do these cynics live?  How can they resist this
piece of tempting amour?  It's the movies that try too hard that usually
fail.  Sleepless doesn't push us, it seduces us with its romantic
fantasy and we are seduced. Sleepless in Seattle is a very delicious
movie and those who dismiss it just don't get the point.</P>
