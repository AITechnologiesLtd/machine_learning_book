 Shanghai Noon (2000) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Jackie Chan, Owen
Wilson, Lucy Liu, Brandon Merrill, Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley.
Written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Directed by Tom Dey.</P>
<P> Following in the footsteps of comedians from Buster Keaton to the Marx
Bros. to Abbott and Costello to Martin and Lewis to Bob Hope to John
Candy, Jackie Chan has followed Horace Greeley's advice and gone west.</P>
<P> "Shanghai Noon" is a comedic Western, a funny culture clash in which an
Imperial guard (Chan)  comes to the Old West of 1881 to rescue a
kidnapped princess ("Ally McBeal's" Lucy Liu).</P>
<P> Along the way, Chan's Chon Wang meets a fast-talking con artist, but
inept outlaw, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). The two ostensibly team up to
rescue the princess, though Roy has his mind set on somehow grabbing the
$100,000 in gold sent to America to ransom her highness</P>
<P> "Shanghai Noon," like most of Chan's movies, is a rough blend of action
and comedy. The action sequences are first-rate as Wang battles Indians,
cowboys and a former, disgraced guardsman who masterminded the
kidnapping plot.</P>
<P> The comedy is definitely low brow, but offers some funny moments. Roy,
for example, continually mispronounces Chon Wang as John Wayne as
berates his partner. `That's not a cowboy name,' he tells him more than
once.</P>
<P> There are some funny subtitles as Wang tries to make himself understood
to a tribe of Indians who have befriended him.</P>
<P> Chan, as usual, is always exciting to watch as he leaps, rolls and uses
props with the deftness of a ballet master.</P>
<P> The real find is Wilson.  Best known for his role as a would-be
criminal in the independent "Bottle Rocket," he also has co-starred in
"Armageddon" and "The Haunting." In "Shanghai Noon" he is glib,
charming, a blowhard and a bit of a coward. His character is reminiscent
of the type Bob Hope would play, though he is physically more active and
much better looking than Hope.</P>
<P> Wilson holds his own with Chan, and the two make a charming duet.</P>
<P> "Shanghai Noon" features a fine score by Randy Edelman as well as
scenic cinematography by Dan Mindel.</P>
<P> Alfred Gough and Miles Millar's script, though, is a bit
anti-climactic. Director Tom Dey, making his feature film debut, could
have trimmed a bit from the one-hour-and-50-minute running time. The
movie's pace needed to be a bit quicker. At a couple of junctures there
is dead space between some of the action sequences. Judicious editing
could have speeded up the movie.</P>
<P> "Shanghai Noon" is a fun outing, filled with stunts and gags that will
please Chan fans. It's not art, but it is entertainment.</P>
