<PRE>DOLORES CLAIBORNE (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Great works of literature seldom produce a good material for
films, and the career of Stephen King is living proof for
that. However, some transitions between the written word and
silver screen image are better than other and, again,
Stephen King is a nice example for that phenomenon.
Interestingly enough, among dozens of novels and short
stories adapted for films and televisions usually those not
belonging to his favourite genre of horror proved to be good
source for films. One of such examples is DOLORES CLAIBORNE,
1995 drama directed by Taylor Hackford.</P>
<P>The plot is set on the small island off the coast of Maine
and begins when one of her residents, feisty old housekeeper
Dolores Claiborne St. George (played by Kathy Bates) becomes
target of criminal investigation, following the suspicious
death of her long-time employer, bed-ridden wealthy old
widow Vera Donovan (played by Judy Parfitt). To make things
worse for Dolores, the investigation is led by Detective
John Mackey (played by Christopher Plummer), mainland
policeman who had been investigating her twenty years before
after equally suspicious death of her husband. Everyone is
convinced that Dolores killed the old woman, and that might
include even her daughter Selena (played by Jennifer Jason
Lee), successful journalist who comes from New York
following anonymous tip. When two women finally meet, the
issue of Dolores' guilt or innocence is going to be settled
together with painful memories and ghosts of the past that
haunts their lives.</P>
<P>Taylor Hackford and his scriptwriter Tony Gilroy are among
those rare filmmakers that managed to successfully tackle
with King's fiction. Dark, menacing atmosphere of King's
home state of Maine - the perfect setting for the unpleasant
and often depressive subjects of family abuse that this film
tackles - is brought here due to the clever use of Gabriel
Beristain's photography and Canadian coastal locations.
Hackford also manages to give depth to the characters by
using flashbacks and non- linear story structure. The actors
are doing wonderful job - Kathy Bates is excellent in her
complex role, as well as Jennifer Jason Lee, as well as
Christopher Plummer as near-psychopathic detective. The most
impressive work was, however, done by David Strathairn in
the role of Dolores' mean husband. All that would guarantee
a very good film, but in the last segments Hackford seems to
lose pace and David Elfman's musical score becomes somewhat
too irritating. And, same as with many Hollywood films that
had great potential, ending is formulaic and represents a
disappointment. However, despite that, and despite the fact
that depressive viewers might do themselves a favour if they
watch something else, DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a good film not
only compared to the majority of King's screen adaptations.</P>
