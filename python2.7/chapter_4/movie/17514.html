<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>As anyone who has read my last two reviews: short films that studios and
people alike have never heard of and are available for free download via the
internet, you can probably guess that I have it out against the current
regime of Hollywood movies, which, after seeing basically crap for about
four months, is beginning to make Communist Russia under Stalin seem like a
pretty friendly place.</P>
<P>    In case that hasn't tipped you off, my gripes about The Mod Squad, a
movie based on a late-sixties, early-seventies TV show that wasn't that
great to begin with, should probably clue you in.  I am not saying starring,
because anyone who would act in this film and consider themselves a star for
it is either a drunk or has an agent that's a drunk, probably the latter.  I
can forgive Giovanni Ribsi, on the account of the fact that he's acted in
good movies (unlike Epps and Danes, who rarely even get close to a good
role).  He's been in Gus Van Sant and he even does a good job among the
twentysomething shoot-the-actors while making them popular sitcom of
"Friends", where several good actors seem to go to work the bad acting out
of their system (i.e. Lisa Kudrow).  I maybe can forgive Dennis Farina, who
is at least killed off before the movie gets really bad.</P>
<PRE>    The rest of it, I hate.</PRE>
<P>    Being the eternal optomist that I am, I'll have to give you a few good
points.  For one, it has a really nice soundtrack.  For two, it's fun to
pick on.  The script is so bland and unoriginal that I will further
investigate my theory that major movie studios are experimenting on monkeys
turning out scripts for them, and anonymously email my evidence to the ACLU
and ASPCA for them to lobby and handle.</P>
<P>    The director tries to light his film like it's noir: half of it takes
place in a nightclub and it shows.  When I came out of the theatre my eyes
hurt from the light changing so much.  He also tries to act like he's
Richard Donner, taking all that could have been a good scene from the Lethal
Weapon saga.  I can forgive him for it to, after all, he directed the cheap
film Johns, and someone whose done something that bad doesn't need to be
kicked when he's down.</P>
<P>    Unfortunately, the movie doesn't show us the same courtesy.</P>
<P>    Basically, frame one is the movie's high point and it goes down from
there.  Watching this movie, I understand which the Mad Bomber placed his
bombs under the seats of movie theatres.  Claire Danes, Omar Epps, and
Giovanni Ribsi make up a mod squad (insult to our intelligence: both terms
are defined at the beginning of the film) of undercover cops under the
command of Dennis Farina.  They stumble upon a drug conspiracy with corrupt
cops (What movies was that?  Take your pick.).  They find love, shoot the
bad guys, and act cool (they wear Ray Bans on a cop's salary).  And in the
end, the world is safe for democracy and even more drug dealers.</P>
<P>    No one does a good job in the movie, no one makes the façade of cool
stand up.  Even the target audience won't enjoy this film.  Face it, it
sucks.</P>
<P>    The film tries to be funny.  It fails.  It tries to be cool.  It fails
at that, too.  It tries to be enjoyable.  Strike three, you're out.</P>
