Susan Granger's review of "ORGAZMO" (Rogue Pictures/October Films)</PRE>
<P>      Before Trey Parker struck success with TV's "South Park," he
made a dreadful, scatological, NC-17 satire of parasitic, hard-core
pornography.  In this offensive opus, Parker plays a mild-mannered
Mormon missionary who agrees to appear in a porno film with Ron Jeremy
(a real-life porno star) in order to earn $20,000 so that he can be
married in the temple in Salt Lake City. Reassured that there will be
a "stunt penis" for penetration, he accepts the role of the XXX-rated
superhero Orgazmo, who crashes through cardboard walls to rescue
damsels who are being ravished by Jeremy. His secret weapon is his
Orgazmorator which stuns his enemies with multiple orgasms. Meanwhile,
his virginal fiancee (Robyn Lynne Raab) in Utah is curious about the
film, so the missionary says it's "Death of a Salesman." Intrigued,
she flies to Southern California, where she's soon kidnapped and tied
to a bed by the unscrupulous, foul-mouthed film-maker (Michael Dean
Jacobs).  The lame, shoddy, infantile excitement is confined to a huge
German shepherd humping a man's leg and a gray-haired granny swearing
like a Marine drill sergeant. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Orgazmo" is barely a 1. No yucks and a yawn - a dud.</P>
