<P>For years Hollywood made films with black and white characters -- only 
recently has it realised that people are not so simple, and come in shades of 
grey. Heroes are more flawed these days than they were fifty years ago, and 
villains no longer sit twiddling their moustaches, giggling maniacally or 
stroking kittens. Anthony Minghella is one of the few filmmakers whose work 
goes even further. He doesn't just throw his characters a few ambiguous 
traits. He makes us respond to them in challenging ways.</P>
<P>Consider his Oscar-winner "The English Patient", which required us to 
sympathise with the passion and pain of a man who could be cold, selfish and 
cowardly. And now "The Talented Mr. Ripley", adapted from the first novel in 
a series by Patricia Highsmith, whose hero is a deceptive psychopath we fear 
but feel compassion for.</P>
<P>His name is Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), a bathroom attendant who is mistakenly 
believed to be a graduate of Princeton University by rich shipbuilder Herbert 
Greenleaf (James Rebhorn). Tom is only happy to play along; later, to another 
character, he will admit his greatest talents to be "telling lies, forging 
signatures, impersonating practically anybody."</P>
<P>Greenleaf thinks Tom was a classmate of his son Dickie (Jude Law), and 
persuades him to take an all-expenses-paid trip to Italy for the purpose of 
bringing the chap back to America. Dickie is living in Mongibello with his 
girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), spending his easy-going days lounging on 
the beach in pursuit of such epicurean delights as eating, drinking, 
screwing, sailing and saxophone-playing.</P>
<P>Tom ingratiates himself without difficulty, and has a great time living with 
Dickie and Marge, accompanying them on all their adventures. He's a yes-man, 
always smiling, wanting to be shown things; he makes Dickie feel important. 
But the rich brat gets fed up with this, and decides to toss Tom aside. "We 
should spend some time apart," he says. "You can be a leech! You bore me!"</P>
<P>Tom's response is to murder the man (who he had fallen in love with), assume 
his identity and use it to arrange a life for himself in Rome. He changes his 
appearance just enough to match Dickie's passport photo, checks into hotels 
under his name, buys things with his traveller's checks. It's better to be a 
fake somebody, he reckons, than a real nobody.</P>
<P>I expected "The Talented Mr. Ripley" to be one of those movies where we get 
some sort of dark glee out of the protagonist's villainous actions. And it 
could have worked well on that level, but Minghella's sincerity makes it 
something more compelling -- a torrent of conflicting emotions, like I 
suggested in my opening paragraphs. We share the love and anger Tom feels 
toward Dickie, because he is a selfish child who treats other people as 
playthings, but does become wonderfully warm when paying attention to 
someone. We agree with Dickie's eventual judgement that Tom is creepy and 
phoney, and yet it seems so unfair, because we sense Tom had never had any 
good fortune before meeting Dickie and Marge.</P>
<P>The biggest contradiction throughout the film is the one between our 
revulsion and seduction. Dickie's life is a grotesquely lazy one, and Tom 
living it as an impostor is downright evil, but then again, we can sort of 
see the attraction. Minghella has updated the setting of the novel by almost 
a decade, so the story now takes place in the late '50s, and coincides with 
Italy's 'dolce vita' period. Cinematographer John Seale captures its dreamy, 
boozy atmosphere with images of rich, luxurious colour, and it is, as Tom 
puts it, "one big love affair".</P>
<P>Even the earliest moments of this, though, have an underlying tension to 
them. Before meeting Dickie and Marge, Tom has introduced himself as Dickie 
to a cute young woman named Meredith (Cate Blanchett), so from the outset we 
know he's plotting something. Meredith forms a fascination with Tom that acts 
as an ironic counterpoint to his own obsession with Dickie, but her character 
is really in the movie to complicate the plot. A lot of its second half, you 
see, revolves around Tom keeping up both of his identities, and much tension 
is generated by this one idea, with Tom having to carry on creating lies to 
keep his head above water with different sets of people. The longer he goes 
without getting discovered, the more tense things get, because it's more 
improbable he can stay in control of such a labyrinthine web of deceit.</P>
<P>At the centre of this breathtaking thriller are some great performances. Law 
and Philip Seymour Hoffman are perfect as young, arrogant members of the idle 
rich, giddily staggering around with excited eyes, ecstatic at both the 
beauty of their surroundings and the knowledge they could buy them. Paltrow 
is uncomplicated, clear and honest as the one normal character in the 
picture, who eventually realises what Tom's up to, but can't get anyone to 
believe her. And then there is Damon, who struts with force and confidence 
when pretending to be Dickie, but plays Tom as someone constantly faking a 
nervous and plain front. That's pathetic, because it shows he's got no 
confidence in his own personality, and chilling, because he doesn't mind 
killing for somebody else's.</P>
