                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Based on a true story, this is a delightful romantic comedy with
the lovely Phoebe Cates as a woman who shows up in an English village
in the year 1817, wearing a turban and speaking a language no one there
has ever heard.  With her expressive hands and eyes she conveys that
her name is Caraboo.   Knowing nothing about her, the authorities jail
her for vagrancy but her manner is so regal that she wins the attention
of the local aristocrats, Mr. and Mrs. Worrall (Jim Broadbent and Wendy
Hughes), when she conveys to them that she is a princess.</P>
<P>     Among the skeptics is newspaperman Gutch (Stephen Rea) who, while
trying to get to the bottom of the mystery, finds himself falling for
Caraboo.  The Worrall butler, (Kevin Kline) is another who suspects she
is a fake but is taken in by her charm.  An Oxford academic, Professor
Wilkinson (John Lithgow), is brought in to check Caraboo's authenticity
but he, too, becomes enamored of her. Should she prove to be a
charlatan, the sentence would be death.</P>
<P>     All the cast (Cates and Kline are married in real life) are
exactly right for their roles so that the story's romance and comedy
are completely believable.  Kline. wearing a large mustache, and
dressed in livery, is sneaky.  Rea (THE CRYING GAME) tries to hold back
from succumbing to Caraboo's beauty while Lithgow (THE WORLD ACCORDING
TO GARP and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT) at first says Caraboo is a fake but
one look at her and he changes his mind in a hurry.</P>
<P>     The film follows the rather weird but true story very closely and
knowing that, it enhances the entertainment value.  John Wells, who
co-wrote the script with Director Michael Austin, has written a book,
PRINCESS CARABOO: HER TRUE STORY, which is being published in
September.</P>
