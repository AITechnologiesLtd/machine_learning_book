<PRE>FOUR ROOMS</PRE>
<P>Get Ready for the Wildest New Years Eve of your life.</P>
<P>Witches, cauldrons, lesbians, and bitches, that's what lies in Allison
Anders segment of this bizarre anthology about the money-crazed dealing with
crazier people Bellhop Ted, who's sole motivation becomes tips in an ever
growing amount. And he'll do whatever to get them. He'll screw a
witch/midwife in a cauldron, helping resurrect a god. He'll watch two
psychotic children of a Mexican gangster and his alcoholic wife. He might,
just might (gasp) CUT OFF NORMAN'S LILLE' ....</P>
<PRE>I've said too much.</PRE>
<P>This isn't a movie you should see if you hate profanity or violence, it has
plenty of both, but has to be on your list if you like the Black Comedies
that Lawrence Bender, the producer of Pulp Fiction, turns out.</P>
<P>The basic plot of the movie is you have Ted, the greedy bellhop doing his
first night on the job on New Year's Eve. A coven of witches resurrects
their goddess Diana and, because of such, the entire hotel goes mad in one
night, and each successive room reflects the madness.</P>
<P>The segments, directed by Allison Anders, Alexander Rockwell, Robert
Rodreguiz  and Quentin Tarantino (in that order) are miraculously
interwoven, perfectly locked in (I.E. The third segment becomes part of the
second segment when someone calls room 409, where a psychosexual drama is
being played out with a big gun, a tied up woman, and the bellhop. The
little girl asks if they have a syringe in their room. The other end says
"No, kid, we don't have any of those in our room. Just a big fucking gun.
How does that strike you?". The girl jovially responds "Thanks."), darkly
comic (the best I've ever seen) and well-produced.</P>
<P>Unlike PF, it doesn't have any deeper meaning, no social commentary or
redeeming value, but, should you have a taste for the bittersweet black
comedy, then you will NEVER regret checking out Four Rooms.</P>
