Reviewed November 23, 1999.</P>
<P>Documentarian Doug Block won raves in 1995 (and I was one of them) for his 
quietly poignant "Jupiter's Wife," about a homeless woman living in NYC's 
Central Park. His latest film, made in 1996 and premiering at the 1999 
Sundance Film Festival, is "Home Page," an alternately fascinating and 
disappointing look at the way the Internet has changed peoples' lives since 
1996, the first year it officially caught on with growing popularity. The 
documentary is fascinating because its subject is about something that I, 
myself, am intrigued with. Ever since getting AOL in the summer of 1997, my 
life has been altered in many way, and all for the better. Not only is it an 
enormous outlet in which you can do almost anything on, but it also has paved 
the way for what I am doing right now--writing film reviews and attempting to 
get my voice heard in the profession. </P>
<P>What makes "Home Page" unsatisfying on many levels, however, is its shaky, 
flawed storytelling. Centering, in large part, on Justin Hall, a fellow 
student at his son's school, Swarthmore College, what starts as a film on 
Block's own daughter quickly turns as he is overtaken by Justin's obsession 
with the net and his own home page (www.links.net). Justin, an alternatively 
dressed and groomed 21-year-old, is a self-proclaimed "physical embodiment of 
the Internet," a young man who has no qualms about revealing the most 
personal things about himself and the people around him on his site. 
Temporarily moving from New York City to San Francisco to stay with Howard 
Rheingold, his mentor, Justin becomes involved in launching Howard's aspiring 
"virtual community" website, called Electric Minds. </P>
<P>>From here on, the film branches off on several different paths, as we meet 
other web site fanatics, including a few of the employees at Justin's former 
intern job at HotWired, such Julie Petersen and Carl Steadman. Of note, Julie 
reminisces about leaving her husband for Patrick Farley, a fellow web 
designer. </P>
<P>Through everything, "Home Page" always leads right back to the life of 
Justin. While an eccentric, interesting individual, and the only person whose 
life and website is really delved satisfactorily into, filmmaker Doug Block's 
misstep is in relegating the other people virtually into the background. 
Also, Block disregards quite a lot of other aspects of the Internet and that 
of home pages, and so the film always seems one-sided, as we never are given 
a glimpse into others' relationships with this great, recent technological 
advancement.</P>
<P>In discussing the titled subject, its details remain sketchy, at best. Rarely 
are we ever shown the content on the people's pages, with Block seemingly 
leaving it up to the viewers to go see for themselves when he pops up each of 
the characters' home page addresses at the film's conclusion. Why make a film 
about something, and then not even attempt an effort in exploring that topic? 
As Doug Block follows Justin around more and more, he is inspired to create 
his own site. One scene in which he is trying to learn how to set his page 
up, and is shown to be absolutely delighted when he begins to catch on to 
webmaking, may have been an ultra-realistic portrait of human nature. Block 
botches the effect, however, by not pointing the camera at the computer 
screen to show us what he is looking at or doing.</P>
<P>"Home Page," which is currently in limited theatrical release and is then 
expected to go to cable and home video, is filmed in a very matter-of-fact 
way, with not enough insight into the World Wide Web or home pages to be 
fully recommended. One of Block's goals is to show how a portion of the world 
population has been so romanced by the Internet that they are at a point 
where they can function far better through a computer, rather than in real 
life. The Internet, you see, is sort of like an alternate-reality reality, in 
which many people can speak their mind more honestly through a screen because 
it is a more protected environment. If you don't like something, you can just 
close it and not look at it, but in life, it isn't as simple as that. Block 
is successful in relaying this message, but the target audience (Internet 
fans), I suspect, already knows this. "Home Page" is a documentary not nearly 
intimate enough in its portrait of the people the film inhabits. For 
webaholics, at least its never boring, even at a prolonged 102 minutes.</P>
<P>Special Note: If "Home Page" is not worth the trip to the movie theater or, 
later on, the video store, the film is currently available to download--for 
free--at the <A HREF="http://www.ifilm.net/">IFILM</A> web site. Anyone 
interested in the topic is urged to at least seek the film out here. </P>
