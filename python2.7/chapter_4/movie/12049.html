<P>Shooting Fish (PG) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>Dylan (Dan Futterman) and Jez (Stuart Townsend) have made a career out of
"shooting fish"--i.e. pulling off con jobs.  Dylan is the cocky
smooth-talking Yank who masterminds each elaborate schemes; the Burt
Bacharach-loving Jez is the socially-impaired British technogeek whose
electronic wizardry makes such swindles possible.  A host of complications,
romantic and otherwise, arise after sweet medical student Georgie (Kate
Beckinsale) joins their fold, helping the boys out in the belief that the
illegally-obtained proceeds go toward building an orphanage.</P>
<P>Director/co-writer (with Richard Holmes) Stefan Schwartz has crafted a
light, easy-going fluff piece whose pleasance is elevated by the appeal of
the top trio of actors, particularly the pixie-tressed Beckinsale.
Unfortunately, her main subplot about a loveless engagement is so poorly
developed it seems like an afterthought, even as it eventually takes center
stage toward film's end.  But the more curious miscalculation is that, for
a comedy, Shooting Fish is rather light on real laughs.  There's a sly dig
at the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but a number of the big con scenes
are more amusing than funny.  However, there is a certain amount of charm
about the film, which is as agreeable as it is refreshingly unpretentious.

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
