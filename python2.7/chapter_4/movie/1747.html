<PRE>                        NATIONAL LAMPOON'S LOADED WEAPON 1
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

<P>     Jack Colt (Emilio Estevez) is a burnt-out, alcoholic cop pining for
his lost dog.  Wes Luger (Samuel L. Jackson) is a straight-laced,
by-the-book officer days away from retirement.  When Luger's ex-partner
is killed, the two are brought together to investigate.  They soon
discover that the murder is only the tip of the iceberg.  The evil
General Mortars (William Shatner) is hatching a plot to begin massive
shipments of drugs via Wilderness Girl cookies.</P>
<P>     As expected, LOADED WEAPON 1 is pure spoof.  While its obvious
target is the LETHAL WEAPON series (with Estevez playing a Riggs-type,
Jackson playing a Murtaugh-type, and Lovitz doing a bad impression of
Joe Pesci), it sets a few other recent films in its sites as well,
including SILENCE OF THE  LAMBS, BASIC INSTINCT, and WAYNE'S WORLD.
There are cameos galore (by such notables as Whoopi Goldberg, Charlie
Sheen, Bruce Willis, James Doohan,  Dr. Joyce Brothers, and others),
and a seemingly endless supply of puns and sight gags.  Yet somehow the
movie never quite clicks.</P>
<P>     LOADED WEAPON 1 aspires to be a NAKED GUN, but Emilio Estevez has 
neither the screen presence nor the deadpan delivery of Leslie Nielsen.
Also, with the recent release of so many other films of this sort, the
luster is beginning to fade.  They're not as clever or quirky as they
once were.</P>
<P>     LOADED WEAPON 1 has its funny moments.  There isn't much subtlety
in the humor--it's up front and obvious.  There is a whole barrage of
jokes--several per scene.  Predictably, some work and others don't,
and while the film isn't a credit-to-credit barrel of laughs, you would
have to be made of stone not to at least chuckle once or twice.</P>
<P>     The cast is mostly unremarkable.  The most memorable performances
are turned in by the various cameos.  Bruce Willis' somewhat unexpected
appearance is perhaps the shining moment of the movie, although James
Doohan's brief scene is almost as good.  Of the "regulars", William
Shatner is especially disappointing  Given his propensity for
over-the-top acting, I expected a scenery-chewing romp.  Instead, what
he delivers is bland and of the "hand me the check so I can get out of
here" variety.  He's flat, boring, and completely wrong for the role.</P>
<P>     Basically, the film is unremarkable.  There's nothing new or
original in it, so there isn't any compelling reason to see it.  With
much better fare of this sort available on video (AIRPLANE, THE NAKED
GUN, etc.), renting a tape will be more satisfying, not to mention
cost-effective.  LOADED WEAPON 1 is good for a few laughs, but it's a
rather feeble feature-length film.</P>
<PRE>                         Rating:  6.0 (C, **)</PRE>
