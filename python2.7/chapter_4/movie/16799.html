<P>Confucius once said, "Governing a nation is like cooking a small fish --
don't overdo it." His maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy
script, for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an
amateur scribe can make. Granted, Mike Judge, writer-director of the
workplace satire OFFICE SPACE isn't exactly an amateur (his most
infamous work, the MTV series "Beavis and Butt-head" was pure gold for
its network). But unfailingly, Judge manages to make some rather
inexcusable mistakes in OFFICE SPACE by spreading an iffy plot over too
much ground. </P>
<P>The iffiness in Judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall
of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal. In fact, based on the
popularity of Scott Adams' cartoon "Dilbert," which will soon have its
own television series, a satirical view of the American workplace is a
hot item in Hollywood. Unfortunately the concept lends itself to
skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of
"Saturday Night Live" rather than a full-length feature. The most
convincing evidence of this are the trailers for OFFICE SPACE, which
feature almost all of the movie's top content; this leaves the actual
picture appearing very deflated. </P>
<P>Other evidence of OFFICE SPACE's failure to work are its lack of good
jokes. The comedy is marginally funny at best, but not enough to get a
packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud. The material in the
movie is on-key for an older demographic than Judge is used to
targeting, and this could partially explain his work here. However, the
movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to
allow for any excuse. </P>
<P>The plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers, headed up by
Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), at a company named Initech. After the
movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at
Initech, the movie introduces us to two consultants (John C. McGinley
and Paul Willson) which are in charge of "downsizing" the company's
payroll. When Peter and his gang learns of this, as well as the reason
behind it -- so their smooth talking boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole)'s
stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall. </P>
<P>The circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious
but they come out as anything but. A sympathetic cast and a muddled
Jennifer Aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one
together, but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more
intelligent. </P>
