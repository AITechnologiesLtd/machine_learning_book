<PRE>                           Air Force One 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
              2 :-) :-)  for the perfect American President</PRE>

<P>When a 50 year old man dances about an aeroplane dispatching terrorists
half his age, I begin to understand the terms "Gung Ho" or "Big balls
with small jocks". This man is a "Congressional Medal of Honour" winner,
he served in NAM and is also a devoted husband and loving father. He is
a man who has impeccable character and would without hesitation place
his family and Nation above himself. He is the President of the Untied
States.</P>
<P>Wait a minute. Am I missing something here? We are talking about the
President of the Untied States. You mean people like Clinton, Reagan,
Bush and maybe Gore? Or have we somehow confused them with Hollywood
action heroes like Segal, Van Damme, or Harrison Ford per se. Then
again what we want to believe and what we actually have is two different
things, and believe me the President of the United States is no action
hero.</P>
<P>If anything this movies serves to give the American People a good reason
to pat themselves on the back. It seems condescending when they dish out
freebie favours for a struggling Russian government made to look weak
and pathetic in the movie. What gives them the right to take the burden
of protecting the free world upon their own shoulders?  What's happened
to the United Nations? This is two hours worth of solid American
patriotic propaganda. When the Vice President is a female and the
President is an action hero we delude ourselves into believing the world
is almost perfect. The day that I actually see an American President
actually follow through with the claim that he well put world justice
and peace above his own political agenda, will also be the day I apply for
citizenship.</P>
<P>However unbelievable this movie maybe, it did make me hyperventilate
with laughter, and I laughed harder than most in the cinema. So if one
can put aside their disbelief that this is actually an Amercian
President come fighting machine, the action will keep you entertained
for the duration of the flight and fight. Harrison Ford is getting
older, and it is becoming more difficult to see him kill men half his
age and twice his size in hand to hand combat. Gary Oldman has that
something Russian worked out to the fine details of facial tics, stares
and hand gestures. It is unlikely that Air Force One will ever be
hi-jacked, but should the scenario occur it should be interesting to
follow the outcome. That way we can look back and see how wrong this
movie actually is.</P>
