<P>Washington Square (PG) *** (out of ****)
The Wings of the Dove (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>With each fall movie season comes a rash of literary adaptations dangled
like bait in the Academy voter pool, and more often than not these films
derive from the work of a single classic author.  This year's featured
author is Henry James, whose Washington Square and The Wings of the Dove
are brought to the screen in intelligent, skillfully crafted translations
that tower over last year's James adaptation, Jane Campion's maddeningly
obtuse The Portrait of a Lady.</P>
<P>Washington Square centers on the romance between gawky, naive Catherine
Sloper (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the daughter of the wealthy Dr. Austin
Sloper (Albert Finney), and dashing but penniless Morris Townsend (Ben
Chaplin).  Naturally, their relationship does not sit well with Austin, who
suspects Morris's true motives--after all, how could a poor young man
honestly be enamored by the meek and woefully unrefined Catherine?--and
does all within his power to keep his daughter and the suspected golddigger
apart.</P>
<P>Agnieszka Holland's film is a joy to look at, yet for a film that focuses
on a grand passion, the final product is strangely cold and distant.  But
that shortcoming is made up for by the work of the cast.  Leigh may sound
like a peculiar casting choice for a costume drama, but her trademark
mannerisms and mumbly elocution are a perfect fit for the insecure, awkward
Catherine.  She has a nice rapport with the charming Chaplin, who sports a
convincing Yank accent.  Finney's Austin makes a despicable, yet archly
funny, villain, and Maggie Smith provides some delightful comic relief as
Catherine's hopelessly romantic Aunt Lavinia.</P>
<P>A more involving James adaptation is Iain Softley's swifter-moving and
more understated The Wings of the Dove, which takes a more complex slant on
the rich girl-poor boy romance.  The woman of wealth here is Kate Croy
(Helena Bonham Carter), who has a forbidden affair with common journalist
Merton Densher (Linus Roache).  Kate and Merton long to marry, but Kate
refuses to give up her lofty position in society and the luxuries her
snobby aunt (Charlotte Rampling) provides her.  When wealthy, ailing
American Milly Theale (Alison Elliott) arrives in London, Kate and a
reluctant Merton engage in a cruel scheme that could ultimately enable them
to marry without sacrificing Kate's riches.</P>
<P>What makes Wings soar above the fairly black-and-white Washington are the
richly shaded characters and relationships, brought to vivid life by the
central trio of actors.  Despite her evil plot, Bonham Carter never allows
the audience to lose the feeling that Kate truly does care about
Milly--it's just that she cares about herself even more.  Predictably,
Merton develops feelings for Milly as well, but Softley and Roache wisely
do not spell out whom he loves more, which creates genuine dramatic
tension.  Milly is weak in body, but deceptively so; inside she is strong
in spirit and quite clear of mind. The sparkling Elliott, who was just
about the only redeeming quality of last year's dreadfully overwrought
Sundance sensation The Spitfire Grill, delivers a quiet performance that is
astonishing in its power, most notably during a climactic tete-a-tete
between Milly and Merton.</P>
<P>Whether or not Washington Square and The Wings of the Dove, which have
both received favorable notices from critics, garner the hoped-for Oscar
nominations remains to be seen; there is no question, however, that they
are both quality pieces of filmmaking, with Wings being the worthier
contender.</P>
