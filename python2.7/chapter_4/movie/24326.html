<PRE>_Committed_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"Committed" is what Joline (Heather Graham) is to her deadbeat husband
Carl (Luke Wilson) through thick and thin, for better or for worse. 
Audiences, however, are likely not to feel the same devotion to Lisa
Krueger's stridently offbeat comedy of the same name.</P>
<P>Because of Graham, viewers are likely to at least develop a commitment
to seeing this film through to the end.  An innately likable actress, she
carries the screen with ease in this, her first lead role.  But as the
film progresses, that likability relates less and less to the character
she plays.  Joline's dogged determination to make her marriage work first
comes off as admirable, even as she makes her long road journey from New
York to El Paso, Texas to locate Carl, who runs off without warning after
597 seemingly happy days of wedlock.</P>
<P>Once she's there, Joline shadows Carl not unlike a stalker, keeping
watch over him without making her presence known.  She does, however,
connect with some of the locals, namely Neil (Goran Visnjic), Carl's next
door neighbor, who has designs on Joline; Carmen (Patricia Velasquez),
Carl's new girlfriend--that is, until she meets and befriends Joline; and
Carmen's grandfather (Alfonso Arau), who shares his gift of the mystical
with Joline.</P>
<P>Most of _Committed_'s attempts at humor come from these supporting
characters, namely their quirks.  Neil is an artist who makes piñatas. 
Carmen is a waitress who regularly sneaks a taste of the drinks and
dishes she serves.  Joline's brother Jay (Casey Affleck) is as
commitment-shy as she is committed.  Each one of these characters can be
described as off-center, but little eccentricities can only go so far in
holding an audience's attention--and even less in making them laugh.</P>
<P>And, ultimately, it's up to the peripheral characters and their foibles
to do that job because the lead character becomes such a drag to hang
around with.  Of course, Carl discovers Joline, and after that point her
efforts to hold onto him seem less believable and reasonable.  While one
never comes to the point of hating her, one does stop liking her and
starts to pity her, for she is clearly out of her mind.  This shift is
somewhat expected--after all, rarely do films bearing a double-edged name
not end up relating to both meanings--but that doesn't make the turn
easier to swallow or the film more enjoyable to sit through.</P>
<P>I understand the point Krueger was trying to make--namely, the question
of when devotion becomes obsession, and knowing when to let go.  But in
_Committed_, she has somehow made this potentially provocative subject
boring.</P>
