<PRE>Sorcerer (1977)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 74</PRE>
<P>What is the worst movie title in film history?
"Beavis and Butt-head Do America" and
"Scudda-Hoo! Scudda-Hay!" are candidates, but
"Sorcerer" is also a contender.  Not because the
title itself is awful, but because it has virtually
nothing do with the film.</P>
<P>"Sorcerer" is a remake of the 1953 French film
"Wages of Fear".  I have not seen the original,
so I can't compare the two versions.  But it
would have to be an excellent film to top the
remake.  "Sorcerer" is an extremely tense and
dramatic film that should keep you on the
edge of your seat.</P>
<P>The film begins with several loose ends: we meet
a Palestinian terrorist (Anidou), a failed French
banker (Bruno Cremer), a hit man (Francisco Rabal)
and an American bank robber (Roy Scheider).  It
turns out that these four strangers have much
in common: they are criminals with their lives
in danger, and must flee somewhere where they
cannot be found.  They each end up in a rural
slum in Nicaragua.</P>
<P>An act of sabotage at an oil refinery causes a
massive fire, which can only be extinguished with
dynamite.  The only available dynamite is 200 miles.
Volunteers are needed for the near-suicidal, but
high-paying job of transferring the dynamite by
truck to the fire.  The four criminals, desperate
for cash, volunteer for the job.</P>
<P>Since "Sorcerer" is an American film, Scheider has
the biggest role.  He hardly gets to smile the entire
film, and spends most of it struggling to get
the dynamite-laden truck across rickety bridges
and nearly-impassable roads.  Character development
is marginal, and we don't see these men beyond
desperate outlaws.  Cremer is the exception, as
we get glimpses of his married and business life
before having to flee France, and in Nicaragua there
are traces of a romance with a silent middle-aged
laborer.</P>
<P>"Sorcerer" is directed by William Friedkin, whose two
previous films, "The French Connection" and "The Exorcist",
achieved much greater commercial success.  But all three
films favor action, cinematography and story over
character development and dialogue, and since all three
are good films, Friedkin may have been onto something.</P>
