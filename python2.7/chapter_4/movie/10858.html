<P>     ZERO EFFECT is a perfect example of how the medium in which a story 
is told can affect one's opinion of it.  As a made-for-TV movie/series 
pilot, ZERO EFFECT would hold a great deal of promise:  it introduces 
offbeat characters like Daryl Zero (Bill Pullman) and Steve Arlo (Ben 
Stiller), who, over time, might become viewer favorites.  And the 
premise -- a modern-day Sherlock Holmes -- while not tremendously 
original, has at least as much promise as COLUMBO.  But there's a 
problem:  ZERO EFFECT is not intended as the forerunner of a weekly 
television program; it's designed as a theatrical motion picture, and, 
in that category, it turns out to be disappointingly ordinary.</P>
<P>     Just in case there's any confusion, let me state at the outset that 
there's no doubt that writer/director Jake Kasdan (son of Lawrence) 
intended this to be an homage to (that sounds so much nicer than "rip 
off of") Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictitious detective.  Zero 
shares several key characteristics with Holmes:  both are loners by 
nature who avoid emotional entanglements and base their seemingly-
miraculous deductions on objectivity and observation.  The relationship 
between Zero and Arlo isn't unlike that of Holmes and his faithful 
assistant, Watson.  And Kasdan has lifted elements from Doyle's "A 
Scandal in Bohemia."  In that story, Holmes meets Irene Adler, the 
female who will forever be known to him as "the woman."  In ZERO EFFECT, 
the protagonist meets Gloria Sullivan (Kim Dickens), who will forever be 
known to him as "the woman."</P>
<P>     That said, ZERO EFFECT isn't a direct re-writing of "A Scandal in 
Bohemia" -- the details are different.  For a mystery, the plot is 
suitably convoluted, and there are a few surprise twists (most of which 
can be guessed by a seasoned fan of the genre -- the script is 
competent, but not excessively clever).  The basic premise has Zero 
pulled out of his reclusive existence to investigate the blackmail of a 
prominent businessman (Ryan O'Neal).  Of course, he isn't told the 
entire truth and it's up to him to uncover the hidden facts.  In the 
process, Zero, who is brilliant at his work but inept at interpersonal 
interaction, finds himself fascinated by a woman, Gloria, whom he meets 
at a gym.  But is she involved in the case, or just an innocent 
bystander?</P>
<P>     Lately, actor Bill Pullman has been making a conscious attempt to 
change his "Mr. Nice Guy" image -- a personae that was solidified by his 
portrayal of the too-good-to-be-true President in INDEPENDENCE DAY.  
Since then, Pullman has played a couple of sleazy characters in bizarre 
movies (LOST HIGHWAY and THE END OF VIOLENCE).  Now, he adds Zero, a man 
who can be "tactless, inept… and rude," to his resume.  It's a role that 
Pullman pulls off with aplomb.  Ben Stiller is adequate (although no 
more) as the put-upon Arlo.  Not surprisingly, some of the funniest 
moments of the film involve Stiller, but the actor and his character 
all-but-vanish after the film's first half-hour.  The casting flaw is 
Kim Dickens, who fails to imbue Gloria with much life or passion.  Worse 
still, her interaction with Zero doesn't generate more than a few fitful 
sparks.  As essayed by Dickens, this woman hardly seems like the type 
who would interfere with the world's greatest private investigator's 
practice of the "fine art of detachment."</P>
<P>     For its first thirty minutes, ZERO EFFECT is actually quite 
enjoyable -- it's funny, off-beat, and fresh.  The script has some 
moments of near brilliance (consider the security measures Arlo has to 
go through to gain entrance to his boss' abode), and, for a while, ZERO 
EFFECT looks like it could be headed in the direction of a satire.  
However, time proves this not to be the case and, as the plot moves more 
into the arena of the traditional mystery, the proceedings drift into an 
auto-pilot mode with generic story elements and predictable plot twists.  
Ultimately, the film seems like it's about fifteen minutes too long, and 
there are enough scenes that don't work that it's not hard to pick out 
candidates for deletion.  Kasdan maintains a light tone throughout, 
which is fortunate, since it prevents the movie from sinking into 
ponderousness.  ZERO EFFECT is a mixed bag, and it's sure to look a lot 
better when it eventually reaches HBO than it does playing on the big 
screen at the local multiplex.</P>
