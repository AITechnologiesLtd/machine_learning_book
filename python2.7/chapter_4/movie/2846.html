                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<P>     Naming a movie after a song is dangerous business, but CORRINA,
CORRINA swings almost as well as its namesake.  This enjoyable comedy
from the fifties stars Ray Liotta as a just-lost-mom dad with an
8-year-old daughter (Tina Majorino) who has stayed mute (or, ahem, mum)
ever since since the funeral.  Only after he hires maid Corrina (Whoopi
Goldberg), does life return to both his daughter and his home.</P>
<P>     CORRINA, CORRINA is clunky as all get-out, with some glaring
anachronisms and way-too-broad humor, such as Joan Cusack arriving in
padding (!) as Nanny Number One.  Director Jessie Nelson shoots every
other shot like a home movie and that's doesn't help much, either.  The
story picks up in the second hour, though, when the characters suddenly
"click."</P>
<P>     Liotta is good as the vulnerable father--the actor has a subtle
range that's worth watching here.  Goldberg is also good, though her
uncharacteristic (for that era) combination of "smarts 'n' sass" take a
little longer to get used to.  Majorino, as the daughter, is precious.</P>
<PRE>     There's even a strong anti-smoking slant!</PRE>
