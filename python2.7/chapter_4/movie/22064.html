<PRE>DOGMA</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Alan
Rickman, Janeane Garofalo, Jason Lee, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith
DIRECTOR:  Kevin Smith
WRITTEN BY:  Kevin Smith</P>
<P>In the North America of the late 90's, a time and place wherein the
description "devout Catholic" is an oxymoron, you wouldn't think a film
like Dogma would have had trouble finding a distributor, much less
require the painfully self-embarrassed disclaimer which precedes it.
Surely even the most pious, guilt-ridden RC couldn't possibly take
offense to something Smith rightly calls a "comic fantasy," something so
purposely irreverent it rivals the Great Schism for sheer,
laugh-out-loud ludicrousness.  I mean, come on.  We're talking about a
movie that features Damon and Affleck as fallen angels (complete with
really fake-looking wings) who discover a policy loophole that will
either allow them to get back into Heaven with a clean slate-- or cause
the obliteration of everything, depending on whom you ask.  We're
talking about dusky-voiced Fiorentino as a heroine whose family tree
contains more 'begot's than the Book of Genesis, and Chris Rock as
"Rufus, the Thirteenth Apostle," who insists he was written out of the
Bible because he's black.  We're talking about inspired bits of ironic
casting like Alanis Morissette as God, or better yet, George Carlin as a
Cardinal who interprets Jesus' "Let the children come unto me," as "Get
'em when they're young."  We're talking about stoners Jay and Silent Bob
(Jason Mewes and Smith, who show up as these same characters in every
Smith movie) as prophets, fer chrissakes.  By all rights, a film this
goofy should have inspired nothing more than simple indifference, and
not just in Catholics.</P>
<P>Yet for the most part, it all clicks.  Damon and Affleck are ideal as
millennia-old buddies; their scenes together have a seemingly
effortless, comfortable ease, and they even get to poke fun at
speculation about their offscreen relationship.  Certain corporate
idolaters are slammed mercilessly, to hilarious effect.  Even Jay's
juvenile, expletive-riddled banter, annoying as it can be, often
provides a shockingly funny counterpoint when the going threatens to get
serious.  The film does lose some steam in the late going, however, and
the ending doesn't match the promise of the first half.  Still, Dogma
ends up being a thoughtful and heartfelt expression of Smith's simple
message about the difference between ideas and beliefs, faith and
religion, and why we're all here.</P>
