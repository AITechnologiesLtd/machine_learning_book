<PRE>                               THE BIRDCAGE
                       A film review by Will FitzHugh
                        Copyright 1997 Will FitzHugh</PRE>
<P>Yes!  Finally, Hollywood makes a version of 'La Cage Aux Folles'
that the average American can appreciate.  Now that we've been
softened up by the adorable 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and 'To Wong Foo,
Thanks for Everything, Lee Meriweather', cross-dressing and
homosexuality can be funny without being disturbing to grandma
and grandpa.</P>
<P>This is good, I suppose.  Better than 'Philadelphia' which seemed
like a calculated 'gay' movie and much better than director Mike
Nichols' recent work ('Wolf', 'Working Girl', 'Regarding Henry'
and the massively disappointing and suppressed 'Closing Time').
There's political humor as a gay couple's son wants to marry the
daughter of an Alan Simpson-like ultra-conservative senator (played
by Gene Hackman, who Simpson might want to consider as a double the
next time he angers reasonable citizens.  Full-time job, that).
He somehow convinces his parents, Robin Williams (not in a dress, and 
luckily, much less annoying than he is on talk shows) and
Nathan Lane, to act like a nuclear family for the senator and his
wife (Dianne Wiest, doing an impersonation of a giant mouse).  This
plan is doomed to failure but good for lots of laughs.</P>
<P>The cast is rounded out by Hank 'Apu' Azaria as the nutty houseboy
Agador and Christine Baranski (from 'Cybill') as Williams' ex-wife.
Lane's mincing wears a bit thin in spots but he picks up a full head of
steam when impersonating the traditional mom that the senator expects.
Hackman, who realizes somethings up, takes to mom as a Barbara Bush-
type wonder woman and forms an opinion of Williams as a playboy.
Well, the whole charade unravels, people fall down, there's a fair
amount of semi-naughty good humor and a happy ending.  I had a good
time at this movie, really, but let's think about this a minute.</P>
<P>After seeing a few Hollywood 'gay' flicks, your average small-town
moron thinks that these people are funny, good with makeup and have
nice tans.  A lot of them have kids and ex-wives, too, for some
reason.  Makes a good link to the heterosexual world, I reckon.  The
closest 'The Birdcage' comes to sex is some risque dinnerware and the
closest Nichols comes to any lasting satire is Hackman in a dress.  He
doesn't seem to realize that crowd-pleasing can only get you so far.
Alan Simpson would have taken one look at that white knee-length item
and foamed at the mouth.  I realize the ending was probably the same in
the French version so he can use that as an excuse but sharper writing
could have made more of this.</P>
<P>You fuck!  Can't even go out for a good laugh without bringing politics
into it.  You and Robert Redford can go make boring movies together in
your Aspen love-nest.  Hollywood big shots have just as much right to
free expression of thought as Barbara Streisand does.  People who want
a little current events can go suck on Barbara Walter's (or Hugh
Downs', if you must) glass teat and shut up so I can relax after a hard
days work at Philip Morris.  Now go home and wait for Sylvester
Stallone's or Demi Moore's (I can't tell them apart in a PG-13 flick)
next movie and leave me alone.</P>
