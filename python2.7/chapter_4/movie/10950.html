<PRE>AS GOOD AS IT GETS</PRE>
<P>James L. Brooks loves people. He loves the way people form relationships,
the way they communicate, their emotions, their ups and downs and, above
all, their humanity. His films don't have epic narratives, digital special
effects or exotic locations. They often take place in city streets, cramped
apartments and suburban houses. The characters are everyday, down-to-earth
people who have their little eccentricities and personal problems but we
are left to admire their grace and integrity as they battle through life's
uncertainties. </P>
<P>AS GOOD AS IT GETS is James Brooks' most ambitious film in that he spends
more time on developing the characters here and the slim plot is incidental
rather than essential to the narrative. There is no rush to get to the
point. We're not quite sure where we are heading but we are enjoying the
ride and with Jack Nicholson leading us, we are quite content to allow the
film to indulge us in its many pleasures.</P>
<P>What I loved about this film was its honest depiction of three
emotionally-flawed characters, all on the verge of a mental breakdown.
Individually, they have scraped the bottom of life's barrel: Melvin
(Nicholson) is suffering from obsessive-compulsive behaviour, Carol (Hunt)
has a seriously ill asthmatic son and Simon (Kinnear) was viciously bashed
and is financially broke forcing him to end his career as an artist. These
are not your traditional movie heroes and this is not a conventional
Hollywood film. Its leisurely pace will unsettle a few viewers and its
reluctance to go for the easy solution may be annoying to some. However,
these qualities are its strengths and makes this the best film yet by
Brooks and, in my opinion, is on equal footing with THE ICE STORM as the
best film of the year. Don't be surprised if it picks up Best Picture
Oscar, either.</P>
<P>Films depicting romantic relationships between an older man and a woman 25
years his junior are few and far between. AS GOOD AS IT GETS is very
European in this way. The French have been producing romantic films of an
older man and a younger woman for years now. Just a few gems to mention
are: NELLY AND MR.ARNAUD, LA BELLE NOISSEUSE and THREE COLOURS RED (yes, it
was a romance). Brooks' film also shares their loose narrative style,
virtual absence of plot, exclusive concentration on character development
and disregard for neat resolutions. </P>
