                 Wyatt Earp (1994)
                 Tombstone  (1993)</PRE>
<P>Before the eruption of dueling volcano movies and dual impact of the
killer asteroid movies, there was the showdown between this pair of
cinematic takes on the life of Wyatt Earp and the now legendary gunfight
at the OK Corral.</P>
<P>Aside from being released within a year of each other, these two film
have little in common other than attempting to relate similar events. 
"Tombstone," released first, approaches the story as standard action
fare, while "Wyatt Earp" strives to be a "serious" biopic in the
tradition of "Patton."  Held up against their respective aspirations,
"Tombstone" is the more successful film, but it's a near thing.</P>
<P>The obvious place to begin is by comparing the actors portraying Wyatt
Earp.  Kurt Russell in "Tombstone" is the standard Kurt Russell
character with an 18-century mustache.  It's not a bad performance, but
it hardly distinguishes itself among Russell's recent performances.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp is much harder to evaluate.  He plays the
older Earp as an emotionally repressed man, so the range of his
performance is limited.  As the younger Earp, when the future lawman was
simply guarding a payroll wagon, before life had crushed all the
optimism out of him, Costner shows some sign of the goofy exuberance he
showed in "Silverado", his last collaboration with director Lawrence
Kasdan.  Overall, Costner's portrayal is superior but his Earp is often
so coldly unlikable that it's hard to care much about him.</P>
<P>One similarity between the two films is fact that the actor playing John
"Doc" Holliday steals all the scenes he is in. </P>
<P>Val Kilmer's role in "Tombstone" is showier and more comedic.  He plays
Holliday as an effete Rhett Butler with a droll wit.  In "Wyatt Earp"
Dennis Quaid simply disappears into his role, pulling a reverse DeNiro
by losing 43 pounds to play the tubercular Holliday.  His character has
his own form of wit, but it's colder and harder than Kilmer's.  Also,
Quaid does a far better job of portraying the effects of Holliday's
tuberculosis.  Kilmer never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu,
except when its dramatically necessary for him to look worse.  The
downside is that Quaid's Holliday doesn't appear until the film is half
over and gets a lot less screen time than Kilmer does.</P>
<P>As history, "Wyatt Earp" holds a sizable lead in accuracy over
"Tombstone" although its fidelity to the facts is questionable in a lot
of areas.  Interestingly, they both take the same liberty with the
shooting of Morgan and Virgil Earp, condensing events two weeks apart
into a single night.  </P>
<P>Of course, key to both films is their depiction of the events in
Tombstone leading up to the famous shootout.  This is the entire focus
of "Tombstone" but occupies only the last hour of the three hour "Wyatt
Earp".  "Tombstone" is more "interesting" and "exciting" but very
superficial.  The "bad guys" are simply bad because there has to be bad
guys.  There is also a klutzy analogy to modern inner city gangs that
robs the "Tombstone" villians of their only shreds of credibility. 
"Wyatt Earp" does a much better job of portraying and clarifying the
issues that drove Earps and Holliday to shoot it out with the Clantons
and the McClaurys.  The personalities involved are less colorful but the
are more believable.  How true they are to history is another question,
but clearly "Wyatt Earp" gets closer to the truth than "Tombstone" ever
does.</P>
<P>The shootout itself is similar in both films, but "Tombstone" goes over
the top, turning it into a scene that owes more to "Lethal Weapon" than
"My Darling Clementine".  It doesn't help that during sequence where the
Earps and Holliday walk side-by-side to the OK Corral, they pass by a
totally unexplained house fire.  Was this set by the Clantons?  Or was
it just to give the director a dramatic backdrop against which to shoot
the characters?</P>
<P>It may sound like a prefer "Wyatt Earp" to "Tombstone" despite the fact
that I said that "Tombstone" was more successful.  The deal is, in areas
where the two films overlap, "Wyatt Earp" is the superior film; better
written, better acted and more authentic.  The problem is that this film
also covers areas of Earp's life that Tombstone does not touch.  Much of
this, especially early in Earp's life, is just not interesting.  Costner
seems to have become the king of three hour movies that should be
shorter.  Although editing would probably not have rescued "Waterworld"
or "The Postman" it would have lessened the pain.</P>
<P>It would have helped "Wyatt Earp" a great deal, however,.  If they had
left out most of the stuff before Earp meets the Mastersons, this film
would have been much more successful.  There is little before that point
that is not adequately explained later on.  </P>
<P>"Tombstone" is more successful only because it aims lower than "Wyatt
Earp."  The Costner film plays for bigger stakes, and thus fails more
spectacularly than the Kurt Russell version could ever hope for.</P>
