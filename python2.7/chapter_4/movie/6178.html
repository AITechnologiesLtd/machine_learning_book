<P>     For motion pictures that feature gender changes or cross dressing, 
the chief pleasure is usually watching an actor or actress trying to 
play someone of the opposite sex.  This is true whether it's Tony Curtis 
and Jack Lemmon in SOME LIKE IT HOT, Dustin Hoffman in TOOTSIE, Robin 
Williams in MRS. DOUBTFIRE, or Nathan Lane in THE BIRDCAGE.  And it's 
there that THE ASSOCIATE disappoints, because, despite all the hype 
about Whoopi Goldberg playing a caucasian male, this heavily made-up, 
masculine alter-ego is given less than ten minutes of total screen time, 
with the first appearance not occurring until the film is two-thirds 
over.  </P>
<P>      The notable absence of Goldberg's Robert Cutty would have been 
forgivable had the rest of the movie been on a higher level than the one 
achieved by this trite, familiar presentation.  Unfortunately, the 
banality of the material, coupled with the almost complete absence of 
worthwhile humor, makes THE ASSOCIATE seem like a half-hearted rip-off 
of TOOTSIE where the big moment of revelation takes far, far too long to 
occur.  </P>
<P>     THE ASSOCIATE comes complete with a message that's unlikely to 
surprise anyone:  racism and sexism are prevalent in the business world, 
and, no matter how talented a person may be, unless they're a white 
male, they are unlikely to receive a fair shake.  Or, as one of the 
characters succinctly puts it, "The women's movement didn't make it down 
to Wall Street."  And, while the film gets in a few pointed jabs at the 
"old boys' network" that does most of the high financial wheeling and 
dealing, Nick Thiel's script is content with a facile resolution that 
betrays the film's central theme.  Suddenly, everyone previously 
reluctant is thrilled to be represented by a black woman.</P>
<P>     Whoopi Goldberg plays Laurel Ayres, a financial analyst whose 
promotion at Manchester Investments is usurped by her unscrupulous 
partner, Frank Peterson (Tim Daly).  When she realizes that her sex and 
race make her future prospects bleak, Laurel quits, intent upon starting 
her own firm.  After putting up an apartment building as collateral for 
a bank loan, she opens Laurel Ayres Investments, but finds it impossible 
to lure clients away from Manchester.  Then, a former co-worker, Sally 
Dugan (Dianne Wiest), puts her in touch with a big business tycoon, 
Donald Fallon (Eli Wallach), who's willing to read one of her proposals.  
When Fallon finds out that Laurel is a woman, however, he balks, until 
she reassures him that she has a male partner.  The imaginary man's 
name:  Robert Cutty.</P>
<P>     Soon, Cutty is the talk of Wall Street, as "his" brilliant moves 
make Laurel's clients happy -- not to mention rich -- people.  Of 
course, since there isn't really a Cutty, Laurel has to keep putting 
people off when they want to meet him in the flesh.  One of the most 
difficult to dissuade is the seductive Camille (Bebe Neuwirth), a woman 
given to wearing sexy negligee under her business suit.  And, when the 
SEC takes an interest in Laurel's partner, she is forced to take drastic 
action, and, via a top-notch makeup job (that actually looks rather 
cheesy), transform herself into the mysterious Cutty.</P>
<P>     On the acting side, Goldberg is Goldberg, albeit oddly restrained, 
as if director Donald Petrie didn't want her to be especially funny.  
Dianne Wiest is charming, but this is far from her best recent 
performance.  Eli Wallach and Bebe Neuwirth are both fun despite being 
stuck playing stereotypes, and Lainie Kazan has THE ASSOCIATE's plum 
role -- a tabloid gossip columnist.  Unfortunately, Tim Daly is horribly 
miscast as the duplicitous Frank.  Daly's boring performance conveys as 
much menace as a slice of white bread.</P>
<P>     THE ASSOCIATE can boast exactly two funny moments -- a smooch that 
provokes over-the-top homophobic reactions and a literal example of 
bathroom humor.  The lack of laughter is damaging, because this material 
isn't sufficiently plausible or entertaining to hold an audience's 
interest without the particular brand of outrageous comedy that Goldberg 
is known for.  THE ASSOCIATE works fine as a bland, feel-good, big 
screen sit com, but there's nothing here to get excited about.  This is 
mediocre filler in a fall release schedule that is otherwise full of 
promise.</P>
