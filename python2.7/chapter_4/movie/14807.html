<P>This film is like U-TURN (8/10) without the big name cast, like RED
ROCK WEST (8/10) without the John Dahl touch of noir, and like BLOOD
SIMPLE (8/10) without the Coen brothers' overly stylish caress.
Director David Dobkin tackles this black comedy about a mysterious
small town killer in his feature film debut.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Small town America is the setting. Joaquin Phoenix is the innocent
young man who gets raveled in a tale of two suspicious deaths in his
town. He finds both dead bodies, and suddenly develops an instant
following within the FBI. Lester Long is the stranger in town who
befriends Joaquin, and oozes enigmatic. Dead bodies, twists, turns and
bitingly dark comedy ensues.   </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Quirky little small town murder mystery film, generates enough style,
plot and original characters to stand out among the umpteen other
movies that blazed its trail before it. This film also has an eclectic
little soundtrack, with several well-chosen Elvis tunes blaring during
some of the most gratifying scenes, but lacks the absolute
believability in its so-so ending. Some people may have a bigger
problem with its conclusion, but I bought it for the most part, because
of the way that the characters had been built up during the entire
film.</P>
<P>Vince Vaughn pulls off another dynamic performance as Lester the
self-proclaimed "molester", and spices his character up with one of the
honkiest laughs this side of Fran Dresher. Joaquin Phoenix also
delivers a solid performance as the naïve country bumpkin caught in a
situation highly beyond his limited resourcefulness, and the female
vixen in this tale, actress Mary Lou, pulls off a great femme fatale
whose only reasons for living seem drenched in sex, cigarettes and
booze (did I mention sex?). Speaking of cigarettes, I don't think there
is one character in this film that doesn't smoke (except the clueless
deputy Barney, of course), but then again, I guess that's to be
expected from this genre.</P>
<P>The movie also starts off with a really cool tete-a-tete scene and ends
with a unique, unbelievable to some, but mostly Hollywoodian
conclusion. Overall, I thought the movie worked on most fronts,
delivering the ripped off stylish flair from various Coen and Oliver
Stone based films (But who doesn't rip off the greats anyway), great
performances by all of the main actors and their offspring, an
interesting plot involving murders galore, plenty of sexcapades, goofy
country folk, and a bizarre yet effective soundtrack to blend it all
together. If you liked any of the three films that I mentioned in my
introduction, you will most probably enjoy this fable as well,
especially if you dig any of the lead actors. Either way, a
nacho-chompin' treat indeed!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Scott Free is the production company that produced this film. It is
operated by the Scott brothers, better known as directors Ridley Scott
and Tony Scott. An obvious wink to themselves in this film, comes by
the way of a scene where actress Janeane Garofalo is watching a movie
in her hotel room, while enjoying some pot and pizza. The film is ALIEN
(8/10)- directed by said Ridley Scott, and next to the television set
lie two other video tapes entitled: TRUE ROMANCE (9/10)- directed by
brother Tony Scott, and SWINGERS (8.5/10)- the classic Vince Vaughn
film that launched his career back in 1996. Nice touch, guys!
Director Dobkin acknowledged the influence of the Coen brothers' BLOOD
SIMPLE film, but also claimed that he was equally moved by the
adaptation of Truman Capote's IN COLD BLOOD. Dobkin, a native of
Washington D.C., comes from a commercials and rock-music video
background. He's directed videos for Elton John, John Lee Hooker,
Coolio and Tupac Shakur.
Janeane Garofalo originally passed on this script because she thought
there was a misogynist tone to it, but eventually folded, and loved
shooting the flick in wonderfully shot Utah. That's where she found her
dog, Dew. She prepped for her role by watching "a lot of cop TV" and
visiting a shooting range. 
This film was previously titled IN TOO DEEP.</P>
