<PRE>WILD MAN BLUES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Welcome to the lives of the rich and famous.  Today, thanks to
Barbara Kopple's new documentary called WILD MAN BLUES, we visit with
Woody Allen, his lover, his sister, and his jazz band as they tour
Europe in style befitting royalty.  (The band members' unseen
accommodations are undoubtedly less patrician.)</P>
<P>     Kopple had a real challenge in constructing an interesting film
since Woody turns out to be as dull as his movies are exciting.  He
suffers from self-proclaimed "chronic dissatisfaction," which means,
for example, that when he's in New York he wishes he were in Europe and
vice versa.  A hypochondriac, he keeps taking his temperature in the
hopes that it will stop reading normal.</P>
<P>     Woody and his soon-to-be wife - "This is Soon-Yi Previn, the
notorious Soon-Yi Previn," is how he introduces her - make an odd
couple.  She treats him like her pupil, lecturing him on the how to
perform on stage and how to greet dignitaries.  And the supposedly
oversexed Woody acts like they are an old married couple, showing her
little visible affection for her except for a little handholding.</P>
<P>     A typical scene has them in one of their palatial hotel rooms - he
prefers getting 2 large adjoining suites so he can have his own bath -
making small talk at breakfast about subjects from the temperature of
the shower to the lack of toast.  It reminded me of a two-person junior
high school skit I was in, in which I was supposed to be playing "a
member of the elite society," whatever that meant.</P>
<P>     The most striking conclusion from viewing the movie is how
incredibly unhappy Woody is even with millions of fans and dollars.  In
one hotel there are a thousand people in the street below his room,
hoping to get a glimpse of him.  Even when playing the New Orleans
style jazz that he reportedly loves, he looks miserable.  Grimacing
with his eyes closed, he produces music that can be described as, well,
pleasant, but he makes it look less like a labor of love than something
to be endured.</P>
<P>     Woody, although he clearly mugs for the camera at times, seems
fairly natural.  Looking disheveled and rapidly aging, he and his
relatives travel from their private jet to their limo to their next
unbelievable room.  One even has its own large, indoor swimming pool
with elaborate tiled mosaic floors that looks like it was last seen in
an episode of "I, Claudius."</P>
<P>     With enormous doses of Woody's music, the film spends little time
analyzing what attracts Woody to it.  "There's nothing there between
you and the pure feeling of playing," Woody says, giving us some hint
of his motivation.  "There's no cerebral part to it."</P>
<P>     In one of the film's little insights, Woody talks about why
Europeans like his movies better than Americans.  Europeans even love
his films, such as INTERIORS, that bombed in the US.  "The Europeans
like pictures that drone on, and I'm good at making pictures that drone
on," he explains.</P>
<P>     What may surprise Woody's fans is that he is rarely funny in
person and sometimes surprisingly inarticulate.  ("I'm appropriately
animate for a human being in the context in which I exist," is his
retort to Soon-Yi's criticism of his lack of gestures on stage.)</P>
<P>     "He's great," effuses one of his adoring fans.  "He can do
whatever he likes to do."  Actually, the film serves as proof that he
doesn't enjoy anything.</P>
<P>     "You are so happy to be so intelligent," one party guest, whose
native tongue isn't English, tells Woody.  "With intelligence comes
great responsibility," he replies gravely.  You'll never catch him
being happy.</P>
<P>     The sad movie ends in what Woody calls a "lunch from hell" with
his octogenarian parents.  He sets them up and then hates them when
they respond to his taunts exactly as would be predicted.  Perhaps the
metaphor for how he views his life - quite apart from its reality - is
the hall where they were to perform in Venice.  It was completely
destroyed by a fire just before they arrived.</P>
<P>     WILD MAN BLUES runs 1:45.  It is rated PG for a single use of the
F-word and would be fine for kids around twelve and up.</P>
