<P>1935's "The Bride of Frankenstein" remains one of the great horror films of all
time. It is cheerful, dark, mysterious, comical, compelling and quite
frightening at times. It is the sequel to 1931's "Frankenstein," which starred
Boris Karloff, and is significantly superior in every aspect. </P>
<P>The opening prologue is set in 1816 with Elsa Lanchester as the lovely author
of the "Frankenstein" novel, Mary Shelley, who tells her close admirers, Percy
Shelley, her husband, and Lord Byron, "London's greatest sinner," how her story
didn't really end. Thus, we get the sequel with the Monster (Karloff again)
escaping from the burning windmill and wrecking vengeance on everything and
everyone who crosses his path. He attacks village women, gypsies, peasants and
so on. He encounters a blind old man in one of the most famous sequences in
history as the old man teaches him the virtues of fire, smoking, music ("Ave
Maria"), and how to speak. Of course, two men (one of them is played by John
Carradine) find the Monster and try to kill him. The Monster escapes again and
is caught by all the villagers, tied to a pole in crucifixion-style, and
eventually chained in prison before escaping yet again. </P>
<P>Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) managed to survive the fiery debacle of the
original, and is all set to marry his sweet Elizabeth (Valerie Hobson who was
only 17 at the time) before being convinced to create a mate for the Monster by
the evil Dr. Praetorius (Ernest Thesiger). Naturally, they create a mate with
the help of a drooling assistant, Karl (Dwight Frye in reportedly a combination
of two roles) who memorably shrieks "It's a very fresh one," after killing a
bystander on the street to get a fresh heart. The Monster finally has a new
mate (Elsa Lanchester) who memorably shrieks herself and turns her head in
jerky, robotic movements recalling Brigitte Helm in Metropolis. The film ends
with the fiery explosion of Praetorius's castle, and the good doctor and
Elizabeth manage to escape and embrace in a happy ending devised to let the
good doctor live. </P>
<P>"The Bride of Frankenstein" has some oddball moments although I can't say I
know what era the film is set in. At one point, Dr. Praetorius lets
Frankenstein communicate with Elizabeth through a voice transmission device!
However, the villagers and every other citizen travel by horse and carriage, so
is it set before the 1900's? And there's an abrupt finale where simply pulling
a lever causes an explosion (this is how most mad scientist movies would end). </P>
<P>Still, "The Bride of Frankenstein" is a great film with some horrifying
moments and some weirdly funny ones such as Dr. Praetorius's own creations
which are life-like dolls in glass containers, including a smitten king, a
ballerina, and a mermaid. "This is not science. This is black magic," says the
dumbfounded Frankenstein. The scene is darkly comic yet there's something
fundamentally horrific about it too - it shows a man who has gone at extreme
lengths to give life to dead beings for his own pleasure, like Frankenstein
himself. There are also several religious symbols throughout, especially during
a quixotic moment when a crucifix shines brightly in the background while the
blind man weeps after finding a companion in his home again. The entrance of
the Bride towards the end is one of the loveliest sights in history as we see a
ravishing beauty given life to please a monster whom she despises. </P>
<P>The performances are top-notch. Colin Clive is credibly and constantly uptight
- he gets to yell the immortal line "She's alive! She's alive!" Ernest Thesiger
plays the most evil villain in eons, and is unmatched in its baneful nature
until Henry Fonda's cold killer in Once Upon a Time in the West. Thesiger has
some delicious quips throughout and appears to be more frightening than the
Monster itself. Karloff is given more to do this time as he's allowed to speak
threateningly to Frankenstein, and even laugh! Elsa Lanchester is grandly
beautiful and tremendously adept playing two roles: first as a delightful Mary
Shelley in the wonderful prologue, and then in an extended cameo as the shrilly
Bride with Nefertiti-shock hair and piercing eyes (if only screenwriters John
L. Balderston and William Hurlbut gave her more to do). Also noteworthy is Una
O'Connor who is hilarious as Frankenstein's maid servant, Minnie, who screams
every time she sees the Monster - I love the way she utters "Dr.
Praaeeetttorius!" when the doctor enters the house. Her role is quite similar
to her equally delectable parts in "The Invisible Man" and "The Adventures of
Robin Hood." Another small but significant role is the pompous burgomaster
played by E.E. Clive with a big mustache - he was also cast in "The Invisible
Man." </P>
<P>Other pluses in "Bride of Frankenstein" are the moody, evocative
cinematography by John Mescall, including the justly famous graveyard scenes
populated by fog and crucifixes; the creepy music score by Frank Waxman that is
among the greatest ever composed for the silver screen and was used in many
films since; and James Whale's fine direction and his extraordinary feel for
the supernatural and the monstrous ironies in Shelley's text. There is simply
not a better film about Frankenstein to see and, although it doesn't follow the
novel too closely, this is among the finest and most visually spectacular
Universal horror films ever made. </P>
