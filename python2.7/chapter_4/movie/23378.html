<P>Director John Frankenheimer was once a big name in films as well as TV.
Among his 1960s  pictures were Birdman of Alcatraz; the political, 
paranoid cult-thriller The Manchurian Candidate; the political 
conspiracy thriller Seven Days in May; the WWII Resistance adventure 
The Train; the affecting melodrama of skydivers, The Gypsy Moths; the 
touching The Fixer; the haunting, chilling, humanistic sci-fi 
Seconds,  the best film ever starring Rock Hudson.</P>
<P>By the 1970s Frankenheimer had crested but still made some gems: The 
Iceman Cometh; the sequel French Connection II -- which my minority 
opinion rates above the original French Connection;  Black Sunday, a 
suspenseful, intelligent entry in the terrorist sub-genre. Then came 
a decidedly mixed bag, although when Frankenheimer returned to 
television in the 90s, he did very well with TV features 
(Andersonville, The Burning Season, George Wallace). On the big 
screen he stumbled in 1996 with the ludicrous yet campy The Island of 
Dr. Moreau., followed by the disappointing Ronin  (1998).</P>
<P>Now comes the sad news that Reindeer Games is a genuine flop. It was 
supposed to be released during you guessed it, the Christmas 1999 
season, presumably as
an action "film noir" that might stand out among the sugary 
end-of-year items. But they postponed it.</P>
<P>It's a heist movie of sorts.  Cell mates Nick (Farina) and Rudy (as 
in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, ha-ha) played by Ben Affleck, are 
inmates of Michigan's Iron Mounatin Prison. (In fact the movie was 
shot in Canada). At Christmastime, those two about to be released, 
which is not as bad as releasing this film.</P>
<P>At the last minute, there is a nicely shot  food riot caused by 
cockroaches being served to the prisoners.  Nick gets stabbed, to 
death, we assume. Outside the prison Rudy meets Ashley, Nick's the 
pretty pen-pal  who did not know what Nick looked like. Rudy says 
"I'm Nick" and before you can say Jack Robinson or Jack Frost, the 
two are making passionate love. To maintain his deception Rudy even 
flushes down the toilet his Michigan driver's license. (But was it 
valid after five years in the slammer?-- Rudy by the way had been 
imprisoned for car theft).</P>
<P>The Love Games are savagely  interrupted by a gang  of  low-life, low 
I.Q. types led by truck  driver Gabriel,  said to be Ashley's 
brother. They think that the new Nick is the real Nick. He denies it. 
They beat him up mercilessly. Again and again. They don't believe 
him. The violence level is high. It turns out that Nick (the real 
McCoy) had sent Ashley (don't ask) a hand-drawn map of the American 
Indian  Tomahawk Casino, where Nick had worked. The gang plans to 
"take it down."</P>
<P>Skipping the skippable, which is most of the movie, under major 
duress Rudy admits he is Nick, claims that the casino has been 
remodeled while he was in prison. Ordered to case it  incognito, 
Rudy-Nick goes there as a ridiculous cowboy.</P>
<P>Enough, enough. Miscast Ben Affleck, who looks like a nice boy from 
the 'burbs, foils and re-foils the villains, gets re-beaten, gets 
chained to a bed, etc. His face which should have been a pulp, 
magically recovers from scene to scene. He knows, near-magically, how 
to undo his lock. And so on.</P>
<P>Gabriel is an almost comically brutish, savage guy. The dialogue is 
for the birds, which is an insult to our flying friends. Performances 
are pathetically bad. The casino heist is done by the gang members 
all dressed up as Santa Clauses. Bur as the Marx Bros, would say, 
there is no Sanity Clause at any time, be it so tiny, in the picture.</P>
<P>I'll say zero about the plot's twists, turns, re-twists and re-turns. 
It is beyond the unbelievable. If you keep watching it is to see how 
far ludicrousness can go. The movie was written  by  Ehren Kruger 
whose scripts for Arlington Road and Scream 3 call for a five-year 
sentence in Iron Mountain Prison.</P>
<P>Through the stupidity of it all you might just  sense that 
Frankenheimer still knows how to direct, to be like an orchestra 
conductor who keeps things going. But the score is much too dismal 
here. Perhaps he will take a gun to Kruger after he reads the reviews.</P>
<P>A major character is a humongous 18-wheeler. The movie is like that 
vehicle. It has 18 wheels, but no two of them run at the same time.</P>
<P>"Le mauvais gout mene au crime"(Stendhal)</P>
