THE RAINMAKER
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1997 by Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        THE RAINMAKER carries on the tradition of transforming 
John Grisham novels into big screen blockbusters. This one, though, 
leans less toward the early Grisham action thrillers like THE FIRM 
and THE PELICAN BRIEF and more toward the courtroom drama 
of A TIME TO KILL and THE CHAMBER. It's about a young, white-
bread lawyer who overcomes the odds and scores a victory for the 
less fortunate, and it's preachy as hell. However, with director 
Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of a large, likeable cast, THE 
RAINMAKER refuses to sink under the weight and predictability of 
the storyline.</P>
<P>        Matt Damon is the hero this time around, just out of law 
school and cramming for the bar exam. He takes a job with a shyster 
(Mickey Rourke) who sets his lawyers up on a commission basis and 
sends them out to chase ambulances. Damon learns the ropes from 
an older, wiser, unlicensed associate (Danny DeVito) and gets his 
first clients, an old lady changing her will (Teresa Wright) and a 
not-as-old lady (Mary Kay Place) whose son is dying of leukemia.</P>
<P>        Just as Rourke gets nailed by the FBI and Damon passes the 
bar, he and DeVito partner up to form their own unholy alliance. 
Claire Danes comes along at about the same time, as a young 
woman whose husband put her in the hospital. Hers is the 
predictable subplot that will haunt the movie until the end, as 
Damon falls in love with her, she leaves him and they decide to go 
back and get her stuff. I assume this sidebar was trimmed greatly 
from the novel, but in the Cliffs Notes version THE RAINMAKER 
movie affords us, we see enough to know this is the same old Wife-
Beater Gets His plotline with no new twists.</P>
<P>        It's the Corporate America Gets Theirs plotline that most of 
THE RAINMAKER is concerned with. The leukemia kid bites the 
dust and the family sues the insurance company for wrongful death. 
The company denied their claim eight times, so he missed his 
treatment. There are plenty of courtroom scenes, much less 
sophisticated than we're used to, where young Damon has to orient 
himself to court procedures and fight off the high-paid insurance 
company attorney team (led by a sneering Jon Voight). It's never in 
doubt what the eventual outcome will be and which surprise witness 
will bring it.</P>
<P>        As I've maintained these last four paragraphs, the plot is 
weak, and the constant sermonizing against both the legal 
profession and the e-e-e-evil insurance companies only makes the 
movie less appealing, but thankfully, the actors trapped in this story 
bring their own charm. There's a lot more humor than you might 
expect, particularly from DeVito and the two judges in the case 
(Dean Stockwell and Danny Glover), so the movie is worth 
watching, but on the whole, it's a low-rent A TIME TO KILL.</P>
