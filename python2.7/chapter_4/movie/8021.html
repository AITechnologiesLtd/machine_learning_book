<PRE>                                VOLCANO
                       A film review by Tim Voon
                        Copyright 1997 Tim Voon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Don Cheadle, John Corbett, Keith
David, Gaby Hoffmann, Jacqui Kim, John Carroll Lynch Director: Mick
Jackson Producers: Neal Moritz and Andrew Davis Screenplay: Jerome
Armstrong and Billy Ray</P>
<P>It's not a 'volcano' as we know it. More the beginnings of one leaking
lava into L.A.</P>
<P>The movie jumps straight into lava erupting into the city. This is a big
mistake because it leaves no room for the rest of the movie to move to a
higher level of tension. What you see at the beginning is the same thing
you see at the end. Too much lava and burned bodies.</P>
<P>The human rescue scenes are also clumsily contrived. With the victims
positioning themselves near lava pools and collapsing buildings,
waiting, no asking for disaster to hit them. Then pathetically needing
to be rescued. The hero's daughter annoyed me the most as she just
stands and screams when she sees lava moving towards her. Disappointing,
when all the other little heroines of 1997 are kicking velociraptors and
helping to save ships.</P>
<P>There is nothing to rejoice about. The day may be saved, but the battle
has only just begun. A volcano has been woken, so pack your bags and
leave L.A.</P>
<P>Comment: A special effect junky's food fest, which is about the same
level as burning shoe soles - ouch!</P>
