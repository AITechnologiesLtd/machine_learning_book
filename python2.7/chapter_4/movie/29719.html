<PRE>SERENDIPITY
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>I must admit I'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new
romantic comedy Serendipity, because that also defines how I met my
current girlfriend.  The magic and mystery of our fated encounter is
also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very
romantic Serendipity.  I am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre,
but something drew me to this film.  Maybe it was the casting of the
underrated Jeremy Piven in a supporting role, and the hilarious Eugene
Levy.  Maybe it was my hope that John Cusack would get the redemption he
justly deserves after such crap as High Fidelity, Con Air, and Pushing
Tin.  But maybe it was because I feel as giddy as a school kid right now
with this whole romantic thing currently in my life.</P>
<P>The story of Serendipity is simple.  Two people, John Trager (John
Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale, looking ever so hot), have a
chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with Buck Henry smack dab in
the middle.  Charmed beyond repair, these two knuckleheads grab a sundae
together at a café called Serendipity, talk about that irresponsible
thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down, and spend a few
hours at the local ice skating rink.  But with each of them already
involved with other parties, Sara has John write his name and number on
a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of Love in the
Time of Cholera.  Sara declares that if this "thing" -- let's just call
it love -- is destined to happen, fate will bring them together in the
future.</P>
<P>Years later and on opposite coasts of America, John and Sara -- both
engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates --
decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts.  What happens then
is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates -
involving such items as mistaken identity, a Graduate homage, John
Corbett as a freaky New Age musician, and Eugene Levy as an irate and
crazed salesman -- to find out if that "thing" was right after all.</P>
<P>Fortunately, first-time screenwriter Marc Klein has sketched strong,
well-rounded, characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative. 
Coupled with deft directing by Michael Chelsom (director of the very
unfunny Town and Country and the very funny Funny Bones) and the use of
time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film
comes off with genuine believability and sincerity.  Both Piven and
Molly Shannon make nice sidekick characters</P>
<P>On the flipside, films such as You've Got Mail, Made in Heaven, and even
High Fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at
hand.  But it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind
in the romantic wake after John and Sara find happiness this is the most
unsettling part of the picture.</P>
