<P>Arlington Road is a relieving summer film, as we get away from special effects
extravaganzas, into a spellbinding film marvelously crafted by director Mark
Pellington and first time screenwriter, Ehren Kruger.  Arlington Road's clever
script features many horrifying, tense sequences in which the viewer is brought
into the film, and in result, fear their own neighbors, friends, and possibly
even family.  Ehren Kruger takes a chance with his non Hollywood script, which
includes a depressing ending that is impossible to see coming.   </P>
<P>Arlington Road's concept deals with Washington State University terrorism
professor, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges), who suffered the loss of his F.B.I.
agent wife in a shootout, and lives with son Grant (Spencer Treat Clark) and
occasionally girlfriend Brooke (Hope Davis) on the quiet, peaceful street that
is Arlington Road.  In Arlington Road's well-photographed opening sequence,
Michael Faraday saves the young Brady Lang, whom he finds in the middle of the
street wounded terribly.  After rescuing Brady, Michael is introduced to his
parents, who live just across the street, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl (Joan
Cusack) Lang.  The pleasant neighbors have kept to themselves for their time
living there, but quickly become friends with Michael and Brooke.  Clues lead
up to Michael believing his Brady Bunch type neighbors are actually terrorists,
and learns that Oliver has a terrorist past, and is ready to strike again.</P>
<P>The screenplay feeds Jeff Bridges an array of conflict to handle, as Faraday
constantly conflicts between his deceased wife and girlfriend Brooke, his
neighbors who are turning his life into a 24-hour scare, and must decipher what
is happening in his life, whether his terrorism college course is getting to
his head, whether to look past his wife, and look at Brooke, and how to handle
the situation across the street.  Jeff Bridges handles all tasks well in deed,
as he exhibits a performance which is both applaudable and unwatchable, as his
facial expressions are so tense, they become hideous.  Bridges rehearses every
line and every move with a certain amount of tenseness, which helps create the
well-written character's fear of Oliver and Cheryl, as he is the only one who
knows that he has stumbled upon something big. </P>
<P>Hope Davis gives a shockingly down to earth performance, and fits her
character's shoes well, as she must deal with her paranoid boyfriend, while all
she wants to do is lead a happy life.  Hints of Brooke giving in to Michael's
beliefs come frequently, but the apparent gut feeling never comes out of her,
until she discovers the truth for herself.  </P>
<P>Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins are particularly eerie as the picture perfect
neighbors, which turn out to be not so perfect in the end.  Cusack gets to show
off the darker side of her acting skills as a character that is common in
everyone's everyday lives, therefore the scariness of her character seems
realistic, and will you make you question your own neighbors.  Cusack is
horrifying as Cheryl Lang, as every smile, every move, and every word from her
are chilling, as she seems to be Miss Goody-Goody to everyone, but the viewers
know the devastating truth.   Tim Robbins isn't given much to do as the main
antagonist, but does what he can, delivering an utterly horrifying performance.
 Oliver's past isn't developed well, and is explained by Oliver to Michael in a
frightening scene, where Oliver reveals his motives.  Oliver's motive just adds
to the tension between himself and Michael, and doesn't seem out of place, as 
many horror films have demonstrated motive sequences which seem strange, as the
killers have a perfect chance to dispose of their victim, but go on about their
past, as the victim slowly devises a plan to defend themselves.  Arlington
Road's motive sequence is something realistic, that a person would actually do,
to darken the protagonist's world more than they already have. </P>
<P>Ehren Kruger's screenplay stays true to the key plot of the film, but also
contains an abundance of subplots, which all contribute to the overall
greatness of the film.  Each character is a three dimensional, realistic person
with distinctive thoughts and personalities, that aren't your regular movie
characters, which usually don't act like people do, as in last spring's Analyze
This, where the characters were anything but human.</P>
<P>Even now, days after viewing this film, I feel fear deep within, as I glance
over my shoulder every few seconds, just for that extra ounce of security that
I lost while viewing Arlington Road. The screenplay does what I like best, save
the good part for last, as the entire ending 45 minutes are particularly
unsettling, as Michael's suspicions become reality, and the film gets down to
the real nitty-gritty.  The disturbing score, the edgy script, the terrific
ensemble cast, and original directing all contribute to make this wonderful
presentation of pure, raw terror.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Arlington Road was supposed to hit theaters in May, but due to
the tragic Columbine High School shootings, the film was delayed. The tagline
for last spring's film Never Been Kissed best sums up my thoughts with the
line-- "Some things are worth waiting for."</P>
