The Big Hit (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>"The Big Hit" didn't live up to its name at the box office, but it should have.
 It's a delightful surprise that left me chuckling even after it was over.</P>
<P>First-time screenwriter Ben Ramsey blends two genres that seem worlds apart to
create, essentially, "Pulp Fiction Meets Ferris Bueller."  You'll find the
twisted, violent humor of Quentin Tarantino's world merged with a
I've-got-to-fix-all-this-before-my-parents-get-home farce, and the disparate
styles blend better than you might imagine.  Of course, this hybrid genre is
not without precedent; 1997's "Grosse Pointe Blank" had some of the same
elements in its story of a hitman going to his high school reunion.  However,
"The Big Hit" has a different feel; it tosses out any sense of realism in favor
of style and fun.</P>
<P>"Marky" Mark Wahlberg, fresh from his comeback in "Boogie Nights," is hitman
Melvin Smiley.  He and some of his hitman buddies come up with a scheme to
kidnap the daughter of a wealthy Japanese businessman.  What they don't know is
that (a) the businessman is broke (he blew all his money making a movie called
"Taste the Golden Spray") and (b) the kidnapee (played by newcomer China Chow)
is the goddaughter of their godfather (Avery Brooks).  When he finds out that
his goddaughter has been kidnapped, the mob boss orders Melvin's partner/rival
Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips) to hunt down those responsible.  So Cisco has to
kill Melvin before the boss finds out about his own involvement in the
kidnapping.</P>
<P>While all this is going on, Melvin is entertaining the parents (Lainie Kazan
and Elliott Gould) of his fiancee Pam (Christina Applegate).  While Melvin is
making nice with his future in-laws, his angry girlfriend (Lela Rochon) - yes,
he has a fiancee and a girlfriend - deposits the kidnapped girl and two bags of
body parts from a previous hit on Melvin's lawn.  He rushes around frantically
to keep Pam and her folks from finding out what he's been up to.</P>
<P>The whole thing gets really goofy at the end, but the spirit of fun that
pervades the movie prepares you for the silliness.</P>
<P>"The Big Hit" is the first American film by Hong Kong action director Kirk
Wong, and it also has the input of action sensei John Woo, who served as
executive producer.  Wong gives us a big stylized action sequence as Melvin,
Cisco, and friends put their lethal skills to work rubbing out a rival mobster.</P>
<P>The other two kidnappers are played by Bokeem Woodbine, whose character is
developing masturbation as an alternative lifestyle, and Robin Dunne, who plays
the stammering dunce of the group.  Kidnapee Chow is smart and funny; her
character, Keiko, refuses to be intimidated by her captors and begins to hit it
off with Melvin, who neurotically insists that everyone has to like him (and,
yes, someone does point out he's in an odd profession for a guy who wants to be
liked by everyone).  There's also a amusing subplot tossed in with a geeky
video store clerk (Danny Smith) who harasses Melvin to return an overdue copy
of "King Kong Lives."</P>
<P>"The Big Hit" may not be for everyone (some weirdoes don't even find murder and
kidnapping funny).  But I loved it when I saw it last summer, and I've enjoyed
watching it twice more since.  Give it a try if you haven't already.</P>
