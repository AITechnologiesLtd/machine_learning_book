CASUAL RELATIONS (director: Mark Rappaport; writer: Mark Rappaport;
cinematographer: Mark Rappaport/Alan Raymond; cast: Mel Austin, Sis
Smith, Paula Barra, Peter Campus, 1973)</P>
<P>Rappaport's debut film is a black comedy that has all the eccentricity
exhibited in his later films, but without the polish he was able to
develop for his more accomplished works. That this film is an adequate
entry into his oeuvre of independent films, is certainly true. As
always, a Rappaport film is marked by the absurd way its characters are
presented and by its low budget.</P>
<P>Homage is paid here to such classic movies as Sunset Boulevard and
Johnny Guitar, as these are viewed on TV by the neurotics featured in
the film, whose lives seem more unreal than what they are watching on
screen.</P>
<P>The theme that runs through all the vignettes, is that all the
characters featured are rife with fantasies, suffering from isolation to
their surroundings and the inability to communicate with someone else.
There were at least eight other little episodic dramas, other than the
one just referred to- of the lady who wakes up in the morning, whose
only aim in life is to watch films on TV for the whole day.</P>
<P>In one episode, a woman hallucinates that the figure of a hand she sees
on the wall is real. A separated couple divorced because of
communication problems dine out in the Eatwell Restaurant and go for a
drive afterwards without conversing, until she puts on the radio and he
tells her he can't concentrate on his driving with the radio on. A woman
is molested by a man with a knife, who can't take no for an answer after
he kisses her. But the scene is played back ala Rashomon, giving the
man's version which is different from hers. A gay man loves to watch
newsreels of catastrophes, and meets another gay man in the theater to
share his experience. A guy looks at the same photograph in a gallery
every day and says that he feels the photograph is looking back at him.
A woman tosses in her bed with beads of perspiration on her, as she
can't sleep because of a bad dream. A guy on a bad acid trip, says he
doesn't want to die, that he'll never take acid again if he doesn't die.
While typing at work, a secretary remembers a dream she had the night
before with men in it, but the men in that dream, to her dismay, never
touch her.</P>
<P>All these episodes feed into the off-the-wall fun the narrator has in
describing the action taking place, which he narrates in a mock serious
tone. The way the lives of these lonely New York City denizens are
presented, make for an original film, though not a complete one, but one
that is worth seeing for those who don't mind seeing something a bit
different.</P>
