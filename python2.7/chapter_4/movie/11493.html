<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        I've never been a huge fan of frenetic adventure films featuring soups
of various European-accented actors dressed up in flashy, cumbersome
clothes while brandishing those thin fencing-type swords with the
jewel-covered handles.  On that note, I'd say that my exposure to the
genre is rather limited:  I've seen only portions of the numerous films
about the Three Musketeers, and my knowledge of the books on which these
films are based is even more limited.  </P>
<P>        Randall Wallace's The Man in the Iron Mask, based on the famous
Alexander Dumas novel (which is part of a trilogy about the musketeers),
is a film that fits securely into the description above.  This is not a
film of profound depth or thought, and I didn't expect it to be.  But I
did want it to be significantly more than well-built sets and Leonardo
DiCaprio screaming "Wear it....until you die in it!"  And while it is
technically sound and acceptably light on intrusive continuity problems,
Wallace's film is overflowing with multitudes of characters and scenes. 
The result is a frantic movie that is entertaining, but lacking in focus
or anything to stimulate thought.  </P>
<P>        DiCaprio plays Louis XIV, the tyrannical young king who refuses to
award the peasants of France with edible food.  He's mostly interested
in bedding young women, but on occasion he pretends to care about his
country.  His personal bodyguard is D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), a
highly-feared general.  D'Artagnan was once one of the musketeers.  The
musketeers--Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich), and Porthos
(Gerard Depardieu)--are an aging bunch now, and have settled into
less-adventurous lives with the emergence of Louis XIV.  </P>
<P>        Conflicts arise when Athos' son, Raul (Peter Sarsgaard) is sent off to
war because Louis is interested in his fiancée, Christine (Judith
Godreche).  When Raul is killed, Athos declares Louis as his enemy;
therefore D'Artagnan, who was his close friend, is also his enemy.  The
remaining three musketeers develop a plan to get Louis out of the
throne.  Aramis knows of a man--whose identity and existence is unknown
to most people due to a big iron mask wrapped around his face--who can
help.  He is the twin brother of Louis, and has been jailed by the King
in fear.</P>
<P>        The film frequently feels less-than-authentic.  Take, for instance, all
of the various accents.  DiCaprio, once again, plays a period character
with a straight American accent.  Depardieu seems to be trying to hide
his French accent for some strange reason, while Byrne and Irons have
slightly lightened their British inflections; even Malkovitch, who can
usually get away with it because is voice is so unusual, can't manage to
make his lines fit in.  The film also allows an occasional anachronism
(actually, I'm guessing:  a word that rhymes with "sits" that references
a lady's bosom just doesn't sound natural in this time period).</P>
<P>        The film doesn't even tell us what it's about until about the 45-minute
mark.  Sure, there's foreshadowing with glimpses of the man in the mask,
but the Musketeers' plan almost feels like a subplot because it occurs
so late in the film.  The main characters seem to be Louis and his
counterpart, but the heroes are the musketeers, and their plan is the
one we're supposed to root for.  I suppose this explains Wallace's
attempt to characterize these men, but with the mangled focus, character
development scenes tend to intrude on the story, and usually feel
pointless.  The best example of this has Depardieu (who is not my
favorite actor) running around nude; he finds a rope and decides it's an
omen suggesting that he hang himself.  This scene does elicit laughs,
though it still feels forced and out-of-place in the film.</P>
<P>        On the whole, I'm disappointed in the performances.  Irons and
Malkovitch are passable, but not up to their capabilities.  DiCaprio is
okay, but I wish he'd try and take on an accent one of these days (he
does do a good job making us realize which of the brothers he is playing
at any given moment, though).  Depardieu takes the French machismo
element of his personality light years beyond my preference, and is
simply annoying to watch.  There are no significant women roles, which I
found irritating; Godreche is uninteresting because the character is
weak and shallow, while Anne Parillaud, who plays Louis' mother, is
given little screen time.  The best in the film is Byrne, and he is
good:  he shows charisma and energy rare to his performances.</P>
<P>        What The Man in the Iron Mask comes down to is, essentially, mindless
entertainment.  The sets are great, the costumes professional, the
scenes are paced well, and the action sequences are exciting.  For a
film that seems like it's engineered to appeal to the younger
generations, it's not a bad film.  But I think most people over the age
of twenty are going to want a little more focus and thought put into a
story that's been told so many times.  </P>
