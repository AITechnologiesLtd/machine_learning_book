<P>     THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE dares to ask the question "When approached
from the perspective of a period piece with a 'name' cast, can
flatulence be funny?"  Unfortunately for those stuck in the audience,
it also provides the answer.  For, while it's entirely possible to get
a laugh or two out of this sort of relentless scatological humor,
there's a point at which the bodily function jokes stop amusing and
start aggravating.  In THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE, this happens about thirty
minutes into the film, which is bad news because there's still an hour
and a half to go.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Alan Parker has designed this story, set in 1907
at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, as a satire on all sorts of health and
wellness issues.  Frequently, however, his more biting statements get
swamped by "toilet humor."  There's only so much about the bowels that
any audience can take - and here we get our fill, and more:  "The
bowels are born again," "The bowels are our passage to health," "Clean
thoughts make for clean bowels," and "Clean bowels make for clean
thoughts."  All that, and enemas too.</P>
<P>     The film follows two parallel, yet rarely convergent plots.  The
first involves the arrival of Will and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew
Broderick and Bridget Fonda) to the sanitarium run by Dr. John Kellogg
(Anthony Hopkins).  Neither of them is "well", and they've come for
"the cure."  Will's condition is immediately diagnosed as critical, and
he's put into the care of the young and sexy Nurse Graves (Traci
Lind).  His treatment involves frequent enemas, electro-shock baths,
and flagellation.</P>
<P>     Arriving on the same train as Will and Eleanor is a young
entrepreneur named Charles Ossining (John Cusack), who has come to
Battle Creek, the "cereal bowl of the world", to manufacture corn
flakes.  He quickly learns, however, that his partner (Michael Lerner)
is more interested in living high off the hog than getting any real
work done.</P>
<P>     Why this second, generally irrelevant subplot was included at all
in THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a question to ponder.  Not only does it
draw out an already-overlong film, but it never dovetails with the
primary storyline.  When Charles eventually shows up at the sanitarium,
we expect some sort of closure, but nothing really happens.</P>
<P>     THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE suffers from a case of reverse momentum.
The first half-hour, which is moderately entertaining, passes
relatively quickly.  After that, however, the story's progression
decelerates as tedium and inertia set in.  By the end, it's hard to
believe that you've only been in the theater for two hours.  It seems
significantly longer.</P>
<P>     The presence of Anthony Hopkins does not guarantee a good movie
(even those with short memories may recall the disastrous FREEJACK, in
which he played the villain), as is illustrated here.  With buck teeth
and wire-rimmed spectacles, Hopkins invests a fair amount of energy in
his portrayal of Dr. Kellogg, but nevertheless ends up seeming much
like that part of the anatomy that THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is
overly-enamored with.</P>
<P>     Dana Carvey and John Cusack are totally superfluous, and Matthew
Broderick and Bridget Fonda are hopelessly out-of-place (they seem like
modern-day refugees gamely trying to cope with being dropped
unexpectedly into an era ninety years in the past).  Fine actors such
as Colm Meaney and John Neville are wasted in insignificant roles.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is just too long and pointless.
It's a film without direction, and the script appears less concerned
with coherence than with how to get a cheap laugh from a body noise.
Surprisingly, considering Alan Parker's involvement in the high-voltage
THE COMMITMENTS, this picture is sadly lacking in energy.  A more apt
title might be THE ROAD TO DULLSVILLE.</P>
