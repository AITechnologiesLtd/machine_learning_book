<PRE>                                  EQUINOX
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<PRE>     Matthew Modine has great hair. </PRE>
<P>     In EQUINOX, the new film from chic director Alan Rudolph, Modine
models two different styles--a layered, flowing number in his role as
timid auto mechanic Henry Petosa and a brushed back, heavily-moussed
job as bad penny Freddy Ace.</P>
<P>     Separated at birth, Modine's twin brothers Henry and Freddy live
and work in the same fictional city, unaware of each other's
existence--and each other's hairstyle choices.</P>
<P>     But this is not your typical Hollywood production.  EQUINOX
extends the tradition of many of Rudolph's previous films (TROUBLE IN
MIND, CHOOSE ME, THE MODERNS, etc.), with highly-stylized, atmospheric
visuals; a refreshing sense of humor; and occasional excursions into
the surreal.  It successfully marries themes of identity and destiny in
a fantasy dressed as reality; it's a straight-faced fable that's also
slightly twisted.</P>
<P>     Of course, no Rudolph project would be complete without a diverse
cast of quirky, offbeat characters.</P>
<P>     Henry is a quiet, nerdy recluse who holes himself up in his poky
apartment, watching self-defense TV shows and eating junk food.  When
the local kids bully him and steal his groceries, he seems pleased to
escape with anything--even if it's only a videotape and tin of talcum
powder.  As Henry himself points out, his life seems to be taking place
without him in it.  He's afraid of the real world, afraid to speak to
his girlfriend, Beverly (Lara Flynn Boyle), with whom he's hopelessly
in love.</P>
<P>     Beverly is similarly shy, mousy, and insecure.  She reads Emily
Dickenson aloud to herself, dances with pillows, and takes occasional
slugs of cooking sherry.  It's no coincidence that she lives in an
apartment building called "The Sheltering Arms"--her character is so
fragile that anything firmer than a kiss seems likely to break her into
a thousand tiny pieces.  When Henry forces her to make a decision, she
responds uncertainly "You can't do this to me, Henry.  Can you?"</P>
<P>     By contrast, Freddy Ace is a tough, heartless thug, a driver for a
protection racket headed by crime boss Mr. Paris (Fred Ward).
Ironically, Freddy has a home life with a wife and two kids (although
his idea of a bedtime story is Field Marshall Rommel's biography!).
His ditzy blonde wife Sharon (played by Lori Singer) fawns all over
him, constantly referring to him as "The Best."  "That's very
superficial, Sharon," Freddy comments dryly, "...but true."  Their
scenes together are punctuated by Rudolph's trademark snappy dialogue.</P>
<P>     Supporting characters are equally well developed.  Beverly's
brother and Henry's best friend Russell (Kevin J. O'Connor in an
energetically nervous performance) is obsessed with a waitress in a
local restaurant.  Henry's father Pete (played by the versatile
character actor M. Emmett Walsh) is an aging garage owner, full of
vaudeville shtick and nonsense.  And Henry's neighbor Rosie (Oscar
winner Marisa Tomei), a prostitute with a kid in tow, is also
charmingly flamboyant.</P>
<P>     While the brothers' separate-but-linked stories unfold, the
mysteries of their origins are gradually revealed through the
investigations of an aspiring writer, played by Tyra Ferrell (who can
currently be seen upstaging Janet Jackson in POETIC JUSTICE).  This
exposition, involving grand romance and a blind trust fund, is more
mainstream than one might expect from Rudolph, and therefore less
interesting--Ferrell's Sonya Kirk is well played but she's undoubtedly
the straightest character in the film.</P>
<P>     Matthew Modine's skill at bringing two diametrically opposed
characters to life is commendable.  He's not your typical actor playing
two roles aided by deliberate costume changes, makeup, or vocal
manipulations.  Henry and Freddy are two complete personalities, one
vulnerable, one hardened, both evoking empathy.  Reverse sides of the
same coin.  When light and dark come together and are equal (the film's
title defined), Henry is finally given the opportunity to confront
himself.</P>
<P>     After two disappointing films (LOVE AT LARGE and the
production-troubled MORTAL THOUGHTS), Alan Rudolph has reestablished
himself as a director with a flair for writing moody, colorful
characters into inventive situations.  EQUINOX should not only satisfy
his fans, but garner him some new ones.</P>
