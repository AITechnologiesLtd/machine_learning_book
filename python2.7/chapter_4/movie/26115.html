<PRE>_Bait_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        _Bait_ does serve its primary purpose: to serve as a showcase for
the comic talents of star Jamie Foxx, whose excitable energy is mirrored
by the slick direction of Antoine Fuqua.  Too bad there's too much of a
story that asks that the suspension of disbelief be stretched to
uncomfortable lengths.</P>
<P>        The bait of the title is Foxx's Alvin Sanders, a none-too-bright
thief who is released early from prison because his arresting officer
falsified evidence.  Or, rather, that is the excuse cooked up by U.S.
Treasury agent Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), who really wants to use
Alvin to lure one Bristol (Doug Hutchison), the murderous mastermind
behind a multimillion-dollar gold heist, out of hiding.  Why Alvin?  It
turns out he was the cellmate of Bristol's now-deceased partner, who gave
Alvin clues as to where the still-missing gold is hidden.</P>
<P>        There is even more to this story.  Alvin has been implanted with
an electronic device that enables the Feds to monitor his every move and
word.  His release, let alone his being outfitted with such experimental
technology, was done under the radar of the government highers-up, so in
order for Clenteen's plan to work, Alvin has to stay out of trouble--a
difficult thing for a career criminal such as he.  However, Alvin does
have some added motivation to stay on the straight and narrow--among the
things he finds changed after 18 months in the pen is that girlfriend
Lisa (Kimberly Elise, wasted) is now also mother to his baby son.</P>
<P>        As can easily be gleaned, _Bait_ is seriously overplotted (Andrew
and Adam Scheinman and Tony Gilroy are the credited writers), let alone
wildly far-fetched.  This is, after all, an action comedy, and the
scribes would have been wiser to pay more attention to the jokes. 
Nonetheless, given the narrative overload, _Bait_ works better than
expected.  Foxx is able to sell even the weaker one-liners, and he is
convincing when the story pushes him into action.  Fuqua, who previously
proved his ability to stylishly handle an action scene in
_The_Replacement_Killers_, brings similar visual pizzazz to the set
pieces here.</P>
<P>        But the good in _Bait_ isn't enough to overcome the crippling
excess.  In addition to the convoluted plot, there's the matter of the
curious performance of Hutchison, who plays bad Bristol by channelling
John Malkovich and Kevin Spacey's most effete mannerisms.  Even Fuqua
lets himself get out of hand, employing his flashy technique for a scene
where Alvin quietly recalls a warm childhood memory.  But these quibbles
are likely to be lost on general audiences, whom I suspect (and
understandably so) will not only eat up this shiny piece of product, but
be satisfied by it as well.  But for anyone looking for true cinematic
nourishment, _Bait_ is not a meal.</P>
