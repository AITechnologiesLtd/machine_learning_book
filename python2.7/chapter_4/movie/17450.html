<PRE>                              THE MOD SQUAD
                        A movie review by Joe Barlow

<PRE>                RATING: * 1/2  (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        Absolutely nothing happens in "The Mod Squad," MGM's new
misguided big-screen remake of the "classic" (in the same way
that the rusted Chevy stacked up on cinder blocks and leaking
oil in your neighbor's front yard is a classic) television show.</P>
<P>        Three juvenile delinquints are offered a choice between going
to prison or assisting the police department in an undercover
investigation.  Although they lack experience, training, or
discernible personalities, they agree to the terms of the deal.
The "kids" in question are Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete
Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Linc Hayes (Omar Epps),
who are deemed a valuable resource by their sponsor, Adam Greer
(Dennis Farina).  "They can get into places we can't," he
solemnly explains to anyone who'll listen.  The outcasts sign
aboard as "unofficial officers," which means they're forbidden
to carry badges, firearms, or the audience's interest.</P>
<P>        When Greer is found dead shortly thereafter, his "mod
squad" are identified as the prime suspects.  Knowing they've
been set up, the trio vows to solve the murder and clear their
name.  Julie apparently thinks the best way to assist in the
investigation is to sit in the bathroom floor and drink, which
leaves Pete free to wander around like a brain-damaged yak in
a china store.  It's up to Linc to save the day, and he does not
disappoint: the way he dramatically sneers at one of the villains
is the closest thing to an action sequence contained here.</P>
<P>        Excuse me, I mispoke: there are no "villains" in "The
Mod Squad."  To be a villain, one must have a discernable goal,
something towards which the character (and movie) is building.
"The Mod Squad" just has "bad guys," with the most evil character
still being at least a thesis away from true villainhood.  The
idenity of film's chief "bad guy" is so astonishingly obvious
that I was surprised the movie even attempted to make it into
a mystery.  I mean, duh.</P>
<P>        Giovanni Ribisi is rapidly proving himself to be one
of the most annoying actors working in movies today: I submit
this movie, "The Other Sister," and "First Love, Last Rites"
as evidence.  He's supposed to be comic relief here, but his
performance is like being cornered at a party by an obnoxious
drunk.  Claire Danes, who is often excellent, is barely
going through the motions, while Omar Epps, bless his heart, is
all the more pityable because he's actually trying to save the
movie.  It's so cute!</P>
<PRE>        "The Mod Squad" is so forgettable that most of it has
already faded from my mind.  Godspeed to the rest of it.</PRE>
