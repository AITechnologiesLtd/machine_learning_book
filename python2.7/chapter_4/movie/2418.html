<P>     An underdog team gets an infusion of outside talent (either a
player or a coach) and goes from the bottom to the top, winning the
championship in a game whose result is never in doubt for those sitting
in the audience.  This is the plot of dozens of sports-related motion
pictures, including HOOSIERS, one of the best basketball-related
films.  It is *not*, however, the plot of BLUE CHIPS, a rare example of
an entry into this genre which attempts to be honest and unique.</P>
<P>     Coach Pete Bell of Western University (Nick Nolte) is going
through a nightmare season.  After a decade of winning, his team is
about to finish with a sub-.500 record for the first time in his
tenure.  It's not that his players don't have heart, but the Western
University Dolphins are thin on talent, so getting several blue chip
prospects becomes the driving motivation for the off-season.  Coach
Bell singles out three (Shaquille O'Neal, Anfernee Hardaway, and Matt
Nover) to pursue.  They all like Western U, but two are demanding a
little something "under the table," which goes against Coach Bell's
principles.  Nevertheless, facing another losing season, he is forced
to consider that cars and cash might not be the worst price to pay.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best decision made by writer Ron Shelton and director
William Friedkin was to focus on the off-court politics of recruiting
rather than on the team's wins and losses.  In the end, that's what
makes BLUE CHIPS different from so many other, similarly-marketed
movies.  There is a big showdown at the end, but the basketball game
becomes peripheral to a more important crisis.  It is a catalyst, not a
conclusion.</P>
<P>     Those who expect Shaquille O'Neal to dominate the film will be
disappointed.  While the NBA star has his share of scenes, the acting
required is limited (and mercifully within his capabilities--this is
nothing like Dan Marino's movie debut in ACE VENTURA).  From start to
finish, this is Nick Nolte's picture, and his performance is energetic
to the point of frenzy.  It doesn't take long to discern that Coach
Bell is modeled after Indiana's Bobby Knight (who, along with numerous
other basketball luminaries, makes an appearance).</P>
<P>     The central moral dilemma facing Coach Bell is whether or not to
agree to pay off players with alumni money.  While this goes against
everything he believes in, it becomes apparent that it may not be
possible to field a winning team without breaking the rules.  There's a
good dose of reality in this story, even if the script occasionally
becomes too preachy.  The end sequences especially could have been
toned down.</P>
<P>     BLUE CHIPS is peppered with subtle humor and in jokes.  One prime
example is former UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian (who was constantly
accused of recruiting violations by the NCAA) expressing genuine
concern about whether a prospective college player has the grades to
stay academically eligible.  The film's conclusion also features a
droll parody of the "what happened to our characters after this movie
ends..." messages that reality-based dramas often scroll across the
screen.</P>
<P>     As for the actual basketball sequences, they're exceptionally well
done, as accurately capturing as possible the feel of a college game.
The presence of several real-life stars elevates the level of on-court
intensity.  Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway may be merely
adequate delivering their lines, but they're electric with the ball in
their hands.</P>
<P>     BLUE CHIPS will obviously appeal more to basketball aficionados
than to those who are indifferent to the sport.  Despite an advertising
blitz of slam-dunks and crisp passes, this film has a story to tell
which does not demand a recognition of Dick Vitale.  The theme, which
deals with facing the consequences of one's actions, is universal, even
if the attraction of "the Shaq" isn't.</P>
