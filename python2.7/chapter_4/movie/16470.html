<PRE>Absolute Power (1997, R)</PRE>
<P>Produced and Directed by Clint Eastwood.</P>
<PRE>Written by William Goldman</PRE>
<P>Starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, and Laura
Linney</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> Let me start off saying two things to two people.  Number one, to William
Goldman: I'm not saying this because I'm supporting or defending Clinton
(which I'm NOT), but do please stop writing political thrillers.  Number
two, to Ed Harris: well, at least it was better than Stepmom.</P>
<P> Number three actually would have gone to Clint Eastwood: pleas stop
starring, producing, and directing your own movies but he obviously got the
point as nary a frame of the intriguing Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil shows him.</P>
<P> That said, let's go on to my review of Absolute Power, which is twenty
notches above Murder at 1600, which I saw being filmed, but a hundred
notches below Six Days in May, In the Line of Fire, or about any other
political thriller you can name.</P>
<P> Absolute Power is pleasantly mediocre.  You don't expect much, and you
don't get much.
 It is yet another film following the Clinton chic of films, books, etc
which show our nations President as someone who's able to get laid, in
contrast to someone who couldn't get it up without Viagra (if we had Dole,
folks, NONE of this crap would be happening). Absolute Power is the story of
a President who has sex with a girl and, whoops, ends up killing her.
Unlike Murder at 1600, which shows the girl being done right in the opening
credits, Absolute Power waits a nice ten to fifteen minutes before getting
down to business.</P>
<P> When it gets down to business, Luther (Clint Eastwood ) is breaking into an
estate to steal millions.  His perfect heist is interrupted by something
unplanned: the president is going to have sex with the billionaires wife.
Things get a little rough, one thing leads to another, and the girl ends up
shot by secret service agents seconds before she's going to give President
Al (Gene Hackman) a Lorraina Bobbit.</P>
<P> Of course, since we live in the wonderful democracy where everyone is free
to make a dumbly plotted and cliche film as they want, the Chief of Staff
decides its for the best if the girl stumbled upon a burglary and was shot.
Forget for a second that her dress has been ripped, the President's
fingerprints are all over her, and a secret service agent (Scott Glenn) made
sure he hadn't done a Bill Clinton.</P>
<P> Now, going out of the character of a jewel thief who just witnessed a
murder from a secret room and stole $5,000,000 worth of material, Clint
grows a heart, picks up the piece of evidence left behind, and leaves.  Of
course secret service agents chase him.  Of course he runs into a cop (Ed
Harris) who believes him because the facts don't add up, and of course his
daughter (Laura Linney) grows closer to the old man through a complicated
process of stocking her fridge at just the right time and saving her life.</P>
<P> The only really redeeming aspects to the film, the saving graces against
terrible performances by the ensemble cast and William Goldman's piss-poor
script is the steely direction by Clint Eastwood.  Mixing in just the right
amount of light, the right tone and time of the music and working with such
a terrible script, Clint Eastwood does directing up to par with A Perfect
World and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  He's as good of a
director as he always was, and that alone makes the film enjoyable.  He
gives as much that he can to a movie with such a bad script, as do the
actors.  This will be on the movie's gravestone: "They tried, they really
tried".</P>
<P> Now, from all of this, you'd expect that I'm telling you to skip Absolute
Power.  I'm not.  I'm just saying don't drive to rent it.  Should Absolute
Power be on TMC or ShowTime, like it was for me, go ahead and watch it.
You'll have fun.  If you're a Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry jag, see it.  It's
just up in the air.</P>
