<PRE>                             THE REFLECTING SKIN
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Philip Ridley</PRE>
<PRE>  This film is  well worth seeing.</PRE>
<PRE>     But I don't have any snappy phrases from the film to use as a
hook:</PRE>
<P>     The images that I got from this film were paintings: paintings
I've seen and admired, or images which were familiar:</P>
<P>     The first of these is Edvard Munch's  "The Scream": a shimmering,
distorted figure in the act of a primal angst:  the image occurred to
me in a scene with the character Cameron (Viggo Mortensen).</P>
<P>     Second is a painting called "Christina's World" by Andrew Wyeth: a
scene of the wheatfields of the plains with a single figure looking
towards a barren cabin.</P>
<P>     THE REFLECTING SKIN is one of those pictures whose dramatic
content will be compromised by 'home viewing' with its distractions and
lack of an audience to share the experience.</P>
<P>     It is, however, one of the most affecting films I have ever seen.
A second viewing did not change this opinion one whit.</P>
<P>     As with other fine art films, to attempt to describe it and the
power of the images would simply spoil or fail to do the film justice.</P>
<PRE>     Highest recommendation.</PRE>
