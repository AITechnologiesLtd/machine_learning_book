<PRE>Raising Arizona (1987)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 84</PRE>
<P>There is a world out there where everyone is equally
stupid, weird and funny.  And they don't even know it.
That world can be found in "Raising Arizona", an inspired
comedy with a feel that has never been successfully
imitated.</P>
<P>Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter are a husband and wife,
ex-con and ex-cop team that have one thing missing from
their lives: she cannot have children.  With Cage's
criminal record, adoption is impossible.  Reading about
a furniture magnate's wife delivering quintuplets,
the young couple kidnaps one of the kids.</P>
<P>The plot becomes ever more complex and crazy as Cage
loses his job, and returns to robbing convenience stores.
John Goodman and William Forsythe show up as stupid
prison escapees who learn the secret behind the baby's
sudden arrival.</P>
<P>Much of the humor comes from Cage's deadpan expressions.
Hunter is adorable as Cage's excitable wife, while
Goodman gets more good lines than he did on the final
two seasons of "Roseanne".</P>
<P>Bratty kids alert!  Cage's boss pays him a visit,
bringing his pre-adolescent kids, who are among the
biggest brats in celluloid history.  It doesn't help
that father actually encourages them.  Are they too
young for military school?</P>
<P>You know that "Raising Arizona" must be a great comedy if
it can find a good role for Randall 'Tex' Cobb, former
Larry Holmes punching bag.  Cobb was born to play the Lone
Motorcyclist of the Apocalypse, who wears a tattoo that
states "Mama Didn't Love Me".</P>
<P>Web surfing reveals that Roger Ebert only gave this film
one-and-a-half stars.  Well, I'm sure that some people laugh
at my grades too!</P>
