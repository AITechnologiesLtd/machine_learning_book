<P>Every once in a while a great pair of films comes along.  JEAN DE FLORETTE
and MANON OF THE SPRING are just such a pair.</P>
<P>With a lot of the French dramatic slowness in these films, the story will
eventually grab you.  It won't be until the last thirty minutes of MANON
that you can quite understand what is going on, but until then you keep
wondering, where, what, and why are things happening the way they are.</P>
<P>There are some striking similarities between these films and the serialized
soap operas found on television.  In many ways, the twists and turns are all
the same, and the wrenches thrown in at various moments do not help the
characters very much.  They make the whole thing more difficult.</P>
<P>An educated young man, inherits a farm, and moves in from the city.  The
people who worked the farm before don't like the young man's ideas, and
proceed to do anything and everything they can to make sure he does not
succeed.  And they do it by making sure that the season's drought conditions
continue by plugging up the main well, which also feeds water to the town.
The young man is a hunchback, has a wife and two kids.  His fight for
survival is magnanimous on all accounts, but eventually it ends in tragedy.
He is the outsider, is ugly, is educated, and has no place in the country
telling the folk how to grow anything in their farms.  The young daughter
Manon, at the age of six or
seven, finds out that the old man and his accomplice have in fact plugged
the well, and are planning to wait for the verdict of the courts who will
decide to whom the property will go, and who will take care of it.  However,
the  girl is young, she's the black sheep, and her family is dead.</P>
<P>Gerard Depardieu is the city man and hunchback with many ideas, all which
work and are sensible, but he is the representative of the new order of
things, and the failed old order rejects him.</P>
<P>And Yves Montand is the old farmer, whose attitude is downright abusive, but
also charming.  He is as sneaky as he is nice to the young children, and the
town folk who admire him for being the best farmer, and at one time the best
lover.</P>
<P>This first part is innocent enough, though now something is established in
MANON.</P>
<P>Although a bit slow of a film and it has subtitles, this is an excellent
film and should be seen by anyone who appreciates great film making.  It is
similar in many ways ( to my eyes ) to a David Lean film, in that the shot
composition is pretty and nicely done.  And the country side is beautiful.</P>
