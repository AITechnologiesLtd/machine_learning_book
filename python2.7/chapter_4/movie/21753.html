<PRE>"Dogma" -- Divine Irreverence
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>The litmus test to whether you'll enjoy this movie
comes in the very first 15 minutes of the film.  An
eminent Cardinal of the Catholic Church is about to
unveil a marketing promotion to reinvigorate the
Church's waning attendance numbers.  Comedian George
Carlin plays the Cardinal.  He espouses the Church's
newest campaign, Catholicism Wow!  He points out that
people believe that the Church has lost its spark and
youthfulness.  This campaign intends to turn things
around.  To kick things off, he introduces the
Church's newest sacred image called Buddy Christ.  The
current holy but wholly depressing icon of Jesus
hanging from the cross gives the people the 'willies,'
as he puts it.  This updated, friendlier
representation has Jesus winking, giving a warm smile,
and displaying a Roger Ebert-like thumbs-up.  As
another component of his campaign, he designates the
entrance to his church as a mechanism of forgiveness. 
Simply pass through the arch, and all of your sins
will be forgotten.</P>
<P>This blessed arch is big news for two fallen angels,
Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck).  These
two were responsible for the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorra, which understandably incurred God's wrath. 
Exiled to Wisconsin, they have long-awaited their
chance to reenter paradise, and this new loophole in
Church dogma may just be their ticket.  The
consequence, however, is that we'll all be blinked out
of existence.  A celestial war is about to ensue, but
it is a human that will be needed to save us all. 
Bethany (feisty Linda Fiorentino) is selected for this
holy crusade.  She is visited by the 'voice of God'
(Alan Rickman) who asks her for her help.  Here's
another wacky moment.  He appears as a column of flame
(a la Burning Bush) in her bedroom.  She is not awed
by this presence, and instead, reaches for the fire
extinguisher.</P>
<P>She grudgingly accepts this bizarre mission.  Along
the way, she meets up with a host of celestial good
guys who want to help Bethany.  These include two
prophets, very foul-mouthed Jay (Jason Mewes) and
Silent Bob (Bob Smith); a muse-turned-stripper (Salma
Hayek); and Rufus, the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock, who
actually curses less than Jason Mewes).  Celestial bad
guys want to stop Bethany, led by Azrael (Jason Lee). 
He welcomes the end of existence and promises to help
Loki and Bartelby reenter paradise.</P>
<P>What detracts from an otherwise clever film is the
second act.  Story lines begin to splinter and it
isn't exactly clear who is trying to accomplish what
and for what reasons.  As the impending apocalyptic
events are about to unfold, explanations are given so
quickly that I felt that I needed to rewind the film
again in order to really understand what was taking
place.  Gratuitous violence begins to overshadow the
tone that has been established, and that made the film
seem unbalanced.</P>
<P>Still, I was able to get by the 15-minute litmus test,
and laughed at this satirically good-natured film.  In
part, I enjoyed Fiorentino's steady performance and
appreciated the unconventionality of this movie,
including Rufus's explanation of why no one has ever
heard of the 13th apostle.  And, if you can stay the
course, it would be no surprise that Jesus might
actually be black or that God was a woman (and they
might have been because I wasn't here 2000 years ago).
 Beneath the obscenities, there is intelligent
commentary about the belief structures in place within
Church doctrine.  I don't think it blasphemous of me
to say that Director Kevin Smith has certainly taken a
leap of faith with a film that has some genuinely
clever ideas.</P>
