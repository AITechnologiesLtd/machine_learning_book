<P>     If Albert Einstein watched this movie while traveling at the speed
of light, would he still think that three hours had passed instead of
two?  No, THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD is not about time-
travel, but it *is* one of those unfortunate movies that makes you
feel like you've lived sixty more minutes than you actually have.  And
that's too bad, given the many interesting ingredients in this film that
never quite come together.</P>
<P>     Director Gary Fleder makes a mash of Scott Rosenberg's script about
a gang of usual suspects who botch a reunion job with disastrous
results.  Both his pacing and his framing of the story are way off.  The
cast is a pleasant distraction, sure, but only Treat Williams-- as the
resident psycho-- registers completely.  (He delivers a great monologue
while pissing into a milk jug!)  To be fair, Fleder does a good job of
keeping everything reeking of death.  The reaper is everywhere in DENVER
and it makes for a great, grim subtext.</P>
