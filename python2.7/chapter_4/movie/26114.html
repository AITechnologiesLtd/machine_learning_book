<P>_Turn_It_Up_ (R) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>        Another day, another urban drama starring rappers with acting
aspirations.  The latest entry, _Turn_It_Up_, offers nothing that hasn't
been seen nor heard before--lots of gunplay, beatings, drug and alcohol
abuse, all to a hip-hop soundtrack.  But it is distinctive in a most
dubious sense--this is perhaps the worst film of its kind to see a
theatrical release.</P>
<P>        Mind you, this isn't the worst rapper-starring urban drama ever
made; it doesn't quite reach the depths plumbed by the direct-to-video
projects produced by and featuring Ice-T.  But _Turn_It_Up_ is pretty
awful in its own respect.  Scripter-director Robert Adetuyi put in very
little thought to the plot, which plays into the common perception that
the rap music business is dirty and violence-riddled.  Diamond (Pras,
late of the Fugees) wants to break into said industry, but the studio
time for cutting his demo is also cutting deep into what little money he
earns doing menial jobs for a local drug lord named Mr. B. (Jason
Statham).  When the already steep price for the recording sessions goes
up, Diamond's hotheaded best friend and partner Gage (Ja Rule) comes up
with a seemingly foolproof--and, of course, illegal--funding plan. 
Needless to say, the plan doesn't go off without a hitch or two.</P>
<P>        To say that _Turn_It_Up_ doesn't go off without a hitch or two is
an understatement.  Beyond the tired, predictable plot--and the equally
dull subplots, such as Diamond's fed-up girlfriend (Tamala Jones) and the
sudden surfacing of Diamond's long-absent father (Vondie Curtis-Hall, way
beneath his league here)--there's some truly abysmal dialogue (Diamond's
raps are invariably described as "hot") and acting to match.  Jones and
Curtis-Hall emerge with their dignity intact, but that's partly a side
effect of having fairly little screen time and mostly because they
actually have some acting ability.  That cannot be said of everyone else.
 The two rap stars leading the cast are no acting finds; Pras is stiff,
and Ja Rule subscribes to the adage, "if you can't act, overact."  As bad
as they are, they are outdone by the weak work of Statham and the
laughably atrocious John Ralston, who plays record label bigwig Mr.
White.</P>
<P>        But what really does in _Turn_It_Up_ is what's under the terrible
execution--or, rather, what isn't there.  The script doesn't offer any
reason why we should really care about any of these characters and what
happens to them, nor do these characters exhibit any qualities that would
consistently engage our interest.  For all the mayhem that fills the
screen in _Turn_It_Up_--and there is a lot of it, both visual and
sonic--the film is still a crushing bore.</P>
