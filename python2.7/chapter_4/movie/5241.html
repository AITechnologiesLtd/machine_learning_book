<P>      Most gay and lesbian-themed movies focus on the search for a 
perfect mate.  Cheryl Dunye's THE WATERMELON WOMAN, which won the Teddy 
Bear award for best gay feature film at the Berlin Film Festival, is a 
rare, and welcome, exception.  Sure, love and sex are elements of THE 
WATERMELON WOMAN, but this film is about much more.  Dunye spends a lot 
more time out of the bedroom than inside it in this funny, insightful 
look at a young lesbian film maker tracking the real life story of the 
subject of her documentary.</P>
<P>     Dunye plays Cheryl, a Philadelphia video store clerk who's making a 
movie on the side.  It's about "the Watermelon Woman", an obscure black 
actress who had bit parts in a number of pre-1950 motion pictures with 
titles like PLANTATION MEMORIES.  As Cheryl digs for facts about the 
woman, she discovers a surprising number of similarities between herself 
and her subject.  The Watermelon Woman, actually named Faye Richards, 
was a lesbian who lived in Philadelphia, didn't conceal her lifestyle, 
and loved movies.  Cheryl becomes obsessed about learning everything she 
can about Faye, and her hunt leads her to friends and intimates of the 
late actress. </P>
<P>     THE WATERMELON WOMAN is also about Cheryl's personal life, which 
ultimately becomes entwined with her film making.  Her best friend, who 
also works with her at the video store, is an acid-tongued lesbian named 
Tamara (Valerie Walker).  Tamara objects to Cheryl's burgeoning 
relationship with a white woman, Diana (Guinevere Turner), and keeps 
trying to set her best friend up with other, usually off-the-wall, black 
lesbians.  It doesn't work, though -- Cheryl's attraction to Diana is 
too strong.</P>
<P>     Dunye frequently interrupts her narrative for person-on-the-street 
interviews, several of which are very funny.  Some of the responses to 
the question she asks, "Do you know who the Watermelon Woman is?" are 
sidesplitting.  Well-known social critic Camille Paglia has a cameo in 
which she delivers a memorably bizarre monologue about her perception of 
the symbolic meaning of a watermelon.</P>
<P>     The Watermelon Woman is a fictitious creation, but, watching this 
film, it's easy to believe that there really was a Faye Richards.  Dunye 
does such an excellent job re-creating old, black-and-white film clips 
and glossy photographs that, combined with the pseudo-documentary style 
of much of the film, might tempt a viewer to search a movie database for 
a list of the Watermelon Woman's credits.</P>
<P>     Dunye's film looks like it was produced with almost no money (which 
it was), but that's part of its essential charm.  This is the kind of 
story that, if told in a less experimental manner, wouldn't have worked 
nearly as well.  THE WATERMELON WOMAN is imbued with freshness, and 
that's it's best quality.  Dunye has crafted a motion picture that can 
be appreciated by all audiences -- male, female, black, white, gay, and 
straight.  It's a celebration of life and diversity in the City of 
Sisterly Love.</P>
