<P>Quentin Tarantino had the good sense to step back after the world ate up
the cinematic feast that was Pulp Fiction (that is, if you don't count
his forgettable appearances as an actor).  Or maybe the three and a half
years between Fiction's Golden Palm win at Cannes and the release of
Jackie Brown just seemed like an eternity.  While Brown wasn't embraced
as warmly by critics or viewers, the film was a step forward in terms of
Tarantino's visual style and, more importantly, it allowed the
writer/director to tell a different story with different characters.</P>
<P>Conversely, Guy Ritchie has quickly followed up his hit Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels with a film that shows very little growth.  Snatch
is simply more of the same, and could even be considered a companion
film to Lock, Stock.  It offers nothing new, but that's not necessarily
a bad thing.  You don't hear people complaining that George Lucas is
still making films about Jedi Masters and The Force, do you?</P>
<P>Snatch offers two different stories for your viewing pleasure.  One
features two amateur boxing promoters – Turkish (Jason Statham from
Lock, Stock) and Tony (Stephen Graham) – who inadvertently get wrapped
up in a fight-fixing scheme with a crooked Don King type aptly named
Brick Top (Lock, Stock's Alan Ford).  When Turkish and Tony's fighter,
Gorgeous George, is put out of commission just days before Brick Top's
fixed fight, the two protagonists have to lure a greasy, unintelligible,
bare-knuckled Gypsy legend (deftly played by Brad Pitt, Fight Club) to
stand in for their injured man.</P>
<P>In the meantime, an 84-karat diamond has been stolen from Antwerp by a
gambling addict named Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro, Traffic).
As the giant stone makes its way to London, groups of various thugs wait
to take it off Franky's hands (or take off Franky's hand, since the
diamond is in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist).  There's the
seemingly indestructible Russian gangster Boris The Blade (Rade
Sherbedgia, Space Cowboys), the American crook Avi (Dennis Farina,
Reindeer Games) and a plethora of other zany characters that pass the
rock around like a hot potato.</P>
<P>The two stories converge at various times throughout the film, and all
of it is completely unbelievable, but entertaining nonetheless.  Ritchie
ups the formula he used in Lock, Stock by making Snatch's story a bit
more complicated, using more characters with wackier names played by
bigger acting talent.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as funny or
well-structured as his previous film.  Instead, Snatch is like a typical
American blockbuster, where the plot takes a backseat to a collection of
cartoonish supporting characters and over-the-top action sequences. Some
of the unnecessary violence was reminiscent of the mean-spirited dud
Payback, but the boxing scenes were done very well.</P>
<P>On the plus side, Ritchie's gritty, stylish direction is just as slick
here as it was in Lock, Stock.  Whether you're talking about the
impressive title cards that introduce each character at the beginning of
the film, or the Run Lola Run-ish montage used to show Franky's gambling
addiction, or the accelerated/decelerated/repeated clips of key events,
Ritchie is clearly on top of his game.  The film is full of clever
editing (some of it is very much like Requiem For a Dream), dazzling
camera work and great music (plus a Madonna song, to boot).</P>
<P>1:44 – for strong violence, adult language and some nudity</P>
