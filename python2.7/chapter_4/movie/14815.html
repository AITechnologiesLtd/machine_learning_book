MONUMENT AVE.
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>The bathroom, that's where most of the guys who live in the neighborhood
hang out.</P>
<P>At least they always claim to have been "in the head" when murders
occur, as they frequently do in Charlestown, a bleak Irish-American
ghetto in Boston.  As the streetwise Detective Hanolon, Martin Sheen
explains the rules to the new kid on the block, a recent Irish immigrant
named Seamus (Jason Barry).  Hanolon tells Seamus that every man in bar
that day will have been relieving himself when a snitch named Teddy
(Billy Crudup) was gun-downed in cold blood.  Sure enough, to a man,
they all swear during their brief interrogations to have been in the
restroom at the time of the crime.</P>
<P>As directed by Ted Demme and written by Mike Armstrong, MONUMENT AVE.
concentrates on the texture and the hopelessness of the community that
the people feel stuck in.  Although there are no guards at the border,
it is clear that the locals are trapped.  Having been together since
childhood, the guys are bound to their life of snorting cocaine,
drinking booze, stealing cars and gambling away the money they don't
spend on drugs.  Using jump cuts and fast-talking dialog, the movie
imparts an immediacy that allows the movie to transcend the lack
substantial narrative drive.  Filmed by Adam Kimmel in a dull blue gray
and with dilapidated location sets by Ruth Ammon, the visuals convey
hopelessness and poignancy.</P>
<P>One of the film's major pitfalls is that the director allows the actors
to get sloppy, causing much of the dialog to be lost to low mumbling.
And the actors' Irish accents wax and wane like the moon.  Sometimes
they are thick and convincing, and other times they mysteriously vanish.</P>
<P>A remarkably controlled Denis Leary plays the lead character Bobby
O'Grady in an ensemble cast.  The few times that Bobby loses control of
the situation are all the more impressive because the usually explosive
Leary keeps his emotions in check throughout most of the picture.</P>
<P>Bobby is so much a part of the neighborhood culture that he struggles to
answer the hardest question of the movie.  An attractive yuppie named
Annie, played in a cameo by Jeanne Tripplehorn, has happened into his
bar.  When he hits on her, to the great consternation of Bobby's
girlfriend (Famke Janssen), Annie asks him what he does.  Stammering
nervously, he replies that he works on antique cars.  Actually he steals
cars, mainly newer ones, to support his habit, but honesty is rarely the
best policy in such circumstances.</P>
<P>The movie works best in its small moments, which the director gets just
right.  One scene has the guys arguing over the relative merits of the
movies of their generation.  All are in agreement on THE BREAKFAST CLUB,
but ST. ELMO'S FIRE is more controversial.  In another scene, Bobby's
girlfriend comes in drunk and sexually aroused.  His reaction isn't to
take advantage of the situation, but, instead, to cuddle with her and
let her fall asleep in his arms as he covers her gently with a blanket.</P>
<P>Colm Meaney plays Jackie O'Hara, the local crime boss.  Like the old
mill towns, in which the mills owned the stores as well as the only
place of employment, Jackie employs many of the locals and is also the
neighborhood bookie.  This means that he gives money only to take even
more back, leaving Bobby and his friends constantly beholding to him.
Since they have few ways at getting back at him or their surroundings, a
street hockey game with Jackie and his other hoods provide one of the
few harmless outlets for their aggression.</P>
<P>Typical of their unlucky life, the film's title comes from a botched job
shown in flashback.  Mouse Murphy (Ian Hart) had gone to rob an
apartment on Monument Ave., when a comfortable waterbed lulled him into
a sound sleep.  Interrupted by the surprised owner, the only thing Mouse
managed to take was a nap.</P>
<P>Like members trapped in a religious cult, Charlestown's inhabitants have
no idea that leaving is even an option.  The tragedy of their situation
isn't what happens, but what doesn't or, at least in their view, what
can't.</P>
<P>MONUMENT AVE. runs 1:33.  It is not rated but would be an R for
violence, profanity, and pervasive hard drug usage and would be
acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature.</P>
