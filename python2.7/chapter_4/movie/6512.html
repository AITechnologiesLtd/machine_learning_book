<P>     In the past decade, only two live-action, mainstream musical motion 
pictures have been released.  While the first, LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, 
met with some success, the second, NEWSIES, was a box-office disaster.  
The poor performance of the Disney-backed film seemed to confirm the 
common perception that, as a movie genre, the musical was dead.  Now, 
however, as 1996 draws to a close, two films are arriving to challenge 
that belief.  The better-known of the pair is, of course, EVITA.  
However, another musical has beaten it to theaters by more than two 
weeks:  Woody Allen's EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.</P>
<P>     Anyone who surveys Allen's career as a writer/director/actor will 
find three common threads woven through nearly all of his movies:  wit, 
neuroses, and music.  In EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, Allen once again 
combines these elements, but with a new twist -- this time, instead of 
relying on standards from the '30s and '40s as background music, he 
catapults them into the fore.  His characters, all using their own 
voices, sing and dance to classics like "I'm a Dreamer", "I'm Through 
With Love", and "Looking at You."  All-in-all, there are something like 
fifteen numbers, with almost every major member of the cast getting an 
opportunity to warble at least one line.</P>
<P>     With EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, Allen is paying homage to the way 
musicals used to be made, back in the era when stars who didn't have 
great voices were occasionally forced to sing.  Here, it doesn't always 
result in the sort of track you'll want on a CD, but it's nice to know 
that sung lines are not being dubbed, and Allen himself doesn't suddenly 
sound like Elton John when he breaks into song.  Yes, it's almost 
painful to endure Julia Roberts' single number, but it's hard not to 
respect her for trying, or Allen for giving her the chance. </P>
<P>     The plot, which centers loosely around one sprawling, extended 
family, is extremely complicated, primarily because there are so many 
characters.  For most of the film, Allen makes effective use of his 
ensemble cast; only near the end does the crowd of people vying for 
screen time turn into a detriment.  That's not a surprise, however, 
considering that the last fifteen minutes of the movie are its weakest, 
in spite of a wonderful song-and-dance number featuring Allen and a 
feather-light Goldie Hawn (who can sing).</P>
<P>     The story is told from the point-of-view of DJ (Natasha Lyonne), 
the college-age daughter of Joe (Allen) and Steffi (Hawn).  DJ's parents 
have been divorced for a decade-and-a-half, but they get along well.  In 
fact, Joe considers Steffi and her husband, Bob (Alan Alda), to be his 
best friends, and, when his latest girlfriend dumps him, he flies from 
his home in Paris to New York to commiserate.  DJ also has a step-
sister, Skylar (Drew Barrymore), who is about to become engaged to a 
proper, upright guy in a suit (Edward Norton).  Her stepbrother, Scott 
(Lukas Haas), has shocked the entire family by stating that he has 
joined the Young Conservatives.  And her two half-sisters, Lane (Gabby 
Hoffman) and Laura (Natalie Portman), are trying to summon the courage 
to speak to a boy whom they both find attractive.  Tim Roth is on-hand 
as a tough guy who recalls Chazz Palminteri's gangster from BULLETS OVER 
BROADWAY.  Meanwhile, it's not long before Joe finds himself drawn to a 
younger woman (Julia Roberts), but it takes all of DJ's considerable 
powers of persuasion to get him to overcome his angst and pursue her.</P>
<P>     When it comes to humor, EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is right up there 
with two of Allen's better, recent comic releases, MANHATTAN MURDER 
MYSTERY and BULLETS OVER BROADWAY.  Like those films, EVERYONE SAYS I 
LOVE YOU is overflowing with genuinely funny moments that span the 
spectrum from physical comedy to sly, sophisticated wit.  Allen gets in 
a number of terrific one-liners, none of which I'll reveal here.  His 
comic sense extends to the musical numbers, many of which are done 
tongue-in-cheek.  There's one sequence where ghosts rise from the grave 
to dance around and another where doctors and patients form a chorus 
line.  </P>
<P>     One area where EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU falls a little short is in 
its observations about the human condition.  In his best films (such as 
ANNIE HALL  and HANNAH AND HER SISTERS), Allen has always used comedy as 
the proverbial "means to an end" of saying something insightful about 
how men and women interact with each other.  EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is 
surprisingly shallow in that regard, going for numerous, broad 
generalizations rather than depth.  Again, perhaps this is the result of 
having so many stories to tell.</P>
<P>     Despite some unlikely names, Allen has chosen a near-perfect cast, 
only a few members of which are underused (particularly Natalie 
Portman).  Roberts is luminous.  Norton (PRIMAL FEAR) and newcomer 
Lyonne have abundant charisma.  Roth is a hoot.  Alda and Hawn make for 
a pleasant, albeit slightly off-kilter couple.  And Allen, as always, is 
Allen.  Even Drew Barrymore, playing very much against her sex kitten 
type, is effective.  </P>
<P>     It's difficult not to be impressed by what Allen has achieved with 
this film: successfully reviving the musical comedy in such a thoroughly 
delightful fashion.  The production may be uneven, but it's still 
wonderful to behold, even at the end, when the structure frays around 
the edges. Of course, the real force that makes EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU 
work is Allen himself.  As actor, director, and writer, he once again 
shows that he's willing to take chances.  And, in doing so, he gives us 
a movie that is recognizable as both "a Woody Allen film" and something 
refreshingly different.</P>
