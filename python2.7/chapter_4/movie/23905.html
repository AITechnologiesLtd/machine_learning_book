<P>_Winter_Sleepers_(Winterschläfer)_ *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>The poster blares "from the director of _Run_Lola_Run_," but anyone
looking specifically for such an adrenaline rush would be advised to stay
away.  There are smatterings of director Tom Tykwer's flashy _Lola_ style
in this slow, two-hour-plus drama: the pulsing techno score; some
bravura, highly kinetic shots.  For the most part, though, this is a film
not about forward momentum but stagnant meditation.  _Winter_Sleepers_,
which predates _Lola_ by a year, is one of those "people intersected by
chance" films, but its less-than-sprawling canvas of five
characters--three of whom are already linked as the film opens--and
snow-drenched, resort town setting should give one an idea of how plot
comes secondary to atmosphere.  In fact, one of the threads is  rather
mundane: a translator named Rebecca (Floriane Daniel) is involved with
ski instructor Marco (Heino Ferch), a womanizer.  Despite some good
performances, this familiar bit of business is a little tedious, and it
predictably does not stop 'til one of them wises up.</P>
<P>Far more involving are the other two storylines.  Rebecca's housemate
Laura (Marie-Lou Sellem), a nurse and aspiring actress, falls into a
quiet relationship with René (Ulrich Matthes), a movie projectionist. 
Laura doesn't know that he is tragically linked to a farmer named Theo
(Josef Bierbichler) and his dying young daughter, whom Laura cares for at
the hospital.  Then again, neither is René aware of any connection, for a
years-ago injury has done irreparable damage to his short-term memory; to
compensate, he constantly takes photographs of his surroundings.  The
Laura/René and René/Theo threads don't resolve themselves in an easily
predictable fashion, which is why they make a more lasting impression
than Rebecca/Marco.  Actually, if it weren't for them, _Winter_Sleepers_
would've been a picturesque and well-acted near-miss instead of the
unconventionally affecting film that it is.</P>
