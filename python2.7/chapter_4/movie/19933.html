<PRE>                            DETROIT ROCK CITY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Twenty years before Marilyn Manson put on ladies' makeup and
frightened the crap out of mothers around the nation, a little band
called KISS pioneered the idea, and played some good music as a bonus.</P>
<P>     While KISS was a few years before my rock & roll prime, they were
still quite popular when I was in school, and tales/rumors of Gene
Simmons' cow tongue, blood splitting, backwards-masked lyrics, and the
infamous `Knights In Satan's Service' moniker were the stuff of legend.</P>
<P>     Director Adam Rifkin would love to rekindle the KISS flame that we
all remember so well, but the movie doesn't quite live up to the
standards set by coming of age/adventure flicks like THE BREAKFAST CLUB
and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF.</P>
<P>     You gotta give them points for originality, though.  Following four
Cleveland kids and their desperate quest to reach Detroit in time for
the big KISS show, Rifkin (whose only recognizable credit is the Charlie
Sheen bomb THE CHASE) takes a few fun and unexpected turns in an
otherwise rote story that provide some great laughs.</P>
<P>     But really, this is an unabashed movie about KISS fans, for KISS
fans.  There's nothing wrong with that, but let me just say that
watching a film in a theater packed with aging hard rockers trying to
regain their youth through the cinema is one of the more trying
experiences a critic can go through.</P>
<P>     It's nice to see Furlong and HEAVENLY CREATURES' Melanie Lynskey
back on the big screen, but they've both done far better material
before.  Let's hope to see some more of that again soon.</P>
