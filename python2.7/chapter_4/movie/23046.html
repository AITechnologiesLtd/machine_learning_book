<P>The small northern island of Fara is finding the temperatures climbing
into extreme heat  conditions and getting hotter each day, even though
it is winter, which is usually freezing cold here, as it is on the
British mainland, which is undergoing its regular winter weather. A
secretive scientist, accused by the authorities of being a quack when he
reports to them of the strange happenings on the island, Dr. Hanson
(Lee), visits Fara and sets up a science lab in his room at the local
inn, The Swan. He collects specimens of the blood from some dead sheep
and sets up infra-red camera equipment to film unseen objects on the
countryside. He has a surly personality, which doesn't endear him to the
locals. But with all the strange happenings taking place: beer bottles
cracking in the heat, tempers flairing, cars overheating, sheep dying,
sweat stains growing on shirts, strange whirring noises, so intense that
it explodes a TV set and causes Bob Hayward (Heathcote) to go off the
road and fatally crash his car, there has become cause for alarm among
the locals and the scientist becomes looked upon as a savior.</P>
<P>Obviously, there must be a rational explanation for this phenomena, and
it is offered by Hanson to Jeff Callum (Patrick Allen), a writer and
owner of the inn Hanson is staying at, as he reluctantly tells Jeff that
they are being invaded by aliens.</P>
<P>Jeff has his own problems to deal with, which seemed very troubling just
a moment ago, as his new secretary has arrived, an attractive vixen,
Angela Roberts (Jane), who has her sexy fangs on the married writer, who
was once her lover, which made him feel very guilty, since he loves his
wife but can't resist Angela's curvaceous body. She has come on her own,
as he did not request her to be his secretary, in fact he tells her to
leave, but to no avail. Jeff's suspicious wife, Frankie (Sarah), is told
by the spiteful Angela that they knew each other before and that they
kissed as soon as she met Jeff on the island. Frankie sees them kissing
for herself and confronts Jeff, who can't seem to tell her the truth but
tells her that she is the only one he loves.</P>
<P>There is a level of flatness to the film, as it is not aided by its
feeble dialogue and uninteresting special effects, its incredulous tale,
and unexciting tone.</P>
<P>When it is finally decided the heat is caused by the aliens who are
starved for energy, that the aliens have materialized here the same way
satellite signals work and that they have come to this spot on earth
because of the local observatory sending out scanning signals to outer
space, which are interfering with them, it doesn't seem to help the
story out that there are no special effects to see these aliens.</P>
<P>Dr. Stone (Cushing) puts his life on the line to abet Hanson on his
theory, and pays the ultimate price, as he gets burnt to a crisp, coming
too close to the aliens and their terrific static noise, which drives
him mad until he burns to a crisp.</P>
<P>The plan to dynamite the aliens, whose hiding place is located by
Hanson, on the hilly road near the observation post, fails to kill them.
But he figures out, that the light attracts them, so everyone in town
who has been alerted to the problem, dims their lights and drives
without headlights. But all seems gloomy, because if they can't be
stopped here, they will surely go on and attack the mainland.</P>
<P>This was just not a good sci-fi film, but I've seen worse, much worse,
and somehow or other, this Hammer film was watchable, but barely so.
This film should be liked most by fans of either Christopher Lee or
Peter Cushing, who will most likely appreciate Lee's stylized
performance.</P>
