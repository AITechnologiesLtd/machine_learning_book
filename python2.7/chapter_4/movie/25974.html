<PRE>                              THE WATCHER
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     Keanu Reeves, get thee back to The Matrix as soon as possible.</PRE>
<P>     Following one of the most pitiful title sequences I've ever seen,
The Watcher actually proceeds to become one of the most pitiful
thrillers I've ever seen.  And that takes some doing... but let me tell
you how.</P>
<P>     I give the movie half a point for its mildly eyebrow-raising
premise.  An L.A. serial killer (Reeves) has finally worn down the cop
who was chasing him (James Spader) to the point where he can no longer
function in society.  The cop gives up on the chase after a dozen-plus
murders go unsolved, moves to Chicago, and tries to drop out of life
with his migraine medication.  Only the killer tracks him down, 2,000
miles away, and tries to revive their old cat-and-mouse game, by mailing
our hero a photograph of an anonymous and lovely young lady, sentencing
her to die in 24 hours if the cops can't track her down.  Surprise:
Witness some of the worst police work in movie history as the cops can't
track her down.  Rinse and repeat.</P>
<P>     Like I said, it's a semi-interesting premise once you get past the
fact that Nancy Drew could put these cops to shame.  But of course, it's
all ruined by shoddy acting and some just-plain-God-awful filmmaking
that is shameful in its incompetence.  Reeves is utterly wooden, as if
he is reading his lines from a TelePrompTer that's running too slow, and
with nary a "Whoa" to utter.  Spader is fine yet unimpressive.  And
Marisa Tomei -- starring as Spader's shrink and a would-be victim of the
killer -- has turned positively ghoulish now that she's reached
maturity.  (Note: She's supposed to be one of those "lovely young
ladies" I mentioned above.)</P>
<P>     But let's get down to the worst offendor.  Director Joe Charbanic
(absolutely no credits on record aside from a few crappy music videos)
has no business being behind a camera at all and should retire now
before someone gets hurt.  This is Film School 101 stuff, what with the
ridiculous use of blurred-motion video footage (you see, we're looking
through the killer's eyes!), the positive-negative-positive effect to
make things oh-so-creepy, sudden flashes of white light, and, well, more
blurred-motion video footage.  My cat could puke up a better film after
a diet of canned tuna and fur.</P>
<P>     Which reminds me: As a funny footnote to The Watcher, Keanu Reeves
has actually hired Charbanic to direct a music video or two for his band
Dogstar (which is reportedly quite awful).  My poor kitty may be spared
some work after all.</P>
