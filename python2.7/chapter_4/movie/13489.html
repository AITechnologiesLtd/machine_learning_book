SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **** (out of ****) 
DreamWorks SKG/Paramount / 2:48 / 1998 / R (extremely graphic war
violence/carnage, language)
Cast: Tom Hanks; Tom Sizemore; Edward Burns; Jeremy Davies; Matt Damon;
Barry Pepper; Adam Goldberg; Vin Diesel; Giovanni Ribisi; Ted Danson; Paul
Giamatti; Dennis Farina; Leland Orser; Harve Presnell 
Director: Steven Spielberg 
Screenplay: Robert Rodat <HR>Nothing, not even these words, is going to prepare you for the terrifying
sequence that opens Steven Spielberg's extraordinary World War II epic
"Saving Private Ryan." It is June 6th, 1944, and Allied troops have just
landed on the beaches of Normandy, France. Their invasion is at first
overpowered by the German opposition, and for the next 20 minutes, we
watch, sickened and unnerved, as these soldiers are intimately confronted
with the horrors of war. There is no musical score -- only gunshots,
explosions and death cries tear through the heavy air. Blood erupts from
all directions as men are fatally wounded before our very eyes in vivid
detail -- one bomb victim lays in the sand taking his final breaths, his
guts in a bloody pile beside him. This immediate sensory blitzkrieg stands
among the most riveting filmmaking ever done by any director, past or
present. Quite simply, so does everything that follows it. </P>
<P>While the wrenching intro is going to shock some of the more unassuming
audience members into sudden hysteria, it at least instantly announces
"Saving Private Ryan"'s agenda -- war isn't pretty, and Spielberg doesn't
waste any time pretending it is. Still, as extremely difficult as the
combat is to watch, it's just as hard to divert your concentration, thus
desensitizing viewers to the alarming horrors we will witness during the
next two-and-a-half hours. The movie demolishes the fine line between
observing and participating without any kind of preparation or warning;
the only way to capture the realism of violent battle is to drop you right
in the center of it, and this amazing film unapologetically does just
that. For those of us who have never experienced firsthand warfare,
"Saving Private Ryan" is very likely the closest that we'll ever get. </P>
<P>Part of the afore-mentioned D-Day attack is overseen by Captain John
Miller (Tom Hanks), a quiet, resourceful man whose heroism only distances
him from the serene life he lead before enlisting -- "With every man I
kill, the farther away from home I feel," he says. Though Miller's forces
are victorious at Normandy, their triumph does not come without a
staggering human cost. Among the lives lost at Omaha Beach are two
brothers, a third sibling of whom has also fallen, leaving a fourth who
might still be alive somewhere deep in French territory. When the
government learns that the boys' mother will be receiving a trio of death
notices on the same day, they assign Miller to lead seven soldiers on a
mission even more dangerous than what they have previously faced -- to
travel behind enemy lines and retrieve the remaining sibling, one Private
James Ryan, at any cost. But tragedy begets tragedy, and Miller's team
questions the significance of risking their collective necks just to
rescue a single person that might already be dead. </P>
<P>While it's perhaps unfair to compare "Saving Private Ryan" to a movie
like, say, "Armageddon," the association does in fact reveal a large part
of what's missing in film today -- genuine characters and stories that
make you care. While Armageddon's cast is composed of ciphers, some of
whom are killed off for obligation's sake, "Saving Private Ryan" boasts a
canvas of thoughtful, substantive individuals. When death is portrayed
here, you feel deep heartache and sorrow, not some sort of manufactured
sadness. Not surprisingly, Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat ("Fly
Away Home") never stoop to exploitation or manipulation when they portray
the casualties of war, and the result is an intensely exhilarating
experience unlike anything you've seen since "Schindler's List." That
connection isn't just being made because Spielberg directed "Schindler" --
these films are arguably the two most important motion pictures of this
decade. </P>
<P>Tom Hanks' performance is more moving than his Oscar-winning turns in
"Philadelphia" and "Forrest Gump" put together, and that's quite a feat
considering that John Miller isn't a very flashy role. But Hanks installs
emotional dignity in Miller's calm, commanding presence; when he finally
breaks down after an especially traumatic episode, you will too. With a
few exceptions like Tom Sizemore (as Hanks' devoted sergeant) and Matt
Damon (who shows up late in the game), the fine ensemble is made up of
mostly-unknown young actors. Giovanni Ribisi, a recurring guest star on
"Friends" (playing Lisa Kudrow's daffy brother), provides the film with
one of its most affecting moments, while Barry Pepper is striking as an
excellent marksman who prays as he picks off enemies. Jeremy Davies
("Spanking the Monkey") is the best of the bunch; perfectly cast as a
timid, violence-shy soldier recruited in the operation for his linguist
skills, he makes a powerful foil for the audience. Also strong are Adam
Goldberg, Vin Diesel and Edward Burns, the multi-talented guy behind "The
Brothers McMullen" and "She's the One." </P>
<P>With "Saving Private Ryan," Steven Spielberg has fashioned another
monumental tale about humanity and self-sacrifice among the horrors of
war. He's done the unthinkable, really, since this work is every bit as
profound as "Schindler," his uncontended masterpiece. If anyone criticizes
"Saving Private Ryan" as being "too violent," then they've sadly missed
the anti-war point. Even the quiet, meditative moments boil with the
threat of spontaneous carnage, all to create a film that transcends its
medium --thanks to Spielberg's potently graphic depictions of historical
bloodshed and Janusz Kaminski's gritty, you-are-there cinematography, you
don't just watch this movie, you live it. A guaranteed lock on 1998 top
tens, updated American Film Institute lists and Oscar ballots next March
-- yes, it's that unforgettable -- "Saving Private Ryan" is, in a word,
phenomenal.<HR>Copyright 1998 Jamie Peck

"Joe's Apartment' would be a very bad comedy even without the roaches, but
it would not be a disgusting one. No, wait: I take that back. Even without
the roaches, we would still have the subplot involving the pink
disinfectant urinal cakes." -- Roger Ebert on "Joe's Apartment"</P>
