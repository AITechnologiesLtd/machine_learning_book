<P>     "Deprogramming," as it's commonly called, gained notoriety in
relation to the religious cult movements of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.
As originally envisioned, the procedure went something like this:
deprogrammers kidnap a subject from a cult (typically at the request of
family members), bring them to a "safe house," then indoctrinate them
with anti-cult material until they renounce their recently-held beliefs
and return to "normal" society.</P>
<P>     DROP SQUAD adds a twist to the reasons behind, if not the process
of, deprogramming.  This time, it's not religious fanatics being
kidnapped, but African Americans who are seen as having either sold out
or turned their backs on the struggles of their race.  The DROP
(Deprogramming and Restoration of Pride) Squad was organized in the
1960s under the leadership of Rocky (Vondie Curtis-Hall) as a means by
which blacks having lost touch with their people could be reminded of
certain basic truths.  With the advent of the '90s, however, the
Squad's methods have become increasingly violent, and a fissure is
developing between the group's leaders, Rocky and Garvey (Ving Rhames),
about which method is better:  talk or abuse.</P>
<P>     To its credit, DROP SQUAD presents an effective case for the means
favored by those on both sides of the dispute.  Rocky believes that
enlightenment through violence goes against the tenants upon which the
DROP Squad was formed.  Garvey argues that drug dealers and their like
don't understand or respect anything except force.  Given the way
things develop, it's clear which side is winning the debate.</P>
<P>     The bulk of the story involves the kidnapping of Bruford Jamison
Jr.  (Eriq LaSalle) at the request of his sister (Nicole Powell), who
believes that he's gone over to the "enemy."  Her evidence:  Bruford
works at a white-owned advertising agency developing cynical and
demeaning commercials designed to sell cheap and potentially-
destructive products (such as Mumblin' Jack Malt Liquor and General
Otis Fried Chicken's "Gospel Pak") to blacks.  The DROP Squad takes the
job, kidnapping Bruford, tying him to a chair, and relentlessly abusing
him, both psychologically and physically, all in the name of
"enlightenment."</P>
<P>     While DROP SQUAD spends some of its screen time debating the means
by which the group attains their end, it hardly ever touches on the
issue of an individual's rights.  Considering that this fundamental
question lies at the heart of deprogramming, it's odd to find a film
whose only acknowledgement of the subject comes as a throwaway line.</P>
<P>     DROP SQUAD uses a dual approach of satire and melodrama.  Much of
Bruford's life is portrayed with an edge that often verges on open
parody--he is less an individual than a representation of those of his
race in corporate America who have become boot-lickers.  The depiction
of Bruford's condescending commercials (one of which includes a
self-deprecating appearance by executive producer Spike Lee) are
viciously on-target.  The accuracy and familiarity of what *should be*
ludicrous lampoons is startling.</P>
<P>     The film veers off course during the actual deprogramming
sequences, which look like something out of Oliver Stone's bloated
NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  Here, melodrama and odd camera angles (meant to
emphasize Bruford's disorientation) overwhelm the viewer.  The
heavy-handed sermonizing feels more like a force-feeding than something
willingly- consumed.</P>
<P>     Considering all the themes and issues brought to the screen in
DROP SQUAD, the conclusion is surprisingly open-ended.  There is no
catharsis.  In fact, there's not even a real sense of closure (a series
of captions just before the end credits unsuccessfully attempts to
remedy this).  Given its perspective on black pride and integrity, it's
impossible to dismiss what DROP SQUAD has to say.  On the other hand,
the method of telling leaves the viewer wondering as much--or
more--about those subjects that didn't make it to the screen as those
that did.</P>
