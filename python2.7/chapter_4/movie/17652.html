<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   When recently asked why I continue to bother with the mostly
   disappointing influx of recent teen films, I responded that I was
   looking for the next CLUELESS.  From its broad outline and sunny
   veneer, veteran TV sitcom director Gil Junger's feature film debut,
   10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, would appear to be a worthy successor but
   falls decidedly short of the mark.</P>
<P>   Like CLUELESS, which reworked the plot from Jane Austen's "Emma" and
   transported it into a modern high school setting, 10 THINGS I HATE
   ABOUT YOU is a liberal adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy "The Taming
   Of The Shrew" set in the teen scene of the 1990s.  Unlike the Amy
   Heckerling picture, which breezily redid Austen without drawing overt
   attention to itself, this picture not only winks at the Bard, but
   gives a full-out bow to its antecedent -- with characters named
   Stratford and Verona attending Padua High, dialogue excerpts lifted
   directly from his plays, sonnet writing and a peripheral character
   obsessed with Shakespeare, it's hard to miss the connection even if
   the picture's tagline wasn't "How do I loathe thee?  Let me count the
   ways."</P>
<P>   Using the play as a jumping point, the picture introduces Stratford
   sisters Katarina (Julia Stiles) and Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), whose
   attitudes towards the social scene are at polar extremes -- Bianca's
   bubbly and wildly popular, while tempestuous Kat is a hard-line
   feminist who's indifferent to peer acceptance.  Much to Bianca's
   dismay, both of them are forbidden to date by decree of their
   overprotective father (Larry Miller), who tweaks the longstanding
   rule at the beginning of the picture to allow her to date once her
   older sister finds a suitor as well.  "But she's a mutant!" Bianca
   cries.  "What if she *never* dates?"  Anxious to woo Bianca, two
   dueling suitors -- narcissistic model Joey (Andrew Keegan) and nice
   guy Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) -- embark on a scheme to set up
   the notoriously hostile Kat with a new boyfriend, and resort to the
   outlawish new bad boy in town, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger).</P>
<P>   The reworking of the story becomes rather creaky at times, and the
   teen film formula providing the support for this revised tale is
   glaringly apparent; to the beat, we can count on the requisite
   disposable party scene, the prom sequence, and the heartwrenching
   break-up and warm fuzzy reconciliation scenes to make their
   appearances; it's all inevitable material played in routine fashion.
   10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU also mildly suffers from being preceded by
   a few months by SHE'S ALL THAT, another teen film with a familiar,
   virtually identical plot (suitor is bribed to date unpopular heroine,
   with expected repercussions).</P>
<P>   The film is also rather slack in its setup.  While Kat's proudly
   nonconformist nature and disdain for the teen social sphere is
   wonderfully established in her wordless opening scene, the rest of
   the characters aren't particularly well-drawn before the mechanics of
   the plot kick into action.  In terms of its narrative, there's
   nothing remotely surprising in 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU -- all of
   the characters get their just desserts, even the goofy comic relief
   sidekick (David Krumholtz), so satisfaction with the storytelling
   lies solely with how engaging and sympathetic the players are drawn.
   The rebellious disposition of outsider Patrick is especially sketchy
   and unconvincing (rumours abound that he once ate a live duck sans
   beak and feet -- umm, sure), and that his misunderstood character is
   clearly a kind and gentle soul from the outset undermines interest in
   the early scenes of courtship between the supposed mismatched pair.</P>
<P>   Nonetheless, it's almost certainly the romantic angle between the two
   leads which carry the film, far moreso than the broad, scattershot
   and often juvenile comedy which typifies the remainder of the
   picture.  Stiles, who has the movie's plum role as the "shrewish" Kat
   and turns in a noteworthy performance brimming with intelligence, has
   nice chemistry with the likeable Ledger, and the relationship which
   emerges between their seemingly-disparate characters is entirely
   predictable yet appealing.  After setting the wheels in motion, the
   uncompelling romantic triangle involving Joey, Bianca and Cameron
   (whom the film gives misleading prominence at the outset) fades into
   the background as the volatile courtship between Kat and Patrick
   develops.  Also solid are the always-dependable Allison Janney in a
   glorified cameo as an unconcerned guidance counselor, and Daryl
   "Chill" Mitchell, who's very funny as the literature teacher
   exasperated with Kat's biting insights.</P>
<P>   The picture is also supported by a terrific, jubilant pop soundtrack
   dominated by songs from Letters To Cleo which imbues much energy into
   the aggressively-likable film.  It's also a nice (and somewhat
   disorienting) coup to feature an ensemble cast in a teen movie
   comprised largely of actual teen actors -- after watching endless
   groups of early- and even late-twentysomethings assuming these roles
   in other likeminded pictures, it's a refreshing bit of casting.  10
   THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU is a high-spirited, effervescent movie full
   of life which, while not quite as touching as it's meant to be nor
   nearly as funny as it ought to be (the outtakes during the credits
   are as amusing as anything in the film itself), is a pleasant, if
   totally forgettable, diversion.  CLUELESS, it ain't, though.</P>
