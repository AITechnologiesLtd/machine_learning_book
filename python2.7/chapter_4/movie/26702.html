THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Robert Redford's THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE, a "Zen And The Art Of 
Golfing" story, stars Will Smith as Bagger Vance, a mysterious and 
philosophical caddy, and Matt Damon as Rannulph Junuh, a washed-up, 
local golfing legend.  With Bagger's cheerful help, Junuh discovers "the 
authentic swing in each of us."  </P>
<P>Set in Savannah in 1928, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE is a disappointing 
but gorgeous film that features lavish period sets and appears to have 
been shot only in the glow of the rising or setting sun.  Its sweeping 
music tries to suggest epic proportions for a story that's badly lacking 
gravitas.  Incidents unfold unhurriedly.  The story moves along without 
much drive.  And Redford interrupts an already slow game to admire the 
local flora.  Just what golf needs, someone to slow it down.</P>
<P>The fictional story concerns a match between two real-life golfing 
greats, the effortlessly gifted Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and the 
flamboyant, ladies man Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill).  Along for the ride 
is a local golfing hero, Junuh, whose life was shattered by the war.  
After meeting Bagger, he reluctantly agrees to return to his game after 
10 years absence and become the third member of the match.  Putting up 
the $10,000 prize money is Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), Junuh's 
ex-girlfriend and owner of a nearly bankrupt golf course.</P>
<P>The problem with the production starts with the casting.  The 
over-narrated film features Jack Lemmon's flat and uninspiring 
voice-overs.  Theron, who has been quite good in films such as THE 
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, is way over her head and completely unconvincing as a 
manipulative Southern belle.  The minor actors playing Savannah's 
citizens ham it up with inflated Southern accents and exaggerated 
gestures.   J. Michael Moncrief, as Hardy Greaves, the story's 
ever-present kid, quickly goes from cute to annoyingly saccharine.  Matt 
Damon proves to be an acceptable but not an exciting choice as Junuh, 
giving us little reason to root for him.  The only actor who brings much 
to his part is Will Smith, whose performance provides the only credible 
argument to see the movie.</P>
<P>At its best, the movie can be funny and sweet.  "This is becoming 
embarrassing," Junuh confesses to Bagger after flubbing shot after shot 
on the first game of the big match.  "Oh naw, sir, it has been 
embarrassing for sometime now," Bagger says with a grin the size of a 
driver.</P>
<P>"The meaning of it all is: There is no meaning," Hagen tells Junuh about 
golf, life or both.  That about sums up the movie.  It's gorgeous and 
then it's over.  Even if Redford queues the heavenly choirs to sing when 
a ball approaches the green, he isn't able to escape the fact that what 
he has made is just a genre picture and nothing more.  He wants to imbue 
much meaning and spirituality to its message but never succeeds, no 
matter how earnestly he tries.</P>
<P>THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE runs a long 2:09.  It is rated PG-13 for some 
sexual content and would be fine for kids around 8 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, called the film, "nice."  He gave it ** 1/2 and 
said that he it too slow but had a good plot.  He mentioned that he 
liked the way that the narrator wasn't the main character.</P>
