<PRE>                                     SCREAM
                     A film review by David Landers
                      Copyright 1997 David Landers</PRE>
<P>RATING: *** out of **** - 7.5 out of 10.0
CAST: David Arquette (Dewey Riley), Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott), Courtney
Cox (Gale Weathers), Rose McGowan (Tatum Riley), Skeet Ulrich (Billy Loomis),
Drew Barrymore (Casey Becker)
DIRECTOR: Wes Craven
CERTIFICATION: R (USA) for excessive violence and language 
YEAR OF PRODUCTION: 1996</P>
<P>SCREAM is the present-day version of a horror film directed towards the
teenage audience.  And, like many of the same type of the past, it succeeded
greatly (a sequel began filming while it was still in theaters).  From horror
and thriller director-supreme Wes Craven, SCREAM is a tense, nail-biter of a
movie that, in the words of its director, "everyone really enjoys".</P>
<P>In my opinion, SCREAM is very similar to other works of Wes Craven (A
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET comes to mind first).  It is about, of course, a
bloodthirsty killer who is out to kill, more than anyone, teenagers.  The
killer will not stop at anything to kill the one person he is really after,
and like all other movies of its type, SCREAM plays this out very well.</P>
<P>The movie begins in the Becker household, where young Casey Becker (Drew
Barrymore) is preparing her favorite movie-watching snack, popcorn.  In the
middle of her preparation, the phone rings, and a very rough, cautious male
voice is on the other end.  At first, the caller seems rather calm and
friendly.  That is, until Casey mistakingly sets off a hidden inner rage in
the caller, who suddenly turns extremely violent.  He makes very serious,
frightening threats to Casey and continues to call after she repeatedly hangs
up.  The caller informs Casey that he wants her to play a game.  The game is
a very sick one indeed, in which Casey answers movie trivia questions.  If
she gets them wrong, the penalty is death.  If she answers correct, well, the
caller *says* he'll leave her alone.  Unfortunately for Casey, she never
escapes the killer alive.</P>
<P>The next day at, the small town is in shock.  The high school is crawling
with police officers and reporters, including the "tabloid twit" Gale
Weathers (Courtney Cox).  Gale Weathers is not liked at all by young Sidney
Prescott (Neve Campbell), for a very serious reason.  Gale was one of the
leading reporters in a murder controversy involving Sidney's mother, who was
brutally raped and murdered in her own home.  Gale continually insisted that
the accused killer was framed and that the real killer is still on the loose.
However, Sidney doesn't believe a word of this and certainly "has it in" for
Gale.</P>
<P>After the school day is over, the kids are basically still in shock, at least
for the most part.  Sidney, probably most cautious due to upcoming one-year
anniversary of her mother's death, does not want to be alone in the house.
Her father is on a business trip, so Sidney pleads with her friend Tatum
(Rose McGowan) to come over.  They agree that at seven o'clock Tatum will
come over.  Somehow, Sidney falls asleep.  She is awakened a little past
seven by the phone ringing.  It's Tatum, informing her that she will be there
very soon.  However, when the phone rings again, it isn't Tatum, but the same
guy who called Casey the night before, and supposedly attacked and killed
her.  Sidney, too, falls victim to the caller, but barely escapes.</P>
<P>After the attack, Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) shows up
quickly to comfort her.  However, when Sidney notices that he is dressed in
black (as was the attacker) and is carrying a cellular phone, she assumes the
worst.  Billy is arrested and held in jail, but later released because the
phone records show that he did not call her house.  Another interesting fact
is that Sidney's father is missing and cannot be found.  Dewey (David
Arquette), a town deputy and brother of Tatum, takes it upon himself to look
out for Sidney and to help find the killer.  However, it becomes unclear who
will find who first, as the killer stops at nothing to reach his apparent
prime target.</P>
<P>>From here, the terrorizing continues, and it looks rather obvious that it
won't cease until the killer is stopped - for good.  However, the killer's
identity is as yet unknown, and people can only assume.  The rest of the
events in the movie are equally as suspenseful, and the climax is very well
crafted.  If you are a fan of scary movies, as were most of the characters in
this film, then you should enjoy SCREAM.  And if you *really* enjoyed, fear
not, a sequel will be out before you can, well, scream!</P>
