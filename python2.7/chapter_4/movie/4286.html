<P>     Although it has been floating around film festival circuit for the
better part of five years, Ferid Boughedir's feature HALFAOUINE (named
after the small Tunisian town where it takes place), has finally
received U.S. distribution, albeit of the most limited kind (I believe
there's only one print).  However, while the film contains a few
memorable sequences, it's hardly worth the kind of intensive search that
will be necessary to uncover the nearest screening.</P>
<P>     Regardless of the culture in which a child grows up, adolescence is
always a confusing and difficult phase of the maturation process.  In
the Muslim lifestyle, where women's features are veiled and men assert
themselves as the "superior gender", the male's transition from boyhood
to manhood is all the more difficult.  At the age of 12, Noura (Selim
Boughedir) is regarded as neither a child nor an adult.  His growing
sexual curiosity has gotten him banned from the women's baths, where his
mother took him when he was younger, but he is not yet old enough to be
permitted to listen to discussions of "men's matters."  His sense of
isolation is profound.  His father (Mustapha Adouani) is emotionally
distant, yet warns him against closeness with his mother and aunt,
saying that "men don't hang around with women."  Noura's only real
companionship comes from a local libertine named Salih (Mohammed Driss),
who is the village's political outcast.</P>
<P>     HALFAOUINE is a coming-of-age story that, at its core, isn't much
different from similar narratives set in the United States.  Most of the
film deals with Noura's attempts to come to grips with his impending
adulthood, and sexual discovery is a large part of that growth.  Like
many boys his age, Noura is forever trying to sneak peeks at the female
body.  It's natural that in a society where women display little skin in
public that there is great curiosity about what lies under all the
clothing.</P>
<P>     Telling Noura's story isn't the movie's lone objective.  Openly
challenging religious traditions, the writer/director criticizes the
cultural schism that exists between the sexes.  As depicted in
HALFAOUINE, women are objectified in Muslim society, and it's the lack
of meaningful communication between husbands and wives that perpetuates
the cycle.  In addition to his social commentary, Ferid Boughedir paves
the streets of HALFAOUINE with a political subtext that is difficult for
an outsider to understand in anything but the broadest sense.</P>
<P>     HALFAOUINE contains interesting material, but a combination of
subpar acting and poorly-realized characters stains the fabric of the
production.  Aside from Noura, there isn't a well-scripted personality
in this film, and lead performer Selim Boughedir is not a naturally
gifted actor.  He seems to have two expressions:  a blank look and a
silly grin.  Because of Boughedir's limited range, Noura comes across as
emotionally stunted, which results in a picture that seems big on ideas
but small on heart.  HALFAOUINE is worth a look because of its
perspective of a different culture, not because it tells an engrossing
tale.</P>
