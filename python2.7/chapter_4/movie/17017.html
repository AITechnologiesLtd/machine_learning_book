<P> Cruel Intentions (1999) 3 stars out of 4. Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar,
Ryan Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair. Written and directed by
Roger Kumble.</P>
<P> Kathryn and Sebastian are bored, manipulative, mean-spirited children of
privilege.</P>
<P> The stepsibling tandem use people, playing games with their lives merely
to satisfy their own whims.</P>
<P> The latest venture of the high society Manhattan dastardly duo is a wager.
Can Sebastian seduce a young woman who, in a magazine article, claims that
she will remain a virgin until marriage.</P>
<P> The stakes? Sebastian's vintage auto vs., to put it delicately, fulfilling
his erotic fantasies concerning his stepsister. As Kathryn bluntly tells
him, "You can put it anywhere you like."</P>
<P> If all this sounds a bit sick, well, it is. But deliciously so. For "Cruel
Intentions" is a modern-dress adaptation of the classic novel "Les Liaisons
Dangereuses," which was adapted into a play by Christopher Hampton and
later filmed in 1988 as "Dangerous Liaisons" with Glenn Close, John
Malkovich, Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman. Another, lesser seen 1989
French-British production called "Valmont", starred Annette Benning, Colin
Firth and Meg Tilly.</P>
<P> And this contemporary version, written and directed by Roger Kumble, is
just as wickedly sardonic, witty and cruel as its predecessors.</P>
<P> Kathryn and Sebastian are as hedonistic as their earlier counterparts,
except they use more foul language.</P>
<P> What is interesting that despite the distasteful subject matter Cruel
Intentions is such a well-crafted, sarcastically humorous vehicle that you
can't help by admire it and Kumble's chutzpah.</P>
<P> And Kumble has done the unthinkable. He has transformed TV's "Buffy, the
Vampire Slayer" into a self-absorbed, manipulative, evil, first-class
bitch.</P>
<P> Yep, Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as the patrician Kathryn, the evil spider
who so skillfully weaves her webs of deceptions that no one can escape her
machinations.</P>
<P> Gellar is no girl next door. She is hot, sexual, downright dirty and
loving it. And she gives a strong performance, whether teasingly leading on
her stepbrother, or teaching a naive young girl how to French kiss.</P>
<P> Geller's Kathryn is despicable and like all fine movie villains totally
enthralling.</P>
<P> Ryan Phillippe as Sebastian easily makes the jump from an amoral predator
who enjoys deflowering young girls to sincere lover who is ensnared by the
charms of the innocent Annette (Pleasantville's Reese Witherspoon).</P>
<P> This could be Phillippe's break out role. It is a difficult transformation
from heel to hero, but Phillippe manages the task.</P>
<P> In a supporting role as the naive young girl used by Kathryn and
Sebastian, Selma Blair holds her own. She could be considered the comic
relief as the awkward young woman taught to grow up too quickly.</P>
<P> "Cruel Intentions" is not a pleasant movie, but it is a fun one. When
nastiness on the screen is done correctly, it can be entertaining. And
Kumble has delivered a fine combination. You may not like what you see, but
you will enjoy it.</P>
