<P>John Irving's novels are fat, have surprises and asides, can meander 
in interesting ways, and add fantasy to realism. Three have been made 
into films  : "The World According to Garp," (script by Steve 
Tesich);  "The Hotel New Hampshire," (script by Tony Richardson); and 
"Simon Burch" (adapted very freely from "A Prayer for Owen Meany" 
with a script by that film's director Mark Steven Johnson)</P>
<P>Irving has not been happy with the films, as he details in his "My 
Movie Business: A Memoir."  He took matters into his own hands by 
doing the scenario of "The Cider House Rules," a project for 13 
years. His script is only a smallish part of the novel, which has 
been pruned, cut, simplified and made into a most appealing, original 
movie. You have to see it in order to understand how its title-- a 
bit precious and esoteric perhaps-- works out. Were Irving starting 
from scratch, the film might have been simply called "Homer Wells."</P>
<P>It takes you swiftly from the 1920s (when Homer was born) to 1943-45 
the years of its major "action," although some hurried reviews make 
it begin in the 1930s. Michael Caine plays Wilbur Larch,  who 
apparently is not just the M.D. but the loving and beloved ruler of 
the St.Cloud's orphanage in Maine.</P>
<P>What once was probably a millionaire's rambling mansion at the end of 
an unpaved road, has been housing a number of parentless (or 
unwanted) children for years. There are not so many of them so that 
the building is cracking at the seams, yet for reasons not stated but 
easy to infer
( pedagogical, psychological, practical-- such as heating) the kids 
are concentrated in a large dormitory. It reminds one of "Zero for 
Conduct" or "Au Revoir les Enfants" more as a contrast than a 
similarity since the place is a loving, caring one. None of those 
aspects is spelled out in the classically lean script, but it does 
not have to be.</P>
<P>The oldest child --shown as a young man throughout most of the film 
--is a boy who was twice adopted and twice returned--for no valid 
reasons. He has been "baptized" Homer Wells by Dr. Larch. The 
surrogate father and son bond between Homer and Wilbur is a thing of 
beauty, not deja vu movie-formulaic, not gloppily sentimental, not 
artificially colorful. It is always touching and attention-holding.</P>
<P>As the senior orphan, quietly and efficiently, Homer has become the 
doctor's assistant to the point of having Larch say "I've taught him 
all I know." Like Larch, the young man loves the children and, in a 
sense, has become their teen-age father. The tiny staff (at least 
what we see of it) of the establishment is simply the doctor, Homer 
and two un-fussy, un-glamorous, dedicated nurses. Ther doctor and one 
of the women have a relationship.  so fleetingly and delicately shown 
that it warms you up.)</P>
<P>Homer can do anything the doctor does, except that he refuses to 
participate in abortions. These  are illegal. Larch is in some demand 
--by word of mouth, we suppose. He justifies performing performs them 
as an alternative to the women getting butchered up by back-street 
abortionists. Is it divine coincidence? The role that brought Michael 
Caine to prominence was that of Alfie in the eponymous story of an 
amoral  Cockney seducer who even arranges an abortion.</P>
<P>All this takes place in the first part of the movie. Toby Maguire and 
Michael Caine are superb  in  warmth, restraint,  as distinctive, not 
hammed up characters. Caine's long list of roles in dramas, action 
movies, comedies, psychological films, science-fiction, etc. etc. has 
included spies, con-men, professors, military heroes, spies, cops, 
gangsters, and everything else imaginable. His acting here may well 
be the jewel in his crown. His New England accent is excellent -- but 
just in case some people get picky, when answering a boy's questions 
about his past the doctor adds "before that I was an immigrant" 
"What's an immigrant?" says the child. "Someone who does not  live in 
Maine."</P>
<P>Maguire has an un-sonorous -even a tad raucous--voice, gives an 
almost minimalist performance, yet paradoxically he covers a wide 
emotional range  The children are terrific. They are not miserable; 
they are not Dickensian victims (in a clever touch they are read 
"David Copperfield" in installments); they are surrounded by 
affection. Yet they would all love to be adopted, to have a "real" 
family. A touching sequence where children try  to hook might-be 
parents with broad smiles is a gem.</P>
<P>America is in World War II. In a Ford convertible, Wally,  a young, 
volunteer lieutenant who flies the lethal Burma Run, drives up with 
his girl Candy. She's two-months pregnant. All goes well. Following 
the operation, Homer hitches a ride with the couple. He wants to 
experience the outside world. He's never seen the sea (in Maine!), a 
lobster, or a movie other than a beat-up print of "King Kong" that is 
projected to the children over and over. Or any girl of Candy's age 
and looks.</P>
<P>Wally gets him a job picking apples (hence the cider) on his mother's 
farm, not too far away, along with a group of black itinerant workers 
who show up at every season. And as his new friend Wally returns to 
the war in Asia, Homer finds in Candy (the daughter of a nearby 
lobster fisherman), a friendly guide. She teaches him how to drive; 
she shows him a drive-in theater; he sees his second movie 
("Wuthering Heights") which rather puzzles him: "It's no King Kong!")</P>
<P>The second part concentrates on Homer away from St. Cloud's, yet it 
does cut back to the orphanage, its happenings, its sorrows, Dr. 
Larch's strange, often funny maneuvers to fool the Board of Trustees 
and keep a kind of status quo. And meanwhile, back on the apple farm 
and the shores of the Atlantic things happen, things that will go 
even beyond a kind of coming-of-age for Homer. The first section was 
beautifully unrushed. The second picks up in speed but still without 
haste. It has some symmetries with the earlier sections, some 
predictable but fascinating nonetheless. The production and 
photography are of a high order that spreads out the Americana side 
of the story without making it "picturesque."</P>
<P>The choice of  Lasse Hallstrom as the director was  inspired. He is 
the Swede who made the near-classic  "My Life as a Dog" (Sweden, 
1985) and in the USA,  "Once Around"" What's Eating Gilbert Grape" 
and "Something to Talk About." His work,  character-driven, shows 
exceptional empathy for children and young people.</P>
<P>Even more than usual I am avoiding clueing in the readers to plot 
developments. Just see the movie. The late Francois Truffaut would 
have loved it. It matches almost uncannily his views of love, 
children, grown-ups who understand them, and adults doing the right 
thing and the wrong thing.</P>
