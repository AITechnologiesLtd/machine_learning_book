<P>
Commentary about The Sweet Hereafter has had as much to do with Atom
Egoyan as it has had to do with the film itself. Egoyan's career
trajectory has followed a trajectory, that is made explicit by his
latest film, from; small budgets to larger ones, family centered cast
to professional, specific- personal themes to universal-personal
etc...  This makes questions of changes in quality or level of his
work particularly important. The general consensus seems to be that
while the merits of the film are clear, the position to whcih Egoyan
seems to be going is questionable. I disagree.</P>
<P>Interestingly, the style here seems reminiscent of Egoyan's earlier
films. Next of Kin in particular comes to mind. The simpler
associative techniques, for instance, like the repeated tilts and pans
linking key characters and events in each film. At the same time there
are set pieces that convincingly demonstrate a new level of technical
mastery; the muted crash scene is the best example. This has come
about, in all likelihood, because of the fact that the scale of The
Sweet Hereafter dwarfs anything Egoyan has done to date. On this
basis, the film marks a new phase for the director. If one accepts
that this is the analog to Next of Kin, with respect to this second
phase, imagine the analog to The Adjuster...</P>
<P>After Exotica, the ante was raised and Egoyan has answered by making a
film on a fairly large scale, addressing complex themes, in a
responsible and challenging manner. Thematically, the film exposes the
inadequacies of one of soceity's most treasured symbolic languages:
the law. Specifically, in the face of issues such as community and
redistribution. Egoyan's critique is savage and embedded in an
intricate flashback structure that remains extremely clear throughout
the film. It would have been very easy for the strategy to end up
muddled, especially since the source material (Russell Banks' novel of
the same title) is said to be more linear.</P>
<P>Impatiently awaiting installment 2-1.</P>
