<P>I guess its women's lib… and now that I've gone and said that, all the women
liberals I know will hunt me down and kill me, so this may be my final
review. I guess its women's lib that's made this new version of Cinderella,
and I guess its women's lib that decided to put America's sweetheart who's
only good-roles-was-getting-hacked-in-"Scream" and rubbing noses with
aliens. And I'd also guess its women's lib that tried to make all under the
Hollywood blanket of pop-culture while retaining a complete stranglehold on
all of the balance that SHOULD be in the film. And it makes sense that it'd
be women's lib: after all, women are they're audience.</P>
<P>Yes, it's the latest trite little chick flick to hit the screen, set 500
years in the past yet still having a female main character who gets to
overshadow everybody, say all the good lines, give all the coy smiles,
deliver the punchlines, and endear herself to the audience of women who are
nestling their heads in the nearest barely awake man. Thus is my MOVIE
WARNING: DO NOT BE ALARMED IF YOU HEAR SNORES DURING THE COURSE OF THIS
FILM.</P>
<P>Although it clocks in at about 2 hours, it feels like 6. The story itself
takes a fairy tale that was bearable and makes it unbearable, drawing it out
further and further like a little hair before PLUCK it snaps, taking your
mind along with it. The fairy tale we all know: Cinderella. The twist we all
know: a Cinderella that can hit a moving target with an apple at ten years,
expertly fence, read classics, give a mean left hook and still have time to
check for dirt underneath her nails.</P>
<P>Girl's you have your little hero-girl of the month to look up to. Guys be
warned, this is a chick flick, bring your walkman, tune to the latest
Pirates game, sit back, close your eyes, and go to sleep. But guys: don't
forget your batteries.</P>
