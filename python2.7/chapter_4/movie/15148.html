<P>According to writer/director Edward Zwick, "The Siege" was intended as a 
cautionary tale that would show Americans that it can happen here; that 
given the right amount of fear and prejudice, coupled with blind trust in 
government, a police state could develop within our shores. The premise 
is certainly provocative and the film starts off strong, but sadly 
degenerates into a cartoonish open-air version of "Crimson Tide," with 
"Tide's" Denzel Washington going mano a mano with Bruce Willis instead of 
Gene Hackman. Even a bracing performance from Washington can't save a 
film that features a strutting action hero in a bad rug spouting tripe 
like "I AM the law!" The sluggish production is 116 minutes long, but 
feels like three hours.</P>
<P>When a group of Arab fanatics begin a series of strikes in the heart of 
New York City, FBI Terrorism Task Force chief Anthony Hubbard (Denzel 
Washington) is called into action. Following a false-alarm bomb threat 
and hostage situation, Washington encounters the real thing when 
terrorists blow up a Brooklyn bus, killing more than two dozen people 
(Washington, by the way, suffers only superficial injuries, despite his 
close proximity to the explosion).</P>
<P>As the investigation begins, Hubbard meets undercover National Security 
Agency operative Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), a Middle East specialist 
with excellent sources in the community. After the mandatory exchange of 
insults, the two band together to search for the men behind the nightmare.</P>
<P>The ringleader might be a sheik, whose abduction is shown in the film's 
opening scene. General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis) claims the 
government does not have the man in custody, but is he telling the truth? 
FBI sharpshooters kill three terrorist cell members hiding out in 
Brooklyn and believe the case is closed, but just as they celebrate their 
victory, a massive explosion at a Broadway theater kills dozens. The 
attacks escalate, building to a suicide assault on FBI headquarters that 
closely resembles the Oklahoma City massacre. </P>
<P>The president declares martial law, and in short order the streets are 
filled with tanks, as Devereaux's troops scoop up any adult Arab males 
they can find and corral them in detention camps. Watching ordinary 
citizens hauled away because of their race and witnessing Devereaux's 
increasing paranoia, Hubbard and Kraft begin to wonder who the real enemy 
is.</P>
<P>With more care, the story could have worked. Washington, a gifted actor 
who has difficulty playing villains, but shines when playing heroes, is 
at his best here, and Bening is good, even though her character's motives 
are maddeningly unclear. She talks like an incredibly sharp, informed 
operative, but often behaves like an infatuated schoolgirl dilettante. </P>
<P>There are no questions about the motives of General Devereaux, though. 
The character is straight from cookie-cutter central, and Bruce Willis 
adds no shading to the man, swaggering around barking terse, smug remarks 
as if he was hosting a Planet Hollywood opening. </P>
<P>Before the release of the film, Arab and Muslim groups complained about 
negative stereotyping. Zwick's film is careful to establish the 
terrorists as a small, unrepresentative group, but, for the most part,  
the production fails to depict Arabs as real people. FBI agent Frank 
Hadddad (Tony Shalhoub), an American of Arab descent, is allowed a few 
moments of actual human depth, especially when his son is throw into the 
detention camp, but the bulk of the Arabs remain faceless victims, 
waiting helplessly to be rescued. </P>
<P>As the film proceeds, its tone becomes increasingly cartoonish, building 
to a cornball climax with all the subtlety of a "Billy Jack" potboiler. 
What a drag. "The Siege" had potential. Had Zwick taken the time to 
develop well-drawn characters and a genuinely thoughtful script, he might 
have achieved his lofty ambitions, but in the end this grim exercise 
plays as just another stock action movie that leaves a bad taste in the 
mouth. </P>
