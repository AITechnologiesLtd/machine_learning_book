<PRE>                                 FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE
               A film review from The Maoist Internationalist Movement</PRE>
<PRE>REVISIONIST HISTORY AT ITS BEST</PRE>
<P>     This film chronicles the lives of two young boys (who become men)
from 1925-1977.  As children, the boys are forced to become theater
actors in a boarding school which resembles a boot camp.  They are in
training to join the so-called high culture of the Peking opera, which
the film lauds as beautiful.</P>
<P>     There is a current of homosexual tension in the relationship
between the two men.  Douzi, the man who plays the female role in their
rendition of "Concubine," falls in love with his partner, Shitou.
Shitou does not return his feelings, and later marries a prostitute
(played by Gong Li from RAISE THE RED LANTERN) whom Douzi deeply
resents.  It is in part because of the gay love that this movie was
initially banned in China. (1)</P>
<P>     Further reasons for the initial (and current) censorship of
FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE include the portrayals of suicide and political
dissent. (2)  But the most interesting part of the movie is its
portrayal of gender--exploring the way that gender is constructed and
privileged.  Douzi is not simply a man in love with another man.  As
the line between his opera character and his real life is blurred, he
is also at the same time a woman (the concubine) in love with a man
(the king).</P>
<P>     On the more reactionary side, the movie includes scenes from the
Cultural Revolution, in which the masses randomly denounce their
friends, wives, and family, but do not engage in political struggle to
try to reform the rich actors or ex-prostitutes.  The only scenes of
the Cultural Revolution are chaotic and destructive.  There is no
indication that any positive change occurred during that time period at
all.</P>
<P>     The director, Chen Kaige, was 14 in 1966 when he "wrongly"
denounced his father.  He later regretted his "betrayal" and when he
became a big movie director, he let his father work for him on the
movie sets. (3)</P>
<P>     Director Chen Kaige, on his American tour promoting the movie,
denounces Communism and the Cultural Revolution as evil. (3)   "When I
was a junior in high school, we believed in a very beautiful world ...
we heard a lot of good things about communism...  I didn't realize that
was the wrong thing to do." (3)</P>
<P>     While MIM has publicly accepted responsibility for its support of
Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, even with what did go wrong during
the Cultural Revolution, FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE does no justice to the
positive steps taken at that time, including the steps taken to erase
the distinction between high and low culture.  Chen Kaige's
self-interest in promoting his movie, as well as passing it by the
reactionary Deng-regime censors, means that he "forgets" to show his
viewers the real political struggle of the Cultural Revolution.</P>
