<P>PLOT:
Four criminals hold up an armored truck during its exit of a
"soon-to-be-flooded" town. Unfortunately for them, one of the drivers
escapes into the town with the dough, and turns the empty town's water
filled streets, into a cat-and-mouse playground between the bad guys,
himself and the local sheriff and crew.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Popcorn Movie (definition): A movie which based on its merits of proper
story-telling techniques, unique style and believable characters, would fail
on all counts. A Popcorn Movie is a film that allows you to turn off your
brain before viewing, crunch down on plenty of nachos and popcorn without
having to worry about missing any relevant dialogue, and revel in its lunacy
of plot, excessive action sequences and shallow objectives. It is NOT a film
to take seriously. With depth of character non-existent, this type of film
allows you to enjoy the unemotional attachment to each person in the movie,
and soak in only its relevant goals of fun, divertissement and campy fodder.
With checks on all counts above, this kind of movie generally doesn't score
more than a respectable 7/10 (ARMAGEDDON topped 8/10 because it actually
managed to add some emotional attachment to some of its characters...a no-no
in "pure popcorn" film), but does provide some brainless entertainment to
all those looking for a quick fix of empty amusement.</P>
<P>Originally titled THE FLOOD, this movie is packed with superficial
characters (save Freeman who pulls off some three-dimension), endless chases
and gunfights, plenty of rain, water and more rain, and enough cheezy
dialogue and plot holes to make any other "Popcorn Movie" candidate beet-red
jealous. All in all, a wonderful representation of a Popcorn Movie done
right, with an extra nod to the editors who managed to keep this puppy timed
to the perfect length of any ideal Popcorn Movie...90 minutes. Bravo to all
involved!</P>
