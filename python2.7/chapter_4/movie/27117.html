<PRE>                                GENGHIS BLUES
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<PRE>        Gosh, I had to be dragged kicking and screaming to see this film.</PRE>
<P>        Here's the premise: Filmmakers accompany a blind blues musician to the
small country of Tuva, just north of Mongolia, to participate in the
1995 throat-singing symposium in Kyzyl.  My roommate passionately
rhapsodized over it for days, yet nothing about this premise connected
with me.  "Lemme tell you something, pal -- I'd rather watch mute nuns
performing The Sound of Music than watch these guys do their... their...
their crazy throat-singing ritual!"</P>
<P>        Just goes to show, you can't judge a book by its cover.  Boy, did I
feel silly when I actually sat down to watch Genghis Blues, one of the
more exhilarating and passionate documentaries about music and culture
to appear in recent years.  Who would have thought I'd actually love
this music and want to learn more about it?</P>
<P>        There are too many layers of Genghis Blues to discuss within the
context of a review.  And unfortunately, the act of describing the
adventures of our filmmaking team and their companion, Paul Pena (blind,
mouthy, and sharp as a whip) might strike readers as, well, boring.</P>
<P>        Who would think that you could get excited about these characters
packing for their long trip east, riding in planes, buses, and cars for
thousands of miles through the desert?  Or that the history of this
small country would prove exciting?</P>
<P>        You wouldn't expect the musical performers who gather at this event to
cause the average viewer (me) to sit bolt upright on the couch, mouth
agape in amazement, as they sang notes which seemed like the distant
rumblings of an underground cave or an impossibly beautiful wood
instrument.  The experience was beautiful and strange.</P>
<P>        This is no stodgy, academic National Geographic special.  The people of
Tuva are lively and buoyant, pleased, and excited that the American,
Pena, would take such an interest in their art of throat singing, which
allows them to voice more than one note at the same time.  Pena is also
familiar with their vivid, colorful garb and language, long banned by
the Communists.</P>
<P>        And he's blind.  He learned it all by translating from Tuvan to Russian
to English, in Braille!  Rocky Balboa, you're a stinking chump.  You
ain't nothing!</P>
<P>        The story is inherently dramatic.  This is Pena's first time in this
country, whose customs he has studied so passionately.  As a participant
in their competition, he's under enormous pressure created by his own
fear.  Right before he goes on, he's in the midst of paralyzing stage
fright (which multiplies itself by a thousand when he's told that he
cannot perform the song he had prepared, as some of the audience would
be offended).</P>
<P>        Paul and the filmmakers also journey through the land, meeting shamans
and wrestlers.  They take part in a goat slaughtering ceremony and bless
themselves in the water of sacred rivers.  While the filmmaking is
rough, sometimes choppily cut together, you can't beat the beautiful
landscapes or the appreciation that shines through Pena's face.  This
American has found his spiritual home.</P>
<P>        Genghis Blues doesn't make Paul into a saint.  As a blind man, he's
often confused and disoriented, battling bouts of self-doubt and
depression.  It's heartbreaking to learn that in America the farthest he
can walk alone is the corner store, that he often feels alienated or
misunderstood as though he were some freak.  And when some of his
medication runs out, they may need to cut short their trip to Tuva, so
Genghis Blues, for all its fascination with exploring new sights and
sounds, is not without tears.</P>
<P>        Saddest of all, an artist like Paul Pena can only find acceptance in a
foreign land that doesn't look at his craft with confusion and
misunderstanding.  If Genghis Blues accomplishes anything, it makes
Pena's world accessible to folks like me who might not give a damn, were
they not led to the stream and asked to drink.</P>
