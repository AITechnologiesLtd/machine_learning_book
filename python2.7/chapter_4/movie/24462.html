<P>         Reputations can be deceptive. For example, director Scott
Winant and writer Winnie Holzman are best known for their involvement
in TV's ``thirtysomething'' and ``My So-Called Life,'' two shows that
addressed real-life concerns without sitcom moralizing and phoney
happy endings.</P>
<P>  It's now trendy to laugh at the ``yuppie angst'' of
``thirtysomething,'' but take another look and you'll find a
consistently well-written series.  The short-lived, much-loved
``Life'' (which introduced the miracle that has become Claire Danes)
was even better, offering the most credible look at teen-age life of
any show since ``Family'' in the late '70s.</P>
<P>  But ``'Til There Was You,'' which Winant directed and
Holzman wrote, is pure plastic, flat and transparent. All involved
were all too obviously aiming for another ``Sleepless In Seattle,''
but what they've produced is a cinematic siesta. The honesty of the
duo's TV work is gone, replaced by a synthetic airy-fairy atmosphere
that quickly becomes stifling.</P>
<P>  Holzman's meandering screenplay revolves around architect
Nick (Dylan McDermott) and ghostwriter Gwen (Jeanne Tripplehorn),
who've separately led parallel lives, destined to intersect.</P>
<P>  Both Nick and Gwen do work that goes unappreciated. Nick's
grandiose visions of design, such as putting a rooftop garden atop a
homeless shelter, don't suit his firm. Gwen, a scribe for illiterate
celebrities, realizes, ``I never put my name on anything I write.''
Each of them has also amassed a resume of lovers without finding much
fulfillment.</P>
<P>  They also have nicotine addiction in common, and so many
cigarettes are consumed during this movie you may want to burn incense
and set out dishes of vinegar. It may be Holzman's idea of retro-chic;
most people will find it contempo-disgusting.</P>
<P>  The magnet that will eventually draw Nick and Gwen together
turns out to be Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker), a burnt-out
former child star trying to reheat what's left of her legend by
publishing her memoirs.  Once an adorable moppet on TV's popular ``One
Big, Happy,'' Francesca is now a salty-tongued veteran of numerous
rehab clinics. ``Yes, it's me and no, I'm not dead,'' she says when
greeting fans.</P>
<P>  Nick meets her when Francesca sells the apartment complex
she owns to a developer, and the predatory actress soon has him under
her spell. Gwen is hired by Francesca when the would-be autobiographer
decides to let someone else do the job. Thanks to a string of
coincidences, Nick and Gwen manage to avoid meeting, even though it's
obvious that two people as dull as they are certainly deserve each
other.</P>
<P>  Tripplehorn and McDermott are badly miscast. Tripplehorn's
attempts at slapstick are embarrassing, while McDermott's sullen
intensity is completely wrong for this kind of fluff.</P>
<P>  The only joy in the film comes from Parker, so delightfully
sweet in the recent Broadway revival of ``Once Upon a Mattress,'' and
so deliciously sour here as the jaded Francesca. The acid Parker
injects into comments like ``this is extremely non-enjoyable'' is a
welcome antidote to Holzman's syrup.</P>
<P>  The rest of the supporting cast does what they can with what
they're given, which is generally not much. As Gwen's lifelong friend,
Jennifer Aniston begins building an interesting character, only to
disappear abruptly from the story.</P>
<P>  Michael Tucker, playing Gwen's deceptive dad, contributes
the film's brightest scene, when he confesses the truth about his
marriage to Gwen's mother. Tucker and Tripplehorn strike sparks, and
for a brief moment ``'Til There Was You'' soars above the humdrum and
approaches hilarity. But with Tucker's exit, the movie clunks back to
earth and dawdles along to its surprise-free finale.</P>
