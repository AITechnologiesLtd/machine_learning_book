<PRE>THE WEDDING SINGER</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Caroline --</PRE>
<P>        I cringed when I first saw the trailer for "The Wedding
Singer." Uh-oh. Another Adam Sandler movie, I thought. I didn't
remember the statue of limitations running out after "Billy Madison"
and "Happy Gilmore."</P>
<P>        Enter Drew Barrymore and imagine my shock when Sandler capably
handles his first-time role as a romantic lead, Robbie, the ex-rocker
turned jilted guy in the title role. It took a while, but Sandler and
writer Tim Herlihy have discovered that Sandler doesn't have to scream
and be obnoxious all the time to elicit a few laughs.</P>
<P>        Barrymore saves the day proving she can play cheerleader cute
instead of bad girl hussy. Barrymore is just what Sandler's previous
films needed. An engaging co-star to keep us distracted from Sandler's
periodic, uncomfortable-to-watch rants.</P>
<P>        Set in 1985, "The Wedding Singer" is Sandler's best
film. That's not saying much, I know, but finally we have a period
comedy for Gen X even my Phillip Michael Thomas-loving friends can
enjoy. The film overdoes the 80s comedy a bit with jokes about
"Dynasty" and Rubik's Cube, but you've got to admire any movie that
includes scenes with such classics as Nina's "99 Luftballoons" and
Kajagoogoo's "Too Shy."</P>
<P>        Was I really listening to Frankie Goes to Hollywood my
freshman year in college? I must be dreaming.</P>
<P>        The constant retro 80s tunes is supposed to sell soundtracks,
but director Frank Coraci manages to keep his main aim in mind -- the
chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore. They are refreshing.</P>
<P>          Sandler's Robbie is a smooth-talking, hopeless romantic
looking forward to his wedding with punker Linda (Angela
Featherstone), his long-time girlfriend. He meets Julia (Barrymore) a
new waitress at the banquet hall, who is also engaged and looking
forward to her wedding to long-time boyfriend Glenn (Matthew Glave).</P>
<P>        Robbie's life turns to shambles when Linda is a no-show at
their wedding. Julia helps pick up the pieces.</P>
<P>        The film is sprinkled with cameos from Sandler's former
"Saturday Night Live" cohorts such as Jon Lovitz and Kevin
Nealon. Billy Idol steals one scene playing himself.</P>
<P>        "The Wedding Singer" is a wonderful reversal of fortune for
Barrymore, who has appeared in a string of bad movies as the dangerous
femme fatale, such as "Poison Ivy," "Guncrazy," "Bad Girls" and "Mad
Love." Barrymore's Julia is perky, smart and level-headed. For a
change, Barrymore plays the kind of girl you'd want to bring home to
mom as long as Barrymore manages to hide her six tattoos, none of
which are revealed in the film.</P>
<P>           Julia is the loveable babysitter type Barrymore would have
played in "Scream," had she lived longer than the film's first 10
minutes.</P>
<P>        Here's to more of Barrymore in the future, and I'm not talking
about flashing herself to David Letterman.</P>
<PRE>        Rating: Three stars.</PRE>
