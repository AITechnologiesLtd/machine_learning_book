<PRE>                                     CLERKS
                       A film review by Jules N. Binoculas
                        Copyright 1994 Jules N. Binoculas</PRE>
<P>     Ever plan for a day off from a low-paying, dead-end job--and get
a call to come to work for half-a-day--and end up staying all day, to
be hassled by a steady stream of local weirdos--all because you just
can't say no to anyone?</P>
<P>     Ever wish you could stop complaining, but can't find the
time--because you're back-logged with your old complaints?</P>
<P>     Ever be so bored that you ask your girlfriend about her past
sex-life and find out she's given oral performances on more organs than
you could count in a suburban shopping mall?</P>
<PRE>     Ever have a friend take over for an hour and end up costing you
more than you make in a month?</PRE>
<P>     Ever imagine Estragon and Vladimir--from Samuel Beckett's
existential play, WAITING FOR GODOT--living in New Jersey, doing
penance with perverts, wasteoids, and involuntary necrophiles?</P>
<P>     If so, punch your clock, and spend an entertainingly annoying day
with Dante Hicks: convenience-store operative, sans elegance.  Help
him out--his producer-writer-director could use the business!</P>
<P>     After KEVIN SMITH, an East-coast-twenty-something-retail-factotum,
saw the low-budget film, SLACKER--he decided to immortalize his own
phlegmatic lifestyle on 16mm film.  Why?  That's all he could afford!
And why not?  It beats working for a living!</P>
<P>     CLERKS starts off on a gray morning--like a pillow filled with
rocks--and takes its time before strange dream-like sequences and
eccentric losers begin to define themselves and amuse us.</P>
<P>     Once we're fully awakened, we realize that all the unusual
suspects have been rounded up--and aren't going anywhere in
particular.  By then it's about time to go home.</P>
<PRE>     Spending a few hours watching other people work is serious
business.</PRE>
<P>     Like CLERKS' anti-heroes--we laugh, we're horrified, bored,
can't wait to leave, but end up having a little fun--wondering if
we'll be summoned for a sequel.</P>
<P>     What the film lacks in polish, it delivers with enthused,
rough-and-ready charm.  Most scenes look like they were photographed
through the bottom of a soda bottle (painted black-and-white).  The
actors seem like people you'd meet on a bus--on the way to a speech
pathology lab.  Since the budget precluded fancy locations, the
audience is given an uncensored, not-so-guided metaphysical tour of
sometime-collegiate male psyches.  The humor is partially-effective,
diarrhetically snappy, mostly-misogynistic, pseudo-educated schtick.
Imagine Groucho and Chico Marx with a hormone imbalance--before they
got rich.</P>
<P>     Yet, for all its solipsitic frivolity, the film delivers a
poignant philosophical message: you would be what you pretend you could
be, if only you could gather the courage to pretend you should be
something you're not.  And if not, there's always tomorrow--if you
don't have plans.</P>
<PRE>        RATING: 88/100 </PRE>
<PRE>.
