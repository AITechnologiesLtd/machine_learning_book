<P>Have you ever been out in public and encountered somebody who knows you, yet
you don't have a clue who the heck they are?  You know, you just play along
until, hopefully, they go away?  That's the basic gist of the new French
thriller, Harry, He's Here to Help.  It's creepy and unnerving when
contrasted with Hannibal's campy gore,</P>
<P>Harry begins with a scene that could be a flashback to every awful family
car trip you've ever been on, meaning it's hot, cramped and there's a whole
lot of yelling and bickering.  In a rest stop men's room, Michel (Laurent
Lucas) notices a man grinning at him as he enjoys a few moments of relief
from the long, sweaty trip to his family's rundown vacation home.  The man
introduces himself as Harry Balestrero (Sergi López, An Affair of Love), a
former grade-school classmate that Michel just can't remember.  After
rattling off the names of a few of their mutual classmates, Michel becomes
convinced he knows Harry, and the two men shake hands and head for their
cars.</P>
<P>In the parking lot, Harry and his curvy girlfriend Prune (Sophie Guillemin)
offer to take Michel and his wife Claire (Mathilde Seigner, Venus Beauty
Institute) out for drinks.  Michel and Claire decline, as their three young
daughters are just too worn out, but since their well-to-do counterparts
seem to be aimlessly wandering around Europe with no time constraints, the
two couples decide to meet at Michel's fixer-upper.</P>
<P>After they've had a few drinks, Harry brings up the topic of poetry and
astonishes his hosts by reciting, word for word, a poem called "The Dagger
in the Skin of Night" that Michel wrote as a child.  As if that weren't
enough, he begins to narrate passages from the first chapter of a novel
(called "Flying Monkeys") that Michel abandoned as an elementary school
writer.  Michel and Claire are taken aback, but since Harry seems to be a
nice, honest man, they seem to brush the incident aside.</P>
<P>Long story short, Harry begins to act more and more strangely, buying Michel
and Claire a brand-new SUV and partaking in some bizarre post-coital eating
rituals as he slowly worms his way into their lives.  He's a cross between a
slightly more bent Tom Ripley (as in The Talented Mr.) and a much more
intelligent Buck (as in Chuck and).  Harry is a film that could be set
anywhere and feature any kind of protagonist, but it works so much better
when you introduce a malevolent character into the life of a young, married
couple (kids optional) at just the right time, and watch the sparks fly (a
la Pacific Heights).  López is great as Harry, exuding the same silent type
of lunacy that Bob Hoskins perfected in Felicia's Journey.  Lucas and
Seigner are both very likeable, thereby doing their jobs in creating
characters that viewers can root for.</P>
<P>To say Harry is Hitchcockian might be the understatement of the year.
Harry's character gets its name from two of Hitch's '50s flicks - The
Trouble With Harry and The Wrong Man, where Henry Fonda played Manny
Balestrero. The story brings to mind another '50s classic from Hitchcock -
Strangers on a Train, which was based on a novel written by Patricia
Highsmith.  She also penned Ripley, so it comes as no surprise that Harry,
Ripley and Strangers' Bruno Antony are all smooth, charming sociopaths that
immediately rub you the wrong way despite not doing anything to warrant such
feelings (and their names all end in the letter "y," so you know the Puffy
jury really blew it).</P>
<P>Writer/director Dominik Moll, who, together with Criminal Lovers' François
Ozon, has made France the new creepy capital of the world (well, second to
that rest stop I just visited in Lodi, Ohio), has fashioned an outstanding
second feature after working as an assistant director on Laurent Cantet's
Human Resources.  The brightly photographed Harry also shares a
cinematographer (Matthieu Poirot-Delpech) and co-writer (Gilles Marchand)
with the drab but entertaining Resources.  López, Moll and the film's
editing (by The Dreamlife of Angels' Yannick Kergoat) and sound all won
César Awards (the film was nominated in just about every other category, as
well).</P>
<P>1:55 - R for language, some violence and a scene of nudity</P>
