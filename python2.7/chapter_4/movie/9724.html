                          NOTHING TO LOSE 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                   3 :-( :-( :-(  for nothing to gain</PRE>
<P>Cast: Tim Robbins, Martin Lawrence, John C. McGinley, Giancarlo
Esposito, Kelly Preston, Michael McKean Director: Steve Oedekerk
Screenplay: Steve Oedekerk</P>
<P>The humour in this movie is mostly derived from a clash of personalities
and different walks of life. Advertising executive Nick Beame (Tim
Robbins) has a pefect wife, a perfect job and a perfect life until he
walks into his bedroom to find his wife in bed with the boss. From this
point on his life takes a spiral downhill, as does the movie.</P>
<P>This man has lost the will to live and begins a series of
self-destructive tendencies as an out let for his anger and frustration.
Enter petty thief Terrence (Martin Lawrence) who gets dragged into the
grand scheme of reckless driving, petrol station hold-ups, rival villain
shoot-outs, robbing the boss and cutting the manhood of a fertility god.</P>
<P>I have always admired Robbins versatility in any role he plays, but he
has chosen something meaningless and forgettable in the character Nick
Beame. You'll be kicking yourself in the end when you realise the entire
fiasco was a mere accident of mistaken identities. It really doesn't get
more stupid than when you mistake your sister-in-law for your wife in
bed.</P>
<P>Martin Lawrence is a relative new comer to film. His annoying antics,
constant whining and endless nagging is reminiscent of nails scratching
the black board. If his career is to be based on this show of hysteria,
it may not be a long one. Especially where there are those on the market
who do it better and get away with it - namely the Murphys and Carries.</P>
<P>This is an absurd tale about losing all hope when you catch your wife
cheating. It basically states that everything else is meaningless
without her in your life. It's a sad philosophy and concept to carry
through life when per chance anyone could suddenly die or leave you.
Sure there's nothing more to lose when the thing you cherish most
disappears, but there is also nothing to gain by trying to destroy
yourself. Perhaps there will be a note of remorse from others when
you're dead, a black coffin that matches your suit, a homely Wake and a
touching quote from Ecclesiastes 3:20, but one has to realise that life
goes on after you're gone. The world does not stop revolving just
because you have decided to jump of the merry go round.</P>
