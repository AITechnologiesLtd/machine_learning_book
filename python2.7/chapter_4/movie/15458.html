<PRE>Review: Elizabeth</PRE>
<P>Starring: Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joeseph Fiennes, Christopher
Eccleston and Richard Attenborough</P>
<PRE>Directed by Shekhar Kapur</PRE>
<PRE>Approx running time 130 min</PRE>
<P>Though it is a fine piece of filmmaking, there's something about
Elizabeth...that left me a bit cold, and I think it is something that
bugs me quite often in films, particularly these days; I just didn't
care about the characters. To me, the first and foremost job of a
filmmaker is to create characters (be they imagined or historical as
the case may be) that the audience gives a hoot about. And though
Elizabeth works well on many levels, it falls short of excellence
because of that very reason.</P>
<P>Elizabeth takes place in England in 1554, as Queen Mary, half sister
of Elizabeth and a monarch on the side of Catholicism is dying. Before
she dies, though, she cannot bear to sign a document which would
condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical Protestant
beliefs. As a result, amidst much anger within the council, Elizabeth
becomes the Queen of England. The film chronicles her rise to power as
she fights for a unified Church of England and tries to bring order to
her personal and political life.</P>
<P>Much of the film deals with Elizabeth's love for Lord Robert, a
mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he
continues to proclaim his love for the queen. There is much ado about
her lack of a husband, and political pressures from Spain and France
enter into the equation. The problem with the film lies with this as
its centerpiece, as love interests are such a character driven
element. I didn't much care about the characters (perhaps aside for
Elizabeth who is played quite well by Blanchett) and so I didn't have
much interest in who would join her in her nuptials. The cast is
rounded out well with the marvelous Rush who plays the queen's most
loyal advisor, Sir Francis, and Attenborough as a well-meaning but
old-fashioned lead council.</P>
<P>Why then, you must be asking, do I recommend Elizabeth? Simply because
it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and
cinematographer. Kapur and his cinematographer Remi Adefarasin
(neither of whom I have heard) create a beautifully realized piece of
filmmkaing from the technical side. The light streams through each
frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the
realistic light sources that would have been found in churches,
cellars and castles in 16th century Europe. Each frame is rich with
color contrasted with blackness or blown-out white light from
windows. The costumes by Alexandra Byrne deserve a mention as they are
such an inportant aspect of each shot. Indeed, Elizabeth is one of the
most visually beautiful films of the decade, ranking with Kundun and
Braveheart. Watch also for the incredibly "Godfather-esque" mass
murder scene. It made me think in retrospect of the similarities
between the two films.</P>
