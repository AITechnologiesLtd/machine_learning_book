<PRE>                                WAYNE'S WORLD
                       A film review by Mark Santora
                        Copyright 1992 Mark Santora</PRE>
<P>     Tonight I got a chance to see an advance screening of WAYNE'S
WORLD.   Based on the sometimes comical skit on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, I
had mixed feelings going into this film.  But, two minutes into the
film, I was laughing my ass off.  This film is really funny.</P>
<P>     Quick Summary:  Wayne has a public access television show he runs
from his basement.  Garth is is best friend and sidekick on the show.
The show is really popular in their small town.  A big time producer
(Rob Lowe) sees the show.  He decides to buy the show and make it more
commercial.  By the way, Rob Lowe is the "bad" guy in this film, but you
knew that already I'm sure.</P>
<P>     Both Wayne and Garth address the camera directly.  They do it
really well too.  Fortunately they don't overuse this and allow a small
story to develop around the characters.  They also take time out to poke
fun at everyone.  Reebok, Pizza Hut, Nuprin, ... nobody is too far away
to attack.   But they do it smartly and do not insult the audience's
intelligence.</P>
<P>     Along the way, Wayne falls in love with a female rock singer.  Rob
Lowe attempts to steal her away.  This leads to a scene with Alice
Cooper as they sir around and discuss the philosophy of the town of
Milwaukee.   And while in Milwaukee, they don't forget to pay tribute to
the two most famous people in Milwaukee, Laverene and Shirley.  These
scenes are really great.  There is also a great scene where Wayne,
Garth, and their three crew members are driving down the street singing
"Bohemian Rhapsody."  It is really good.</P>
<P>     I don't want to give anything away, which is why I am being so
vague.   What I will say is that you should look for cameos by Ione Sky,
Robert Patrick (grin), Ed O'Neil, and Chris Farley.  They all play
interesting roles.</P>
<P>     How would I rate this movie?  It is really funny.  It is just the
type of mindless humor that is what makes films fun.  Don't expect to
see any Oscar nominations, even though they even poke fun at that, just
expect a good time.</P>
