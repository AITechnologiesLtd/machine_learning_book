Rated R.</P>
<P> "Bait" is one of those annoying movies in which flash and camera tricks
substitute for a lack of substance.</P>
<P> A derivative piece of work, borrowing liberally from such movies as
"Enemy of the State" and "Blue Streak," "Bait" also suffers from the sin
of indecision. The film can't decide whether it's an action comedy or
action thriller, so it tries to be both - falling flat on either count.</P>
<P> The movie stars Jamie Foxx, who performed so well in Oliver Stone's
hyper-kinetic "Any Given Sunday." But here Foxx flounders, trying to
magically switch from comical to serious not as he character demands,
but as the script dictates.</P>
<P> It is not Foxx's fault that he does not succeed. The actor has a screen
presence, which is wasted in pap such as "Bait."</P>
<P> As a matter of fact, a line in the movie aptly describes his
predictament: "What do you do with bait when you're done with it?"</P>
<P> In this case, you let it founder in a formulaic script that makes about
as much sense as naming Bob Knight dean of Miss Manners School of
Etiquette.</P>
<P> What is most preposterous about "Bait" is its plot, which begins with
the heist of $42 million in gold bullion.</P>
<P> The theft was a two-man job: The mastermind, a computer genius,
escapes; the second man - who conveniently has a weak heart - dies
before he can tell the feds where he hid the loot.</P>
<P> So the only way to retrieve the gold is to use Foxx's Alvin Sanders as
bait. And why Sanders?</P>
<P> Because he spent about eight hours in a holding cell with Mr. Bad
Ticker, so the feds think he may have been told where the gold was
stashed.</P>
<P> So to find the $42 mil, the government spends about $200 million on
newly developed surveillence equipment, including installing a device in
Sander's jaw. (This was done by having him beaten in prison so he would
need surgery).</P>
<P> Not only is Sanders bugged, but helicopters fly all over the place,
seemingly following him wherever he goes, and two or three unmakred vans
- also filled with snoop gadgets - are constantly trailing him.</P>
<P> Only the U.S. government would authorize the spending of hundreds of
millions to find a measly $42 million. Come to think of it, that's the
most plausible aspect of this nonsense.</P>
<P> "Bait "is MTV filmmaking: a lot of quick cuts making it hard to discern
who's doing what to whom; loud music that tries to pump up the action;
and big, loud explosions, which look like a fireworks display gone mad.</P>
<P> And it is riddled with cliches: the soft-spoken psychopath,
computer-nerd (Doug Hutchison); the tough-talking and acting fed (an
overwrought David Morse) who's as obsessed as "Les Miz's" Javert to
capture the criminal and recover the gold; the car chase in which 150
vehicles are smashed, but no accident reports get filed. You get the
idea.</P>
<P> Wasted in this entire outing is the lovely Kimberly Elise, who was so
wonderful in "Beloved." Here she plays Alvin's girlfriend. She's an
intelligent, self-sufficient woman, which makes it hard to comprehend
what she sees in Alvin.</P>
<P> "Bait" is nothing special. At a bit over two hours, it is at least a
half-hour too long. The movie is just an excuse to nosh on popcorn. Try
not to let this movie hook you.</P>
