<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a poorly directed and scripted derivative casino heist movie,
shamelessly stealing jokes, plot situations and shootout scenarios from
many other such films, including "Ocean's 11," "Honeymoon in Vegas,"
"The Limey," and "Reindeer Games." All the main characters are
unappealing, even the young boy can't get over as someone appealing. But
the most disheartening thing about this irrelevant flick, was its
unethical conclusion and its totally amoral characterization of the
film's stars. There is not one person worth too much in this motley crew
of lowlifes.</P>
<P>A gang meets in a desolate town outside of Las Vegas, planning to rob
the casino at the  Riviera Hotel. They are all dressed as Elvis
impersonators, as they arrive during an International Convention of
Elvis lookalikes. Michael (Kurt Russell), just released from prison, is
the first there, arriving in his 1959 red Cadillac convertible. A young
kid, Jesse (David Kaye), living in a rundown motel, robs his hubcaps.
Michael gets his sexy mother, Cybil (Courteney Cox), to return the
stolen goods and before the opening credits are completed, they're in
her motel room making the bedsprings creak bouncing up and down on the
bed.</P>
<P>Soon another car of Elvis impersonators arrives, with the gang's
sociopath leader, ex-con Murphy (Costner), sporting some mean looking
white trash, mutton-chop sideburns, and looking like the King did when
he was loaded up on drugs. Murphy is a cartoonish character, who has not
only fallen in love with his image as the King, but believes he is his
illegitimate son. The other gang members are Hanson (Christian Slater),
Gus (David Arquette) and Franklin (Bokeem Woodbine), all attired in
wigs, beaded flamboyant jump-suit Elvis costumes. It's a sight that is
meant to excite the faithful and help them fit into the Vegas scene.</P>
<P>The elaborate casino robbery, featuring slo-mo mayhem, which becomes the
heart of the film, was gratuitously violent, as the King's music played
throughout, performed by an Elvis impersonator on stage, even while the
bloody machine-gun robbery was in progress and dozens of security cops
were being shot from all angles.</P>
<P>When the gang escapes a conflict arises over how to split-up the over
three million dollars, which is settled by gunplay. The remainder of the
film turns into a road movie, with Murphy chasing after the dough
Michael and Cybil took from him. The conniving Cybil has fallen for him
and wants to domesticate him, and live happily ever after like a normal
nuclear family. They travel across Nevada and Idaho (where money
launderer Jon Lovitz makes a deal he wishes he didn't), and finally it
all comes to a bloody conclusion in Seattle. There are two federal
marshalls (Thomas Haden Church and Kevin Pollak) in on the chase, who
also contribute lame jokes, just like the gang members do. Even the head
of casino security (Paul Anka), has a lame joke about what's the fuss
about Elvis, he's been dead for ages. The only lame joke that made me
laugh, was when one gang member asked, What's the advantage of dating a
homeless woman? The answer is, you can drop her off anywhere. This film
is so ridiculous, that as one of the cynical FBI men wisecracks, after
learning about Murphy's rap sheet, "you can't make stuff like this up."
Unfortunately the screenwriters Lichtenstein and Recco did, which makes
for a particularly distasteful film. The only thing the film has going
for it, is that the situation and the characters are so ludicrous and
full of Elvis twitches, that there is certain kind of enjoyment to be
found in a film as bad as this one is -- that might be taken by some as
a guilty pleasure.</P>
