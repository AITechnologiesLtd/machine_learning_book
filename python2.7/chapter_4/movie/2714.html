<PRE>                                 FORREST GUMP
                       A film review by Roger A. Rubio
                        Copyright 1994 Roger A. Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, and Gary Sinise
Directed by Robert Zemeckis</P>
<P>     What a surprise!  I cannot say enough about this film.  It didn't
seem to appetizing from it's ad campaign, but it sure has taken me
unawares.  I was glad I went to see it, even though it was strictly
from the curiosity factor.  A definite good time at the movies.</P>
<P>     FORREST GUMP is the story of a rather remarkable individual named,
as you might have already figured out, Forrest Gump.  He's a rather
unremarkable individual on the outside, but when you listen to the
things he's been through in his life, you sit there in amazement.  How
can a simpleton from Alabama get into so much that is happening in the
world?  How can someone so suggestible be so suggestive?  It's a feat
that makes for pure movie entertainment.</P>
<P>     Tom Hanks is, as always, superb as the not so smart Gump, who
through unlikely coincidences and very plausible scenarios gets to meet
three presidents, becomes a war hero, starts and maintains a
million-dollar business, and marries the girl of his dreams.  It all
sounds very fairy-tale-ish, but you have to see the movie to understand
how this all happens.  It's not all handed to Gump on a silver
platter.  Often times he just gets it without really trying.  But
that's his appeal--that a man so simple--simpler that the average
everyday Joe--can get into such extrordinary circumstances and still
come out shining.  Forrest Gump shows that life is how you look at it.
Even the most horrible things in the world can be looked at simply.
The character and the movie FORREST GUMP is a refreshing alternate look
at recent history and today's events, through the eyes of a man you
would have never thought would be affected by any of it.  It seems,
instead, that he had an effect on history, rather than history
affecting him.</P>
<P>     This movie is a pure treat.  It has something for everyone.  The
battle scenes are amazing, historical figures are made to say things
they never said, the story in just plain funny, and the special effects
are something to see (I challenge people to find *all* of the effects
in this movie--they were that good).  I came out of the theater with my
jaw in my lap.  I never thought I would come of out a theater like that
when it was playing a story about normal everyday events, but I just
did.  Go see it--it's worth any admission price!</P>
