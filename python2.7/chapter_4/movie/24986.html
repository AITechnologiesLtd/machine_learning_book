<PRE>FAT CHANCE</PRE>
<PRE>BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Raja Gosnell</PRE>
<P>Screenplay by Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer</P>
<PRE>With Martin Lawrence, Nia Long</PRE>
<PRE>(Theater) PG-13 97 min</PRE>
<P>Probably the scene that lost me was the early one where the fat lady 
rushes into the bathroom, hikes up her dress, sinks with a sigh onto the 
toilet, and lets go with loud, flatulent diarrhea, while Martin 
Lawrence, hiding in the shower, makes "Oh boy does it stink!" faces. 
Now, there are people who think that's hilarious, I imagine, or they 
wouldn't have put it in a comedy. There must have been chuckles at the 
pitch, chortles at the script conferences, and guffaws on the set. There 
weren't any in the theater where I saw it.</P>
<P>In fact, this entire 97-minute exercise in movie comedy was pretty much 
laugh-free. Take a little Tootsie (a great comedy), run it through a few 
reels of Mrs. Doubtfire (a pretty funny picture), dredge it in some 
Nutty Professor (now we're showing signs of strain), and by the time it 
comes out here, we're talking about a severely depleted comic gene pool. </P>
<P>Martin Lawrence is an appealing guy, but he doesn't seem to have a sure 
fix on what's funny. Here he's an FBI man who's a master of disguise, 
and when Sherry (Nia Long), the ex-girlfriend of an escaped convict 
(Terrence Howard), goes to hide out at her granny's, and granny gets 
called out of town, it's an opportunity made in comedy hell. As quick as 
you can say Little Red Ridinghood, Lawrence has disguised himself with 
enough latex to keep a Nevada whorehouse in condoms for a decade, and 
he's greeting Sherry on the front walk with a big hug saying "Big Momma 
could never forget that ass.ma."</P>
<P>Nia Long, who showed well in The Best Man, is a lovely actress who will 
certainly live this down. Terrence Howard, the cynic from that same 
movie, is reasonably menacing as the villain, but he's on so little you 
hardly notice. The director, Raja Gosnell, has directed a couple of 
pictures (Never Been Kissed, Home Alone 3), but he must have caught this 
bug while editing Mrs. Doubtfire. But that had Robin Williams, and a 
script. This one made it to the screen without an ounce of wit or 
originality.</P>
<P>This is the picture that famously landed Lawrence in the hospital with 
heat stroke as he was jogging in heavy clothes to lose weight. Martin, 
baby, it wasn't worth it.</P>
