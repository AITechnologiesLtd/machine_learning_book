Rated G</PRE>
<P>There is something so magical about animation- it's taking art and
shaping it into a story.  Disney has captured the glory and significance
of this movie art form through the years and Tarzan's animation is
mesmerizing.  I wish I could say the same for the movie itself.  I liked
it a lot, but it doesn't hold up in the company of The Little Mermaid,
Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or The Hunchback of Notre
Dame.  Perhaps I find the latest Disney offerings (Pocahontas, Mulan,
Tarzan) somewhat disenchanted because I am growing up.  However, I still
continue to watch old Disney classics and the earlier ‘90s films and am
always thrilled by them.  Tarzan is good fun, though, and it even has
something to say - that perhaps a child can be raised by anyone, any
animal; that we can all live in harmony and peace together on this
earth, beast and man.</P>
<P>Set in Africa, the film begins with scenes of Tarzan's parents being
shipwrecked and building a house for themselves on the island upon which
they are stranded.  When Tarzan's two parents are killed by a viscous
leopard, ape Kala (Glenn Close), who has also lost her baby to the
leopard, adopts him as her own.  Her mate Kerchak (Lance Henriksen)
disapproves.  He is a melancholic ape who will, for most of the rest of
his life, taunt and be cold towards Tarzan.  There is a part of Kala who
thinks Tarzan can replace her dead baby.</P>
<P>As Tarzan grows up, he makes friends with Turk, another ape (Rosie
O'Donnell), and Tantor, an elephant (Wayne Knight).  When a group of
explorers visits the jungle, Tarzan is curious because they look exactly
like he does.  He is suddenly angry at his ape mother for hiding this
from him, the fact that there are people who look like him, and soon
discovers the truth of his adoption.  He befriends these humans, among
them a bubbly Minnie Driver character, a courageous, spunky girl named
Jane Porter.  She, her father (Nigel Hawthorne), and Clayton (Brian
Blessed), a man who is with them to protect them but seems to always go
against their wishes, are in the wilds to study gorillas.  Mr. Porter
has a theory that gorillas are social animals and are gentle.  Clayton,
the core villain of the film, thinks differently and is out to shoot
some.  When Jane is attacked by a group of monkeys, Tarzan comes to her
rescue, and then, they fall in love.  Tarzan must then decide whether he
wants to stay in the world he has known all his life or go back to where
he "belongs."</P>
<P>One of the movie's greatest flaws is the lack of a memorable villain.
The Gaston-like brute Clayton, is stupid and not frightening at all.
Because of this, Tarzan just isn't as fun as it could've been.  I
enjoyed Phil Collins' songs laden with percussion beats.  There is a
nice bounce to the beginning of the single version of the Rob Cavallo
co-produced "You'll Be In My Heart."  Though none of the songs are as
memorable as Disney's earlier theme songs, Collins' work fits the film
perfectly.  I enjoyed the voices, too.  I bet Rosie O'Donnell had a lot
of fun creating Terk's voice.  She kind of exaggerates too much and her
performance doesn't seem as natural as Minnie Driver's performance, but
she's fun.  Driver is enthusiastic and her magnetic self as Jane, and
Nigel Hawthorne is funny as Jane's lively father.</P>
<P>Over the years, I have set high standards for Disney movies.  They used
to have grandeur and heart, and while Tarzan has both, it is all to a
lesser degree.  Tarzan has a vibrant energy in its scenes in which
Tarzan is fighting with animals like leopards and wild monkeys, but as a
whole, the movie is disappointing; fun, but underwhelming.</P>
