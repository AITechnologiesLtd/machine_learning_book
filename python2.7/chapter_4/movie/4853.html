                       A film review by Vince Deehan
                        Copyright 1996 Vince Deehan</PRE>
<P>Director: David Jones
Screenplay: Stephen Metcalfe, based on his play "Strange Snow".
Cast: Robert De Niro, Ed Harris, Kathy Baker.</P>
<P>I first saw this film about six years ago and it left such a deep impression 
on me that I was pleased to be able to see it again recently.  JACKNIFE tells 
the story of two Vietnam veterans, David (Ed Harris) and Megs/Jacknife 
(Robert De Niro).  David is living with his high school-teacher sister,
Martha (Kathy Baker), and is drinking heavily, trying to blot out the pain 
of his traumatic war experiences.  He works as a truck driver but has no life 
outside his job, other than his daily ritual of drinking himself into a 
drunken stupor each night in the local bar.</P>
<P>The film begins with the arrival of Megs, an old buddy who Dave served 
alongside in Vietnam, in the early hours of the morning at Martha and 
Dave's house to take Dave fishing on the first day of the season.  Martha
has never met Megs before, and although her first impressions of him are not 
favourable, she quickly gets caught up in his enthusiasm and decides to join 
the boys on their fishing trip.</P>
<P>It turns out that Megs is involved with a veterans support group and is 
trying to reach out to his old friend to help him get through his pain and 
torment. Whilst in Vietnam, Megs and David were close friends with another 
soldier called Bobby (Tom Isbell, who we see in flashbacks).  They were a 
tightly knit trio of pals, but Bobby was killed trying to save Megs and 
this loss of his friend has caused David incredible guilt and pain ever 
since. </P>
<P>Alongside the story of Megs and David is the touching romance that blossoms 
between Megs and the shy Martha.  This cause alot of problems for David who 
knows how violent and crazy Megs has been in the past, and fears still is.  
When David warns Martha away from Megs, David also admits that he is scared
of losing his sister who has, effectively, looked after him and kept him 
company all these years.  </P>
<P>The romance between Megs and Martha is very well written and played by 
De Niro and Baker.  Megs is clearly a bit of a wild, untamed sort of bloke 
who appears to have as little experience of women, as Martha has of men.  
The scene where they go out for a meal together early in the film is a gem.  
Megs clumsily tries to compliment Martha but says it in a ham-fisted and 
foul-mouthed way and is genuinely shocked when Martha doesn't take it too 
kindly.  Only when they both admit to being very nervous do they manage to 
clearly communicate with each other.</P>
<P>Stephen Metcalfe's wonderful script is brilliantly brought to life by the 
first-class acting of De Niro, Baker and Harris.  Ed Harris as the 
traumatised David is simply perfect, and it is his deeply haunting 
performance that has been burned in my memory since I first saw the film 
six years ago.  The pain is clear in his eyes throughout the film.  The 
most powerful scene occurs when David goes to visit Bobby's 
parents and asks them to let him look after their lawn.  From the minute 
he walks in their door, it is as if part of their own son Bobby has 
returned and although their son is not mentioned in the scene his presence 
in the room is powerfully felt.  The acting here by Harris, and Walter 
Massey and Elizabeth Franz as Bobby's parents, is incredible.  The power 
lies in what they don't say, and in the expressions on all of their faces.</P>
<P>The only disappointments in the film lie in the Vietnam flashbacks.  They 
really are nowhere near as powerful and as effective as they should be. 
Since the whole film pivots around the death of their friend Bobby, it was 
a shame that I was left unmoved by these scenes.  </P>
<P>As a film showing the way past traumas can affect peoples lives, the film 
is very successful.  The suffering of war veterans should never be 
underestimated or forgotten and any film that brings this to our attention 
is to be commended.</P>
