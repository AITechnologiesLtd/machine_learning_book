<P>starring Terrence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Lesley Ann Warren, Luis Guzman
screenplay by Lem Dobbs
directed by Steven Soderbergh</P>
<P>If your story's villain isn't particularly heinous, give him/her a tic
or habit; at the very least, annoy us. The Limey's bad guy, a record
producer who goes by the lone title Valentine (Fonda), is always
inspecting his teeth and checking his gums with a Sulca brush.
(Irritatingly so.) He likes to show off his pearly whites. </P>
<P>Wilson (Stamp), a "limey", wants to wipe that smile off his face. Upon
release from an English prison, Wilson ventures to California in
pursuit of Valentine, his daughter Jenny's killer. He's a Cockney
shark out for vengeance, matter-of-fact tough and unafraid. The movie
began for me when the sixty-something Wilson took out a factory full
of thugs with his pistol-after they beat him up. The Limey is about an
absentee father's ("I watched her grow up...in increments," he tells a
friend) search for redemption through violence. He will deny his own
physical pain until his task is finished.</P>
<P>When he first arrives in L.A., Wilson hooks up with Ed (Luis Guzmán),
the man who informed him, through letters to his cellblock, of Jenny's
demise. (Ed, an ex-con himself, met her in an acting class.) In a
refreshing change of pace, Valentine's henchmen leave Ed alone-no
surprise visits in the middle of the night, no car bombs, no
kidnapping Ed's loved ones... That wimpy Valentine is a bundle of
nerves when he finds out about Wilson also impressed me. "Oh man, I'm
screwed," he wails to Avery, his head of security (Barry Newman).
Avery and Wilson are about the same age; it'll be an interesting
fight.</P>
<P>The plot avoids Death Wish parallels at every turn. The filmmakers
even manage some wry commentary on moviemaking that doesn't feel
imposed upon the material. (Can a California-set tale avoid mention of
Hollywood?) The obvious culture clash between Wilson and the
L.A.-types (Bill Duke's policeman responds to one of Wilson's frantic
monologues, "The one thing I don't understand is every motherfucking
thing you just said") is handled coolly-without overplaying it,
Soderbergh lets us know that we've never seen a character like Wilson
in a film like this before.</P>
<P>Soderbergh got carried away in the editing room, however. Imagine an
entire motion picture structured the way his brilliant, dual-timeline
love scene montage was in Out of Sight. I was distracted to the point
of contention at several points in The Limey by cinematic technique.
(Sometimes, four or five scenes are happening at once, though the
narrative magically remains coherent.) I must write that Stamp's
mesmerizing performance eventually drew me back in, every time. I
guess I prefer so-called invisible cutting.  </P>
<P>I was rooting for the cold yet sympathetic Wilson, perhaps because he
speaks just like my grandfather. (Though I pitied poor, just plain
pathetic Valentine.) Stamp wraps his lips around every syllable, drops
letters from the beginnings or the ends of words, and has a whole
dictionary of unfamiliar slang. (For a sampling, visit the film's
official website by clicking here.) </P>
<P>With ingenuity, Soderbergh integrates footage of Stamp for flashback
purposes from an early Ken Loach effort called Poor Cow. Stamp seems
so genuine as Wilson that we feel as if we've never seen him act
before, that these snippets of a 1967 drama are photographed memories
of the character in his youth.</P>
