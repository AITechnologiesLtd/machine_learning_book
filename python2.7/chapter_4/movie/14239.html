<PRE>Titanic (James Cameron), 1997</PRE>
<PRE>Review from Cinephobia</PRE>
<P>It is with some surprise that I come to write this review. For, eight
months after it opened, it's a little disorientating to remind myself
that I actually did very much enjoy James Cameron's epic "Titanic."
That's because, somewhere in that time period, the unrelenting
crudfest that has surrounded this film has made me hate the film and
everything about it. I hate Leonardo DiCaprio. I hate James Horner.
And surely I can't be alone in wishing that Celine Dione's heart would
just *stop*?</P>
<P>But I want to be objective. So, having acknowledged my qualms, I'll
try to set them aside. And let's get at the question that the hype has
all too often obscured: is the film any good? If so, why? And if not,
why not?</P>
<P>The key to this question is to situate the film within the correct
genre. James Cameron, let's remember, is an action director; he is
probably America's most talented (Spielberg at his best is better, but
Spielberg's problems of late are a whole different issue). He made
"Aliens" (my vote as the best sci-fi actioner of the eighties), both
"Terminator" films, "The Abyss," and "True Lies." He is not known as
director of romances. True, one thing that was notable in his best
films ("Aliens" and the first "Terminator") was an attention to
character. But this was never a feature that could stand on its own,
and until "Titanic" I don't think Cameron ever harboured illusions
that it could. The beauty of Cameron's work was that he could create
serviceable, yet affecting, emotional subplots and integrate them
fully into the thrust of an action narrative (think how well Ripley's
maternal instincts are played upon in "Aliens"). We must see the plot
of Titanic in these terms. Do we really believe that Cameron conceived
the love story between these two characters and then decided the
perfect backdrop was the sinking of the Titanic? I don't. I'm pretty
sure Cameron started with the thought of how exciting the sinking
scenes would be and then grafted Jack and Rose into the events
afterwards. </P>
<P>The film bears this out. As a good old fashioned disaster movie,
"Titanic" is superb. The special effects, while not as flawless as
some would have you believe, are extremely impressive. This is even
truer when you consider how many involve water effects, which are
notoriously difficult: they become expensive when done full scale
(think "Waterworld") and tend to look very fake when miniaturised
(think of the breaking dam in "Superman"). Cameron has the advantage
of making his film after the rediscovery of the ship's wreckage. This
has opened up a great deal of new information, which happily points to
a sequence of events considerably more visually exciting than the old
image of the ship sinking intact under the waves. And Cameron is
ingenious at working his characters into the right places to witness
all the best action. The imagery here is stunning, from the creepy
bits as icy water chases rats through the hull to the showstopping
final scenes as the stern sinks underwater. Cameron delivers all the
highpoints like the skilled craftsman he is; the flawless framing,
editing, and choreography of action should be taken up as an example
within the industry (take note Michael Bay). These scenes get about an
hour devoted to them, which is about the time the ship took to sink,
but Cameron isn't after some "High Noon"-style exercise in real time
editing. He's showing off his mastery of the medium, his gorgeous
production design, and his astonishing visual effects. On this level
the film is an enormous achievement, and I came out of the cinema more
excited than I have for quite a while. ("Face/Off" was probably the
last film that gave me such a buzz).</P>
<P>Yet I quickly came to begrudge the film its success. Why? Because
people seem to enjoy the film at a level on which it isn't any good.
It was the love story that seemed to be drawing the repeat business,
and the film's success at the Oscars was based, presumably, on the
belief that the film was (or could be passed off as) a work of
important, substantial, serious drama. After all, you don't give
Oscars to action films (though they sometimes get nominations, as
several of Spielberg's have). And this aspect of the film is a bare
minimum effort: as I have suggested, it is subservient to the action.
As drama in its own right it has considerably less integrity than
Sarah Conner's plight in "The Terminator" or even Ripley's affecting
angst in "Aliens." Essentially we have a familiar, hackneyed class
conflict romance such as we have seen hundreds of times elsewhere,
told with less flair than usual. Cameron doesn't add any surprising
notes to the cliched story, and his representation of class oppression
is very schematic (I'm inclined to think a British or Australian
director might have brought out the logic of class with more subtlety
and appreciation). Many of Cameron's character moments are oafishly
clumsy and obvious (think of the business with the loogy, or the
sequence with the Picassos, or the way Rose immediately spots the
lifeboat shortage).</P>
<P>The performances are nothing to write home about. Kate Winslett is
strong and well cast, but the flat material gives her no character
nuances to try and draw out. Leonardo DiCaprio is all wrong: I've
liked him in several previous roles (I thought he was excellent in Baz
Luhrmann's superb "Romeo and Juliet"), but Jack is not his finest
moment. DiCaprio looks all out of place in this time period, and there
are none of the rough edges to his character that a life of poverty
would likely produce (this is the kind of thing I mean when I say
Cameron doesn't get the true workings of class). He's too
unrelentingly perfect: it's like watching Winslett get seduced by a
cherub. Billy Zane is a lot more entertaining, mainly because he seems
to have realised how preposterous his part is and decided to ham it
up. He has a blatant caddishness that is actually extremely funny: if
Cameron was a little more appreciative of this we could have had an
interesting film that explored Winslett's sly appreciation of his
antisocial behaviour. But Cameron seems to take him seriously, and
indeed seems to accept David Warner's henchman as a real character
too. (Warner actually played the romantic lead in an earlier, less
carefully marketed version of the story). Ultimately the stuntmen and
CGI virtual people come off as more convincing: they at least know how
to die.</P>
<P>So I can't go along with those who gave this film a Best Picture Oscar
(against an unusually strong field, too) or think that it's the modern
"Gone with the Wind." Let's just all get ourselves large screen TVs
with hi-fi stereo sound and watch the final hour over and over again.
Only then will sanity prevail.</P>
