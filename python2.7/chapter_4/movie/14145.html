*********************************</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Chris Eyre</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Sherman Alexie</PRE>
<P>Starring: Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer, Tantoo
Cardinal</P>
<P>Ingredients: Two young guys on a road trip who can't get along, Native
Americans, fatherhood</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Flashback: Years ago a tragic fire occurs in a home on an American
Indian Reservation in Idaho. During the fire an alcohol-prone man named
Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer) bravely saves an infant named Thomas, about
the same age as his own baby boy Victor. "I didn't mean to," Arnold
says. Tragically, Arnold becomes an alcoholic as the lads grow taller,
and finally he abandons his son Victor and the family.</P>
<P>When an unexpected phone call brings the news of Arnold's death in a
trailer park in Phoenix to the Idaho reservation, Victor (Adam Beach)
and Thomas (Evan Adams) are about 20 years old. Victor is somewhat of a
stoic, cynical person, while Thomas is an irritating, talkative, geeky
person. Although they don't have much money, the misfit friends set off
together on a quest to reach the Phoenix trailer park to recover
Arnold's ashes. </P>
<P>In the meantime, they ponder who exactly Arnold was, why he left, and
the general bond between fathers and sons.</P>
<P>Opinion:
SMOKE SIGNALS is a tasteful and well-acted movie about a universal
theme: trying to understand why your father did the things he did, as
you were growing up. Aside from being a movie about two guys on the road
and the universal theme of men trying to understand their fathers, there
is also a pleasant and unique cultural background that pervades the
movie. SMOKE SIGNALS is written, directed, and acted by Native
Americans.</P>
<P>For example, when the son asks, "I promised you I would. You want me to
sign a written contract, Mom?" the mother replies, "Nah, we Indians have
a thing about signed documents."</P>
<P>The soundtrack is also very unique, especially for those like myself who
are unfamiliar with rock done in American Indian style. (Actually rock
music is ethnic by nature, since it is the blending of African rhythms
with the European chord schemes). Conventional rock music is on a 4/4
beat, but the timing of the notes in Native American Indian chants is
highly advanced; much more sophisticated than folk or rock. The blending
of Native American timing with the rock beat is fascinating. A good
example of this is the humorous song, "John Wayne's Teeth" which is
heard during the bus trip in the movie.</P>
<P>All in all, it's obvious that SMOKE SIGNALS was lovingly created by
people who wanted to bring homespun wisdom to life. If you've seen one
too many megastar schlock formulas this summer and are burnt out on
them, take a break and check out SMOKE SIGNALS.</P>
