<P> I can't remember a single memorable quote from this dud. Sorry.</P>
<P>Starring Steve Zahn, Jeremy Northam, William H. Macy, Illeana Douglas,
Ally Walker. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Happy, Texas is the worst kind of disappointment, a film that has no
idea what to do with its ingenious comic premise. It takes a good idea
and then does everything wrong. Nothing works. The performances are way
off, the direction misses the point and the laughs are conspicuously
absent. Here is a film with nothing -- nothing -- going for it; how it
became a big hit at the Sundance Film Festival is completely beyond me.</P>
<P>The film actually shares some plot traits with the infinitely better
Three to Tango. Both films are about heterosexual people forced to
pretend they're gay; in this case to escape arrest, in the other to get
a job. Here our protagonists are two escaped convicts; Wayne Wayne
Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn), who is very volatile and slightly slow and
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), who is the smart one -- and we know he
is smart, you see, because the movie tells us that he was convicted for
credit card fraud. See? Smart guy! In any event, the two manage to
escape when their transport van crashes. They seek refuge in a town
called Happy, Texas where they are mistaken for a gay couple who
organize kiddie beauty pageants.</P>
<P>Being smart, Harry decides to stay there. He appoints Wayne Wayne Wayne
as the pageant master while he himself deals with the more pressing
business such as planning a bank robbery and courting a town gal (Ally
Walker) without revealing his true sexual orientation (gasp! -- he is
straight!). Wayne Wayne Wayne struggles to manage the wee ones while
Harry hangs out with townfolk. Told you he was smart.</P>
<P>What smart Harry didn't count on was Chappy (William H. Macy), the town
sheriff and a closeted homosexual. All of a sudden Chappy decides that
Harry is his kind of guy and wants to go out with him. Not wanting to
compromise their position, Harry goes with him to a gay bar and fakes
a "relationship". Since he doesn't want to "do anything" with the
kindly sheriff, he must convince him that he likes to "move his
relationships along slowly".</P>
<P>This movie is a total mess. The premise is handled incorrectly. The
jokes just sort of sit there; director Mark Illsley never aspires to
take them a step further. Northam's Harry spends most of the running
time essentially denying the premise; he refuses to accept his own idea
of pretending to be gay. Even in his scenes with Chappy, he is oddly
reserved, never bursting into a sort of outrageousness we would expect
from a movie like this. Zahn hams it up like nobody's business to the
point where he is like one of the three stooges. Not funny. In the part
of the would-be pageant coordinator we want someone clever who will
think on his feet and give us something creative rather than some moron
who will do little but make a fool of himself.</P>
<P>The only performer who emerges out of this ordeal with some dignity
left is the great William H. Macy, the one actor here who is successful
in his role. Zahn and Northam simply have the wrong idea; their
performances are inadequate because of the way they choose to play
them. I don't know why someone didn't at least momentarily halt this
production half-way through and insist that it wasn't working. The real
disaster isn't even the film itself but the fact that reportedly
intelligent people let this movie's inadequacies get to the point of no
return.</P>
<P>Happy, Texas could've worked. All it needed was a good think-through.
Performances should have been altered and the script reworked. That's
what the film needed. It didn't get it. This is the result.</P>
