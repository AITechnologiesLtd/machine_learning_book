<P>Plot: Investigating a mysterious eyeless, hermaphroditic dead body 
Thomas Dagget, a former priest who has lost his faith and is now working 
as a detective, is thrust into the midst of an earthly war between 
angels. A fallen angel Gabriel is trying to create a new Heaven and 
seeks the soul of a Korean War colonel accused of human sacrifice. The 
soul has been transplanted into the body of a young Indian girl for 
protection and Thomas must fight to protect her as Gabriel comes to 
collect her.</P>
<P>`The Prophecy' is the directorial debut of Gregory Widen, previously a 
scriptwriter on the likes of `Highlander' and `Backdraft'. (Well 
technically Widen made his debut on an episode of `Tales from the Crypt' 
but this is his feature debut). And here Widen makes an impressively 
literate venture into the theme of angels. When one thinks about angels 
on film what invariably comes to mind is the likes of Roma Downey in 
`Touched by an Angel' or Michael Landon in `Highway to Heaven' and their 
accompanying assortment of insipidly preachy feelgood family sentiments. 
Perhaps at its best the feelgood angel treatment reaches the heights of 
an `It's a Wonderful Life' or ventures off into the beatific meditations 
of Wim Wenders `Wings of Desire' and `Faraway ! So Close', but most 
angel films seem trapped somewhere between Pollyanna fantasies and being 
all-but-in-name Baptist recruiting commercials. Amidst this `The 
Prophecy' is welcome as the first film to venture into the angelic 
fantasy by way of a full, heady flight of Biblical mythology and to 
eschew the weepy positive thinking sentiments in favour of a grand Old 
Testament fire and thunder. Indeed the only other filmic effort to so 
venture into this take on angelic mythology is an impressive recent 
episode of `The X Files', `All Souls'.</P>
<P>`The Prophecy' is equally rare for being a horror film that is conducted 
not with gooey meltdown effects and campy one-liners but with literacy 
and intelligence. (Which may well explain why it was not a major 
box-office success). It is certainly a film that asks patience of an 
audience - it is a good half-hour into the film before the often 
wilfully cryptic plot strands begin to coalesce and one begins to 
properly understand what is going on. And even when they have done so, 
one feels, one or two strands are left unwound - I, for instance, was 
never sure coming away from the film what Gabriel needed the colonel's 
soul for. But Widen gives his Gabriel and Lucifer some beautifully 
ornate pieces of dialogue: "You know how you got that dent in your top 
lip ?" Gabriel taunts hero Koteas. "Way back, before you were born, I 
put my finger there and said `shhhh'." Equally appealing are Widen's 
playfully amusing images of angels in the modern world - Gabriel 
resurrecting the dead because he hasn't learnt how to drive a car or the 
delightful throwaway gag with Gabriel sitting amongst a group of school 
children, getting them try out his trumpet. If the film is to be faulted 
it is that its medium range budget never quite allows Widen to direct 
his angelic war with the grandiose scope it keeps seeming to want to 
break out into, but on the other hand this also does allow him to keep 
the story contained at a more cerebral rather than physical level.</P>
<P>As Gabriel, Christopher Walken has quite the most fun he appears to have 
had in a role in some years. The role is perfectly suited to Walken and 
both he and Widen craft the part with just the right balance of 
extravagant playing to the gallery and wry, ironic humour. Also very 
good is Viggo Mortensen as Lucifer. Mortensen, who is usually cast as 
blue collar working men and who always seems to have eluded the star 
quality he seems eminently capable of, makes for an intense and darkly 
captivating Lucifer. It is one of the joyous ironies of this fine film 
that it is Lucifer that becomes the unexpected benefactor to the hero's 
struggle and at the climax even the equivalent of the Seventh Cavalry 
arriving to save the day.</P>
