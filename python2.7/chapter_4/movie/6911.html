<PRE>                         EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        With his twenty-ninth film, Woody Allen proves again that he 
can be successful in nearly any genre he tries. EVERYONE SAYS I 
LOVE YOU is Woody's first musical, a magical and romantic movie 
that manages to be bitingly funny and warm-hearted at the same time. 
Allen, who is 60 years old, is still just as entertaining now as he was 
at any point in his career, maybe more so because the movies he 
makes no longer focus on him but make him one player in a large 
ensemble cast.</P>
<P>        The plot centers around one large, well-to-do family. Alan 
Alda plays Goldie Hawn's second husband, with Natalie Portman as 
their teenage daughter and Lukas Haas the conservative son in an 
otherwise liberal family. Woody is Hawn's first husband, their 
daughters Natasha Lyonne and Drew Barrymore serving as 
reminders of the love they once had.</P>
<P>        Edward Norton plays Barrymore's boyfriend, who sings "Just 
You Just Me" to her in the film's opening scene, and later plants an 
engagement ring in her dessert as a romantic surprise. He gets a 
surprise of his own as she unknowingly eats the ring, which leads to 
a long song-and-dance scene in a hospital in which even a man in a 
full-body cast breaks into song. This scene is indicative of the film's 
delightful balance between parody and tribute to the elaborate, long-
gone musicals of the past.</P>
<P>        Allen plays an author who lives in Paris and has had little 
luck with love, until he sees Julia Roberts walk by. This turns out to 
be an amazing coincidence, because Lyonne has listened in on many 
of Roberts' therapy sessions and knows every little detail about her. 
Armed with this knowledge, Woody personifies her desires and 
fantasies and has no choice but to fall in love with him. And because 
he wrote the script.</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, bleeding heart liberal Hawn has crusaded for the 
release of convict Tim Roth, who comes over for dinner and manages 
to steal Barrymore's heart with his uncouth ways, while Portman and 
her best friend Gaby Hoffman both fall in love with the same boy. All 
these characters have their romantic difficulties, and they all get to 
sing "I'm Through With Love" at one time or another.</P>
<P>        Every character in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, at one time 
or another, bursts into song. The most intriguing thing about this is 
that Allen had all the actors except Barrymore do their own singing. 
Hawn and Norton turn out to be surprisingly good, while the rest 
are at least adequate. None of them sound especially professional, 
but dubbing everyone with professional vocals would have rung 
false and destroyed the film's sense of ambition that makes you feel 
like, when strong emotions hit, anyone will sing in public.</P>
<P>        There are a lot of very funny lines and situations in 
EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, as in any good Woody Allen film, 
but this one manages to be a lot more optimistic and touching than 
most of his movies. The scene in which Allen dances with Hawn on 
the banks of the Seine exudes more romantic warmth and poignancy 
than any other moment in any one of his movies. Maybe he's finally 
found happiness with his adopted daughter.</P>
