"The Road Home"</PRE>
<P>Businessman Luo Yusheng (Sun Honglei) is going home. His father recently
died and his mother  (Zhao Yuelin) insists that, following tradition, the
body be walked home from the hospital morgue many miles away. Luo balks at
the idea, but when he sees an old photo from his parents' youth, his
reminiscences of their locally historic courtship cause him to change his
mind and fulfill his mother's wish to walk with his father, one last time,
on "The Road Home."</P>
<P>Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou has been responsible for some of the world's
most beautifully rendered films since the start of his career. "Red
Sorghum," "Ju Dou" and "Raise the Red Lantern" dealt with such issues as
sex, political repression and male misogyny in lightly veiled personal
statements against the Chinese government's humanitarian policies. His
latest films, though, like "Not One Less" and the now-showing "The Road
Home," take on a more personal, gentle air.</P>
<P>"The Road Home" begins, in present day China, with Luo Yusheng making the
long, cold winter's journey home to Sanhetun, the tiny village of his
birth, to attend his father's funeral. The old man was a schoolteacher who
came to the town 40 years ago, fell in love and stayed, teaching the
children, until his recent death. Now, the man's mother insists that there
be a traditional funeral and her husband's body be carried back on the
shoulders of the village men. Luo thinks the demand unreasonable and tries
to persuade his mother to change her mind. But, as he gazes at an old
photograph of mom and dad when the were first married, he recalls the local
stories of their unique courtship and it's his mind that changes.</P>
<P>We are taken away from the stark black and white of the modern day story to
a lush and colorful time, 40 years before. The pretty, young Zhao Di, the
comeliest maiden in the village, learns that a new schoolteacher has been
assigned to their tiny hamlet and is pleasantly surprised to find Luo
Changyu (Hao Zheng) to be a darned handsome young man. Di unabashedly sets
her cap for the young man, against the advice of her elderly, blind
grandmother (Bin Li). The subsequent tale is a sweet remembrance of two
people falling in love.</P>
<P>Zhang Yimou has always created striking images on the screen, but has, in
recent years, taken on simpler stories that deal with the day-to-day
mechanics of life and living. Daily incidents like cooking food or
repairing a bowl are shown in great detail with a love of image that makes
you drink in every moment of such simple tasks. There is also a hint of
rebelliousness as the determined Di goes against the tradition of arranged
marriage. The pairing of Di and Luo because of love, not arrangement, makes
the courtship and subsequent nuptials a local legend, remembered by all,
even today.</P>
<P>Zhang Zi-Yi lights up the screen with her smile and, in one scene where Luo
first notices her, it is almost blinding. Her dazzling smile and animate
features are a plus since there is little dialogue and the story is
conveyed primarily with visual images. There is Di's painstaking
preparations of meals she hopes Luo will select during the lunch breaks as
the men of the village build the new schoolhouse. She spends days and weeks
trying to arrange a chance encounter with the teacher, even travelling
across the village to get water from the well near the school, but farther
from her home. (The well is used for subtle humor in one scene where
teacher Luo, noticing Di, tries to rush up and get water for himself. But,
a well-intentioned villager insists that the scholar is too important for
such menial tasks and struggles to wrest the buckets away from the eager
Luo. It's a funny, believable little scene.)</P>
<P>The bookends of the film, the man going home, is a movie unto itself as the
wash of emotions and remembrances help to change Luo Yusheng and honor his
mother's wish. Once his mind is changed, he seeks the help of the town's
mayor (Guifa Chang) to hire men from another village to help carry his
father's coffin home. When the day finally comes and the procession makes
its way on the long journey, the mayor gives back all the money, explaining
that over 100 of the old teacher's students have volunteered to help. The
others, who were hired for pay, refuse the money in honor of the deceased.</P>
<P>"The Road Home" is a world-class film that shows influences from other
countries. The distinctly western-sounding score by Bao San uses soaring
violins and a lone flute that sounds much like the music to "Braveheart."
Cinematography, by Yong Hou, is striking, especially his color work used in
the flashbacks. Zhang Yimou has always used colors prominently in his films
and Yong Hou utilizes them to stunning affect, especially for the
exteriors. Costume design, by Huamiao Tong, is terrific, particularly the
attention to Zhang Zi-Yi's outfits of bright pink and vivid red. Art
direction, by Juiping Cao, is nicely rendered and spans the decades
properly as what was once young is now old.</P>
<P>The true story, by Shi Bao from his novel "Remembrance," is a simple,
loving tale that wears its sentimentality like a badge of honor. It is
homage to our parents and an affirmation of love and loyalty that easily
spans cultures. It isn't a Chinese story, but a universal and human one. I
give "The Road Home" an A.</P>
