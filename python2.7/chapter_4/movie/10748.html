<PRE>Firefox (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 81</PRE>
<P>"Firefox" is a drama about five teenage girls who become
close friends but get into trouble with authority figures.  
Though critically ignored and maligned, it is actually an
excellent film.  I liked the cinematography, the characters,
and even the eroticism.</P>
<P>The plot of "Firefox" has an odious high school biology 
teacher sexually harassing several of his students.
Led by teenaged drifter Legs (then-unknown Angelina Jolie), 
five girls become involved in an after school altercation 
with the teacher.  He gets his, but the girls are expelled.  
They begin hanging together in an abandoned house, but Jolie's 
hostile attitudes towards men and authority disrupts their 
lives and friendships.</P>
<PRE>Some spoilers may follow.</PRE>
<P>Critical reaction to "Foxfire" is all over the map, and evenly
spread between condemnation, hesitation, and praise.  Common
themes for criticism include the lesbian character Legs, a
lengthy frontal nudity scene considered gratitious, a few
male characters who are complete jerks, and the similarity 
of the film's plot to any number of other films.
My only criticism is the abandoned house: how could such
a lovely house, surrounded by woods, remain empty and open.
It is a plot contrivance to give the young women a private
hangout.</P>
<P>Too much is made of the lesbian themes of the movie.  Of the
five girls, only Legs is a lesbian.  Maddy has a boyfriend, 
Violet is promiscuous, Rita is shy but fantasizes about men, while 
druggie Goldie is asexual.  Jolie's character has an unresolved
anger towards men, perhaps because of a troubled relationship
with her own father.  The film's occasional homoeroticism
is limited to Legs, and whatever interest is returned to her
by the other girls is from friendship.</P>
<P>There are two male characters in "Foxfire" that are jerks:
the predatory teacher, and a jock who for some reason wants
to revenge that teacher's downfall.  The teacher character
is too interesting to be a stereotype, while the hateful jock
helps provide needed tension in the film.  I don't have problems
with either character.  There is also Goldie's father, who 
attempts toughlove to reform his troubled daughter.  He clearly 
cares for her, and in the end you feel sorry for him.</P>
<P>One theme that I liked about the movie is that reckless
behaviour has negative consequences.  A teacher is assaulted;
those responsible are expelled.  Stop signs and red lights
are run; the car gets flipped.  They break into a school;
they unintentionally start a fire.  A student experiments
with drugs; she becomes a heroin addict.</P>
<P>I liked cinematography as well.  The close-ups all seem
appropriate, and the camera follows the action nicely.</P>
