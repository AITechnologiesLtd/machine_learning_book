<PRE>                                    GUARDING TESS
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

<PRE>===</PRE>
<P>     If Tom Clancy tried to write a sitcom, he'd probably end up with
something like GUARDING TESS--a horribly misfired comedy about a
by-the-book Secret Service agent assigned to protect a
do-anything-she-wants-to former First Lady.</P>
<P>     The set-up seems foolproof: team Shirley MacLaine with Nicolas
Cage.  She's cranky presidential widow Tess Carlisle; he's
straight-laced Service man Doug Chesnic.  She likes to play golf in
thirty-degree weather; he won't let her ride in her car unless properly
seated.</P>
<P>     She likes having him around; he wants off the assignment.</P>
<P>     With only their age differences precluding any obvious romantic
interest, this story should've scripted itself.  After all, the actors
don't need much prodding.  MacLaine has already settled into her
post-MADAME SOUSATZKA crotchety character.  And nobody, I mean
*nobody*, does a slow-burn better than Nicolas Cage.</P>
<PRE>     So what's the problem?</PRE>
<P>     GUARDING TESS gets off to a bad start.  The writers start the
story too late by opening the film at Doug's debriefing.  He's finished
his three-year tour-of-duty and he wants a more adventurous
assignment.  The First Lady has other ideas, though, and, with a phone
call to the President, demands Doug's return.</P>
<P>     That bit is fine in terms of plot device--but it presumes a
conflict that the audience hasn't seen.  We don't know what's been
going on with Tess and Doug.  We don't know what he's done or what she
hasn't.  And without TESS AND DOUG: THE EARLY YEARS to fill us in, the
bickering seems blase.</P>
<P>     Of course, the film ignores this technicality and spends about an
hour letting MacLaine and Cage circle each other like toothless
sharks.  But the nibbles are few and far between.  In fact, the film's
scene-stealer is isn't even in a scene!  That's director Hugh Wilson as
the voice of the president, who's salty tongue chastises Cage in a
couple hilarious phone-calls.</P>
<PRE>     Then something terrible happens and GUARDING TESS turns into a
drama.</PRE>
<P>     Right at the hour mark, the story gets serious and it's downhill
from there.  Plot points start swarming like agents on Reagan and,
suddenly, nothing's funny anymore.</P>
<PRE>     (Save for the film's one great line that comes at the end.)</PRE>
<P>     In the right context, the drama would've worked wonders.  But who
can believe such somber sincerity after an hour of failed frivolity?
Or, for that matter, Nicolas Cage shooting off people's toes?  The
shifting tone renders GUARDING TESS almost unwatchable.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    GUARDING TESS is horribly misfired comedy that never
                recovers from a radical "tone shift" in mid-film.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
