<P>     JOE'S APARTMENT started life as a short film on MTV.  And, while I 
haven't seen that production, it seems about the right length for this 
premise, which is too thin to sustain a full-length feature.  Even 
though JOE'S APARTMENT runs a slim seventy-nine minutes, it seems 
hopelessly padded.  There's not enough story here for something half 
that length, so we're subjected to numerous pointless and irritating 
song-and-dance numbers designed to nudge the lame plot towards its 
conclusion. </P>
<P>     The film doesn't start off badly.  In fact, during the first half-
hour, there's a quirky comic momentum.  When we first meet Joe (Jerry 
O'Connell), he has just arrived in New York City from his home state of 
Iowa.  He doesn't have much money, and what little he possesses, is 
quickly removed by the locals (JOE'S APARTMENT delights in lampooning 
the manners and morals of New York citizens).  Soon, Joe is searching 
for a job and an affordable place to live -- neither of which is easy to 
find.  But, through a series of absurd coincidences, Joe cons his way 
into a rent-controlled, East Village apartment.  There's only one 
problem -- he has to share his pad with hundreds of singing, dancing 
cockroaches.  And, when he decides to bring his new girlfriend, Lily 
(Megan Ward), home with him, the insect presence becomes a serious 
drawback to romance.   </P>
<P>     As I said, I like the way the film develops in the early stages, 
taking some chances and daring to be a little different.  Not much of 
the comedy is uproarious, but JOE'S APARTMENT has a few clever moments, 
at least until it loses its edge.  The cockroaches, which are the 
product of digital animation, are quite real-looking.  They're a little 
less disturbing than the genuine article because they sound like Alvin 
and the Chipmunks.  Unfortunately, the film makers seem inordinately 
fond of the little creatures, and, as a result, they quickly become 
overexposed. </P>
<P>     The film's greatest failing, however, is the manner in which it 
treats its human characters.  Joe is one of the least-interesting 
personalities to grace the screen this year.  Despite being described as 
the "dirtiest freakin' slob on the planet", he seems remarkably clean, 
orderly, and well-groomed, although I suppose the occasional smear of 
dirt on his forehead is supposed to indicate that he never bathes.  His 
girlfriend is equally bland, which means that the only two significant 
people in this film aren't worth more than a yawn or two.  Together, 
these two are more potent than a Sominex. </P>
<P>     "Big" cameos come from Robert Vaughn and Don Ho, which is a fair 
indication of the level of talent attracted by the script.  Not since 
THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE has a film deteriorated this quickly.  Good 
beginning aside, the ultimate result is that JOE'S APARTMENT is full of 
bugs. </P>
