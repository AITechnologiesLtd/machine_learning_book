<P>     Jane Horrocks delivers a show-stopping stage performance in LITTLE
VOICE, the kind worthy of the divas she honors.  In this adaptation of Jim
Cartwright's play "The Rise and Fall of Little Voice," Horrocks reprises
her stage role as L. V. (for Little Voice) Hoff, a timid young woman
living in a small seaside town in the north of England.  Still living with
her brash, bawdy mother Mari (Brenda Blethyn), L. V. rarely speaks a word
and even more rarely leaves the house.  But when she sings, tearing into
the classic Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey and Edith Piaf tunes beloved by
her late father, she is transformed, taking on the pipes and the
personality of whichever chanteuse she happens to be channeling at the
moment.</P>
<P>     The most astonishing element of Horrocks' performance is that she
gets no assistance from the original vocalists.  The actress truly can do
frighteningly dead-on recreations of Garland, Dietrich, Holliday, Monroe
and half a dozen others, and its a wonder to behold.  The showcase for
both Horrocks and her character is a performance at a run-down cabaret,
set up by Mari's current flame, small-time talent scout Ray Say (Michael
Caine).  Recognizing L. V. as his ticket to the Big Time, Ray sinks
everything he has into a one-night performance he finally coaxes out of
the reluctant girl.  And once she spots the visage of her dad in the
crowd, encouraging her, away she goes.</P>
<P>     In a live theater setting, you can imagine Horrocks' musical numbers 
being positively electrifying.  Even on-screen her transformation from
Minnie Mouse to mighty mouth is grand theater at its finest, and the
renditions of standards like "Get Happy" and "I Wanna Be Loved By You" are
extremely appealing.  It doesn't take long, however, to realize that
LITTLE VOICE is built entirely around Horrocks' admittedly impressive
party trick.  Once her centerpiece performance ends, the film starts
working desperately to tie up loose ends -- L. V.'s infatuation with her
father's memory, her relationships with her mother and an equally shy
telephone technician (Ewan McGregor), the frustrations of Ray as his one
shot at success seems about to pass him by.  As flawed as Ray and Mari 
are, they deserve better than to vanish after receiving a comeuppance.
It's frustrating watching them reduced to impediments to L. V.'s ability
finally to spread her wings (and it's not as though the bird metaphor
isn't beaten to an ugly death).</P>
<P>     It's all the more disappointing because, for most of its running
time, LITTLE VOICE doesn't seem headed that way at all.  Its eccentric
characters, while stagey, all have their goofy appeal, particularly Jim
Broadbent as the nightclub's cheesy owner/emcee.  Director Mark Herman
develops his small-town atmosphere nicely, and his adapted screenplay
keeps the humor fairly consistent.  It's actually nearly half an hour into
the film before L. V. breaks into song for the first time, allowing ample
time to build the significance of the characters and their relationships.
Then comes L. V.'s big debut, and it starts to seem that everyone else was
just part of the warm-up act.  L. V. emerges from her shell, she sings and
she changes, and about as abruptly as you can imagine, the credits begin
to roll.  LITTLE VOICE is largely diverting in its way, and Horrocks is
truly wonderful, but eventually it's somewhat disappointing.  I didn't
expect to leave the theater feeling that an ensemble story had been turned
into a one-woman show of Judymania.</P>
