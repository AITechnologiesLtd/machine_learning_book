<PRE>BULWORTH
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>After a longer than usual absence from the big screen, Warren Beatty has
returned in a chancy political comedy.  And while it's not bad when he's
aiming for laughs, the movie switches gears halfway through, attempting
to be an earnest political drama...a move that just doesn't fly.</P>
<P>California Senator Jay Billingston Bulworth (Warren Beatty) is suffering
a nervous breakdown during the last weekend before the Democratic
primary.  He has lost the idealism of his youth, and is jaded by the
flood of politically correct sound bytes which monopolize his life.  His
depression gets deep enough that he hires a hitman to assassinate him
before the primary.</P>
<P>His final weekend is a liberating one for him.  No future means no
political repercussions, and Senator Bulworth decides to finally speak
his mind.  No topic is safe as he bluntly expresses his filter-free
views on race relations, socialism, the entertainment industry, and
corporate campaign contributions.</P>
<P>At this point, the movie is on a roll...and at this point, it falters.
Rather than sticking with the funny concept of a politician finally
speaking his mind, the film gets high minded, and he begins speaking the
"truth" (or at least Warren Beatty's version of it).  By the time the
film trots out the eternally wise homeless man (Amiri Baraka) and the
soft-hearted drug dealer (Don Cheadle), you know it's gone down the
wrong path.</P>
<P>Until then, the film does have several good barbs, and Beatty gives a
mostly amusing performance.  This time around, he takes a
"warts-and-all" approach to filmmaking (obviously sensitive to the soft
lighting criticisms he received for Love Affair).  However, he still
can't resist placing a romantic angle in this unromantic film.  This
time around, Halle Berry plays his love interest, a campaign volunteer
with an agenda of her own, in a subplot that just doesn't float with the
rest of the movie.</P>
<P>Even though the romance doesn't quite fit, Berry does a decent job with
her role.  As do most of the supporting cast, including talents such as
Paul Sorvino, Jack Warden and Isaiah Washington.  However, the standout
here is Oliver Platt, as Bulworth's frazzled campaign manager, trying to
make some sort of sense of his boss' new enlightenment.</P>
<P>For a political comedy to work, it either needs to forswear any
political message, or at least make it subservient to the humor.
Bulworth doesn't follow this advice (or not for long, anyway), and
crashes and burns just when it should be hitting new heights.</P>
