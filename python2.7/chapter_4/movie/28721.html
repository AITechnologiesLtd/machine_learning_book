<PRE>THE CIRCLE (Dayereh)
--------------------</PRE>
<P>As credits roll over a black screen, we hear the sounds of childbirth.
A white room appears where a white window is slid open on a white door by
a white garbed nurse.  A black clad grandmother inquires about her daughter's
baby.  'It's a girl,' she's told.  Hoping for better news, the grandmother
tells another member of the hospital staff she hasn't been told the sex of
her grandchild.  When she receives the news a second time, she despairs that
the in-laws will be furious.  Director Jafar Panahi ("The White Balloon")
continues to make his point about the lives of Iranian women by crossing
over multiple storylines in "The Circle."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>As another female family member rushes down the hospital's spiral staircase
to 
the street, she crosses paths with Nargess (Nargess Mamizadeh), Arezou
(Maryiam Palvin Almani) and a third woman attempting to make a public phone 
call.  When a man asks 'You two alone?' as he passes, the third friend demands
an apology, creating a street incident which results in her arrest.  Arezou
and Nargess watch from a hiding place as they are already on the run.  We
learn that they've been released from prison, although never their crime.
Arezou is afraid that her son couldn't handle seeing her after two years,
while
Nargess, only eighteen, just dreams of reaching Sarab, an edenic part of Iran
where she'll reunite with her brother.  They're also trying to reach a
friend, 
Pari, for help.</P>
<P>Arezou insists Nargess take their money for the journey and vanishes.  After
dealing with all sorts of problems obtaining a ticket as a woman alone,
Nargess
takes five minutes to buy her brother a gift, but must flee when she sees
police checking passengers getting on the bus.  She finally finds Pari's
house,
but is told off by a male family member.  As Nargess runs down the alley and
out of the film, Pari (Fereshteh Sadr Orfani) sneaks out of her front door 
while her brother and father argue over her fate.</P>
<P>Pari visits a female friend (Monir Arab) selling tickets at a movie theater
and we soon discover that these two also have been imprisoned.  Pari's
friend's
husband obtained a second wife while she was jailed, yet she's comfortable
with the idea and the second wife arrives and drives Pari to meet with 
another friend, an emergency room nurse (Elham Saboktakin).  Pari is in
dire straits as she's pregnant, but her friend, married to a doctor at the
hospital, is too fearful of his reaction to help.</P>
<P>Pari walks the streets and sees a mother with a well dressed little girl as
she enters a hotel lobby.  When she exits, the little girl is crying,
abandoned.  Pari finds the mother (Fatemeh Naghavi) distraught, watching
the scene from behind a car (reminding us of Arezou and Nargess earlier).  
She's trying to make a better life for her daughter, but always fails to 
really leave.  This time she succeeds and cinematographer Bahram Badakshani's 
camera follows her as she says farewell to Pari and accepts a ride from a
male 
stranger, a move that causes her to be pulled over at a roadblock where
another 
woman (Mojgan Faramarzi), clearly a prostitute, is already being held.  As
this 
last woman is processed into prison, Panahi ironically suggests she may be
the 
only free woman in his story.</P>
<P>Director/editor Jafar Panahi's Venice 2000 Golden Lion winner is a powerful 
statement about the oppression of women in Iran (banned within its own
country), yet also celebrates their sisterhood.  Panahi and writer Kambuzia 
Partovi suggest strong themes with such simple devices as unlit cigarettes.
Their failure to tell us what these women have been jailed for strengthens
the story because as we witness the difficulty being a woman in Iran brings
to 
such simple tasks as buying a bus ticket, we realize that whatever their 
transgressions are, they would be viewed as trivial in Western society.</P>
<P>Cinematographer Bahram Badakshani employs a very fluid camera style as he
tails his subjects through city streets.  He and director Panahi visually
reinforce the circular nature of the film with spiral staircases and 
round balconies.  Badakshani captures many striking images, such as Nargess
running through a terminal, billowing black and clutching a shirt box or
an old balloon seller holding the hand of a tearful little girl as a wedding
party streams by.</P>
<P>The women of "The Circle" will break your heart while opening your eyes
to their plight.</P>
