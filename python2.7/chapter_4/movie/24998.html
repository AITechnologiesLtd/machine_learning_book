<P>Master car thief  Memphis (Nicolas Cage) quit the racket some years 
ago because he did not want his impressionable junior brother  Kip to 
follow in his footsteps (or tire tracks). He is now an honest gas 
station owner (I think) who teaches kids how to race go-karts.  But 
he comes out of retirement when Kip (who, alas, did join the 
underworld), is about to be punished by getting compacted within a 
car at a junk yard. The yard (and more) belongs to master thug 
Calitri (a British import). He is Kip's boss and a caricature of 
demented villainy,  Calitri about to punish Kip with extreme 
prejudice for non-performance of heist duties. He can only be saved 
if senior brother Memphis can steal, pronto, 50 classic cars to be 
shipped abroad.</P>
<P>It's a race against time, with clocks, watches and the countdown 
regularly printed on the screen. Memphis, in record time, assembles a 
regiment of "colorful" gang members, most of them from his old 
organization, many of them having gone straight (it's like an 
epidemic), some of them new faces. And the big heist is on: the 
gathering of the tribes, the planning, the introduction of an able 
cop who will play Nemesis, the complication presented by other 
thieves, the actual execution of the project.</P>
<P>It's all miserably, poorly, incoherently strung together. The 
characters as well as the cars are interchangeable. Nothing is 
elaborated, or at least explained. Heist movies have an educational, 
how-to-do-it function, but here not a single instructional detail is 
delved upon or even vaguely illustrated. The car chases are generic, 
lacking specificity,  and interchangeable. If the projectionist were 
to mix his or her reels it would make no difference, cause no 
problems.</P>
<P>This incoherence contributes a great deal to the film's total lack of 
interest, suspense or even sub-suspense.</P>
<P>Is all this dull? Yes, but the noise can keep you awake and 
especially --in some cases-- your curiosity to see if a car that your 
daddy or your pal Jake's granddaddy once owned (for we're talking 
here about a pre- and low--teens audience, the only one possible) is 
among the "classic" vehicles on the screen.</P>
<P>The film is a sort of remake of the 1974 "Gone in 60 Seconds," the 
first (of two or three movies) made by H.B. Halicki. That was a movie 
of chases and crashes shown in drive-ins and said to have become a 
sort of cult-film in some circles. Halicki produced, wrote, directed, 
starred, did stunts and everything else in his movie. (Does this make 
him an "auteur"?) He died  (1989) in a stunt accident while filming 
the sequel "Gone in 60 Seconds 2." His widow's name appears in the 
end-credits of the remake, as one of the executive producers.</P>
<P>The cast of the current flick is as dull as any, including Angelina 
Jolie who plays (?) the "de rigueur" one gal in the otherwise 
all-male/macho gang. He role is (to quote someone else's film) "Less 
than Zero." Her main function is to pout thick lips and to slow down 
the action.</P>
<P>The director comes from TV commercials (if you haven't guessed this 
already) with one feature to his credit, the actioneer "Kalifornia," 
(1993) which, I am told, has a certain following.</P>
<P>"Gone" is a  Jerry Bruckheimer  production. JB has a record of 
spectacular money-makers, most of them summertime action flicks. 
Among his latest: "Crimson Tide" (1995), "The Rock" (1996), "Con Air" 
(1997), Enemy of the State (1998), "Armageddon" (1999).</P>
<P>Other Bruckheimers coming in the summer of 2000 "Coyote Ugly" and 
"Remember the Titans."   Caveat emptor.</P>
