<P>Susan Granger's review of "BEFORE NIGHT FALLS"</P>
<P>  Spain's most acclaimed young actor, Javier Bardem, makes his
American debut in this cinematic parable and portrait of Reinaldo
Arenas, who was persecuted for literary and sexual transgressions in
Cuba. A writer and homosexual, Arenas was perceived as a threat to
Fidel Castro on both counts. After escaping from the haunting
Kafkaesque nightmare of the notorious El Morro prison, he tried
unsuccessfully to flee Cuba by inner tube before emigrating to the
United States in the 1980 Mariel boatlift of "undesirables." Arenas
settled in New York's Greenwich Village where, suffering from AIDS, he
committed suicide at the age of 47. Julian Schnabel ("Basquiat")
writes and directs this righteously honest, impressionistic biography
with intelligence, delicacy and craftsmanship, beginning with Arenas's
rural childhood that was marked by an idyllic communion with
nature. With cinematographers Xavier Perez Grobet and Guillermo Rosas,
Schnabel utilizes various film stocks and colorations but without the
flashiness of Steven Soderberg's "Traffic." While exploring Arenas's
obsession with indiscriminate sex (he claimed to have had 5,000 lovers
by age 25), the screenplay, however, offers little analysis or
explanation for Arenas's quirks of character. Although Schnabel
originally envisioned Benicio Del Toro as Arenas, it's Bardem's
dynamic, astonishing performance that elevates the dreariness and
depression of the fragmented tale, along with Sean Penn and Johnny
Depp's cameos. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Before Night
Falls" is a strong, poetic, imaginative 8, representing freedom of
expression in form and content. His cry, "I'm a citizen of
nowhere...the State Department declared me a citizen of nowhere, so
legally I don't exist," resonates.</P>
