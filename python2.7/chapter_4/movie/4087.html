<PRE>                           DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Walter Mosely's Easy Rawlins
          detective stories come to the screen in a
          moderately complex mystery about a missing woman
          who figures into an election.  Denzel Washington is
          likable as an L.A. factory worker who gets pulled
          into the search and involved in murder.  The film
          is strong on atmosphere and paints an appealing
          picture of the post-war black community.  Rating:
          high +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It's a hot summer night in L.A.  Somewhere across town Philip
Marlowe is getting too close to the truth.  And he is also getting a
mouthful of knuckles for his trouble.  But that doesn't matter here
because this story is about Easy Rawlins.  And Easy isn't even a
private dick.  Not yet anyway.  Right now Rawlins is just another
factory worker from Texas who likes to go around in a sleeveless
undershirt.  In fact, he is not even that.  He's had a little hard luck
so Douglas Air is building their airplanes without his help, and he is
trying to get by without their paycheck.  With a bank account that's
crawling under a duck, perhaps Easy is getting a little careless about
whom he lets pay him and what he has to do for the money.  In 1948
L.A. that just isn't Einstein-caliber thinking.  So maybe his job
tonight does smell like yesterday's fish, but at least it is easy
enough and pays enough.  Too much, in fact.  Easy is looking for the
mayor's missing girlfriend.  Losing her is making the mayor feel so bad
he's not even going to run for reelection.  That's what the newspaper
says.  But somebody thinks she has a taste for black men and is hanging
out in Easy's part of town.  Easy is getting a C-note just for the
looking for her.  But the next few days are going to get tough as a
one-dollar steak for Easy.  He is going to be involved in murder and
gunplay and crooked politicians.  And he isn't even a private dick.
Yet.</P>
<P>     Holding the megaphone was Carl Franklin of ONE FALSE MOVE.  That
film showed Franklin had a taste for the rough stuff.  But this job
didn't call for quite so much.  Maybe some gunplay.  What it called for
was late '40s atmosphere.  For that he got Tak Fujimoto, a good man
with a camera.  And Fujimoto lathered the '40s feel on like he had to
use it up.  He had shot Denzel Washington before on the PHILADELPHIA
job.  Washington slipped into the role of Easy like it was a suit cut
just for him.  But muscling in on his scenes is Tom Sizemore, whose
creepy panache grabs the eye like a zoot suit at a monastery.  Lagging
behind is Jennifer Beals as a femme fatale, playing it stiff as a rusty
gate hinge.</P>
<P>     DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS was the first of Walter Mosley's Easy
Rawlins novels, and Franklin wrote the script as if the series was a
meal ticket he was expecting to punch again.  While Franklin's telling
of the story gives it some twists, they seemed not so much after seeing
THE USUAL SUSPECTS with a plot that's tangled like a five-year-old's
first fishing line.  But Franklin is playing the first Easy Rawlins
story with just some easy-to-take twists and some openings like he is
hoping to be invited back.  Easy is not just a black Philip Marlowe.
Mosely and Franklin give him a simple charm and the sly smarts to make
him a character worth seeing again.  Not so welcome is Rawlin's
sidekick Mouse, played by Don Cheadle.  Mouse is a loose cannon with a
looser gun and has all the appeal of green mold on a stick of butter.</P>
<PRE>     DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS was a likable piece of noir and racks up a
high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
