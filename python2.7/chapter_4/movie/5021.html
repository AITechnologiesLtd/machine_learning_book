<PRE>                        JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a film that is creative and
          bizarre, but curiously off-center and unengaging.
          Disney Studios and Tim Burton bring Roald Dahl's
          off-beat children's fantasy about a fantastic
          trans-Atlantic peach flight to the screen.  The
          film seems to be trying to recapture some of the
          originality that THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS
          had.  However, Caroline Thompson's hand is sadly
          missed in the writing, and the Randy Newman score
          lacks the energy that Danny Elfman would have given
          it.  There is nothing memorable at all about the
          songs. JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is more a
          curiosity than an entertainment.  Rating:  0 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     Tim Burton makes two types of films.  One type has plots that are
concatenations of really odd scenes, strong on visual composition, but
without much story to glue the scenes together.  His other type of
films are the ones written by Caroline Thompson.  Thompson has a way of
sewing together weird images into a story that has emotional impact.
JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is an attempt to follow up the excellent THE
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS with another weird animation piece.  Perhaps
this time Thompson was off directing her terrific adaptation of BLACK
BEAUTY.  Or perhaps producer Burton may have felt he did not need
Thompson's story since he was adapting a book by Roald Dahl and only
needed to turn it into a script.  In any case her hand is sorely missed
in this film of an animated boy and friends who seem to be magical
giant versions of garden "pests."</P>
<P>     Watching the film, the viewer is never quite sure where the plot
is going in this story with its plot turns that border on a psychedelic
dream with a slight fairy tale quality.  As the story opens, James is a
very contented and well-adjusted little live-action boy.  He is living
happily with his loving parents who promise to take him from England to
see New York City.  Then they are suddenly eaten by a mysterious
mystical rhinoceros.  James is forced to go live with his two aunts,
overly-painted grotesques who seem to hate children and garden pests
about equally.  James, on the other hand, rather likes spiders and
other creepy- crawlies.  His aunts feed him on fish heads and place him
in virtual slavery while they sit around each day admiring themselves
and finding ways to make James more miserable.  Luckily, however, a
mysterious man gives James some magical green glowing crocodile tongues
which when accidentally dropped cause a tree to sprout a peach the size
of a house.  (I'm really not making this up, you know!)  When the peach
opens a hole, James goes in and turns into an animated boy who meets
friends who are a spider, a centipede, a grasshopper, a ladybug, and a
worm.  When the peach gets loose and rolls into the sea, James is off
to try to find New York City with the enthusiastic animals he has met.
Along the way the crew has to fight dangers like mechanical sharks.</P>
<P>     Paul Terry has the title role (well, at least the first half of
the title) and is the main character, but being a child gets eighth
billing.  He gets his revenge by having absolutely no voice when called
on to sing, though he does just fine in the acting scenes.  Top billing
goes to major actors who voiced the animated creatures in the peach,
not that they are really there for anything but marquee value.  The
voices are Simon Callow as the erudite Grasshopper; Richard Dreyfuss as
the cigar-chomping, low-brow centipede; Jane Leeves as the Ladybug;
Susan Sarandon as the resourceful spider; and David Thewlis (of NAKED
and RESTORATION) as the Earthworm.  The writing gives none of these
creatures much personality beyond funny voices and only the most
threadbare of characterizations.  A little better characterization goes
to Joanna Lumley and Miriam Margolyes as the two aunts, though that is
perhaps because we get to see them in live-action.  Also a cameo role
goes to Jack Skellington, the main character of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE
CHRISTMAS.</P>
<P>     The film does better with its visualization than it does with its
story, but those who were hoping for the detailed careful work of THE
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS will be disappointed.  The animation in that
film was a genuine tour-de-force, with something interesting happening
in just about every corner of the screen in nearly every frame.  There
were a lot of throw-away humor and clever ideas in the animation that
is just missing from the animation scenes here.  The live-action scenes
have some very nice stylized sets.  Even in the animation scenes there
is a great variety of visual styles from scene to scene.  Be warned
there is a lot in this film that younger children may find frightening.
There is a lot that the adults in the audience will find unusual, but
much of it just does not quite work.  (Be aware there is one more
bizarre little final scene for those who sit though the credits.)</P>
<P>     The story of JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is unusual and creative,
often a stylistic plus, but here there just is not very much to chew on
in the story and nobody to really care about.  It is hard to imagine
that the loss that James suffers at the beginning of the film is in any
degree offset by what James gains in the course of the film.  The
story, which I am told varies a great deal from the book, just is not a
very good one.  I rate this film, on the basis of some of the more
interesting visuals, a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
