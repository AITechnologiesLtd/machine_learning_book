<PRE>"How about Oklahoma?"
                - Tim Robbins to Jennifer Jason Leigh, after she slaps
                  him for suggesting THE KING AND I.</PRE>
<P>     THE HUDSUCKER PROXY is the most technically accomplished film that
you're likely to see this year.  And it's also the coldest.</P>
<P>     Courtesy of a believe-it-or-not partnership with producer Joel
Silver--whose films typically have high body-counts and low Roman
numerals--Minnesota twins Joel and Ethan Coen have gift-wrapped and
delivered their biggest tinkertoy-set film yet.  HUDSUCKER is just as
calculated as BLOOD SIMPLE, just as manic as RAISING ARIZONA, just as
showy as MILLER'S CROSSING, and just as stylish as BARTON FINK.</P>
<P>     It looks good and moves good and sounds good, but, for the first
time in five films, it feels awful.</P>
<P>     HUDSUCKER opens with a desperate young man stepping onto the ledge
of a skyscraper on a snowy New York New Year's Eve, 1958.  His name is
Norville Burnes (Robbins) and the story recounts how he came onto that
ledge of Hudsucker Industries.</P>
<P>     Fresh off the bus from Muncie, Indiana, Norville gets his start in
the mail room on the very same day that president Waring Hudsucker
(Durning) takes a flying leap from the 44th floor.  Or 45th, if you
include the mezzanine.  The executive board--headed by schemer Sidney
J. Mussberger (Newman)--wants to forestall a public takeover and
installs Norville as a puppet president to lower investor confidence.
The theory, of course, is that Norville is an idiot without an idea in
his head.  Said theory holds right up until the new head of Hudsucker
invents the hula hoop....</P>
<P>     The first half of HUDSUCKER moves just as quick as anything in the
Coen comedy RAISING ARIZONA.  Eye-popping gags and breathtaking
set-pieces whiz by at a breakneck speed that's good for a solid hour of
goofy giggles.</P>
<P>     (Not to mention the uncomfortable realization that the Winterland
Wunderkinds *throwaway* more tricks in one film than many directors use
in a lifetime.)</P>
<P>     Complimenting the visual wizardry is page after page of tart, ripe
dialogue that moves as fast as the film.  The Coens love old movies, no
duh, and everyone in HUDSUCKER hurries through their harangues.  Best
Blabbers are Jennifer Jason Leigh, as a reporter-in-disguise with a
Katheryn Hepburn accent, and John Mahoney as her editor.</P>
<P>     The characters in HUDSUCKER look sharp and talk smart--but, with
few exceptions, they never radiate much warmth or humanity.  Which is a
problem when the film slows and the characters stand revealed and the
story strives for a moral message.  Even *with* the Capraesque ending,
THE HUDSUCKER PROXY nevers really warms up.</P>
<PRE>     *That* said, the finale is a gas.  But not in the way it should
be.</PRE>
<P>     The last fifteen minutes of HUDSUCKER are a sheer delight as they
mark the return of a supporting character who beams with more life than
any of the prominent players.  Without spoiling the surprise, this
person is the *real* flesh and blood in a towering set of tinkertoys
and he makes you smile because he shows that there's at least a little
heart buried under all the ice.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:    THE HUDSUCKER PROXY is a great-looking, cold-hearted
                movie that should appeal to film fans more than the
                mainstream movie-goer.  Highly recommended for technical
                appeal, alone.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
