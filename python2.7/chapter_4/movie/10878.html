<PRE>                               DECEIVER
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule:  A prostitute has been murdered and a
          self-admitted liar is the chief suspect, in spite
          of little evidence.  This is a complex story about
          the nature of truth in which things are rarely what
          they seem.  The problem is that the clues are not
          conclusive and are left contradictory.  This is a
          USUAL SUSPECTS wannabe but is not nearly so well-
          written.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Jonas and Josh Pate co-wrote and co-directed this enigmatic crime
film.  Two pieces that together make up one dead prostitute, Elizabeth
(played by Renee Zellweger in flashbacks), have been found.  The police
investigation has turned up a most unusual suspect, Wayland (Tim Roth).
Wayland is the misfit heir to a textile fortune.  The evidence tying
Wayland to the prostitute is very weak: she simply died with his phone
number in her pocket.  But Wayland acts guilty and a two-man team of
policemen administer a series of polygraph lie detector tests to
Wayland.  In little flashbacks we get to know the policemen.  There is
Kennesaw (Michael Rooker) and Braxton (Chris Penn).  Each has
complications in his life at the moment. Kennesaw has a beautiful but
wayward wife (Rosanne Arquette) that he does not want to lose, but he
has fits of rage about the situation.  Braxton is a younger man, a
security guard turned cop.  We are explicitly his IQ is a lowly 101 and
he certainly is not one of the more promising policemen on the force.
He also has gotten into trouble with a flamboyant bookie (played by--
are your ready for this?--Ellen Burstyn) and he desperately needs money
that he hopes to borrow from Kennesaw.  Braxton and Kennesaw work as a
team to try to break down Wayland, but it is not clear that even his
answers on the polygraph are dependable. Even on the polygraph Wayland
may be playing a deadly game of deception.</P>
<P>     Tim Roth is, of course, second only to Steve Buscemi as the king
of bizarre roles in arthouse films.  His smooth strange manner is just
about right for this film.  He maintains a wall around himself inside
which he remains aloof even from the audience.  Most of the rest of the
casting is prosaic.  By far the most interesting choice is to have
Ellen Burstyn as the bookie and kingpin Mook, complete with glitter
eye-shadow.  It is, of course, in stark contrast to the matronly roles
we expect of her, and while we see her in only two scenes, her face is
the one image of the film that sticks in my memory.  Photography by
Bill Butler is dark and moody.</P>
<P>     DECEIVER is clearly an attempt to make another puzzle crime film
in the tradition of THE USUAL SUSPECTS.  It is the sort of story that
does not really begin until the film is over and the audience has all
the clues and then can start trying to piece them together.  Generally
that is a very good touch, but there has to be at least one real
solution and way to get to it.  It goes wrong, however, in DECEIVER
because the clues do not seem to lead in a coherent way to a solution.
It is an art in a puzzle story to leave enough clues about what is
going on so that the viewer can piece together one or more possible
satisfying explanations but at the same time make the explanation
complex enough that piecing together the clues is a challenge. One had
the feeling that on a second watching of THE USUAL SUSPECTS the viewer
could make all of the clues fit.  (And in fact it was not difficult on
the second viewing.)  A second viewing of DECEIVER on the other hand
seems much less promising because there will still be too many holes to
piece together the story.  At the same time what we have already seen
seems contradictory.  There seem to be no explanations for what we have
seen that are both coherent and interesting.</P>
<P>     The Pates are trying a little too hard to surprise the us at the
expense of logic in the script.  Still while the illusion of the puzzle
film lasts this film is intriguing.  I rate it a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale
and low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
