<PRE>                          Two Summer Adaptations
                           MAVERICK and        THE CROW
                      Two film reviews by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  As two adaptations from other media,
     these show        that there may be a lot        of potential for adapting
     comic books to the        screen,        but 1950s television is        starting
     to        be mined out.  Certainly in this case we have a        good
     adaptation        of a comic book        and a much less        successful
     cinematic TV show.         Ratings: MAVERICK gets        a 0, THE CROW a        +1
     (-4 to +4).  However, MAVERICK may        be more        appropriate for        a
     wider audience.</PRE>
<PRE>     It        is now no longer much of a novelty to see either a 1950s television
show like "Maverick" or        a comic        like "The Crow"        adapted        into a film version.
One would expect that of the two, it would be easier to        be faithful to the
style of the dramatic medium on        the screen.  However, even speaking as
someone        who has        not read "The Crow," I can say that at least in        this
instance the comic book        form seems to have been        better represented on the
screen than the        TV show.</PRE>
<PRE>     THE CROW seems set        in a world where it is constantly a rainy night        in
Hell.  Everything seems        a little rain-drenched in the world of THE CROW, but
somehow        the villainous Top Dollar (played by Michael Wincott) manages to get
buildings to burn every        year on        October        30--Devil's Night--for clients who
are willing to pay Top Dollar for the service.        His thugs torch        a building,
raping a woman and murdering her and her husband-to-be,        Eric (Brandon Lee).
As myth        would have it a        crow transports        their souls to the after-world,        but
returns        Eric's soul one        year later for him to exact terrible revenge on        the
evil gang.  (One has to        ask oneself if the indignant dead do sometimes
return,        why were there not armies of indignant dead chasing after Stalin and
Hitler.         Even murder and arson are crimes less deserving of the        Crow-
treatment.)</PRE>
<PRE>     Visually this film        is a powerful adaptation of the        comic book form        to
the screen.  Alex Proyas directs with many short cuts highly evocative of
comic book panels.  Every once in a while he will dwell        on one majestic
image, like the        figure of Eric standing        in a huge circular, broken window.
He pauses on this image        just about as long as a        reader of the comic would
pause on that panel.  The screenplay takes little time to humanize any of
its characters beyond perhaps making a little girl seem        likable.  This is
one more story full of sound and fury and striking visual images, but it has
little core and        no characters of any emotional interest.  Still        it is bound
to be remembered as a signpost showing the way to translate effectively        the
characteristics        of a comic book        to the screen.        It deserves a +1 on the        -4
to +4 scale.  Extreme violence makes this a film for a narrow audience but
it is a        far more interesting transition        to the screen than is MAVERICK.</PRE>
<PRE>     Though more acceptable for        a wider        audience, MAVERICK is a        film that
also lacked core--but here it was needed far more.  The        TV show        covered        the
adventures of two brothers, Bret and Bart Maverick, two        likable        gamblers.
Bret was played        by James Garner.  When Warner Brothers needed someone to
play Pappy Maverick, father of Bret and        Bart, he too was played        by James
Garner.         (There        was a third brother, Brent, introduced after Garner walked
off the        series.)  "Maverick" was played        straight for a couple of seasons,
then a humorous        description in one of the scripts gave Garner the idea to
play that scene        tongue-in-cheek, a style that remained with him        the rest of
his career.  But even with his good-humored acting, the        stories        usually        were
fairly well-written and        well-thought-out.  They        were a lot better than the
string of gag scenes that William Goldman wrote        into the screenplay of the
new adaptation.         Mel Gibson as the new Bret Maverick goes from one minor
adventure to another trying to get together the        money to be in a giant high
stakes poker game.  There was no real plot complication        in this        film until
the last 40 minutes. Writer William Goldman has        some good fun, and some        that
works not quite        so well, doing to Western cliches what he did to adventure
cliches        with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, though        they work only occasionally here.
(Perhaps the best scene        of the film is done in an Indian language and
subtitled, lampooning Indian acting in so many bad films.)  Far        too many
gags fall flat and plot        devices        fall flatter.  Most of the film        is told        in
flashback by a Bret with a noose around        his neck.  When        this threat is
resolved Bret has cheated the hangman not nearly so badly as Goldman has
cheated        the audience.  James Garner is also on-hand and        playing        a major
character, perhaps to keep an eye on what his Bret is up to.  Playing lawman
Zane Cooper, Garner is pretty much the laconic character he has        always
played.         Jodie Foster plays Annabelle Bransford, as capable of the double-
cross as any of        the men.  There        is certainly some fun here and some nice
nature photography not really characteristic of        the series.  But with so
little story this one gets no better than a 0 on the -4        to +4</PRE>
