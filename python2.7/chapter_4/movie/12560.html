<PRE>"Godzilla" - A Monstrosity</PRE>
<P>If you think that a nuclear test ban treaty would be in the best
interest of everyone, then you would be correct in supporting it.
Indeed Godzilla is a creation, or mutation if you will, that is a direct
result from too much testing.  The radiation fallout somehow mutates the
DNA of certain creatures which produce odd side effects.  Abnormal
growth is one of those effects, as explained by Dr. Nick Tatopoulos
(Matthew Broderick), a specialist studying the effects of nuclear
fallout on animals.  Tatopoulos is brought to the Caribbean where large
lizard-like footprints were discovered.  "Was I just standing in a
footprint," he asks incredulously.  There is more unbelievable evidence.
An ocean vessel has run aground.  It appears to have been torn apart,
gigantic claw marks can be seen along the exterior of the ship, and a
traumatized survivor blurts out something to the doctors that sound like
"gaw-chill-ah".</P>
<P>Our anticipation grows.  We want to see what we're paying for.  Finally,
the overgrown reptile makes itself known by entering Manhattan.  He is
an impressive beast.  Cars get squashed, buildings crumble, and the
surprised citizens run for their lives.  The military and Tatopoulos
hurry and set up a command post, and they begin to develop a plan to
attack it.  Tatopoulos is also reunited with old college crush Audrey
(Maria Pitillo).  She left him long ago, but still feels something for
the quiet scientist.  As a reporter wannabee, her career is presently
going nowhere, and she sees this as an opportunity for her big story. </P>
<P>Tatopoulos does make a scary discovery, learning that Godzilla has come
to NYC to nest.  A new species is being born, and if they don't act
fast, New Yorkers will become food for the scores of reptilian offspring
that are close to hatching.  Time is running out.  The military can not
find Godzilla.  Tatopoulos can not find the nest.  And the audience can
not find a story.</P>
<P>The problem with Godzilla is that it is a 30-minute effects extravaganza
stretched out into a 2-hour movie.  There's a feeling of ineptness that
wafts through the movie.  Military might can't bring down the creature.
Useless politicians look on in dismay.  The citizens want to return back
to the city despite that fact that baby Godzillas are looking for food
and that practically every building is in need of some major repairs.
Meanwhile,  Broderick's and Patillo's characters are so vapid that we
become more interested in the secondary characters, such as Animal (Hank
Azaria) who throws common sense to the wind in order to get exclusive
video footage and Phillipe Roche (Jean Reno), a mysterious character
whose purpose is kept a secret until the last 30 minutes.  But that's
not to say that Godzilla isn't visually spectacular.  Army helicopters
chase Godzilla through the city streets.  They fire their weapons, which
manages to destroy everything except the 50-foot nuisance.  Submarines
can't even catch him.  And the best sequence comes at the end of the
movie when Godzilla chases the scientist and his friends who are fleeing
through the city in a taxi.  Nuclear or atomic testing may have resulted
in Godzilla, but I would suspect that significant movie audience testing
would have never yielded the same mistake.</P>
