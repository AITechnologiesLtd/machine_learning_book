<P>Engaging Characters and Strong Acting Almost Make Up
For a Plot That Goes Nowhere, Fast </P>
<PRE>The Devil's Own
Starring Harrison Ford, Brad Pitt, Ruben Blades, Margaret
Colin, Treat Williams and Paul Ronan.
Columbia Pictures/ Rated R </PRE>
<P>THE most surprising thing about The Devil's Own is certainly not the
plot, which in terms of predictability often places somewhere between
sunrise and taxes. Instead, the greatest surprise is the very fact that
this rumored Hollywood disaster, this IRA version of Heaven's Gate, a
film which seemed destined to become known as MacIshtar, is actually
not that bad after all. With two weeks to go before its March 26th
release, The Devil's Own has long been considered dead on arrival.
Reports of the film's demise have been widespread, beginning with the
shooting of the film in New York last summer and climaxing dramatically
in late January with public denunciations by one of the film's two
leading men, Brad Pitt.</P>
<P>"Twenty pages of dogshit," was Pitt's recollection of the Devil's Own
script, as told to Newsweek.</P>
<P>"[The Devil's Own] was the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking -- if
you can even call it that -- that I've ever seen. I couldn't believe
it. I don't know why anyone would want to continue making that movie."</P>
<P>In addition to Mr. Pitt's complaints were the howls of Hollywood
journalists, horrified by The Devil's Own many delays, script rewrites,
and most of all, budget figures.</P>
<P>"The budget has soared from an estimated sixty million dollars to
ninety million," reported The New Yorker, almost four months and surely
another few million dollars ago, in November. The gossip columnists'
condemnation of director Alan Pakula's spending habits were such that
one would think the money was theirs. Haven't there been plenty of
on-set disasters which turned out to on-screen classics? What about
Apocalypse Now? Wasn't that film also a mess before it was recognized
as a great?</P>
<P>Yes, but of course that hardly means there will be a Hearts of Darkness
made about The Devil's Own. The IRA thriller is a greatly flawed mess
in search of an ending. It will most definitely be slated by the
critics and will be very lucky to break even. But as stated above, it's
not our money....</P>
<PRE>***</PRE>
<P>THE film begins in 1972 in a rural cottage outside Belfast, where we
see young Frankie McGuire listening to his dad, who is saying Grace.
The potatoes are still warm when the door is kicked in by men in
balaclavas, guns blazing. Frankie's eyes are frozen as his father --
whom we hear later was some form of republican sympathizer -- is gunned
down by the unidentified gunmen.</P>
<P>The incident is all young Frankie needs to become, within the next 20
years, the most feared of IRA weapons. A closed-door strategy meeting
among security force officials reveals as much -- the adult terrorist,
McGuire, must be brought down at all costs, the troops are informed.
Just as the 1972 killing of his father was all McGuire needed to forge
a life of mayhem, so too is that life of mayhem all the British Army
and Northern Ireland police need to custom-order the assassination of
McGuire. A policy of shoot-to-kill is put into effect.</P>
<P>As the twenty something McGuire, Pitt is a quietly seething force. With
the confidence and bravery known only to leading men, McGuire is a
daredevil in Belfast fire-fights, though all around him his IRA buddies
are shot to bits. "Where's Frankie McGuire?," hisses a menacing British
army agent, immediately recalling the "Where's Sean?" mantra of an
earlier IRA movie, 1992's Patriot Games.</P>
<P>Unlike Patriot Games, the IRA man in The Devil's Own is portrayed as
justified in his actions and decent in his intentions, although his
mission is ultimately more important than the human lives of even those
close to him. Frankie McGuire is shown to have friends and also to have
affection, but he'll gladly detonate both if the need arises.</P>
<P>This is evident when we next meet McGuire, on a missile-purchasing
mission in New York, in the spring of 1993.</P>
<P>"Isn't this crazy?," says McGuire's increasingly unsure IRA buddy,
played by Paul Ronan. "Us trying so hard to bring missiles over there,
and them only waiting to shoot us?"</P>
<P>Phelan makes a brief attempt at talking McGuire out of it all:  peace
is in the air; we'll only be killed and forgotten; and besides, isn't
New York a wonderful place? But McGuire, as determined as any Hollywood
heavy, brushes him off and sets out to buy some missiles.</P>
<P>Alan Pakula, the Devil's Own director, obviously felt it necessary to
justify his IRA character's actions even beyond the 1972 death of
Frankie McGuire's father. McGuire is shown entering Newark Airport on
February 23, 1993, a date which is surely no coincidence. In real-life
-- but not mentioned in the movie -- the date is exactly three weeks
after the first-ever U.S.  visit by republican leader Gerry Adams. It
was a grim time for Northern Ireland supporters of the IRA, which would
not declare a ceasefire for several more bloody months, on September
1st. In February, there were many within the IRA who were urging peace,
leading to the ceasefire six months later, but (the fictional) Frankie
McGuire was surely not one of them.</P>
<P>"If we could only take one of them down," laments McGuire, referring to
the flocks of Army helicopters over Northern Ireland. "Then we'd get
them to listen."</P>
<P>(Obviously, the Devil's Own screenwriters did their homework in this
regard -- judging by the real-life busts of IRA gun-running missions
over the past two decades, surface-to-air missiles has been a
priority.)</P>
<P>McGuire appropriates the name of 'Rory Devaney' (though for some reason
he doesn't bother with a disguise or even a haircut) and enters a
familiar network of sympathetic Irish Americans. Chief among them is a
wealthy and powerful judge, played by George Hearn, who is involved in
a 'Project Children'-type effort connecting wayward and unemployed
Irish youths with generous American families. New York Police sergeant
Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford), as a favor to his old friend the judge,
allows 'Rory Devaney' to crash in the basement of his suburban home.</P>
<P>Unknown to the O'Meara family, the judge is something other than a
benevolent Project Children type and 'Rory Devaney' is more than an
unemployed youth in need of a start. The judge provides a sack full of
fresh hundreds, and it's McGuire/Devaney's job to convert them into
dead helicopters.</P>
<P>It is in the O'Meara household that Devil's Own has its finest moments.
Harrison Ford plays a veteran cop in a house full of females -- his
wife, Sheila, (played by Margaret Colin) and their three daughters,
aged approximately five, eleven and perhaps fourteen. The three
daughters immediately fall in love with this mysterious
basement-dweller with the funny accent, providing some genuinely
touching domestic scenes, thankfully free of Hollywood cutesiness.
Sergeant O'Meara's high school-aged daughter is mortified when the
youngest child asks 'Devaney' at the dinner table whether he has a
girlfriend. The tension is delightfully real; tellingly, the drama over
corned beef and cabbage is much more effective than that which takes
place later, over Stingers and AK-47s.</P>
<P>As the Provo-beneath-the-stairs, McGuire moves quickly in acquiring the
goods. A plan is hatched to buy missiles from a shadowy Irish American
businessman, Billy Burke (played by Treat Williams), who toasts dead
Fenians in his shamrocked Manhattan saloon (locals will recognize the
set as the historic Old Town tavern). It is evident from the beginning
-- especially to Frankie McGuire -- that Billy Burke's loyalties are
closer to his own wallet. Without getting into specifics and giving
away too much of the plot, trouble begins when the visiting IRA men
fall afoul of the local Irish American mobsters. Frankie McGuire is
loyal to a fault, but his mobbed-up ethnic cousins are as reliable as
the weather.</P>
<P>Thus also begins the unraveling of the relationship between McGuire and
Sgt. O'Meara. There is much for O'Meara to question at this point in
his middle-aged life: the sudden realization that his NYPD partner --
played by Ruben Blades -- as well as the Irish kid in the basement, are
something other than what was advertised. The NYPD angle is merely a
distraction though, as O 'Meara copes with the newly-discovered
identity of the son he never had. It is here that the bottom starts to
fall out of The Devil's Own. Sgt.  O'Meara's loyalties and motivations
are all over the place, as if, well, as if they were taken from several
different screenplays.  The movie stumbles on to an end which is, at
best, anti-climactic, but not before Alan Pakula's production allows
the audience a little bit of fun.</P>
<P>For instance, there is the emergence on U.S. soil of a British Army
agent, identified by Harrison Ford's character as a member of the
S.A.S., or Special Air Service. In a characterization which will surely
make the London tabloids howl in protest, this character is slightly
less charming than Darth Vader. We have already seen him coldly
assassinate an already-wounded member of Frankie McGuire's IRA unit in
Belfast, and it is made clear that he is in the U.S. to do the same to
Frankie McGuire.</P>
<P>"We have already gotten everyone else in his unit," explains the SAS
agent, suggesting that McGuire's unit has resisted the rest of the
IRA's move toward peace. Sergeant O'Meara, although he disagrees
strongly with armed republicanism and is repulsed when he learns of
McGuire's involvement, nonetheless decides not to help the British
agent. This leads to a memorable confrontation between the snarling spy
from London and the narrowback cop from Brooklyn.</P>
<P>"What exactly is your relationship to Frankie McGuire?," snarls the
agent. "After all, you are Irish, are you not, Sergeant O'Meara?"
O'Meara, livid at the implication, shoots back incredulously, "Yeah,
but so's Cardinal O'Connor."</P>
<PRE>***</PRE>
<PRE>SADLY, the hissing British agent, like so much else in the
early
parts of The Devil's Own, vanishes into thin air. It is a
movie
filled with loose ends and dangling plotlines, which is surely
the
result of too many competing screenplays and egos.</PRE>
<P>Politically, The Devil's Own is likely to cause plenty of
problems overseas. There is no mention of Frankie McGuire's
unionist-minded neighbors, which must have seemed okay to
the screenwriters since Frankie McGuire seems to care far
more about military revenge than he does political ideals
(concepts such as partition or re-unification are never
discussed). The only unionist-type we meet in the entire movie
is the above-mentioned SAS agent. As regards the history of
American involvement in IRA matters, the film is more
accurate and understanding than any of Hollywood's other
recent IRA thrillers (the main ones being Patriot Games and
1994's Blown Away). Bits and pieces of the plot resemble
events in a number of real-life gun-running operations: the
early
1980s Valhalla operation out of Boston, for example, as well
as
the numerous attempts at buying Stingers over the past fifteen
years. More importantly, the character of Sergeant O'Meara
points to a depth previously unseen for his stereotype -- the
character is Irish American, somewhat sentimental, and is also
a blue-collar member of the New York City police force. Yet
this does not make him a de facto supporter of the IRA. At the
same time, neither is O'Meara blindly condemning of the IRA.
Harrison Ford's character, while disagreeing strongly with
armed republicanism, states how he understands the
anger-fueled motivations of republicans like McGuire. "Can't
they get the bastards?" O'Meara asks Frankie, referring to the
men who killed the senior McGuire, in 1972.</P>
<P>"They are the bastards," responds Frankie.</P>
<P>There's no other way but to hit them back, asserts McGuire,
and although O'Meara does not agree, he understands. Such
complexity of character, acted by a seasoned, affable
professional such as Harrison Ford, make The Devil's Own
stand out above its IRA-themed predecessors.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it is not enough. The movie's characters are
eminently engaging for the first 60% of the film, before the
plot
is pulled from beneath them like a rug. The film's ends with a
dud, when it clearly needed a bang, and is ultimately less
than
satisfying.</P>
<P>Which begs the question: it is possible for the Hollywood to
make a meaningful, character-driven IRA-themed story and
simultaneously deliver a sophisticated thriller? The jury is
still
out on that one. For better or for worse, the real-life
material
which inspires stories such as The Devil's Own will be around
long after this movie has gone to video.</P>

                       A film review by Dave Cowen
                        Copyright 1997 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>[This review contains what some may consider spoilers.  However, I feel 
 that these observations on the film could enhance the movie for first-time 
 viewers as well.  Read on at your own discretion.]</P>
<P>It's a natural human instinct to attribute cause, and when none is available,
to fill in the blanks with unfounded speculations that can be recited as 
simple truths.  At its most harmless, this human reaction to the unknown
results in superstition or meaningless legends, but at worst can engulf an 
individual with a sense of paranoia and the belief in conspiracy.  When an 
individual feels that there is no answer to a fundamental question of human 
existence, or even worse, the "meaning of life," that individual either 
shrinks into depression or, if lucky, relies on a strong community or family 
to help them through their crisis of the soul.  Unfortunately, the human 
animal has a tendency for gullibility in times of crisis, and can be easily 
lured into a community which masquerading as being there to help, is really 
there for another reason.  </P>
<P>The central irony of Todd Haynes' film SAFE is that Carol White (Julianne 
Moore), the film's main character, is in a position that many would consider 
to be more safe in life than any other in our society.  A housewife in the San 
Fernando Valley during the late 80's, Carol spends her days decorating, 
carpooling, doing aerobics and 'fruit diets'.  She has a husband with an 
advancing career, a stepson, a large European auto, and most of all, a 
spacious house protected by a huge metal gate.  Carol personifies the 
housewife we've all imagined as being the female component of an 'American 
dream family'.  What could possibly go wrong?</P>
<P>Things start to change.  Carol begins having headaches, sleeplessness, 
sensitivity to smell.  She has a coughing fit after driving behind a 
dumptruck, and later we find Carol hyperventilating while attending a 
friend's baby shower.  Repeated visits to the doctor leaves the doctor with 
the impression that Carol's symptoms are stress related, which results in a 
referral to a psychologist.  A visit to the psychologist yields little gain, 
however, when the psychologist tells Carol  "We really need to be hearing from 
you.  What's going on inside -you-," and Carol finds she has little to say.</P>
<P>When Carol speaks she speaks in fragments, as if she can not quite verbalize 
an idea.  Carol ends her fragments with question marks -- when asked if she 
has children, Carol responds "he's not my son, he's my stepson?  Rory?"  And
if questioned in an aggressive manner, or accused of something, she'll let out
a defensive "I just...", pause for a few seconds, and say something else.  
When a waitress asks "Do you know what you want," the best Carol can do is to 
say "I'll have what she's having."  Carol is not a woman who is in control of 
her life.  </P>
<P>After a draining aerobics session, Carol finds a flyer hanging on a bulletin 
board at the health club labeled DO YOU SMELL FUMES?  Carol starts attending 
seminars on chemical sensitivity, reacts during an allergy test, and becomes 
convinced that she is suffering from environmental illness.  Carol begins a 
regimen to combat the illness, fasting, popping vitamin pills, creating a 
"safe place" in her home, and carrying an oxygen tank.</P>
<P>A grand mal seizure in a dry cleaning shop sends Carol to the hospital, where
on TV she sees an infomercial for Wrenwood, a getaway for environmentally ill 
individuals which labels itself a "safe haven for troubled times".  Carol goes 
to Wrenwood, run by the leader Peter Dunning (described in the film as a 
"chemically sensitive man with AIDS") who preaches that self-help and optimism 
will help chemically sensitive people overcome their problems.  Peter, a 
charismatic speaker who lives on an extravagant house seen on a nearby hill, 
has a mantra for attendees at his center: "We are safe, and all is well in our 
world."  Carol seems to feel at home in this community, but her condition 
worsens, and ends up in a small, porcelin-lined and ventilated igloo.  </P>
<P>What most viewers of SAFE have found daunting, exasperating, or have missed 
entirely is the fact that SAFE is not only an exploration of the impossibility 
of establishing a cause to all things, but also a satire played with a poker 
face. Imagine watching Dr. Strangelove with the sound turned off -- one would 
likely consider themselves to be watching a straightforward war film, and 
without paying attention to SAFE, the film seems to have vacuous characters, 
not characters that are being mocked for their vacuity.  The late 80's 
conservative lifestyle is spoofed at every chance, from the Billy Ocean 
songs on the radio to Carol's reaction to being delivered the wrong color
of couch.  While many complain that SAFE is boring because nothing happens, 
nearly every scene contains a hint, or at best a red herring, which is 
absolutely essential in understanding the film. In fact, SAFE is a mystery
comprised entirely of clues that may be considered red herrings.</P>
<P>"We are safe, and all is well in our world."</P>
<P>I mention, at the beginning of the review, that it is natural for we as 
humans to assign cause to unknown things.  It is nearly impossible, therefore, 
for the viewer to not watch SAFE and construct the clues present into a 
hypothesis as to why she is becoming ill.  It is common for a viewer to take 
the stance that Carol is genuinely sick, victim of chemicals in the air of 
everyday life, or that it is completely psychosomatic, but I propose something 
slightly different in this review.</P>
<P>The second scene in the film is a sex scene, portraying Carol's husband Greg 
(Xander Berkeley) in the throes of passion.  We see Carol's face, impartial, 
beneath his back and his head, waiting patiently for him to finish.  When he 
is done, she gives him a chaste kiss and a pat on the back.  </P>
<P>Soon after, we find Carol wandering through her house, through the kitchens, 
where the painters are painting.  Carol asks for a glass of milk, falls down, 
and then sits at the table, taking sip after sip.  The camera pans back and
zooms in at the same time, giving a feeling of spaciousness and expansion to 
the scene.  The space around Carol feels more and more empty as she is 
dissociated from her environment.</P>
<P>Later in the film, we find Carol and Greg at a client dinner at a high-class 
restaurant, as one of Greg's business associates is telling a dirty joke.  
After the punchline, one of the other wives at the table mentions Carol not 
appreciating her husband's joke.  "Carol!" Greg says suddenly, and the camera 
finds Carol snapping back to attention from having her eyes closed.  "I'm 
sorry, I don't..." she says, pauses, and then mouths the word "sorry" to Greg. 
Carol doesn't... feel well?  Or, perhaps, Carol can't admit she doesn't
like dirty jokes.</P>
<P>Throughout the nights, Carol wanders the yard of her home when she can't 
sleep, caged in by the fence that surrounds the property.  One night, when 
walking through the front yard, she is spotted by the local security company 
and has the spotlight thrown in her face.  She quickly runs back inside the 
house.</P>
<P>Remember that Carol's son is her stepson -- she doesn't have a real son.  
When attending a baby shower, Carol is served something that is "melting all 
over."  When the final present is opened, a baby stroller, Carol begins 
hyperventilating.  Later, when at the allergists, Carol is injected with a 
number of substances that could provoke an allergic reaction.  She begins 
hyperventilating with .1 of 2 milk.  </P>
<P>Later in the film, in one of the film's last scenes, Carol is shown with her 
husband at Wrenwood, as Carol is moving into her porcelin-lined cabin.  Greg 
is walking with her, and then slips his arm around her as though to initiate a 
kiss.  Carol instantly recoils from the touch, walking back about 10 feet, 
claiming that there must be something in his shirt that she's reacting to.  
He then asks if he "at least gets a hug", which she then provides, putting 
her head onto his chest, right on the shirt.</P>
<P>I feel that Carol is faced with a crisis in her life: without having raised a
child, without having a job to do (servants perform all of the work in the 
White household), and without having any responsibilities, Carol has a vacuum 
in her life, a life with no meaning (the cinematography throughout the first 
half of the film frames the characters of the film in their houses in such a 
way to present, on screen, a visual vacuum -- people swallowed by the 
emptiness of their surroundings)  Her husband seems to have little to do with 
her except for sex, which he pressures her for in the film.  She obviously 
doesn't like the advances, and at least once in the film, uses illness as a 
way of rejecting his advances.  Her house seems like a giant cage, and she an 
animal being kept for show.  Carol is caught between not knowing what she 
wants in life, living in a society that does not provide her with any purpose 
in her life, and living in an environment that is not in any way healthy for 
her, whether it be physically or mentally.  What better way to get away then 
to leave to a camp whose bylaws promise not only isolation from chemical 
dangers, but also safety from "casual drug use and sexual interaction" between 
the patients?  Quite a few, perhaps.</P>
<P>"We are safe, and all is well in our world."</P>
<P>If SAFE's first half is a maze of ambiguities and possibilities, the film's
second half does have one clear answer -- that Wrenwood, and the type of tepid 
new-age self-help optimism that is espoused there, is quite clearly corrupt. </P>
<P>When Peter Dunning explains his ideas to his visitors, he punctuates his 
sentences with the phrase "Does that make sense?"  When he does so, it doesn't 
seem as though he's asking to make sure that he is understood, but is instead 
issuing a threat -- with a defensive tone of voice, the above phrase prevents 
anyone in the camp from challenging him.  When Dunning talks about all of the 
hatred and negativism in the world, his voice changes to a tone that expresses 
hatred and negativism towards that hatred and negativism.  When Dunning tells 
another Wrenwood visitor who expresses disgust at the chemical companies who 
made her environmentally sensitive, Dunning tells her to "Put that gun away!" 
in the most condescending way possible.  He seems to be the perfect new-age 
hypocrite, railing against the anger and hostility in the world
with anger and hostility.  Dunning advocates abandoning the world -- he speaks
about "throwing away" the newspaper and no longer watching TV so that he 
would not have to deal with the kind of messages that those media vehicles 
provide.  But what's the real reason he's recommending doing that?  It's a 
good way of keeping his flock on the farm, within the fenced-in confines
at Wrenwood.  Dunning's house on the hill, Wrenwood's glossy brochure and
extended infomercial is a sure sign that Wrenwood is not a benign not-for-
profit, but an organization intended to keep it's high-ups with a high 
incoming cashflow and a pack of admirers.  Carol has moved from one 
environment that is unhealthy for her to another.</P>
<P>Despite the new dangers present at Wrenwood, Carol is sucked in by the entire 
Wrenwood experience: the staff members there seem to be happy and full of 
life, Dunning's speeches comfort her that all is well in the world, and she 
has found a community, however artificial, where she belongs.  The 
isolationism Dunning proposes, however, has an unwanted after effect --
throughout the second half of the film, Carol's condition grows progressively 
worse.  Carol is literally shrinking.  She seems shy and more girlish, and a 
Texan accent begins to creep into her speech (she mentions earlier in the film
that she is originally from Texas, not California).  By the end of the film, 
when she has moved into the small igloo, with the tube from her oxygen tank 
providing her with "fresh air", she has returned to the womb, defenseless, 
weak, and cared for by a parent that wants nothing more than her money.  Carol 
has become afraid of the world, but instead of teaching Carol the need to take 
an active fight against adversity, either philosophically or medically, 
Wrenwood influences her to recoil into herself.  Wrenwood's philosophy, that 
in order to get better, one has to love one's self, seems like a tiny band-aid 
or placebo pill being used to try and cure a much larger problem.  What, 
ultimately, is that problem?  The vacuity of our society and anxiety over
the often invisible dangers of modern life.  In many other films or TV movies, 
Carol's final words of "I love you," would be a sure sign that all is better.  
In SAFE, that's far from the case.</P>
<P>No one is safe.  And all is not well in our world.  And when we as a society 
don't have proper support to deal intelligently with crises in our lives, what 
we end up seeing are those who are trying to take advantage of us in that 
situation.  The constant advertisements for "psychic help lines," the success 
of the scientologists, and in many cases religion is used to take advantage of 
those with the natural human instinct to question their place in the world or 
to attribute cause, and the fear and uncertainty that results from that.  
Don't be fooled by friends you have to pay for.  SAFE spells out, in a satire 
on the emptiness of American life, just what a mess that can become.  </P>
<P>So how can we possibly cope in a world fraught with danger?  SAFE is a rare 
film in that it does not lie with a simplistic or tidy answer, preferring to 
simply not offer an answer, which is more often than not, the only real answer 
in life.  It may be ambiguous, and it may not be happy, but it sure isn't
a cop-out.</P>
<PRE>--</PRE>
<P>Even if you don't care for what SAFE is saying, it is still a film of much 
merit.  The cinematography is nothing short of striking (see it letterboxed if 
possible, as framing is very important in the context of the film), and the 
sound mix is incredible, where the constant noise of our surroundings becomes 
almost unbearable.  Julianne Moore's performance as Carol is breathtaking: her 
decline in the second half of the film seems truly tragic as Moore's actual 
physical condition deteriorates (Moore lost 10 pounds during the course of the 
film and kept strict diets), and her portrayal of a fragile, empty individual 
is one of the most effective and striking performances seen this decade.</P>
<P>As a side note: for many months after seeing SAFE, I argued with friends about 
the character James LeGros plays at Wrenwood.  Many other viewers were certain 
that he was trying to 'hit on' Carol.  I argued that he wasn't, as I 
considered him to be flamingly gay.  In an interview with Todd Haynes, Haynes 
mentions that Moore and LeGros decided, behind his back, to play LeGros' 
scenes with the idea that his character was Peter Dunning's secret lover.  
Whether gay or not, Haynes has said that he intended for that character to 
start out by appearing that he was 'hitting on' Carol, but ending up as a kind 
of camp counselor.  It's just another interesting thing to keep in mind while 
watching the film.</P>
