<PRE>                                SUNRISE
                A film retrospective by Michael Har-even
                     Copyright Michael Har-even 1994</PRE>
<P>Director: F.W.Murnau
Cast: George O'Brien, Janet Gaynor, Bodil Rosing, Margaret Livingstone.
Released in 1927, 110 minutes.</P>
<P>     SUNRISE tells the story of a peasant who is encouraged by his
mistress, a city vamp, to get rid of his beloved wife.  The actual tale
is well known but the unique way that Murnau has managed to treat the
subject turns a cliche to one of the great masterpieces of cinema.</P>
<P>     It is impossible to relate this film to a precise style or genre.
Basically, it is a realistic film (but not naturalistic) mingled with
surrealistic and expressionistic scenes.  It is not a drama more than
it is a comedy.  It is a silent film yet every spectator can imagine
the colors and hear the sounds of each scene.</P>
<P>     The main subject is the relationship between men and women in the
modern society.  Men and women are different creatures.  Men like sport
while women like to dance.  Men are active while women are passive.
Men are direct while women are more sensitive.  In the modern world
(the city), the distinctions between the sexes are not that strict any
more.  Men must learn to be sensitive while women should pay for their
lunch.  How can that change take place?</P>
<P>     The only possible way is through love.  Love unites men and women
and gives them the strength to cope with troubles.  In SUNRISE, the man
and woman are peasants who enjoy the modern world but in the same time
have difficulty in adjusting to it.  As a result, there are several
very funny scenes that Keaton and Chaplin would have been proud of.
For example, after dropping a reproduction of Venus of Mile, the two
peasants cannot find the missing parts of the body on the floor.</P>
<P>     SUNRISE describes the rebirth of love.  The magnificent thing is
that the way the story is told is as delightful as the story itself.
Only on rare occasions, the audience becomes so close to the main
characters.  The actors are wonderful and Murnau succeeded to transform
their feelings and thoughts to the spectators.</P>
<P>     The expressions of the actors are so revealing that the spectators
are forced to unite with the main characters.  As a result, all the
events and the situations are very realistic.  Murnau exploits the
exterior for the same purpose.  When the hero is happy, a street full
of cars turns into a magical forest.  When he is full of lust for his
mistress, images of her are dissolving around him.  Even the titles are
formed in different shapes to express sarcasm.  A set of panning shots
are used to retain the realistic atmosphere after the expressionistic
and the surrealistic scenes.</P>
<P>     The result is one of the most sensible love stories ever told.  It
seems that SUNRISE is more interesting, more enjoyable, more original
and more authentic than any film of our decade.  How come?</P>
<P>     Like a true modern artist Murnau had an aesthetic theory on the
background of his films.  He tried to avoid the conventional so he
explored his ideas by creating films.  On the foreground, he loved his
actors, he loved his actresses, he loved the camera--he was in love
with cinema.  The greatest quality of SUNRISE is that some of this love
is passed to us.</P>
