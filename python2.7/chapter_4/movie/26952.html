<P>To be honest, I approached this movie with a certain dread. The 
advertisements called it: uplifting! Oscar-worthy! Finally, a bloody good 
film about the human soul and the triumph of the human spirit! Well, a bloody 
good film about the human soul is "Taxi Driver" but I know what people want 
from the cinema nowadays. Sentiment and in equal doses with a touch of heavy 
syrup added to make you feel not so much uplifted but weepy. I resent when 
manipulative tearjerkers exist because there is rarely much soul or humanity 
in them. Think of the countless Lifetime TV movies-of-the-week, or for that 
matter, the absurdly awful "The Evening Star," which led us to believe that a 
huge mortality rate equals emotion. Not so. But I digress. "Billy Elliot" 
could have been a contender for most sentimental hogwash of the year but it 
is not: it is a humane, positively uplifting film guaranteed to at least 
place a smile on your face. </P>
<P>Billy Elliot (the extraordinary Jamie Bell) is a young boy living in the poor 
section of Northern England with his tough-as-nails father, Jackie (Gary 
Lewis), and Billy's older, rougher brother, Tony (Jamie Draven). Billy takes 
care of his grandmother, who also lives with him, while his father and 
brother act as scabs - they protest the town's ongoing mine strike. This 
means they are unemployed at the moment, and the last thing they need to hear 
is that Billy is thinking of becoming a ballet dancer!</P>
<P>But the macho ethic of Jackie and Tony does not allow for fairies or swans, 
so to speak. Billy actually takes up boxing but lacks the drive and the 
attitude. One day, he observes a ballet class taking place in the same 
gymnasium where he boxes. Billy is transfixed and decides to learn ballet. 
Why? Even he doesn't know but it does bring some energy and enthusiasm to the 
kid - he feels alive when he dances. The gum-chewing teacher (Julie Walters) 
instructs the boy, despite stern objections from Jackie and Tony. Billy loves 
ballet and the movement of the body swaying to the strains of Tchaikovsky's 
"Swan Ballet" - it is definitely an escape for the boy from the horrors at 
home. The teacher is so impressed with the boy that she tells him to audition 
for the Royal Ballet School in London. </P>
<P>"Billy Elliot" is essentially the well-traveled road about a kid from a poor 
town who plans to make a difference by following his dreams. The tale is 
nothing new but of course, what matters is how it is told. What remains 
questionable is the amount of time invested in Jackie and Tony's lives, which 
breaks the tension and charisma of watching Billy practice his ballet. Jackie 
and Tony are scabs, and they are fed up with life and all it has to offer - 
Jackie is also widowed. This no doubt affects Billy, but the movie follows 
the formula to the hilt without ever following its heart. Sure, Jackie is 
disapproving of his son's artistic intentions but he comes around. As a scab, 
he chooses to go to work to support his son's travel expenses to London. The 
gritty realism we are given about a father torn by his love for his long-lost 
wife and by his desire to not work doesn't wash, nor does Tony's sudden 
change-of-heart (if I am not mistaken, he even wears an apron in one scene!) 
These plot changes do not qualify as spoilers because if you've seen "Rocky" 
or "Flashdance," you've seen this same tale woven by many. </P>
<P>What does wash are the beautifully choreographed ballet scenes - this Jamie 
Bell is one hell of a dancer, and a fine actor to boot (Haley Joel Osment, 
watch out!) He is charismatic, soulful, determined, enthusiastic, and a 
fighter - he will not quit until he gets those dance moves right. It is sheer 
bliss to watch any scene with Bell, and his moments with Julie Walters are 
awe-inspiring (not as good though as the similar tale with Shirley MacLaine 
in "Madame Sousatzka"). There also some wonderful scenes between Billy and 
his best friend, Michael (Stuart Wells), who wears his mother's clothes. I 
also like the tender scenes between Billy and the teacher's daughter (Nicola 
Blackwell). But whenever the film dwells on the mine strike, it is as if we 
were watching another film entirely. One has the grit and the other has the 
fantasy, and the two do not mesh evenly. </P>
<P>"Billy Elliot" doesn't succumb to the overt sentimentality of typical 
Hollywood fare by reminding us when to weep. It builds on the charismatic 
Jamie Bell, who uplifts us in spite of the cliches and uneven subplot 
surrounding him. He reminds us of how we can follow our dreams wherever they 
take us.  </P>
