A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jim Fall</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Jason Schafer </PRE>
<P>Starring: Christian Campbell, John Paul Pitoc, and Tori Spelling</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
A nebbish homosexual attracts the affection of a buff and studly go-go boy,
and you know the rest of the story from watching other screen romances. Boy
meets boy. Boy loses boy. Guess what's next? </P>
<P>Opinion:
Since we all know the romance formula, the way to keep it spicy is to
change the setting. Put the romance on a sinking luxury liner, or set it
during the Vietnam War, colonial America, ancient Egypt, a trauma center, a
cop station, a train ride through Europe and so on. That way when the movie
is not concentrating on the inevitable romance, there are interesting and
dangerous subplots or fascinating scenery. </P>
<P>TRICK neglects this lesson. It has a predictable romance. Outside of the
romance story, we get to hear a lot of side characters complain about not
being able to break into showbiz. But their complaints never get resolved.</P>
