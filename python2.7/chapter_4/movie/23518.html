<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Illuminata is set in New York City, at the turn of the twentieth
century. A talented but struggling repertory troupe is doing a play by
Giovanni Verga "Cavalleria Rusticana." The resident-playwright Tuccio
(Turturro) finds an opening to get his play on stage, as one of the
actors, Piero (Sussman), in that play, faints while in the middle of his
performance. Tuccio immediately gets the troupe to perform his latest,
but unfinished work, Illuminata. It is Turturro's love message to the
theater.</P>
<P>This play-within-a-film, much like Bullets Over Broadway or Shakespeare
in Love, but not up to both of those film's achievements, nevertheless
it manages to develop a somewhat pleasing storyline and some amusing
comic moments. It is flawed by its uneven drama and how easy it is to
lose track of what is going on because of all the characters the story
tries to portray.</P>
<P>But there were two memorable performances, one by Katherine Borowitz and
the other by Christopher Walken: Rachel (Katherine Borowitz-in real-life
she is Mrs. Turturro) is the star of the show and the girlfriend of
Tuccio. She is caught by her real love for the playwright and for the
theater, trying to figure out which love comes first. The second
memorable performer is Umberto Bevalaqua (Walken), the detested theater
critic, who plays the part of a fop, excessively showing his outrageous
mannerisms. He sports a  frizzled hairstyle, and to keep others at bay,
he uses an acerbic wit, sparing no one from his vanity and arrogance. A
bad review from him, could destroy a play. He, thusly, roasts Tuccio's
unfinished opus, telling him to rewrite the ending. It turns out that he
is interested in one of the minor performers, Marco (Irwin), who is
encouraged by the other performers for the good of the play to see him
and try to hold off his sexual advances by saying that he took a vow of
chastity. The scene works as farce, and it gives the story some needed
life. Umberto is regally courted by the theater owners, Astergourd
(Beverly) and Pallenchio (Donal), who cater to his odd whims. When
Walken is onscreen the film has movement and excitement, when he's not,
the film just doesn't hold up as well.</P>
<P>Life in the theater gets juxtaposed within the film; its story going
back and forth with contrasting details, such as the latest gossip or
romance, the vanity of the players, and the strange love they have for
the theater. The love affairs of the actors, on stage and off, become
the whole purpose of the film. The main story is about the love affair
between Rachel and Tuccio, who are constantly rehearsing this difficult
play he wrote as they waver in their devotion for each other. Their
romance outside the play mirrors their romance in the film, and one can
therefore imply that it mirrors their real life romance.</P>
<P>Susan Sarandon as Celimene, is in a stereotypical role as an aging diva,
always acting, looking for romance, as she tries to lure Tuccio. She
easily handles this charming but not too difficult role. Georgina Cates
is the ingenue, who has eyes for the attractive Dominique (Rufus
Sewell). Aida Turturro, the real-life cousin of the director, plays a
part that makes good use of her huge breasts. Her desires are for
Pallenchio.</P>
<P>The play and the film was overloaded with a flavor of Italian, it only
seemed odd that the film was staged in New York and not in Milan.</P>
<P>I can't see a general audience taking to this strictly for the theater
crowd film; it is made mostly for those who love to know what goes on
behind the scenes and those who are theater buffs. I applaud the effort
and the originality of the film; but, as for what resulted, I was not
overjoyed with this overstuffed production.</P>
