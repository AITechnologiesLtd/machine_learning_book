<PRE>Titanic</PRE>
<PRE>A Review</PRE>
<PRE>By Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, and
Gloria Stuart.</P>
<PRE>Directed by James Cameron.</PRE>
<P>     I really wanted to hate this film.  It is part of what I call the
Forrest Gump syndrome, you hear a film hyped, you hear Oscar Buzz before
it is even released, and you think in the back of your head, for these
reasons I want to hate this movie.  I was wrong with Forrest Gump, and I
was wrong with Titanic. </P>
<P>     Much of what has been said about this film is absolutely true, at the
end of the film, it does not seem that you've been sitting there for over
three hours, and if the ship were not on the bottom of the Atlantic, it is
quite possible you would want more.</P>
<P>     The film is a story within a story.  The framing story concerns a
treasure hunter (Bill Paxton) who is being bankrolled by several
"interests" to find what is thought to be the most valueable diamond in
the world.  It was last known to be aboard Titanic in the possession of a
Pittsburgh Steel Tycoon.  In navigating the wreck he finds a safe which he
believes holds the diamond, however upon opening it, all he finds is muck,
water, and a packet of drawings, one of which of a naked girl wearing the
diamond.  He shows the picture on TV, knowing/hoping someone is going to
know the person.  A elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) phones him and claims
she is the woman in the picture, identifying the diamond by its name.  She
is flown out to the ship and tells the story of the diamond, and her
voyage on the Titanic in a flashback.</P>
<P>     Her flashback is the meat of the movie.  We are introduced to Rose
(Kate Winslet) a young woman who is promised to be engaged to, you guessed
it, a steel tycoon, played by Billy Zane (Phantom).  Also, proclaming this
is the luckiest day of his life, artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio)
wins a third class ticket on the Titanic and runs to get to the ship
before she sails.  It is obvious that Rose is not conent with her match
and we later learn that her mother is bankrupt and must insure their class
status.  Class is one of the major themes here, and there is a clever
duality where it refers to not only one's position in society, but ones
position in the ship.  Literally, the first class people were on the top
of the ship, and the lower class, were on the bottom.  Rose is not a usual
girl of high breeding and feels a slave to her class rather than a part of
it.  She is so distressed that she would rather die than marry.  She is
about to throw herself off of the boat when Jack saves her.  They have
instant chemistry, but it is obvious that she is still slightly bound by
her class strictures, and slowly but surely (but not too slow) she begins
to loosen up even more as she moves closer and closer to Jack.</P>
<P>     Her fiance and his Valet (David Warner) see her relationship with
Jack blooming and seem to do all they can to stop it, including handcuff
him to a post when the ship is going down.  </P>
<P>     It is difficult to expound futher on the plot without giving too much
away.  The acting in this film is top notch especially with people in the
smaller rolls.  Victor Garber (Godspell, Sleepless in Seattle) is
brilliant as the cathartic Andrews, the designer of the unsinkable ship.
He is a tragic figure of Greek and Shakespearian proportions.  A man who
thought he could question the gods, indeed, someone does say that even
"God couldn't sink her" when referring to the ship.  The leads, DiCaprio
and Winslet were good, but could have been better.  DiCaprio will forever
seem 12 years old, and it is difficult to see him as an adult in any role.
Winslet was facially brilliant, so many of her expressions conveyed
emotions and sometimes I could almost imagine fire behind her eyes, and
sometime great sadness.  Zane oozed smarmy evil, as he has done in so many
other films, and did it with style too.  Rose's Mother as well, conveyed
her personal terror at having to work and losing her position.  Kathy
Bates as Molly Brown showed us what new-money is, and what it meant to the
other people with money.  Finally, I cannot say too much about Gloria
Stuart, she has been absent from film for several years, and she is what
sucked me into the film emotionally before we even had a single flashback.
Her ice blue eyes held an incredible amount of emotion, laughter, pain,
and in a way, I looked forward to her appearances in the film.</P>
<P>     Now on to Cameron's direction.  It was pretty good.  He created
several short moments in this film that were very moving.  The string
quartet as the ship was going down, was something that could have been
played as a comic moment, in fact, some people in the audience laughed.
However, these four melancholy gentleman, no one ever listens to them, why
do they bother, but they sit down and they play and they play and they
play knowing that they are most likely going to die.  The fades from Rose
and Jack "flying" on the front of the ship to the wreck, and later from
Young Rose's eyes to Old Rose's eyes, during the sketching scene,  I sat
back in my seat and said wow, it was such a little thing, but it seemed to
powerful, it locked the framing story into the other in a way that is
stronger than most films and even books ever do.  There was obvious,
strong, connections between the two.  Finally, one of the most simple
shots was just of an old couple in bed as the ship was sinking and it was
a short, but extremely moving moment in the film.  Even though nothing is
said about them, they are not characters we have met, but we see them
there and we immediately think that is love. </P>
<P>     I have gotten to the bottom of my review and I have not even
mentioned special effects.  That is a surprise in a Cameron film, because
his name is often synonymous with them.  In this case, however, you aren't
seeing a special effect, you are seeing THE TITANIC, the real one.  The
CGI effects are superior in some cases, and only the very carefully
watching eye can catch them.  Only the daytime shots of the ship betrayed
the special effects, at night, the shots were spectacular.  Same with the
shots of the engines turning, it was exciting, it was loud, and it was
powerful.  </P>
<P>     The only thing I found a bit weak in this film, was the writing of
dialogue.  It is a difficult thing to do in any film, some writers have a
gift for it, some do not.  In this case, though, considering the rest of
the film, it is often easy to forgive.  It did bother me a bit, however.
Other than that, this is an excellent film.  It was far better than I
would have expected, and I am glad I saw it.</P>
<P>Of the $3.50 I paid to see it, it was worth $6.25</P>
