<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
1 and a half stars</P>
<P>"Pushing tin" is a term that refers to the ability to move planes
quickly, but don't be deceived by the film's trailers - it's not so much
about controlling air traffic, but rather the controllers themselves.
Writers Glen and Les Charles have an obvious interest in the
high-pressure job of their central characters, but ultimately this is a
very simple story about human relations and traits; jealousy, I suppose,
the key one on show.  The really bad news is that the vast majority of
this humdrum drama - advertised as if it were the year's most exciting
film - is awkwardly paced and far, far too conventional.  Consequently,
it's boring.  Booorrrriinnng.  Pushing Tin begins promisingly, but it's
a down hill ride.  The film systematically topples over itself again and
again, destroying the already crippled plot elements it depended on.</P>
<P>I mentioned the word "conventional" in a disapproving context, which is
rightfully so because I want to make it clear that Pushing Tin does not
lack in the flow its narrative due to the prevalent style its
screenplay - marriage dilemmas are perhaps too common in film nowadays -
but rather the continually obvious and quite uninteresting plot elements
at work.  The Charles' have developed a screenplay that takes familiar
formulas from different genres and sticks them together.  As a whole,
the film is not entirely predictable, but contains many scenes that are
laced with cliches; the kind of cliches that were bad even when they
first appeared oh so many years ago. I found myself constantly wanting
to be involved and entertained by the picture, but my frustration
dominated as the story generally worsened.</P>
<P>Nick Falzone (John Cusak) is an ace air traffic controller - a real
hot-shot in the industry - who is challenged to give up his legendary
status at work upon the arrival of Russel Bell (Billy Bob Thornton).
Russel is even greater a hot shot - he "pushes tin" - thus Nick gets a
severe case of green-eyed jealousy.  So much so, that both parties
suffer marital problems with their wives (Cate Blancett and Angelina
Jolie) that result in some bitter confrontations, and (yawn), some life
lessons.</P>
<P>"This is pretty boring," the person sitting next to me said, and I think
we both had that reaction when the formalities of the story became
tedious.  If Hollywood will insist on reissuing cliches again and again,
surely they can stage them in the right context.  The moral of the
story - scenes and dialogue in a screenplay should not be there simply
for the narrative to keep jumping as the plot proceeds.  Don't write
dialogue for the sake of it being heard, write it for enjoyment and to
sustain interest in the story.  The dialogue in Pushing Tin is very
average, and the film's pacing is very awkward - it seems to be
constantly trying to build up momentum, only to slow everything down
again.</P>
<P>The cast list of Pushing Tin is certainly an impressive one.  I believe
John Cusak and Billy Bob Thornton are two of better, if not best, actors
working today.  Cusak is a rare find, an actor who effortlessly conveys
subtle absurdity in many of his roles, and somehow manages never to look
bad in the process.  I could almost say the same thing about Thornton,
although he usually looks for something a little more deep.  His
incredible debut in Sling Blade, his jokingly serious part in Armageddon
and his riveting performance in A Simple Plan made him a reliable choice
for a difficult dramatic role.  The strange thing is, these two actors
bored me in Pushing Tin, due to a lack of chemistry between the male
leads.  Cusask's very intentionally charismatic acting becomes
irritating, and Thornton is supposedly portraying a wise, mysterious
character, but he appears like one of those annoying people whose every
spoken word is an attempt to prove their supposed intelligence.</P>
<P>Veteran director Mike Newell, whose credits include the messy but very
enjoyable Four Weddings and a Funeral and Donnie Brasco, doesn't find a
good rhythm in Pushing Tin, and doesn't drive his narrative into enough
intriguing scenarios.   There are some worthwhile parts in the film,
most of which occur inside the air traffic control headquarters.  But
that's nowhere near enough.  Call me fussy, call me pretentious; but if
one more person makes an artsy-fartsy joke at my expense, I'll be forced
to hibernate through the winter and re-emerge when next year's Oscar
contenders arrive at Christmas.  So please refrain from giving me crap.
There's plenty of that at the cinema.</P>
