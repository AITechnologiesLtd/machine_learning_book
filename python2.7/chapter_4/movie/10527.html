<PRE>                                 A Film Review by Jason Wallis</PRE>
<PRE>"GoodFellas" * * * *
Starring Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta, Lorraine Braco and Paul
Sorvino
Directed by Martin Scorsese</PRE>
<P>     Many people find the mafia life attractive.  I mean, let's face it; on
the surface, they pretty much have it made.  Money, power, women; what more
could a guy ask for?   But there is also a down side to it.  Always having
to watch your back, getting in trouble with the cops, etc.  Martin
Scorsese's "GoodFellas" shows us exactly what it is like to be a part of
the mafia.  Being the brilliant man that he is, Marty shows us both sides
of this life with  painful realism.  
     Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian member of the
mafia.  As the film begins, we see Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray driving
in a car, noticing a banging that seems to be coming from the trunk.  They
get out to investigate, Pesci having his butcher knife ready.  They open
the trunk to find that their victim is not quite dead.  Pesci, being the
psychotic nut he is, viciously attacks the bound and helpless victim. 
This, I think, is the perfect opening for this film.  It shows us just how
graphic and cruel "the life" can really be.
     Then we are shown Henry as a young man, always watching the local
mobsters from his bedroom window, constantly envying them.  Soon, he is
"adopted" by the local family.  They have him do odd jobs (i.e. setting
fire to cars, making deliveries).  The family is run by Pauly (Paul
Sorvino), the godfather figure who goes not want his outfit to get into the
narcotics business (much like Marlon Brando's character in the original
"Godfather").  
     Later, Henry is again an adult and is still in "the business". He
falls in love (more or less) and marries a Jewish girl (Lorraine Braco,
Oscar nominated performance).  One of his buddies is fellow mobster Tommy
DeVito (Joe Pesci, in the performance of his career), the hot-head who
knifed the guy in the trunk at the beginning of the film.  He's really the
one who starts all the trouble, but I won't get into that right now.
     Tho "GoodFellas" is not quite as totally cool or classic as Francis
Ford Coppola's "The Godfather", it is a tad more realistic and lurid.  In
Coppola's romantic version of mob life, you were dealing with high-class
mafiosos, not street thugs like you are here.  These are the people that
truly don't give a crap about anybody or anything except themselves.  These
are the people who don't know the meaning of the word "loyalty".  These are
the people that you could see walking down the street and not even know
that they're hard-core criminals.  
     Martin Scorsese has delivered yet another masterpiece here. I mean,
this one is right up there with "Raging Bull", "Taxi Driver" and "Mean
Streets".  My big question is why hasn't the Academy ever given Marty an
Oscar?  By now, he deserves at least three or four.  Do they have something
against brilliant minds or are they just plain stupid?
     Anyway, I highly, highly recommend this film if you are looking for a
well-made, hip, stylish and just plain cool gangster flick.</P>
