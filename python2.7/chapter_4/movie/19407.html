<PRE>SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
Paramount / 1:22 / 1999 / R (non-stop profanity and crude humor, comic
violence)
Cast: Trey Parker; Matt Stone; Mary Kay Bergman; Isaac Hayes
Director: Trey Parker
Screenplay: Trey Parker; Matt Stone; Pam Brady<HR></P>
<P>Take a good gander at the title of "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut."
If you don't spot the naughty joke immediately, perhaps you're not in
the movie's target audience. This double entendre fittingly serves a
double purpose, barely tapping the randy humor yet to come and heralding
exactly how this "Park" will differ from the version that's seen weekly
on Comedy Central in television-sized, half-hour and censored format.</P>
<P>At least give credit to co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for being
honest from the get-go. Their movie's definitely "Bigger," the colorful
but crude construction paper-animation a nice change of pace on the
silver screen from cutting-edge 'toons like "Tarzan." It's certainly
"Longer," more than three times the length of an average episode. And
it's undeniably "Uncut": Just look and listen as a barrage of bawdy
behavior and imaginative profanity assault the senses of all in
attendance at this ode to obscenity and eventually the first amendment
and parental responsibility.</P>
<P>Hijinks as usual are in store for the South Park, Colorado gang of tubby
Cartman, Jewish Kyle, lovesick Stan and cryptic Kenny (voiced by either
Parker or Stone), only their misadventures here leave behind an
especially timely message. As real-life theatres stronghold their
policies regarding admittance into R-rated films following the
entertainment industry's blame in the Columbine tragedy, Park's fearsome
foursome sneak a peek at a not-for-kids flick called "A--es of Fire,"
starring filthy Canadian comics Terrance and Phillip. These
sewer-mouthed pranksters leave an indelible impression on our
protagonists, causing them to retreat back to the schoolyard with a
shocking new vocabulary.</P>
<P>This is where "South" began to head south for this non-fan who's caught
only bits and pieces of the boob-tube "Park." Being "Bigger" is a
necessity. But the "Longer & Uncut" parts create a TV-to-movie
transition that depreciates from roughly the 30-minute mark on, its
anything-goes offensiveness factor zapping most of the series' crass
charm. The novelty of cartoon kids swearing in proud, full glory (this
film's main reason for existing?) gets old fast, long before Kenny gets,
yes, killed and dispatched to hell, where he meets Satan and Saddam
Hussein - portrayed, of course, as homosexual lovers in a gruesomely
dysfunctional relationship, their bedroom ballistics pure overkill.</P>
<P>Kenny's death is "A--es of Fire"-related, literally and figuratively,
causing mothers everywhere to band together and point fingers at our
northern neighbors. We've seen this U.S-Canada skirmish before in
"Canadian Bacon," but not with a series of never-ending musical numbers.
That's right, "South Park" is a full-blown singalong, and it's worth
noting that the crowning moment - Satan's lamenting power ballad "Up
There" - contains nary a bad word, instead milking laughs by hilariously
mocking the hero showstoppers oft found in Disney fare. Broadway,
especially "Les Misérables," also gets roasted in the film's numerous
production numbers, which grow as stale as a month-old box of Cheesy
Poofs.</P>
<P>Sure, some of the excessive raunch flies, particularly an early Terrance
and Phillip ditty that includes a Riverdance performed by leaky rears
instead of tap shoes. But Parker and Stone almost always hit the mark
with nasty jabs at pop culture and celebrity image - ridiculing everyone
from the news media and Bill Gates (likely targets) to Conan O'Brien and
Jar Jar Binks (not) - and thus end up concocting quite an uneven display
of demented satire. "South Park" lovers won't be as picky or
discriminating, probably embracing the whole "Bigger, Longer & Uncut"
package. But I'll take smaller, shorter and bleeped any day.<HR></P>

"It presents as comedy things that are not amusing. If you think this
movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know."
