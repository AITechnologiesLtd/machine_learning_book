<PRE>                            CINEMA PARADISO
                       A film review by Rui Sadio
                 Translated from the Portuguese by Rui Sadio

<P>The reason why this review will be very synthetized is because sometimes 
there are things which can not be described or explained by words.
Well, I think CINEMA PARADISO is in this conditions.</P>
<P>First of all, I must say that CINEMA PARADISO is, in my opinion, the most 
beautifull movie I ever saw in my all life and I'm sure that it will be 
difficult to see another movie as good as it in the next years.</P>
<P>CINEMA PARADISO is a great homage to the cinema; it's a story (perhaps a 
lesson) of love and friendship between people; it's a very particular view 
about life and dreams.</P>
<P>Everybody who sees CINEMA PARADISO can not be indifferent to the 
simplicity and, at the same time, the power of its message.</P>
<P>I congratulate Giuseppe Tornatore for his magnificent work, as well as 
Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio, whose performances as Alfredo and 
Toto will be saved, forever, in the golden pages of Cinema History.</P>
<P>CINEMA PARADISO is more than a film to be seen, it's a film to be felt by 
our heart.</P>
<PRE>CLASSIFICATION (1 to 10): 10</PRE>
