 Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life (1996)
                  A film review by David Cowen
                   Copyright 1996 David Cowen</PRE>
<P>It seems strange when watching a film which consists almost
entirely of images which can only be called unique to think
obsessively while viewing the movie about how derivative the 
movie really is.  While INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA features some of 
the most striking images seen in any film this year, the plot 
and characterizations which drive the film seem to be taken 
from other recent films -- mixed together, and put together in 
a way that can be best described as puzzling.</P>
<P>This decade has brought us a surprising number of moody, ethereal
films about attending a school on servitude in an European country:
Lars Von Trier's 1991 EUROPA (ZENTROPA in the US) featured an
American who traveled to Germany immediately after World War II
to offer the Germans some "sympathy" by serving on a passenger car
on the Zentropa line.  Guy Maddin's 1992 CAREFUL was an incredible 
acid-trip sendup of the German "Mountain Film", featuring a main 
character who goes to school to become a servant.  Both EUROPA and
CAREFUL featured incredibly innovative images -- EUROPA, shot in
cinemascope and fluctuating between black and white and color.
often featuring both on the same screen, and CAREFUL with its 
garish tinted colors and deteriorated look.  Both films are very
different from one another, and both, in my opinion, are of great
value.</P>
<P>INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA also takes place in a school, one where Jakob
(Mark Rylance) is training as a butler under the watch of Lisa
(Alice Krige) and Herr Benjamenta (Gottfried John).  The film 
spans the time in which Jakob joins the school, and ends at the
school's demise.  The Brothers Quay use the school less as a 
statement on servitude or any other topic but as a funhouse in 
which to play their visual tricks: the camera often shoots across 
the room to reveal the writing on an obscure contraption, or 
purposefully blur as to make an image look like something else.  
Little is established other than the basics: after Jakob enters 
the school, he becomes a troublemaker -- but becomes respected 
both by Lisa and Herr Benjamenta, both of whom view him as a 
confidant.  While Jakob, and many of the other characters spend 
much of the film engaging in talk that could at best be called 
philosophizing, little of it holds together, and the film seems 
to lack any sort of coherant meaning.</P>
<P>Instead, the viewer focuses on the images: often startling, and 
often beautiful in a gothic sense.  The Brothers Quay obsess on
dust and thread -- INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA is one of the few films
in which there is such a thing as a "gratuitous thread shot".  
Light and shadows flash across walls, as if the sun is moving 
through the film at a much faster rate than in real life.  The
film is sprinkled with odd visual jokes and puns which are often
as obscure or obtuse as they are funny.  </P>
<P>Unfortunately, there isn't much else in this film to admire.  The
use of a butler school seems completely perfunctory, and there 
isn't anything on that topic to be found here that wasn't already
covered in more depth in EUROPA or CAREFUL, nor do the images seem 
as shocking or beautiful when compared with the elegance of the 
aforementioned two films.  While the Brothers Quay are extremely 
capable when creating stop-motion animation, they seem lost as 
to what to do with the human element, and much of the film seems 
to be filler to take the film from image to image.  Ultimately, 
INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA is something of a beautiful, confusing bore.
If you're interested in seeing INSTITUTE BENJAMENTA, I'd instead 
recommend seeing EUROPA or CAREFUL (the latter of which is playing 
at the Music Box theater in Chicago in less than a month).</P>
