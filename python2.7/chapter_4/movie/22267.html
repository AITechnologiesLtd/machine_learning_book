<PRE>"Hello, my name is Ross and this is my review."
Man on the Moon</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Don't arrive late, the five minute introduction is marvelously unique and
quintessentially Kaufman. The entertaining film that follows, though
documentary in nature ... "is not an historical biography and it's not
always faithful to the facts," director Milos Forman admits (in the press
notes) "It is, however, always faithful to the spirit of the facts."</P>
<P>Jim Carrey portrays the eccentric, controversial comic Andy Kaufman
(1949-1984) who charmed audiences with his Latka character on the 1970's
sitcom "Taxi," shocked millions with his disruptive antics on the live-taped
"Fridays," baffled all of us with his incitingly sexist challenges to
wrestle women on TV, and finally left us in 1984 wondering if his death was
just another prank. Robin Williams once referred to Kaufman as the "kamikaze
of comedians" because he didn't care if he bombed.</P>
<P>Carrey, once known as the "man with the rubber face" for his ability to
actually look like the celebrities he imitated, can't shake off the fame
surrounding his own. That said, Carrey is absolutely rock solid conveying
the Andy Kaufman persona in voice and eye movement. He never falters. Even
though he looks like Jim Carrey, this is not a Jim Carrey movie. Critics of
Carrey's acting ability won't be able to ignore this disciplined
performance.</P>
<P>Danny DeVito (responsible for the film's conception and realization) leads
us through the production while portraying George Shapiro (Andy's agent). In
the "Taxi" sequences, only original cast members appear (though DeVito's
Louie character is conveniently elsewhere). Especially with DeVito in a lead
role along with wrestler Jerry Lawler's cameos (he does a fine job, by the
way), this lends a warm, friendly, sentimental feel to the film for those of
us who knew the "TV" Kaufman. It also serves to reassure us that the film's
portrayal of this enigmatic comedian is authentic. Lastly, it appends to the
memory of Andy, a sense of family and belated forgiveness for pulling our
legs and yanking our chains.</P>
<P>Courtney Love's performance as Lynne Margulies (who was on the set virtually
everyday) confirms her talent as an actress, making the transition from the
rock world with more grace than, personally, I'd have expected.</P>
<P>The film sheds light on the mysteriously odd death of Andy Kaufman, but
can't resist casting a shadow of a doubt on its audience during a slightly
unnecessary last scene. Ultimately "Man on the Moon" is a strong film,
unique and enlightening; even after the many Kaufman documentaries released
in anticipation of it. As for those of you unfamiliar with Andy's work I'd
be very curious to hear your reaction to this film (<A HREF="mailto:email@rossanthony.com">email@rossanthony.com</A>).</P>
