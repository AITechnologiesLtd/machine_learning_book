<PRE>                      GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH
                       A film review by Jim Mann
                        Copyright 1995 Jim Mann</PRE>
<P>I finally saw GODZILLA VS.  KING GHIDORAH, the third of the
revisionist Godzilla films.  This film is quite a step up from the
first two (GODZILLA 1985 and GODZILLA VS.  BIOLANTE).  Unlike the case
in GODZILLA VS.  BIOLANTE, for example, the battle scenes are well
done.  The monsters are threatening.  And, unlike the previous two
films, after the first twenty minutes or so the film does not drag.
The soundtrack is good, and the plot is not awful.</P>
<P>     The basic plot of the film is that travellers from the future come
to Japan and warn Japan that it will be destroyed by Godzilla.  But
they give them a way out: travel into the past and stop the creation of
Godzilla.  It turns out that Godzilla is a dinosaur that was still
alive in 1944 on a Pacific Island.  A 1954 H-Bomb test mutates the
dinosaur into Godzilla.  So, back we go, to 1944, where the time
travellers move Godzilla to another island.  Unfortunately, they really
want to destroy Japan (which had, in the early 21st Century, become an
even bigger economic power).  So they leave behind three little
muppets that mutate into Ghidorah, the Three Headed Monster.</P>
<P>     In one of the silliest "alternate timeline" scenerios yet,
Godzilla is no longer part of our timeline, yet everyone remembers him
and notes this fact.  People walk around saying "Ah, yes, Godzilla no
longer exists.  Too bad.  Maybe he could have handled this King
Ghidorah monster."</P>
<P>     However, Godzilla does exist.  The dinosaur has been exposed to
other radioactivity (a nuclear sub, perhaps), so he appears and trashes
King Ghidorah, then tries to trash Japan.  Finally, the good guy
contingent from the future must take Ghidorah back to the future and
turn him into Mecha-Ghidorah, so that he can stop an enraged Godzilla.</P>
<P>     Nonsense.  Sure.  But this is nonsense more in the spirit of the
original GHIDORAH or DESTROY ALL MONSTERS.  It's fun to watch, and at
times is a pretty good movie.</P>
<P>     It's still a big step down from the two best films in the
series--Godzilla and Godzilla vs. Mothra (the original), both of which
are good movies.  And I miss one of my favorite scenes in the whole
series: the birth of the original Ghidorah, from a fireball.  But this
is certainly the best film in the series in a long time, at least since
DESTROY ALL MONSTERS (one of my favorite "guilty pleasures") and
probably since the original GHIDORAH, THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER.</P>
<P>     One final note.  When this film was first released, there was a
bit of a controversy involving the pro-Japanese, anti-American slant.
In particular, reviewers (including the WALL STREET JOURNAL) focused on
how Godzilla saves a group of Japanese troops from the Americans in
World War II.  Actually, this scene didn't seem quite as blatant
nationalistic flag-waving as the whole reason behind the folks from the
future wanting to stop Japan.  Japan was so great, and became such an
economic power, that it managed to buy most of South America and
Africa.  This seemed a bit much, but it was only a minor distraction,
certainly not worth the space given to the articles written about it.</P>
<P>     [One final style note: excuse my spelling of "Ghidorah." I've seen
it transliterated several different ways.  Most recent copies use, I
believe, "Ghidorah."  The mid-sixties film used "Ghidra."  But I tried to
use the same spelling throughout this article.]</P>
