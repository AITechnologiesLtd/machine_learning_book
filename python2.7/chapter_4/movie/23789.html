<PRE>JESUS' SON
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>FH (short for an unprintable nickname) is a drug addict and the central
character in Alison Maclean's JESUS' SON.  FH, an unlucky loser, is
played by Billy Crudup, an actor last seen unimpressively in WAKING THE
DEAD.  He and his girlfriend, Michelle, pass the time by shooting up.
Michelle is played by Academy Award nominee Samantha Morton (SWEET AND
LOWDOWN), who was better playing a mute.  Although some films, most
notably TRAINSPOTTING, have had some success in transforming heroin
addicts into comedic subjects, addicts aren't exactly high on the list
of people normally considered hilarious.  JESUS' SON, based on a series
of Denis Johnson short stories and adapted for the screen by no less
than three screenwriters, never comes together into a cohesive or
compelling story.</P>
<P>Although some scenes, such as the one about a guy with a hunting knife
through his eye, possess a devilish black humor, most fall flat.  Dennis
Hopper's cameo turns unintentionally hilarious.  Shaving cream keeps
appearing and disappearing on his face in one of the more humorous
continuity errors in some time.  Most of the movie will leave you asking
yourself, "What was that all about?"  One of FH's obsessions, for
example, is regularly being a peeping Tom watching a Mennonite couple as
they go about their daily lives.  One can make some guesses as to what
it means, but the overwhelming feeling is that you don't care since FH
is such a distant and unappealing character.</P>
<P>JESUS' SON runs too long at 1:49.  It is rated R for graphic drug use,
strong language, sexuality and some violent images and would be
acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
<P>The film will be playing as part of the San Francisco International Film
Festival (<A HREF="http://www.sfiff.org">http://www.sfiff.org</A>), which runs April 20 to May 4, 2000.  It
is scheduled to be released nationwide in the United States this June.</P>
