<P>The Coen Brothers' latest film, FARGO is a combination of their earlier
works--specifically BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING ARIZONA. I think what I'm
trying to say is that FARGO is at one moment hilarious and then sharply
horrifying.  I've always had mixed feelings over violence on the movie
screen. When watching TAXI DRIVER I'd be thinking that it just wouldn't be
the same film without reaching that 'catharsis-through-urban-violence'
finale. On the other hand, I went to see ERASER and felt that the violence
there was indeed gratuitous.  I had always felt that I was holding a
double standard until I realized that what makes violence gratuitous is
the integrity, or lack thereof, of the film exhibiting it. And in the case
of FARGO, I found myself disgusted and horrified at what I was seeing as
opposed to ERASER where alligators ripped arms from their sockets and the
effect on me was minimal.</P>
<P>FARGO, which claims to be based on actual events but isn't, is the story
of a car salesman (William H. Macy) who manifests a scheme to get nearly
one-million dollars in ransom money for the kidnapping of his own wife. 
Her extremely wealthy, grumbling and growling father will be forced to
pay. The film unfolds as nearly everything goes terribly wrong--sometimes
funny, often frightening. We follow a pregnant police detective (Frances
McDormond) as she uncovers the case. I won't go any further in case you
haven't seen FARGO other than to tell you that I was skeptical as to how
involved her character could be considering her physical condition. Let me
tell you her character is well-engaged by the story and her involvement in
the climax/resolution is truly memorable.</P>
<P>The film's screenplay was written with extreme care for detail and
narrative verve, all too often absent from contemporary works. There are
times, and this is a good example, when it is obvious that this screenplay
had reached a fully developed and final draft before principle photography
was started.  The dialogue alone is so new and devoid of clich that the
audience is (and this is rare) anticipating the characters' interaction
instead of predicting it. Even in so called 'talking heads' scenes, we are
mentally engaged by the film and certainly involved. Joel and Ethan Coen
have consistently shown a talent for dialogue, storytelling and the
ability to integrate both into the film's visual elements. They are also
one of the few filmmakers with a signature--when you see a Coen Brothers
film, you know it.</P>
<P>Not one actor in the film would be considered by a studio executive to
headline a movie on their own. This is a cast of all those people you saw
in supporting roles in other films. William H. Macy (Oleanna, Homicide,
ER) is a veteran of David Mamet's plays and performs here flawlessly. He
shapes his character so anxiously weak that we both condemn his for his
acts of cowardice and pity him for his lack of social courage. Frances
McDormond (Blood Simple, Raising Arizona) as the pregnant police chief on
the case has herself one of the most original characters ever written. She
is indeed quirky, and although quirkiness does not necessarily equal
originality, McDormond grounds the character in truly human qualities.
Then there is Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs, Living in Oblivion) who's
been doing similar characters since his supporting role in Martin
Scorsese's short film, LIFE LESSONS from NEW YORK STORIES. Although his
character in FARGO is not much different, this time he does not come off
as though he's playing for the camera with the exception of a very funny,
"total silence" monologue. Buscemi seems to be making a career out of
playing himself and this is another of several films in which it works.
Also, by the end of FARGO, his character is so viciously frustrated that
it mirrors the "hilarious, but horrifying" theme of the film.</P>
<P>Although the screen credit for director goes to Joel Coen and the producer
credit goes to Ethan, they have said that they actually share the two
positions equally.  In directing FARGO, the Coen brothers seem to hold
back a little--using their trademark wide angle lens with more reverence.
They save their more visual shots for sequences in which they won't
smother the actors' performances and the story. In the context of this
film, I think they've struck a perfect balance. Their best scene, I would
say, is the triple homicide sequence at night--part of which was borrowed
from their own BLOOD SIMPLE. I guess practice makes perfect.</P>
<P>Much has been made of the scene where Frances McDormond meets an old
high-school friend, Mike, for lunch.  Later in the film, we learn that
Mike has had psychological problems and that everything he told Frances
McDormond was a lie.  Many claim the scene serves no purpose and, despite
being well-written, should have been cut.  My take on it is that even
though she can deduce genuine facts presented to her, Frances McDormond's
character, until this point, is unable to recognize deceit and human
corruption.  As with Mike, she must accept what William H. Macy's
character had told her because she cannot see the possibility of his
dishonesty.  She just can't conceive such things.  At one point she says,
"I doubt our suspect is from Brainerd," because she thinks of evil as
something abstract that comes from somewhere else.  In this case, the Coen
brothers chose to introduce deceit and corruption through Naturalism. 
Which is to say, something unrelated to the plot, affects and forwards
it.  Once Mike is exposed, she is able to question William H. Macy's
sincerity and returns to press him further.  I feel that each film has its
own universe and many times its ideas, themes and other devices have to be
introduced to the main character for them to be cinematicly valid.  For
example, in TAXI DRIVER, Martin Scorsese plays a man who tells Travis
Bickle that he's going to kill his wife.  He introduces "violence" into
Travis' moral universe.  Once exposed to it, he let's it consume him--and
we all know where it takes him.</P>
<P>Many people have been turned off by their own uncertainty as to whether to
laugh or cringe during this film. I know this was quite intentional and
would expect that the Coens take it as a compliment to their work to have
affected those people in such a manner. Anyway, FARGO is the best film
that's come out all year and I don't see anything coming in the future to
change that. It will certainly be nominated for Best Original Screenplay
if not Best Picture. Joel Coen has already won the Directing Prize at the
1996 Cannes Film Festival. I highly recommend you see FARGO. </P>
