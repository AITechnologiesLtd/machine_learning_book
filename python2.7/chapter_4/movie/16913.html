GREAT EXPECTATIONS     1998
Reviewed by Pierce Dalton
2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<P> What the hell happened to Great Expectations from the way of Charles Dickenson
to the Hollywood screenplay?</P>
<P> This was not what I was forced to read in 9th grade.</P>
<P> This version is about two twits falling in and out of love from their
childhood in Florida, to their adult lives in New York City.</P>
<P> The only resemblence, aside from the young love, is the escaped convict who
befriends a boy in Florida.  The con is played by Robert De Niro, who, in his
total of four scenes, steals the entire picture under Ethan Hawke and Gwyneth
Paltrow's feets.</P>
<P> In the `60s, a boy is forced to do housework for an aging drama queen at her
old, decaying mansion.  There he meets her niece, I believe, and they fall in
love, I believe.</P>
<P> They go in and out of lust as teens,  til they both bump into each other in
NYC later on, he a rising artist, her, a business women.</P>
<P> This film is under Paltrow's talents, while, it is basically just right for
Hawke.  De Niro, on the other hand, is great, but, the film is also below his
surface.</P>
<P> A `90s, speeded up version of Dickenson, Great Expectations dashed all my
expectations of the film out the window.</P>
<PRE> It is a nice fashion show, though</PRE>
