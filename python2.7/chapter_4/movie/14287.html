<P>     Sometimes I just want to shake a film-maker who doesn't seem to
understand the strengths of her own story.  Take Tamara Jenkins, for
example, the first time writer/director behind SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS.
Her tale centers around the Abramowitz family, a semi-dysfunctional clan
living in Southern California circa 1976.  Papa Murray (Alan Arkin) is a
no-luck car salesman coping with persistent financial short-falls and
being a single parent to his three children, most problematic his only
daughter, 14-year-old Vivian (Natasha Lyonne).  Vivian is having enough
trouble dealing with typical teenage problems, like her suddenly daunting
breast size, without the added stress of moving from apartment to
apartment every few months to stay one step ahead of eviction.</P>
<P>     The mid-70s setting at first seems fairly arbitrary, a token attempt
at period color, but eventually the two main characters deepen the
resonance of the time.  Murray, the 65-year-old father of three young
children, is still very much a 1950s-style father, evidenced by a
throwaway scene in which he summons a black waiter in a restaurant with a
racial slur.  He defines his success as a father by his ability to provide
for his family, and makes it his goal to live in an area which will still
allow his children to go to the best schools (the "slums" of Beverly
Hills described in the title).  He certainly can't be the sensitive,
worldy parent Vivian needs as she begins exploring her sexuality in a time
light years removed from Murray's adolescence.  How can you discuss sex
with a dad who insists that you wear a bra with a halter top?</P>
<P>    That relationship forms the foundation for a solid story where the
laughs could have come from simple character interaction.  The two lead
performances are earnest and sympathetic, showing a strained affection
between father and daughter where communication is a challenge at best.
Lyonne in particular pulls off some difficult scenes of teenage sexual
experimentation without a hint of exploitativeness, ably assisted by Kevin
Corrigan as the next door neighbor with whom she experiments.</P>
<P>     Why, then, must Jenkins get hyper-quirky on us by introducing
Vivian's free-spirited older cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei), a troubled,
pregnant, recovering drug addict who comes to stay with Murray's family?
There's nothing faintly interesting or real about Rita or her problems;
they're like the shenanigans of a wacky relative on a television sit-com.
Every scene with Tomei is an over-the-top distraction, turning a low-key
character study into forced farce.  It's hard to take SLUMS seriously
when a tearful exchange between Vivian and Rita involves a gobbledegook
secret childhood language.</P>
<P>     It's not as though Jenkins needed to pad the running time because
there wasn't anything more substantial with which to fill it.  She never
quite explains why Vivian's mother is never discussed, never quite
explains what happened to the restaurant Murray once ran successfully,
never quite gives fully rounded personalities to Vivan's two brothers
(David Krumholtz and Eli Marienthal).  There's enough going on in that
slightly radioactive nuclear famliy to fill a feature film without
bringing in Crazy Cousin Rita.  SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS draws you in with
some sensitive observations about a family trying to cope with a profound
generation gap, as well as with a breakout performance by the
unconventionally fetching Lyonne.  Then, it starts pushing you away with
gratuitous eccentricity.  I wish Jenkins had showed more faith in Murray
and Vivian.  Like the Abramowitzes themselves, she doesn't seem to know
how good she really has it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 rolling Hills:  6.</PRE>
