<PRE>At First Sight
Release date: 30th April 1999
Val Kilmer
Mira Sorvino
Kelly McGillis
Director: Irwin Winkler
Screen Writer: Oliver Sacks, Steven Levitt III
Details: 128 mins, PG</PRE>
<P>I was becoming a little worried that Val Kilmer might be fast turning into a
typecast actor. He's been a drug debased rock star in The Doors, a drink
infested gun-toting cowboy in Tombstone and more recently a gambling junky
in Heat. Add to that the flying rodent obsessed figure of Batman and you
have a line up of characters who would do well from a long break at the
Jenny Craig clinic (Batman may require a little more help than the others)
Imagine my relief when I discovered Kilmer's new role involved a blind man
who regains his sight and falls in love - not a drug or obsessive compulsive
characteristic in sight.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the change in character hasn't paid off and I find myself
wondering if Kilmer isn't naturally suited to presenting surly, self
absorbed roles. In At First Sight he plays Virgil Adamson an architect who,
having been blind since birth, undergoes a miracle operation and suddenly
finds he can see for the first time. The beautiful Mira Sorvino plays the
workaholic architect, Amy Benic, who falls for Adamson and helps him
reluctantly regain his sight. What should be a joyous event, however, soon
turns sour as Adamson is forced to come to terms with a world of shape,
colour and light which he cannot understand.</P>
<P>Happily the mushiness you'd expect from such a movie never really
materializes and the story focuses more on Adamson's struggle to cope with
his newfound world of visual perception than on the developing romance
between him and Benic. Unhappily Kilmer's hot-headed narcissistic portrayal
of Adamson's plight makes the gravity point of the movie extremely hard to
pin down. If you've read the book you'll know the story of the true life
Virgil Adamson is gut-wrenching and will draw a tear from even the most
thick-skinned reader. The movie won't even cause a quivering lip, simply
because its so hard to feel sympathy for Kilmer, particularly when the far
more loveable character of Benic is shown as the insensitive and berated bad
guy.</P>
<P>Overall the film tries hard but, and I know I'm contradicting myself here,
Kilmer just isn't right for the part, Sorvino is simply wasted to bits and
the whole thing could have been so much more but for the awful directing
skills of Irwin Winkler. I'd far sooner recommend, Awakenings, a far
superior version of an almost identical story.</P>
