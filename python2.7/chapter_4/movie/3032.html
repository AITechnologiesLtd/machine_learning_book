<P>     What happens when you start out with a decent mystery premise, a
solid lead actor, and a script that builds suspense nicely through the
first half before inexplicably self-destructing in the most messy and
unpleasant manner?  You have either 1993's BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT or
1994's SILENT FALL, thrillers that share a number of unfortunate
traits, the most notable of which is an inability to construct a
worthwhile picture despite several apparent advantages.</P>
<P>     Bruce Beresford, who is in the director's chair for this film, has
a history of inconsistency.  For every TENDER MERCIES, DRIVING MISS
DAISY, or RICH IN LOVE, there has been a KING DAVID, HER ALIBI, or A
GOOD MAN IN AFRICA.  SILENT FALL isn't a movie for which Beresford will
want to be remembered.</P>
<P>     The basic story is that a mother and father have been brutally
murdered and the lone witness appears to be their autistic nine-year
old son Tim (Ben Faulkner).  Tim, however, won't talk, so child
psychiatrist Jake Rainer (Richard Dreyfuss) is called in to bring him
out of his shell.  At first, because of ghosts from the past, Jake is
unwilling, but the treatments offered by nasty Dr. Harlinger (John
Lithgow) convince him otherwise.  So, with the aid of Tim's seductive
eighteen-year old sister Sylvie (Liv Tyler), Jake sets out to free the
child's memories so that Sheriff Mitch Rivers (J.T. Walsh), the
incompetent head of an inept investigation, can arrest a suspect.</P>
<P>     The first fifty minutes of the film have their high points--a
nice buildup, some attempts (although predictable ones) at setting up
character relationships, and a suitably creepy atmosphere.  However,
developments in the second half easily make the viewer forget whatever
good things came before.  The plot gets out-of-hand and, like a boulder
barreling down a mountainside, the implausibilities and contrivances
gather speed until a disaster is unavoidable.  The catastrophe comes in
the form of what the film makers apparently decided to call a
"conclusion."</P>
<P>     If the sheer inanity of this preposterous situation doesn't get
you, then the variety of uneven performances might.  Richard Dreyfuss
is generally solid (except when he's trying to mimic Robin Williams'
zany vocal antics), but the rest of the cast is lacking.  Ben Faulkner
doesn't display any range, Linda Hamilton is an absolute embarrassment
(fortunately, her screen time is limited), and John Lithgow looks like
he stopped by to pick up a quick pay check.  Liv Tyler, who has a
certain screen presence in low-key situations but fails to convince
when required to display extreme emotion, looks like she's acting in
her first feature--which is the case.</P>
<P>     There are three kinds of murder mysteries:  those that are solidly
scripted and hold together both during a viewing and while being
dissected afterwards, those that entertain while being watched but can
be picked apart later, and those that collapse even as they unfold on
screen.  SILENT FALL slides neatly into the third category.  I can't
emphasize how poorly arrived at the resolution is, how plotted the
whole film feels, and how unpleasant it is to sit through this tripe.
SILENT FALL is the kind of picture that results when a film maker loses
sight of the fact that a portion of his audience might actually think
while watching a movie.</P>
