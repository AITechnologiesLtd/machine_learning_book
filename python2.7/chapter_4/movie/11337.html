<PRE>Great Expectations
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1998 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) If you didn't understand English, this would be a great movie
to see anyway. The cinematography is outstanding. It is fluid and graceful,
enamored and lightheaded. At times the widescreen shots are composed to
resemble the main character's paintings. And within each shot is a fully
textured world of birds or moss or art. </P>
<P>Against the swampy Florida setting is the modernized retelling of Charles
Dickens' story about a poor young man with a wealthy benefactor. </P>
<P>Ten-year old Finn (Jeremy James Kissner) grows up visiting his friend and
tormentor Estella Dinsmoor (Raquel Beaudene) once a week. Actually, it's
Estella's eccentric aunt (Anne Bancroft) who requests, and pays for, his
presence each week. Finn uses the money to keep him in sketch books, paints
and brushes. </P>
<P>Mrs. Dinsmoor asks young Finn what he thinks of Estella. "I think she's a
snob," he replies. "I also thinks she's pretty." Mrs. Dinsmoor warns him at
the age of 10 to be careful about falling for Estella. "She'll only break
your heart, it's a fact," she says. </P>
<P>When they reach high school, very close to graduation, Estella (now Gwynneth
Paltrow) complains to her aunt that she doesn't have a date for a big party.
Finn (now Ethan Hawke) still has a crush on her and gallantly volunteers for
the job. Afterwards, in one of those dizzying displays of passionate
cinematography, the shy and awkward Finn ALMOST wins the girl of his dreams.
Before he knows what's happening and before anything CAN happen, she is out
of his house, out of the country, and out of his life. Mrs. Dinsmoor's
prediction came true.  </P>
<P>Six years of Finn's life zip by. Disillusioned, he gives up on girls and on
painting, choosing instead a life of fishing with his uncle Joe (Chris
Cooper, recently in LONE STAR). </P>
<P>The story picks up again when Mr. Ragno (Josh Mostel), a lawyer, approaches
Finn. Ragno is acting on behalf of a wealthy benefactor who wishes to remain
nameless, and who offers Finn a New York studio and a one-man show of his
work. After a quick stop to carefully thank Mrs. Dinsmoor, he is off to the
big city. </P>
<P>In New York, Finn runs into Estella. Finn finds he STILL has a crush on her,
and when she agrees to model for him, he is ecstatic. The scene of him
sketching her is another one of those unabashed sequences of passionate
cinematography. As before, Estella abruptly walks out the door before
anything can happen. </P>
<P>Turns out she already has a boyfriend. Walter (Hank Azaria) is wealthy and
therefore, in Finn's mind, better deserving of Estella's affections. When
she tells Finn that she's getting married, she  practically dares him to
object, but Finn still feels like he hasn't EARNED his fame, or the ability
to make her a better offer. If either of them were more forthright, they
might make each other happy, but their natures and their different-class
upbringings work against them. </P>
<P>I haven't read the book, but the story seems to follow the original pretty
closely (based on a comparison with David Lean's more conventional
adaptation, and on other reviews). The modernizations actually improved the
story. For example, in the original, Pip (renamed Finn) is sponsored not as
an artist but as a monied gentleman. By giving the character a vocation
rather than a status, screenwriter Mitch Glazer makes him more approachable.
Glazer also made Estella's rejection of Finn less cruel and more
situational. That may have diminished our understanding of Estella's aunt,
but the movie is better off with two characters than with a hero and a
villainess. </P>
<P>A friend of mine criticized the movie for trying to be too artsy, but I
disagree. Cuarón portrayed the New York art scene with just enough derision
to make it clear that he wasn't going to bow to it. For example, at a party
there is a wandering opera singer, as irksome as the wandering mariachi
bands in schmaltzy Mexican restaurants. In Finn's agent's gallery, the
current exhibit is belly art: human bellies poking through holes in white,
square pillars. I can't remember when I've laughed so hard as when I saw
that scene. </P>
<P>The movie has a tidier ending than you might expect, and it doesn't seem to
quite fit. Then again, the original ending was unsatisfying in its own way,
so maybe nobody has figured out what the RIGHT ending is. (Dickens even
rewrote his own original ending at the urging of his friends). But the rest
of the story is wonderfully told and well structured. </P>
<P>If you aren't familiar with the story, then the structure is particularly
interesting, especially toward the end. The film is highly recommended to
you. But even if you know the story, this adaptation is beautifully
photographed and lovingly decorated, and that is reason enough to recommend it. </P>
