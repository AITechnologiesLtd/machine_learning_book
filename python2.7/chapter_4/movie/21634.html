<P>The Shining, starring Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd and Scatman
Crothers.  Directed by Stanley Kubrick.  1980.</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Carroll.</PRE>
<P>   In a year of the horror film, people always tend to look back at the
classics.  In a few years, people will undeniably be looking back at films such
as The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense as classic horror films.  But
for now, there are other classics to look after.  The Shining, directed by the
legendary Stanley Kubrick and based on the Stephen King novel, is regarded as a
classic.  And despite being an entertaining movie, The Shining did not age
well.</P>
<P>   The premise for the novel is that Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has become
the housekeeper for a ski lodge that is closing down for the winter.  This is
because the snow becomes to much to travel.  Right from the get-go, Kubrick
establishes the "trapped in the house" scenario that many horror films have
tried to accomplish.  The other plot involved is with Danny Torrance (Danny
Llyod).  He would be best described as a "weird" little boy, as he talks to his
imaginary friend, which turns out to be his finger.  As Kubrick later on
reveals, the boy has a sense known as "The Shining", a trait that the Overlook
Hotel chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) also possesses.  As the film
progresses, Kubrick develops the rage and isolation in Jack Torrance.</P>
<P>   Jack Nicholson, as Jack Torrance, gives a wonderful performance.  In a film
that tends to drag on at certain points and become rather tedious, Nicholson
steps up and brings the film back up, despite losing it once off the screen. 
Nicholson portrays Torrance as the psychopath he truly is, and despite knowing
what will happen in the film from the start, Nicholson will have everyone
second-guessing themselves.</P>
<P>   The rest of the supporting cast, which basically consists of Duvall, Llyod
and Crothers, does not add many dimensions to the film.  Duvall has the role of
the nice country wife, and gives a decent performance, although has trouble
standing out, particularly when paired with Nicholson on screen.  Danny Lloyd,
the boy with "The Shining", has a particularly important role, and utterly
fails with it.  Any drama with children tends to rely on their performance for
the film's success or failure.  Films like Taxi Driver that get great
performances from their child stars, in Taxi's case, Jodie Foster, those films
tend to succeed much more than subpar child performances.  Danny Lloyd fails
miserably.  His performance is as dry as can be, with no emotion shown in any
of his lines.  He even has trouble acting like a child, when in the backseat of
the car driving up to the Overlook Hotel, he cannot even do the "Are we there
yet?" correctly.  His performance bogs the whole film down and takes away from
the great performance of Jack Nicholson and will basically bore the audience
when he makes his on-screen performance.</P>
<P>   Despite the terrible acting from Llyod, Kubrick still manages to piece this
film together.  As said before, Nicholson brings such a demonic presence to the
screen that you cannot help but get chills.  His good, sensible personality
goes awry right before our very eyes.  As Nicholson starts chopping down the
doors at the end of the film, the whole theatre will be on the edge of their
seats.  However, the ending goes stale.  A tedious segment develops with Jack
Torrance chasing little Danny through the garden maze and this part goes on way
too long.  I will not spoil the ending, but it is definitely not something to
write home about.  It will leave you wondering why it took an hour and a half
to get to this finale.  Nicholson works so hard to pick up the pieces left by
Llyod's atrocious acting only yo be hampered by a subpar finale.</P>
<P>   In the end, The Shining is an experience within itself.  While it might not
please all audiences, it is definitely a film that needs to be seen to make a
proper judgement.  The ending may not be great and Llyod may bore you to tears,
but in the end, Jack Nicholson proves why he is the best of the best and anyone
with an interest in the horror genre should pick up a copy of The Shining.</P>
<P>Final Verdict: B
