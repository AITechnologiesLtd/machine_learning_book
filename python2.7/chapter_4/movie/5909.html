<PRE>                             THE CEMENT GARDEN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<PRE>         [This is one of my golden oldies reviews - written years
          ago when I was just getting started and never posted.
          I stand by the conclusions, but in most cases many details
          are missing that I would normally include today.]</PRE>
<P>     A one phrase review of THE CEMENT GARDEN would be that it is LORD
OF THE FLIES meets HAROLD AND MAUDE.  This is an unrated show, but
could be NC-17.</P>
<P>     I have trouble writing G rated reviews of NC-17 class movies.
Let me say the film involves solo sex, incest, death of parents, stale
bodies and other activities.  By now you probably get the basic idea.</P>
<P>     This is a film that is better seen that described.  It features
some great acting.  In the cast are the children: Andrew Robertson as
Jack, Charlotte Gainsbourg as Julie, Alice Coulthard as Sue, Ned Birkin
as Tom; the parents Sinead Cusack as Mother and Hanns Zischler as
Father; and Jochen Horst as Julie's friend Derek.</P>
<P>     The script is excellent and full of surprises.  If you can enjoy
quirky shows, this may just be your cup of tea.  Personally, I liked it
a lot and gave it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
