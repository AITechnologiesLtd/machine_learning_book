<PRE>Gladiator (2000)</PRE>
<P>Russell Crowe appeared in LA CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER, which were among 
the very best films of 1997 and 1999.  His anchor role in this year's 
GLADIATOR seals the film's place as one of the best released in the first 
half of 2000.</P>
<P>What's so good about this guy's acting?  Perhaps that he's rather 
unassuming; Crowe often seems to play the role of the general-turned-slave 
Maximus without effort.   He's the opposite of a showoff or a ham or an 
over-actor.  And as anyone from Laurence Olivier to John Wayne knew, 
understatement is best.  In his mid-thirties, slimmed down from his role as 
Jeffrey Wigand in THE INSIDER, Crowe inhabits his character with the proper 
authority and confidence.  Maximus is tough, muscular, and not afraid to 
fight hand-to-hand and risk dying with his men.</P>
<P>The film starts by chronicling the northern armies of Rome in a battle 
against a Germanic horde in 180 A.D.  In the scenes of preparation through 
the battle itself, the film engages us with the most striking battle footage 
since the first half hour of Speilberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Ancient Rome 
surely sustained massive war machines, and director Ridley Scott simulates 
them very well here.  There are the archers shooting flaming arrows;  there 
are the precursors to artillery, huge incendiary bombs launched from 
catapults, the charges exploding on impact with the trees sheltering the 
enemy.  Finally, there's the combat itself, the armored legions marching 
against the whooping middle European natives.  It does not make the best 
statements about imperialism or empire-building, but the material here does 
grip and hold our attention.  And it's all the more interesting because of 
the hand-held cameras, the choppy film speed and the wonderful graininess.  
Even when you have full color at your disposal, you don't need to use it, 
Scott is telling us wisely.</P>
<P>So Maximus is victorious, and he is complimented by the emperor himself, 
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  It's not long before this Caesar asks his 
best general what he wants; Maximus replies he wants to return to his wife 
and son, and their farm, outside of Rome.  Of course the complication is 
that the emperor, who loves Maximus as a son, offers him a form of power of 
succession.  Maximus would not be a dictator, which Marcus and previous 
Caesars have been; instead, he would serve as a sort of sergeant-at-arms for 
the Roman Empire, the administration and actual power returning to the 
Senate.  Rome would once again be the republic it was at its founding.</P>
<P>More intrigue surfaces when the emperor's real son and daughter enter.  We 
first see them ushered to the battle – after the death-dealing is done – in 
a luxurious coach.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, who believes he will be 
the next dictator.  His sister Lucilla is played by Connie Nielson;  this 
character is supposed to be the smarter of the two, the more politically 
canny and the wiser.  She had also apparently been involved with Maximus 
before his marriage to another.</P>
<P>It's clear that GLADIATOR will take the path of a revenge story, and the 
cause for revenge unfolds quickly.  Commodus makes sure his father's wishes 
are never formally broadcast, and commits a heinous combination of crimes: 
patricide and regicide!  Refusing to pledge loyalty to the heir, Maximus is 
sent off to be executed.  Experienced fighter that he is, he survives, 
foreshadowing the fighting he must do later – always against enemies of 
greater numbers and armament.</P>
<P>The main motivator for vengeance?  The ambitious and ruthless Commodus has 
Maxmimus' wife and son slaughtered -- terrorized and crucified.  By this 
time, of course, it's the audience's desire to see Commodus get his just 
deserts.  This predictability is one of the film's few flaws.</P>
<P>As the childish, hateful young emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast.  He is 
despicable, yes, but he also seems to have to put the most effort into his 
role.  Phoenix delivers the least naturalistic, the least transparent, 
performance among the major players.</P>
<P>Connie Nielson as Lucilla is fascinating:  her character is perhaps the most 
complex in the film.  Where her loyalties lie is unclear for much of the 
narrative.  In one memorable scene, she tries to use her history and 
physical wiles with Maximus to get him to reveal her father's wishes.  
Nielson also plays a loving mother well.  Her son Lucius is apparently the 
male heir after Commodus.  She is extremely cautious around her brother, 
particularly in a scene in which Commodus watches the sleeping boy closely.  
Fortunately, Scott and screenwriters David Franzoni, John Logan and William 
Nicholson only imply Commodus' sexual perversion; there are no scenes 
involving sex.  Commodus' incestuous tendencies are shown more clearly with 
his sister.</P>
<P>Oliver Reed does a nice turn as the slave trader and gladiator trainer 
Proximo.  Reed died not long after finishing the film.  His character is 
deeply conflicted; he doesn't know whether to assist the man he has 
discovered is a general, or to make all the pieces of gold he can.  Reed is 
perfect for this role, the sinews on his thick neck standing out with age, 
the cadences of his British accent mixing well with the accent assumed by 
Crowe.</P>
<P>Another strong supporting actor is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus.  He 
looks a little too gentle and wise to be involved with such dark politics; 
nevertheless, Jacobi's manner gets us quickly aligned with his cause, which 
is the same cause Maximus is willing to die for.</P>
<P>Djimon Hounsou is nicely cast as a captured slave, one who offers kindness 
to the wounded general – or the `Spaniard,' as Maximus is known among the 
gladiators he trains and fights among.  Hounsou shades his portrayal with a 
natural friendliness.</P>
<P>Special effects are stunning in GLADIATOR.        We view them mainly in the scenes 
showing ancient Rome, the immense and pillared structure, the impressive 
statuary, the painstakingly recreated Old World flavor of a living city.  
Recent speculation about the Coliseum, for instance, has made it into this 
film: historians believe long poles depended from the top, and from these 
poles hung sail-like awning, the closest thing to a retractable partial-roof 
of its time.  Wonderful details confront us: it would take more than one 
viewing to notice everything.  The only reservation I have about large scale 
backgrounds like the ones here is that they sometimes appear ultra-real, 
almost plastic – too-clear video images in a feature film.  It's better 
they're here, though.</P>
<P>Other special effects are employed in sequences that simulate dreams.  The 
initial image starting the film shows a warrior's hand skimming the tops of 
wheat stalks, and later we see definite imagery of death as Maximus dreams 
of meeting his son and wife in the Elysian fields.  We even notice some 
early Christian references.  Although the gods are mentioned, we hear 
Maximus praying to "Blessed Mother' and `Father.'  And he meditates with 
small statues of his wife and child.  It's easy to see how Christianity was 
developing at the time this story takes place; Scott is to be commended for 
showing the spirituality of some of his main characters.</P>
<P>Music by Lisa Gerrard (from the group Dead Can Dance) and well-known 
Hollywood score master Hans Zimmer is smooth and haunting.  Gerrard's voice 
sounds like it's from the Middle East, assisted by ancient instruments.  The 
CD would be a good investment.</P>
<P>The film is rated R for graphic violence.  I counted only one vile word, 
which could find its way into PG-13 rated fare.  GLADIATOR would be fine for 
those 15 and up.  The violent scenes are not tame, but neither are they done 
in a way that glorifies violence.</P>
