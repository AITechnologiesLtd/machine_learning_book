                                DRUNKS
                     A film review by Andrew Hicks
                      Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) **1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Made in 1995 but not released until 1997, DRUNKS is an 
ultra-low budget indie adaptation of a play. It comes from the BMG 
Independent film distribution company, which as far as I know, is the 
only film distribution company where you can make 11 movies for 
the price of one, with nothing more to buy ever. The lack of action, 
movement and anything else catering to short attention spans will 
most likely drive most viewers to drink, but the intense acting, from 
people you've actually heard of, no less, keeps DRUNKS interesting.</P>
<P>        DRUNKS is basically a 90-minute advertisement for 
Alcoholic's Anonymous, splitting its scenes between an ongoing 
AA meeting which turns into a series of monologues by its members, 
each trying to outdo the others for sheer dramatics, and the saga of 
Richard Lewis. The venerable "neurotic Jew" comic (whom I've 
always considered a eighth-rate Woody Allen -- all a matter of 
opinion, I guess) plays one of the recovering drunks, two years off 
the sauce, who finally gives in to his desires and ends up drinking 
bourbon, scotch and beer, and not just one like the song says.</P>
<P>        The meeting starts as planned, sure, with Lewis being 
prompted against his will to give an inspirational talk. He tells his 
life story -- heavy drinker by high school, met a woman, fell in love 
with her, she wouldn't marry him unless he went into rehab, he did, 
she died, now he's bitter and questioning everything -- then 
disappears from the meeting while the others start in with their 
stories. They try to milk suspense from the "Will Richard drink?" 
question, but it was obvious to me (and now to you, as I neatly give it 
away) that he would have to. Otherwise, where's your plot?</P>
<P>        The Lewis plot should be the most interesting half, but it 
isn't. All the scenes of him struggling with the bottle, trying to hook 
up with his old junkie girlfriend and wandering through the city 
streets drunk just didn't do it for me. What I enjoyed a lot more were 
the AA testimonials, which would have worked very well in play 
form. Screw Richard Lewis, I can just see that group of people 
trapped on one stage for an hour and a half, trading stories. The 
writer obviously spent plenty of time in this setting. That's the way 
to do it -- turn your alcohol problem into a halfway decent movie.</P>
<P>        I do have to admit, Lewis was good in his dramatic role. 
He did a lot better when he was actually giving his life story as part of 
the group than when he left it. I'm telling you, they should have just 
stuck with the drunks. People like Dianne Wiest, Faye Dunaway and 
indie queen Parker Posey do great here, along with others I didn't 
recognize. The unknowns were even more convincing than the 
established actors, and I'd pay them their dues if I didn't have to go 
back through the movie, write their character names down and wait 
for the credits. You know who you are and you know you're good. 
Too bad no one saw DRUNKS. It's just depressing enough to make 
you hit the bottle.</P>
