<PRE>                             NOTTING HILL
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, two
          actors who tread the line between over-abundant
          charm and the cloying saccharine star in a
          princess-commoner love story from England.  Can the
          most popular actress in the world find happiness
          with a handsome but modest bookstore owner with
          Hugh Grant's callow good looks? The film has a few
          nice sparks of wit but never really catches on
          fire.  Rating: 5 (0 to 10), high 0 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     The plot of NOTTING HILL is simple enough.  William Thacker
(played by Hugh Grant) is the handsome owner of a small and failing
travel bookstore.  He had a marriage that failed.  And now he lives
with a self-absorbed troglodyte of a housemate named Spike (Rhys
Ifans).  Spike is rude, stupid, and completely impossible to live with.
Into William's shop one day comes Anne Scott (Julia Roberts).  Scott is
sort of a combination of Meryl Streep, Gwyneth Paltrow, Emma Thompson,
and, yes, even Julia Roberts.  Her face is plastered on double-decker
busses all over London.  After the requisite shaky start, Anne and
William begin to date and go through some predictable comedic
situations.  What happens when a luckless bachelor comes to dinner at a
friend's house with his date of the evening, one of the world's most
glamorous movie stars?  (There is a somewhat similar and considerably
funnier sequence in MY FAVORITE YEAR.)  What happens when a man
thinking that he is going on a date finds that it really is a press
publicity junket for a film and for some reason he pretends he is there
to interview the star?  The latter sequence goes on much longer than
need be and eventually outstays its welcome.</P>
<P>     I have liked my share of romantic comedies, but NOTTING HILL just
never really catches on for me.  Perhaps the two leads seem just too
charming and empty. Hugh Grant's boyish stuttering as he finds almost
the right words is growing tiresome.  And Julia Roberts has such a wide
infectious smile from back molar to shining back molar.  I wonder if
she needed surgery to stretch that grin.  Their dialog ranges from
serious to cute to attempted cute.  The film could have had a
perceptive look contrasting how the super-famous and the unknown see
the world differently, but NOTTING HILL rarely rises to that occasion.
Much of the humorous dialog seems borrowed from "Seinfeld" with Spike
standing in for Kramer.  ("I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or it might have
been Topol."  "But they don't look even remotely alike."  "Well, he was
standing too far away.")  There are certainly places the film just does
not ring true.  The giant film that actress Anne Scott is currently
starring in appears to be on the level of GALAXINA, a film that would
be unlikely to have a big $15,000,000 star.  The script is by Richard
Curtis who has mostly written scripts for Rowan Atkinson playing either
Blackadder or Bean.  Curtis did write FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and
now has returned to Hugh Grant territory.  But FOUR WEDDINGS had much
more human drama mixed in with the comedy.</P>
<P>     Director Roger Michell is probably best known for PURSUASION.
Here he seems to be depending a bit much on the star power of his two
major actors.  Too frequently he allows the camera to lovingly just
take in Julia Roberts while she just stands with a wide smile.  He is
apparently hoping that her magic and allure will just effortlessly win
over the audience.  Even Roberts does not look that good.  Just a
little cuter is Hugh Grant as he boyishly stammers and says the
unexpected while he tries too hard to express himself.  But really as
is often the case, many of the background characters are of greater
interest than those in the foreground.  William's circle of friends are
more interesting characters with a more real set of problems than the
principals.  (How frequently are major characters in American films
bound to wheelchairs?)  The film has one sequence in which William
visits Anne on a production set and just to see the circus that is
required to make a film makes this the most interesting sequence in the
film.</P>
<P>     NOTTING HILL tries to return to the territory of FOUR WEDDINGS AND
A FUNERAL, but never manages to capture the same romantic spark.  I
would give it a 5 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
