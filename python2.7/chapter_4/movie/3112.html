<PRE>                               THE RIVER WILD
                       A film review by Rich Kulawiec
                        Copyright 1994 Rich Kulawiec</PRE>
<PRE>Overall: ***</PRE>
<P>     THE RIVER WILD immediately invites comparisons with other films
containing whitewater footage--especially DELIVERANCE.  The parallels
are striking, since in both cases the writers added to the inherent
danger of river-running by creating actively hostile characters intent
on doing harm to Our Heroes.  Speaking of which, the heroes in this
film are Meryl Streep (Gail), David Strathairn (Gail's husband Tom),
Joseph Mazzello (her son Roarke) and Maggie (their golden retriever).
Together, they play a somewhat dysfunctional family torn between Tom's
obsessive work habits and Gail's more relaxed, earthy values.  Roarke
is split between these worlds--while he seems to appreciate the
petroglyphs carved on the canyon walls, he spends a lot of his time
plugged into his portable stereo.</P>
<P>     This story begins as a uneasy river trip; Tom joins Gail and
Roarke at the very last minute, having almost-but-not-quite torn
himself away from his work in Boston.  Gail, a former river guide, is
simultaneously pleased that he's decided to come along and unhappy that
he doesn't seem able to relax and immerse himself in the outdoor
experience.  Neither is prepared for the consequences of their coming
encounter with chillingly charming bad guy Wade (Kevin Bacon) and his
somewhat reluctant cohort (John C. Reilly).  This pair are on the run,
and have decided to make their escape downriver; and while they may not
be smart enough to have thought their plans through, they are smart
enough to coerce Gail to assist them.  Unfortunately for all concerned,
the way downriver includes The Gauntlet, an intimidating and ferocious
rapid which may or may not be runnable....</P>
<P>     Dennis O'Neill's script includes a few cliche moments--the
startled-by-the-benign-character-with-accompanying-musical-punctuation
scene, and the child-too-stupid-to-see-the-obvious-danger scene; but
these are exceptions to what is largely a well-written story which
manages to develop multiple characters in parallel.  The plot flows
much a like a whitewater river: calm and gentle here, unexpectedly
violent there.  The photography is exceptionally good; unlike its
predecessor DELIVERANCE, which was largely filmed from the riverbank,
THE RIVER WILD includes many on-board shots which sweep the movie-goer
right into the huge waves and monstrous holes that make up the larger
rapids.  THE RIVER WILD also differs from DELIVERANCE in its
representation of evil forces; in the present film, the bad guys are
much easier to identify, and the menace much more overt.  The
all-encompassing sense of foreboding that was present on the Chattooga
is replaced here with alternating moments of light and dark.</P>
<P>     Streep's performance?  In brief, Meryl Streep is one of the best
and most versatile actresses working today, and her performance here
shows yet another aspect of her talents.  And while she dwarfs everyone
else on the screen, the supporting roles played by Bacon, Mazzello, and
Maggie (!) should not be lost.</P>
<P>     Incidentally, a word about the "danger" bit: some folks (here and
elsewhere) have commented that the rapids didn't look that tough, and
that perhaps Jerry Goldsmith's musical score combined with Curtis
Hanson's direction had been employed to exaggerate their difficulty.
As an experienced whitewater kayaker and rafter, let me reassure you
that they are every bit as a tough as they look, if not more, and that
a run through "The Gauntlet" (in real life, Kootenai Falls, a class
V-VI drop on the Kootenai in Montana) has every possibility of being
lethal.  Even Blossom Bar on the Rogue (Oregon, class III-IV, used for
a number of scenes in the film) is by no means an easy rapid, and
underequipped, underexperienced paddlers *will* get hurt there.  So if
this movie has fired your sense of adventure, please don't rush out on
rivers you're not prepared for; the last thing the whitewater community
needs is a rash of injuries/deaths such as followed the release of
DELIVERANCE.  Instead, consider a guided trip on a more moderate
stream; the harder rivers will be there when you're ready for them.</P>
<P>     For an excellent account of the production of this film, from the
viewpoint of Arlene Burns (experienced whitewater professional and
stunt double for Streep in some scenes), see the October 1994 issue of
PADDLER magazine--available in outdoor/backpacking shops.</P>
