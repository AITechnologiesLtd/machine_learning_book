<P>"The night started out with a bang. All the elements were in place for
a long weekend: heat, humidity, moonlight. I was good at my job. There
were periods when my hands moved with a speed and skill beyond me. But
during the last year I started to loose that control. Things had
turned bad. I haven't saved anyone in months. I have come to believe
in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put
back. I grew up in this neighborhood. I worked here most as a
paramedic and it had more ghosts per square foot than any
other. Rose's ghost was getting closer. I just needed a good night's
sleep and a couple of days off. It was six months since I lost
Rose. Homeless. Asthmatic. 18 years old. I used to block bad calls
out, but she wouldn't let go. And now she came to bare witness for all
of them -- all that have been lost. I've always had nightmares, but
now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep. They were part of the job-
the eyes of a corpse, the screams of a loved one. After a while I came
to understand that my role was less about saving lives, but about
bearing witness. It was enough that I simply showed up. Except with
Rose..."  © Paramount Pictures</P>
<P>It is the early 1990's and New York has not yet undergone its
renaissance of recent years. Sirens screaming and lights flashing, a
New York City ambulance speeds through the night. Its drivers are
paramedics working the graveyard shift -- men who come face-to-face
with the dead and the dying on a daily basis. Burnt out from one too
many nights on the job, they are nearly as broken as the bodies they
haul through the streets. What keeps them going is their caustic sense
of comedy, and an acrid view of a world which seems to have its
surreal epicenter in Manhattan. Frank (Nicolas Cage) is among them. He
has been doing this for 5 years and it is both his salvation and his
doom, his dream and his nightmare. When he saves someone's life
everything inside him glows and he feels as light as a feather. It's
another thing when he looses a patient. And it is those cases that
turn his life into an eternal hell. Tormented by horrible nightmares
and haunted by ghosts of the people that he didn't manage to save, he
reaches the very brink of spiritual collapse and redemption. We follow
him and his colleges during 56 hours of their lives and share the
experience of being a paramedic. Among them is the angry Tom (Tom
Sizemore), the holy Marcus (Ving Rames) and the tiered Larry (John
Goodman).</P>
<P>This is the long awaited comeback of the respected and acclaimed
director Martin Scorsese, and I can assure you that it has been worth
waiting for. Scorsese has always been a controversial director that
created some of the best films Hollywood had to offer over the
years. 'Bringing Out the Dead' doesn't have his most obvious
trademarks, since this is not a mafia-fable, there is no particular
violence or gore, and Robert De Niro is not in it. But artistically
this is certainly 'A Martin Scorsese Film'. There is no particular
story or character development. No melodrama. No climatic ending. This
is reality. There is no question about it. It is 56 hours of a
life. Scorsese, along side with Paul Schrader ('Taxi Driver') creates
incredible characters that are so real, so human and vulnerable that
we connect with them immediately. They live in a world, unknown to
us. A world of eternal night, constant death, blood and
suffering. There are periods of depression, a feeling of
worthlessness, when they are not saving anyone. They feel like
messengers of death. Confused, tormented, haunted, angry, they are all
searching for someone to blame. A way to make their pain go away. All
they feel is a constant longing for peace -- for that long forgotten
feeling of closing the eyes and simply float away. They are not
rescuers. They are not saviors. Their job is simple -- they are
brining out the dead. This is a wildly surreal film. There is a
bizarre feeling of a world within a world. Scorsese unravels his dark
vision and paints a devastating picture of madness, paranoia, fear and
death that form a void, a darkness that swallows you and doesn't let
go.  His film is explosive, expressive, fast paced and haunting. At
times Scorsese is resorting to a pitch dark comedy, without loosing
his point. "Hold this. If you let go, I swear, I won't kill you,"
Frank warns a suicidal character with another unexpected, throwaway
punchline characteristic of all film's dialogue.  But mostly Scorsese
does what he does best -- displaying the pure, na k their
frustrations, by channeling them into something else. Frank and his
friends have all gone mad in their own direction. Larry races from
diner to fast food joint, dreaming of the suburbs. Tom's way is anger,
a murderous rage, a poor attempt to enjoy the blood and death
surrounding him, that somehow compensates for the incredible pain that
he is feeling. Marcus survives by putting his trust and hope in faith,
a belief that all the death, misery and suffering happen according to
God's divine and unknown plan. But none of their coping mechanisms
work for Frank. For him life is just a void, an existence in a never
ending darkness from which there is no escape.</P>
<P>Every performance is so controlled, so perfect, so real that you never
question its authenticity. Nicolas Cage, an actor that has been
accused of being a 'paycheck player', choosing money instead of art,
shows his talent in a soulful and committed performance as the
tortured and half-crazed paramedic. He mixes downcast periods of
gloomy introspection with episodes of wild, lunatic abandon. At times
his bloodshot, tormented eyes portray more sorrow and depth than any
words that he is pronouncing. This is certainly Cage's best
performance since 'Leaving Las Vegas'. Tom Sizemore ('Heat', 'Saving
Private Ryan' ) is equally magnificent. He releases so much energy, so
much emotion and power into his performance that he looks more like a
ticking bomb rather than a person. Ving Rames ('Entrapment' ) gives a
brilliant comic performance as the 'holy medic'. There are times when
before resurrecting someone on the streets he (in a high pitched
voice) asks God's forgiveness for "these sinners". Visually and
technically this film is above perfect. Robert Richardson's
cinematography is rich and inventive, employing some crazy shots as
the camera turns the world upside down. Thelma Schoonmaker binds
Richardson's shots together with her explosive editing, fast motion,
flashing lights and neon glow. The music is provided by Elmer
Bernstein's bizarre, eclectic score and some wisely inserted songs by
Van Morrison and The Clash, among others. When all those elements are
combined, they create an almost carnival atmosphere of light and
shade, speed and violence that really gets under the skin. New York
has never looked so dark before. The streets are empty, lit only by
the pale moon, neon glow and flashing red lights of an ambulance. The
only inhabitants are shadows, filth and dust. In other words, Scorsese
has created a wildly surreal, dark and effectively paranoid motion
picture, which is the director's best work since 'Goodfellas'
(1990). Remember: This is NOT a light, entertaining popcorn-film or a
feel-good movie. It is an incred i tale, which is nothing less than a
powerful and emotionally devastating cinematic experience, created by
the maestro of shadows and light.</P>
