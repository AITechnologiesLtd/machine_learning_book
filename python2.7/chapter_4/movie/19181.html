Reviewed July 3, 1999.</PRE>
<P>An old television show (this time being the 1960s western/sci-fi series, "The 
Wild Wild West") turned into a big-screen feature film in the 1990s. Sound 
familiar? It should, considerieng that it's been done probably two dozen 
times in the last nine ten years, and not one of them have been good. Let's 
see, there was "The Flintstones," "Sgt. Bilko," "McHale's Navy," "Leave it to 
Beaver," "Maverick," "Lost in Space," "The Mod Squad,"...want me to go on?</P>
<P>Set in 1869, special government agent Jim West (Will Smith) and brilliant 
inventor and master of disguise Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) are paired 
together by President Ulysses S. Grant (Kline, again) to stop the evil 
mastermind, Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), whose legs have been 
amputated and who is planning to take over the world with a giant mechanical, 
fire-throwing tarantula. In hot pursuit of Loveless, West and Gordon hop 
aboard a train, do wacky things, get off and are captured by Loveless, are 
chased by round metal razors through a cornfield, and finally, save the 
president, as well as a scantily-clad damsel-in-distress (Salma Hayek), and 
defeat Loveless and his entourage. The End.</P>
<P>If you are wondering what happened to the rest of the movie, or think that 
I'm exaggerating, I'm not. Basically, what you see in the trailer is what you 
get, and nothing more. 100 minutes long, but seeming more like an hour, "Wild 
Wild West" is the latest brainless special-effects extravaganza without any 
thought going into the story or characters. The film is an empty-headed 
excursion, not excruciating to sit through, but who would want to waste their 
money on something a 10-year-old could have written with more dimensions? A 
terrible sign to begin with, the screenplay was written by not one, not two, 
not three, but four different people who would probably prefer to remain 
nameless.</P>
<P>As Jim West, Will Smith is Will Smith, still the suave, wise-cracking hero 
who saves the day. Kevin Kline is clearly the more accomplished thespian and 
he proves it here, even in the midst of the intellectually dead story. Kline 
does wring a few laughs out of the screenplay, but something tells me that 
most of it was improvised and those jokes that work owe more than a little to 
his comic skills. Kenneth Branagh, as the wily Dr. Loveless, is doing nothing 
but grabbing a paycheck and running (at least, I hope, since those optical 
effects of his amputated legs are awfully realistic). And then we come to 
Salma Hayek, such a charming actress who is always far more funny and 
well-used when she makes talk show appearances, as opposed to appearing in 
movies. Hayek is fresh-faced, giddy, and is so severely wasted that, if I 
didn't know better, would guess she filmed all of her underwritten scenes in 
one day.</P>
<P>The only true saving grace of "Wild Wild West" is the marvelous production 
design by Bo Welch that is always fun to look at, and the offbeat music score 
by Elmer Bernstein. Too bad what we are watching within these technical 
aspects is devoid of any original ideas, and rarely any sort of comedic wit.</P>
<P>"Wild Wild West" is Will Smith's third film in the last four years to open on 
the 4th of July weekend. After meeting box-office success with the junky 
"Independence Day" and the empty "Men in Black" (which was also directed by 
"WWW" filmmaker, Barry Sonnenfeld), Smith's luck may have finally run out. 
Last year's "Enemy of the State" was a step in the right direction, but Smith 
next needs to prove that he can appear in more worthwhile film (as he did in 
1993's excellent drama, "Six Degrees of Seperation"), rather than wasting his 
time on overblown Hollywood products that exit the viewers' minds as soon as 
they leave the theater. That, in a nutshell, is exactly the case of the 
not-very-wild "Wild Wild West."</P>
