<PRE>                                KANSAS CITY
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: KANSAS CITY is strong on period
          atmosphere and is unusual for an Altman film in
          that there are relatively few plot strands to tie
          together.  Jennifer Jason Leigh gives  terrific
          performance as a very uncommon common woman.  While
          there are a few too many jazz interludes for most
          viewers of the film, the story is rich in texture
          and in irony.  Rating:  +2 (-4 to +4).  Warning:
          minor plot spoilers.  It is tough to tell the
          premise of the film without telling a little that
          is mysterious in the first half hour of the film.</PRE>
<P>     KANSAS CITY is something of a departure from Robert Altman's
recent style of telling many different stories simultaneously, then
letting them all come together at the end.  In KANSAS CITY he is really
back to telling a single story, though it takes a little while for one
of the plot threads to be tied into the mainline of the story.  In the
screenplay which he co-authored with Frank Barhydt, Altman returns to
the city of his youth to direct a story about crime, race, class, and
politics.</P>
<P>     The setting is Kansas City, Missouri, in 1934.  Blondie O'Hara
(played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) is in a real fix.  Her husband Johnny
(Dermot Mulroney) has robbed a taxicab, using burnt cork to make
himself look black.  Now the oddly-named Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte),
the local crime boss, has Johnny and is going to kill him.  Blondie
realizes that that she cannot get Seldom to let the man she loves go.
Faced with an immovable object she decides to unleash the only
irresistible force she knows.  She has to convince the local Democratic
political machine to go in with its hired muscle to do the job of
freeing her husband.  And how is she going to convince them to do that?
She has a weird scheme to kidnap Carolyn Stilton (Miranda Richardson)
the socialite wife of a Democrat high muckimuck (Michael Murphy) and
force him to unleash the muscle of the political machine to save her
husband.  Much of the film is the interplay between Blondie O'Hara and
Carolyn Stilton.  Meanwhile Johnny O'Hara is a prisoner at the Hey-Hey
Club as Seldom Seen plays a cat and mouse game with him.</P>
<P>     All this happens to the background strains of the music at the
Hey-Hey Club, except when the music is dragged to the foreground and
the story-telling drags to a halt.  Altman obviously expected that a
big part of the show would be to hear the music of current jazz greats
playing anachronistically in 1934.  His heart was clearly in the right
place, but even his telling of the mainline plot is a little slow and
deliberate and people who are not fans of jazz may find his use of it
in longish interludes excessive.  As with many Altman films, the story
cannot be fully assessed until the film is over and much of what the
film is saying is encompassed in the last five minutes.  This is a
story of insular people who think they understand each other but who
actually have gulfs of race and class separating them more than they
realize.</P>
<P>     It has taken me a long time to come around on Jennifer Jason
Leigh.  For a while I have noted that she has done a good job with this
role and with that one and never thought much about it.   But I really
think now I think she is just about the best character actress of her
generation.  Although it is said more visually than verbally, it is
clear that Blondie is a woman absolutely obsessed with films and in
particular with Jean Harlow films, since it is suggested that with
bleached blond hair she resembles Harlow.  From the first moment we see
her she is dressed and made up in the style of women of 1930s films.
We learn a great deal about Blondie, but Carolyn remains a cipher
through much of the film.  We are never really sure what she is
thinking or if she is thinking under the laudanum haze into which she
sinks at every opportunity.  It is, of course, good to see Harry
Belafonte acting and for much of the film he seems in control of his
character.  At one point the character seems to run away with him and
as he goes off into a babbling tirade about what he is doing, about
racism, and about why he disagrees with Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa
movement.  One feels that the plot intended this speech to be more
coherent and cogent than it actually came out.</P>
<P>     Altman does not so much put period feel into the film as saturate
the film in a bath of rich period atmosphere.  Though the viewer has to
look quick to place the film's exact year, every scene seems to have an
exaggerated 1930s feel.  Everything looks very 1930s.  Whether or not
people dressed in real life like Blondie does, she certainly looks like
women in 1930s films.  Altman slightly disorients his viewers with a
non-chronological telling of the story in the early parts of the film.
Perhaps he thinks that the early part of his films should be
disorienting.  In any case, the story-telling becomes much more
straightforward once he gets into the meat of the story.  While not a
perfect film, 1930s Kansas City certainly does a lot more to keep the
film interesting than 1990s Los Angeles did for SHORT CUTS.  This is
the most intriguing Altman film in quite a while.  I rate it a +2 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
