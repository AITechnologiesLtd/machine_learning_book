                               GODZILLA</PRE>
<P>As the ad's double entendre proclaims, "Size Does Matter"    Godzilla
Is BIG.</P>
<P>In a little in-joke, scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick)
is named after Patrick Tatopoulos, the designer of the creature
Godzilla.  The original creature  is based on the Godzilla character
owned by and created by Toho Co. Ltd. in 1954.   Another, not quite
as "in",  is having New York's Mayor named Ebert (because Roger
Ebert looks a bit like like Michael Lerner who has that role).   When
the Godzilla is finally taken care of, the mayor looks for ways his
administration can take credit.</P>
<P>In some spectacular special effects, made possible in part by new
computer graphics software and technology, the film is as real as one
could imagine.   For those displaced New Yorkers like me, it really
looked as if the Chrysler Building and Brooklyn Bridge were being
toppled by the huge creature with every giant step it took, as well as
demolishing Madison Avenue.  Very realistic.</P>
<P>The film starts with a ship at sea.  As a blinding flash of lightning
and accompanying thunder crash across the screen, the ship heaves and
tosses about on huge waves.   News soon reaches the world that several
ships have overturned for no apparent reason and are lost in the
ocean.     In other parts of the world, investigators are baffled by
giant footprints marching across the lands of Panamanian forests,
Tahitian villages and Jamaican beaches.    Dr. Tatopoulos is called in
to help solve the mystery when it is discovered that a giant animal is
wreaking destruction in Manhattan.</P>
<P>As in the original GODZILLA, the story is that it is nuclear radiation
that has caused the monster to grow to its present height. While
Director Emmerich enjoyed the original he was not about to make an
American remake.    The story then concentrates on scariness.  What
do you do about a huge creature that is like the proverbial bull in
a China shop, knocking over buildings and causing untold havoc?</P>
<P>Fortunately, the story, by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Dean Devlin
and Roland Emmerich,  and the screenplay by Dean Devlin and Roland
Emmerich, made sure the characters in the story were real people.  The
parts of scientist Tatopoulos, called back from Chernobyl where he was
investigating unusually fat worms caused by the irradiation at that
disaster site,  and of the French insurance investigator, Philippe
Roache (Jean Reno) were written with them in mind.   The Roache
character is unhappy that the French Government has tested so many
nuclear bombs in the Pacific.     Other unthinking countries have done
their nuclear testing in the Pacific and elsewhere with no regard to
the inhabitants of those areas nor to the consequences.  Mutations are
happening all over the globe and the fictional Godzilla is but one example.</P>
<P>All in all an entertaining film with some great special effects and a
more or less warmed over  but adequate story.    Others in the film
are Hank Azaria as an intrepid  photographer, Maria Pitillo as the
love (small) interest, Harry Shearer as a newscaster who thinks he
would like her as a Washington-type "intern."</P>
