<PRE>THREE SEASONS (PG).  
(Dendy Films)
Director: Tony Bui
Stars: Harvey Keitel, Don Duong, Nguyen Ngoc Hiep, Tran Manh Cuong, Zoe 
Bui, Nguyen Huu Doc
Running time: 109 minutes
(Vietnamese, with English subtitles).</PRE>
<P>This sublime and beautiful looking low budget feature is the
first American film to be shot in Vietnam since the end of the war.
In his assured first feature, director Tony Bui pays homage to his
native country, shaped by massive destruction and upheaval.  Even two
decades later, the country is still undergoing an enormous period of
cultural, social and political change, and trying to come to terms
with its legacy.</P>
<P>Born in Vietnam but raised in America, Bui's dual background
gives him a rare insight into this sense of uncertainty, of being
caught between two cultures.  He directs with a sense of compassion
and insight, and puts a human face on this tortured country.  The
movie is filled with a sense of despair and loss, but it also
resonates with a spirit of optimism and a very real humanity.</P>
<P>Three Seasons actually consists of three or four tales, all
loosely woven together by the subtext of a nation's search for its own
identity.  The central characters of these stories come to
symbolically represent Vietnam's past, present and future.</P>
<P>Kien An (Ngoc Hiep) works on a farm, where she picks lotuses
which she sells on the streets of Saigon.  She also captures the
attention of Dao (Manh Cuong), a reclusive poet who suffers from
disfiguring leprosy and has lost his inspiration to write.  She soon
becomes his muse, and inspires him to write again.  Hai (Don Duong)
drives his cyclo through Saigon, and falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui),
a prostitute who plies her trade at some of the city's most luxurious
hotels.  Woody (Nguyen Huu Doc) is a young boy who braves even the
foulest weather to sell trinkets to tourists at hotels.  When his bag
goes missing, he suspects an American (Harvey Keitel) of stealing it.</P>
<P>Keitel, who is also credited as one of the executive
producers, delivers a more restrained performance than usual as an
American who has returned to Saigon to find the daughter he fathered
during the war.  Apart from Keitel, the cast comprises solely of
Vietnamese actors who do not speak English, while the crew is made up
of a combination of American and Vietnamese technicians.  Lisa
Rinzler's gorgeous cinematography creates some exquisite visuals and
lyrical images, and deservedly won a prize at this year's Sundance
Film Festival.  Richard Horowitz's music beautifully complements the
evocative visuals, adding to the film's haunting quality.</P>
<P>But, while Three Seasons is visually quite rich, the movie is,
at times, a little dull and slow paced, and may not appeal to all
tastes.</P>
