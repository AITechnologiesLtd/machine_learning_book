<PRE> The Apostle</PRE>
<PRE> Directed by
 Robert Duvall </PRE>
<P> You can't really do one man shows in the cinema. Oh, people have tried, but on
 the whole it doesn't really work. so Robert Duvall doesn't bother in his
 latest opus. It's close, though.</P>
<P> Duvall is The Reverend Euliss `Sonny' Dewey, a televangelist from Texas, who
 spends so much time on the job that he neglects his wife Jessie(Farrah
 Fawcett) and children. Jessie retaliates by having an affair with another
 preacher named Horace(Todd Allen), for whom she grabs control of the ministry.</P>
<P> Upset at this turn of events, Sonny gets drunk and bashes Horace's head in
 with a baseball bat before fleeing.</P>
<P> Justly wanted for murder, Sonny goes to Louisiana, where he takes the identity
 of The Apostle E.F. and begins his ministry anew.</P>
<P> Along the way he meets a fellow who send him to Brother Blackwell(John
 Beasley), a retired minister who owns a derelict church which is restored by
 Sonny and where he starts his new ministry.</P>
<P> While there is a failed romance with Miranda Richardson, who plays the
 receptionist at a local radio station, everyone else is just a prop for Duval
 to spout religion at and do his Billy Sol Hargus routine for.</P>
<P> He's good at it, too. But the flaw(if you can call it that) here is the same
 as Scorcese's `Kundun,' unless you go in for that sort of thing, what's the
 point? It barely works as a character study.</P>
<P> This is great performance, but alas, not a great movie.</P>
