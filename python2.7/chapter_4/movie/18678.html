<PRE>Instinct
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4) INSTINCT is that odd movie that is thought-provoking and
worth talking about, yet is still somehow bad. </P>
<P>INSTINCT is "suggested by" Daniel Quinn's book ISHMAEL, in which a
talking gorilla takes a human student. Using the Socratic method, he
teaches the student to see humanity, materialism, development, and human
culture, through the eyes of a simpler, less greedy soul. Most of the
book is filled with their telepathic conversation. It's pretty
unfilmable stuff.</P>
<P>Naturally, INSTINCT diverges from the book in many ways. The "teacher"
is now Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins), the anthropologist who has just
been found after disappearing for two years. During that time he lived
among a tribe of African gorillas. He has not spoken since his return to
civilization.</P>
<P>The "student" is now Theo (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a psychiatrist just
completing his residency. Theo hears about Ethan and is intrigued. He
pulls every string he has in order to get Ethan's case. (The "Socratic
method" is now a power trip, complete with death threats.) </P>
<P>Screenwriter Gerald Di Pego (who also wrote Turteltaub's PHENOMENON)
does a great job of introducing Theo's character. His ingenious gamble
helps a paranoid patient have a breakthrough. And yet the scene is still
formulaic. Replace "psychiatrist" with "hostage negotiator" and you'd
have the same opening scene as two or three cop movies in the last year.</P>
<P>This pattern of small pockets of greatness in an otherwise bad script is
repeated throughout the movie.</P>
<PRE>A few examples:</PRE>
<P>Theo gives an emotional speech at the end. Gooding gives a top-notch
performance, and the actions of his character make the speech seem
appropriate. But the specific words of his speech sound so written and
hollow, that it's almost hard to take it seriously. </P>
<P>Much of the movie takes place in a psychiatric prison, where a random
system is used for determining who gets fresh air privileges. But the
system is such that the strong can attack the weak and steal the
privilege, making the dysfunctional patients seem even more animal-like.
The whole prison seems to be a system of dominance and submission, so
that watching the movie is much like studying aggression in animals. But
the characters are treated as human props. They aren't well developed.
Their few actions are motivated by the script and not by any emotional
soul.</P>
<P>It's hard to go wrong on the cinematography when you have a lush jungle
to film. But when Anthony Hopkins breasts the utopian green hilltop, it
seems like stock footage from a time-share sales pitch. It's too easy
and obvious and it doesn't add to the character or the film.</P>
<P>One final point is worth noting. Danny Elfman composed the score for
this film. Usually, when Elfman is involved, you can tell by listening.
For the BATMAN movies he scored circus music into his orchestra. For A
SIMPLE PLAN he had the violins play just off-key enough to make you
squirm. But in INSTINCT, there is no quirk, no distinctive signature. It
seemed like a waste of Elfman's particular talents.</P>
<P>In all fairness, I found this movie to be a great conversation piece.
All the sparkling good ideas were memorable enough to grab onto and
examine more closely. But that's not enough to recommend it.</P>
<P>Turteltaub's last movie was PHENOMENON, which was a melodramatic drop of
syrup that I savored (yes, more than once.) But INSTINCT is somehow
harder to swallow. I couldn't tell if you if it was too sweet or too
insubstantial, but somehow, the recipe just wasn't right.</P>
