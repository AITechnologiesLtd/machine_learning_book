<P>      If you've ever visited the Offices Gallery in Florence, Italy,
you doubtless saw the most dramatic painting in the hall,
"Judith Beheading Holofemis," inspired by a biblical story. 
You don't have to look closely at it to guess that it's the work
of a woman painter.  Two women are standing over the
bearded, defeated general Holofemis, one holding a sword at
his neck, the other helping to hold him down to a bed.  It
almost looks like a rape scene initiated by the women, and
perhaps its passionate painter wanted to give the work a
double meaning.  Any art student worth his or her palette
would be impatient to know more about the painter, and any
generalist with a broad education would be enthusiastic about
hearing the story.  If you were accompanied in the gallery by
a decent guide with the appropriate background and an ardor
for teaching his tourists and students, your curiosity would be
at a fever pitch.</P>
<P>   Luckily, there is now a film about the painter, and what an
artist she was...in fact she was for all practical purposes the
first woman painter in art history--just as Aphra Behn is today
considered (for the same practical purposes) to be the first
woman playwright.  Why?  Both Behn and the subject of the
movie, Artemisia Gentileschi, were paid for what they did. 
Essentially, Artemisia was the first woman painter we know
who was commissioned for her work.  Agnes Merlet's
"Artemisia" is a French production featuring in the starring
roles an Italian, Valentina Cervi, whom you might have
recognized for her role in "Portrait of a Lady;" a Frenchman,
Michel Serrault, who should need no introduction and would
be known even by the general audience who saw him in "The
Birdcage;" and a Serb, Miki Manojlovic, who played a starring
role in Emil Kusturica's "Underground."  All speak French
fluently in the film.</P>
<P>   You don't have to be an artist or student of painting to know
that there's an intimate connection between passion and
creativity.  Often the passion is of a sexual nature.  We
observe that the great Florentine painter of the Seventeenth
Century, Agostino Tassi (Miki Manojlovic), was a frequent
guest at bordellos, and modern audience will accept the fact
that Artemisia (Valentina Cervi) is herself inspired in her own
work by her intimate relationship with Agostino.  But in the
year 1610, the idea that a 17-year-old woman would have an
interest in drawing the nude male body or would cavort with a
man not her husband was anathema; positively sinful. 
Artemisia had such interests--not that this preoccupation
prevented her from acceptance in the prestigious Academy in
which her father, Orazio Gentileschi (Michel Serrault) and
Agostino are members.  She was a woman and painting was
simply not considered the proper occupation for the fair sex,
even if she were concerned only with landscapes.</P>
<P>   "Artemesia," then, is based on the true story of the world's
first recognized woman artist, written by its director, who was
a student at the School of Fine Arts in Orleans.  Using her
imagination to fill in the blanks where the actual facts are a
matter of conjecture, she displays for us a colorful account. 
There is one major disappointment: it exhibits the subject's
works only superficially, preferring to concentrate on the
romance between Artemisia and her teacher, Agostino, as if
Ms. Merlet felt that the movie would thereby appeal to a larger
audience.  For better or worse (depending on the viewer's
predilections), she avoids the gauzy look of the Merchant-
Ivory films, portraying her characters with almost matter-of-
fact realism.  Perhaps Ms. Merlet wants to impress us with
the truthfulness of the account, fearing that a gossamer look
would have us believe the story was simply the product of an
energetic imagination.</P>
<P>   Merlet takes us first to a scene in Rome where an
ensemble of painters are belting out a flurry of drawings and
paintings of saints and angels, all inspired by a Papal
commission.  Orazio seems to have been the most successful
of the group, and has taught her daughter Artemisia all that
he knows.  But now a younger man, Agostino, is gaining
favor, particularly with the nobility, for exploiting innovations in
the field, particularly with the use of light and shade to
enhance the stories portrayed on the canvasses.  While
Artemisia is refused admission to the Academy purely on
gender grounds, her father convinces the great Agostino to
take her on as a pupil.  Artemisia, who has shown a healthy
desire to paint the nude male body and who has used a
fisherman, Fulvio (Yahn Tregouet) as a model, is enthusiastic. 
When Artemisia and Agostino's relationship evolve to more
than that of a student and pupil, her father is incensed and
accuses the young man of rape.  A trial ensues.  Given the
subordinate position of women throughout most of civilization,
it is no wonder that this tribunal is one of the first in history
ever to consider such a charge.</P>
<P>   A film of this nature runs the risk of being considered a
woman's movie and, in fact, at a recent critics's screening,
over 3/4 of the audience were women.  Given the feminist
emphasis of the film, such an constituency is more likely than
one composed of painters.  To ghettoize this--or any other
film--based on genre or accent would be to do it a disservice,
and "Artemisia" deserves to be seen by film buffs of both
genders.  "Artemisia" is well-acted, with an imposing
soundtrack of both baroque and contemporary music, which
avoids pontification and any form of didactic narration.  Merely
a second feature of a gifted director, "Artemisia" will hopefully
encourage Ms. Merlet to tackle similar films of prominent
women who have made historic firsts but who even today are
known only by others in similar fields of endeavor.  Not Rated.
