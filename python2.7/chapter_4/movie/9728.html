<PRE>PULP FICTION
A review by David Wilcock
(C)1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING JOHN TRAVOLTA, SAMUEL L. JACKSON, UMA THURMAN and BRUCE
WILLIS
DIRECTED BY QUENTIN TARINTINO
A TOUCHSTONE PICTURES RELEASE</PRE>
<P>After his stunning debut, Resevoir Dogs, Tarintino followed it up with
four tales all interlinked with each other. Each story is well
written, well acted, and well directed. It's is one of the most clever
films out there.</P>
<P>The film starts with two people (Amander Plummer and Tim Roth)
discussing robbery in a restaurant, and then they rob the
restaurant.We then get to the four stories. In the first story,
Travolta and Jackson are excellent as two hitmen who have to kill some
kids who haven't been following their bosses orders. It's horribly
violent, yet wickedly funny at the same time, and actually quite
scary. The second story concerns Travolta taking out the bosses wife,
played by Uma Thurman. Unfortunatley for him, she has a drug overdose,
and he has to try and get her back. Again, it's another funny story,
and well acted again. The third story concerns a boxer, Bruce Willis,
trying to get back his gold watch (although there's a lot more to it
than that), and the final story is continuing what happens at the
start of the film, with Travolta and Jackson trying to control Plummer
and Roth. It's another tense scene, still funny, but terrifying. It's
a masterpiece of direction and acting.</P>
<P>Of course, the film is full of swearing, extreme violence (although
not as bad as Natural Born Killers, it's a bit more violent than Dogs)
and even a bit of rape (the Deliverance way) Although not quite as
'gritty' as Dogs, the violence is still shocking. It's played more for
laughs though, and, of course, it's full of Tarintino's witty
dialouge. The film looks really good, especially the diner where
Thurman takes Travolta. There's a fantastic soundtrack running
throughout. This film has all the hallmarks of a classic. Naturally,
it was totally ignored by the OSCARS, but did win the Palme D'or at
Cannes. Be warned though, this film is not for the faint of heart, and
is not really a good film to show the kids either. But overall, this
is a brilliant, witty, violent masterpiece. Rent it out now!</P>
