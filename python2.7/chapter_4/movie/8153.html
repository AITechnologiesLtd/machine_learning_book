<P>Tommy Boy
Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair)
1995, PG-13, 98 minutes [1 hour, 38 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Chris Farley (Tommy), David Spade (Richard), Julie Warner
(Michelle), Rob Lowe (Paul), written by Bonnie and Terry Turner, Fred Wolf,
produced by Lorne Michaels, directed by Peter Segal.</P>
<P>"Tommy Boy" may be the most generic comedy I've ever seen. It's not really a
movie, but more of a 98 minute-long sit-com. Sometimes it's funny, but in a
dumbed-down way.</P>
<P>Chris Farley stars as Tommy Callahan, an idiot manchild who is about to
inherit the family  auto parts manufacturing company (idiot child heir -
generic comedy plot #1). His dad is the president of the company and wants
Tommy to take over when he retires, but he's doubts Tommy's smart enough to
handle the job. Mr. Callahan is also marrying a beautiful woman who has a
suspicious son (the mysterious fiancee - generic comedy plot #2). </P>
<P>We also meet Richard (Spade), the smartass young manager who handles
everything and doesn't want to be bothered with having to work with idiotic
Tommy (the smartass assistant - generic comedy plot #3). Of course Tommy's
father does marry the beautiful mistress, but he also dies on the same day.
Due to his death the company starts to crumble financially. If they can't
sell a half million brake pads within three weeks they'll be forced to sell
to an out-of-town distributor (the monetary deadline - generic comedy plot
#4). So Tommy and Richard set off on a cross-country trip to sell the brake
pads themselves and single-handedly save the company (the road trip - generic
comedy plot #5). </P>
<P>Slapstick comedy was invented and perfected by Charlie Chaplin, but that was
because he was making silent movies without dialogue. Modern films [should]
depend on dialogue for humor, not people getting hit in the groin with and
walking into walls, etc. And that is what we get with this film, which seems
like nothing more than a live action version of "The Roadrunner and Wile E.
Coyote." After a while the slapstick and total stupidity become predictable
and repetitive. Even the one-liners are only a little funny.</P>
<P>Even though the slapstick element is stupid, it's still kinda fun to watch
Farley who relishes in his silliness. To show a customer how important his
brake pads are he uses expensive model cars and acts like a 5-year-old,
screaming and yelling and smashes the cars and sets them on fire. In another
scene he runs from the police screaming, "Killer bees are stinging my flesh
off!" Stuff like this is funny at the time, but in retrospect, that's not
intelligent comedy.</P>
<P>It's not that "Tommy Boy" is or isn't funny, it's just not a good film to
begin with. Had it been more original it would have been OK, but what we get
is at least watchable. </P>
