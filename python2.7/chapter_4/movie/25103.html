                              100% ARABICA
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     There must be something about Muslim-French-Algerian immigrant
culture that gets lost in translation to white-boy-from-Texas culture. 
Reportedly a comedy, 100% Arabica is so steeped in the obscure
subculture of French-Muslim tradition and Algerian Rai music that
westerners are going to have a hard time relating to the movie.</P>
<P>     To make any sense of it, you have to think of 100% Arabica as a
French-Algerian version of The Full Monty.  In a neighborhood on the
outskirts of Paris, a group of dirt-poor Algerian immigrant musicians
want nothing more than to infuse their traditional Algerian Rai music
with western rap sounds and play to packed houses in the 'hood. 
Unfortunately, an evil and corrupt mosque-running mafia zealot named
Slimane wants to stomp the music out, and the groups clash.</P>
<P>     From what I could gather (okay, so I read it in the press notes),
there's a mayor running for reelection who sides with Slimane... and,
well, I kind of got lost after that.  If 100% Arabica was a better-made
movie I would have watched it again, but as it stands, it's really just
a haphazard collection of scenes of the "Rap 'n Rai" musicians
performing followed by scenes of Slimane threatening people.  And
something with a pork truck.  The film abruptly ends 82 minutes after
beginning, leaving you thoroughly confused.</P>
<P>     I will give it one thing, that Rai music is certainly something
else.  And that pork truck is a trip.</P>
