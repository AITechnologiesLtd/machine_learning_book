<P>Kevin Williamson-less sequel to the US$107 million original I KNOW WHAT
YOU DID LAST SUMMER (7.5/10). This follow-up features the tightest
shirt in the West, Jennifer Love Hewitt, a dash of Brandy (the singer,
that is), and British director Danny Cannon at the helm, the man behind
the abominable JUDGE DREDD (5.5/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
One year after the original summer murders in her hometown, Julie
(Hewitt) has yet to overcome her fears, but has managed to move onto
College, a new love interest and a new spicy roommate. After winning a
trip to the Bahamas, Julie and her newfound friends find themselves in
a similar predicament as the psycho fisherman with hook as hand, slices
and guts his way to their extinction. Screams and murders ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
The paper-thin plot, the cheap thrills, and all of the clinging wet
shirts that you could shake a stick at, make this follow-up to the
slick original, a standard 90's horror fare without much to get excited
about. Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as the girl who can never seem to
button her blouse all the way to the top in this transparent sequel,
which never seems to take off from its predecessor's solid base.</P>
<P>Many of the killings in this film are pretty obvious, while the plot
seemed ridden with holes. For example, we are never told why the killer
is killing everyone in his path in this one. Or for that matter, how
everyone on the island suddenly disappears within a 24-hour period.
Then again, horror films weren't exactly known for their Oscar worthy
scripts, but this one just doesn't seem to bring anything original to
the table. The dialogue was standard and dull, the acting was there but
not fascinating, and the mystery of the killer wasn't as cool as it
could have been.</P>
<P>Having said that, I did enjoy some of the murders in this film, Jeffrey
Combs' standout performance as the pissed-off hotel owner, and the
continued creepiness of the killer's fisherman's outfit. Also, Mekhi
Phifer was funny as the horny guy who just can't seem to get laid, and
Freddie Prinze actually acts a little in this one. Also, I will admit
that I did not turn away at the umpteen shots of Jennifer Love Hewitt
in her cut-off tight shirts and bikinis. For further analyses of her
extremely ample assets, please visit this hilarious gentleman's
homepage at <A HREF="http://jenlovehewitt.simplenet.com/">http://jenlovehewitt.simplenet.com/</A> who minutely breaks her
success down into a couple of specific prize possessions. This film
also delivered the most rain in any film since the stunning SEVEN
(8.5/10). All in all, it's okay as a generic piece of 90's horror game,
with the cheap thrills and fun kills for showcase. On the other hand,
it doesn't really attain any of the mystery of the original, but then
again, most sequels don't. See it if you're bored and want to turn your
brain off for a while and charge up your woodie, otherwise skip this
limp sequel and munch on some snacks with the original classics SCREAM
(8/10) and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (7.5/10).</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Jennifer Love Hewitt once dated actor Joey Lawrence. She has released
two CDs, "Let's Go Bang" in 1995 and "Love Songs" in 1992 under Love
Hewitt. She also plays Sarah Reeves in TV "Party of Five" series,
alongside the SCREAM (8/10) queen herself Neve Campbell. Jennifer's
bust size is reported to be 36C.
Jennifer also has her own romantic comedy screenplay "Marry Me Jane" in
development at New Line Cinema. It's about a wedding planner who falls
for one of her betrothed clients.
Brandy also stars in her own TV sitcom called "Moesha". She went with
the NBA's Kobe Bryant to his high school prom. Kobe is best known for
jumping from high school straight to the NBA.
Both Hewitt and Brandy have reportedly signed on for a third
installment of Last Summer.
Freddie Prinze Jr. considers his big break to be his four-line part in
TV's "Family Matters" in which he played a punk kid who brought a gun
to school.</P>
