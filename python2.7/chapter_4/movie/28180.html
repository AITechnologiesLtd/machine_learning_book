Susan Granger's review of  "ALONG CAME A SPIDER" (Paramount Pictures)</P>
<P>  Morgan Freeman is back as savvy Washington D.C. police
detective Alex Cross in this psychological suspense thriller adapted
from James Patterson's novel, actually a prequel to "Kiss the Girls."
The story begins as Cross retreats into retirement after the death of
his partner but catapults into action when Megan Rose (Mika Boorem),
the 12 year-old daughter of a Senator, is kidnapped from her posh
private school, right under the nose of Jezzie Flannigan (Monica
Potter), the Secret Service agent in charge of security. As Cross is
watching the news on TV, his phone rings and the electronically
altered voice of Gary Soneji, the kidnapper (Michael Wincott), tells
him to look in his mailbox. There sits the girl's shoe. It seems this
psychopath wants to copy the Charles Lindbergh baby kidnapping,
committing another "crime of the century." So, while the Feds don't
appreciate his involvement, Cross has credible expertise they don't
have - like using tiny details to profile Soneji as "a spider." So
does disgraced Jezzie Flannigan, who's distraught that she "dropped
the ball." So it's their job not only to find Soneji but to rescue
Megan Rose.</P>
<P>   Marc Moss's well-constructed script actually improves on
the novel, adding unexpected twists and turns, involving
double-crosses, deception and duplicity. And director Lee Tamahori
keeps the pace fast and the tension taut, staging an intricate race
through the streets of Washington, D.C., culminating in a convoluted
ransom drop. There are several problems involving logic, not the least
being that the Secret Service does not protect children of Senators,
but on the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Along Came a Spider" is
slick, solid, escapist 8. It's great to see an actor as classy and
good as Morgan Freeman propelling a franchise like this.</P>
