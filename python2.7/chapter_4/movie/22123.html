<P>Five years after his directorial debut based on Stephen King's writings
called THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (9/10), writer/director Frank Darabont
returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous
scribblings of Stephen King. Unlike the latter film, this one is a big,
long, laborious bore.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film is slow, drawn-out, boring, uninteresting, unexciting, predictable
and topped with a couple of one-dimensional "evil" characters. Its only
positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its
message of hope and belief in miracles. The real miracle of my night was the
fact that I did not fall asleep during this straightforward, unimpressive
film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care
about. Of course, much like all other death row cell blocks, this one is
filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "misunderstood", except for
one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified. And let's not forget
all the guards on death row, who also happen to be angels from the Heaven
above, except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified
(and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears
to be no more than three inmates???). Am I supposed to identify with anyone
in this film? Or even more importantly, am I supposed to give a rat's ass
about anyone in this film? Well, if I was, I sure missed that boat, because
the only thing that I ended up caring about during this entire picture was
the obscene amount of fat that Tom Hanks has been able to burrow under his
loose chin.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is absolutely no reason in the world why director Frank
Darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to
present this story. In fact, the story is empty within itself. I truly did
not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on
death row who has special powers to heal, and we are left wondering if he
should still be executed or not. Wow. How interesting <yawn>. The plot's
utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to
get healed by the gentle monster in this film (we are told that one certain
lady has a tumor early on in the movie). Whip out those thinking caps, kids!
Hmmm, and I wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "evil" guys
who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity. Hmmmm, now think
hard here, boys and girls. What a crock! I am guessing that this film was
supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality, but unfortunately
for me, it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging. In fact, it was
one big bore. I didn't see the point of the movie, I didn't see the point of
the story and I certainly didn't see the point in Tom Hanks' big
double-chin. All in all, a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid
work, especially Michael Clarke Duncan as the man of the hour, John Coffey.
Give that man an award or something!</P>
