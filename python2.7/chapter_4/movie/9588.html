<P>    Where to start. This movie has all the substance and believability
of a Steven Segal movie. It's almost hard to fathom that Warner Bros.
actually greenlighted this waste of celluloid that people have the
nerve to call a "movie".</P>
<P>    "B&R" had all the right stuff, it seemed, on paper; a solid cast, a
normally reliable director, and a credible studio backing. It's the
writing and director Joel Schumacher's cartoonish direction that
flushed  it down the drain straight to movie hell.</P>
<P>    The "plot" suffered from the odd sensation of not quite having a
start, beginning, and an end. It starts off decently with the opening
credits, and the very well done score by Danny Elfman. Things start
going south with the very first line of the movie, spoken
unconvincingly and quite annoyingly by O'Donnell. The rest of the movie
is a wretched mix of cartoonish action, horrible one-liners, insipid
dialogue, an endless sea of neon objects, and way too many Bat-tools to
keep track of.</P>
<P>    It's hard to believe this is from the same guy that directed
"Batman Forever" and "A Time to Kill". Much of the "action" asks the
viewer to suspend reality to an unrealistic degree. Scenes with Robin
flying through the air, Freeze swinging from vines, the rocket from the
back of the Freezemobile, never mind that at 30,000 feet any normal
human would die, never mind that we're asked to believe Robin can hang
on the side of launched rocket traveling at a velocity sufficient
enough to send it into orbit by virtue of Bat-magnets.</P>
<P>    The cast, while on paper seemed right, was overridden with bad
lines. Viewers are delt a barrage of terrible one-liners and puns. And
oh, there is way too many comments referring to coldness, ice, freeze,
etc. To call it a dialogue is a gross overstatement. Clooney was decent
choice to play Bruce Wayne/Batman, but he wasn't really acting in the
movie. He did what he does in almost every roles he's given which is
basically charm the audience, head tilt and all. Arnold gives what
might arguably his worst ever performance in his entire career. It
seems that lately, only James Cameron is able to squeeze out a passable
line out of him. Poison Ivy spent the half the movie talking to
herself. O'Donnell's Robin was quite the little punk, and his
rebellious character got old to the point that one would hope Batman
goes solo his next time out. It doesn't say much for a movie when the
best acting was done by a supporting character, which in this case,
Alfred is expertly played as always by Gough. When Alfred's mortality
becomes an issue, it adds the only real character depth to the movie,
but it's much too little. Other cameos (Elle Macpherson, Vivica Fox) in
this movie were so incidental as to be almost forgettable. Silverstone
was, well, Silverstone.</P>
<P>    The most glaring fault was the departure from the traditional
"Batman" mood set so well in the comics. Gotham is a dark, moody city
even in the daytime and Tim Burton set this tone brilliantly in the
first "Batman". Same goes for the Batcave, which is made up to resemble
a laser-tag arena. It's not this bright, neon-slathered pseudo-Las
Vegas Schumacher makes it out to be. Batman himself is a dark,
brooding, character who doesn't say much to begin with while Bruce
Wayne is an suave yet slightly awkward person. Clooney, while looking
very much the part, doesn't help by trying to add a lighter side to
both. Also in the comics, Robin is hardly a partner to Batman. nor is
he such a rebellious brat as shown here. These faults are due mainly to
the director and the writing staff.</P>
<P>    Character moments suffered in this movie. There is almost no
development into the relationship between Wayne and his current
girlfriend Julie Madison. The bickering between Batman and Robin gets
old real fast. Freeze's desires to freeze the world is mentioned only
in passing, just the audience has some idea why he's doing this, and
how he came to be this way. The only parts worth watching in the movie
is the too-brief moments between Bruce and Alfred. The mildly touching
scenes adds a touch of humanity to an otherwise gimmicky movie.</P>
<P>    The Batman movie series has always been about the villains, and
here it falls flat on it's face for the reasons mentioned. Also
straying from the comic norm is the character of Bane. In the comics,
Bane is intelligent as well as inhumanely strong, not the brainless,
monosyllabic lump  he's portrayed as here. Despite going maniacally
overboard, neither Freeze or Ivy measure up to the villains played any
of the previous movies.</P>
<P>    The entire movie reeks of the campiness from the old Adam West
series back in the 60s. I left the theater thinking all the movie
missed was the "Pop! Bang! Whack!" graphics of old. Incidentally, there
are strong but unconfirmed rumors going around that Schumacher actually
wanted these touches in the final cut, but was (fortunately) rejected
by Warner Bros.</P>
<P>    This is a pretty bad step for the Batman franchise. Next time
around, get rid of Schumacher, Silverstone, and maybe O'Donnell.
Clooney is fine as the Dark Knight, but make sure he stays true to form
as portrayed by the comics, in other words, he needs to expand his
acting abilities. Bring back the dark, gothic look of  the first Gotham
city and then maybe, there's hope that "Batman" will once again be
something worth watching.</P>
