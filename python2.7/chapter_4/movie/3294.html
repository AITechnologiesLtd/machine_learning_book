<P>     On the surface, it might seem odd to compare STRAWBERRY AND 
CHOCOLATE, Cuba's official 1995 Foreign Film Academy Award entry, with 
BOYS ON THE SIDE.  Indeed, obvious similarities are few, but scratch the 
surface a little, and it becomes apparent that both movies share a common 
strength--the complex and well-developed friendship between a gay and 
straight person.  And, as was the case with Whoopi Goldberg and Mary-
Louise Parker in BOYS, the acting is the key.  Here, Jorge Perugorria (as 
the homosexual Diego) and Vladimir Cruz (as the heterosexual David) bring 
life and vitality to a pair of personalities sketched out on paper. </P>
<P>     Diego and David are very different sorts of people--and perhaps 
that's what attracts them to each other.  Diego, a twenty-something 
writer with a passion for art, has an anti-Castro track record.  David, 
still in college and smarting from his girlfriend's rejection, studies 
political science and places the Communist way above all else.  The 
relationship between the two begins steeped in lies (Diego has made a bet 
that he can bed David; David is attempting to gather evidence proving 
Diego's counterrevolutionary leanings), but over time it grows into 
something genuine and substantial. </P>
<P>     Several tangential characters fade in and out of STRAWBERRY AND 
CHOCOLATE, occasionally intersecting the main story, but rarely having 
much impact.  Subplots featuring David's ex-girlfriend (Marilyn Solaya) 
and a deeply religious whore named Nancy (Mirta Ibarra) are neither 
especially interesting nor invigorating.  Relying on overused story 
elements, these parts of the movie present a marked contrast to the 
thoughtful, insightful depiction of Diego and David's friendship. </P>
<P>     STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE is not the first movie to examine the 
often-contradictory concepts of art and propaganda, but the balanced 
perspective presented here impregnates the issue with freshness.  One 
might not normally expect an open perspective on social and cultural 
issues to find expression in a film backed by a restrictive government, 
but STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE received not only official sanctioning, but 
financing as well. </P>
<P>     STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE is ultimately a film of many layers, and
the viewer who invests more into watching the picture will get more
out.  While the movie might superficially seem to be a comedy, it is
most effective during the quietly dramatic moments.  The obvious
fulcrum--Diego and David's relationship--is as complex and
antithetical as the film's overall tone.  Mentor and pupil, with
different ideologies, the two need more from each other than either
initially guesses at.</P>
<P>     With a different cast or a more heavy-handed director, STRAWBERRY
AND CHOCOLATE could have been a pretentious melodrama.  Filmed with
skill and precision, however, the actual result is an
engaging--although not totally engrossing--examination of the culture
and values of 1979 Cuba--issues that are surprisingly timely and
universal.  You don't have to be a resident of Havana to understand
STRAWBERRY AND CHOCOLATE's messages, or to appreciate the two
characters it serves alongside its ice cream.</P>
