<P>     There's bad buzz, and then there's the the bad buzz which surrounded
THE AVENGERS, the kind that sounds like a swarm of Africanized bees after
a particularly vigorous hive-shaking.  Disastrous test screenings, it was
said, had led to a furious round of damage control, including multiple
re-shoots of the ending, a release date bumped to the dog days of August,
and forty minutes axed from the original running time.  A gratuitous
"f-word" had even been added to bump the rating from a PG to PG-13.  Then,
all the worst fears seemed to be confirmed when Warner Bros. announced
that no advance screenings would be held for the media.  How fulsome a
stink bomb could they be hiding?</P>
<P>     You may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be
bad, but little can prepare you for something as pointless, smug and
misguided as THE AVENGERS.  Like the 1960s British television series of
the same name, it concerns a dapper secret agent named John Steed (Ralph
Fiennes) partnered by his employers at the Ministry with slinky but
dangerous Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) to protect the world from evil.
Evil in this case takes the form of Sir August DeWynter (Sean Connery), a
disgruntled former government worker who now can control the world's
weather.  Thus is is up to Steed and Peel to save the world from
meteorological extortion, whenever they have time between rounds of
calculated badinage.</P>
<P>     It is the latter which proves most instantly and consistently grating
in THE AVENGERS.  Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman spend most of their scenes
together engaging in a smirk throwing contest, each one trying to look the
most amused with him or herself, eyebrows so prominently arched you're
afraid someone might sprain something.  This despite the fact that Don
Macpherson's dialogue is a study in witlessness, tossing out embarrassing
puns as though they were saucy enough to turn Oscar Wilde green with envy.
Though they generally appear content to let their wardrobe do most of the
acting for them, Fiennes and Thurman should be commended for one
impressive demonstration of dramatic skill:  they're able to treat the
most mundane comments as though they were nuggets of pure comic gold
bestowed upon the world.</P>
<P>     That kind of quip-heavy self-awareness was certainly true of the
namesake television series as well, so what's so wrong with this variation
on the theme?  In short, both the personnel and the context.  Patrick
Macnee and Diana Rigg, the most celebrated of the series' pairings, shared
a genuine chemistry which made the romantic tension fun to watch.  Fiennes
and Thurman appear far too enamored of their own charm and cleverness to
bother connecting with one another.  They're also dropped into a summer
blockbuster milieu entirely inappropriate for light-hearted capering.
Imagine an episode of the old "Batman" series with a $70 million budget,
and you'll understand what's so wrong with THE AVENGERS.  It's hard to
endear yourself to an audience with low-tech campiness at the same time
you're blowing something up every 10 minutes, or sending huge mechanical
insects after our heroes like something out of the speeder bike chase from
RETURN OF THE JEDI.</P>
<P>     We're long past the point of pretending that plot or character has
anything to do with 1990s-model Hollywood summer fare, so I won't even
bother slapping THE AVENGERS around for exhibiting symptoms of that
particular contagious disease.  But such a film has to give you something
to latch on to:  engaging performers, effective pacing, a decent villain
to hiss.  Not even Sean Connery, blustering about without the faintest
idea why his character does anything, can pump up the charisma quotient of
this tedious car wreck of a film.  The closest recent analog to THE
AVENGERS is BATMAN AND ROBIN, but at least BATMAN AND ROBIN had its sheer
momenteum and comic-book gaudiness to salvage it.  THE AVENGERS is just
action sequences in search of a movie, actors in search of a reason to
keep smirking.  Crimes against film audiences must be avenged; the buzz of
surly patrons coming out of the theater may be even more frightening than
the buzz on the film.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 buzz stops:  0.</PRE>
