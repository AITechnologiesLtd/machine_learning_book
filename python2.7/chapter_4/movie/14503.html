<PRE>Review: Ronin</PRE>
<P>Starring: Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan
Skarsgard, Jonathan Pryce</P>
<PRE>Directed by John Frankenheimer</PRE>
<PRE>Approx 121 min</PRE>
<P>After all is said and done, as Vincent (Reno) walks up the steps of a
Paris sidestreet, he mutters to himself "No questions, no
answers. That's the business we're in. Accept it and move on." The
line fits the movie perfectly. As moviegoer, you may have
questions. It is the moviemaker's job to answer them. I had a lot of
questions in Ronin, and none were answered.</P>
<P>Ronin (meaning "masterless samurai") is a convoluted story about Sam
(De Niro) and a band of guns for hire who are asked by Irish
operatives to track and recover a mysterious metal suitcase. What is
in it? Those who know won't tell. Basically, Ronin lumbers on screen
like a large beanbag chair being kicked by a three year old. (I don't
know either, but I like it.) The audience is kept in the dark at the
begining, and remains in the dark through the end. Then the lights
come up in the theater. Ronin seems to be a 2 hour movie that was
constructed around two five minute car chases.</P>
<P>Director John Frankenheimer, a modest man, claimed that his films were
inspirational for Peter Yates's famous "Bullit" car chase and for
William Friedkin's The French Connection chase. The only thing is,
people remember those. No one will remember Frankenheimer's efforts in
Ronin. They are loud, boring chases occasionally interrupted by
gunfire.</P>
<P>In fact, the only things that will keep people from forgetting about
Ronin within the next two weeks are the performances. They are not
extrordinary, but De Niro does a fine job (has he ever been less than
good in a role?) and Reno, McElhone and Skarsgard each do a dandy
supporting turn.</P>
<P>What's more, Elia Cmiral presents a jarring score that reverberates
through the theater, occasionally preventing that dialogue from
getting through. Another contributor to the film is David Mamet. He
stepped in to help doctor the script. What I don't know is if he was
unable to do what he wanted with it, or if he feels he made a decent
screenplay out of it. One thing is for sure, and perhaps it will
answer the question, he used a psuedonym, Richard Weisz. Cant' say as
I blame him.</P>
