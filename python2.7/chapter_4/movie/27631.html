<PRE>                                PRICE OF GLORY
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp

<P>Father knows best.  Ex-boxer Arturo Ortega (Jimmy Smits, Bless the
Child) has placed his three sons on the assembly line for success,
manufacturing them into perfect fighting champions.  With his high
intensity training, they'll be given the opportunities he never had. 
When his kids grow up and each decides to pursue opportunities in and
out of the ring, the family unit starts to crumble.  Can they weather
the Price of Glory?</P>
<P>The standard repertoire of confrontation, hope, and tragedy all fall
into place.  Arturo thinks one of his boys doesn't have the makings of a
champion, but maybe he isn't looking hard enough.  Another son (Jon
Seda, Selena) wants to get married, but settling down could ruin his
shot at the big title.  Familiar archetypes emerge and follow their
routes to a traditional grand finale.</P>
<P>Price of Glory speaks from the voice of Latino experience, all too often
ignored in mainstream cinema, and an appealing cast elevates this
made-for-television material.  Jimmy Smits stands out in particular,
bringing an easy charisma and measured patience to the role of coach and
father.  The entire production is slick and well lit, if indistinct from
the glossy Hollywood look of other dramas.  The boxing seems a little
too sanitary for such a violent sport, but the actors throw themselves
into it with appropriate gusto.</P>
<P>While the intentions are good, Price of Glory is never confident enough
to push the boundaries of the sports drama mold.  Small, character
driven moments get swept up in the single-minded mechanism of plot. 
It's those seemingly minor details that separate truly great stories
from those which are merely adequate.  Price of Glory, not unlike Arturo
Ortega, barely misses its shot at the title.</P>
