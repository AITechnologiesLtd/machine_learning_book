<P>Do yourself a favor. Skip Inspector Gadget, a special-effects filled
junk heap with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and see The Iron Giant
instead. This film successfully juggles a wide-range of humor, emotions
and family fun to translate into great entertainment for kids and adults
alike.</P>
<P>Don't be turned off by Warner Bros. previous animated outings. Both
Quest for Camelot and The King and I were enormous financial and
critical flops, creating a questionable future for non-Disney animated
features. The Iron Giant, with an astonishingly mature and well-written
script, manages to defy all odds. Look past the appearance (which may
look mediocre after the visual feast of Tarzan), and you'll be delighted
to find a movie that is memorable, sweet and genial.</P>
<P>The story, although taken largely from ET, manages to succeed on
virtually all levels. It tells the story of young Hogarth (voice of Eli
Marienthal) and his discovery of an enormous metal man that crash lands
near the town of Rockwell, Maine. Hogarth knows he must keep him a
secret, especially from his mother (Jennifer Aniston) and other citizens
of Rockwell. The giant (who is given speech, perfectly, by Vin Diesel)
is originally a horrifying sight, but Hogarth comes to realize that his
newfound friend is more kind-hearted than he is threatening. One
problem: he eats metal (namely cars and tractors), and providing
adequate sustenance for him becomes a difficult task. Luckily, there is
a kindly junkyard owner (Harry Connick Jr.) nearby, and after the
initial shock he allows the giant to hide out on the premises.</P>
<P>But there is always, always someone out to do no good in a film like
this. In The Iron Giant, the antagonist is a devious slimeball named
Kent Mansely (Christopher McDonald), a government agent investigating a
mysterious lead in Rockwell. Mansely rents the extra room at Hogarth's
house, and is frequently questioning the boy about what he knows. While
his character is strictly by the books, McDonald does an extremely
commendable job as the run-of-the-mill sleazeball, bringing Mansely to
humorous life with tactical and well-spoken precision.</P>
<P>The Iron Giant teaches valuable lessons, and is surprisingly successful
at it as well. Hogarth educates the giant about death, spirit, and most
importantly: that `guns are bad.' In one of the film's very few
disappointments, some of these lessons are discarded in the finale in
favor of a military battle. Still, the film has an overwhelming heart
and a sense of good nature that shines through every scene, even if the
story occasionally relies on formula.</P>
<P>The animation in The Iron Giant is perhaps the only noticeable defect.
Certain close-up shots of important details could have been handled with
better proficiency. But, in comparison to Warner's earlier animated
work, this is an impressive step forward. Although The Iron Giant's
visual appearance may seem sub-par in comparison with Disney, it is
actually very well executed. And as for the written content, well, this
is a real nice surprise. There is effective drama and wonderful humor
that both children and their parents can enjoy. While the younger
viewers marvel at the giant's movements and overall sweetness, adults
will find themselves involved in the story and touching character
relationships. And there is, indeed, some nicely distributed laughs that
everyone will enjoy.</P>
<P>There is a lot to admire in The Iron Giant. The subject matter,
occasionally, meets and even surpasses that of Tarzan, despite the fact
that Disney has the obvious edge. This is a good, wholesome family film
that should please viewers of all ages, with one of the more appealing
alien costars ever to appear on the big screen. He may be a giant heap
of metal, but the iron giant is more human than any character you may
ever encounter.</P>
