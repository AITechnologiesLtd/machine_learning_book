<PRE>                                   DESTRY
                       A film review by Dan Navarro
                        Copyright 1996 Dan Navarro</PRE>
<P>        "Destry Rides Again" (Universal, 1939) is usually accorded 
near-mythic status in books and film commentaries.  It teamed James Stewart, 
a hot new star fresh from his triumphant "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", with 
the glamorous Marlene Dietrich in the story of a gun-hating deputy sheriff 
who succeeds in cleaning up a lawless town.  The film was so well-received, 
its title is nearly always mentioned in lists of the great films of that 
banner year, 1939.</P>
<P>        But "Destry Rides Again" is not the last word.  The film was remade 
as "Destry" fifteen years later by the same director, George Marshall, this 
time in Technicolor, with Audie Murphy in the central role of the gun-shy 
deputy.  The slick patina of the Stewart-Dietrich version, combined with the 
celebrated legend naming 1939 as Hollywood's Greatest Year, have worked to 
downgrade the 1954 "Destry" in the public's mind as an inferior remake.  It 
is nothing of the sort.  "Destry" is a near-classic Western, complete and 
satisfying in every way, and it boasts performances that in some ways eclipse 
the efforts of the 1939 cast. </P>
<P>        In the old West, a small frontier town named Restful is anything but. 
 Hooligans roam the streets freely, random gunplay erupts everywhere, and 
peaceful citizens live in fear for their lives.  The town has an overworked 
sheriff, but the real power in Restful resides with Phil Decker (Lyle 
Bettger), a corrupt saloon owner who is the equivalent of a big-city crime 
boss.  Decker and his cronies operate in league with the slimy local mayor 
(Edgar Buchanan, magnificent in a rare villainous role) and Decker's own 
dance hall girl, Brandy (Mari Blanchard, so luminous she almost gives 
corruption a good name).  </P>
<P>        When the sheriff tries to interfere in one of Decker's crooked 
schemes, Decker has the lawman casually gunned down.  Then, in an effort to 
insulate himself from further interference, Decker arranges to have the town 
drunk, Rags Barnaby (Thomas Mitchell), named the new sheriff, thinking he 
will be ineffectual.  But Rags surprises everyone by taking his new 
appointment seriously.  He goes on the wagon, then sends for Tom Destry, the 
son of a former two-fisted lawman, to be his deputy.</P>
<P>        Tom Destry (Audie Murphy) arrives in Restful, looking nothing like 
the swaggering he-man the sheriff had in mind.  In fact, Destry doesn't even 
carry a gun.  The new arrival is soft-spoken, polite and deferential, the 
antithesis of the intrepid Western hero of legend.  And Destry does let 
himself get pushed around -- by Decker, by his gunsels, even by the femme 
fatale, Brandy.  But director Marshall is just setting us up, and we know it. 
 We watch in silent glee, waiting for the inevitable moment when the worm 
will turn, and the meek will inherit the earth.  When Destry's controlled 
rage surfaces at long last, he smites the villains mightily, with a vengeance 
that out-Shanes "Shane".   </P>
<P>        Marshall's chief asset in this retelling of the Destry story is, of 
course, Audie Murphy.  In World War II, Murphy had won the Congressional 
Medal of Honor for valor in combat, as well as 23 other decorations; and yet, 
this heroic fighting tiger turned out to be diminutive and baby-faced.  
Standing no more than five feet eight, with the angelic face of a 
well-scrubbed choir boy, Murphy must have seemed a "natural" for the role of 
the reluctant gunfighter Tom Destry.  As it turned out, not only was his 
physical appearance ideal for the role; his acting style, always low-key, fit 
the Destry mold perfectly.  </P>
<P>        James Stewart was, of course, one of the finest actors ever to appear 
in American cinema, and he was eminently qualified for most of the roles he 
played.  But at well over 6 feet tall, he towered over his fellow cast 
members in "Destry Rides Again", and was by nature unable to project the 
vulnerability his role demanded.  (Perversely, the casting department gave 
the role of Destry's chief nemesis to the shorter-than-average Brian 
Donlevy.)  Stewart also had a habit of punctuating his most intense dramatic 
moments with the dark, wild-eyed visage of a deranged man.  We can see that 
look in "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), when Stewart's George Bailey is 
confronted with a nightmarish vision of the world, and in that sequence his 
expression was most appropriate.  But he uses the "crazy George Bailey look" 
four times in "Destry Rides Again", and it's unsettling, because we never 
expect to see the easy-going, nonviolent Tom Destry look that unstable.</P>
<P>        Audie Murphy's Destry is, by contrast, calm and friendly even in his 
most trying moments, as when he is forced to break up some recreational 
gunplay by local toughs.  Instead of glaring daggers at them, he smiles and 
graciously asks the men to let him borrow their guns.  Amused, they decide to 
humor the pint-sized pacifist by handing him their guns, because up until now 
they have had no reason to fear him.  All that changes, as Destry rapidly 
empties the pistols by picking off twelve tiny furniture knobs from a 
distance, in a dazzling display of marksmanship. In that instant, the lamb 
shows his fangs.  It's a defining moment in the film.  Even if you knew it 
was coming because you saw the 1939 version, it still catches you by surprise 
because this time around, Destry has seemed like such a powerless little 
pussycat.</P>
<P>        Mari Blanchard sparkles as Brandy, the amoral saloon queen.  She 
plays Brandy with a sexy exuberance, perhaps mindful that she was enjoying 
the best role of her career, after a string of small parts in B-pictures like 
"The Brigand" (1952) and "Assignment Paris" (1952).  Brandy is an intriguing 
puzzle: A bad girl who cheerfully aids and abets her lover, Decker, as he 
runs crooked poker games and fraudulent land schemes -- but who is 
nevertheless attracted to the peace-loving Destry and his basic decency.  
Blanchard also gets to sing and dance to three numbers composed for the film 
by Frederick Herbert and Arnold Hughes, although an upbeat tempo can't 
disguise the fact that one of the songs, "Bang! Bang!", is basically the same 
tune as "See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have", sans Dietrich's husky 
tremolo.</P>
<P>        "Destry"'s dramatic stability is provided by the redoubtable Thomas 
Mitchell, as the town drunk turned sheriff.  The veteran screen actor had won 
an Oscar (for "Stagecoach", 1939) and two nominations, and was clearly the 
class of the "Destry" cast.  There is hardly a moment in any of his scenes 
when he does not own the camera.  Every inflection in Mitchell's voice, every 
nuance of expression, is done with authority.  Watch him in the scene where 
Rags Barnaby is informed, upon being awakened from a drunken stupor, that he 
has been named the new sheriff.  He steadies his bloodshot eyes, firms his 
jaw, flings away the bottle he was holding, and declares, in the voice of a 
man who's trying desperately not to sound inebriated, "A man's got to choose 
between th' bottle and th' badge!"  And with head held high, he marches away 
on wobbly legs that haven't quite sobered up yet.  It's a moment of bravura 
acting by an old pro who understood what screen acting was all about.</P>
<P>        But the enduring image in "Destry" is of Audie Murphy as the quietly 
courageous man of peace who, in the end, is forced to take up arms against 
the forces of evil.  The moment when Destry finally, reluctantly, straps on 
his gunbelt and heads out the door to take care of business is one of the 
great scenes in Western films.  It is beautiful, as justice is beautiful.  
And we have been so carefully set up for this moment that we are no longer 
sophisticated observers; we are little children again, cheering in the 
knowledge that soon, all the ugliness will be wiped out, and the world will 
be a happy place again.</P>
