<PRE>BUTTERFLY
---------</PRE>
<P>1936 Spain is on the brink of a civil war that will pit fascists against
communists and Loyalists against Republicans. Little Moncho (Manuel Lozano) is
just coming of age at this critical juncture in his country's history when he
enters school for the first time. Frightened by the stories told to him by his
older brother, Andre, of the mean old teacher, Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan
Gomez), poor little Moncho wets himself at his first confrontation with the man
and runs away from school. But, Don Gregorio's patience, kindness and
understanding take hold as he opens up the wonderful world of nature to the boy
in "Butterfly."</P>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Director Jose Luis Cuerda takes on a big effort as he tries to mix a sensitive
tale of a little boy and a kindly old man with one of political intrigue in
pre-Franco Spain. At first, Moncho's story takes the lead as he and Don
Gregorio form a relationship, with the old professor teaching the boy the 
wonders of nature and life. His teachings are exemplified with the don's 
description and eventual close-up look at a butterfly's tongue - the probiscus 
the delicate creature uses to collect the nectar of life.</P>
<P>Where the latter is a sometimes melancholy, often thoughtful, look at the
cross-generational relationship, the politics depicted take on a harsher, more
sinister tone. Right from the start of the film there is an undercurrent of the
conflict between those who seek the freedom of a Spanish republic and those who
want to retain the safe haven of the monarchy. The conflict builds steadily
through the film to its final culmination - civil war. In the end, Don Gregorio
and other liberal thinkers are rejected and the power of fascism takes hold of
the country. The innocent betrayal by Moncho of the old man is both sad and
abruptly handled, wrapping the story up in an unsatisfying manner.</P>
<P>Director Cuerda is virtually unknown in the US and "Butterfly" doesn't have the
appeal or coherence to change this status. The bond between Moncho and Don
Gregorio is sweet and holds an attraction for the viewer, but the politics of
the film are too simply drawn with its "liberal is good, conservative is bad"
message.</P>
<P>If you have a desire to see a foreign language film, I recommend, instead, the
wonderful Iranian film, "The Color of Paradise." I give "Butterfly" a C.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>In the five years between the fall of the Spanish monarchy and
the Spanish Civil War, a small, shy boy, Moncho (Manuel Lozano) makes
a rocky transition to the local school which is eased when his elderly
teacher Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan Gomez, "The Grandfather") comes to
his home to 'apologize.'  Moncho becomes fast friends with the nature
loving teacher as well as other children at school who expose him to the adult
world of love.  Unfortunately, Moncho will be more than exposed to the
adult world of politics, which divides even his Republican father and
devoutly religious mother in "Butterfly."</P>
<P>"Butterfly" is perhaps most successful in capturing the feel of life in
a rural Spanish town in the 1930's, where merchants are visitted not only
for their wares, but for advice (a young farmer purchases a bottle for the
mother of country girl Carmina while complaining about her ever present
mutt Tarzan) gossip (a group of schoolchildren listen to his tale) and
more (Carmina visits Moncho's father for funeral expenses when her mother
dies).  The town's band, which practices in an old chocolate factory,
recruits Moncho's older brother Andres (Alexis de los Santos) but unbeknownst
to him, he's wanted as bait for the young ladies rather than his musical
ability.  The town's wealthiest man has two fresh capons delivered to
Don Gregorio during class so that Don Gregorio will work his son harder 
in math (the capons are returned).  Don Gregorio leads his class outdoors
to inspire them with thoughts of the marvel of a butterfly's tongue
(Butterfly's Tongue was the film's original, and better, title) and is
found by Moncho picking apples from a neighbor's tree.</P>
<P>"Butterfly" is also a coming of age story, in which Moncho gets his
first kiss (after some guidance from Don Gregorio) and Andres finds his
heart broken after a band visit to another village.  Innocence is damaged
when Carmina's drunken lover takes harsh measures against Tarzan (foreshadowing
another act of human cruelty) while the children watch hidden in bushes.</P>
<P>Spanish acting institution Fernando Fernan Gomez is the teacher everyone
wishes they'd had as Don Gregorio.  He's a complex man - older, yet
promoting liberal politics.  His unorthodox methods for keeping control
of his class are a study in human psychology.  Manual Lozano is well
utilizied as Moncho, with his face reflecting the perplexing world around
him (some of his nonactorly facial expressions are a hoot!).  Alexis de
los Santos lends an air of naive romance to older brother Andres.  Uxio
Blanco is the strong mother Rosa, whose protective maternal influence is
stronger than her husband Ramon's (Gonzalo Uriarte) idealism.</P>
<P>The film is shot lovingly, nostalgically all aglow, yet editted oddly,
with scenes feeling cut off, too abruptly ended.  The film's climatic
ending, where politics harshly divide the Galician town's inhabitants
is also jarring, which would be fine if the filmmakers had laid the
groundwork for accepting Moncho's final action - they don't and the
effect is alienating.</P>
<P>"Butterfly" has been praised for its resistance to sentimentality, yet
even given its downer of an ending, this played like a favorite of older
Foreign Language Film Academy voters , a group criticized for their
sentimentality, to me.</P>
