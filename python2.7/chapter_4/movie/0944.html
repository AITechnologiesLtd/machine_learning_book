<PRE>                                    THE DOORS
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1991 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>REVIEW: THE DOORS
Starring: Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, Kyle McLachlan, Kevin Dillon, Crispin Glover</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone's THE DOORS is the story of Jim Morrison: his rise to 
stardom, his turbulent life, and the man behind the music.  It is also
the story of the turbulent 60s, and the large role it played in
Morrison's life.  Oddly enough, it is not about the group The Doors; if
it were, it would have spent more time describing the lives of the other
group members, and not just Jim Morrison.  Nevertheless, it is an
interesting movie, and one worth checking out.  Compliments to Kilmer:
I think he "became" Morrison!</P>
<P>     Stone paints a surrealistic portrait of a man haunted by ghosts
from his past; a past of which the film tells little about, as much of
this film does with everything.  It is known that Morrison's family did
not cooperate with the makers of this film, so Stone and company are
only left to speculate about his childhood and adolescence.  So, to make
up for this lack of knowledge, the film focuses on his drug-taking and
alcoholic way of life and his overpowering obsession with death.  Oliver
Stone supplements his telling of Morrison's story with the equally
surrealistic poetry Morrison wrote while he was still alive.</P>
<P>     This film could be seen as a two-hour-and-twenty-minute music video
with nothing to offer as far as a plot, except how Jim Morrison lived
behind the scenes.  On the other hand, this film could be viewed as,
what I like to call, the 60s in a Valium capsule: take one dose and you
know everything there is to know about the 60s.  Something like a
decade immortalized in celluloid.</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone is known to make movies about things that affect him
personally.  He made PLATOON, which was based on his experiences in
Vietnam, and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, which was the story of Vietnam
Vet Ron Kovic.  The 60s must have affected him as equally as the
Vietnam War did.  This film makes you feel as though you are looking
through the mind of Jim Morrison, but you also feel as though Oliver
Stone is deliberately trying to put you there.  All the time-lapse
photography, frame superimposing, varying camera angles, and fades to
white, along with the subconscious sounds of The Doors make you make you
feel as if this is one big acid trip.  On the other hand, it makes you
feel as if you are having a vision of life in several radically
different perspectives.  This kind of filmmaking is always subject to
the personal tastes of the individual; some may find it engrossing and
innovative, and some may just wind up with a migraine headache by the end
of the movie.</P>
<P>     Perhaps a better title for this film would have been one from one
of the books about Jim Morrison, NO ONE GETS OUT OF HERE ALIVE.  Another
might have been THE MORRISON STORY, because this film is not really
about The Doors as much about Morrison himself.  Although Morrison is
the center of this story, Oliver Stone presents the setting of the 60s
to be a potent competitor for the title role.  Was he making a movie
about Jim Morrison, The Doors, or the 60s?  That's a question you will
have to figure out for yourself.</P>
<P>     I personally found THE DOORS to be somewhat entertaining.  It
provides some insight into why Jim Morrison was the way he was, and how
the turbulent 60s played a deciding role in his life.  It's not so much
the story that people may disagree over (after all, there's not that
much story *to* disagree about), but the way it is told.  This film is
what I consider to be true escapist entertainment.  It places you in a
different setting, a different place, and a different time.  If that's
what you crave in movie, THE DOORS is a good vehicle for consideration.
Go see it; it's worth at least a matinee.</P>
