<PRE>                            BASIC INSTINCT
                    A review in the public domain
                            by The Phantom
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     (As we are currently suffering from a serious horror drought, the
Phantom thought he would take this opportunity to branch out into the
world of the exploitation film and make the big-budget soft-core BASIC
INSTINCT the subject of his first review.  The Phantom feels that
reviewing exploitation films is well within his artistic reach, even
though the two genres are so markedly different.  In a horror film, we
watch as first someone is murdered, then someone else disrobes, then
someone else is murdered, etc.  In an exploitation film, on the other
hand, we watch as first someone disrobes, then someone is murdered, then
someone else disrobes, etc.  The Phantom will, of course, endeavor to
keep that subtle distinction in mind as he writes his reviews, and if at
any time he feels himself not well enough qualified to critically
appraise the myriad nuances of the exploitation genre, he will return to
the familiar world of the horror film without hesitation.)</P>
<P>     The Phantom needed little more inducement to lay down his $7.50 for
Paul Verhoeven's latest film than that which was provided by the
high-concept plot summary: cynical, burnt-out cop becomes mysteriously
(and dangerously, if we may be so bold) attracted to beautiful, rich,
naked bisexual woman who does/does not kill people with an ice pick.</P>
<P>     Any six words in that sentence would be enough to part the Phantom
from his hard-earned money; but the tantalizing thought that a film
might contain all thirty was enough to transport him to exploitation
film heaven.  After all, even if only a handful of those words were
fully exploited by the film, BASIC INSTINCT would still be quite a
slam-bang, action-packed, sex- and violence-drenched exercise in
voyeurism with little or no obvious redeeming social value -- the very
definition of a successful and wildly entertaining exploitation film.</P>
<P>     Add to the mix Paul Verhoeven's reputation as a director for whom
the ordinary limits of taste and restraint have little or no meaning --
and Sharon Stone's reputation for being, well, rather easy on the eyes
without any clothes on -- and the Phantom's expectations were high
indeed as he ventured uptown to see BASIC INSTINCT in THX sound (the
idea being that THX sound would show off Jerry Goldsmith's score to best
advantage, or at least make it loud enough to drown out the sounds of
the Lexington Avenue line as it rumbled underneath the theater; when one
lives in New York, loudness and quality frequently go hand in hand).  </P>
<P>     But somewhere between the idea and the execution, something went a
little wrong.  Perhaps Joe Eszterhas delivered only a rough outline for
his $3 million story; perhaps coherent endings -- like batteries for
cheap toys -- are not included for such a paltry sum of money.  (Aside
to Tri-Star: assuming you're not yet in bankruptcy and you need an
ending for your next exploitation film, the Phantom is ready and willing
to provide one -- one that even makes sense -- for the low, low price of
only $9,999.95.  Have your people call my people and we'll do lunch.)</P>
<P>     Whatever the reason, though, BASIC INSTINCT's biggest problem is
its script.  Even before the film limps to its shockingly shoddy
conclusion, signs that trouble is on the way appear to us with the
passing of nearly every scene.  Eszterhas has the characters doing any
one of three things at each point in the film: getting into a car;
driving in a car; getting out of a car; walking up to a doorway;
knocking on a door; walking through a doorway; walking into a room;
walking out of a room.  And having sex, of course.  Sometimes characters
do more than one of these things in a single scene; sometimes characters
do more than one of these things at a time.  But quite a lot of BASIC
INSTINCT is given over to these nine activities, and after about a half
hour, the audience begins to realize that something is missing.  Real
life, for a start.  At no point in BASIC INSTINCT do we ever feel that
the characters exist in the real world; Eszterhas has effectively
created a very closed, claustrophobic and artificial world for a film
that can only be effective when we see the effects of the story line on
the characters' "external" lives.  One of the reasons FATAL ATTRACTION
was so successful is that we were able to see Michael Douglas' character
as a real person -- someone with whom we might possibly identify or at
least sympathize -- and not as just one more cardboard character being
stalked by a Jasonized killer.  Consider, too, Jimmy Stewart in VERTIGO,
a film that encompasses the very definition of an improbable and
artificial plot.  Yet watching it, we never get the sense that Stewart
is simply going through the motions; instead, we feel that he's a real
person who gets caught up in extraordinary events -- a hallmark of
Hitchcock's greatest work, and the bare minimum needed for successful
and effective suspense.</P>
<P>     After the script, BASIC INSTINCT suffers from another common
problem: that of a talented director of niche films directing something
well beyond his range as a director.  Verhoeven is one of the best when
it comes to violent, action-packed techno-thrillers like ROBOCOP and
TOTAL RECALL; however, putting aside the few killings that Eszterhas'
script calls for, the bulk of BASIC INSTINCT is given over to the
relationship between Douglas and Stone.  It is a plot tailor-made for
Brian DePalma (and in a better and more refined time, for Alfred
Hitchcock), who proved he could handle just this sort of story in BODY
DOUBLE.  Verhoeven even pulls a DePalma when he lifts the steamy kissing
sequence from NOTORIOUS; alas, it's one of the few scenes in which
Douglas and Stone generate any real heat.  Of course, they're seen naked
in and out of bed, together and apart so many times that it becomes
almost boring; yet this only proves that athletic sex is not an adequate
substitute for genuine interest, even though we as an audience have our
eyes glued to the screen all the while.  Verhoeven, whatever his
talents, has yet to learn that graphic violence is usually a poor
substitute for genuine horror; and that soft-core pornography is almost
always a poor substitute for genuine passion.  Apparently Verhoeven
operated on the principle that if it wasn't possible to show a car chase
or a murder, the story would be advanced best by having either Douglas
or Stone disrobe; while this seems like a reasonable idea at the
beginning of the film, by about mid-way through even the sight of
Douglas' naked rear-end -- featured prominently in a scene that was
apparently designed as a showcase for his derriere -- fails to lift our
spirits or hold our interest.</P>
<P>     It is because we never believe that Douglas is deeply and
emotionally involved with Stone that BASIC INSTINCT begins to fall
apart; without our emotional commitment, what difference does it make
whether or not Stone is the killer?  Thus all of the artificial plot
twists and turns come to naught, and by the time the credits roll we
feel that perhaps some vital part of the film had been cut.  Contrast
this with the denouement of VERTIGO: by the time Hitchcock ends his
classic film, we've strongly identified with Jimmy Stewart and thus we
can share his pain and bewilderment; in other words, we can have a
genuine emotional experience.  BASIC INSTINCT is a cheat, because all we
get to do is watch.</P>
<P>     Sadly, even Jerry Goldsmith doesn't come through for us in his
usual exemplary fashion.  His score attempts to place BASIC INSTINCT
squarely in Hitchcock's world, but try as it does, it never quite fits
with the action on screen.  Perhaps this is because Verhoeven is unable
to generate any sustained suspense; perhaps it is because the audience
is relegated to the role of voyeur rather than partner as the film
unfolds.  In any case, Goldsmith's score tends to pounce on us at
unlikely times and attempt to coerce us into feeling anxious.  Half the
time -- and even as Eszterhas has his characters knocking on doors or
walking around outside houses -- Goldsmith's score keeps swelling up in
the background, itself growing somewhat tiresome and repetitious as it
pounds away at inert scene after inert scene.  The other half of the
time, we're all too busy waiting for Douglas and Stone to take their
clothes off to notice whether Goldsmith is still hammering away with his
quasi-Hitchcockian score or whether he's switched to a test of the
Emergency Broadcast System.</P>
<P>     This said, the Phantom should hasten to add that BASIC INSTINCT is
by no means a terrible film -- it's just not a very good one.  DePalma
could get away with his incessant references to and liberal borrowings
from Hitchcock because his films stood on their own merits, and because
he was able to take plot snippets and ideas with which we were all
familiar and give them his own special gloss (that being straight-razor
murders and Melanie Griffith in her underwear).  Whatever their faults,
DRESSED TO KILL and BODY DOUBLE are stylish, entertaining and fun --
each the very definition of a successful exploitation film.  (Leonard
Maltin disdains BODY DOUBLE and calls it "another sleazy fetish film,"
which only goes to show that he wouldn't know a good exploitation film
if it stabbed him with an ice pick.  Coincidentally, the Phantom has
himself used the phrase when describing a film, but only when his
phrase-O-matic is set to "high praise"; after all, if we don't all want
to go see "another sleazy fetish film," what do we want to see?)</P>
<P>     And BASIC INSTINCT does have its pluses: the two biggest being
Sharon Stone and Sharon Stone without any clothes on.  Both she and
Douglas both do as well as can be expected, given the unlikely plot,
near-illiterate script and given that they're forced to spend much of
their screen time "****ing like minks", to use three charming words we
get to hear on at least a half dozen occasions.  (One of these scenes
later is described by Douglas as "the **** of the century", which gives
you a pretty fair indication of the level of Mr. Eszterhas' script.)
There is also the now-infamous "interrogation scene," which features
Ms. Stone's legs and other parts of her anatomy.  This scene is wildly
over-directed by Verhoeven, whose ever-so-subtle touch has the actors
frantically pantomiming embarrassment as Ms. Stone makes herself more
comfortable; if this were the 1920s and had not the miracle of sound
recording become part of our lives 60 years ago, the interrogation scene
would likely be more believable than it is.  (It *was* affecting,
however, in its own overwrought way.)</P>
<P>     The film's resolution is a disappointment to all, and in fact is so
bad that the Phantom wonders who -- other than Mr. Eszterhas -- could
possibly have liked it or thought it an appropriate way to end a
suspense thriller.  It is only a small consolation that by the time we
reach the film's final scene, we have long since ceased to care what
happens to Douglas and Stone or even who the killer really is.  In
writing BASIC INSTINCT, Eszterhas has mistaken Hitchcock's famous
"MacGuffin" for the film's central theme; instead of concentrating on
the characters and using the murders as a convenient way for them to
become further involved -- emotionally involved -- with each other,
Eszterhas' script spins its wheels as clue after pointless clue is
revealed to an audience that longs not for MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS,
but REAR WINDOW.</P>
<P>     Speaking of which, Hitchcock's classic films are, as always,
readily available at your local Blockbusters; phans who don't plan on
(ice) picking BASIC INSTINCT for their weekend's entertainment would be
well advised to rent any of the (much better) films from which Eszterhas
and Verhoeven have liberally borrowed.  And if the Phantom's memory
serves, three minutes of Grace Kelly or Kim Novak fully clothed are more
likely to capture our interest and attention than 30 minutes of Sharon
Stone proving that she doesn't wear any underwear.  At the very least,
you won't have to look at Jimmy Stewart's naked rear-end, which is
practically reason enough to rent one or more of these classic films and
avoid BASIC INSTINCT.</P>
