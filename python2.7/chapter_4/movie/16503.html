<P>     Cinderella ain't what she used to be...and at the same time, she's
exactly what she's always been.  Like no other fairy tale set-up, it sets
a modern sensibility to itching -- how does one respond to the idea that a
woman must be physically transformed to be worthy of love?  This male
chauvinist Pygmalion has taken many forms over the years, from MY FAIR
LADY to PRETTY WOMAN, but SHE'S ALL THAT may have found the perfect
setting:  high school.  If there's anywhere you can sell the idea that
_everyone_ believes they must be physically transformed to be worthy of
love, this would be the place.</P>
<P>     So much for the sociological context -- SHE'S ALL THAT stinks like
last month's cheese left on a particularly sunny windowsill.  Freddie
Prinze Jr. stars as Zack Siler, senior class president, soccer star and
all-around golden boy at Southern California's Harrison High.  On the
first day back from spring break, Zack is dumped by long-time girlfriend
Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) when she hooks up with a former "Real World"
cast member (Matthew Lillard).  The humiliated Zack claims he can turn any
girl in school into a prom queen, a boast that turns into a bet when
Zack's buddy Dean (Paul Walker) chooses gloomy art geek Laney Boggs
(Rachael Leigh Cook) as the subject of the experiment.  And thus the
eight-week countdown clock to personal growth and true love begins.</P>
<P>     I'm sure that all parties involved in SHE'S ALL THAT thought they
really were telling a Cinderella story, particularly director Robert
Iscove, who helmed the popular TV-movie version with Brandy a couple years
back.  This, of course, is one of those Cinderella stories where the poor
little girl is really a supermodel whose paint-spattered overalls hide a
slinky va-va-voom waiting to emerge.  Rachael Leigh Cook wears her
horn-rims like someone trying desperately not to appear beautiful despite
her porcelain features, somewhat dampening that willing suspension of
disbelief.  There's little if any chemistry between Prinze and Cook, no
development of what would make their mutual attraction grow...in short,
nothing that would appeal to a viewer not of the same age as the
protagonists.</P>
<P>     Essentially, however, SHE'S ALL THAT isn't remotely interested in
appealing to anyone outside that audience, because it's really a teen
fantasy.  For girls, it offers the prospect that, even if you're a social
pariah now, you too can turn into a popular beauty with the right haircut
and a sympathetic stud by your side; for boys, it suggests that anyone is
a hottie waiting to happen if you point her in the right direction.
There's even assurance for the academically brilliant (Zack faces the
dilemma of choosing between seven Ivy League schools) that your life is
complicated, too.  And in between, it derives belly laughs from people
eating pizza sprinkled with pubic hair.  It's humorless and derivative,
but it _understands_ you, fellow high school student.  Like John Hughes
crossed with Bill Clinton, SHE'S ALL THAT feels your adolescent pain.</P>
<P>     Thank heaven for Matthew Lillard, who invests his spin on "Real
World's" Puck with enough egotistical energy to rouse SHE'S ALL THAT from
its stupor periodically.  His scenes, including a manic look-at-me dance
at a party, are about the only aspect of the film not pasted together from
every other teen angst-comedy you've ever seen.  This one compounds its
tedium with a near-suffocating boredom, as Iscove can't even generate
energy to drive its familiar narrative forward.  SHE'S ALL THAT just
meanders sweetly towards its inevitable conclusion, telling its viewers
exactly what they want to hear:  that someday their prince will come, and
all it will take to get him is a sausage-casing red dress.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Cinder-ailments:  3.</PRE>
