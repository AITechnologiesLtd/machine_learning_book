<PRE>_Any_Given_Sunday_ (R) ***</PRE>
<PRE>_Play_It_to_the_Bone_ (R) * 1/2</PRE>
<P>_Any_Given_Sunday_ is a guy's film.  And I say that not because it's a
football film (though that does play a major part) but because it's an
_Oliver_Stone_ football film--a fact that gives one an idea of how
testosterone-happy this gridiron saga is.
But let this be said: I enjoyed this film.  Maybe it's the testosterone
running through my own veins, but it's hard not to get adrenalized by the
bonecrunching football action Stone stages with maximum intensity.  He has
been criticized with being a bit too busy with the camera, shooting it so
close and cutting so quickly that often the exact plays are unclear.  That
complaint is understandable, but Stone's approach brings the audience into
the game like no other film, giving viewers perhaps the closest cinematic
approximation of the chaotic experience on the field.</P>
<P>While there is plenty of football sequences in the film, there is a reason
why this film clocks in at close to three hours, and that is the
plot--which, quite simply, there is too much of.  Stone, along with writing
collaborator John Logan, want to give an exhaustive look at just about every
aspect of professional football.  In addition to the usual win/loss
issue--which, as the film opens, is gradually falling less in favor of the
Miami Sharks' longtime coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino)--there's the matter of
the up-and-coming hotshot quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx), who is
called on to replace reliable veteran Cap (Dennis Quaid) who is sidelined
with an injury.  That indirectly links to the issue of rushing injured
players' rehabiliation, which the team orthopedist (James Woods) has no
qualms about but his intern (Matthew Modine) does.  Willie's showboating and
penchant for calling his own plays puts him at odds with his teammates
(including one, played by LL Cool J, with an eye to up his own endorsement
stock) and especially Tony, who, in turn, has an even more heated battle of
wills going on with Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), the Sharks'
ballbusting owner.</P>
<P>There are even other, smaller concerns on Stone's mind, but those cannot
help but get lost in the shadow of the Tony-Willie and Tony-Christina
conflicts.  Granted, these threads are given the bulk of the screen time,
but even if they did not, the forceful performances would have demanded
attention.  That comment is hardly surprising in the context of acting
reliables such as Diaz--who, in five short years, has carved out quite an
impressively eclectic career for herself--and Pacino, but the real
revelation is Foxx, best known for his television comedy work. 
Surprisingly, the comic material he's called on to do doesn't work (though
that's the fault of the script, which saddles him with a silly running gag
where he vomits on the field during every game), but he impresses everywhere
else.  Not only does the convince on the athletic end of his duties, he also
holds his own against Pacino in one particularly memorable verbal
confrontation.  (One can only be glad that the role's original portrayer,
rap impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs, had to back out before filming began.)</P>
<P>Most of the actresses in _Any_Given_Sunday_ do nothing here that would
tarnish their reputations, but one cannot help but notice the glaring
negativity of the female characters in the film.  Christina is a strong,
independent woman; but not only is she a bitch, but she's portrayed as being
in over her head in such a male-driven business.  Christina's mother
(Ann-Margret) is in an alcoholic daze for the entire film.  In one scene,
Cap's seemingly supportive wife (Lauren Holly) is revealed to have a dark
side--only to have that trait magically disappear for the rest of the film,
making her character turn that much more arbitrary.  Tony sometimes enlists
the services of a whore, who is played, appropriately enough, by _Showgirls_
slut Elizabeth Berkley.  The one female character that appears to have some
virtue is Willie's long-suffering girlfriend (Lela Rochon), but even her
steely backbone is softened toward film's end.</P>
<P>But as I said, this is a "guy" picture (and how, given all the bare manhoods
on display in the locker room scenes), and the target audience won't care
once they get a taste of the stunningly staged action and Stone's trademark
way of juicing up the visuals of even the most pedestrian scenes.  Though
it's being released in the thick of awards season and bears a number of
Oscar winners on its team, _Any_Given_Sunday_ is essentially a pure
entertainment vehicle, and taken at that level, it works.</P>
<P>The boxing comedy _Play_It_to_the_Bone_ aims to be a pure entertainment
vehicle, and for one thirty-minute stretch, it succeeds.  The advertising
campaign touts a big match between stars Woody Harrelson and Antonio
Banderas, and in no way does the film disappoint in that area.  Theirs is
one helluva fight, expertly staged, edited, and containing more action than
perhaps all the pay-per-view boxing events held in the last five years
combined.</P>
<P>It is in every other area that this film disappoints--a fact that is made
especially more disheartening considering the writer-director at the helm is
none other than Ron Shelton, Hollywood's premier cinematic examiner of
sports, as seen in films such as _White_Men_Can't_Jump_ and _Bull_Durham_. 
Instead of a sharp satire of a subject ripe for parody--professional
boxing--we get a tedious, unfunny road movie.  Harrelson and Banderas
respectively play Vince Boudreau and Cesar Dominguez, best friends and
has-been middleweight pugilists who are given one final shot at glory when
they're tapped at the last minute to plug a hole in the undercard of a Mike
Tyson bout.  The promoter, sleazy Joe Domino (Tom Sizemore), doesn't throw
in L.A.-to-Vegas plane fare as part of the deal, so Vince and Cesar, along
with Cesar's current (and Vince's former) girlfriend Grace (Lolita
Davidovich), take to the open road.</P>
<P>This trip, which makes up most of the movie, is as long and dry as the miles
of desert the three pass through.  Along the way, Vince and Cesar recount
their past traumas in the ring, the ones that consigned them to obscurity. 
And there are a number of jokes, none of which are particularly funny (Cesar
experimented with homosexuality after his big loss--ha ha ha).  One's hopes
are perked up with the entrance of _Ally_McBeal_ siren Lucy Liu, who plays
drug- and sex-mad Lia, who joins the trio's journey midway.  Alas, not even
she can redeem a poorly-conceived part whose only apparent purpose is to
serve as an excuse to feature a gratuitous sex scene.</P>
<P>Upon arrival in Sin City, _Play_It_to_the_Bone_ jolts the audience awake
with its bravura centerpiece boxing match.  There is never any doubt as to
how this match will end--it's really obvious by the film's design.  That the
bout is still exciting and even nailbiting at times is further proof that
Shelton is a master at cinematic recreations of sports.  The celebrity
cameos in the audience and the presence of the HBO Sports announcing team of
Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, and George Foreman add immeasurably to the
fight's authenticity.</P>
<P>Frankly, I probably wouldn't have minded _Play_It_to_the_Bone_ as much as I
did if it _hadn't_ featured such a terrific sequence.  A completely bad
movie is not a pleasure to sit through, but at least it doesn't come with
the strong sense of frustration that comes with a film that has one great
scene--especially one that shows the potential the whole project had.  But
once the fight is over, it's back down to earth and below with the
uninteresting characters and their uninteresting personal issues, which,
sadly, is the focus of the film.  What it all comes down to is that
_Play_It_to_the_Bone_ is a boxing movie that is not only _not_ about
boxing--it's about absolutely nothing of value at all.</P>
