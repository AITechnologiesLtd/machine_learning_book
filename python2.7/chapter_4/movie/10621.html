<PRE>'The Sweet Hereafter'</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Director Atom Egoyan has made not only his finest film but his most
important statement yet with 'The Sweet Hereafter'.  Also written for
the screen by Egoyan, based on the novel by Russell Banks, the film is a
grim tale of a small Canadian town struggling to get on with their
emotional lives after a bus accident in the town kills a group of
children.  This immense tragedy, told out of sequence, is told without
the trappings of the usual Hollywood standard, using no heroic
characters to bring justice to an injustice, using no courtroom scenes
with all their pretentious speech making and most importantly the film
moves in a dreamlike manner to echo the depressing manner of a
nightmare.</P>
<P>Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), is a lawyer who is not out to be a heroic
star like he might be in a big Hollywood studio production.  He is an
honest and somewhat humble individual who makes contact with the
families of the deceased youngsters in the hopes of bringing a class
action suit against someone involved with the bus company.  Through a
calculated series of visits he begins to slowly turn the grief of the
families into a more intense anger than they're already feeling and I'm
sure his motives are all for the best because he is convinced there is
more to the incident than just a simple accident.  Stephens is facing
alienation from his own daughter as she eludes him to pursue a life of
depravity by becoming a drug addict, traveling with derelicts and
eventually testing positive for the AIDS virus.  Through several
telephone contacts he has with her in the film, the audience is drawn to
feel as if they aren't father and daughter at all although the film
makes it clear that they are through a brief series of flashbacks
involving Holm's care for his child when she was an infant.</P>
<P>More powerful than anything in the film is the intense bonding we see
between some of the parents and their children and the eventual
separation they encounter through death. Another character, Nicole
(Sarah Polley) is older than the other children who died and is confined
to a wheelchair, paralyzed from the waist down after the wreck.  Her
hopes of becoming a rock star are quickly dashed by her predicament and
she is instrumental in the film's outcome as her deposition given to the
case may decide things.  Her character is the most sympathetic and is
the best supporting performance in the film.  As for Ian Holm, I was
overwhelmed by his performance as the lawyer who wants to reach out and
also be a friend to the families.  Just one look at him tells you his
underlining concern is not profit but concern.  The performances of both
Holm and Polley are well worth Oscar nominations as is Egoyan's
direction and the film itself is a worthy contender for Best Picture..</P>
<P>The most impressive thing about Egoyan's direction of the film is the
way each family involved in the tragedy is interviewed and confronted by
Stephens.  The individual frustration each one of them feels and in the
case of the bus driver, guilt, is a testament to Egoyan's ability to
make a real story work by making each character as important as any
other.  This is as real a film as you'll ever see with the most searing
dramatic overtones you're ever likely to encounter in the movies.</P>
