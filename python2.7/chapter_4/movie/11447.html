<P>   Ask schoolchildren today for the name of America and
England's great enemy in World War II and you'd likely as
notg get the answer, "Russia."  There was a time not so long
ago that every schoolkid knew the correct reply, and for a
select few who want to delve more deeply into a sidelights of
the era, some more details on the conflict is welcome.  In his
film "The Land Girls," David Leland provides fascinating
coverage of a little-known facet of the struggle in his Rosie-
the-Riveter sort of movie of British women who volunteered
for farm work in order to free young, male tillers for the front--
and incidentally, to afford a new kind of freedom for the
workers.  The women, not themselves eligible to go into
actual combat, provided a much needed service whether as
volunteers or draftees, squeezing cow udders and turning
over the soil so that the brave soldiers and the folks back
home could be nourished with their accustomed staples.</P>
<P>   While only a documentary would try to focus on the
actual work on the granges of the brave island nation, Leland
correctly underscores romantic motifs in his involving work
which, while not being a spitfire action adventure by any
stretch, provides insight into a now-forgotten drama which
unfolded during the war years.</P>
<P>   While moviegoers will be reminded of Bruce Beresford's
"Paradise Road," a tale of women in Japanese POW camps,
Leland's film avoids a kaleidoscopic view by concentrating on
just three women of different temperaments to show how their
experience changed them forever.  Convincingly acted by
Catherine McCormack as the romantic Stella, Rachel Weisz
as the more cerebral and innocent companion Ag, and Anna
Friel as the working-class, talkative Prue, "The Land Girls"
traces their years on the farm with its aging owner Mr.
Lawrence (Tom Georgeson), his wife (Maureen O'Brien) and
their handsome son Joe (Steven Mackintosh).  As if to prove
that separation from their beaus can turn women as well as
men into flirts, Leland hones in on the appeal which young
Joe has for the three recruits.  Steven Mackintosh, known to
lovers of indie movies for his recent role as a transsexual in
"Different for Girls," here looks more like a young Peter
O'Toole than like Richard Spence's elegant woman, and we
quickly accept the fact that this rugged individual, the only
eligible male in the vicinity, will soon wind up bedding all three
working visitors.</P>
<P>   A sentimental rather than edgy film, "Land Girls" exhibits
the friendship which develops among the three women who
are surprisingly without jealousy despite their competition for
the young man's attentions.  Despite her engagement to a
naval officer and a college graduate, Stella falls in love with
the relatively uneducated Joe, who resents his role on the
farm and seeks to enter the air force despite a genetic heart
condition.  In another episode displaying a liaison which takes
place across the lines of social class, Ag, a graduate of
Cambridge University, loses her virginity to Joe after brazenly
but naively asking him, "Will you do me?"  </P>
<P>    Photographed by Henry Braham in Western England, the
film possesses lush production values, using Caroline Amies's
period design including a 1940's locomotive which frames the
story and some rattling old autos reminiscent of the era. 
Because there is so little drama of the action-adventure sort,
an incident involving the downing of a German plane which
crashes into the Lawrence acreage is particularly agitating,
dramatizing the love which Joe has grown to feel for Stella
and also the compassion which the farmers have for the
aircraft's hapless pilot.</P>
<P>   Keith Dewhurst and David Leland's screenplay provides for
a quiet film which will be appreciated by fans of Masterpiece
Theater, though the dialogue is quite accessible and the story
an earthy one.  It is acted with dignity and humor all-around,
a bittersweet tale of a conservative public's acceptance of
anomaly during a period of emergency. Not Rated.  Running
Time: 110 minutes.  (C) 1998 Harvey Karten</P>
