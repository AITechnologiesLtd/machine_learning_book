<PRE>                                TRUE LIES
                       A film review by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1994 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     TRUE LIES owes as much, if not more, to James Bond films as it
does to pure action films such as COMMANDO.  Director James Cameron and
star Arnold Schwarzennegger are each confident and at the top of their
form as they over-deliver the goods in a deft cross between a 007
adventure and an action comedy.  Its not a stretch to say that they
have created a Bond for the 90's, and Pierce Brosnan better pray that
this movie is well forgotten before his attempt at Bond hits the
screen.</P>
<P>     Speaking of praying, Tom Arnold should be spending a good part of
each day genuflecting in the direction of James Cameron's house,
thanking him for saving his career.  One of the most pleasant surprises
in a movie full of them was that Arnold (Tom, that is) was able to play
an engaging character who you really wanted to like for his wit and his
puppy-dog loyalty almost enough to make you overlook his neanderthal
attitudes toward women.  I actually enjoyed the time he spent on the
screen.</P>
<P>     TRUE LIES has at its heart a terrific premise.  What if James Bond
had a house in the suburbs, and his wife and daughter had no idea what
he really did for a living? Suppose further that he were to learn that
his wife was being wooed by a spook wannabe who hoped to score by
providing the sense of adventure missing from her dull life? Its hard
to save the world and still be home in time for dinner.</P>
<P>     Seated behind us at the sneak preview were a couple of guys who
had this exchange during the credits:</P>
<PRE>        "Do you think it was too violent?"</PRE>
<PRE>        "Hey, man.  This is a *love* story."</PRE>
<P>     Facetious as it sounds, beneath all of the sound and fury, Cameron
does manage to deliver a love story between Arnold (Schwarzennegger,
that is) and Jamie Lee.  At first infuriated by her affair, he becomes
obsessed, then cruel, and then she puts him in his place.  Meanwhile
there is some great business between Arnold and the fake spy, Bill
Paxton.  Paxton is so deliciously slimy that you almost wish he had
more screen time.</P>
<P>     But screen time is not wasted in TRUE LIES.  This is skilled, deft
filmmaking.  There aren't scenes that don't need to be there, and many
scenes do double duty.  Single-minded focus comes into play only in the
well-crafted and thrilling action sequences.  And there are plenty of
them, ranging from the category of stunts I call "Things I've always
wanted to do" to set pieces which escalate in unexpected directions in
the "take it farther" school of comedy.  During the climactic sequence
at the end of the movie I started to wonder why my jaw was sore.  Then
I realized that I had been clenching my teeth for the past several
minutes.</P>
<P>     TRUE LIES is audacious, tight, and--most of all--great fun.  Like
any Cameron film, it is also big and loud, so treat yourself and catch
it at the best theatre you can.</P>
