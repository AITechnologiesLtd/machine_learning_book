A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Ivan Reitman</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Michael Browning</PRE>
<P>Starring: Harrison Ford, Harrison Ford, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline
Obradors</P>
<P>Ingredients: Boyish old island rascal, young female magazine exec, true
love</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this romantic comedy, a spunky, career-oriented gal named Robin (Anne
Heche) and her nerdy boyfriend Frank (David Schwimmer), decide to take a
vacation to a remote tropical island in French Polynesia. Harrison Ford
plays Quinn, a divorced exec who has gotten rid of his business and now
lives a simple life as an island bush pilot. </P>
<P>When a business emergency requires that Robin fly off the island, she
hires Quinn, but the two get stranded alone on a deserted island when
their plane is damaged in flight. To make matters worse, they are
attacked by pirates. On the bright side, they are falling in love. </P>
<P>Can a 56-year-old islander and a 28-year-old yuppie get along, much less
fall in love?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Usually in the summer, we expect to see a Harrison Ford adventure movie.
But SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS is not an adventure movie; it's a fluffy,
lighthearted, romantic comedy reminiscent of camping. </P>
<P>Imagine the kind of situations you'd put in a comedy involving two
people on a funny camping trip: running around lost with maps in hand;
equipment that doesn't work; bad luck weather; a situation involving a
snake; grass skirts from GILLIGAN'S ISLAND; falling from great heights
and plopping down safely in water. It's all there in SIX DAYS, SEVEN
NIGHTS. The movie even throws in a lost World War II plane. While not
meant to be realistic or even remotely original, it's all an excuse to
show how a man and a woman might quibble and argue their way into
falling in love. </P>
<P>So the only important question is, do Harrison Ford and Anne Heche have
the chemistry for it? He's country; she's city. He's island; she's
mainland. He's laid back; she's a go getter. He's 56; she's 28. Do
opposites attract? In the movies they do. Ford and Heche deliver.</P>
