<P>ALIEN RESURRECTION
(Twentieth-Century Fox)
Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet
 Chances are good that many of the moviegoers who'll be stand in line for
"Alien Resurrection" this weekend weren't even born when the original
"Alien" debuted in the summer of 1979, introducing the world to Ripley, one
of the most dynamic --and determined-- heroines ever to appear in
science-fiction. Eighteen years later, she's still being played by Sigourney
Weaver, and the most intriguing aspect of "Resurrection" is the way Josh
Wheadon's screenplay allows Weaver the opportunity to overhaul Ripley
somewhat. After all, when we last saw her, she was plunging to her death to
avoid giving birth to a new Alien queen; by the time, "Resurrection" opens,
approximately 200 years later, scientists have successfully cloned Ripley
(after seven botched tries) from DNA samples.
 But their motives are hardly humanitarian. Indeed, when we first see
Ripley, she's in the process of undergoing a kind of Caesarian section,
having the unborn baby queen removed from her chest. From this specimen,
General Perez (Dan Hedaya) spectulates, science can learn about all facets
of the alien and possibly even find a way in which to tame them (!). "As far
as I'm concerned, Number Eight is a meat by-product," says Perez of Ripley,
who, in this new incarnation, is stronger and stranger than ever before. Her
senses are alarmingly acute, and though she looks human, her blood now
sizzles when it's spilled.
 After Perez's ship is visited by the crew of a freighter called The Betty,
"Alien Resurrection" takes a more familiar turn, as the alien specimens
escape and run amok, decimating the human population. Call (Winona Ryder),
the least off-putting of The Betty team, realizes that everyone needs
Ripley's help to survive, but at the same time, Call isn't sure this genetic
superwoman is really trustworthy: After all, who knows how human she really
is?
 Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (best-known for the cult fave "The City of Lost
Children") manages a stylish mix of arresting imagery and largely non-stop
action. In one of the film's best shots, Jeunet's camera swoops into the
mouth of a screaming man and travels down his throat and into his chest to
reveal the gaping jaws of the alien fetus inside of him, and Internet
addicts will enjoy Jeunet's visualization of the future of computer
interfacing, which looks like a cross between religion and heroin use.
Jeunet and Wheadon also handle the story's quieter moments with equal
finesse: the eerie encounter between Ripley and her failed "forerunners" is
one of the finest, most chilling sequences in any of the "Alien" films.
 Weaver, perhaps inspired by the new kinks in Ripley's character, seems much
livelier and more vigorous than she did in the so-so "Alien 3," and there
are flashes of surprising humor in her exchanges with Call, who Ryder
underplays effectively. Michael Wincott and Ron Perlman contribute the
requisite grit as Call's uncouth co-workers and Brad Dourif's nutty take on
the chief scientist is quite amusing.
 Though "Alien Resurrection" can't entirely sidestep the feeling of deja vu
that hangs over most sequels, and ultimately wraps up with a climax that's
less exciting than most of the rest of the picture, it's a perfectly
respectable sequel, crafted with a certain degree of imagination and
produced with some of the finest special-effects money can buy. If it
doesn't have the novelty value of the original or the relentless suspense of
James Cameron's "Aliens" (1986), "Resurrection" is still a swift, rewarding
shocker in its own right. James Sanford</P>
