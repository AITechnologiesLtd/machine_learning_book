<P>   There must be hundreds of movies that have dealt in some
way with the theme of Nazism, and they're still coming out of
the Hollywood mills and the cameras of the independent
studios as well.  That's OK.  There will always be a need for
more stories of Germany's flight into irrationality, particularly
those which carve out a niche, which study some aspect of
the period which has rarely been exposed to the public.  The
best example this year of such a feat is Roberto Benigni's
"Life is Beautiful," which deals with the efforts of a prisoner to
use humor to conceal the brutality of a concentration camp
from his young, incarcerated son.  Similarly, Volker
Schlondorff's "The Ogre" singles out the training of the Hitler
Youth to cinematic advantage.</P>
<P>   Now comes "The Harmonists," due to open in February '99
and based on the memories of the longest-surviving member
of a popular German group.  It's a heartbreaker.  Few films
have pointed out more effectively the utter absurdity of Nazi
doctrine. Less than two years after the accession of Hitler in
January 1933, the group called The Comedian Harmonists
were forbidden to continue giving concerts despite their
popularity with even a raging anti-Semite like Julius Streicher. 
Why?  Three of their six members were Jewish.  Never mind
that once the group got established, concerts were sold out in
Berlin and Munich.  The Jewish half were apparently polluting
the country, according to the senseless mentality of the Nazi
officials, though one could challenge any of them to point out
which three were of that faith.</P>
<P>   The initial half of the film is less dramatic than the
concluding portion, filling us in on the background of the
organization, portraying how the singing sensations were
organized in a way that could serve as a primer to the
formation of many a similar band of musicians.  During the
hard economic times in Germany in 1927, when the labor
force was swelling with the unemployed, there was a demand
for light entertainment to take the people's minds off their
hardships.  A 20-year-old drama student, Harry
Frommermann (Ulrich Noethen), advertises for fellow
vocalists--who must be under the age of 25--and receives
many applicants.  After hiring Robert Biberti (Ben Becker),
Roman Cycowski (Heino Ferch), Erich Abraham Collin
(Heinrich Schafmeister), Ari Leschnikoff (Max Tidof) and
Erwin Bootz (Kai Wiesinger), they rehearse for long hours,
are belittled by a prospective promoter as being funereal in
tone, and finally capture a syncopated feel that they could
call their own.  While the sextet modeled itself after the
popular American a capella group, "The Revellers" and after
the style of Duke Ellington as well, their adaptation of those
models into a German mold became contagious.  </P>
<P>   Joseph Vilsmaier, who directs the movie, and Klaus
Richter, its scripter, convey the joie de vivre of this fun group
whose backstage antics were not often as heartwarming as
their dressed-up performances.  Harry Frommermann and
Robert Biberti fought over the same girl, Erna Eggstein
(Meret Becker), a student whose heart may have belonged to
Harry but who was enticed by Robert's offer of a spacious
room in his home that she could use for her studies.  </P>
<P>   Director Vilsmaier tiptoes over the Nazi atrocities,
portraying only briefly a scene in which brownshirt thugs
smash up a Jewish-owned store in which Erna worked part-
time.  Since the movie covers only the years 1927-1934, anti-
Jewish policies were only beginning.  In fact one gets the
impression by the unanimous cheers of the concert audience
that only a small percentage of the German people had any
hatred toward the Jews, the antipathy coming exclusively
from lower-middle class and unemployed young people who
took out their frustrations on a convenient scapegoat.  One of
the brownshirts is shown to take part in the smashing of the
Jewish-owned store simply because his girl friend rebuffed
him in favor of Harry.  The viewer must question the accuracy
of this mood, particularly given the recent scholarship that
holds that a majority of German people from all groups were
anti-Semitic.</P>
<P>   Ulrich Noethen is the man to watch here.  Resembling
Robert Benigni in both appearance and gestures, his Harry
Frommermann is a shy lad whose faint heart was failing to
win his fair maiden, but whose enthusiasm is expressed
vibrantly in his promotion of the band.  While the production
design for New York during the early 1930's looks counterfeit,
production designer Rolf Zehetbauer effectively captures the
fashion and spirit of the time, a spirit which resembles that of
the United States with its love for the Charleston, for short
hair, and for a devil-may-care attitude complete with a
swanky big-city brothel.  The Comedian Harmonists became
a household name in Germany during the brief period that the
boys performed, while its music is still quite popular in
Germany and Europe.  Like most other musical groups, they
went through the agonies of forming, of gaining a name, of
prospering, and eventually splitting up.  The difference is that
their separation was caused not so much by internal strife but
by outlandish national politics.</P>
