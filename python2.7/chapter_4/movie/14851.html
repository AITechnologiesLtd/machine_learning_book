<P>Plot: Alex comes around in the desert with amnesia. Aided by Farnsworth 
2, who unaware to her is an illusion- projecting cyborg bounty hunter, 
she tries to piece her memories together. Gradually she begins to 
remember her flight from other killer cyborgs and her bid to rescue her 
sister who has returned through time to bring her back to the future.</P>
<P>‘Nemesis 2: Nebula' (1995) was almost entirely unrelated to the first 
`Nemesis' (1993) other than the basic theme of both featuring 
cyborgs/androids trying to overthrow humanity. `Nemesis 3' however 
directly follows on from `Nemesis 2' - the two can be run together 
without a break. Indeed both films appear to have been filmed 
back-to-back - they both share virtually the same credits and some 
actors are credited as being in both films despite having appeared only 
in one.</P>
<P>`Nemesis 2' had almost nothing in the way of plot but nevertheless 
proved quite an efficient sf/action vehicle by  virtue of keeping its 
action moving the entire time. To its credit `Nemesis 3' at least tries 
to be something a little different and take the emphasis away from 
action. There is some (but not much) attempt at developing more plot. 
Unfortunately in the absence of action there isn't too much else to give 
the film any drive. In a rather unwieldly dramatic structure the latter 
half of the film becomes an entire flashback as Price regains her memory 
- and eventually turns into an sf-action chase film all over again. Only 
this time it's not quite as effective as its predecessor - a car chase 
at the climax with digitally blurred dune buggies doesn't work and the 
ending comes annoyingly abruptly as the film sets itself up for the next 
sequel, ‘Nemesis 4: Death Angel'.</P>
<P>On the film's plus side it has some moments of immense strangeness. 
There's an intensely weird opening section with heroine Sue Price waking 
up with complete amnesia and Tim Thomerson turning up as a mercenary 
who, unseen to her, keeps unnervingly slipping back and forward between 
human and a gleaming metal robot skeleton and scanning her with glowing 
green eyes while she is unconscious. One of the more bizarrely 
entertaining elements are two female cyborg mercenaries played by Sharon 
Bruneau and Debbie Muggli who strut through the film like android drag 
queens, making sardonic asides about how the sand is playing hell with 
their circuits and turning to each other and laughing maniacally every 
time they kill someone.</P>
