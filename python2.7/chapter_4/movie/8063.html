<PRE>Batman and Robin
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy 1997</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4)
Directed by Joel Schumacher
Starring George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Chris O'
Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Michael Gough</P>
<P>This 4th installment of the immensely popular movie
series is not as good as the original, but far better than
both of the sequels. It boasts great FX, good chemistry
between the leads, and two outstanding villains. I don;t
understand why people are proclaiming it to be so horrible.
I admit that it's not very intelligent, but it is more
visually impressive then the overrated 5th Element, and we
don't have to suffer through Chris Tucker's performance in
that movie.</P>
<P>The film gets started right away with an exciting opening
sequence (at last, no drawn out, lengthy introductions to
the villains) where Batman and Robin try to stop Mr. Freeze
from stealing a valuable diamond. Right off the bat (no pun
intended) Clooney shows he is a far more interesting Batman
than the dull, miscast Val Kilmer was. He's no Michael
Keaton, but he acquits himself nicely.</P>
<P>Later we learn that Mr. Freeze is a doctor who was trying to
revive his wife, and accidentally froze himself. There are
some great shots of Freeze looking sadly at his wife. Arnold
is an underrated actor, and he pulls these scenes off.</P>
<P>Uma Thurman is even better as Poison Ivy, a botanist who is
angry at the destruction humans cause to the earth. This is
keeping in with the Batman villain introduction, but it is
far less lengthy and annoying as The Penguin or Catwoman in
Batman Returns. Uma has a great deal of fun with the role,
and deliciously overplays every scene.</P>
<P>Once again, Gotham city is a wondrous creation. The visuals
are even better than in the other films, and many of the set
pieces are fun and exciting. The chemistry between Clooney
and O' Donnell is very impressive for two actors who have
never worked together before. Alicia Silverstone, as Batgirl
doesn't match up well to the other performers, but she
really isn't given much to work with, except for a fun fight
scene with Poison Ivy. People like Elle MacPherson and
Vivica A. Fox have roles so small, inconsequential, and dull
that they shouldve been left on the cutting room floor.</P>
<P>I'm not going to try and convince you Batman and Robin is a
great, or even good movie. But it's not nearly as bad as
most of my peers are making it out to be. It's a good piece
of eye candy; exciting, fun, and over before you realize how
dumb it is.</P>
