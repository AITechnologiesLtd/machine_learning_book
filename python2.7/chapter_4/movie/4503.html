<PRE>                                  FOUR ROOMS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I wish I could say I was let down by FOUR ROOMS, but given the sheer
volume of just awful buzz about the film, I think I got what I was
expecting:  an over-anticipated, overworked movie that was full of talent
but devoid of taste.</P>
<P>     It starts off bad enough.  As the credits announce the four
writer/directors (Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez,
and Quentin Tarantino), a cartoon sequence plays over them, in the
tradition of cinematic masterpieces like MANNEQUIN.  This sets the stage: 
New Year's Eve at Hollywood's Mon Signor Hotel and only one bellhop (Tim
Roth), and believe me, it's a rillyrilly wacky place.  The film then
launches into the first of four 30ish-minute shorts, one by each director.</P>
<P>     The first segment is Anders's "The Missing Ingredient," about a coven
of witches (including Madonna, Valeria Golino, and a mostly topless Ione
Skye) who don't quite have everything they need to return their petrified
goddess to flesh.  Cut together like an episode of "Love, American Style,"
this vignette is just plain goofy and without point.  Anders had *never*
made a good movie before this, and she still hasn't, thanks mainly to lots
of rillyrilly bad dialogue and acting.  I heard a rumor that the actual
ending to this episode is after the closing credits, but I'm not sure it's
worth sticking around for.</P>
<P>     The worst of the bunch is Rockwell's "The Wrong Man," wherein a
sadomasochistic guy with a gun terrorizes his wife (Jennifer Beals) and
bellhop Ted.  I never did determine what this episode was all about, and
judging from the silent audience, no one else did either.  (Hint:  Beals
and Rockwell are married.)  Rillyrilly bad music and dialogue also abound.</P>
<P>     Robert Rodriguez's "The Misbehavers" is poor, but at least provides a
few chuckles.  Here, Rodriguez gets to take his comic strip, about some
naughty kids, from his old college newspaper (where yours truly also
worked) into the exciting world of live action.  Dad Antonio Banderas is
funny, but otherwise there's not much that's good here, although nothing
is rillyrilly bad.  Don't forget to smile during the humorous finale and
appreciate the prodigious amounts of vomiting in this episode.</P>
<P>     Wrapping up the film is the patriarch of the bunch, Tarantino
himself, with a ripoff of an old "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" titled "The
Man From Hollywood."  Actually, for 25 minutes the characters (Tarantino,
Beals, Paul Calderon, and Bruce Willis) moan and scream a lot.  Then, for
15 minutes they rip off Hitch's "The Man From Rio," where Peter Lorre bets
that Steve McQueen can't light his lucky lighter 10 times running.  If he
wins, Lorre gives him his car.  If he loses, McQueen loses his pinky. 
Same deal in Tarantinoland, and the very very end pays off this otherwise
drab episode.  Notably poor here are the rillyrilly bad acting and editing
and a rillyrillyrilly bad performance by Willis.</P>
<P>     Watching the finale is almost worth sitting through the last hour of
the film, but Anders and Rockwell should have been cut loose years ago
when this project was dreamed up.  Very disappointing is Tim Roth's
ubiquitous overacting and just plain constantly annoying presence.  Two
stars pretty much cover all the four rooms...generously.</P>
