<P>One of the most inspirational chapters in American history is the
Civil War. It has been the source of voluminous works of literature,
including numerous films. Many of those examine similar themes and use
familiar settings. This film is different in that it is set in one of
the lesser known theaters of the war -- the guerilla battles in the
state of Kansas.</P>
<P>The opening of the film gives a brief overview of the historical
situation. It explains the conflict between the two factions among the
residents of Kansas -- the Jayhawks, who are supporters of the Union,
and the Bushwhackers, who are supporters of the Confederacy. It goes
on to explain that instead of the groups battling each other with
regular armies, they attack each other in guerilla assaults; a
particularly brutal form of war that encompasses innocent civilians.</P>
<P>The story begins by introducing Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack
Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), who are young men about to be sucked into
the developing political situation. Although his father is a German
immigrant, Jake identifies himself singularly as an American, and
particularly as a patriotic Southern supporter like all his friends.
When animosity between the two groups erupts into actual violence, the
boys do what honor dictates and join a loosely organized band of
Bushwhackers in their grave fight for control of the state.</P>
<P>This much of the narrative is typical of a war story. Naive young men
filled with pride and honor are thrust into the hell of war and become
little more than cannon fodder. What is unusual is that the story does
not attempt to show the protagonists in a positive light. The
Bushwhackers are drawn as ruthless terrorists who callously murder and
loot innocent civilians. It is not that the opposing side is intended
to be more pure, in fact they also commit their share of atrocities.
The point is that all war is horrible, but that civil war is
especially tragic because it is necessarily cannibalistic, with hatred
born of familiarity with and proximity to the enemy.</P>
<P>The story adds extra dimensions by injecting a relationship between
Jack and a civilian sympathizer, Sue Lee Shelley (Jewel Kilcher).
Another interesting facet is that one member of the Bushwhacker troop,
Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), is a black man. Historically, most
blacks supported the Union, for obvious reasons, but this story
presents the case of one of the very few former slaves who fought for
the Confederacy.</P>
<P>Although the film has many compelling issues to work with, it is not a
very impressive effort. In order to keep the main character (Jake)
likeable, he is never shown to commit any of the brutality of his
mates. His distaste of cruelty does not mesh with his willingness to
associate with it.</P>
<P>The film is also careless in its presentation. It is jarring to see
men who live rough in the brush consistently wearing clean satin
vests. Director Ang Lee strives to present vivid and engaging imagery,
but some aspects, like the above and the obviously choreographed
battles are disingenuously excessive. It is worthy to note that
although most of the performances are forgettable, Maguire is
successful in presenting a believable character with a charismatic
performance.</P>
<P>Marginally recommended. Although it is well paced and cinematically
rich, the film is pedestrian because of a weak story. Except for the
performance of Tobey Maguire, nothing in the film is noteworthy, yet
the film is watchable. The historical component of the film is
involving, but the poorly developed story is a detriment to any issues
that might be examined.</P>
