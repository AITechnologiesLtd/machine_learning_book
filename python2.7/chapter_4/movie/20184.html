<P>     From the Department of Token Praise:  Give John McTiernan and Michael
Crichton some credit for an action film in which the hero is an Arab.
After years of Middle Eastern fanatics as Hollywood's favorite post-Cold
War villains, THE 13th WARRIOR features as its protagonist Ahmed Ibn
Fahdlan (Antonio Banderas, looking somber and pensive in heavy eye liner),
a diplomat and poet in 10th century Baghdad.  Banished to an unpleasant
nomadic ambassadorship after a dalliance with a powerful man's wife, Ibn
Fahdlan happens upon a group of Norsemen who have recently lost their
king.  When another king sends word that help is needed against a hideous
foe, the heir apparent Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich) leads a band of thirteen
warriors -- including the reluctant Ibn Fahdlan -- to defeat the ghoulish
Wendol, who eat those they slay.</P>
<P>     All right, so the Arab hero is played by a Spaniard -- Hollywood
needs to crawl before it can stagger in a remotely straight line.  The
problem with THE 13th WARRIOR isn't its multicultural sensitivity, but the
unlikely context in which that subtext is placed.  At its core, the film
is the kind of swords-and-shields romp little seen since the early '80s
heyday of Schwarzenegger as CONAN THE BARBARIAN and Singer as THE
BEASTMASTER.  There are dimly lit battles, inhuman foes, tankards of ale
and much bonding between brothers-in-arms.  That the bonding occurs
between rambunctious polytheistic Nordic guys and a devout Muslim gives
the narrative a funky anachronistic flavor -- "Dungeons and Dragons" for
the "why can't we all just get along" '90s.</P>
<P>     There's nothing automatically off-putting about watching men
exchanging prayers in the first millennium -- it's not as though the 20th
century introduced the concept of tolerance.  It just happens to be the
most obvious example of THE 13th WARRIOR's insistence on attending to
subplots and subtext when it hasn't provided the basic framework for an
adventure.  Ibn Fahdlan's Norse comrades are so interchangeable and
lacking in personality that the press notes identify them both by name and
by some trait that might jog the memory -- "Helfdane (Fat)," "Ragnar
(Dour)," and so on.  The Wendol remain shadowy and indistinct, never
developing into truly threatening villains despite the gasps that
accompany the mention of their name.  Meanwhile, there's time spent on a
blink-and-you'll-miss-it romantic interlude for Ibn Fahdlan, and a bit of
Norse political intrigue which exists largely to provide one character a
chance to scowl and flip his fur cloak dramatically every time he appears
on screen.  Thank heavens for the occasional anarchic battle scene to
remind us that this is in fact an adventure film.</P>
<P>     Those battle scenes certainly serve their visceral purpose, perhaps
enough so to please the blood 'n' guts crowd.  It's just that the whole
mess is often too busy to get down to business.  In an early scene, Ibn
Fahdlan and his travelling companion Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) meet with
the Norsemen for the first time.  While Buliwyf speaks in Norwegian, one
of his men (Dennis Storhoi) translates into Latin for Melchisidek, who
then translates into Arabic (which we hear as English) for Ibn Fahdlan.
On the one hand, it's sort of a nice touch, emphasizing the culture clash
with which Ibn Fahdlan must contend; on the other hand, it makes the scene
such a jumble of cuts and translations that it grows dizzying.  McTiernan
has toyed with a pseudo-profound action film, and wound up with only a
pseudo-action film, another noble effort to file in the Department of
Token Praise.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 many sorta Vikings:  4.</PRE>
