<P>Do me a favor: the next person that tells you George Clooney is a
talentless, pretty-boy hack, pop 'em in the mouth.  Better yet, take
them to see O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?.  If they ain't convinced by his
magic therein, there just ain't no convincing 'em.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? is a down-home, no-place-like-home, road
story, in the vein of one of the first, and best, of them: Homer's epic
poem, "The Odyssey".</P>
<P>In depression-era Mississippi, three rather...confused...convicts -
Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro),
and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) - bust out of the chain gang
they're on in search of the $1.2mil treasure Everett told them he stole.
Everett, a self-made leader who is as concerned with his hair and the
pomade that keeps it slicked as he is with the treasure they're after,
doesn't inspire much confidence in the hotheaded Pete or the somewhat
dimwitted Del; but since he's the best they've got, they reluctantly
follow his lead.  The threesome are cautioned by an old soothsayer (Lee
Weaver) that their way would be fraught with dangers to overcome, but
our three heroes are determined to see their odyssey through.</P>
<P>Along their journey, they come across some situations epic and
not-so-epic, involving Pete's backcountry cousin Wash (Frank Callison)
and son Bog (Quinn Gasaway); Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), a
guitarist at a crossroads in his life; a radio announcer (Stephen Root)
whose "can" allows a surprising outlet for the trio plus one; Homer
Stokes (Wayne Duvall), a reform candidate for Governor who really means
it when he says he represents the Little Man (Ed Gale); a trio of sweet
siren temptresses (Mia Tate, Christy Taylor, Musetta Vander); and many
more creatures, great and small.  The threesome are searching for many
things - including redemption and divine intervention - but, like the
Ulysses of centuries ago, what they want most is to find their way Home.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Ok, ok, maybe a quick poppin's too drastic [DISCLAIMER: anyone who'd
give someone else a pop in the mouth on my say-so, needs their head
examined.  Go, quickly, and get thyself Healed, for I have no such Power
over thee].  After all, Clooney can't be held harmless for some of the
bad press he's gotten; for too long, he seems to have gotten by with his
sloe grin, puppydog eyes, and Classic Actor looks.  But that's neither
here nor there; in the "Odyssey"-inspired O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?,
Clooney more than holds his own against the likes of Actors' Actors John
Turturro, Charles Durning, and Holly Hunter.</P>
<P>In fact, it's Hunter (Penny) that set in mind the movie that "O Brother"
reminded me most of: the Coens' equally quirky (though somewhat better)
RAISING ARIZONA, in which she costarred with another "Brother", John
Goodman.  "O Brother" survives the comparison; though it's not quite as
"groundbreaking" as "Arizona" was, for my money, O BROTHER, WHERE ART
THOU? is just as much fun.</P>
<P>The treats in "O Brother" came from all sides: for one, while each actor
was given a chance to shine - Clooney and the hilariously deadpan Tim
Blake Nelson, especially - the ensemble effort that the Coen Boys seem
to inspire, was evident.  Within this large cast, from John Goodman's
broad portrayal of conman Big Dan Teague, to Michael Badalucco as George
Nelson, the gangsta who wouldn't accept the name society would deem him
fit to hold, to the multiple "Odyssey"-esque characters in between, the
players built each segment of "O Brother" onto the next, layering its
rich tones along the way.  Second, behind the scenes, the Brothers Coen
worked their magic in a way I haven't seen from them since FARGO (I'd
love to say more, but it'd involve too many spoilers).  I wonder what
they could possibly come up with next to top these two films.</P>
<P>If anyone involved with this dynamite production could be said to be
flat, it would have to be Charles Durning; I've seen his Governor Pappy
act one too many times in similar Good Ol' Boy roles, and it quickly
wore a nerve for me.  And besides, Paul Newman portrayed the Guv'ner
>From Louisiana much more memorably in BLAZE a few years back.</P>
<P>It's quite amazing to find a movie that actually has me anxious to go
back and read old grade school literature [where's my old copy of Homer,
anyway?].  And, the bonus of watching Clooney move in way I've never
seen him move before?  Priceless.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:</P>
<P>    And speaking of "Magical Negroes"...</P>
<P>I'll be the first to admit that Lee Weaver, as the old blind soothsayer
who first sets Everett, Pete, and Del off on their adventures, occupies
that archetype; soothsaying, after all, *is* Magical, no two ways about
it.  I'm not sweatin' that role at all; it is as it was *supposed* to
be, so I suggest that anyone who wants to get Up In Arms about it,
should take a pill.</P>
<P>I *do*, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Chris Thomas King's
rather dull portrayal of Tommy Johnson, a role apparently inspired by
the fabled story of blues guitarist Robert Johnson.  But my quibble with
King, I reckon, is one that he could never overcome - because for the
life of me, I can't imagine anyone ever doing a better job at playing
Robert Johnson than the incomparable Joe Seneca, as he did in
CROSSROADS.  Sorry Chris; you never had a chance.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line
The real test of a greenlighter, for me, is whether I'd want to see the
movie again, if only eventually.  "O Brother" passed that test and then
some - because I was ready to re-watch this flick immediately.  If only
to hear the "Soggy Bottom Boys" work it again.</P>
<P>O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (rating: greenlight):
Just found my old Ancient Lit textbook.  Hmmm.  Uh...anybody got any
cliff notes I can borrow?</P>
