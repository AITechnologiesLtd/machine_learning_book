SPY KIDS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In SPY KIDS, two kids, following in the footsteps of their parents, get 
a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE assignment into a WILLIE WONKA land.  Writer and 
director Robert Rodriguez, whose unlikely background is in R-rated films 
such as THE FACULTY and DESPERATO, makes an impressive jump into a 
barely PG-rated world.  An intelligent picture that doesn't talk down to 
the kids or the adults, SPY KIDS is that rare film that can wear the 
badge of "family fare" with pride.  It's also imaginative, well cast and 
quite funny.</P>
<P>Just before they become parents, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, played with 
humorous bravado and just a hint of sensuality by Antonio Banderas and 
Carla Gugino, have to give up their day jobs as secret agents.  Now 
telecommuting as espionage consultants, they're itching to get another 
save-the-world field assignment from the OSS.  But, when they do, all 
they can think of are the kids, 12-year-old Carmen (Alexa Vega) and 
8-year-old Juni (Daryl Sabara), who are at home under the watchful eye 
of "Uncle" Felix (Cheech Marin).  </P>
<P>Carmen is a confident charmer, who makes a great role model for young 
girls.  A spunky hero, she says what goes for the story's only 
profanity.  "Oh shiiiiitake mushroom!" she exclaims once when things go 
really bad.  And Juni, who conquers fears so intense that they used to 
cause warts, shows how a youngster can summon the courage within him to 
rise to the challenges of a treacherous situation.</P>
<P>The kids, who bicker like typical siblings, are sure that their parents' 
lives are dull and boring.  "What are you talking about?" Carmen asks 
her Uncle Felix when the literal "Red Alert" warnings going off in their 
house force him to tell them the truth about their parents' profession.  
"My parents can't be spies.  They're not cool enough."  (Let that be a 
warning to children everywhere.  Your parents may be hiding some amazing 
talents that you know nothing about.)</P>
<P>The fun starts when the movie begins to show off its large array of 
futuristic gadgets that would make James Bond envious. These goodies 
range from electrostatic gum that stuns better than Mace to acid crayons 
for cutting through jail bars.  An evil Willie Wonka-like character 
named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) kidnaps the parents.  Floop, who has a 
popular kids' TV show featuring humorously grotesque figures called 
Fooglies, is assisted by a sappily subservient Tony Shalhoub as Minion.</P>
<P>Among the many humorous characters, none are better than the bad guys 
known as the Thumb-Thumbs.  Their torsos have large thumbs where the 
head, arms and legs should be.  These clumsy oafs are, well, all thumbs.  
Writer and director Rodriguez, however, has the steady hands of a 
surgeon as he assembles a richly complex film that is a treat for the 
eyes, the mind and the funny bone of those young and old, as my son and 
my mother can attest. </P>
<P>SPY KIDS runs 1:30.  It is rated PG for action sequences and would be 
acceptable for all ages, as our packed multigenerational audience amply 
demonstrated.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, loved the picture, giving it *** 1/2.  He found 
it funny, interesting and very creative.  He particularly liked the way 
that whole plot was constructed.</P>
