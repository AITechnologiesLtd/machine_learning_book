<PRE>                                PULP FICTION
                       A film review by Alex Winter
                        Copyright 1994 Alex Winter</PRE>
<P>     The phenomenal response to Quentin Tarantino and his film PULP
FICTION scares the crap out of me.  He's garnered the Palme D'or at
Cannes, critical success all over the world, and been hailed as a great
writer-director.  This isn't the first time that a new talent was
prematurely placed on a pedestal, nor that a film this flawed was
received with gushing fanfare.  But it's an alarming indication of how
little we have come to expect from cinema and art in general.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem with PULP FICTION is that it takes Tarantino
almost three hours to tell a story that not only could, but should be
mercifully shorter.  It's a moral allegory, told in vignettes, about
lowlifes who can't get their shit together.  Its theme is communicated
through Jules, a thoughtful but immoral hitman.  On a hit, Jules has an
epiphany, realizing that the power dynamic he exploits is a facade for
the spiritually bankrupt, and he gets out.  It's a good idea, and the
best films of its kind were never longer than an hour and a half.  The
length of PULP FICTION can't be blamed on its labyrinthine narrative,
which dances back and forth in time.  Kubrick's The Killing, made when
he was younger than Tarantino, is at least as intricate, juggles as
many characters and weaves its web in less than ninety minutes.</P>
<P>     PULP FICTION is more gratuitous and meandering than purposefully
complex.  A lot of what we see and how we see it is extraneous.  Like
an overzealous freshman writing student, Tarantino is too desperate to
please to be concise.  And with a vignette format, being concise is
essential.  He spends a half hour on a disaffected white girl,
exploring every detail of her existence, and another forty minutes on a
boxer who bungles his way through a double-cross.  The girl's plotline
makes no sense.  The boxer's story kind of fits the theme but is
short-changed by the overstuffed structure, which doesn't allow any of
the plots to be worked through.</P>
<P>     Tarantino's more interested in his semiotic manipulation of
movie-cliches and narrative trickery than in telling a good story.  His
depiction of Los Angeles feels like the vision of a bad Italian comic
book artist who never left Napoli.  The present-day hitmen are
inexplicably dressed like the Rat pack, the dialogue (though hilarious)
sounds more like an Eric Bogosian rant than human speech, and
everything's steeped in half-hearted symbolism about fate and destiny.
There's so much artifice and excess crammed into PULP FICTION that
Tarantino doesn't just seem disinterested in being pointed, but
terrified of it.  It's no help that the cinematography and soundmix are
so jarring that they actually cause physical pain.</P>
<P>     One of the film's many fans would dispute my points by saying he
enjoyed the movie, however meaningless, so why should it be cut?
That's an understandable question from someone who expects nothing from
film but a titillating puzzle, but not from Tarantino who must want
more of a reaction than that to his work.  Or does he? His decision to
tell stories this way is not just puerile and self-indulgent, it's
indicative of the over-regard for mind-games and artifice that's
plagued the art world since the arrival of Cubism.  And it's the reason
why film, our youngest and, potentially, most powerful art form, has
not evolved past the cradle.  If anything, it's regressed, simply
because we're so attached to our brain-power as an end unto itself.
What could be a dynamic medium for deep expression is mostly a
superficial tool for exercising our intellects, and only filmmakers can
change that.</P>
<P>     It's ironic that PULP FICTION, a perfect model of masturbatory
instead of pointed storytelling, wraps its theme around the Bible.
Jules has spent years blindly quoting Ezekial, chapter 25, which speaks
of God's wrath against the unfaithful.  When he has his epiphany, the
spiritual meaning of the verse becomes clear to him, and he's reborn.
Tarantino may want to stroll backwards in his bible a few pages to
Ecclesiastes, chapter 5: "And what profit hath he that hath labored for
the wind?" Certainly, he's gained fame, wealth and creative freedom.
But what use is that if he can't muster up faith in his own medium?</P>
