<PRE>                            SCENT OF A WOMAN
                       A film review by Jon Webb
                        Copyright 1993 Jon Webb</PRE>
<P>     Al Pacino plays a blind former Lieutenant Colonel who, being
depressed and irascible, has been left in the care of an impoverished
prep school boy for Thanksgiving weekend.  The Colonel plans a trip to
New York City to experience the best life offers and brings the boy
along.</P>
<P>     I read a review that pointed out that this film was intended to be
a sentimental holiday heart-warmer--both the old Colonel and the young
boy learn from each other, etc.--but it turned into a much better film
because of Al Pacino's performance.  That is exactly right.  Pacino
refuses to give the Colonel the one-dimensional nature that would have
made this a superficial film.  His portrayal gets to the heart of the
character of the Colonel, who is not all bad and not all good, and not
completely healed at the end of the film.  He mouths the lines given
him, turning the good ones (about women) into poetry, and keeping the
bad ones (concerning the subplot of the boy's problems at the prep
school) from being totally sentimental trash.  He makes this film
entertaining and worth seeing.</P>
<P>     The prep school boy (played by Chris O'Donnell) is also pretty
good.  Perhaps it is just in reaction to Pacino's performance, but I
thought he'd captured the character of such a young man very well,
particularly in the early scenes.</P>
<P>     That said, there are numerous flaws in this film.  The script is
bad, and the editing often gives one no impression of time passing --
e.g., at the Thanksgiving Dinner they seem to sit down and have pie, and
when the boy is waiting in the car Pacino seems to take about five
minutes, which is something of a disappointing climax after such a big
buildup.</P>
<P>     Even worse, the direction of the Thanksgiving Dinner family is so
bad you don't have any idea what's going on.  Pacino shows up, and
everyone seems constipated.  What's going on there?  The film is best
when O'Donnell and Pacino are alone; at least then they seem to have
some idea of what they're doing.  Martin Brest, the director, doesn't
have a clue.</P>
