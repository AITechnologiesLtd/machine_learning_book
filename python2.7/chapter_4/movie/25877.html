"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>I grew up in a family that didn't recognized Elvis Presley as the King
of Rock ‘n' Roll.  A day or two after Elvis died, I remember asking my
dad who the new King would be, assuming it would be something like
naming a new Pope.  He snorted and said `It's still Dylan,' before
walking off and muttering something about Elvis stealing the black man's
music.  It's the kind of thing that sticks in a little kid's mind.</P>
<P>Bring It On invokes a similar theme of white people ripping off ideas
from black people.  Only instead of music, it's high school cheerleading
routines.  And the white devils almost got away with it, too.</P>
<P>Kirsten Dunst (Virgin Suicides) stars as Torrance Shipman, a senior at
Rancho Carne High.  As the film opens, Tor has a nightmare about
appearing before the entire student sans clothes.  It's no wonder – the
perky student has a lot on her plate.  Her boyfriend is leaving for
college, her mom keeps preaching the importance of concentrating on
schoolwork, and she just became captain of the school's five-time
national champion cheerleading squad.</P>
<P>The apparent victim of an ancient cheerleading curse, Tor's first day as
captain involves the serious injury of one of the squad's integral
members.  Her leadership is called into question by two bitchy
classmates who accuse Tor of acting like a `cheertator' simply because
she insists on holding tryouts for the opening on the prestigious team.
The audition uncovers a amazing find – a transfer student named Missy
(Eliza Dushku, Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) who wants to join
the team because Rancho Carne doesn't have a gymnastics program.  More
importantly, Missy has a hot brother (Jesse Bradford, A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries).</P>
<P>Tor's curse continues at the squad's first practice with Missy, when the
transfer student drags her captain to watch a cheerleading troop in East
Compton.  Apparently, the former Rancho Carne captain had been stealing
cheers and routines from this under-funded school and presenting them as
her own.  The truth was never discovered because the East Compton school
could never afford to attend the state tournament.  The revelation
caused the crushed Tor to exclaim, `My whole cheerleading career has
been a lie!'</P>
<P>Bring It On's trailer makes the film seem like it's going to be an
un-politically correct battle against a white and black, but most of the
film focuses instead on Tor's desperate attempts at creating a decent
routine on her own.  There's a lot of witty banter and slang that
reminded me of Clueless (like when Tor announces that Missy is `the
Poo'), and the film reaches its inevitable conclusion at the
Cheerleading Championships in Daytona.</P>
<P>Sure – a lot of Bring It On doesn't make sense (why would Rancho Carne
bother participating in the state finals when they automatically qualify
for nationals as the defending champs?), but the film is funny enough to
make you not bother caring.  It's full of well-choreographed dance
numbers that put the crappy waltzes in Love's Labour's Lost to shame.</P>
<P>Bring It On is the directorial debut of Peyton Reed, who has directed
some of television's best comedy shows (Upright Citizens Brigade, Mr.
Show).  The script is from another first-timer (Jessica Bendinger) and,
while it isn't a great triumph in filmmaking, I thought the little
things added to the screenplay added greatly to the overall experience
(like the fact that Rancho Carne means, literally, `Meat Ranch').  Stick
around for the closing credits and several decent outtakes.</P>
<P>1:38 - PG-13 for sexual content and adult language</P>
