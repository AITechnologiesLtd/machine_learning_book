1 1/2 stars (out of 4)</PRE>
<PRE> Armageddon blows.</PRE>
<PRE> It a matter of speaking, or course</PRE>
<P> The comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright.  </P>
<P> Directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun), it tells the story about an asteroid the
size of Texas caught on a collision course with earth.</P>
<P> And you thought that dinky little comet in Deep Impact was trouble.  Jeez.</P>
<P> After a great opening, in which an American spaceship, plus the city of New
York, are completely destroyed by a comet shower, NASA detects the said
asteroid and go into a frenzy.</P>
<P> They hire the world's best oil driller (Bruce Willis), and send him and his
crew up into space to fix our globel problem.  That's like sending a mouse into
a cat carrier, isn't it?</P>
<P> The action in Armageddon are so over the top, nonstop, and too ludicrous for
words, I had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times.  I was
not alone.  Plus, to see a wonderful actor like Billy Bob Thornton is a film
like Armageddon is a waste of the actor's talents.</P>
<P> The film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy FX shots.  The only real
reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform Deep Impact.  </P>
<P> Producer Jerry Bruckheimer fails with Armageddon.</P>
<PRE> It's my pick for one of the worst of the year.</PRE>
