<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For those who love the following in their horror tales: schlock, an
old-fashioned Grand Guignol story, and a hammy performance from its
star, it should be noted that this film has all that. Vincent Price is
totally maddening in a dual role as the warlock Joseph Kerwin and as the
innocent great-great-grandson Charles Dexter Ward, who returns sometime
in the late 19th century to Arkham, a small village in New England, to
inherit the palace of the warlock Joseph Kerwin -- someone he bears an
uncanny resemblance to. He was burned-to-the-stake by these villagers
110 years ago for practicing evil magic and cursed the town before he
died, swearing revenge by giving a wonderfully damming speech before his
demise.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>Arriving by carriage to Arkham to claim their inheritance, Charles and
his wife Ann (Debra Paget) are told that the town is haunted and that
they are not wanted here. They are frightened when they witness the town
mutants in the street, those who were born with severe birth defects,
but refuse to leave without visiting their castle. When they enter the
Burning Man Tavern to ask for directions to their castle, they are
shunned except by Dr. Willet (Maxwell). He will tell them of the legend
of the palace they inherited and of how his great-great-grandfather was
accused of being a warlock, who came to the village 150 years ago and
built out of stone transported from Europe his palace, where he
conducted secret experiments in the occult. It was believed he
communicated with the dark underground gods and tried to bring them back
to life. He brought to his palace young woman by putting them in a
trance, as his hope was for them to give birth to a new species on
Earth, one with the powers derived from hell. When his first wife died,
he had Hester (Cathy Merchant), the beautiful fiancée of one of the
town's leading citizens, Ezra Weeden (Leo Gordon), come live with him,
thereby engaging that man's wrath. The warlock used the book of
Necronomican to get the spells and chants and formulas to possibly
unlock the secrets of the other world for the black magician. One night
Ezra and Micah (Elisha) spotted a trance-like young woman crossing the
cemetery and entering the warlock's palace and got the villagers to burn
him at the stake...taking the law into their own hands.</P>
<P>In his palace, Charles is greeted by his hulking manservant Lon Chaney
Jr., who tells him that he is here to serve him. Soon a battle of wills
begins to take place, as the spirit of the warlock tries to enter the
spirit of Charles and take control of his body. Charles has a strong
will of his own and they battle for control, with Charles being the good
guy and the warlock hellbent on revenge to the relatives who acted
against him. He also wants to resurrect Hester from the dead and
continue with Simon and another assistant hidden in the palace's secret
chamber, Jacob (Dierkes), his secret experiments in the occult.
Well...you can imagine how disconcerting that is to those who hang out
in the Burning Man Tavern, as they get wind of what's going on in the
palace and decide to act in the old-fashioned way to rid the village of
that threat!</P>
<P>The film was atmospheric -- plenty of cobwebs, dark corners, and
ghoulish creatures around to add to the eerie tale. I suppose it was
chilling enough but it still lacked that missing magical ingredient to
make this a more satisfying film. I think the problem was that the story
dragged after the exciting opening scene and never could pick up steam
again. This turns out to be a minor film from Roger Corman's oeuvre, not
up to his other more daringly told horror tales... yet, it is enjoyable
in a goofy sort of way.</P>
<P>It was the last film role for Debra Paget, she married her third
husband, a Chinese-American oil millionaire and retired (they divorced
in 1971).</P>
