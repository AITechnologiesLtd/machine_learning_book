<P>Plot: A giant ape escapes as it is being shipped back to Disneyland and 
rampages across the South Korean countryside causing mass destruction 
and snatching up a beautiful American actress.</P>
<P>This South Korean production, originally released as `A.P.E.', was made 
the same year as the Dino de Laurentiis remake of `King Kong'. It was 
clearly hoping to exploit some of the expected success of `King Kong' - 
that is before `King Kong' premiered and became a big heap of ape dung 
with anybody who had seen the original and audiences alike. The poster 
advertized itself with the byline "not to be confused with the original 
`King Kong'' - clearly the distributor had the delusion that some 
audiences may well have confused the two - and it is indeed quite 
possible, for `Gorilla' blatantly steals from `King Kong' even down to 
having the giant ape abducting a blonde actress.</P>
<P>But in all other regards there is extremely little likelihood audiences 
might have confused `Gorilla' and `King Kong' - `King Kong' is one of 
the greatest of all monster movies; `Gorilla' is laughable in every 
respect. The effects work is shockingly bad. The scenes of the ape 
destroying a ridiculously unconvincing model ship and then wrestling 
with a rubber shark at the start of the film are a clear indication of 
what is to come. And the scenes that follow with the ape rampaging 
through and smashing obvious plywood houses and, in a couple of really 
hysterically unconvincing model shots, stepping over a toy cow and 
batting a hanglider and pilot on an visible wire, produce gales of 
laughter in their ineptitude. One can visibly see the eyeholes that have 
been made in the mask for the actor inside. Scenes of destruction go on 
and on forever without even the slightest degree of directorial 
conviction of dramatic interest being created, due to the fact that the 
film eschews almost any type of optical shots whatsoever - we never see 
any shots of the ape and people together in the same frame. Although the 
reason for this could well be that the three optical shots we do see 
which patch the ape over stock background shots of Seoul are some of the 
worst travelling matte shots in the history of special effects. The ape 
suit is completely immobile in expression and one can clearly see the 
eyeholes that have been made in the mask for the actor inside. Stock 
footage of military vehicles on manoeuvres, which are meant to stand in 
for the massed military attack against the ape, are repeated several 
times throughout.</P>
<P>The film was originally made in 3D but has only been seen flat in the 
West. Thus there are an inordinate number of shots with extras firing 
burning spears at the camera, soldiers rushing into the camera to pose 
and shoot, and the ape throwing the same rock on a wire at the camera.</P>
<P>There is the odd occasionally amusing line. "Let's see him dance for his 
organ grinder now," says the general as the military shoot the ape down. 
And the hero's end epithet for the ape - "He was too big for a small 
world like ours" - raises unintentional laughter. Alex Nicol at least 
gives an amusingly hard-headed performance as the American colonel (and 
should get some type of award for having to yell an entire performance 
into a telephone - even when he is out on field maneuvers). But this is 
really an appallingly bad film in every regard - the most amusing thing 
about it was its 1983 retitling `The Attack of the Giant Horny Gorilla'.</P>
