<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        I remember that when I saw Honey, I Shrunk the Kids at a much younger
age, I was less impressed with that film than I am with The Borrowers
now, in my twenties.  I never go into a kid-oriented film expecting
something as crafty and entertaining as this.  The special effects and
sets are all extremely good, and the characters played by couple of
great actors (John Goodman and Jim Broadbent) make this an all-around
pleasant experience.  </P>
<P>        The film is essentially about a family of small people, called
Borrowers.  At the head of the family is Pod Clock (Broadbent) and his
wife, Homily Clock (Celia Imrie).   They have two children, Arrietty
(Flora Newbigin) and Peagreen (Tom Felton).   They live in the nooks and
crannies of a house that belongs to the Lenders--a family of big, silly
beings (that's what the Borrowers call humans).  The Lenders have a son,
Pete (Bradley Pierce), who discovers the Borrowers and befriends them.  
When the Lenders are forced to move out of their house by the evil
businessman Oscious P. Potter (Goodman), the Borrowers learn that Potter
has actually stolen a will that will declare the Lenders as the rightful
owners of the house.  It is then up to little Arrietty and Peagreen to
get ahold of the will.  Potter, of course, finds out about the little
people and brings in an exterminator (Mark Williams), but they are no
match for the Borrowers.</P>
<P>        I suppose the success of this film owes a lot to the presence of John
Goodman.   Goodman, in all of his jolly hugeness, proves that he can
both be evil and funny at the same time.  He never goes into the
unwanted realm of overacting, either, so there aren't really any moments
in The Borrowers that are painful to watch.  And the great Jim Broadbent
is wonderfully entertaining as Pod Clock (I love that name), the British
ringleader of his family of small people.</P>
<P>        The film is filled with great sets and special effects.  Director Peter
Hewitt does a professional job of making everyday places--like the
kitchen, for instance--seem threateningly large.  The sets are extremely
detailed and authentic, and the film is surprisingly atmospheric.  The
special-effects, as well, are some of the best in recent memory:  the
integration of small and large people has never been done as smoothly as
this.  There are also some truly funny moments, most of them including
Goodman and a very strange police officer (played by Hugh Laurie).  </P>
<P>        The Borrowers is a fun, imaginative little film.  It's the kind of
movie that parents can enjoy at the same time as their kids.  It's also
that rare kind of film that will keep kids' attention despite the lack
of gratuitous violence and gore.   And, despite the fact that it is
intended for kids, I can recommend this film to anyone--I imagine it
will hold the attention of even the most skeptical teenagers.  </P>
