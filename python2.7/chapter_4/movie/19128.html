<P>FILM REVIEW: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)</P>
<P>Austin Powers has gone mainstream. The original Austin Powers: International
Man of Mystery came from nowhere. Saturday Night Live alum Mike Myers
gambled with a quirky concept and a ridiculous character and won. It is one
of the funniest movies of the decade and has become an instant classic. In
contrast, a monstrous marketing campaign and unavoidable hype preceded
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Suddenly, white bread top-40 radio
announcers and cheesy TV morning show hosts are making reference to
Powerisms such as "groovy, baby" and "shagadelic." Myers' unlikely cult hero
is pasted on billboards, bus stop signs, and on magazine ads everywhere.
Unfortunately, while The Spy Who Shagged Me is packed with laughs, it is a
far less clever and satisfying than the original.</P>
<P>The Spy Who Shagged Me starts where the first film left off, with Powers and
his new bride, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), on their honeymoon.
Without spoiling the start of the film, I'll only say that things don't work
out well for the newlyweds, and very quickly, Powers is back in action and
single again. And it's not a minute too soon, because Dr. Evil is also back,
scheming once again to dominate the globe. He is joined this time by a
temperamental miniature clone of himself, "Mini-Me." Dr. Evil hatches a new
world-domination plot centered around eliminating Powers' interference by
going back in time and "stealing his Mojo" while also setting up a powerful
laser on the moon. Powers follows Dr. Evil back to the sixties, and, with
the help of a gorgeous CIA agent, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham), tries
to once more thwart Dr. Evil's diabolical schemes.</P>
<P>Mike Myers' performance is once again brilliant as both lead roles. His
comic timing, facial expressions, and willingness to do anything for a laugh
set him alongside Jim Carrey one of the funniest entertainers today. Graham,
sadly, is a disappointment. Unlike Hurley, Graham doesn't complement Myers
very well. As Vanessa Kensington, Hurley provided a contrast and a challenge
to Powers, while Shagwell is just a good-looking bimbo who wants to sleep
with Powers. She has some good lines, but they are all just snappy come-ons
instead of clever exchanges. Graham looks great in Bond-girl outfits, but
they gave her Bond-girl airiness as well.</P>
<P>And yet, unlike the original Austin Powers, Myers' physical comedy and wacky
characters drive The Spy Who Shagged Me, without the support of a decent
story. The Spy Who Shagged Me abandons the fundamental premise of the
original – that Austin Powers, and his arch-nemesis, Dr. Evil, were fish out
of water, 1960s characters thrust into the vastly different world of the
late 1990s. Much of the humor in the original Austin Powers film came from
Dr. Evil and Austin Powers' struggles to adjust to today's attitudes and
realities. In place of a decent story, The Spy Who Shagged Me substitutes
juvenile bathroom humor. As if to try and out-do There's Something About
Mary, this film has more than its share of bathroom humor – a shame, since
the original was funnier without anywhere near as many junior-high gags.</P>
<P>Without the conflict of Powers not fitting in, the feel of the film shifts.
Whereas the recurring joke in the first film was that Powers was an
unattractive, ridiculously dressed, hairy pervert who was hopelessly
out-of-date, in The Spy Who Shagged Me, he has become fashionable,
irresistible to women, and in-tune with the times. Taking Powers and Evil
back to the 1960s doesn't add much to the story. Except for the outfits and
cars, most of the plot and story would have worked fine in the present day.</P>
<P>Still, while imperfect, The Spy Who Shagged Me is a lot of fun. It's worth
the ticket price just to see the opening credit sequence (words can't do it
justice), Dr. Evil's appearance on the Jerry Springer show, and any of Dr.
Evil's tirades against his "not-evil-enough" son, Scott Evil (Seth Green).
Also, the film does well by not taking itself too seriously. In one scene,
as Powers prepares to go back in time to stop Dr. Evil, he begins asking the
Chief of British Intelligence, Basil Exposition (Michael York), about the
paradoxes and implications of his impact on the flow of time if he goes back
to the sixties. York tells Powers not to worry about it and just "do what
you always do: have a good time," then turns to the camera and says to the
audience, "and that goes for you too!" Myers looks at the camera as well and
nods in agreement.</P>
<P>The Spy Who Shagged Me offers a lot of laughs, but the film feels more like
a long string of skits and memorable lines rather than a complete movie. It'
s an enjoyable romp, but a far cry from its classic predecessor.</P>
<PRE>GRADE: B</PRE>
