                       A film review by Ivana Redwine
                        Copyright 1996 Ivana Redwine</PRE>
<P>Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, John 
Leguizamo, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora. Directed by 
Baz Luhrmann. Screenplay: Craig Pearce and Baz Luhrmann. Producers: 
Gabriella Martinelli, Baz Luhrmann. MPAA Rating PG-13 (Adult Themes, 
Violence). Running Time 121 Minutes.</P>
<P>Visually dense with a well-integrated musical score that runs the 
gamut from rock to classical, Baz Luhrmann's film WILLIAM 
SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET took me for a thrilling ride on an 
operatic tidal wave of emotion. I was almost overwhelmed by the sheer 
force of this powerful film, which I found to be a brilliantly 
innovative work of sheer cinematic artistry. It is a film that 
demands a lot from its audience and elicits a strong reaction of 
love or hate or a combination of the two.</P>
<P>Although Luhrmann has generally preserved Shakespeare's language, it 
is bold imagery and music that drive the film more than the words 
spoken by the actors. Also, the setting is changed from 14th-century 
Verona, Italy, to a fictional composite 20th-century city named 
Verona Beach, a creation that is a surreal nightmare wrought wholly 
from Luhrmann's imagination. To my mind, this film is as much 
Luhrmann's creation as it is the Bard's. I realize that Shakespeare's 
works are revered texts and to play fast and loose with them is risky 
business. Shakespeare purists may disagree, but what matters is that 
Luhrmann pulls his interpretation off brilliantly. However, Luhrmann 
has changed enough here that I would not blame anyone for seeing this 
film as a work separate from Shakespeare, yet closely related to it. 
While the film has been released with the title WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S 
 ROMEO AND JULIET, presumably for purposes of name recognition, titles 
like VERONA BEACH or BAZ LUHRMANN'S ROMEO AND JULIET would be more 
fitting.</P>
<P>Framed by the matrix of this film's unique vision, the essential plot 
elements of Shakespeare's tale remain basically intact. Two of the 
leading families of Verona Beach, the Montagues and the Capulets, are 
bitter enemies. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio), a Montague, crashes a 
costume party at the Capulet mansion where he falls in love with 
Juliet (Claire Danes), unaware that she is the host's daughter. Soon 
after Romeo and Juliet are secretly married, Romeo's friend Mercutio 
(Harold Perrineau) is killed by Juliet's cousin. Enraged by the death 
of his friend, Romeo kills Tybalt (John Leguizamo). As a result, 
Romeo is banished from Verona Beach. Juliet's parents have not been 
told that she has married Romeo, and they put her under tremendous 
pressure to marry Paris. (In the film Paris is cleverly introduced via 
a magazine cover as bachelor of the year.) Desperately trying to avoid 
this union, Juliet takes a potion that mimics death with a deep sleep, 
and Friar Lawrence (Pete Postlethwaite) sends Romeo a message about 
Juliet's ruse. (The film wittily has the message sent by a courier 
service named "Post Haste.") Leaving exile without receiving the Post 
Haste dispatch, Romeo goes to the church where the unconscious Juliet 
lies in a casket. Then mistakenly thinking her dead, he takes poison 
in despair. Juliet awakens just as the poison starts to take effect 
on Romeo. She takes Romeo's gun (not a dagger as in the original 
Shakespeare) and commits suicide. Luhrmann's change of weapon makes 
it a bloodier and more viscerally violent end. The image of the 
blood-spattered bodies of the lovers nestled together as the film 
nears its end is a particularly gruesome sight.</P>
<P>Baz Luhrmann is a daring filmmaker with an eclectic style, which makes 
for some vividly creative and memorable scenes. Verona Beach is a 
place so fantastic that it could exist only in a parallel universe; 
yet it is beset with many of the same problems that plague modern 
life, including urban violence and a media that blitzes the senses 
with a barrage of information. Our first hint of this parallel world 
comes when the film begins with a television screen that frames a 
newscaster who delivers the prologue in the same calm tone in which we 
are accustomed to hearing the news of the tragedies of modern life.</P>
<P>There is a witty scene set in a gas station where insults are traded 
between the "Montague boys" and some of the younger members of the 
Capulet clan; here there are echoes of WEST SIDE STORY along with the 
film language of contemporary action movies. In my opinion, this scene 
would be merely derivative in the hands of a less competent director; 
instead, it turns into a scintillating synthesis. </P>
<P>The intensity and virtuosity of the costume ball sequence set at the 
Capulet mansion is a tour de force. Romeo enters the party while under 
the influence of a pill given to him earlier by Mercutio, and the 
kaleidoscopic array of vivid imagery and daring camera work reflects 
Romeo's altered state of consciousness. Soon he is overwhelmed by both 
the party and the effects of the drug and makes an exit to the men's 
room. Trying to sober himself up, he places his face in a basin of 
water. He comes up for air, starts examining fish in an aquarium, and 
sees Juliet through the aquarium's glass. Romeo and Juliet seem to 
fall in love while watching the fish and each other, and this moment 
in the film struck me as both lyrically beautiful and hauntingly 
strange. The sequence is reminiscent of Federico Fellini and Ken 
Russell, while remaining something that is distinctively Luhrmann's 
own.</P>
<P>The film's treatment of the famous balcony scene departs radically 
from the traditional by having the young lovers fall into an adjacent 
swimming pool and deliver much of their dialog while treading water. 
This is daring, but I am not sure it entirely worked; I missed some 
of the power of the more traditional interpretations of the scene. 
Still, I thought it was a fresh and engaging scene with a charm all 
its own. </P>
<P>Three main motifs run through the film like a series of interrelated 
fugues--water, guns, and religious iconography--creating a complicated 
visual tapestry. These motifs can be interpreted on any number of 
levels: Jungian, Freudian, personal. While there seems no simple way 
to interpret them, I thought that the motifs added a touch to the 
film that was both surreal and at the same time intensely real; they 
seemed to belong to the world between wakefulness and sleep. However, 
I concede that this often had the effect of making the film harder 
to follow. In addition, sometimes these motifs were deliberately 
provocative, making the film more unsettling. In particular, I found 
that guns--sleekly designed and seductively photographed--seemed 
almost omnipresent, but they also fit the artistic vision of the film 
and were integral to the nightmarish violence that permeated Verona  
Beach. In addition, some viewers might find Luhrmann's freewheeling 
approach to religious imagery irreverent. However, in general I 
thought the use of these three motifs made the film more dynamic, so 
I gave the film artistic license on the parts that disturbed me.</P>
<P>There was one thing that Luhrmann did that seemed to me to be a touch 
of sheer genius. When the "star-crossed" lovers are alone on the 
screen, the bombardment of music and surreal imagery seems to fade 
away: it is as if the truth of their young love gives them a temporary 
refuge from the horror of Verona Beach.</P>
<P>The performances in the film are surprisingly good, although they are 
not the kind of great performances given in film adaptations of 
Shakespeare featuring actors such as Ian McKellen, Kenneth Branagh, or 
Laurence Olivier. There is less emphasis on Shakespeare's language in 
this film, so if the performances cannot match the perfection of 
trained Shakespearean actors, it is not as much of a distraction as 
one might think. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio still manage to 
shine; the innocence and exuberance of their actual youth makes them 
magic on the screen. </P>
<P>Two of the supporting performances are particularly good. Harold 
Perrineau's Mercutio is charismatic throughout the film, and at times 
he is superb. Perrineau manages to steal the show as a dazzling drag 
diva in the costume ball scene. John Leguizamo gives a powerful 
performance as Tybalt; he projects some of the malignant malevolence 
of pure hate into the role.</P>
<P>The intensity level of this film is overwhelming at times, and that is 
what struck me as both the film's strength and its weakness. This is a 
highly stylized film, and I found that style sometimes interfered with 
substance. There were times in the film when I yearned for greater 
focus on the poetic power of the Bard's words. This is not a perfect 
film, but it is a brave and often brilliant one. A deliberately daring 
and disturbing interpretation of Shakespeare's work, I must admit that 
it is not for everyone. But I think it is easily one of the best and 
most important films of this year. This is a film that will be 
watched, studied, and its merits debated for years to come. </P>
