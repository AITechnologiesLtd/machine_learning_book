<PRE>                                    K2
                       A film review by Eugene Miya</PRE>
<P>[This review must remain in the public domain.]</P>
<P>     I had not planned on reviewing this film until a storm of more or
less uninformed material appeared.</P>
<P>     What is K2?  K2 is the well-known American ski company.  It is also
the second highest mountain in the world.  K2 holds a special place in
the history of American climbing: the Americans tried to climb K2 while
the British attempted Everest (still higher than K2 despite recent
surveys documented by Brad Washburn [Boston Science Museum] and Nova).
Although K2 is second in height, K2 is considerably more technically
challenging than most Everest routes.  K2 has taken its share of lives
prior and following its ascent by the Italians.</P>
<P>     The film K2 based on a one-act play by a Stanford grad about a
soul-searching bivouac on an open ledge.  Two climbers, buddies with 
opposite personalities: one a competitive, emotional, hard-bitten 
lawyer; the other an injured, more meticulous scientist.  The set 
usually consisted of a rappel down to a "ledge" where the evening was
spent including an avalanche which buried or destroyed what remaining
gear they had.  It wasn't an action play.  In the morning, the
climber(s) continue on.</P>
<P>     Remember this was a play in development, variations occur.  The 
performance I saw had the author (noted in the credits and the 
screenplay) as one of the climbers.  We had an audience discussion 
session following our performance.  The author is a boulderer who lost
a friend in the Tetons (the play was a Teton Group Production and I
wish I had kept a poster).  I was not highly impressed with the play: I
felt it was a bit contrived and the personalities were thin.  This is
not a reason to deter me from seeing the film.</P>
<P>     The plot of the film is similar: two buddies in a city, nothing 
strange about that until one builders (climbs up the outside of a 
building) up to an apartment.  We next see them on a climb where they
encounter another party.  They briefly interact when an avalanche kills
two members of the second party.  The other party was planning an ascent
of K2 (one older climber is the sugar-daddy).  The rest of the film is
about the buddies muscling their way onto the expedition and getting up
the mountain.</P>
<P>     It's kind of a macho film.  Climbers have rather strong 
personalities and one-dimensional personalities (ambitions).  You kind
of need this to get up peaks of this size.  It makes for great
arguments at high altitude.  The ambitions of each character reflect on
the different lives of the two climbers.</P>
<P>     The main problem with the film is the sense of time and continuity.
The story is straight-line.  Consider viewing climbers who are one 
moment in shadow and one moment in bright sun.  Not a cloud in the sky
[note this did not stop director Philip Kaufman and THE RIGHT STUFF.]
Sure.  There are numerous other "errors:" e.g., the expedition is
supposed to start in Seattle (it's Vancouver, BC; if you have been
there, you can recognize the skyline and the lack of a Space-Needle).
So you have to suspend your disbelief a little more than most films.</P>
<P>     These are minor, really trivial nit-picking.  The mountain actually
filmed is Mt. Waddington, a serious peak by any standard.  It makes a
respectable, difficult peak.  There is *one* picture of the *real* K2 if
you know when to look, not fair to the non-climber.  Some of the 
filming did occur in Pakistan, a very dry nation set back from the 
Indian Ocean.  This was very well captured.  But if you look carefully
down canyon you can see a frozen lake and trees.  You  don't find
forests like this in Pakistan.  You don't typically need ladders to
bridge crevices into K2: this is borrowed from Everest expeditions after
the 1970 Japanese Climbing and Skiing expedition with one particularly
memorable film shot across a ladder bridge.  We see numerous camps
throughout the film.  The tents never rattled enough in high winds, but
if they did, the audience would never be able to hear what the climbers
were saying.</P>
<P>     The film has moments borrowed from the American literature on K2
and other climbing accounts.  A scene involving the solution of a
porter dispute came straight from the 1975 American attempt.  A
late-night evacuation was similar to a 1953 American story which went
into history.  This adds a bit to the realism.  Unfortunately the time 
compression creeps in (you don't walk nearly as fast at that elevation
as they show in the film).  Yeah, some dumb looking soloing (contrary to
most expedition technique), numerous dramatic falls and arrests--far too
many.  It is nearly impossible to capture the internal intensity which
drives climbers on peaks like K2.</P>
<P>     Time is the climber's single most important resource.  Big peak 
climbers usually start before dawn, not conducive to filming or
storyline or views.  A motion picture can't capture this time scale and
the film suffers a little for it.  Sure, the plot is predictable,
because the storyline is very linear.  The usual expedition personality
conflicts take place.  The bivouac on which the play is based barely
lasts a minute.  I timed it.  Don't blink.</P>
<P>     But there are bright moments for the viewing climber: an early
scene takes a step back from a perfect hand crack on a beautiful
granite buttress (completely in the shade, by the way).  Only a climber
can appreciate this.  In comparison to the play which occurs on a
ledge, the soul-searching takes place over three or four camps on
different climbs.  I believe this actually makes the film a little
better structured and more realistic.</P>
<P>     The film's use of oxygen and adrenaline is a joke.  The film is a
bit on the melodramatic side, probably necessary because real climbing
as a filming activity is *really dull*.  I mean slow, meticious, *dull*.
Believe me, I know--I've done it 22 years now and it only really 
interests its own collection of "odd-balls."  So I really doubt this 
film will last long in the theaters.  Americans are not climbers and 
outdoors people to the level of the Alpine nations.  Americans are 
arm-chair Monday night football fans (and baseball, and basketball) 
fans.  A few are arm-chair climbers.  Clearly, K2 is better known as a
ski company than a peak in the US.</P>
<P>     The talents of Patricia Charbonney (sp?), a fine, very attractive, 
up-and-coming actress are wasted.  She plays a "climber" with some 
limited basis in fact who in reality caused some friction on a couple
of real K2 expeditions.  She is not nearly as obnoxious in this film
and a dynamic is missed.  The film could have also explored the
personality of Michael Biehn's character from the training in his
office.</P>
<P>     The film is dedicated to Jim Wickwire who did reach the summit of
K2 in 1978 (with Lou Reichart (sp?)) and survived a solo bivouac and
participated in a 1975 attempt.  Jim Wickwire was a consultant to the
film along with numerous Canadian climbs including Pat Morrow (second
ascender of all continental high points).  Another useful technique
missing in this film is showing where K2 is.  George Lucas' films make 
excellent geographic use of maps.</P>
<P>     The SJ Mercury gave it 3 stars.  Far too high.  Their review pointed 
out that there were no close up face shots, a good point.  The 
perspective is always with some distance.  The NY Times panned it (that's
up to the people at nyt.com).  The film is not among the worse films to
portray climbing: bad films (with a few decent climbing scenes) like
THE EIGER SANCTION [the "Plan 9" of climbing films] or FIVE DAYS ONE
SUMMER.  I can't recommend a film like K2 at today's ticket prices.  It
will probably show better on a big screen than a little screen, so if
you are interested, this is a weak thumbs-up, so see it at a matinee.
$6.75?  Well, hard to justify.  It is not the ultimate high.  Me?  I'd
rather go climbing, but every climber I've talked to stood around
thinking about what they saw.  It is mildly interesting and better than
the play.</P>
<PRE>     I have a few other thoughts.  Not worth putting in, this review is
too long as it is.</PRE>
