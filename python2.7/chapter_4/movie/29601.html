<P>Being an immigrant is no fun.  For one thing, you're leaving a
country that you're probably attached to.  To prove this, listen to
Americans who came from other parts of the world to live here
refer to "my country."  "My country" is usually Puerto Rico or El
Salvador or Russia or any one of the two-hundred places from
which the U.S. gains new residents.  For another, adjusting to life
in a new country is anything but easy.  To prove this, listen to
how many immigrants from non-English-speaking countries talk
not English but rather their original language when speaking to
others from their homelands.  "Yana's Friends," a film by Arik
Kaplun which is co-written by Simeon Vinokur, yields universal
truths of this nature by focusing on a handful of Russian Jews
who went to Israel to live and who for the most part prefer
speaking Russian to Hebrew and have a difficult time
assimilating into what is to them a strange land despite being
inhabited primarily by fellow Jews.  How does Yana and how do
her friends and neighbors deal with this issue, one which is made
even more problematic during the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf in
which Tel Aviv faced bombardment by Iraqi Scud missiles?</P>
<P>The film, which swept awards in Israel including that country's
"Oscar" for best film director, actress and a host of other tributes,
is a warm-hearted, often funny tale with Fellini-esque overtones
that opens on Yana (Evelyn Kaplun), a young Russian, pretty
and pregnant, a new resident in Tel Aviv who because of a lack
of money must share an apartment with an equally young
wedding photographer, Eli (Nir Levy).  Eli is a fun guy who enjoys
the sexual favors of several women and sees an opportunity with
Yana as well when the latter's deadbeat husband leaves her
broke and returns to his homeland with money that the Israeli
government traditionally gives to new settlers.  Given the
circumstances--a lonely Yana who is attracted to the magnetic
Eli, their  bond strengthened by the agitation caused by repeated
air raids--Yana and Eli develop a passionate relationship.  When
Valentin Belonogov's camera is not focused on the downscale
flat that they share, the lens turns on several other Russian Jews
who live in the area, including the aging invalid and World War II
hero Yitzhak (Moscu Alcalay), whose granddaughter Mila (Lena
Sachanova) exploits him by turning his chair out on the street to
attract donations from sympathetic passersby.  Mila's husband
Alik (Vladimir Friedman) fights regularly with street accordionist
Yuri (Shmil Ben-Ari) for space on the sidewalk--all of which
contributes to our understanding of the difficulties faced by new
occupants of a state that simply does not have enough dignified
jobs to accommodate them.</P>
<P>Director Arik Kaplun is himself a product of the dislocations
caused by the exodus of Jews from Russia who, like many of his
countrymen had been trained for high-level jobs that cannot be
accommodated in Israel.  Given the need of immigrants other
than those who come over with sizable bank accounts for
housing, we wonder how these needy people were assigned
housing in Tel Aviv when they would more likely to apportioned to
border areas and more dangerous communities perhaps in the
West Bank or even Gaza.  You can imagine, then, how much
harder life must be for those who live in remote areas, but
director Kaplun does give us a reasonably amusing and sexy
take on the subject of dislocation.  Given Evelyn Kaplun's own
Russian background, we are in awe of her fluency in both her
own language and Hebrew in a film which features Russian and
Hebrew conversation with English commentary on the battle
against Saddam Hussein.  While Israel has a fairly thriving film
industry, virtually nothing that country turns out can be compared
too favorably with the wonderful fare that we get annually from
Iran.  Nevertheless "Yana's Friends" can be recommended for its
humanity, its humor, and its down-to-earth qualities.  We see that
even during wartime, when gas masks must be donned, romance
and everyday business go on.  In fact the most amusing scene in
the film is an original, headlining Yana and her best friend Eli in
erotic embrace while wearing those infernal gas masks.</P>
