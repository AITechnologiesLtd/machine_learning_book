<PRE>                                 A BRONX TALE
                       A film review by Chuck Dowling
                        Copyright 1997 Chuck Dowling</PRE>
<P>A Bronx Tale (1993) ***** out of ***** - C:Robert De Niro, Chazz
Palminteri, Francis Capra, Lillo Brancato.</P>
<P>"A Bronx Tale" marks the directorial debut of Robert De Niro, who is in my
opinion, the finest actor working today. And if his next directing effort is
as good as this one, he'll be one of the finest directors as well.</P>
<P>The story involves a impressionable young man, Calogero, who grows up during
the 60s in the Bronx, under two different influences. One is the
neighborhood gangster, Sonny (Palminteri), and the other is his bus driver
father, Lorenzo (De Niro). De Niro was very wise to play the role of Lorenzo
instead of playing Sonny, as most would have expected him to do.</P>
<P>Lorenzo tries to protect his family and teaches his son how to stay safe in
the outside world. It is a difficult task, however, as Calogero learns that
just being seen with the most popular guy in town brings respect and gifts.
Lorenzo tells his son that the only reason Sonny is in the position that
he's in is because he is feared by the neighborhood, not loved.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Sonny steers Calogero away from the life and dangers of
organized crime, and warns him to avoid the immature behavior of other boys
in the neighborhood who think that they soon will be gangsters too.</P>
<P>To complicate matters further, Calogero falls for a very respectable black
girl in a world where the Italian and black cultures do not interact. Both
Sonny and Lorenzo have mixed feelings about the subject, making Calogero's
life choices even more difficult.</P>
<P>Palminteri's script is on a completely different level from most gangster
films, offering much, much more than just crime and bloodshed. The
characters are very human, very believable, and therefore, very compelling
to watch. The actors, most of whom are complete unknowns, do an outstanding
job. De Niro's direction is excellent, proving that he has learned much from
the great talent he's worked with over the years. He fills the film with
details, and a minute into it, the world he has recreated seems perfectly
real. Unbelieveably, the film didn't receive a single Oscar nomination, and
it should have had many.</P>
