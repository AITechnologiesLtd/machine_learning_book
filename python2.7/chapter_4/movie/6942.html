<PRE>                               FOOLS RUSH IN
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     I don't care how many times a certain premise has been exploited in
Hollywood because there are some stories that find a way to reach you by just
being well made films. 'Fools Rush In' isn't necessarily well made in a lot
of areas but it is a heartfelt romantic adventure with the right doses of
comedy and drama mixed together.</P>
<P>     Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek are two strangers from wildly different
backgrounds who have a one night stand and she shows up three months later to
tell him that she's pregnant!  After rushing into marriage a lot of things
such as religion, living arrangements and dealing with the in-laws are to be
sorted out as things begin to unfold in the life of this young couple who
have many hurdles to overcome.</P>
<P>     I laughed in all the right places and felt sentimental at other times
and this is a movie that remains faithful to its central characterizations
but does fail to develop its supporting players who could have added a lot of
zest to the story.  </P>
<P>     One of the problems I encountered with 'Fools Rush In' was the tempo
with which the story unfolded.  It basically tells you everything up front in
the first half hour, makes its point but then seems to get lazy before
redeeming itself later on.  It is an uneven and slightly aloof movie which is
pleasant enough and is unquestionably a great date movie.  It's one of those
movies that in many ways has to be accepted for what it is because extreme
criticism of a good natured film can be pushing the boundaries of escapism
and 'Fools Rush In' is acceptable escapism.</P>
