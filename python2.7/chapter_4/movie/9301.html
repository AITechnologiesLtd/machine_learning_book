<P>   What better location for a sweeping romance than atop a
rocky knoll overlooking the raging waters of England's Cornish
coast?  In adapting Joseph Conrad's sea story embracing the
love of two young people who are reviled by their community,
screenwriter Tim Willocks has done quite a job in opening up
a 30-page story into a two-hour epic.  The movie features
director Beeban Kidron's exploitation of dramatic vistas, a
solid sense of period, and two performers who could soon
become household names.</P>
<P>   "Swept from the Sea," taken from Conrad's story "Amy
Foster," is somewhat autobiographical, giving its audience the
feel for the variety of experiences which filled the novelist's
stirring life.  In dramatizing the narrative of a Russian who
sailed for the New World in the late 19th century, survived a
shipwreck and later succumbed to pneumonia, Conrad
recollects his own father, Apollo Korzeniowski, who was exiled
to a remote Russian province because of his political activities
while Joseph later became the victim of tuberculosis.</P>
<P>   Opening amid the tempestuous clime of poverty-stricken
folk in Russia, Ms. Kidron takes us on a journey which begins
with a long voyage embarked upon by scores of people in a
train's cattle car, transferring to a rickety ship in Hamburg for
the flight to America. Yanko (Vincent Perez), the sole survivor
of a wreck, is washed ashore at Cornwall, believing at first
that his buddies sailed on to America.  The bearded, filthy,
wild-eyed immigrant, knowing not a word of English, is looked
upon with terror by the rural residents but treated kindly by
the most educated of its inhabitants, Dr. James Kennedy (Ian
McKellen) and with passionate care by Amy Foster (Rachel
Weisz).  </P>
<P>   The romance between Amy and Yanko unfolds in flashback
as Dr. Kennedy, an otherwise kind and generous physician,
recounts his memories to a patient he is treating for
gangrene.  Miss Swaffer (Kathy Bates) motivates the story,
asking the doctor why he is so resentful of Amy, especially
since Swaffer has been so compassionate toward the
unhappy woman.</P>
<P>   The story unfolds.  After Amy washes the hands of feet of
her Slavic visitor, Yanko goes to work on Mr. Swaffer's (Joss
Ackland) land without pay, a virtual slave, while Amy
continues her domestic services to the Swaffer family as an
indentured servant.  Both Amy and Yanko are treated with
scorn by the neighbors.  Because Amy's mother, Mary (Zoe
Wanamaker) and her father Isaac (Tom Bell) want little to do
with their daughter, Amy retaliates by speaking not a word,
taking refuge in silence and convincing the town thereby that
she is retarded.  Similarly Yanko, who speaks no English, is
considered obtuse, until one day he dazzles Dr. Kennedy with
some sharp moves on the chess board.  Kennedy teaches the
stranger English while he is taught chess by the Russian
expert, but as Yanko's attachment to Amy grows, Kennedy
becomes strangely resentful.</P>
<P>   "Swept from the Sea" is the sort of romance that could
bring the more sentimental members of an audience to tears
but what gives it a modern feel is its treatment of the age-old
theme of hatred based on cultural differences.  Amy and
Yanko are both outsiders, she because of her refusal to mix
into the society, he simply because he is a foreigner.  Looked
upon with utter disdain by the rural folk, Yanko is unable even
to participate in church services, and wonders why the people
of this Cornish community are so hard.  What he never quite
understands is that while the residents reject Amy as well,
they will defend "her interests" because she is at least one of
them.  The treatment of class and caste keeps makes the
movie feel alive, never parched and made to feel like a
"classic," while some solid acting grasps our attention.</P>
<P>  Rachel Weisz, known to moviegoers principally for her title
role in "Tom and Viv," comes across as an actress with a
difference.  Her eyes focus in a fixed stare on the stranger,
and the romantic glow which is present from the start gives
them the glassy appearance of sight corrected by contact
lenses.  Her outwardly prim demeanor is contrasted by
Vincent Perez's look of untamed abandon, the behavior of the
two meeting in some middle ground as Yanko adapts to this
"civilized" world and Amy becomes emotionally unfettered. 
Sir Ian McKellen is superb as the mild-mannered physician
who makes house calls--even in drenching downpours--whose
one weakness seems his inability to accept the romantic
involvement of the lovers.  "Swept by the Sea," a minor work
by one of England's greatest novelists, should serve to bring
that writer the extra attention he deserves.  Rated PG-13. 
Running Time: 115 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
