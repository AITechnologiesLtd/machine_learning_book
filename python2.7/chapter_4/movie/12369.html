<PRE>Woo (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The title of the comedy Woo is a lie.  Taking its name from its party girl
protagonist, this sporadically amusing lark seems less concerned with Woo
than the more oddball characters and situations circling her.</P>
<P>Woo roughly fits the bill of a romantic comedy, and this angle of the film
holds some promise.  Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith), a fiery, independent young
woman who is fixed up on a blind date with square paralegal Tim (Tommy
Davidson) by her cousin Claudette's (Paula Jai Parker) boyfriend Lenny
(Dave Chappelle).  The conflict between Woo's free-spirited, partying ways
and the conservatism of the "stuffy" Tim leads to one long, disaster- and
embarrassment-filled night for the both of them--but mostly for Tim, of
course.  In general, the comic complications moderately amuse, but some,
like a restaurant fire that Woo inadvertently causes, crash and burn (no
pun intended).  However, all of this remains watchable, thanks to the two
appealing leads.  They have a terrific rapport, and Davidson's hilariously
high-strung, put-upon straight man manages to upstage the sexy spunk of
Pinkett Smith, who never looks less than gorgeous throughout the entire film.</P>
<P>If writer David C. Johnson and Daisy v.S. Mayer had stuck with Woo and Tim
exclusively, the film wouldn't have been great, but it would have been
better than the often meandering movie the complete Woo is.  Too often the
film becomes sidetracked by the more eccentric peripheral players, such as
Claudette, Lenny, and Tim's trio of obnoxious buddies, Frankie (Duane
Martin), Romaine (Michael Ralph), and Hop (Darrel Heath).  Claudette and
Lenny are given a raucous, raunchy showcase scene that is worth a few
laughs, but they disappear completely after that, making its necessity
questionable.  Frankie, Romaine, and Hop are funny at first, but their
broadly boorish antics grow old long before they  are shown on a side trip
at a drag club.  Completely out of place is an earnest, barely developed
subplot involving Woo's strained relationship with her brother (Dartanyan
Edmonds).  It's quite telling that the two most memorable supporting
characters only appear in one scene each: Darryl (LL Cool J), Tim's slick
ladies' man neighbor; and Crayola (Nicci Gilbert), a gossipy police
department desk clerk with an attitude problem.</P>
<P>Adding to Woo's problems is its jarringly abrupt ending.  Although I did
not particularly care for the film as a whole, I would not have minded the
additional 20 minutes or so dealing that the ending point suggests; it
would have given Woo and Tim's relationship a more satisfying and
well-rounded closure.  But perhaps that would not have been a problem if
the entire film had focused entirely on the central couple, which would
have made Woo a more satisfying and well-rounded movie.</P>
