<P>   Leo Tolstoy told us that happy families are all alike; every
unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.  While 90% of us
get married, confident that we will be in the former
category, statistics prove otherwise.  What's unfortunate in
that regard is advantageous for art, though.  Is "The Brady
Bunch" among the world's great contributions? Hardly.  Look
for dramatic excitement to "Agamemnon," "Medea,"
"Oedipus," and Hamlet, to cite a few examples. 
Dysfunctional families make for maximum enjoyment.  But
you don't have to kill your husband, your children, your uncle,
or your father to deliver an interesting story.  Sam Mendes
proves this by adapting Alan Ball's alternately funny and
poignant story, "American Beauty," to the big screen. 
Already named by some critics as one of the two Oscar
contenders (Tom Hanks's vehicle, "The Green Mile," being
the other), "American Beauty" mesmerizes because every
moment, however caricatured, hits a nerve in each of us. 
Don't tell others who have seen this film that you cannot
identify with any of the characters.  You're likely to get the
fortune-cookie reply, "You ought to get out more often."</P>
<P>   We'd like to tell our bosses where to shove their jobs, our
spouses where to hurl their demands, our parents where to
fling their uptight, middle-class values.  In "American Beauty,"
repressions, anxieties, and hostilities are played out in a
suburban neighborhood, but urban landscapes are no
strangers to dysfunction.  Among well-mown lawns and
newly-painted picket fences, though, more pressure is put
upon residents to fit in, to appear successful, to have happy
marriages, to get with the program.  And so suburbanites
have been reproached--justifiably or not--for having less
tolerance for differences than city people.  This notion makes
the generic American suburb the consummate setting for
"American Beauty," an ideal backdrop for its chiefly sorrowful
society which--through nominally tidy lawns and lives and
spirits-sodden socials try to imprint their triumphs on their
acquaintances.</P>
<P>   Foremost among them, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)
works in a cubicle as a media writer, but has utter contempt
for the hollow mission of his organization and disdain for the
company higher-ups and for the people he contacts each
day.  Nor is his home life the escape-hatch so promoted by
the psychological pap that passes for profound professional
literature.  His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), an every-hair-
in-place real-estate agent, is frustrated to the point of tears
because of her inability to sell houses.  Her envy of the
flourishing "king of real estate," Buddy Kane (Peter
Gallagher), will prompt her to suck up to this alpha male in
more than a figurative manner.  </P>
<P>   Her parents' disappointments are easily perceived by their
teen-aged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), whose best
friend Angela (Mena Suvari) considers Jane's father a freak
but whose secret admirer Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is so
without cynicism that he sees beauty in everything.  Though
physically and psychologically abused at home by his ex-
Marine father, Col. Fitts (Chris Cooper), Ricky is so enthralled
by the world's resplendence that he carefully photographs
all that he considers divine--people, swirling leaves and
papers, even a dead bird, amassing a library of videotapes
whose subject could well be American Beauty.</P>
<P>   While director Sam Mendes ponders the town's
relationships--the colonel with his son and his clinically
depressed wife Barbara (Allison Janney); the daughter with
her parents, her sexy best friend Angela, and her boy friend
Ricky; Carolyn with her husband and her new lover, Buddy--
the focal point is Lester Burnham's connection with himself. 
And what an awesome job Mendes does with this fellow! 
Carefully and humorously developing Lester's cynicism,
disappointments, and flat-out numbness, Mendes shows what
happens when at the age of 42 Lester awakens from his
extended coma, laying his eyes on the seductive teen
cheerleader, Angela.  Lester's rush recalls Dr. Bill
Maplewood's attraction to the 11-year-old Billy in Todd
Solondz's "Happiness" and Humbert Humbert's for Lolita in
the Nabokov novel, brought back to cinematic life last year by
Adrian Lyne.  With Angela as catalyst for change, Lester
determines to shuck off his paunch by working out until he
develops awesome abs, to express himself in the most
intemperate ways to his boss, his wife and his daughter, and
to try at his stage of mid-life to restore the joy and laughter
and abandon he experienced in his youth.  His resolve, while
admirable in some ways, is financially irresponsible and
psychologically is little more than important rage.  But what is
more trenchant is that he is too late.  Henri Etienne was on
the money when he said in 1594 "Si jeunesse savait, si
vieillesse pouvait," or, "If youth but knew, if age but could."</P>
<P>   Thrilling acting by Kevin Spacey, one of America's greatest
performers, should assure him an Oscar nomination.  Unfairly
edged out the Tony award competition for his dazzling
performance as Hickey in Broadway's "The Iceman Cometh,"
Spacey sets a new standard here by his facility in switching
gears, in turning from a narrator who is alternately
side-splitting, self-deprecatory, seething, sexy, and sensitive. 
Annette Bening in the less-developed and implausibly over-
the-top role is a suitable butt for Spacey's rage, Chris Cooper
as the stereotypical former Marine who cannot get used to
the "ex" in his title, and Wes Bentley as the half-freaky, half-
responsive connoisseur of American beauty are all on target.
Yet Spacey carries the show.  "It's just stuff and it's become
more important to you than life," he protests to his
materialistic wife, who is more concerned about spilling a
drink on the $4000 sofa than showing physical affection for
her husband.  Lest we get carried away by his newly-found
contempt for money, we must realize how much he grooves
on the old Pontiac Firebird he has just acquired and how
important Ricky's $40,000 is if he is going to continue finding
life as beautiful as he has felt it to be in the past. </P>
<P>   Most of the world's people do not live in capacious
suburban homes with picket fences for decoration and
Golden Retrievers to greet them when they get home.  Two-
thirds of humanity live in the tar-paper shacks, wooden
shanties, and the like.  Should we dismiss the woes of the
comfortably situated as mere bourgeois inconveniences that
can be solved by a few affordable sessions on the couch? 
Of course not.  I've read of privileged, attractive and talented
high-school students who shoot up their classmates and
stockbrokers who kill their wives.  I've seen dirt-poor, unclad
kids in southern India playing on the beaches, sporting broad,
authentic smiles that I see less often on the faces of
American children.  The Greek tragedians, in fact, seemed to
believe that only the rich and powerful could truly suffer.  I
challenge you to see "American Beauty" without feeling great
compassion for the anguish of its well-situated people, whose
laughter and good times do not always erase their anguish
and distress.  The performances led by Kevin Spacey, the
capable direction by Sam Mendes backed up by Conrad
Hall's eye behind the camera, and Thomas Newman's
pulsating soundtrack, all position the film for a flurry of year-
end awards.  I'd be hard-put to recall another movie (certainly
not Ang Lee's detached and clinical "The Ice Storm") that has
so skillfully integrated exuberant humor with heartbreaking
pathos.</P>
