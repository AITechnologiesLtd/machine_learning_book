<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>Former schoolteacher, Cora Texeira [Fernanda Montenegro] earns money by
writing letters at $1.00 each for the multitude of illiterate people who
pass by her makeshift table in Central Station.  At night she and her girl
friend, Irene [Marilia Pera] entertain themselves by reading and judging
the importance of the contents.  Most end up, unsent, in the trash, while
a few are placed in a drawer for later posting.</P>
<P>Cora's life changes when Ava [Soia Lira] and her son, Josue [Vinisius de
Oliveira] stop by Cora's table to write a letter to the boy's father. 
When Ana is accidentally killed Cora finds a suppressed maternal instinct
emerging at times.  She helps Josue while trying at the same time, to
distance herself from him.  She ‘sells' him to an adoption service, but
when she discovers that they intend to kill him for his organs she rescues
him and they find themselves on the lam.</P>
<P>The low regard for life and the hardships of the people are dramatically
shown.  When a young man steals a small item from a Central Station shop,
he is chased and caught.  Despite his pleading he is shot and killed.</P>
<P>The trains that service Central Station are hot and crowded.  As an empty
train pulls into the station some passengers board through the windows,
dropping into the few available seats.</P>
<P>But, through the desperation that is seen we get a glimpse of the hope
that lies ahead for Brazil.  When Cora and Josue reach the developing area
to the north, there are rows and rows of tract houses being built and
there is one paved street.  These meager buildings aren't much but they
are a vast improvement over the alternatives available.</P>
<P>Foreign films with subtitles are a bit difficult to watch but, like `Life
is Beautiful' this film is definitely worth the effort.  Ms. Montenegro
has been nominated for the Best Actress Oscar.  She deserves the
nomination.  Her portrayal will stay with you for a very long time.  I
must see this movie again.  I give it a B+.</P>
