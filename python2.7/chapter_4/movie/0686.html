                                 ALWAYS
                       A film review by Laurie Mann
                        Copyright 1989 Laurie Mann</PRE>
<PRE>     In a word, WOW!</PRE>
<P>     There's something very special about a Steven Spielberg movie starring
Richard Dreyfuss.  Dreyfuss tends to give some of his more thoughtful work, and
Spielberg tends to give him pretty interesting roles.  ALWAYS, which sounds a
lot like an old escapist movie (and is, in fact, based on "A Guy Called Joe")
is just a wonderful, engrossing movie.  A solid 8 on the movie scale.</P>
<P>     The story is simple---a pilot who fights fires is killed and is called by
Hap (Audrey Hepburn) to be the guardian angel of a fire pilot in training.
Before Pete (Dreyfuss) is killed off, there are some terrific fire-fighting
scenes, and a long, rowdy night in a bar as we follow Pete, his lover Dorinda
(Holly Hunt), and their friend Al (John Goodman).  The chemistry between
Dreyfuss and Hunt is great.</P>
<P>     Talking plot in a movie like this is pretty meaningless.  What counts are
the performances and they are uniformly wonderful.  Goodman continues to be the
ultimate support man, and is very powerful when he's angry.  Hunter, Dreyfuss,
and Brad Johnson (an incredible hunk (who wears glasses even!)  who plays the
new fire pilot) are great.  The fire-fighting scenes are very exciting.  The
ending was so engrossing that I completely stopped hearing an annoying alarm
that was going off in the theater until the credits rolled.</P>
<PRE>     In short, GO SEE IT!</PRE>
