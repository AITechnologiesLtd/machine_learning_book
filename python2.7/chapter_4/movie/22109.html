<PRE>                            BICENTENNIAL MAN
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Robin Williams wants -- and needs -- nothing more than to have his
own THE TRUMAN SHOW -- a Hail Mary to ward off permanent stereotyping.
Typecast as a goofy loudmouth in throwaway films ranging from MRS.
DOUBTFIRE to FATHER'S DAY to FLUBBER, you have to look back all the way
to THE FISHER KING in 1991 for his last great starring role.</P>
<P>     BICENTENNIAL MAN aims to turn that all around by making Williams
something we can relate to once again.  Ironically, that's not as a
human:  It's as a robot.</P>
<P>     As the robotic Andrew, Williams starts out his life in 2005 San
Francisco as a run-of-the-mill android with an unexplained glitch that
makes him able to experience emotions and gives him creativity.  Andrew
then embarks on a 200-year quest to discover the nature of humanity,
absorbing lessons on art, freedom, love, and ultimately mortality.  (In
other words, the same problems Williams was dealing with in "Mork &
Mindy.")</P>
<P>     It's an ambitious movie and it positively sprawls at close to 2 1/2
hours in length.  Audiences expecting that Robin slapstick are going to
be sorely mistaken.  As a robot, Andrew's only laughs come from his
unintentional mangling of jokes and turns of the phrase like "Swine
Lake."</P>
<P>     No, they're not exactly belly laughs.  And while BICENTENNIAL MAN
is indeed a thoughtful drama with excellent production values, it's
clearly lacking in a number of subtle ways.  Most annoying is the
plastic utopia that the film-world becomes, complete with (of course)
flying cars, metallic skyscrapers, and all-white hospital interiors.
San Francisco, one of the most crowded cities in the country, appears to
be an oasis -- everyone's apartment is enormous -- I wish!  In 2205, I
don't expect the world's foremost concern will be wrestling over the
question, Are robots human?</P>
<P>     But my main criticism of the film is that its protagonist is
obviously *not* a robot but is actually Robin Williams.  Jim Carrey
convinced us that he was Truman Burbank, and he convinced me that he was
Andy Kaufman, too.  Robin Williams does not convince you that he is
anything other than Robin Williams.  It's just a milder version of
himself.  It's DEAD POETS SOCIETY Robin.</P>
<P>     Despite its flaws, BICENTENNIAL MAN is imminently watchable, and on
the whole it's a good time.  Just don't expect a life-altering
experience to be had.  But do expect to see Williams back to his old
song and dance again next year.</P>
