<P> If "Idle Hands," the new horror-comedy directed with devilish glee by 
 Rodman Flender ("Leprechaun 2"), has it's fair share of problems, which 
 it does, you'll just have to excuse me for not mentioning some of them. 
 First and foremost, this film was an extremely nostalgic experience for 
 me, a fun and twisted throwback to the goofy slasher films of the '80s. 
 Last year's crummy "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" was also 
 exactly like '80s horror, but was tiresome and had no true entertainment 
 value. In other words, "I Still Know..." took itself way too seriously, 
 and therefore suffered the consequences, while "Idle Hands" knows 
 exactly how to have a good time, be damned. </P>
<P> The film gets off to a fabulous start, as a kooky middle-aged married 
 couple (Fred Willard, Connie Ray) have just settled down for the night. 
 Seeing the words, "I'm under the bed," sprawled on the ceiling, they 
 immediately hear a noise downstairs. The husband goes down to check it 
 out, and never returns. Then she goes down to see where he is. You know 
 the procedure, but instead of feeling cliched, the scene is both 
 genuinely suspenseful and had me rolling in the aisles at its already 
 over-the-top, sick humor. </P>
<P> The next morning, we meet 17-year-old slacker Anton Tobias (Devon Sawa), 
 a clueless teenager who spends his days loafing on the couch watching 
 television and smoking marijuana. After not seeing his parents for a 
 couple days, he tells his friends, Mick (Seth Green) and Pnub (Elden 
 Henson), but doesn't really think anything of it. After accidentally 
 discovering their bodies (whose location in the house will remain unsaid 
 so the surprise will be kept), Anton quickly discovers that his right 
 hand is possessed by Satan, and is starting to control him, killing 
 anybody in its path, including Mick and Pnub. When Anton confronts him 
 about his unfortunate situation, his dark, brooding neighbor (Jack 
 Noseworthy) remarks that, "Idle hands are the devil's playground. Just 
 keep them busy." Ultimately, the violent proceedings lead up to the 
 school's Halloween dance, in which the now-severed hand goes on a 
 murderous rampage.</P>
<P> "Idle Hands" is a delirious, no-holds-barred attempt at creating a 
 slasher movie with lots of campy and outrageous humor. While some of it 
 fails (including the whole subplot dealing with Mick and Pnub, who 
 return from the grave), much of it really is funny, and I couldn't help 
 but be reminded of the so-bad-they're-great '80s horror flicks that this 
 film obviously gets its inspiration from. Back in those days, there were 
 very few redeeming qualities, just gory killing after gore killing, 
 intermingled with a helpful dosage of gratuitous nudity. In the '90s, 
 however, things have matured a bit, there isn't quite as much blood to 
 be had in these types of movies, and there is never any t&a. With "Idle 
 Hands," this has all changed, and you would not believe how much 
 enjoyment is to be had at seeing a film like that once again, and on the 
 big screen.</P>
<P> For one thing, this film does a much better job at portraying Halloween 
 (my favorite holiday) than the self-titled "Halloween: H20," and the 
 very first shot in the film is an instant classic (at least for me), as 
 the camera starts on a brightly-lit pumpkin and then pans through a 
 heavily Halloween-decorated yard, and into an upstairs window. Due to 
 this example and several other impressively-shot scenes, the 
 cinematography is distinctive and well-done, as is the memorable music 
 score by composer Graeme Revell.</P>
<P> Once Anton's hand is possessed, "Idle Hands" unfortunately begins to 
 meander with an overemphasis on slapstick, but once the hands is cut off 
 and it sets out for the dance in the last thirty minutes, the movie 
 returns to its high-energy mode and is a treat from there on. The rock 
 band, "Offspring," makes an appropriate cameo at the dance as they sing 
 the Ramones songs, "I Wanna Be Sedated," while nubile teens are 
 dispatched of in gruesome ways, and two particular girls, one of which 
 is Anton's new girlfriend, Molly (Jessica Alba), must escape through the 
 ventilation system and crawl through a sharp, spinning fan that has been 
 stopped up (but for how long?) by a shoe. </P>
<P> In the central roles, Devon Sawa is an adequate protagonist who is given 
 plenty of opportunity to show off his talent (or lack thereof) of 
 physical comedy. Seth Green and Elden Henson have some fun with their 
 respective roles, especially after they have been killed (with Mick 
 having a beer bottle engouged in his forehead, and Pnub actually 
 carrying around his severed head). Jessica Alba is nice eye candy, in a 
 ditsy female sort of way, but as was so evident in the older slasher 
 movies, is a one-dimensional damsel-in-distress. Finally, Vivica A. Fox 
 is hysterical in the smallish role of Deb, a spicy Druid priestess who 
 sets out to find the possessed hand.</P>
<P> "Idle Hands" is bloody, violent, dumb, and shallow, but it also boosts 
 some clever ideas amidst the rising body count. It may not be a great 
 movie, but it's one of the most amusing times I've had at the multiplex 
 this whole year.</P>
