FROM HERE TO ETERNITY
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Hollywood was always treating film as an industry, but these
days its products are becoming increasingly predictable. Few
words about plot, names of the people involved and years of
viewing experience - all that can enable you to predict
general outlook and the overall quality of the movie. PEARL
HARBOR, newest action spectacle by Jerry Bruckheimer and
Michael Bay, is the latest example, being mercilessly
badmouthed even before the principal photography began. One
of the reasons for such campaign is the fact that the film
deals with the historical event already covered by Hollywood
in previous decades. In two cases, such coverage produced
classic films, awarded with "Oscars", and Bruckheimer is
going to have huge problems matching their quality. While in
the case of TORA! TORA! TORA! his project has some realistic
chances of being better (at least in special effects
department), only the bravest could predict PEARL HARBOR
being in serious competition with FROM HERE TO ETERNITY,
1953 drama by Fred Zinnemann. This film was awarded with
eight "Oscars", and its reputation of Hollywood classics was
never in doubt, not even after few uninspired television
remakes in 1970s and 1980s.</P>
<P>FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is based on the best-selling novel by
James Jones, American author deeply influenced by his own
experiences in US military at the Pacific Theatre in WW2.
The plot is set in 1941, at the time when USA was still out
of war. Young US Army private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (played
by Montgomery Clift), former bugler, has been transferred
into infantry unit, Company G. Its commander, Captain Holmes
(played by Philip Ober) is boxing coach and he wants
Prewitt, soldier with reputation of good middle-weight
boxer, to fight in regimental boxing team; good results in
boxing competition would ensure Holmes' promotion. Prewitt,
deeply traumatised by the boxing accident that had left his
friend blinded, is adamant that he wouldn't fight; Holmes
responds by ordering his NCOs to make Prewitt's life in
company miserable and thus make him to change his mind. The
only NCO that doesn't take part in intimidation campaign is
Sergeant Warden (played by Burt Lancaster), experienced,
tough but fair career soldier who actually runs the company.
Warden, however, has some flaws - one of them is lust
towards Karen Holmes (played by Deborah Kerr), beautiful
wife of Captain Holmes. He starts relationship with her,
despite her reputation of "easy lay" and despite risking 20
years of military prison for adulterous affair with
superior's wife. In the meantime, Prewitt is introduced to
New Congress "social club" by his friend Private Maggio
(played by Frank Sinatra) and there he falls in love with
Alma a.k.a. Lorene (played by Donna Reed), one of the
"hostesses". Their romance, as well as the destiny of all
protagonists, would be affected with incoming Japanese raid
on Pearl Harbor.</P>
<P>FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was considered great in its time
because it, among other things, dealt with some
uncomfortable subjects previously ignored in Hollywood.
Although screenwriter Daniel Taradash (later awarded with
"Oscar" for his effort) took great pains to tone down or
edit out all questionable material from 800-page book, the
content of the film still looks brave for its time, breaking
taboos by depicting the serial adultery, prostitution,
rampant alcoholism and showing US military to be infested
with corruption and incompetence. Because of that, producers
were denied co-operation by US Army during the production,
which was the first such incident in Hollywood-US military
relations after WW2. The depiction of US Army in this film,
as well as in the novel, is unflattering but historically
accurate. Because of the widespread isolationist sentiments
and notion of country being safe from invasion, US Army in
the first years of WW2, unlike the Navy and Marines, was
neglected - small, made out of soldiers who had enlisted
only to escape poverty and never expected to earn their
living in actual fighting, inexperienced and under-equipped
in comparison with other great military powers of the time.
When stationed in tropical tourist paradise, like the
protagonist of this film, US military succumbed to hedonism
and war came as really nasty surprise that made such
shortcomings quite obvious.</P>
<P>The film, however, deals more with the shortcomings of
characters than with the shortcomings of the institutions as
a whole. Actually, FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, like any good
drama, doesn't feature perfect characters - almost any of
them is affected with an affliction or character flaw. In
order to portray that, Zinnemann had to rely on really good
actors, and FROM HERE TO ETERNITY was blessed with great
acting talent. Montgomery Clift is grand as Private Prewitt,
character whose pride and conviction, instead of being
virtue, turns out to be the source of doom for him. That
doom could be foreshadowed by the almost always-painful
expression on Clift's face - his character, even when he
looks happy, is constantly bothered with something. Burt
Lancaster plays character that requires less acting ability,
and more of his personal charisma; he is good acting choice
for Sergeant Warden, though, since that character, despite
being affected with unhealthy lust towards woman legally out
of his reach, is the closest to the criteria of the
conventional Hollywood hero. Those criteria are later met
when Warden in the end of the film chooses duty (and Army as
surrogate family) over marriage with Karen. Deborah Kerr is
also great since the inner pains of her character provide
good contrast with her physical attractiveness. The most
interesting female role belongs to Donna Reed, who plays
character very different from those who would later make her
icons of 1950s values. The most memorable acting job was, of
course, given by excellent Frank Sinatra in "Oscar"-awarded
role of Private Maggio; his character, which initially looks
like some kind of comic relief, later underlines the
pessimistic, depressing atmosphere of the film with its
tragic fate. Ernest Borgnine is also great in the memorable
role of sadistic Sergeant "Fatso" Judson.</P>
<P>FROM HERE TO ETERNITY is a film that relies heavily on
well-developed characters and superb actors playing them.
Zinnemann focused film around them, and although his work in
that regard was superb - especially the way he handles
parallels between two movie romances - film is not visually
attractive enough to be considered true masterpiece. Few
action scenes in the end are well- done, as well as famous
romantic beach scene (now overcliched, and very brave and
erotic for its time), but the film is hurt by the use of
black-and-white photography. Use of colour, together with
more shots of the Hawaii countryside, would have provided
effective contrast between heaven outside setting and hell
inside movie's troubled protagonists. On the other hand,
that lack of attraction won't prevent FROM HERE TO ETERNITY
to remain true classic and very high standard for all future
films dealing with Pearl Harbor.</P>
