<PRE>                                 ALICE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>**1/2</PRE>
<P>        Woody Allen goes into a weird wonderland in this 
fantasy romance starring Mia Farrow, in her eleventh consecutive 
Allen film. Here, she plays a disenchanted housewife who has lived 
off her husband's money without ever having lived a life of her own. 
Thoughts of independence begin to pop into her head under 
hypnosis at the office of Dr. Wang, a radical Chinese (although 
you'd never know it from the name) healer who prescribes herbs 
and diagnoses through the pulse.</P>
<P>        Wang gives her several batches of herbs that further 
along her contemplations of an affair with Joe Mantegna. The 
first make her lose all inhibitions and become overly flirtatious 
with Mantegna, going so far as to set up a rendezvous at the zoo 
(that rhymes) that she doesn't show up for when the drugs wear 
off and she becomes her mousy self again. The second make her 
invisible (Shortly after ALICE came out, invisibility drugs became 
available over the counter.), so she can listen in on Mantegna's 
comments about her. And the third bring on the apparition of a 
dead ex-boyfriend (Alec Baldwin), who advises her to pursue 
the affair.</P>
<P>        The herbs aren't without their negative effects. Mia finds 
herself lying to her husband (William Hurt, who is more than a little 
hurt by the news of the affair) and discovers her friends' (including 
backstabbing TV executive Cybil Shepherd) true feelings about her. 
As with every Woody Allen movie, the ending brings on a lot of 
learning for its main character through painful events (very much 
like the far-superior THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO). Along the 
way, ALICE suffers from an overdose of charm, melodrama and 
forced substance. It's more than a little ironic that a man who is 
normally so laughable for the right reasons once in awhile makes 
movies that are laughable for the wrong reasons.</P>
