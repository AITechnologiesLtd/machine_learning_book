<PRE>RUNAWAY BRIDE
RATING: 5.5 / 10 --> Not good enough to recommend</PRE>

<P>Maybe I'm just a bigger fan of the original films that spawned the latest
batch of romantic comedies, YOU'VE GOT MAIL (5.5/10)-see SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE, NOTTING HILL (5.5/10)-see FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, and RUNAWAY
BRIDE (5.5/10)-see PRETTY WOMAN, but ultimately, I just found the most
recent crop of big-name star flicks to be too predictable and generally
uninteresting.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A cynical big city reporter finds a good story in a small town girl's
penchant for dropping her soon-to-be hubbies at the altar.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This film never bored me, but never really entertained me either. It was
just there. I can't truly recommend it because despite some good
performances from Julia Roberts and Joan Cusack, the overall comedy in the
film was lacking and the romance didn't truly ignite until the film's final
fifteen minutes. Richard Gere also seemed bored to be there, and essentially
walked through his role and directly to the bank to cash in his big-ass
paycheck for this redundant part. Others seemed exaggerated and unbelievably
ignorant to believe (Why on earth was husband #4 so chummy with the
conniving reporter who was in town solely to disprove their real love for
one another?).</P>
<P>The general lack of suspense or believability of this film also left me
ho-humming past its overstated soundtrack, which featured easy-to-follow
words associated to the specific scenes, and the overdone montage sequences
which are generally used to pump up a weak script. I did enjoy Joan Cusack
as the quirky friend and some of the lessons learned, but overall this film
lacked the much needed charisma and chemistry that made PRETTY WOMAN what it
was. This film is a much better choice as video fodder on a lazy summer
afternoon, and might be enjoyed by most Gere and Roberts fans, but the rest
of us movie-going folk who like to see movies with plenty of romance, comedy
and charm, should certify this film as bride's maid, and check out the
ultimate bride, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (10/10).</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Rumor has it that Julia Roberts was once a "runaway bride" of her own. Actor
Kiefer Sutherland and her were engaged to be married back in the day, when
she suddenly bolted on him, and left him for fellow actor and friend, Jason
Patric.
Richard Gere has been a Buddhist for over a decade, and was banned from the
Oscars once after making anti-China comments on the air at the 1993
ceremony. He is also an accomplished pianist and music writer. He hails from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Alumni from PRETTY WOMAN include director Garry Marshall, actors Julia
Roberts, Richard Gere, Hector Elizondo and Larry Miller. Elizondo is
considered by director/producer Garry Marshall to be his "good luck charm",
and as such is offered a role in each of his movies.
Director Marshall also makes a cameo in this film as the first baseman
during the baseball game sequence. He would be the one catching the ball
that is tossed over to first base.
Actress Rita Wilson is married to super-star movie actor Tom Hanks.
This film was originally titled PRETTY BRIDE.</P>
