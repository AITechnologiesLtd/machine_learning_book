<PRE>THE BIG ONE (1997) 
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia 
October 16th, 2001 </PRE>
<P>"The Big One" is a pleasurable comedy, masquerading as a documentary, focusing
on Michael Moore's attempts to focus on the truth surrounding the layoffs in
Michigan and around the United States. We see unemployed people barking at
Michael Moore and at the cameras about their poverty, Borders Bookstore
employees complaining about tax cuts on their paychecks, a woman crying to Moore
at one of his booksignings about her inability to find work, and the penultimate
moment when Moore confronts the Nike chairman and asks him why people in Mexico
are working for 80 cents an hour. </P>
<P>"The Big One" has lots of scattered moments of truth, and plenty of it is just
hearsay - the scene where the workers yell to Moore is obviously staged. I
enjoyed the scenes where Moore and his video crew enter places of business and
are threatened to leave, or when he gives some associates and bigwigs a big, fat
check for 80 cents to the Mexican workers because "we want to help them out."
All of this will be very familiar to anyone who's seen "Roger and Me" or his TV
series "TV Nation." </P>
<P>Moore has a lot of good arguments about what's happening to hard workers around
the country who work for candy companies or GM - if these corporations are
making so much money, why are there so many layoffs? One word: competition, so
they can be ahead of the others. That is why they pay so little to Mexican
vagrants or children in Mexico and other countries - it is cheap labor for
maximum profit. And then there are the airline workers who make flight
reservations - nothing unusual about that except some of them are prisoners! </P>
<P>"The Big One" is very funny throughout and is more tightly edited than "Roger
and Me." Moore could have a career as a comedian if he wants it, but he is after
bigger game - to expose the truth through nuggets of humor. Some may say he is
just exploiting the workers he's documenting. I would say he's exploiting the
exploiters. </P>
