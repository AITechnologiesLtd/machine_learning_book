<P>Midway through "American Beauty," a young man obsessed with videotaping 
asks a new friend if she'd like to see the most beautiful thing he ever 
filmed. He shows her a video of an empty plastic grocery sack caught in a 
breeze. With a brick wall behind it and a leaf-strewn sidewalk below, the 
bag dances in the wind; darting, fluttering, almost touching the ground, 
only to be swept up again to continue its herky-jerky aerial ballet. The 
image is mesmerizing and neatly underscores the film's central theme: 
look closer. </P>
<P>Silky, seductive and unsettling, "American Beauty" is an dazzling piece 
of movie-making, nimbly shifting from dark comedy to drama to horror to 
pure poetry and back again. While its examination of what lies beneath 
the well-manicured facade of suburban life is nothing new ("The Ice Storm,
" "Happiness" and "Blue Velvet" are just a few of the works that have 
covered similar turf), the film's nervy script and remarkably assured 
approach, coupled with flawless cinematography and use of music, yields 
numerous rewards all its own. </P>
<P>The story begins with a shot of a red door, accompanied by a voice-over 
introduction from lead character Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). "I'm 42 
years old," he quietly intones. "In less than a year, I'll be dead. Of 
course, I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead already." Indeed he is. 
For years, Lester has gone through life on cruise control. He cohabits a 
house with his high-strung wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening) and sullen 
daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) in an atmosphere of simmering animosity. His 
job as a writer for a dull media publication hangs by a thread. Most of 
the time he is numb. "I know I've lost something," he says, "but I don't 
know what it is." One thing he does know is that he didn't always feel 
this sedated.</P>
<P>It's easy to toss around phrases like "mid-life crisis," but actually 
experiencing the phenomena is another matter entirely. Dealing with the 
prospect of one's own mortality, while realizing that the vitality of 
life has been smothered by day-to-day routine and the Quixotic quest for 
the illusion of security, is absolutely devastating. From the inside, a 
mid-life crisis is a Herculean struggle for survival of the soul that can 
lead a person to some pretty strange behavior.  </P>
<P>Two events trigger Lester's peculiar epiphany: the loss of his job and 
his infatuation with a gorgeous high school girl. At a cheerleading 
demonstration, he falls head over heels in lust for his daughter's best 
friend, Angela (Mena Suvani). Determined to seduce her, he starts pumping 
iron with a vengeance (she likes tight pecs), striving to recapture the 
appearance and passion of his youth.</P>
<P>Informed by his boss that his services will no longer be needed, Lester 
blackmails the man into giving him a big severance package. Freed of his 
job and financial concerns, he launches into a giddy joyride of 
irresponsibility. Remembering his carefree youthful days at a fast-food 
joint, Lester takes a job flipping burgers at Mr. Smiley. He smokes dope 
openly while cruising around town in his new dream car, begins speaking 
with devastating frankness and adopts an impulsive approach to life. </P>
<P>The new Lester leaves his wife horrified and his daughter disgusted. 
Carolyn focuses desperately on her work as a real estate agent, while 
eyeing Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), known in realty circles as "The King.
" Jane hooks up with a strange new neighbor kid, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who 
deals dope, videotapes everything and constantly ducks from his severe 
drill-instructor of a father (Chris Cooper) and near-catatonic mother 
(Allison Janney). The tension within this circle of humanity is palpable 
and an explosion is clearly imminent. </P>
<P>Kevin Spacey anchors the swirl of conflict with the best performance of 
his already stellar career. As Lester changes from repressed sardonic 
loser to freewheeling overage kid, Spacey is stunning, totally inhabiting 
the character. Despite his pursuit of an underage girl, you care for this 
man caught up in the heady euphoria of living without a safety net.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" navigates a fine line, creating stereotypes for the 
social satire, then humanizing the players for the drama. It doesn't 
always work. A great effort from Annette Bening manages to make Carolyn 
more than a materialist cliché, but even an actor of Chris Cooper's skill 
cannot turn Ricky's militaristic father into more than an evil cartoon. </P>
<P>The film's biggest misstep comes with a kiss late in the proceedings. 
Intended as a revelation, the kiss is too easy a shock, playing like a 
page out of Psych 101. Understand, though, that I'm nit-picking. Even 
with its flaws, "American Beauty" is a whale of a movie. More than 
anything, it provokes thought and reflection, something that happens all 
too rarely in contemporary cinema. The film is similar to a Rorschach 
Test. How you react to this compelling, ambitious creation could reveal a 
bit about your place in this amazing corporeal journey we share. Look 
closer.</P>
