<P>     It's the film so daring that it earned a rare NC-17 rating!  It's the
film so controversial that Universal Pictures, the parent company of
October Films, forced October to create a separate releasing arm to
distance itself from the film!  It's the film so outrageous that only
Trey Parker, the bad-boy co-creator of "South Park," could have brought
it to you!  It's ORGAZMO, a film destined for midnight movie immortality!</P>
<P>     They say there's no such thing as bad publicity...unless you're a
potential film viewer who pays attention to it.  Anyone expecting naughty,
edgy fun from ORGAZMO might find that its most shocking surprise is how
uninspired much of its "outrageousness" is.  Sure, it hits two guaranteed
hot-buttons -- religion and sex -- in this tale of a naive Mormon lad
named Joe Young (played by Parker himself) serving a mission in Los
Angeles.  One day he knocks on the wrong door, and ends up on the set of
porno film director Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs).  Impressed by 
Joe's martial arts skills when he fends off a group of bodyguards, Orbison
offers Joe the lead role of Captain Orgazmo (physical stunts only, no sex
required), along with a huge paycheck which will allow Joe and his fiancee
Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab) to marry in the Salt Lake City temple and live
well.  Oh, and Joe also becomes a _real_ crime-fighting super-hero who
uses a high-tech weapon to paralyze adversaries with intense sexual
pleasure.</P>
<P>     Occasionally, it looks like Parker is going to take this story on
just the right avenue of absurdity.  The film-within-the-film "Orgazmo"
turns out to be a crossover smash hit, ranking third on the all-time box
office chart and naturally creating demand for a sequel.  Then there's the
odd little aside in which Joe's film sidekick Ben (Dian Bachar) re-lives a
painful childhood memory of giving up "hamster style" martial arts, and a
cameo appearance by a certain heavenly personage.  There are a few amusing
gags sprinkled throughout ORGAZMO, many aimed at the absurdity of adult
film "plot" scenarios when they're not taking broad shots at Utah or the
Latter-Day Saints.</P>
<P>     The problem with Parker's sense of humor is that it can be terribly
lazy.  His favorite set-up involves wacky character incongruities which
actually lost most of their wackiness many iterations ago -- an old woman
swearing like a sailor, an old woman showing sexual arousal, a Japanese
sushi chef who uses hip-hop lingo.  His running gags include brilliant
innovations like a surly porno actor who passes gas in the face of others
("South Park's" Terence and Philip, eat your hearts out), and a lighting
technician (Parker's cohort Matt Stone) who begins every sentence with "I
don't want to seem like a queer or nothin'..." until eventually --
inevitably -- he actually makes a pass at another male character.  You can
see punch lines coming from several theaters away in ORGAZMO.</P>
<P>     Those who might attend just for prurient interest should also be
warned that ORGAZMO is about as tame as an NC-17 film could get.  Though
there's plenty of full-clothed grinding and prominent displays of certain
marital aids, there's nary an exposed female body part to be found (hairy
male buttocks, on the other hand, get a disturbing amount of screen time).
Make no mistake, Trey Parker's brand of offensiveness is far more
sniggering, middle-of-the-road crude than it is truly shocking.  There's
nothing wrong with the production being sloppy and amateurish; after all,
this is among other things a parody of porno films, with a wonderfully
cheesy fake explosion for a conclusion.  It's another thing when the humor
is often sloppy and amateurish...or worse yet, re-cycled.  ORGAZMO
inspires the one reaction a "daring," "controversial," "outrageous" film
can't afford:  a great big "so what?"</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 missionary positions:  5.</PRE>
