Running time: 101 minutes
(French with English subtitles).</P>
<P>Writer/director Robert Guediguian was born and raised in
Marseilles, and has an affinity for the tough working class area and
its characters.  Guediguian has set his previous films in this same
area, somehow finding beauty and inspiration in the harsh environment.
A contemporary romantic comedy about the relationship between two
middle aged people touched by tragedy, Marius And Jeannette is
Guediguian's seventh film, but the first to be released locally.</P>
<P>This enormously appealing film has no real plot to speak of,
but is driven along by its wonderful cast of characters.</P>
<P>Jeannette (beautifully played by the director's wife Ariane
Ascaride) has been scarred by tragedy all her life.  Her father died
when she was nine, and she has lost two husbands.  One died in an
accident, the other walked out on the family and never returned.
However, she has a feisty, uncompromising attitude and tackles life on
her terms.  She has raised her two children, and worked a succession
of thankless jobs to pay the bills.  Marius (Gerard Meylan) is a shy
gentle giant who works as a security guard at the local cement works,
which are being demolished to make way for new developments.  He also
carries around with him the tragic loss of a wife and two children,
although his grief has been bottled up inside.</P>
<P>This lonely and scarred pair meet after Jeannette scales a
fence at the dilapidated concrete factory to steal a couple of paint
cans.  Marius drives her away, but the next day shows up at her place
with a couple of cans and an apology for his rough attitude.  He helps
Jeannette paint the house, and a strong affection develops between the
pair.  However, they have to overcome their own personal demons before
they can be truly happy.</P>
<P>There is plenty of advice and support for Jeannette from her
eccentric ensemble of neighbours, who share a courtyard.  While this
charming obviously concentrates on the developing romance between
Marius and Jeannette, Guediguian also devotes some screen time to
exploring her colourful neighbours, who are sketched in economical
fashion.  Caroline (Pascale Roberts) is a survivor of the Nazi
concentration camps, but has a healthy appetite for life and a
generous spirit, while Justin (Jacques Boudet) is a retired teacher
who is in love with her.  Monique (Frederique Bonnal) and Dede (Jean-
Pierre Darrousin) are a married couple constantly fighting over his
radical politics.</P>
<P>But, at the heart of the film is an exploration of the healing
power of love, and how people find their own happiness despite the
hardships they encounter.  However, there are a few moments that
misfire - such as Justin's political discourses, which are largely
irrelevant, and an unusual bar room brawl.  There is also a delightful
running joke, in which Jeannette constantly encounters her former boss
forced to undertake a variety of menial jobs.</P>
<P>Guediguian always works with the same ensemble group of
actors, who bring the characters to life with compassion,
understanding and humour.  Their familiarity and easy going affinity
with his laid back style is reflected in the film's realistic and
natural style.  Meylan gives a soulful performance as the haunted
Marius, while Ascaride brings fire and verve to her role.</P>
<P>Marius And Jeannette is suffused with a generous spirit, a
relaxed charm, and a genuine sense of warmth.  Guediguian maintains a
gentle rhythm throughout.  The film's upbeat and optimistic nature
will strike a more responsive chord with audiences who found the
recent Gallic drama Dream Life Of Angels a little too bleak and grim
for their tastes.</P>
