<P>WINDHORSE (M).  
(Gil Scrine Films)
Directors: Paul Wagner and Thupten Tsering
Stars: Dadon, Jampa Kelsang, Richard Chang, Lu Yu, Taije Silverman, Gelek
Running time: 97 minutes.</P>
<P>Unlike recent big budget Hollywood productions dealing with
Tibet, the low budget Windhorse relentlessly pricks away at the
audiences' conscience by exposing the plight of the Tibetan people in
the years since the Chinese occupation.  Set in contemporary Tibet,
Windhorse shows the systematic repression and destruction of the
country's religion and culture in the forty years since the Chinese
invasion.</P>
<P>This is the first feature film from Oscar winning documentary
director Paul Wagner (The Stone Carvers, etc), but it has been largely
shaped by his years of documenting unpalatable truths for the camera.
Wagner's camera unflinchingly captures the depressing poverty of the
capital Lhasa, and depicts the many temples that have been laid to
waste.  However, the film also captures the resilient spirit and
character of the Tibetan people.  The title itself comes from the
Tibetan tradition of inscribing prayers of hope and freedom on little
bits of paper and letting them float through the air. Wagner has also
incorporated traditional Tibetan music into the evocative and haunting
soundtrack, which further enriches the film.</P>
<P>Unlike the lavish, albeit sanitised Kundun and Seven Years In
Tibet, much of Windhorse was actually clandestinely shot inside Tibet
itself, using hand held cameras smuggled into Tibet while posing as
tourists.  Wagner and his crew shot many of the important background
locations under the noses of the Chinese security forces, at great
personal risk.  (The remainder of the film was shot in nearby
Kathmandu.)  The gritty visual style gives the film a sense of urgency
and immediacy missing from those other productions.</P>
<P>Wagner paints a grim picture of contemporary Tibet, one in
which the people are constantly watched by the vigilant Chinese, who
ruthlessly suppress any hint of rebellion or dissension.  Images of
the Dalai Lama are forbidden, and the consequences for protest or
disobedience are severe.  In the past four decades, over one million
Tibetans have mysteriously disappeared, or been tortured, murdered or
exiled by the Chinese secret police.</P>
<P>Windhorse centres around three twenty something Tibetans who
have thus far managed to survive in this dangerous climate by avoiding
any sort of conflict with the Chinese authorities.  Eighteen years
earlier the three witnessed the brutal execution of their grandfather
by the Chinese.  Although the incident has left deep psychological
scars, they have come to believe that any thoughts of resistance are
futile.  Dolkar (Tibetan singer Dadon) sings karaoke in a night-club,
and eventually secures a recording contract singing propaganda for her
Chinese masters.  Her unemployed brother Dorjee (Jampa Kolsangi) is
resentful of the Chinese, but refuses to join the underground
resistance movement.  Their cousin Pema has become a nun.  But when
Pema is arrested for daring to protest against the Chinese occupation
in a market, Dolkar and Dorjee are finally forced to take action that
will forever change their lives.</P>
<P>Windhorse is a confronting, powerfully moving and insightful
film that boldly and openly criticises the harsh Chinese regime.
Wagner and his co-director Thupten Tsering used a cast and crew
comprising of Tibetan exiles, many of whom have withheld their names
from the production for fear of Chinese reprisals.  This gives a
poignancy to their natural and realistic performances, and further
adds to the overall feeling of authenticity that permeates the film.</P>
<P>However, the film is not without its technical flaws, most of
them a result of Wagner's lack of resources.</P>
