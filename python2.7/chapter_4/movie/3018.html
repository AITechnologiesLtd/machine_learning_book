<PRE>                                  LOVE AFFAIR
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Garry Shandling, Katharine
Hepburn, Pierce Brosnan, Kate Capshaw.
Screenplay:  Warren Beatty and Robert Towne.
Director:  Glenn Gordon Caron.</P>
<P>     Making an old-fashioned romance isn't as easy as it might look.
While films from this year like IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU and ONLY YOU
attempted to re-create the magic of bygone love stories, they succeeded
primarily in creating cloying pseudo-parodies of what those classic
stories were all about:  that perfect someone appearing at the most
improbable--and inconvenient--time.  LOVE AFFAIR does it right.
Warren Beatty and Annette Bening have taken this third telling of a
tear-jerking classic and made it a warm, sentimental and beautifully
filmed experience, limited in its effectiveness only by Beatty's
somewhat wooden lead performance.</P>
<P>     Beatty stars as Mike Gambril, a former NFL quarterback and
inveterate womanizer who is engaged to a popular talk show host (Kate
Capshaw) as more of a business deal than a love match.  On a flight to
Australia, Mike meets Terry McKay (Bening), a struggling would-be
singer herself engaged to a wealthy businessman (Pierce Brosnan).  When
their plane is forced to make an emergency landing, Mike and Terry end
up together for three days on a ship bound for Tahiti and the flight
which will take them home.  In those three days they fall in love, and
vow to meet again in three months if their lives are free of their
previous entanglements.  However, fate intervenes on the appointed day,
and the course of true love does not run smooth.</P>
<P>     If there is one unquestionable triumph to LOVE AFFAIR, it is the
atmosphere.  Director Glenn Gordon Caron (creator of TV's
"Moonlighting") sets up the kind of shots one might expect from a film
fifty years older:  Bening descending a staircase into frame; Beatty
appearing entirely in shadow during their airport fairwell; a slow,
patient scene late in the film in Bening's apartment.  There is a
lyricism to his direction, without the force qualities of other recent
romances.  Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall shoots in deep oranges and
with lots of filters, and photographs Bening in the loving style which
used to be reserved for Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman.  Ennio
Morricone's sweet, simple score also contributes to a mood which
inspires you to hold your date's hand a bit more tightly.</P>
<P>     This is not to say that LOVE AFFAIR gets by on style points
alone.  Beatty has rounded up a truckload of talent to bring the script
(co-written by Beatty and Robert Towne) to life.  At the top of the
list is Bening, Beatty's real life better half, who shines as Terry.
Few actresses in film can manage the kind of mature, intelligent appeal
she brings to her roles, which makes it a shame that her appearances
have been so infrequent of late.  Here she is both savvy and
vulnerable, more than a match for Beatty's aging playboy but still
harboring basic insecurities.  It's not a flashy role--LOVE AFFAIR is
not a flashy movie--but it's a fine performance.  Garry Shandling is
a delight as Kip, Mike Gambril's agent, toning down his usual neurotic
persona and giving a witty reading, and Harold Ramis has a funny cameo
as an acerbic accountant.  But the film is stolen by Katharine Hepburn,
making her first big screen appearance in 13 years as Mike's Aunt
Ginny.  Her scene with Bening, in which she lays the groundwork for
Mike and Terry's relationship, is wonderful, and proves that Hepburn
can still act the heck out of a part (as well as that she is familiar
with a certain four-letter word).</P>
<P>     It's one of LOVE AFFAIR's most significant failings that that same
scene does more to explain Beatty's character than Beatty himself
manages to do.  He sort of wanders through this part at times, never
letting us know what Terry sees in him beyond his come-ons.  This could
have proved to be a fatal flaw, but there is just enough inherent
romance in the situation that their pairing doesn't seem completely
implausible.  LOVE AFFAIR also lags significantly once the two lovers
are separated, with nearly non-existent roles by Capshaw, Brosnan and
Chloe Webb attempting to bridge the gap.  But the cathartic final scene
is effective enough to make up for the melancholy tone of the final
half hour.</P>
<P>     Sentimentality is frequently a tough sell.  LOVE AFFAIR may be
schmaltz, but it is artfully executed and well-acted schmaltz.  And it
renews my faith that somewhere, someone knows how to make a real love
story.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 love affairs:  7.</PRE>
