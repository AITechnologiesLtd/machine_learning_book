<PRE>SUICIDE KINGS
RATING:  6.5 / 10 --> So-so </PRE>

<P>Christopher Walken re-enacts his role as the low-talkin', wise-cracking
mobster he twice played in Abel Ferrara's KING OF NEW YORK, and my
personal favourite TRUE ROMANCE (9/10). This film blends some of the
camaraderie of the gangsters from THE USUAL SUSPECTS (7.5/10), with the
hipper-than-thou Tarantino undertones of the RESERVOIR DOGS (9/10)(see
Little Known Facts below for an homage to DOGS in this film), and comes
up with another cinematic cocktail served via slick characters. </P>
<P>PLOT:
Five rich friends kidnap an ex-mob boss in order to get him to help
them retrieve the kidnapped sister of one of the guys. The mobster is
handily tied up to a chair and forced by said fellas, to attempt a
recovery of the snatched lass, despite him having nothing to do with
the actual caper. Soon enough, the friends all start suspecting each
other of being involved in the sister's kidnapping, while the cool
mobster gently massages their collective brains for relevant
information.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting ensemble piece that features plenty of good actors doing
their stuff, in a script obviously written within the Tarantino
universe, this film offers some cool dialogue, cooler characters, but
an overall flawed plot line, that finally falters in its ambiguous
conclusion. I don't want to be blunt about this whole thing, but the
fact of the matter is that a gentleman by the name of Christopher
Walken just rocks!! And I'm not talking about in this film alone. I'm
talking about the man's legacy of playing extremely creepy, warped,
dangerous, but always interesting characters with the Walken twist of
lime always stuffed in on the side. If you like this man's acting
abilities, his skill to consistently project fear across a movie
screen, his capacity to convey fierce emotion by simply drawing his
eyelids to a close, his charismatic smile and blinding jet-black hair,
you will enjoy him in this film.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the rest of the cast also rack up some brownie points in
their respective roles, with Denis Leary drumming up some of the
funniest lines this side of his jellyfish boots. But all in all, the
film lacked the originality needed to make it a good film. It had some
of the elements, some wired scenes, some great actors, but it was
missing the key element that made all of the previously mentioned films
re-watchable over and over and over again: a great story. You could
slap all the bells and whistles you want around Christopher Walken's
chicken-like neck, but you won't garner half the nacho-munching film
geeks that the others would, unless you manage to lasso a great script
into the molten mix. This film has some of the pieces of that
mish-mash, but can't complete the magic puzzle because of its lack of
originality, uninspired soundtrack and weak ending. Walken and Leary
alone deserve salsas for being the awesome ball-busters that they are,
but the film as a whole works particularly when served as an
after-dinner divertissement, or a pre-supper aperitif. Fun enough to
watch and be playfully amused, flawed enough to forget once the last
melted morsel of cheese is scarfed off the proverbial nacho plate.     </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
There is an obvious homage to Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS in
this film (His influence is palpable in the screenplay), in the one
scene where the two kidnappers are watching said classic motion picture
on the tube (Blink and you'll miss it.) It's the scene in which Mr.
Pink is hauling ass from the cops via a stolen vehicle.
Christopher Walken's real name is Ronald Walken. He was director George
Lucas' second choice for the role of Han Solo in 1977's STAR WARS
(8.5/10). He has been married to the same woman for over 25 years. One
of his most famous quotes, "I make movies that nobody will see. I've
made movies that even I have never seen."
Denis Leary is the cousin of TV's late night talk show host himself,
Conan O'Brien.
This film is based on a short story written by Don Stanford, called
"The Hostage." 
Henry Thomas is better known for his childhood role as Elliot, the
lucky kid who befriended E.T.
Sean Patrick Flanery is a triathlete with a black belt in karate.
Jay Mohr was a performer on TV's "Saturday Night Live" for a few years.</P>
