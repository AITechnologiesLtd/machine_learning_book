<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There's not much excitement to this New Year's Eve of 1981 film, taking
place in the East Village of New York City, except for the attempt at
some revelry by pairs of teens and twenty-somethings trying to make a
statement about their desperate lives, their loneliness, their neurotic
lives, their one-night stands, and their need for partying, smoking and
drinking.</P>
<P>Numerous sketches take place at a party hosted by Monica (Plimpton), who
fears that no one will show up. Her place becomes the focal point for
introducing all the so-called zany characters who try and eventually
will find their way to her party.</P>
<P>The best part of the film, is that it did capture the East Village feel
of the Reagan 1980s. But, for the most part, this was a dull film that
had nothing to say and soon wore out its welcome as the story became
insipid and the characters grating. It was difficult to like anyone in
this motley group of users, wannabes and punkers. In the end, the film
proved to be as shallow as the characters were.</P>
<P>Director Risa Bramon Garcia, making her debut after a successful career
as a casting director, seems to be more interested in getting the pop
music of the 1980s heard and the bizarre dress of party goers viewed,
than in telling a cohesive story. She succeeded in scoring in both of
her limited objects, even getting Elvis Costello to make an appearance.</P>
<P>In this ensemble piece, there are far too many characters to really get
to know them and too many sub plot developments to keep your interest.
Everyone fades in and out of the scene, for no rhyme or reason, each
with some tale to tell. Among all these whites is a wise-guy black cab
driver (David Chappelle ), riding in a disco cab, who is also out there
trying to score women. He offers what goes for words of wisdom to his
passengers. "If you relax, you can get what you want, even if you smell
like dog shit."</P>
<P>The ones with the most screen time are: Monica, who collapses and misses
the tremendous crowd that attends her party, including the one she
idolizes, Elvis Costello; Kevin (Paul Rudd) is an unhappy sourpuss who's
not enjoying his birthday because his girlfriend left him; Lucy
(Courtney Love) is Kevin's best friend for the last five years, who is
accompanying him around town and who has had sex with seemingly everyone
but him. They tempt each other with sex this entire evening. Then
there's - Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman - as teenagers from the
'burbs in  Ronkonkoma, Long Island, who are just looking for a party or
in the case of Gaby, just to get home alive; Janeane Garofalo (Kevin's
ex-girlfriend) is someone who angrily thinks she deserves better than
Kevin and tells this to the cabbie; Ben Affleck is a smug bartender
looking for sex; he has the best line in the film, as he asks two
sex-crazed wannabe punkers, competing for the same guys, Angela
Featherstone and  Nicole Parker, "By the way, how do you like your eggs
in the morning? Scrambled or fertilized?"; Kate Hudson is clumsy, she is
always knocking things over and slipping in dog shit. She is a virgin,
who was deflowered last night night by the ego driven Jay Mohr, a real
lady killer and phony; and, then, there is Brian McCardie, who has a
noticeable Scottish accent. He is an artist not able to keep a woman
because he's lousy in bed.</P>
<P>If I kept scored correctly, each party goer finds a new mate to bring in
the New Year. The film is almost bearable when it just goes for the look
and feel of the times, but when it tries to pontificate, such as when it
sums up the film by comparing relationships to the way smokers have a
need for cigarettes, and asks the question from the pair that got the
most screen time, Rudd and Love, "Why are people so scared of each
other? Why are they scared to be honest with each other?" Then I felt
the party was really over and this MTV produced story faded out with not
one interesting character in the film. I bet you a dollar to a donut,
that you could have gone to most any other New Year's Eve party in
Manhattan and met more interesting people!</P>
