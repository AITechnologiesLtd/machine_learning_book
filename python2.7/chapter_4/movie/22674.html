<P>How does one comprehend the chameolonic Mr. Tom Ripley's actions, and his
desires to be someone else by any means necessary? Is it an attraction to the
posh lifestyle of his new friend, Dickie , or a need to come to terms with his
own identity? Director Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Patricia Hightsmith's
1955 crime novel is as smooth and clever as the titled character, a thrilling,
masterfully told thriller - an exemplary character study of deception and lies,
and of an identity crisis in turmoil. </P>
<P>Matt Damon plays the youthful Ripley, whom we see at the beginning of the film
playing the piano at a reception wearing a Princeton University jacket. He
catches the eye of a wealthy New York ship magnate (James Rebhorn), who falsely
assumes that Ripley went to college with his son, Dickie, considering that
Ripley's jacket is emblazoned with a Class of '56 patch. Under false pretenses,
Ripley is asked by Dickie's father to fly out to Italy to bring back his son,
who is living the high life with his girlfriend, Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow). Once
Ripley arrives in Italy and meets Dickie, he is introduced to a glamorous world
of lavish parties, concerts, beaches, and hot jazz clubs. Dickie (Jude Law) is
a difficult man to get to know, but he is immensely likable and full of energy.
His girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) likes everyone, and takes a liking to
Ripley who is the total opposite of Dickie. But slowly Ripley falls in love,
and Dickie is the man he adores and wants to be - Marge and a snobbish friend
of Dickie's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) are merely distractions in Ripley's
fantasy world. </P>
<P>"The Talented Mr. Ripley" weaves its story and characters smoothly like a
snake, and the slow pace exemplifies its creepy atmosphere - we get the sense
that Ripley's intentions or goals are unclear throughout the film. What does he
want with Dickie, and will he help Dickie's father or does he begin to see
himself as Dickie? And who in fact is Ripley? Sure, he is a talented piano
player and a gifted mimic, but who is the real Ripley? </P>
<P>Excluding "Good Will Hunting," I have not cared for Matt Damon as an actor,
especially in the cartoonish funk called "Dogma." In the guise of Thomas
Ripley, Damon finally finds a character as complex, mischievous and
duplicitious as anything he's ever managed to play before. One moment he is a
smiling simpleton who seems utterly harmless, the next moment he's a conniving,
amoral, two-faced murderer. The transition is brilliantly executed by Damon and
he makes us hold our breath during every moment he is on screen - we are never
sure how he is going to react. And to Damon's credit, he makes Ripley
sympathetic, and there were moments when I was tense and scared for him, since
his murderous ways could be uncovered. </P>
<P>Jude Law, who played the cyber hero in David Cronenberg's "eXistenZ," displays
an interesting range for his character - a devious, devilish grin that masks
his own insecurities about getting close to people, and displays a gradual
tempermental attitude toward Ripley. Law looks like he belongs in the past, and
think of how well he could have fit in any of Hitchcock's thrillers, especially
"Rope" or "Strangers on a Train." If Law did not utter a syllable, he would
still be a commanding presence on screen, so let's hope Oscar nominations are
in the running. </P>
<P>Gwyneth Paltrow turns in a surprisingly credible and intelligent performance,
her best turn since "Hard Eight." Though the role is somewhat thankless and
similar to the awful "A Perfect Murder," she gives the character, Marge, more
weight and nuance than expected. She is amorous, lovable but she also is
suspicious of Ripley, though she does love him as a friend. Paltrow slowly
shows irritation at seeing Ripley everywhere she goes, especially after Dickie
mysteriously disappears. It is a superb performance overall - I'd rather hand
her an Oscar for this mature role than for her Oscar gold in "Shakespeare in
Love." </P>
<P>Director Anthony Minghella, who previously helmed "The English Patient,"
follows Hitchcock's golden rule of psychological thrillers - to make us care
for the characters enough that we feel for their safety, even for a murderer
like Ripley. And no secret is made about Ripley, we know what he is and what he
is capable of and so Minghella makes us wonder what will happen next. He also
shows us the decor and atmosphere of Italy in all its splendor, and all the
sights will make you wish you were there along with Ripley, Marge and Dickie. </P>
<P>Tightly structured and suspense built on characters motivations (what a rarity
nowadays), "The Talented Mr. Ripley" is a masterpiece in the best tradition of
Hitchcock. And there is a sense of emotional doom when Ripley discovers that he
is not aware of his own identity, and may continue searching for any kind of
identification. Brimming with vital supporting turns by Cate Blanchett, Philip
Baker Hall and Philip Seymour Hoffman, "Talented Mr. Ripley" is a uniquely
great film - it may leave you with a bitter taste but you won't soon forget it.
Now that takes talent. </P>
