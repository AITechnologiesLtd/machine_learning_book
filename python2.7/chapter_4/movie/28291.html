<P>In his latest film, Pierce Brosnan plays a British secret agent.  Imagine! 
What a range! </P>
<P>In his defense, though, this spy, Andy Osnard, shares with James Bond only
his profession and his knack for pissing off his bosses.  After a series of
personal scandals, Andy is being exiled to Panama.  As soon as he gets off
the plane, Andy makes contact with Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), a British
tailor who claims to have a Saville Row pedigree.  Since Harry cuts suits for
everybody who's anybody in Panama, Andy figures that Harry can provide him
with info juicy enough to convince London to send money.  As it happens,
Harry is deeply in debt and is willing to take Andy's offer.  So he spins
Andy tales of a group of revolutionaries planning to overthrow the gangsters
who control Panama.  Harry points to his friend Mickie Abraxas (Brendan
Gleeson), once a vocal opponent of Noriega but now a drunken shell of a man,
and his receptionist Marta (Leonor Varela), whose face was scarred by
Noriega's thugs, as leaders of the opposition.
Andy sees that Harry's stories, true or not, could be profitable.</P>
<P>This movie reminds me of "The Silver Bears," an obscure 1977 film in which
the Mafia takes over a Swiss bank and finds itself the victim of an elaborate
silver-mine scam.  Like that movie, "Tailor" presents a satiric world where
most people are corrupt to some degree and where the few innocents suffer
from the machinations of the guilty.  In "Tailor" someone describes Panama as
"Casablanca without heroes."  That's an apt description; in this movie Bogie
would have sold the letters of transit to the highest bidder, seduced
Bergman, and left Paul Henreid holding the bag.</P>
<P>But I wouldn't be surprised if "Tailor" was a more accurate depiction of how
real-life spies and governments operate than any other movie on the subject.</P>
<P>Although Brosnan gets higher billing, Geoffrey Rush is the lead actor, and he
does his usual top-notch job.  Harry Pendel is a complex character.  He's a
sweet person, a devoted husband (to Jamie Lee Curtis' character), father, and
friend.  He tries to embody the Saville Row tradition, believing that all the
best values of Civilization can be summarized by a well-cut suit.  However,
his whole life is built on lies.  The ghost of his criminal mentor Uncle
Benny (playwright Harold Pinter) appears to Harry whenever Harry is in danger
of telling the truth.  Rush plays the contradictions of Harry's character
expertly. </P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan has a less challenging job than Rush but does an excellent job
of playing off his image.  Here the natural charm that he plays as suave as
Bond and Remington Steele is played here as slick and smarmy.  The line
between suave and smarmy proves the be surprisingly thin.  Perhaps that is
why Brosnan chose this role.  Since he's planning to leave the Bond series
after the next installment (due next year), one would think that he'd want to
play anything except a British secret agent.  Although he's only been playing
Bond since 1995, the shadow of 007 has lingered over him his entire career;
it's almost as if he had a visible tattoo saying Born to Be Bond.  Leaving
the role is a very risky move for his career.  Consider the post-Bond careers
of the other actors who've had the role; even Sean Connery had a lonely,
hitless decade before his Oscar-winning comeback in "The Untouchables."</P>
<P>Bottom line:  A cynical, entertaining antidote to Bond-inspired spy flicks</P>
