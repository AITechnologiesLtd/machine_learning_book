                               [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Ed Nilges
                        Copyright 1991 Ed Nilges</PRE>
<P>     Note: this review may spoil Barton Fink for those of us who go to
the movies primarily for the cheap frisson of surprise.  This review is
therefore best read *after* seeing Barton Fink.</P>
<P>     BARTON FINK is a movie I think the French will like; I understand
it's already won several awards at Cannes.  It is an extremely,
surprisingly intelligent movie which at the same time is eminently
watchable, despite descriptions of it which make it sound fairly boring.
Our expectations of BARTON FINK is somewhat like our expectations of MY
DINNER WITH ANDRE.  It would appear that a movie about a blocked nerd of
a writer in a fleabag hotel would be about as boring as, well, spending
time with a blocked nerd of a writer in a fleabag hotel.  BARTON FINK
surprises in somewhat the same way as MY DINNER WITH ANDRE.</P>
<P>     Structurally speaking, BARTON FINK has hints of THE DAY OF THE
LOCUST and of Dashiell Hammett as East Coast (Barton Fink, a
Depression-era writer on the model of Clifford Odets) meets West Coast
and confronts an astonishing spiritual wasteland in himself.  There is
the criminal common man in the form of John Goodman, who has become
since Roseanne a sort of King of the Slobs, there is a dame, a corpse,
and a pair of lowlife cops (who I predict the French will especially
like.)</P>
<P>     Fink is a screenwriter, which is a central and crucially
self-reflexive fact.  The Hollywood screenwriter views himself, perhaps
with some justification, as the creator of the entire dream, for of
course a script has to be much more than a collection of dialogue: it
has hopefully adequate descriptions of camera angles, lighting and a
myriad of other details.  In some sort of Leninist screenwriter's Land
of Cockaigne or Big Rock Candy Mountain, the screenwriter would work
poolside, attended by hordes of willing female slaves (for his gender
would be unreflectingly male) and doted upon by studio moguls.</P>
<P>     This is of course bunkum, and hooey.  A movie is a social art,
constituted in the labor of thousands of people...actors, extras, and
those mysteriously named gaffers and best boys.  It is also constituted
in the paradoxical but real labor of management as studio executives
acquire hardened arteries in marshaling the forces that make the movie.
Even more paradoxically it can be argued that, beyond the ushers and
ticket collectors (and beyond the video store clerks) the very audience
is laboring to produce LA GRANDE ILLUSION as it sits munching popcorn in
the darkened multiplex or in its cluttered parlor.</P>
<P>     The explicit rejection of Barton's pretensions is defiantly
philistine yet necessarily implied by the very content of those
pretensions.  The ringing cry of 1789 for the rights of man and the
radical equality of all our dreams when taken up by women and by
non-Europeans gives the lie to Barton's attempt to privilege himself vis
a vis insurance salesmen and GIs.  1789 became 1989, with its myriad
calls for self-determination and an end to screenwriting and
scriptwriting of *all* sorts, including top-down, dirigiste models of
economic development, in Russia, in Latvia, and in Ethiopia.</P>
<P>     There is more than one marvelous cut to Barton's blocked and
painful attempt to write the story of a Hegelian confrontation he knows
nothing about ("a grade B wrestling picture with Wallace Beery") to the
ease and effortless flow of a secretary's typing.  Ordinarily, the
"male" struggle of the writer, nonwithstanding that it may use the
identical tools as the labor of the secretary, has nothing to do with a
secretary's work, although the same brand names may appear on their
typewriters or, now, their personal computers.  The Barton/secretary cut
undermines this distinction.  The secretary and Barton, the cut seems to
say, are *both* "writers" if all we look at is their behavior of typing
(and isn't behavior all there is?).  If there is any difference, the
secretary is the better, more effortless writer.  When it is of course
objected that the secretary is merely transcribing another's words
whereas Barton is being creative, we might do well to side with the
managers in the film, who decry any such pretension on the part of
screenwriters and who have decried it ever since the days of F. Scott
Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby Stories.  "Creative x," where x has a strong
commercial component, has always had a suspicious odor in America (try
"creative accounting" for example.)  And screenwriters have always been
reminded by studio moguls that they are replaceable parts of what is a
machine, first and foremost, for making money.</P>
<P>     Such is the lowly position of the writer (screenwriter or other-
wise) that modern-day productions of Shakespeare, such as Kenneth
Branagh's HENRY V, eschew mention of Shakespeare's name anywhere on
their publicity posters.</P>
<P>     This review is addressed to a computer net which perforce consists
not completely but preponderantly of computer programmers, support
specialists, and that ilk.  These would do well to reflect that the
position of programmer in our industry is structurally identical
(isomorphic) to that of the Hollywood screenwriter and it inherits the
poignance of writing.  The old-fashioned programmer viewed him- self as
productive of the entire software illusion, only to be continually and
consistently reminded both by computer-resistant ordinary people and the
moguls of his industry (located also in California) of the social nature
of his work.</P>
<P>     The secretary's position brings us to that of the character played
by John Goodman, who, despite his name, has played such ambivalent
roles...a fat common man with a voice like Arthur Godfrey, an attractive
bear, who nonetheless is capable in this movie and in movies like THE
BIG EASY (in which he played a minor role as a corrupt New Orleans cop)
of turning into ursus horribilis at a moment's notice, and then (in this
movie) of even more abrupt and dizzying reversals.</P>
<P>     BARTON FINK refuses to privilege John Goodman; for to replay Aaron
Copland's "Fanfare for the Common Man" at this late date, when it is the
common man who has destroyed rain forests and who has marched in Pol
Pot's legions, is to repeat Barton's essential mistake: the illusion
that *any* unitary voice can speak for "the people" when it is essential
that "the people" speak duplicitously and often repeat stories they've
heard elsewhere.  The movie appears in an era when the very idea of a
positive and held-in-common signifier is a cruel mockery in places with
names like Zagreb and Addis Ababa.</P>
<P>     The burning question is whether people can live with this negation
and not restore their Czar (which, along with the restoration of the old
name of Leningrad to St.  Petersburg, has been a seriously considered
possibility in recent weeks) or their old religious illusions.  The
message of BARTON FINK (if it must have a message) is fairly bleak for
those who, Prufrock-like, would wear white flannel trousers and walk
along the beach (very likely fouled by Saddam's oil spill).  It is as
bleak as Marlowe's, in THE JEW OF MALTA:</P>
<P>     "...thou has committed fornication, but that was in another
     country: and besides, the wench is dead."</P>
