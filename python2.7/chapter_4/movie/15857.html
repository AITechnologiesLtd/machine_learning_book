<PRE>Review:                DOWN IN THE DELTA [Miramax]</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Alfre Woodard, Al Freeman Jr., Esther Rolle
                Mary Alice, Loretta Devine, Wesley Snipes</PRE>
<PRE>Director:         Maya Angelou</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, The SILVER Screen critic</PRE>
<P>Do not dismiss Down in the Delta as a `black' film.  The feeling of
family that it portrays applies to any and all ethnic groups. It is only
the specific connection to slavery that sets it apart.</P>
<P>Alfre Woodard, as Loretta Sinclair, stars in a role that deserves an
Academy Award nomination.  She is the unemployed and unmarried mother of a
10 year old son, Thomas, and a 4 year old, autistic daughter, Tracy.  She
lives in Chicago with her widowed mother RosaLynn Sinclair.  Loretta's
sense of hopelessness is obvious as she turns to liquor and marijuana to
make it from day to day.</P>
<P>Unexpectedly RosaLynn receives a letter from her brother-in-law, Earl
Sinclair, who lives in Biloxi.  It seems that there have been bad feelings
between RosaLynn and Earl because of `Nathan'.</P>
<P>In desperation, hoping that life away from Chicago's crime-ridden streets
can help her daughter and grandchildren, RosaLynn sends them to Biloxi, a
`dry' area, for the summer.  She believes that Loretta can work for Earl
in his chicken restaurant and regain some self-esteem.</P>
<P>Upon arrival in Biloxi they are surprised to learn that Earl's wife,
Annie, is in the final stages of Alzheimer's.    Esther Rolle could
possibly be nominated for best Supporting Actress posthumously.  She is
totally believable as the delicate Annie.</P>
<P>Wesley Snipes is listed in the credits as a co-Executive Producer, as
well as appearing in a relatively small role as Earl and Anne's successful
lawyer son.   There are numerous supporting roles worthy of recognition by
other family members as by Loretta Devine as Aunt Annie's companion.</P>
<P>Maya Angelou, in her directorial debut, creates a film as beautiful as
her poetry.  It is only in the final montage that her direction falters. 
The last few scenes are anti-climatic and unnecessary.  It is because of
this that I give it an A-.  I hope that it gets the recognition that it
deserves.</P>
