<P>KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****) 
Touchstone / 1:33 / 1998 / PG-13 (sexual innuendo, language)
Cast: Richard Dreyfuss; Jenna Elfman; Lily Tomlin; Natasha Lyonne; Gregory 
Smith; Carl Michael Lindner; Stephen Root; Elaine Stritch; Tom Poston; David 
Ogden Stiers 
Director: Todd Holland 
Screenplay: Charlie Peters <HR>What is it with Disney and jungle-themed movies? In the past year, the studio 
has released "Jungle 2 Jungle," an excruciating vehicle for Tim Allen, as well 
as "George of the Jungle," a pleasantly silly reworking of the 1960s cartoon. 
Now, they're the folks behind "Krippendorf's Tribe," a mediocre effort that 
falls somewhere between that pair. Occasional bright spots aside, "Krippendorf" 
redefines the word "primitive" with least-common-denominator humor that 
sometimes pushes the limits of its PG-13 rating. Frankly, it's a shock to see 
such strong potty humor associated with a Disney project, even more so one with 
Richard Dreyfuss in the lead role. Dreyfuss, you'll remember, was 
Oscar-nominated for his "Mr. Holland's Opus" gig two years back. A repeat for 
"Tribe," I think, is out of the question. </P>
<P>Dreyfuss plays James Krippendorf, a recently-widowed, esteemed anthropology 
professor stuck in a dire dilemma -- he's been providing therapy sessions, food 
and other necessities for his three kids with the grant money he was given to 
study an undiscovered tribe in New Guinea. When new faculty member Veronica 
Micelli (Jenna Elfman) shows up on Krippendorf's doorstep to remind him of a 
same-day lecture he's slated to give on his discoveries, he harriedly makes up a 
fictional tribe called the Shelmikedmu (a combination of his children's names). 
To cement his rather outlandish claims, he sets up a village in his backyard and 
films his sons and daughter dressed up and acting in alleged Shelmikedmu 
rituals. But a fellow anthropologist (Lily Tomlin) doubts Krippendorf's claims, 
and sets off to New Guinea to prove him wrong. </P>
<P>Parents who take their little ones to see "Krippendorf's Tribe" expecting a nice 
little family movie -- what it's been marketed as -- will be in for an 
unpleasant awakening, because there are more than a few moments where the 
material pushes bawdy limits. In fact, take away all the menstruation, 
circumcision and sexual jokes, the conversation about a "neolithic dildo" and 
the frequent appearance of Krippendorf's penis sheath (part of his Shelmikedmu 
costume), and there's really not much substance left to chew on. Don't get me 
wrong; some of this stuff is funny in a "Dumb and Dumber" kind of way, but did 
"Krippendorf's Tribe" really have to go so low for laughs? </P>
<P>For a while, Dreyfuss is likeable enough to get us past the fact that James 
Krippendorf is a cowardly jerk. Then, however, his character starts doing some 
pretty nasty, undefendable things that he never seems to have to answer for. 
"Krippendorf's Tribe" might leave a bad taste in your mouth, since it's message 
appears to be that lying is just fine if you can get away with it. Elfman, the 
adorable star of TV's "Dharma and Greg," fares just as well as Veronica; that 
is, she's a lot of fun until the movie turns her into an annoying shrew. Of all 
the cast, only Lily Tomlin offers a consistent performance, probably because she 
appears to be aware of the film's farcical tendencies and her role doesn't take 
a 180-degree turn. </P>
<P>"Krippendorf's Tribe" isn't a bad movie, but it is a terribly misguided one. It 
gets off to a promising, comfortable start with a few good laughs as the story 
sets itself up. But things start to go downhill fast after Krippendorf gets 
Veronica drunk, dresses her up in Shelmikedmu duds and has wild sex with her 
solely for the purpose of getting some footage of the tribe's "mating rituals." 
We later learn that his actions are forgivable because she's really in love with 
him the whole time, but up until this cop-out, the whole situation comes across 
with undertones of rape. Last I checked, rape is no laughing matter. Neither is 
too much of "Krippendorf's Tribe." <HR>© 1997 Jamie Peck
