<PRE>                               SAFE PASSAGE
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1995 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     SAFE PASSAGE has Susan Sarandon once more portraying an
over-protective mother (as in LORENZO'S OIL and, in effect, THE
CLIENT.)  This time she has seven boys to worry about, and Sam Shepard
as an estranged husband whose eyesight keeps flickering on and off like
a worn-out fluorescent light.  She has a lot to worry about too,
because one of her sons is in the Sinai, one of a group of Marines who
have just been bombed while sleeping.  The movie setting is the family
house, while they all wait for the portentous news.</P>
<P>     I thought the movie was well acted and directed, but the
screenplay stunk.  There are too many incidents in this film that are
unmotivated (such as the encounter of the youngest son with Daisy, or
the father's blindness), obvious (the role of the Marine son in the
family is a cliche) or unexplained (what happened to that sickness the
running son came home with; how was the obvious depression of the
youngest son early in the film resolved?)</P>
<P>     Older actresses like Sarandon have a tough time in Hollywood.
Unlike older actors, who achieve greatness and go on to command
fortunes for small roles (Brando, DeNiro, Nicholson), they seem to take
on bigger roles and get less and less for them (Meryl Streep in THE
RIVER WILD is another example.)  I think part of the reason (besides
Hollywood's obvious chauvinism) is that they don't seem to realize that
their best work is behind them.  When Nicholson puts on heavy makeup
for The Joker or The Wolfman he's doing something people really want to
see: an actor with a great history demeaning himself, and having fun
with a role.  A role where he tries to teach us about what it is like
to grow older and give us some compelling insights into the nature of
middle age in a more straightforward way, as Sarandon does here, simply
would not be as successful, regardless of how well it would be received
critically. (Though I must admit I have no idea if people would go to
see, say, Streep in a John Waters film.)</P>
<P>     Many of the actors here seem wasted; they could have made just as
much of a movie with many fewer sons.  Robert Sean Leonard, a fine
young actor, seems frozen by the constraints of his role.  Sam Shepard
spends most of his time moping around; he does nothing to suggest his
role in this family was anything more than perfunctory. On the other
hand, the woman who plys the psychologist girlfriend of Leonard has a
striking presence.</P>
<P>     The direction, on the other hand, seemed right on.  I particularly
liked the little touches in the interaction between Sarandon and the
other characters, especially including Shepard.  Shepard's falling
asleep when he did is a cliche, as is the scene where Shepard and
Sarandon end up on the floor, but they don't seem so; a feeling of much
greater complexity in their relationship comes through than what the
screenplay itself conveys.</P>
