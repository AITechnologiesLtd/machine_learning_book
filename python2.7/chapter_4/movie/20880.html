<P>"Boys Don't Cry", the debut film of Kimberly Peirce, is probably the
most emotionally draining picture I will see all year. Having read the
news stories on which this film is based, I knew how it all was going
to end. But that didn't lessen the powerful impact which this film had
on me. It is admittedly a very difficult film to watch, and one that I
cannot recommend to all viewers. However, if you are looking for a
gripping portrait of Americana gone bad, then "Boys Don't Cry" is the
film you need to see.</P>
<P>If you do not know the heartbreaking story of Brandon Teena, then I
will ask you to read no further than this paragraph. It is impossible
to review this film without discussing the ending. But if you know how
the story ends, the film's strong emotional bond is not weakened.</P>
<P>"Boys Don't Cry" explores the life of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank)
from the day he wanders into Falls City, Nebraska, until the day of
his grisly death a few months later.  Brandon is really a girl named
Teena who is in the midst of a sexual identity crisis. One night,
after having lesbian slurs thrown at her, she decides to cut her hair
and dress like a man. She goes roller skating and ends the night
making out with a beautiful blonde.</P>
<P>The next night, she tries it again, and she meets John (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brendan Sexton III), who take Brandon to a party
in their hometown, Falls City. The next day, Brandon wakes up and
realizes that he's still there. That night, at a karaoke bar, he gets
his first glimpse of Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the most beautiful girl in
town.</P>
<P>John, the tough guy who has just got out of prison, resides in Lana's
house with her mother (Jeanna Arnette) and his young daughter. John
has no impulse control, and can often go into unprecedented fits of
wild rage. He immediately takes a liking to the girlish Brandon, but
one can see how he slowly begins to notice his true identity.</P>
<P>Brandon and Lana slowly form a convincing relationship. Like
characters in every small town movie, Lana is bored with her life, and
needs someone to help open her eyes. This helps explain why later in
the film, when she finds out who Brandon really is, she decides to
stay with him/her. Brandon is known as the nice, slightly awkward guy
in town, and Lana likes his sense of newness in her world of familiar
people. All the questions about how their relationship functions
sexually are explained in the film, so I won't go into detail.</P>
<P>Things are going quite well for Brandon in his new life, until he
misses a court date in Lincoln for a grand theft auto which occurred a
while back. Soon his past life of fake IDs and crime catches up with
him, and he finds himself in prison...in the girls ward.</P>
<P>Kimberly Peirce presents every stage of this tragedy flawlessly, and
she doesn't do it alone. Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny are excellent
together; each one bringing such emotional honesty to their role. In a
better world, Swank would be a shoo in for an Oscar nomination, but
"Boys Don't Cry" is too explicit and truthful a film to win such an
award.</P>
<P>"Boys Don't Cry" retells one of the most important stories of the
1990's, one that Peirce recreates down to every detail. She spent ages
of research on this project, and even made Hilary Swank live as a man
for a number of weeks. It is a breakout film for everyone involved,
and can stand tall as one of 1999's very best.</P>
<P>The tragic ending to this gritty tale is one that will continue to be
discussed. How could we live in such a homophobic society that a girl
must dress as a boy in order to be accepted, and then die for her
actions? People try to fit in in different ways, with different
results.  The saddest thing about "Boys Don't Cry" is that it really
is just another murder story, one that happens every day in all parts
of the world, but makes us turn our head away.</P>
