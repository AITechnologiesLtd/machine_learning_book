<PRE>Dogma: losing my religion</PRE>
<P>Angels in the movies are nothing new. From Wings of Desire to A Life Less
Ordinary. Similarly, the idea of Earth as a battlefield is older than
Milton, and has been done as well (Prophecy I & II, etc). God's even taken
mortal (comic) form before, as George Burns. However, never before has
George Carlin been a cardinal, Chris Roc the 13th apostle, Selma Hayek an
exotic-dancing muse. Religion on the big screen's always been a little too
orthodox for that. As in sacred. As in be careful, Salman Rushdie. With
Dogma, Kevin Smith is more than just not careful, he's irreverent, glib,
interpreting the (Catholic) Church through, say, Ghostbusters. Meaning Jesus
Christ becomes 'J.C.' Prophets speak with profane tongues. Nuns are
corruptible. Angels carry guns and aren't at all reluctant to use them. In
fact, the one stable role in Dogma is Janeane Garofalo, the slightly bitter
abortion clinic employee. She's the only one not crusading, the only one
without holy import.</P>
<P>However--though roles like this were practically made for her--Jeanine
Garofalo's not the 'doubting hero' that just about every religious movie
needs to 'convert,' (where conversion stands in for character development)
but Linda Fiorentino is, as Bethany, which continues the longstanding
religious thriller tradition (Seventh Sign, Stigmata, etc) of having a
single women save the world. Kind of like an anti-Eve, just one who turns
fire extinguishers on burning, talking bushes. But who in the 20th century
wouldn't, right? This type commentary constitutes a large part of Dogma--the
lingering suspicion that religious iconography hasn't kept up with the
times. As Cardinal Carlin says, it's time for some revamping; as Nietzsche
might say, though, 'vamp' in that context means already dead. Dogma tosses
all of this around and more.</P>
<P>It all starts when two exiled angels--Loki (the Norse trickster?; Matt
Damon) and Bartleby (as in the Scrivener; Ben Affleck)--discover they can go
home again, via a biblical loophole in the garden state itself, New Jersey.
So now they have four days left to kill, literally, on Earth. The thing is,
though, if they do sneak back into heaven, it'll show that God (AWOL for 98%
of Dogma) isn't quite as infallible as s/he claims to be, and we can't have
that. Meaning his/her crack staff has to mobilize against Loki and Bartleby,
whose Swedenborgian hostility towards mortals is getting a tad out of hand
(see: office massacre, etc). Thus starts all the divine warfare,
interspersed with what turns out to be some rational theological
discussions. But then Kevin Smith's strong suit has always been dialogue.</P>
<P>If only he would have stuck to dialogue, too, Dogma would have been a much
stronger movie. As is, it feels effects-laden at times, (e.g., an
unnecessary fecal golem, etc) and all the delays in getting to the battle
scene in New Jersey feel forced, contrived--as if it's all been extended
simply to allow these top-billed stars a few more trailer-worthy scenes.
Surprisingly, too, a few of the jokes fall embarrassingly flat, even one of
Silent Bob's (Kevin Smith). And, unlike his compadre Jay, (Jason Mewes) he's
supposed to only talk when it really matters. They are dramatically written
in this time, though, so perhaps the occasional dead line is part of the
package.</P>
<P>In Dogma's favor, it is loud, fast and funny, it all just goes a little
long, tries to work in a few too many jokes, when less would have been more.
Compared to Clerks and Chasing Amy, Dogma is sub-par Kevin Smith. Or, Kevin
Smith with a real budget, no longer having to innovate. On its own, though,
it's still better than two-thirds of the movies out there, and has enough
in-stuff going on (Quick Stop, Dante, etc) that die-hard Kevin Smith fans
won't go away feeling cheated. In case you're not a Kevin Smith acolyte,
though, there's still the guiltysweet transgression ('hellworthy trespass,'
in Dogma-terms) of seeing 'God' in lowercase, in the credits, of hearing
angels swear, of dressing George Carlin up in robes, any of which make Dogma
just about worth the price of admission.</P>
