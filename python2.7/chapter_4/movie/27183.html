O Brother, Where Art Thou?</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Two dim wits and a fast talker (Clooney) escape from prison in the 
1930's South USA. Seeking a hidden 1.2 million-dollar treasure, the 
police-dodging trio hitchhike from one near-surreal adventure to the 
next. All the while, deeply rich gospel music graces their adventures.</P>
<P>Clooney splendidly rattles encyclopedic phrases off a friendly southern 
accent. His two narrow-eyed buddies are also charming despite their lack 
of brains. Vying between the light and the peacefully religious, "O 
Brother" eventually favors the silly instead of the profound.</P>
<P>Beautifully filmed with carefully scripted dialogue, the production 
almost breaks out into cinema greatness. If only the rich touch and feel 
had been backed up with a stronger knot and substance, this one could 
have been as truly gorgeous as its music. A strong B+.</P>
