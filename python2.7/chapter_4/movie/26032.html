TRUE LIES
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Among all the films made by James Cameron, TRUE LIES is the
least appreciated (with the exception of PIRANHA 2). This
could be explained with the fact that TRUE LIES seem rather
atypical for Cameron and his opus. While almost all other
Cameron's films might have a humorous bit of dialogue or
two, they tend to be dead serious, whether they deal with
time-travelling cyborgs, aliens or doomed ocean liners. So,
when Cameron announced his choice of 1994 project - American
remake of LA TOTALE!, rather obscure French 1991 farce -
many people were surprised. This film, although laced with
spectacular action and other director's trademarks, still
looked like an excursion from Cameron's home waters.
Naturally, the film, although commercially successful, was
misunderstood by the critics who dismissed it as bad or, at
best, unusual moment in otherwise unquestionable career.</P>
<P>The protagonist of the film is Harry Tasker (played by
Arnold Schwarzenegger), agent in Omega Force, supersecret US
government agency that deals with nuclear terrorists. After
retrieving important information during a dangerous raid on
Swiss chateau he returns to his house in Washington D.C.
where he is greeted by his wife Helen (played by Jamie Lee
Curtis), 14-year old daughter Dana (played by Elisa Dushku)
and a dog. Tasker's family doesn't have a clue about his
line of work and for the last fifteen years they are
convinced that Harry works as dull sales representative for
computer company. Harry managed to keep his professional and
family life apart, but this is about to change very soon.
Harry is on the trail of Salim Abu Aziz (played by Art
Malik), leader of dangerous Mideastern terrorists who had
acquired ex-Soviet nuclear warheads and who are about to use
them in order to blackmail US government. This, however,
becomes secondary problem to Harry, who is convinced that
his long-neglected wife has an affair. Against the advice of
his partner and best friend Gib (played by Tom Arnold) Harry
decides to find identity of mysterious lover. His
investigation brings him in touch with Simon (played by Bill
Paxton), used car salesman who tells outrageous stories
about his spy adventures in order to get lonely and
adventure-seeking housewives to his bed. Humiliated Harry
plots spectacular revenge on Simon and his wife, but his
actions would have unforeseen consequences.</P>
<P>Most of the criticism directed towards TRUE LIES came from
those people still unable to accept comedy made with 100
million US$ of budget. When they appraised the film, they
appraised as straightforward action drama and, naturally,
they were less than enthusiastic about action scenes that
defy laws of gravity, common sense or, in some cases, even
good taste. Cameron seemed to enjoy making those scenes as
spectacular as possible, but his decision to go over the top
(horse-motorcycle chase is one of such example) indicate
that his aim was nothing but parody. And not only parody of
Bond films (which receive homage in the opening scene), but
also parodies of 1980s action movies, including some of
those that turned Schwarzenegger into star (COMMANDO,
PREDATOR) and, finally, Cameron didn't hesitate to make
parody of himself. This new, unusual humorous setting seemed
like a good thing for Schwarzenegger, whose role of Harry
Tasker is his best comedic effort so far. His success is
even bigger when we consider that he was partnered by Tom
Arnold, one of top American comedians. Actually, almost
everyone in this film seems comfortable in their roles.
Jamie Lee Curtis has especially difficult task since she
must play various personalities - modest housewife who turns
into irrestisible seductress only to end up as strong,
independent woman Cameron likes to have in his films.
Failure to explain such transformation is probably the
biggest problem of this film, and it wasn't Curtis' fault;
she played her role very well. Villains, on the other hand,
are more cartoons and less characters. This probably doesn't
represent problem for Art Malik, whose Salim is deliberately
played over the top, but Tia Carrere as evil seductress
would be marked as pretty face and nothing more.</P>
<P>Another, more serious, charge against TRUE LIES came from
those who found some of the contents socially unacceptable
in this day and age. The most common accusation was
misogyny. Two male protagonists stalk, kidnap and torture
woman before they subject her to extremely cruel and
humiliating practical joke. For many people, especially
those who take 1990s "political correctness" seriously,
comedy in TRUE LIES failed to justify presentation of such
actions as an acceptable behaviour. Harry, of course, gets
his comeuppance and in the last scenes of the film he is
presented as equal to Helen, but that nevertheless failed to
silence the critics. Another group that viewed TRUE LIES as
controversial were Arabs; portrayal of Arab terrorists as
dirty, unshaven and utterly stupid dark-skinned fanatics
might have looked offensive and stereotypical on the verge
of racism. Cameron again tried to pre-empt the criticism by
creating the character of Harry's trusted and computer-
literate Arab sidekick Faisal (played by Grant Heslov). This
failed to produce desired effect and TRUE LIES is until this
day cited as the most explicit example of Hollywood
prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in general.</P>
<P>However, those viewers who don't care about political
correctness would probably appreciate TRUE LIES as stylishly
done piece of Hollywood entertainment. This combination of
spectacular action and hilarious comedy actually represents
one of the most entertaining films of 1990s. TRUE LIES is
film that definitely doesn't deserve its bad reputation and
almost inevitable slide into oblivion.</P>
