<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A "B" movie, based on a British TV serial called The Trollenberg Terror,
that is not to be taken seriously while it provides enough unintentional
funny material and hokem to possibly get a mute to laugh aloud. There
are no pretenses, this is one of those bad movies that is enjoyable in a
non-intellectual way. It features dialogue that is so stilted, it might
knock your head off, if while you were listening you tried to actually
digest it for its meaning. To enjoy one of these early science fiction
thrillers, made before quality special effects became a sci-fi
prerequisite, one must keep an open mind for how cheesy the film looks
and have a special feel for low brow culture. This stuff ain't
Spielberg, it ain't even up to Robin Williams' low standards--  it's bad
alright, but not that bad that it can't be laughed at!</P>
<P>At the remote Swiss Alpine village of Trollenberg, people are
disappearing and one mountain climber is found with no head. The mystery
of how these mountain climbers are being killed off, turns out to be
that there is hidden in the stationary radioactive clouds,  some
one-eyed, tentacled, extra terrestrials. Please refrain from yodeling
any uncalled for responses, upon learning that these outer space
creatures have invaded Switzerland, having just come from the Andes. It
seems that these nonmoving clouds can only survive in the extreme cold
and therefore choose mountain tops as their choice spots of habitation.
Warning: watch out for later on in the film, when these same clouds
move!</P>
<P>Allen Brooks (Tucker) is a U.N. scientist, who is as serious as a heart
attack. He has an urgent message from his old scientific friend, the
nutty Professor Crevett (Mitchell), to come at once to Trollenberg.
Allen got his reputation burnt recently by reporting the possibility of
extra terrestrials in the Andes and could not offer any proof, so when
told by the professor that he suspects the many accidents occurring to
climbers, is due to that mysterious cloud, the same type of cloud that
was in the Andes, which he is observing in his observatory tower, that
is built like a fortress on the side of the mountain, complete with
steel-shuttered windows (no explanation is given why it was built this
way). Allen must be thinking to himself, give me proof, man, don't leave
me hanging again, what are the other scientists going think of me! Don't
tell me, professor, that you can't report it to the authorities yourself
because you're a serious scientist, busy studying cosmic rays-- I'm
serious, too! But, of course, Allen doesn't say this to the professor,
he just says, we must have more proof before we ask for help.</P>
<P>Anne (Munro) and Sarah Pilgrim (Jayne) are English sisters who developed
a mind reading act; and, due to Anne being telepathic, she picks up a
signal to get off in Trollenberg rather than go on to their intended
Geneva destination. She feels something pulling her to stay here that is
stronger than her sister's signal to move on, and joins Allen, who was
on the same train, in staying at the Hotel Europa, where the genial but
concerned innkeeper is Herr Klein (he's losing business big time). Also
there is a British newspaper man, Philip (Payne), who smells a story
here after seeing Allen unpack a pistol from his suitcase when arriving
and soon recalls him from the alien story on the Andes. There are also a
pair of climbers staying, Brett (Faulds) and Dewhurst (Saunders), who
are not concerned about the accidents, saying they are not
superstitious, just give them a drink before they start the climb and
they'll be fine.</P>
<P>When the two climbers reach the hut on their first day, they plan to
spend the night there, but Anne freaks out, seeing a vision of Brett
disappearing. Sure enough, when Allen calls Dewhurst in the hut, he
reaffirms that Brett is mysteriously gone. When the search party reaches
Dewhurst, they find him with his head torn off. Later, Brett returns to
the inn, but it turns out he is a dead man, sent by the aliens to kill
Anne, because she's on their frequency. When Brett is cut after
attacking Anne he doesn't bleed, but he folds up like a cheap suit when
Allen puts a few slugs in his belly. Brett was kept alive by being
frozen and when killed again, he melts away to a skeleton.</P>
<P>Allen and the professor now feel confident that they are dealing with
monsters and thereby gather everyone in the inn to go up to the
observatory in the cable-car, where they will have a better chance of
surviving. At last, they come across the monster, and all I can say, it
was smart of the filmmaker to wait till nearly the end of the film to
see what they look like. Rather than being scary, the monsters looks a
lot like an overweight Oprah, interviewing a political candidate from
the right-wing and frowning at his politically incorrect responses with
her one gigantic eye.</P>
<P>Allen puts two and two together, and decides since these creatures can
only live in the extreme cold, he better fire-bomb them and get some
airplane support from the British Royal Air Force to bomb them, and
before you can say Jackie Robinson, these monsters are out of here.</P>
<P>There are no surprises in this film. If you see it, you know what kind
of film you are getting. The Crawling Eyes may be a good film to see on
late night cable TV while you are hoisting a few at the bar. In the
film, everyone of the characters either has a brandy or a Scotch to
drink at some time, when shook up or about to climb the mountain or just
to be sociable. Therefore, they might know something about this film
that others don't, that it might be best to have a few nips while
viewing to enhance the quality of the film, not that I am an advocate of
drinking, but what the hell...it can't hurt in this case. Children
wouldn't need any artificial stimulants, the movie should be right on
their level. I saw it sober, just for the record. So my grading of the
film should be more favorably skewed for those who might be inclined to
imbibe.</P>
