<P>Low-budget horror flick follows similar paths to most monster movies
of the 50's.  USAF Major (Marshall Thompson) is assigned to
investigate the death of a local farmer near an isolated airbase in
Canada.  There may be a link between other mysterious deaths and radar
experiments conducted by the base.  Meanwhile an elderly professor
(Kynaston Reeves) is pursuing research of his own.  Scenario falls
into the wave of horror productions that presented atomic radiation as
the new boogeyman of the postwar era.  Its monster, however, is not
the fallout-mutated freak favored by other B-pictures.  In fact, it's
not until the film's end that we see the creature(s) at all.  Story's
premise mixes telekinetic energy and nuclear radiation in a fairly
hodgepodge manner - the professor's simple mind-concentration
experiments might as well be witchcraft or demon-summoning.  Arbitrary
treatment of science almost loses only anti-war element film has to
offer.  The creature is clearly meant to personify the spirit of war
latent in mankind - after all, as the prof spells out, it is evil and
feeds on radiation (if it feeds on radiation then why is it attacking
people for mental energy?).  More revealing is the way the story
assumes that thoughts released to wander free of human minds will
automatically become amoral and harmful.  So much for the concept of
free will!  Besides, it's never established whether the creature is a
product of the id (as in FORBIDDEN PLANET, which came out a year
earlier), the ego, or the superego; or whether it is from the
reptilian, mammalian, or human parts of the brain.  At least these
details might have provided some rationale for the monster, instead of
simply writing off humanity as being inherently self-destructive.  In
spite of flaws, film is still a notch above most B-pics, thanks to a
couple of creepy moments, and a keen finale in a living room.</P>
