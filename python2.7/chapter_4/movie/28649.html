<PRE>THE GOONIES
A film review by Joshua Tyler
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The Goonies has convinced me that sterility might not be such a bad
thing.</P>
<P>The Goonies stars Sean Astin and Corey Feldman in their formative years,
as leaders of a ratty group of kids who live in the boondocks.  When
wealthy developers threaten to move in, they discover an old treasure
map, and set off in search of "the rich stuff" to save their admittedly
pathetic way of life.</P>
<P>The Goonies is more than just some goofy Fox Kids treasure hunt story. 
Over time, it has become a true cult classic, heralded by film geeks and
movie nerds the world over.  Yes, at its heart it is just a simple
kiddie tale, no different than the hundreds of other kiddie tales which
go straight to video every year.  But, The Goonies has a certain
scruffy, goofball roughness that makes it endearing and lovable,
allowing it a special place in the hearts of its followers that has
endured the test of time.</P>
<P>That's not to say that every viewer will quickly find himself caught up
in the film.  The Goonies suffers from an overabundance of shouting and
at times devolves into nothing more than a furball of grungy kids
running around screaming and talking over one another.  Indeed, at times
I was left wondering why director Richard Donner didn't hire a nanny or
a drill instructor to get the kids to shut up and talk in coherent
sentences.  But real kids are not quiet, and real kids do not deliver
Oscar-worthy lines with great drama and flair.  Real kids do run around
shouting and jumping and generally making a nuisance of themselves.  So,
perhaps in spite of the fact that the film frequently becomes extremely
annoying, the rampant kiddie-rampaging isn't so bad after all.</P>
<P>In the end, The Goonies is a flick to watch with your children.  Much
like this year's Spy Kids, this is a film that the whole family can
love.  Replete with lavish and quirky set design, goofily harmless
antics, and smart scoring, Donner manages to delight and surprise at
every turn in a coming of age tale the likes of which is rarely seen.</P>
<P>Grab the kids, order a pizza, and let The Goonies convince you that
perhaps your children really aren't so bad after all.</P>
