<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A more conventional and not as absorbing remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum,
1933, made with the gimmick of 3-D (used in a fun way with novelty shots of a
barker batting paddleballs in your face and a murderer jumping seemingly out at
the audience). It also effectively used the special Warner Color process. </P>
<P>It is very competently filmed, and has plenty of chills and screams in it; such
as--a woman being chased through the deserted city streets by the disfigured man
in a cloak who murdered her best friend. Strangely enough, the film's director,
André de Toth, lost the sight of one eye and therefore couldn't appreciate the
effects of 3-D since he had no depth perception. This is also the film where
Vincent Price made his mark as a villain figure in horror films and was typecast
forever in that role. </P>
<P>Prof. Henry Jarrod (Price) is a genius sculptor of wax figures and has a small
museum in the New York City at the turn of the century, where he's partners with
a crass businessman, Matthew Burke (Roberts), who doesn't appreciate the
aesthetic beauty of Jarrod's work. He wanted to make the museum more commercial
by displaying a Chamber of Horrors, but Jarrod is only interested in creating
real-life beauty from historical figures such as Marie Antoinette and Joan of
Arc. Burke claims he wants more business revenues for his stake in the
partnership and is anxious when Jarrod has arranged for wealthy art critic
Sidney Wallace to have a private viewing at the museum. Wallace mulls over the
prospects offered him by Jarrod to buy Burke out and become his partner, but
Wallace says he can't make that decision until three months from now as he'll be
away on a business trip. </P>
<P>This news isn't good for Burke, who decides not to wait but to burn the place
down for the $25,000 insurance money. When Jarrod tries to stop him, he's
overtaken by Burke and left to die in the museum. He escaped without being
detected but is a disfigured and bitter man without the use of his hands, and
has secretly started a new museum with his assistants Igor (Charles Bronson) and
Leon (Young). He uses his pupils to steal bodies from the morgue and to do the
sculpture work he can't do anymore. Igor is a deaf mute who does all the dirty
work, while Leon does the sculpture under his master's direction. He's a parolee
who was once a great artist but slid downhill because of his drinking problem.
The biggest change in Jarrod, is that he has now turned into a monster who seeks
revenge. He gets to Burke and hangs him, keeping his body as a wax figure of him
in the museum. He has decided to use real people and pour wax over them to make
his work look real. He starts a Chamber of Horrors by making a wax figure of the
first man in New York to die in the electric chair, William Kemmler (August 6,
1890). To fool others, he gets around in a wheelchair, but he has full use of
his legs, as he strangled Cathy Gray (Jones), the girlfriend of Burke, in her
rooming house apartment and was discovered by Sue Allen (Kirk). Cathy is now
immortalized as the face of Joan of Arc. </P>
<P>Sue ends up living in the house of her mother's friend, Mrs. Andrews, and starts
seeing her sculptor son Scott (Picerni). He's a friend of Wallace's and ends up
working in Jarrod's cellar. When she believes that Joan of Arc is really Cathy,
the police begin to take her seriously and investigate Jarrod. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in the next paragraph. </P>
<P>The policeman investigating the murder of Burke, which took place a year ago, is
Lt. Brennan (Lovejoy). He will come to the rescue of Sue and Scott in the cellar
of Jarrod's museum, when he sweats it out of Leon what the insane genius is up
to--that is to make Sue his next Marie Antoinette. </P>
<P>It was a decent enough horror film, as seen in this cable TV version of regular
2-D, but it lacked more sparks to it. It seemed to languor at points of its
story, and its Grand Guignol characterization was too often wasted by touristy
tours of the museum. They were interesting, but didn't add much to the story.
All the creepiness comes from Price and Igor. </P>
