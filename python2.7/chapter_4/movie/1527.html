<PRE>                              ENCHANTED APRIL
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     ENCHANTED APRIL is a film by Mike Newell, from a script by Peter
Barnes.  It stars Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Joan Plowright,
and Polly Walker, with Alfred Molina, Michael Kitchen, and Jim
Broadbent.  Photographed by Rex Maidment.  Based on a novel by Elizabeth
Von Armin.  Rated PG, due to subject matter.</P>
<P>     ENCHANTED APRIL is another entry in the ongoing series of costume
pictures based on British novels of the 1920s, especially the ones where
the Britons go to Italy to thaw out emotionally and elsewise.  Unlike
ROOM WITH A VIEW or WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD, the source material here
is not E. M. Forester, but Elizabeth Von Armin, a writer with
considerably less reputation amongst today's readers.  By all reports,
Peter Barnes, who wrote THE RULING CLASS, has trimmed much deadwood from
the novel, the clumsy humor and several subplots, to concentrate on the
recuperative magic of a special place.  In this case, the special place
is a small Italian castle overlooking the sea and surrounded by gardens
and woods of the most exquisite beauty.  The film was shot sequentially
in the same place that Von Armin wrote her novel, St. George's Fortress
(now called Castello Brown), near Portofino.  It may that the actors
were as affected by the place as were their characters, for the change
that comes over everyone is remarkably visible in their faces and body
language.</P>
<P>     The story is slight, even hard to believe due to its sunny outlook,
its familiarity, even its magic.  But it provides a framework for some
lovely ensemble acting by four of Britain's best.  Joan Plowright, the
vinegary old survivor of the Victorian literary set, who want to sit in
the shade and remember better times, takes over any scene she's in,
which is as it should be.  Polly Walker plays the beautiful,
aristocratic leader of London's smart set, who is tired of being the
center of attention, of the empty life.  Josie Lawrence is a rather
fanciful, intuitive London housewife who is bullied by her tightwad
husband (Alfred Molina).  And Miranda Richardson goes against type and
plays a dowdy suburban housewife, who does not approve of her
novelist-husband's books.  He's played by Jim Broadbent.  The third man
in the story is the owner of the castle, Michael Kitchen, who drops in
on the group after they're well ensconced in Italy.</P>
<P>     ENCHANTED APRIL, despite it thinness, its incredibility, is both
magical and very funny.  The actors are superb.  The photography fills
you longing to get on the next plane for Portofino.  The transformation
the place effects is not quite made accessible to us, we are reduced to
taking it on face, but it is good to believe in something so
rejuvenating, so recuperative.</P>
<P>     I can recommend ENCHANTED APRIL to anyone in need of little uplift.</P>
