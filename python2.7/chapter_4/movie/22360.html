Susan Granger's review of "ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER" (Sony Pictures Classics)</P>
<P>This is the foreign language picture you'll be hearing about in
the coming awards season. It's the 13th film and best work so far from
Spanish film-maker Pedro Almodovar, who gave us unconventional fare
like The Flower of My Secret, Live Flesh, and Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown. This baroque, non-judgemental film about femaleness
- what it means to be female - tells the story of Manuela (Cecilia
Roth), whose teenage son is killed by a car. Honoring her son's wish
to learn more about the father he never knew, she goes she goes back
to her native Barcelona to locate the man she fled from nearly 20
years earlier - a man now known as Lola. Finding herself amidst drug
addicts and transvestite hookers, she befriends another former
companion, Agrado (Antonio San Juan), who introduces her to Sister
Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a nun whose own secret connection to Manuela is
cleverly interwoven into the criss-crossing fabric of coincidences and
interconnections as she comes to reconcile with ghosts from her
past. For inspiration in creating these characters, Almodovar draws on
many sources: A Streetcar Named Desire, echoing Blanche Dubois' famous
line: "I've always depended on the kindness of strangers...", All
About Eve, from which the title and character comes, and, primarily,
John Cassavetes' Opening Night, in which a Broadway actress (Gena
Rowlands) is haunted by the accidental death of an idolatrous young
woman.  But Almodovar creates a fascinating, often hilariously funny
work that stands on its own, evolving into a magnificent, if
melodramatic, meditation on female solidarity. Almodovar calls it a
"screwball drama." On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, All About My
Mother is a poignant 10. It's 1999's best foreign language film.</P>
