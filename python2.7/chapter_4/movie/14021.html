<P>   In his existentialist work "No Exit"--which may have been
the inspiration for "Cube"--playwright Jean-Paul Sartre
conveys the theme that "Hell is other people."  In that drama
first produced in 1944, a valet brings three characters into an
elegant, windowless room.  Each is dead and will spend
eternity with the others.  Each has a distinct character--a
cowardly womanizer; a socialite adultress; a jealous lesbian. 
Each is thwarted and held in check by the others.  While "No
Exit" may not be the great play which some consider it, it was
a thematic breakthrough in its time.  </P>
<P>   The subject is no longer a new one though there is room
for an imaginative film team to cast an engaging production. 
"Cube" is not such a creation.  The claustrophobic film is
inhabited by six uninteresting individuals who'd have you
climbing the walls in 90 minutes, much less an Sartrian
eternity, and in fact the movie provides its own evidence of
this.</P>
<P>   In Vincenzo Natali's concept, six people inexplicably find
themselves imprisoned in a set of cubes, a diabolical
construction designed to test their ingenuity and, more
important, their teamwork in calculating an escape.  With their
minds curiously concentrated, would they be capable of
working together, or would their conflicting personalities drive
them further to a slow death by starvation and thirst?  To
raise the ante, the cubes are booby-trapped.  While moving
from one unit to another, the reluctant tenants could be
eviscerated by a score of knives, sent tumbling down
a bottomless pit, or severely burned.  By pooling their natural
talents, however, the six could conceivably make successful
departures into the sunlight.</P>
<P>   The actors are bogged down with melodramatic posturings
excessive to the point of caricature.  Quentin (Maurice Dean
Wint), in particular, owns a pair of eyes whose very gaze
would strike terror in the heart of a lion, but his fiery look is so
fixed throughout the narrative that it becomes laughable.  Wint
plays the role of a cop and therefore a natural leader, but one
whose hostilities are so rampant that he is unable to
contribute constructively to the group.  He is irritated
particularly by Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), a doctor at a free
clinic whose liberal views consign her, in the cop's vision, as a
bleeding heart.  Firing off a stream of invectives, he informs
her that she and her family would not even be alive if it were
not for the ruthless actions of the police forces.  Politically
separated, the two become instant enemies, with Quentin
labeled by others in the group as a Nazi.</P>
<P>   Those who contribute to the group's survival include Leaven
(Nicole de Boer), a mathematical genius who, like Max Cohen
in Darren Aronofsky's movie "Pi" believes there's a pattern to
everything.  As Worth, David Hewlett feels some guilt that he
has unwittingly contributed to the building of the Picasso-like
prison, and at first resigns himself to dying therein as he feels
he has no purpose in life.  Rennes (Wayne Robson) uses his
skill as a man who has escaped from prison seven times
while Kazan (Andrew Miller), an autistic young man, surprises
the group with his savant calculations.</P>
<P>   Its lame dialogue and flat plot notwithstanding, "Cube" does
enjoy superior special effects for a low-budget job, chief of
which is an opening scene of a man whose body falls apart
into neat slices and tumbles to the floor without a whimper. 
The physical layout is impressive: a progression of cubes of
varying colors which Rubik would have a tough time
negotiating and whose perils are represented in part by
sinister colors, with red as the most intimidating.</P>
<P>   With all its limitations, Mr. Natali's production heralds good
contributions in the future if he can more closely model
himself after horror-master David Cronenberg.  No other
director can touch Cronenberg's portrayal of the intensity of
human frailty and decay: the technique of giving corporeality
to anger, disease, dread and hope with films like "Dead Zone"
(about a man able to see the end of life in anyone he
touches), "Videodrome" (which depicts how films and TV alter
our notions of reality), and "The Fly" (a screwball romance
about the kinship of freaks with the rest of us).  "The Cube,"
by contrast," merely puzzles.</P>
