<PRE>Directed by: Peter Howitt</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Peter Howitt</PRE>
<P>Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, John Hannah, John Lynch, Jeanne Tripplehorn</P>
<P>Ingredients: London gal, fate, true love, running joke about Monty
Python's Spanish Inquisition</P>
<PRE>Synopsis: 
American actress Gwyneth Paltrow with dark hair, playing a Londoner?
Believe it. </PRE>
<P>SLIDING DOORS is a love 'what if' story. The gimmick is that it's really
two stories: the film follows the life of Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) down
two directions. In the beginning, likeable gal 'Helen' (Gwyneth Paltrow)
gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job. So she goes into the
subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and
her sleeping live-in lover Gerry (John Lynch). </P>
<P>Helen doesn't know it, but she is at a fateful junction in life: 1) If
she enters through the sliding door of a London subway train her life
takes one path with one future 2) If she stays on the platform her life
takes another path with a different future. The film shows what happens
in both paths, switching back and forth between intertwined, parallel
stories.</P>
<P>In story one, Helen meets a charming and talkative Monty Python fan
named James (John Hannah) on the train. Arriving home early, she
discovers that her live-in, Gerry (John Lynch), is having sex with his
former lover Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). This leads to a life where
Helen moves out. Helen's winsome new friend James helps her recover from
a broken heart, and encourages her to start her own business. </P>
<P>In story two, Helen experiences a different fate. She misses the train,
never meets James, and doesn't get home early enough to discover Gerry's
infidelity. In this new life, Helen takes up odd menial jobs, and faces
the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her
relationship with Gerry. </P>
<P>Will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of
problems and setbacks in BOTH scenarios?</P>
<P>Opinion:
Rejoice all ye Monty Python fans, Gwyneth Paltrow fans, and watchers of
quirky romance flicks. At last here's proof that there's still
creativity in 1990s filmmaking.</P>
<P>SLIDING DOORS is refreshingly different from anything this year. Not
only is it a well-acted, heartwarming film, but it's also easily Gwyneth
Paltrow's best recent performance. When Helen (Paltrow) screams that her
unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker,' (a British phrase better
left untranslated) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about!</P>
<P>Nor does SLIDING DOORS go overboard with formulaic true love or other
stereotypes. Nobody scrambles around in danger, screaming, "I will find
you no matter what, my darling!" When Helen finds herself on a boat in
the starlight with James, she doesn't take the easy way out and leap
into his arms, since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache. And
handsome live-in boyfriend Gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk
(either a stud or a snob). Instead he's a nervous and indecisive, almost
helpless hunk. Another example: when one of the protagonists lies
wounded in a hospital, SLIDING DOORS gives us neither the 'hospital
miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation.
In other words, all of the characters seem non-stereotyped, human, and
local. </P>
<P>There are minor inconveniences. Since SLIDING DOORS switches back and
forth between two possible fates, it's occasionally difficult to
distinguish between the two. Distinguishing between the two stories
isn't a problem in the scenes containing Paltrow, who sports two
different hairstyles. But in scenes containing only Lydia and Gerry, who
look the same in both stories, it's slightly confusing. Also, quite a
few snappy comebacks referring to American pop culture (Seinfeld, Woody
Allen, etc.) are spoken by the British characters. But these seem
slightly forced, given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly
British slang. Possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the
British so that American audiences can feel more comfortable?</P>
<P>SLIDING DOORS is a charming, quirky, original, happy romance with a
little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in.  MONTY PYTHON AND THE MEANING OF
FATE, anybody? </P>
