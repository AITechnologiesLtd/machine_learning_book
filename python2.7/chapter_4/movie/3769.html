<PRE>                                  POCAHONTAS
                       A film review by David G. Martin
                        Copyright 1995 David G. Martin</PRE>
<P>     Nobody was looking forwards to the premiere of POCAHONTAS more
than I.  As I ran out to my ride before the movie, my stomach was tied
in knots...  I was a nervous wreck.  Warned I would be disappointed,
scared by bad reviews and expectations lifted by good ones, I fearfully
awaited the verdict ... is Pocahontas a soaring success, or an overblown
failure?</P>
<P>     Walking out of the theatre, lost in contemplation, I would have
quietly voiced a "so-so" review, with a grade of "B-."  To say I was
disappointed isn't exactly it ... it was not what I was expecting.</P>
<P>     However, more than three days of heavy pondering have really
changed my opinion.  Be warned ... you cannot simply leave the theatre,
already having decided if the movie was "good" or "bad."  I have been
thinking about nothing but the movie for the past three days, and now I
think I truly understand it, and truly appreciate this film.</P>
<P>     POCAHONTAS is an experience completely unlike anything ever made
before.  Beneath the oddly-scripted, strangely-paced story lies a
beautiful, deeply spiritual film, a masterpiece in a category all its
own.</P>
<P>     You cannot assign a grade to this film: you cannot compare it to
any other movie.  I believe Pocahontas herself would have said that
'grading or comparing the movie is like chaining an eagle: you can do
it, and it makes the eagle easier to look at, but robs the creature of
its spirit and dignity.  Eagles were meant to soar, free as the "wild
mountain stream" ... and so is POCAHONTAS.</P>
<P>     The movie is not about love.  It is not about hate or even
misunderstanding.  It is about the Pocahontas in all of us, the
restless spirit who longs to bridge the chasm between what is right,
and what should be right (but it not), the Powhatan in us who clings to
what is familiar, and the John Smith who would like to gain the new
without losing the old.  It is a film about the savage in everyone, as
well as the nobility.  It is about truth, the truth that we are all the
same in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>     Pocahontas herself is the most memorable character in Disney
history.  Her double-edged gift is her indomitable curiosity and need
for change ... even though is leads her to many spiritual and physical
joys from the environment around her, it sets her apart from her
fellows.  She appeals to me because she is alone in her world, the only
world she knows... as are many of us today.  Yet, her blood is the same
blood as flows in her people, steady and smooth.  Thus, she both
respects tradition and thrives on change.  Not wild enough to be
special and understood by her people, nor traditional enough to be one
of them, Pocahontas is truly isolated psychologically, save for the
kindred Grandmother Willow, who cannot even begin to qualm her need for
adventure.  Nakoma, Pocahontas' best friend, has begun to pull away
from her ... for as they grow older, Nakoma is preparing herself for an
adult life, and hence slowly isolating herself from her friend.  Nakoma
is also as traditional as her people, and so can never really understand
Pocahontas.</P>
<P>     So then it is fated that John Smith and Pocahontas become
soul-mates, for he is her kindred spirit.  Smith too is alone in his
world, in the same way Pocahontas is.  His entire world has become
based around his reputation and his life abroad.  One gets the
impression that he has never been appreciated as a person, and so has
never really been emotionally secure in any way.  The men revere him,
but cannot see him as a friend, leaving him a man with himself.  He
treats everyone in a loose, aloof manner, so that he never faces
rejection or heartache.</P>
<P>     And spirit knows when meeting one of its own kind ... Pocahontas
and John Smith have more than the forbidden romance.  It is the only
relationship that either could ever be totally fulfilled by.</P>
<P>     Which is why the end is not tragic nor disturbingly sad.  John
Smith tells Pocahontas that they will always be together, and this
holds to the end.  They each carry a part of the other's soul, and so
no expanse of ocean will ever part them.</P>
<P>     And they have both gained something by the time they part,
something to fine and subtle to put a point on.  However, we know that
Pocahontas has found her calling ... to promote peace between the two
peoples that she is so close to, and John Smith now knows that it is
safe to love, and safe to treat other people with compassion and
respect.  He has learned to look at the world with praising, rather
than appraising, eyes.</P>
<P>     After saying that, I must get into the less spiritual aspects of
the film.  The animation, with the exception of some very badly drawn
scenes of the Englishmen towards the beginning and middle of the film,
is stirringly lush and spectacularly grand in scale.  The backgrounds
are sweepingly majestic, to the point of overwhelming.  The character
design leaves very little to be desired, with the possible exception of
Kekata, and the characters are truly realistic and move well.</P>
<P>     The voice actors are all exceptional.  Irene Bedard provided a
delightfully perky voice for Pocahontas, and Judy Kuhn as her singing
voice neared "too perfect to be real."  Russell Means did a stirring
and very real job as Powhatan.  However, Jim Cummings as the singing
voice of both Powhatan and Kekata sounded unfortunately off-key and
undignified.  Mel Gibson provided a wonderfully bravado voice for John
Smith, and Christian Bale was excellent as the charmingly apathetic
Thomas.  David Ogden Stiers, doing double duty as both Wiggins (who was
quite endearingly simpy) and Ratcliffe (who was blessedly obnoxious)
was lovely.  Billy Connolly and Joe Baker as Ben and Lon were both
amusing.  Linda Hunt is perfectly crackly as Grandmother Willow, and
Kocoum's voice (?) gives a good, solid performance, as did Kekata's
voice (?).  Unfortunately, Michelle St.John, while blessed with a great
voice, in times gave a mediocre and over-acted job, but the rest of the
time she did another solid performance.</P>
<P>     At any rate, this is a powerfully moving film, intensely moody and
unusually sensuous.  It truly deserves the name of POCAHONTAS, for it
is less of the legendary romance between John Smith and Pocahontas, and
more of one young woman's fight to save all that she loves while still
changing with her changing world.  The real Pocahontas (Matoaka?) would
have been proud of her legend.</P>
<P>     One request ... please do not walk into that theatre, expecting
ALADDIN or THE LION KING.  POCAHONTAS is neither.  If you expect a
whimsical fable, go elsewheres.  POCAHONTAS is a grave, adult account
of a dark time in American history.  This film is not a masterpiece ...
it was not intended to be one.  It is a unique and moving film, and not
quite like anything you will ever see again.</P>
<P>     And it easily deserves a place among the spiritually rousing films
of all time.</P>
<PRE>BEST MENTIONS GO TO...</PRE>
<P>Animation: Meeko (Nik Ranieri), who was absolutely delightful.
Voice Acting: Irene Bedard (Pocahontas), who conveyed love, anger, fear,
curiosity, and a number of other emotions that I can't even name.
Character Design: Pocahontas (Glen Keane), who also gets kudos for best
                  hair stylist. :-)
Song: "Just Around the River Bend."  While not as meaningful as "Colors of
      the Wind," it is a wonderfully spritely song sung by the astounding
      Judy Kuhn.</P>
<PRE>DECIDED WORST OF THE BUNCH...</PRE>
<P>Animation: Nakoma (Duncan Majoribanks) who was a constant appearance
           disappointment.
Voice Acting: Kekata (?), who was rather dry and predictable.
Character Design: Nakoma again, who looks like she could just as easily
                  star in THE LEGEND OF FA MULAN.
Song: "Listen With Your Heart," for being too depressingly short.</P>
