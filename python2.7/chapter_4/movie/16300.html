<P>        Even apart from the possible religious controversey,
Dreamworks has taken a serious financial risk with their first
animated release, "The Prince of Egypt."  Not only have they
done the unthinkable (challenge the supremacy of "The Mouse"
in the field of feature-length animation), they've chosen a
topic with the potential to offend as many as it entertains.
There's also the strong possibility that the film's target
audience, children, may not wish to attend a "religious" movie,
which often has the stigma of boredom attached to it, even
when animated.</P>
<P>        But never fear: Dreamworks has created an entertaining
film that can be enjoyed even by those who have little interest
in the Bible.  Setting aside the stoic morality lessons that
religious epics so often attempt to convey, "The Prince of Egypt"
is a fun, fast gallop through the Old Testament's Book of Exodus,
covering the life of Moses beginning with his mother's desperate
attempt to save his life, and culminating with his deliverance of
the Ten Commandments to the Hebrews.  But although the movie's
tone is often light-hearted and comical, it finds a striking
balance with the seriousness and drama that source material of
this nature demands.  It's a delicate high-wire act, but the film
doesn't stumble.</P>
<P>        Moses (voiced by Val Kimer) and Ramses (voiced by Ralph
Finnes, whose career seems to be recovering nicely after "The
Avengers") are sons of the Pharoah Seti (an excellent vocal
performance from Star Trek's Patrick Stewart).  Wild and carefree,
the two boys are the best of friends, in addition to being brothers.
This changes after Moses learns the truth from his sister Miriram
(Sandra Bullock): he is not the true son of the Pharoah after all.
Leaving behind the only life he has ever known, Moses wanders into
the desert and finds contentment and happiness with a band of
gypsies.  Eventually, however, God speaks to him and reveals
Moses's true mission: free the Hebrews from the grip of the
tyranical new Pharoah... who happens to be none other than his
former "brother," Ramses.  This is the stuff of which great
drama is made, and the film wisely concentrates the majority of
its screen-time with the difficult relationship between these two
young men, each uncomfortable with their new animosity... but
both nonetheless unyielding in their beliefs.  The vocal
performances by Kilmer and Finnes are excellent, with each
properly conveying the tone and frustration that each character
possesses.</P>
<P>        Visually, "The Prince of Egypt" is overflowing with
stunning moments and incredible imagery; in fact, I believe that
it contains the highest quality animation I've ever seen in an
American film.  The alternating seriousness and comedy works
very well, each providing an intriguing counterpoint to the other,
yet never detracting from the epic qualities of the story.  (And to
my great delight, Dreamworks didn't feel the need to throw in any
cute, talking animals with a fondness for singing and dancing.)
The influence of Disney is felt in one significant way, however:
musical numbers, and plenty of 'em.  Although they're not bad when
taken on their own, I observed that on a few occasions they greatly
hindered the story's pacing.  A minor flaw, perhaps, but I frequently
found myself waiting for the tunes to end so I could get back to the
actual plotline, which interested me far more.</P>
<P>        "The Prince of Egypt" is nonetheless a cinematic triumph,
offering proof that Disney doesn't have a monopoly on quality
American animation.  Parents should be aware, however, that this
movie is rated "PG," rather than the tamer "G" that most Disney
films receive.  It has a number of intense moments which could
conceivably scare younger members of the family: the
slaughtering of the Egyptian first-borns gave *me* chills, as did
Moses's eerie "hyroglyphics" dream sequence; also, some of the
children at the screening I attended seemed quite frightened by
the sight of Pharoah's hordes descending down upon the Hebrews
at the Red Sea.  You're the best judge of what your kids can
handle, but do be aware that moments of the film are quite livid.
But if you can handle it, you're in a for a treat.</P>
