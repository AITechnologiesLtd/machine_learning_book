<P>SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE  **1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers (<A HREF="mailto:bill@filmfreakcentral.net">bill@filmfreakcentral.net</A>)</P>
<P>starring John Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, Catherine McCormack, Eddie Izzard
screenplay by Steven Katz
directed by E. Elias Merhige</P>
<P>They certainly dressed the part, in those days. John Malkovich's reading of 
the eminent German filmmaker F.W. Murnau declares: "We are scientists 
engaged in the creation of memory." On set, before the lamps are fired up, 
Murnau and his crew don tinted goggles, looking as if they're about to 
commence atomic testing.</P>
<P>This was standard practice during cinema's formative years, when it took an 
intense amount of light to satisfactorily expose an image. (It was not 
uncommon for those who didn't take precautions to go blind later in life.) 
But Malkovich/Murnau is not describing costumes; he's probably, in fact, 
speaking for the makers of the gothic comedy in which he appears as a 
central figure, Shadow of the Vampire. Director E. Elias Merhige, working 
from a screenplay by Steven Katz, forges a new memoir of Nosferatu, 
Murnau's take on Bram Stoker's Dracula that was rumoured to star a real 
vampire.</P>
<P>Said quote defends the existence of Shadow of the Vampire with mock 
pretension, and it recognizes the outlandish notion that someone might 
accept Merhige's movie at face value, just as Gladiator has probably 
inspired audience members everywhere to query "Maximus" at their favourite 
search engines. And for the duration that Merhige and Katz have tongues 
planted firmly in cheek, their efforts are generously funny, even if some 
of the humour seems anachronistic (there are big laughs at the expense of 
writers and students of the Stanislavsky Method, both of which can be found 
in any send-up of modern Hollywood). Take Willem Dafoe, unrecognizable 
beneath thick latex as Max Schreck, the bloodsucking lead in Murnau's 
production. The uniquely charming actor, one of the few to not embarrass 
himself in portraying Jesus Christ, isn't only asked to deliver jokes in a 
Transylvania 6-5000 accent: his Schreck spoofs the archetypal tragic 
vampyr--Dafoe is playing a mostly cranky, forgetful old man whose major 
affliction is an empty stomach.</P>
<P>Merhige also subverts Weimar-era artistic types with a general tweaking of 
Murnau's clan. Shadow of the Vampire depicts an egotistical helmer who 
doles out information to his peers on a need-to-know basis, a diva starlet 
(Catherine McCormack) with more, but no less insincere, respect for the 
theatre, an alcoholic, Aryan flyboy cameraman (Cary Elwes, channelling 
Klaus Kinski?), and so on. There is the implication, not made strongly 
enough, that Schreck is the most harmless vampire of them all, and even the 
suggestion is indicative of Shadow of the Vampire's reductionist leanings. 
The characters are more behaviourally than conceptually effective--thank 
goodness for the unvaryingly fine performances. I'd love to join the 
critical community in their unanimous adoration of the film, but it occurs 
to me the film's premise has one note and strikes it half-heartedly.</P>
<P>While Merhige nails the nuances of a fascinating period in twentieth 
century history (save a passage of dialogue that equates Murnau's greatness 
with Eisenstein's, who wasn't known at the time of Nosferatu)--the 
painstaking recreation of Murnau's hand-cranked footage is particularly 
arresting--I sympathized a bit too dearly with Schreck, who desires flesh; 
I yearned for something more fleshed-out than this bizarro sitcom. 
Additionally, Shadow of the Vampire is faced with the dilemma of having to 
end, and this is when faux self-importance gives way to something blurrier. 
A witty, not-scathing-enough satire turns nasty and alienatingly 
moralistic. The gifted Merhige should have listened to the advice of many a 
scientist before him: "Back to the drawing board." (--- For more first-run,
