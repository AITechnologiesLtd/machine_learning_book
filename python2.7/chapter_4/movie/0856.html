<PRE>                                  HOME ALONE
                              [Probable Spoilers]
                       A film review by Jaye Mathisen
                        Copyright 1990 Jaye Mathisen</PRE>
<PRE>     Summary:
     A young boy's family forgets to take him on their
     vacation to Paris.  Thrills and spills abound as
     we follow Kevin around the house, doing all the
     things he's ever wanted to do.  Of course, there's
     the obligatory bad guy who's vanquished in the
     end.</PRE>
<P>     I wasn't expecting much going to this film.  How funny can it be to
watch some wild child and his antics around the house while his parents
are gone?  The answer is: Not very.  Oh sure, there are some funny
moments, and some of the situations are amusing, but this is definitely
a movie that appeals to younger people than me.</P>
<P>     The biggest problems with the film are all the contrived things
that appear throughout the show.  There are also some odd asides that
have to be chalked up to "let's get a laugh," rather than some real
need.  The plot is all too predictable, and while there is occasionally
some inspiring camera work, young Macauly Culkin doesn't really have
what it takes to carry a whole movie yet.  Yes, he's funny, and he has
some great bits, but as a whole, he just didn't pack it.</P>
<P>     I should mention that as a "grown-up," I didn't really get a kick
out of it, but if the gales of hysterical laughter coming from about
every child in the theater are any clue, this movie has gobs and gobs of
appeal to the much younger crowd.  Perhaps they can relate better to
some of Kevin's family problems which appeared out of nowhere.</P>
<P>Rating:
     Take your kids to it, but if you don't have any, or can't get ahold
of some, then skip this one.  It's not trash, it's just not great.  2
stars (**) on the old 1 to 4 star scale.</P>
