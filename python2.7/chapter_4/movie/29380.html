<P>Synopsis: Before heading off to Harvard Law School, wealthy Warner 
(Matthew Davis) breaks up with Valley girlfriend Elle (Witherspoon) 
because she doesn't fit his image of a future Senator's wife. Nonplussed, 
Elle enrolls at Harvard to win Warner back, only to find herself looked 
down upon by faculty and students alike. Determined to prove herself, Elle 
wins a role as an assistant on a defense team for a murder trial, 
alongside kindly eccentric Emmett (Wilson), Warner... and Warner's new 
fiancee, Vivian (Blair).</P>
<P>Review: Proving again that Reese Witherspoon is one of the best comedy 
actresses of her generation, "Legally Blonde" is a joy from start to 
finish. A simple fish-out-of-water story at heart, rarely has the genre 
been blessed with such wit and verve. Elle would seem ludicrous if she 
wasn't so well-acted; neither too ditzy nor too smart, Witherspoon finds a 
happy medium which never grates and is genuinely endearing. The script by 
Lutz and Smith succeeds on several levels. Not only is it hilarious from 
beginning to end, but the laughs derive naturally out of the given 
scenario; there are no extraneous, grafted-on hijinks here. And, most 
importantly, real pathos is generated for Elle; when she finds herself the 
butt of student jokes and professorial scorn, it is hard for viewers not 
to be reminded of occasions when we've felt like we're in something over 
our heads. If "Legally Blonde" has a flaw, it's that none of the 
supporting characters can compete with Elle: this really is a one woman 
show. Nonetheless, good performances are turned in by Blair as the
supercilious Vivian, and by Jennifer Coolidge as Elle's hapless beautician 
confidante, Paulette. Only Wilson's Emmett feels somewhat out of place, 
his role as plot catalyst proving rather too obvious. Regardless, "Legally 
Blonde" may be this summer's best non-animated comedy.</P>
