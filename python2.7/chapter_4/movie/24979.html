<P>     Late in Mike Figgis' experimental drama TIMECODE, a young would-be
film-maker pitches an idea to a Hollywood production company for a film
shot on digital video, following four characters in real time in one
uninterrupted take ... at which suggestion one of the production
executives bursts into laughter and calls the idea "pretentious." It seems
like Figgis is trying to have a little fun at his own expense, since that
pitched idea is exactly the idea behind TIMECODE: four characters followed
in real time, the screen divided into four quadrants to follow their
individual stories. And it would be easier to buy Figgis' self-deprecation
as genuine if he didn't then begin his closing credits with a caption
describing exactly how the film had been made. "Look what an interesting
and original film you've just watched," Figgis says to us out of one
corner of his mouth, while the other mutters, "And it was all just a big
pretentious joke."</P>
<P>     Figgis has been on a kick in the last couple of years of trying to
stretch cinematic boundaries, but it's too often too difficult to get past
his art-for-art's-sake bluster. In TIMECODE, he takes a fairly mundane
90-minutes-in-the-life story and tries to spice it up with his four-play. 
One segment of his screen opens with a therapy session involving a woman
named Emma (Saffron Burrows), describing her marital dissatisfaction. 
Eventually we learn that her husband is Alex Green (Stellan Skarsgaard),
the aforementioned chuckling production executive. Alex is an addict and
an alcoholic barely hanging on to awareness of his business, though he has
enough time for an affair with aspiring actress Rose (Salma Hayek). 
Unfortunately, Rose's lover and sugar mama Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn) 
suspects that something is up, and spends the afternoon checking up on
Rose after planting a microphone on her.</P>
<P>     TIMECODE was essentially improvised around a loose plot structure,
leading to a predictably ragged feel to the film. And while Figgis would
probably emphasize that raggedness as a function of the film's realism and
immediacy, it simply doesn't make for particularly engrossing viewing a
lot of the time. At times TIMECODE is a satire of film industry poseurs,
and occasionally a very funny one. Steven Weber does a great
straight-faced description of a potential Matt Stone-Trey Parker project
called TIME TOILET -- a comedy about a janitor who discovers a portal
through time in a commode -- as having "educational value," all while a
masseur (Julian Sands) caresses his earlobes. Then Figgis will turn up the
volume on Burrows pining over her unhappy life, and we'll take a quick
right turn into melodrama. Most intrusive of all is the use of a series of
earthquakes as a device to shake up the lives of the characters. In a more
conventional film, it might have been easier to forgive the obvious and
repetitive symbolism. In a film like TIMECODE, you begin wondering when
Figgis will ever take off his avant-garde hat and just let a story be a
story.</P>
<P>     I might have considered TIMECODE a thoroughly failed experiment if
not for a development that briefly justifies the entire structure. During
one stretch of the film, Tripplehorn listens in on a tryst between Rose
and Alex that takes place behind the screen of a screening room while
other executives watch audition clips of actresses playing a sex scene. In
a conventionally edited film, the director might cut back and forth
between the encounter and the jealous lover in her headphones, giving us
only the moment of realization as a payoff. In TIMECODE, I was able to
watch Tripplehorn throughout the scene, from her puzzled but intent face
as the background noise from the screening room prevents her from hearing
Rose, to the anguish that overwhelms her once it's impossible to deny the
truth. Film too rarely allows us to watch actors do purely physical
acting. I was so fascinated by Tripplehorn's wordless performance that I
rarely took my eyes off of her quadrant of the screen, even when there was
dialogue coming from elsewhere.</P>
<P>     I'd gladly accept a structure like that in TIMECODE if it meant I
could spend time following interesting supporting characters instead of
blank-faced bores like Burrows' depressed Hollywood wife. Of course, I'd
prefer it if a film-maker acknowledged the importance of developing
character and story, rather than assuming falsely that improvisation is
always the best way to get at the "truth" of a situation. No moment makes
that fallacy more evident than a scene at a production meeting when a
musician responds with a snicker to an Asian woman's introduction of
herself as "Connie Ling." The snicker itself was a completely believable
reaction; the woman's puzzled expression, as though she had never before
in her life heard a joke about her name, strains all credulity. A director
doing the job of directing might have taken that opportunity to coach the
actress that anyone who grew up on Planet Earth would have been taunted
mercilessly throughout her adolescence for having the name "Connie Ling," 
and therefore might not respond as thought the character had just been
dropped from the sky that afternoon. Figgis, however, never intrudes on
his experiment in realism, not even so it might make more real-world
sense. All that remains is his self-congratulation at doing something
entirely new, even if it ultimately feels mostly like a big pretentious
joke.</P>
