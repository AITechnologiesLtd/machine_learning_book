<PRE>                          No Lemons in CADILLAC MAN
                       A film review by Elisabeth Riba
                        Copyright 1990 Elisabeth Riba</PRE>
<P>     CADILLAC MAN opens with shots of a cemetery.  An unlikely place to
begin a movie about cars ... until we focus on the procession stalled
by a broken hearse.  Not only does Robin Williams, the consummate
salesman, pitch the undertaker, he also hits on the widow.</P>
<P>     Despite this sell-at-all-costs attitude (or perhaps because of it)
Williams doesn't move the cars as fast as he once did.  His problems
pile on quickly.  He can't resist the ladies, juggling three of them as
the film starts.  To help meet his expenses, he owes massive debts to
some not-so-savory sources.  And then he receives an ultimatum.
Williams will lose his job unless he can sell twelve cars in two days.</P>
<P>     That sets up a tidy plot--Robin Williams does DEATH OF A SALESMAN.
But just as you think you've got the movie straightened out, it throws
you a curve.  Tim Robbins (BULL DURHAM) takes the dealership hostage.
You see, his wife is having an affair with someone in the office, and he
wants to know who.  Only Williams' practiced patter can free them.</P>
<P>     I found this movie the funniest I've seen all year.  It doesn't
reflect as sharp a vision as other black comedies, but it also isn't as
cruel.</P>
<P>     Generally, the minor characters portrayed broad stereotypes.
However, strong acting took them past the familiar territory.  Both of
Williams' girlfriends had strong personalities, although his ex-wife
seemed rather bland.  Likewise, the other salesmen seemed to blend
together, although the customers all sharply define themselves.</P>
<P>     Tim Robbins basically reprises his role of befuddled innocent from
BULL DURHAM.  All he wants to know was "Who did Donna?"  As his plot
falls apart, his frustration is evident.  He honestly never expected
police to show up.  When they request his demands, he only wants them to
go away.  Despite the situation, you soon sympathize with him.</P>
<P>     Robin Williams is quite credible as the sleazy salesman.  He knows
the reputation and lives up to it.  Williams narrates the bridges and
slower scenes, the camera an invisible passenger in his car.  I found
this technique distracting at times, although his points were often
valid.</P>
<P>     Robin Williams has definitely graduated from the pack of Seventies'
comics.  While much of the SNL/SCTV crowd has stagnated, he takes us
from laughs to near tears in seconds.  If future movies continue in the
vein of CADILLAC MAN and DEAD POETS' SOCIETY, I can see Robin Williams
winning an Oscar within the next decade.</P>
<P>     The language seemed unnecessarily strong, but didn't detract too
much from the story.  Otherwise, it was a marvelous film.  The
soundtrack consisted of older tunes.  In some ways, this added to the
image of Robin Williams as a dying breed.</P>
<P>     Although I enjoy most movies, I'm offering unequivocal praise here.
See this film and do so soon.  I'm afraid that the summer blockbusters
will roll CADILLAC MAN right out of the theaters.  But that's a shame,
because this definitely deserves a test drive.</P>
