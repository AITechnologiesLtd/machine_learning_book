LOVING JEZEBEL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Nerdish-looking Theodurus Melville (Hill Harper) is an awkward and 
childishly obnoxious Don Juan.  His idea of a come-on is to tell a woman 
that he thought of her face instead of the Mona Lisa's during his 
college history class.  He likes to run after women, almost slobbering 
as he asks them on dates.  And when he gets them into bed, he is so 
unskillful that you wonder what any of them see in him.</P>
<P>Writer and director Kwyn Bader's LOVING JEZEBEL is the second film this 
month about a black comedian who pursues a long string of women.  Tim 
Meadows, as Leon Phelps in THE LADIES MAN, was sweet, smooth and 
eminently likeable.  In contrast, Theodurus is such a born loser that he 
seems constantly in danger of tying his shoelaces together.  The 
unrealistic story never convinces us that so many women would be 
attracted to him.  And with its non-stop use of voice-over, the movie 
wants badly to be taken as a poignant coming of age story as well as a 
comedy.  It succeeds at neither.</P>
<P>Typical of the unreality of the plot is the character of Frances (Nicole 
Ari Parker).  She swears that she is a virgin who doesn't drink, which, 
of course, is a double lie.  When Theodurus goes to her dorm room to 
pick her up for their first date, this shunner of sexuality comes to the 
door in her underwear.  She then proceeds to do a reverse strip, 
fondling herself in the process.  Maybe some directors could have gotten 
great comedic mileage out of this scene but not Bader.  The whole 
episode just feels strange and is devoid of humor.  </P>
<P>"Just once," Frances coos at the beginning of her long night of sex with 
Theodurus.  "You're not going to make me do it again."  But the movie 
keeps making us see these same clumsily and unconvincingly staged scenes 
over and over again.  LOVING JEZEBEL is the sort of film that should 
make people appreciate THE LADIES MAN more.  It was certainly a lot more 
fun.</P>
<P>LOVING JEZEBEL runs 1:25.  It is rated R for language and sexuality and 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
