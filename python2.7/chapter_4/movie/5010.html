                       A film review by Randy Parker

<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        DEAD-BANG, an action thriller starring Don Johnson, lives up to its
dumb title, or at least to half of it.  Although DEAD-BANG is definitely
dead, it is anything but a bang; in fact, they should have called this one
"Dead Bore."</P>
<P>        In the film, Johnson plays ... you guessed it ... a cop.  The role
must have been really challenging for Johnson since his character, Jerry
Beck, is a gritty Los Angeles homicide detective, a real stretch from the
slick vice detective Johnson portrayed on "Miami Vice."  A la Mel Gibson in
LETHAL WEAPON, Beck is an emotional wreck, complete with violent outbursts,
unscrupulous police methods, and a bleak outlook on life.  Beck's wife has
just divorced him, and she is cutting him off from their children.  She
will not even allow him to wish them "Merry Christmas" by telephone.  But
Beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and
thrills in DEAD-BANG.  Beck is investigating the brutal murders of a
shopkeeper and a cop.  His investigation starts in L.A. and finally
culminates and climaxes in Oklahoma, where he has a violent showdown with
the killers at a white supremacist camp.</P>
<P>        Virtually every aspect of DEAD-BANG is inept and ineffective.  The
plot is incoherent and full of holes.  The movie depicts Beck's
investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his
clues and his conclusions.  The action sequences in DEAD-BANG are strictly
third-rate, and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense.  I
certainly expected more from long-time director John Frankenheimer who
directed the classic political thriller, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE--as well
as BLACK SUNDAY, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, and THE FRENCH CONNECTION II.  In all
fairness to Frankenheimer, however, I should note that most of DEAD-BANG's
shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the
direction.</P>
<P>        DEAD-BANG tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating
themes of racism and white supremacy, but its efforts are nothing more than
token gestures and nothing less than insulting.  According to the movie's
production notes, DEAD-BANG is based on the real-life experiences of
still-active detective Jerry Beck.  You would never guess this from
watching DEAD-BANG, however, since the film totally lacks credibility; it
is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable.</P>
<P>        Most of the characters in DEAD-BANG are either atrociously acted,
underdeveloped, superfluous, or all of the above.  William Forsythe, for
example, is painfully bad as Arthur Kressler, a wholesome by-the-book FBI
agent who's offended by Beck's foul language and unorthodox methods.
Forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character
unbearable.  DEAD-BANG marks the motion picture debut of Tim Reid ("WKRP In
Cincinnati" and "Frank's Place"), but his talents are completely wasted in
a cliched and contrived role; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of
black cops who help Beck to nail the villains.  The sole function of
Penelope Ann Miller's character is to give DEAD-BANG an excuse to include a
gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care
less.  I guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's
definitely a dead bang.</P>
<P>        The only real virtue of DEAD-BANG, believe it or not, is Don
Johnson, who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful
script.  Johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of
humor and a hint of depth, and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally
bring the film to life.  And I must admit that DEAD-BANG does have one or
two amusing moments.  The funniest scene has Johnson throwing-up all over a
criminal as he interrogates him.  But when barf is the highlight of a
movie, you know the movie's in trouble.  The other amusing scene involves a
psychological examination of Beck, in which he can't keep a straight face
because the psychiatrist resembles Woody Allen.  But two funny scenes and a
couple good wisecracks do not a movie make.</P>
