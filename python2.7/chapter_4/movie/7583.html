<P>     Since 1996's release of COLD FEVER, Fredrik Thor Fridriksson is no=20
longer Iceland's best-kept secret.  His first English-language film,=20
which featured an international cast (including former independent queen=20
Lili Taylor, who has since lost her title to Parker Posey), a=20
spectacular setting, and an effective mix of comedy and drama, informed=20
the world that Iceland, despite claiming more sheep than people, has a=20
film industry.  In DEVIL'S ISLAND, Fridriksson's latest, the director=20
takes a time trip to his native land during the 1950s. =20</P>
<P>     In some ways, DEVIL'S ISLAND is like another Fridriksson film,=20
MOVIE DAYS.  Both offer glimpses through windows into the past and each=20
emphasizes one of the film maker's recurring themes:  the pervasive=20
influence of American culture on Icelandic society.  In MOVIE DAYS,=20
Fridriksson showed how, in 1964, every child in the country was addicted=20
to American music, movies, and television.  Going ten more years into=20
the past for DEVIL'S ISLAND, he shows that things weren't much different=20
in post-war Iceland, where the Americans had just abandoned their=20
military base of Camp Thule.</P>
<P>     After the departure of the U.S. military, the abandoned base,=20
located in Iceland's largest city, Reykjavik, became a home for the=20
downtrodden -- those who couldn't earn enough to afford a better shelter=20
than the falling-down barracks.  It's here, in Camp Thule, that we meet=20
the Tomasson family.  There's old Karolina and her husband, Tommi (G=EDsli=
=20
Halld=F3rsson, who played the drunken old man at the end of COLD FEVER),=20
who live under the same roof as their three grandchildren -- Baddi, a=20
young rebel with an Elvis fixation; Danni, a shy recluse forever in his=20
brother's shadow when it comes to friends and women; and Dolli, a young=20
mother who is frustrated with married life.  Life is hard in the camp,=20
but alcohol flows freely, and, when Baddi starts bringing his drunk=20
friends home for post-midnight rock-and-roll parties, tensions within=20
the house threaten to explode.</P>
<P>     Throughout his films, Fridriksson has never been judgmental about=20
the Americanization of Icelandic culture.  While one could see DEVIL'S=20
ISLAND as an indictment of that trend -- more negative effects than=20
positive ones are shown -- exactly the opposite was true in MOVIE DAYS,=20
which reflected the director's own childhood experiences.  Rather than=20
making a specific political statement, Fridriksson is attempting to=20
present an honest (if occasionally nostalgic) depiction of how things=20
were.  While it's true that Baddi loves American rock music and=20
clothing, and cops a James Dean attitude, his disaffection with life=20
comes from someplace deep within.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most compelling aspect of DEVIL'S ISLAND is the not-so-
friendly brotherly rivalry between Baddi and Danni.  Even though Baddi=20
is revered in the neighborhood while Danni is regarded with thinly-
veiled contempt, the Elvis-like rebel delights in humiliating his=20
socially inept sibling.  Ultimately, however, it's Baddi who remains=20
tied to the ground while Danni is given the opportunity to soar, even if=20
there is a bittersweet twist to this.  Fridriksson finds the core of=20
truth in the relationship between these two, and polishes it to near-
perfection. =20</P>
<P>     Unlike COLD FEVER, which was as much a spiritual journey as a=20
physical one, DEVIL'S ISLAND isn't especially ambitious.  In the end,=20
it's really just a simple tale of the sometimes-comic, sometimes-tragic=20
struggles of one family.  But it's beautifully photographed and well-
written, and those qualities make for an enjoyable motion picture. =20
Though a less "global" movie than its predecessor, DEVIL'S ISLAND=20
deserves the same level of attention accorded to COLD FEVER.</P>
