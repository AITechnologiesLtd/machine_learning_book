<P>     We lasted thirty minutes in this one.  FLIPPER is what I call a
"cinematic black hole," a film so utterly flat-- so completely non-
compelling-- that almost nothing escapes from the screen for the
audience to connect with.  As a teenager spending the summer with his
Florida fisherman uncle, Elijah Wood (THE WAR) is a comatose kid
walking.  He speaks without a hint of inflection in his voice and barely
animates the muscles in his face.  What, was he afraid to outperform the
fish?  Or did he learn a little too much from his WAR co-star Kevin
Costner?  Paul Hogan isn't much better.  The Aussie actor displays
about, oh, one-tenth of the screen charisma that he brought to the role
of "Crocodile" Dundee.  The minimalist plot has something to do with a
dolphin, a hurricane, and a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert.  Oh yeah, and
we heard the word "dioxin" mentioned.  For those kids who have never
seen underwater footage nor visited an aquarium nor vacationed at Sea
World, FLIPPER might be worth a watch.  As for the rest of the western
world... well, I can't think of a single reason to sit through this
movie.</P>
