<PRE>                          THE QUICK AND THE DEAD
                       A film review by Steven Krut
                        Copyright 1995 Steven Krut</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of *****)</PRE>
<P>     This movie has been out for a while, but is still showing at
second run theaters.  See it on the big screen if you can, but if
that's not possible, this is a MUST RENT at the video store.  Here's
why:</P>
<P>        THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is quite simply the most viscerally 
exciting western ever produced.  This is due to the plot which is 
contrived (and I do mean contrived) to provide a full-throttled, 
HIGH NOON-style show down virtually every ten minutes of the film.  
The pretext for this action is a quick draw tournament organized by 
the town's oppressive boss, Herod (Gene Hackman).  It's sort of like 
Wimbledon for shootists.  There is, of course, no logical reason why 
so many people would be so willing to participate in such a deadly 
contest, but at least Herod has a solid rationale for holding the 
event.  As he explains midway through the film, the tournament allows 
him to confront his enemies face to face instead of having them sneak 
up from behind.  And he certainly has a lot of enemies. Every one of 
the Redemption's (the town) citizens would love to see him six feet 
under, and together they've secretly hired a professional gunman to 
take him out.  The newly arrived drifter, Ellen (Sharon Stone), also 
wants him dead.  Even Herod's illegitimate son, Kid, (Leonardo 
DiCaprio) wishes nothing more than to put a bullet through his 
father's brain (in order to gain his respect).  DiCaprio's 
performance, by the way, as a determined buckaroo ablaze with 
youthful arrogance is one of the films brightest spots.  As is Gene 
Hackman's performance.  Portraying the maniacally evil Herod, he 
generates a palpable menace.  His mere presence gives the film a 
solid grounding - just the right amount of realism to offset some of 
the movie's more whimsical qualities.</P>
<P>        The story, though, revolves around Sharon Stone's character, 
Ellen, who in the film's catalogue of stock Western stereotypes 
corresponds to the Clint Eastwood character - the cool, steel-eyed 
stranger who rides into town with a mysterious agenda.  The decision 
by Simon Moore, the script writer, to give the story a female hero is 
both the film's greatest strength and weakness.  It's a weakness really 
in a marketing sense since, judging from the film's poor box office 
performance, the predominantly male audience for Westerns isn't ready 
for a strong woman gun slinger.  This I know from personal 
experience, since I am (or was) one of these men.  I didn't see this 
movie when it first came out because I was turned off by the trailer 
showing a tough, squint-eyed Sharon Stone slinging bullets with the 
baddest dudes the West had to offer.  I just didn't buy it.  Women 
aren't tough, at least I don't want them to be.  Not tough like 
Clint, anyway.  And besides, it isn't historically accurate.  
Everyone knows there were no women gun slingers in the Wild West.  
Certainly none as stunningly beautiful as Sharon Stone.  I imagined 
the film to be a blatant feminist attempt to show that women can be 
just as ruthless and cold-hearted as men.</P>
<P>        When I finally saw the movie, however, I realized I'd jumped 
to a pig-headed conclusion.  First of all, because the movie doesn't 
pretend to be recreating a historically accurate vision of the Old 
West, it doesn't really matter whether there were women like Ellen 
back then or not.  Secondly, Stone does a good job of showing that 
Ellen's toughness is really a front, that underneath she's afraid 
and struggling for courage.  This makes her human and thus believable.  
The script helps Ms. Stone out by giving Ellen a strong motivation for 
becoming such an expert shootist.  The result is the first completely 
believable female gun-slinging hero.  It's a fairly noteworthy 
achievement, actually, and one which ultimately enhances the film by 
providing a fresh twist on what otherwise would have been just another 
cliched character.</P>
<P>        Speaking of cliches, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is rife with 
them.  This is a deliberate artistic choice by Mr. Moore who gleefully 
piles every hackneyed Western convention in on top of the story, 
twisting and stretching each one into a cartoonish parody of itself. 
It's most evident in the gunplay which is some of wildest, most 
stylized gunplay ever seen.  I mentioned earlier that the film 
doesn't try to accurately recreate the Old West.  Instead, it builds 
its own hyperactive version.  This is a turbo-Western. The emphasis 
here is not on character development or plot intricacies, but on 
sheer heart-pounding adrenaline.  The story, such as it is, unfolds 
as a quasi-parable and in this respect is similar to HIGH PLAINS 
DRIFTER.  Unfortunately, also like HPD, it isn't clear what the 
parable is about.  Still, there are some intriguing moments involving 
Cort (Russell Crowe).  Cort is a former member of Herod's gang who 
has renounced violence.  He's become a priest and the scenes where 
Herod parades him, shackled and beaten, before a taunting crowd have 
a vague relevance to them. I got the impression a comparison was 
being attempted to present day America and/or the New Testament.  
But the theme isn't followed-up as the cruel tournament advances 
relentlessly, one bloody duel after another.</P>
<P>        Sam Raimi, the director, is perfectly suited to this kind 
of script.  You may be familiar with him from the "Evil Dead" movies 
and DARKMAN.  He has an eccentric visual style to put it mildly, but 
to his credit he's fairly restrained here.  The only time he really 
lets loose is during the actual showdowns and then his inventiveness 
serves to heighten the drama.  The camera zooms in on the 
antagonists' eyes, then on the clock about to strike noon, then 
follows the bullets as they whiz through the air.  Special effects 
and striking camera angles pump up the tension to a fantastic pitch. 
These are the most thrilling gun duels I've ever seen. Any single 
one of them could easy serve as the climax for a more modest film, 
but here they come fast and loose in a glorious string of Western 
carnage.  Great stuff.</P>
<P>        One flaw, though, is the film's ending which is formulaic.  
I suppose it's a reasonable enough wrap-up considering the nature of 
the story, but since the film was so witty all the way through, I 
was expecting something more original.  What happens is this:  Evil, 
which has kicked Good's butt all the way through the film, is 
closing in for the kill when, with a burst of inspiration, the 
heroes avoids tragedy by employing a clever though highly improbable 
gimmick.  The tables are turned, most of the set blows up real good, 
and the bad guys get what's coming to them.  I don't think I'm 
giving anything away by revealing this.  This is a Hollywood movie, 
after all.  How else did you think it was going to end?</P>
<P>        Minor complaints aside, however, I have to say that THE 
QUICK AND THE DEAD really has a lot going for it.  This is a movie which 
succeeds at everything it attempts.  It's funny, clever, compelling 
and even breaks new ground for female leads.  It's also full of 
great performances.  What more do you want from a movie?  </P>
