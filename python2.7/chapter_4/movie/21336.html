<P>Cinematic stories about an introspective journey are among the most
difficult to tell.  So, telling a story about two such journeys
simultaneously is understandably twice as hard.  Director Rob Reiner's
(THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT) latest work, THE STORY OF US, is a strange
mixture of a movie.  Combining comedy and drama, pathos with vulgar sexual
bantering, the film contains both hits and misses but ultimately doesn't
quite succeed in sustaining an emotional connection with its audience.</P>
<P>Ben (Bruce Willis, THE SIXTH SENSE) and Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer, THE
DEEP END OF THE OCEAN) Jordan have been married for fifteen years.  They
have produced two delightful children and the four of them appear to be
enjoying a wonderful life together.  The trouble is, whenever the kids
leave the room, the life leaves with them.  Over time, whatever kindled
the spark of this marriage has long since died out.</P>
<P>The movie focuses on the Jordans' attempts to present a happy facade for
their children's sake even while each is trying to figure out what went
wrong in the marriage and why.  He is more of a free spirited
individual... A fun and spontaneous kind of guy.  She, on the other hand,
feels pressed to be the responsible one of the duo.  And after fifteen
years of being the "designated driver," she resents it.</P>
<P>Using a series of flashbacks, voice-overs, and interviews (a la WHEN
HARRY MET SALLY), Mr. Reiner explores the effect that everyday "life" has
on a marriage relationship. The Jordans move from a happy, sexually
compatible, vibrantly fun couple (seen in the flashbacks) to a pair of
individuals who allow the minor irritations of idiosyncratic behavior to
build and fester until it reaches intolerable levels.  The film's chopped
up structure is used to try to show each character's perspective of their
failing marriage but, in so doing, it manages to distance us from
connecting with those characters.  The non-lineal time line forces us to
view the story with our heads rather than our hearts.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is very good as the man who hasn't quite grown up.  His
repeated protest of "I am not a third child!" is obviously born of an oft
heard accusation.  There are times when he looses his anger at levels
incongruent for the moment but overall, his work is quite pleasing.</P>
<P>Michelle Pfeiffer is just wonderful.  Few actresses can portray a
deadened soul and still be interesting, but Ms. Pfeiffer does just that.
When her children leave the room, and the camera zooms in for a close up
of her, we literally can see the light go out in her eyes, leaving an
empty shell of a woman.  Her three minute monologue at the end of the film
is singly able to lift the entire project out of its mediocrity and raise
it a notch in our esteem.</P>
<P>Supporting the lead characters are friends played by Rob Reiner (EDTV),
Rita Wilson (SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE), Paul Reiser (MAD ABOUT YOU), and Julie
Haggarty (AIRPLANE).  They are less effective and are disappointingly used
for the sexual bantering mentioned earlier.  Ms. Wilson is seen in the
worse light, coming across as a foul-mouthed harpy.</P>
<P>The premise of the film is something that is important to consider.
Contrary to popular thought and hundreds of romantic comedies, love is not
something one "falls in or out of."  It is a decision one makes.  Once we
decide to love, we take certain actions because of that decision.</P>
<P>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son."  John
3:16a [KJV]</P>
<P>"For this then is the love of God, that we keep His commandments." 1 John
5:3a [KJV]</P>
<P>Ben and Katie so loved their children, they took actions to hide the fact
that they were considering separation and divorce.  Yet they did not take
the proper action needed to strengthen their own relationship, choosing
instead to suffer silently through the minuscule annoyances experienced
when living with another person.  The mistake they made (and a mistake
many couples make) was to let the little issues go by unresolved.  When we
do that, we aren't building bridges, we're building wedges.  Build a big
enough wedge, and the strongest love won't be able to hold a relationship
together.</P>
