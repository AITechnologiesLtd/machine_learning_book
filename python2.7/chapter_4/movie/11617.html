<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        Afterglow is about a group of people who remain in tangled, destructive
marriages, but the film doesn't quite explain why.  The characters are
all interesting and well-acted, and the film is moody and atmospheric;
but, at the end, I didn't know where the characters were emotionally. 
This lack of closure doesn't help the fact that the characters commonly
engage in situations that don't feel realistic, and say things that I
wouldn't expect people to say.  </P>
<P>        The film centers around two marriages.  One consists of Jeffrey and
Marianne Byron (Jonny Lee Miller and Lara Flynn Boyle).  He is a smart,
cold, and cocky business man, while she is a quiet, needy housewife who
just wants a baby.  The other marriage has Lucky and Phyllis Mann (Nick
Nolte and Julie Christie).  Lucky is a plumber who sleeps with all of
his clients; Phyllis is a depressed, alcoholic ex-actress who allows him
to sleep around.</P>
<P>        The story develops as it becomes clear that Jeffrey has no intention of
supplying Marianne with a child.  When Marianne hears about Lucky from a
woman who has him fix her pipes frequently, she calls him up, and they
begin an affair.  Then, through a series of unlikely events, Jeffrey and
Phyllis become attached, unknowing that their spouses are off doing the
same thing.</P>
<P>        The first problem I found is that the film relies far too much on
improbable coincidences.  What were the chances of Jeffrey and Phyllis
going to the same bar to watch their spouses cheat, and then end up
spending a weekend together based on one meeting?  It doesn't even seem
all that necessary to have this be an element of chance--one of the
characters could have sought out the other, and the effect would have
been the same.  This kind of material feels almost giddy in nature, and
the thought of the situation is goofy outside of the dark vision of
writer/director Alan Rudolph.</P>
<P>        In fact, the film is almost too dark.  Some of this is downright
depressing, and it never lets up--not even in the end.  Jeffrey, for
instance, is a character of little heart:  he actually tells his wife,
point blank, that he doesn't care one bit that she wants a baby, and
yet, we are expected to believe that he loves her.  The dynamics between
the couples feel inexplicably strange, so strange that I can't tell if
it's unrealistic, or just unusual.  Lucky and Phyllis have an equally
odd relationship, for I can't imagine any wife consenting to her
husband's infidelity.  Rudolph does attempt to explain her mentality on
the issue, but I couldn't by it.    </P>
<P>        The acting partially makes up for all of these disturbingly unique
character interactions.  Christie nailed a Best Actress nomination for
this performance, and she deserves it.  Phyllis is a woman who
constantly undergoes pure, emotional torture, and the often-subtle ways
that Christie emits these feelings is truly effective.  Nolte, whom I
normally detest as an actor, is actually good here (he's toned down that
macho image he always seems to be brandishing).  Boyle is quiet and
appealing, and takes her character through realistic developments.  And
Miller, who I still remember from Hackers, turns in another fine
performance while managing a near-perfect American accent (although he
pronounced "mountains" as "moontains").  </P>
<P>        In the end, the film left me feeling down, though I'm not sure this is
what Rudolph intended.  A subplot that involves the Mann's absent
daughter is potent, but extremely saddening, and ends with an unsure
conclusion.  And what we're led to believe happens to the Byrons doesn't
really feel good.  I don't know if it's proper to hold these elements
against Afterglow, because it's entirely possible that Rudolph intended
the audience to feel this way at the end.  And, if this is the case, I'm
not sure why.  I don't like leaving the theater wondering what I was
supposed to get out of the film.</P>
