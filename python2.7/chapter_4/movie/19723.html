<P>IN SHORT: Inferior Five via Not Brand Ecch!</P>
<P>If it isn't obvious from the X-Men Movie updates on the homepage, Cranky
is deeply into comic books. The creative team behind Mystery Men, from
Bob Burden (who created the team as part of his Flaming Carrot book) to
the folks at Dark Horse (who have a better track record with bringing
comics to the bigscreen, and vice versa, than any of the Big Three) have
peppered this flick with lots of in-jokes that will be readily apparent
to any fanboy. That being said, no knowledge of comic history is
necessary to enjoy the world of Champion City and its defender, Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear).</P>
<P>The Captain has done such a good job protecting his city that the only
bad guys left are bands of two-bit villains who steal dentures out of
the mouths of retirees. Crime is down, as are revenues from products
like Pepsi and Mighty White Toothpaste, whose logos make the Captain's
uniform look like that of a stock car race driver. Only the return of an
evil villain, like the scurrilous Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush)
can improve the bottom line so, with the aid of bespectacled billionaire
Lance Hunt (who looks remarkably like Greg Kinnear <g>), the Captain
engineers the parole of his arch enemy and prepares for the epic battle
that will mark the Millennium. The Captain, it must be said, is quite
full of himself. That means Champion City will soon be without a
champion.</P>
<P>If the villains of Champion City are two bit, the remaining superheroes
are even less. There's Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) possessed of an anger
and rage that makes him, um, angry. There's The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria),
an effeminate British accented good guy whose deadly aim with forks and
spoons (no knives -- knives are dangerous and could hurt someone) is
less than deadly. He's not really effeminate, by the way, its just part
of his superhero act. Last up is The Shoveler (William H. Macy) who
wears a catcher's chest protector and has a shovel.</P>
<PRE>Champion City is in deep trouble.</PRE>
<P>Turning the superhero genre on its ear yields a flick that is,
thematically, visually and aurally delightful. Virtually all of the
heroes are emotional misfits, Mr. Furious and the Blue Raja both have
problems with their moms. The Shoveler has a wife and two kids to
support (and Mrs. Shoveler has had just about enough). The production
design of Champion City is breathtaking. The high tech talk coming out
of the mouths of the heroes (neuro-laser-hossenpfeffer-chopper indeed)
is dead on loving parody of comic book excess. As in the comics, to save
the day, a super-team of heroes must be built. That means open
auditions, held in the backyard of The Shoveler's house. What a motley
group ...</P>
<P>The remaining superheroes, all third string, include The Bowler (Janeane
Garafalo) whose bowling ball contains her dad's skull; The Spleen (Paul
Reubens), whose silent but deadly power yields the funniest fart joke of
the summer; Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) whose invisibility power works
only if no one is looking at him; and the mysterious The Sphinx (Wes
Studi), whose telekinetic power split guns in two with and who trains
our team of misfits with instructional dialog that would have been at
home amidst the gobbledygook heard in The Matrix. In this case, it's
supposed to be funny. Rounding off the cast is Tom Waits as the good guy
weapons designer whose guns won't kill; Eddie Izzard (currently star of
an HBO comedy special) and Fugee music star Pras as the murderous bad
guys, the Disco Boys. You know they're bad -- they use guns.</P>
<P>Tomake comic heroes work, you've got to play 'em straight. William H.
Macy is the center of the team, a DC-style man in a Marvel-style group
wracked by self-doubt. Janeane Garofalo, above all the rest, nails the
schizophrenic identity shtick that accompanies the super-life.
Basically, she still discusses her actions with her dad. See it and
believe it.</P>
<P>Mystery Men gently pokes fun at Superman, Batman, the X-Men and at least
one teevee SF superhero (telling would spoil the surprise) and is
definitely one for us boys. On the downside, this is a popcorn flick
that may be too clever for its own good. There's not enough in it to
keep you glued to your seats -- Cranky's gut feeling is that
Frankenstein just isn't bad enough -- ducking out in the middle won't
mean you'll anything vital but, c'mon folks, this kind of cast in this
kind of flick is just too tempting to avoid.</P>
<P>Parents to whose kids Kel Mitchell is a superstar (from Nickelodeon's
Kenan and Kel series) will find no reason to keep their kids away from
the flick, though some of the superhero dialog shtick may confuse 'em.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mystery Men, he would have paid...</P>
<PRE>$5.00</PRE>
<P>Dateflick level. Mystery Men is terrific eye candy and a fine popcorn
movie if you've got a little boy child locked away inside. There's
nothing here that wouldn't work fine on the little screen, which should
mean a lower rating on the Cranky scale, but it's summertime and lite is
good.</P>
<P>Cast members William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Geoffrey
Rush and Paul Reubens (formerly known as Pee Wee Herman) all reveal that
they know diddle about comic books in their Cranky Critic® StarTalk. A
good time was had by all.</P>
<P>Best non-comics in-joke: Real life magician Ricky Jay saying to Captain
Amazing: "I'm a publicist, not a magician!"</P>
