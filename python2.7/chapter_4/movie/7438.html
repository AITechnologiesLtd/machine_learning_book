<PRE>                   ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>It has been quite a while since we have been treated to a couple of
young women as ditzY as Romy (Mira Sorvino) and her even flakier
friend, Michele (Lisa Kudrow).  Based on Robin Schiff's play, LADY'S
ROOM, which also starred Kudrow as Michele, and adapted by Schiff for
the screen, the film is a delightful romp.</P>
<P>Romy and Michele have been living together since they graduated from
Tucson's Sagebrush High School ten years ago. Their lot has not
improved any since those school days while time has flown by.  Romy is
a clerk at a car dealership while Michele is unemployed at the moment.
Not very exciting. When they learn about their school's ten year
reunion which they want to attend, they realize they will present the
same "nothing" appearance they did when they went to high school.
Everyone else is probably a TV anchorwoman or something equally
glamorous.  If the 2 young women are to attend the reunion and not
look as stupid as ever, they must invent something about themselves
that is exciting.  How about being the inventor of  Post-It?  That
ought to get the snooty girls at the reunion to now look up to them.</P>
<P>And so they are off to the reunion.  Romy hopes to meet the guy she was
in love with when they were in high school but who never gave her a
tumble. Michele has even less ambition. She just wants to have fun.</P>
<P>Everything is going well at the reunion for them when each announces
(to separate people) that she is very rich, having invented Post-It.
All the other women are duly impressed until their story is blown by
the very weird Heather, (Janeane Garofalo).</P>
<P>What the story behind the story is that Romy and Michele say whatever
comes to mind, going from hesd to mouth without stopping to think; and
their friendship is everything because they do enjoy each other's
company.  There is not enough of that in real life.</P>
<P>Mention should be made of the four-letter language (so leave the little
ones at home) as well as advice delivered by Heather to a cowboy that
includes something about "a sheep or your sister."  Very funny.
This may be a good time to mention that Kudrow should now be looking
for other types of roles lest she be typecast as strictly ditzy.</P>
<P>Others in the cast include the snooty Christie (the beautiful Julia
Campbell), boyfriends played by Alan  Cumming,  Vincent Vantresca, the
Cowboy played by Justin Theroux.</P>
<P>This is a no-brainer but quite, quite entertaining and what more could
one ask for?</P>
