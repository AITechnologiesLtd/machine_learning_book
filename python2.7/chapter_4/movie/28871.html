<P>Okay, let's cut to the chase:  If you're a fan of The Tom Green Show, you'll
probably really like Freddy Got Fingered.  If you hate the show, or can't
stand Tom Green, you've got no business going to see it.  And for the folks
that don't know who Tom Green is, consider yourself warned - Freddy is a
solid 12 on the gross-out scale (out of 10).  As if the title wasn't enough
of a warning...</P>
<P>Green, who also directed and co-wrote Freddy, plays Gord Brody, a cartoonist
(the third we've seen this year, after Monkeybone and Tomcats) who, as the
film opens, is about to relocate from his parents' basement in Portland to
Hollywood, where he's already secured a job at a cheese sandwich factory
until he hits it big and sells his animation ideas.  His parents (Rip Torn
and Julie Hagerty) proudly wave goodbye to their oldest son as he drives off
in the new car they've just bought for him.  Less than three minutes later,
he's grabbing horse cock.</P>
<P>It turns out that Gord is a phenomenally bad, unfocused cartoonist who is
given some shaky advice by a cartoon bigwig (played by Anthony Michael
Hall) - quit his day job and "get inside the animal."  The latter direction
is supposed to help Gord flesh out his crude animated characters, but
instead affords him the opportunity to play with roadkill.  And that's
before he falls in love with a handicapped, amateur rocket scientist with an
oral fixation who gets off on being caned.</P>
<P>The bulk of Freddy focuses on the relationship between Gord and his
overbearing father.  Gord thinks he's getting treated unfairly, while his
dad wonders why he can't be like younger brother Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas,
Black and White), a gainfully employed bank teller.  If you're familiar with
Green's television show, some of the film's content, one might theorize, is
probably based on his relationship with his real father, a man who spent his
entire career in the military.</P>
<P>This ain't Citizen Kane here.  There's a ton of gross-out material, and
almost none of it is even slightly integral to the plot.  The film is
two-thirds over before you realize what the title means.  Freddy's music
often overpowers its dialogue, which some may actually consider a good
thing.  But none of that matters when you're busting your gut watching a
delirious Torn run though Pakistan wearing nothing but a bathrobe.</P>
<P>Green has no real professional acting experience, no familiarity with
writing feature-film scripts and absolutely zero know-how when it comes to
directing.  But you know what?  There are a lot of films that are worse than
Freddy - films made by experienced talent. You have to admire his ability to
cajole money from a major film studio to make this thing, too.  And he does
all of his own stunts.  He's the complete package, or a real tool, depending
on if you like him or not.  Personally, I don't think Green is too far off
from Jim Carrey's work on In Living Colour.  Green is just as funny and just
as unpolished as Carrey was back then - a real diamond in the rough who is
probably going to be around a lot longer than 15 minutes (hey, if J. Lo can
do it, why can't he?).</P>
<P>The only other actor to emerge from Green's gigantic shadow is Torn, who, if
you can believe it, plays a more vulgar version of his Larry Sanders
character.  He is perfectly cast here.  Freddy also features cameos from
Green's new wife Drew Barrymore, Shaquille O'Neal and Canadian TV talk-show
host Mike Bullard, who once threw up on live television when Green taunted
him with a dead animal.  And if you look close, you can see footage of Green
's lymph-node surgery, too.</P>
<P>1:30 - R for crude sexual and bizarre humor, and for strong language</P>
