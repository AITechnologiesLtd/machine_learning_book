<P>Watching ELIZABETH is like watching history dissolve before your very 
eyes.  It retrofits the reign of Elizabeth the First (Cate Blanchett) 
so that it becomes no more than a spectacle for our amusement here at 
the end of the twentieth century.  The poverty and the sickness, the 
abuse of the working and servant classes; the philosophies and habits 
of thought, the alchemical sense of world and being--all these and 
much more are ignored, while our own supposed interests are transposed 
into another era.  This is the story of Elizabeth as we would like it 
to be: all politics, sex, treachery, a "Dynasty" for the 1500s.  It's 
not exactly a bad movie, just an appallingly unsubtle one.</P>
<P>It is, however, craftily told and well played, charting Elizabeth's 
rise to power and assumption of responsibility.  When we meet her, she 
is just another well-bred lady with no sense of what it takes to be a 
ruler; shortly thereafter, she ascends to the throne, bastard 
half-sister of Queen Mary, who is now dead.  By the end, she has 
settled into that throne as the Virgin Queen, red tresses shorn, face 
masked in white greasepaint, ice-cold, diamond-hard.  The path she 
takes is a difficult one.  She has to tiptoe through the minefields of 
political expediency: Spain and France vie for her affection, hoping 
to subsume England through marriage; the factions in her own court 
plot her downfall, principal among them Lord Norfolk (Christopher 
Eccleston); she tries to balance her love for Lord Robert Dudley 
(Joseph Fiennes) against the nation's need for her to marry wisely and 
well and bear a child.</P>
<P>Elizabeth is unique among this dramatis personae: not only is she a 
woman, she's a time-traveller too.  She is not a historical figure, 
but a refugee from today, a mouthpiece for comfortably liberal PC 
beliefs: she's a feminist, she advocates freedom of religion, she's 
sexually liberated.  It's not that Elizabeth wouldn't make a good 
feminist icon--she does--but refusing to implicate her in her own time 
and its attendant prejudices means that her iconic status remains 
unearned.  It is too easy to identify with her, to root for her.  A 
woman who embodied progressive ideals despite the burden of her own 
assumptions and weaknesses would be a genuine icon.  A woman who 
retroactively embodies contemporary ideals--and their attendant 
prejudices--becomes merely a vehicle for the scriptwriter.  She has no 
interior life, no sense of human complexity.  She is perfect, 
transcendent: she is all surface, all illusion.</P>
<P>Blanchett's performance does make it a very convincing illusion, and 
the other actors too impart a zest and engagement to material that 
doesn't really deserve it.  They brood, they strut, they emote, they 
connive, all on cue, all by the numbers, with that impeccable sense of 
not-quite-overplayed theatricality that the Brits do so well.  
(Australians do it well too, apparently: Geoffrey Rush is deliciously 
wicked as Walsingham, an utter bastard but a loyal advisor.)   But the 
performances, and Remi Adefarasin's sumptuous photography, are rather 
spoiled by Shekhar Kapur (BANDIT QUEEN), whose direction seems 
inspired by a nigh-unbreachable diktat: never let a shot last more 
than five seconds, or, if you do, make sure the camera is always 
moving.  Coverage of a scene is one thing; this is smotherage.  It 
betokens a nervousness about the material, a refusal to let it stand 
on its own merits, and serves as a smokescreen to hide the hollowness 
of the thing, the lack of any authentic historical perspective.</P>
<P>It may seem rather unfair to criticize the movie for its 
ahistoricity: it is not an uncommon problem in period pieces, and it 
is to some extent a forgivable one.  We want to see the bright 
costumes, the sprightly dances, the hallowed rituals.  We don't want 
to see the dirt, the squalor, the disease.  We want story, not 
sociology.  But still: the sense in ELIZABETH that history exists 
solely for our entertainment is persistent and aggravating.</P>
<P>Consider a love scene in Elizabeth's bedroom: the bed happens to be 
veiled by translucent silk hangings, of the kind found in your average 
soft-core sex flick, so that the coyly half-shown lovemaking has that 
hazy-focus art-porn look.  Maybe Elizabeth's bedroom really did look 
like that, but I doubt it.  That's a minor quibble; the opening 
sequence is something else entirely.  It is a brutal depiction of 
heretics (i.e., Protestants) being burned at the stake.  While he 
elswhere opts for a sanitized version of Elizabethan life, Kapur's 
mise-en-scène here is graphically bloody, sooty, grimy, real.  The 
scene's inclusion can be justified by only the flimsiest of pretexts; 
it is in effect being used for shock value, as a hook.  But real 
people died, real people burned, once upon a time, and there is 
something spurious and dishonest about Kapur's lackadaisical treatment 
of them.  ELIZABETH not only ignores the past, it exploits it.</P>
<P>The argument in favour of this approach may be that modernizing the 
material makes it more relevant: but the effect is precisely the 
opposite, for nothing has been learned.  By refusing to deal with 
Elizabeth I in her own terms, by dealing with her solely in our terms, 
the movie is of no interest to us, here, now, in 1998, except as 
diversion.  And it is, at times, a spectacular diversion, even if it 
is all overstatement.  If it were a book, all the key passages would 
be underlined, with exclamation marks--but, oh my, what fine-looking 
exclamation marks they would be.</P>
