<PRE>LETHAL WEAPON 4 (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Richard Donner
Writer: Channing Gibson (story by Jonathan Lemkin, Alfred Gough, and Miles
Millar)
Starring: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, Jet
Li, Darlene Love, Traci Wolf, Ebonie Smith, Damon Hines</P>
<P>We have reached that stage called comfort.  Those of you who've seen the
other three "Lethal Weapon" films, that is, like me or my dad or a couple
other people I know.  We saw the first one on video or TV and we adored it
so much that when the second one came out, we were there on opening night. 
We saw the third one opening night as well, and we've seen them all
numerous times on tape and TV and whatnot.  And judging by everything that
has gone down in those films, there's honestly very little you can do with
the series anymore.  Sure, you could, I dunno, make Rene Russo and Mel
Gibson's characters, who discovered an attraction between themselves in the
previous episode, get married and have kids.  Or continue the odyssey of
Danny Glover's character's daughter from baby to wife and mother.  But
would those really hold an entire movie.</P>
<P>So why don't we just give them a throwaway plot that we cut to every now
and then, introduce those elements that are there just to make the
characters change a bit, and then just let the characters...live.  Watching
"Lethal Weapon 4" is almost like a really relaxing reunion for everyone
who's been watching these films for the past decade, and who's just gotten
used to the constant bickering of the two protagonists, and the numerous
deadly follies they get into.  I saw this film on opening night, filled
with a crowd of people who no doubtedly had seen the other three and were
just returning not because the movie's previews looked nice, but because
it's yet another misadventure for a bunch of really likable characters that
have grown on us.</P>
<P>Henceforth, "Lethal Weapon 4" is not so much a continuation of the series
as it is a present for the fans, just to keep them smiling and laughing
along with the characters.  It's as if they all knew that the series would
be pretty stale if they tried to make things fresh, so they gave up and
just had fun with it.  And watching this film is like watching flawless
chemistry between actors and between the audience and what's on the screen.
 Those of us who've come to see this film because it's just another chance
to see Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, still sharing
flawless chemistry) laugh with eachother and their supporting character
friends will most likely laugh right along with them.</P>
<P>The plot itself, as I said, is pretty thin, and seems to be a slight
recycling from the sorta-forgettable anti-Asian Crichton novel and it's
later film adaptation, "Rising Sun."  It's something or other with Chinese
Triad members, some people sold into a kind of modern slavery so they can
live in America, and one really bad-ass guy named Wah Sing Ku, played by a
guy named Jet Li, who acts with a cool distance and is able to do any
acrobatic fight sequence that he reminds us of a wannabe Bruce Lee crossed
with Jackie Chan.  Anyways, it's basically just there to fill time, and,
with the exception of promises of big, fun, over-the-top action sequences
as well as some cool moves from Jet Li (or both), it's pretty much
distracting from the real reason we've come to see this...</P>
<P>...and that's for the characters and what's going on with them.  Things are
constantly changing in their lives, and the film takes the time to show
that Riggs and his now-pregnant girlfriend from the last film, Lorna Cole
(Rene Russo) are actually considering marriage, and that Murtaugh's oldest
daughter is really growing up as she's pregnant and actually hiding her
marriage to a cocky police officer named Lee Butters (Chris Rock) a secret
because Murtaugh doesn't want her marrying a cop.  And Leo Getz is still
there, although now he's a P.I.  And, as an added bonus which is rarely
revisited, Riggs and Murtaugh, out of desperation by the department to get
them out of the streets without firing them, are promoted to Captain.  The
main new addition, taking in accordance with the others which added a
member each installment (number 2 it was Pesci, number 3 it was Russo), is
Butters, although he's unfortunately not really a major character, at least
not as major a character as Getz and Cole were when they were introduced. 
He's mainly there to give the film a new area of attraction since he's
mighty hot right now (and with good reason - he's hilarious, though he's
only allowed to use his hilarious style a couple times).</P>
<P>But we also come to see the action sequences, which in this film are
numerous and always crazy.  This is where the films always differ, and what
makes this film a bit inferior to the other three.  Those films took their
action sequenes rather seriously, and their plots were handled as a kind of
contrast to the hilarity the film had in the downtime.  Sure, they were
witty and over-the-top, but the ones in this movie, at least some of them,
are almost annoyingly campy.  The finale, a huge silent fight between
Riggs, Murtaugh, and Li is a long, totally proposterous sequence that ends
satisfyingly...sorta.  And after awhile, they get a bit tiresome.  The only
sequence which really becomes memorable is one in the middle involving a
car chase and a truck dragging Riggs on a table across a highway that is so
over-the-top that it's brilliantly enigmatic.  It's also so goofy and
hilarious that when it was over, the entire audience, who was in stitches
by the last crash, gave it a hearty applaud.</P>
<P>If anything, this film is disappointing in that it's plot is weak, flimsy,
and basically just there to kill time, something that the plots in the
other films weren't.  We were able to really get a big kick out of the
action sequences, and were always in awe of the plots and their numerous
villains.  Remember how amazingly tense the first one got then how it could
effortlessly shift to comedy (same for the second)?  None of that here -
it's all on autopilot.  But with a nice sugar coating of lots of character
comedy that is basically only humerous to those who've lived with the
characters for so long, this film actually comes off as being sucessful. 
It's all because this film comes as the fourth in the series, and we've
found them at a point when it's not even about the plot or the money: it's
about just getting back together and making a movie they can have fun with.
 And it's about us just coming back because we feel like we're all part of
their extended family.  And basically we are.</P>
