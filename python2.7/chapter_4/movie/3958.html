                       A film review by <A HREF="mailto:scatt@scatt.planet.net">scatt@scatt.planet.net</A>

<P>     After seeing the trailers for this movie, I thought to myself that
this would finally be a decent video game-to-movie translation.  (note
I said decent, not great).  I never expected much, but for a movie
based on an action packed, bloody game, I would have expected more,
especially since the first ten to twenty minutes were really making me
sleepy.  The characters are lacking any depth, and they all think
they're George Carlin.  The action is a bit weak, but the movie is
still a lot better than STREETFIGHTER.  My advice is to wait for it to
hit video if you must see it.  My only wish is that if they do make a
sequel (as is hinted at the end of the movie) that they hire new
writers, and pack a bit more action into it.</P>
