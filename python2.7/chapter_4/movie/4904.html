<PRE>                                  MIAMI BLUES
                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<PRE>(1990) 97m. </PRE>
<P>In George Armitage's adaptation of Charles Willeford's novel, Alec
Baldwin plays a wanted ex-con whose devil-may-care attitude
surprisingly hasn't yet led to his capture.  Upon reaching Miami he
meets up with ingenue hooker Jennifer Jason Leigh, adopts her as his
fiancee, and sets about supplementing their income with a string of
petty thefts.  Upon acquiring the cuffs, badge, and other
accouterments of cop Fred Ward, he discovers that larceny has never 
been easier.  Disarming black comedy-drama stands out among others in
the pack because its offbeat plot turns make it hard for the viewer to
match a rhythm to it.  The sex scene we all expect comes earlier than
expected, the initial meeting between Baldwin and Ward isn't how we
anticipate it, and Baldwin, the prime proponent of the film's
randomness, does not move to a predictable plan - he is psychotic
enough to kill on a whim, yet never rises above purse-snatching and
break-ins.  What's interesting is that while Baldwin is the cause of
so much random violence towards others, he is at the same time the
victim of spontaneous, violent acts.  It's not surprising that his
dismissive attitude treats everything as if it were a game: Baldwin
roleplays confrontations with himself (a la TAXI DRIVER), lies
continually, plays cop as soon as he gets hold of a badge, and plays
house with Leigh, whom he tells "Call me Junior".  It's an appropriate
nickname, and Leigh is a suitably ditzy companion for him.</P>
<P>In one picture-postcard scene, Baldwin and Leigh watch couples happily
playing with a frisbee against a Miami beach sunset.  No sooner have
the two of them set up house than they are playing with a frisbee
outside on the front lawn.  When Leigh, with an older and wiser glint
in her eye, tosses the frisbee aside at the film's conclusion, she,
for one, knows that the dream is over.  Unlike Junior, Ward,
world-weary and only one week from retirement, manages to finish what
he started.  Ward and his world are mundane and orderly, and the
antithesis of Baldwin, a character out of sync in a world out of sync.
 While convention dictates that the cop and his quarry remain separate
for the bulk of the film we nevertheless feel a connection between
them.  Their dinner together, in which Baldwin is cagey but jumpy, and
Ward is either dumb or just playing dumb, is a highlight.  Baldwin's
character is always interesting (how many films have you seen where
the criminal accompanies a house burglary with an improvisational
haiku?), Leigh somehow manages to play superficiality with a sense of
depth, and Ward fits into his role effortlessly.  Weird coincidence:
Baldwin steals a badge and passes himself off as "Sergeant Mosely". 
Two years earlier in MIDNIGHT RUN, Robert De Niro steals a badge as
passes himself off as "Agent Mosely".  Has anybody else noticed this?</P>
