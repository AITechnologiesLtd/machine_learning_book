<P>     "EL CID is one of the greatest epic films ever made.  Anthony
Mann's sense of composition, his use of space, and his graceful camera
movements bring to life an ancient tapestry where the transformation of
an ordinary man into a legend become almost a mystical experience."
Lavish praise from Martin Scorsese, one of the forces behind the
restoration and re-release of EL CID.  Pardon me if I am not wholly in
agreement with him.</P>
<P>     The story of EL CID centers around the life of Rodrigo Diaz
(Charlton Heston), a Castilian knight in 1060 Spain fighting to keep
his country from the brink of civil war so that it will retain the
manpower and unity necessary to defend itself against the outside
threat of the North African Moors.  Diaz, called El Cid by his
followers, becomes a living legend to the men of eleventh century
Spain, and this film willingly expands upon every myth to surround the
name of the legitimate historical figure.  EL CID is definitely not a
good source for a factual biography (the identity of Diaz' wife and the
premise of the finale are a few of the more obvious occasions when the
truth is completely ignored).</P>
<P>     Using similar methods and equal care to that which was given to
LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the restoration of EL CID is an impressive
undertaking.  The sound quality on this new print is flawless and, for
the most part, the picture is better than one would expect from a
thirty-two year old film.  There are several frames that are far from
mint condition, but the overall effect is impressive, and the colors
are never washed-out.</P>
<P>     The battle scenes of EL CID are breathtaking, and well worth the
effort of seeing on a large screen.  Video viewing of the climactic
struggle would greatly diminish the impact, and it is in this context
that it's possible to understand Scorsese's quote.  This is definitely
a film meant for theaters.  The television screen will serve only to
limit the high points and magnify the numerous, often-glaring
weaknesses.  Instead of EL CID seeming like an epic, it could come off
looking rather stupid.</P>
<P>     That's because beyond the spectacle and pageantry, EL CID's
virtues are limited.  The costumes and set design are as impressive as
the magnificent backdrops against which the turbulent struggles of the
armies occur, and the effort necessary to orchestrate the realistic
clash of thousands of swords is mind-boggling, but while these things
add a great deal to the film, they cannot entirely cover up its
shortcomings.</P>
<P>     Acting is by far the biggest problem.  While both Charlton Heston
and Sofia Loren have imposing screen personalities, neither is capable
of projecting real emotion or drawing us into a rapport with the
characters.  Simply put, Heston and Loren are wooden, and there are
only a few occasions on which they manage to make Diaz or Chimene
real.  The chemistry between them is flat, conveying little, if any,
passion.  "Smouldering" is not a word anyone would use to describe this
couple.</P>
<P>     The plot is high melodrama with few surprises.  Diaz is the hero,
and he does all the superhuman things expected from a knight "with God
on [his] side."  EL CID turns far more often to the ridiculous than the
sublime, and the last scenes contain an element that is downright
silly.  Perhaps if the movie didn't take itself so seriously, there
wouldn't be as many opportunities for unintentional laughter, but EL
CID is about as self-important as a motion picture can be.  It is an
epic, after all, but in case we've forgotten, there's always the
needlessly florid dialogue and stentorian score to remind us.</P>
<P>     Obviously, they don't make movies like this any more, and that's
both good and bad.  While there's a lot in this film that modern
pictures don't need to harken back to, it would be nice to see some of
the flair.  When recalling great battles in recent films, only a few
come to mind (LAST OF THE MOHICANS and GLORY, for example), none of
which have the scope or sheer power of what Anthony Mann achieved in EL
CID.</P>
<P>     So, while I'm personally not ready to anoint EL CID as the
timeless epic classic that it has become, I'll not pepper it with
arrows of disdain, either.  This is a grand movie with tremendous
aspirations that are not always realized.  Nevertheless, it's an
entertaining, if not transcendental way to spend three-plus hours.</P>
