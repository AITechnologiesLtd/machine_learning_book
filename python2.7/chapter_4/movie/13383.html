<P>"The City of Lost Children" automatically gets major pointers for being a
stunning film to look at, and it gets a couple extra pointers for having
the respect to not insult our intelligence and waste our time with a really
crap story.  When watching this film, you should be in the same state of
mind that you are when watching last year's french Bruce Willis fantasy,
"The Fifth Element," because save for a little better quality and style in
this one, the two films share a similar idylism: that they're both
children's stories for adults, and eye candy for the intelligent who don't
want to really feel like having a whole lot of depth with their watching
but still want to be entertained in the most original way possible.</P>
<P>That's what one of the strengths of this film is: it's able to be
completely original and entertaining and incredible to just look at, and
this is nothing of shock since it's been directed by one of the most visual
pair of directors working today (although not really paired up anymore),
Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who, back in 1991, made the incredibly
entertaining "Delicatessen" about a butcher who hires men to work in his
apartment building then cuts them up for food for the normal residents.  In
that film, they showed that they were amazing visualists, that they had a
wicked sense of humor, and that they could tell a story with characters who
were both as freaky as anything Fellini or Kafka ever dreamed up and also
sympathetic.  Who can watch that film and not feel some kind of connection
for Dominique Pinon's desperate clown, or for the butcher's mousy
daughter...or even the butcher?</P>
<P>"The City of Lost Children" is at once similar to that, in that it tells a
weird story in a wonderfully stylistic fashion, but different in that that
one was almost a satire on the results of war (the people were cannibals
because of a lack of food because of a war), while this one's a flat-out
children's story, similar to all those weird tales we heard when we were
kids about monsters harming children and the simple folk who had to save
them.  "The City of Lost Children" has all this.  It has a frighteningly
evil man, denizens of monsters, an almost backwards world where anything is
possible, and a hero in the form of a dim-witted, child-like circus
strongman who's chief brains are in the form of his partner, a young girl
who can't be over 10 years old.</P>
<P>But all of this is told as if it were a story that the writers came up with
when they were kids and only now are being able to make into a lavish,
special effects-laden film, much the same way Luc Besson made "The Fifth
Element," a story he imagined as a teenager, but told from the point of
view of an adult trying to be a kid again.  Both films had adult humor
laced with the right amount of kiddie humor that we all still enjoy, wacky
characters, and some truly amazing vistas to look at (I would rank both of
these as two of the best-looking films of all time).  What makes this one
better is a pinch of depth, weirder more memorable characters, and, well, a
better story told in a more original way.</P>
<P>The story deals with a monster of a man named Krank, played by Daniel
Emilfork, who has got to be the scariest-looking human being I have ever
seen.  Bald, and featuring a long face with a portruding mouth that makes
him look like Nosferatu's lost brother, Emilfork is a freaky creation, and
his character is a tragic one because his main flaw is that he cannot
dream.  Therefore, he kidnaps children, forces them to go to sleep where he
peers into their dreams...but has only found nightmares.  Yes, I know it
sounds weird, but stay with me on this one.</P>
<P>Krank basically rules the city or whatever it is the film takes place on
(like a floating city or something), but lives in a tower in the river next
to it with dozens of clones of one man (all played by Dominique Pinon, who
has one of the most flexible faces in history, allowing him for many
comical happenings), and with a freaky midgit woman played by Mirille Mossé
(picture a shorter, more anorexic version of that short lady from
"Poltergeist" and you have what this woman looks like).  He also controls a
group of men called the Cyclops, who have robotic sensors so they can see
out of a computer and hear extra-well.  Keep on staying with me on this.</P>
<P>Into the story comes the aforementioned circus strongman named One (played
by the ape-like Ron Perlman, who was the Beast on the TV show "Beauty and
the Beast"), who's very little brother (Joseph Lucien) is kidnapped by the
Cyclops, sending One on an odyssey to rescue him.  He eventually gets the
aide of a little girl named Miette (Juliet Vittet), an already-cynical
little girl who works for a pair of siamese twin school teachers (Geneviève
Brunet and Odile Mallet), who ask the kids to rob for them.  With so many
obstacles, it's a tough search, and it all leads up to a bizarre climax,
even more bizarre than you'd think.</P>
<P>Just by reciting this to you, I can tell that I don't totally understand
what goes on in this film, and it's really tough to find out.  The film is
so obsessed with being weird and introducing originally proposterous
characters as well as just looking great that it really doesn't tell a
plausible tale.  However, this is, in all reality, part of its overall
charm.  The film's style of storytelling takes several major risks,
featuring scenes that make little or no sense even after it has been
explained by another scene, and not even managing to really kick in till
around the fifty minute point, when the film's focus has finally taken
control.</P>
<P>The film isn't so much about storytelling as it is about creating a world
that is completely fresh and amazing to look at.  The world in the film is
like something out of a Melies film, only more dark and disturbing, and
there isn't one frame in this film that couldn't be frozen and hung on a
wall in an art museum.  I shouldn't even need to mention to you that
Jean-Paul Gaulthier did the costuming because you can immeadiately spot
when he has designed the costumes for a film.  The man just keeps on
topping himself - look at his ingenius costuming for "The Fifth Element," a
job that was so unrewarded that it's almost a travesty.  Everything that
makes up mise-en-scene really makes this one of the freakiest films to
watch, as well as the most fun because the story is always intriguing, and
a bit of a struggle to make through, I suppose.  And it only helps that the
actors in this film give their characters a bit of heart, like Ron
Perlman's lovable performance as the oafish One, and especially Daniel
Emilfork's creepy and sympathetic performance as Krank.</P>
<P>The factor that really takes this film over the top, though, is its wacky
sense of humor, as well as its sense of style.  Caro and Jeunet really know
how to make a film extremely wacky, and there isn't one character who's
boring in this film, including the several Pinon clones that run around in
Krank's fortress.  Of course, don't ask me what the film's truly about in
depth.  Is it a satire on the amount of humanity, judged by the way Krank
cannot dream?  Perhaps.  Is it about the struggle for normality?  I dunno,
and frankly, I don't give a damn why anything is here, if there's a purpose
for what's on screen.  Don't ask me why there are a bunch of clones who
can't figure out who the original is.  I don't know and I don't care.  I
could care less about what the film is truly about, and really all I know
is that it's certainly an experience I'd highly recommend to anyone with a
sense of humor.  What can I say about a film where the only voice of reason
and sanity is a brain inside a fish tank with the voice of Jean-Louis
Trintignant (from "The Conformist")?  I suppose all I can say "Groovy,
baby."</P>
