<P>The press kit for Disney's computer animated children's movie,
"Dinosaur," contains eight pages of cast and crew biographies, nine
pages of credits and 15 pages of production notes. Included in the
copious technical section is one paragraph on the actual story, which
reveals a lot about the filmmakers' priorities. "Dinosaur" is a 75
minute (82 with closing credits) showcase for computer animation, with a
standard issue Disney storyline slapped on. And, despite the jazzy
visuals, it's a surprisingly mundane affair.</P>
<P>Of course, the very young target audience for the movie will love every
minute of it, but then again, they also look at Lunchables as fine
dining.</P>
<P>Set in the late Cretaceous Period, "Dinosaur" chronicles the adventures
of Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney), an Iguanodon raised by a family of
frolicking lemurs after his egg turns up on their island paradise. A
meteor shower forces them to flee to the mainland, where they join a
diverse group of dinosaurs trudging across the ravaged land seeking a
new nesting ground. Aladar's insistence on staying with caravan
stragglers like the slow-moving Brachiosaur, Baylene (Joan Plowright),
and the brassy Styrachosaur, Eema (Della Reese), draws the ire of
Iguanodon herd leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright), even though his sister,
Neera (Julianna Margulies), clearly considers the rebellious young
dinosaur to be quite a stud.</P>
<P>Think Disney's "Tarzan" minus the exuberance and "The Lion King" with
less majesty and you'll know what to expect from the retread plot. Think
fuzzy wuzzy and you'll understand the story's philosophy. In the press
notes, Margulies states, "The film has a beautiful message, especially
for younger viewers, that it's so much cooler to help the weak ones than
to go along with the bully who hates everyone and can be mean just
because he's more powerful." The villain of which she speaks is Kron,
and his crime is driving the herd to a safe haven, even if it means
leaving behind those who can't keep pace. Apparently, Disney-think
allows no room for distasteful concepts like survival of the fittest.</P>
<P>But enough carping over plot and philosophy – after all, this is a film
concerned primarily with cute characters and dazzling visuals.
"Dinosaur" strives to raise the bar for computer animation, placing CG
characters in real world settings. The production's first unit shot in
California's Mohave Desert and in Hawaiian botanical gardens, along with
other sites on the Big Island, Maui and Kauai, while the second unit
captured images in Australia, Jordan, Venezuela and the beaches of
Western Samoa. Animators studied light and shadow with great care,
attempting to seamlessly insert their computer generated creations into
real backdrops.</P>
<P>Their success rate varies from scene to scene. Some composite images are
crisp, sharply defined and remarkably convincing, while others have a
creamy, storybook appearance that is far less credible, but still
attractive. The most impressive shots are close-ups where the animators
obviously strained to break new ground. In the past, computer renditions
of water and hair generally ranged from barely passable to flat-out
cheesy, but "Dinosaur" gets them right. For scenes of a soggy lemur, fur
stylist Charles Colladay dealt with both, explaining "To study wet hair,
I experimented at home by wetting down my cats to see what they looked
like. The hair comes to thousands of little points and you can see the
skin in-between. That gave us some direction to go in and we came up
with a hair-clumping tool where we could actually grab a single hair on
the computer and clump a bunch of others to our target hair. We went to
the zoo to study real lemurs, but they kind of frowned on us wetting
them down."</P>
<P>Even though "Dinosaur" periodically breaks new ground, the film suffers
from a been-there, done-that feel. Ads for the film trumpet, "You've
never seen anything like this before!" Apparently, they forgot about a
little feature called "Jurassic Park." When Laura Dern and Sam Neill
first saw a dinosaur grazing in the sunshine, rising on its hind legs to
snatch some leaves from the top of a tree, my jaw dropped as far as
theirs did. I never experienced that sensation during "Dinosaur." I've
no doubt that kids will go wild over the movie, but for this adult, the
grafting of grandiose images to a Sesame Street storyline left me cold.
Scientists theorize that dinosaurs became extinct as a result of Earth
being struck by an asteroid. After sitting through this tepid spectacle,
I wonder if they simply died of boredom.</P>
