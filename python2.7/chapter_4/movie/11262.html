<PRE>                     JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                   1 :-(  for typical, typical Jackie</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jackie Chan, Jackson Lou, Chen Chun Wu, Bill Tung Director:
Stanley Tong Producer: Barbie Tung Screenplay: Stanley Tong, Nick
Tramontane, Greg Mellott, and Elliot Tong</P>
<P>What is a Jackie Chan trademark? Attempting all his own stunts and
breaking all his bones is probably one. An extremely high premium rate
on his life insurance policy is probably another. How about the Mickey
Mouse comicness of his over exagerated expressions - probably a third? I
find this annoying and some critics will disagree with me. Some people
actually like this sort of kiddy mix of kick-butt-attitude action and it
probably served Chan well in his twenties and thirties, but there comes
a time in life, when it just doesn't seem appropriate anymore. When
you're past forty, showing you're naked butt, no matter how well toned,
just doesn't live up to what it was a decade ago. I'm referring to the
arse uncovered, dog sniffing, girl gawking scene which goes a little
past embarrassing. Please, Jackie not again.</P>
<P>As is expected of most of Chan's movie, this is fast moving. Let's face
it this ‘little' 5'9' chap just can't keep still. He is undoubtedly the
most agile, acrobatic, hyperactive Hollywood star and proves it by
dancing elegantly to cat and mouse throughout this movie. So to the plot
- it all seems a vague blur, but has a something to do with Russian
Mafia, the CIA and Jackie. Who cares about the plot anyway, they're
always vaguely similar and most people paid to see the action anyway. Of
note is a particularly back breaking ladder scene, which Chan uncannily
uses as an extension of his body, creating the feel of two become one.
Artistic and well choreographed. Now I'd like to see him do these same
stunts on ice - which would be spectacular or a spectacle.</P>
<P>The acting ….. hmmm …. I'll just skip that discourse and mosey along to
say that this is number four in the long line of POLICE STORY sequels. I
missed the first three and somehow, I have the strangest feeling I
haven't missed much. There will be the die hard Chan fan's who will
disagree with me even as this never-ending saga of Chan sequel's
continue. So I didn't like the movie overall, but Chan will live to
fight another day.</P>
