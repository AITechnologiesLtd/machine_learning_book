<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE" (Lions Gate Films)</P>
<P>A hit at the Sundance Film Festival, this kitschy and
affectionate documentary by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey chronicles
the life and times of Tammy Faye Bakker, ex-wife of evangelist Jim
Bakker who - in a spectacular and highly publicized free-fall from
grace - lost control of the PTL (Praise the Lord) Ministries to
manipulative minister Jerry Falwell and wound up in jail. Narrated by
"RuPaul" Charles, it delves beneath the public persona of the teary
Tammy Faye and into the storybook life of the couple who had the
audacity to make Christian fellowship fun, creating a Heritage USA
water park that was the ultimate baptismal font and openly welcoming
homosexuals into their PTL Club.  Tammy Faye grew up as a humble
Christian girl who loved puppets and had such strong faith that she
claims a wart on her finger was cured during a Sunday communion. When
she was in college, she met and married Jim Bakker, whose faith
matched hers. Together, they cultivated the electronic pulpit,
building three Christian television networks and becoming arguably the
most popular Christian force in the United States. Their dreams were
expensive and their money-raising schemes extensive. Then, in the
1980s, scandal rocked Tammy Faye's life, destroying her reputation and
her marriage. Nevertheless, Tammy Faye is once again on her feet, the
indomitable survivor, back in the limelight where she feels she
belongs. Obviously, the filmmakers are sympathetic and their bias
propels the narrative. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The
Eyes of Tammy Faye" is an ironic, irreverent, comic 7.  I suspect that
one of the reasons this film resonates so strongly with audiences is
that we live in a very judgmental society and, just perhaps, we were
wrong about Tammy Faye.</P>
