<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Angela's Ashes" follows the McCourt family from Brooklyn, where they
can't fit in, back to Limerick, Ireland. The impoverished Irish family
has gone in the reverse direction of most immigrants. They will also not
feel at home in their new location. Angela, played with some stoic
reserve by Emily Watson, comes from a family that has no use for her
husband Malachy (Robert Carlyle). He has an underwritten part as a
hopeless alcoholic, playing someone who can't get work but endears
himself to the family by telling them stories. He's from Northern
Ireland, thereby he is treated like a foreigner in Limerick. The trouble
with Carlyle's part (not his performance) was that it had no punch to
it, he couldn't make it an interesting role. The stories he told about
the English bringing fleas and the damp to Ireland, didn't evoke the
comedy or sympathy for him that it should have. He just came off as a
deadbeat, someone who cared more about himself than anything else.</P>
<P>The whole point of the film will be a long and trying study in misery
and poverty, as the family will undergo a series of hardships, including
the loss of three young children. The film never gets untracked from its
maudlin attitude. It suffers from the old problem of trying to portray
misery without having a film that can escape from being miserable
itself. The other problem is that the misery seemed unreal, everything
about it seemed so uninvolving and pristine. The film was flat. Its
characters seemed too sanitary for their circumstances, and the family's
plight never seemed to be more than what their outside environment was,
of rainy days, apartments with fading wallpaper, and cramped streets. It
was hard to care about what was happening to them, except the obvious
reaction one gets when seeing a poor household. Their endless plight
seemed no different from the beginning of the film to the end. I have no
idea what I was supposed to get from seeing them being deprived of
comfortable housing, not having enough food to eat, wearing torn
clothes, not having a dependable father, having a Christian brother slam
the church door in Frank's face, the father putting a beer mug on his
young son's coffin, a government and a church  indifferent to the
McCourt's poverty, and for the family not having proper indoor plumbing,
except to say that's too bad. It was the filmmakers job, the director
Alan Parker, along with the screenwriter, Laura Jones, to make me want
to care, but instead, they made me feel too distant to honestly feel
anything.</P>
<P>"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish
childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood,"
writes Frank McCourt in his account of his miserable Irish Catholic
childhood in the 30s and 40s. And if misery per se were an  interesting
topic, this adaptation of Frank McCourt's book might be too. To make
matters even worse, this is an excrutiatingly long film, over
two-and-a-half-hour running time, and it seemed to go on forever. This
almost solemn film portrayal, with an Irish brogue voiceover throughout
its entirety, explaining every little piece of misery as if were a work
of sublime art, did not work for me.</P>
<P>Young Frank (played successively by Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael
Legge) is featured from his first confession (the best comic scenes to
come out of the film) to the first shilling he earns to support his
family to his first affair. The film has a bored look about it,
indicating nothing much is going to happen except for a string of gross
events and that Frank, as a survivor, will somehow come through all this
misery.</P>
<P>It almost seems to be a shame not to connect with the family's plight,
but as well-intentioned as this film was and as good as the Pulitzer
Prize winning autobiography was supposed to be (I didn't read it), it
was, nevertheless, made into a conventional film with nothing in it to
really rave about. Most life stories do not make for good dramatics in
films anyway, they seem better suited for the printed page. This one is
no exception.</P>
