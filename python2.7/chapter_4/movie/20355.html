<P> "You have to turn around, park in the lot and walk to the building. You
don't have a drive-on."
"Excuse me?"
"You don't have a drive-on, you have a walk-on."
"Is that the worst a person could get or is there like a crawl-on?"</P>
<P>Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie McDowell, Jeff Bridges.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>The movie is about Muses: descendants of the Gods said to be able to
inspire artists. I think Albert Brooks is a God. He hasn't made a bad
movie in his entire career (granted, a 6 film career, but six good films
in a row is a streak any filmmaker should be -- and is -- envious of).
At their worst his films are funny; at their best they are masterpieces
of comic precision and intelligent, tasteful humor.</P>
<P>The Muse, his new film, is a delightful experience. Charming, hilarious
and very Brook-ish, it is a worthy addition to what has been an
inordinately successful 20-year directing career. Brooks handles his
tricky material perfectly, cooking up an impeccable combination of the
supernatural, the off-beat and the Hollywood inside jokes.</P>
<P>Our protagonist is Steven Phillips, a heretofore successful screenwriter
who has just been fired. Why? Because he has "lost his edge".
Understandably Steven asks what that means. I began to wonder myself.
You hear that so often in the movie, tv and book business that it has
become a staple phrase and yet I don't know what the "edge" is and how
one can "lose" it. That is what everyone tells Steven when they read the
latest script and yet nobody is able to explain what it means. They all
advise that he take a year off work, get that mystical "edge" back.
That's not an option for him because he's no billionaire and he has a
family to feed. He's left up the creek without a paddle; he has no idea
what's wrong with his work or, more importantly, how he can fix it.</P>
<P>He pleads with his enviably successful screenwriter buddy Jack (Jeff
Bridges) for help. Jack divulges that he employs the services of a Muse.
That's right -- a Muse -- the mythical woman said to be able to breathe
inspiration into anyone with writer's/painter's/actor's/author's block.
The Muse's name is Sarah, and she's a tough cookie. First you have to
get her to "take your case", mainly by showering her with lavishly
expensive gifts. If she does decide to take you on you have to obey her
every command in return for alleged inspiration. She takes Steve on. She
orders that he put her up in a suite at the Four Seasons, run countless
errands for her and attend to her every wish. If he does, she insists,
he'll write a script that will make him so much money he may neverh ave
to write another one again.</P>
<P>The relationship between Steve and sarah gets weird. Brooks, bless his
soul, never lets The Muse develop into a romantic comedy. What he does
do, however, is have Sarah move in with Steve. At that point, various
guests come to Steve's home looking to use the Muse; people like Martin
Scorcese (who wants to remake Raging Bull with a really thin guy) and
James Cameron (no Titanic sequel for him, poor fella) all showing up
seeking inspiration. As if that wasn't enough, Sarah decides to assist
Steve's wife (Andie McDowell) in starting her own "Mrs. Fields" style
baking business, a fact which deeply troubles Steve.</P>
<P>The film's biggest commodity, of course, is the jokes, the jokes, the
jokes. They keep a-flyin', and the amazing thing is that they all work.
Well, almost. As a matter of fact, the ratio of gags to laughs rivals
that of Brooks classics such as the untouchable Defending Your Life.
This one may not be as profound or emotionally affecting as that film,
but it is at least just as funny.</P>
<P>Its claim to fame, however, is Sharon Stone as the leading lady in one
of her only comedic roles. And make no mistake, she is wonderful as the
mysterious title character. I doubt she will become a top-billed
comedianne anytime soon, but "this will do" wouldn't do her performance
justice. Equally successful is Andie McDowell, whom I didn't appreciate
as an actress up until this movie. Albert Brooks is as good a comic as
he is a director: his performance is typical but also typically
effective.</P>
<P>Unlike most other Albert Brooks films there is not much of substance in
The Muse, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. It's even better if
you know your movies: the countless Hollywood inside jokes can be easy
to miss if you don't get them. Even if you're not an insider you can
still enjoy this fluffy light comedy, a hilarious ode -- not a spoof but
a tribute -- to Hollywood; a film that emphasizes that there's no
business like showbusiness.
