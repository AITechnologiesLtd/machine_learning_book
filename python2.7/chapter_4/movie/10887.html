<PRE>Review: Starship Troopers</PRE>
<P>I know that Greek guy who is able to make the most absurd humorous
remarks while keeping a completely straight face.  Occasionally that
leaves you wonder if he just meant that last statement or whether he's
just pulling your leg again.  I, too, appear to have that ability with
a few people.  Some time ago we had an environmentaly conscious guest
in our house, and I could drive her up the wall with the most
outrageous anti-environmentalist opinions.  It took her quite a while
until she finally realized provocation was exactly what I was aiming
at, and nothing else.</P>
<P>What does that have to do with Starship Troopers?</P>
<P>I've seen the movie (twice by now) and enjoyed it immensely.  I'm
going to watch it a couple of times more.  Afterwards I read the
critiques, accusing it of bad taste, of cliche characters, of naive
soap opera schtick, of totally implausible science and action, of
fascist, Nazi subtext, and I couldn't believe it!</P>
<PRE>Don't you get it?</PRE>
<P>THE MOVIE IS A JOKE!  A JOKE!  A SATIRE!  It is so from the title
credits through the end credits.  And it's not involuntary humor.
That movie was made with the sole intent of parodying the fascist,
militarist vision of the future in Heinlein's novel, Starship
Troopers.  And display an amazing barrage of mindless F/X in the
bargain.</P>
<P>The depiction of the civilian life is, as many have pointed out yet,
reminiscent of Melrose Place.  The propaganda movie sequences you see
from time to time remind one of WWII propaganda, part German, part
American.  The barren alien planetscapes look like they're straight
out of Calvin's "Spaceman Spiff, Interplanetary Explorer
Extraordinaire" fantasies, and just like them they're populated solely
by hostile, alien, bug-eyed monsters.  The news coverage at the
beginning of the invasion of Klendathu (even that silly name would
have made me rest my case--if it weren't an invention of Heinlein's)
is, of course, "Gulf War, sponsored by CNN" all over.  When people get
gored and dismembered you can't help but have the duel between Arthur
and the Black Knight in Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail spring
to mind.</P>
<P>A few critics asked how you were supposed to care about such cheesily
constructed characters.  Answer: You don't.  You're not supposed to,
for crying out loud.</P>
<P>Someone mentioned that with the action set in Buenos Aires and even
called B.A.  and all the characters rather WASPish despite their
Spanish last names it all was more than a little reminiscent of the
L.A. of Beverly Hills 90210.  Why, you don't say!  Didn't it occur to
you that that might have been the point?</P>
<PRE>(Everybody sing: "I want to BE A part of B.A. Buenos Aires, Big
Apple!")</PRE>
<P>When the hero's cute love interest flies a shuttle to the ship she's
supposed to pilot she does so in a way that I'm guessing little girls
playing dolls imagine Barbie to go on a joyride--probably breaking
every law in the book, stretching design specifications to the limit,
but it's all right, because she's a "natural pilot," good at
everything.  Nothing could possibly go wrong with her at the helm.
Just a wild guess, but I think it's really no coincidence the
character actually looks like a lifesize Barbie doll.</P>
<P>When the three main characters vow to stay friends, and the smart guy
mentions it's highly unlikely they'll see each other again, you just
know they'll be united by the end.  When the soldier carrying the
radio equipment is caught by a giant bug and the squad leader shoots
him saying "I expect anybody to do the same for me!" you know someone
is going to have to do it for him soon.  You also know that someone is
going to have a moment of hesitation, needing encouragement from the
one about to die.  It's all war movie cliche so old it has a beard to
trip over.  And it all belongs in there.</P>
<P>When Carl Jenkins finally struts in wearing an SS uniform and talks
about the survival of the species, "us vs. them," that should have
been the last straw of realization.  (Hint: replace "species" with
"race.")</P>
<P>Accusing that movie of cheesiness and implausibility is like accusing
The Naked Gun and Airplane of the same deficiencies.  I don't get it.
If someone's managed to switch off their disbelief in Mars Attacks and
Men in Black and to just laugh, what kept them from doing the same
here?  The fact it didn't say "surreal comedy" in the trailer?</P>
<P>Actually that is a problem.  The hype appears to be targeted at the
wrong audience.  When I told a saleswoman at the bookstore I
patronize, who hadn't seen the movie yet, about its deliberate
absurdity, she replied you couldn't possibly tell that from the
advertising.</P>
<P>It takes about 10 minutes into the flick to fully recognize it for
what it is, but unlike with e.g. Men in Black you don't know what to
expect BEFORE the lights go down, unless someone has told you.  Many
weren't told, methinks, and they appeared to be less capable adapting.
A lot of the audience who thought it sucked were probably among the
target group who love Star Wars but wouldn't understand Spaceballs.
Or my Greek friend.  Or me.</P>
<P>Go and watch this movie.  It's cool beyond measure.  However, enjoy it
the way you enjoyed Men in Black (Uniform), not Star Wars or Alien.</P>
