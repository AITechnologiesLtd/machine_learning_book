<PRE>ME YOU THEM
-----------</PRE>
<P>When Darlene (Regina Case) returns to her poor home in the Brazilian Northeast
after giving birth to her son, she finds her mother being waked and her
old neighbor Osias (Lima Duarte) in a matrimonial frame of mind.  She gives
a second son to Osias, the homeowner, but her third belongs to his cousin
Zezinho (Stenio Garcia), the kindly homemaker.  A fourth son is clearly 
on the horizon with the arrival of handsome field worker Ciro (Luiz
Vasconcelos) in the Brazilian entry for Best Foreign Language Film, "Me
You Them."</P>
<P>While "Me You Them" is described as a film about a woman with three husbands,
it's really about how earth mother Darlene takes a series of lovers and
manages to keep peace among them.  Osias is a marriage of convenience - he
offers a roof, but uses Darlene as a cook, accountant and slave laborer.
Zezinho, who clearly adores his cousin's wife, gives Darlene the frienship
her husband does not.  Osias is duped by the affectionate couple until the
arrival of his second son, who bears the blue eyes of Zezinho.  Unexpected
jealousy causes Osias to take more of an interest in Darlene, accompanying
her and Zezinho to the dances they used to attend alone.  It's during one of 
these outings that Darlene meets Ciro (who resembles a "The Fly" era Jeff
Goldblum).  Osias offers to take Ciro in as a border to thwart Darlene's
romance with Zezinho, but they both lose out to the handsome stranger.
When Darlene confides to Zezinho that she's pregnant with Ciro's child and 
that he wishes to leave with her, Zezinho convinces Osias to build Ciro
his own room in order to get Darlene to stay.</P>
<P>Where Andrucha Waddington's film excels is in its ability to immerse us
in the culture and environment of a remote land.  Unlike the fantastical
Brazilian comedies "Woman On Top" and "Donna Flor and Her Two Husbands,"
"Me You Them" is very rooted in reality.  Life and conditions are harsh,
people are sturdy and get dirty working in the fields.  The film has a
bright glow about it, however, with brilliantly crisp lensing by Breno
Silveira.  And while Regina Case is no Penelope Cruz, she embodies a magnetic
vitality, an earthy sexiness.  Gilberto Gil's original music reflects
the regional sound, with heavy emphasis on the accordian.</P>
<P>"Me You Them" tells the tale of an extraordinary woman in a male dominated
society.  It will also transport you to a place of harsh and uncommon beauty.</P>
