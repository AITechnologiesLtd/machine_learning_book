<PRE>                              THE FIFTH ELEMENT
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Luc Besson
Starring Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman
A Columbia Release</PRE>
<P>The film Luc Besson had been wanting to make for ages is finally here.
And, its good fun! This film wa poorly recieved in America, with many
people saying that it was just 'rubbish.' But I found it enjoyable,
cheesy rubbish.  The film is knows it is cheesy, and never takes itself
seriously, which is what saves this film. If the film was serious the
whole way through, this would of been one of the worst films of 1997.
Willis plays a cab driver in the future, who is just driving along
until a young woman smashes through the roof. She turns out to be the
'fifth    element', who will save the earth from a planet heading
straight for it. However, they must stop Oldman from getting the her,
otherwise the whole world will be destroyed! Cheesy, eh?  But the film
makes up for its dreadful plot, with it sense of humour, and its very
good speacial    effects. Some of the effects are incredible. Willis
gives his usual 'John Maclane' performance, Oldman is just crazy, and
there is a D.J later on who did nothing but annoy me. But, generally,
the peformances are very good.</P>
<P>Overall, then, I found this film very enjoyable sci-fi hokum.
Recommended.</P>
<PRE>Overall Rating=**** out of *****
