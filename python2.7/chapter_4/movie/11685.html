<P>Looking inside the mind of a master musician, or at least composer, is
a difficult thing. The basic problem, which was seen through many other
reviews of this film, is that the consensus becomes one of idiocy,
stubbornness, and a maladjusted person.</P>
<P>Glenn Gould may have been all that, but his style and interpretation
of many classical pieces, is still one of the great achievements in
music in this century.  It is said that there is a fine line between
madness and genius, and the way this film is represented, there is also
a fine line between the directing and the truth.  As a film, it certainly
may not be liked.... the focus is the MUSIC, not the film.  And many
critics will not appreciate this.  But aside from that, what this
film does is what many film makers can not do.  Not only appreciate
the music itself, but also appreciate what it takes for a person to create
what he does.  It takes depth, and understanding.  It takes a lot of
intuition, where film might expect to find understanding and reasoning.
Glenn Gould is not about reason. Glenn Gould is about intuition.  And
this film is no less an exercise than the original inspiration...
certainly a compliment.</P>
<P>In thirty two little pieces, mostly in what we might consider a black
and white MTV style, the life and thoughts of Glenn Gould are sort
of displayed and shown.  There are no attempts to mediate, or define,
just a sort of interview with people that knew him, and just a few
other moments, of acting and directing license.  It creates a collage
where the music is the center of the activity, instead of one
man, something that Glenn states himself.</P>
<P>It is easy to see why this film was a darling of many film centers
and film festivals.  Amidst a more cultured audience, this is a very
nice tribute to a great musician this century. In the wider world,
where only Beethoven is the definition of classical music, the
appreciation of this piece of work is totaly lost.  One must not
only know the music, but also be familiar with different styles of
interpreting it.  Glenn Gould is about creating new visions off
the old, staid piece of music tat we have heard so much.</P>
<P>And, I am glad to say, that the film does the same.</P>
<P>Although, not specially done with audiences and film in mind, this
is quite an achievement, in creative thinking.  Putting together one
of these is almost like throwing things up in the air and picking
them up one at a time.  The final dimention was one of a chronological
styled ( very loose ) story.  But it could just as well have been done
in any other way.</P>
<P>Highly recommended film, if you not only love the music, but also the
musicianship behind it all.</P>
