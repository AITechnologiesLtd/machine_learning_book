<PRE>Welcome to Baltimore, Mary!</PRE>
<PRE>Review of Pecker (1998)</PRE>
<P>"Life isn't anything if you're not obsessed," declares young Pecker
(Edward Furlong). He ought to know. He's obsessed with taking photos of
everything he sees, froom a burger sizzling in griddle grease to rats
rutting in the trash. The movie opens in an almost sitcom fashion as we
are introduced to all the other obsessed people in his life. There's his
girlfriend Shelly (Christina Ricci), who controls her Spin and Grin
laundromat with neurotic verve; sister Tina (Martha Plimpton) is
enthusiastically gay friendly as she emcees the gay male go-go bar
dancers; friend Matt (Brendan Sexton III) sees his shoplifting tendencies
as a career choice; his father is obsessively anti-pubic hair; thrift-shop
running Mom (Mary Kay Place) is passionate about treating the homeless
humanely; kid sister Little Chrisy (Lauren Hulsey) shrieks until she is
plying her face with sweets; even Grandma ("Memama"; played by Jean
Schertler) has her shtick--treating her statue of the Blessed Virgin like
she's Charlie McCarthy.</P>
<P>Pecker holds a photo show in the greasy burger joint where he works, and
art dealer Rorey Wheeler (the ubiquitous Lili Taylor) walks in and turns
him into a star. She holds a show of his artwork up in New York, and has
her sights set on a show at the Whitney.</P>
<P>In equally sitcom fashion, there is a trip made up to his gallery show,
by all the aforementioned principals. Their homey and homespun obsesses
Ozzie-and-Harrietness is contrasted as fundamentally good and pure next to
the pretentious New York art scene. Mom has the homeless in for dinner
while his shoplifting buddy gets unheard-of action from not one but two
girls--being an instant celebrity just for appearing as a photo subject at
a gallery.</P>
<P>Fame and fortune turns them all off, and turns their lives upside down.
Pecker ensues by eschewing New York and his opportunities by only having
his art shows in Baltimore. A lot of this clearly comes from writer and
director John Waters's own experience from dealing with the New York art
world, and having home in both cities. But Baltimore is home and where his
heart is. And this is part of why the movie fails. The heavy handed
treatment of Baltimore is good and real and New York is bad and
pretentious makes everything a little stilted. It's like a campy version
of *Sunrise*.</P>
<P>But there are lots of wonderful little John Waters moments and dialogue
throughout the film that alleviate the sitcom stylings and more
black-and-white nature of the two-city rivalry. There are some great
lines, too: "I beg of you, do no become an asshole," "Public hair causes
crime," and Rorey telling Pecker, "How can you be so kind and gentle and
still have talent?"</P>
<P>And while the stiltedness is oppressive, his love of Baltimore is not. He
clearly loves his home town. I haven't seen so many scenes on public buses
since *A Bronx Tale*. The distinctly nondescript skyline of Baltimore is
featured prominently. A pit beef stand and a lesbian strip joint called
"The Pelt Room" are shown with great love and affection, as are most
of the "little places" and "little people" in the film.</P>
<P>One of the best scenes: Pecker and Shelly make out in a voting booth while
an unnaturally obsessed election worker seeks out the troublemakers
disrespecting the sanctity of the polling process. When disturbed, Shelly
retorts "I'm trying to VOTE!"</P>
<P>*Pecker*. Not one of John Waters's best, but still very enjoyable. Be
warned: Hairspray it ain't. Cameo appearances by Patty Hearst, Greg
Gorman, and photographer Cindy Sherman. Original music by Stewart
Copeland.</P>
