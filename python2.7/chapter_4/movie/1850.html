<PRE>                           THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN
                       A film review by Jean Yves Desbiens
                        Copyright 1993 Jean Yves Desbiens</PRE>
<PRE>     I saw the movie in a preview viewing last night; it opens Friday.</PRE>
<PRE>     This is my first review ever, so bear with me a little :-).</PRE>
<P>     I was ready to hate this movie; imagine a story on slavery,
hypocrisy, child abuse, Mark Twains legacy reduced to a pile of
harmless cliches by the great civilising influence ;-) of Disney.  But
this was not the case--I actually liked this movie.  I had not read the
book, but knew about its dark moments and talked with people who had
read it before seeing it.  Since it is based on a well-known book that
I haven't read, I will take for granted that they haven't changed the
story, save some cleaning in language; those in know will soon correct
me if I am wrong.</P>
<P>     There are some problems with this movie: the acting of the main
characters is sometimes a bit forced, the kid that plays Huck seems to
be camera-conscious, the dialogues are squeaky-clean (Disney label
picture), and of course the word Negro is not used by anybody in this
movie even though it would have been heard all the time in its
timeframe (but it is seen many times on a poster so they didn't go for
total PC).  The characterisation of the characters is also weak, but is
mainly because the book could hardly fit in a 1-hour 45-minute time
slot (this is already as long as any kid is expected to stay put for a
movie).  A "greater" more adult movie adaptation of the book would last
at least 2 hours and 30 minutes and seeing as the main actor is a
child, not many adults would want to see it and no child could see it.
Still, the movie seems a bit rushed.  Indeed the action never stops a
moment even when the situations would call for such a pause--no time
for grieving in this film.</P>
<P>     So what is good about this movie?  Well, actually it's the
identification of us with the child, his desire for liberty, to play,
to live and not have to worry about violence and other things, but
being confronted with it nevertheless.  Indeed, Huck is the rebel
within us all, the one that would want to just drift down life's river
without a care, doing as he pleases, but there are cares down this
river, choices have to be made and dangers circumvented.  Indeed, it's
implied by the book and movie that the search for freedom is not easy
and that our freedom and safety may come at the expense of others.
Last but not least, freedom from society is harder to accomplish than
merely running away from it; it permeates everything and always seam to
catch up with us along the way; its better to face the facts and rid
our minds off those ideas implanted in it and it is that that really
permits Jim, the slave that Huck has befriended to be finally free.
Jim goes against all the stereotypes that pervaded that era:  he is
physically powerful, but gentle and with a subtle way of putting his
idea across, he longs to be free (but won't rebel openly), he will wait
for the right time to continue his journey.  Jim is like the
Mississippi River, powerful but gentle, trapped within its banks until
rain comes and it spills over the banks.  The Mississippi, in fact, is
the main character in this movie--it's never very far away.</P>
<P>     As for performances, King played by Jason Robards is great, Huck's
father also turns in a great show in his evil ways, the kid that does
Huck is most of the time good; as for Jim played by another actor that
I don't remember the name of, his acting is uneven but still decent, as
is all the cast.</P>
<P>     Yes there are philosophical undertones to the movie (or is it just
me? :-)), but as the title suggests, this movie is at its base an
adventure towards a place where freedom and dreams lies down a mighty
river with the countless dangers of human nature spread along the way.
As such, it works pretty well, as I already said; the compression of
everything in so little time pretty much makes it a non-stop ride with
humour and danger stalking every step.  And to my great relief, the
pipe-smoking Huck is still there (there will be outcry about that one I
am sure).  This film is violent but unlike other movies it is not
graphic.  People do get hurt and even our heroes gets hurt--violence is
not glorious here; it is a sort of disease that pervades the whole
area, it's apparent that this is the case (an
America=gratuitous-violence allusion is even made as a sarcastic
joke).  That is why I think this movie, while violent, sometimes scary
for kids, is highly recommended by me for them, even adults who will
want see a nice adaptation of a classic book can enjoy this movie.</P>
<P>     So recapitulating, this is a movie parents should be taking kids
to.  It is violent, scary, but also humourous, action-filled, and even
thought provoking.  Ideally, parents should set up this movie before
viewing with some explanations about what was going on (but this is
probably to much to ask); a discussion should also follow the viewing,
answering the many questions the children will certainly have about
what they have seen.  I know that this demands some effort and that
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES demand no efforts at all (although there
the violence is seen as a fun thing if you see through their ninja oat
mumbo-jumbo), but this will be rewarding.  The theater was filled with
kids and their parents when I went there and there was very little
talking by them (5-15 years mostly).  Imagine, 400 kids riveted for an
hour and forty-five minutes; it is not an easy feat.  This movie should
do well if the reaction to this preview is any indication--even
applause at the end!  As for the adults, find the child within and you
will enjoy Huck Finn, I sure did (but I read rec.arts.disney so I am
biased :-).</P>
<P>Rating on a scale of one to ten: 9 for kids, 7 for adults.</P>
