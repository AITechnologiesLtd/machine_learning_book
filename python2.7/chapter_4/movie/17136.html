<PRE>Children Of Heaven ***1/2</PRE>
<P>rated PG
in Persian with English subtitles
starring Mohammad Amir Naji, Fereshte Sarabandi, Karnal Mirkarimi
written and directed by Majid Majidi</P>
<P>Once in a very long while, a film comes along that doesn't need an
epic story in order to grasp the viewer and tell a simple story in an
epic way. Majid Majidi's CHILDREN OF HEAVEN is such a film. Over the
years, Iranian directors have shown skill in telling a simple but
subtle BICYCLE THIEFesque story. The reason for this is that in a
country like Iran, where there is no freedom of speech, you cannot
degrade the country in any way, especially on film. So the filmmakers
had to be able to express art with subtlety, as to not generate
controversy.</P>
<P>CHILDREN OF HEAVEN tells the story of a small, impoverished Iranian
boy who goes to the marketplace and gets his sister's shoes stolen by
accident. The boy promises his sister that she will get the shoes
back, as long as she doesn't tell their parents. The children must
then share one pair of sneakers, to be traded back and forth between
the time they go to school(she goes in the morning, while he goes in
the afternoon). The children try some clever schemes in order to get
the shoes back, but none of them seem to work. That is really the
film's entire plot, but it moves rather swiftly and never becomes
dull(in Iran, it was a huge hit among children). But during the film,
if you pay close attention, you can tell that Majidi is actually
crafting a brilliant study on the different wealth classes of Iran. In
short, CHILDREN OF HEAVEN deserves it's Oscar nomination for Best
Foreign Language Film just as much or even more than any of the other
nominees, and it makes you wish that Miramax spent just as much money
promoting this film as it did LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL or SHAKESPEARE IN
LOVE.  </P>
