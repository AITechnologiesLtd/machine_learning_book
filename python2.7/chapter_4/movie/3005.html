                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Despite his immense popularity and acclaim, George Lucas has never
been a particularly prolific filmmaker.  His projects often seem to
remain in various stages of development for many years.  Once they do
go before the cameras, he puts a lot of love and care into the films
usually paying an exceptional amount of attention to detail.  Still,
his films don't always seem to work.  At his best, he creates films
like AMERICAN GRAFITTI and the STAR WARS and Indiana Jones trilogies.
Other times, he can end up making a MORE AMERICAN GRAFITTI or even a
HOWARD THE DUCK.  The slow rate with which Lucas makes films and the
incredible care that go into them always make these failures feel
particularly disappointing.  Unfortunately, RADIOLAND MURDERS, Lucas'
first film in 5 years, joins this group of carefully crafted, lovingly
created disappointments.</P>
<P>     The film is a frantically paced farce set in 1929 during the
premiere broadcast of a brand new Chicago-based radio network.  The
standard opening night problems are largely overshadowed by a series of
mysterious murders that keep occurring during the broadcast. Penny
Henderson (Mary Stuart Masterson), the network's "general secretary",
desperately struggles to keep the broadcast going while her estranged
husband Roger (Brian Benben), the network's head writer, searches for
the real killer after becoming the prime suspect.  This plot is
virtually lost in a constant barrage of sight gags and breathlessly
delivered one-liners.</P>
<P>     Lucas first expressed his intention to eventually make this film
shortly after making AMERICAN GRAFITTI in the early 1970s.  The film
has occasionally appeared on Universal and Lucasfilm's production
schedule many times over those years.  The script is credited to
GRAFITTI authors Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (who also worked with
Lucas on INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and HOWARD THE DUCK)
along with TV writers Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn.  The story is credited
to Lucas himself.  The result was a script that tries to do *far* too
much in too little time.  It seems like all of these writers
contributed a whole bunch of ideas and gags, all of which were left
in.</P>
<P>     The potentially interesting plot and characters seem to be
entirely lost in the shuffle.  Since the gags aren't involving
characters that we care (or even *know*) anything about or a plot that
is particularly well developed, there is very little about it that is
actually funny.  The murder mystery aspect is also ineffective since we
never learn anything about the killer's motivations until the standard
confession that comes *after* we learn the identity.  It is hard to
care about a mystery when you can't even think of who might be a
suspect.  When we do learn the killer's motivations, it is easy to see
that there were some interesting ideas at the core of Lucas' story, but
that they seemed to be lost somewhere along the way.  Even after the
killer's identity is revealed, the film goes on to an elaborate action
climax that starts off somewhat cliched but eventually turns downright
weird and inexplicable.</P>
<P>     The movie also has some major problems with pacing.  For farce to
really work, the troubles need to slowly escalate over the course of
the story.  This movie maintains a breakneck pace from the very first
scene, never slowing down.  The movie is played like a series of
punchlines without any setups.  Slapstick always works best if it comes
suddenly and as something of a surprise.  Someone being knocked over by
a swinging door can be funny if it is unexpected.  It quickly ceases to
be funny when pretty much every character is *repeatedly* knocked over
by every door they encounter.  Director Mel Smith sticks almost
entirely to *very* brief takes with constant cuts.  The result is often
confusing with most of the gags off-screen before they even have a
chance to register.</P>
<P>     The cast includes many fine comedic actors, but most are given
absolutely nothing to do.  Such varied performers as Christopher Lloyd,
Michael McKean, George Burns, Ned Beatty, Jeffrey Tambor, Rosemary
Clooney and Anita Morris (in her final film role) drift through various
scenes without ever really doing much.  The actors playing the radio
network's writing staff include talented comic actors Harvey Korman,
Robert Klein, and Peter MacNichol, but none of them are even given much
in the way of dialog.  Only Bobcat Goldthwait is given much screen time
in this group and he does generate a few laughs even though he is
strictly playing his standard character.</P>
<P>     Masterson and Benben do the very best they can given the limited
opportunities.  Benben is essentially playing a variation on his
character from the HBO sitcom "Dream On", but he does manage to be
likable and convincing.  Even better is Masterson who manages to
maintain a strong aire of dignity throughout all of this.  In a few
scenes, we actually see some interesting chemistry between Masterson
and Benben and it is a shame that the film doesn't spend more time on
their relationship.  The movie resolves the main conflict in their
relationship far too early, eventually resulting in the two characters
snapping at each other for no apparent reason.</P>
<P>     Easily the best performance in the film is given by Michael Lerner
as the police detective who is investigating the murders.  He
constantly rises above the material to create the one character that
seems to actually have a little bit of depth.  He is often playing the
straight man here, but that allows him to stay out of the way of some
of the insanity.</P>
<P>     As is expected in a George Lucas movie, the technical aspects of
this film are very strong.  The film was reportedly made on a very low
budget, but it looks much more expensive.  There are a couple of
elaborate action sequences (mostly involving Benben climbing around
outside the studios) that are very convincing and inventively
photographed (mainly thanks to the folks at ILM). Like all of Lucas'
movies, this one is handsomely photographed in scope.</P>
<P>     The film also does a very good job at creating an appropriate
period look and feel.  The sets, costumes, production design, and Joel
McNeely's music all seem to fit in perfectly.  A little suspension of
disbelief is required to get past the fact that some of the programs
shown seem a little overly visual for radio, but that is pretty easily
accepted because they are being performed for a live audience.  I wish
they film would have spent more time showing the actual radio
broadcasts.  These created most of the film's most enjoyable moments.</P>
<P>     It is probably appropriate to comment a little bit about the
audience's reaction to the movie.  Much to my surprise, the other
people in the audience seemed to be laughing a lot more than I was.  At
times, other people in the theater were rather loudly laughing at
points when I didn't notice that anything was particularly funny.  I
don't know if I am starting to become somewhat over-critical or if it
was simply a case of comedy being highly subjective, but the rest of
the audience did seem to enjoy the movie a lot more than I did.</P>
<P>     I went into this movie *really* wanting to like it as I am a huge
George Lucas fan and the subject matter and cast are all very appealing
to me.  Unfortunately, it just didn't work for me and I was left
extrmely disappointed.</P>
