<P>Starring Thandie Newton, David Thewlis. Rated R.</P>
<P>What we have here is one of that rare breed of movies that can flaunt
both style and substance; visual éclat as well as thoughtful thematic
undertones. Coming to us from the famed Italian director Bernardo
Bertolucci (The Last Emperor, Stealing Beauty), Besieged is an
involving, artful love story and a meditative look at lives lost and
lives gained as one moves to a higher social existence.</P>
<P>The film begins with African folk music, and a young woman named
Shangurai (Thandie Newton) riding her bike along a bumpy road in what
seems to be South Africa. Menacing-looking cars pass her, and before
long she sees her husband, a local schoolteacher, being dragged to jail.
Devastated, Shangurai relocates to Rome (the move happens in a flash: I
missed it), where she becomes a live-in housekeeper for an eccentric
American man named Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis).</P>
<P>Kinsky falls in love with the beautiful Shangurai and passionately asks
for her hand in marriage, saying that he will do anything to make her
love him, to which she responds "Get my husband out of jail!" The
impeccably well-intentioned Kinsky backs off, and unbeknownst to her
starts a campaign to set Shangurai's hubby free. Evidently, she figures
it out and is shocked, because he sells everything, including his
beloved piano to make his love happy.</P>
<P>The significance of Besieged lies in the transition between Shangurai's
two lives. Her first is the one she led in Africa, and the culture and
memories stick with her. She has trouble letting them go; this is
manifested through music and her faith for her lost husband. And yet as
her life in Rome progresses, she is mesmerized by Kinsky and his
existence until finally, in the ending, their heretofore affair erupts
and leaves Shangurai's previous life outside the front door.</P>
<P>This is at the core of Bertolucci's film, which actually consists of
minimal dialogue. What it does have, however, is visuals aplenty; a
cornucopia of gorgeous images and deft camerawork. Bertolucci has a way
of moving the camera at blazing speed yet having the film flow smoothly.
Watch for this during Shangurai and Kinsky's first main conversation:
the lens moves frantically from one face to the other creating a level
of tension while at the same time maintaining the film's consistently
hypnotic mood and pace.</P>
<P>I liked Thandie Newton (Beloved) as Shangurai, with her achingly
expressive eyes and her trembling yet assertive voice. I likewise
enjoyed the underused David Thewlis in the Kinsky role, although neither
performance will earn any formal recognition because of the lack of
dramatic dialogue involved.</P>
<P>Besieged is a solid, unpretentious arthouse dweller (is there such a
thing?) that doesn't aim very high and hits the target. It's a light
endeavor that doesn't stay with you for long (although the ending is
powerful) but it's nevertheless an effective love story all the while
being a thoughtful meditation on the social differences of life in two
separate worlds.
