<P>Hilary and Jackie is about two musician sisters and their lives
together.  As a child, Hilary du Pre (Keeley Flanders) is a phenomenal
flautist who overshadows her cellist sister, Jackie (Auriol Evans).  The
girls love each other very much, but Jackie doesn't like the competition
aspect of their lives, forced upon them by their mother (Celia Imrie). 
So, she quickly masters her instrument, making it clear to everyone that
she is a musical genius.  Soon, Jackie is the focus of everyone around
her.</P>
<P>Inevitably, the girls grow into young women; Jackie (played by Emily
Watson as an adult) is now performing solo recitals, but Hilary (Rachel
Griffiths) is struggling with her flute lessons.  From that point, the
film shows us the next twenty years from the perspective of both women. 
We first see Hilary's life, in which she meets and falls in love with
Kiffer Finzi (David Morrissey).  The last third of the film is told
through Jackie's eyes, and we see her rise into stardom and her decline
into multiple sclerosis.</P>
<P>Hilary and Jackie is one of the most masterful films of 1998.  Not
since The Truman Show have I seen a film that so flawlessly integrates
skillful acting, lush cinematography, and a wonderful story into a
satisfying, moving motion picture that will resonate in memory long
after the credits roll.  But it's not just an exercise in good film
making -- Hilary and Jackie has a beautiful emotional core that shows us
a fascinating relationship between two extremely interesting women.  </P>
<P>The first element that most moviegoers are likely to notice is the
scenery and cinematography.  The film was directed by Anand Tucker, a
man who clearly understands that the image on screen needs to be as
powerful as the contents of the story.  Along with David Johnson's
superb cinematography, Tucker has made a film of immense visual wealth. 
The colors are vibrant and vigorous; later in the film, when Hilary is
living in the countryside, the way Johnson photographs the huge,
sprawling fields and rolling hills of wildflowers is truly
breathtaking.  Also notable are the scenes in which Jackie performs the
cello -- the passion that emanates through the instrument bursts out of
the screen, making every such scene an exciting, visceral experience.</P>
<P>Of course, much of the excitement comes from Emily Watson's
performance.  Here is a woman who has made three films, and in those
three films has proven a range of acting that most experienced actresses
will never show.  Her first starring role, in Breaking the Waves, earned
her an Oscar nomination, and I sincerely hope that she earns the same
honor for Hilary and Jackie.  I don't know if Watson can really play the
cello, but she does a perfect job of pretending in the scenes that
require her to perform.  But what I really admire about Watson -- and
about the entire film, for that matter -- is her emotional honesty.  I
got lost in her performance, lost in the fact that I was watching
someone act.  </P>
<P>Rachel Griffiths shows just as much skill as Watson does, even though
she doesn't have quite as much material to work with.  The film is based
on the book A Genius in the Family, written by Hilary and Piers du Pre
(it's all based on a true story, just in case you didn't know); the
picture could have easily focused on Jackie, and made the relationship a
side note in the story.  I'm glad that screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce
chose not to do this, though, since the relationship between Jackie and
Hilary is what makes the film so fascinating:  even through all the
competition, the two women never stop loving each other.  It's one of
the most layered, moving relationships to emerge from any film this
year.  In a year in which so many films have regurgitated themes and
images that we've all seen countless times before, the people behind
Hilary and Jackie have brought us a visually and emotionally profound
film -- a piece of cinematic art that I will never forget.</P>
