<P>So, in the wee early morning hours of Monday (well, not that early),
while having my breakfast cereal, I see in the newspaper that "Austin
Powers" has utterly crushed "Star Wars" this weekend.  Ah, well, it's
definitely a funnier film.</P>
<P>Uttering "Austin Powers" and "Star Wars" in the same breath isn't an
outlandish thing.  "Austin Powers" had at least a few "Star Wars"
references, from its advertising campaign to the opening text crawl.
We can take it a bit further, and say that Dr. Evil is, like, the
lightsabre duel, Austin himself was sort of like the Pod Race, and no
one was Jar Jar Binks.  Well, I could have done with less Fat Bastard,
but I don't think, Fat Bastard Die Die Die.  "Austin Powers" is a very
consistently funny movie, without many soft spots.  Some things go on
for too long, like your typical SNL skit, but not many.</P>
<P>What plot there is centers on Dr. Evil going back in time to steal
Austin's mojo.  This is basically an excuse to wander into all sorts of
shameless product placements, the most inspired of which is the one for
the new Volkswagen Beetle; psychedelic Sixties theme park fun with
Heather Graham in short-shorts; and some very neat jokes with clueless,
displaced Sixties personalities who have seen the future but have now
been sent back to their home turf.  Dr. Evil trying and badly failing
to use late 1990s-isms was inspired ("One hundred billion dollars!"), a
sort of conscious set of reversals from the usual man-out-of-time
idioms.  Austin himself was less interesting in this regard.</P>
<P>I'm starting to think that cultural critics of the 21st Century will
recognize Jerry Springer as a brilliant auteur, conjuring forth a
subtle performance art piece on a daily basis, casting it as a lewd
talk show in order for his devastating social criticism of fin-de-siecle
America to reach the widest audience in the most subversive way
possible.  But I could be wrong.  I've only watched one of his shows,
when I was on sick leave last year.</P>
<P>I actually didn't like the original movie all that much.  It plodded
along: once you get the idea of spy movie-spoof guys from the 1960s
trying to make it thirty years later, you have a lot of the joke.
That's material for half-hour sitcoms (South Park actually had a
wonderful episode of this, with an ice man from 1996 being revived in
1999: Land's End, Ace of Base, and the Internet was difficult to get
on), not feature-length films.  This new movie just works better by not
paying much attention to that idea, by self-consciously pointing out
how silly the movie is ("It's remarkable how much the English
countryside looks like southern California", and the London street
scene with sun-burnt hills in the background), and by playing with the
aforementioned man-out-of-time-back-in-time jokes.</P>
<P>Oh, stay for the entire credits.  Little skits in the credits.  And the
DVD for this movie _must_, absolutely _must_ have karaoke.</P>
