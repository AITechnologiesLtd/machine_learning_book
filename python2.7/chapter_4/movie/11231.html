<P>     THE CROW will forever be remembered as the final performance of 
budding star Brandon Lee, who died as a result of a tragic behind-the-
scenes accident.  However, as intense as the hype associated with Lee's 
death was, it could not obscure the most impressive aspect of the 1994 
feature:  director Alex Proyas' startling, unforgettable vision.  It's 
rare for any film maker, whether a veteran or a newcomer, to create the 
kind of compelling, endlessly-fascinating environment that Proyas 
brought to the screen in THE CROW.  Now, with his follow-up movie, DARK 
CITY, the director incredibly manages to one-up himself.</P>
<P>     No movie can ever have too much atmosphere, and DARK CITY exudes it 
from every frame of celluloid.  Proyas' world isn't just a playground 
for his characters to romp in -- it's an ominous place where viewers can 
get lost.  We don't just coolly observe the bizarre, ever-changing 
skyline; we plunge into the city's benighted depths, following the 
protagonist as he explores the secrets of this grim place where the sun 
never shines.  DARK CITY has as stunning a visual texture as that of any 
movie that I've seen.  Line up the other recent candidates, which 
include Tim Burton's BATMAN, Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER, Jean-Pierre 
Jeunet and Marc Caro's DELICATESSAN and THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, and 
Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, and DARK CITY equals or bests them all.  
Visually, this film isn't just impressive, it's a tour de force.</P>
<P>     Thankfully, DARK CITY doesn't have an "all style, no substance" 
problem, either, because there's a mind-challenging story to go along 
with the eye candy.  Proyas hasn't written this film for the passive 
viewer.  To become involved in DARK CITY, thinking is mandatory.  Unless 
you're puzzling out the answers alongside John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), 
you're going to miss more than one revelation.  Very little is spelled 
out in this movie; the answers are all there, but you have to recognize 
them for what they are.  How often do we get features like this, that 
don't pander to the least common denominator?</P>
<P>     Ironically, two months into 1998, my top three films to date 
(SLIDING DOORS, OPEN YOUR EYES, and DARK CITY) all question the nature 
of identity and reality.  DARK CITY is much like OPEN YOUR EYES (which 
was shown at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and will open theatrically 
later this year in North America) -- both are meditations on the 
importance of memory to an individual, and how everyone's personality is 
comprised of the sum total of his or her remembrances.  In the way DARK 
CITY tinkers with the boundaries of what's real and what isn't, it 
recalls THE GAME.  Some viewers may also be reminded of TOTAL RECALL, 
although Proyas' film plunges deep into issues that the Schwarzenegger 
vehicle used as icing for an action-laden cake.</P>
<P>     DARK CITY opens by immersing the audience in the midst of a 
fractured, nightmarish narrative.  The protagonist, who later learns 
that his name is John Murdoch, has amnesia.  He begins his "new life" as 
a full-grown adult naked in a bath tub, uncertain of how he got there.  
His only company in the grungy hotel suite is the nude body of a dead 
prostitute.  Did he kill her or not?  He doesn't know.  Suddenly, 
Murdoch receives a phone call from someone named Dr. Schreber (Kiefer 
Sutherland), who claims to have his best interests at heart.  Schreber 
warns him to get out of the hotel immediately.  Soon, without a clue 
about his identity, Murdoch is fleeing from corpse-like creatures with 
incredible mental powers.  But it turns out that Murdoch is not 
defenseless against his enemies -- his mind, like theirs, can shape 
reality, although he doesn't understand how to harness his abilities.  
Soon, his quest to unearth his past links him up with Emma (Jennifer 
Connelly), a woman who is supposedly his wife, and Police Inspector 
Bumstead (William Hurt), who believes Murdoch to be innocent of the 
prostitute's murder.  But Murdoch's small group of allies offer little 
help when it comes to dealing with his powerful, ghoulish adversaries, 
the amoral Mr. Book (Ian Richardson) and Mr. Hand (Richard O'Brien).  </P>
<P>     Proyas' inspiration for his Dark City appears to be New York during 
the first half of this century, but, using a style that is part science 
fiction, part noir thriller, and part gothic horror, he has embellished 
it to create a surreal place unlike no other.  Film lovers will find 
that DARK CITY is overflowing with references to classic pictures -- 
everything from the silent DRACULA adaptation, NOSFERATU, to Hitchcock's 
masterful VERTIGO.  Throw in a little TWILIGHT ZONE and STAR TREK for 
good measure.  Even if you get bored with the storyline, which is 
extremely unlikely, there are still plenty of these little details to 
absorb your attention.</P>
<P>     Proyas' excellent vision extends to his casting choices.  Rufus 
Sewell (currently appearing in DANGEROUS BEAUTY) makes a perfect John 
Murdoch, since he is equally good as a confused, desperate refugee and 
an avenging angel.  Kiefer Sutherland, affecting a limp and a strange 
accent, evokes images of a Nazi scientist who's more concerned with the 
experiment than with its victims.  Jennifer Connelly, who looks the part 
of a classy, black-and-white screen siren, plays her femme fatale role 
to a "T".  And William Hurt is sufficiently gruff in the kind of part 
that Humphrey Bogart would have been at home in.  </P>
<P>     If there's a flaw with DARK CITY (and it's a small one, to be 
sure), it's that the film takes a little too long forging a link between 
the audience and Murdoch.  For the first thirty minutes, we're left 
floating, watching the confounding narrative unfold, marveling over the 
strange occurrences, and waiting for film to really grab us.  Once that 
happens, it's difficult not to become completely engrossed.  So, is the 
lengthy setup necessary?  Almost certainly, and, as I said, any slow 
spots are only a tiny blemish on the face of a film that offers a 
gratifyingly original and stunning science fiction experience.</P>
