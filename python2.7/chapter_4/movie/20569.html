<P>They call it "batting a thousand."  For the third time, Kevin Costner
(THE POSTMAN) turns to the game of baseball for the setting within which
to tell a multilayered story and for the third time, connects for a hit.</P>
<P>In BULL DURHAM, he played an aging minor league catcher tapped to hone a
promising young talent for the majors.  In so doing, he taught Susan
Sarandon a little about love.  In FIELD OF DREAMS, he played an aging
baseball fan, who listening to voices, built a baseball diamond in his
cornfield.  In so doing, he taught James Earl Jones a little about hope
and believing.</P>
<P>In FOR LOVE OF THE GAME, Mr. Costner takes on the role of an aging
pitcher playing in what could quite possibly turn out to be his final
game.  During his illustrious 19 year career Billy Chapel has been the
mainstay of the Detroit Tigers organization.  Just prior to the final game
of a somewhat dismal season, he finds out that his girlfriend of five
years is leaving him and that his team has been sold to parties who may
wish to trade him.</P>
<P>As he takes the mound against the Yankees in what should be a meaningless
game, the thoughts that run through his mind are played out on the screen
for us to view.  Alternating between what's happening in the game and what
has happened in his past, For Love Of The Game tells the story of an
"old-school" ballplayer reflecting on his life in and out of the sport.
As the movie progresses, we, along with Billy, begin to realize that this
game is taking on an import that reaches beyond statistics or the
scoreboard.</P>
<P>Based on the novel by Michael Shaara, director Sam Raimi (A SIMPLE PLAN)
and screenwriter Dana Stevens (CITY OF ANGELS) present a film which is
surprisingly paced much like the game itself.  It is slow at times but
always moving, with just enough "highlight reel" moments to make things
interesting.</P>
<P>Kevin Costner adds another "Aw shucks" adult boy scout characterization
to his resume with his portrayal of Billy Chapel.  But there is something
about this "too good to be true" ballplayer that will immediately appeal
to the baseball purist.  Throughout everything else in his life --
mistakes he has made or regrets he may carry -- the one constant is his
"love of the game" of baseball.  The business surrounding the game may
have changed over the years, but his love for it hasn't, nor has the rules
by which he plays.</P>
<P>Kelly Preston (HOLY MAN) plays Jane Aubrey, the woman who tries to have a
relationship with a man whose first love involves eight other men.  Miss
Preston is quite touching in her performance as a woman, scarred by the
past and scared of the future.  She is sure that she loves Billy but she
is uncertain if he will ever love her enough.  Her confusion regarding the
unusual "love triangle" in which she finds herself is genuine and
heartfelt.</P>
<P>John C. Reilly (NEVER BEEN KISSED) is Gus, the compassionate catcher and
sounding board for Billy.  Jena Malone (STEPMOM) completes the cast of
central characters as Heather, the troubled teen aged daughter of Jane.</P>
<P>There is a reason baseball is known as "America's Pastime."  The game
reaches us on a level few other sports can, evoking memories and emotions
that will never be forgotten.  At its purest level, baseball is a
wholesome, family-oriented game that can both entertain and inspire.</P>
<P>The game is also rife with spiritual or biblical lessons and analogies
and has long been used as subject matter for sermons and teachings in many
biblically based ministries.</P>
<P>To point to just one example: throughout the game, Billy demonstrates an
uncanny ability to block out the distractions of the ballpark in order to
focus completely on his task at hand...pitching to whichever batter is
opposing him.  He calls it "clearing the mechanism."  God calls it
singleness of mind and it is just one key to success that the Bible
teaches us.  There are more... many more... that we may study and apply to
live a life more than abundant.</P>
<P>Three is a number which biblically signifies completeness of a unit.
With FOR LOVE OF THE GAME as the third installment to his baseball movie
trilogy,  Mr. Costner completes a wonderful tribute to a wonderful game.</P>
