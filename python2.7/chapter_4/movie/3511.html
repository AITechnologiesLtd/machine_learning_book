<PRE>                            WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     In case you aren't already prepared, brace yourself for a literal
onslaught of summer movie romances.  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is one of
1995's early entries.  It certainly isn't going to be the best.</P>
<P>     As heavily promoted as it's been, you should know the plot by know. 
Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a goofy, salt-of-the-earth Chicago Transit
Authority toll booth attendant who falls in love (at first sight) with
Peter (Peter Gallagher), a yuppie lawyer.  Almost immediately after Lucy
swoons, Peter gets pushed onto the train tracks, whereupon Lucy comes to
the rescue.  Then the obligatory "misunderstanding" occurs:  Peter's
concerned parents think Lucy is Peter's fiancee, pulling Lucy into the
family as a new member.  But when Peter's brother Jack (Bill Pullman)
arrives on the scene, Lucy and Jack begin to fall in love and, well ...
you get the picture.</P>
<P>     Or maybe you don't.  Most of the film is pretty nonsensical.  It's
predictable at best and just plain dull most of the time, focusing ad
nauseam on Lucy's moral dilemma about whether or not to end her charade. 
Slapstick is the preferred method of making the audience laugh:  there is
a considerable amount of falling down and other humorous forms of injury. 
Peter's dysfunctional family is good for a few laughs, but otherwise I
barely cracked a smile.</P>
<P>     The sad thing about WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING isn't just the lack of
originality and humor, rather, it's the statement that the film ultimately
makes.  The movie's apparent bottom line is that people can be really
shallow, but that's okay, because love will conquer everything, and it
doesn't matter who gets trampled along the way.  When you think about it,
it's not just annoying, it's insulting.</P>
