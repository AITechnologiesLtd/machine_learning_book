<P>On Halloween 1991 three huge, nasty, raging weather systems collided 
in the North Atlantic to produce a storm that has been variously 
called the storm of the century, the perfect storm (no callousness 
here, just a meteorologist's view) and other superlatives. It did a 
lot of damage at sea as well as on land.</P>
<P>Commercial fishing is a dangerous profession. In the film we see the 
real monument dedicated to the ten thousand Gloucester people who 
died at sea between 1626 and our day.</P>
<P>New Englander Sebastian Junger, who was living in Gloucester, Mass., 
at the time, wrote the best-selling book "The Perfect Storm" which 
focused on a swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, which ventured to 
sea at a risky time and eventually found itself in the eye of the 
storm.</P>
<P>The fishing season is about over. It has not been kind to Andrea 
Gail's Captain Tyne (Clooney) and his small crew. The boat returns to 
Gloucester after a last, unproductive outing. Most of their meager 
earnings goes to the ship owner (a political criticism here?). 
Captain Tyne decides to take a chance on a last sortie, in spite of 
the dangerously late season.</P>
<P>The first 40 or 45 minutes concentrate on the background,   the 
people of Gloucester, variously sketched portraits and relationships 
of the fishermen of the Andrea Gail. Given the total length of the 
film (two-and-a-half hours) my first reaction to this focus on people 
was that it was too little. My second reaction was "too much." My 
third and last one was "just right." Less stress would have 
de-personalized the characters. More stress might be forcing the 
dosage by getting too generous with psycho-sociological issues among 
essentially normal working-class persons.</P>
<P>When the boat takes to the ocean again and the results are not 
brilliant, the Captain decides to push his luck (or is it unluck?) by 
pushing on to a dangerous place called the Flemish Cap which is at 
the edge of the fishing map. It's taking a big chance, but "that's 
where the fish are."</P>
<P>The perilous venture is an adventure, but the fishing is a bonanza of 
swordfish worth a quarter million dollars. Then  the ice-making 
machine goes kaput while the weather turns very nasty. If the boat 
stays put and waits for better conditions, the haul will spoil. The 
men vote to return to port in spite of the weather -- which goes from 
bad to worse and from worse to unspeakably horrible.</P>
<P>The storm is the real raison d'etre of the movie. And it goes on and 
on. And it's a lulu, that is, a killer lulu. If, until it really 
hits, you thought that the film had its share of deja vu, the storm 
makes it a "jamais vu" ("never seen"). With a super-lavish, quite 
extraordinary use of special effects, tricks of the trade, digital 
manipulations, and the largest studio tank made even bigger, the 
images and their motions are stunning. While you know that it's all 
done with mirrors, you can't help getting gripped. The screen 
transports you from edge-of-the seat tension to nail-biting to 
heart-stopping reactions. Yes, it's only a movie, but its raw 
suspense gets scarier and scarier, what with waves reaching a height 
of one hundred feet, what with a pleasure craft, a small yacht on its 
way to Bermuda  also getting hit by the Revenge of Neptune, what with 
totally convincing and heroic efforts of a Coast Guard helicopter 
trying to save the souls at sea,  what with refueling the 'copter in 
the air... and much else which I will not mention.</P>
<P>It's funny how connections are made in one's mind. Somehow I kept 
thinking about The Cruel Sea. That was a best-seller by Nicholas 
Montsarrat, about convoy duty in the Royal Navy during WWII. A fine 
movie was made of the book in 1953, with a script by the great Eric 
Ambler.</P>
<P>Direct connections that the viewers can make after seeing the picture 
would be two different, very good one-hour programs on cable, one 
stressing the making of the movie, the other stressing the fishermen 
of Gloucester. And another private connection to me in "The Perfect 
Storm" is the memorial service where is sung "Eternal Father, Strong 
to Save" also known as "For Those in Peril on the Sea" which, with 
different words, was my school's song.</P>
<P>German-born director Petersen is good at "Sturm und Drang" (Storm and 
Stress) situations, and good too at motley people confined within one 
space. He did both with his "Das Boot" (1981) the best ever submarine 
film, with the fanciful "Air Force One," and does it here again, 
spectacularly. If he could show "Storm" in 3-D he'd have audiences 
bringing raincoats to the theater.</P>
<P>"Das Boot" was at first a very successful German TV miniseries, then 
became the major international hit. (It is, by the way, one of the 
most mispronounced titles in English, since it should sound like 
"boat" and not "boot").  Its success opened American doors to 
Petersen. There followed some ho-hum pictures, "The Neverending 
Story," "Enemy Mine, " and "Shattered." He bounced back with the 
thriller "In The Line Of Fire" starring Clint Eastwood back-slid with 
"Outbreak," and picked up again with "Air Force One."</P>
<P>Petersen is now an "American" director, but several of his earlier 
German movies, about 20  in 1967-78, mostly for German TV, were 
remarkable. I would strongly recommend "Die Konsequenz" (1977) and 
especially "Black and White Like Day and Night," (1978), starring 
Bruno Ganz in a fascinating, unusual work about obsession with chess, 
made just before "Das Boot." It is available from Facets (www. 
facets.org), the premier video source in the country. Like many of 
the earlier Petersen films it shows that he is not only an action 
director but a versatile filmmaker also interested in social, 
political, psychological and intimate subjects.</P>
