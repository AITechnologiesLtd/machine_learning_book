<PRE>                         THE WEDDING SINGER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-) :-)  for Sandler and Barrymore</PRE>
<P>Cast: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Allen Covert,
Matthew Glave, Angela Featherstone, Alexis Arquette
Director: Frank Coraci
Producers: Robert Simonds, Jack Giarraputo
Screenplay: Tim Herlihy</P>
<P>There is something wonderfully, pleasant about THE WEDDING SINGER,
rarely found in the overly sophisticated romantic comedies of today.
Surprisingly, the acting leads are also played by two stars who are not
well known for their romantic touch. Adam Sandler is probably best known
as the golf abusing, amateur in HAPPY GILMORE. By putting away his usual
hysterical antics and allowing normality to take over, he not only
surprises the audience, but probably himself by creating a character
(Robbie Hart) that the audience cares about. Drew Barrymore, also
surprises us with a glowing smile that lights up the screen. She
delivers the overly sweetened dialogue, with such heartfelt sincerity
one almost believes her when she claims to dislike alcohol.</P>
<P>Set in the mid-80's and surrounding weddings (a popular Hollywood
theme), two people fall in love in the most unusual of circumstance.
Both are getting married to the wrong person. Robbie Hart (Sandler) is
left standing alone at the altar, when his bride fails to show up for
the occasion. This leaves him intensely depressed and deluded about life
and love. How can he live down the humiliation and go on being a wedding
singer? Julia Sullivan (Barrymore) has been waiting for two years for a
proposal from a boyfriend. Now that she has been finally asked, is this
the right man for her?</P>
<P>There is nothing sophisticated about the script or plot. Basically when
Robbie and Julia meet, the audience is shown why they are right for each
other. In this instance, screen chemistry is vital and both Sandler and
Barrymore deliver. The ending is a tad cliché, but the journey to reach
there is pleasantly entertaining, with enough 80's love tunes along the
way, to make this an enjoyable nostalgic piece.</P>
