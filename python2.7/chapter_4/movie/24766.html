<P>   To my knowledge, no other picture made on the Chinese
mainland for worldwide distribution opens with quite the flair
of this one.  A pulsating drumbeat adds rhythm to a crisply
dressed young man's brisk walk to an ATM in a spanking city
whose downtown area seems filled with all the urbanity of
New York's Rockefeller Center.  He enters a building, takes
off his clothes which are to be quickly dry cleaned, inserts
some coins in an automatic laundry, and puts himself under a
shower.  More like a car wash, this is like no shower that
you'll find even in the United States.  Large brushes twirl
around hitting his body, then retreating, only to attack the
gentleman again, massaging his back while adding soap and
washing him off.  Overhead dryers discharge torrents of hot
air that make his hair stand on end.  He leaves the shower,
picks up his newly-pressed clothes, and he's off.  End of
drumbeat.  For a few minutes you might think you've
wandered into the trailer for a James Bond movie.  This is a
China that most of us in the West do not know, a place in
which at least a lucky proportion of the 1.3 billion population
are making the big ones.  In fact you might even think that
director Zhang Yang, whose work was recently featured at
New York's New Directors/New Films series, is feeding us
propaganda from the moment the protagonist gets his own
brainwashing under the steamy torrents of water.</P>
<P>   The big irony is that we are indeed receiving propaganda
but of a sort opposite that which we have been led to believe. 
If Zhang is not exactly prescribing a return to communism in
China, he is at least shedding some cinematic tears over its
demise.  We're not talking about the totalitarian communism
practiced by Chairman Mao or about the forced labor of the
commune, but the kind of communism that emphasizes the
word's root: community.  Community, to Zhang, is being lost
in China's race to prosper, in its abandoning of the basic
principles of neighborhood, a common trust, a one-big-family
spirit missing in the West.</P>
<P>   But "Shower" is anything but a dull political tract: in fact
politics as such does not even enter the picture.  This is a
sincere, appropriately sentimental and often humorous look at
an old man's family, one which has seen its eldest son
deserting the fold to go for the riches of the southern Chinese
industrial district of Shenzhen while his dad and his retarded
brother remain behind in battered Beijing surroundings.  </P>
<P>   Stories of sons reaching out to their estranged fathers
when the time for reconciliation is virtually past are not
uncommon, but Zhang gives this strain a uniquely Chinese
beat.  The story opens with panache as yuppie Da Ming (Pu
Cun Xin), having given himself a razzle-dazzle wash-up, flies
north to Beijing believing that his father, Master Liu (Zhu Xu),
has died.  Looking with disappointment, even scorn, on his
mentally challenged brother, Er Ming (Jiang Wu), he is
nonetheless relieved to see that his father is still very much
alive, and happily running a broken-down bathhouse that
accommodates mostly elderly men.  While the older man
provides the hot water in which the customers communally
bathe as though in a prehistoric version of a Japanese tub,
he massages their backs and strokes their egos, dispensing
avuncular advice about issues ranging from domestic
relations to the care and training of fighting crickets.  The
men drink tea, play chess, and watch their cricket matches,
occasionally disturbed by the resonant singing of "O Sole
Mio" by a chubby teen patron--who is able to sing only when
water pours about his body.  </P>
<P>   Da Ming sees his father for the first time...a man who
lovingly takes care of his handicapped son, racing him around
the block and competing with him in the water, and being
looked up to by the motley denizens of the bathhouse--which
provides even pedicures among its various services.  As Da
Ming and Master Liu become re-acquainted, the older man
tells his career-oriented son the almost mythical story of his
meeting decades ago with his wife, who had come from a dry
and dusty region of China which provided few baths indeed
for its citizens.  Young Da Ming becomes aware of the
spiritual poverty of his own urban life, later emerging as
frustrated as his dad and his father's patrons are upon
hearing the awful news that the neighborhood is being
gentrified. The baths and adjacent housing are to be torn
down to build a shopping center.</P>
<P>   "Shower" is a bitter-sweet tale of reconciliation that hasn't
an insincere bone in its body.  The portrayals are authentic,
the ensemble acting is appropriately muted and lively as
called for by the situations.   You cannot be blamed if you
see your own community here in the West threatened by the
sort of spirit-numbing gentrification that has taken place in the
name of progress, obviously giving this picture a universality
missing from even some of the great works of Zhang Yimou.</P>
<P>   The film won the FIPRESCI Award at the 1999 Toronto
Film Festival and has been exhibited--with other prizes as
well--at San Sebastian, Thessaloniki, Vancouver, Sundance
and Rotterdam.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 92 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
