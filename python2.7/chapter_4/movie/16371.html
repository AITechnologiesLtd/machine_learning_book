<P>The Wedding Singer (1998) 2 stars out of 4</P>
<P> Sometimes when you go into a movie with low expectations - be it because
you are unimpressed with the talent or lack thereof of one or more of the
participants - you can be surprised.</P>
<P> Such is the case with The Wedding Singer. Now, this isn't the funniest
movie since Buster Keaton's The General. Let us just say it's better than
Dumb and Dumber,  but not as good as Caddyshack.</P>
<P> What catches you off guard is the performance of Saturday Night Live
alumnus Adam Sandler. It's restrained and, at times, touching. The comedy
of Sandler, like many of the recent SNL grads, is - like limburger cheese -
an acquired taste.</P>
<P> In The Wedding Singer Sandler puts aside his usual loud, obnoxious schtick
to create a character with whom the audience can actually empathize and
root for.</P>
<P> Sandler plays Robbie Hart, the title character, a failed rock musician who
makes his living singer at wedding, Bar Mitzvahs and other social
occasions.</P>
<P> While he makes others happy, he himself is tossed into the dumpster after
his fiance jilts him on his wedding day, leaving him embittered and
forlorn.</P>
<P> To try to lift his spirits his friend, Julie (a winsome Drew Barrymore)
asks him to help her with her wedding plans because her jerk of a fiance, a
snooty Wall Street bonds investor, claims he is too busy to help.</P>
<P> Well, you can guess the rest as well as the outcome. If not, it's back to
basic film school for you.</P>
<P>  The Wedding Singer is a nice little movie, mostly thanks to the chemistry
between its two protagonists. Barrymore, with her baby moon face, looks
radiant, a good contrast to Sandler hound-dog appearance.</P>
<P> Some of the laughs fall flat, and many of the characters are types rather
than real people, but overall, The Wedding Singer  entertains. It's a nice
diversion for undemanding and unsophisticated moviegoers who want to wile
away about 100 minutes.</P>
