Beloved (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Oprah Winfrey and Danny
Glover. Directed by Jonathan Demme</PRE>
<P> The film adaptation of Toni Morrison's Beloved is a haunting, poetic epic
that's part ghost story, part love story, part family drama.</P>
<P> It's a powerful, eerie story that, quite frankly, those with a lack of or
little imagination will have difficulty following or understanding.</P>
<P> Looming over this story is the abomination of slavery and the scars, both
physical and psychological, it has left on its victims.</P>
<P> Set in rural Ohio in 1873, the movie tells of Sethe (Oprah Winfrey), her
daughter, Denver (Kimberly Elise), Sethe's lover, Paul D (Danny Glover),
and the strange, young woman (Thandie Newton) who enters their lives. She
calls herself Beloved.</P>
<P> She is an otherworldly woman-child who appears on Sethe's doorstep covered
with insects and drooling like a baby.</P>
<P> Sethe takes her into her home and into her heart for Sethe is haunted by a
dark and bloody secret - an infant daughter she killed to keep her and her
family from being returned to slavery.</P>
<P> Is Beloved the spirit of that daughter? That is the mystery that intrigues
the audience.</P>
<P> Beloved offers an opportunity for a strong ensemble of actresses to
demonstrate their talents. It is the richest interaction of women on screen
since the 1993 screen version of another best seller, Amy Tan's The Joy
Luck Club.</P>
<P> First and foremost is Winfrey's Sethe. She is a fierce, yet enigmatic
individual, determined to make a life for herself and her family as free
individuals. The scars she carries, literally and figuratively, drive her
to try to protect her family from the ghosts of her past.</P>
<P> Winfrey's superb performance should come as no surprise to those who
remember her remarkable film debut a decade ago in Steven Spielberg's film
version of Alice Walker's The Color Purple.</P>
<P> Winfrey, who purchased the rights to Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning
novel about 10 years ago, has nurtured this project for a decade. She has
poured her heart and soul into Sethe, creating a woman of indomitable
fortitude.</P>
<P> Newton has the showiest as well as the most difficult chore, bringing to
life the unearthly Beloved. At times Newton's performance comes very close
to an Exorcist-like parody, as she croaks, drools and hisses her way
through the script, flailing her arms and walking like a child who has just
mastered her first steps.</P>
<P> She is demanding and dependent, childlike innocent and darkly demonic.</P>
<P> Newton walks an acting tightrope with very few missteps. It is a brave and
daring performance.</P>
<P> The high points of Beloved are those scenes featuring veteran performer
Beah Richards as Baby Suggs, Sethe's mother-in-law. She's a freed slave
turned preacher whose sermons are meant to lift the hearts and souls of a
newly freed people. Her sermon from atop a rock in which the men begin to
dance around her while the children laugh and the women wail is magical.</P>
<P> Richards is an island of tenderness in a movie filled with some horrific
and brutal images.</P>
<P> As Denver, Elise has the thankless task of allowing herself to be
overshadowed by the more flamboyant Newton. Yet as the film progresses,
Denver gains strength, resolve and backbone. She starts as someone needing
the protection of her mother and ends up an independent woman fighting to
save her mother's soul.</P>
<P> Elise, with doe-like eyes and determined mouth, could pass as Winfrey's
daughter. This fine young actress probably delivers the most subtle and
strongest performance in the film.</P>
<P> Glover brings humor and dignity to the role of Paul D. He's a good man
whose feet, as he says, have done a lot of walking since being freed. He
finds a home and works to make a life with Sethe, trying to help her
conquer the specters of her past.</P>
<P> The bond that binds these two are Sweet Home, the ironic name of the
Kentucky plantation on which they were both slaves. The flashback scenes
showing the brutalization of the slaves are horrifying, yet somehow
disconcerting. Their tone seems more Mandingo and less Morrison.
Thankfully, Beloved only contains a few lurid flashbacks, not enough to
throw the film out of kilter.</P>
<P> Director Jonathan Demme (Silence of the Lambs, Philadelphia) tells much of
his story in close-up, making Beloved an intimate experience between
character and audience, bringing the viewer into the lives of Sethe and her
family.</P>
<P> Screenwriters Akosua Busia, Richard LeGravenese and Adam Brooks did a
masterful job of translating Morrison's sometime elliptical novel into
cinematic terms.</P>
<P> Rachel Portman's uplifting score adds to the tenor of the film as does Tak
Fujimoto's brilliant cinematography.</P>
<P> Beloved, at nearly three hours in length, is an outstanding film,
featuring Oscar-caliber performances from its leading players. It is a
literate endeavor, but one literal-minded people may not totally
appreciate. It is a film in which you must allow your imagination free
rein.</P>
