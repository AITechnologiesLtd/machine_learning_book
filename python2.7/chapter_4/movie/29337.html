<PRE>THE WICKER MAN
A film review by Christopher Null
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's difficult to shake the disquieting climax of The Wicker Man, where
pious Police Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) of the West Highland Police is
confronted by the secrets kept within the isolated Scottish island of
Summerisle.  Being a decent Christian, he finds himself repulsed by
their pagan rituals, open sexuality, and their unwavering devotion to
the Old Gods.  Much like the unwitting protagonists of Peter Weir's The
Last Wave and Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Howie is facing off against
powers much larger than himself (and anything that is dreamt of in his
narrow theology).</P>
<P>Called upon to investigate the disappearance of a young schoolgirl named
Rowan Morrison, Sgt. Howie finds stubborn, tight-lipped resistance from
the local islanders, who carry about their business unmindful of his
single-minded detective work.  More often than not, they treat him with
bemused detachment, laughing into their drinks or simply ignoring him
altogether as he marches through the rustic schoolyards, dingy inns, and
lush green hills.  The locations, filmed in the highlands of Scotland,
possess the eerie, musty, ever-haunted quality of an Old Country worn
down by time.  If there is a central character in The Wicker Man, it's
the timeless elements of rock and water, moss and faded wood that
comprise the town squares.  Sgt. Howie, a man from the city, is clearly
out of his depth.</P>
<P>As his search progresses, he begins to piece together an elaborate
mystery (that may be less complicated than he believes) where Rowan was
brutally sacrificed by a fanatical cult led by the calm, elegant,
progressive-thinking Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee).  "I think I
could turn and live with animals," muses the vaguely sinister local
politician.  "They are so placid and self-contained.  They do not lie
awake in the dark and weep for their sins.  They do not make me sick
discussing their duty to God."</P>
<P>The Wicker Man sustains a mood of unspoken dread through Sgt. Howie's
interactions with the tight-lipped, poker faced islanders, as well as
the implied clues he reads between the lines as they evade his line of
questions.  There's also a charged eroticism that perhaps comes hand in
hand with his deeply religious suppression of carnal desire.  One of the
more memorable sequences involves Sgt. Howie's inability to sleep as a
lovely young barmaid, Willow (Britt Ekland), dances nude outside his
door.  Prim, straight-laced, and disciplined to a fault, Sgt. Howie
proves unable to deal with the pressures of a free lovin' modern age. 
(It is worth pointing out that this is a horror film that often takes
place during the light of day, where evil can lurk under a clear blue
sky.  There are no easy hiding places here.)</P>
<P>It's amusing to note that Christopher Lee cites The Wicker Man as the
finest movie he ever made, especially considering he only shows up for
two (memorable) scenes as Lord Summerisle.  He's clearly the heavy, but
handles the role with a particularly light touch, tossing off his
sarcastic commentary with unflappable charm.  Where else will you get
the chance to see this wonderfully charismatic actor sway back and forth
in a mad Celtic dance, his face ecstatic and mouth agape?  The
ever-charismatic Mr. Lee throws himself into the role with vigor,
playing beautifully off of Edward Woodward's lean, humorless Sgt. Howie.</P>
<P>Anthony Shaffer's fatalistic screenplay slowly, resolutely builds to the
cathartic moment where he is brought face to face with, what else, The
Wicker Man of the title.  His shriek into the bright shining day
("Christ! Christ! Oh, oh, Christ!") stands out as one of those indelible
screen moments that linger, much like Donald Sutherland's final howl in
the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Hey, it was the 70s,
man.  A bleak time for screen protagonists struggling to endure in a
conspiratorial global environment.</P>
