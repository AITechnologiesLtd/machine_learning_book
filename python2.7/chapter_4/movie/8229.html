<PRE>Hot "Air"
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>        There's a detail near the end of "Con Air" that epitomizes
everything that's right and wrong with the movie.  The bad guys have crash
landed their plane on the Las Vegas Strip, and some of them commandeer a
fire truck to make good their escape.  U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin (John
Cusack) chases after them on a police motorcycle.  He shoots at them with
his gun until he runs out of bullets, upon which he, like many other
action heroes, throws his gun away.  He then catches up to the truck,
leaps aboard, grabs a hatchet, chops a hole in the roof of the cab and
tells the driver, a convict named Swamp Thing (M.C. Gainey) to pull over.
Swamp Thing just laughs at him.</P>
<P>        Now, if Larkin had been thinking like a regular person, he would
have held on to his empty gun and pointed it at Swamp Thing to get him to
pull over.  But this being an action movie, that wouldn't have been any
fun.  So, without his gun, Larkin has to grab a fire hose, poke it through
the hole in the roof and blast Swamp Thing into oblivion with it.  You
have to admit it's a nice visual.</P>
<P>        "Con Air" begins when Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), who killed a man
trying to rape his wife, receives his parole from prison.  He hitches a
ride aboard a plane loaded with insanely violent criminals.  Of course,
the criminals take over the plane, and Poe does his best to thwart their
plans.  Meanwhile, on the ground, Larkin figures out that Poe's a good guy
and tries to convince his colleagues of that before they blow the plane
out of the sky.</P>
<P>        It's easy to point out "Con Air's" many flaws.  Director Simon
West stuffs action into every frame until the movie wears on you.  Scott
Rosenberg's script tries way too hard to be hip and funny ("If you say
anything, the next wings you see will be on the flies buzzing around your
rotting corpse," a villain says rather tortuously).  The movie spends too
much time building up its bad guys, and there's so many of them that they
create a nightmare of loose ends.  The hero's got a family to come home
to, but he stays on the plane to keep the male guards from being killed,
the female guard from being raped, and a diabetic convict friend of his
from dying.  All this raises the film's B.S. quotient sky high.</P>
<P>        Still, I enjoyed this picture more than I expected to, and it has 
a lot to do with the cast.  Cage once again manages to play a virtuous
paragon without cloying.  Better still is John Malkovich as Cyrus "The 
Virus" Grissom, who becomes the prisoners' ringleader.  This movie shakes
Malkovich out of his recent torpor (see "Mary Reilly" or "The Portrait of
a Lady") and lets him unleash his ferocious side.</P>
<P>        On the downside, the brilliant Cusack in a cliched role becomes a
self-righteous bore (a quality he displayed, and sent up, in "Bullets
Over Broadway").  Steve Buscemi is all wrong as a psycho killer - his
criminal characters (in "Reservoir Dogs" and "Fargo," among others) are so
memorable because they try so hard to make sense out of everything.  This
actor shouldn't be unhinged.</P>
<P>        Anyway, it isn't likely that you'll go into "Con Air" with too
many illusions.  It's an action flick that fulfills one's modest
expectations.</P>
