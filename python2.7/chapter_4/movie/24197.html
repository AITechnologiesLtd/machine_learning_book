<P>   The only touch missing from this sweet, poignant,
wonderfully acted and directed romance is the voice of Judy
Garland on the soundtrack singing Ralph Blane/Hugh Martin's
song, "The Boy Next Door."  Truth to tell, neither of the two
entirely sympathetic, nay, charismatic characters can ignore
each other, living literally a hop, skip and jump (which they
sometimes do) from each other's bedroom window.  In a
stunning directorial debut, Gina Prince-Bythewood directs this
Spike-Lee produced Cinderella story with a fairy-tale ending
that pretty much sums up the connection between two
notions heretofore strange to each other, love and basketball.</P>
<P>   The ball is in the court of the two players who often make
each other jump through hoops rather than admit their mutual
affection.  The enchanting Sanaa Lathan performs in the
starring role of Monica Wright, a woman whose notions of
feminism may be half-baked particularly when criticizing her
mother's attention to cooking, but who without reading Gloria
Steinem or Helen Gurley Brown feels deep down the
importance of being an independent woman.  Monica would
be considered a tomboy back in the fifties, and in fact some
viewers may call her that even today though progressive
parts of the world recognize highly physical sports as no male
monopoly. Monica has her mind set on dribbling, jumping,
running.  Scoring for her means something different from
what it means to a macho man.  Her next-door neighbor in
the affluent black Los Angeles neighborhood of Baldwin Hills
is Quincy McCall (Omar Epps), likewise a person who exists
for love of the game, and one who only on some
subconscious level realizes that he and Monica love each
other even at the tender age of eleven.</P>
<P>   Prince-Bythewood divides the movie fittingly enough into
quarters, each segment devoted to an aspect of the lives of
these two ball players over a period of some twenty years.  In
the pre-teen phase young Mnica (Kyla Pratt) asks young
Quincy (Glenndon Chatman) whether she can join the game.
Not long after that Quincy asks the young gamin, "You wanna
me my girl?" to which she replies in all naivete, "What do I
have to do?"  Quincy thinks only that this obligates her to ride
the handlebars of his bike--which Monica, in a fit of autonomy
that will see her through the next two decades--simply
refuses to do.  As they mature, both will learn that the
unformed idea of independence leads only to loneliness and
that each, in turn, must indeed do something for the other if
they are to become a team with a fighting chance to win life's
game.</P>
<P>   While the 27-year-old Omar Epps is long in the tooth to be
playing a high school kid--who seems not to age through the
years--he is ideally cast as the sometimes petulant athlete
who will turn pro and have to fight off the groupies.  Sanaa
Lathan effectively exchanges emotions, her eyes displaying
her loneliness when she is recruited by a pro women's team
that plays in Barcelona, jealousy and profound sadness when
she learns of Quincy's engagement to be married, ecstasy
when involved in a hot game or when she appears close to
getting what her heart desires.</P>
<P>  In the side roles, Alfre Woodard is an excellent Camille
Wright, the mother of Monica, who has had to give up her
dreams when she became pregnant but who finds happiness
in keeping up her lavish home and counseling her often
difficult daughter.  A compelling subplot that mirrors the
dominant one involves Quincy's dad, Zeke (Dennis Haysbert),
who has been caught with his pants down by his unhappy
wife Mona (Debbie Morgan) and who, in the fashion of Arthur
Miller's Willie Loman loses some of the awe with which his
son had always regarded him.  One grade-A lesson that
Monica learns occurs in college, where she considers herself
perpetually picked on by a coach who never lets up on
criticizing the young woman's plays.  "When I ignore you,
then you worry," says the fierce coach, an object lesson on
the adage that the opposite of love and concern is not anger
but indifference.</P>
<P>   "Love and Basketball" has a fairy-tell ending as Quincy,
about to marry another, goes one-on-one with Monica for
stakes that are far higher than a league championship.  This
is an effectively done moment of fantasy that brings a
sincere, realistic, mature and thoroughly human romantic
drama to a close.  What positions "Love and Basketball"
several points over the recent black endeavor, "The Best
Man" is its absence of phoniness, of kitschy scenes designed
to evoke cheap laughs.  While the brief scenes on the court
are well-executed, "Love and Basketball" is a movie that uses
the game as a metaphor for life, a contest between two
opposing wills whose main object is not victory but
sportsmanship, good will, mutual affection and grounded
behavior.</P>
