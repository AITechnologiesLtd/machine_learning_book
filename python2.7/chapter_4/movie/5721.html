<PRE>                             JOE'S APARTMENT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1996) *</PRE>
<P>        See if this makes sense to you. MTV, the network that has 
given the current generation of teenagers a short attention span and 
craving for sex and violence, makes a non-violent, non-sexual movie 
out of something that was originally two minutes long. It is -- to 
quote the Green Day video they've been playing all summer -- a 
walking contradiction.</P>
<P>        JOE'S APARTMENT, a low-budget, low-plot, low-
intelligence and even lower comedy level movie, is based on a 
very short film that has been airing on MTV since about 1993. In 
that film, a young man brought his pretty young date up to his place 
and was about to score when a couple hundred talking cockroaches 
fell out of the chandelier and down the woman's dress. It was a 
decent one joke, two minute piece of entertainment.</P>
<P>        Now comes the ninety minute version, where we get 
Joe's life story. He's just out of college and trying to find a cheap 
apartment in New York City. Some old woman dies right in front 
of him and he decides to move into her apartment, but the punk 
landlords want him out, beginning a few rounds of lowbrow 
harrassment. Also wanting him out of the apartment is a transvestite 
senator who has bought out the leases of every surrounding 
building, Joe being the only thing keeping him from building a 
giant prison on the property.</P>
<P>        So Joe moves in and finds out he has a few thousand 
roommates, a bunch of talking cockroaches who also sing and 
dance on occasion. He reacts in surprise, digust, etc. but they 
like him so much he eventually accepts life with 40,000 talking 
insects. And he meets a woman named Lily who wants to make 
the delapidated neighborhood into one big garden for the kids 
to play in before getting shot. Joe, of course, falls in love instantly 
and -- wouldn't you know it? -- she turns out to be the senator's 
daughter.</P>
<P>        The plot is right out of a hundred other comedies with 
slightly unique premises driven into the ground. The idea of an 
apartment inhabited by talking cockroaches has potential but never 
goes anywhere because the writing is lame and the plot so stale and 
transparent, not to mention the fact that the Joe character is just 
plain annoying. JOE'S APARTMENT alternates between petty 
conflicts with the hoodlum landlords and scenes of Joe trying to 
find a job or impress Lily. None of it is any good and the only 
times the movie elevates itself past awful and up to the level of 
pretty bad are when the cockroaches do their three song-and-
dance numbers.</P>
<P>        MTV should have realized what they were getting into 
when they decided to inflate something to almost fifty times its 
original length and anyone who went to see this should have known 
better. JOE'S APARTMENT is ridiculously bad, unfunny beyond 
belief. It gets the one-star rating on the strength of two short 
sequences -- the song-and-dance number where the cockroaches 
swim in the toilet and the final sequence, where everything turns 
out happy and the cockroaches turn the apartment into a charismatic 
church, complete with pipe organs and a crippled cockroach who is 
healed by faith. Unfortunately, this crippled little movie is never 
healed by faith or anything else.</P>
