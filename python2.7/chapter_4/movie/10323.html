<P>   Every schoolkid used to know how the U.S. got involved in
the Spanish-American War.  William Randolph Hearst,
publisher of a right-wing syndicate of newspapers, publicized
alleged atrocities which the Spanish were committing against
the Cubans and, in bold headlines announcing that Spain had
sun the battleship Maine, Hearst developed public support for
military action.  In "Tomorrow Never Dies" (the title coming
from a song on the soundtrack of the 18th entry of the James
Bond series), a billionaire media mogul takes this idea several
steps further.  As played with sardonic villainy by Jonathan
Pryce, Elliot Carver, seeking to scoop the rest of the world's
media, personally creates crises--having written the stories
beforehand for immediate circulation.  By this method, he
expects his newspaper, "Tomorrow," to have an audience of
one billion people and to gain exclusive rights to publish in
China for the next hundred years.</P>
<P>   In what could be taken as a sendup of the control which the
media have over political developments, "Tomorrow Never
Dies" displays a handsome, urbane Pierce Brosnan in the
role of James Bond, now appearing quite comfortable in the
part and perhaps ready to assume the identity of 007 for the
next hundred as did Sean Connery in the previous period. 
His demeanor matches that of Roger Moore mroe than that of
the Scotsman, and this would be desirable except for one
thing: violence has replaced sex in the foreground, at least
since Tim Dalton tried the role on for size, and therefore his
particular refinement is somewhat wasted.  Perhaps not
knowing what to do to make Bond politically correct in concert
with the times, scripter Bruce Feirstein has largely written sex
and double-entendres out of the film replacing them with the
more acceptable firepower.  The movie, directed
by Roger Spottiswoode, is solidly packed with action, has a
fine array of special devices which the super-spy is instructed
to use by agent Q, and fits the by-the-numbers technique
which worked so well when Cubby Broccoli produced the bulk
of the series. As Bond says at one point to his nemesis, Elliot
Carver, "You forgot one rule: give the people what they want." 
Bet that the Bond fans still want the comfort of the formula
which has worked so well in the past since "From Russia With
Love" stirred and shook a wide audience.</P>
<P>   Filmed largely in Thailand which at one point takes the
place of Saigon and also in Hamburg, which is used as the
center of Carver's media empire, "Tomorrow Never Dies" has
the usual plot devices used successfully for thirty-five years. 
These include these details: The villain is not aligned with
either of the major powers but is an independent third force. 
The principal miscreant dies before his supporting knave, the
latter often a figure of great physical strength.  The women
are pliant (though not nearly as much so in today's political
climate).  Some stunning photography is exhibited in exotic
world locales.  Sexual double entendres barb the dialogue. 
The bad guy goes down to defeat even after capturing Bond
and his associates because he talks when he should be
shooting.  30,000 rounds of ammo are directed at the
champion by dozens of perps without a single hit, while
Bond's shots are invariably lethal.  A pre-credit sequence
shows Bond successfully escaping after carrying out a
dangerous mission.</P>
<P>   After fleeing from a British missile attack on a terrorist
bazaar by commandeering a Russian plane, Bond is thrust
into his new mission immediately, this time against a sinister
billionaire who proves once again that money is no substitute
for power.  Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) has set up satellites
throughout the world to beam his headlines to a huge
audience, but he is not licensed to practice his skills in China. 
Using high-tech gadgetry to plunge Britain and China into war,
he throws a British vessel into China's territorial waters,
whereupon Chinese pilots warn the Brits to leave the scene
immediately.  Insisting that they are in international waters,
the English admiral prepares to fight and, when Carver's
stealth ship torpedoes the British, the latter believe the
weaponry is coming from China.  The crisis which this activity
precipitates is reported immediately and exclusively the
Carver's paper, "Tomorrow."  When Bond infiltrates Carver's
network by attending his party in Hamburg disguised as a
banker, Carver sees through the scheme and sends his chief
goon, the super-Aryan Stamper (Gotz Otto), to erase him with
extreme prejudice.  Teaming up with the Chinese agent Wai
Lin (Michelle Yeoh) who, despite her mere 100 pounds is a
powerhouse of kicks, 007 chases and is chased by the
rogues, escaping at one point on a motorcycle ride through
the streets of Saigon and at another point using his heavily
equipped BMW which he drives from the back seat using a
remote control device.  Bond's mission ultimately is to destroy
the stealth battleship inhabited by Carver and his gang, thus
shutting down the mogul's missiles and aborting World War
III.</P>
<P>   The sexual dialogue, however limited this time around, is
effective enough as when 007 reports to his headquarters 
boss, M (Judi Dench) that he is "brushing up on a little
Danish." Moneypenny, who has advised Bond to "pump"
Carver's wife for information, replies that she always
considered Bond "a cunning linguist."  When Carver's wife
reports that she barely knows Bond, her disbelieving husband
repeats, "Barely."</P>
<P>   There is enough mayhem in "Tomorrow Never Dies" to
guarantee that the Bond series, like Broadway's "Cats," will
also never succumb, particularly when support can be
counted on by the wide array of products which are placed--in
this case Smirnoff's Vodka, the BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Avis,
and other luxury commodities representing part of what
Chinese agent Wai Lin refers to as Western decadence. 
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 115 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey
