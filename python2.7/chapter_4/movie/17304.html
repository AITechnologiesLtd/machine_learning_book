<PRE>Movie Review: Shakespeare in Love (1998)
A Review by: Ryan Davis
Rated: `R'</PRE>
<P>        There are hardly any historical-romantic comedies produced, so
`Shakespeare in Love' is quite a rarity, a gem you could
say. It's funny, romantic, highly entertaining and even brilliant
at times. At first I thought all the hype was too much to live up to,
but it manages to live up to all my expectations.</P>
<P>        The film begins with Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), a bad
businessman who owns a theatre, agreeing to let some people he owes
money to in on his new play, which is supposed to be a comedy from
Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes), entitled `Romeo and Ethel, the
Pirate's Daughter.' Unfortunately, Will doesn't have any
inspiration to write; he thinks he has lost his gift.</P>
<P>        That is until he meets Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), at an audition
for the play. She is dressed up as a man, and is the only one who
auditioned to use one of Shakespeare's sonnets for the
audition. Soon he finds out she is really a woman and they fall madly
in love. Sadly their love can never be, because she is promised to
Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) and they are marrying in a few weeks.</P>
<P>        Will and Viola's relationship inspires him to change the
entire play to seemingly reflect their lives and it gradually becomes
`Romeo And Juliet' As things happen in his life, he adds
something to the story that is similar to their lives. As the movie
progresses, the parallelism continues to grow; it's remarkably
written.</P>
<P>        It's not just the parallelism of the script that's
great, the dialog is superb and the characters are extremely well
developed.  It's also beautifully filmed; the costumes and sets are
gorgeous. The acting couldn't be any better.  Joseph and Gwyneth
are phenomenal in their roles, and even Ben Afflect is terrific in his
cameo appearance.</P>
<P>        `Shakespeare in Love' is a perfect romantic film; it
never tries too be too sappy or manipulate the audience. Also
nominated for thirteen Academy Awards, this wonderful film should be
on the top of your must see list.</P>
