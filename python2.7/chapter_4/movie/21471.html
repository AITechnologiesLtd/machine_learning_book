<P>   At base, the question that documentarian Doug Block asks
in filming "Home Pages" is this: When we sit alone at our
computers tap-tap-tapping out our responses in chat rooms,
scanning web sites, and contributing autobiographical details
on our own pages, are we demonstrating our sociability?  Are
we reaching out to people the world over, or are we
immersed in ourselves, hiding from actual contact with other
human beings?  The common-sense answer is, of course,
both, depending on the individual who is doing the
tap-tap-tapping.  Since Americans change venues
frequently--the typical resident of the U.S. exchanging one
home for another every five years--perhaps we have lost the
sense of community that we had before the Third Industrial
Revolution cast us adrift.  In that case, the people we relate
to on the Internet are the denizens of our real
neighborhoods--which is all to the good.  Nonetheless
the image that many people have of cyberpunks is of albino-
like creatures who are living in a kind of Platonic cave,
shielded against the burning rays of the sun, devoid of
genuine contact with our fellows and hence appropriately
labeled misfits.</P>
<P>   The computer-addicted people caught by the 43-year-old
Doug Block's cameras in his 1999 Sundance Film Festival
"Home Page" are, in my humble estimation, oddballs and
outcasts almost without exception.  Block could have treated
them as a director like Fellini might, with smiling
condescension, but opts instead to take them as seriously as
they take themselves, like a modern Frederick Wiseman,
thereby eliciting, perhaps, a greater authenticity from his cast
of characters.  </P>
<P>   While the millions of us who are already addicted to the
Internet and those of us who are curiously considering the
habit might be drawn to the movie, many will find Block's
treatment of the early stages of web traffic quite
disappointing.  The film has two major weaknesses.  One is
that with two or three exceptions, the performers are not
likeable people, not folks around whom the more rational
among us would want to spend ten minutes.  The second is
that while this, like all other documentaries, is edited (in fact
"Variety" reviewer Dennis Harvey reporting from Sundance,
holds that "editor Deborah Rosenberg does an outstanding
job weaving numerous threads into an affecting narrative
shape"), I find no such evidence exists.  "Home Page" looks
like a story that shifts from person to person like a kid
scanning TV channels, then slapped together with no more
than a modicum of revision to give it cohesion.</P>
<P>   The motivation for the film comes when its creator, Doug
Block, appears to undergo a mid-life crisis and decides to
follow Swarthmore College student Justin Block around the
country. Justin, like a cyberspace Billy Graham, is meeting
with people of all ages an backgrounds to extol the benefits
of personal pages on the Internet.  Hall, who took a brief
leave of absence from his college to make his odyssey,
sports a unique, knotted hairstyle (which he inexplicably
shaves off when he reaches the age of 21, to make himself
even more unattractive).  Having built one of the Web's first
links three or four years ago, he writes intimate details of his
life into his journal to form a kind of erotic autobiography--
allegedly accessed by 7,000 regular patrons.  One can only
reflect that his dates must have been as exhibitionistic as Hall
to allow intimate details of their relationships with this pioneer
to be on view in much the style of the women in Myles
Berkowitz's documentary feature "Twenty Dates."  One of his
pages features the author in the nude, prompting a plethora
of notes on the walls of a women's bathroom at Swarthmore
which ask the users their opinions of the man who craves so
much attention.</P>
<P>   When he is not focussing on Hall, filmmaker Block
introduces us to his wife, a law professor, and to his mother,
both of whom resist the web.  His gray-haired, lively mom is
one of the few down-to-earth people in the film, insisting that
she'd rather talk with people on the phone to get immediate
responses, insisting that she wants nothing to do with e-mail. 
(One of the final shots in the movie belies her statement:
both she and her husband are seen tapping away late at
night.)  </P>
<P>   Perhaps this movie targets a college audience, but more
likely even the 20-somethings would be turned off by Justin,
who rambles through the movie usually half-nude, an
abysmally inarticulate person whose speech is permeated
with "you-know"'s, "like," "I mean," "what-not," and other such
fillers that have become a trademark of the Monica Lewinsky
generation.  Undoubtedly he is a better writer than he is a
speaker, but Block spends surprisingly little time on the
dynamics of the Internet, casting only an occasional look at
what transpires on the screen.  One can only wonder how a
frightful fellow like Justin ever passed the interview that got
him into Swarthmore, one of the nation's top colleges, but if
he represents the typical student at that and other elite
institutions, standards have indeed plummeted since I went to
college back in the Jurassic Age.</P>
<P>   The film becomes increasingly annoying as we are
familiarized with one pretentious maverick after another,
virtually none able to put together a sentence without a surfeit
of empty verbiage and a clutter of hollow, unnecessary fillers.
Editor Deborah Rosenberg must have the cleanest work room
on the block, as apparently not a frame of this movie ended
up on the cutting-room floor. </P>
