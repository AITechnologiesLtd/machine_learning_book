 You Can Count on Me (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Laura Linney,
Mark Ruffalo, Rory Culkin, Matthew Broderick and Jon Tenney. Written and
directed by Ken Lonergan. Rated R.</P>
<PRE> Life is a messy proposition.</PRE>
<P> Absolutes, it seems, only exist in the movies ó and thatís because
audiences require a closure of some sort.</P>
<P> That is what makes You Can Count on Me so unusual. It is a movie that
deals with life issues and in a manner that mirrors reality ó sloppy,
flawed and inconclusive.</P>
<P> Sammy (Laura Linney) has been on her own since her parents were killed
in a traffic accident.</P>
<P> As the film opens, Sammy is the lending officer at a small-town bank
branch. She is a single mom with an 8-year-old son, Rudy (Rory Culkin).</P>
<P> Her younger brother, Terry (Mark Ruffalo), is a drifter and a screw-up.
In need of money, he abandons his girlfriend and drops in on his big
sister.</P>
<P> And the family dynamics begin. Sammy mothers Terry, brow beating him
for not keeping in touch. He finally admits that he served a few months
in a Florida jail because of his involvement in a barroom fight.</P>
<P> Sammy, meanwhile, has a lot on her plate. She is dating Bob (Jon
Tenney) whom she may ó or may not ó love, and she is coping with a fussy
new bank manager, Brian (Matthew Broderick), who at their first meeting,
refuses to allow her to leave ó as is her custom ó from 3:15 to 3:30 so
she can pick up her son at the bus stop and drop him off at the baby
sitter.</P>
<P> Terry, meanwhile, decides to extend his visit after he discovers his
girlfriend tried to commit suicide. Terry takes this opportunity to get
closer to his nephew.</P>
<P> Written and directed by Ken Lonergan, You Can Count on Me rivets your
attention not only because of the top-rate performances by all involved
ó especially Linney and Ruffalo ó but because we each can recognize some
of ourselves in the interaction between the two: The long-held
resentments, the fear of disapproval the self-doubts about a course of
action.</P>
<P> On a whim, it seems, Sammy begins an affair with the married Brian.
Linney superbly displays Sammy's mixed emotions as she goes through a
grab-bag of feelings ó from exhilaration to guilt ó after one tryst with
her boss.</P>
<P> Ruffaloís Terry is really a good-hearted soul who just cannot do the
right thing. He means no harm. Rather, he's merely a bit naive and even
a bit idealistic.</P>
<P> When Rudy asks Terry about his father, the latter ó without consulting
Sammy ó drives Rudy to the trailer where his father lives. There, the
boy is rejected and denied, an action that so infuriates Terry that he
gets into another fight and again winds up in trouble ó not only with
the law ó but with Sammy.</P>
<P> Ruffalo plays Terry as a wounded animal, but one that has been mentally
abused. It is a performance that garners sympathy and ultimately
respect.</P>
<P> Broderick is clever in his supporting role as the anal boss who cannot
understand why people continually question his authority or his
decisions. Broderick, a childhood friend of Lonerganís, takes what could
have been a one-dimensional  buffoon and transforms him into a comical
individual whom you can laugh at and recognize from your own workplace.</P>
<P> You Can Count on Me ends as it begins, with life going on and nothing
really getting resolved. Terry leaves to see how his former girlfriend
in faring, while Sammy merely drives back to the bank for another day of
work.</P>
<P> Even this description is inadequate to explain the emotional resonance
that rings through You Can Count on Me. Itís a movie that doesn't tackle
any big issues or even make any profound statements. It is merely a look
at some regular people making the best of their situations from day to
day.</P>
<P> And, just like us, for them some days are better than others. And if
you want a better day, I strongly recommend you take the time to see You
Can Count on Me.</P>
