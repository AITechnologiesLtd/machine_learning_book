<PRE>The Dreamlife Of Angels ***1/2</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
in French with English subtitles
starring Elodie Bouchez, Natacha Regnier, Gregoire Colin, Jo Prestia,
Patrick Mercado
written by Erick Zonca and Roger Bohbot
directed by Erick Zonca</PRE>
<P>First films are usually clumsy, experimental, and uneven. But
43-year-old Erick Zonca has turned the tables with his first film, THE
DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS. Like many French films, THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS
is slow-paced, but the surplus of emotion makes up for the lack of
plot. The film features two outstanding performances from Elodie
Bouchez and Natacha Regnier, who shared the Best Actress award at last
year's Cannes Film Festival, while Peter Mullan took home Best Actor
for MY NAME IS JOE, a similar emotional experience.</P>
<P>The first character we meet in THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is Isa(Elodie
Bouchez), an impoverished drifter with a past we never learn much
about. She wanders into a French city, selling homemade postcards
which she says are for the poor. A man whom she meets in a cafe lets
her have a sewing job in his factory. In the factory, she meets
Marie(Natacha Regnier), a shy woman given to fits of rage. Marie
agrees to let Isa stay at her flat, which she is taking care of for a
woman who was in a car crash with her young daughter. Isa and Marie
become friends, and during a night on the town, they meet
Charly(Patrick Mercado) and Fredo(Jo Prestia), a couple of bouncers
from a nearby nightclub. Charly and Marie are involved until she meets
Chris(Gregoire Colin), a rich playboy who owns the club. It is obvious
that Marie is with the wrong man, and it seems to be tearing her
apart, and slowly she is suffering a nervous breakdown.  Meanwhile,
Isa has begun to read the personal diary of the girl who was in the
car crash, and she begins to visit the child in the hospital, day
after day.</P>
<P>THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS doesn't offer much in the way of a plot, and
it takes quite a while to get going, but soon it's not hard to see
that the film is a study of two characters, and since they are
portrayed so realistically, it's hard not to feel emotionally drained
after watching the film. The filmmaking is sometimes raw, and
sometimes graceful, depending on the mood of the scene. Erick Zonca is
amazingly gifted, because it takes many filmmakers a few films to
create such a sense of powerful immediacy. THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS is
a superb, riveting film, and is sure to be among the best first films
of the year.</P>
