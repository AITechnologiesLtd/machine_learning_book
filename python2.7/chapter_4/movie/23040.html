<PRE>                               THE BEACH
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Danny Boyle says he was "keen to distance this movie from LORD OF
THE FLIES, which THE BEACH has been unfairly compared to."  Okay, so THE
BEACH is not LORD OF THE FLIES.  LORD OF THE FLIES has a lot more going
for it.</P>
<P>     Many a confused moviegoer has already asked me what the heck this
film is about, since the trailer makes it out to be something akin to,
er, LORD OF THE FLIES.  The movie, based on the novel by Alex Garland,
traces the Thailand trip of young Richard (DiCaprio), who in Bangkok
encounters a crazy guy named Daffy (Carlyle, who has nary an
understandable line of dialogue in the whole movie).</P>
<P>     Daffy ends up offing himself, but not before teasing Richard with a
map to a remote Thai island, where the perfect beach can be found.  So,
with two French acquaintances (Francoise and Etienne - Ledoyen and
Canet, respectively) from his Bangkok hotel, they manage to trek to the
remote paradise.</P>
<P>     Turns out the beach really is there.  A band of expatriates from
around the world (led by Swinton) live there, in fact, and they have an
uneasy peace with the local pot farmers across the island, who carry
some big guns and a lot of chest-beating anger and paranoia.  The
arrival of the trio turns out to be good and bad -- but mostly bad.</P>
<P>     Writer-director-producer team Hodge-Boyle-Macdonald have put
together two of the best films of the last decade (SHALLOW GRAVE and
TRAINSPOTTING), and the limbo bar for THE BEACH is set incredibly high.
Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to their legacy, for a number of
reasons.</P>
<P>     TITANIC fans expecting their dashing Leo are going to be sorely
disappointed.  In THE BEACH, DiCaprio practically plays a parody of
himself, haughty and aloof, but underneath a coward and a habitual
liar.  The rest of the cast can safely be shrugged off, with
much-vaunted newcomer Virginie Ledoyen leaving virtually no memorable
impression.</P>
<P>     More than ever before, Boyle relies on camera trickery to tell the
story.  The problem is that, unlike in TRAINSPOTTING, where camera
tricks were used to get in the head of a heroin fiend, THE BEACH uses
them to mask defects in the script, which rambles on for 90 minutes
without much direction, before diverging into THE DEER HUNTER territory,
with Leo going inexplicably primal.  Even Boyle's kitschy
life-as-video-game trick has been done before, in Spike Lee's CLOCKERS.</P>
<P>     By film's end, the troubled shrugs of our audience would seem to
agree with me that no one really knows what to make of THE BEACH.  It
will likely appeal to moviegoers more interested in scenery than
substance -- just don't expect BEACH BLANKET BINGO.  This is APOCALYPSE
NOW: The Prequel.</P>
