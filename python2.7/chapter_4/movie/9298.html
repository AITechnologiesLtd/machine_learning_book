<P>     THE EDGE is an okay thriller about a billionaire bookworm (Anthony
Hopkins) and a swinging-dick fashion photographer (Alec Baldwin) who,
along with one of the hired help, get stranded sans provisions in the
Alaskan wild, miles from their middle-of-nowhere lodging, where the rich
man's model wife (Elle Macpherson, contributing to the local supply of
timber) and the rest of their party is waiting.  The catch?  Well, there
are a couple.  First, the younger dude may or may not have dangerous
designs on Mrs. Money Bags.  Second, that seemingly unassuming old guy
is actually a fount of knowledge-- theoretical, at least-- on the sub-
ject of outdoor survival.  Third, it's bear season.  And, when one of
those 1800-pound monsters gets a taste for human flesh, well, guess who
gets eaten first.</P>
<P>     As directed by Lee Tamahori (MULHOLLAND FALLS, ONCE WERE WARRIORS),
from a script by David Mamet of all people, THE EDGE doesn't have much
of one.  The various elements, while admittedly intriguing, never gel
into a compelling, cohesive whole.  Hopkins delivers a thoughtful per-
formance, while his costar slogs through a much murkier characteriza-
tion.  What do these men *really* mean to each other?  Who knows, but
they *do* get to engage in one whammo of a bear fight.  However unaf-
fecting the first and final reels are-- did they have to reveal *all* of
the survivalist secrets in those first few scenes?-- the big battle is
probably worth the matinee price of admission.  I mean, when will you
ever again get to see Hopkins, a live bear, and a handmade spear sharing
the same frame?  Breathtaking scenery, too.  </P>
