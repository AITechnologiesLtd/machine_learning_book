<PRE>                           WAKING NED DEVINE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An entire village conspires to fool
          the lottery and convince them that a dead lottery
          winner is still alive.  In the tradition of LOCAL
          HERO, this is a likable comedy from Ireland with a
          great set of Irish character actors and some
          beautiful views of Irish countryside.  David Kelly
          is just great.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In the little coastal village of Tullymore, Ireland there is a
local preoccupation with the National lottery and nobody is more
involved is the old rascal Jackie O'Shea (played by veteran actor Ian
Bannen).  Then one day the newspaper says there is one lottery winner
and he is from the local county.  Tullymore is the only village in the
county so someone local must have won.  Jackie waits for the scream of
excitement, but it does not come.  Somebody has won the lottery but is
not telling or perhaps does not even know it yet. Jackie forms a team
with his wife Annie (Fionnula Flanagan) and old pal Michael O'Sullivan
(David Kelly) to search the village for the winner.  But nobody seems
to have won the lottery.  Then Jackie realizes just one man is left who
could be the winner, Ned Devine.</P>
<P>     In his bed they find the old man, Ned Devine.  Ned had the good
luck to win the lottery and the bad luck to die of the excitement.  But
now there is no Ned Devine to collect the winnings.  But with no Ned
Devine there will be no winnings.  This has Jackie in a dither.  Well,
why not have Michael be Ned Devine just long enough to collect the
money.  Michael is not sure it is going to be so easy.  Michael is dead
right.  The man from the lottery wants reasonable proof that he is not
giving the prize money to the wrong man.  But reasonable proof is just
what is not possible to give.  Eventually the whole village will have
to be pulled into the fraudulent scheme if it going to work.  One
subplot that could have used a little polishing is that of the village
"witch," a most disagreeable woman who threatens to blackmail the
entire town for a larger share of the proceeds.  The subplot is crudely
resolved without the sort of finesse that is characteristic of most of
the rest of the script.  Similarly the entire plot is only partially
tied off at the end.  One wonders in what the state of the village will
be in another year.  The way is wide open for a sequel.</P>
<P>     Top billing goes to veteran actor Ian Bannen as an infectious
schemer, and yet totally likable.  But at least as much credit should
go to David Kelly as Michael O'Sullivan.  Kelly, with the huge duckbill
nose and the scrawny body of a plucked duck hanging in the shop is a
positive treasure.  In spite of Bannen's grace in front of the camera
and his infectious smile, most of the heavy laughs are earned by Kelly.
Still, together the massive Bannen and the wiry Kelly make a great
team, each being the foil for the other.  The story, by director Kirk
Jones, is a simple and pure situation comedy.  This is Kelly's first
feature film, having previously made commercials.</P>
<P>     Henry Braham's photography certainly demonstrates that the scenery
of Tullymore is beautiful, though he avoids showing it in its full
glory.  A lot of his photography catches the scenery when it is gray
and raining or at night or when the sun washes out the shot.</P>
<P>     WAKING NED DEVINE is the kind of comedy we do not see frequently
enough any more coming from the United Kingdom and Ireland.  This film
is reminiscent of WHISKEY GALORE and LOCAL HERO. Similar American films
are usually done with too heavy a hand.  WAKING NED DEVINE is a
pleasure.  I give it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
