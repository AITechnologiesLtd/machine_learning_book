<PRE>" Arlington Road "   * * 1/2</PRE>
<P>    Despite its plethora of unanswered questions, and a loud, grating
performance by Jeff Bridges, ARLINGTON ROAD still turns out to be an
effective thriller.  Sort of.  I was reminded of the film SEVEN (the only
movie that has ever left me shaking), with its claustrophobic atmosphere,
moody score (courtesy the great Angelo Badalamenti), and sense of impending
doom.  SEVEN is a far superior motion picture, but I cannot discount any
film that manages to leave me unnerved.</P>
<P>You know right away that Michael Faraday (an unmercifully one-note
Bridges), who teaches a course on terrorism, and Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins),
the seemingly normal guy next door, are going to have problems.  After
rescuing the his neighborπs young boy ≠ and, Iπm not sure what this scene
has anything to with the rest of the film ≠ Tom quickly suspects wrongdoing.
He is obsessed over the death of his wife, and rants about the evil that are
extremist groups ≠ all of which seems to feed some basic paranoia he
harbors.  And, thus begins a film-long quest to find out just why somebody
would lie about where they attended college.</P>
<P>I mentioned loose ends:  this movie has åem.  For instance, what does
the opening sequence have to do with anything else that comes after?  I
mean, except to introduce the two men.  And why (SPOILER alert), considering
the overall scheme of things, did Michaelπs girlfriend have to die?  What
was the deal with the blueprint, or whatever it was, hidden behind the
picture frame?  Those computers the villains were driving around withä??
And, then ARLINGTON ROAD commits the ultimate cinematic no-no of assuming
that climactic events are going to unfold in just the right way, for the
film to pay off like it wants to, when any number of things could go wrong
to avert that ending.  Not that I have problem with this ending, which comes
completely out of left field, but in a good way.  Iπm only saying donπt
cheat the audience.  Had ARLINGTON ROAD played fair, the whole way, it
wouldπve been a terrific entertainment.  Lose Jeff Bridges, or at least tone
him down a few trillion notches, and it wouldπve been one of the yearπs
best.</P>
