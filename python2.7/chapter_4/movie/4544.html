<PRE>                             DUNSTON CHECKS IN
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>        About the easiest way to make a comedy is to use a monkey
(in this case, an orangutan which is actually an ape)) as the film's
hero.  A monkey, by definition, is a comedic character.  Let him
run loose and you have a funny film.  Adults will laugh but the
kids will laugh even harder.  Money in the bank.</P>
<P>        Lord Rutledge (Rupert Everett) is a nogoodnik, a jewel thief
who owns and uses Dunston, the monkey, to do the dirty work of
stealing.  Dunston escapes his conniving master and checks into the
classy Majestic Hotel owned by Mrs. Dubrow (Faye Dunaway) and run by
the very efficient manager, Robert Grant (the Jason Alexander of the
Seinfeld show).  The comedy surrounding the antics and havoc as
Dunston goes ape (excuse the pun) is further enhanced by a youngster
Eric Lloyd,  and Paul Rubens as an animal control officer.</P>
