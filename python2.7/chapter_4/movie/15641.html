<PRE>* Note: Contains spoilers.</PRE>
<P>Ever since a "recreation" of Alfred Hitchcock's infamous 1960 classic, 
"Psycho," was announced earlier this year, many fans of the original 
yelled blasphemy and were outraged that anyone would attempt a remake. 
But, of course, this wasn't just any remake, because acclaimed director 
Gus Van Sant firmly stated that the new version would rigidly follow the 
original's screenplay, although it would be set in 1998, and that his 
purpose was to freshly introduce a classic to a new generation. Up until 
its release, rumors flew by, questioning what the differences would be 
in this 1998 version. And in keeping with its predecessor, Van Sant 
didn't even screen it for critics in advance, just as Hitchcock didn't 
38 years ago.</P>
<P>Ultimately, there is one question in all "Psycho" fans' minds: Is this 
film better than the original? The answer is no, not quite, but to my 
shock, it is just about as good of a remake as could have possibly been 
expected. </P>
<P>For a full synopsis of the storyline, my review for Psycho (1960) is 
recommended, but simply to recount the plot, a young banker by the name 
of Marion Crane (Anne Heche) steals $400,000 (it was $40,000 in the 
original) and while on the run, picks the wrong motel to spend the night 
in, headed by the boyish young man, Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn).
"Psycho '98," which I will refer to this film as for the rest of my 
review to avoid confusion, surely does follow Joseph Stefano's original 
screenplay, and is a bold experiment on Van Sant's part. No film has 
ever been remade shot-by-shot, but, for the most part, "Psycho '98," is. 
And since the original was such a masterpiece, the things an audience 
must go on this time around are the elements surrounding the script, 
such as the technical credits, acting, style, etc. Luckily, "Psycho 
'98," is a startling success, a film that is impressive in almost every 
department.</P>
<P>Van Sant has assembled a great line of actors in this film, and although 
the tempting thing to do would have been to mimic the original actors, 
they all smartly choose to add their own interpretation and spin to the 
characters, and thus, we actually do grow different feeling for the 
people than in the 1960 version. Anthony Perkins has been such a staple 
of, "Psycho," that no one could ever replace him as Norman Bates, but 
Vince Vaughn must be applauded for going in a totally different 
direction with the character, and dare I say, nearly equalling Perkins. 
Vaughn's Norman has the ability to be threatening, but I also felt far 
more sympathy for him in this film. Anne Heche is also very good as 
Marion Crane, and although Janet Leigh might have been a little better, 
Heche was more likable. Julianne Moore, as Marion's sister, Lila, 
replaces Vera Miles and is interesting because she is so much more 90's. 
She is even introduced wearing a walkman. Viggo Mortensen, as Marion's 
boyfriend, taking over for John Gavin, also does a full 180 degree turn 
on the character, giving him a cowboy attitude. Rounding out the five 
central characters is William H. Macy, outstanding as Detective 
Arbogast, actually improving upon Martin Balsam's portrayal (although he 
was fabulous, as well).</P>
<P>There are lots of nice, eerie touches throughout that add to the film. 
For example, the shower scene, far more graphic this time around, is 
actually more suspenseful than in the original. The set-up wisely goes 
on longer, as we see the door open and a figure walk into the bathroom, 
as we see through the shower curtain. Unlike the original, where the 
murder happens abruptly, the figure pauses for a few moments through the 
shower curtain, before...well, you know. The actual murder set-piece 
also puts a new spin on things, and is harrowing, to say the least. The 
other murder sequence, set on the staircase, is also extremely 
effective. As Arbogast is stabbed, there are quick flashes of disturbing 
images, such as a cow in the middle of a desolate road about to be hit 
by an automobile. This stylish decision, thanks to Van Sant, is 
atmospheric and ingenious. Finally, the climax set in the fruit cellar 
surpassed all of my possible expectations, and the unveiling of Norman's 
mother really was frightening. </P>
<P>There are things that occur in, "Psycho '98," that Hitchcock could not 
have possibly done in 1960, because of the censors, but that add to the 
Norman Bates character. For example, while Norman peers through a hole 
in the wall at Marion undressing, he begins to masturbate, and it was 
actually touching. I couldn't believe how moving it was. Also, in the 
climax, while Lila is looking through the house, she goes into Norman's 
room, which resembles a twisted children's bedroom, equipped with toy 
soldiers, stuffed animals, and a porno magazine hidden in a drawer. It 
was subtle elements like this that made me start to care for Norman 
Bates, who is obviously a very confused, lonely man. </P>
<P>Major kudos, aside from the performances, must go to the alternately 
beautiful and moody production design by Tom Foden, the disturbing, 
original cinematography by Chris Doyle, and, of course, the 
incomparable, pounding music score by Bernard Herrmann, which was 
flawlessly adapted by Danny Elfman.</P>
<P>So with all of this praise, why isn't "Psycho '98," quite as good as the 
original? Well, the Lila character wasn't quite as memorable as when 
Vera Miles did the role, although this is no fault of Moore's. And the 
black & white photography of Hitchcock's could never possibly be 
replaced by color. </P>
<P>Although this new, "Psycho," is, in my mind, the best horror film of the 
year, I have a feeling that most people unfamiliar with the original 
will not like it very much. I have no doubt in my mind that some 
dimwitted teenagers are going to go into this thinking it will be a 
"Scream"-style slasher film, and they will be sorely disappointed. 
Although those types of movies have a rightful place in the horror 
genre, "Psycho," is better, because it is not all about killing (there's 
only two murders in the film), but instead is about the style and 
characters. Watching this film, I was struck by the extended dialogue 
scenes between some of the characters, which are so much more developed 
than most films of today's times. Director Gus Van Sant took a risky 
chance in remaking what is considered one of the greatest horror 
pictures ever made, and he has succeeded in all departments, actually 
improving upon the original in a few select aspects. Nothing will ever 
be able to take the place of Hitchcock, that is for sure, but I was 
amazed and awestruck at just how close Van Sant actually came to doing 
just that.</P>
