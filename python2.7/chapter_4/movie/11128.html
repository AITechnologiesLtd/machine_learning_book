<PRE>THE WINGS OF THE DOVE</PRE>
<PRE>by Luke Buckmaster</PRE>
<P>The Wings of the Dove is a 101 minute adoption of one of Henry James lesser
known novels.  A short and sweet soapy, if you will.</P>
<P>Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter) is a conniving and repressively gloomy
character, who is wholly in love with town commoner Merton Densher (Linus
Roach).  Forbidding their relationship is Kates upper class Aunt Maud
(Charlotte Rampling), who threatens to exclude Kate and her divorced father from
the familys vast fortune.</P>
<P>The lovers sexual and emotional relationship is based on their understanding of
each other, and the knowing that wherever one goes the other will be standing
with them side to side.  But Kate doesnt think twice about ignoring Mertons
pleads for a low-standing-in-society-but-spiritually-beneficial marriage, and
explores all opportunities to have her cake and screw it too.</P>
<P>The dazzling Millie Theale (Alison Elliot) enters the scheme; a charming and
gorgeous millionaire who is slowly dying of a terminal disease. Kate works up a
devilish scheme for Merton to seduce Millie, thus inheriting all her money if
the plan goes right.  But sooner or later she is forced to contemplate her
relationships integrity by balancing her desire to be rich by her longing to be
the only woman in Mertons mind.</P>
<P>What director Iain Softley (who gave us Hackers in 1995) delivers in Dove is
provocative, finely tuned romance of a dark nature.  The essence of real
situations and characters are existent is so many ways  Carters performance as
the arrogant Kate, the lush surroundings of London and Venice and most of all a
genuinely well written script.  He has been careful not to make the film place
all its cards on the table too soon, so interesting character developments occur
which renew the viewers interest levels.  And just when you thought that the
Wings of the Dove had shown you all it has to offer, riveting ending scenes put
everything into perspective.</P>
<P>If films like Sense and Sensibility or SBS movies have put you off period
dramas, then rest assured that Wings of the Dove is much more enjoyable than
many others of its kind.  Although not exactly easy viewing, this is one motion
picture than deserves to be known as something very unique and artistic.</P>
<PRE>4 stars out of 5
Superbly acted on all accounts</PRE>
