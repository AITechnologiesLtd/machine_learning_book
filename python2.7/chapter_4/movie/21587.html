<P>At one point in the controversial religious comedy "Dogma," an
irritated apostle turns to a human and snaps, "I have issues with
anyone who treats God like a burden rather than a blessing, the way
some of you Catholics do. You people don't celebrate your faith; you
mourn it." Amen! There are few things more annoying than "true
believers" who squander the miracle of life by trudging joylessly
through their days, scowling at the wonders around them while passing
judgment on anyone who does not adhere to their particular
interpretation of "divine truth."</P>
<P>Take, for example, the Catholic League, who has spent months
campaigning against "Dogma." They haven't actually seen the film, mind
you, but they did read a version of the script over the Internet and
that was good enough to set off a series of protests from the outraged
members.</P>
<PRE>Aw, fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.</PRE>
<P>Writer, director and practicing Catholic Kevin Smith, the man behind
"Clerks," "Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy," tackles a lot in his fourth
feature. If anything, "Dogma" suffers from trying to cram too many
ideas into one movie. Stripped of its mountain of biblically sound
exposition, the story boils down to this: two renegade angels, cast
out of Heaven, find a theological loophole that will allow them back
in. Unfortunately, if they succeed in their quest, they will prove God
fallible and our world will wink out of existence. So a distant
descendent of a pivotal religious figure gets recruited to stop them.</P>
<P>"Dogma" is a wildly uneven film. Dense and overly talky, it is
consistently funny, vulgar and thought provoking. Moments of sheer
brilliance bang into segments of juvenile crap (I mean that
literally. In the movie's grossest scene, our heroes do battle with a
shit demon). Simple, eloquent statements about spirituality collide
with self-righteous tirades as excessively pious as those typically
made by the organized religion blowhards being satirized. "Dogma" is a
mess, but a glorious one. This is clearly a labor of love and
devotion. As with his previous works, Kevin Smith doesn't know when to
shut up. Another script rewrite and some severe editing would help the
story immeasurably. Still, "Dogma" remains an exhilarating treat that
couldn't have been created by any other author.</P>
<P>Your enjoyment of the film will depend in large part on your reaction
to Jay and Silent Bob, two mainstays of Kevin Smith movies who get a
lion's share of screen time here. I find the hapless stoners
hilarious. Jay (Jason Mewes) is an explosive motormouth obsessed with
getting laid (after an encounter with a deity in female form, he
confesses to getting a stiffy). His constant companion Silent Bob
(director Kevin Smith) is a stout, stoic soul who always manages to
come through when it counts. Together they make up the funniest duo
since Abbott and Costello.</P>
<P>But Jay and Silent Bob are just two of a cavalcade of unique
characters. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do fine work as Loki and
Bartleby, the rampaging angels causing all the trouble. Their
squabbles and philosophical discussions are consistently
engaging. Chris Rock is a hoot as Rufus, the smart aleck 13th apostle
(he believes he was edited out of the Bible because of his skin
color). Salma Hayek and Jason Lee make lively appearances as a pair of
muses with decidedly different outlooks. And, get this: George Carlin
plays Cardinal Glick, the personification of all that is wrong with
organized religion. To make the church more palatable to contemporary
citizens, he cooks up a public relations campaign called "Catholicism
- - Wow!" that replaces the old, "depressing" crucifix with a new
icon, the "Buddy Christ": a cheesy, brightly colored Jesus who flashes
a toothy smile while pointing at the faithful and giving them a big
thumbs-up.</P>
<P>Anchoring all this lunacy is Metatron (Alan Rickman), a weary angel
who serves as the earthly voice of God, and Bethany (Linda Fiorentino)
a faith-impaired Catholic reluctantly drawn into the role of
savior. Rickman and Fiorentino are wonderful as the best-drawn
characters in the story. A subdued waterside conversation between the
two marks one of the most touching parts of the film.</P>
<P>The release of "Dogma" will likely bring a storm of damnation from
various commentators representing the religious establishment. I
suggest you see the film and decide for yourself. Despite its flaws
and excesses, I found the production extremely entertaining and very
spiritual. I lost both of my parents over the last year and, in the
months since, have found myself numb in areas of faith. The night
after seeing "Dogma," I finally closed my eyes and had a long
conversation with God. Thanks for the nudge, Kevin.</P>
