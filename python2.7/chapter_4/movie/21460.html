Running time: 116 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Like the superb A Few Good Men, The General's Daughter is a
murder mystery that puts the military on trial and probes the rotten
core of the corps.  The film also similarly questions the unblinking
obedience to strict codes of behaviour and disciplined adherence to
"the army way" that leads to abuses.</P>
<P>The catalyst here is the discovery of a bound and brutally
beaten body on a military base.  The victim is a female officer and
psychological warfare expert.  She is also the only child of legendary
general Joe Campbell (James Cromwell, from Babe, etc), a highly
decorated officer who is about to retire from the military and take up
a very high profile position in public life as a vice presidential
candidate.  Campbell is anxious to avoid any hint of scandal, and
wants the murder quietly and quickly investigated before the FBI is
called in.</P>
<P>Assigned the unenviable and politically prickly task is CID
investigator Paul Brenner (John Travolta), who has special powers of
arrest.  We quickly learn that Brenner is something of a maverick, who
shoots first and asks questions later, and who also has a healthy
disdain for following military protocol.  Assisting the investigation
is Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), a rape specialist with whom
Brenner had an affair many years earlier.  The pair trample through a
minefield of military secrets, long buried scandals, corruption, and
sordid sex that eventually leads all the way to West Point.  They also
uncover a list of high profile suspects that includes the dead woman's
boss Colonel Moore (a wonderfully smarmy James Woods) and the
general's personal aide (Clarence Williams III, from the original Mod
Squad).</P>
<P>Based on Nelson De Mille's best selling novel, The General's
Daughter is a somewhat brutal and ugly film, with an emphasis on
graphic violence and sordid sex, that will do little for the image of
the army.  The clever and sinuous plot features a number of red
herrings that will keep audiences hooked until the denouement.  One
suspects that veteran script doctor and dual Oscar winning writer
William Goldman is largely responsible for polishing the crackling
dialogue, especially the wonderful interrogation scene between Brenner
and Moore which snaps with clever barbs and verbal one- upmanship.</P>
<P>Director Simon West (who burst onto the screen with the
sensational action thriller Con Air) leaves behind the spectacular
pyrotechnics and spectacular action sequences of his debut to
concentrate more on character and atmosphere here.  Nonetheless his
direction is proficient and he maintains a keen level of suspense
throughout the film.</P>
<P>Travolta brings a dangerous edge and rare intensity to his
performance as the driven Brenner, while Stowe is both tough yet
vulnerable as Sunhill.  Cromwell brings dignity and class to his role
as the veteran general who has devoted his life to the military.  West
has assembled a veritable rogue's gallery, including Timothy Hutton,
Williams, and the brilliant, scene stealing Woods, to flesh out the
list of colourful suspects.</P>
