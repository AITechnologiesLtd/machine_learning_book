<PRE>I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>It must be the holiday season already.  Stores are stocked with
decorations galore, and the local theaters are stocked with "feel-good"
holiday films, like I'll Be Home for Christmas.  However, don't be
fooled by its title...you aren't likely to build up much holiday cheer
by forcing yourself to sit through this torturous ninety-minute debacle.</P>
<P>Jonathan Taylor Thomas stars as the annoying prep school kid, Jake. Jake
is the type of smarmy kid who tries to talk his way out of everything,
and mostly succeeds.  His father (Gary Cole), believing the only way his
son will return home for the holidays, resorts to bribery.  If Jake can
make it home by 6:00 Christmas Eve, he will get his dad's classic
Porsche as a present. Jake would do anything for the car...but he runs
into a little bit of trouble along the way...</P>
<P>A group of angry jocks, angry at Jake for a failed scheme of his,
kidnaps him, glues him into a Santa suit, and strands him in the
California desert.  Penniless, Jake must make his cross-country trek in
a few short days if he ever hopes to see that car...or his girlfriend.</P>
<P>You see, his charms have been wearing thin on his girlfriend, Allie
(Jessica Biel).  She's had one too many stories and lies, and when he
fails to meet her for the Christmas return home, she decides to take a
ride with Jake's rival, Eddie (Adam Lavorgna), instead.</P>
<P>All of this might be the slightest bit interesting if we cared one iota
about Jake and/or his predicament.  But we don't.  From the get-go, his
cocky attitude is extremely off-putting, and his "charms" never grow on
us.  Frankly, his dad might as well keep the car, and Allie would
certainly be better off with the only slightly-less annoying Eddie.</P>
<P>Of course, we are treated to all sorts of wild adventures and wacky,
"colorful" characters which Jake runs across in his cross-country trek.
Anyone who's seen any sort of road-trip movie will be intimately
familiar with the type.  Most of these are not near as interesting, nor
as entertaining, as they might have appeared on paper (though it's even
doubtful that some of these appeared interesting there either).</P>
<P>I'll Be Home for Christmas is reminiscent of an annual present that you
don't really want to get.  It means well, but is best left alone and
forgotten.</P>
