<PRE>                          IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Charlie (Nicolas Cage) is an unlikely NYC cop: honest and
dedicated beyond the call of duty.  His wife, Muriel, (Rosie Perez) and
he live in the borough of Queens in a very modest apartment house.
Muriel wants to be rich.  Muriel keeps haranguing him to be a little
less honest and pick up some extra money with which she is obsessed.
She also insists he buy a Lottery ticket despite the insane odds
against winning a jackpot.</P>
<P>     On Charlie's beat is a little coffee shop.  One of the waitresses
is Yvonne (Bridget Fonda).  A judge has just given her a break by
having her declared bankrupt when the husband whom she has left has run
up a $12,000 tab on their Master card.</P>
<P>     Charlie and his partner are having coffee when their pager goes
off calling them to an emergency.   He pays Muriel the bill but
discovers he has no change for a tip.  Instead, he promises her if he
wins the lottery he will give her half his winning; if he loses he will
be back with a tip.  This being the movies, he wins ... $4 million.
When he breaks the news to his wife that he is going to give the
waitress half of the winning "because I promised her," she hits the
ceiling.</P>
<P>     Up to this point the fairy tale is funny and easy enough with
which to go along.  Charlie is very nice, Yvonne is sweet and grateful
for the $2 million and wife Muriel is a riot with her tantrums.  But
the movie turns mean when Muriel becomes shrill and vindictive.  The
little fantasy we were enjoying turns real and sordid and all the fun
leaves the film.</P>
<P>     Isaac Hayes has a cameo as the narrator and Red Buttons does a bit
as an attorney.</P>
