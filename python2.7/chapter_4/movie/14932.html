THE UNTOUCHABLES
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Some films are remembered for quite unexpected reasons. Few
months before THE UNTOUCHABLES would come into former
Yugoslavia cinemas in 1988, soundtrack album by Ennio
Morricone was released in music stores. The themes from that
soundtrack became very popular among music supervisors for
different radio and TV shows. Almost all of those shows
dealt with mounting economic and political problems of the
crumbling federation, and Morricone's disturbing music
corresponded with a anxious atmosphere in the eve of bloody
break-up. Notably cheerful exception was a TV broadcast when
the old Communist was interviewed about his past; Al
Capone's theme was playing in the background, which was very
subtle way for the show's creator to express their opinion
about dying Communist regime.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie is set in dark moments of another
federation which, unlike former Yugoslavia, survived hard
times. The year is 1930, and America pays heavy price for
its experiment with Prohibition. Illegal, yet lucrative
business of bootlegging made Al Capone (Robert de Niro)
undisputed leader of the Chicago underworld and most
powerful man in the city. However, despite his public
businessman personality, Capone keeps his supremacy by
brutal violence, not caring about the lives of innocent
people. After small girl died in one of such incidents,
Federal government decides to stop the violence by creating
special task force. The force is led by Eliot Ness (Kevin
Costner), Treasury Department official whose zeal is in
great contrast with his inexperience in law enforcement. His
debut raid on Capone's warehouse ends in embarrassing
fiasco, and Ness now knows that he can't rely on notoriously
corrupt local police. The rare exception among Chicago cops
is old Malone (Sean Connery), who lost career because of his
honesty. Ness gets the idea to create unit of few, yet
capable and reliable lawmen that would battle Capone's
all-powerful organisation. He and Malone recruit two more
men - Treasury accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin
Smith) and Chicago rookie policeman George Stone (Andy
Garcia) - and they become hitting Capone's operations hard,
earning the nickname 'The Untouchables' by the press.</P>
<P>When the film originally appeared in cinema, expectations
were quite high, partly because of very effective
soundtrack, partly because of Sean Connery finally getting
his long-deserved "Oscar", and finally because all major
critics praised creative genius of director Brian de Palma.
Unfortunately, the final product was good, yet far bellow
the expectations. As years went by, THE UNTOUCHABLES began
fading into oblivion, and newer generations of viewers would
probably have some problems in understanding its original
success. Same can be said for some old viewers, especially
the fans of TV series UNTOUCHABLES. The series, although
based on non-fiction book by Oscar Fraley and Eliot Ness,
was a great departure from the historic truth and offered
one-dimensional picture of Prohibition-era Chicago, by
confronting virtuous law enforcement supermen with soulless
gangster scum. Thirty years did almost nothing to connect
THE UNTOUCHABLES myth with history, and the screenplay by
Pullitzer Prize winning playwright David Mamet went even
further from established facts.</P>
<P>In David Mamet's vision Eliot Ness is embodiment of all
American virtues - upholding law, dedicated to the job,
loving husband and father. Kevin Costner, with his Gary
Cooper image, was perfect for that role and it shouldn't
surprise anyone that THE UNTOUCHABLES launched his career of
major movie star. Unfortunately, Robert de Niro wasn't so
good in the role of his archenemy and despite all his
efforts (even buying and wearing the identical underwear
that Capone used to wear) he fails to capture the true
spirit of Capone on screen. Instead of vicious gangster, we
got a bad caricature of Benito Mussolini. The notorious
bludgeoning scene, obviously incorporated to give Capone's
character some viciousness, doesn't improve such
impressions. The only really developed character in the
movie is Malone, brilliantly played by Sean Connery. Motive
of policemen who must break the law in order to uphold it,
hinted by Mamet's script, would probably be unnoticed in the
movie if it weren't for Connery.</P>
<P>Director de Palma, on the other hand, didn't care much about
the characters and story. For him, this was just another
exercise in mannerist film-making and another victory for
those who prefer style over substance in art. The movie
looks great, thanks to production designs of Patrizia von
Brandenstein and William A. Elliott, costumes by Giorgio
Armani and  Stephen H. Burum's photography and all the other
that took great care to capture the period details. Yet,
most impressive and most memorable part of the film is the
famous Showdown at the Steps scene, de Palma's intentional
homage to Einstenstein's BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN. The scene is
visually stunning, de Palma's manages to go over the top, by
featuring couple of sailors only to make his reference even
more obvious. All in all, THE UNTOUCHABLES can be seen as
conventional and satisfying period thriller, and failed work
of art in the same time.</P>
