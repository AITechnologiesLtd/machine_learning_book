<P>Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice's internationally acclaimed musical 'Evita'
is now a big screen motion picture featuring a sweeping pace despite its
running time of approximately two hours and fifteen minutes.  Some may come
out feeling as if they've watched an extended music video and that feeling is
justified but the integrity and originality of the play is kept intact by
director Alan Parker.  Parker is certainly no stranger to orchestrating and
piecing together films with a musical background.  'Fame' (1980) and 'The
Committments' (1991) are examples of Parker's talent and his eye for
dramatization is nothing to shy away from, either, as his craft in that
department was established with 'Midnight Express' (1978) and 'Mississippi
Burning' (1988).  Madonna who at first was a controversial choice to play the
title role stars as Eva Duarte, a poor Spanish woman who rose to national and
international attention when she married Argentinian dictator Juan Peron and
campaigned to help the poor while politicizing her own gains and that of her
husbands.  Despite being a target for many years by critics, Madonna is
electrifying in the picture and will probably receive an Oscar nomination for
her work.  Juan Peron is played in a straight forward manner by Jonathan
Pryce and Antonio Banderas is Che, a man who follows the everyday antics of
Eva.  Fans of the musical will be pleased to see it revived as this is an
almost zero speaking picture and 99.9999% song.  It's vivid re-creation of
that period is matched extensively by panoramic camera work.  'Evita' will
probably be enjoyed better by people who have seen the play but for those new
to the material, I don't think you'll be disappointed.</P>
