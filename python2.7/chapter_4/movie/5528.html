<P>     The release of ERASER begs the question:  haven't there been enough 
action films already this summer?  With the likes of TWISTER, MISSION 
IMPOSSIBLE, THE PHANTOM, DRAGONHEART, and THE ROCK floating around, do 
we really need ERASER?  Probably not, but Hollywood has decided to give 
us this film, anyway.  Besides, no one does it quite like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger -- or at least that's what Warner Brothers would have us 
believe.  And, until fans stop flocking to see the latest offering from 
this human tree trunk, he'll keep coming back.</P>
<P>     ERASER is the latest in a growing number of "high tech" action 
flicks (THE NET, HACKERS, and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE all fit into that 
category).  It takes the usual chases, explosions, and shoot-outs, and 
places them in plot that involves all sorts of computerized and 
electronic gadgetry.  Often, as is the case here, not much attention is 
paid to whether the "science" is technologically feasible, but if 
something looks and sounds neat, why not use it?</P>
<P>     ERASER will hearten the group of Schwarzenegger fans who have been 
depressed by their favorite star's ventures beyond the action realm 
(such as the bloated parody LAST ACTION HERO and the completely unfunny 
JUNIOR).  This is Arnold at his muscle-bound, gun-toting best, mowing 
down bad guys without taking much of a breather.  And, while 
Schwarzenegger is more of a personality than an actor, he has a solid 
supporting cast this time around, including Vanessa Williams, James Caan 
(thoroughly enjoying himself as the bad guy), Robert Pastorelli in the 
Joe Pesci-type sidekick role, and James Coburn.</P>
<P>     The premise is moderately intriguing.  Schwarzenegger is John 
Kruger, a Federal Marshal working for the Witness Security Department.  
It's his job to "erase" the identities of Federally-protected witnesses 
so that they survive long enough to testify in court.  Occasionally, the 
job requires him to go to excessive lengths to keep someone alive, and 
Kruger frequently leaves a trail of bodies behind him.  Not only that, 
but he's got more stamina than the Energizer Bunny.  He can get stabbed 
through the hand and shot in the shoulder and still use that arm to do 
some amazing things.</P>
<P>     Things heat up for Kruger when his latest client, a former employee 
of Cyrez Technology named Lee Cullen (Williams), is attacked and nearly 
killed by a group of assassins packing a "rail gun" -- a nasty weapon 
that uses electromagnetic pulses to propel projectiles at incredibly 
fast rates of speed.  Cullen has in her possession a disk crammed with 
information that could incriminate a number of highly-placed government 
officials in an illegal gun running operation, including the 
Undersecretary of Defense, several crooked FBI agents, and Kruger's 
boss, Robert Deguerin (Caan).  As soon as Kruger takes the woman into 
his protection, he finds himself framed for murder and on the run from 
just about every law enforcement agent.  His only hope -- unlock the 
disk's secrets and prove his innocence to his boss' boss (Coburn).</P>
<P>     There are some definite similarities between ERASER and MISSION 
IMPOSSIBLE.  Both involve betrayals and government cover-ups, both have 
plots that revolve around information contained on disks, both feature a 
break-in to a supposedly-secure installation, and both contain several 
high-energy action sequences.  Ultimately, however, ERASER is marginally 
more enjoyable.  Not only is Schwarzenegger a better action hero than 
Tom Cruise, but the plotline of this film, while far from a masterpiece 
of originality, isn't filled with the silly, convoluted twists that 
choked MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.  And, perhaps best of all, ERASER has a lot 
of delightfully corny dialogue (including Arnold calmly telling a dead 
alligator, "You're luggage").</P>
<P>     While most of ERASER is pretty standard stuff, there are a few fun 
variations.  One big chase sequence takes place in a zoo, and involves a 
showdown with some hungry alligators.  There's also an exciting 
skydiving scene that has Schwarzenegger playing chicken with a crippled 
727 while unable to get his parachute to function properly.  Finally, 
several of the gun fights, because they feature rail guns, are a little 
more interesting than standard shoot-outs.  The movie also consciously 
avoids several of the worst action-film standbys:  the lead male and 
female do not fall in love, and, thankfully, they aren't always at each 
other's throats.  Cullen accepts that Kruger is trying to help her, and 
decides not to fight him every step of the way.</P>
<P>     It will be interesting to see how this film fares, emerging as it 
does in the wake of so much previous chaos and mayhem, not to mention 
going toe-to-toe with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (although I'm sure the 
target audiences are vastly different).  Frankly, I'm getting tired of 
all this action -- ERASER is fun in a limited sort of way, but it would 
have been more enjoyable if it had come out in a less-crowded market.  
Regardless, the film is available now, and if you're on the lookout for 
another loud roller-coaster movie ride, or if you consider yourself a 
Schwarzenegger fan, it's worth a look. </P>
