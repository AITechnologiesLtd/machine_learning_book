<P>     There are plenty of strange, ironic and otherwise inexplicable things
about Hollywood filmmaking in the 1990s, but among the more puzzling is
the way it treats "star power."  In the glory days of the studio system,
Hollywood packaged stars together in whatever material was available at
the time, always conscious of the fact that audiences would come out to
see certain actors do little more than model wardrobe.  The game has
changed today, but only in the marketing.  Plenty of films exist primarily
to be glossy star packages, but the studios treat that fact as a dirty
little secret.  In these post-modern, indie-hip cinematic times of ours,
it has become unfashionable to admit that sometimes we just like to see
attractive people doing attractive things.</P>
<P>     That's the only explanation for THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, a star
package so overwhelmingly glossy you may need to shield your eyes from the
glare.  Pierce Brosnan (who, not coincidentally, also produced the film)
stars as the title character, an impossibly wealthy New York mergers and
acquisitions magnate with few worlds left to conquer.  Always on the
lookout for a new thrill, Crown decides to dabble in art theft, arranging
an elaborate decoy so he can snatch a seminal Impressionist masterpiece
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Hot on his trail comes Catherine
Banning (Rene Russo), a sort of mercenary insurance investigator
determined to find the thief.  When she decides Crown is her man, she
begins a cat-and-mouse game in which the only question is who will seduce
whom first.</P>
<P>     THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR follows in the fine tradition of the original
1968 version, which itself existed largely as a star vehicle for Steve
McQueen and Faye Dunaway.  The scenery, from the nightspots of the
Manhattan jet set to the tropical islands to which that set jets, is
lovingly photographed.  Director John McTiernan steps back from DIE
HARD-style pacing to establish a moderate, almost jazzy tempo for the
too-cool characters and situations.  The stars, meanwhile, spend nearly
two hours looking fabulous.  Brosnan, who probably emerged from the womb
in a freshly pressed tuxedo, squints in a manly fashion; Russo, attempting
to do for women's underwear what Clark Gable did for T-shirts, does the
little black dress thing with slinky appeal.  They banter, they undress
each other with their eyes, they undress each other with their hands.
Teflon should only be this slick.</P>
<P>     Plenty of viewers will undoubtedly find themselves carried away by
this fantasia for beautiful people.  I might even have been among them if
THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR hadn't grown so angst-y and redundant.  Throughout
the film, we see snippets of Crown visiting a therapist (Dunaway, in the
obligatory cameo-from-the-original), working out his commitment and trust
issues.  It's an early signal that the film is going to play the "sure,
they're beautiful people, but they've got feelings too" card.  It's
entertaining enough to watch as Crown and Banning circle each other, each
one thinking he or she is the manipulator rather than the manipulatee.
Things get considerably more awkward as Banning waffles in her feelings
for Crown with every alternate scene.  Russo plays the final half hour
with such overwrought gravity that you'd think her decision whether or not
to turn Crown in made her Hamlet to his Polonius. </P>
<P>     I find myself in an awkward position as I criticize THE THOMAS CROWN
AFFAIR, because ultimately I fault it for trying to work in some subtext.
Plenty of films could use a healthy injection of subtext, mind you -- or
the vaugest hint of a text, even -- but this film isn't one of them.  It
fairly screams out to be treated as a caper, with Crown and Banning 
spending their time trying to out-think each other rather than out-emote
each other.  THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR appears to be old-school melodrama, 
the tale of a woman who can't help falling for a guy she knows is bad for
her, and somehow hopes to convert through the intensity of her love.
There's just too much earnestness to the way they play it.  By trying to
play a 1940s story with 1990s emotional realism, the filmmakers miss the
fantasy we're looking for when we watch two movie stars together in a
movie that, ultimately, is about two movie stars together.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 airs to the Crown:  5.</PRE>
