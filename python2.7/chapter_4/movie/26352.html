<P>   When the gifted film maker Darren Aronofsky hit the scene
two years ago with the wildly imaginative, $60,000 movie
called "Pi"--about an obsessed mathematician who thinks
that numbers could determine God's identity and, more
important, calculate the course of the stock market--the
relatively few people privileged to take the movie in knew that
an innovator was born.  The sincere performances by a no-
name cast coupled with attention-getting visuals (particularly
when Sean Gullette's character got himself into the throes of
a cluster headache) told us that we could expect more of the
same ingenuity in films to come.  The gobs of additional
capital for his current feature has not spoiled Aronofsky.  He
is well on the road to achieving the American Dream that he
so brutally savages in "Requiem for a Dream," though we
doubt that he'll fall into the trap met by virtually all of the
principal characters of this grisly tragedy.  </P>
<P>   While the film's surface says "Beware of drugs" (in much
the way that other such works as the groundbreaking "The
Man with the Golden Arm" and the New York-situated "Panic
in Needle Park"), Aronfsky and his co-writer, Hubert Selby Jr.
on whose book the screenplay is based, take on a grander
subject: the illusory pursuit of the American Dream.</P>
<P>   Its young, energetic, and Calvin-Klein-thin principal Harry
Goldfarb (Jared Leto) wants cash to allow him to break out of
his lumpen neighborhood of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn
together with his lonely mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn).  There's
nothing wrong with this aspect of the Dream.  What makes
the situation compelling as drama while savaging the notion
of getting ahead is that the characters are obsessed with
arriving too quickly.  If fantasies of wealth, fame and attention
are global in scope, the ambition to attain them fast fast fast
is fundamentally American.</P>
<P>   "Requiem" plaits the story of a number of people addicted
to drugs, the younger ones interested in heroin as both a
means of getting high and a way to earn big bucks, the older
member addicted to amphetamines as a means of rapidly
losing weight in order to look great on a promise TV
appearance.  </P>
<P>   The story begins as grimly as it concludes.  Harry has once
again broken the chain that secures the family TV to the
radiator, carrying the equipment yet again to the local pawn
shop together with his drug-eating pal, Tyrone (Marlon
Wayans), both of whom require the money not only to
secure heroin fixes for themselves but to expand their
business as pushers.  Sara, once again buying back the TV
from the hock shop whose proprietor is her long-term
neighbor, feeds her own addiction to an infomercial hosted by
the slick and charismatic Tappy Tibbons (Christopher
McDonald), who is able to evoke amazing cooperation from
his dumbed-down live audience. Receiving a cryptic phone
call which promises her an appearance on television some
time in the future, Sara is determined to fit into a red
dress she had worn many years earlier, visits a Dr. Feelgood,
and begins gulping speed pills--which she ultimately takes in
huge quantities causing her refrigerator to bounce up and
down like a character in a Stephen King story.  While she
harbors perfectly respectable hopes for her son Harry to get
married and provide a grandchild for her, Harry carries on a
prolonged affair with the addicted Marion Silver (Jennifer
Connelly), an affair which is on an appealingly joyful
foundation until the roof and indeed all the walls give
way.</P>
<P>   The plot, however mocking of the quick fix toward the
American Dream, does not give the film its primal value. 
What lifts "Requiem" above similar movies done during the
drug-happy 1970's such as Ivan Passer's "Born to Win"--
about an ex-hairdresser (also set in New York City) and his
$100-a-day heroin habit)--is the frequent but not excessive
use of surreal effects.  The bounding refrigerator is as worn a
plot device as the romping furniture in "The Exorcist," and
yet under Mr. Aronofsky's directorial eye the ice box is able
give us in the audience the cold shivers.  "The Man with the
Golden Arm" has nothing on Harry's festering and
gangrous veins, which even his seen-it-all partner, Tyrone
cannot bear to look at, nor can the doctor who inspects the
infected appendage (played by the imitable Dylan Baker in a
surprisingly brief cameo).  Time after time, Aronofsky throws
in an MTV-inspired cartoon, showing two gargantuan pills
dissolving as though in liquid, followed by a pop pop pop and
an eyeball with an inflating pupil.  Aronofsky repeats this 
effect with more humorous ones when showing the ruggedly
dieting Sara rapidly consuming a grapefruit, a hard boiled
egg, and a cup of Joe for breakfast.</P>
<P>   The cast as a whole rises to the occasion.  Ellen Burstyn,
seen shortly after the opening of this film in James Gray's
"The Yards," delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as an
aging mother whose only real problem, loneliness, turns into
the catastrophic dilemma of a psychosis that must be treated
with electroshock.  Her transformation from a typical lower-
middle class Jewish woman on the rundown shores of
Brooklyn's Brighton Beach to something out of Anatole
Litvak's 1948 groundbreaker "The Snake Pit" is a credit to
her skills as a major American performer.  Marlon Wayans
rises to the occasion.  Fresh from an over-the-top manic stint
in "Scary Movie," Wayans turns in a productive act as a
thoroughly wired addict looking to score both the next fix and
the American Dream.  Even Woody Allen would appreciate
the comic touch of elderly women lined up on beach chairs
outside an aging tenement, all crying out, "Hello Harry" over
the glare of their sun reflectors.</P>
