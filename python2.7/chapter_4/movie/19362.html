<P>How the West Was Won (1962, Henry Hathaway with John Ford and George
Marshall)</P>
<P>A Retrospective Review by David M. Arnold</P>
<P>Before there was IMAX there was Cinerama.  Cinerama was a large-format
presentation technology that featured a screen that was about half as
high as an IMAX screen, but about half again as wide.  Three interlocked
projectors were used to mate images from three strips of film onto
the huge, curved screen.  By using a larger camera negative (.996" x
1.116") x 3, the Cinerama effective aperature was 2.998 x 1.116, more
than 5 times larger than for standard film. A 7-channel sound system
complemented the images, and the result was an experience very much like
today's IMAX.</P>
<P>The business model for Cinerama was also very similar to today's IMAX:
Specially constructed theatres presented specially made films.  IMAX
films in general are 45 minute documentaries with superb production
values but with rather lame content.  With the exception perhaps of
"Everest", I haven't seen an IMAX film that didn't cover fields that
have been much more thoroughly plowed in countless PBS "Nova" and
"Nature" episodes.  As IMAX films primarily feature IMAX, Cinerama
films primarily featured Cinerama.  IMAX and Cinerama both are to
Cinema what a roller coaster is to transportation.</P>
<P>A total of 6 films, primarily travelogues (7 if you include
"Windjammer", another travelogue made for the similar but competing
Cinemiracle system) were made for Cinerama between 1952 and 1962.
The best Cinerama film is probably "How the West Was Won", made as
a joint venture by Cinerama and MGM.  There are a maybe a couple of
prints of "HTWWW" extant in Cinerama 3-strip, and maybe one theatre
still capable of presenting it.  A standard Panavision-compatible
extraction print has been made (which loses about 10% from each of
the two side frames), and this print is available on video.  What
distinguishes "HTWWW" from other Cinerama titles is that it attempts
to use the format for narrative purposes -- the format becomes a means
to an end rather than the end itself.</P>
<P>"How the West Was Won" portrays three generations of pioneers as they
travelled west, starting in Albany, New York in the 1820's.  The film
covers the early Midwest, the California gold rush, wagon trains, the
Civil War, the construction of the transcontinental railroad, and the
eventual triumph of Law and Order.  The film features a veritable who's
who of 50's and 60's talent:  Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden,
Gregory Peck, George Peppard, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart, John
Wayne, and Spencer Tracy among many others.  Setting aside the usual
1960's movie cliches, the film does an adequate job of presenting what
is basically a historical docu-drama, and it succeeds in keeping one's
interest.  It's far from extraordinary, however, and without the
Cinerama aspect, it would be rather routine.</P>
<P>Viewing "How the West Was Won" on our projection home theatre equipment,
gave me a hint at what the Cinerama experience must have been like.  The
strengths and weaknesses of the Cinerama format are quite obvious.
The major strength is Cinerama's ability to photograph very wide-angle
scenes (the camera was capable of a nearly 150-degree field of view)
with none of the barrel distortion evident in today's widescreen
presentations (this is a problem that IMAX hasn't solved either).
The major weakness is that the image is obviously made of three
pieces, and some rather odd linear distortions are sometimes evident
at the seams.  Much of this is no doubt due to the single-frame
extraction print from which the video was made, and due to the fact
that our screen is flat rather than curved.  All in all, "How the
West Was Won" is a worthy film that any film enthusiast should see
in order to catch a glimpse of an important episode in the history
of film technology. Just make sure you see the letterboxed version.</P>
<P>Anyone interested in a thorough discussion of the history of film
technology in general and Cinerama in particular should visit Martin
Hart's American Widescreen Museum website at:

<P>We watched "HTWWW" on DVD from MGM.  The quality of the disc was OK,
given the age of the material and the number of generations removed
from the original negatives, but this is one film that could have
really benefitted from anamorphic (16x9) enhancement.  There were a
couple of authoring problems with this disc that are noteworthy:
First, the grating, full-screen "Turner" logo appeared sandwiched
BETWEEN the overture and the opening credits.  Second, in the disc's
menus, a chapter covering the Erie Canal is titled, "THE EERIE CANAL".
I grew up along the old Erie canal.  Eerie it was not.</P>
