Fine Line Features
in English and Italian with English subtitles
starring Thandie Newton, David Thewlis, Claudio Santamaria
based on a story by James Landun
written by Bernardo Bertolucci and Clare Peploe
directed by Bernardo Bertolucci</P>
<P>An old African man plucks a tribal instrument and sings in a scratchy
voice.  A woman walks alone down a dirt road, then watches her husband
get taken away to a military prison. A lonely man sits in an enormous
Roman home and plays an intense piece he has just composed on the
piano.</P>
<P>These are but a few of the breathtaking images caught on film in
Bernardo Bertolucci's beautifully made "Besieged". Over many years,
this Italian filmmaker has made a name for himself with exquisite,
emotional films such as "The Last Emperor" and "Last Tango In
Paris". Bertolucci's latest film, "Besieged" is a work of art if I've
ever seen one.</P>
<P>The film stars Thandie Newton, who was robbed of a much-deserved Oscar
nod for her gritty work in the title role of last year's
underappreciated "Beloved", as Shandurai, a beautiful black woman
working as a maid in the home of lonely pianist Mr. Kinsky (David
Thewlis). Shandurai's husband has been imprisoned for unkown reasons,
and she is learning that Mr.  Kinsky is in love with her.</P>
<P>Shandurai tries to shy away from men since she is married (her only
friend is homosexual), and Mr.  Kinsky doesn't push her. The siege
mentioned in the title is a subtle, emotional one. As the film
progresses, Shandurai feels herself falling into Mr. Kinsky's trap.</P>
<P>There is not much plot to speak of in "Besieged", for it is a collage
of incredible images piled on to one another; each one having
ambiguous meaning. The last scene of the film, however, undercuts the
satisying buildup, and will leave most viewers out in the dark.
"Besieged" is a cold film, but an engrossing one. Bertolucci's
attention to detail creates a vivid motion picture.</P>
<P>But as I left the theatre, I couldn't help but want to know more about
each character's background. Shandurai's dark past is barely hinted
at, and Mr. Kinsky has no story at all. There is such a serious
drought of dialogue in this film, that I'm sure Quentin Tarantino
could have made this entire screenplay into a 5 minute film.</P>
<P>But Bernardo Bertolucci's swift hand and Fabio Cianchetti's lucid
camerawork keep "Besieged" real. The very special thing about this
movie is that I'm sure 10 people could walk out of it with entirely
different opinions of each aspect. If you like films that are
unabashedly artsy, then "Besieged" was made just for you.</P>
