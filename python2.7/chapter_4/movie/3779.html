                       A film review by Shane R. Burridge

<P>     Remember that game you played as a kid, when you tried to walk
across, or around a room without touching the floor; or made it a
mission to get from one place to another without stepping on any part
of a "forbidden" zone?  That primal consciousness is, I believe, what
makes this film so instantly appealing to its fans.</P>
<P>     Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are two jacks of all trades who own a
pickup truck and little else, drifting from one job to another in the
small desert town of Perfection.  Meanwhile, a visiting seismologist is
investigating mysterious disturbances in the ground.  As it transpires,
these are not caused by earthquakes but earthworms, and big ones at
that.  Worse, these worms are predators, which detect their prey by the
vibrations of their footsteps.  It doesn't take long before Bacon,
Ward, and co. figure out what is going on, from which point the story
becomes the struggle for survival that we've seen in countless monster
movies before--with one major twist.  Most movies of this type (THE
THING, THE BIRDS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, et al) invariably hole up
the protagonists in a restricted location, which they defend against
the attacking hordes.  TREMORS turns this on its head: the characters
are not confined by the walls of some makeshift sanctuary, but by the
vast Nevada desert landscape itself, which they can't even set foot
on.  In fact, any contact with the ground is a bad move, so they end up
ON the buildings, not in them.  Most of the second half of the film
involves this assorted handful of characters arguing about their
predicament and hopscotching from one 'safe' zone to the next.</P>
<P>     There is no explanation for the creatures (their origins are
discussed arbitrarily in one brief dialogue exchange) and they seem
smaller-scale country cousins to the sandworms in DUNE (which are also
attracted by vibrations), but the film-makers never make their
creations laughable, or thankfully, their characters
disposable--there's no stock 'bad guy' amongst them for the
scriptwriters to sacrifice to the monsters; and it's fun watching the
can-do approach they take to their bizarre situation.  Film's highlight
for the gun crowd will be the scene in which two survivalist fanatics
unload nearly their entire arsenal into one of the attacking
creatures.  The desert setting, drowsy and stultifying on the surface,
is used to good effect, and Bacon and Ward give effortless performances
that match this to "Perfection."  Snappy pacing and canny writing make
this more than just a B picture.  Film's major problem was trying to
sell the idea of giant earthworms as effective movie monsters. Also
with: Michael Gross (from TV's FAMILY TIES), and Ariana Richards as a
pogo-stick hopping tyke, who'd later graduate from being terrorized by
giant worms to giant dinosaurs in JURASSIC PARK.  Some kids have all
the luck.</P>
