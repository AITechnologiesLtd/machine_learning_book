<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Offering nothing viewers haven't already seen in much superior films
(The Abyss and Alien, for example), DBS does to Jaws what Mulholland
Falls did to Chinatown – dumbs it down, drags it out, and leaves viewers
as unsatisfied as Rosie O'Donnell when the all-you-can-eat buffet closes
down before she's finished.</P>
<P>The film opens with a shot of four teens enjoying a calm night out on
Daddy's boat.  One of the bikinied beauties accidentally kicks a bottle
of red wine over, spilling it into the dark water, which of course
prompts a shark attack.  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Gary
Oldman say that he didn't care for red wine in Bram Stoker's Dracula?
Why would a shark get all riled up about red wine?  Anyway, the kids are
saved at the last second when the shark is harpooned not once, but twice
by Carter Blake (Thomas Jane, The Thin Red Line), who seems to have
appeared out of nowhere.</P>
<P>It turns out that the shark actually escaped from a genetic testing site
where scientists are hoping to create a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
The company funding the project, understandably alarmed by the AWOL
shark and its Friday night assault, gives its leader, Susan McAlester
(Saffron Burrows, Wing Commander), 48 hours to come up with their
antidote and even assigns Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson, Episode
One) to baby-sit the project in its final hours in a last-ditch attempt
to salvage the price of the company's stock on Monday morning.</P>
<P>Once Susan returns to Aquatica, which was formerly a sub refueling
station used in World War II, almost everybody goes home (a skeleton
crew runs the place on weekends), and those that remain ignore the
impending storm that is rapidly approaching their facility.  Damn it –
that's what the Doppler is there for!  At one point, the tower worker
(Aida Turturro) calls Susan up to the surface for an `emergency' that
turns out not to be a warning about a hurricane, but a surprise birthday
party.  Yay!</P>
<P>In addition to Jane's Blake, other characters are the severely wasted
Stellan Skarsgård (Ronin), the severely annoying Michael Rapaport (TV's
Friends), the severely pixie-ish Jacqueline McKenzie (Angel Baby) and
the surprisingly entertaining LL Cool J (Halloween: H2O) as Dudley, the
cook.  You know a film is in trouble when a rap star, and his parrot
sidekick, are the highlights.</P>
<P>Once the group is trapped within the confines of the station, we learn
that Jackson's Franklin is somewhat of an expert in surviving difficult
situations.  Apparently he lived through a killer avalanche while
mountain climbing in the Alps several years back.  Not being too
familiar with the Alzheimer's project, he at one point loudly questions,
`Just what the hell did you do to those sharks?'  Well, Mace Windu, just
who the hell is reading your scripts?  Didn't you learn to stay away
from crappy underwater pictures after Sphere?</P>
<P>DBS is the writing debut from a trio of screenwriters and is directed by
Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight).  The score is provided by Yes'
Trevor Rabin and the special effects are far from dazzling.  Maybe I
just don't find sharks all that frightening.  It's a shark - we know
what they look like.  It's not like Alien or The Abyss.  They even
showed the stupid thing in the trailer, so how scared can you be when
you see it?  Despite one particular scene that made the entire theater
jump and scream, the film is largely a waste.  (1:56 - R for graphically
dumb shark attacks, for language and for Burrows in bra and panties)</P>
