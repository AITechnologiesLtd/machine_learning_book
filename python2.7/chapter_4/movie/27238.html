<PRE>                               TIGERLAND
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<PRE>     As it turns out, war can be hell even if you never leave home.</PRE>
<P>     Joel Schumacher, director of some of the worst films in a
generation (8MM, Batman & Robin, Batman Forever), redeems himself with
his first really good flick since Falling Down in 1993.  A tale of army
recruits in their final days of training before heading to Vietnam in
1971, Tigerland is an original and modestly powerful anti-war film that
never even goes "in country."</P>
<P>     The film revolves around a recruit named Bozz (Colin Farrell,
Croupier) who is trying everything in his power to get out before he's
shipped out.  He refuses to participate in basic training, talks back to
his superiors, and undermines his fellow recruits' gung ho attitudes
with his sly, pacifist talk.  Notably, Bozz's closest friend Paxton
(Matthew Davis, Urban Legends: Final Cut) is looking forward to "the
experience" of serving in 'Nam, unafraid and ready for duty, and while
Paxton's resolve starts to crumble, Bozz finds his inexplicably coming
back around.</P>
<P>     Eschewing the theatrics of his Batman sagas, Schumacher relies on
an understated documentary style, largely using handheld cameras and
seemingly improvised scenarios.  To some extent, this works well,
putting the viewer in the action, headed to Tigerland (the very last
training stop before Vietnam) on the bus along with the platoon.  But on
another level, the whole film feels a little cheap, like Schumacher went
into the woods behind his house with a machete and a Handicam and
figured he could make a movie right there as a weekend project.  As a
result, the picture doesn't look or feel overwhelmingly authentic, and
the connection with the viewer is broken.  (In the end, it's apparent
the film has been shot the way it was simply for budget considerations,
which was reportedly less than $10 million.)</P>
<P>     Farrell in particular is a standout among the virtually all-male
cast, though he doesn't shine bright enough to outdo some of 2000's
virtuoso performances like Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  The ensemble as a
whole is smashing, and the story as written by Ross Klavan and Michael
McGruther is a standout among this year's lackluster scripts.  Too bad
the film couldn't have kept the energy level on an even keel throughout
the production, but hey, wars -- and movies -- are hell.</P>
