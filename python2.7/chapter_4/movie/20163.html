<P>IN SHORT: Teen dateflick. Not Scream-type horror but fairly enjoyable.</P>
<P>Cranky has found himself making references to his film school
screenwriting teacher in several of the reviews he's composed this week.
So, since it's appropriate to the subject at hand, let us now recall our
first efforts at screenplay writing, the stuff we hold near and dear to
our hearts. A television producer friend, under the guise of making the
move to the big screen, exercised his energy on a bad story that
exorcized the demons of his divorce and the painful process of returning
to dating hell as a nigh on middle aged guy. Cranky spent four years
novelizing the events of the accident that created him (an easier read
on the <a href="www.crankycritic.com/history.html">history pages</a>).
Kevin Williamson took aim at a teacher he once had who advised the
future creator of Scream and Dawson's Creek that he had no foreseeable
future as a writer. It is that first, and previously unproduced, effort
that Williamson has resurrected as his directorial debut, Teaching Mrs.
Tingle. For some reason, the humiliated student in the movie is female.
We'll chalk that up to "keeping a distance from the subject".</P>
<P>The pre-release Internet buzz on this one was so bad, it was hard to
lock out. The teenboys over at AICN are way off the mark in their disses
about Teaching Mrs. Tingle for the very simple reason (I'm guessing
here) that they were expecting another Scream or I Know What You Did
Last Summer or The Faculty, in short, Williamson's usual thriller and/or
scareflick. Teaching Mrs. Tingle is a different animal. It is a
psychological battle between teacher and student, less about criminal
acts and more about mental control. It is not a bad flick.</P>
<P>Leigh Ann Watson (Katie Holmes) comes from a single-mom-with-two-jobs
household (Lesley Ann Warren plays mom). Leigh's a great student, she
needs to land the valedictory position to get a college scholarship. In
her way is Trudy (Liz Stauber), a rich kid and history teacher Mrs.
Tingle (Helen Mirren), a mean, nasty, tight assed witch of a teacher who
scares, humiliates and gently blackmails students and school
administrators with verve and skill. Rounding off the principal cast are
Leigh's best friend Jo Lynn (Marisa Coughlan), who has the hots for
second generation slacker Luke (Barry Watson). Luke prefers Leigh but
had his chance, blew it, and knows it. Thinking it would help Leigh land
the number one slot, Luke gets his hands on a copy of Tingle's final
exam and offers it to Leigh and Jo Lynn. Leigh turns it down, but Tingle
catches 'em in the act. Drop the curtain. Close the show. Leigh's life
is over.</P>
<P>That night, the three go to Tingle's house to plead their case; to
convince Tingle that Leigh is as innocent as the Salem Witch profiled in
her final. Tingle won't hear any of it, but Luke magically produces a
crossbow and Tingle is bound to a bed until the kidlets can figure out
what to do.</P>
<P>Talk about tight . . . Tied to the bed for a day the old lady never has
to go to the bathroom. That's control!</P>
<P>And that's really all I need to tell you. From this point on the film
pits Tingle versus Leigh versus Jo Lynn as the teacher spins verbal
spider webs around her inexperienced students. This is also where the
supporting actors add little comic nuggets to the story: Molly Ringwald
(and can you think of anyone better to be cast in a high school flick?)
as the substitute who covers Tingle's classes; Vivica A. Fox as the
sympathetic guidance counselor; Michael McKean as the principal and
Jeffrey Tambor as the Coach, whose secret is so titillating that the
kidlets at the screening I attended were guffawing.</P>
<P>For his first time in the director's chair Williamson does a good job.
There were a couple of visual continuity errors I caught and I'd have to
take another look to see if that crossbow really did "magically" appear
but, all in all, this was a good popcorn flick. The kidlets were happy
and they're the ones buying the tickets to this one.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Teaching Mrs. Tingle, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$3.00</PRE>
<P>Rental for this old fogey. $5 dateflick level for the teens.</P>
