Based on the novel "The Hunter" by Donald E. Westlake
Screenplay by Brian Helgeland & Terry Hayes
Produced by Bruce Davey    Directed by Brian Helgeland</P>
<P>"We made a deal: if she'd stop hooking, I'd stop shooting people. I guess
we were both aiming a little high."</P>
<P>That ending bit of narration sums up the problems of Brian Helgeland's
directorial debut "Payback". In attempting to make an audience friendly
version of Donald Westlake's hard hitting crime novel 'The Hunter'; the
filmmakers have replaced the amoral atmosphere of the story and replaced it
with a quick series of quips and one liners. The end result is a very
brutal and strangely enjoyable film, but one that raises interesting
questions.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson plays Porter a small time hood who we meet as he is having
several bullets removed from his back  by a back alley doctor. In flashback
we learn that Porter and his partner, Val (Gregg Henry) steal $140 from a
Chinese gangster. Getting away with the money, Porter is doublecrossed by
Lynn (Deborah Unger), his wife and Val. As Porter lies bleeding from his
gunshot wounds, Val drops a photograph on Porter, revealing the hood with a
high priced call girl, Rosie (Maria Bello) he was employed by as a driver.</P>
<P>Porter is now on a mission, and that mission is not revenge. He simply is
out to get what is his. What he earned. $70 thousand dollars. And no one is
going to stop him from getting it. After healing his wounds, Porter finds
his ex-wife (widow), Lynn in a flea bag apartment. Strung out on heroin,
Lynn is returning home with her fix, when Porter surprises her from inside.
He violently assaults her, angry at the betrayal but more so with her
addiction. He forces Lynn to lay with him as she suffers the beginning of
withdrawals.
Unfortunately, as Porter sleeps, Lynn manages to get to her fix. When
Porter wakens, he finds Lynn dead from an overdose, the syringe still
imbedded in her artery.</P>
<P>Having gotten some information from Lynn, Porter goes off to find Val. His
source is Stegman (David Paymer), a mousy bookie. Stegman, happens to be
working with two of Chicago's not so finest cops, Detective Hicks and Leary
(Bill Duke and Jack Conley respectively) who determine that Porter must be
in for a big score and decide to cut themselves in on the deal. Add to this
mix, the reappearance of the Chinese hoods who were the victims of the
original heist, and the deck is increasingly stacked against Porter.
Until, that is, he is reacquainted with Rosie (Maria Bello).</P>
<P>"Payback" is an extremely ugly film. There is not one character that is
redeemable. Everyone in this film connives, cheats, kills, tortures and
maims anyone who would get in the way of their money. While this character
trait is base at best, the writers of the script try to humanize these
figures by giving them humorous asides and quick little one liners. It
doesn't work. While the film has humorous moments (this could be the
blackest comedy of all time were it not so imaginatively bright), there is
not one believable character in the film. The story is constructed with a
heavy reliance on a voice over narration in the person of Porter. In some
cases the narration is current, emphasizing a current thought or feeling,
others are spoken in a past tense which leads one to believe that the film
is being told in hindsight. This is one of the many problems with the film,
in that it's hard to feel empathy and suspense for the character when he is
telling you what he is going to do or what his mindset is, before he acts.</P>
<P>First time Director Brian Helgeland, does a very good job of handling this
morale of Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler. The basis for the story was
the marvelous  tome, "The Hunter" by Donald E. Westlake, which was filmed
once before as "Point Blank" (1967) with Lee Marvin in the title role. A
comparison of the two films is rather mote at this point, since both films
detail certain morays and cultural identities of their era. What Director
Helgeland is able to do with this current version is make a hip, jovial and
frightening violent portrait of American society collapsing onto itself in
a vile heap of easy money. At this level, "Payback" works as a lurid
magnifying glass. These characters care less about each other than what
they have. Possession is everything. This is pointed out most strongly in a
stomach churning scene of torture, in which Mel Gibson's character has his
toes crushed one by one with a  hammer until he reveals the location of a
kidnap victim. He lies! His health, his well-being is never so important as
his money.</P>
<P>Gibson's performance is topnotch as usual. In what may be the flip side of
his 'Lethal Weapons' character of Riggs, Porter has no affinity for anyone.
In one marvelously constructed scene, Porter asks Rosie why she didn't
leave with him the night they discovered they were in love with one
another. She replies, 'why didn't you take me'?  It shows that these
characters are so immersed in their own guilt and longing that they can
never express they're true feelings or, better yet come to grips with them.</P>
<P>The female leads are fine but are not called upon to do much. To that
extent Deborah Unger fairs the best, having the showier role as Porter's
estranged wife. Her portrayal for a woman at the end of hope is painful to
watch. When Porter comes to get information from her, she asks "Are you
going to kill me?" When Porter replies 'No', she is heartbroken, knowing
that her only salvation is to take her own life.</P>
<P>The standout performance is by Lucy Alexis Liu as the sadistic prostitute,
Pearl. Having developed a reputation for comic timing on the television
series "Ally McBeal", Ms. Liu pulls out all the stops in what may be the
most outrageous performance of the year. Her natural sexiness and comedic
ability raise her scenes to a level that the rest of the film fails to live
up to.</P>
<P>The cinematography by Ericson Core is marvelously conceived and staged.
This is one of the first films is quite a while that actually takes full
advantage of the wide screen. There are scenes, stage in such a way that
both extreme ends of the frame are used. This is going to be one film that
will not translate well to video without the aid of letterboxing.
One side note.. I must make a comment here about the conditions in which I
witnessed the film. On opening night at a local AMC theater. The print was
not in good shape. The color for the first two reels (approx. 40 mins.) was
uniformly dull, with muted color. Also the print developed a slight
greenish tint, almost eliminating any solid red or warm colors.
Furthermore, the print exhibited a problematic focus shift on the right
edge of the screen, where everything went out of focus. And lastly, the
print exhibited several instances of water damage. These showed themselves
as faint, dark horizontal lines that would run down the frame during a
scene. Needless to say, a refund was forthcoming.</P>
<P>But, that aside. What is the final determination of  "Payback". For my
taste, an interesting misfire. This is a film that could have been a
marvelous send up of the crime genre. As it is, it is a nice programmer.
But with a real moral compass to guide it. The film ultimately fails to
achieve its end. And that is, to entertain.</P>
<P>On a scale of 1 to 5, Payback rates 2.
(rated R for sexual situations, profanity, and extreme violence)
