<PRE>                               GIRLFIGHT
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Enjoyed Stand and Deliver?  Well get ready to stand and deliver...
an uppercut to the jaw!  And are you prepared for a girl to come out
fighting and go toe to toe with a man?  Can this be?  Women's boxing? 
Let's get ready to rumble!</P>
<P>     Ahem.  Girlfight would have you believe the rather commonplace
sport of women's boxing was a freakish thing, barely known in the real
world.  Never mind that women occasionally fight on the undercard for
heavyweight title bouts.  And never mind that boxing mini-stars like Mia
St. John have graced the cover of Playboy.  No, female boxing can't be
real, despite three international federations devoted to the sport.</P>
<P>     But put all that aside for a moment.  What we're here for is what
all good boxing movies have to give: that Rocky feeling.  We want a
story about a hard-luck champ trying to pull himself (er, or herself) up
and out of the slums with nothing more than guts and spit.  Star
Michelle Rodriguez has plenty of both, imbuing her troubled Brooklyn
teen Diana with enough bullish spirit to dub her an instant, um,
Rockette.</P>
<P>     Sadly, the bulk of Girlfight is heavy on the girl, light on the
fight.  It takes 30-plus minutes before Diana ever laces up a pair of
gloves, not to mention the considerable wringing of hands over Diana's
poor school attitude, her relationship to her father (Paul Calderon),
and a strained yet totally expected romance with rising amateur boxer
Adrian (hmmmm...), played unevenly by Santiago Douglas.  Fortunately,
Rodriguez is such a scrappy charmer, she carries this picture entirely
on her muscled shoulders, and I'd be remiss not to say she deserves
early Oscar consideration.  Get her moving and she's a powerhouse, and
the film flows with her.</P>
<P>     The rest of the picture is not so fortunate.  While Diana's trainer
Hector (Jaime Tirelli) performs admirably in his trainer role as the
analogue of Rocky's Paulie, initially skeptical that a woman could fight
but eventually pushing her to heights, the remainder of the cast feels
plucked from, well, Brooklyn.  This lends the picture some needed street
cred (with Pulp Fiction bit player Calderon the only recognizable face
in the cast).  But it's way too much, as the overall production suffers
from an utter lack of competence in the editing department (no surprise:
Plummy Tucker, a self-indulgent John Sayles collaborator, is responsible
for the mess) and off-kilter photography that misses a lot more of the
action than it captures.</P>
<P>     However, easily the biggest problem with Girlfight is its length. 
At nearly two hours, the film is -- quite literally -- twice as long as
it should have been.  For comparison's sake, that's about four
full-length boxing matches.  Do the math.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Theodore Shapiro's frantic piano score does a lot to
assuage the damage, livening up the atmosphere considerably despite the
pace.  The movie also manages to float (like a butterfly) around the
theme of boxing as the only way out of the hood for a lot of its
denizens, though it never quite drives home the desperation of its
characters, none of whom seem to have many genuine problems.</P>
<P>     Girlfight is not a bad time, to be sure, but I have to say I was
expecting something else.  Oh well.  It coulda been a contender.</P>
