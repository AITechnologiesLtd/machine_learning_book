<P>     Over the past few years, there have been a number of "behind the 
scenes" movies about the film making world -- enough, in fact, that this 
category almost deserves to be considered as a genre in its own right.  
Most of these films, like MISTRESS, are forgettable.  A select few, such 
as MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND, have risen to the top, largely because of 
their ability to mix humor with pseudo-realistic events.  The arrival of 
Tom DiCillo's LIVING IN OBLIVION proves that the well has not yet run 
dry.  This movie is keen, clever, and -- most important of all -- a 
nonstop exercise in hilarity.   </P>
<P>     LIVING IN OBLIVION details one day in the life of director Nick 
Reve (Steve Buscemi), who is trying to put together an independent film 
on a shoestring budget.  This particular morning, he's due to shoot 
scene six.  Little does he know that Murphy's Law is in full force.  
Nightmares -- real, figurative, and cinematic -- will plague the 
production, and what eventually emerges will be nothing like what anyone 
envisioned. </P>
<P>     Reve's leading lady, Nicole (played by a shining Catherine Keener, 
who was in DiCillo's previous movie, JOHNNY SUEDE), is fraught with 
angst about her career choice.  Does she belong in front of the camera 
or behind the counter at some greasy dive?  The male lead, a stuck-up 
star by the name of Chad Palomino (James LeGros), has no worries about 
his ability.  With an ego too big for the tiny set, Chad spends most of 
his time complaining to Reve and flashing smiles at the assistant 
director (Danielle Von Zerneck) and script girl (Hilary Gilford).  The 
cinematographer (Dermot Mulroney, Keener's real-life husband), an eye-
patched character who looks like Rambo but has the emotional sensitivity 
of Alan Alda, rarely lets a take go by without arguing the choice of 
shot. </P>
<P>     The mishaps of scene six provide ninety minutes of unbridled fun.  
There are missed shots, booms in frame, exploding smoke machines, actors 
with bad breath, a vomiting camera operator, a senile mother on the set, 
and an irate dwarf in a red room (an obvious poke at David Lynch and 
TWIN PEAKS).  Life imitates art, art imitates life imitating art, and 
all this happens in switches from black-and-white to color.  </P>
<P>     Often, the best comedies are blatantly stupid.  In this case, 
however, we are presented with an intelligent and occasionally 
insightful screenplay.  Not only are several real-life incidents from 
DiCillo's private stock of failures and frustrations represented, but 
the director isn't afraid to let fly with satirical barbs at just about 
any target, named or unnamed.  Amidst all the humor is an opportunity to 
learn a little about the difficulties of creating an independent feature 
-- a process far less glamorous that some might believe it to be.  
LIVING IN OBLIVION is wonderfully photographed, with the color-to-black-
and-white transitions handled smoothly (these aren't just an "art 
device" -- there's a legitimate reason for them), and several different 
film stocks in evidence.  DiCillo has crafted a near-masterpiece that 
may make more than a few best-ten lists at year's end. </P>
<P>     LIVING IN OBLIVION is packed with laughs and twists, and comes to 
an end far too soon.  It's rare that a movie rolls the credits too 
early, but when this film fades to black, we're still longing for at 
least one more scene with Reve, his cast, and crew.  While it's true 
that we don't get much sense of these people off the set, they're so 
wonderful in and around the camera that it doesn't matter.  Best of all, 
LIVING IN OBLIVION doesn't demand that the viewer be a film buff -- just 
that he or she enjoys laughing. </P>
