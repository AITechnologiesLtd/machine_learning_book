<PRE>The Replacements
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>I wish I could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion
of a sports film.  I bet it was some hotshot Warner Brothers agent with
an dark Armani suit and manicured fingernails saying, "It would be a
very light comedic version of Any Given Sunday, and we could throw in
the Hoosiers angle with the casting of Gene Hackman as the tough but
determined coach.  Throw in that hunk of a guy Keanu Reeves and a cast
of wacky characters and poof!  We'll have a hit on our hands!"</P>
<P>The Replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film, a mishmash
collage of one-dimensional characters, rampant stereotypes of cultures
and races, cliched emotional statements of purpose, and Keanu Reeves
wishing for The Matrix sequel to start principal photography.  The story
is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a
rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of
professional play for a variety of teams with names like the Washington
Sentinels.  Keanu Reeves stars as Shane Falco, a has-been football
college player looking for redemption.  Gene Hackman dons a fedora like
Tom Landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in Hoosiers.</P>
<P>Rounding out the cast includes Swingers' Jon Favreau, 7-Up pitchman
Orlando Jones, gruff owner Jack Warden, and cast of wacky and unknown
actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped
characters: the drunken Welshman, the overweight Sumo wrestler, the
black convict, the violent cop, and the dumb, dumb cheerleaders.</P>
<P>This bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the
team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays, Gene
Hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell Dennis Hopper is,
Keanu Reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the
football field, and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making
the girls from Coyote Ugly look like waitresses from Denny's.</P>
<P>The usual things happen like clockwork.  The hero rises from the ashes
of failure, the team comes together in unity, the hero falls in love
with a conventional love interest, the football games are won with
enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and
clap, and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night
movies on Cinemax.</P>
<P>It's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their
belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks.  Howard Deutch,
who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - Pretty in
Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful, has since been doing Grumpier Old Men
and Caroline in the City episodes.  Obviously the problem is that
without a good script, any director will fail in the end.</P>
<P>Sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory, gritty tales
involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the
ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds, the rise
and fall of gallant heroes, and stories of dramatic gusto painted with
blood and sweat on the battlefield of life.</P>
<P>The Replacements offers none of this.</P>
