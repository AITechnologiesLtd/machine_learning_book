<PRE>Trixie
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 fimcritic.com</PRE>
<P>It's a damn shame when a bad movie happens to a great actor.  It's even
worse when you try to enjoy their performance in the film while being
distracted by a terrible wasteland of a script.  Such is the sad case of
Alan Rudolph's latest "screwball noir" farce, Trixie, a misguided
attempt at expanding the noir genre by giving it a comedic twist.</P>
<P>Everything seemed to be in place to make a good film out of Trixie,
starting with a great cast of Nick Nolte, Will Patton, Dermot Mulrooney,
newcomer Brittany Murphy, Nathan Lane, and the wonderfully versatile
actress Emily Watson.  The story follows a misunderstood girl named
Trixie, who has an annoying habit of mixing up her metaphors - with such
memorable lines as "life is no bed of gravy" and "it's like looking
through a needle for hay."  Trixie holds dead-end jobs as a security
guard for low-rent department stores but yearns for something better in
her life.  Don't we all.  Eventually she takes a job at a casino resort
as an undercover cop and gets involved in a tangled mess of a political
sex scandal/murder mystery.  Don't you just hate when that happens?!</P>
<P>A slew of characters that seem drawn from the well of mediocrity and
melodrama entertain and challenge Trixie as she searches for the truth
in a sea of misplaced plot points.  Nathan Lane hams it up as a
washed-up lounge singer, Will Patton growls through lines as a corrupt
businessman, Dermot Mulroney tries to act sincere as a knucklehead of a
ladies man, Lesley Ann Warren is just plain annoying as a sex tart, and
Nick Nolte is a politician playing… Nick Nolte.</P>
<P>The one bright light in the film is Watson, proving she can go from a
depressed Irish mother of a million kids in last year's Angela's Ashes
to a wisecracking working class Chicago chick who knows how to hold her
own.  The film starts off with a bang by giving the audience a strange
look at Trixie's life and the way she interacts with the things and
people around her.  It seems she strives to remain true to her beliefs
and her actions despite her failure at communicating with others.</P>
<P>Director Alan Rudolph speaks of this film as an examination of
communication and how people interact with one another, yet never seem
to understand each other completely.  The main problem is that he never
succeeds in delivering an interesting product for review.  The first
half-hour is solid and moves with purpose.  The last hour and half
simply sink under the movie's, and Rudolph's, pretentious voice.</P>
