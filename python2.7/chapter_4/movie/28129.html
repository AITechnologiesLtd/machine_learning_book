<P>PLOT:
George Jung is your typical middle-class kid from Massachusetts.
Unfortunately, he's got a bitchy mom but a nice dad. As a child, he
witnesses his father's struggles to make ends meet and grows up wanting more
out of his own life. As an adult, George generates so much cash at some
point, that his biggest problem becomes finding a place to store it all. How
does George go from being a lil' tike with a cool dad to one of the biggest
drug-runners in the United States during the late 70s, early 80s? True
story. Find out by watching the movie.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Is this movie original? No, not really. Does this movie still give us a
great story, an intriguing lead character, an amazing soundtrack, plenty of
style, many a touching moment and an altogether fascinating cinematic
journey? Oh, definitely! "Ever since I can remember, I always wanted to be a
gangster!" is the quote that starts off one of my favorite movies of
all-time: GOODFELLAS. Now it goes without saying that this film will
unavoidably be compared to that film, SCARFACE, BOOGIE NIGHTS and many other
epic life-stories of little so-and-so's making it to the "big time". But
unlike most of those wise guys, here's a film in which the lead character
doesn't really want to be a gangster, but one circumstance leads to another
circumstance and the next thing you know, he's meeting with Pablo Escobar,
the biggest drug lord in the world. A very interesting journey, to say the
least. Here's a movie that gives you another intriguing story of a "regular
guy" who ends up in extra-ordinary circumstances, and with a little bit of
street-smarts, a little bit of charm and a lotta balls, makes something out
of himself. Mind you, I personally have always been fascinated with the
biographies of famous people, so maybe this story won't grab you as much as
it did me. But the actors are also all very good in this film, the high
style in perfect alignment with the previously mentioned flicks and plenty
of drama, bits of humor, betrayals and double-crossings (natch!).</P>
<P>Another thing that sets this flick apart from the previously mentioned
movies is its personal connections which are highlighted to us through its
lead character. A very deep father/son relationship is explored here and so
is the lead's love for his daughter, which keeps him going through some of
the tougher times (having recently had a baby girl himself, I could see how
Depp could relate more to this character). Ultimately, you will either be
interested in this man's story or not, and I for one, was quite absorbed and
entertained. The detailed progression of his beginnings, his rise and his
eventual downfall (I don't think I'm giving anything away here) are well
paced and convincingly strung together, with lotsa flair via the director's
eye, a groovy soundtrack, some entertaining side characters and a very
poignant ending. I don't think you should go into this movie expecting to
see something entirely different from the films mentioned above, because
they do ultimately resemble each other quite a bit in style, pace and
general undertone. But the personalities, the struggles and the personal
story behind this one is on a fresher tip, and it certainly grabbed me and
took me along for quite the ride. The word "epic" was made for this movie.
Kudos to Ted Demme for taking the material and turning into an entertaining
and touching vehicle, and to Johnny Depp for keeping me glued to the screen
with yet another solid performance. Although I do wish he hadn't worn his
sunglasses so much, since it didn't allow for the viewer to get into his
character's eyes. But alas...</P>
<P>PS: You also shouldn't expect to see much of Cruz or Reubens, who appear to
be billed much greater than their characters' respective appearances in the
film.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about the movie and its stars:
This movie is based on the Bruce Porter book called "Blow: How a small-town
boy made $100 million with the Medellin cartel and lost it all".
When the film first started casting, actors John Leguizamo and James
Gandolfini were in talks to play Depp's good friend in the movie and his
dad, respectively. The roles eventually went to Jordi Molla and Ray Liotta.
>From where do you know the screenwriters of this movie? Well, David McKenna
is the man who wrote AMERICAN HISTORY X (9/10) and co-wrote GET CARTER,
while Nick Cassavetes is the son of the famous writer/director John
Cassavetes, who himself also had a role as one of the bad guys in John Woo's
FACE/OFF. He also co-starred with Johnny Depp in THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE
(4/10).
One of Depp's earlier girlfriends in the movie is played by German actress
Franka Potente, who you will undoubtedly remember as the lead from RUN LOLA
RUN.
One of the producers on this project is none other than actor/comedian Denis
Leary. Director Ted Demme has directed a couple of Leary's TV specials,
"Lock N Load" and 1992's "No Cure for Cancer", and two films starring the
funnyman, MONUMENT AVENUE (aka SNITCH) and THE REF. Leary also hails from
the same state as the film's lead character George Jung: Massachusetts.
And yes, for anyone who's still asking, director Ted Demme is in fact the
real-life nephew of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS director Jonathan Demme.</P>
