<P>     A moment of mild understatement:  people of Christian faith haven't
fared well in film.  When Hollywood was still afraid to offend, Christian
characters were flawless, salt-of-the-earth folks; later, as cinematic
taboos vanished through the 60s and 70s, religion became a sure sign of
either mental illness or hypocrisy.  Improbably extremes ruled, with few
film-makers bothering to delve into the complex middle ground occupied by
millions of Americans:  flawed human beings who are nevertheless
completely sincere and devoted to their faith.</P>
<P>     Pentecostal minister Euliss F. "Sonny" Dewey, the title character in
THE APOSTLE, may be the most wonderfully complex Christian character ever
depicted on film, and every ounce of credit for that creation goes to
Robert Duvall.  Duvall wrote, directed and stars as Sonny, a man with an
unfailing passion for his calling as a preacher.  Unfortunately he also
has an unfailing passion for women, leading his wife Jessie (Farrah
Fawcett) to throw him out of the house and engineer his ouster from his
church.  The short-tempered Sonny responds by taking a baseball bat to the
head of Jessie's new lover, then quickly taking it on the lam from his
home in Texas to Bayou Boutte, Louisiana.  There he re-christens himself
"The Apostle E. F.," dedicating himself to beginning a new ministry in his
new home.</P>
<P>     Duvall works wonders with Sonny, depicting every possible facet of
this complicated man's personality.  An early scene, in which Sonny stops
at the scene of an automobile accident to guide a critically injured young
man to salvation, depicts the single-minded, necessarily arrogant
conviction of the evangelist that everyone needs "saving" (as well as the
accompanying prideful glee when he succeeds).  Sonny's belief that his
work as a preacher supercedes all other obligations unifies every action,
from his rationalization of his infidelities to his decision to run from
the law.  Duvall even touches humorously on the reaction of others to
Sonny's fervor -- one man who offers Sonny hospitality also sleeps warily
with a shotgun by his side.</P>
<P>     If there's one major stumbling block in THE APOSTLE, it is that the
other characters in the film exist entirely to react to Sonny.  While the
performances are uniformly strong and naturalistic, the supporting players
rarely seem to have lives of their own.  From Jessie, to the young
mechanic (Walter Goggins) who becomes Sonny's close friend, to a racist
troublemaker (Billy Bob Thornton), all serve as spectators or functional
props in the story of Sonny's redemption.  Duvall commits so much energy
to making this one character completely real that he has little left to
spend on anyone else.</P>
<P>     You may not end up minding all that much, since that one character
becomes so fascinating.  Duvall has long been one of America's finest
actors, but this is the kind of role into which he disappears most
completely -- slightly roguish but unmistakably human souls like his roles
in TENDER MERCIES and LONESOME DOVE.  When Sonny gives his final sermon in
THE APOSTLE, in a sequence which lingers and builds in intensity, you
realize exactly what Duvall is aiming at.  It is possible for a man who is
quick-tempered, stubborn and unfaithful to his wife to change lives for
the better; it doesn't take a saint to be a good Christian.  Ultimately,
THE APOSTLE is a strange sort of character study, because Sonny doesn't
really change all that much.  Like most well-intentioned by imperfect
people, he just keeps trying to be better.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 preacher features:  8.</PRE>
