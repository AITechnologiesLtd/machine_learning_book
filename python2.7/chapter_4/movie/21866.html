<P>James Bond flicks are among my un-guilty pleasures. They include not 
only the Sean Connery vehicles but also the oft-maligned Roger 
Moores, Timothy Daltons and the underrated George Lazenby in " On Her 
Majesty's Secret Service."  Pierce Brosnan I could take or leave. His 
are not Pierce-Arrows among Bonds. But the latest one, "The World is 
Not Enough," is a pain.</P>
<P>It also pains me to be negative about director Michael Apted's first 
(I think) action-action pic, when Apted has several  excellent or at 
least solid works: "Triple Echo," "Agatha," "Coal  Miner's Daughter," 
"Gorky Park," ," "Gorillas in the Mist," Class Action," "Incident at 
Oglala," "Thunderheart," "Nell."</P>
<P>Better yet, he is the maker of the documentary "Seven Up" (1964) 
which follows a number of kids in the UK. Its artistic/sociological 
success made Apted follow it up with the same subjects seven years 
later (in "Seven Plus Seven"), then in "21 Up," "28 Up," "35 Up." Now 
being released in the U.S.A is "42 Up." The first reports are most 
positive.</P>
<P>Should James Bond henceforth be called James Moribund?  The latest 
entry relies exclusively on derring-do, much of it borrowed from 
earlier Bonds. Enough is enough, especially when the plot, such as it 
is, consists of a collage of sequences which not only scream "deja 
vu," but are by and large uninteresting and characterless -- as are 
most of the characters in the story.</P>
<P>  "The World is Not Enough" (an awkward  title that signifies nothing) 
floats on a sea of excesses, without any of the novelty, humor and 
amusing sophistication of many earlier Bonds. It opens in a promising 
locale, Bilbao in Spain, yet the sequence's heroics feel pasted on. 
It gets worse in London, with a dumb chase and duel of hydrofoils on 
the Thames, capped by a balloon. It is all SFX (special effects) and 
nothing else. Then come the credits which -- as in an omen -- specify 
that the title song is performed by Garbage.</P>
<P>Bond goes to Baku in Azerbaijan, then to Kazakhstan, then to the 
Caspian Sea, then to Istanbul --and perhaps other places ending in 
"stan" for his exploits. His original assignment is to protect 
Elektra, the daughter of an assassinated oil tycoon, against a 
terrorist called Renard. That word means "fox" in French, but Renard 
is a dull, un-foxy villain. His distinction: he has a bullet in his 
head. It makes him immune to pain. But we, the audience, have no such 
immunity against boredom.</P>
<P>Mourning does become Elektra, since she has chic outfits in the most 
impossible locations. As played by Sophie Marceau, a very popular 
star in France but no true performer, Elektra bored me. Even when she 
turned out to be a nasty little number and not a true victim. There 
is sex, of course, with Bond. It is the sort of thing that in keeping 
with our new ethos (hypocritical or not) plays down sensuality, 
nudity, flesh-photography and groans. It is a dutiful acknowledgment 
of the old Bond-as-womanizer thing, here sanitized and clearly used 
as a filler.</P>
<P>A second woman is introduced, Doctor (sic) Christmas Jones, who is a 
scientist, joins forces with Bond, also bodies -- another filler. 
Denise Richards, another one of the USA's fifty million "celebrities" 
looks and sounds like a Valley Girl, even though she was born in 
Illinois.</P>
<P>When Bond meets her, he's supposed to be Russian and speaks Russian 
to her and others, but somehow it is English., then it becomes "real" 
English.  Don't ask. Says Dr. Christmas :"Your English is very good 
for a Russian" He: "I studied at Oxford." Should I comment?</P>
<P>  Bond wears designer suits no matter what the situation, place, feats 
and explosions are. He also has special see-through eyeglasses to 
peer at hidden weapons on men and undies on women. By the way, when 
it comes to pulchritude, there are quite a few beautiful women 
glimpsed here and there, but these do not include the lead roles.</P>
<P>There are torture scenes in the film, but the real torture is 
watching it. Not simply during its full 128 minutes, but from minute 
5 to the end. A teen sitting in front of me at the rather sparsely 
attended projection (it was a morning show) got up four times to get 
to the theater's concession. If this doesn't speak loudly what does? 
Indeed, there is no continuity, no suspense, nothing that an absentee 
viewer could miss. Nor is there any  "sophistication," which is 
outrageous but funny in the better Bonds. Psychology rates zero,</P>
<P>As for acting -- what acting?  As for humor, just a feeble and leaden 
attempt to sketch in John Cleese as the M.I. 6 new gadget-maker. As 
for novelties, the main one has Bond having a broken collar-bone, 
wincing at times but still able to do his thing. We've gone from the 
impossible to the supernatural, I guess.</P>
<P>The movie, which went through a slew of working titles, officially 
has three writers. Obviously though, it had everybody else and his 
sister pitching in with "ideas." It all results in no sense nonsense, 
it all has no oomph, rhythm or continuity, it all proves again the 
saying that "a camel is a horse made by a committee." The ratio 
between cost and "quality" must make this as bad an action flick as 
any.</P>
<P>It is painfully clear that the movie (like too many others) is aiming 
at a pre-teen, teen, and early post-teen market of kids who have no 
familiarity (at least on the big screen) with the rich Bond tradition.</P>
<P>Why do I still give it one star then? Because I have a soft spot for 
Apted (critics are human after all); because the gimmick of oil and 
pipelines has a real model these days; because Robbie Coltrane, as a 
big Russian Mafioso, saves whatever scenes he is in.</P>
<PRE>The last words after the end-credits say JAMES BOND WILL RETURN.
Oh, no!!!</PRE>
