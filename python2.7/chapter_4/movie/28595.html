<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A joyous W.C. Fields homage to the travelling vaudeville troupes during
the end of the 19th century. It's a different version from the silent
screen one that bombed, as here Fields is allowed to ad lib and do his
thing. The director is the infamous William Beaudine, who was known for
taking only "one take" when shooting.</P>
<P>W.C. Fields plays the Great McGonigle, the egotistical, windbag manager
of a theatrical troupe that hasn't been paid by him and distinguishes
itself by sneaking out of boarding houses undetected without paying, and
by avoiding the sheriffs who come to hunt them down.</P>
<P>The Great McGonigle flees from a sheriff with a court order for him to
pay his bills; he and his theater company go by train and head for the
small town in Ohio called Bellefontaine, where he is scheduled to
perform a melodrama called The Drunkard. He uses the hospitality of the
wealthy widow Cleopatra Pepperday (Jan Duggan) to avoid the show being
closed by sheriffs from all over the country who serve him court orders
for payment's due, as she is willing to pay his debts and only wishes
for a part in his play. He uses her as a foil for his comic antics and
whittles her promised juicy part in the play down to one line, and even
that is up in the air.</P>
<P>The funniest scene is when McGonigle dines with the widow and her young
son Albert (Baby Le Roy). The kid tweaks McGonigle's big red nose, drops
his watch in a jar of molasses, throws food in his face, and gets the
better of McGonigle in all their confrontations.</P>
<P>There's a bland romance between McGonigle's nice daughter, Betty (Judith
Allen), who is the star performer in the show, and rich college boy,
runaway, Wally Livingston (Joe Morrison), who's in love with Betty and
follows her wherever she goes.</P>
<P>McGonigle's manager, Gump (Tammany Young), has the distinction of
catering to all his boss's needs; such as, helping him dress, packing
the bags when they skip town, and going along with all of McGonigle's
chicanery.</P>
<P>Fields is in fine comic form here, even doing a ridiculous juggling act
with a cigar-box. The comedy all revolves around his financial woes, and
is funny in an old-fashioned way.</P>
