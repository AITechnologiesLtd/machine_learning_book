<P>_Being_John_Malkovich_ (R) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>There has never been anything quite like _Being_John_Malkovich_, and
there likely never will be again.  No imitator--a number of which the
film is sure to inspire--could ever capture the clever, surreal dementia
of this "comic fantasia" written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by music
video wunderkind Spike Jonze.  It begins on a somewhat offbeat but
deceptively normal-seeming note: unemployed New York puppeteer Craig
Schwartz (John Cusack) takes a job with a filing company and becomes
infatuated with Maxine (Catherine Keener), who works at a neighboring
company on the 7 1/2 floor (don't ask) even though he is married to dowdy
pet store worker Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  Then comes the absurd wrinkle to
the tale: one day at work Craig stumbles onto a secret tunnel that
leads... into the mind of actor John Malkovich (who plays himself).</P>
<P>Rarely does one ever get to see with one original twist, let alone the
wild and completely unpredictable entirety of _Being_John_Malkovich_; the
portal conceit is merely the jumping-off point for an exploration of
celebrity, identity, sexuality, and other issues that is never less than
imaginative--not to mention insanely funny and consistently surprising. 
Kaufman's giddily complex script and Jonze's adept direction never hits a
false note; even the most outrageous hairpin twist feels like a logical
development. Deftly handling the demanding material and giving it a
certain something more is the amazing cast; Cusack, Diaz, and Keener are
not only funny, but they lend a real pathos to their characters that
lends some genuine emotional involvement to the story.  Best of all,
though, is Malkovich, absolutely hilarious and the epitome of a good
sport as the bewildered man whose head becomes a metaphysical amusement
park for others.  A work of stunning originality, _Being_John_Malkovich_
is an amusement park thrill ride in itself, constantly twisting and
turning its audience in new and unforeseen directions--but unlike the
case with most roller coasters, this film's passengers will walk away
completely satisfied.</P>
