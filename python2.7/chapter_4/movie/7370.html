<PRE>                              MURDER AT 1600
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Another conspiracy movie?  Maybe.  Plausible story?  Yes.
Entertaining?  Definitely.  For all the complaining people do about
government (and a lot of it is justified), it's refreshing to see a
movie that keeps those who think they are above the law within its
boundaries.  Maybe this only happens in the movies but it is a nice
thought.</P>
<P>A murder has occurred at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (The White House,
Washington, D.C.) and a homicide detective (Wesley Snipes) is assigned
to investigate the crime and runs into stiff opposition from the head
of White House Secret Service (Daniel Benzali) and is aided in his
search for the truth by a conscience-stricken female Secret Service
agent (Diane Lane).  The President's national security advisor (Alan
Alda) is also part of the intrigue as he resists any attempt to link
the first family with the crime.  Snipes is forced to investigate
certain venues in secret which puts his life in danger and the movie
takes many different turns before arriving at its conclusion which
unfortunately isn't disguised too well and many film buffs will have
the story figured out before the climax arrives.</P>
<P>That is about the only flaw keeping 'Murder at 1600' on the money at
all times and is a taut and suspenseful thriller detailing not only the
murder investigation but it also contains a sub plot which involves the
White House dealing with a crisis of military hostages held overseas in
Asia.  It's also too bad that in every film dealing with suspicions at
the highest levels of government, that those central figures remain as
caricatures to the plotline and we never really get to know them as
part of the film's central focus.  It's true in this case with the
President being portrayed by Ronnie Cox ('Deliverance', 'Beverly Hills
Cop', 'Robocop', 'Total Recall') and was also the case in 1994's 'Clear
and Present Danger' in which that film's President (Donald Moffat) was
secondary to the story and 'Independence Day' which portrayed its
President (Bill Pullman) rather poorly.  Even the recent 'Absolute
Power' failed to show its President (Gene Hackman) as anything more
than a second rate characterization.</P>
<P>Wesley Snipes gives his best performance since 'White Men Can't Jump'
(1992) in this picture which makes his character not only intelligent
but determined to get at the truth.  Its a deep portrayal from Snipes
who has been so good and so focused on the characters he's played.
'Murder at 1600' is a step in the right direction for his career.  It's
also a film in which the entire cast figures prominently and delivers
the goods.</P>
