Rating: ****</P>
<P>Near the end of Steven Spielberg's awe-inspiring journey Close
Encounters Of The Third Kind ( CEOTTK ) something wonderful for
humanity is happening; we are coming into touch with aliens. They are
benevolent creatures, interested only in helping us. The contact scene
is truly thrilling. Rarely does a hollywood production come this close
to perfection. CEOTTK is about watching out society grow into
something different from the outside. It's most remarkable.</P>
<P>In the entire history of cinema there have been maybe four great films
about contacting aliens, a suprisingly small amount, considering the
subject matter and what you would excpect hollywood executives to do
with it. when I say a great film I mean a film that accomplishes
everything it wants to, and overcomes all the tasks it sets for
itself. One standard a film of the 'contact' genre must set for itself
is to inspire awe. And thus the four movies: Stanley Kubrick's
remarkable not-so-much-film-as-excperience, 2001: A Space Odessey,
Spielberg's CEOTTK, Spielberg's E.T. The Extraterrestrial, and most
recently, Robert Zemeckis's Contact. Otherwise we see comedies such as
Men In Black and Mars Attacks!, spoofs like Mystery Science Theater
3000: The Movie and dumb "entertainments" like The Fifth Element (
easily the worst film I have seen this year, thus far ).</P>
<P>CEOTTK is a study of our universe.It is a reflection of ourselves: we
claim to be so immensly powerful and big, but if they ever do come
will we be ready?</P>
