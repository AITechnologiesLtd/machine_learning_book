<PRE>"Life is Beautiful" and the film is better
"Life Is Beautiful"/"La Vita è Bella"
Reviewed by John Haywood
Overall Rating: *****</PRE>
<P>     The year before last was a heck of a year if you like good films.
Never mind "Titanic;" I thought it was good, but way over-hyped.  "Good Will
Hunting," "Contact," and "Seven Years in Tibet" were better; on a technical
par with "Titanic," but more interesting.  I thought "Gattaca," a very well
made science-fiction film that questions what impact genetic engineering
will have on our lives, was easily the best film of that year.  Of course, I
didn't
know "Life Is Beautiful" was being shown in Italy.
     Guido Orefice is the type of man who can laugh at anything.  If he
weren't, he might not be able to survive--for he's Jewish and lives in
fascist Italy.  His jolly attitude helps him woo Dora (Nicoletta Braschi)
away from the bureaucrat she's engaged to (the man who denied him a permit
to open a bookstore, no less).  The question ultimately comes down to
whether his happy demeanor is enough to carry him, Dora, and their young son
Joshua
(Giorgio Cantarini) through the horrors of World War II.
     "Life Is Beautiful" is wonderfully written.  When it tries to be funny,
it is hilarious.  In one very pointed scene, Guido, hoping to find someone
who opposes the fascists, quietly asks
another man what his politics are--before the question even registers in the
man's
head, he addresses his children by name: Benito and Adolpho.  Still, not
everything works against Guido; the scene where he finally wins over Dora is
absolutely perfect.  All this comedy works very much in the film's favor.  I
have no qualms about saying "Life
Is Beautiful" is better than "Schindler's List;" and it boils down to the
comedy.  Guido's clownish nature makes it even harder to watch what happens
to him in the concentration camp--but by the same token. it gives him a
defiant air that's very satisfying, and helps relieve the oppressiveness of
the totalitarian state that looms over everyone in the film.
     Just watching the film, you can tell that it was a labor of love for
the actors.  Two stand out in my mind: the first is Giorgio Cantarini, who
plays Joshua.  Though he's a little old
for the very early scenes, he carries off the later scenes beautifully--it's
really hard to believe so young a child can act so effectively.  Roberto
Benigni, however, is the true creative genius who pulls the film together.
In addition to his masterful work co-writing and
directing "Life is Beautiful," he also stars in it; he won my heart within
his first minute on screen.
     If "Life Is Beautiful" has a weakness, it's the translation.  There
were several places where the subtitles seemed a great deal shorter than the
spoken lines--and one where I thought I caught a name that didn't make it
into the subtitle.  Despite this problem, the subtitles are preferable to a
dubbing.  Beyond the traditional arguments regarding the value of hearing
the original actors--which I'd say apply more to "Life Is Beautiful" than
any
other foreign film I've seen--there would be a thorny translation problem
with the fact that some minor characters SPEAK English or German--languages
not understood by the characters they're addressing; it would become
confusing if the other characters spoke English instead of Italian--as would
happen if the film were dubbed.
     The PG-13 rating seems strong for "Life is Beautiful."  The main basis
is the strong thematic content relating to the holocaust.  The worst
violence is all off screen--in a way, it's more jarring than most films'
depictions on screen; the big exception is a scene involving a stack of
corpses.  I didn't catch any nudity or coarse language--though I don't speak
Italian, so the latter may have been lost in translation (but I doubt it).
The real problem for children
is they'll probably will lose patience with the subtitles.  That's a shame,
since all else being equal, I'd say the film would be a good family film:
the film's moving depiction of some of the worst events in history, and the
depiction of Guido and Dora's great--even heroic--love for each other and
their son, both weigh heavily in its favor.
     Still, calling it a family film doesn't do "Life Is Beautiful" justice.
One often thinks of family films as bland.  "Life is Beautiful" will make
you laugh plenty, cry some, and
think.  It's uplifting, charming, and creative.  I honestly can't think of a
word against it.</P>
