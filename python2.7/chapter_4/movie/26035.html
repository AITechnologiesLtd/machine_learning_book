<P>THE CELL is chock full of some of the most repulsive imagery I've ever seen 
in a major motion picture. Also some of the most creative. Its director, 
Tarsem Singh, who comes from a music video and commercial background, is a 
visual stylist of the highest order and in some scenes he's orchestrated what 
could be called visual poetry. THE CELL is often a feast for the eyes though 
unfortunately almost never a feast for the soul.</P>
<P>Last week Roger Ebert and his smarmy co-host Richard Roeper breathlessly 
raved, deeming it a masterwork, one of the best films of the year. Just a 
week prior, Ebert panned COYOTE UGLY, exclaiming "There has to be something 
for the gray matter. Something". Well I've seen THE CELL and I don't recall 
it offering much of anything for the gray matter. It had promise (but doesn't 
every movie, hell, TEACHING MRS. TINGLE had promise), but it's more 
interested in operatic images than it is in story (the same of which could be 
said for a music video). The scenes between its characters feel oddly cold 
and removed like in many Stanley Kubrick films, but in those the stiffness 
served a purpose, Kubrick made satire and Tarsem has made a straight genre 
film, which should have likeable characters in order to make us, you know, 
give a damn. Whatever artistry the director brings to his visual palettes he 
clearly lacks with his actors; all their voices might as well be dubbed in 
seeing as how their delivery lacks discernable emotion. Tarsem is clearly not 
at all interested in them, but he realizes that he has to give those pesky 
characters some screen time before getting to his visual feast. And he 
complies, though obviously quite begrudgingly.
So I find myself in something of a quandary. While parts of THE CELL 
disgusted and even offended me, parts of it thrilled me and served as a 
reminder of what this medium is really capable of. THE CELL plays it safe 
with its story line, already described by some as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS meets 
MATRIX, but it doesn't in individual sequences, which is refreshing after one 
of the most conventional movie summers in some time.</P>
<P>Tarsem may not be much of human storyteller, but he manages to capture the 
dream state better here than in any other film I've seen. When the picture 
opens, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez under pounds of make-up), a 
progressive child psychologist, has been placed into her patient's 
subconscious by a group of scientists testing out a revolutionary new dream 
therapy that enables the patient to interact with their therapist in their 
own head, thus uncovering secrets that may be too painful to be revealed 
consciously. Once in the patient's head, Deane finds herself decked out in a 
flowing white gown amid a serene desert vista that could've been spliced in 
from a Calvin Klein ad. She's trailing up a sandy dune as Tarsem's camera 
lingers, watching from afar. Next she's on a black horse riding to her 
patient, jump to her with the patient, the horse behind her, now an inanimate 
life-size figurine. Tarsem captures the odd incongruous shifts that we 
encounter in our dreams, a state where unbelievable things occur and seem 
downright believable as they transpireâ€¦until we wake and ponder; wait a 
minute, I can't fly. In the world Tarsem creates, anything is possible.</P>
<P>For its first thirty five minutes THE CELL shows a great deal of promise, 
expertly cutting between three separate stories so as they build to their 
inevitable interlocking we feel tension from each overlapping into the other. 
In one, dogged FBI agent Peter Novak (a dulled Vince Vaughn) is narrowing in 
on Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a schizophrenic killer who performs some of 
the most revolting acts I've ever seen get past the MPAA with an R rating of 
approval. Stargher has constructed a cell encased in glass, containing only a 
toilet and a bench. He kidnaps women and locks them within it. He leaves them 
there, alone, setting a timer for water to intermittently shower down from 
the ceiling. He films them from a stationary camera as they drown, slowly. 
Later, after they've died, he takes their nude bodies, places them on a slab 
and levitates above them (you see this wacko has inserted steel rings into 
his back which he connects to chains that hold him above the bodies, his own 
skin stretching out like molten latex) while he masturbates over their 
corpses.</P>
<P>Audiences have always had a morbid fascination with how serial killers 
operate, and these sort of films have been growing decidedly more gruesome 
and kinky with their killer's fetishes, but THE CELL has crossed boundaries 
that I didn't have any desire to see crossed. I don't mind perversion if it 
has a point (as it did in SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) but here it serves 
no purpose other than to titillate and jolt an audience that's probably sat 
through everything from KISS THE GIRLS to THE BONE COLLECTOR. THE CELL has 
gladly matched the evil we've seen in all those films and now we can sit and 
wait to see someone match it.</P>
<P>After discovering several clues that lead to the killer, the FBI tracks 
Stargher down, who lays in a coma, passed out after failing to get to his 
medication. The agents have discovered he has another victim in his cell, and 
it's only a matter of time before she drowns. Problem is they don't know 
where Stargher keeps the cell and since he isn't conscious they have no way 
of finding out. This is when the stories collide. The cops go to the 
revolutionary scientists with the proposition to put the progressive 
psychologist inside the killer's mind, befriend him and get him to confess 
the location of his cell. Thus begins the visual orgy.
Amongst the madness is Jennifer Lopez, who, here, lacks everything that made 
her so charming in OUT OF SIGHT. Lopez looks stunning always, her hair 
perfect, even when mussed it's stylishly so. Here, she truly gives a star 
performance, and I mean that in the worst way. Gone is the energy and glow, 
in its place a Melanie Griffith acting job complete with cotton candy affect 
and adorned with a small country's supply of lip gloss.</P>
<P>Another acting causality is the usually immensely likeable Vince Vaughn, a 
highly individual actor who's managed to inject personality in even the most 
banal roles (his cowboy serial killer in CLAY PIGEONS), though in this film 
he walks through the part looking tired, speaking in measured tones, not 
really doing much of anything. If you're gonna cast a talent like Vaughn why 
not give him something to do besides a tired Charlie Sheen impersonation?</P>
<P>Not to mention (but I'll do so anyway since it's sorta my job) the myriad of 
character actors given nothing roles, like Dylan Baker, Marianne 
Jean-Baptiste, and Pruitt Taylor Vince, though in a major motion picture this 
is to be expected. Vincent D'Onofrio manages to make something of an 
impression in early scenes when he plays his schizoid killer like a nerdy 
mouth breather type, seemingly more afraid of human interaction than death 
itself. Though once we get into his mind D'Onofrio's performance becomes more 
typically over the top.</P>
<P>The script's attempts to give us hints as to why Stargher turned out the way 
he did are awfully pretentious (you see, he was abused by his father who took 
to calling him "faggot"), but writer Mark Protosevich and director Tarsem 
Singh nonetheless deserve credit for birthing some of the most oddly 
compelling (and deeply disturbing visuals) I've ever seen in a picture not 
directed by Fellini or Argento. The visuals aren't total originals, but they 
come to life as such with Tarsem's world combining Tarot card images with odd 
religious torture devices into the grimmest fairy tale universe since 
CINDERELLA before it was sanitized. But ultimately, all those smoke and 
mirrors weren't enough to tide me over. I mean, there has to be something for 
the gray matter. Something. Doesn't there?</P>
