<PRE>"The Perfect Storm" -- Fantastic Fury
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>The fishermen of Gloucester, Massachusetts live their
lives to fish.  As the film opens, we see this
pastoral harbor community with statues honoring brave
seamen, shipbuilders hard at work creating new
vessels, and a large number of fishing boats
triumphantly returning with their catch.  Gloucester
fishermen are more committed to fishing than to their
marriages.   They are courageous superheroes when they
are out on the open seas.  And, to catch their fish,
they are even willing to brave the perfect storm.</P>
<P>"The Perfect Storm" is an absorbing yarn about man
versus nature and the folly that results from blind
hubris.  Based on Sebastian Junger's nonfiction
bestseller, the film is a vivid retelling of a
devastating 1991 incident in which a down-on-his-luck,
swordfish boat captain risks it all to bring back a
catch that promises to make them a huge profit.  Led
by skipper Billy Tyne (stoic George Clooney) who
captains the Andrea Gail, he hopes that this next trip
out to the fishing grounds of the Grand Banks (a few
days east of Gloucester) will lift him out of his
current slump. 
But going out to sea is like an extended and dangerous
tour of duty.  The crewmembers' loved ones rejoice
when their men return home.  But faces are filled with
sorrow when it's time to leave.  For Captain Tyne,
fishing has resulted in a broken marriage.  For the
youthful and wildly-in-love Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), it
means having to spend time away from his girlfriend. 
And for crewmember Murphy (John C. Reilly), it means
being separated from his lovable son.  Other crewmates
are also hesitant to go back out.  Tyne coldly stares
at them and threatens, "if any of you don't want to
come, a replacement is just a phone call away."  You
may think that he's unrealistically overbearing, but
as a local hatchery manager says, "that's the way the
game is played."  </P>
<P>The seas are a dangerous place in the fall, having the
potential to swallow ships whole.  "The Grand Banks is
no joke in October," warns one concerned Gloucester
resident.  By now, we've developed a genuine liking
for the crew of the Andrea Gail, as well as an immense
respect for their work ethic.  But we get the
foreboding sensation that this trip will be marred
with peril.</P>
<P>The Andrea Gail encounters all kinds of bad luck. 
Though they eventually catch lots of fish, a monster
storm takes them by surprise.  The local forecaster
says, "you can be a meteorologist all your life and
never see this."  It's a storm so ferocious that it
creates maximum gale force winds and 10-story swells. 
In fact, you can barely hear the actors even when they
are yelling at each other through the wind-whipped
rain.  Special effects convincingly and impressively
create the furious, churning seas.  And the camera
shots, which show the crew rocking back and forth,
convey such realism that at times it was a
queasiness-inducing experience.  The film also shows
other craft caught and victimized by the angry seas. 
Freighters are having its cargo knocked off its decks
by the enormous waves while even the Coast Guard has
been rendered almost powerless.  Captain Tyne remains
unfazed.  He must travel through the storm in order to
sell his fish, lest his catch spoil.  He is a
determined man who opens the throttle against the
unstoppable forces of pride and Mother Nature.</P>
<P>Engaging characters make for a watchable film, and the
entire ensemble cast performs admirably.  We share the
concern of the loved ones as they watch the
increasingly dire weather reports.  We feel their
sense of helplessness.  We pray for the fearless
skipper to find a way to maneuver through the crashing
waves, howling winds, and torrential downpour.  The
love that we develop for the crew and those that
eagerly await their return pulls us in.  But
ultimately it may be the storm that pulls them under. </P>
