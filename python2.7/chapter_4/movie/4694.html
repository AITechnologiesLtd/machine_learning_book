<P>     Despite its name, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is actually about a group of 
irritating, twenty-something males whose adolescent attitudes have 
remained with them well into adulthood.  This film centers around a 10-
year high school reunion, which explains why so many twenty-eight year 
olds are gathering in a town where "nothing changes but the seasons."  
Of course, it goes without saying that most of the principals never left 
this sleepy, snowy New England hamlet in the first place.  Of the 
nearly-dozen characters assembled for the reunion, only one -- musician 
Willie (Timothy Hutton) -- had the ambition to head for distant 
horizons.  He returns home with a girlfriend named Tracy (Annabeth Gish) 
and a host of uncertainties about whether or not he should marry her.</P>
<P>     Willie isn't the only one going through an under-30 life crisis.  
Borrowing heavily from other, better films, director Ted Demme and 
screenwriter Scott Rosenberg give each of their male protagonists a case 
of commitment angst.  Tommy (Matt Dillon) is caught between two women:  
the gorgeous-but-married Darien (an unconvincing Lauren Holly) and 
Sharon (Mira Sorvino), a quiet girl who is desperately in love with him.  
Paul (the always-irritating Michael Rapaport) would rather fantasize 
about trysts with supermodels than admit his feelings to his girlfriend, 
Jan (Martha Plimpton).  And Tommy's best friend (Max Perlich) prefers to 
spend his nights drinking rather than risk becoming involved in a 
serious relationship.</P>
<P>     Dozens of previous releases have plowed the paths traversed by 
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.  This uninspired retread offers little in the way of 
originality or freshness.  Especially disappointing is the ending, which 
pulls together all sorts of melodramatic cliches, then uses handwaving 
to construct hard-to-swallow resolutions for nearly every dilemma.  
Suddenly -- surprise, surprise -- just about everyone is willing to make 
a lifelong commitment.  Along the way to this conclusion, we get lots of 
snappy patter that sounds like it came straight out of a script-writer's 
pen.</P>
<P>     There are some high points.  Several of the characters, notably 
those essayed by Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, and 
especially Natalie Portman, attain some semblance of believability.  
Portman, playing a charming, precocious 13-year old who develops a crush 
on Willie, deserves special recognition.  While this subplot could 
easily have devolved into LOLITA-inspired soap opera material, Portman 
uses her considerable talent to keep things on a higher level.  After 
each of her too-few scenes in BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, we're eagerly 
anticipating the next one (they're about the only things worth waiting 
for).  It's interesting to note that in her two significant roles to 
date (this film and THE PROFESSIONAL), Portman has fallen for much older 
men.</P>
<P>     Other than the interaction between Portman and Hutton, effective 
moments are rare.  There's an admittedly-dopey sequence in a bar where 
everyone gathers to mangle Neil Diamond's "Sweet Caroline", and another 
where Willie and Andera (Uma Thurman) share a quiet evening conversation 
about life, love, and what it means to devote yourself to someone else's 
happiness.  Besides those rare occasions, though, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS 
doesn't have much to offer.  A great deal of this film is derivative, 
and you're likely to leave the theater with an unpleasant sense of deja 
vu.  </P>
