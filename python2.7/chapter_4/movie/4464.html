<P>     Aside from the obvious discrepancy in animation quality, there's 
one very big difference between BALTO and films like BEAUTY AND THE 
BEAST, ALADDIN, and THE LION KING.  While the men and women at Disney 
pen their scripts with audiences of all ages in mind, the four 
screenwriters for BALTO have aimed their film strictly at the under-
twelve crowd.  This movie isn't likely to sicken adults, but it 
definitely isn't meant for them, and that's one of the reasons why 
BALTO's take at the box office is going to be dramatically less than 
what a corresponding Disney release could rake in.</P>
<P>     The animation is serviceable, although not eye-popping.  There are 
some scenes, mostly during snowstorms, that look impressive, but these 
are offset by a number of pedestrian, Saturday morning cartoon-like 
sequences.  BALTO certainly isn't a visual treat.  There aren't any 
show-stopping tunes, either.  With the exception of the closing song 
("Reach for the Light", performed by Steve Winwood), there's not a 
musical number to be found, which, more than anything else, accounts for 
the short running time.  For good or ill, songs tend to pad out animated 
motion pictures.</P>
<P>     BALTO opens and closes with short live-action sequences featuring 
Myriam Margoles and Lola Bates-Campbell.  95% of the film, however, is 
animated -- a colorful, if unspectacular, rendition of the tale told by 
Margoles to the young Bates-Campbell.  (BALTO is very loosely based on a 
true story.)  The action takes place in 1925 Nome, Alaska, where a 
diphtheria epidemic has struck.  With bad weather encroaching, the only 
way to retrieve life-saving medication from Anchorage is by dog sled.  
BALTO tells of how a half-wolf/half-dog struggles through blizzards and 
treacherous terrain to save the life of one little girl, while finding 
puppy love along the way.</P>
<P>     The vocal talents employed for BALTO are adequate, although not 
standouts.  Kevin Bacon has the title role.  Bridget Fonda is Jenna, 
Balto's dog girlfriend.  Jim Cummings, who was last heard in THE LION 
KING as one of the hyenas, gives voice to Balto's rival, a sort of 
canine Gaston.  Then there are the requisite comic sidekicks:  Bob 
Hoskins as Boris the goose and Phil Collins as a pair of jolly polar 
bears, Muk and Luk.</P>
<P>     BALTO isn't a great animated feature, but, Disney's computer-
generated TOY STORY aside, it's the only one of its kind this holiday 
season.  Well-paced, politically correct, and undemanding, the movie is 
good for children.  Its appeal for parents is another matter altogether, 
however -- but at least most of them won't hate it.  Or so Universal 
Pictures and Amblin Entertainment hope.</P>
