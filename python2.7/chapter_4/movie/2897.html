<PRE>                                 WYATT EARP
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1994 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<P>Directed by Lawrence Kasdan
Starring Kevin Costner, Gene Hackman, Dennis Quaid, Michael Madsen</P>
<P>     I knew as little of this man's legend as anyone in Britain.  The
film tells the story of how this famous lawman stood up to the scum of
the Wild West and brought them to heel.  It stretches back into his past
to show that, had his family not stood by him, he might so easily have
gone the way of his opponents.</P>
<P>     Work in which Costner is involved often has an uncanny feel for
the mood of the moment.  ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES was received with
great delight in the U.K. as ridicule was poured upon the first attempt to
re-introduce a "poll" tax since medieval times.</P>
<P>     The music was lovely and I'll still be humming that hint of D'Oyly
Carte in a week's time.  One beautifully photographed vignette followed
another.  There is not a typical "vigilante" picture.  The historical
perspective of lives caught up in the turmoil of social change reminded
me of a work like ROSA LUXEMBURG by Von Trotta.  The psychology of
the hero unfolds at the pace of THE LEOPARD.  But, Visconti's style
is more "quiet Italian villa."</P>
<P>     I saw the TV show about the immense research involved in the
making of this picture.  And many of its scenes are packed with
people.  I longed to hear the clutter of their voices in the
background, layer upon layer, reading snatches of the biography, the
newspaper reports, the wanted notices, the Old Testament, the creak of
wood under their feet, that distant gunshot when Doc. says
"Tombstone...."</P>
<P>     By any measure of standards, this is a film of quality.  I mean,
compared to BEVERLEY HILLS COP III, where someone attempted to make a
comedy script into a thriller!</P>
<P>     But if the foreign dubs are not yet ready, perhaps there is a
chance to go for a "Director's Soundtrack." I'm sure it would be worth
it.</P>
