<PRE>REAR WINDOW (1954)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Cinema as an art form owes its popularity and very existence
to the fact that human beings tend to like experiencing
things, people and situations they are not likely to
encounter in their normal lives. That natural curiosity
becomes especially appealing in situations that don't
require physical contact nor have any direct consequences.
That lack of immediate contact or consequences is often
enough to turn some banal, ordinary images and situations
into interesting experiences. This psychological phenomenon
was until recently branded as nothing more than sexual
anomaly called "voyeurism". In modern world, success of
tabloids and reality TV shows like BIG BROTHER indicate that
voyeuristic tendencies have more universal appeal and that
they couldn't be brushed off as mere sexual perversion. One
of the cinema authors who understood that and based some of
his greatest films on it is Alfred Hitchcock. REAR WINDOW,
his 1954 thriller, often cited as one of the greatest film
ever made, could be seen as some kind of ode to voyeurism.</P>
<P>The film is based on the story by Cornell Woolrich and
screenplay by John Michael Hayes. Plot takes place in one
Greenwhich Village apartment, occupied by L.B. "Jeff"
Jeffries (played by James Stewart), adventurous photographer
who broke his left leg while trying to make an action shot
during the auto races. Now he is wheelchair-bound in his
little Greenwich Village apartment. The only form of
entertainment comes in the form of rear window, which
provides excellent view to the apartments surrounding the
courtyards. Because of summer heat and lack of air
conditioning, most of the windows are open and shades never
closed, so Jeff can watch private lives of his neighbours
almost all the time. This provides insight into many real
life dramas, including unhappy marriage between jeweller
Lars Thorwald (played by Raymond Burr) and his nagging bed-
ridden wife. That drama becomes most interesting after Mrs.
Thorwald disappears, and Jeff is soon convinced that her
husband murder had killed her and began disposing the body.
His old friend and police detective Lieutenant Thomas J.
Doyle (played by Wendell Corey) doesn't share Jeffries'
suspicions and demands more proofs before he could launch
the official investigation. On the other hand, Lisa Carol
Fremont (played by Grace Kelly), glamorous fashion
consultant and Jeff's love interest, and his nurse Stella
(played by Thelma Ritter) are more open-minded and volunteer
to help him in his gathering of evidence.</P>
<P>REAR WINDOW was made by Hitchcock during the zenith of his
career - 1950s and early 1960s - time when he became object
of worship among film critics and established cult following
he enjoys until this day. This film clearly demonstrates why
Hitchcock enjoys such reputation. Like in many of his
classic thrillers of that period, relatively simple mystery
plot is opportunity for Hitchcock to deal with some more
interesting topics like alienation or aberrant sexuality.
Actually, this film explores sexual themes with boldness
quite unusual for 1950s standards. Many of the real life
dramas that entertain the protagonist explicitly or
implicitly deal with twisted sexuality - newlywed young man
(played by Rand Harper) must deal with his wife's sexual
insatiability; Miss Lonely Heart (played by Havis Davenport)
can't express her own sexuality; Miss Torso (played by
Georgine Darcy) is an exhibitionist; couple who sleeps on
fire escape (played by Sara Berner and Frank Cady) uses
their dog as surrogate for children, implicitly suffering
from sterility; struggling songwriter (played by Ross
Bagdarasian) is suffering from writer's block which could be
read as metaphor for impotence. Even the protagonists have
problems that could be viewed as sexual - Jeff, apart from
his obvious voyeurism, is also faced with impotence, while
his glamorous girlfriend might be viewed as cold, distant
and frigid. Hitchcock, whose best film were dealing with
various forms of sexual aberrations, explored not single,
but many of such phenomena.</P>
<P>Another Hitchcock's trademark in his golden phase was
inclination towards experiment. REAR WINDOW represents
exactly one of such occasions when he decided to use
unconventional structure of film. Entire plot takes place in
a single room, and the audience is able to witness only
events seen and heard by the protagonist. To make an
interesting, exciting film in such circumstances might
represent unsolvable problem for any less experienced
director, but Hitchcock managed to produce not only one of
the best films of his career, but also one of the most
successful experiments in history of cinema. Secret of his
success was in superb use of editing and clever manipulation
of viewer's expectations - suspense is gradually increased
through seemingly banal events of everyday life. Voyeuristic
effect is increased with Hitchcock's wise decision not to
use Franz Waxman's original music except in credits. Such
music would be too distracting, and Hitchcock finds
alternative in radios which play popular 1950s songs in the
background - these songs sometimes can be used as ironic
comment on the plot, but they mostly add to the utterly
realistic atmosphere of the film. While today's filmmakers
would make this film cheap by shooting on location,
Hitchcock was fortunate to enjoy benefits of the largest
indoor set in history of Hollywood. Thus the film could be
meticulously planned up to the most insignificant detail,
and REAR WINDOW is therefore, in strictly technical sense,
one of the most perfect films in history of cinema.</P>
<P>Another Hitchcock's trademark is ability to extract the best
out of actors at his disposal. One of such actors was James
Stewart, then in the latter stage of his career, when he
successfully transformed his all-American on-screen
personality in order to play darker, imperfect and more
complex characters. His Jeff is just one of such characters
- when we meet him, he has already established himself as
irresponsible adrenaline junkie, and his reluctance to
burden himself with permanent relationship makes him even
less appealing. His actions in the film are at first caused
by boredom, but afterwards his crusade against potential
murderer is nothing more than an excuse to satisfy his more
down-to-earth voyeuristic impulses. Until the truth is
discovered in the end of film, we can't be sure whether an
innocent man might suffer because of Jeff's boredom,
voyeurism and too much imagination. Grace Kelly, another
great Hitchcockian actress, again shows that she could be
more than just a pretty face. Her role of stunningly
beautiful, glamorous, but distant and cold woman become more
complex when Lisa Fremont becomes infected with her
boyfriend's voyeurism and adrenaline addiction. It can be
said for Thelma Ritter, talented supporting actress whose
character of preaching nurse goes through similar
transformation. Wendell Corey as Jeff's sceptical friend is
also good, as well as Raymond Burr as down-to-earth but
therefore even more menacing figure of potential murderer.</P>
<P>The only possible argument against REAR WINDOW as perfect
film might be found in Hitchcock compromising his original
idea and allowing some scenes not to be shot from Jeff's
window. But this little and unnecessary nit-pick shouldn't
deprive REAR WINDOW of well-deserved position among the best
thriller ever made.</P>
