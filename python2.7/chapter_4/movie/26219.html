URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>In URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT, the film students are preparing their 
thesis films.  The best of the bunch could win the prestigious Hitchcock 
Award, something that URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT would have no chance of 
winning.</P>
<P>Why don't they make sequels of movies whose characters we would like to 
know more about -- THE BIG CHILL, for example?  The original URBAN 
LEGEND, which is pretty bad, is a decidedly watchable movie compared to 
its schlocky sequel.</P>
<P>With a homogeneous group of young actors playing almost completely 
interchangeable characters, the movie is slapped together by its 
director (John Ottman) and writers (Silvio Horta, Paul Harris Boardman 
and Scott Derrickson) like a toddler with Duplo blocks.  As blood 
splatters everywhere, the film uses every cliché in the horror movie 
writer's manual, from stupid victims to loud noises.  There isn't an 
incident in it that you haven't seen done before, and frequently better.</P>
<P>There is simply no reason to waste your money on this movie, which 
wouldn't be worth seeing if it were the only thing showing in town.  If 
you want to see a good movie about urban legends, URBANIA, currently 
playing the art houses, covers this ground with style, even if the film 
is a thriller rather than a horror movie.  If it's a horror movie you're 
after, perhaps the best ever made, THE EXORCIST, complete with new 
footage and a new digital soundtrack, is currently playing at your local 
multiplex.</P>
<P>URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT runs a long 1:40.  It is rated R for violence, 
gore, language and some sexuality and would be acceptable for high 
school seniors and older.</P>
