<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Wim Wenders (The End of Violence, Paris, Texas, Lisbon Story) made the
very touching documentary Buena Vista Social Club in collaboration with
guitarist Ry Cooder, who had found the aging musicians in Cuba, in 1996,
musicians neglected after Castro came to power. They range in age from
the 60s to the 90s, as they play the music they recorded in the '40s and
'50s. The Buena Vista Social Club (Nonesuch), an album of the 14 Cuban
musicians became such a hit, that it sold a million copies and also won
a Grammy. The movie is a mixture of their music, lifestyles, and an
apolitical, quick peek at an impoverished Havana. It is done in a
wonderfully nostalgic manner, as Wenders becomes an admiring fan of
theirs, allowing us to see how humble and human these most talented
musical souls are.</P>
<P>We start out at their 2 day concert in Amsterdam, then go back to Havana
and see them free associate and tell something candid about themselves,
including their biography, and then we go to their finale concert in
Carnegie Hall, New York.</P>
<P>Wenders has done a good job highlighting them, though I would have liked
to have seen more of their music as performed in Carnegie Hall, instead
of seeing an overabundance of shots showing how well they were received
there and how appreciative they were of that rousing welcome.</P>
<P>Ibrahim Ferrer is the mellifluous sounding 70-year-old singer, who was
shining shoes all these years before being part of Cooder's tremendous
coup. "If we followed the way of possessions," he says, "we'd have been
gone a long time ago." He has faith in a walking stick his dead mother
left him some 50 years ago, as a source of luck. The 92-year-old cigar
factory roller and cigar smoking guitarist, Compay Segundo, tries
unsuccessfully but with some amusement to find where the Club they once
played in existed. Segundo boasts of being the father of five and
playfully says he still hopes to sire a sixth child.Tearful joy fills
the eyes of the 69-year-old Omara Portuondo, as she sings the bolero
Silencia in a duet with Ferrer, which takes place in a recording studio.
Ruben Gonzalez, the 77-year-old, who some in the group think, might be
one of the very best pianists in the world, as he rises to the challenge
in Carnegie Hall, smiling effusively with a warm glow covering him, as
he basks in the applause he receives. He didn't even own a piano before
the film was made. Barbarito Torres, who is much younger than the
others, plays his unique 12-string lute-like Arabian instrument called
the laud, while the camera records the decaying paint on the seaside
buildings and the sensual music played recalls a grand past that no
longer exists.</P>
<P>Can such music make a dilapidated Cuba bearable? It sure seems that way,
as there is a consuming joy that sweeps across those who come into
contact with these naive but friendly souls. Their genuine camaraderie
for each other and love of country and gentleness, shines through as
much as all the wonderful music they play.</P>
<P>In Carnegie Hall, they sing that lively song entitled "El Cuarto de
Tula", with the words:  "Fire! Fire! I'm burning up. Call the fireman!
Tula's room is all ablaze!" As their performance goes on, Wenders
follows three of the group into Manhattan, as they look up at the tall
buildings in awe and gravitate to a tacky souvenir store, where
celebrities and U.S. presidents as statues, are greatly admired by the
childlike musicians, who are having the time of their life, wandering
down Seventh Avenue and feeling so elated at seeing the Radio City Music
Hall. They tell each other, it doesn't get any better than this.</P>
<P>I wonder how much longer Castro's Communist Revolution will go on! It's
an obvious failure, as even these great musicians were not recognized by
the Cuban government; it took an outsider to do it. Near the film's end,
the camera pans back to Havana and a banner proclaims "We believe in
dreams."</P>
