<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The cinematographer Ed Emshwiller, once known as Emsh, used a hand-held
135-pound sound camera for some scenes, often composing superimpositions
in the camera. The director Adolfas Mekasis is the brother of noted
Greenwich Village underground director and film historian Jonas, who is
credited with assisting his brother during the shooting. Adolfas has
come up with an offbeat, lighthearted romantic/comedy spoof, that gently
mocks France's New Wave cinema, which was the vogue among intellectuals
at the time. This is a film geared to film buffs and indie lovers who
are interested in some of the early 1960s works coming out of the
underground cinema movement in the States. There is no political message
or drug visualizations here, as the film tends to rely on the energy
conveyed by the characters and the fun they seemed to be having with
this unpredictable material they had to work with. If you're into
sight-gags and strange visual images, then you should be pleased with
the enthusiastic direction of this film. I enjoyed it as a look back at
a more innocent time in cinema and a chance to watch it poke fun at
other arty styles of cinema. The comedy part of the film had the feel of
those Buster Keaton silent ones.</P>
<P>The story is about two city boys who take to the woods to find the girl
they both love, Vera, and find out which of them she will marry. When
her father gleefully tells them, almost jumping for joy to see their
expressions sadden, that she married Gideon two months ago because she
was tired of waiting for them to ask, the boys take to the woods in the
winter climate, trying to recall in their flashbacks the reasons for
their obsessive attraction to her.</P>
<P>As an homage to the 'New Wave,' Vera is played by a different actress in
the courting scenes with Jack and Leo, which take place during different
seasons. I guess they both had different impressions of her, so it does
make sense that they see her differently, therefore why not have a
different actress play her for each.</P>
<P>The bizarre visuals gave this film its slapstick look, as there was one
scene of the boys dancing a Hebrew dance by a campfire in the woods, in
another Chinese subtitles appear to the side of a landscape scene, in
another the boys frolic in a frozen lake, in one scene there are people
instead of birds on the branches of a tree. It was goofy fun. My
favorite scene was of the two escaped convicts dressed in their striped
prison uniforms, fighting a duel, which brought a fit conclusion to the
two lovers and their search for answers.</P>
