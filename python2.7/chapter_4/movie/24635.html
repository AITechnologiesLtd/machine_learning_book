<PRE>GOD'S ARMY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In a popularity contest, those well-scrubbed young men in their starched
white shirts and dark ties, who show up on your doorstep offering you
the Book of Mormon, would probably finish dead last.  Most people can't
shut the door fast enough when they realize who is there.  Movies about
Mormon missionaries might seem likely to get the same reaction from
non-believers.  In the case of GOD'S ARMY, viewers who shut the
cinematic equivalent of the door in its face will be depriving
themselves of a surprisingly good film about faith and dedication.</P>
<P>Like a high quality blend of a documentary and an after-school
television special, this low-budget, fictional film creates a host of
interesting characters and provides a lot of surprising background on
what it means to be a Mormon missionary.  Although you may have never
given them a second thought, they don't have an easy vocation.  They
have to give up two years of their lives only to have most people slam
the door in their face, or worse.</P>
<P>As Elder Allen (the young missionaries are all called Elders), Matthew
Brown gives a complex performance as a kid filled with reservations
about whether he should be a missionary.  "Isn't it funny how a few
short days can change your whole life forever?" he tells us in
voice-over in the opening.  "And it isn't until later  that you realize
what happened to you."</P>
<P>Elder Allen has been sent to L.A., which with its "live nude girls"
marquees, looks like a den of iniquity to someone from Kansas, like
Elder Allen.  (There are too many references to the Wizard of Oz in the
script, which otherwise, is sharp, intelligent and humorous.)</P>
<P>Elder Allen has been assigned to room with Elder Dalton, who is
generally referred to as "Pops" because, at 29, he is much older than
the typically 19-year-old missionaries.  As Elder Dalton, Richard
Dutcher, who also writes and directs, steals the show.  In a moving
performance, he becomes the Yoda of their group.  When the story segues
from the humorous to the dramatic, Elder Dalton's story becomes more
prominent, as we learn that his life has been no bowl of cherries.</P>
<P>An excellent teacher, Elder Dalton likens their work to that of the
phone company.  They don't convert anyone; they just supply the tools so
that others can get in touch with God.  It's an interesting metaphor and
one of many in the thought-provoking script.  Always polite but not one
easy to say "no" to, he has answers for all occasions.  "I think that if
you're not interested in what we have to say, then you must not know
what we have to say," he tells one person who naively thinks that
expressing non-interest will make the missionaries leave.</P>
<P>There is certainly one thing that isn't likely to come to mind when
people think of Mormon missionaries, and that is that they could be big
practical jokesters -- not to their would-be converts, but to
themselves.  In a movie that is frequently quite funny, one of the best
scenes has a guy telling Elder Allen on his first day that he is going
to get his gun if they don't leave.  Elder Dalton then pushes Elder
Allen into the dark, cheap apartment of the gun owner.  Frightened out
of his wits, Elder Allen is surprised by a camera's flash that goes off
in front of his face.  This is his new home, and the guys in it are
other missionaries who'll be his companions.  The bad guy who claimed to
have a gun is just another missionary, who was playing a welcoming game
on the recruit.</P>
<P>When Elder Allen finds out that the last guy left his bed just hours
before, Elder Kinegar (Michael Buster) explains, "That's one of the
blessings of a life of poverty -- doesn't take long to pack."</P>
<P>The story doesn't skirt difficult issues.  Elder Kinegar spends his free
time reading anti-Mormon books aloud.  At first claiming that he just
wants to be able to refute the arguments of non-believers, he later
begins to believe the books and not his church's teachings.  The role of
women and minorities are discussed as well.  And Elder Allen will
develop eyes for one of the Mormon Sisters on a similar mission.</P>
<P>The good-spirited and informative picture is well-cast throughout even
if the acting is sometimes amateurish.  A moving and quite funny film,
it isn't at all what you might expect.  But be warned: after seeing it
you may not be able to quite so efficaciously shoo missionaries from
your doorstep.  Knowing more about them makes them more human and more
deserving of basic human politeness.</P>
<P>GOD'S ARMY runs 1:47.  It is rated PG for thematic elements and some
language and would be fine for anyone old enough to be interested in the
subject matter.</P>
