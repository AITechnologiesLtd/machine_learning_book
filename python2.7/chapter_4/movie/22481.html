<P>What is it about Jane Austen?  This box-office stalwart has inspired
five major film adaptations in the '90s (six counting the excellent
BBC/A&E production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in 1995).</P>
<P>I think I know what Austen's secret is: Her books are recent, but not
modern. Her central characters have good manners and triumph over bad
marriages or economic straits, instead of succumbing to their own vices
or whining too much about their problems.</P>
<P>MANSFIELD PARK is the last of Austen's major novels to be filmed
recently, and I think it is usually considered Austen's weakest novel,
though not too weak for cynical filmmakers to try to squeeze a bit more
cash out of the writer's legacy.</P>
<P>Writer-director Patricia Rozema's cynicism comes out in other ways in
this film, too. She transforms Austen's diffident, quiet heroine Fanny
Price (Frances O'Connor) into a sassy, '90s, politically-aware attitude
girl who shows up the fatuousness of most of the other characters. Only
Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller), Fanny's true friend and ultimate love
interest, meets her approval.</P>
<P>Worse, Rozema has embellished the tale with a subplot about the moral
evisceration of Fanny's adopted family, the Bertrams, caused by the
family's ties to slavery (based on a few brief references in the novel
to family business in the West Indies).</P>
<P>The movie features one of the best casts in the Austen movie series:
O'Connor is very good, Miller just as good, and Harold Pinter (he can
act, too) does well in the revised, over-politicized role of Sir Thomas
Bertram. Rozema's direction gives the polite, overwritten novel some
needed sensuality.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Rozema has also refracted the novel through a modern,
unsubtle, feminist bias. The result is still better than the average
'90s politically-correct sermonette, but definitely not a portal into a
19th-century brain (BEING JANE AUSTEN it isn't).</P>
<P>Austen's book is a study on virtues like "constancy," an un-modern
concept which does not mean the same thing as monogamy, nor does it mean
being "true to oneself," THELMA AND LOUISE style. It means believing in
certain moral values and being true to them even though others' conduct
is not always good or bad. Some of this subtlety comes through in the
film, but most of the characters are either too good (i.e. Fanny) or too
bad (everyone else, especially Sir Thomas) to be realistic studies. The
subplot about slavery is especially jarring, because it introduces
something morally unambiguous into a story which is about tolerating
shades of moral ambiguity.</P>
<P>The best dialogue in the film is in Austen's spirit, such as Fanny's
observation that "Life is but a succession of busy nothings" or Edmund's
wish for a "life of compassion and contemplation" (as a clergyman). But
too much of the dialogue is the kind of blunt raving that would have
made 19th-century families as dysfunctional as today's, except that they
customarily kept it to themselves.</P>
<P>Many of Rozema's revisionist additions ring false, like making Fanny an
aspiring writer (even if there were autobiographical elements in the
original novel, I doubt that Jane Austen was the smartass that Fanny is
portrayed as here) or having a character say things like "this is 1806,
for Heaven's sake."</P>
<P>It was supposed to be 1806, but MANSFIELD PARK the movie has a little
too much 1999 in it --- naïve social criticism, bathos, and vulgarity.
And judging from the popularity of Jane Austen adaptations, a lot of
moviegoers are tired of movies that remind them of the present.</P>
<P>Still, they'll probably take any period drama they can get...</P>
<PRE>3.5 stars</PRE>
