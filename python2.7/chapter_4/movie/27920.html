<PRE>"Blow Dry"</PRE>
<P>It is time, once again, for Britain's annual National Hair Championship and
the mayor of the town of Keighley, England has fought for the honor to host
the affair. But, the town folk don't hold the same enthusiasm for the event
until a local, estranged family decides to get back together and enter the
competition in "Blow Dry."</P>
<P>"Blow Dry" has its heart in the right place but the screenplay by Simon
Beaufoy, in the hands of director Paddy Breathnach, doesn't fulfill the
potential of either the family drama or the hairdressing competition. There
are two different movies playing here, one a melodrama and the other a
flashy contest, but neither gets more than shallow coverage.</P>
<P>The core melodrama begins with Shelley (Natasha Richardson) leaving her
hairdressing salon and her lover, Sandra (Rachel Griffiths), for a doctor's
appointment. The news isn't good, but Shelley puts up a brave front, as if
all is well. At the same time, the Nation Hair Championship competition is
heating up and members of the hair care community from all over Britain are
heading to Keighley.</P>
<P>The lead competitor, Raymond Robertson (Bill Nighy), wants to win at
whatever cost and begins a campaign of sabotage on the other players to
assure his victory. This includes checking on an old opponent living in
Keighley, Phil Allen (Alan Rickman). Phil was married to Shelley when, 10
years before, she left him for Sandra the night before the hair finals that
year. The bitter Phil, now just a town barber, had given up competing
forever - until Ray visits him and  he learns of Shelley's terminal
illness. It becomes a battle of the best in Britain when Phil, Shelley,
their son Brian and Sandra go against Ray and the rest for the coveted
Silver Scissors trophy</P>
<P>This mix of family drama and the glitter of the championship work against
each other in "Blow Dry." On one hand the story tries to tug at our
heartstrings with Shelley's plight against cancer, a broken family and the
need to get it all together one last time for the competition. This part
meanders as she tries to rally her ex-spouse, Phil, and son Brian to join
her, break the news of her illness to Sandra and keep her cancer under
control. This tear-jerking tale is diametrically opposed to the glitzy
world of the hair championship.</P>
<P>The competition is handled in a light-hearted way that has the requisite
outrageous hair-dos, egotistical cutters, cute team monikers (The Kilburne
Kutters, The Style Warriors) that sound like gang names, and a lot of
glitter. This goofy humor conflicts with Shelley's serious dilemma and
family woes, forcing the viewer to shift gears between the comedy and the
drama. By the time it was all over, I didn't know whether I should laugh or
cry, so I did neither.</P>
<P>The talented cast, led by Richardson and Rickman, are given little to do to
develop their stick character into real people. The backdrop of the
championship intrudes into the family drama, abruptly shifting the focus to
comedy and glitz. The actors try, but can't get past the material.
Richardson's Shelley is a stoic and pragmatic woman. Rickman looks
uncomfortable with his character, Phil, and doesn't do anything to show the
inner turmoil caused by the current events. The rest - Griffiths, Josh
Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook - are little more than background window
dressing.</P>
<P>The melding of seriocomic material can be done well, but not in "Blow Dry."
I give it a C-.</P>
