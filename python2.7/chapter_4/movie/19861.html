***: good picture, sound and seats]</P>
<P>    `Dick' is not a film meant for the theaters. It's not that it's super 
raunchy or in bad taste or the like, it's just a made-for-television movie 
that somehow got promoted to feature film status. You can practically hear 
the Hollywood suits glancing over the script thinking `Ooh, this is so funny 
and witty. Why haven't we done this before?'
    The truth is everything in `Dick' has, in fact, been done before and a 
lot better too. 
    The basic premise is a tired idea, but since it's a political satire 
there's a sense that a witty, zingy, hilarious satire is about to unfold. 
Unfortunately, the closest the film comes to creative comedy is through a few 
new `Dick' jokes (and I don't mean the nickname for Richard). Everything else 
is mostly there to fill in for a minimum running time.
    Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams star as Betsy and Arlene, two high 
school students who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when 
the Watergate break-in and the elaborate scandal following take place back in 
the early 1970s. The film is meant as a laugh-out-loud comedy so the basis 
for the jokes throughout the entire first act and most of the film in general 
deal with the fact that these girls are too stupid to understand what's 
really going on. When they find themselves being interrogated by Nixon's 
goons there's little to laugh at here. It's not a case of the girls thinking 
they're in big trouble for mailing a letter so close to midnight (which would 
have been remotely funny), it's a case of them being considered serious 
threats to national security which goes completely over their head. Playing 
off characters' idiocy is one thing, but these girls aren't dumb enough to be 
obnoxiously funny (a la `Dumb & Dumber') and aren't smart enough to see what 
is so blatantly obvious.
    To their credit, the contrived screenplay and poor performances by every 
working actor in Hollywood don't help much either. Dan Hedaya, the king of 
Hollywood working actors, co-stars as President Richard `Dick' Nixon, one of 
the most easy-to-make-fun-of figures in modern history and yet there's just 
nothing that goes `spoof' here. Hedaya's performance tends to flip-flop - 
first he's nice, likable as a cartoony image of Nixon, but later he's a 
totally different person - malicious and mean-spirited and disappears for 
large blocks of time (wouldn't you think the actor playing the title 
character would get just a bit more screen time?)
    The story follows Betsy and Arlene and their bimbotic (is that a word?) 
adventures as they find themselves being flattered by Nixon and have a ball 
being `official White House dog-walkers,' and `secret youth advisers,' which 
they proceed to tell everyone about despite Nixon's plead with them to keep 
it quiet. What a shock that no one believes them. 
    And so the film runs around in circles with Betsy and Arlene continuing 
to accidentally uncover more dirt on the Watergate scandal without realizing 
it, while at the same time dealing with even more ridiculous subplots. For 
example, Arlene finds herself more attracted to Dick than Bobby Sherman, 
which I suppose could symbolize a more recent case of a young woman being 
attracted to the president, but just isn't believable at all. Then there's 
the factual events that are attempted to be explained through the girls' 
actions, such as their tipping off of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward 
(Ferrell) and Carl Bernstein (McCulloch). When the two call the `Commie 
muck-raking bastards' they think of it as a joke, yet go so far as to reveal 
the names on a CREEP list (`It must be a list of creeps' they say when they 
first find the list... stuck to G. Gordon Liddy's shoe!). Later, when they 
take the `prank' a step further, their pseudonym of `Deep Throat' comes from 
the porno movie Betsy's brother was caught attending.
    Much of the film is more of this material - corny, trite, unfunny satire 
that comes across as a comedy with a identity crisis problem. Is it a 
straight comedy? Is it an insightful satire? Having the girls' 
marijuana-laced cookies be the catalyst to many of Nixon's biggest decisions 
and accomplishments (withdrawing from Vietnam, avoiding a nuclear war with 
Russia) is a funny idea and sounds like something easy enough to carry out 
and have more zing than Miracle Whip mayonnaise, but it just doesn't happen. 
It doesn't even go the route of bawdiness or raunchiness, it's just plain 
boring (I laughed maybe four times at some slapstick jokes, but the other 
people in the theater didn't laugh at all). 
    It's easy to pin the blame on the film's co-writer and director Andrew 
Flemming for botching what should have been a cakewalk film, but that really 
wouldn't be an honest criticism. Instead, I think everyone is at fault here: 
the actors for failing miserably at their portrayals (as talented as Dunst 
and Williams may be, they never seem like high school students nor hippies) 
and the casting directors for making the film one big sitcom-star-o-rama; the 
costume, makeup and production crew for making the 1970s look a helluva lot 
like the 1990s; the music supervisor for using the same old soundtrack songs 
(it plays more like an homage to `Reservoir Dogs' than a real establishment 
of the music of the era); the cinematography for making the sheer look of the 
film drab and static... even the credits feel ripped-off from `Austin Powers' 
(there's thousands of fonts available, they couldn't find another one to 
use?)!
    Maybe there's just nothing left of the Nixon and hippie era worth 
spoofing.</P>
