<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A promising near-future, sci-fi adventure film, whose leaden direction,
weak acting, and incredibly inadequate set designs, cause the good
premise to collapse into an apocalyptic failure by the time the film was
resolved. This film should have been entertaining, but instead felt
tiresome. There was no fun to be had, no noteworthy dramatics, dialogue,
or story developed. What you got is Yul Brynner for most of the film
stripped of his shirt, fighting back against the street-people, either
knifing them to death or throwing them down a shaft.</P>
<P>The film opens in New York City in 2012 A.D., after an Atomic holocaust
caused a plague,
killing off most of the population and all of the food supply. The
streets are bare except for gangs who ravage anyone who wanders outside.
Max Von Sydow is The Baron, head of a commune that is on their last
legs, but is able to survive because of a scientist, Cal (Kelton), who
is able to cultivate seeds for vegetables. He is married to Baron's
daughter Melinda (Miles), who is expecting their child soon.</P>
<P>Yul Brynner is pictured as this giant, standing mute for days in front
of the library waiting for someone to make him an offer for his services
as a warrior. Baron and some members of his compound venture outside to
recruit Yul, offering him vegetables, a woman, and cigars. It will be
the cigars that seals the contract, as Yul joins the compound and helps
the men get safely back to their compound and past Carrot's (Smith)
street-people who attacked them.</P>
<P>When Yul tells Baron about an island off the coast of North Carolina
that he is heading for, Baron tells him this compound can't last too
much longer, it is difficult growing food on the roof, the commune
members are restless and unreliable, and Carrot's gang is too strong for
them, it is only a matter of time before they attack the gated compound
itself.</P>
<P>Baron tells Yul to take Cal and Melinda to that island through a secret
passage under one of the buildings on 29th street, and with the seeds
that Cal cultivated, he can start life anew there. But before the plan
can be implemented, Carrot's gang attacks Cal's tomato garden and throws
Cal off the roof. With Cal dead, Baron gets Yul and Melinda to secretly
leave immediately with all the seeds. When the compound discovers what
happened they crush Von Sydow to death.</P>
<P>The climax has Carrot and his boys going into the dark tunnel with
torches after Yul, Melinda, the seeds, and the baby boy Melinda has
while escaping. It is now up to Yul to get them to North Carolina.</P>
