Grade:  A-</PRE>
<P>Many geniuses have been misunderstood, but Andy Kaufman may be the only one who
made being misunderstood a goal.  Milos Forman's "Man on the Moon" chronicles
the career of the comedian.  Several of the reviews I read of the movie fussed
that Forman did not explain Andy.  These reviewers missed the point:  no one
could explain Andy, not even Andy.</P>
<P>As the movie begins, Andy's father finds young Andy facing the wall in his room
performing to an imaginary audience.  Even as a child, he lived his life on an
imaginary stage.  Grown up, Andy (Jim Carrey) plays the comedy clubs to mixed
reactions, but he catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro (Danny
DeVito), who manages to get Andy a part on the sitcom "Taxi."  Reluctantly,
Andy agrees with the condition that lounge singer Tony Clifton be a regular
guest star.  George goes to see Tony perform and is horrified by the singer's
belligerent attitude toward his audience.  Backstage, George discovers that
Tony is Andy in disguise.  The secret soon becomes public knowledge, and people
book Tony with the assumption that Andy will appear.  However, there's a joke
within the joke:  Andy's friend and collaborator Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti)
often performs as Tony.</P>
<P>"Man on the Moon" follows Andy through all his "greatest hits"-the Elvis
imitation, the Mighty Mouse routine on "Saturday Night Live," the rise and fall
of "Taxi," the aborted sketch on "Fridays," the wrestling matches with women,
and the fight with Jerry Lawler on the Letterman show-up to his untimely death
from cancer.  The movie feels episodic, jumping from memorable moment to
memorable moment, but this may be a result of how many outrageous and original
things Andy did in his brief career.</P>
<P>What makes the movie work is Jim Carrey's sensitive and subtle performance. 
I've never been impressed by Carrey's acting before, not even in "The Truman
Show."  However, in "Man on the Moon," he proves that his rubber face can
convey complex emotions.  Carrey's Andy is a mixture of a mischievous imp, a
driven artist, and a confused soul who is as much a prop in his own madcap
artform as everyone around him.  He laments to his love, Lynne Margulies
(Courtney Love), "Nobody knows the real me."  She responds, "There is no real
you."  Carrey's expression registers a combination of bemusement and horror as
he replies, "Oh yeah, I forgot."</P>
<P>The movie's best scene comes near the end as Andy travels to a ramshackle
clinic in the Philippines in search of a miracle cure for his cancer.  Pale,
bald, and confined to a wheelchair, Andy watches as another patient is treated;
the doctor plunges his fingers into the patient's abdomen and rips out a
handful of tissue.  The wound heals itself immediately.  After Andy takes his
place on the table, he can see that the doctor has the wad of tissue concealed
in his palm.  Even as his eyes register the hopelessness of his situation, Andy
laughs, realizing that life had finally played a prank on him.</P>
<P>Rather than attempting to explain Andy Kaufman and his unusual form of
performance art, "Man on the Moon" urges the viewer to contemplate the
questions posed by Andy's life:  Was there a point?  Did he know what it was? 
Why attracted him to playing creeps like Tony Clifton and the "bad-guy
wrestler"?  Did he want his audience to hate him?  Did he hate them?  Was his
life a joke in search of a punchline?</P>
<P>Wrestler Jerry "the King" Lawler plays himself in his bouts with Andy.  Other
players in the Kaufman saga appear briefly as themselves, including the cast of
"Taxi" minus DeVito (Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Judd Hirsch, Carol Kane, and
Christopher Lloyd), David Letterman and Paul Shaffer, Improv owner Budd
Friedman, and "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels. The real George Shapiro and Bob
Zmuda also have cameos, in addition to exec-producing the picture.</P>
<P>Director Forman and the writing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski
share a fondness for unusual biopics.  They previously collaborated on "The
People vs. Larry Flynt," a biography of the "Hustler" publisher.  In addition,
one of Forman's best films is "Amadeus," the story of Mozart, and Alexander and
Karaszewski wrote Tim Burton's "Ed Wood," about the "world's worst director." 
Somehow this strange group of bizarre personalities seems like the perfect
company for Andy Kaufman.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  A thought-provoking, funny, and poignant portrait of a comic
genius </P>
