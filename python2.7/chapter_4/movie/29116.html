<P>Susan Granger's review of "THE TRIANGLE" (TBS)</P>
<P>   The Bermuda Triangle, that dreaded area off the Florida coast where
countless mysterious disappearances have occurred, is the setting for the
original supernatural thriller, "The Triangle," set to premiere on Sunday,
August 12 at 8 p.m. (ET) on TBS Superstation. It's the story of a close group of
friends whose annual fishing trip to the Caribbean becomes a voyage of terror
when their boat enters the legendary Bermuda Triangle, where a mysterious ocean
liner, Queen of Scots, which disappeared 60 years ago, appears to pull them into
an abyss of horror.  Friendships shatter as the companions turn against each
other, in a spirit reminiscent of "The Shining."</P>
<P>   Luke Perry stars as the ring-leader, a junior exec living beyond his
means, with Dan Cortese as a lawyer who's been reading about the West Indies.
Polly Shannon plays Perry's dippy, insipid fiancee, who pleads, "Please, let's
go back," while David Hewlett mutters, "I haven't really decided what I want to
do when I grow up." Dorian Harewood is the hapless charter boat captain with
Olivia D'Abo as the first mate with the frightening gift of premonition. "Do you
think something can be evil, unto itself" she muses. "I believe everything
happens for a reason." </P>
<P>     Written by Ted Humphrey, directed by Lewis Teague, and filmed in
Barbados, it makes you grasp for the rational explanation for the dark,
tormented forces that are at work. Since he poses provocative questions and
attempts to answer them in a realistic way, perhaps Humphrey can be forgiven for
having his characters repeat, "I have a really bad feeling" so many times. On
the Granger Made-for-TV Movie Gauge, "The Triangle" is a spooky, scary 6. It
premieres Sun. but repeats next Wed., Sat. & Sun., along with Sat. & Sun., Aug.
25 & 26th.</P>
