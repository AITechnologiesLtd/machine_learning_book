<P>In anticipation of the John Irving adaptation `The Cider House Rules', I
imagine audiences were more skeptical than optimistic. Although Irving's
novels have been revised to big-screen format in such gems as `The World
According to Garp', the most recent example was the sentimental 1998
drama `Simon Birch' - a film that Irving reportedly detested to such a
degree that he wanted his name removed from the finished product. In
addition, the production of `The Cider House Rules' represents a 13-year
battle for theatrical redemption. But surely don't scoff and dismiss it
as another boring sentimental weeper, because `Cider House' actually
offers a touching human story with a finely textured dramatic impact. To
pass it up would not be a substantial mistake, but the experience is
light, moving and ultimately worth your while.</P>
<P>The story opens during the mid-1940's at an orphanage in St. Clouds,
Maine, where Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) has resided for his entire
life. Homer was denied admittance into the army because of a heart
defect, and so he has stayed to help the kindly old head physician Dr.
Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) conduct deliveries and illegal abortions.
When young couple Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and Air Force pilot
Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) arrive at St. Clouds with a request
for the latter, Homer spots an opportunity to depart and begin a life of
his own. Once out in the world, he is given his first view of the
rippling waves of the ocean and is graciously offered a job in an apple
orchard owned by Wally and his mother. Here, living in the Cider House
with Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his employees, Homer finds a
comfortable niche away from the orphanage. And when Lt. Worthington is
called into battle, a romantic subplot develops between Homer and Candy,
who (as it turns out) are hopelessly in love with each other.</P>
<P>Quite simply, `The Cider House Rules' is a movie of subplots. Another
particularly shocking one, involving Mr. Rose and his young daughter
(Erykah Badu), also culminates as the film reaches the meat of the story
during its second half. I suspect that, without these involving examples
of threading the central coming-of-age story together, the film could
have toppled altogether like a clumsy house of cards. The process of
evaluating Irving's novel to the fullest and discovering the morals and
values of Homer's journey is a somewhat overlong (and occasionally
aimless) exercise for director Lasse Hallstrom and company. Ultimately
though, the film peaks during the climactic moments in dramatic
satisfaction without even beginning to get excessive, and the rough
patches earlier are overcome by a string of marvelous performances from
a top-notch ensemble cast.</P>
<P>Maguire (`Pleasantville') is totally believable as the chief protagonist
in `The Cider House Rules', and his earlier scenes with Caine (shining
brightly in an Oscar-nominated performance) are among the most effective
in the film. Theron (the rising star of `Mighty Joe Young' and `The
Astronaut's Wife') is superbly convincing as the character of Candy, who
deals with grueling issues that will be easily related to. The remainder
of the cast (including the always forceful Delroy Lindo) deliver uniform
performances of greatness. Backed by a beautifully flowing musical score
by Rachel Portman and gorgeous cinematography courtesy of Oliver
Stapleton, `The Cider House Rules' moves melodiously until Homer's
journey has come to a close, offering several Kodak moments of poignancy
and good-natured humor along the journey.</P>
<P>Looking back on the film, I'm finding it difficult to properly interpret
some of the underlying messages that Hallstrom was attempting to
identify. At times, `The Cider House Rules' becomes a victim of its own
leisurely agenda - in hindsight, the cream filling is more tasteless
than it seemed as I was exiting the theater. But `Cider House' still
manages to win you over with its sublimely moving story, even if the
emotional depth you were hoping for never fully arises. John Irving
should be pleased with this finished product, and for that matter, so
should you. `The Cider House Rules' induces a rewarding smile as the
curtain closes, and that seems sufficient enough.</P>
