<PRE>                              SABRINA (1995)
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This remake of the 1953 Bogart/Hepburn classic starts off 
with humor and charm but crashes and burns toward the end, when 
too many conflicts and motivations are resolved too quickly, leaving a 
multitude of unanswered questions in the air. Harrison Ford plays rich 
businessman Linus, who is constantly terrorized by his bitchy sister 
Lucy... No, not really, but he does have an irresponsible younger 
brother named David (played by talk show host Greg Kinnear), who is 
currently engaged to equally wealthy Elizabeth (DUMB AND 
DUMBER's Lauren Holly), whose father is planning a billion-dollar 
merger with Linus' company, which manufactures security blankets... 
No, not really.</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, lovely Sabrina (Julia Ormond), daughter of the 
family chauffeur, returns from a few months in Paris looking more 
beautiful than ever. David finds himself mysteriously drawn to 
Sabrina, who has been obsessed with him all her life but never got the 
time of day from him (because he doesn't wear a watch). David lets 
everyone in on his newfound attraction right before a painful glass-in-
the-ass injury. Linus takes advantage of David's incapacitation to 
begin wooing Sabrina himself. Is he diverting her attention for 
personal or business reasons? The movie keeps us guessing on that one 
until the end.</P>
<P>        SABRINA, at two hours and ten minutes, is way too long. 
There's no such thing as an epic comedy, so why are they trying to 
pass this off as one? It's too top-heavy, with unnecessary scenes in the 
first hour involving Sabrina's Paris transformation from mousy to 
lovely and David's attraction to her upon her return. Still, I shouldn't 
complain. These scenes may be superfluous but they're the scenes in 
which the movie works best.</P>
<P>        It's toward the end, with all the rapid-fire plot twists and the 
Linus-Is-A-Prick...-Or-Is-He? scenes, that the movie tries to jerk 
around our emotions. Well, I don't know about you, but my emotions 
refuse to be jerked. I was looking for logic instead, and found none. I 
walked out of the theater asking all sorts of questions about why those 
characters waffled more in the last twenty minutes than President 
Clinton and a family-sized box of Eggo's combined.</P>
<P>        Granted, there are a lot of funny lines in the movie, mostly 
found in that first hour. That's the part where you think you know the 
characters and their motivations, before the movie pulls the rug out 
from under you. Harrison Ford, as always, delivers a good 
performance, as does Ormond, although I can't imagine why on earth 
any man would choose her over the devastatingly beautiful Holly. (I'd 
like to deck my halls with boughs of that... I don't know what that 
means, but it sounds chauvinist enough.)</P>
<P>        The big surprise of the movie is Kinnear, who claims to have 
had no prior acting experience (although pretending to tolerate 
Richard Simmons when he comes on your show is Emmy-quality as 
far as I'm concerned). I've had my eye on this guy since his hilarious 
between-clip commentary on E.'s "Talk Soup" show. He left that show, 
sadly--as his replacement is a cross between Jim Carrey and every 
pathetic small-town news anchor to ever live--and got a late-late night 
talk show on NBC which, also sadly, showcases no real talent on his 
part. It's in SABRINA where he truly shines for the first time, showing 
a great talent for both comedic and dramatic acting, even if he is 
unconscious for half the movie. Mark my words, that Kinnear kid has 
a future in Hollywood!</P>
