<PRE>                                    GRAND CANYON
                       A film review by Richard John Rauser
                        Copyright 1992 Richard John Rauser</PRE>
<P>     Before I saw GRAND CANYON someone told me that "it's just like THE
FISHER KING."  Which, in my opinion, was a strong recommendation.</P>
<P>     Well, I just saw GRAND CANYON.  And it was nothing like THE FISHER
KING.  THE FISHER KING was a brilliant movie.  GRAND CANYON, on the
other hand, was bland, yuppie trash.</P>
<P>     I won't bore you with a detailed summary of the events in this
stupid film, but to put it simply, this movie deals with the inner
emotional and spiritual struggles of a group of yuppies who try to come
to terms with their inner feelings.  (Don't ask me what that's supposed
to mean -- ask the nearest yuppie if you can pull him away from his
cappucino; I hope I misspelled that).  [You did.  -Moderator]</P>
<P>     While THE FISHER KING was a deep and powerful film on many levels,
GRAND CANYON is shallow and nauseating on many levels.  In one scene,
Kevin Kline's wife (Kevin plays a wealthy lawyer who, in spite of all
his material comforts, feels a gnawing, emotional restlessness.  I also
felt a gnawing restlessness -- in my stomach) finds an abandoned baby
while jogging.  Later, as she weeps pitifully, she tries to convince a
reluctant Kevin that they should adopt the baby.  She says to him, "You
think I want to adopt this baby because there's something missing in my
life, but it's not true!  This baby was brought to us by fate!"</P>
<P>     At this point several middle-aged women pulled out hankies.  I
pulled out a vomit bag.</P>
<P>     Danny Glover is equally sickening as sweet, wise, intelligent,
all-around *perfect* garage mechanic who is so introspective and so in
touch with his feelings that you'd swear the guy moonlights as a
spiritual guru somewhere in east Asia.  </P>
<P>     Naturally, the black working-class Danny (who of course has no
problems of his own to work out) helps the white, yuppie Kevin to come
in touch with his own feelings.  The male bonding between these two is
quite sickening -- not because there's anything wrong with male bonding,
but because the way this film does it you'd think that it's a growing
trend in the Nineties, like Rubick's Cube or skateboards.</P>
<P>     Of course, GRAND CANYON has the done-to-death theme of racist cops.
At one point Danny's young nephew is running along the sidewalk when,
for no reason, two L.A. cops pull a gun on him, yell at him and call
him names, and push him to the pavement.  They promptly slap on the
cuffs.  Several middle aged women in the audience slowly shook their
heads, oooing and aaahing at what a horrible, wretched, twisted
society we live in.  If the kind of trash that GRAND CANYON spouts is
true, no wonder people aren't in touch with their feelings -- they're too
busy being harassed by Nazi cops.  The middle-aged men in the audience
weren't oooing and aaahing; they were too busy pondering their own inner
struggles in light of this amazing film.</P>
<P>     Of course, just so the script writers can't be accused of being
*tooooo* biased, they threw in a nice cop.  In the most disgusting,
nauseating scene you'll have to endure in this glitzy piece of garbage,
this nice cop says to a weeping young woman (who plays Kevin Kline's
secretary in the film -- she's crying because he won't have an affair
with her) "I just haven't found the right girl...yet."  She eyes him
with stunned adoration.</P>
<P>     Most of the people in the theater leapt from their seats at this
point crying, "See?  You can still find love!  Even in the Nineties!"  I
wanted to hiss, "The Nineties have just started, you friggin' idiot!  What
makes them so unique!?!?!"  But I was too busy heaving into my vomit bag
for the second time.</P>
<P>     Steve Martin is quite good in this film, but only because he
parodies the million-dollar yuppie character that Kevin Kline glorifies.
However, Steve's character doesn't "get in touch with his feelings" and
we're left to mourn him by the movie's end for his, uh, spiritual
isolation (I guess).</P>
<P>     This movie ends with a scene so sentimental you'll want to
telephone Mom and Pop: the main characters all journey to the GRAND
CANYON (except for Steve's character -- we're busy weeping at his moral
decay, remember?  He doesn't get to come along on this feel-good
spiritual trip) and gaze with wonder and awe at the natural spectacle
before them.  In light of it all, (says Danny Glover) their own problems
seem rather small.</P>
<P>     Then the credits came up.  Credits have never looked so good.  I
leapt up from my chair and hurried out, making my way carefully past the
countless yuppie couples who were either in tears or excitedly
discussing amongst themselves how this movie must have come straight
from Mt. Sinai.  All I was thinking about, however, was how two hours
of my life had just been stolen from me.  I wanted to sue for damages.</P>
<P>     I still can't get over how that blasphemous fool I talked to
compared this movie to THE FISHER KING.  THE FISHER KING was a
brilliant, brilliant, brilliant film.  It was stunning in its emotional
power and amazing in its philosophical depth.</P>
<P>     GRAND CANYON, by contrast, was like a sentimental, two-hour episode
of MIAMI VICE: ridiculous in its attempt at being deep, and sinking
under the depth of its own pseudo-philosophical weight.  IF  you're a
yuppie who is itching to understand what the "Nineties are all about"
and are dying to get in touch with your inner karma, this film is for
you.</P>
<PRE>     Otherwise, avoid.</PRE>
