<PRE>                THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>        A powerful business tycoon dreams up an ingenious scheme to
assassinate the Queen of England at a baseball game.  And only one man can
stop him.  James Bond?  Guess again.  The Equalizer?  Nope!  Give up?  Try
Leslie Nielsen, a.k.a. Frank Drebin, the bumbling cop from the short-lived
TV series "Police Squad."  That's right, "Police Squad" is back and ready
for action, this time as a movie from the team that brought us AIRPLANE,
TOP SECRET, RUTHLESS PEOPLE, and--of course--"Police Squad."  Their movie
THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD! reunites most of the
original cast from the TV series and features the type of madcap, slapstick
humor we've come to expect from Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David
Zucker.</P>
<P>        Although THE NAKED GUN has more laughs than most comedies would
dream of, it fails to duplicate the magic of the team's previous efforts.
Since AIRPLANE, Abrahams and the Zucker brothers have used the same formula
so many times now that it has lost its novelty and become cliched.  Many of
the jokes in THE NAKED GUN not only lack originality, but also get repeated
over and over and over again.  The first time Leslie Nielsen pulls up to
the curb and crashes into something is mildly amusing, if uninspired; by
the seventh time, the gag has grown so stale it makes you want to ... gag.</P>
<P>        The first half of the movie strings together a series of non-stop
gags one after another, half of which fizzle.  The second half, to its
credit, slows down and has some extremely inventive and hysterical
sequences.</P>
<P>        The actors in THE NAKED GUN deserve credit for their solid comic
performances in the face of an uneven script.  Leslie ("Don't call me
Shirley") Nielsen is as loveable and inept as ever as Officer Drebin,
Ricardo Montalban is appropriately despicable as the conniving tycoon, and
Priscilla Presley as Nielsen's love-interest lights up the screen with her
humor and sex appeal.  The movie's clever cameos also keep things rolling.</P>
<P>        Although it may pale in comparison to a masterpiece such as
AIRPLANE, THE NAKED GUN is by no means a failure.  The movie easily has
enough successful gags and honest laughs for me to recommend it to any fan
of the Zuckers/Abrahams sense of humor.</P>
