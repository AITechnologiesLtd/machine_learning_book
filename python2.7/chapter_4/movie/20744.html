<P>Run Lola Run could have been the new Pulp Fiction. It breathed life
and electricity into a genre that seemed dead, or to most people,
didn't even know existed. To write about it is to remember it's pulse,
it's quick, lightning like photography and sound that rarely stopped,
only to catch it's breath, then moved and ran, ran, ran - until at
the end of the movie you were exhausted. As odd or cliche as this may
sound, I left the theater catching my breath - feeling awkward that I
was walking home rather than running.</P>
<P>Set to techno music, a rhythmic force of dance and action, the movie
was paced like a cheetah running after it's prey. To sit still to it
seemed unnatural. It blends animation, violence, love, revelation and
hysterical action in an 85 minute movie. Five minutes of Lola is more
entertaining than two hours of any recent Hollywood action film. The
story is that Lola's boyfriend Manni, a drug dealer who has
idiotically lost $100,000 on a subway, has 20 minutes to get it back
or face death from the dealers. Lola runs to help him, thinking up
different ways to get the money and avoiding pitfalls.  Lola is a
wonderful character, a new heroine that stands up to old female
cliches, screams and shatters them. It's impossible to forget the
vision of her running - red-hair like a fire on her head, running
through the streets of Germany to save her boyfriends life.</P>
<P>Along the way, we see how split-second decisions and actions affect
the rest of our lives. A boy offers to sell Lola his bike while she
runs. She refuses, then immediately see several snapshots of him being
mugged, beaten up, pity taken on him by a woman, and getting married
to her. Tykwer makes a convincing life in the span of ten
pictures. Snap, snap, snap, snap is your life. Depressing.</P>
<P>This is style merging effortlessly with substance. You couldn't have
one without the other; the plot would die without Tykwer's
speed-induced direction. But the direction is fun and plausible,
instead of being a headache, because the setup presents a good
life-or-death situation. It wastes no time to grab in an
audience. Anything that seems out of place 0r silly is ignored because
the movie goes too quickly to realize what is happening. Snap, snap,
snap and the story jumps from a person who tells Lola to "Fuck Off"
and then shows that woman's life.</P>
<P>That the movie wasn't more of a success in America surprises me. It is
young and paced towards the 15-30 crowd, marketing's money darlings,
the same crowd that producers created half of the past ten years of
movies for. It offered many of the same qualities that made Pulp
Fiction such a breakout.  It was new, or seemed new anyway, with a
direction and flash that inspired countless filmmakers to make direct
photocopies. Audiences didn't seem to mind either, making Pulp Fiction
and it's subsequent ripoffs lots of money.  Lola also seemed to be
fresh, in a different sort of way, but still fresh.</P>
<P>While it was a foreign film, complete with American-hated subtitles,
this could have been overcome with a wide release and any sort of
marketing campaign. Just a few trailers could have sparked
interested. The success of this film was due solely to work of
mouth. It played in independent theaters (the one I saw it in offered
pillows to replace the dilapidated seat cushions). However, Lola
wasn't given a wide release and suffered. What could have been a Blair
Witch Project, was instead made into an Afterlife.</P>
