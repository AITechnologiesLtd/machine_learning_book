<PRE>THE DEVILS ADVOCATE
Review By David Wilcock (C)1998</PRE>
<P>Running Time: 145 minutes (2 hours 25 mins)
Starring Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino and Charliz Theron
Directed By Taylor Hackford</P>
<P>You can see straight away why Pacino decided to play the role of
John Milton in this below average shocker. That's because, of
course, he gets to play Satan himself, complete with rantings,
sticking out of tongue and menacing eyes. Sadly, although Pacino
seems to be having a good time with this film (probably because he
is getting paid to shout and scream), there is hardly any
entertainment here for the audience at all.</P>
<P>Reeves plays hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax, who has never
lost a case. After successfully defending a school teacher accused
of sexually abusing a schoolgirl, he is approached by an employee
of Milton law firm, who offer Lomax a job. Lomax accepts,
unaware that his boss, John Milton, is the Devil, played well, if a
bit over the top, by Pacino. Kevin's wife Mary Ann (Theron)
reliases that Milton is the devil long before Kevin does, but she
slowly goes crazy and then dies. It's then up to Kevin to confront
Milton in a showdown complete with shouting and over the top
special effects. </P>
<P>The entire film is directed in a slapdash fashion by Hackford, with
many scenes looking messy, and badly planned and directed. The
acting, apart from Pacino, isn't too good either. Reeves is rubbish,
with his Florida accent disappearing and reappearing every so
often. Sometimes, he even seems to be mumbling his lines, with the
audience unable to work out what he is saying. And his face can't
show emotion, so we never really know what he's thinking or
feeling. Finally, all his lines are said in the same tone of voice, much
like David Duchovney of X-Files fame. Theron is marginally
better, but she dosen't really have to do much in the film, apart
from act mad, and cry a little. In fact, she is pretty much wasted in
the film, serving no real purpose whatsoever.</P>
<P>It's up to Pacino, then, to carry the film, and when he's on screen,
the film picks up. He seems to be having such a good time, the
audience starts to enjoy themselves aswell. Sadly, as soon as he's
off the screen, it's back to watching Reeves, who is boring,
unintresting, and totally inferior to Pacino. Also, the supporting cast
are unremarkable, with average performances from Jeffrey Jones
(Beetlejuice, 1988) and Craig T. Nelson (Poltergeist, 1982).
Even the god worshipping, religous character (in this case Kevin's
mother), usually hillarous in horror movies, is dully played by Judith
Ivey. </P>
<P>Another problem with the film is that it can't make out what genre
it wants to be. The title, The Devils Advocate, immediatly
conjures up images of a horror movie. But the bulk of the film is
based on a court case, so The Devils Advocate is one of the
wierdist mish-mash of genres ever, the courtroom-horror. The
problem, though, is that the courtroom sequences are basic, and
the horror just isn't scary. The film should of made it's mind on
what genre it was going to be, and stuck to it.</P>
<P>Apart from Pacino's performance, there is one other thing that
saves the film from getting a one star rating. And it is, amazingly,
the special effects. Usually, effects make a film worse, but here,
they actually make the film better. They are subtle, actually quite
disturbing, and great fun. Sadly, there is some effect overkill during
the last twenty minutes, but they are used throughout the rest of the
film very well. </P>
<P>The Devils Advocate, then, is not scary, not exciting, and
generally just not very good. As a vehicle for Pacino, it's perfect.
As an entertaining horror movie, or even courtroom drama, it falls
flat on it's face, due to poor scripting and underwritten, and
underplayed, characters (apart from Milton, of course). The
Devils Advocate, then, is hugely dissapoiting. </P>
<PRE>OVERALL=** out of ***** (2 out of 5)</PRE>
