<P>     Jane Austen, considered by many literary critics to be among the
first of the "modern" writers, is perhaps best known for creating
believable, strong-willed, independent female characters in an era when
women in books were often little more than window dressing or plot
devices.  Although remembered primarily for her alliterative titles,
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Austen authored six
major novels, including that upon which this film is based, PERSUASION.</P>
<P>     Those horrified by Roland Joffe's looser-than-loose
"interpretation" of Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER will be overjoyed to
learn that cinematic faithfulness to classic novels is not a dead art.
Not only does PERSUASION remain true to Austen's story, but Nick Dear's
script, as brought to the screen by director Roger Michell, conveys a
sense of atmosphere and "feeling" that a less-adept adaptation might
lose.</P>
<P>     PERSUASION opens in early 19th century England (1814, to be
precise), in the wake of war with France.  Across the Channel, Napoleon
has abdicated and been confined to Elba, and British servicemen are
returning home.  Among them is Captain Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran
Hinds), a navy officer who has been away for more than eight years since
his marriage proposal to then-19-year old Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) was
refused.  Now, almost a decade later, Anne lives in a state of constant
regret, attempting to fill an empty life through her selfless devotion
to family and friends.  However, although she remains without either
husband or suitors, circumstances have decreed that she has not seen the
last of the one true love of her life.</P>
<P>     Even though the subject material of the film might sound like the
stuff of a Harlequin romance, PERSUASION has far greater depth than any
dime store soap opera.  The movie offers not only keen insights on the
lasting, and agonizing, effects of love, but explores the theme of
consequences.  While the hand of fate can be seen working throughout,
the characters' circumstances are ultimately the result of their own
choices and actions.  Anne is responsible for her unhappiness, and, when
an opportunity arises to redress her past error, she must seize it or
lose Frederick forever.  The barrier to overcome is the deep emotional
scarring created by her decision of eight years ago.</P>
<P>     To a lesser extent, PERSUASION also works as a social commentary.
The film takes aim at the pre-Victorian society in which it is set--a
social structure that encouraged the empty words of sycophants over true
expressions of friendship.  Many of the characters are cloaked in
artifice, and it's only as their real motives are uncovered that we
learn of their duplicity and superciliousness.  Michell uses some of
this shallowness to comic effect through the fatuous presentation of
characters like Anne's father (Corin Redgrave) and sister Elizabeth
(Phoebe Nichols).  It's men and women like this that draw our sympathy
towards those who are honest and straightforward, like Anne and
Frederick.</P>
<P>     The fine cast is populated by members of England's Royal
Shakespeare Company.  Amanda Root, who has the main role, is a
revelation with her natural manner of conveying complex emotions.
Root's most obvious assets are her expressive eyes, which display
everything from longing and pain to surprise and joy.  The actress
brings a captivating mix of dignity, charm, and willfulness to Anne.
Her co-star, Ciaran Hinds, illustrates Frederick's deeply-buried
torment, both when it's repressed and when it comes bubbling to the
surface.  These two actors command our attention, especially when they
share a scene.  Also, a few somewhat-familiar faces, like Sophie
Thompson, Corin Redgrave, and John Woodvine, have supporting parts.</P>
<P>     Occasionally in the past, I have compared British-produced period
pieces to episodes of PBS's MASTERPIECE THEATER.  In this case, it's
more than a comparison, since PERSUASION is due to be shown on that
program in 1996.  Like nearly all MASTERPIECE presentations, this one
boasts impeccable production values.  Its faithfulness to the source
material results in a few slow spots, but PERSUASION is nevertheless
fine entertainment.  And, at a time when most love stories involve
copious displays of skin, it's a rare pleasure to see so much emotion
brought to the screen by a single kiss.</P>
