<P>     Back in 1992, there was a thriller about a cook aboard a Navy 
vessel who got stuck with the job of stopping a bunch of generic 
terrorists.  All-in-all, the film wasn't great, but sizable portions 
were redeemed by the wonderfully over-the-top performance of Tommy Lee 
Jones.  Of course, the good guy was played by Steven Segal, the macho 
man with the frozen expression.  Now, for a reason that has more to do 
with Segal's ego than a creative impulse, the unsuspecting action-loving 
public has just had UNDER SIEGE 2 foisted upon it.  Those that thought 
DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE was a disappointment had better be prepared 
for the worst. </P>
<P>     Of course, it's a well-known fact that Segal can't act (or direct, 
for that matter; however, I'll leave ON DEADLY GROUND out of this), but 
he's far from the only thing wrong with this sorry excuse for a sequel.  
>From start to finish, the script is stupid, the direction is spotty, the 
editing is choppy, and the special effects make DOCTOR WHO's notoriously 
cheesy visuals look like flawless masterpieces.  This movie is putrid.   </P>
<P>     Back from UNDER SIEGE is ex-SEAL operative Casey Ryback (Segal), 
the man who cooks with one hand while defeating bad guys with the other.  
This time, he's on a train trip with a pretty niece (Katherine Heigl, 
turning in a performance as bland as the one from MY FATHER THE HERO).  
There's been a family tragedy (Casey's brother is dead), but the details 
are glossed over because the introduction has already begun to drag.  
Meanwhile, a nutcase named Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) has taken over a 
super-secret, invincible weapons satellite and, after devastating China 
with a blast, he turns it on Washington D.C.  Needing a mobile base of 
operations, Travis and his henchmen decide to take over the train 
Casey's on, so that's where the so-called action takes place.  This 
mostly consists of Segal running through lots of empty train cars, 
finding inept bad guys and either stabbing them, blowing their heads 
off, or throwing them from the train. </P>
<P>     As a villain, Eric Bogosian lacks a certain panache.  To his 
credit, the actor tries to foam at the mouth and do all the other 
requisite things necessary for the audience to hiss at him, but he just 
doesn't manage it.  Everett McGill (TWIN PEAKS) as his sidekick isn't 
much better.  As far as villains go, these guys don't have it.  They're 
boring.  Who cares that they intend to kill 8 million people? </P>
<P>     During the course of the film, there are three incidents when our 
stalwart hero seems to be in a little bit of trouble, but terrible 
visual effects make these more amusing than tense.  And then there's the 
big, joyous conclusion, complete with applause -- talk about cornball.  
This makes SCENT OF A WOMAN's grand finale look restrained.  The whole 
production might have made a wonderfully campy ride if director Geoff 
Murphy hadn't taken things so seriously. </P>
<P>     I have come to the conclusion that it's impossible for a Steven 
Segal movie to be anything better than mediocre, and this particular 
travesty may be his worst yet.  The title UNDER SIEGE is supposed to 
represent the situation faced by Segal's character, but it's equally 
appropriate in describing the experience of the poor viewer who sits 
through this film.   </P>
