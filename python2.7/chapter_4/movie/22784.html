<P>"Galaxy Quest" is a funny and clever spoof on "Star Trek" and its many spin-
offs. After seeing numerous television programs and movies imitating William
Shatner's bizarre speech patterns, this is the only film that overtly satirizes
the whole crew, the ship, the aliens, the trekkies and the gadgets of the
infamous 1960's television show. Don't be mistaken, there are plenty of Shatner
jokes in "Galaxy Quest" but the film is more than just a simple mockery; it is
as much a derision of "Star Trek" as it is a celebration of the show's
longevity. My mom, a serious trekkie who also saw the film, found it more
amusing then I did mainly because the film holds countless inside jokes
designed specifically for die hard fans. The film is still enjoyable to those
who do not appreciate "Star Trek" not only because it contains several
intelligent jokes that everyone should understand, but also because it has a
great deal of exciting action and adventure elements. </P>
<P>The acting in the film is very light and an enjoyable alternative to the
heavily dramatic performances from the likes of Matt Damon's Tom Ripley or
Denzel Washington's Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. The actors are having fun playing
their parts and because of their mirthful attitudes, the audience has the same
amount of fun watching them. Playing actors who star in "Galaxy Quest" a
popular sci-fi show of the past, the cast is full of stereotypes immediately
identifiable with those on "Star Trek." Tim Allen is perfect as the pretentious
Shatner captain who always receives credit for a job well done. Allen is
basically doing a live action Buzz Lightyear, which is fine because he is so
good at it. Sigourney Weaver plays your traditional scantily dressed crew
member whose only real purpose on the show is to look beautiful and to attract
male viewers. Weaver makes her character work, although it would have been nice
to see her break out of the constant sexism she faces at all times. The biggest
surprise from the cast was Alan Rickman's hilarious performance as a Spock-like
character who is tired of saying the same "Live Long and Prosper"- like one
liner. Rickman shows that these actors are forever doomed to their characters
on "Galaxy Quest," they can never have another role again without the
comparison of "Galaxy Quest" by their audience. The rest of the cast is
enjoyable, including Sam Rockwell as the paranoid unnamed actor who dies on the
show before the opening commercials. Although Rockwell tended to overact at
times, like he did in "The Green Mile," he certainly has his moments especially
towards the end. </P>
<P>"Galaxy Quest" does an excellent job grabbing the viewer's attention with a
memorable opening scene set at a sci-fi convention. The movie not only
perfectly satirizes "Star Trek" episodes and characters, but it also portrays
fanatics with perfect accuracy. Once the actors actually go into space to fight
real life combat against real evil bad guys, the momentum dies down a bit,
especially when compared to its opening twenty minutes. However, the film
remains constantly enjoyable and humorous. "Galaxy Quest" is a short and
refreshing break from the myriad of three hour movies releasing for Oscar
consideration. This is a must see for Trekkies.</P>
