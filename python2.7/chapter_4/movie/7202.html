<PRE>                               MEDITERRANEO
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>This is a most entertaining, charming anti-war film that willenchant
you with its simple story and its beautiful photography.</P>
<P>A decrepit Italian warship is sent for no apparent good reason (during
WWII) to an insignificant Greek Island to capture it.  When the ship
arrives with its crew of ordinary, unwarlike Italian young men, they
find the island deserted. . . or so they think.  When their one radio
gets broken, their only contact with Italy and the outside world, they
have no way of knowing or caring about what is happening elsewhere.</P>
<P>Happily, they have discovered the island does have inhabitants.  The
young men of the island have been removed some time ago by the
Germans.  Only the women and some old men remain.   From this simple
premise the director has made a most delightful film which without
being preachy demonstrates the folly of war.  A real winner.</P>
<P>The film stars Diego Abatantuono, Claudio Biagli, Giuseppi Cederna and
Claudio Bisio.</P>
<PRE>In Italian with English subtitles.</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Gabriele Salvatores</PRE>
