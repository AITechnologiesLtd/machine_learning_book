<P>Cheer up.  This time you won't see the actors lips moving before or
after their out of synch dialogue.  This production of 'Godzilla' is a
high tech marvel from the team of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich who
brought 'Independence Day' to movie screens in 1996.</P>
<P>Inspired by the revolutionary special effects of 1993's 'Jurassic Park',
'Godzilla', plain and simple, is a popcorn movie that is beyond the high
brow realm of major criticism and is one of those movie's that despite
the rigid criticism it will receive for its uneven concoction of action
and character fluff, still offers the pleasant and familiar cliches of
an electrifying monster movie.</P>
<P>A geographical map is displayed during the film's opening credits as we
see the South Pacific location of French Polynesia and the nuclear tests
being conducted by the French government in and around that region that
have been going for some 30 odd years or so and the genetic mutant of
the experiments gone awry is, or course, 'Godzilla'.  The first sign of
his existence comes at the expense of a Japanese boat crew who get
demolished one night in the Pacific Ocean and a member of the French
Secret Service (Jean Reno), confronts one of the survivors who describes
the eerie tale on videotape which later comes out.  The initial story is
also set up through a scene in Chernobyl, Ukraine where a nuclear
containment specialist named Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is
measuring the effects of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster on earth worms and
discovers that a number of them are 17% larger than they were were
before the nuclear fallout and later applies this theory of nuclear
contamination to explain the Godzilla phenomenon.  Nick is re-assigned
from his current exploration of Chernobyl to other locations where signs
of the giant lizard appear and eventually come to fulfillment in the Big
Apple.  New York City is the perfect playground for the monster as
Manhattan is an island where the creature can roam at will on either
land or in the water.</P>
<P>The New York characters are stereotypical of the city that never
sleeps.  An aspiring and bubbly attractive young t.v. reporter named
Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) and a camera man name Animal (Hank
Azaria) from the station she works at, work together despite the
objections of Animal's wife Lucy (Arabella Field) to get involved in the
Godzilla frenzy when all hell breaks loose.  Audrey is perceived as a
sex toy by a sleazy local anchor man (Harry Shearer) who refuses to give
her the big break in television reporting she so desperately wants.  She
and Matthew Broderick's character were old college flames who meet each
other during the breaking story and they rekindle their feelings for
each other in a somewhat awkward manner.</P>
<P>The NYC Mayor (Michael Lerner) and the leader of a crack military
operation (Kevin Dunn) exchange sparring words of conflict over the
handling of Godzilla's destruction and the movie glides along, somewhat
unevenly, during the attempts at dialogue the all around characters
exchange.</P>
<P>There are many scenes delivered in much of the same way they were
showcased in 'Independence Day'.  There are several scenes where the
military men go after the beast by air power and bombard it with
gunfire, missiles and other tactics as we witnessed in the attack of the
mother ship in ID.</P>
<P>Roland Emmerich directs 'Godzilla' in a typical way we've seen from time
to time where the creator doesn't want you to see the beast in its full
form as Steven Spielberg demonstrated in 'Jaws' where the shark wasn't
completely visible until well into its running time.  We see Godzilla's
tail, his foot, his eye, his head, all edited in quick and scattered
shots of temptation before the big show.  His rampage through New York
City is furious and heavy as several landmark buildings are destroyed
and Godzilla marks his territory with the next generation of lizards in
the form of unhatched eggs which work their way into the plot rather
well to give the film some meaning in its second half.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin isn't really clever
enough to offer any real surprises.  The film is an all out display of
big studio dollars spent during the first of many summer months to draw
a large crowd of movie goers who hopefully will enjoy a film that based
on its well established name, will self by itself.</P>
