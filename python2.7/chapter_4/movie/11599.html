<P>By it's very nature, Tomorrow Never Dies is a film that invites
comparisons.  The film itself with earlier Bond pictures, Pierce Brosnan
with Sean Connery and Roger Moore, the Bond car and gadgets of today
with those of yesteryear...  the list goes on.  And I think it's a fun
game to play, if you're into that sort of thing.</P>
<P>But if we're going to make comparisons...</P>
<P>Is Tomorrow Never Dies a better film than The Peacemaker?</P>
<P>I think that's a fair question.  All of the Bond heritage aside, we
still have to judge Tomorrow Never Dies on its merits rather than on its
illustrious predecesors.  By that standard, Tomorrow Never Dies is a
middle-rung action movie, nothing more.</P>
<P>Tomorrow Never Dies employs the same basic plot foundation as The
Peacemaker -- an irresponsible madman has control of a nuclear device
and plans to explode it to further an irrational agenda.  (Given the
relative stability of geopolitics nowadays, this seems to be the most
popular plotline going.  Mission: Impossible and True Lies used similar
nuclear plots, and  it's even used, in a backhanded, satirical way, in
the current Wag The Dog.)   However, the villian in Tomorrow Never Dies
is a megolamaniacal news tycoon (Jonathan Pryce) whose true enemy is, in
fact, CNN.  His ultimate weapon is a "stealth boat" which can't be seen
on radar, has video teleconference capability, and is much bigger on the
inside than the outside.  And he's trying to start a war between Great
Britain and China to increase TV ratings.  And...</P>
<P>I'm sorry, the plot is just too ridiculous for words.  It really is.
There's just so much about it that's implausible and quite a bit that
doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  It just ambles along with motorcycle
chases and car chases and whatnot until the final confrontation between
Bond and this Rupert Murdoch guy. (I won't tell you who wins.)</P>
<P>Tomorrow Never Dies is a formula movie.  And there's nothing
intrinsically wrong with that, mind you.  It's just that if you're going
to make a formula movie, it needs to have something extra to
differentiate it from the other formula movies out there -- and by
itself, vodka-martini-shaken-not-stirred dialogue and Pierce Brosnan's
suave performance don't cut it.  To its credit, Tomorrow Never Dies does
try to shake up the formula by adding Michelle Yeoh, best known in the
States as a Jackie Chan sidekick. (Or "sidechick"?)  Unfortunately,
she's not given nearly enough opportunity to flex her kung-fu muscles,
and the one scene where she does get to stomp some bad guys looks
tacked-on.</P>
<P>All that aside, though, this is still a James Bond movie, which means
that things are done with class.  Brosnan's 007 has made everyone forget
about Timothy Dalton -- and maybe even Roger Moore.  The chase scenes
are well-done, although they're not compelling.  The plot is nonsense,
but it's well-photographed and well-staged nonsense.  The Bond support
team (M, Q, Moneypenny) do a workmanlike job, as does Teri Hatcher in a
brief role.</P>
<P>So, to answer my question, is Tomorrow Never Dies better than The
Peacemaker?  Let's put it this way:  does anybody want to see George
Clooney in seventeen sequels?</P>
