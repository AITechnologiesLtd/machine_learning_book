                        REVIEW: LONE STAR (1996)</PRE>
<P>        Finally got around to see "Lone Star."  It's hard to find a word
to describe it since I'm still totally overwhelmed, awestruck.  I guess
the word is "BIG", like a huge object struck in my face.  It's a funny way
to describe a movie, but my still-pounding heart can prove my reaction to
it.  It's perhaps the most complicated film I've seen since I saw
"Chinatown" last year (on video of course).  </P>
<P>        The central character Sam Deeds (Christ Cooper), is the new
sheriff in a small Texas town.  Early on we are told that his deceased 
father, Buddy Deeds (Matthew McConnaghey), was a legend in this town
carrying the same badget 40 years ago.  Yet somehow Sam's resentment to
him and certain rumors about Buddy's old deeds make us wonder.  This
suspicion is backed by a skeleton discovered in the deserted area outside
the town that belongs to the town's sheriff before Buddy, the much feared
and hated Charley Wade (Kris Kristofferson), an old fashioned small-town
sheriff who's done every bad thing you've heard of in western movies, from
squeezing money from local business (legal or otherwise) to killing
whoever he feels like.  Haunted by his own emotional baggage, Sam digs
into the whole murder business, trying to tear down the idol worshiped by
the town, and the deeper he goes, the more skeletons come to see the
daylight.  </P>
<P>        In the mean time, we get to know a couple of other families in
town, including Sam's high school lover Pilar (Elizabeth Pena), a widowed
school teacher, and her mother, plus Otis Payne, an old black bar owner
who may have witnessed the murder 40 years ago, and Colonal Payne, Otis'
son who has his own problems with his father.  And that's just the main
players in this movie.  It is impossible to recap the plot in a couple of
paragraphs so I might as well give up trying.  It's simply dazzling to
create such intricate and interwound storyline within a seemingly "usual"
plot of a murder mystery.  What's more mind-boggling, however, is the deep
and complex emotional relationship between the characters, which is
presented clearly, delicately, smoothly and subtly.  There are a handful
of parallel storylines connected with each other by the long-passed
murder, linking both the past and the present.  </P>
<P>        And just when you think it can't get any more complicated, the
writer/director/producer John Sayles stuffs in more social commentary
about racism and racial division, corrupt politics, people's tendency to
make legends out of their needs, the Mexican heritage of Texas, etc. etc.
The amazing thing is that none of these topics feel forced and detatched
from the story, because the core is still about the characters and how the
past sins of their fathers affect them.  It's about one's past that cannot
be shaken off easily,  which in turn echoes the history and present of
America.  The mirroring of personal lives and the big society is one of
the heavy themes of this picture.  It is also the focus on the characters
that keeps our attention and makes the film successful.  </P>
<P>        With half a dozen major characters and 15-20 minor ones, it's
simply amazing that almost none of them feel unrealistic (almost, with the
exception of Frances MacDormand's character, Sam's divorced wife).  The
emotions are real and believable in a cliched setup.  It proves my
theory that there is more drama in reality if you know how to put them
together.  What's satisfying is that the writer presents the discussion,
but does not cheapen it by trying to find an easy way out like so many
other films tend to do.  So you can't make a disillusioned girl give up
drug and love life with one heart-to-heart talk.  That's life.  It's
amazing to see John Sayles resists an easy solution from big social
problem down to the smallest personal conflict.  </P>
<P>        The actors are a blast too. My favorite performance is Joe
Morton, playing a successful black colonal facing his troubled feeling to
his father again after years of bitterness.  He handles it with such
delicacy and depth that it may well be the best performance from last year
that I have seen.  Everyone else is all the way up there too.  The
romantic element between two tired adults who love each other is natural
and persuasive.  Both Cooper and Pena gave convincing performances.  Plus
most of the supporting cast. </P>
<P>        With so many characters and conflicts, some of them are bound to be
weaker than others, but there are still plenty of pearls in this pile of
treature. The Mexican illegal immigrants issue could be handled better.  
Some dialogues are a little too politically oriented and simplistic, less
subtle than others, but most of the emotions and feelings are genuine and 
heart-felt.  John Sayles is a typical American (but not Hollywood)
filmmaker.  He goes for the big, big issues, big story, big emotional
rides.  It's miracle that the screenplay feels close to real life all the
way through. The style of "Lone Star" is more or less in the root of
traditional story-telling.  The ending, however, is not that satisfying.
I personally had problems with the big secret revealed in the end, which I
thought the film could have done without. (Not that it can't be done.  I
read a Sam Shepherd play years ago with same theme.  It's just a little
too much here for this movie.)  </P>
<P>        I had much expectation for "Lone Star," and it still surprised me.
It's not perfect, but anyone who can take care of so many things at the
same time is more unbelievable than perfection.  It doesn't feel terribly
"personal" to me, but the complexity of the whole production (from the
script to direction to the performances, from the certral characters to
the guy with only one line) surpasses anything I can think of presently.
How did they do that?  Grade: A. </P>
