<PRE>A Question of Ethics
Election</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Here's a movie that raises a question of ethics (or is it morals). Either
way, the film steps all over such ideals, perhaps in hopes of redefining
them. Appropriately, it ended up poking me with an ethical dilemma: a film
with such excellent direction, acting, dialogue and humor, deserves high
marks from a reviewer; but my own sense of morality (regarding it's subject
matter) is holding me back from giving it the grade.</P>
<P>Allow me to clarify. The director of "Election" pays so close attention to
detail that he makes you feel like you're a participant in the film. The
timing of the editing is flawless. The script's dialogue is completely real,
riddled with the knocks and pings of everyday, high school population
stutters and stops. The acting ... appropriately straight on the money. And
it's funny. I was laughing, we were all laughing.</P>
<P>When Miss senior over-achiever discovers that her plans to become class
president are being challenged ... her prissy face loses it's smile and a
primal scream rings out over her closed mouth expression.</P>
<P>But the topic isn't just the election, it's infidelity and statutory rape
for starters -- involving students and/or teachers. Perhaps I'm not alone
when I say that kind of thing makes me feel uncomfortable. Don't get me
wrong -- I'm okay with being uncomfortable during part of a film --
especially if it's an investment toward a larger goal. But, I felt
uncomfortable for nearly the duration of this tremendously well put together
piece. Nor, did I feel resolved about it at the end. So, I think you see the
dilemma.</P>
<P>I'm going to be weak. I'm going to let my intangible, perhaps unjustifiable
feelings regarding specifically the touchy topics, prevent me from giving it
an 'A'. Forgive me.</P>
