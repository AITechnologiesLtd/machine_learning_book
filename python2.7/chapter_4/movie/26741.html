Remember the Titans</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>"I'm not the answer to your prayers. I'm not Martin Luther King ... I'm 
just a football coach." </P>
<P>1971 Virginia is in for a rude awakening, Denzel Washington takes over 
as the nation's first black high school head coach. Can the old coach 
tolerate working under him? With busing protesters tossing stones the 
first day of school, can the white and black players learn to play as a 
team instead of an angry mob? Can the town reconcile the racial 
tensions? </P>
<P>Though all of the dialogue is poignant, some of it is soaked onto the 
film a little thick -- the youngest cast member pushing the oversell 
envelope. But, schmaltz is all the fault I can find with this extremely 
well paced, meaty film. Like "Meet the Parents," these filmmakers had so 
much to put into the film, they cut anything that wasn't immediately 
pertinent. Washington is high powered, as is just about everyone else in 
this film (Harris, Hurst, Patton!). "Titans" is full of people to like 
... and to learn to like. </P>
<P>Denzel plays the hard guy that won't patronize any part of weakness, 
"You fumble the football and I will break my foot off in your John Brown 
hind parts ... and then you'll run a mile!" </P>
<P>The film is a lot about character and a little about football. Not a 
single boring, slow, or unnecessary second. I loved it. </P>
