********************************
Key to rating system:
2.0  stars                 Debatable
2.5 stars                Some people may like it
3.0 stars                I liked it
3.5 stars                I am biased in favor of the movie

<PRE>Directed by:
David Hogan</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Keenen Ivory Wayans</PRE>
<P>Starring: Keenen Ivory Wayans, Jon Voight, Jill Hennessy, Paul Sorvino,
and Robert Culp</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
escaped marine sergeant wrongly accused of murder, female doctor,
corrupt general, CIA</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
Sergeant James Dunn (Keenen Ivory Wayans) has killed an officer in self
defense. On the way to death row, he is rescued by a secret government
assassination team headed by General Woodward (Jon Voight) and invited
to join. But it's all a setup, and when the First Lady is assassinated,
Dunn finds himself holding a gun, and chased by the police, the army,
and the public out for the reward money. Apparently Dunn's being framed
by the corrupt General Woodward, and must find enough evidence to put
Woodward away while evading the forces of law and order. He gets help
from the head of the CIA (Paul Sorvino) as well as from a lady doctor
(Jill Hennessy) who has accidentally videotaped the real killer.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Nothing new or original here. This is a sometimes hammy B grade action
yarn, with some one liners minus the laugh track.  </P>
