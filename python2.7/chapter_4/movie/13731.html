<PRE>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
Rating: **** (out of four)
R, 1998
Director: Steven Spielberg
Screenplay: Robert Rodat
Starring Cast: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Matt
Damon.</PRE>
<P>It has been my impression that most war movies fall into one of two
categories: overtly anti-war pictures, be they the grim seriousness of FULL
METAL JACKET or the pointed satire of GOOD MORNING VIETNAM, or
action/adventure stories with a bit of flag-waving, melodramatic fluff.
Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN wisely positions itself somewhere in
between: it neither protests World War II nor glorifies it. Instead,
Spielberg portrays the war as an ugly necessity, asking the audience to
recognize the tremendous human cost of fighting Nazism, paid both by those
who were killed in battle and by those who survived it.</P>
<P>The opening sequence, which depicts the D-Day invasion at Omaha Beach with
unflinching realism, has been called the best battle scene ever filmed by
some critics. I haven't seen enough war films to make that call, but in any
case this extensive set piece touches upon an important observation: that
survival in war is often more a product of dumb luck than of fighting
skill. Hundreds of Americans pour onto the beach, hundreds of Germans are
there waiting for them, and they shoot at each other until one side comes
out ahead. The death scenes are often gruesome, as well they should be. As
Spielberg has said in interviews, being killed in war is not necessarily
quick and painless, and certainly does not occur in slow-motion with a
swell of strings in the background.</P>
<P>Among the survivors are a company led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks),
whose squadron is then assigned to locate a Private James Ryan (Matt
Damon), who lost two brothers at D-Day and another in Africa, and bring him
back home. Many war films might have played this out as a simple
action/adventure yarn, but SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is smart enough to
acknowledge that this is a questionable undertaking. Is this a public
relations stunt designed to make the military look good, or is it a mission
of compassion to Ryan's family? And even if the commanders' hearts are in
the right place, can they justify asking eight men to risk their lives for
one?</P>
<P>The aspect of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that everyone will remember, I think, is
its disturbing examination of the savage chaos of battle and how supposedly
good people can get caught up in the frenzy of violence and anger at seeing
their friends die. Spielberg does not romanticize the American "freedom
fighters," as several of them shoot German soldiers who have already
surrendered, seemingly for the sake of revenge. The one character who seems
to stay in touch with his conscience all the way through is Miller, who
exudes the air of a tough, no-nonsense commanding officer, not because it's
his nature but because he knows that's what his men need. He even refuses
to discuss his job and family life from back home, then finally reveals
himself at the moment when the rest of the squadron most needs to hear it.</P>
<P>The most accessible window into all of this may be the character of
Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), a young officer who's never been in battle
before and is selected for the mission because he can translate German and
French. He finds himself scared senseless when the rest of the squadron
engages in battle with the Germans, unable to act partly out of fear of his
own death and, it seems, partly because he doesn't want to take a human
life. Spielberg plays his scenes in a way that makes his reaction
understandable, rather than making him into a simple coward and an object
for the audience's scorn, yet by the end even he turns out not to be immune
to the oppressive atmosphere of violence and rage.</P>
<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not at all "entertaining" in the usual sense of the
word: it is difficult to watch and will leave most viewers feeling
exhausted and wrung out when it ends. Which, considering its subject
matter, means that it has done its job very well: as I said, this is not a
film about patriotism or glory but about the ordeal endured by World War II
soldiers. I cannot, however, imagine anyone regretting having seen it: it
is a story that deserved to be told and is sure to be remembered as a
classic piece of filmmaking.</P>
