<P>_That's_the_Way_I_Like_It_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>This '70s-set import from Singapore may be named after the song by K.C.
and the Sunshine Band, but that dominates the film is that of the Bee
Gees--namely, their contributions to the _Saturday_Night_Fever_
soundtrack.  In fact, that emblematic film of the disco era dominates
this film about Hock (Adrian Pang), a young man who ends up stumbling
into a theatre playing _Forever_Fever_ (the film's thinly veiled stand-in
for the real thing) and redirects his adoration for Bruce Lee toward John
Travolta and the disco scene.  As Hock enters a dance contest with his
longtime friend Mei (Pam Oei), every plot development can be seen a mile
away; the contest's outcome is never in doubt.  </P>
<P>But when the execution is as spirited as it is here, it doesn't matter. 
What is especially delightful is how writer-director Glen Goei in paying
tribute to the culture of the glitter ball era, he doesn't downplay the
kitschiness of it all; in fact, Goei embraces it.  The Tony Manero
stand-in (Dominic Pace) that comes off the screen to give Hock advice
neither looks nor sounds anything like Travolta, and a climactic Bruce
Lee-style martial arts sequence is over-the-top ridiculous, but it it all
feels pitch-perfect in this funny and immensely charming trifle.</P>
