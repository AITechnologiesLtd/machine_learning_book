<PRE>It must be her. </PRE>
<P>She sleep walks; unconsciously and subconsciously re-enacting an horrific
event she witnessed as a child. </P>
<P>But no. Think about it. It must be him. He's got the knife. He's got the
short fuse and has blown up a few times already. </P>
<P>These are just some of the virtual deductions that you find yourself
contemplating as you sit there in that darkened picture house, trying to
untangle KISS OR KILL.</P>
<P>She is Nikki (O'Connor). He is Al (Day).  They are lovers on the run in the
outback. It's just the two of them. Yet, people they meet - literally in
the middle of nowhere - have a nasty tendency to be murdered. Is it him or
her doing it? This Nullabor Plain has thousands of miles of nothing ;
except fear, suspicion and radioactive dirt.</P>
<P>KISS OR KILL is a very good piece of filmmaking. The use of jump-cut edits
adds to the sense of things going wrong. Time is compressed. We see the
start (cut) middle (cut) then end of a scene. What would have taken 30
seconds in real-life takes only 10 or 15 on the screen. In this movie this
technique works; it serves to increase the feelings of urgency and tension.</P>
<P>Day and O'Connor are hot property and the click between them is so loud as
to be deafening. Improvisation played a role during the making of the film.
 As Nikki and Al start to suspect each other of doing the killings, this
technique kicks in particularly well; their interactions have a real edge
to them. Uncertainly, shock and confusion rule.</P>
<P>With these two representing the current New Wave of young Australian
cinema, Bill Bennett has assembled a virtual who's who of the previous
'generation' of actors as supports. Chris Haywood, Barry Otto and Max
Cullen mostly hover admirably in the background but add in valuable little
pieces to the puzzle.</P>
<P>If you like modern, well crafted, intelligent, thriller.roadmovie.romance
films, you are in for an exciting drive.</P>
