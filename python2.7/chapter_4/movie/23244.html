<PRE>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Jonathan Lynn
Written by: Mitchell Kapner</PRE>
<P>"It's not important how many people I've killed. What's important is how I
get along with the people that are still alive," Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Bruce Willis) solemnly informs a very nervous Nick "Oz" Oseransky (Matthew
Perry) once Oz discovers Jimmy's profession. This line, and the way in which
it is delivered, are great examples of how funny "The Whole Nine Yards" can
be. The problem is, that while it can be hilarious, the film also has a
tendancy to drag at times. The ending goes on for far too long, and the
humor occasionally falls flat. However, when the film pulls its humor off,
it's hysterical.</P>
<P>Oz is a dentist who is so tired of life with his commanding wife, Sophie
(Rosanna Arquette), that he spends his mornings smashing his head against
his steering wheel while driving to work. His secretary, Jill (A hilarious
Amanda Peet), is constantly trying to convince him to divorce his wife but
Oz knows that Sophie will get everything in the divorce settlement. To add
to his miseries, Oz discovers that his new neighbor is hitman, Jimmy "The
Tulip" Tudeski. It turns out that there is a price on Jimmy's head, courtesy
of his associate back in Chicago, Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak). Sophie
wants Oz to go back to Chicago, deliver the whereabouts of Jimmy, and
collect a finder's fee. Oz is of course averse to doing this, since it will
most likely involve Jimmy's killing Oz upon his return. Once he arrives in
Chicago, Oz meets up with another hitman named Frankie Figgs (Michael Clark
Duncan), who is apparently working for Yanni. The situation grows steadily
worse for poor Oz from there.</P>
<P>"The Whole Nine Yards" is one of those fun movies like "Mars Attacks" and
"Galaxy Quest", where you can tell that the entire cast is having a great
time making the film. When a cast acts in this manner it usually carries
over to the audience, as is the case here. Bruce Willis's comic talents lie
mainly in his deadpan delivery of lines, and he is given ample oppurtunity
to display this talent throughout the film. I believe that Matthew Perry's
primary talent is his wide range of facial expressions, and again, he is
given the chance to utilize this ability throughout the movie. Despite the
considerable comic abilities of both these actors, they are overshadowed by
Amanda Peet's ("Isn't She Great", "Simply Irresistable") hysterical
performance as the secretary who wants desperately to become a contract
killer.</P>
<P>"The Whole Nine Yards" has an amazingly complex plot, considering what a
goofy little movie it appears to be at first glance. The film is filled with
double crosses, backstabbing, and false identities. Every character involved
wants some other character dead, and there are various little subplots
relating to these. Unlike "Gun Shy" from earlier this year, the romantic
elements to "The Whole Nine Yards" don't feel tacked on and useless. Though
difficult to take seriously, they blend with the rest of the film quite
well. The cast members work very well together, particularly Bruce Willis
and Amanda Peet. The two of them have a grand old time playing teacher and
student in a very unlikely profession. Peet is so overcome with hero worship
for the elder hitman, she is willing to do anything (and I mean anything) to
win his approval.</P>
<P>The only cast member I found to be rather out of place here was Rosanna
Arquette as the hideous wife of Oz. The problem is, I can't imagine anyone
playing a grotesque character like this. The other major flaw with the film
is the amount of time spent on the ending. The movie could have ended
fifteen minutes earlier than it does with no problem. One more thing I must
note is that "The Whole Nine Yards" is definitely a guy movie. Nearly every
guy in the theatre I attended was laughing uproariously at the movie, while
most of the women present seemed rather baffled by the humor. "The Whole
Nine Yards" runs a little too long at 100 minutes, but it doesn't start to
drag too badly till the end. I'd recommend it to fans of Matthew Perry and
Bruce Willis. If you dislike these actors, I'd suggest you stay far away
from this one. I give the movie three and a half out of five stars.</P>
