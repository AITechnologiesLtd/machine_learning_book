<PRE>The Endless Summer (1966)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 70</PRE>
<P>Bruce Brown directed, produced, edited and
narrated "The Endless Summer", a pseudo-documentary
that follows two professional surfers around
the world.  It was filmed as a silent, with
witty narration and a surf music score later
added.  You would think that a documentary on
surfing would eventually reach low tide and
become beached, but the expected repetition
and boredom never quite arrives.  This has
much to do with the skill of Brown's editing,
and his knowledge of and enthusiasm for surfing.</P>
<P>Our surfer protagonists are Mike Hynson and
Robert August.  We don't get to know them
beyong surfing (and some clever comic relief
pantomiming) and it fact it is difficult to
tell which one is which.  Perhaps this is
just as well, since that allows the focus
to be on the sport of surfing, and how the
surf varies worldwide from beach to beach.
Brown and the crew stay behind the camera,
creating the illusion that they aren't there,
and that it is just Mike and Robert who are
surfing around the world.</P>
<P>The best part of the film comes early.  Mike
and Robert begin their travels with the northwest
coast of Africa, becoming the first ever to
surf there.  They encounter local villagers,
fishermen and their kids, who had never seen
a white man, much less a surfer, in their lives.
It is entertaining to see our surfing heroes
trying to communicate with the locals, who of
course speak no English, and attempting to teach
them how to surf.</P>
<P>You don't have to be an expert surfer to
appreciate the film.  Surfing techniques are
explained in amusing slang expressions, and the
cinematography, while on the cheap, is
very good.  Sometimes the waves are awesome,
with the surfers risking their lives for
the thrill of the ride.</P>
