<PRE>                              DANTE'S PEAK
                       A film review by Marty Mapes
                        Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>While I was watching it, I loved Dante's Peak. It was a great
action/disaster movie with lots of interesting sequences, riveting
special effects, and likeable characters. Afterwards, the movie left my
mind completely. It didn't resonate with any interesting themes or
ideas; it was just a story, and it was done. But really, what else could
anyone ask from an action movie?  The effects-laden previews made this
movie look like Twister, which I did not like. Many critics have called
the two movies similar. Roger Ebert even outlines the "rules" for such
disaster movies in his review. But I disagree that adherence to the
genre necessarily makes a sub-par movie. Some formula movies work and
others don't. Dante's Peak works.</P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan plays Harry Dalton, a volcanologist from the U.S.
Geological Survey, who is sent to the perky little town of Dante's Peak.
Strange things are happening in Dante's Peak; or maybe they aren't.
That's what Harry has to find out. He arrives and hooks up with mayor
Rachel Wando (played by Linda Hamilton) who shows him around. The movie
spends some time getting to know Rachel, Harry, his colleagues, and the
town. The characters are likeable, largely because Brosnan and Hamilton
are so charismatic. And thankfully, as Andrea says, Rachel's kids aren't
too annoying, (as many movie kids are these days).</P>
<P>The movie really takes off, though, when the mountain blows. At first
there is panic among the townspeople and the panic is well-staged. Quite
often action sequences comprise a bunch of close-ups, cut together.
(That's cheaper, easier, and less interesting than actually spending
time to choreograph the sequence.) The confusion in Dante's Peak is not
entirely created through editing. There are actually carefully staged
wide shots of townspeople running and driving amok. The freeway at the
edge of town collapses and it looks like footage from the San Francisco
earthquake. A flood of water, ash, and logs sweeps down the mountain and
it looks like footage from Mt. St. Helens. Harry Dalton (the character)
is trapped in a cave-in and I fear for Pierce Brosnan's (the actor's)
safety.</P>
<P>After the preliminary eruption, the main characters rush from one
dangerous situation to the next, and each of these sequences is riveting
and frightening. The characters never do anything inhumanly stupid to
bring the danger on themselves (as characters often do in horror
movies), but there's always one more dangerous situation for the
characters to face. Having survived several close geologic encounters,
Harry and Rachel try to drive down off the mountain, only to discover
that the road is blocked by a lava flow. Driving on might get them stuck
in lava, but turning around might trap them on a doomed mountain. Credit
the writing of Leslie Bohem for keeping these situations tense without
feeling contrived, and for including enough of these vignettes to keep
the pace moving.</P>
<P>I assume that most of these situations were computer generated (like the
flood and the freeway collapse), and if it's true, these are the best
computer-generated graphics I have seen. They were crude at the
beginning of Dante's Peak (the peak is clearly inserted into the
backgrounds), interesting in Terminator 2 and passably believable in
Jurassic Park, but the flood scene in Dante's Peak looked frighteningly
real and the freeway collapse had me riveted. They didn't work
everywhere, like when the lava burst though the back wall of the cabin,
but perhaps for the first time, some of the computer graphics are
seamless.</P>
<P>This movie was crafted and not slapped together. There is some
interesting camera work during the setup of the movie. The camera, in
two parallel shots started on the face of a character, then pulled back
and swung around to reveal the whole scene. It's not much, but it showed
me that some care and thought were put into the movie. There was no
superheroism, no dumb luck, no coincidences, no token sex scenes, and no
irrelevant pop music sprinkled in as an excuse for a soundtrack. Also,
three PhDs were credited as advisors. I am not qualified to say if the
science was true to life, but it felt about right and it wasn't
condescending.</P>
<P>Although this movie may be totally forgotten in five years, it is great
entertainment.</P>
