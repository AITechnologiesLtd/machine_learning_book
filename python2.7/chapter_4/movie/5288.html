<PRE>                                TWISTER
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>Stars: Bill Paxton, Hellen Hunt, Cary Elwes, flying cow</P>
<P>Summary: Popcorn movie.  Grade B plot with grade A effects. </P>
<P>I am always happy when a movie like TWISTER comes out because it serves to
illustrate just how good movies like TERMINATOR and APOLLO XII (usually
dismissed as "just" action movies) really are.  TWISTER is just an action
film.  Oh yes, there is a plot, of sorts.  It is flimsy and instantly
forgettable.  In short, there is nothing in this movie besides the special
effects to make the movie interesting.</P>
<P>The characters are likeable enough, if superficial and empty.  I can't
fault the performances of any of the actors, they just aren't given
anything to work with. One gets the feeling that Michael Chriton scripted
this one the night before shooting was to commence.</P>
<P>That said, the effects are marvelously done, and there's nothing exactly
BAD about the film, just nothing good beyond the work of Industrial Light
and Magic.</P>
<P>Grade: -1.5 on the old -4 to +4 scale (0 being average) overall, with a +2
on the effects work.</P>
