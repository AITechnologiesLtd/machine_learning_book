<P>Synopsis: In 1899, young playwright Christian (McGregor) travels to Paris 
where he befriends Toulouse Lautrec (John Leguizamo) and visits the Moulin 
Rouge, the infamous nightclub-turned-theatre run by Harold Zidler (Jim 
Broadbent). There, Christian falls in love with dancer and would-be 
actress Satine (Kidman), and must compete for her affections with the 
Moulin Rouge's odious benefactor, the Duke of Monroth (Roxburgh). It soon 
becomes evident that Christian's masterpiece will determine not only his 
future with Satine, but also the fate of the Moulin Rouge itself.</P>
<P>Review: Amazing! Astounding! A breath of fresh air! "Moulin Rouge!" is all 
this and more. Audiences may find its opening moments hard to process; its 
hyperkinetic pacing and raucous visual style is a vast departure from the 
mainstream. But most viewers should be able to attune themselves to 
Luhrmann's offbeat filmmaking before too long; those who expend the effort 
will find themselves plunged into a superior cinematic experience that 
makes it all worthwhile. Combining visual effects, model work, live action 
and any number of inventive camera angles and motions, Luhrmann gives 
"Moulin Rouge!" a distinctive appearance which nicely evokes the movie's 
setting of 1899 Paris and the "Bohemian Revolution". And though it may 
seem almost contradictory, Luhrmann's use of modern music -- everything 
from "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" to "My Song" -- merely enhances 
the atmosphere (Broadbent's uproarious rendition of "Like A Virgin" is 
especially noteworthy). The performers hit all the right notes, especially 
McGregor, who achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation. But 
ironically, so spoiled are we by the first half of "Moulin Rouge!" that 
when things calm down a bit and drift into more traditional melodrama 
thereafter, it comes as a disappointment. Still, "Moulin Rouge!" is an 
assault on the eyes and ears of rare truculence, and rarer pleasure.</P>
