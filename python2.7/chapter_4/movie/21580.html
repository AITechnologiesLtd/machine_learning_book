<P>This Halloween, you have the choice of two vastly different horror
movies. One is `Bats', a blatantly incompetent creature feature about
flying mammals that eat everyone in Texas. The second is `House on
Haunted Hill', a spooky haunted house movie about party guests trapped
inside a former medical institution. For intensive purposes, go with
`House on Haunted Hill'.</P>
<P>Neither film has exactly the right mixture of feverishly creepy
elements, but at least `Hill' succeeds on certain levels. After the
disappointment of the offbeat summer offering `The Haunting', audiences
may be pining for a decent haunted house movie. Despite the similar
premise shared between the two, they are relatively incompatible. `The
Haunting' carried a PG-13 rating and relied heavily on spooky production
design and expensive special effects. `House on Haunted Hill' is rated
R, putting the emphasis on elaborate gore and disturbing atmosphere and
plot devices. It too eventually evolves into an all-out special effects
barrage during the closing minutes, but everything seems more
appropriate, and not all logic is abandoned as it was in `The Haunting'.</P>
<P>Both films are also remakes, this of the 1958 William Castle camp
classic of the same name. That version has gone unseen by me, so
venturing into the theater for the restructured 90's rendition, I didn't
know exactly what to expect. There were some intentionally cheesy
elements, but mainly, the film is a creepy exercise in eerie atmosphere
and frightening images. With it's agreeable pace and potent shock
formula, `House on Haunted Hill' is surprisingly decent for a movie not
originally screened for critics. There is the matter of underdeveloped
characters, botched direction and missed opportunities. But whoever digs
this sort of thing will have some fun, and the film is almost perfectly
suited to the demands of the season.</P>
<P>Geoffrey Rush plays Steven Price, an eccentric theme park tycoon who
constructs new-age rides for the public. His wife Evelyn (Famke Janssen)
wants her upcoming birthday party set a unique environment. So, why not
have it at (say in low, rumbling voice) .... The House on Haunted Hill!!
This towering structure was once a medical institution where a psychotic
doctor (Jeffrey Combs) conducted torturous experiments. Five guests have
been invited to spend the night, with an interesting catch: whoever
survives until sunrise will receive a payment of  one million dollars
each. Of course, Steven has wired the place with elaborate booby traps
intended to scare everyone away.</P>
<P>The guests who show up are, strangely enough, not the original invitees.
A former pro baseball player (Taye Diggs of `Go' and `The Best Man'), a
secretive doctor (Peter Gallagher), a business executive (Ali Larter)
and a former game show host (Bridgette Wilson) are all anxious to get
their paws on the proposed money. Steven and Evelyn, who despise each
other religiously, believe that the other is playing a dirty trick. When
the locking mechanism comes down abruptly, the group is trapped inside.
Perhaps they should heed the words of the jittery Prichitt (Chris
Kattan), who rambles on amusingly about how the house is alive and
aware.</P>
<P>This is not a character driven film. The only actors who register are
Rush (enjoyable and over-the-top) and Kattan - although Peter Gallagher
delivers an adequate performance with his one-note caricature. The
entire cast does little but wander around aimlessly, waiting to be
served up for a slaughter. But there is the slight presence of style
over substance, and a few twists in the plot, although not especially
mind-blowing, provide enough juice to keep things pumping.</P>
<P>`House on Haunted Hill' has the potency to be something truly
nerve-wracking, but it settles comfortably on disturbing atmosphere.
There is a really chilling scene in which Wilson captures images of
patient dismemberment on her camera, only to notice nothing is actually
there. The graphic and unsettling prologue sets the mood nicely in the
opening sequence. It doesn't quite function altogether, but `House on
Haunted Hill' is fun. And it also gives you the major creeps.</P>
<P>But what about this curious ending? It's initially dumb, but is there
more to it? It may have you absorbed in conversation afterward, although
the rest of the film is quite clear: it's a campy little fright film
brimming with special effects and gooey gore.</P>
