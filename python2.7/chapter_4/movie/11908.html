<PRE>Up Close And Personal
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (our of ****) </PRE>
<P>Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer in a romantic drama about television
news. Wow, two personal faves in a favorite genre and setting. How could it
miss? Read on and find out.</P>
<P>Pfeiffer is a neophyte television reporter hired by Redford, seasoned veteran
who's had his time in the sun and settled into a comfortable production
position. Their mentor/student relationship quickly develops into a romantic
one with all of the difficulties associated with ex-partners and the
instability of the profession.</P>
<P>On her way to the top, the beautiful reporter moves from situation to
situation with the help of her coach until she reaches a position where she
must move from Miami. Redford follows and she arranges a job for him with her
new station. This doesn't set well with his ego. Somewhat of yet another
remake of "A Star Is Born", at least the milieu is different from the previous films.</P>
<P>Although each star has an impressive track record and powerful screen
presence, the chemistry between them is slight. Redford plays the stable older
man but shows virtually no emotion throughout the movie. Until the second
half, Pfeiffer's emotional range runs the range of A through B.</P>
<P>There are two different films here. The first follows the development of
their relationship and her career and is filled with longing gazes, a
VH1-inspired beach scene and unimportant scenes. The other begins when she is
behind the scenes during a prison riot and is much more dynamic. The earlier
portion is an important set-up to the second, but could have done with severe editing.</P>
<P>Not a bad film, just another one where the execution doesn't live up to the promise.</P>
<P>[This appeared in the 3/7/96 "Bloomington Voice", Bloomington, Indiana.
