                       A film review by Malcolm Austin
                        Copyright 1990 Malcolm Austin</PRE>
<PRE>     This article is spoiler-free.</PRE>
<P>     I saw CYRANO DE BERGERAC yesterday.  It is by Jean-Paul Rappeneau,
and stars Gerard Depardieu in the title role.  It is, of course, based
on the play by Edmund Rostand.</P>
<P>     I am a long-time Cyrano fan.  I have seen the Jose Ferrer version
several times, and seen it performed as a play twice.  I have also read
two translations.  And I'm not even counting Steve Martin's ROXANNE!</P>
<P>     I went to this film expecting it to be great, and I have to admit I
was disappointed.  I think this was partially my own nearly jaded
familiarity with the story, and partially a result of the film.  In
particular, the sub-titles are the bane of this movie.</P>
<P>     The film tries much harder than the Ferrer version to avoid seeming
like a play.  The locations are detailed and look authentic.  In many
ways the translation reminds me of Zefferelli's ROMEO AND JULIET.  It is
beautifully shot, and the camera-work is top-notch.  Depardieu gives
another wonderful performance, and the rest of the cast is up to his
level.</P>
<P>     Despite being filmed as a movie, no liberties were taken with the
dialogue from the play, as far as I could tell, although at least a few
scenes were trimmed.</P>
<P>     The film is in French, and, frankly, I think that this is why the
film kind of fell flat for me.  The subtitles were excellent (written by
Anthony Burgess), but they were very distruptive, particularly when they
became idiomatic.  Burgess went to great trouble, I think, to construct
rhyming subtitles when appropriate, but at times this causes a gap
between the sub-titles and the actual dialogue.  There is also a lot of
dialogue, spoken very rapidly, and I found myself often straining to
keep up with the lines, and still look at the film itself.</P>
<P>     Subtitles are a blunt instrument designed to allow a foreigner to
enjoy a film, and follow the plot.  This film foils them.  I am not
suggesting that the film such have been dubbed.  That would have been
far worse.  But this film depends heavily on language, and subtitling
is just not adequate.</P>
<P>     There were several French speakers in the audience, and they were
rapt.  During the final scene, many (all men!) were crying.  This is how
I recall reacting when I saw the play, and read the book.  This time,
though, I felt more emotion seeing the reactions of those around me,
than in seeing the film.</P>
<P>     To sum up, this film is breath-taking and wonderful--if you speak
French.  If not, you might actually prefer the English (Ferrer) version,
even though it is really a far inferior film.  Better yet, see it as a
play.</P>
