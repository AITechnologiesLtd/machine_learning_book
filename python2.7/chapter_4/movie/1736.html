<PRE>                CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2: THE FINAL SACRIFICE
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>98 min., R, Horror, 1993
Director: David F. Price
Cast: Terence Knox, Paul Scherrer, Ryan Bollman, Christie Clark,
      Rosalind Allen, Ned Romero</P>
<P>     The police find out what happened to all the adults in the town of
Gatlin.  The police move all the children to a neighboring town.  A
reporter, Terence Knox, and his son, Paul Scherrer, go to the Gatlin
area so that Knox can do a story on what happened in Gatlin.  Knox and
Scherrer stay at a Bed and Breakfast run by Rosalind Allen, who has
brought in Ryan Bollman (one of the children from Gatlin).  Bollman gets
possessed by "He who walks behind the rows" and tries to get the
children in the town to kill all the adults.  Knox begins investigating
what happened and starts coming up with some mysterious information,
while Scherrer is falling in love with Christie Clark.</P>
<P>     The film says that CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2: THE FINAL SACRIFICE is
"based" on the short story "Children of the Corn" by Stephen King.
Actually the film has nothing to do with the story except for the fact
that it tells the furthering story.  However this is an entertaining
film.  I can recommend this film to fans of horror films.  I don't think
that this film will be in the theaters for long.  In my area, on opening
weekend, it had just a 9:30 PM showing, so if you plan on seeing this
film you should do so soon.  On a scale of zero to five, I give CHILDREN
OF THE CORN 2 a four.  CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2 is rated R for explicit
language, adult situations, and graphic violence.</P>
<P>     CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2 is well done and suspenseful at times.  The
special effects for this film are excellent.  CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2 is
very well written, and the actors don't end up with too many moronic
lines, a fatal flaw that hits many horror films.  This film is not
exceptionally gory, however, those with weak stomachs will dislike some
scenes.  I also liked how the opening credits looked.  I thought they
were done excellently and improved the film.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film is excellent and, unlike many low budget
horror films, can actually act.  My two favorites out of the cast are
Ryan Bollman and Christie Clark.  Both give the best performances in the
film.  Paul Scherrer, also, does a good job.  Terence Knox is good and
Rosalind Allen is not on the screen very much.</P>
<P>     CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2: THE FINAL SACRIFICE is worth full admission
price and is definitely worth going to see (plus it is the only horror
film playing currently in many areas unless you count KNIGHT MOVES as a
horror film).  You may want to leave the children at home though (you
don't want to give them any bad ideas, do you?).</P>
