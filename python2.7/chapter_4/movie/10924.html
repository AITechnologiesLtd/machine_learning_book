<P>    Martin Scorsese's Kundun is a visual wonder, striking in every
detail and accentuated by Philip Glass' masterful score. Scorsese tells
the story of the 14th Dalai Lama, beginning in 1939 when the young child
is just two years old. As the film progresses, we see him at ages 5, 10,
and then 16 and beyond; through most of the film, he is portrayed by
Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong. The conflicts later in the film involve the
Chinese government's attempts to get Tibet to be part of China, and the
Dalai Lama is finally forced to leave his people for India.</P>
<P>    A few months ago I was subjected to a film of almost the exact same
subject matter, Seven Years in Tibet. While that film was entertaining
but not very insightful, Kundun lacks substantial entertainment value,
and is only marginally more interesting as a biography of the Dalai
Lama. Entertainment value might seem like a trivial complaint in this
case, but regardless of content, a filmmaker's first goal should be to
capture its audience, and Scorsese has a hard time doing that for me in
Kundun.</P>
<P>    It's not that he flat-out failed, it's just that this subject does
not lend itself to easy audience involvement. The whole time I watched
Kundun, I felt utterly separated from what was happening on screen. The
Tibetans, as portrayed in this film, seem like docile, peace-oriented
separatists. I feel like the real Tibetans wouldn't want me watching
them. They are so set in their ways, so unwilling of change, that the
thought of an audience watching them to interpret their actions seems
ludicrous to me. I felt like they needed no vindication, no audience, no
telling of their story. So, I viewed Kundun almost entirely as a story
that is out of its league as a large-scale American film. Textbooks,
even novels, are more appropriate for this subject.</P>
<P>    I was, however, at least moderately concerned for the Dalai Lama.
Tsarong (with whom I am not familiar) does a pretty good job in the
role, though he lacks conviction and doesn't always seem natural. It
doesn't help that all the characters speak English. Just for realism's
sake, I would have preferred subtitles throughout the film--this might
have proved to distance the audience even further, but in this case I
would have gladly substituted authenticity for personalism.</P>
<P>    I wouldn't say Kundun is boring; in its best moments, it is truly
astonishing in visual power. The landscapes are all filmed in such a way
that orange and brown dirt looks colorful and enticing; there are some
unusual-yet-mesmerizing scenes later in the film that show close-ups of
sand paintings going through creation and destruction. As stated
earlier, Philip Glass' musical score is one of the better scores of
1997, mixing pleasant melodies with sharp, deep tonal shifts.
Atmosphere-wise, the film is virtually flawless.</P>
<P>    But this can't make up for the emotional limbo that Kundun provides
for its audience. I'm not exactly sure what could have cured this--more
insight into the Dalai Lama himself, possibly letting us into his head a
bit more rather than just showing us long shots of his unemotional face.
This being the second film in such a short period of time that has
failed to truly interest me in the Dalai Lama and the Tibetans, it makes
me wonder if we're really supposed to fully understand them. Their
religion and way of life seems off-limits to me, to such an extent that
I almost feel it's inappropriate to watch this film and develop and
opinion about them. But if that's not what I'm supposed to do, then what
is the point?</P>
