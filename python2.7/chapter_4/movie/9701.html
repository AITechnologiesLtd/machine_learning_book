<PRE>BEAN
(PG-13)</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by E. Benjamin Kelsey</PRE>
<PRE>* * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>British Comedy has somewhat of a cult following in America. Like Trekkies
(and I hope that I don't have to explain what those are), extreme fans of
British Comedy are very devote enthusiasts when it comes to their choice of
"quality television". But whether you're more likely to recognize names such
as John Cleese and Rowan Atkinson (who plays Mr. Bean) or Jean-Claude Van
Damme and Chuck Norris, BEAN the movie is sure to disappoint.</P>
<P>The problem is that BEAN is likely to attract, at least for the most part,
only die hard fans of the brainless British buffoon. Yet it is this same
group who will likely find the movie so sadly disappointing. For one, some of
the gags in the film are taken directly from the TV show! But is seeing Mr.
Bean with a turkey stuck on his head any funnier when it takes place in L.A.
as opposed to the United Kingdom? Not really. For another, even the "fresh"
material falls so far short of the Mr. Bean that people have come to know and
love, that it won't really matter.</P>
<P>Those who are unfamiliar with Mr. Bean may enjoy the film more than those
expecting a 90-minute interpretation, but BEAN doesn't ignite any of the
charm that the television series has. The wonderful doofiness that this
character possesses is nearly lost in a big screen adaption.</P>
<P>BEAN does have a fairly short running time, even for a comedy. But this fact
does not prevent the movie from seeming to drag a tad too long. And when they
try to cram a serious plot twist in near the end, the tone of the movie
prevents the audience from really caring. In fact, it's merely a distracting
obstacle in the plot that serves the story nil. But then again, how else are
you going to fit in those "oh-so-funny" hospital bits?</P>
<P>Ok, so I laughed a few times. And like so many other movies, there were some
funny scenes that made me wish I could recommend this film. But there just
isn't enough here to get a recommendation out of me. If you really want to
savor Mr. Bean, you'd be much better off buying the available videos that
contain episodes from the TV series. And with the price of movie admissions
going up more and more, even your wallet might be grateful!</P>
