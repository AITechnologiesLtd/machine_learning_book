<PRE>Chocolat
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Take Footloose and Like Water for Chocolate, steep the combo in a
heaping helping of corn syrup, and you'll come out with the sticky,
sickly-sweet romantic cautionary tale Chocolat.  The Cider House Rules
director Lasse Hallström helms this adaptation of the best-selling novel
by Joanne Harris, and delivers yet another pretty package of tempered
social messages -- this time preaching about social tolerance instead of
abortion.</P>
<P>Set against the idyllic backdrop of a quaint puritanical village in the
French countryside, mysterious Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her
daughter, dressed in identical Red Riding Hood outfits, literally blow
into town "on the North Wind."  Within days, the duo brazenly opens a
magical chocolaterie across the street -- gasp -- from the church, and
on the first week of Lent, no less.  Vianne -- who comes off as a
50's-era Erin Brockovich sporting low-cut tops and bright red stilettos
-- is turning the townsfolk on to her sweets, which a la Pleasantville
miraculously inspire increased sex drives, feminist awakenings, familial
reconciliation and even criminal rehabilitation.  Soon, the town's
prudish mayor launches a campaign to drive the sin-inducing shop out of
business.</P>
<P>As if the girl-against-God story doesn't hit you over the head with
enough meaning, along comes a swarthy band of Irish "river rats," headed
up by the Blues guitar-playing, ponytailed Roux (Johnny Depp), to stir
the xenophobic waters even further in the tiny hamlet.  This Erin gypsy
bad boy with a heart of gold finds an ally in fellow ne'er-do-well
Vianne.  She's a little bit country, he's a little bit rock and roll,
and romance ensues.</P>
<P>But regardless of its good intentions, Chocolat wastes the talents of a
great cast.  Juliette Binoche manages to eke out a little dignity among
Vianne's folklorish jibberish, and Judi Dench lends weight to her role
as a local diabetic curmudgeon.  However, all of these otherwise adept
actors must deliver their lines in French-accented English, which comes
off as a chintzy device to remind the audience that, hey, the movie's
set in France -- and perhaps also to explain the lack of an "e" at the
end of the title.</P>
<P>Plus, the story has some serious problems of its own.  The only reason
given for Vianne's obsessive nomadic tendencies is that her foolish
French dad married a wild-eyed Mayan woman who instilled the need to
blaze a trail across Europe, leaving cavities and heightened libidos in
her wake.  Of course, things all wrap up rather neatly in the end,
something that becomes very apparent less than halfway into the film,
and there's even a Disney-esque treat to close the picture that's sure
to incite a few groans.</P>
<P>Of course, Chocolat will be ideal fare for the Oprah's Book Club crowd,
and will surely be a great pick for seeing with mom over the holidays or
maybe a cute first date.  Just be warned; Chocolat is more
Russel-Stover's than Godiva.</P>
