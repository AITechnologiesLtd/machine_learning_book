Susan Granger's review of "WHAT PLANET ARE YOU FROM?" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P> After The Graduate, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Carnal
Knowledge, Heartburn, even Primary Colors, there's no question that
director Mike Nichols relishes exploring the relationship between the
sexes. Which explains why he was drawn to comedian Garry Shandling's
concept of an extraterrestrial who was sent to Earth to impregnate a
woman as a part of some sort of universal domination plan. Having this
alien come from an advanced civilization of neutered, cloned males
with little knowledge of the behavior of the female of the species is
a clever concept, ripe for scathing social satire, but its execution
misses the mark. In addition to his writing and producing efforts,
Shandling stars, utilizing his wry, dead-pan understatement to be an
awkward, almost totally passive hero. The primary gimmick revolves
around his surgically implanted penis which emits a motorized humming
sound when he becomes aroused. The gag is amusing the first time, the
second, even the third. After that, it loses its vibe. Posing as a
banker in Phoenix, his copulating mission is simple. "I have to have
sex right away," he gasps. "I'm really very horny!"  A sleazy
co-worker, played by Greg Kinnear, takes him to troll at an Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting where he meets Annette Bening, a neurotic, lovable
Earth-chick who is, indeed, easy.  "Don't laugh," she says, "but I'm
working as a real-estate agent" - a line that immediately elicits
chuckles as a reminder of her role in American Beauty.  Bening's
terrific, while John Goodman, Linda Fiorentino, Camryn Manheim,
Janeane Garofalo and Ben Kingsley add to the mix. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, What Planet Are You From? is a droll but silly,
superficial 6. I suspect Garry Shandling will have a limited
big-screen career as a leading man.</P>
