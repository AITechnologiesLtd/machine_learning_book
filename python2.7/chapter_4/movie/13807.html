<PRE>EVER AFTER
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The fairy tale of Cinderella has been retold many times over the years.
However, it isn't often that such a retelling results in a film as
revisionist in Ever After.  Eliminating the fantastical elements
(pumpkins and fairy godmothers), while enhancing the romantic angle,
Ever After strives to recast the fairy tale as a misunderstood episode
in history. The result works surprisingly well.</P>
<P>According to this version, "Cinderella" was just a demeaning nickname
applied to the young Danielle (Drew Barrymore) by her cruel stepsisters.
Danielle's father died shortly after marrying the evil Baronness
Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston).  Rodmilla takes pity on Danielle and raises
her as a pathetic servant girl.</P>
<P>Danielle's stepsisters, Marguerite (Megan Dodds) and Jacqueline (Melanie
Lynsky), are, of course, pampered little snobs.  Rodmilla is grooming
them for a potential match with the eligible Prince Henry (Dougray
Scott).  However, after a chance encounter with Danielle, Henry is
smitten.</P>
<P>Danielle finds herself in the awkward position of playing a charade.
She pretends to be of noble birth and worthy of a prince's affections.
All the while, she struggles to conceal her blossoming relationship from
Rodmilla.</P>
<P>This updated telling of the Cinderella tale actually works much better
than it seems.  Despite its anachronistic class attitudes, Ever After
manages to create a lushly realistic backdrop for its timeless tale.</P>
<P>There is, however, one critical flaw in the story which Ever After never
addresses.  Why does the social climbing Baroness Rodmilla deign to
marry Danielle's low-born father.  It's a crucial question which
underlies the film's themes of class inequality.  However, the film
shies away from ever providing a substantive answer.</P>
<P>Drew Barrymore delivers a fair performance as the lead.  She's
definitely more headstrong than most previous Cinderellas.  But she's
also unconvincing at times, particularly during weepy scenes.</P>
<P>At least, she has a reliable supporting cast to lean on.  Dougray Scott
provides an admirable romantic interest, and Anjelica Huston is
perfectly cast as the wicked stepmother.</P>
<P>Romantics will no doubt enjoy Ever After, easily overlooking its flaws.
Others who attend will find, while not a perfect film, one which is
better than they hoped.</P>
