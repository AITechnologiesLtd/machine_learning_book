<PRE>                              LOST HIGHWAY
                       A film review by Dave Cowen
                        Copyright 1997 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>This review contains what might be considered spoilers, but I honestly don't 
think that it would spoil the film for anyone.  There's two sides to every 
story.</P>
<P>Like a jazz artist, Lynch takes his head and adds new riffs, playing his pet 
themes with a different tone, or improvising with new ideas.  While with 
certain filmmakers this would indicate a lack of inspiration, with Lynch it 
indicates a desire to explore deeper with certain themes which resonate 
throughout his work.  In order to understand those themes, and the resonance 
that they provide in the context of these films, it's necessary to look back 
at his prior works to shape the meaning of the seemingly inexplicable plots 
Lynch weaves together.  Unfortunately, this hardly means that LOST HIGHWAY is 
Lynch's best or more successful film.  While there are distinct moments of 
brilliance in LOST HIGHWAY, and the very structure of the film allows Lynch 
to explore his primary themes in new ways, there are flaws which make LOST 
HIGHWAY seem mediocre when compared with other films in Lynch's stable.</P>
<P>In TWIN PEAKS, the Little Man From Another Place (Michael Anderson) shouts 
out the word "Doppelganger!" played forward on tape after it had been 
recorded from the actor reciting the word backwards.  The idea of a 
doppelganger, a ghostly double of a living person, is a theme explored in the
prematurely aborted TWIN PEAKS that has carried over into LOST HIGHWAY's 
universe -- and is an idea essential to the understanding of the film.  Lynch 
himself, it would appear, would seem to have a doppelganger: the genuinely 
nightmarish imagery of his films don't seem to have any link with Lynch's own
innocent, genial Eagle-scout republican image.  This separation of the 
nightmarish and the innocent in Lynch's films have led critics to berate 
these films for having a poor sense of morality, or portraying good and evil 
in a literal and simplistic sense.  But that doesn't seem to be the case: most 
of Lynch's characters seem to exhibit both sides of this moral structure, 
having both innocent ideals yet being intimately familiar (or curious) about 
the darker sides of human life -- something that one rarely sees in the 
standard good guy / bad guy structure of the average Hollywood film.  It is 
natural, not just natural but common, in life for a person to be at once 
repulsed by and drawn in by something, or for a person to have a side that 
they consider light, or moral and right, and dark, a more primal, amoral side. 
 Lynch takes this element of human life, often hidden or simplified in both 
life and in art, and makes them accessible through his surreal visions.  On 
the most simple level the doppelganger, in a Lynch film, is a literal 
separation of a character's "light" and "dark" sides.</P>
<P>Nearly everyone in LOST HIGHWAY has a doppelganger.   Fred Madison, played by
a brooding Bill Pullman, is a tenor, a saxophonist who plays free jazz at 
local nightclubs and on the local radio.  His doppelganger is Pete Dayton 
(Balthazar Getty, doing his best Luke Perry), a talented young mechanic who 
seems to spend more time having sex than fixing cars.  Fred lives with Renee 
(Patricia Arquette), a brunette who seems to be straight out of THE BETTY 
PAGES.  Pete meets who appears to be Renee's doppelganger Alice (also 
Arquette), who is a blond sexpot in the same vein.  Both Renee and Alice 
know Andy (Michael Massee) and Mr. Eddy, who is also known as Dick Laurent 
(Robert Loggia), all of whom are involved in the pornography industry.</P>
<P>"Her name is Renee!  If she told you her name was Alice, she's lying," says 
the Mystery Man, played by Robert Blake.  With white facepaint and no 
eyebrows, the Mystery Man appears to be no less than Mephistopheles himself 
(or Bono's Macphisto, perhaps?).  Fred dreams of the Mystery Man's face on 
Renee's body one night... and Renee/Alice and the Mystery Man are often seen 
at the same place, but never in the same shot.  It would seem that Renee's 
doppelganger isn't her blond self, Alice -- when Pete sees a picture of 
Laurent, Renee, Alice and Andy, he asks her which one she is.  "I'm this one," 
she says, scratching her finger over Alice's blond body.  When the police come
 to the scene of a crime later, they look at the picture.  Alice's image isn't 
part of it.  </P>
<P>A true dread creeps through the opening scenes.  Dialogue that is alternately 
cliched and filled with meaning between the lines flows when Fred and Renee 
speak with each other, always in a slow, stunted manner throughout the first 
30 minutes of the film.  Renee says that she's not going to watch Fred at the 
club tonight because she's "going to read".  "Read?" Fred says incredulously.  
He continues until she smirks and lets out an uncomfortable laugh.  "I'm glad 
to see I can still make you laugh," says Bill in a deadpan tone, "that's why 
I married you."  Bill's face seems to appear and disappear into darkness of 
his apartment through this portion of the film, offering some of the most 
impressive visual compositions seen in film for a very long time.  These 
shots are as low-contrast as one could possibly push the film stock, making 
images sink in and out of darkness, forcing the viewer to search the film's 
widescreen image in fear that there's something lurking just out of sight.  
These are by far the best scenes of the movie, ones that hearken back to 
Lynch's ERASERHEAD in style, and ones that truly unnerve.  It seems incredible
that Peter Deming, cinematographer of such straightforward, undemanding work 
as SON IN LAW or COSMIC SLOP, would be able to create such outstanding images, 
and leaves the filmgoer to wonder if Lynch didn't do most of the work on this 
portion of the film on his own.</P>
<P>One of the quintessential Lynch images is that of an electric light which, 
when it finds itself suddenly glowing too bright, burns out with a violent 
crack.  Similarly, Lynch will occasionally bathe his human or supernatural 
characters in a bright, almost blue light, to underline moments of the feeling 
of love, or warmth, or the desire thereof.  Henry Spencer, the main character 
of ERASERHEAD, finds himself fascinated by a "lady in the radiator", who seems 
to irradiate warmth and promise him that, in heaven, everything is fine -- 
and when at the end of the ERASERHEAD, he chastely embraces her, the screen 
is filled in that similarly white light.  However, when earlier in the film 
Henry makes love to a woman, he draws her into a pool illuminated similarly 
in white -- the glow disappears soon after which she realizes and is horrified 
with the situation Henry is in.  In LOST HIGHWAY's pivotal scene, Fred's 
doppelganger Pete is making love with Alice, bathed in the white light of the
headlights of their car.  "I want you," says Pete.  "You'll never have me," 
says Alice, and walks off, nude, into a shack.  The light from the headlights
fade, and we see Fred get up, walk into the shack, only to find the Mystery 
Man.  </P>
<P>Many have accused Lynch's view of sex as being adolescent.  In Lynch's films, 
however, when the characters crave love they turn to sex believing it to 
provide one in the same, and are disappointed and embittered when that is not 
the case.  In the story of LOST HIGHWAY, we see the young and virile Pete 
transform into Fred, the bitter and haunted artist, after having failed to 
find true love.  Is it too much to have Renee, a woman who draws them in with 
promises of what they desire and then leaves them empty and cold, to seem to 
have the devil as her doppelganger?  Maybe.  Maybe not.</P>
<P>What Lynch is doing, and what he has done in all of his best works, is to 
take a look at the dark side of life.  ERASERHEAD, exploring childbirth as a 
biological nightmare, took the most familiar event known to man and showed the 
dark side of it so completely and surrealistically, that most viewers were 
either confused or repulsed (or both) by a relatively simple and universal 
story of a young father.  In BLUE VELVET, Lynch examined the dark side that 
could exist in any community.  TWIN PEAKS literalized the concept of the 
doppelganger, as in the last episode, when the main character's soul is taken, 
literally splitting the character into good and evil apparitions.  Does this 
draw an easy line between good and evil?  Not so -- characters  who appear 
evil, such as TWIN PEAK's Windom Earle or LOST HIGHWAY's Dick Laurent are 
destroyed by Lynch's apparitions of the real forces of darkness ("Bob" in 
TWIN PEAKS, or LOST HIGHWAY's Mystery Man) as if to show that individuals who
try to emulate evil in the real world are nothing more than dangerous poseurs. 
In Lynch's films, the real evil stems from natural emotional and biological 
processes, so separated from the happy-faced whitewash that we as a society
tend to put on these events or feelings, that they are exaggerated to a 
surreal degree when discovered -- and that is precisely what makes Lynch's 
best moments genuinely frightening.  </P>
<P>In fashioning a story that relies on showing two sides of every character, 
Lynch and Gifford have plotted the film so that no character appears on 
screen with their doppelganger counterpart.  The story instead takes place as 
a cycle, where every action has a reaction in the film, but not necessarily 
after the event occurs in a linear fashion: an action can take place in the 
latter half of the film whose reaction appears in the first half.  Things that
seem needlessly surreal may in fact be a harbinger of developments to come -- 
in a movie like LOST HIGHWAY, where literal events go hand in hand with 
surrealistic representations, it's easy to confuse the two.  When the Mystery 
Man appears at the party and plays a trick with Fred's cell phone, is it 
really that the Mystery Man is both at the party and at Fred's house at the 
same time, or is the Mystery Man revealing that he is the doppelganger of 
Renee, who has been invited both to the party (by Andy, or Dick Laurent) but 
also to Fred's house?  When Fred goes back to his house, after the party, he 
leaves Renee outside, checking to see if there's a Mystery Man inside... "Of 
course there isn't," he ends up muttering.  He's right. </P>
<P>The acting in Lost Highway is what ultimately spoils the fun.  None of the 
actors show much range, with Loggia's half-baked Frank Booth impression to 
Getty's and Pullman's brooding -- and all of the minor players give 
ridiculously artificial and deadpan performances.  Only Robert Blake as the 
Mystery Man strikes the perfect tone, and one wonders what this film would 
have been like had Lynch used actors of the caliber of his other work.  </P>
<P>Also problematic is the soundtrack.  Fluctuating between Lynch's grand 'sound 
design', where background noises add depth to the film along with overtones 
from the talented Angelo Badalamenti and the appropriate and energetic work of
Barry Adamson (whose faux-soundtrack albums have in the past shown his ability 
to create filmic moods through music alone) are mixed in with inappropriate 
songs from NIN and a ridiculously distracting cover of "This Magic Moment" by 
Lou Reed.  </P>
<P>LOST HIGHWAY is worth seeing for any of Lynch's fans, but will seem obtuse 
and overwrought to anyone not familiar with Lynch's work.  The film lags in 
its second half, and has its share of flaws from the standpoint of editing, 
music and acting.  What isn't problematic, however, is Lynch's vision, which 
is more clear and daring than it had been with his last feature films, WILD AT 
HEART and FIRE WALK WITH ME, films where Lynch's world view took a back seat 
to cheap thrills.  There's cheap thrills here, but there's a lot more for
the adventuresome filmgoer to discover, too.  </P>
