<P>    As the most abstract of the arts, music is the only truly
universal language.  Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Vivaldi, and
Scarlatti can be understood and appreciated in any culture
just as the rock, punk and discotheque music have traveled
the globe, devoured by young people wherever governments
have allowed it entry.  No wonder, then, that a single violin
can make its way from Italy to Austria to England to China
and then cross the seas to Canada.  The sounds which this
instrument can produce afford uplift to those who inhabit
many cultures.  A well-made vehicle for delivering such
pleasure is bound to be in demand, particularly if the
instrument is an Amati, a Guarneri or a Stradivari.</P>
<P>   A stringed instrument is the principal character of this
masterful Canadian-Italian production.  The red violin is a
three-hundred year old piece of the finest craftsmanship,
constructed with particular love in 1681 by Nicolo Bussatti
(Carlo Cecchi), who dedicated it to his wife, Anna (Irene
Grazioli).  After Anna had died in childbirth (ironically enough,
since her fortune-telling servant assured her a long and
fruitful life), her husband secretly drained some of the blood
from the limp wrist of the corpse to create a unique rust color
for the instrument.  He could hardly have forseen the journey
this singular instrument would make during the subsequent
three centuries.  Had the violin been given the breath of life,
it would have experienced a dizzying range of incidents and
ordeals, shifting ownership and countries with the persistence
of a dedicated travel agent determined to grasp the soul of a
few of the world's most dramatic locales.</P>
<P>   "The Red Violin" beautifully exploits the qualities inherent in
the film medium.  The picture is exquisitely photographed  by
Alain Dostie to evoke the 17th Century continental charms of
Cremona in northern Italy, the stately pomp of Vienna as it
approaches its imperial glory, the Victorian countryside of
Oxford, England, the spirited revolutionary bustle of 1960s
Shanghai, and the cosmopolitan enticements of modern
Montreal.  We get a feel for the devotion which a master
craftsman has for his product, the sweat that goes into the
training of a gifted musician, and the financial rewards which
are promised to those who can competently exploit the
arduous work of others.  As the eponymous red violin makes
the rounds across borders and centuries, it is handled and
discussed by people of diverse temperaments until it lands in
the hands of its current owner by dint of an
uncharacteristically tension-filled conclusion.</P>
<P>   Following a screenplay penned by Don McKellar and his
own hand, director Francois Girard eschews the strictly
conventional narrative, peppering the chronicle with frequent
flashbacks and focusing particularly on an auction being held
at the Duval House in Montreal, where wealthy bidders from
various backgrounds have gathered to make offers on a set
of costly string instruments.  In the flashback style now
known by the tens of millions who have seen "The Phantom
of the Opera" on stage, director Girard takes us first to a
modern-day collection of affluent bidders and, upon the
dramatic presentation of the red violin, he transports us to
17th Century Italy, where Anna Bussotti is consulting with her
servant-diviner, Cesca (Anita Laurenzi).  As Cesca turns over
the Tarot cards she slowly reveals the future.  With each
card's turn, Girard takes us to a new country, another period,
as each prediction is played out.</P>
<P>   The violin turns up in Austria some one hundred years after
its creation, as Georges Poussin (Jean-Luc Bideau) takes his
very young prodigy, orphan Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz),
under his wing to prepare the six-year-old lad for a concert
before the emperor in Vienna.  The violin ultimately passes to
a band of gypsies who have purloined it, commuted to
England, and find a buyer in landowner-musician Frederick
Pope (Jason Flemyng)--who utilizes it well in an inspired
concert--following a brief and impassioned and decidedly un-
Victorian tryst he enjoys with his mistress, Victoria (Greta
Scacchi).  When Pope's servant (Stuart Ong) slinks with it
across the seas to his Shanghai home in the 1960s, it is
almost destroyed by cadres of the Cultural Revolution, who
consider it a symbol of western decadence.  Winding up at
auction, the Duval house in Montreal commissions expert
Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson) to certify its authenticity.
The violin is then poised for transfer to some lucky tycoon
with a couple of million dollars to spend, at which point the
handsome instrument can presumably prepare for another
three centuries or so of high adventure.</P>
<P>   One can understand the film's success in Canada, where
the movie industry has been following paths other than those
commonly trodden by Hollywood.  Since that country's
production of motion pictures began with "Evangeline" in
1914, Canada has had to compete with the far greater capital
enjoyed by its prosperous neighbor to the south.  After
decades of timidity and mediocrity, Canada broke through its
historic sluggishness in the 1980s and during our own
decade, making its mark even in some American circles with
the productions of David Cronenberg and Atom Egoyan.  If
any recent motion picture affords evidence that this vast
country has the scope, the confidence, the flair for sustaining
large-budget yet tasteful work, it would be "The Red Violin." 
Acted with intelligence, humor, wit and elegance by
performers as diverse as Chinese actress Sylvia Chang, the
American Samuel L. Jackson, and the absolutely superb
English thesp Jason Flemyng, "The Red Violin" joins vastly
appealing vistas with a powerful and original soundtrack
composed by John Corigliano--which is played with fervor by
Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonia Orchestra.  So
much care is placed on authenticity that cognoscenti will be
competent to identify time periods simply by feasting their
eyes on Renee April's lush costumes.  </P>
<P>   Francois Girard is no stranger to the genre, having favored
us six years ago with the stirring and innovative "Thirty-Two
Short Films About Glenn Gould," told to us like his thoroughly
accomplished current work in vignettes.  He has built upon
this forerunner exquisitely.  "The Red Violin" is a wholly
realized amalgam of sight, sound, and narrative.</P>
