<PRE>                                FLED 1996
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-( :-(  for a marriage on the run</PRE>
<P>Cast: Laurence Fishburne, Stephen Baldwin, Salma Hayek, Will Patton,
Robert John Burke, Victor Rivers, Robert Hooks, David Dukes, Brittney
Powell Director: Kevin Hooks Screenplay: Preston A. Whitmore 2d.</P>
<P>I don't know about you, but if two convicts (Fishburne and Baldwin),
handcuffed to each other jumped into my car, and ordered me to take them
home at gun point, I'd be wetting my pants. However, we have to hand it
to Salma Hayek for handling the situation very calmly, before
nonchalantly staring them in the eye and agreeing to their demands with
only the slightest of fuss. By the end of the short trip home, she has
these lawless men carrying groceries into her house, politely asking for
a shower in her bathroom, and wearing her ex-husband's baggy clothes.
What next? A marriage proposal?</P>
<P>That's right, a marriage proposal. Except the exchange of wedding vows
is between our two escaped convicts\heroes. It's an unofficial wedding,
with no guests except the police, and the cuffs symbolize the wedding
bands. There is no one to witness this binding contract except for God,
but who cares about the finer details when 5 million dollars is
involved. So this is vaguely how the vows go from memory.</P>
<P>'You see these chains, it means we're married.' Fishburne.
'Oh, yeah.' Baldwin.
'Yeah. For Better or worse. In sickness and in health. So you better do
what I say or I'll hit you.' Fisburne.</P>
<P>Baldwin punches Fishburne. Fishburne punches Baldwin back harder.</P>
<P>'Please don't hit me.' Baldwin.
'Why not?' Fishburne.
'Because I've got five million, and I'll give you one million.' Baldwin.</P>
<PRE>'I want half.' Fishburne.
'No.' Baldwin.</PRE>
<PRE>Fishburne hits Baldwin again.</PRE>
<P>'Okay, stop hitting me. I'll give you half. It's settled then.' Baldwin.</P>
<P>'Till death do us part.' Fishburne punches Baldwin. 'Now it's settled.'</P>
<P>Sigh. They sure don't make romantic comedies like they use to.</P>
