<P>I haven't seen such a lavish and exquisitely told Victorian era story
like 'An Ideal Husband' since Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence'
in 1993.  'An Ideal Husband' has all the admirable qualities of a story
and look similar to an installment of television's 'Masterpiece
Theatre'.  </P>
<P>The rules of society were strict and somewhat highly hypocritical in
many instances back in the days of long gowns and tuxedos for casual
wear.  Everyone in high society seemed upper crust and more trustworthy
than they are perceived today but there was still plenty of blackmail,
adultery, wheeling and dealing and manipulation to be found.</P>
<P>'An Ideal Husband' casts a negative light on the feisty brawl of
politics involving dishonour, blackmail, the manipulation of a fortune
and the will of one man to keep his dignity.  The film also runs a
perfect length of just over 90 minutes and this makes it appeal to those
who find this type of entertainment too highly enlightened for their own
tastes.</P>
<P>Set in England, Jeremy Northam portrays Sir Robert Chiltern.  A short
time before he is to give an denouncing address to the British
Parliament regarding British support to form a canal through Argentina,
he is approached by the underhanded Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore) who
supports the canal plan and wants Sir Robert to change his mind and
support it also or she will blackmail him with an incriminating letter
that will ruin his reputation and cause his life to come crashing down
like a house of cards.  Among the casualties in this house of cards is
Sir Robert's marriage to his wife Gertrude (Cate Blanchett).</P>
<P>The screenplay is by Oliver Parker based on a play by Oscar Wilde and
the dialogue is impeccably written to showcase the tongues of dignity
found in the era shown.  The film is relatively simple to follow, unlike
many films of its kind which take often needless sub plots and inject
them into a story where it isn't needed.  'An Ideal Husband' also has
the look of a Merchant-Ivory production and the sets, costumes,
cinematography and music score are all to be given an "A" for effort and
successful execution.</P>
<P>Other noteworthy members of the cast are Rupert Everett, Minnie Driver
and John Wood. No one seems out of place and everyone is casted
perfectly and the direction and screenplay adaptation by Oliver Parker
is truly an exercise in subtlety.</P>
<P>The mechanics of the film's overall climax are somewhat docile in nature
but are in keeping with many aspects of its own tone.  This film is the
type of achievement that I always argue keeps the movie industry alive
because the movies always keep tradition in focus.  Film is arguably the
most educational medium if the right movies are selected to show us a
little of the past that for the most part can pave our future.  This
film also draws heavily from the origins of theatre since it is based on
a play and the theatre for many is the true art of dramatic
presentation.</P>
