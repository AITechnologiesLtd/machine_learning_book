<PRE>**Air Force One**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>       Unlike L.A. Confidential - this movie made an absolute
TON of money at the box office. This in itself was very
surprising as I've yet to hear anyone but my brother talk about
this movie with any great enthusiasm. Airforce One is your
standard stock Hollywood Blockbuster....which was
disappointing. I did enjoy it to a certain degree as I'm a big
Harrison Ford fan, but it just wasn't anything special.</P>
<P>         This movie suffers from something that a lot of movies
in 1998 have in that in tries to cram too many things into it.
Some might say that it is to keep the pace of the film going, but
it just got a bit tiresome and the movie felt a lot longer than
two hours. It definitely followed the rule of 'more explosions is
better'. Unlike a lot of FX movies this year though, Air Force One has
a bit of substance to it. The plot, while not so original, is
handled more intelligently than many movies of this genre.</P>
<P>         Harrison does, as usual, a great job as the lead. Even
playing the U.S. President he portrays his typical down to
earth/ordinary man character. You did have to 'suspend your disbelief'
numerous times during the movie though when the 50+
year old President is duking it out with 25 year old trained
terrorists and always coming out without a bruise. My kingdom for a
hero who ends up with a black eye! </P>
<P>  Gary Oldman did a terrific job as the head terrorist, but the
character he was given to work with was really no different to those
seen in many other movies of this type. I was not terribly impressed
by Glenn Close, but that was mainly because of the character she
played. She is made out to be one of the heroes at the end for not
signing the motion to take away the President's powers, even though
his judgement was clouded. If Harrison hadn't 'saved the day' in the
end she would have been responsible for allowing the release of a
 homicidal madman responsible for 10 000's of deaths in
return for the half-dozen people left on the plane at that
stage. I personally did not see her decision as something
to cheer about no matter what happened at the end.</P>
<P>        The highlights? For me the best part was the initial
taking of the plane. It was so quick and 'full-on' that it was
genuinely startling even though you knew it was coming. The race to
get the President into the escape pod was one of the most exciting
sequences I've seen in a movie this year. The special effects
were much better than I expected, with the exception of the final
crash scene which was more than slightly unconvincing.</P>
<P>     One of the real faults of this movie was that some important
things integral to the plot were left unexplained. Chief among
these is the traitor inside the Secret Service detail. Why, after the
plane was taken, did he remain with the captives? Why did he
wait until the end when all his terrorist comrades were dead before
pulling a gun on the President? This made no sense at all.</P>
<P>     Looking back, this was an enjoyable movie held together by Ford's
typically charismatic performance and some nice FX
and action sequences. But as a whole it was not something to write
home about. I felt Executive Decision (another plane hijack
movie starring Kurt Russell) was a much better movie. Less special
effects than this movie, but the suspense was built up
extremely well towards the conclusion. Air Force One is one of the
better "Die Hard in a {insert location here}" clones, but a
clone is what it was. Nothing new here...</P>
