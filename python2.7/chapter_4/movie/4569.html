<PRE>                                 TOY STORY
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This movie sucks! No, just kidding. I'd like to be able to voice 
an opinion on this movie that doesn't match that of every other movie 
critic and film buff in the country, but I too enjoyed every second of 
TOY STORY. It is quite simply a movie for everyone, young or old, tall 
or short, thin or fat, ribbed or regular... And it proves audiences in this 
day and age can still be entertained by something wholesome and 
positive. It's a shame I haven't quite reached that point yet, but maybe 
in some distant utopian society of the future I won't feel the need to 
crack "ribbed or regular" jokes for cheap laughs.</P>
<P>        TOY STORY is a landmark achievement in that it's the first 
fully computer animated feature film, if you don't count Oliver Stone's 
NIXON. (I don't know what that was supposed to mean.) TOY STORY 
is a kids movie, but a lot of the jokes can be appreciated solely by us 
older folk. Don't tell me elementary school kids have any idea what the 
"laser envy" comment refers to, but they can enjoy the myriad physical 
comedy scenes in the movie. In every single appearance by Mr. 
Potatohead, you can count on some or all of his face being knocked 
off.</P>
<P>        There are a few humans in the movie, but the main characters 
are toys that act like humans when the humans aren't around. The toys 
belong to an elementary school kid named Andy, with Woody the 
sheriff cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks) as their leader because, after 
all, he's Andy's favorite. Every birthday and Christmas brings new toys 
to the universe, and a platoon of plastic soldiers is sent down to the 
living room on one such birthday to find out what presents may 
threaten Woody's position as favorite.</P>
<P>        Enter Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), an intergalactic 
astronaut action figure based on a popular cartoon show. He can fly 
and has laser beams and every other possible gimmick. 
Understandibly, Andy is in awe, as are the other toys. Afraid of losing 
his superiority, Woody decides to put Buzz in his place. That plan 
backfires and they both end up out in the real world, one dominated by 
speeding cars, dogs and mean little boys named Sid who torture toys 
for fun. Buzz and Woody are now forced to team up for survival, in a 
journey that comprises most of the movie.</P>
<P>        The vocal performances in the movie are all noteworthy. 
Hanks and Allen, as expected, are great but the minor characters also 
boost the movie. Don Rickles plays Mr. Potatohead devoid of his usual 
insensitive, politically-incorrect demeanor (Rickles, not Mr. 
Potatohead--although he's been known to crack an anti-egg joke every 
now and then too). John Ratzenberger provides the voice of Andy's 
piggybank as pretty much a revitalization of his Cliff Clavin character 
from "Cheers." The only thing missing is the catchphrase "It's a 
known fact..." And I didn't stick around for the closing credits but I'd 
swear the voice of the slinky dog was Jim "Ernest" Varney.</P>
<P>        TOY STORY is the best movie I saw at the theater this year, 
but then again the competition includes such bombs as NINE 
MONTHS, CLUELESS and HALLOWEEN VI. It's a terrific 
achievement in the field of computer animation (eclipsed only by the 
Dire Straits "Money For Nothing" video) and is also one of the most 
entertaining movies I've ever seen, certainly the best kids movie I've 
seen. If you haven't seen this movie yet, what the heck is wrong with 
you?!</P>
