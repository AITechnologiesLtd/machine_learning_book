<PRE>The Rugrats Movie
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>I've always enjoyed the few minutes that I've caught <I>The Rugrats<I> on
television. It wasn't absorbing enough to watch the entire program, but a
short time with Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil and Angelica was fun.</P>
<P>Unlike animated youngsters of yore, these aren't little angels. They talk
about boogers and laugh at bathroom humor. They stand a good chance of growing
up to become Beavis and Butthead.</P>
<P>In their feature length film debut, the kids get lost in a forest. They meet
up with a vicious wolf, mischievous monkeys and look for a magical "lizard"
who can grant them the wish to go home. Tommy is in charge of taking care of
his newborn baby brother and agonizes over his "sponsibility".</P>
<P>There are some funny bits. Their misunderstanding of adult words makes for an
occasional humorous pun. The phenomenon experienced by every parent of a baby
boy while changing diapers will have the audience laughing despite itself as a
rainbow forms in the misty air of the nursery.</P>
<P>Although their shorts on television are enjoyable, the film feels too long.
Considering the attention span of the target audience, I'm unsure that they
won't be squirming in their seats. When I saw the movie, one young boy had
more fun running to the back of the theater and rolling down the aisle and
then doing it again, and again.</P>
<P>Maybe that's all they want - big cartoon kids on the screen while the kids in
the audience have their own party. It's probably no coincidence that this
opens during Christmas shopping season: built-in mall babysitters.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and doesn't plan on
starting his Christmas shopping for, oh, about four weeks. Email electronic
gifts to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com">Redman@indepen.com</A>)</P>
