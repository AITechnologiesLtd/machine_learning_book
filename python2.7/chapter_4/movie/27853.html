THE LADY OF HAMRE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Watching Katrine Wiedemann's bleak THE LADY OF HAMRE (FRUEN PA HAMRE) is 
like taking some bitter medicine that you know is supposed to be good 
for you but whose taste can be hard to stomach.  An earnest and 
well-acted movie, it is one that you want to like, no matter how 
disheartening it becomes.  Telling the story of two abused, newly 
married sisters, it is set in what looks to be a couple of centuries ago 
in Denmark.</P>
<P>As the story opens, middle age Bente (Bodil Jørgensen) is told by her 
dying father that she is to be married to an oaf named Gorm (Bjarne 
Henriksen).  From the day of the wedding, Gorm makes it clear that he's 
more interested in one of the young servants than his wife.  Having sex 
with the pudgy Gorm is like being pinned by a beefy wrestler so Bente 
isn't missing much.  Bente, a quiet, resolute woman runs the farm, which 
her father leaves to her.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Bente's younger sister, Grethe (Rikke Louise Andersson) takes 
up residence in a fine house in the city after she marries the boyishly 
handsome Martin (Nicolaj Kopernikus).  Martin's parents prove just as 
crude and evil as Gorm so that Grethe's life is no better than her 
sisters.  It is a sad and depressing story whose saving grace is that it 
eventually puts us out of our misery.</P>
<P>THE LADY OF HAMRE runs 1:27.  The film is in Danish with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be an R for sex, nudity and 
violence and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.  </P>
