<PRE>THE OTHERS (2001) / *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by Alejandro Amenabar, based on his screenplay. Starring Nicole

<P>Synopsis: Grace (Kidman) lives with her young son and daughter on an 
isolated estate in the Channel Islands. Her children are photosensitive, 
and hence cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. The arrival of new 
servants precipitates strange noises and unexplained occurrences in the 
darkness-shrouded house. Is someone trying to drive Grace mad, or are 
unquiet spirits haunting her family?</P>
<P>Review: Haunted houses are a familiar staple of horror films, and "The 
Others" hardly reinvents the wheel. What it does offer, though, is a 
classy, gripping example of the genre: an unusually spooky and 
spine-tingling experience. Amenabar, making his first English-language 
movie, demonstrates his profound understanding of sound: his self-composed 
incidental music is effective, and silence plays an equally important role 
in building the suspense. Although Amenabar does spend a little too much 
time at the beginning of the picture laying his groundwork, things pick up 
noticeably through the final hour. The director makes judicious use of all 
the tricks in his toolbox of terror; there are enough frights to keep 
audiences on the edge of their seats, but not so many that they become 
commonplace. The inclusion of a nineteenth-century "Book of the Dead" is 
one of several particularly eerie moments. Kidman boosts the script's 
credibility with a terrific performance, playing Grace (think "Kelly") as 
a sympathetic woman who nonetheless possesses a singularly ruthless 
streak. Mann is notable as her creepy, strong-willed daughter. The film 
ends, "Sixth Sense"-style, with a surprise ending which Amenabar is wise 
not to overplay; his more subdued approach is likely to haunt even the 
steeliest of viewers.</P>
