<PRE>                                    SHINE
                      A film review by Laura & Robin Clifford
                       Copyright 1997 Laura & Robin Clifford</PRE>
<P>(This review is an excerpt from Reeling, a movie review show running
on Boston Cable TV, hosted by Laura and Robin Clifford. Note that the
film descriptions vary in completeness due to the fact that they're
actually intros for running film clips.)</P>
<P>"Shine" is the incredible story of Australian pianist David Helfgott,
a man pushed by his father and his love of music to excel, then held
back by that same man when his success results in scholarships to
study in America, then London's Royal Academy of Music.  Armin
Mueller-Stahl is the Holocaust-scarred Peter Helfgott whose pain at
having seen his family destroyed causes him to react with abusive
behavior when his own son wishes to leave the family nest.  David is
played from his teen years until his breakdown in his twenties by Noah
Taylor ("Flirting") and in his forties, when he's saved by the love
of Gillian (Lynn Redgrave) by Geoffrey Rush.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Shine" is the best feature film I've seen so far this year (although
I'm still totally enamored of the documentary "Paradise Lost" in my
number 1 slot).  Scott Hicks, an Australian director more known for
his documenaries, has done a masterful job presenting the life of a
tortured pianist to the screen.  He's assembled his film as a three
movement concerto, first taking his time to establish the very young
David Helfgott and David's family background, then going into
overdrive as David Helfgott as a young man suffers through the
conflict of how his success and the pursuit of his dreams tears him
away from his family and finally slowing the pace again as the older
David is brought back into real life from an institution by the love
of several women.</P>
<P>Armin Mueller-Stahl is Peter Helfgott, the sterm family patriarch who
urges his son to excellence, only to become abusive when his son
yearns to take advantage of a scholarship to London's Royal Academy of
Music leaving his family behind.  Mueller-Stahl manages to walk a fine
line and remains sympathetic as a Holocaust survivor who's seen his
family destroyed and will go to all lengths to keep his own family
intact even as he destroys his own son's sanity in the process.  Hicks
underscores Peter's character strongly visually - when David does
leave, Peter burns his scrapbooks chronicalling David's success and we
see the flames in Peter's glasses echo the Holocaust.  Peter's wife is
first presented silent and in shadow, where she remains for the most
part due to the power of his conviction.</P>
<P>Geoffrey Rush is astounding as the eldest of the three David Helfgott
portrayers.  The strange rhythms of his language (both verbal and
body) are right on target - he's still communicating at a very
intellectual level - one just has to adjust to where he's coming from.
He works well with Lynn Redgrave to adjust the hyper quality down a
knotch at a time.  Rush also learned how to key the piano (although
it's the real Helfgott we're hearing on the soundtrack) correctly so
that a double wouldn't have to be used!  That's applying oneself for a
role.</P>
<P>Noah Taylor is also fine as the troubled younger man whose attempt at
independence results in an emotional breakdown because of guilt.  His
intensity and nerdiness gradually drop away as he becomes accustomed
to college life under the tutilage of John Geilgud.</P>
<P>Lynn Redgraves comes into the film very late but still manages to make
a strong impression as the woman whose curiousity and concern allow
her to see beyond David's strangeness.  Her Gillian is a strong woman
who delights in life's pleasures.</P>
<P>British actress Goggie Withers adds a nice grace note as the younger
David's friend who supports his decision to break away from his
father.</P>
<P>"Shine" has a masterfully complementary score that accentuates the
story and the classical highlights of the film.  The scene where David
plays Rachmaninoff's "Piano Concerto No. 3" is simply one of the most
powerfully editted sequences I've seen in a film this year.</P>
<PRE>A+</PRE>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Laura and I saw "Shine" a few weeks ago, so I have had the opportunity
to ponder this film and the rest of the movies we've seen this year.
We still have a number of films to see before the year's end, but,
even so, I declare "Shine" to be the best film of the year!</P>
<P>Start with a fascinating true story of the live of pianist David
Helfgott. Add an intelligent screenplay by director Scott Hicks and
terrific performances by Geoffrey Rush as the elder David, Noah Taylor
as David the younger, and especially Armin Mueller-Stahl as David's
father - my hands down choice for best supporting actor for 1996; a
bevy of strong supporting characters, the likes of Lynn Redgrave and
Sir John Gielgud; and the best classical music I have seen/heard in a
film, ever.</P>
<P>What you get is a powerful character study of a musical genius nearly
destroyed by the good intentions and misguided love of his father.</P>
<P>Following the life of Helfgott as a young piano prodigy up through the
emotional break with his beloved father, his fall into madness from 
guilt over the break, to his recovery and subsequent return to music,
"Shine" is an extraordinary example of top notch filmmaking.</P>
<P>Praising the three who played Helfgott at various stages is easy.  The
threes, Alex Rafalowcz, Taylor and Rush are beautifully cast as the 
genius at the various life stagess.  The transition from one to the 
next is seamless because it feels like the same person.  Geoffrey
Rush, especially, stands out as the elder Helfgot.  He is on screen
for only 20-30 minutes of the film, but makes such a strong
impression, his performance feels like a starring role.</P>
<P>Armin Mueller-Stahl is, in a film steeped in brilliance, the best
thing in this movie, and that's saying something.  As Peter Helfgott,
David's father, he displays such a range of emotion - love, jealousy,
pettiness, selfishness and confusion - so effectively, that I can't
think of a better performance this year.  You, the viewer, end up both
feeling sorry for and loathing the man at the same time.  This is no
small feat for an actor.  Mueller-Stahl pulls it off brilliantly.</P>
<P>The musical selections, especially Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3
as the film's focal point, are magnificent.  The Rach piece, played as
David falls into madness, is the singularly most stunning visual and
audio music experience that I have had watching a film.  The music is
played by Helfgott himself, but the actors are the ones who appear to
be playing.  It is as beautiful a crafting of movie magic as I have
ever seen.</P>
<P>For award purposes, "Shine" deserves, right now, best picture,
direction, screesnplay, supporting actor and, maybe, best actor for
Geoffrey Rush. High praise for a film, but deservedly so.</P>
<P>After much thinking, I have to agree with Laura and give "Shine" an
A+, my first for 1996!  Would I say it's worth it?  Yeah.</P>
