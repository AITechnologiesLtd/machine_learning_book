<P>In movieland, January is known for two things. First, viewers get to
see those prestige films that opened exclusively in NYC and LA in
December to qualify for the Academy Awards. Second, the studios use
the month to burn off those action flicks and comedies deemed too weak
to make the grade during the competitive holiday season. "Play It to
the Bone" fits squarely in the latter category. Even though the movie
boasts a well-known cast and a writer/director with a great track
record, it suffers from a meandering, anemic screenplay and ungainly
structure. This is the kind of film best enjoyed on cable or video,
where you can lay on the couch and appreciate its pleasures without
sacrificing the time and money for a trip to the theater.</P>
<P>The storyline is the basic stuff of most sports movies. Following the
death of two middleweight fighters, boxing promoter Joe Domino (Tom
Sizemore) must find last minute substitutes to fill the opening card
for a high profile Mike Tyson match. He contacts Cesar Dominguez
(Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody Harrelson), ex-contenders
who now eke out a living as sparring partners in a sleazy LA gym, and
offers $50,000 to each man, with the promise that the winner will get
a shot at the middleweight championship.</P>
<P>With visions of success and fame dancing through their heads, the best
friends convince Grace Pasic (Lolita Davidovich), who has been
romantically involved with both men, to give them a ride to Las
Vegas. And so the three hop in her lime-green 1972 Olds convertible
and leave for the big match, taking the "scenic route" to pad out the
movie.</P>
<P>The bulk of "Play It to the Bone" is a road story and it's a long
drive. Writer/director Ron Shelton, known for finely drawn
examinations of the relationship dynamics between athletes ("Bull
Durham," "White Men Can't Jump," "Tin Cup"), creates some sparkling
moments, but not enough to keep the trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas
from becoming tedious. When the guys finally square off in the ring,
the film kicks into high gear, with dynamic play by play scenes that
pack a visceral wallop. But then Shelton spoils things with a cop-out
denouement that leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</P>
<P>Antonio Banderas and Woody Harrelson do admirable work fleshing out
their characters. Using an uncharacteristically simplistic sit-com
mentality, Shelton gives each man one major personality quirk to make
him more colorful. Banderas' Cesar casually mentions that, after
losing a match to a gay boxer, he "tried being a fag for about a
year," in the superstitious hope of capturing the winning spirit of
his victor. Harrelson's Vince is an unfocused born-again Christian and
reacts to his friend's revelation with disgust, fueling numerous
arguments between the two.</P>
<P>Banderas is good in his most challenging English language role to
date. He paints Cesar as a none-too-bright, extremely likable man
whose machismo is neatly balanced by his gentle, childlike side. His
openness concerning his sexual confusion is refreshing and adds to the
charm of the character. Although playing an ornery redneck is nothing
new for Harrelson, he still acquits himself nicely, although, with
each new film, the rabid dog gleam in his eye becomes a bit more
pronounced, pulling him further and further away from that sweet,
innocent bartender I loved so much on "Cheers."</P>
<P>In the middle of the mix is Grace, who plays mind games with both men
to juice them up for the match. Easily smarter than both guys put
together, Grace knows just what to say to ratchet up the tension
level, and Lolita Davidovich deftly adds layers of vitality and heart
to her thinly-written character. "Ally McBeal's" Lucy Liu pops up
briefly as a fiery hitchhiker. Liu is clearly intended to increase the
sizzle within the trio, but comes off more as just another way for
Shelton to kill time before the trio arrives in Las Vegas.</P>
<P>Why he felt the need to stretch out the road trip is beyond me. To be
sure, for the climactic boxing match to have sufficient dramatic
impact, we need time to get to know the players, but devoting
two-thirds of the movie to the journey is absurd. After a while, I
felt like a kid sitting in the back seat of the convertible, bouncing
up and down while pleading "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?" Once
we do arrive, Banderas and Harrelson are so entertaining in their
exhaustive big bout (complete with some very funny hallucinations)
that the main question becomes "was that trip really necessary?" Had
Ron Shelton pared about 30 minutes off the drive, the answer might
have been "Yes."</P>
