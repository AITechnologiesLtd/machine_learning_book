<PRE>                        CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                     Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is the best spy film to be
     released in several years.  It is also the most
     intelligent film in the Jack Ryan series based on the Tom
     Clancy novels so far.  Screen credit goes to three top-
     notch screenwriters.  There is one breath-taking action
     sequence, a generous dollop of government skullduggery,
     and a plot that will seem to be taken from headlines of
     recent U.S. history.  This is as good as any of the James
     Bond films.  Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     When the U.S. Coast Guard intercepts a derelict yacht floating in
American waters, it discovers that it was the scene of a grisly set of
murders.  The victim was a prominent businessman and his family, all
personal friends of U.S. President Bennett (Donald Moffat).  Bennett is
shocked and angry, particularly when investigation proves the murdered
man had financial ties to Columbian drug lords.  Bennett hints to his
security advisors that the time has come to start striking back against
the Columbian drug families.  And the action taken and its results are
the heart of this story.</P>
<P>     Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan, and he remains a disappointing
choice.  Ryan is someone who should be alert, perhaps hyper-active, and
should have a youthful appearance to live up to his boy scout image.
Even with his character under fire, Ford seems only 90% awake.  He is
popular with audiences, but his acting is a liability, in my opinion.
Donald Moffat returns to playing a President not unlike his Lyndon
Johnson of THE RIGHT STUFF.  Adding no new tricks to his bag, Harris
Yulin, familiar for many roles as villains, plays National Security
Advisor James Cutter.  Willem Dafoe does not stretch his talents much as
a commando.  Anne Archer repeats her role as Cathy Ryan.  Miguel
Sandoval is a rather winning rich drug lord.  It is probably Moffat and
Sandoval who stand out as the better actors of the film.  But the
emphasis is more on the story than on acting.</P>
<P>     Phillip Noyce, the director of the (recommended) thriller DEAD
CALM, and the less satisfying PATRIOT GAMES does have a better script to
work from in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.  Generally a script credited to
three people will have some problems, but CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER seems
to suffer from this less than most such films.  That could be because of
who the three people are.  One is John Milius who wrote films like
MAGNUM FORCE, APOCALYPSE NOW, CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and general action
films.  Then there is Donald Stewart, veteran of MISSING and the two
previous Jack Ryan films.  The third writer was Steven Zaillian, whose
screen credits include AWAKENINGS, PATRIOT GAMES, SEARCHING FOR BOBBY
FISCHER, and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  It is an unlikely trio, but it works in
a script that has action and is cerebral.  Somebody at Paramount was
concerned about getting good writing and the screenwriting credits are
as impressive as any of the other credits.</P>
<P>     The script is good, but not perfect.  Toward the end of the film
the action starts becoming a little less intelligent and a little more
action-oriented.  In short, it becomes a little too reminiscent of James
Bond films.  Though an action sequence in the first third is very well
done (if one ignores a touch of cliched slow motion).  This one piece is
the high point of the film and really leaves the audience breathless.
After Ryan escapes from this trap, there is little else he does that is
as impressive.  A sequence intercutting between a formal ceremony and a
bloody massacre perhaps borrows a little heavily from the "Godfather"
films.  Also refreshing in the writing is the presence of a strong and
intelligent woman who is clearly not present for decorative value.  But
what is most impressive in this film is the moral ambiguity of Ryan's
position.  Ryan remains the hero to the audience, but for the first time
in the series, a serious case could be made that he is not acting in the
best interests of the United States.</P>
<P>     Of course the classic spy film series to date has been the James
Bond series.  What I think is often forgotten is that the Bond films all
too often had contrived and simplistic plots.  They were better than
this year's TRUE LIES in that regard, but there was little to engage the
viewer's mind.  The plots were too dependent on chase sequences and
fight scenes.  The other extreme is a story like TINKER, TAILOR,
SOLDIER, SPY in which everything that goes on is cerebral.  The Jack
Ryan films are a happy medium between the two and none more so than
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.</P>
<P>     There are more reasons to prefer Ryan to Bond for spy films.  The
Bond films spend a lot of time on sexual subplots.  It is fun, but it
takes valuable time from the plot.  It is always clear that Ryan's best
working organ is between his ears.  Clancy's Ryan is a happily married
family man who doesn't fool around ... in any sense of the word.  With
that screen time out of the way, the writing has more room for
intelligence (no pun intended).  And unlike in Bond films which have
long chase scenes, one never feels that it is action scenes alone
driving the plot.  The action pieces are there, but they serve the plot
rather than the reverse.  I think I can safely say that CLEAR AND
PRESENT DANGER not only has a more satisfying plot than any of the Bond
films, it is even the best of the Ryan films.  The basic idea of the
last two films could really be told with some justice in one or two
sentences each.  That is most definitely not the case in CLEAR AND
PRESENT DANGER.  The game keeps changing for Jack Ryan through the
entire film.  Rather than this being a two-sided game, there is the kind
of chaos one gets with several sides pulling in different directions.
The script makes clever use of recent U.S. history to tell parts of the
story that there would not be time to tell explicitly in the film.
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is the best spy films in several years.  It
also is as riveting as any Bond film ever made.  I would give CLEAR AND
PRESENT DANGER a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
