<PRE>                 THE EXTRAORDINARY VISITOR (Canadian)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: John the Baptist is sent from Heaven to see is the world
is worth saving.  He must find some sign of hope in the people of
Newfoundland.  This is little more than a TV skit in movie form.  It is
watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in Canada, but it
is unlikely to be seen on the international market.  It is diverting
but hardly a serious piece of cinema.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to
+4) Minor spoilers in this review.</P>
<P>   - Written and directed by John W. Doyle.
   - John the Baptist sent to St. John, Newfoundland.  Gets an
     invitation to live with a family.  That extraordinary hospitality
     for some reason does not count as a reason for hope.
   - Script has a lot of holes.
   - Friend who adopts John is surprisingly militant and is planning
     actions to destabilize Wall Street.
   - John does look Middle Eastern, but somehow one expects John the
     Baptist to be more dramatic.
   - There is a conspiracy in the Vatican riding on the result of the
     visit, though that result seems small compared to the end of the
     world.
   - Big yucks like seeing a nun give the Pope a pedicure and evil
     Pope's aid praying to a Mendes goat.
   - In large part a satire of life in Newfoundland taking licks at
     things like the poor produce.  The one good tomato in grocery (by
     virtue of a miracle) "must have fallen off the truck to Toronto."
   - Based on a 20-minute short film.</P>
