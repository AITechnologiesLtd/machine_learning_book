<P>Most of us are determined to get through this life without witnessing a man
nailing his johnson to a board. So it is with extreme caution and deep
respect for the public's gag reflex that I recommend `Sick: The Life and
Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist.'</P>
<P>Certainly, this startling documentary will be one of the most unpleasant
experiences you're likely to have in a movie house not involving Walter
Matthau and Jack Lemmon. But at the same time, it is a luminous statement
about art's ability to trump death. In the end, it's hard to determine
what's more difficult to watch: a man mutilating his own body or the same
man facing the very real specter of death.</P>
<P>Bob Flanagan is the kind of man who would give Jesse Helms a stroke. One of
the longest known survivors of cystic fibrosis -- a fatal disease of the
lungs that usually takes its victims in childhood or early adulthood --
Flanagan discovered the joys of sado-masochism in his teens. By the time he
reached 40, he had become an icon of the perverse, an artist locked into a
weird one-upmanship with the disease that was destroying his body.</P>
<P>Filmmaker Kirby Dick does not flinch from Flanagan's excesses. That nifty
demonstration of Flanagan's carpentry skills mentioned earlier is deeply
revolting, but it is only one in a long list of Stupid Human Tricks he
performs. He is spanked, cut with blades, burned, pinched, buggered, bound,
strangled, humiliated, mostly at the hands of dominatrix Sheree Rose, his
long-time lover and torturer. If Rose treats Bob like a giant steak in need
of tenderizing, she does so with an skewed sense of gratitude and motherly
devotion.</P>
<P>As an artist, Flanagan used a deadpan, at times morbid wit to express his
day-to-day misery, evoking the horror of his disease by illustrating its
principal by-product, i.e. the fluids that filled his lungs and gave him an
everpresent menacing cough (Wait till you see `The Visible Man'). One of
the film's more twisted visuals is taken from the opening of one of
Flanagan's New York art shows. While most artists would be sitting in the
corner in a nice sweater sipping chardonnay, Bob is hanging aloft, naked,
by his feet from the ceiling like some prized marlin. Whatever turns you
on, guy.</P>
<P>As a jarring and sad contrast, Flanagan's aging parents, the picture of
cozy middle American domesticity, are also interviewed. Despite living with
the dread disease through their children (Bob's two sisters also died of
CF), they seem perplexed about Bob's, uh, unusual lifestyle. `Where was I?'
asks Mom, shaking her head in sorrow.</P>
<P>`Sick' takes an astonishing turn when Flanagan's disease finally seizes the
upper hand. Director Dick was given full access to Flanagan's life even
when both knew that he wouldn't survive much longer. It is mesmerizing and
profoundly moving to see this S&M exhibitionist turn into a bewildered
child at death's doorstep. Flanagan's death is recorded with a tenderness
and dignity you wouldn't expect after seeing him utterly destroy the
mystique of physical pain.</P>
<P>An important collaborator was Flanagan's tormentor/lover Sheree Rose who,
as Bob's Yoko, had originally decided not to allow Kirby Dick to make the
movie. Eventually, she came around and made available many of her own
private videos of Bob, including some astounding footage in which Bob
painfully tries to persuade her that he is simply not up to taking her
punishment anymore.</P>
<P>Rose, it should be noted, does not come off like a monster, despite her
severe attitude toward Flanagan. In the end, she is genuinely
grief-stricken and, at this point it becomes apparent that the harsh
language of S&M they used between them was indeed a lovers' dialogue.
`Sick' is full of agony, disease, pain and more than enough stomach-turning
scenes of mutilation. To watch it is a small act of courage, which is
fitting considering the monstrous courage Bob Flanagan was able to summon
to live like he did. Only, don't ever expect to be able to hammer a nail
again without a flutter of fear in your belly. That you would be your Inner
Bob speaking.</P>
