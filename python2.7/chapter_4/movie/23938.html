<PRE>Grade: **** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>Before I review Mike Figgis' extremely unique new film
Time Code, it is necessary to list the reasons for why
this is one of the most original films ever created. </P>
<P>1)Time Code is one of the first films to be entirely
filmed using a digital video camera.</P>
<P>2)Time Code is shot in real time. It is filmed under
one take lasting 93 minutes.</P>
<P>3)Time Code is filmed using four different cameras.
Each camera follows certain characters around Los
Angeles. To show all of the cameras, the screen is
divided into four segments. </P>
<P>4)Time Code has no script. The actors improvised based
on an outline written by Figgis.</P>
<P>5)Time Code was shot fifteen different times. Figgis
then chose the take he was most pleased with (the
fifteenth).</P>
<P>6)Time Code is synchronized to the second. Since the
four cameras interact with each other (sometimes a
character in the third quadrant calls another via cell
phone in the first quadrant), the timing must be
perfect for the film to make any sense. </P>
<P>7) Time Code's outline was written on a sheet of music
paper, with four different lines, each line telling
each camera where to go at every moment.</P>
<P>8)Time Code, in order to avoid confusing the audience
contains a soundtrack in which three of the four
segments are muted or at a low volume, while the
fourth is at normal volume. </P>
<P>Despite the small errors in the film's plot, Time
Code, receives a perfect score for its fabulous acting
and overall creativity. Figgis' picture is certain to
inspire future works and for this reason alone, it is
recommended. It is always great to see big time
directors and actors trying something complete
different from the mainstream, and in the case of Time
Code, it is even better to see them create a memorable
film at the same time. Time Code is a different
experience at the movie theater than most films. It
took a while for me to adjust to its format almost
like it is uncomfortable to sleep in a brand new bed
or live in a new house. However, once I grew more
accustomed to its layout, what seemed impossible to
enjoy (four cameras on one screen; how would I
understand what is going on? How would I be able to
follow everything?) turned out to be a mesmerizing
display. Time Code glued my eyes to the screen in
fascination from the dazzling opening credits to the
equally dazzling closing credits. </P>
<P>The film is an examination of Los Angeles at its most
chaotic (every once in a while there is a brief
earthquake that simultaneously shakes the four cameras
and the myriad characters). More specifically, Time
Code revolves around a small movie production company
called Red Mullet. At Red Mullet, executives ponder
upcoming movie ideas, beautiful women audition for
film roles, and people gossip among many other things
including sex and murder. With all of this occurring
during a mere hour and a half, one can hardly imagine
how crazy a day in this place must be or even a week.
There are some flaws in the film including
underdeveloped roles or cliched characters, but the
outstanding acting covers the mistakes up very
efficiently. It is important to realize that these
actors were not given complete scripts but just
outlines of who they are supposed to be. Figgis
depended on the actors' charismatic qualities in real
life to fill the roles in the film. All of the actors
bring their talents into the ensemble cast including
Salma Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn as a lesbian
couple, Stellan Skarsgard as a sex and drug obsessed
executive, and Saffron Burrows as his troubled wife.
Other supporting actors bring a needed comedic aspect
to the movie including Julian Sands, Allesandro
Nivola, and Steven Weber. </P>
<P>Time Code's release in the year 2000 is a harbinger
for new technological age in filmmaking.  The use of
digital video is expected to increase dramatically in
future years in households and in movie studios. I
really hope Time Code becomes the next Blair Witch
Project and not just another limited release doomed
for a short life in the movie theaters. This is a film
you have to see on the big screen. </P>
