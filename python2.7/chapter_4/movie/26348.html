<P>   What a fine society we'd have if people were all community
minded.  Usually, though, each of us acts to benefit not only
himself but his immediate family and maybe best friends as
well.  Only after that do we look after the welfare of
the greater society.  This comes across as the subtext of
James Gray's taut, restrained, suspenseful drama of people
acting in a corrupt manner to allow their own cliques to
prosper at the expense of the greater society.  Filmed in New
York City, particularly in the boroughs of Queens and
Brooklyn, Gray's movie aptly demonstrates the backstabbing
and betrayals that we all know go on in local politics.  Thanks
to a fine cast of celebrated performers, the script written
by the director and Matt Reeves cleverly communicates this
pattern of duplicity by pointing out the cynical ways that
loyalties change in a moment.  Given the right circumstances,
your best friend can quickly become your assassin, your
oppressed group can shed its airs of martyrdom to demand
its own share of unscrupulously derived loot.</P>
<P>   As the tale unfolds, we discover that Leo Handler (Mark
Wahlberg) is the only good man in an extended company of
family, friends, and rivals in business. After unfortunately
taking a bum rap for stealing some cars, he serves part of his
term and, seeking a gig to please his parole officer, he
asks his uncle Frank Olchin (James Caan) for a job in a
company that builds and repairs subway cars for the city of
New York.  Devoted to his sick mother Val (Ellen Burstyn),
Leo does not have the patience to take a two-year training
program in school, so he hooks up with his best friend, Willie
Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix), who like Uncle Frank is
engaged in shady dealings involving payoffs to cops and
politicians.  Willie, like Frank, wants only to provide the good
things for the family he anticipates having with his gorgeous
girl friend Erica (Charlize Theron--here with black hair to give
her the appropriate ethnic look), and while he brings his pal
Leo into his disreputable arrangement, he will not hesitate to
sell the young man out if his own neck is on the line.</P>
<P>   James Gray, whose previous work, "Little Odessa,"
portrays a hitman who is disowned by his adulterous father
during a bleak Brooklyn winter, is in his element.  Gray is
adept at conveying the drama's melancholy atmosphere in
the way he partially lights the faces of his characters as they
act out their conspiracies in indoor locations and is equally
competent at imparting the sensuality of a samba-loving
nightclub known as Club Rio, the happy dancers bearing their
upraised arms as they swing and sway to the pulsating
rhythms of the night.  </P>
<P>   Part of the picture takes place in an actual  subway yard,
known to New Yorkers as a place so immense that fun-loving
teens are able to patrol the area at night affixing their favorite
graffiti to the sides of the cars.  The damage is greater in this
case, though, as groups of thugs hired by a company eager
to procure valuable city contracts go about the business of
vandalizing competing companies' work in order to discredit
them.</P>
<P>   Mark Wahlberg, whose sullen bearing anchors this
generally gripping movie, is wonderfully cast--a young man
who compared to those around him is almost a saint and who
eventually plays Serpico in the mean streets of one of New
York's outer boroughs.  The friendship between him and his
friend played by Phoenix is as palpable as the affection
portrayed between Phoenix and Theron.  Recall Phoenix's
striking role as Marcus Aurelius's backstabbing Commodus in
"The Gladiator" and you have an idea of how  this fine actor
can play the part of betrayer in his sleep.  Particularly striking
as well is Howard Shore's score, somber music which never
needs to be pumped up, as "The Yards" is anything but the
typical Hollywood slam-bam gangster melodrama that forever
captures the attention of a less discerning audience.</P>
