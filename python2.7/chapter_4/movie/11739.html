<PRE>BOYS' NIGHT OUT</PRE>
<PRE>United States 1962
Director: Michael Gordon</PRE>
<P>Cast: Kim Novak, James Garner, Tony Randall, Howard Morris,
Howard Duff, Oskar Homolka</P>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5</PRE>
<P>I love this movie, and I've just seen for the
umptenth time. Unfortunately, it is also completly
unknown and very few have seen it. It's my mission
in life to spread the word: see this movie!</P>
<P>Fred, George, Doug and Howie are reaching middleage.
Three of them have a wife, kids and a house in
the suburb with a mortgage to pay. Only Fred
is still a bachelor.
Together they take the local train every morning
to work in town. On one of their organized Thursday
evenings at a bar, Fred tells them of his boss and
the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress.
He has gotten an apartment in downtown where he
can meet her but has told his wife that he
needs the apartment to spend the night after
staff meetings every Thursday night.</P>
<P>Since they always split everything four ways,
they decide that they should get an apartment
with a young woman as well, Kathy. However,
Kathy isn't completly honest to them. In fact,
she is a sociology student writing a thesis
about the sex life of the suburban male.
With these four species she believes that she
will make a very good paper.</P>
<P>OK, have one thing clear though. The romantic
rendezvous' between Kathy and each of the men
are completly innocent. The script stays above
the waist - or to be precise, above the neck.
Noboyd claims that Kathy is their mistress, the
four guys call her their 'companion'. The
censorship board here in Sweden considered it
to be suitable only for people above 15 years,
but that only shows how long ago 1962 was. Small
children could watch this without being corrupted.</P>
<P>Kim Novak is as lovely as always in this movie,
even if she seems to be a bit too old for a
student. James Garner is the playboy just like
in many other movies. I liked Howard Morris the
best as Howard the accountant who has to diet
to support his wife. Tony Randall is funny as
always.</P>
<P>1962 was more than 35 years ago. How many
accountants, copywriters or investment bankers
can today afford to live in a house in the suburb
with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work?
This is the white middle class, I can't remember
that I saw any blacks on the commuter train
they use. These are the people who can count
on their kids to live an even better life than
themselves. Perhaps this should also be a
subject for a thesis in movie sociology?</P>
