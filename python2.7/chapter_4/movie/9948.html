<PRE>Mortal Kombat Annihilation (1997)
A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp
Copyright 1997 by Serdar Yegulalp</PRE>
<P>CAPSULE: A step down from the earlier movie: not as enjoyable, not as
well-done, but a pleasant enough timekiller.</P>
<P>Readers with 85 minutes just burning a hole in their pockets will probably
do a lot worse than to catch MORTAL KOMBAT ANNIHILATION, but on the other
hand, they could do a lot better -- like watch the first movie in the
series. MKA is a brave attempt to follow up the surprisingly fun original,
but it doesn't quite work.</P>
<P>MKA picks up *exactly* where the previous movie left off, with denizens of
the outer dimensions breaking the cosmic laws of Mortal Kombat (the better
to invade earth). Two of the first movie's characters -- Liu Kang and Sonya
-- are back, as well as Raiden, but both Raiden and Sonya are played by
different actors. The original Sonya was Bridgette Wilson; the new one is
the less engaging Sandra Hess. Even worse is the cycling-out of Christopher
Lambert as Raiden (a big loss), and the substitution of the more stolid
James Remar -- a good actor, but not quite what's needed here.</P>
<P>However, the movie does try to make up for what it loses in personality by
stirring some new characters into the mix. The best of the bunch is Lynn
Williams (a former American Gladiator regular) as Jax, who steals every
scene he's in with his glib comebacks and his cybernetic arms.</P>
<P>There's also more liberal use of effects -- especially Hong Kong-style
wire-fighting moves, which give the movie's fighting scenes a different
flavor than the original. In the original, the fights were more
straightforward and looked more like they sprung from credible efforts on
the part of the fighters. Here, it's completely over the top and hence less
directly compelling.</P>
<P>The movie does manage to hum along nicely without getting boring; there's
always something neat to look at. But it doesn't pack quite the same level
of genial joy that the first one did. Looks like pulling off this sort of
thing is a lot harder than people admit.</P>
