<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>     To truly enjoy 'Starship Troopers', you have to leave all thought of
plotting and character development at the door.  You also have to remember
that with a budget of 100 million dollars, there isn't a lot of money left
to hire big name stars.  The real stars of this movie are the special
effects which rank as both ground breaking and mind numbing.  The entire
film is a constant barrage of extreme violence and frightening pops of large
alien insects which devour humans by breaking apart their bodies and the
audience sees it all in full motion but the editing is appropriately handled
through fast cutting and you have very little time to think about what
you've just seen before the next scenario begins.</P>
<P>     Director Paul Verhoeven ('RoboCop', 'Total Recall', 'Basic Instinct')
formulates his movie in his typical visual manner when dealing with science
fiction which relies heavily on futuristic shock value in a world he creates
based on academic predictions of things to come.  His vision of the future
is often bleak like it was in 'RoboCop' but when sticking to a present day
Earthly film like 'Basic Instinct', Verhoeven exploits sex as much as he
does violence in his other films.  Some would accuse him of being excessive
in his display of these elements but all directors can't be subtle.  While
I've never found any statement in his films, I have generally been
entertained and knew what to expect coming in to this one.</P>
<P>     A group of fresh faced college graduates decide to enlist in the
futuristic military based on Earth but the technology in the future allows
them to explore regions of the universe presently unthinkable.  There is a
planet sending meteors to Earth which contain giant insect creatures which
kill Earthlings by the millions and the new recruits look at their
enlistment as more of an adventure rather than as an entrance way to Hell.</P>
<P>     The cast is headed by Casper Van Dien who plays Johnny Rico, a grunt
private who works his way up the military ranks as the film progresses.  His
fellow colleagues are Dina Meyer and Jake Busey and the girl he always loved
(Denise Richards) has joined a 
different branch of the military and they rarely see each other.  Another
colleague
(Neil Patrick Harris) has joined military intelligence and is key to the
film's resolution.  The military officers in the film (Michael Ironside and
Clancy Brown) are casted appropriately and are totally believable.</P>
<P>     The technical aspects of 'Starship Troopers are of the highest calibre
and I predict Academy Awards and possible wins for the special effects and
thunderous soundtrack which puts you into the action as if you're on screen
with everyone else in the film.  This upscale production has breathed
continuing life into the science fiction genre and while Hollywood
technology is better than ever and movie screenplays are worse than ever,
'Starship Troopers' demonstrates that the former can be a bonus to a movie
going experience.</P>
