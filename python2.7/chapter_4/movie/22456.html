<P>Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Daryl Mitchell, Tony Shalhoub,
Enrico Colantoni. Directed by Dean Parisot. Rated PG.</P>
<P>You'd think it would be easy to spoof Star Trek, but try spoofing it
without cruelly mocking it. That's a bit more difficult. The farfetched
sci-fi series is, after all, enormously popular, what with its gigantic
fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies. If
you're not nice to it, you lose. Galaxy Quest is to Star Trek what Mel
Brooks's Spaceballs was to Star Wars, an affectionate, riotously funny
parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but
never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned.</P>
<P>"The show's been cancelled, but the journey is far from over." That is
the current tagline of "Galaxy Quest," a Star Trek - type show that's
no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns. It also lives on in
conventions, gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to
dress in "Galaxy Quest" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions
about its delirious technobabble.</P>
<P>Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) played "Commander Peter Quincy Taggart" on
the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about
the gigs they have to do. The attitudes of the rest -- Tommy Webber
(Daryl Mitchell, Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Fred Kwan (Tony
Shalhoub) and Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) -- range from indifference
to utter contempt. Dane, who played a Spock-like alien, is especially
disgusted, considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly
refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line "By Grabthar's
Hammer, you shall be avenged" (or something like that) for his die-hard
fans.</P>
<P>One day, Nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "Galaxy
Quest" followers. They are actually aliens from a planet known as
Thermia. They have mistaken the "Galaxy Quest" episodes for historical
documentation of actual heroic space travel. The next day, the
Thermians whisk Nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the
evil Sarris (named, in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags, after
Village Voice film critic Andrew Sarris). Nesmith thinks it is only an
elaborate gig, and sort of blows it off, but when he is transported --
or I should say shot -- back to Earth in a rather celestial manner, he
believes.</P>
<P>Next thing the cast knows, they are being dragged by Nesmith to this
spaceship. Of course, they all think he is out of his mind and once he
does convince them that there really is a spaceship, what they want to
do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them. But
after some persuading, they stay on to fight the icky Sarris and find a
way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing Thermians.</P>
<P>I was quite surprised how well this comedy, which came off as utterly
brainless from its marketing campaign, worked. Taking shots at both the
obvious and not-so-obvious elements of Star Trek and its fandom, Galaxy
Quest never goes for cheap laughs, opting instead for broad but smart
parody. Nothing is safe -- not the cliches, not the fans, not the
absurd taglines -- but on the other hand, everything is safe, since
Galaxy Quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even
subtle admiration.</P>
<P>The highlight of the movie is Tony Shalhoub's Fred a.k.a. Tech Sergeant
Chen who, when in character, is the complete opposite of Scotty from
the original Star Trek. While Scotty, who was the technician for the
Enterprise would constantly yell "I NEED MORE POWER DOWN HERE
CAPTAIN!", Chen's cry for help is more to the tune of "The core, like,
won't take it or something." It's a hoot, but it doesn't stop there:
Weaver, whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the
computer says and Rickman, with his relentlessly holier-than-thou
attitude aren't far behind.</P>
<P>Galaxy Quest succeeds as a funny parody of Star Trek and while it's not
a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it
is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all
the sober Oscar contenders being released this holiday season. By
Grabthar's hammer, this is a hell of a movie.</P>
