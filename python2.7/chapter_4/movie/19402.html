<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> All right.  I never saw Porky's, I missed Animal House, and the entire
genre of sex comedy isn't really my forte, but I know good movies when I see
them, and take it from me, American Pie is good on its own.</P>
<P> The funniest movie I have see so far this year (although that may change
when I see South Park), American Pie is the story of the common high
schooler on the common high school quest: to get laid.  And, like any man
faced with the prospect of unwillingly going to college a virgin, they are
going out of their minds.  So, in the morning after a beer party at which it
appears everyone was having sex but them, the four (led by Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas), who just lost his girlfriend over his desire to go all the way
instead of settle for getting head.) make a pact to get laid by the prom.
Of course, the funniest thing about this is the speech Kevin makes about the
virtues of helping each other get laid --Sometimes, when you're exercising,
you need a spotter, someone to make sure you keep going," he says.  That, he
proposes, is the function each of them will serve for one another.</P>
<P> Jim (Jason Briggs) attempts to go about this by helping a Chezch vixen,
Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) with her studies and offering to help in more
obscene matters.  When a netbroadcast goes terribly wrong, he turns to the
already infamous flute-girl Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), and if you don't
know where the flute goes, you can be pleasantly surprised.  Oz (Chris
Klein), jock to the core, joins the choir to get girls like Jessica (Natasha
Lyonne).  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) decides that he should learn how to
return his girlfriend Vicky's (Tara Reid) favor.  And finally Finch (Eddie
Kaye Thomas) decides that the best way to go about getting laid is to pay
Heather (Mena Suvari) to sing his sexual praises.</P>
<P> Like all plans that virgins have to deprive themselves of their
predicament, they inevitably go awry.  As in any comedy of errors, the how
is the funny part, and thus I can't tell you.  What I can tell you, however,
is that the movie takes every crude joke it can get and then takes a few
intelligent ones.  For a good description, imagine There's Something about
Mary with a pastry and a flute.</P>
<P> The film isn't for virgins, because they won't at all respect the jokes in
there.  American Pie, although over the top, is remarkably true-to-life as
far as how we all grow up.  It brings back memories of those awkward talks
with Dad, those even more awkward moments of foreplay, the rumors, the
insanity, and the crazy desire to act cool while you fail utterly.  As far
as any guy or girl past highschool goes: we've been there before.</P>
<P> Despite the fact that our own personal demons may be more or less
frightening, and we may or may not want to revisit that bizarre quest to
psychosexual maturity, American Pie's ability to strike a common chord is
part of its great charm.  Because we've been there before, we can get all
the jokes, immediately relate to the characters (who represent all of the
high school sets from jock to nerd), and love the movie all the more.  The
kids that had snuck in or were going with their carded friends or boyfriends
didn't laugh nearly as much... or as hard... as everyone who was of age.</P>
<P> American Pie is this year's funniest sex comedy for sure and probably this
years funniest film period.  Crude, rude, and in the groove, it's not one to
miss.</P>
