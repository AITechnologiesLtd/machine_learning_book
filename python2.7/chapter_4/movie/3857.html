<PRE>                                   SMOKE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An amiable multi-story film about the
          acquaintances of a likable manager of a Brooklyn
          smoke shop.  Some of the goings-on are a little too
          convenient with the story-teller polishing the
          stories a little too much to be believable, but
          perhaps that is the point of the film.  SMOKE is a
          film that may be more subtle than most viewers
          realize.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to +4).  This review
          contains minor spoilers.</PRE>
<P>     All is not what it seems with SMOKE.  This is not a film that is
about the people who know Auggie Wren, though one could be fooled into
thinking that really was the subject of the film.  Really this is a
film about story-telling and what makes a good story.  Like SHORT CUTS,
SMOKE is a collection of short stories.  It has no main plot but rather
several subplots unfolding at the same time, mostly revolving around
the wise and worldly Auggie Wren, operator of the Brooklyn Cigar
Company, a small smoke shop.  Auggie runs into a broad cross-section of
humanity while running the shop and he is a natural-born story-teller.
One has the feeling, though the film never says it, that we are seeing
not reality but Auggie's enhanced versions of the stories.  Each story
seems a little too much like a polished Auggie story to be taken
literally.  Only as we get toward the end of the film do we get an
inkling about why that is and while it is open to interpretation, in my
opinion it is probably that we are one more level removed from the
characters than we are in most films.  Auggie is telling us these
stories in his own style.  And we might expect that sort of subtle
playfulness from a screenplay by Paul Auster, the author of the
enigmatic novel THE MUSIC OF CHANCE, recently adapted to film.  Auster
is also the author of "Auggie Wren's Christmas Story," which actually
appears in the film, though there it is written by the character Paul
Benjamin (a penname Auster has used).  So apparently Auster has written
himself into the story or perhaps he is just subtly playing with us
again.</P>
<P>     The film has a complex chain of simple stories.  Auggie (played
casually with open shirt by Harvey Keitel) has a favorite customer Paul
(William Hurt), a once-good writer who has not been able to get his
life together since the loss of his wife.  His life is saved by
troubled black teenager Rashid (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) who later sets
out to find his (Rashid's) missing father Cyrus (Forest Whitaker).
Meanwhile Auggie's ex-lover Ruby (Stockard Channing) shows up with
demands on Auggie.</P>
<P>     Auster has a hypnotic story telling style that makes the viewer
want to just go along for the ride, though after the fact the stories
seem more contrived than they originally seemed.  There are certain
symmetries in the stories, reminiscent of those that director Wayne
Wang had in his previous film THE JOY LUCK CLUB.  Certain plot elements
show up repeatedly in the stories.  Parent-child relationships seem to
show up in many different forms.  Stolen goods that end up going for a
good purpose is another repeated plot element.</P>
<P>     Adam Holender's camerawork manages to capture a certain charm to
the streets of what could have been a tense area of New York.  And
Wang's style combines with Auster's style and Rachel Portman's music to
make this a warm, if somewhat paradoxical film.  I give it a high +1 on
the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
