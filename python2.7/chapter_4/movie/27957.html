<P>   The great Scottish poet Robert Burns once said "The best
laid plans o'mice and men/Aft gang a-glee."  And don't we all
now that! In Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's debut film "Amores
Perros"--which joins "Crouching Tiger," "Divided We Fall,"
"Everybody Famous," and "The Taste of Others" in the Oscar
competition for Best Foreign Language Film--scripter
Guillermo Arriaga Jordan reminds us of an even more all-
embracing quote.  "If you want to make God laugh, tell Him
your plans."  Everybody in "Amores Perros" has A Big Plan. 
Everybody gets shafted.  But ah, there's some justice in the
failure of the humanity's plans in this case: each of the
aspirants violates one or more of the Ten Commandments
and each receives justice of biblical proportions.</P>
<P>   What's so great about Mexico's entry to the Oscar
competition aside from its grandiose ambition to illustrate a
divinely-inspired vengeance on its principals?  Aside from the
skillful acting of a cast largely unknown to a typical American
audience, "Amores Perros" keeps us on the edge of our
seats by its graphic but essential violence, the intensity of its
characters' drives, and not least by a battery of dogs of all
descriptions who are, sad to say, uncredited in the press
notes.  Dogs figure in virtually every sequence of this three-
part, "Traffic"-like story but this is no "Lassie Come Home"
nor are we about to see Toto in Kansas. In fact we are in the
world's most populous and perhaps most polluted metropolis,
Mexico City, which--judging by the way U.S. tourists seem to
be bypassing that capital in favor of Cancun, Acapulco and
Puerto Vallarta--is a dangerous place to be.</P>
<P>   One of Mexico's most notable performers, Emilio
Echevarria, figures in each of the three stories in the role of
El Chivo, but the real center of the action is not a goat but a
ferocious dog named Cofi.  In the first of three sequences,
Cofi is entered into a dog-fight competition, illegal in Mexico
though practiced in shady places by seedy characters for
fairly large stakes.  Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), an man of
about eighteen years of age, is in love with his sister-in-law
Susana (Vanessa Bauche), and is in need of some pesos to
carry out his plan to free her from her occasionally abusive
husband and elope with her to Juarez.  Entering his
Rottweiler into the ring, he succeeds in cashing in fifteen
straight times, but remember what the Bible says about
incest: his plans go awry when he perpetrates a godawful car
crash.  </P>
<P>   The second story deals with a middle-aged, middle-class
magazine publisher, Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero), who abandons
his wife to live with a smashing supermodel, Valeria (Goya
Toledo).  The car crash--this time shown through the
perspective of the model rather than of the perpetrator of the
collision--interrupts the plans of this box-office couple. 
Perhaps inspired by Bunuel's film "Tristana," director
Gonzalez Inarritu casts not one but two divine reprisals on
the unfortunate beauty who in one situation desperately tries
to save her little dog who has fallen through the apartment's
floorboards and is threatened by large rats.  (By contrasting
the glossy wooden floor with the unkempt life beneath,
Gonzalez Inarritu is obviously throwing us a metaphor for
surface glitter vs. inner rot.)</P>
<P>   The final episode finds El Chivo, now a homeless man with
a cartload of homeless pooches, wandering through the mean
streets of Mexico City.  Once a revolutionary who had
abandoned his family only to wind up spending twenty years
in jail for murder, he now earns money as a hit man who,
having realized an epiphany after witnessing the car crash,
manipulates both his customer and his customer's intended
victim to act out a story of sublime justice.</P>
<P>   "Amores Perros" faces tough competition particularly
against "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" (which Joel Siegel
pretentiously called "one of the finest films ever made), but
for its more earthy treatment of celestially-inspired repayment
for our sins deserves serious consideration by the Academy.</P>
