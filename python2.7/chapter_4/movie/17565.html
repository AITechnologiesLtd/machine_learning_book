Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS is the sort of film I generally greet with a
generous helping of pooh-poohing.  It's a remake (of a Neil Simon-penned
1970 original which I have never seen), it's a vehicle to re-unite two
stars of a previous film (Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, from 1992's
HOUSESITTER), and it's a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality.
THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS often feels like it's working awfully hard to extract
its guffaws, yet it still manages to extract its fair share.  The comic
energy of the three lead performers -- including the incomparable John
Cleese -- makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying.</P>
<P>     Martin and Hawn star as Henry and Nancy Clark, a Columbus, Ohio
couple facing a very empty nest.  With their youngest son finally moved
away, the Clarks are left alone to wonder whether there's any spark left
in their lives together.  A spark-igniter emerges unexpectedly when Henry
-- laid off from his advertising job but afraid to tell Nancy -- heads to
New York for a job interview with Nancy as a last-minute companion.  One
re-routed plane, mugging and eviction from a hotel by an officious manager
(Cleese) later, the Clarks find themselves hungry, homeless and stranded
in the Big Apple, sharing their grandest adventure ever.</P>
<P>     It shouldn't be a surprise that THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS feels derivative,
and not just because it's a remake.  Nearly every element in the film is
designed to have the comfort of the familiar, from the pairing of the two
stars, to Martin's fuming in a PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES scenario, to
Hawn's earnest ditziness, to Cleese's resurrection of Basil Fawlty and
Python-esque cross-dressing.  While the script by Marc Lawrence (writer of
FORCES OF NATURE, who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as
an aphrodisiac) pauses occasionally so Henry and Nancy can muse about the
nature of their marriage, it's mostly concerned with set-ups for slapstick
situations and tirades.</P>
<P>     At times, those situations and tirades feel forced; you can
practically see Hawn and Martin screaming to the audience for whoops and
applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets
their goat.  At plenty of others, the actors give the old-fashioned farce
a kick it rarely gets on screen.  Martin and Hawn share one classic
hide-in-the-bedroom scene with Kids in the Hall vet Mark McKinney (as a
businessman Nancy attempts to seduce for food), and their chemistry even
makes the personal moments feel somewhat genuine.  Even more wonderful is
Cleese, a comic treasure too rarely seen.  He may be able to do smiling
misanthropes like his character here in his sleep, but he still sends a
charge through THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS every moment he's on screen.  Cleese's
scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with
this film.</P>
<P>     I do wish THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS had shown more restraint with its
characters, subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less
abject humiliation.  It's not a subtle film by any stretch of the
imagination, but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that
we didn't need to see Martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants
around his ankles.  You may find a lot of THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS familiar and
foolish; you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself.
There's something to be said for the way talented professionals can take
predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 city shtickers:  6.</PRE>
