<PRE>Jackie Brown (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 83</PRE>
<P>Watching "Jackie Brown" for the second time, still
somewhat confused from its intricate plot of criminal
double crosses, I was reminded of "Get Shorty",
which had the same bewildering complexity.  It turns
out that both films were based on novels by Elmore Leonard,
with "Jackie Brown" an adaptation of "Rum Punch".
But "Get Shorty" was a much lighter film, while
"Jackie Brown" is more tense and violent.</P>
<P>"Jackie Brown", of course, is the third film fortunate
enough to have the talents of Quentin Tarantino
both as a director and screenwriter.  (We won't count
"Four Rooms", a.k.a. "Four Directors")  Elements present
in the first two films are here as well.  There is rampant
violence and obscenities, imaginative casting, scenes
taken out of chronological order, heavy doses of pop oldies
and outstanding dialogue.  While "Jackie Brown" may not
be as great as "Reservoir Dogs", it may actually be better
than the deservedly much-lauded "Pulp Fiction", and has
to be considered to be a nearly complete success.</P>
<P>The title character, an airline stewardess in her forties,
is played by Pam Grier.  She works with violent and
talkative arms merchant Samuel L. Jackson smuggling
currency into the country.  Jackson has several beachfront
properties, sharing them with girlfriends Bridget Fonda,
Lisa Gay Hamilton, and Hattie Winston.  (Fonda fans will
be glad to learn that her druggie "surfer girl" character
gets much screen time and shows much skin.) Robert DeNiro
shows up as Jackson's brooding assistant.</P>
<P>Grier is busted by cop Michael Bowen and ATF agent Michael
Keaton.  Grier, with her liberty, career and life at stake,
devises an elaborate scheme with lovestruck bailbondsman
Robert Forster.  Can she recover the illicit money,
and keep it from both the cops and revenge-minded Jackson?</P>
<P>The score is loaded with pop-soul oldies from the 1970s,
one of the best of which, "Long Time Woman" is performed
by Pam Grier herself.</P>
<P>Tarantino, despite casting African-Americans in the two
most important roles, came under criticism for the script's
heavy use of the n-word.  In my ever-ready opinion, this
word is in the same category for a screenplay as an expletive,
meaning that it can be readily abused but also can be
powerful in the proper context.  In Tarantino films,
expletives are typically used by violent and desperate
criminals, a context which seems appropriate.  I don't
believe that Tarantino's films promote violence either.
Like old gangster flicks starring James Cagney or
Edward G. Robinson, the proponents are unredeeming and
tend to meet death by their own measures.</P>
