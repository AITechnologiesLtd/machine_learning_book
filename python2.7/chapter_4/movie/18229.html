<PRE>A Few Thoughts On "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"
By Joe Gillis</PRE>
<P>Not since "Gone With The Wind" in 1939 has Hollywood (or America, or the world
for that matter) experienced the type of rabid anticipation surrounding a
single film as we've seen for the arrival of "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom
Menace."  In case you've spent the last couple of years in a cave in Tibet,
this is the long-awaited first chapter of the new trilogy that will serve as
prologue to the events depicted in the first three "Star Wars" films, the last
of which was released in 1983. Although the film's distributor, 20th Century
Fox, has yet to go into serious overdrive promoting the film, the film's fans
as well as the news media (and those holding licenses for toys and other
merchandise spawned by the film) have been on a feeding frenzy of late, and
every day closer to the official scheduled opening date (May 19) we get, that
frenzy will grow, possibly in mathematical proportion to the approach of the
premiere.</P>
<P>The problem with any film that is hyped so much in advance is that it the more
the hype, the better the film must be in order to satisfy the audience's
expectations. In recent weeks we've seen the release of the film's exciting
second trailer, the formation of photogenic lines of fans outside theaters in
New York and Los Angeles that will play the film, the release of the first of
the zillions of toys that will be bought and sold from now until our  Democracy
falls, and the appearance on TV talk shows and in magazines of none other than
George Lucas himself to personally promote the film. All of this and more has
been brought into our homes by the news media, who have decided that the
arrival of "The Phantom Menace" qualifies as a MAJOR NEWS EVENT (whether or not
it finds the same place in the history of our civilization as the
Clinton/Lewinsky scandal or the Littleton shootings remains to be seen).</P>
<P>Anyway, there are now some serious questions to be answered:</P>
<P>Is "The Phantom Menace" the best film ever made? Not quite. "Citizen Kane,"
"Casablanca," and "The Godfather" will not be shaken from their well-earned
places atop the pillars of American film.</P>
<P>Is "The Phantom Menace" the best science fiction film ever made? No. "2001: A
Space Odyssey," "Forbidden Planet," and "Blade Runner" are still comfortably
ahead in my book.</P>
<P>Is "The Phantom Menace" the best "Star Wars" film ever made? It is certainly
the most ambitious. George Lucas has attempted to do more in this film than in
its three predecessors combined, and although he doesn't pull it off perfectly,
he does succeed in an entertaining and exciting manner.</P>
<P>The plot (and if you want to see the film "cold," then I suggest that you skip
the rest of this paragraph) concerns a blockade of the planet Naboo by the
Galactic Trade Federation. As two agents of the Imperial Senate arrive in Naboo
orbit to negotiate with the Federation Viceroy, the Federation is receiving
orders from the Dark Lord, Darth Sidious, to invade the planet. The Imperial
agents are Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn, played by Liam Neeson, and his apprentice
Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Ewan MacGregor. Their negotiations end before they
have a chance to start, and the two Jedi sneak on board a Federation ship in
order to make it down to the planet;'s surface. Once there, they encounter the
Gungan, a race of cartoonish creatures, who help them to find Queen Amidala
(Natalie Portman), ruler of the planet's human species. The Jedi help her to
escape her planet so that she can make her way to the Imperial Senate on the
planet Coruscant, where she can plead her case against the Federation. On the
way, her ship (which was damaged in an attack and saved by the droid R2D2)
stops on the remote world of Tatooine, where Jinn meets the young Anakin
Skywalker, a streetwise slave boy who is a crack pilot and a whiz at building
machines (among them a protocol droid named C3PO). Immediately, he senses that
the Force is strong in Skywalker, and that he may be The Chosen One, who is
destined to bring balance to the Force. Jinn wins the boy's freedom in a wager
involving a pod race (a dizzying sequence that plays out like a 1990's version
of the chariot race from "Ben Hur"), and takes him to Coruscant, but not before
the Queen's party is attacked by Darth Maul, apprentice to Darth Sidious.
Maul's mission is to stop the Queen at any cost. As the Queen pleads her case
before the Imperial Senate (which is undergoing a loss of confidence in its
leadership), Jinn brings young Skywalker before the Jedi Council, and asks Yoda
and the other members to allow him to train the boy. The action eventually
moves back to Naboo where Lucas culminates the film with four simultaneous
battle sequences that leave one gasping for breath.</P>
<P>Above all else, this is a very entertaining film. It moves at a very quick pace
(although sometimes scenes end when you think that they're just getting
interesting), but be warned: some younger viewers may be bored or confused by
the political intrigues and infighting that are essential parts of the plot.
The kids will love the droids and creatures, and of course, the action. Nothing
here lowers itself to the kiddie level the way the Ewoks did in "Return of the
Jedi," and adults should have no reason to cringe.</P>
<P>Lucas and company present things we've never seen before (or even imagined,
such as a neverending variety of droids and creatures), plus a few surprises
(an old Jedi mind trick doesn't work the way we expect it to, and the joke here
is why it doesn't work). After giving us tantalizing hints in the first three
films of what a Jedi Knight is capable of, we get to see two fully trained Jedi
in action here, and they are truly fearless and fearsome warriors.</P>
<P>But the most exciting thing here is the underlying story, a tale of masters and
apprentices. Qui Gon and Obi-Wan, Darth Sidious and Darth Maul, Obi-Wan and
Anakin…we see the way that the torch is passed from generation to generation in
both good and evil. In addition, the people and events of the film are doubly
interesting because we see everything on two levels: what happens in front of
us and what future events (i.e. those of the first trilogy) they will
influence. We know where some of these characters will be fifty years after
what we see in this film, and we know how they will have changed. When Senator
Palpatine engineers changes in the Imperial Senate, we are grimly aware of
where that path will lead him. When he says that he intends to keep an eye on
young Skywalker, we laugh nervously, because we know that they will eventually
become master and apprentice on the Dark Side. And when Anakin is told "You
bring hope to those who have none," by his mother, whose freedom from slavery
can't be won in a wager, it breaks our hearts, because we know that hope won't
be his to bring. That destiny will lie with his son.</P>
<P>Technically, the film is awesome. The computer generated characters and
locations (including the beautiful palaces of Naboo and the "Metropolis"-style
cities of the planet Coruscant) are truly state of the art, and the sound
(especially in the battle scenes) will shake you in your seat. If possible,
catch this film in a THX certified theater.</P>
