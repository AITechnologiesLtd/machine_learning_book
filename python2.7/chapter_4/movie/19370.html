<P>The new Austin Powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the
eighties.   Produce something, anything, that will get the high school and
junior high kids in the theater because they
buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens.  The usual hallmarks of this
filmmaking tradition are all here.  Gross humor, sex jokes, silly sight
gags, more sex jokes.   And the film is a strong contender in the current
race to be cruder, grosser and more outrageous than that last film.    What
the film is not, however, is funny.</P>
<P>The plot centers around the return of Dr.Evil, who goes back in time
to steal Austin Powers' mojo (a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from
Austin's pelvis) which gives Austin his
sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies.
Austin must go after him, and returns to the swinging sixties
where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday.</P>
<P>I almost avoided this film because I did not like the original.   But
the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film
received many good reviews.  I wish I had stuck to my first impression.</P>
<P>Myers is trying to be the Jerry Lewis of this generation.   And he
has the talent to do it, at least as an actor.  But the material he is
working with here, much of it his own, falls short of anything resembling
comic genius.  This movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about
drinking distilled feces, a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack, and a
barrage of sex jokes
aimed at the level of the average 15 year old.  After some of these scenes,
one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to
get an audiences attention.</P>
<P>The direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic
humor.  For the most part, I felt as if I was watching a Saturday morning
chalderns live action TV show.   There is no sense of comic timing or
subtlety.  The director just throws the material at us, giving us nothing
except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director.</P>
<P>I am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd, at
least the one's who have yet to discover literacy.  Certainly the movie is
directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in
your face,  kick you in the teeth, take no prisoners, (action-verb +blah
blah blah).'
   If you see the film and you find you're not laughing, there is nothing
wrong with you.  It just means you grew up since seventh grade.</P>
