<PRE>GOSSIP</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Davis Guggenheim
Written by: Gregory Poirier</PRE>
<P>What happens when a writer has an interesting idea for a film, but is so
thrilled by his idea that he apparently forgets to write a script to go
along with it? It would seem we get a movie like Gregory Poirier's
("Rosewood") "Gossip". This is a movie which sounds vaguely interesting at
first, only to start off poorly and grow worse and worse from there. While
this is mostly Poirier's fault for writing such a pathetic script (assuming
he bothered to write one at all), part of the blame can also land firmly on
Davis Guggenheim's (NYPD Blue) shoulders for not bothering to direct. The
movie simply flounders about, attempting to be hip, profound, and chilling
all at the same time. Instead, however, it comes off as confusing,
disjointed, and shallow.</P>
<P>Derrick (James Marsden), Cathy (Lena Heady), and Travis (Norman Reedus) are
roomates taking a class on communications. Their current topic is gossip and
the ways in which a rumor can grow and change, till the rumor is more
readily believed than the truth. The trio decide to start a rumor and track
its growth for a class paper. Derrick happens to catch two students, Naomi
(Kate Hudson) and Beau (Joshua Jackson), making out at a party. Naomi passes
out drunk and Beau leaves, but Derrick starts the rumor that the two
actually made love. Soon the rumor grows and grows to the point where Beau
is accused of rape, Naomi is being called the campus slut, and there seems
to be no way of stopping the rumor. The interesting thing is that Derrick
seems to have no desire to stop his lie, no matter what damage it may be
causing.</P>
<P>I am one of those people who has the ability to suspend my disbelief quite a
bit. For example, earlier this week I watched and enjoyed "U-571", despite
the fact that it was more than a little implausible. "Gossip", on the other
hand, is so ridiculously implausible that it pushed my suspension of
disbelief to the limits, and then it finally snapped. While things may start
off somewhat hard to believe, it's easy to forgive. By the film's ending,
however, things were so insanely outlandish that the few people in the
theater were actually laughing at the movie's serious moments. A good
example of one of the more ridiculous scenes would be one in which Derrick
claims Travis is the son of Mick Jagger to a bar tender. The jaded
bartender, who has no doubt heard it all, leaps at the idea and gives
Derrick, Travis, and Cathy drinks on the house.</P>
<P>The very young cast at work in this movie is, unfortunately, rather
talentless. This is made even worse by Guggenheim's apparent lack of ability
as a director. James Marsden's ("Disturbing Behavior") acting style seems to
consist of him grinning a lot, while trying to make his lines sound serious.
Lena Heady ("Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book") does nothing but pout a
lot, which I suppose is more Poirier's fault than her own. Joshua Jackson
("The Skulls") is a talented actor in desperate need of a new agent. His
part in "Gossip" is little more than a cameo in most respects. Lastly, we
have Norman Reedus ("8MM"), who somehow manages to breathe some semblance of
life into his part as a slightly disturbed, shy art student who creates a
rather interesting wall mural about the events unfolding around him.</P>
<P>Allow me to name a few more irritating aspects of "Gossip". The camera work
is quite obnoxious, jumping all over the place even while two people are
merely sitting and talking. The soundtrack is nothing more than a mix of
modern, popular songs used at all the wrong moments. Then we have the so
called "twists" sprinkled throughout the movie. The twists are always either
ridiculous and implausible, or so obvious they can hardly be called twists.
I wish I could say there was more to like here than simply the basic plot
ideas, but there really isn't. I can't honestly recommend "Gossip" to
anyone, and if you think the previews look interesting, I would still advise
you to catch a matinee or wait for video (given the poor attendance at the
showing I witnessed, it shouldn't take long for this one to hit video).
"Gossip" runs only 90 minutes, but it feels quite a bit longer. I give it
two out of five stars.</P>
