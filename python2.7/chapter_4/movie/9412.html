<P>"I Know What You Did Last Summer" is just the kind of horror movie
that last December's hit slasher satire "Scream" poked fun at. It's an
ironic connection, seeing as how screenwriter-of-the-moment Kevin
Williamson penned both of them, adapting the former from Lois Duncan's
popular young adult novel and creating the latter from scratch. But
while "Summer" boasts a much more solemn tone than "Scream" (and bears
more flaws), it certainly proves Williamson's staying power -- simply
put that whether the guy's milking or laughing at the genre, he's
quite solid at doing it.</P>
<P>The movie tells the story of four friends -- there's prim, sensible
Julie ("Party of Five"'s Jennifer Love Hewitt), beauty queen Helen
(Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), boozy jock
Barry ("White Squall"'s Ryan Phillippe) and low-key outcast Ray
(Freddie Prinze, Jr. of "The House of Yes"). The summer before the
quartet of friends venture off to college to pursue their respective
dreams, they're out celebrating the July 4th holiday on the
beach. Barry becomes too intoxicated to drive his new BMW back to
their Southport, North Carolina fishing village hometown, so Ray takes
over for him. But along the way, Barry's drunken rantings distract the
rest of the party, and they accidentally hit a passer-by while quickly
cruising up a windy mountain road. Their semi-reluctant decision to
dump the body off a nearby pier leads to an impulsive crime of passion
of which the less divulged, the more terrifying the sequence is.</P>
<P>Fast forward a year later and the gang are all husks of their former
promising selves, driven to personal failure by remorse. As if 12
months of guilt weren't enough, it also appears that someone knows
their secret after Julie receives an ominous note bearing the titular
sentence and the group begins being stalked by a psycho clad in
Gorton's Fisherman getup -- a rain slicker and hat that mask his
identity. Is it the creepy class nerd (Johnny Galecki) who possibly
witnessed the initial mishap? The victim's backwoods sister (very good
Anne Heche)? One of the four overcome with grief? Or someone different
altogether?</P>
<P>"I Know What You Did Last Summer" generates a strong undercurrent of
tension from this setup, but its problem area is its anti-climactic
boat chase finale. After doing so well on so many levels, it turns
into a "Scooby-Doo" episode without the hippie and the talking dog --
once unmasked, you half expect the killer to cry, "And I would have
gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids!" The
actual identity of the villain and how it is revealed is another flaw
-- a character who's remained an enigma for 85 minutes starts rattling
off one-liners ("Welcome aboard!") like he's Bruce Willis or
something. And the movie's concluding scene is illogical; it seems
tacked-on to generate one last scare, but only in that sense does it
succeed.</P>
<P>It's a sad send-off, because there's much to appreciate about the
build-up. Williamson's strong point is in creating interesting
protagonists, even if these kids aren't as educated in slasher cinema
as the "Scream" gang. The four leads have charisma to spare,
especially Prinze as the loner whose actions cast most of the
suspicion his way. Hewitt, who is probably supposed to be the main
character (she gets the most screen time), has an appealing, low-key
presence, even though I found myself wishing she'd do something with
her hair. All of them holler with gusto, and maybe that's what matters
most. Williamson is also inventive with death scenes; when the
Fisherman meat hooks one person in the jugular and yanks them across a
stove that's boiling crabs, you'll never look at seafood in quite the
same way again.</P>
<P>The movie looks beautifully downbeat, shot in somber hues of blue and
gray that fast establish a notably grim tone. I don't know if horror
flicks are Oscar fodder, but it'd be nice if director of photography
Denis Crossan got a nod. Then again, all of the technical credits are
first-rate -- production-wise, this movie excels. "I Know What You Did
Last Summer"'s undoings restrain it from attaining the level of
"Scream," but, that icky conclusion aside, it's still pretty much a
scream.</P>
