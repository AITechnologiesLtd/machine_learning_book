<PRE>Nothing To Lose (1997)

A movie review by Serdar Yegulalp

<P>CAPSULE: What a surprise: a big-name Hollywood comedy that's actually funny.
Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence both score points (although Robbins comes
out slightly ahead).</P>
<P>The opening scenes of NOTHING TO LOSE hit me like a left hook when I was
expecting a body blow. Tim Robbins, playing a corporate hustler named Nick
Beam, is in bed with his wife, murmuring in a dead, empty voice about how
the love is gone. Then we get a surprise -- several, actually -- that had
both me and the rest of the audience falling out of our seats. This sets us
up on several levels: not only is Robbins a good actor, but so is the Beam
character.</P>
<P>Nick works for an advertising company which fills his hours, but he still
manages to find time for his wife. One afternoon, he gets out of a whole
slew of corporate obligations and comes home early... to find his wife and
his boss in bed together. He wanders downstairs, dazed, and then does what
no man in a blue funk should ever do: get in his car.</P>
<P>His aimless driving leads him to a carjacking, courtesy of a fellow named T.
Paul (Martin Lawrence), who senses Mr. Whitebread ain't firing on all
thrusters when he doesn't even look at the gun pointing at his temple. "Boy,
did you ever pick the wrong guy on the wrong day," Beam mutters with a
deadly little smile, and floors it.</P>
<P>One scarifying ride later, the two of them take stock in a diner far outside
the city. They don't like each other, but they're forced to rely on each
other when the Land Rover runs out of gas and Paul sticks up a gas station
to fill it up. Bit by bit, Beam's story comes out... along with a bizarre
plan to get revenge on his boss by robbing him blind.</P>
<P>The movie's a pastiche of recent comedy cliches, and there's no point in
ignoring it. What's different is that the movie is funny. Most comedies that
try to play this kind of mix-and-match don't work; they strike the wrong
notes, or make the heroes into idiots. Both Beam and Paul know what's what,
which makes them interesting to watch: you wonder what they're going to do
next. In one scene, they rob a sporting-goods store, and what could have
been a routine stick-em-up turns into a heated competition over who had the
more intimidating stickup style.</P>
<P>Martin Lawrence is an odd duck. I can't figure out if I like him or hate
him, but I liked him in this movie: he does things with his voice and face
that shouldn't be physically possible, which is half the reason for the
laughs he gets. The other half is his timing and attitude: pay attention to
the scene where he dresses down Beam for not having a tighter grip on his
wife (and Beam's reaction, too). Or the scene where he tries to tell Beam
he's in danger, and gets shrugged off.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the cliches win in NOTHING TO LOSE, but that doesn't mean the
ride isn't enjoyable. My basic rule of thumb for comedy is: Did I laugh?
Yeah -- a lot more than I probably should have, but I can't say that about
most movies. And the scene with the security guard Goth-dancing in the laser
vault has to be seen to be believed.</P>
