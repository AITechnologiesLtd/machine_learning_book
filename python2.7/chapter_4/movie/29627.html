<PRE>                       MONSOON WEDDING
               A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: The Verma family is having a wedding and all the 
    relatives will come for the multi-day festivities.  Mira 
    Nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama, a 
    few family secrets, some sadness and some happiness.  You 
    have seen it all before, but perhaps not from India.  The 
    photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable.  
    Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>Mira Nair previously directed SALAAM BOMBAY and MISSISSIPPI 
MASALA.  Her newest film, written by Sabrina Dhawan, is very 
similar to previous films like BETSY'S WEDDING but it is set in 
New Delhi.  A wealthy family is having a wedding.  An Indian 
wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a 
nuptial.  Even more than in the US, it is an excuse for a lavish 
and extravagant family get-together.  The film shows us what the 
family does together and at the same time follows several family 
members' individual story lines.  Aditi Verma is marrying Hemant, 
an Indian engineer working in the US.  She had previously had a 
relationship with Vikram, her supervisor.  Latit, her father 
(played by Naseeruddin Shah), is juggling many problems, not the 
least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired PK Dubey.  
Dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the 
marigolds he uses for decoration.  Even Dubey will soon be 
romantically entangled when he becomes interested in Alice, one of 
the family servants.  Several family members arrive giving rise to 
several plotlines involving sex, family secrets, or both.  There 
are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love.  Some of the 
subjects covered are probably near taboo for Indian films.</P>
<P>Western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar Indian 
customs like women painting their hands with henna.  On the other 
hand it was not clear (to me at least) if scenes like the family 
singing together are typical of Indian culture or if they are a 
convention of Indian musical films.  This seems a particularly 
Westernized family with the father wearing American designer 
sweaters and the family speaking mostly English.  The latter will, 
however, help with an international release.</P>
<P>Sabrina Dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog.  We have 
seen films with plotting very much like this, but the Indian 
setting makes a great deal of difference.  Director Mira Nair 
calls the film an affirmation of life.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 
10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
