<P>   Here's why we need lots and lots of critics.  One guy says
this about "Eye of the Beholder"..."As it slithers under the
skin and behind the brain, 'Eye of the Beholder' works a
brand of guileful magic rarely seen in movies
today--courageously blurring the line between its characters'
inner conflicts and outer lives to create a disturbingly hypnotic
odyssey not unlike Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' or Brian
De Palma's 'Obsession.'"  Another fellow says this: "I was
absolutely dumbfounded.  I thought this movie was totally
incomprehensible, and the ending seemed arbitrary and
pointless.  It's shocking how poorly pieced together it is." 
Other reviews have come through in various shades between
these two extremes.  </P>
<P>   The diversity of opinion could be explained as a conflict
between those who want a story to be clear almost from the
start and those who prefer movies to be more challenging. 
Granted: "Eye of the Beholder," based on Marc Behm's 1980
noir novel, is the sort of tale that starts off in a manner so
baffling that you'd be tempted to wonder whether two or three
movies were spliced together.  In fact, if you go into this film
realizing that its director, Stephan Elliot, is known principally
for two far-out comedies, "Welcome to Woop Woop" and
"Priscilla: Queen of the Desert," you can't be blamed for
concluding that the man is putting one over on us.</P>
<P>   Ah but wait.  As we get into the story, the truth begins to
unfold.  "Eye of the Beholder" is a psychological thriller not
unlike Brian De Palma's most intriguing creation,
"Obsession," which is itself a rehash of Alfred Hitchcock's
"Vertigo" (with elements of "Rear Window").  This time the
Cliff Robertson role is taken by the strikingly handsome Ewan
McGregor, who exhibits the same personal traits as did
Robertson's character, with a fine side role by Genevieve
Bujold--who was the object of the man's obsession in the De
Palma movie but now takes on the role of an ultra-liberal,
bleeding-heart parole officer.</P>
<P>   McGregor performs in the role of The Eye, a surveillance
man with the British Secret Service who has been assigned
to spy on the son of his employer and who communicates
regularly by modem with a sharply cynical woman named
Hilary (k.d. lang).  A loner, depressed since his wife walked
out on him eight years earlier taking their daughter with her,
The Eye has lost it.  He's still good at his job, still maintaining
the preoccupation with work that led to the breakup of his
family.  That he frequently hallucinates his daughter's
presence--skipping rope, making noise, asking questions,
getting in the way of his spying--does not greatly interfere
with his tasks.  But when he inadvertently witnesses the cold-
blooded murder of a man in the midst of a tryst with the
beautiful Joanna (Ashley Judd), he becomes strangely
captivated by the killer and determined to protect her at all
costs.  Stalking Joanna in New York, Boston, Chicago, San
Francisco and even Alaska, he seems to recognize that
despite her affinity for serial killing, the two are somehow
made for each other.  And in a way--considering how both of
these tormented individuals went nuts for similar reasons--
they are.  Writer/director Elliot appears to invite us to
consider why we each choose the person we do, suggesting
that some extrasensory insight makes us see into our
partner's deepest recesses.  It's no wonder that much of the
conversation between Joanna and her unlucky male friends
turns upon astrology and numerology.</P>
<P>   Rarely has anyone in the cinema so successfully stalked
another through so many cities--The Eye's accomplishment
particularly odd considering the bright red jacket he wears
and the smashing good looks that he displays.  McGregor
turns in a performance that is exceptional for the very reason
that he is able to hide his outer feelings from the audience so
well.  He is a tabula rasa, a poker-faced isolate who lives
almost entirely within his own mind, dedicating himself to the
protection of this criminally insane woman even at the cost of
his own job.  Ashley Judd looks equally smashing through
most of her disguises, not so hot when she wears a page-boy
wig but devastating in a succession of long-hair rugs, both
blond and brunette, which she acquires with the money she
lifts from her victims. Judd and McGregor are rarely together
on screen, giving their one extended dialogue a climactic
impact.</P>
<P>  If Cliff Robertson and Genevieve's Bujold's connection in
"Obsession" never left your mind--and you prayed for a
chance to see a rekindling of the subject with equally
matched performers--"Eye of the Beholder" is the movie
you're looking for. This one might turn off the MTV generation
eager for a succession of slam-bang episodes, but will fulfill
the hopes of those who believe that vigorous inner action is
of more dramatic note than plot-driven, exterior movement.</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running Time: 102 minutes.  (C) 2000
