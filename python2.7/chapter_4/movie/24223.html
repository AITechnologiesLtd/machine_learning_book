<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>KEEPING THE FAITH [Norton] -- Nothing more than passable fluff, really,
which I guess ain't bad, but I do prefer characters that I can truly
sympathize-slash-empathize with and I suppose Norton had it toughest:
the majority of the movie going public isn't exactly made up of Catholic
priests. Thankfully, first-time director/actors tend to be especially
critical of their performances; thus, his character, who bothered me
quite a bit until reel three, is absent from the majority of the
romantic proceedings. The subject-matter doesn't lend itself to any
particular visual style (other than the typical prose of Nora Ephron,
who is thanked in the end credits), so we, as an audience, are left
wondering if Nortion can really direct. But then, there's that whole
other mystery entirely: Who ever would've envisioned *Edward Norton* as
director of a romantic-comedy? By the way, Ben Stiller is a genius. C+</P>
