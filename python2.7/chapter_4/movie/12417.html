<P>It's summer again. It's only obvious in that this is the time of year
when the studios pull out their big, effects laden productions and
attempt to coerce every young adult and teenager into a movie theater
for two hours of escapism. What's the big deal? Well, with the film
'Deep Impact' we have a combination effort, something that is at once a
big splashy effects picture and an emotional human drama. Unfortunately,
for those under the age of 17. The film deals with issues and ideas that
most young people could not concern themselves with.</P>
<P>On a dark night, a group of high school students are gathered on a
hillside stargazing for a science project. Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood)
spots something out of the ordinary and nonchalantly decides to send
along the information to Astrology researcher, Professor Wolf (Bob
Balaban). That information is identified as a comet, the size of New
York City (7 miles) which is on a collision course with Earth.</P>
<P>Continuing the story, Lenny Lerner (Tia Leoni), a struggling field
reporter for the MS/NBC cable news network; is chasing after a story
about the possible infidelities of Press Secretary Alan Rittenhouse
(James Cromwell). Lenny has received information through various sources
in Washington leading her to believe that the Press Secretary is having
an affair with a woman named Eli. Confronting Mr. Rittenhouse at his
boat (where he seems to be stockpiling supplies), Lenny questions him
about his affair. The confrontation leads Lenny to believe that she is
on the right track. It is at that moment that she is detained by the
secret service. She is taken to the White House, where she is question
as to what she knows of Eli. Realizing that she may be misunderstanding
the situation, Lenny researches the name Eli. She finally discovers that
it is an anagram for "Extinction Level Impact".</P>
<P>As stated at the top of this article, 'Deep Impact' is a unique film for
this time of year. Usually, films of this nature carry very little
weight story-wise. These films are usually high concept projects with
quick payoffs and predictable situations ('Daylight', 'Independence
Day', 'Volcano', etc.). While these films are entertaining in their own
right, you don't really expect anything in the way of depth from them.
This is what makes 'Deep Impact' so compelling and so disappointing. The
film takes time to develop its situation and it's characters. There is
an honest attempt at character depth here that is refreshing.
Nevertheless, at the same time, there is not enough. This film would
work better if it had an extra 30 minutes tagged onto it. Enough to give
us a chance to get to know all of these diverse individuals.</P>
<P>The performances in the film are nothing special, although Tia Leoni
deserves recognition for her fine turn as Reporter Lenny Lerner. She
gives us a solid view of a woman isolated from human contact and
consumed by her career until disaster strikes. Her drive and hard work
are rewarded, to the point of survival. The choices Lenny makes give the
character a marvelous arc and makes her the most believable portrayal in
the film.</P>
<P>Robert Duvall is always a joy to watch. His, Spurgeon Tanner, a retired
NASA astronaut and last man to walk on the moon, is a man who has
nothing else to live for. His wife has passed away; his sons are
essentially estranged from him. Tanner has only one thing left in his
life and that is his accomplishments. Taking the mission to attempt to
save the Earth, is a call to arms. A military man all of his life,
Tanner will risk his life to perform his duty. Moreover, he does it as a
testament to his wife.</P>
<P>The other performances in the film are all acceptable in their
individual performances. Maximilian Schell as Lenny's father Jason
Lerner, probably fairs worse in the film, as we are never really given a
chance to know the character. Morgan Freeman makes the most believable
On-Screen President since Ralph Bellamy in 'Sunrise at Capbobello'.
Vanessa Redgrave has a marvelous turn as Robin Lerner, recently divorced
and alone. Her portrayal of a woman unable to cope with her loneliness
is both pitiful and painful. The surprise performance of the film is
newcomer Leelee Sobieski as Sarah Hotchner. Her naturalness and depth of
emotion belay her mere 15 years of life. This is a young talent to
watch. While some have unflatteringly referred to her as Helen Hunt Jr.
(due to a slight resemblance), it's would be a shame if her ability was
neglected simply due to her physical traits.</P>
<P>The screenplay by noted writers Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin is
one of the most intelligent in recent years. Events are not telegraphed
as much as they are inevitable. There are serious attempts here to raise
the level of believability in the script. Logic prevails in all of the
situations. There are no heroic moments without cost. There is no
sacrifice without pain. No salvation without loss. This is the
antithesis of action films, and it is a welcome relief.</P>
<P>Mimi Leder handles the film well enough. There are moments, that have a
television drama look to them, little flourishes that almost get in the
way of the drama. This is not problematic, just distracting. Ms. Leder
shows real talent in handling her actors. Every performance is keyed to
a fine note.</P>
<P>This brings up the disappointing part of the whole enterprise. Also,
with so many characters and sub plots, the film has the same disjointed
feel of every other dissater epic. There are also moments when knowing
asides are used as comic relief. This has the effect of diminishing the
drama. While a little humor would be acceptable, lines such as "Don't
worry so much, it's not the end of the world." are just too noticeable.
In addition, some of the emotional grandstanding towards the climax of
the film rings false. It's just a little too maudlin for it's own good.
This also brings up the Lenny's final acceptance of her fate. It's
developed so quickly that it doesn't ring true.</P>
<P>'Deep Impact' is a fine film, and one that may linger in memory longer
that one would expect. There are moments, which are emotionally
powerful. Moreover, there are political ideas brought to fore that are
uncomfortable. It's flaws, while not as cumbersome as other films, are
still distracting.
On a scale from * to *****, 'Deep Impact' rates ***=.</P>
