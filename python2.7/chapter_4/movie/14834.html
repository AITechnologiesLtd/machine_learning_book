SLAM
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"Welcome to the DC jail," the tough guard barks matter-of-factly to the
new inmate.  "You might make it out of here, and you might not."  He
then rattles off, drill sergeant fashion, the depressing statistics for
the percentages of African-American adult males in our nation's capitol
who are incarcerated.  Challenging the newest prisoner to "do the math,"
he paints a picture that is not encouraging.</P>
<P>Ray Joshua, a "performance poet" in his first acting role, plays Saul
Williams the charismatic protagonist of SLAM.  SLAM was a major award
winner at this year's Sundance and Cannes film festivals.</P>
<P>Ray has the bad luck to be at the scene of a shooting, where the police
catch him with a half-pound of marijuana on him.  Ray is a gentle soul
whose passion is his poetry, which he does rapid fire, rap style but
without music.  Williams wrote the pieces he performs.  ("You massage
the universe's spine as you twirl through time," starts one of his
typical poems.)</P>
<P>(A "slam" is a form of competitive poetry that is practiced throughout
the country.  A fascinating woman known as the "Slam Granny," who was at
our press screening, explained the basic ideas and the rules to me.  The
movie would have been much better if the slams were more prevalent in
it.)</P>
<P>Although director Marc Levin gets the poetry part right, probably
because his background is in documentaries, the rest of the movie is
pretty thin.  The jail fight sequences, for example, are amateurishly
choreographed.  There is also a pseudo-sappy romantic subplot with the
jail's poetry teacher (Sonja Sohn).   Her funds are cut off by the
government, which she claims no longer cares about rehabilitation.</P>
<P>Ray's salvation is his art.  When up against a sea of buff bodies in the
prison's exercise yard, he bursts out in poetry.  The men, with their
rippling muscles bordering on explosion, don't know what to make of
someone like Ray.</P>
<P>At the prison poetry group, in which one of the cons reads a poem about
his killing 3 people when he was only 15, Ray seems at home.
Eventually, Ray will perform at a slam, and there he finally really
comes into his own, as his poetry flies out of his mouth with great
intensity and power.</P>
<P>The big question for Ray is will he "cop a plea" as his court appointed
lawyer recommends or will he fight it out in court.  His odds in a court
of law are miserable, his lawyer tells him with all the gravity he can
muster.  The movie wisely provides no easy answers for Ray.</P>
<P>SLAM runs 1:40.  It is rated R for profanity, sex, violence, and drugs
and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
