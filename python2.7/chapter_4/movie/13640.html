<PRE>Lolita (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>After seeing Adrian Lyne's much-talked-about screen version of Vladimir
Nabokov's _Lolita_, I can easily see why it's taken the better part of two
years for the film to find an American distributor--but it's not for the
reasons you might think.  Lyne's take on the classic tale of pedophilic
lust is just about the opposite of what one would expect from the director
of bankable, tawdry zeitgeist-tappers _Fatal_Attraction_ and
_Indecent_Proposal_.  It is nicely composed, careful, tasteful... to the
point of frigidity.  For all the taboos it covers, _Lolita_ is strangely
staid and uninvolving piece of work, a film whose only commercial prospects
with in the manufactured controversy surrounding it.</P>
<P>Unlike Stanley Kubrick's blackly comic 1962 version of Nabokov's novel,
Lyne and screenwriter Stephen Schiff take a stately approach to the
controversial story.  This works for the general setup, especially the
elegant prologue, in which the sexual proclivities of professor Humbert
Humbert (Jeremy Irons) are explained: when he was 14, he was deeply in love
with a same-aged girl who eventually fell ill and died; ever since, he has
lusted over nyphets.  Flash forward to 1947, and Humbert finds his ultimate
object of desire in Dolores Haze, a.k.a. Lolita (Dominique Swain), the
feisty 14-year-old daughter of Charlotte (Melanie Griffith, her shrillness
working for once), the widow in whose home he rents a room.  To remain
close to Lolita, Humbert impulsively marries Charlotte, which sets off a
chain of events that leads to Humbert taking stepdaughter Lolita, now his
very willing lover, on wild road trip across America.</P>
<P>Once _Lolita_ hits the road, Lyne's glacial style keeps the audience at a
distance and saps just about all the energy from the film.  The film soon
settles into a cyclic stop-and-go rhythm where Lolita's naturally childish
behavior incenses Humbert, he pines for her, she uses it to her advantage
and gets him back, only to anger him again.  Lyne is understandably
discreet with the sexual encounters between Humbert and Lolita, and his
adherence to taste is admirable.   However, the most effective moments in
_Lolita_ are those where Lyne doesn't play it safe and dares to unsettle
the audience, which is what he's built his entire career on.  Particularly
effective is a disturbing scene where a mad--with lust, and in the literal
sense--Humbert tries to fuck a confession out of a hysterically laughing,
lipstick-smeared Lolita.  It's a creepy scene, one bound to get under
moviegoers' skin.  But it's likely the only one that will elicit any type
of emotional reaction from the audience--not even the inevitable tragic
conclusion packs much of a punch, if any.</P>
<P>What makes  _Lolita_ all the more disappointing is that it is clearly less
than the sum of its parts, which all-too vividly display signs of life the
entire film the could have had.  Irons gives a beautifully nuanced
performance; while the audience is repulsed by his actions, one cannot help
but have some understanding for what he feels and why.  The
then-15-year-old Swain, who went on to co-star as John Travolta's
Lolita-ish daughter in _Face/Off_, more than holds her own, playing Lolita
as equal parts victim and vixen.  Ennio Morricone's score is hauntingly
sensual, as is the soft lensing of cinematographer Howard Atherton.  It's
unfortunate that their superlative work is in the service of a mediocre
vehicle.</P>
<P>With films such as _Fatal_, _Indecent_, and _9_1/2_ Weeks_ under his belt,
Lyne seems to pride himself on making provocative films about sexuality.
_Lolita_ should have been the most provocative of them all; all the
individual ingredients were in place for a thoughtful, daring, yet
nonexploitative work.  Alas, his _Lolita_, with its distant earnestness and
leisurely pace, might as well have been a Merchant Ivory production.  (airs
August 2 on Showtime; "officially" opens in theatres September 25)</P>
