<PRE>The Big Lebowski
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an
outsider. When those observers are Joel and Ethan Coen, the surreal becomes
bizarre. When the life is that of Jeff "The Dude" Leboswki, the bizarre falls
over the edge into the world of "What'sgoingonaroundhere".</P>
<P>The marvelous sound of  "The Stranger" (Sam Elliot)'s voice-over introduces
the film. At least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives
up.  The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is described as the "laziest man in Los Angeles,
possibly the world", although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed. </P>
<P>Spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a White Russian
in the other, he doesn't have much of a life, but he's having a good time.
When asked what he does for fun, he responds "bowl, drive around and the
occasional acid flashback".</P>
<P>Lebowski's passion is bowling. When he's not rolling the ball down an alley
towards a strike, things just happen to him. Arriving home one night, he's
beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them. Even
worse, they urinate on his rug. The problem is that The Dude doesn't have a
wife. His assailants realize that their target is a different Lebowski when
they glance around at his apartment. The "Big" Lebowski (David Huddleston) is
a multi-millionaire and his Dudeness lives in two-room squalor.</P>
<P>The next day, our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting
compensation for his soaked rug. The carpet is important to him because it
pulls the room together: not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object
there. When he's denied any money, he picks up a replacement rug off the
floor. On his way out, he runs into Lebowski's trophy babe wife Bunny (Tara
Reid) who offers to perform a sexual act that, according to rumor, is one of
Bill Clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks. The penniless Dude wisecracks
that he's heading for the cash machine.</P>
<P>Later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man
to deliver a ransom to Bunny's kidnappers. This begins the trademarked Coen
brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences. The kidnappers are impossibly inept. The
Dude and his cronies are even worse. Every plan goes awry. You can almost see
Lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues.</P>
<P>That's the story, but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter. There could be
almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining. The narrative only
exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they
fall into. The Dude's bowling buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve
Buscemi) look like people you'd see on the street but, like everything else in
this film, they're not quite what they seem.</P>
<P>Walter is a vet as stuck in Vietnam as The Dude is in the sixties. Everything
that happens reminds him of a situation in the Nam. When a fellow bowler
crosses the foul line but won't admit it, Walter pulls a gun on him until he
marks a zero on the score sheet. Donny gets precious few words in between
Walter's screaming and The Dude's rambling. When he does, Walter shouts him
down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns. Donny is
"out of his league" and doesn't "have a frame of reference".</P>
<P>The film is peppered with people for whom the term "character" would be an
understatement. The Big Lebowski's daughter Maude, an avant-garde "vaginal"
artist, paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an S&M Mary
Martin. The kidnappers are German  techno nihilist bikers. Bunny Lebowski is a
high school cheerleader turned porno star.</P>
<P>Most impressive is John Turturro in his far too small role as a Hispanic
bowler. As the flamenco music swells, we see him putting on his lavender hose.
The camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "Jesus"
(pronounced with a "J", not an "H") embroidered on the pocket. He addresses
the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail. His tongue
slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball.</P>
<P>Bridges works The Dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he
has. I can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job. Buscemi
has a limited role, but he plays it perfectly. The more that I see John
Goodman the more convinced I am that he's one of the treasures of our time.
It's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as Roseanne Barr's
television husband.</P>
<P>More like the Coen's "Raising Arizona" than their hit "Fargo", "The Big
Lebowski" demands an open mind and even more open eyes. A mark of the Coen
brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad
slapstick physical comedy on the screen, much of the humor is subtle and easy
to miss. There's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can
see it.</P>
<P>Walking out of the theater, I felt that the film had something important to
say. On further examination, I wasn't sure exactly what it was. "If you meet
Jesus at the bowling alley, it's not going to be what you expect"? "When the
going gets weird, the weird go bowling"? Maybe there's no real message.
Perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world. Maybe
that's enough.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he
was so taken with The Dude that he ran out of space to talk about "The Man In
The Iron Mask" starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages.
