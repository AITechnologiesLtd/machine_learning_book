<PRE>                               FIERCE CREATURES
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>A comedy starring John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and
Jamie Lee Curtis</P>
<PRE>A UNIVERSAL PICTURE</PRE>
<P>First, let me say (or rather John Cleese say) that this is not a sequel
to the hit comedy A FISH CALLED WANDA. It is in fact an 'equal.'
However, if he means that it has an equal amount of good jokes, then he
is sadly mistaken. This film is nowhere near as funny as WANDA.</P>
<P>The 'plot' centres around a zoo in London. It has been taken over by an
american company (the boss is played by Kevin Kline.) However, the
company don't want fluffy animals, because these don't pull in the
punters. Instead, he wants fierce creatures. He (the boss) also sends
Jamie Lee Curtis and his son (Kevin Kline again) to monitor the
progress of the zoo. What follows is a series of jokes centered around
John Cleese (who plays the owner of the zoo) and the situations that
arise when he is near animals. By the way, the plot about the fierce
creatures disappears after 20 minutes.</P>
<P>Because this film had the same cast, with them playing virtually the
same roles as in WANDA, I couldn't help comparing it with WANDA. And,
compared to WANDA its nowhere near as funny, but even on its on, its
not the comic epic I was expecting.</P>
<P>So, overall then, although there are a few laughs to be had, the film
is dissappointing, and I can really only recommended it if you're a big
fan of Cleese. Otherwise, wait for it on video.</P>
<PRE>RATING=**1/2 out of *****</PRE>
