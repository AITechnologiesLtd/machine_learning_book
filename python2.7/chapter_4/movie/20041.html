<PRE>LAKE PLACID
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR></PRE>
<P>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****)
20th Century Fox / 1:23 / 1999 / R (language, violence/gore)
Cast: Bridget Fonda; Bill Pullman; Oliver Platt; Brendan Gleeson; Betty
White; Meredith Salinger
Director: Steve Miner
Screenplay: David E. Kelley<HR></P>
<P>The biggest mystery in "Lake Placid" doesn't concern how a 30-foot Asian
crocodile migrated from its native continent to a seaside New England
community, but rather if the David E. Kelley credited with the
screenplay is the same David E. Kelley behind current TV lawyer hits
like "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice." The answer: a surprising yes. If
Kelley's trying to broaden his range and/or media success with this
sassy monster mish-mash, then mission partially accomplished.</P>
<P>While "McBeal"'s skinny Calista Flockhart fends off charges of anorexia
and bulimia, Kelley's Lake lead visibly noshes just fine - on anything
and everything in mouth's reach, in fact. He's the aforementioned
centerpiece of this clownish creature feature, a gargantuan reptile that
attracts the attention of provincial authorities and big city scientists
after leaving one of his chompers in a partially-consumed scuba snack.
All of the diver goes into the water, but only half comes up. This
casualty happens in the opening sequence, which makes obvious the
movie's sly agenda.</P>
<P>Enter "Lake Placid"'s human cast, an attractive crew of underdeveloped
but engaging personalities. Chief among them are Bridget Fonda, a
recently-dumped paleontologist with some amusing neurotic tics, and Bill
Pullman, a fish and game warden not given much in the way of interesting
traits. They team up with the local sheriff ("The General"'s Brendan
Gleeson) and an eccentric mythology expert (the wonderful Oliver Platt)
to investigate their surroundings, and this latter pair's ongoing
rivalry constitutes a great deal of "Lake Placid"'s offbeat enjoyment
factor.</P>
<P>Also present for potential animal nourishment is none other than Betty
White, and the ex-Golden Girl cusses a blue streak as a batty town
resident who isn't afraid to let loose some hilariously profane barbs
when provoked. The mere inclusion of this character further proves that
"Lake Placid" shouldn't be taken at horror-flick face value, but instead
relished as Kelley's mostly successful attempt to invest his trademark
wit and sarcasm in a genre typically associated with only unintentional
humor.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Kelley doesn't seem to want to script the whole show with
a wink, as evidenced by a throwaway budding romance between Fonda and
Pullman and several other serious sidetracks. "Lake Placid" runs a tight
83 minutes, hardly allowing time for any genuine lulls, but there are
some jarringly uncomfortable tone shifts. Good thing the movie moves at
a clip under the direction of Steve Miner, who, as evidenced in his
"Halloween: H20" last summer, still knows how to both keep tongue firmly
in cheek and stage an effective decapitation.</P>
<P>Of course, the audiences that will turn out for "Lake Placid" could
probably care less about the levels of irony found in this
"Jaws"-with-jokes. They'll want their fill of the film's cold-blooded
main attraction, of which they'll get a satisfying dose: This Stan
Winston-masterminded special effect - all imposing girth, teeth and
stare - is such a nifty sight that many will exit heralding, "What a
croc!" Those unenamored of "Lake Placid" might utter the same - only
with a K on the end of the last word.<HR></P>

"'20 Dates' tells the story of Myles Berkowitz, a man who wants to make
a film, and to fall in love. These areas are his ‘two greatest failures,
professional and personal,' so he decides to make a film about going out
on 20 dates. By the film's end, he has won the love of the lovely
Elisabeth - maybe - but his professional life is obviously still a
failure." -Roger Ebert on "20 Dates"</P>
