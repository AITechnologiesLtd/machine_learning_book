<P>At the press junket for "Charlie's Angels," director McG (pronounced
McGee), a music video and commercial veteran, explained his approach
towards his feature film debut. "We wanted to make a big, colorful,
exciting, larger-than-life sort of film that feels like you shook up a
bottle of champagne and just splashed it over a bunch of celluloid," he
said. "The goal was to take the comedy and turn it to 11, take the
action and turn it to 11, take the sexiness and turn it to 11 and just
max out this film…'"</P>
<PRE>Somebody get that boy some Ritalin.</PRE>
<P>McG achieved his goal. The big screen adaptation of the hit TV action
series from the '70s certainly reflects the unbridled enthusiasm of his
mission statement. From beginning to end, it cheerfully assaults the
viewer with every imaginable cinematic gimmick, punctuated by snippets
of no less than 39 pop songs. "Charlie's Angels" isn't just a
high-octane version of the original. It's also a 98-minute music video,
a slapstick comedy, a special effects showcase, a stunt spectacular, a
James Bond knock-off, a chop-socky fight movie and a paean to the '60s
"Batman" TV show's camp sensibilities.</P>
<P>In short, the film is a mess. More often than not, it's a surprisingly
fun mess, however, even though McG's inexperience with long-form
productions becomes more and more obvious as the story barrels forward
with all the finesse of a dozen Superballs ricocheting in a small
closet. I left "Charlie's Angels" entertained, but exhausted.</P>
<P>The plot, such as it is, goes as follows. Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan
(Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are the latest batch of ex-cops
working for the Townsend Detective Agency, where they receive their
assignments by phone from the always-unseen Charlie (voiced by John
Forsythe, the only returning member of the original cast). Aided by
their faithful right-hand man, Bosley (Bill Murray), the Angels set out
to retrieve kidnapped software genius Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell) and keep
his cutting-edge voice-recognition technology from falling into evil
hands. Along the way, they must deal with imperious a top-level Knox
exec Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), corporate competitor Roger Corwin (Tim
Curry, as smarmy as ever) and the Thin Man (Crispin Glover), an
extremely dangerous goon with a hair fetish.</P>
<P>Of course, the storyline is just a contrivance to allow the women to do
battle with bad guys while wearing various exotic costumes (two of the
Angels dress up in drag and, as a man, Drew Barrymore is a dead ringer
for James Spader). Incidentally, even though their enemies are heavily
armed, the Angels do not carry guns, proving definitively that Charlie's
last name is not Heston.</P>
<P>The film starts off with a bang-up James Bond style set piece, as the
camera seamlessly glides through the clouds into a passing luxury
airliner, where LL Cool J is dealing with a nut case. Abruptly, LL opens
the emergency exit, throws the man out and leaps after him, leading into
a skydiving sequence. The pair ends up in a speedboat, where we finally
meet the Angels.</P>
<P>As with the TV series, each Angel, while smart as a whip and
multitalented, can be summed up in one word. Drew Barrymore (who
co-produces the film) is the sexy one, Cameron Diaz is the giddy one and
Lucy Liu is the devilish one. The three actors are clearly having a
wonderful time with their roles and each is afforded showcase moments.
Liu gets to play dominatrix in an efficiency expert scene, Diaz shakes
her small, but shapely booty to the tune of "Baby Got Back" in a comic
bit on the set of "Soul Train," and Barrymore plays seductress with a
limo driver in a revealing scene that makes it clear why David Letterman
smiled so widely when she danced on his desk and flashed him.</P>
<P>A lot of "Charlie's Angels" works. The camaraderie between the women is
winning, some of the stunts are spectacular and a fair percent of the
jokes are actually funny (check out the slow-motion-hair-flipping
instructions during a party scene). I particularly enjoyed the frequent
use of rear screen projection, a clever nod to the cut rate filming
techniques employed by the original series.</P>
<P>What doesn't work is most of Bill Murray's shtick, the
less-than-graceful "Matrix" style wire work during the martial arts
segments, McG's uneven, needlessly rapid editing style and his
insistence on framing every shot as if it was the highlight of a music
video. Flinging everything but the kitchen sink at the viewer may work
in a three-minute MTV clip, but stretched over the length of a film, it
grows old fast. Even in an amusing trifle like "Charlie's Angels,"
things like consistency of tone still matter. Next time, McG, try
turning it down to 9 every once in a while.</P>
