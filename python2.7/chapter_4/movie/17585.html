<P>If you find yourself completely baffled by what's going on at any
given time during "The Matrix," don't be too hard on yourself.  It
appears the Wachowski Brothers, who wrote and directed this lavish
sci-fi thriller, wound up losing track of who's doing what to whom
early on in the game and decided to simply play the rest of this opus
by ear.</P>
<P>Like "Alice in Wonderland," from which it takes an early cue, "The
Matrix" creates its own logic, setting up rules just to break them and
making it clear that the one thing you can count on in this tale is
that you can't count on anything.</P>
<P>The erratic plotting would be a built-in turn-off in most movies, but
the Wachowskis manage to somehow turn chaos into an always intriguing,
frequently nightmarish look into the dismal future. The Wachowskis'
"Bound," a tense study of a deadly love triangle, quickly became an
acclaimed cult film when it was released in 1996, and "The Matrix"
seems certain to follow a similar course.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most impressive thing about "The Matrix" is the
Wachowskis' handling of Keanu Reeves, an actor who has lately bombed
hard in roles outside of his patented Valley Boy/wastoid niche.
Anyone who suffered through "Johnny Mnemonic" or "Chain Reaction"
probably won't be exactly geeked about the prospect of seeing Reeves
in action again.</P>
<P>And yet, his flat-toned voice and blank-slate face actually work to
his advantage as Neo Anderson, who's the only man on Earth capable of
destroying the Matrix, a computer-generated dreamworld controlled by
emotionless Agents, themselves the outgrowths of artificial
intelligence run amok. Assisting Neo in his mission are the
inscrutable Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the unsteady Cypher (Joe
Pantoliano) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a lithe beauty whose body
ought to be classified as a lethal weapon.</P>
<P>The action sequences which make up easily 80 percent of the movie are
spectacularly well-executed, combining kung fu and jujitsu moves with
time and space trickery that allows the fighters to hang in mid-air,
run up walls and freeze flying bullets before they reach their
targets.</P>
<P>"The Matrix" also includes some truly amazing visions of the world 200
years from now, including fields of cocooned human fetuses ready to be
harvested by towering robots, and fleets of Sentinels, electronic
monsters that look like neon-tinged jellyfish.</P>
<P>But what truly sets "The Matrix" apart from other exercises in style,
such as "Dark City" and "Blade" are the bursts of wit that keep
popping up: having the infamous monster movie "Night of the Lepus"
playing on TV some 200 years in the future, or showing us an
all-knowing oracle who lives not in a temple or a palace, but in a
run-down apartment where she bakes cookies in between predictions.</P>
<P>And, unlike "Dark" and "Blade," which lost their impetus after strong
starts, "The Matrix" actually picks up steam as it goes along. Who
cares if it never makes much sense? At least it's not dull.</P>
