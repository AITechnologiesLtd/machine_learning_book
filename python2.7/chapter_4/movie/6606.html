<P>Montreal 1996
The recently concluded Montreal World Film Festival is one of the better
known venues of the cinema world. It attempts to promote a wide range of
filmmakers from many countries by requiring as little as possible in
promotion expenditures. This year the Festival organizers paid special
attention to current Russian films and even gave a special prize in the
category of the Russian Cinema of Today. This writer was able to view a
number of the more significant films presented at the Festival. Preceding
my impressions I have included the official descriptions provided by the
Festival organizers.</P>

<P>The "Great Patriotic War" (World War II) was beginning to draw to a close.
But Stalin's repressive government agencies were still working at full
capacity and the plan for the mass deportation of the native inhabitants of
the Northern Caucasus was put into effect. March 8, 1944 became a black day
in the history of these people. The film tells their pathetic story.</P>

<P>The Second World War exposed the social, economic and national
contradictions within the Soviet Union. The great conquests of the October
Revolution: central planning, industrialization, cultural progress of
masses of people gave the Soviet state great advantages in the military
sphere by comparison with the preceding tsarist regime and assured its
final victory over fascism. Yet the bureaucratic police state of Stalin
undermined many of these gains and contributed to the initial victories of
the Nazi invaders: the policy of forced collectivization and artificial
famine of 1932 alienated the peasantry, especially in Ukraine, its economic
zigzags slowed industrial development, its police repression during the
Great Purges destroyed the fighting capacity of the Red Army, its eclectic
blindness allowed Hitler the element of surprise.</P>
<P>   Towards the end of the war the regime had to forestall any movement
among the masses of people towards greater democracy. For the Stalinist
bureaucracy, its policy of self preservation meant that the anger of the
Russian people at the great unnecessary losses had to be channeled into
Great Russian chauvinism, that the Soviet nationalities were to be pitted
against one another and the rigid police state of 1930's reestablished.
Over the next ten years we witness the harsh genocidal policies of exiling
and exterminating whole nationalities, relocation of peoples, anti-cultural
crusades of Zhdanov and the anti-Semitic campaign culminating with the
extermination of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and the Doctors' Plot.
   In 1941 Stalin disbanded the German Autonomous Region on the Volga. In
early 1944 the Stalinist regime attacked the following nationalities: the
Chechen, the Ingush, the Karachay, the Balkar, the Kalmyks, the Crimean
Tartars.</P>
<P>   This movie was introduced by its director Ruben Muradian as a
documentary story, telling the tragic events of March 1944 when the 40,000
members of the Balkar nation were picked up by the force of 20,000 NKVD
troops and driven thousands of miles to Siberia.
   Muradian does succeed in explaining that Stalin's policy was completely
irrational even from the point of view of nation building and state
security. The NKVD collected all persons of the Balkar nationality, even
the Party and Komsomol members, even the soldiers and officers of the Red
Army and their families, including Stalin's own henchmen in the local
hierarchy. They were all moved to the Siberian wilderness and great many of
them died en route or from the privations of the initial settlement period.
   Unfortunately, Muradian's method of story telling turns this historic
tragedy into something of a melodrama. He pads the movie with much scenic
imagery (probably to save money). His use of documentary materials is
primitive: his long repetitious sequences of moving locomotives and trains
do not add much to our understanding of events. On the other hand, he uses
actors for all the action scenes, contemporary people instead of photos of
the real victims, imagined story instead of the grim tales of 1944. He
shows us a dying Red Army soldier and his fiancee, and turns the crying
girl's face towards the camera milking us for emotions. He shows an elderly
woman dying of a heart attack as the NKVD bastard pushes her down. He shows
a loyal Stalinist committing suicide, a Red Army hero chasing the trains
across the country, and so on. Such things happened, to be sure, but this
reviewer does not like the movie directors who use these hackneyed cliches
to jerk tears out of the viewer.
   As interesting as the movie is the tale of its screening around the
world and in Russia itself. The Russian government film agency Roskomkino
normally provides the seed money, the permits for studio use and other
facilities to film a movie. Muradian's movie was duly filmed, a copy sent
to Roskomkino, one reel was sent to the festivals around the world 
 and
that is all. This picture was not screened in Russia at all, and the
director does not know of any plans to do so.
   This writer suggests that this movie was produced solely as a showpiece
at the festivals like the Montreal venue to provide the public opinion in
the West with a proof of the liberal and democratic intentions of the
current Russian regime. True, Yeltsin and his generals did bomb Chechnia
into the Stone Age, kill some thirty thousand and send hundreds of
thousands more to squatter camps in the neighboring regions. But, the IMF
and the World Bank can assure the gullible public that some of the money
they sent to Russia was spent on filming this humanitarian drama, and this
proves that Yeltsin's heart is in the right place.
   How do you, my reader, like to be taken for a fool?
