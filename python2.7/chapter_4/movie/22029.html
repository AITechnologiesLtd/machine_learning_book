<P>When you go see movies on a regular basis, you are bound to become more savvy 
in the calculations of any one story, being able to pinpoint elements that 
have been done just a few too many times in previous films for it to be 
surprising or particularly memorable. Sometimes, you want to see a movie so 
that it will take you on some sort of journey that has never, or rarely, been 
taken before in the world of film. </P>
<P>Such is the case with director Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich," which is 
bound to be one the most unusual motion pictures of 1999. And I don't mean in 
a David Lynchian sort of way, because while it may have hints of that "Twin 
Peaks" helmer's trademark weirdness and peculiarities, it has an overall 
style all its own. Just the thought that someone actually conjured up such an 
inventive tale (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman) gives hope for further 
innovative motion pictures that may be struggling through the pipeline simply 
because they are too "strange" to actually be made. In that respect, "Being 
John Malkovich" is groundbreaking in its sheer abandon of conventional plots, 
and in its embrace of nothing but complete originality.</P>
<P>While the story may seem confusing, it surprisingly makes total sense (well, 
at least as much of it as one can possibly understand). Ultimately, one could 
even see how, in lesser hands, this film could have been disastrous. Its 
tricky tone was, no doubt, difficult to perfect, as it is an out-and-out 
fantasy, but set in a very realistic present day New York City, yet relies on 
its offbeat humor to pull off the act. In fact, the comedy needed to be 
successful because, otherwise, the film would have just been too 
preposterous. One of the delights about "Being John Malkovich" is how very 
funny it is--easily one of the most laugh-inducing I've seen this year--and 
once the viewer settles into its oddball tone, the film entertains, excites, 
and is even thought-provoking in its handling of such issues as identity 
discovery and the manipulation over others.</P>
<P>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a down-on-his-luck master puppeteer without a 
job and much money, living in a Manhattan apartment with his pet store-owning 
and animal-loving wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Tired of his life going nowhere, 
Craig finds an ad in the classifieds and answers the position of a filing 
clerk--on the 7 1/2th floor of an office building, where the ceiling is just 
four feet high. The inhabitants of the floor are an unusual bunch, including 
Floris (May Kay Place), the hearing-impaired secretary who misunderstands 
almost everything a person says and, yet, believes it is not she, but them 
that have the handicap; and the 105-year-old boss, Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), 
who is convinced Floris cannot understand him because he has a speech 
impediment (when Craig tells Dr. Lester that he can understand him perfectly 
fine, his reply is, "Flattery will get you nowhere with me."). And then 
there's Maxine (Catherine Keener), an alluring, beautiful woman whom Craig 
instantly falls head over heels for, even though the feeling is clearly not 
mutual.</P>
<P>One day, when Craig accidentally drops a file behind a stack of cabinets in 
his office, he removes them from the wall to find a small doorway, large 
enough to crawl through. Opening it up and venturing inside the seemingly 
never-ending tunnel, a force abruptly blows him through the portal, and he 
suddenly finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich, peering through 
his eyes--but only for a 15-minute period--after which he is dumped upon the 
embankment next to the New Jersey Turnpike. It's a bit tricky to say much 
more, in fear of giving away too much (even though, believe me, I haven't 
even scratched the surface), but suffice to say, in a plot to make money, 
Craig and Maxine start their own business where anyone can go into 
Malkovich's mind for $200 a pop. Meanwhile, Craig and Lotte both become 
addicted to being able to take over the identity of another person, sparked 
by their unhappiness in the lives they currently lead.  </P>
<P>One might wonder why John Malkovich, playing a version of himself very well, 
is the celebrity that was chosen as the subject of the film, but it does sort 
of have a symmetry to it, since he is a consistently well-received actor who 
the casual filmgoer most likely has heard of, but knows nothing about. A 
running joke in the film is that the characters can't think of any movies 
he's been in, even though they seem to remember him playing a jewel thief. 
The ingenious idea of being able to get inside the mind of another human 
being is something I do not recall ever being done before, and while 
obviously far-fetched, the film is realistic in its portrayal of people who 
find themselves being swept away by the thought of being someone else, 
someone more successful and respected than they are.</P>
<P>The three central characters are portrayed by a talented crop of actors who 
take every role they play, and run with them. John Cusack is very good as 
Craig, a man with very little self-esteem and bad posturing (he walks slumped 
over, even when not on the 7 1/2th floor). Of the three major roles, however, 
Craig is the least interesting and flashy one, and he doesn't go through as 
much of an internal transformation like the others do. Cusack is flawlessly 
cast and does a fine job with what he is given, but if there is an 
underwritten role here, it is his.</P>
<P>When Cameron Diaz first appeared on the scene in 1994's "The Mask," it's 
difficult to believe anyone could have suspected she was such a stunningly 
diverse talent, not to mention one of the most intelligent actresses of her 
generation. Diaz can star as the likable love interest in a blockbuster film 
(1998's "There's Something About Mary"), but is just as likely to try 
something a little more risky and challenging (a crazed, self-absorbed 
bride-to-be in 1998's "Very Bad Things"). With "Being John Malkovich," Diaz 
gives her most assured performance to date, as the frizzy-haired, frumpy 
Lotte, and is nearly unrecognizable compared to the beauty she really is. In 
a plot development that won't be revealed here, Lotte comes to a 
life-altering realization after her first trip inside John Malkovich's mind. 
While outrageous on first thought, it is also oddly believable and wholly 
makes sense when you think about it in the context of the character.</P>
<P>Catherine Keener, a marvel to behold in every single film she appears in, 
exudes an outer iciness on first appearance, as Maxine, but wisely is 
developed into a confused and lonely three-dimensional character by the 
film's second half. Working in the world of indie films for several years, 
Keener is just now breaking out into bigger roles in more high-profile 
projects, and good for her. She deserves all the attention she is just 
starting to receive.</P>
<P>The writing, by Charlie Kaufman, is full of such intelligent, dry wit and 
appropriately goofy ideas, that the film is a comic goldmine, even among the 
more serious aspects of the story. The opening sections, especially, almost 
had me on the verge of completely breaking down at the thought of its sheer 
hilarity. Director Spike Jonze (who had an impressive acting role as the 
fourth king in "Three Kings") proves here to be one of the most exciting and 
fresh current filmmakers, and kudos to him for obtaining the willpower and 
courage to film such a purely individualistic creation. "Being John 
Malkovich" is a stunner through-and-through, and can safely stand as one of 
the very best motion pictures of the season.</P>
