<P>     On the surface, MR. JEALOUSY is not a subtle film -- it's a dark 
comedy about what happens when a man's deep-rooted insecurity undermines 
his romantic relationship.  At times, the plot ventures into sit-com 
land, and director Noah Baumbach borrows liberally from other directors 
(Woody Allen and Whit Stillman in particular).  Nevertheless, despite 
numerous flaws, I appreciated elements of MR. JEALOUSY, in large part 
because Baumbach captures something about the inherent insecurity in 
sexual relationships that most films either ignore or oversimplify.  
Like Kevin Smith's CHASING AMY, this movie addresses questions about 
trust and fidelity, and gets some of the details right.</P>
<P>     The perfect relationship is an unattainable dream.  Whenever two 
people get together, each of them brings along a certain amount of 
baggage.  In the case of Lester Grimm (Eric Stoltz), anything less than 
a luggage cart won't carry it all.  Half a lifetime ago, when Lester was 
a teenager, he had the unpleasant experience of watching his date make 
out with another guy.  Ever since then, Lester has had serious issues 
about trusting women.  It's in his nature to expect betrayal, and to 
become suspicious whenever he sees a girlfriend talking to another man 
(especially an old flame).  This near-paranoid jealousy has led to at 
least one wrecked relationship.</P>
<P>     When Lester meets Ramona (Annabella Sciorra), he vows that things 
will be different.  Then he learns that Ramona has led a very active 
sexual life, and he begins to wonder what she was like before he met 
her, and whether her past track record might make her a candidate to 
cheat on him.  One day, he follows one of Ramona's ex's, a semi-famous 
author named Dashiell Frank (Christopher Eigeman), and learns where he 
attends a twice-weekly group therapy session.  Lester promptly joins the 
group.  Unwilling to reveal his genuine identity and history to 
Dashiell, Lester pretends to be his best friend, Vince (Carlos Jacott).  
But things get a little more complicated than Lester ever could have 
imagined.</P>
<P>     MR. JEALOUSY isn't the kind of movie that forges an intimate 
emotional connection between the protagonist and the audience.  The 
frequent, glib narrative voiceover ensures a certain distance between 
Lester and us.  After all, it's difficult to get involved in a 
character's life when the film maker is constantly intruding on the 
story with occasionally-amusing but often-superfluous commentary (sort 
of like watching MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000).  On an intellectual 
level, however, MR. JEALOUSY works when we try to puzzle out how we 
would react in Lester's position and whether his fears are well-founded.  
Baumbach understands the roots of relationship angst, and how damaging 
it can be, and, like Woody Allen, he opts for something more insightful 
than a superficial treatment.</P>
<P>     MR. JEALOUSY's central contrivance hurts the film's believability.  
It's hard to accept that Lester would be welcomed into an exclusive 
therapy group with one of the best psychologists in New York while 
posing as his best friend.  It's even less likely that Vince would later 
be admitted into the same group when using a fake British accent and 
pretending to be Lester.  The entire dynamic seems unnecessarily 
fabricated, and the slim humor that Baumbach milks from the situation 
isn't worth the strain on the story's credibility.</P>
<P>     Good acting is crucial to the success of an intimate piece like 
this, and MR. JEALOUSY is blessed with a solid cast.  Eric Stoltz (who 
previously worked with Baumbach in KICKING AND SCREAMING) makes Lester's 
paranoia seem almost rational (that's because it's presented as only a 
slight exaggeration of insecurities that everyone is familiar with).  
Chris Eigeman (a Whit Stillman regular who was also in KICKING AND 
SCREAMING) applies his uniquely flippant-yet-intense style to Dashiell.  
Annabella Sciorra is effective as Ramona, although the character could 
have used a little more fleshing out.  The supporting performers include 
Carlos Jacott as Vince, Marianne Jean-Baptiste (SECRETS AND LIES) as 
Vince's fiancee, Brian Kerwin as another of Ramona's ex-boyfriends, 
Peter Bogdanovich as a psychiatrist, and Bridget Fonda as Dashiell's 
current girlfriend. </P>
<P>     In the end, I felt much the same about MR. JEALOUSY as I did about 
Baumbach's previous feature, KICKING AND SCREAMING.  The movie paints a 
good portrait of some of the most common Generation X concerns, but 
fails to personalize them.  The writer/director may have a deep 
understanding of his material, but MR. JEALOUSY doesn't offer anything 
original or remarkable, and, while what the film is saying often strikes 
a responsive chord, that alone isn't enough to earn it an enthusiastic 
recommendation.  </P>
