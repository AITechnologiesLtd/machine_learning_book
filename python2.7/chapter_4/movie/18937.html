<P>Director Bill Condon delivers this brilliant look into one of the world's most
famous motion picture directors, the director of Frankenstein and The Bride of
Frankenstein, James Whale.  Gods and Monsters is about this interesting man in
the last years of his life.  Ian McKellen, who deserved to win the Oscar for
this role, plays Whale with such enthusiasm and talent, developing his
character to the fullest.  James Whale, who has been out of the motion picture
business for around twenty years, has been living in a relatively small home,
with his maid Hannah, played by Lynn Redgrave, who also deserved the Oscar for
Best Supporting Actress, an elderly woman with a strange accent, who loves her
boss.  One secret that is not known among the public is that Whale is gay.  One
man that definitely doesn't know so is his gardener, Clay Boone, played by
Brendan Fraser, who becomes friends with Whale as they discuss Whale's hard
life, through directing his movies, through Whale's hard times at war, and
losing his friends.</P>
<P>The relationship between the James and Clay becomes greater throughout the
film, and is developed much like a father/son relationship, in which Clay
starts to admire Whale, but at the same time doesn't realize that his friend is
gay.</P>
<P>The screenplay, which was written by Bill Condon, is marvelous, using
flashbacks and hallucinations that really let you into the mind of Whale while
his mentally stable status plummets.  Gods and Monsters isn't just a look
inside the director's mind, but it shows what war can do to a man, years after
the events occurred, in ways that will in turn, haunt the viewer.  Looking back
on the film, I still remember those disturbing sequences, and I get a chill.</P>
<P>The entire premise of this film is brilliant, for it's not too often we get to
see what the people behind the films and plays are like.  Much like Shakespeare
in Love, which let us see William Shakespeare, Gods and Monsters has one of the
best screenplays of 1998.  James Whale is shown not only dramatically, but
comically as well, as he asks men to remove an article of clothing for every
question he answers in an interview.  James Whale is much like another recent
Ian McKellen character, in the film Apt Pupil, in which McKellen played a
former Nazi who still held the memories, and changed the life of a young boy,
played by Brad Renfro, forever.  Unlike Apt Pupil though, Gods and Monsters
isn't as intense, as it concentrates more on quality rather than the intensity
Apt Pupil had.</P>
<P>Lynn Redgrave is almost completely unrecognizable as Hannah, using a hysterical
accent, and walking around with a hunchback.  Hannah added a lot to the overall
effect of the film, showing how one can put up with the strange man.</P>
<P>Brendan Fraser gives his best performance of his career, making Gods and
Monsters his breakthrough film that will make him mainstream.  Clayton,
Fraser's character, is one that seems like your average person, and as his life
is completely changed by that of James Whale's, Fraser is able to go places
with his character that he hasn't been able to in past roles, giving a dramatic
and moving performance.</P>
<P>Gods and Monsters overwhelmed me, as I viewed this man's life come to a slow,
moving halt, when I expected only a light and interesting drama, based on clips
from the film.  What moved me the most was the flashbacks, and this combined
with the great performances by McKellen, Fraser, and Redgrave make for a
memorable film which will be in my mind for days to come. </P>
<P>The Bottom Line- One of the most moving, compelling, and best films of 1998.</P>
