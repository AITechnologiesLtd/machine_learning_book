<PRE>DANCER, TEXAS POP. 81
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by small town native Tim McCanlies, Dancer, Texas
Pop. 81 is a film that shares many of the same qualities of a small
town.  It's small, unassuming, easygoing and has a certain kind of charm
that will resonate well with audiences anxious for a change of pace from
the hustle and bustle of big budgeted Hollywood extravaganzas.</P>
<P>Dancer is a very small town in West Texas, composed mostly of ranchers,
oilmen and their families.  Dancer's largest senior class (5) is about
to graduate, and a moment of truth is coming for four of the boys.  As
children, the four best friends made a solemn vow to leave Dancer for
Los Angeles on the Monday following graduation.  However, now that day
is fast approaching, and the four young adults are now having second
thoughts about leaving behind everything they have known.</P>
<P>The leader of the foursome, Keller (Breckin Meyer), has meticulously
researched and plotted every facet of the trip...but he never counted on
a mutiny.  The first one to voice doubts is Terrell Lee (Peter
Facinelli), whose overbearing parents (Patricia Wettig and Michael
O'Neill) want him to continue the family oil business.  But also
experiencing second thoughts are the rancher John (Eddie Mills), who
wonders about the place of a cowboy in L.A., and the oddball Squirrel
(Ethan Embry), who starts thinking of his alcoholic father (Keith
Szarabajka).</P>
<P>As the four teens deliberate their future and reflect upon their past,
we are treated to a knowing glimpse at the charms and pains of small
town life. The pace of the movie is as slow and relaxed as a warm summer
day, but, since it fits the mood of the movie, it is not distracting in
the slightest.</P>
<P>The four leads are engaging (though Embry overacts a bit as the most
comical of the four).  But the whole of the film works much better on
the ensemble level...there's not anyone who particularly stands out from
the cast, but the combined whole manage to create a realistically
pleasant small town atmosphere.</P>
<P>Though the question of whether or not the four friends will actually
leave has set the town of Dancer abuzz, it's not as much of a mystery to
a knowing audience. If you're familiar with typical movie conventions,
it's not that big of a challenge to accurately predict who will stay and
who will go.  At least, enjoyment of the movie is not contingent on the
suspense.</P>
<P>Those expecting an explosion around every corner might be disappointed
by Dancer, Texas Pop. 81.  But, for those looking for entertainment with
a change of pace, the movie delivers an enjoyable break from the
razzle-dazzle of big budget fare.</P>
