<PRE>TOGETHER (TILLSAMMANS)
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>My memory might be a bit hazy, but Together dealt with the following
subjects among a dozen different characters:  growing up, divorce,
lesbianism/homosexuality, loneliness, Communism, spousal abuse, shoddy
parenting, infidelity, and marital discontent.  I might have forgotten
about the release of Abba's third album in there, but again my memory
flickers.</P>
<P>What I do remember is that the movie takes place in 1975 Stockholm at a
large house full of free-loving Communists -- kind of like The Real
World, if Karl Marx and Hugh Hefner shared a flat with an MTV feed.  The
leader of the group is Göran (Gustav Hammertoe), a gentle fellow with a
great beard, whose sister, Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren), escapes her
abusive lout of a husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist) by moving with her two
kids into Göran's clan.  This, of course, sets in motion a series of
changes for everyone in the house.</P>
<P>The moviegoer is also in for a challenge.  There are so many changes,
along with so many characters, that it's hard to keep up.  I entirely
forgot about two characters before they were reintroduced midway through
the film.  Dramas with large ensemble casts are difficult to maintain,
and Together is a great example of why that happens.</P>
<P>To me the model of a great ensemble drama is Paul Thomas Anderson's
Boogie Nights, because it took the time and the effort to let us know a
bit about each and every character.  It also had technical flair and a
plot that dug into the characters' hubris and fragile egos. 
Writer/director Lukas Moodysson doesn't let us know the characters
because it's in such a damned hurry.  We get no sense of a group
dynamic, no sense of character structure.  It's the cinematic equivalent
of a long flipbook.</P>
<P>Very rarely in Together do we get an idea of the emotions behind the
characters.  At one point, Göran suddenly and violently throws out his
promiscuous girlfriend, Lena (played with misguided, slutty conviction
by Anja Lundkvist).  It's easily the movie's most passionate moment. 
We've seen Lena's cavalier treatment of Göran and we understand his
action, though he says their relationship is open.  However, Moodysson
never offers this kind of absorbing history for everyone else, so we're
essentially stuck with empty gestures.  When he tries to offer some
sense of togetherness (no pun intended) like a soccer game or a crowded
dinner table, there's little to hold on to because we feel like we don't
know these people.</P>
<P>I would have been content just watching Rolf try to win back the
confidence of his wife and kids; Rolf's struggle to gain redemption is
fully believable and the sturdiest branch on the plot tree.  So much
goes on that it's not nearly as effective as it should be.  The director
is too busy looking at the repressed family next door, homosexual
encounters, and the household's introduction to meat and television.</P>
<P>There are definitely some highlights sprinkled throughout, apart from
the copious amount of nudity (both male and female).  The relationship
that Elisabeth's pubescent daughter (Emma Samuelsson) has with the boy
next door (Henrik Lundström) hits all the awkward notes, as does
Enqvist's painful attempts to get back in his family's good graces.  The
movie needs twenty more minutes, five fewer subplots, and a compass.</P>
