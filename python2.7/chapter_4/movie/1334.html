<PRE>                                  BAXTER
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>82 min., not rated, Drama, 1991, In French with English subtitles
Director: Jerome Boivin
Cast: sorry, missed them</P>
<P>     The life of a dog, as told by a dog.  The dog, Baxter, travels from
owner to owner trying to find one he likes.  The first owner is an old
lady who just sits around all the time doing nothing fun and worrying
about when she is going to die.  The second owners are a couple of young
lovers.  The final owner is a sadistic boy who is really into Naziism.</P>
<P>     I found BAXTER to be a generally unappealing film.  It does,
however, seem to have a message behind it.  I feel that Baxter
represents the average person.  The old lady represents people who have
given up on life.  The lovers represent people who feel that life is
nothing but fun and that they don't have any responsibility.  The boy
represents overachievers, and sadistic fanatic.  Baxter has to find
where he fits in.  I think he represents the human race trying to find
where they fit in.  With all things considered, I give BAXTER a two on a
scale of zero to five.  BAXTER is unrated but contains female nudity,
adult situations, violence, and explicit language.</P>
<P>     The dog picked to portray Baxter is a not very attractive looking
dog.  This gives the film an unpleasant feel.  There is really nothing
bad to say about the acting.  The actors/actresses seem to do a good
job, but the characters they play are not very pleasant:  the old lady,
who has given up on life moping around; the two lovers, who at first
only care about themselves; the boy, who is brilliant, psychotic, and
brutal.  Speaking of the boy, his character is especially chilling.
Being psychologically able to do some of the things he does is almost
unthinkable.  The settings for the film are grim and unpleasant to look
at too.</P>
<P>     I don't recommend that you go see this film, or if you do that you
go to a very cheap showing so that you don't come out thinking that you
wasted your money.  I really didn't enjoy it very much.   One last note,
this film is not for animal lovers, because of what happens to some
animals in the film.</P>
