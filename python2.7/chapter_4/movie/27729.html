<P>A cold workaholic. A free spirit who gradually helps him to loosen up and 
care about others. An unforeseen passion between the two unlikely souls. A 
tragic secret that threatens to tear them apart. Had "Sweet November," 
directed by Pat O'Connor (1998's "Dancing at Lughnasa"), been handled with 
less care, it would have surely seemed like little else than a weepy NBC 
"movie-of-the-week." Its offbeat, somewhat far-fetched premise gradually 
makes way for the type of conventional romantic drama that could only end 
with a tearjerker ending. In raising the material slightly above the norm for 
this indisputable, somewhat shameless genre, screenwriter Kurt Voelker has 
offered a subtle hand in making everything come together without as much sap 
as there could have been. Ultimately, the movie is far from perfect, and the 
running time is about fifteen minutes past its prime, but it genuinely 
surprises by saving itself with the gently done, powerful conclusion.</P>
<P>Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is a hard-working, emotionless San Francisco ad 
executive who is so dedicated to his work, he has lost track of the other 
things in life that make it worth living. He lives so much by the clock, in 
fact, that when his alarm goes off while he is in the middle of having sex 
with his neglected girlfriend, Anjelica (Lauren Graham), he immediately stops 
to get ready for work.</P>
<P>While renewing his license at the local DMV, Nelson has a chance meeting with 
Sara Deever (Charlize Theron), who is thrown out of the testing center for 
responding to a question that Nelson whispers to her. Without a license, she 
persuades Nelson to act as her chauffeur one night, only to break into an 
animal shelter and save two puppies from being put to death. A joyous, 
beautiful, young woman who has learned to not take life for granted for even 
a second, Sara presents Nelson with a proposition: for the entire month of 
November, she will invite him to move in with her, and spend every minute 
with him. Nelson thinks she's crazy.</P>
<P>After a failed meeting the next day and a nasty confrontation with his boss, 
Nelson finds himself fired from his job. To make matters worse, Anjelica 
leaves him. With nothing to lose, Nelson finally accepts Sara's offer. Her 
goal, of course, is to make him wake up and smell the coffee--that is, become 
a better, more well-rounded and humane, person. As Nelson gradually falls for 
her, Sara is frightened to find herself attracted to him in a way she never 
has before. The answer to why Sara casually chooses a man every month to mold 
and enlighten is one that Nelson is unsure of, although it is sure to be 
uncovered by the time November comes to a close.</P>
<P>A remake of the same-titled 1968 film starring Sandy Dennis and Anthony 
Newley, "Sweet November" meanders for much of its length, yet never so much 
that it doesn't have time to recover for an excellent final half-hour. The 
success of the climax comes as something of a shock, considering that it is 
this potentially asinine section that seemed most likely to fail. What comes 
before isn't so much bad as it is merely shopworn. The machinations of the 
generic plot work overtime to offer little in the way of original material, 
and many sequences feel repetitive, as if they are just repeating what has 
already been established in the budding romance between Nelson and Sara.</P>
<P>Increasing the classiness of "Sweet November" and making its developments 
credible is the exquisite Charlize Theron (2000's "The Legend of Bagger 
Vance"). In a role that somehow feels made precisely for her, as a showcase 
for both her beauty and talent, Theron creates a character that is as lovable 
and alluring as she is unconventional in her way of life. Having Nelson fall 
hopelessly in love with Sara seems like a nonexistent stretch with someone 
like Theron playing her, and we grow to care about her in a way that is not 
immediately palpable.</P>
<P>In his second film with Theron (after 1997's superior, scary "The Devil's 
Advocate"), Keanu Reeves makes for a believably close-vested, frigid 
businessman in the first half, and a progressively softer human being who 
realizes the artificiality of his day-to-day existence in the latter. 
Criticized in the past for his less-than-naturalistic performances, there is 
no doubt that Reeves has matured as an actor in recent years, plausibly 
playing a serial killer (2000's "The Watcher"), an abusive, backwoods husband 
(2000's "The Gift"), an unsuspecting computer programmer/action hero (1999's 
"The Matrix"), and a football player (2000's "The Replacements").</P>
<P>The supporting cast is almost uniformly good, if not necessarily 
well-developed. Jason Isaacs (the villainous Col. Tavington in 2000's "The 
Patriot") is a standout as Chaz, the best friend/neighbor of Sara's, offering 
up a strong amount of wisdom and sweetness, while Michael Rosenbaum (1998's 
"Urban Legend") shows much promise in the small role of his caring boyfriend. 
Greg Germann (TV's "Ally McBeal") serviceably plays Reeves' snooty 
coworker-partner, but remains one-dimensional throughout. And Liam Aiken 
(1998's "Stepmom") poses as only a cursory annoyance as a fatherless child 
who takes a liking to Nelson.</P>
<P>The dreamy cinematography by Edward Lachman successfully present the 
surroundings with the appropriate amount of beauty Sara so passionately sees 
in the world, while the music score, by Christopher Young, thankfully does 
not overpower the actors' emotions or spell out what we are supposed to feel 
in any given scene. Meanwhile, the recurring song in the picture, "Only You," 
by Enya, is perfect in setting up its "Love Story" angle, as well as the 
character of Sara.</P>
<P>For the middle forty-five minutes, the energy in "Sweet November" admittedly 
begins to flag. With Sara and Nelson now in love, the story slows to a crawl 
and starts to repeat itself, all the while setting up the tragic plot twist 
that everything predictably leads up to. While this turn doesn't fully 
succeed and isn't exactly necessarily, credit director Pat O'Connor for 
playing it out with a generally light touch and (spoiler alert ahead) sparing 
us a deathbed scene. "Sweet November" is flawed, to be sure, but its heart 
sure is in the right place.</P>
