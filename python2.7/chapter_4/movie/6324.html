<PRE>                         COURAGE UNDER FIRE
                       A film review by Viboon
                        Copyright 1996 Viboon</PRE>
<P>This 1996 film is directed by Edward Zwick (Legends of the Fall), stars
Denzel Washington (Crimson Tide), Meg Ryan (When a Man Loves a Woman)
and Lou Diamond Phillips (Labamba). It has a running time of 155
minutes. There are some explosive combat violence and some foul
language, but no nudity, gore nor sex.</P>
<P>Courage Under Fire is the first big-budget Hollywood movie about the
Gulf War. An Army Lieutenant Colonel, Nat Serling (Denzel Washington),
ordered his men to fire at a seemingly enemy tank in the confusion of a
night battle. However, it turned out that the tank was one of their own
and he had indirectly killed his close friend. Pardoned, but ridden with
guilt and disillusioned, Serling was re-assigned to the Pentagon to
investigate a candidate for the Medal of Honour -- Capt. Karen Walden
(Meg Ryan), the first woman ever nominated for the award. It was
reported that Walden had lead a helicopter rescue mission that saved
many lives, but ultimately sacrificing her's. On paper, Walden certainly
deserved the medal. However, as the investigation wore on, there were
more questions than answers, and Serling became increasing confused by
the testimony of the eyewitnesses.
His search for the truth, both in his life and in Walden's death, was
what the movie was about.</P>
<P>The film explored some sub-plots along the way. First was the
self-destructive nature of Serling. After the friendly fire situation,
he was no more the macho "kill 'em all" type. Instead, he became an
alcoholic, had frequent nightmares and was unable to connect with his
family -- the investigation was the only thing that kept him in one
piece, will he ever recover? Then the movie also touched on the issue of
women in combat, even with everything being equal, will they be treated
so? Also surfaced was the relationship of Serling and his mentor, Gen.
Hershberg (Michael Moriarty). The latter wanted the medal to be approved
(under pressure from the White House) and the friendly fire incident
forgotten, however Serling had different ideas. How will the conflict be
resolved?</P>
<P>Courage Under Fire could be viewed as a courtroom movie without the
courtroom. The investigation into Walden's last day made up most of the
movie. And here lies the movie's greatest strength. Eyewitness accounts
can be unreliable, but several somewhat bizarre accounts on the same
event can provide much mystery. As Serling listened to the eyewitnesses,
the audience were treated to the visuals of the story. Surprisingly, the
movie did not feel repetitive at all. The writer had taken great care
that the story flowed even during flashbacks, and the editing team made
sure that the action was as tight the fourth time as it was the first
time the story was told. And because of this, the movie kept the
audience engaged. They had become the jury, listening to Walden's case,
and Serling's character was the prosecutor examining the witnesses.</P>
<P>As an added bonus, the main characters were also portrayed well by the
main stars. Denzel Washington was fine as usual as the hero. Meg Ryan
managed to shed more of her cute image and showed the different sides of
Walden, as described by the witnesses. Lesser characters were also
adequately believable.</P>
<P>However, Courage Under Fire was not without its flaws. The movie tried
to tackle many issues at once, resulting in some sub-plots (mentioned
above) being under-developed, or resolved too easily. An example would
be Serling's character. His role in the movie was at times overshadowed
by Walden's, even though he should be the person at the centre of our
focus. The movie ended too conveniently when the investigation ended.
When all is said and done, Courage Under Fire is still worth the $7, it
kept the audience engaged for most of the film, questioning the fate of
Walden. It also flowed easily, with no major plot hiccups. On the scale
of army drama, it is not A Few Good Men of 1996. But it certainly packed
more drama than the recently shown A Time To Kill.</P>
