<P>   When the most successful playwright in history grinds out
another script, the public takes notice.  Neil Simon, whose 
Tony award-winning "Biloxi Blues" in 1984 won him renewed
respect from critics after a couple of years of duds, received
even more kudos during that Broadway season for recasting
"The Odd Couple" for women.  But the film version of "The
Odd Couple" did not match its 1970s TV embodiment when
Felix Ungar (Tony Randall) played his cranky, compulsive
personality off the slob-inspired character of his boorish
roommate, Oscar Madison (Jack Klugman).  The trouble with
"The Odd Couple II" is not so much its deja vu, but its inability
to make two seventy-year-olds as vital as the youthful
originals.</P>
<P>   "The Odd Couple II" is on a level with "Grumpy Old Men,"
which is about two single retirees (Walter Matthau and Jack
Lemmon) living in Minnesota who turn into libidinous
teenagers when a beautiful widow (Ann-Margret) moves
across the street.  As though Howard Deutsch felt he could
direct a less malnourished comedy than Donald Petrie, he
dished out its sequel, "Grumpier Old Men," whose claim to
classic status consisted of the same odd couple spouting
epithets at each other and arguing about their children's
coming wedding.  Now, in "The Odd Couple II," Oscar
Madison and Felix Ungar are back after a seventeen-year
period of living apart--Oscar in Sarasota and Felix in New
York--reuniting to attend the marriage of two of their children.</P>
<P>   Most of the story takes place on Los Angeles highways as
the two old buddies renew their animosity as they travel from
the L.A. airport to the site of the wedding in a small California
town whose name, San Melina, they seem unable to recall. 
Admitting that they get along "like oil and frozen yogurt," the
two travelers lose their Budget rent-a-car as it rolls down a hill
and bursts into flames. They get mixed up unwittingly in a
scheme to transport illegal aliens, winding up in the office of a
small-town sheriff (Barnard Hughes).  They are sprayed by
pesticides on a remote California highway, have a near-affair
with two biker girls, Thelma and Holly (Christine Baranski and
Jean Smart), and are briefly taken on a joy ride by the two
trashy husbands of the aggressive women.  </P>
<P>   Most of the one-liners center on sex and aging,  Oscar and
Felix metaphorically discussing the decline of their "wicks"
and determined to revive the joys of adolescence before their
situation regresses even more. (Remember that the movie
was made before the FDA approved the drug, Viagran.)  In
one unconvincing episode Felix, despite his experience with
three marriages, is tongue-tied when he acts to take an
aircraft seat next to a woman he has just met, Felice (Mary
Beth Peil).</P>
<P>   The movie's main intention is to spoof old age, which it
does by its stereotypes of the elderly, taking particular aim at
the man-hungry Florida widows (nicknamed in the cast notes
as "The Grouch," "The Whiner," "The Nosher," and "The
Vixen").  During a poker game in Sarasota Oscar serves them
the only  foods that senior citizens are allegedly capable of
handling, including tofu corned beef and a no-fat, no-
cholesterol, no taste pastry.  The men get off easier.  In the
opening baseball game, the youthful players, who are making
one error after another on the field, are chided by Oscar, who
is commenting on the game from the stands: "The old cockers
in the stands are better than the young cockers in the field."</P>
<P>   There are some amusing moments in the film as you might
expect from a Neil Simon script acted by two veteran comics,
but you may at times actually wish that director Howard
Deutch would install a laugh track to avoid the periods of
dead air between one-liners. Cognoscenti of Simon's works
will recognize a repetition of the theme of the final scene of
his "Plaza Suite," as a mother and father fight among
themselves over the best way to get their daughter out of the
bathroom and down to the ballroom where her guests await
her.  But where Mamma yells in that one "I want you to come
out of the bathroom and get married!" there is only a pale
imitation of that wit as Oscar confronts his about-to-be-
married son (Jonathan Silverman), who has escaped to the
roof in conflict.  Rated PG-13.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C)
