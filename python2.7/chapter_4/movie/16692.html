<P>(Seen at the 22nd Portland International Film Festival, in Portland, Oregon)</P>
<P> Liking this film may be hard. But there is one thing that is astounding in
it and exceptional that is hard to dismiss. If the script did not have it,
at least the two women about whom this film's story is centered is too well
written and developed to make this film not liked, or not enjoyed.</P>
<P> It is not a difficult story to tell. Isa and Marie meet at a deadend job
and they strike up a friendship, and Isa ends up sharing the place that
Marie is house sitting for a period of time. As much as they seem to become
friends, there are way too many differences between them, and no sooner do
they begin living under the same roof that things begin to take off.</P>
<P> Like many French films, this one is also extremely dependant on the
dialogue. The old saying that French pictures are too talky is still true
here, but in this case, it is hard to do without it, and little in the
dialogue between the two women seems to be wasted. The chemistry, when
things start to go wrong is fiery and so explosive that we may get
exasperated wondering how is this all going to end.</P>
<P> For reasons that are not really clear, but just happen, Isa begins getting
interested in the people that lived in the apartment, the mother having died
and the daughter in a coma. Isa's curiosity finds many things that come to
interest her, specially the diary of the girl. Isa decides to visit the girl
in the hospital, and eventually the film gives us the indication that it was
Isa's care and interest that helped the girl in a coma improve.</P>
<P> While this is happening, Marie is entering into a very abusive relationship
that is not helping things. She is becoming hopelessly in love with a guy
that she knows does not care about him, but he is learning to enjoy herself
with him, and this may be the one thing that will break her inner anger and
loosen her satisfaction. Her happiest moments are towards the end of the
film, when she has her high hopes and it appears that things are improving.
But her choice of a man, is a bad one, and it leads to a very sad end.
Amidst the two ladies, is a pair of bikers, one of which comes to like
Marie, but unfortunately she is pretty indifferent to him, and eventually he
sadly has to let her go. They work as bouncers and tour with a band, the
distance of which is rather difficult for Marie. Isa, maintains her
independence, and never gives in to a relationship, with the exception of
her curiosity and attention to the girl in a coma. If Isa's inner need is
one of sharing affection and giving it away, Marie's is the needy one who
must have the affection that she needs to tame her indomitable spirit.</P>
<P> And the film allows the two ladies to really tear up the screen with some
amazing acting fireworks. Marie has a temper. But Isa, will not back down at
all, and she maintains her own sense of self and independence. Strength,
even if she can not define it, is not something that she lacks. But she at
least has enough sense not to get involved in a relationship that has sex in
it, probably because she is guarding her own emotional state. Her appearance
is not clear, but we have the sense that she just came off a relationship
that left her guarded and protective of her space.</P>
<P> The largest merit in this film is without a doubt the interplay between the
two ladies, who make the film move forward. It's the redeeming factor in
this film. Acting does not come any better than this, and the way that
things are shot around them is actually pretty well done, considering that
fiery acting work not done at a distance is not always advisable. In this
film, the directorial choice to go ahead and stay near them, is a
magnificent add on to the two characterizations that these women develop.</P>
<P> Probably the downside of the film is its rather downtrodden ending,
suggesting that Marie and Isa are not the only two women that are alone and
unsatisfied in this world. The panning camera looking at other faces
immediately seems to suggest that any one of these could be another Marie,
or Isa. This, in of itself, is more than likely a statement about what the
country is making of people as workers than womanhood itself, but it really
is a sad end, compounding a sad end already.</P>
