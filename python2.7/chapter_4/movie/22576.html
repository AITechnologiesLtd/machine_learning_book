<P>`The Talented Mr. Ripley' is an offbeat addition to the Holiday movie
schedule - perhaps the most unlikely contender of the Christmas season.
In his follow-up to `The English Patient', director Anthony Minghella
appears to be channeling Alfred Hitchcock, as everything is executed
with a certain style and sophistication that seems reminiscent of the
late director's best work. If he were still alive today, it wouldn't
surprise me if Mr. Hitchcock would blush at the sight of Minghella's
latest offering; `The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a finely oiled suspense
machine crammed with a thorough sense of fascination.</P>
<P>The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, which was previously
adapted to the silver screen in 1960 under the name of `Purple Moon', a
film which won critical acclaim for it's intricate and unsettling study
of an unstable but highly intelligent sociopath named Tom Ripley. In
Minghella's version, Matt Damon inherits the icy title role with plenty
of chilling results. Although I haven't read Highsmith's novel, many
sources are indicating that the new version of Tom Ripley is portrayed
with far more innocence than the previous one....shaping the modern
Ripley into an unwilling murderer who only kills as a last resort. This
approach opens a wide canvas for mystery and intrigue, and Damon's
frightening metamorphosis into the main character is a masterful balance
of sinister charm and brilliant intuition.</P>
<P>Ripley, a curious dreamer and master chameleon, is persuaded by the
wealthy Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to travel to Italy and
retrieve his son Dickie (Jude Law) so he can return home and see the
family. Once he arrives at his destination, Tom is swept away by
Dickie's lifestyle: his dashing fiancee Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), his
friends, his social stature... It is safe to say Tom is more than
slightly intrigued by the notion of living Dickie's life for him. And
that brings us to this little snippet of dialogue, spoken by Tom in a
moment of quiet revelation: `I always thought it would be better to be a
fake somebody than a real nobody.'</P>
<P>`The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a rich and unsettling tapestry of murder
and suspense that is neither predictable nor formulaic - a rarity for
the thriller genre, which makes for a delectable Christmas treat.
Minghella's film is, in terms of artistic beauty and emotional craft,
one the finest films of the year. Taking a page from Hitchcock classics
like `Psycho' and `North by Northwest', it offers a fascinating and
jarring character study that extends generously to each of the three
leads - with Damon carrying the most demanding load and delivering
superbly. Jude Law (`eXistenZ' and `Gattaca') also delivers an
Award-caliber performance as the spoiled playboy Dickie Greenleaf, and
Paltrow, while not emitting the vigorous radiance of her performance in
`Shakespeare in Love', proves to a competent piece of the twisted
puzzle. In support, both Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Dickie's smug and
contemptuous playboy buddy) and Cate Blanchett (as Tom's awkward love
interest) are solid, but the former is able to ignite more screen
charisma. Philip Baker Hall has a brief but effective appearance as an
American detective hired to connect the dots of a few gruesome murders.</P>
<P>The question of Tom's sexual preferences occasionally hangs over the
proceedings like a dour cloud of smog. There is much indication of
sexual friction between Tom and Dickie (and afterward another male
character), and although they are sometimes excessive and unnecessary,
these details only help to further establish the nature of Tom's
character. I may argue that the film is also slightly overlong, but
Minghella finishes on a particularly haunting note. `The Talented Mr.
Ripley' is full of gorgeous locales, effective imagery and subtle but
nerve-jangling suspense. It's the definition of a smart man's thriller,
and if Hitch were around to see it, I'm sure he would be envious.</P>
