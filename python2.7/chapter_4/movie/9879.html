Devil's Advocate (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 24 October 1997 with Lynne and Sandy for $8 at the Squire Cinemas,
Great Neck, NY</P>
<P>It was not too difficult to imagine, based on the commercials, to think
that Devil's Advocate was going to be crap. Seeing Al Pacino boiling Holy
Water with a single finger, who wouldn't? Happily, I wound up seeing one
of the more satisfying commercial vehicles of the year. It is not as
subtle as Rosemary's Baby, but is much more safisfying and sophisticated
than the classic Devil and Daniel Webster.</P>
<P>Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a prosecutor turned criminal lawyer who has
never lost a case on either end of the spectrum, who lives with his
devoted wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron) in Florida. After ensuring the
freedom of his client--a pedophile junior high school teacher--he is
approached by a representative from a high-profile law firm in New York.
They offer everything--first class transportation, a huge salary, an
eight-room apartment in the posh Carnegie Hill neighborhood near Central
Park.  </P>
<P>In fact, isn't it a little weird that the entire building is inhabited by
members of the law fim? Boss John Milton has the penthouse atop the
spooky, urban haunted house. While Kevin thrives in the high-pressure
atmosphere and passes the tests before  him, his hitherto happy wife has
her reservations. She doesn't quite like being left on her own, shopping
wih the superficial, creepy wifes of the other associates, and wondering
if Kevin is sleeping with the slinky Christabella (Connie Neilsen). She
doesn't quite like her nightmares either--and neither will you. During a
visit, Kevin' Bible-quoting mother notices how poorly Mary Ann is doing;
Kevin does not.</P>
<P>Al Pacino's performance as John Milton (a/k/a The Devil) changes the whole
tone of the film whenever he appears on screen. The movie is well written,
but it seems especially well written for him. Larger than life (as Satan
should be, I guess), it is a joy to see his eyes and face light up
whenever he appears, whether he is luring Kevin into temptation, or
confronting a hooligan on the subway (the only way he will travel).</P>
<P>It is also gratifying to watch a basic morality story that does not hit
you over the head over and over again. Obviously the temptations offered
are evil, but watching how Kevin reacts to them, rationalizing them, helps
keep the film nicely paced. Like Young Goodman Brown, Kevin too will see
demons  everywhere.</P>
<P>Brava to Roberta J. Holinko, the set decorator. Milton's office and
apartment are as wide as widescreen will allow, and decorated appropriate
to his satanic position. Devil's Advocate shows a lush superrich side of
New York most people do not see, like the courtrooms with WPA murals, or
high-rise apartments with gilts wall and ceilings and spectacular views,
or offices that have Manhattan at your feet. A lot of churches appear in
this movie too, some of the most beautiful, cavernous ones Manhattan has
to offer. Yet, there is always a firey glow somewhere in the distance, or
down a hallway, to remind you what road you are on, even if the best
intentions are propelling you. </P>
<P>All of this is so enjoyable, the ending(s) sort of take the wind out of
you as they hit you repeatedly over the head. There are other ways I would
have ended the movie. If you would like to know, email me and I will tell
you (<A HREF="mailto:sethbook@panix.com">sethbook@panix.com</A>).</P>
