<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A very solid crime thriller shot in semi-documentary style. Its story is of the
formulaic kind, but because it was so smoothly executed and the pace was so
fluid the episodic saga had a natural flow to it. Under the very able direction
of Joseph H. Lewis, the action scenes are brought about with the tension always
building. Its story is about a team of Federal Treasury agents in Chi town going
after the Big Fellow, who is undoubtably supposed to be a clone of Al Capone. </P>
<P>One honest top brass policeman says: The guy kills hundreds of people every year
and we can't convict him, but three bookkeepers go after him on income tax
evasion and expect to nail him for that. Because of the film's dark mood it sets
and that the killers can't be linked with their violent crimes, the film has the
feel of noir. </P>
<P>The team of undercover Special Agents working for the Internal Revenue Service
are headed by veteran Frank Warren (Glenn Ford), who feels guilty that he's away
long stretches from his loving farm girl wife, Judith (Foch), and he tries to
see her as much as he can between undercover assignments. The other two team
members are equally as dedicated: there's the bachelor George Pappas (Whitmore),
who craves the action and  the dedicated family man, Stan Weinburg (Wolfe), who
does the tedious tasks required to nab the criminals. </P>
<P>The film opens as a mob bookkeeper named Zanger (Osterloh), plans on testifying
against the syndicate because of the hefty reward promised. But he's rubbed out
before he can give them useful information. </P>
<P>After much leg work and little to show for their effort the agents continue to
harass the crime bosses, but the gangsters are quickly released as the
syndicate's shyster lawyer O'Rourke (Kelley) springs them as soon as they're
booked. </P>
<P>Their big break comes when a disgruntled bookkeeper, Salvatore Rocco (Caruso),
willing to take the risk in order to live comfortably with his mistress, agrees
to testify. But he's gunned down in broad daylight on a busy street as his
daughter Rosa (Lazer) watches. </P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow. </PRE>
<P>But the agents get the signatures of all those doing the books for the syndicate
when they had them arrested, as they compare their signatures with those on the
dummy accounts opened to avoid paying taxes. With that evidence, they arrest the
Mob's chief bookkeeper, Sidney Gordon (Penn-he's the father of Sean and
Christopher Penn). He agrees to testify for immunity and protection, and Rosa
brings the agents the book her father kept hidden that will help convict the Big
Fellow on tax evasion. Which leads to the exciting climax, where O'Rourke tries
to sell his old pals in the syndicate out to avoid jail time. They pay him back
by bumping him off, but not before he warns the agents that the jury has been
tampered with. As a result, with a new jury the Big Fellow is brought to trial
and put away for twenty years. </P>
