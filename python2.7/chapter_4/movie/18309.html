<PRE>A SIMPLE PLAN
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Crime doesn't pay.  Particularly in a world where the rule of Murphy's
Law is absolute.  That's the lesson learned by the characters in  the
well-acted, brilliantly written and intensely gripping drama, A Simple
Plan.</P>
<P>Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton) has a good, if not perfect, life.  He has a
decent job, a loving wife (Bridget Fonda), and a baby on the way.  But
all of that is about to change.</P>
<P>One day Hank, his dimwitted brother, Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), and
Jacob's dimwitted drinking buddy, Lou (Brent Briscoe), make an
interesting discovery in the woods:  a crashed plane containing over $4
million in presumably dirty money.</P>
<P>After some minor deliberation, the three men tentatively decide to keep
the money.  And, wouldn't you know it, things invariably start to go
wrong.  As the walls start to close in, the men must not only struggle
to keep their stories straight, but also face the pressures of greed and
doubt which tempt them to turn against one another.</P>
<P>Director Sam Raimi, best known for his Evil Dead films, at first seems
an unlikely choice to direct this much more traditional, character
oriented thriller.  However, here he shows a mastery of the subtle
touch.  He is able to create a tangible atmosphere of unease as what
seemed to be a simple plan grows more and more convoluted over time.</P>
<P>The story of A Simple Plan, adapted from Scott B. Smith's novel, is well
constructed.  The many twists and turns throughout the film are
reasonable, yet unexpected.  The characters are strongly written as
well.  You get the sense that all of the characters here are constantly
thinking (even though it's an activity that not all of them do well).</P>
<P>Billy Bob Thornton turns in yet another brilliant performance as the
pathetic Jacob.  Though there are some similarities between this role
and his performance of Karl in Slingblade, he manages to make Jacob a
unique creation that stands on his own. At first, Jacob is seemingly
just a dim bulb...but there's much more to this character than what
first appears.</P>
<P>Billy Bob Thornton isn't the only one here who can act...and this
picture is full of examples.  Bridget Fonda deserves kudos for her sharp
portrayal of perhaps the craftiest character in the film.  Bill Paxton
does an excellent job as the desperate everyman.  And Gary Cole delivers
a good turn as Baxter, an FBI agent who is hunting down the lost plane.</P>
<P>With a fascinating screenplay, masterful direction, and excellent
performances, A Simple Plan is a truly suspenseful drama,  and one of
the year's best films.</P>
