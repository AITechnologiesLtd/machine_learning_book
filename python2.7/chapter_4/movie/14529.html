<P>As the slasher/horror-genre revival takes the film world by storm,
filmmakers are gravitating toward the quantity-over-quality maxim. Along
with earlier-this-year's DISTURBING BEHAVIOR, the latest entry into the
neo-category is a quickly-crafted mix of script, character, and
atmosphere. In directing her debut feature, Jamie Blanks attempts to
take URBAN LEGEND down a path that hasn't been done before. The title
shows it - she's going to make use of those pop campfire scare stories -
but in the process of trying to fit everything in she falls back on
cliché and gimmick to the point where it reflects badly on other films
of the type. </P>
<P>Granted, the urban legends make things interesting intially, but for the
most part this is simply novelty. Everyone knows most of these stories
by one version or another, and the popularity is undeniable, but by the
end they're just a tired gimmick. Even that might work, but in order to
substantiate this, the script calls upon recent trademarks. How many
people in the same small town have the same fur-lined parka (a la the
raincoat in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER)? Or who brought the gun
into the final scene so that the killer could get offed at least three
times a la SCREAM? And that escape route by foot through the woods -
why, that wouldn't be from DISTURBING BEHAVIOR, would it? The bottom
line is that everything included here is definitely not of orginal make
or model. </P>
<P>The center of the cast is a group of four or five teens we've all seen
before. Alicia Witt (TV's CYBILL) is no different from the Jennifer Love
Hewitts and Neve Campbells of Gen-X fame, and she does all right - minus
a bit of inspiration. Her college student world is rocked one night when
news of the gruesome death of a friend reaches campus. Suddenly other
friends start turning up dead (Joshua Jackson, Danielle Harris), and all
suffer death in the same fashion as one of the urban legends. The cast
is narrowed down to only the smart and the quick, and, of course, they
have their fallings-out and childish moments of paranoia. Nothing we
haven't seen, but not to worry - it won't be long before the killer
strikes again. Thus the plot. </P>
<P>The only reason we don't confuse this with parody is because Jamie
Blanks makes to spice up her movie with murders grotesque and graphic to
the extreme. URBAN LEGEND is perhaps the first movie to enter the
no-holds-barred arena of slasher movies, and the only purpose it serves
is to turn the audience against the killer. After a string of nine or
ten gruesome deaths, the audience cares more about how the killer will
die rather than who he actually is. And in this case, when the
impossible identity is revealed, no one bats an eye - which could lead
one to believe that Blanks was counting on the ignorance of her
audience. Most of URBAN LEGEND follows in suit: a typical 90's horror
movie. And though the crowds will flock to the theaters on opening
weekend, you don't have to be among them.</P>
