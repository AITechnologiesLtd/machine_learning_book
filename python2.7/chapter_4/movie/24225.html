<PRE>In Brief -- by Zachary McGhee</PRE>
<P>28 DAYS [Thomas] -- Solid, well-balanced dramedy has more than its share
of melodrama, but Bullock makes it work, even so much that two scenes in
particular had me in tears. No, not the boo-hooing of teenage girls
sitting through Titanic, mind you, just a bit teary-eyed. B</P>
