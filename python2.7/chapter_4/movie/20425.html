<P> Dubbed in English from Japanese. Not Rated (Would be a strong R or an
NC-17).</P>
<P>For those who do not know, "anime" is a Japanese form of animation. It
has a very distinctive style and, with graphic violence and often
nudity, it's strictly for adults. Perfect Blue is one of the few animes
released on the big screen in the US and why they chose this one is
beyond me. It's an intriguing but pretentious, confusing, often
incoherent meditation on the nature of reality: a concept that has been
explored so thoroughly in Hollywood the past couple years, did we really
need to import a movie about it?</P>
<P>Perfect Blue tells the story of Mima, a lead singer for a pop group
named "Cham" who decides to leave music for an acting career. Her first
television role does not exactly fit in with her previous perky persona.
In fact, her deeply troubled character resembles herself all too well;
so much so that she begins to confuse her life with that of her
television counterpart.</P>
<P>One day she finds a page on the internet entitled "Mima's Room". It has
too much personal information: things other people wouldn't know unless
they were watching her. At the same time, she begins getting anonymous
letters -- one of them complete with a letter bomb -- and she grows
frightened. Soon the stress of her job overwhelms her and she spaces out
of reality. She is no longer able to separate the dream world from the
real world and is haunted by visions of her pop-star alter ego and a
mysterious man who seems intent on doing her harm.</P>
<P>After running it over in my head for hours, I am now pretty sure that I
understand just what went on in Perfect Blue, but as I was watching I
had no idea. This may have been the effect that director Satoshi Kon was
going for, but either way it doesn't work; instead of enjoying the
kinetic, visually charged production I was scratching my head. I have no
problem with films that are, by their very nature, complex, but it's no
fun when it gets to the point of being impossible to follow.</P>
<P>I understand that translating a film into English from another language
is a daunting task, but when said film has pretentions of being a
legitimate psychological thriller, its dialogue should not sound as if
it was written by a third-grader. Here, the content does indeed suggest
an adult suspenser but the dialogue seems to have come from The Iron
Giant (especially botched is a scene where Mima is taught to use the
internet: it comes like an extraordinarily bad commercial for an online
service).</P>
<P>Well-made action sequences and a terrific, powerful soundtrack almost
redeem this sloppy, incoherent movie. One of the reasons I love
animation is that it makes it easy for filmmakers to stage long,
complicated scenes that would be very difficult (i.e. expensive) to do
when bound by the limits of the real world. Perfect Blue takes full
advantage of this wonderful medium. The drawings themselves are fluid
and realistic while the things they do with the drawings are amazing.</P>
<P>The film does look great, but my rating would have been at least a star
higher had director Satoshi Kon paid a little less attention to the
visuals and a more to narrative cohesion. I am a sucker for "what-is-
reality" movies; even the otherwise lambasted The Thirteenth Floor eked
out a 3-star rating from me. I definitely find the premise of Perfect
Blue to be brimming with potential. Too bad the film disrupted my idea
of reality with its mediocrity.
