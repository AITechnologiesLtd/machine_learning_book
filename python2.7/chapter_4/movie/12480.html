The Horse Whisperer (PG-13) * 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a sucker for a good romantic weepie.
Pop 1996's The Bridges of Madison County into the VCR, and by the time a
rainsoaked Clint Eastwood casts a final heartbroken gaze at Meryl Streep,
in all likelihood you'll find me a blubbering mess (go ahead and laugh).
Not surprisingly, the long-delayed The Horse Whisperer is being positioned
as this year's Bridges: it also boasts a high-profile director-star (here,
Robert Redford), and it, too, is based on a bestselling love story by a
first-time author (Nicholas Evans in this case).  But only true suckers
will fall for this overlong, slow, and self-indulgent bore, which is not
only short on tears, but romance as well.</P>
<P>Never mind that it takes a hard-to-swallow plot contrivance to get the
ball rolling.  A violent horseriding accident severely injures 14-year-old
Grace McLean (Scarlett Johansson, in a role originally intended for Natalie
Portman) and kills her best friend Judith (Catherine Bosworth).  Also
shaken up in the accident is Grace's beloved horse Pilgrim.  Although
everyone says the best treatment for Pilgrim is a bullet, Grace's ballsy
magazine editor mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas) throws all caution and
good advice to the wind and takes Grace, who now wears a prosthesis where
her amputated right leg used to be, and Pilgrim on a road trip to Montana
to meet one Tom Booker (Redford).  Tom is a "horse whisperer," who
specializes in treating "horses with people problems"--a category under
which the once-gentle, now-irritable Pilgrim clearly falls.</P>
<P>It takes well over an hour before the inevitable "romance" between uptight
Annie and laidback Tom begins.  I place the term in quotes because what
develops only qualifies under the vaguest, most academic definition.  Tom
and Annie go horseback riding once, and suddenly they long for each
other--or rather, Annie longs for Tom, because Redford's stiff performance
offers no convincing insight into what Tom feels.  Redford had once vowed
to never direct himself in a film; based on his wooden work here, he should
have held to that promise.  Scott Thomas is a proven master at conveying
soul-aching longing (witness The English Patient) but she is at the mercy
of Redford (the actor and director) and scripters Eric Roth and Richard
LaGravanese (the latter of whom penned the terrific Bridges script).  I
couldn't feel for Annie since I couldn't understand why she would prefer
Tom over her straight-arrow but generally understanding husband Robert (Sam
Neill); her motivation is also sketchily developed, and as such the
forbidden "love" feels like a scripted development and not a natural one.</P>
<P>Not that Redford seems terribly concerned with the romance, which is
supposed to drive this story and serve as the emotional hook.  Redford
appears more content with crafting a valentine to the equine--and to his
own virility.  The Horse Whisperer is dominated by two images: horses
running wild and free and Tom, twirling his lasso in slow motion.  By the
time Tom is exerting his cool yet caring authority over other ranch animals
(in slow motion, of course), the point is abundantly clear--Tom is one
strapping cowpoke.  But Redford insists on drilling this point into the
audience's heads over and over and over again, at the clear expense of the
romance.  I'd say that three-fourths of the film's bloated
two-hour-and-forty-four minute running time is devoted to Tom and the
horses, with a fourth of that remaining fourth devoted to the supposed
"passion" between Tom and Annie:  They indulge in a couple of stolen kisses
(during a most incomprehensible doozy of an exchange--Annie: "I want to
know something."  Kiss.  Tom: "Are you sure?"  Kiss.  Annie: "I have to
go."  What the--?!); they share a romantic barroom dance; she cries--that's
it.  Oh, lest I forget Tom's oh-so-heartwrenching declaration of love,
delivered by Redford with all the expressiveness of a brick: "I didn't plan
on loving you.  But I do."  Really?  Could have fooled me...</P>
<P>The Horse Whisperer is not without its virtues.  Robert Richardson's
photography captures the Montana landscapes in all their breathtaking
majesty; Thomas Newman's score is lilting and evocative; Johansson is
terrific, creating the sole character that makes any connection with the
audience; and the opening accident scene has a disturbing intensity.  But
the scant good lies at the periphery of a deep, gaping void.  The
handsomely produced Horse Whisperer is not the flat-out cinematic
catastrophe that another recent actor-director effort, Kevin Costner's
notorious The Postman, was, but for swoony fans of movie love stories, this
uninteresting, uninvolving viewing chore might as well be.  There won't be
a damp eye in the house.</P>

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
