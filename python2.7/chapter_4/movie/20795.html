<P>Affliction is a riveting piece of entertainment on all respective
levels. The acting is extraordinary, the story is captivating and the
atmosphere is chilling and effective. While there are numerous sub-plots
about family confrontations and small-town murder, Affliction is really
only about one man who is being pushed over the edge.</P>
<P>That man is Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte), a small-town sheriff and
divorced father, who is living a complicated and frustrating life in the
snow covered surroundings of New Hampshire. The first half of the story
rotates largely around Wade's best friend Jack Hewitt (Jim True), who
accompanies a business man on a hunting expedition only to witness him
shoot himself. While Jack stresses it was just a freak hunting accident,
Wade thinks there is something more to it. And so he uncovers a possible
conspiracy involving his boss (Holmes Osborne), and the victim's
son-in-law.</P>
<P>But Affliction is, by no means, a murder mystery. The real emotional
charge comes care of Wade's relationship with his drunken, abusive
father (marvelously played by James Coburn). Director Paul Schrader
(veteran scribe of such films as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver) uses
flashbacks to introduce us to the Whitehouse family problems, and this
approach is incredibly effective, especially on the basis of visual
presentation. Schrader presents the footage in a fuzzy, worn appearance,
much like an old home video filmed with the picture out of focus. Some
people may find this tedious, but the effect is profoundly striking.</P>
<P>Affliction turns into Wade's incomparable struggle to come to grips with
everything in his life. He's fighting a custody battle with his ex-wife
(Mary Beth Hurt) for his daughter he cares for but can't rightfully
support, the appearance of his father puts an awkwardness on his current
relationship with local waitress Maggie Fogg (Sissy Spacek), and on top
of it all he has an incredible toothache. Wade Whitehouse is a troubled
human being living a turbulent life, and some may find it difficult to
watch as it spirals out of control.</P>
<P>The standout reason to see Affliction is the incredible performances.
While Coburn's performance is phenomenal and downright chilling, it's
Nolte who owns the screen. This is the breakout performances of the
actor's career, and he leaves no margin for error in his portrayal of
the troubled sheriff. His performance is commanding and immensely
powerful. I also found much to like in the performance of Willem Dafoe
as Wade's younger, more civilized brother. Dafoe's presentation is
initially limp, but we come to relate to his quiet and dignified
character. Schrader uses Dafoe as a voice-over narrative in sporadic
instances, but doesn't go overboard. The director knows his actors are
competent enough to set the point across themselves, and rarely relies
on this familiar narration approach.</P>
<P>Nick Nolte has taken to his role as Wade Whitehouse like a bull by the
horns, and the riveting outcome of the movie is directly because of his
amazing performance. While James Coburn won an Oscar for his role (and
rightfully so), Affliction should always be remembered as Nolte's movie.
For the first time in years, the actor's fierce aggression on screen
does not seem forced, not even marginally. His character is so
overwrought with paranoia, family issues and business problems and
Nolte's delivery seems completely and utterly perfect. While the ending
of Affliction is rather simplistic, it creates a shocking final effect
that hits right at home in the heart of the viewers, like a single brick
landing with a resounding ‘thud' at your feet. The snowy November
weather only assists as Affliction, a startling character drama with a
superb cast, succeeds in stopping your blood cold.</P>
