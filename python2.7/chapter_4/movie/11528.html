AS GOOD AS IT GETS
(TRI-STAR)
RUNNING TIME: 138 MINUTES (2 hours 18 minutes)
 STARRING JACK NICHOLSON, HELEN HUNT AND GREG KINNEAR
 DIRECTED BY JAMES L. BROOKS</PRE>
<P>James L. Brooks, one of the developers of The Simpsons and director of
Broadcast News, returns to the big screen with this entertaining, if
slightly flawed comedy. Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, probably the
most horrible person ever on the screen. He's racist, homophobic, and
never has a good word to say to anyone. So, nobody talks to him,
except waitress Carol Conelly (T.V sitcom star Hunt, who was last seen
in Twister, 1996).  Naturally, Udall, Conelly and gay neighbor Simon
Bishop (Kinnear) who Nicholson hates, all hit it off in the end.</P>
<P>Like Good Will Hunting (1997) and Titanic (1997), even though the
outcome is completely obvious, As Good As It Gets is an enjoyable,
funny and warm comedy. Nicholson is hilarious as Melvin, churning out
insults with superb relish. Only Nicholson could get away with the
lines that Melvin delivers. Hunt is also good as waitress Carol, and
easily rises to the challenge of Nicholson. There's also (thankfully)
a bit of chemistry between them.  Kinnear, as the gay neighbor, seems
to have a slightly underwritten role, he's more of a plot convience
than a character. Although his performance is good, his character just
seems to exist to help Melvin and Carol come together. In fact, the
scene stealer is Simon's dog, who is funnier than Nicholson. But then
again, pets are always cute on screen.</P>
<P>Providing solid support is Cuba Gooding, Jnr (Jerry Maguire, 1996) and
Yeardly Smith (who is the voice of Lisa Simpsons in The Simpsons)
Although Gooding isn't as good as is character in Maguire, he is still
fun. He overacts a little, but not so much as to be annoying. Smith is
also good, although she has a fairly small role.  Even director
Lawrence Kasdan (Body Heat, 1981) makes an appearance as a doctor.</P>
<P>But this is primarily Nicholsons film, and every scene he's in, he's
steals it. He's character is so hateful, though, it's amazing that
anyone talks to him at all, especially Carol. And this is the films
main problem. It's totally unbelievable that Carol would ever consider
liking Melvin. She doesn't fall in love with him naturally, the film
forces her to fall in love with him. Also, Melvins character seems to
go too nice, too quickly. I would doubt anyone with a character like
Melvins would be able to turn back to a nice, loving person. It would
take a helluva long time, much longer than this film would like to
make out. Brooks direction is good, though, if a bit average, but he
usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience. He handles the
comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones (he tends to pile on to
much schmaltz) but generally he's good. There's also a nice soundtrack
by veteran composer Hans Zimmer.</P>
<P>But, generally, As Good As It Gets achieves what it sets out to do,
which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie. The
movie is a bit overlong, but Nicholson is such good fun that the
running time passes by pretty quickly. Overall, As Good As It Gets is
a fun movie, even though it may be unbelivable, and certainly worth
seeing (if just for Jack Nicholsons performance.) Not quite As Good As
It Gets (pardon the bad joke), but still good fun.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING: ***1/2 OUT OF *****
