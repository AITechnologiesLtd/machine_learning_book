<P>   One of the lines in "The Mighty," if taken and analyzed
seriously, could actually subvert the entire film industry, as
well as theater and TV.  "Every word is a part of a picture,"
the 13-year-old Kevin Dillon (Kieran Culkin) teaches his co-
eval pupil Maxwell Kane (Elden Henson).  "You just connect
them together," he concludes.  In other words, why spend
time in a movie theater or your hard-earned money on
Broadway shows?  The stage is in your mind, where you can
produce, act, and direct in some of the most highly-charged
dramas ever made.  Try to tell this to the upcoming
generation, many of whom will be crowding the movie houses
to see the show helmed by Peter Chelsom based on a
screenplay by Charles Leavitt--which in turn comes from the
novel "Freak the Mighty" by Rodman Philbrick.  When they
emerge from the theater, they may talk the talk but will they
read the book?</P>
<P>   "The Mighty" is the story of a friendship involving two boys,
one instructing the other in the wonderful attributes of books,
the other providing the legs and the physical might to allow
him to continue doing so despite the threat of neighborhood
toughs.  If you've ever felt like an outsider, as one who
cannot enter the inner chambers of a clique or have even a
best friend, you may connect with this tale of a symbiotic
relationship of two lads, each providing something of what's
missing in the other.  Otherwise, though the film has already
received glowing praise as "one of the best family films of the
decade"(by critic James Berardinelli) and "a classic" (by the
New York Press reviewer Armond White), it's just passable 
fare.  "The Mighty" is the sort of story recommended for
junior-high book lists under the genre "handicapping
conditions" or of the "uplifting, you-can-do-anything-you-want" 
category.  It is well acted, particularly by Sharon Stone in the
role of the mother you wish you had, and Kieran Culkin as
boy small in stature, great in mind, and tragically ill-fated with
Morquios' syndrome--a progressive, degenerative disease
which has crippled him and rendered him unable to walk
without braces.  Elden Henson provides solid support as a
hefty guy who, like the dinosaurs of which his mentor speaks
has a brain the size of a walnut.  Both are the butt of jokes
from their mates in a Cincinnati junior high school, who are of
an age not particularly known for diplomacy or compassion.</P>
<P>   Filmed in Toronto and Cincinnati with brief episodes
coming straight from the imagination of the principals, "The
Mighty" opens on the hulking Max who has been left back in
seventh grade twice and is consequently picked on by the
smaller and younger kids in his class.  A gentle creature by
nature, he provokes the taunts of a school gang knows as the
doghouse boys, who are led by one Blade (Joe Perrino), a
kid who looks more like the newspaper boy next door than a
knife-wielding mugger.  So intolerant is Blade and his young
heathens that they stoop to tripping the crippled Kevin by
throwing a basketball at his legs.  The team of Kevin and
Max becomes inevitable, two against the world, and they
march through the neighborhood with Kevin riding on Max's
back as though they were Don Quixote and Rocinante. 
When Kevin is not firing up Max's imagination with tales of
King Arthur and regaling him with the vocabulary of medieval
days, he joins him in a series of feudal-style adventures,
rescuing one damsel in distress, recovering lost gold in a rat-
infested sewer, and avoiding their enemies by exploiting the
shelter of a muddy moat.</P>
<P>   With Harry Dean Stanton and Gena Rowlands as Max's
understanding grandparents and Sharon Stone as the
wonderfully supportive mother of the afflicted Kevin, "The
Mighty" evokes some sentiment but goes far off the track
when infusing a kidnapping scene involving Max's jailbird
father (James Gandolfini), who was incarcerated for killing
Kevin's mom.</P>
<P>   The sharpest dialogue is reserved for Kevin, whose
debilitating disease has forced him to spend a good deal of
his time in his imagination, using the legend of King Arthur as
his Bible.  Inevitably, of course, the tragedy which strikes one
of the boys will cause great pain in the other, who will keep
memory alive by becoming all he can be.  "The Mighty"
features good chemistry between its two unlikely principals,
but as a narrative it's an unexceptional buddy film.</P>
