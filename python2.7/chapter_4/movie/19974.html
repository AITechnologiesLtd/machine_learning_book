<PRE>_Leila_ *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>This subtle and thought-provoking drama from Iran tells the modern-day
story of the title character (Leila Hatami), a young newlywed who forces
her very loving husband Reza (Ali Mosaffa) to take another wife after she
learns she cannot bear children.  The decision, however, is not so much
hers as it is that of her manipulative and selfish mother-in-law (Jamileh
Sheikhi), who plants seeds of doubt in Leila regarding Reza's love and
loyalty; and that of society in general.</P>
<P>Dariush Mehrjui's film may end on a (forced) bittersweet note, but it is
overall a film of great sadness, the tragedy of a love torn apart by each
partner's overeagerness to please the other.  While the relationship
between Leila and Reza is the film's focus, the film belongs to Leila,
beautifully played with great understatement by Hatami.  Her despair and
desperation dominates the film, and the audience feels it quite
intimately--due not only to Hatami's extraordinary work but that of
Mehrjui, who wisely never strays from Leila's point of view, enabling the
viewer to experience her uncertainty and resulting confusion.  </P>
