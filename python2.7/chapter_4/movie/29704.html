<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An unspectacular true story (it's dated) about a prison break that is told in a
semi-documentary style. Its saving grace is that it is well presented. There are
twelve hardened convicts who break out from the State Prison of Canon City,
Colorado, on the Christmas Eve of December 30, 1947. The prison's real warden,
Roy Best plays himself and takes us on a tour of his facility, which the film
used for its authentic location. The town is a typical old mining town that is
situated in a mountainous region in a canyon and has a population of 7,000. </P>
<P>A prisoner serving 12 years already for murder since he was 17, Jim Sherbondy
(Scott Brady), but hoping to be paroled sometime in the next ten years, is
coerced into joining a prison escape because he works in the dark room as a
photographer and they need him to  store their hand-made weapons in that
facility. </P>
<P>The men, the most dangerous prisoners in the facility, jump the wall and flee
across the snow-covered roads. They hold a farmer's family hostage, but soon a
large manhunt is on the way and two are immediately killed and all the others
are apprehended within 61 hours; that is, all but Sherbondy. </P>
<P>He holds the Bauer family hostage with a gun, but when her young son has an
appendicitis attack Sherbondy allows Mrs. Bauer to drive her son to a hospital
in Pueblo City in order to save his life. Mr. Bauer appreciates what the convict
did and gives him a ride when Sherbondy tries to flee on foot. But at a police
roadblock he's captured. </P>
<P>This minor work has some resemblance to film noir through the characterization
of Sherbondy as someone who is not a hardened criminal, but got into trouble
both on the outside and then inside of prison because he made the wrong friends.
It is narrated in a serious tone by Reed Hadley. </P>
