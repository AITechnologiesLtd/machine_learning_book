<PRE>The Assignment</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Christian Duguay</PRE>
<P>Written by Dan Gordon and Sabi H. Shabtai</P>
<P>Starring Adian Quinn, Donald Sutherland, Ben Kingsley, and Claudia Ferri</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> This is either a new high or a new low. Never before have I seen a movie
one night at 2:10 and reviewed it the next night at 11:49, albeit aided by a
massive overdose of caffeine. This could be viewed as one of two things: a
new level of obsessive behavior putting me right up there with Glenn Close
in Fatal Attraction for a textbook example of crazy, or, the more pleasant
alternative, a new level of commitment to my job combined with a chronic
case of insomnia.</P>
<PRE> I think its A, but you be the judge.</PRE>
<P> The movie I watched from 2:10 AM to 4:05 AM was The Assignment, one of two
movies that dealt with "The Jackal" in one way or another that came out in
1997. Although I don't especially think that I would have slept anyway, The
Assignment is not worth losing sleep over.</P>
<P> Yes, it is enjoyable, and yes, it is intelligent, but, for all of us who
have grown up with James Bond movies and Tom Clancy novels bringing in
millions (not to mention the endgame of the Cold War, in which intelligence
was the only thing actively fighting), it is the same old same old.</P>
<P> The plot of The Assignment is that you have a terrorist for hire named
Carlos (Aidan Quinn) who is on the run from every government in the world
except the Russians and the Libyans. Among the people who have an especially
good reason to kill him are Henry Fields (aka Jack Shaw) (Donald
Sutherland), who was there at one of his attacks in Paris and a Mosad agent
named Amos (Ben Kingsley) who has absolutely no character motivation
whatsoever.</P>
<P> Tricked into helping them is Lt. Cmd. Ramirez (Aidan Quinn), an exact look
alike of Carlos with a nuclear family living in Virginia. Ramirez is such a
very memorable character that someone told the imdb that his first name is
Annibal, which is, in fact, the first name of his wife (Claudia Ferri). As
for correcting it, I don't remember his name, either. The characters seem to
be pulled out of a damp storage room from back when espionage films were
chic.</P>
<P>    The plot is basically idiotic. The cinematography is impressive for an
espionage film, and we have a lot of fun watching Ramirez be trained to
become a super-spy.</P>
<P>     But the whole thing reeks of the stingy old films of the Cold War. I
was under the impression -and perhaps I am mistaken in this aspect - that
the Cold War was over and that we didn't have to put up with a punch of
stock-character enemies in parkas and fur hats being shot perfectly by
American idiots.</P>
<P>     The thing about The Assignment that you must understand, however, is
that, despite all of the above detriments to its cinematic value, it still
ends up being fun. Nowadays James Bond does nothing by cavort and crack
jokes, and the plots are all hackneyed and stupid.</P>
<P>    They may have all been that way, but ever since Pierce Brosnan got in on
the game, they stopped being so much damn fun. Tom Clancy, in his effort to
stay up to date, has become terribly essayistic in his novels and in their
adaptations. I mean, come on, how came out of Clear and Present Danger
wanting to purchase drugs just to spit in their face? Well, me neither, but
you get the point.</P>
<P>     The espionage genre took a massive turn for the worse after the Cold
War ended, and, despite the fact that we're back to square one where a super
agent man is slipping past customs in perfect disguises and getting the
Russians angry, it is still much better than the very unenjoyable modern day
espionage films.</P>
<P>     I'm in a quandary. On one hand, I try to recommend good films to you.
The Assignment is not a good film. On the other hand, I try to recommend
enjoyable films to you. The Assignment is enjoyable. It is up to you where
to go from here.</P>
