<P>     A lot of the reviews I read for Jackie Brown started to sound the same. 
 Too long, bringing back Pam Grier like Travolta, yada yada yada.  So I 
wrote my own thoughts down which I haven't had time to do in some time.  I 
cut through a lot of crap like re-telling the plot which you already know if 
you watched it.  Everyone said Jackie Brown was too long and self indulgent. 
Guess what - so is my criticism, read it or not!</P>
<P>     First off, Tarantino didn't have to cast Pam Grier for this role.  
There were no other options.  Pam Grier IS Jackie Brow. In my book it's a 
beautiful thing that Tarantino has written this role, better yet, this MOVIE 
for Pam Grier.  Altering Elmore Leonard's original title of "Rum Punch" 
(What's that mean any ways?) and Jackie's last name to more closely fit 
Grier's persona as the 70's biggest female blaxploitation star (Actually, 
Grier was one of the biggest box office draws of the 70's - period).  
Jackie's description could be Grier's - Strong but aging, black and 
beautiful, still working but having seen better days. Grier plays Jackie 
with above all - determination.  Like James Brown howled, "Got to get over, 
'fo we go under" - Grier and Jackie both get over magnificently.  Might as 
well stick to casting since the other characters DID have to be cast.  
Samuel Jackson as Ordell - excellent of course.  I've read some people say, 
"He's pretty much like Jules in Pulp Fiction".  No, he's not really much 
like Jules at all.  Jules Winfield was the real thing.  Ordell is a 
wannabee.  Unlike the real Macks with a whole stable of 'fly ho's' Ordell's 
has three - a stoner, a simpleton, and an chubby loon.  He put's on gloves 
like I used to do pretending to be David Hasslehoff in Knight Rider.  He 
wants to be important, a player... and that is why he must surround himself 
with the likes of Lewis, Beaumont, Melanie, Sheronda, and Simone - they are 
less bright than he and thus to him he's the Man. Ordell's character is a 
lot closer to the one Jackson played in John Paul Anderson's "Hard Eight"  - 
an up and comer who is pulling some strings, but can't close the bag (I'm 
speaking of the character of course, but the same might apply to Anderson). 
 Robert Forster as Max Cherry.  I'm unfortunately somewhat unfamiliar with 
Forster's 70's T.V. and B-Movies work.  Nevertheless, it was all the more 
surprise to see such a great performance from this 'unknown'.  Max Cherry IS 
a "Cherry" (Virgin) of sorts... I don't think we know if Max is single, 
divorced, or what, but it's obvious he has lived a calculated life somewhat 
removed from a more sexual or emotional existance... much too calculating to 
know what to do when he is smitten by Jackie Brown. Poor Max calculates 
until the very end, and as his time runs out he can't compute the options 
fast enough.  Forster plays Max with the all the restraint required as his 
prominent role could have been easily overplayed.   Keaton as the cop.  It 
works I guess.  In Tarantino's world cop's are generally a. White and B. 
Dorky and Keaton performs both with ease.  He's fairly on the ball, but he 
like Ordell, has a long way to go - if you want to BE the man, you gotta 
BEAT the man right?    Bridgette Fonda as Ordell's "Little Surfer Girl" 
Melanie. Perfect. Bridgette=Gidget?  Good to see her do something 
substantial, Singles and Bodies, Rest, and Motion seem like eons ago.  Maybe 
get a new agent?  Chris Tucker as the short lived Beaumont Livingston - just 
fine - Tucker is perhaps the blackest of the young black actors.  Easily 
black enough to hang with Jackson and Grier.  If Chris Rock hadn't 
overexposed himself and done so many goofy commercials perhaps he would have 
been the one getting in the trunk?  Last but not least - DeNiro as Lewis.  I 
had some problems with this.  I first thought, "DeNiro can't play such a 
looser!".  Then I thought.. "But he played two of the greatest losers in 
film history".  So what was the difference?  DeNiro before played sick, 
angry losers.  Here he is asked to simply to be a stupid, sad, looser in 
which some stupid, sad, looser should have been cast.  The role was beneath 
Bob, but DeNiro gives Lewis all he possibly can muster with such a limited 
task.  Ok, that's casting.  Tired yet?  Too bad.
     Now where?  Direction?  Tarantino's direction is a major break from his 
previous works.  While Tarantino is still quite indulgent with the camera, 
he is more restrained than before.  Absent are Tarantino's post modern 
tendencies - the "new" new wave tendency of drawing attention to the film 
itself. Gone are the prefabricated gaffes, stylized deaths, slowed motion, 
cartoon boxes drawn in the air, etc.  Jackie harkens back to the 70's ultra 
realistic, slowly spun crime tales such as Friedken's French Connection or 
Lumet's Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and the Anderson Tapes (Tarantino is no 
doubt a fan of all).  And while Dogs and Pulp were comprised from so many 
different bits and pieces and styles - in Jackie, Tarantino invest in a
singular style - (will this be called "his own" now?) which is something he 
really hasn't done before.  I could find no distinguishable film references 
in Jackie in either dialogue or shots other than one mentioned later.  One 
might say this was because it was an adaptation and not Tarantino's own 
writing - yet I believe this was a deliberate action by Tarantino to hush 
the loud mouths who said he has no talent as a director above and beyond 
homaging other's works.  It wouldn't be that hard to make film references 
regardless of the source material...  Danny Boyle took Irwin Welsh's 
Trainspotting and meshed a wide range of references from the likes of A Hard 
Days Night to a Clockwork Orange.  Again, I believe it was a deliberate 
choice.  One of Tarantino's smaller trademarks does survive... the POV shot 
from the car trunk now appearing in 4 Tarantino movies.  Another difference 
is in the look of the film as Guilermo Navaro must have been a cheaper 
Cinematographer than Andrzej Sekula who worked on Dogs and Pulp.  I liked 
Sekula better, but Navaro's images seem a little brighter and sharper which 
does work ok with the more realistic style of Jackie. 
     Ok, what about those 2 obvious 'tricks' that Tarantino does use in 
Jackie?  The Split Screen, and the repeated time sequence.  The split screen 
job might be considered an all-purpose homage to 70's film making (see QT 
favorite De Palma use it in Carrie or Norman Jewison back in 68 in a 
probable QT favorite the Thomas Crown Affair).  The shot is ballsy.. but 
masterful.. it would be difficult to envision the scene being done any other 
way after viewing it.  Secondly, the repeated time sequence.  I read others 
say it's similar to his previous non-linear time constructions. Again, 
totally different.  Previously Tarantino has taken the entire story and 
shuffled it, overlapping small portions creating a disjointing effect on the 
narrative that takes multiple viewings or some brainstorming to figure out 
exactly what DID happen.  In Jackie, the same small portion of the story is 
told exactly the same way, three times, from 3 different view points.  This 
actually increases the amount of information received, instead of 
diminishing it (of course, not much to think about later).  Prominent (and 
hard working) internet critic James Berardinelli likened it to Rashomon or 
more recently Courage Under Fire - yet those tales were repeated multiple 
times by different narrators and each narrator took his own liberties with 
the story and each version is told with direction to reflect the differences 
(well, at least Roshomon was).  I think the sequence in Jackie to be much 
more akin to Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" where a strictly objective 
camera captures a heist from multiple view points and angles.  From one 
angle, a character is merely peripheral while the other character does HIS 
important task.. yet switch the angle to the peripheral character and now we 
see what HE is going through while the other character is now just a figure 
in the distance.  Thankfully there is no narrator to explain things to us as 
was needed in the Killing, but Tarantino does include a (visible) 'stop 
watch'  just as Kubrick provided an oral one to help out.  I think it's a 
fascinating use of film technique to tell the story. Is it necessary?  Of 
course not.  Then again, what in film really is?  They could have just 
filmed Jack Palance in an easy chair reading the story and it would be just 
as good right?
    The music - typical Tarantino fair?  Again, not really.  Not much of  
the surf and rockabilly of Pulp, and barely any of the 70's pop / rock which 
permeated Dogs.  Tarantino has turned to some fine, fine soul music.  More 
importantly, most (but not all) of the songs are used in a genuine manner - 
not as ironic counterpoint,  as could have been expected from the guy who 
had a cop beat to Joe Tex singing "I Gotcha" and brutal assaults set to 
"Stuck in the Middle" and "Commanche".  Tarantino treats these songs with 
much more respect and actually repeats songs as 'Themes' (every good hero 
should have one) for his characters which is something he has not done 
before.  The Delfonics "Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time" scores the 
attraction between Jackie and Max.  An incredibly nasty instrumental tune 
which I have no idea what the name or artist is (Since it's an instrumental 
AND since they left it off the soundtrack) plays when Ordell is laying forth 
his halfbaked but nefarious plans.  Jackie's theme is "Across 110th Street" 
by Bobby Womack, incredibly telling for the character - "Pimps trying to 
catch a woman that's weak", "Doing whatever I had to do to survive, I'm not 
saying what I did was all right.."  The movie opens and closes with the song 
and to those (like me) who hold such soul music near and dear to their 
hearts, Jackie mouthing the lyrics while departing haven risen above her 
predicament is a pretty stirring moment.  This deep fried soul is no doubt 
much less accessible to the average Tarantino demographic from his previous 
two films but to those who have an appreciation for black music (and film) 
should really, really, really dig it.
     Well, I've just about covered most of the things I had in mind to say 
about Jackie Brown.  Lastly, some small themes and or sub text I picked up. 
 Usually it takes two viewings for this, so they are a bit scarce now.  
First is the somewhat obvious theme of "age" in the film.  Looking back, 
Tarantino's previous films do touch on the subject...  in Dogs everyone is 
to respect the Elder Joe Cabot who is referred to throughout as "Papa" or 
"Daddy".  More so in Pulp Fiction - Marcellus tells Butch he is too old to 
realize any dreams of being a contender.  Jules quits the business declaring 
"My ass is retired".  Travolta gained pounds as it was important that 
Vincent also be a hit man past his prime.  The Wolf is an elderly statesman, 
he tells his girlfriend she should "respect her elders".  In Jackie, most of 
the 'bad guys' are aging. It's not so much sub-text because they talk about 
it openly, but it's an interesting theme nevertheless.  Lewis coughs and is 
a bit too old for sex with Melanie (and on a separate thought.. has his 
incarceration made him more comfortable with front to back sex?).  Max and 
Jackie talk about how they are getting old while listening to a selection 
from her vinyl collection (at this point there is also some clever innuendo 
concerning how "black coffee" would be fine).  Any ways, I wonder if this 
theme of aging is something Tarantino has highlighted or created (perhaps 
some Allenesque paranoia exists in Tarantino?) or if this was merely part of 
Leonard's character traits that he chose to remain faithful to?  Lastly, 
some symbolism in a reverse fashion from Reservoir Dogs (literally, 
fashion).  In RD, the Dogs start the movie dressed immaculately in the super 
cool black and white retro-fitted suits made famous twice before by the 
likes of Godard and Woo.  As the film progresses though, sunglasses are 
lost, jackets tossed, and white shirts come un tucked and blood soaked.  
Jackie Brown encounters the reverse - as her situation improves, so does her 
outfit.  Jackie starts in her Stewardess uniform - nice enough, but a symbol 
of her, well, shitty commercial job.  She goes downward to "County Blues" 
and bathrobes and other unflattering attire.  But as Jackie is on the rise, 
she dawns a tight fitting red dress and is filmed notably more attractively. 
 Finally, with the execution of her plan - she purchases a chic, 70's style 
pant suit - black and white - not so much unlike the black and white duds of 
both the Dogs (before they all got trashed)  and of Jules and Vincent 
(before they had to dress like 'A couple of dorks'). This is no doubt 
nothing new to film as symbolic colors and wardrobe have always been 
important to the best film makers - but it's attention to such details that 
I believe will keep Tarantino among those great ones in the years to come.  
     Was Jackie Brown too long?  I can't hardly stand people objecting to 
the length of a film as a criticism for 'what's wrong with it'.  A bad film 
can be too long.  How can a good film be too long?  Why do people go to 
spend big bucks on a movie, and then bolt from the theater like they have 
something better to be doing?  I make it a point to get a seat before the 
trailers start.  I love trailers. By the time they are through I'm already 
through a box of Jr. Mints.  I watch the movie, I get comfortable, I focus 
on the whole screen and try and take it all in.  I listen to the music, and 
then when it's over I WATCH THE CREDITS.  Why not?  Is there not music 
playing on a sound system that costs thousands of dollars?  Aren't you in a 
comfy seat with a climate controlled environment?  Don't you want to see the 
songs and artists?  Do you know any of the people Tarantino thanked at the 
end of the credits??  Did you see the beautiful Jackie Brown logo in 198 
point "Boogie" font scroll up the screen to close the credits?  How about 
the inserts in credits of L.A. Confidential?  Are you watching the movie 
because you like film or you are killing time?  If you answer the latter, 
that's fine - we all need to kill some time.  It's just disheartening for 
people like me to hear an artist's work criticized for being too long simply 
because some folks's inability to relax and let those 'important' things 
rest for a few hours and REALLY take in a movie.
     Overall, Jackie Brown is not a monumental film.  It's almost as much 
pulp fiction as Leonard's novels are - entertaining, but somewhat 
forgettable.  No one will quote Ordell or Jackie on a daily basis.  The 
Simpson's won't have a homage to it.  Furniture commercials won't start 
featuring soul music.  But, it was a very, very good film and one that lets 
the load of 'what comes next' come down of his back.  Hell, I feel more 
relief than he does now that's it's over and done with.  It proves Tarantino 
is not a 'one trick pony'.  It shows a great deal of consistency when fellow 
film makers who were declared "Auteurs" after one film are failing miserably 
on their second and third.  It shows a definite turn towards a more serious 
style of film making, and perhaps, if he wants to make another, will lead to 
another monumental film.</P>
