<PRE>TITANIC TOWN
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Of all the films about The Troubles, Northern Ireland's 25+ year
politico-religious struggle with its neighbor from across the Irish Sea,
the newly-released "Titanic Town" brings the day-to-day horrors of a family
forced to cope with British occupation to the fore better than any other.</P>
<P>        Less intent on airing its own political views, the focus in Roger
Michell's film is on the McPhelimy's--mother Bernie (Julie Walters), father
Aidan (Ciarán Hinds), and their growing family of four.</P>
<P>        And it's the daily difficulties of raising children under such extreme
conditions that makes this true-life saga so powerful.  British troops run
rampant through their West Belfast housing estate, conducting nightly
raids; Saracen tanks and armored vehicles carve huge furrows across their
lawns; and the sounds of gunfire, explosions, breaking glass, and screaming
neighbors are a constant.</P>
<P>        Michell made "Notting Hill" and here's another fine film that looks a
foregone conclusion on the surface yet proves to be surprisingly potent
once it starts to get inside the means and motivations of its central
characters.</P>
<P>        The Irish Republican Army's claim that they are "for the people" is
questioned in this story of a naïve yet courageous Catholic woman who
challenges both the Provisionals and the British government by forming a
peace movement.  All that Bernie McPhelimy wants, at least initially, is to
establish a normal living environment for her family.  Normal in the sense
of "no shooting during daylight hours," that is.</P>
<P>        Walters is a knock-out as the attention-seeking Bernie who puts her family
in the frontline by expressing her views publicly, in town meetings and
later on television.  Walters' Irish accent is impeccable and her
performance truly dominant; this is easily the actor's best role since
"Educating Rita" (in fact, she might well have bettered herself here).</P>
<P>        Hinds is no less impressive in a more subdued role.  With a look of Alan
Bates, his Aidan is a scared, powerless man whose ulcer causes him to
double up in pain every time a mortar shell cracks or a brick comes
crashing through the dining room window.  A particularly telling scene
shows him watching from an upstairs bedroom window while his wife grapples
with an armed demonstrator on their front stoop.</P>
<P>        In addition to the film's absorbing central theme, there's also a
well-developed subplot in which Annie, the McPhelimy's teenage daughter (an
outstanding Nuala O'Neill), fosters a relationship with a young medical
student (nicely played by Ciarán McMenamin).  Their introduction on a
double-decker bus is a stunner: before they've exchanged so much as a
couple of words, the bus is stoned and firebombed by demonstrators in the
Falls Road, a particularly volatile section of the city.</P>
<P>        It's scenes like these in which "Titanic Town" (named for the place in
which they built the ill-fated liner) hits home time and time again.  For
all the false hopes and promises of a ceasefire, for all the political
rhetoric, those affected the most are the living, breathing inhabitants of
the city of Belfast.  And in this gritty, realistic, and excellently acted
film, those daily horrors are uncompromisingly brought to life.</P>
