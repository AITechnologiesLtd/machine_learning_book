<P>     A lot of funny things probably go on backstage at any given beauty
contest, but obviously writer Lona Williams never heard about any of
them. Instead of offering any kind of juicy details -- we all knew about
how contestants put Vaseline on their teeth to brighten their smiles,
thank you -- her screenplay for "Drop Dead Gorgeous" merely trots out a
bunch of cliched characters, saddles them with Minnesota acents and
expects hilarity to follow.</P>
<P>With its conniving mothers and star-struck daughters, "Gorgeous"
begs unflattering comparisons to two other similar and far superior
films, both directed by Michael Ritchie. His outrageously funny "Smile"
stands as the last word on teen pageants, while his "The Positively True
Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom," a 1993 HBO movie starring
Holly Hunter as the kook who went to prison for attempting to hire
killers to ensure her kid made the cheerleading squad, had an edginess
and spark that's nowhere to be found here.</P>
<P>Clumsily directed by Michael Patrick Jann, "Gorgeous" offers a
mock-documentary look at what happens when girls from the opposite sides
of the social scale compete for the title of Sarah Rose Cosmetics
American Teen Princess. Rebecca Leeman (Denise Richards) is a well-to-do
beauty whose dad owns a furniture store, while Amber Atkins (Kirsten
Dunst) works afterschool as a beautician in a funeral home to help pay
the bills. Rebecca's mom Gladys (a tired-looking Kirstie Alley) is
snippy and snobbish; Amber's mom Annette (Ellen Barkin, in yet another
role unworthy of her) is crude and boozy. Williams, from the evidence
onscreen, never met a stereotype she couldn't embrace.</P>
<P>But it's not a crime to use stereotypes in a comedy if you can find
something amusing for them to say, as David E. Kelley did in "Lake
Placid." Williams, however, thinks we should be tickled just by the mere
mention of cow-tipping, lutefisk and Melissa Manchester. At one point,
fire sweeps through the Atkins' trailer and Amber reports all their
clothes "melted together, forming a big polyester meteor in our closet."
Poor people living in trailer parks and wearing polyester -- pretty
witty stuff, this.</P>
<P>In some kind of attempt to top "There's Something About Mary,"
"Gorgeous" also includes a mentally challenged character who bumps into
things and plays with himself in front of the contestants. It also makes
several slaps at Lutherans, with an organization called the Lutheran
Sisterhood Gun Club and a joke about the Lutheran church being holier
the Catholic church because "Lutherans use grape Kool-Aid for the blood
of Christ." To show us how stupid and trashy people are in Minnesota,
Williams has them chew tobacco, smoke incessantly and say "you betcha"
as often as possible.</P>
<P>Lost in this mess are a couple of respectable performances by
Richards and Dunst, the only people in the movie who seem to understand
that playing comedy does not mean you have to shout frequently and
exaggerate every gesture. Dunst, remembered as the creepy child from
"Interview With the Vampire," has turned into a highly likable young
actress, and Richards is spotlighted in one of the film's few funny
scenes, a bizarre moment involving a Frankie Valli song and an effigy of
Jesus Christ. Most of the rest of "Drop Dead Gorgeous" simply falls
flat.</P>
