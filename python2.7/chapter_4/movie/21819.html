<PRE>The World Is Not Enough Review</PRE>
<P>  I have generally been a fan of the James Bond series, and I am always
anticipating a new installment. While Pierce Brosnan is a good Bond, his films,
with the exception of Goldeneye, have suffered greatly from storylines and even
some action sequences.
  In the 19th episode, Bond is sent to protect Elektra King, who's in charge of
an oil company (Sophie Marceau) from the evil madman Renard (Robert Carlyle),
who has a bullet driven into his head, giving him the power to feel no pain. Of
course what is a Bond film without twists and turns, none of which I will
reveal, for your viewing pleasure.
  This film disappoints on so many levels, that I could spend all day
discussing them, but I'll keep it relatively short. First off, the film is
actually quite dull. I thought I'd never see the day, when a Bond film never
delivers an explosive ride. Sure there are some nice highlights. The
Underground Pipe scene, the boat chase at the beginning, but nothing ever
sticks out. In Goldneye there was the tank scene, in Tomorrow Never Dies the
remote controlled car, this one merely follows the formula and never gives us a
treat. Even the ending is pathetic. How many times must a Bond film involve a
submarine! It's time to think of something more elaborate, hint hint, be
creative next time.
  Another element that bugged me, was Robert Carlyle. I was expecting a great
performance, especially when the character has a bullet in his head, and can
feel no pain. I was really hoping they would have expanded on that, but that
never occurred. The Bond girls however were decent. Despite the rumors you've
heard about Denise Richard's acting ability, it wasn't as bad as I thought.
Considering the little amount of screen time she had, there was no way of
telling what she could have done, but hey, she looks real nice. Isn't that what
Bond girls are about anyway? I mean, it's not like she's in the running for an
Oscar. Sophie Marceau however was of value to the film, but she received far
too much attention. The film could have easily been shortened, if it wasn't for
the writer's obsession with her character.
  Luckily, those Bond moments fans all cherish are still here and of course
some new features, that might be of some interest as well. Of course there is
the hero himself, Pierce Brosnan, who continues to do an exceptional job as
Bond. I do hope that he will reconsider, and do another entry, this time, a
more thoughtful entertaining one! Then there's the gadgets. Too be honest, the
vehicles are the main factor in this film and there are very few gadgets. The
BMW, although considered a gadget, looked nice, but you can pretty much guess
what happens to that, and every other vehicle Bond enters. The "fishing boat"
as Q refers to, is also pretty shabby, as it's powered by booster jets.
Speaking of Q, he is now training John Cleese (the latest expert) to replace
himself, for when he retires. When Q does go, it will be a shame to see him
leave. I doubt the series will ever be the same without the help of Q's
priceless one-liners, but Cleese (best known for his work in Monty Python) is a
rather noble replacement. At least it's someone you can rely on to make you
laugh.
  While "The World Is Not Enough" is far from the best in the series, there are
some fast paced scenes, that will keep you strapped to your chair. The familiar
elements are still here, but fans will be undoubtebly displeased.</P>
