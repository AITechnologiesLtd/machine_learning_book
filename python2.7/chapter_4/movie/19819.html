<PRE>THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR
A movie review by Joe Barlow
(c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Ben Gazzara,
    Faye Dunaway
DIRECTOR: John McTiernan
WRITERS: Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer
RATED: R
RELEASED: 1999</PRE>
<P>Thomas Crown is a man who has everything, but still finds his life
unfulfilling. Although possessing nearly unlimited funds (witness his
impulsive $100,000 bet on one hole of golf simply because it
eradicates his boredom for a few fleeting seconds), Crown (Pierce
Brosnan) lacks the ability to enjoy the simplest pleasures. Even
though his house is staffed with a large live-in crew (including his
lawyer!), he finds himself drowning in a pool of loneliness. </P>
<P>He does have one hobby, however: planning the perfect crime. More for
a lack of something to do than any real desire to own it, Crown
manages to liberate an invaluable Monet from his favorite art museum. </P>
<P>Crown's ploy is eventually discovered by Catherine Banning (a
remarkably annoying Rene Russo), an insurance agent in charge of
locating the missing painting, who spends most of the film trying to
decide whether to capture the hero or hop into bed with him. You know,
I think I saw this movie once already this year, only it was called
Entrapment and was a heck of a lot better the first time. </P>
<P>The Thomas Crown Affair is a remake of the 1968 film of the same name,
which I never saw, but I'm sure it's better than the present
incarnation, simply because people remember it fondly. This version
lacks any discernible entertainment value. Speeches are delivered
without passion, actions are undertaken without urgency, and the
story's most interesting subplot (Crown's theft of the painting and
the repercussions of this action) are cheerfully jettisoned in favor
of a formula romance so stale and unconvincing that it probably
wouldn't have seemed fresh no matter what year the movie was released.
There's a lot of tension and excitement during the opening and closing
scenes, when the crime is at the forefront of the plot, but we sure
have to wade through a swamp of sentamentality inbetween these
bookending sequences. </P>
<P>But the one thing that hurts the film, that moves it from "mediocre"
to "painful," is its leading lady. As portrayed by Rene Russo, the
character of Catherine Banning is an unsympathetic Gillian
Anderson-wannabe, so confident in her sexuality that she forgets to
display a single redeeming characteristic throughout the course of the
entire movie. She just expects her (if I may speak frankly) very
limited sex appeal to carry her through the events in the story. Russo
is a poor choice for the part: she has neither the dynamic
personality, oozing sexuality, or magnetic screen presence required to
make Banning convincing and likeable. It's not so much that she's a
bad actress, but she's definitely miscast here. Imagine Kathy Bates in
the Catherine Zeta-Jones role from The Mask of Zorro, and you'll
understand what I mean. </P>
<P>Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, fares somewhat better. With his
rugged good looks and intense gaze, Brosnan demonstrates the same sort
of charisma he's shown in the James Bond franchise: you may not like
him, but it's hard not to watch whatever he's doing. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, that's hardly enough to make this movie terribly
memorable.  The film invites us to ponder what we'd do if we had
everything. The execution of "The Thomas Crown Affair" leaves little
doubt in my mind: I'd find a more interesting person to fall in love
with, cut the last ten minutes of deadwood from my story, and spend
less time straying from fascinating crime scenes into a mundane
romance that no one cares about.  </P>
<PRE>           RATING: * 1/2 (out of a possible ****) </PRE>

<P>"The one good thing about the [life-size sticker of
 Jar Jar Binks on the door of Taco Bell] is you can
 pretty convincingly throw the SOB a roundhouse punch.
 I found it satisfying."   --Renard A. Dellafave</P>
