<PRE>UNDER THE SAND (SOUS LE SABLE)    * * *</PRE>
<PRE>2000 – France
Director: Francois Ozon
Starring: Charlotte Rampling, Bruno Cremer, Jacques Nolot</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Damn those trailers. Had it not been for the advertising of this film, which
reveals far too much about its contents, I would have been glued to `Under the
Sand'. As it is, the film retains some value, thanks to an excellent performance
by Charlotte Rampling, and a more mature Francois Ozon in the director's
chair.</P>
<P>Marie (Charlotte Rampling) and her husband Jean (Bruno Cremer) lounge on the
beach. She takes a nap while he goes for a swim. When Marie wakes up, Jean is
nowhere to be found. She contacts authorities, but they can't find him either.
Did he disappear to start a new life? Was he killed by accident? Did he commit
suicide? Marie still asks herself these questions a year later, and in order to
move on with her life, she must find some answers. </P>
<P>It's a fine premise, and this little movie uses it to the limit. The film moves
at a leisurely pace, a bit slow, but relaxing. It's a very visual story, and you
can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles. This is mostly
thanks to the excellent camera work by Antoine Heberle and Jeanne Lapoirie, who
shot the film in a dreamy haze, and the lead performance by Rampling.</P>
<P>Rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of Marie, you connect with her
character instantly, despite that she's delusional. The scenes where she
interacts with her husband, who she still believes is alive, are heartbreaking.
She can't quite get over him. They've been married for twenty-five years. The
other actors, particularly Jacques Nolot, are excellent too.</P>
<P>The sex in the film is rather unneeded, but compared to Ozon's `Criminal
Lovers', it's the Disney Channel. </P>
<P>Likely to cause some discussion afterwards, `Under the Sand' is a fine movie
going experience. While it's hard to recommend as entertainment, it's a fine
adult alternative about how we deal with loss. Ozon seems to ask what you would
do, and that's certainly a hard question to answer. </P>
