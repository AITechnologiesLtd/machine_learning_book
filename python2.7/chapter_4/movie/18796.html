<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
3 and a half stars</P>
<P>It's hard to know whether One True Thing should be classified as a
mainstream or art house production.  There are definite Hollywood
touches in the film, evident in its opening and closing images that
tinker on the verge of portraying glossy sentimentality.  But the
majority of the film is habituated with emotional resonance, both
profound and unsophisticated, that philosophizes about the togetherness
of a family that is, by social definition, far from faultless.</P>
<P>Scriptwriter Karen Croner - who adapted the screenplay from Anna
Quindlen's novel - succeeds so well in crafting her very domestic
characters by realizing that there is nothing incredibly unique about
them.  Even in Meryl Streep's dying character - a woman who is suffering
from terminal cancer - the 'one true thing' in her life is the simple
fact that she is related by blood and love to the rest of her family.
She is neither a self-pronounced nor a publicly proclaimed hero; she
doesn't arrive at a conclusion that puts the rest of her life in
perspective.  She is simply a mother, a wife, a decent person, and
somebody who finds joy from establishing happy relationships.  This
passionate view on motherhood and families is at times given a cynical
edge by director Carl Franklin, who generally achieves what he intends
to.  At its best, One True Thing explores the isolation and unity of a
family, and the things that bring them together as well as the things
that tear them apart.</P>
<P>Kate Gulden (Meryl Streep) is cheerful mother who lives a peaceful life
in a small American town with husband George (William Hurt).  After Kate
is admitted into hospital for an operation that will hopefully remove a
terminal cancer from her body, George asks daughter Ellen (Renée
Zellweger) to take leave from her busy New York life as a journalist so
she can take care of her mother.  Ellen reluctantly obliges, and soon
learns the demanding requirements for being the maintainer of a
household.  She experiences first-hand the life in which Kate lives, and
as her cancer worsens, Kate relies on Ellen for physical and emotional
support.  But Ellen also has matters of her own to take of, including
her desperate attempts to keep her job and her growing suspicion and
frustration of her father, who is seldom at home.</P>
<P>The story is more of a mediation than a narrative, and that suits the
film's direction, which relies heavily on the strength of its
performers.  Thankfully Franklin draws exceptional performances from his
talented cast, ranging from Renée Zellwege's subtle portray of emotional
pain to Meryl Streep's display of physical suffering.  William Hurt is
also very fine, and displays a knack for questioning the audience as to
whether they should love or hate his character.  One True Thing's
ensemble cast lifts the film to heights that would have been otherwise
impossible to reach.</P>
<P>One True Thing does have its drawbacks, though, as not everything in the
film is as bittersweet as perhaps I have made it out to be.  Franklin's
direction sometimes feels like he is trotting over the same ground again
and again, not really going anywhere, but rather building a more
reclusive and isolated atmosphere for his characters to revolve in.
Strangely, it does pay off well, with an ending that is quite satisfying
considering that we know roughly what is going to happen from the very
first scene.</P>
<P>"Less is more," says William Hurt in the film, and that quote is
appropriate to Franklin's use of Karen Croner's script.  Some of the
power he exemplifies comes from the things that he doesn't explain or
elaborate on, which perhaps motivated him to refuse to round off One
True Thing in the happy and resolved way that made Stepmom - this year's
other film about a woman dying of cancer - pretentious and irritating.
This is one piece that intelligently illustrates the faults and merits
of reasonable people.  None are squeaky clean, and there are no heroes
or enemies.  But the very humane message that powers this film is,
although a touch too simplistic, enough to instigate an emotional
reaction from viewers.  It wants to conclude with a happy ending, but,
like life, happiness is in the eye of the beholder.</P>
