SEE JANE RUN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Writer/director Sarah Thorp's SEE JANE RUN is kinda cute.  Starring Clea 
DuVall (GIRL, INTERRUPTED and BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER) as Jane, an unhappy 
L.A. waitress with a couple of quirky roommates, the movie plays like a 
series of impromptu comedy sketches.  </P>
<P>Unable to kill herself since she keeps getting interrupted, Jane turns 
instead to a life of crime as a way to finance a pilgrimage to her 
promised land, Wyoming.  "Crime -- the hours are good, you get to travel 
and you meet nice people all of the time," she decides gleefully.  
Helping her are her roommates, Marvin (Richmond Arquette), a writer with 
a permanent writer's block, and Gina (Jennifer Aspen), a perky actress 
with 654 auditions under her belt and zero parts.  Marvin and Gina see 
robbery as a way to enhance their movie careers.  Marvin practices his 
bad screenwriting, and Gina overacts with a vengeance.   </P>
<P>Jane's downfall as a criminal is her inability to identify the right 
loot.  What does one do with tins of Spam or pet toys for a non-existent 
dog?  Director Sarah Thorp's only inabilities stem from inexperience.  
After this promising but uneven first film, expect to see her name on 
better films in the future.</P>
<P>SEE JANE RUN runs 1:30.  It is not rated but might be PG-13 for language 
and mature subject matter.  It would be acceptable for kids around 12 
and up.</P>
