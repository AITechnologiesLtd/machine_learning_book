<PRE>                        CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN SUBURBIA
                          A film review by Julia Levin

<P>If you're seeking enlightenment on what you think would be a modern
reverberation on the timeless Fyodor Dostoyevsky's masterpiece, don't be
misled by Crime and Punishment in Suburbia.  While the film opens with a
quotation from Crime and Punishment, which, I suppose, is intended to
lead us to a new interpretation of the book, that's the only (tenuous)
connection.  In the novel, the protagonist, Raskolnikov, rebels against
the morality imposed on him by a society and kills an innocent woman. 
He later discovers that the worst punishment for the murder was the one
his guilty conscience made him to endure.  And perhaps, if you
concentrate hard enough, the suffering Raskolnikov could conceivably
parallel that of a pudgy adolescent Roseanne (Monica Keena ex of
Dawson's Creek), one of the main characters in the movie.</P>
<P>Completed before American Beauty, this artificial little movie resembles
it in every way possible, mainly because it examines the very same set
of stereotypes about malfunctioning wealthy suburbanites.  Vincent
(Vincent Kartheiser), a sallow loner, follows Roseanne everywhere with
his camera.  Given the privilege to provide voice-over for most of the
film, we hope that he is the voice of wisdom, or at least revelation in
the story.  Far from it: His philosophy is one of a self-possessed New
Age spiritual guru who is convinced he can save Roseanne from hell she
is living in.  What Ricky was able to see with his lens in American
Beauty revealed the hidden layers of human behavior.  Vincent, by
comparison, as well as the whole ensemble of characters in Crime and
Punishment, goes through the plot's twists and turns without a single
coherent thought in his head.</P>
<P>The genre of the film is familiar -- using the suburbs as an emotional
terrain where the sense of unwholesomeness surrounds the surfaces of
people's life and threatens their seemingly secure shelters.  In
Roseanne's family, we have a complete set of obvious characters: a
psychopathic stepfather (Michael Ironside) with a face of a bulldog and
a penchant for heavy drinking, a frustrated and suffering mother (Ellen
Barkin), and a vacuous, popular little girl who dates a football player
(James DeBello).  What follows is supposed to be a tragedy of
revelations, in which a gloomy loner Vincent will help Roseanne
rediscover herself and alter her perception of the world forever. 
Supposed to be.</P>
<P>What attracted me the most in American Beauty was how punchy and
derisive -- yet humane -- the film was.  It carried a deep loss for the
human connection, a charge that gave the film its integrity, the weight
of reality.  The humorless Crime and Punishment substitutes this depth
with a slow motion camera, elaborate soundtrack, suggestive visual
themes, and a stupid voice over.</P>
<P>To completely befuddle us, the film switches from Vincent's voice over
to Roseanne's.  In a chillingly dispassionate voice, she narrates from
jail and says how much she enjoys her non-existence.  "I killed
somebody.  I was sorry.  It changed nothing."  When freed, she follows
Vincent as her savior and marvels, "What a strange path it took to find
my heart."  But first, you have had to believe that she even has one.</P>
