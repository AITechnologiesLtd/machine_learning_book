A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Penelope Spheeris</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Greg Erb and Craig Mazin</PRE>
<P>Starring: Marlon Wayans, Matthew Lillard, David Spade, Tamara Taylor,
Brad Dourif</P>
<P>Ingredients: College nerd, secret formula, girlfriend, upper crust  frat
boy rival</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Darryl (Marlon Wayans) plays a down-and-out University economics student
who will do anything to win a contest in which the winning student is
awarded a junior analyst position at Smith-Bytes, a prestigious Wall
Street firm. The problem is, the only people who ever win are rich kids
with upper class connections and prestigious positions in fraternities
and school sports. Meanwhile, poor Darryl is in debt and working himself
broke trying to send money back home to support his destitute,
fatherless family. He has no chance of becoming a contest finalist.</P>
<P>As yet another way to make money Darryl volunteers himself as a human
guinea pig to take an experimental drug, and suddenly finds that his
five senses are ten times as powerful as before. Thus empowered he joins
a fraternity, romances the girl of his dreams Janice (Tamara Taylor),
conquers the hockey team, works his way into the good graces of some
Smith-Bytes execs, and becomes a contest finalist. But tragedy strikes
when Darryl gets power hungry and double doses himself; his five sense
start disappearing.</P>
<P>Can the newly humbled Darryl win the contest, save his family, and win
back the favor of his girlfriend using his own power without the help of
the wonder drug?</P>
<P>Opinion:
In 1984 comedian Steve Martin did a comedy film called ALL OF ME (1984),
in which the spirit of a woman  took possession of one half of Martin's
body. ALL OF ME was a great excuse to highlight Martin's physical comedy
in the form of pratfalls and exaggerated clumsiness. Martin was
different from Robin Williams - - another premier comedian of the 1980s
- -  in that Martin was mostly 'goofy physical' while Williams excelled
in manic, mile-a-minute monologues.</P>
<P>In the 1990s we see a similar comedic dichotomy. On the one hand we have
the fast talking Jim Carrey or Chris Rock while on the other hand there
is Marlon Wayans, an expert trip and fall guy. Wayans' SENSELESS is
similar to Martin's ALL OF ME in that SENSELESS is a very funny comedy
about a guy losing control of his body - - and the film gives physical
comedian Marlon Wayans a great vehicle for comedic falls, slobbery
facial expressions, and general goofiness. If you can imagine Steve
Martin or Jerry Lewis' ability to trip and fall, combined with zany
facial expressions and Eddie Murphy-like enthusiasm, then you have a
good idea of Wayans' comedic charm. </P>
<P>My only complaint is that one scene in SENSELESS - - the scene where
Darryl tries to have sex with Janice's sorority sister - - doesn't match
Darryl's ethical character or fit in with the rest of the movie. But
there are also very good scenes. One of my favorites is where Darryl
tests out his super senses playing ice hockey for the college team and
becomes a 'kung fu' goalie.</P>
<P>SENSELESS is funny. Director Penelope Spheeris (who also directed
WAYNE'S WORLD) hits the funny bone yet again with this one.</P>
