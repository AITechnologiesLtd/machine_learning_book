<PRE>Small Time Crooks 
A film review by Marty Mapes 
Copyright 2000 Marty Mapes </PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) After thoroughly enjoying Woody Allen's latest
lightweight comedy, a friend said something that makes it harder for me
to recommend it. He pointed out, correctly, that the movie has no third
act. It just ends. The structure is sloppy and incomplete.</P>
<P>That doesn't mean I suddenly enjoyed the movie less. I still found
Allen's comedy to be as funny as any of his recent comic successes such
as EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU and MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY. </P>
<PRE>Simple Plot</PRE>
<P>Ray (Woody Allen) is a small time crook who gets a brilliant scheme to
rent out a shop two doors down from a bank. He'll set up a front
operation, which his wife Frenchie (Tracy Ullman) will operate, and
he'll tunnel his way to the bank. The scheme goes horribly wrong, but
Frenchie's front operation takes off, and soon the small band of crooks
is making it big in legitimate business.</P>
<P>The plot is as sparse and as simple as that, which ordinarily would
leave a lot to be desired. However, in this case, a wisp of plot is all
that's needed, a simple setting against which Allen's cast of colorful
characters can react and play.</P>
<PRE>Dumb in Their Own Ways</PRE>
<P>Each of the funny figures in this movie is dumb in his or her own,
unique way.</P>
<P>For example, Allen's character is blue-collar dumb. He has made a career
as a dishwasher. When he was in jail for a crime he botched, the other
prisoners sarcastically called him "The Brain," which he took as a
compliment.</P>
<P>Frenchie is low-brow dumb. She wants to be cultured and refined, but her
inborn taste is against her. Even with one-on-one lessons in class from
Hugh Grant, she can't seem to master the art of subtlety.</P>
<P>My husband Otto was dyslexic. The only thing he could spell correctly
was his name.-- Elaine May, as May</P>
<P>Frenchie's cousin May (played by writer/director Elaine May) is low-IQ
dumb. She takes everything at face value. White lies, subterfuge, and
personal secrets are all beyond her mental capacity. May delivers some
of the funniest lines in the movie with a perfect deadpan.</P>
<P>Just to round things out, Michael Rapaport, in a small role, is
"dumb-blond" dumb. He looks up to Ray "The Brain" and is eager to help
in Ray's latest greatest caper. While digging a tunnel he wears his
miners' helmet (complete with lamp) backwards because it looks cool that
way.</P>
<PRE>Verbal Comedy</PRE>
<P>Allen's humor in SMALL TIME CROOKS is largely verbal. It's a style of
comedy that not many modern filmmakers do well. The Marx Brothers were
experts (except for Harpo, of course). But since then it's been a long,
dry spell. Only Woody Allen makes good, solid comedies where most of the
jokes are in the dialogue, and this is one of them.</P>
<PRE>Connoisseurs of well-made film should lower their expectations before
going to SMALL TIME CROOKS; my friend was right about its structure. But
I'd still recommend this film to just about anyone, connoisseur or
not.
