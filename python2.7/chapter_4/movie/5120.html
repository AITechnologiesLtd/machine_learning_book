                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>      "Cold Fever" is a one-man road movie; it is also a
cross-cultural feast so funny and touching, so eccentric, that we
watch in fascination just to see what can possibly happen next. 
On one level, nothing happens in this movie; on another,
everything does.
     Atsushi Hirata is a successful young Japanese businessman
about to enjoy a golfing vacation in Hawaii.  In short order we
see that he is imprisoned in a world of corporate musts.  He must
make a toast, he must perform, he must do his duty, and finally,
pushed by an elder, he must cancel his vacation in order to
administer burial rites for his parents, who died in an
automobile crash while living in Iceland.  Only he can bring
peace to their spirits.    
     The melancholy young man is lifted by jetliner out of one
culture and deposited in another utterly alien one. The great
beauty of this movie, and its gift to the audience, is the
extraordinary immediacy and strength of the cultures it evokes.  
     Atsushi has chosen to cross the country during the
impossible winter season--by cab, car, horse, and on foot. 
Propelled by obligation, he will allow nothing to keep him from
reaching his goal.  By the time he arrives, we are quite
literally shivering in our seats from watching horizontal sleet
blowing across an already frozen landscape.  
     Thick-coated horses stand in the wind.  Night hovers
continually, lightened only by the ubiquitous whiteness.   Alone
on a one-lane road of rutted ice, Atsushi's few random encounters
are with people who sing--almost in self-defense against the
hostile climate that surrounds them.  They sing in barns, at
funerals, in the backs of trucks as they negotiate a countryside
of white buildings, white water, and white ice. 
     "Does anyone know you are going this way?" asks an ominous
road sign.  Finally, in a bar where the villagers drink "Black
Death," the national sedative," and sing American cowboy songs,
he meets an old man who will guide him on the perilous final leg
of his impossible journey.  The harshness and isolation have
produced an Icelandic Jimmy Stewart.
     Atsushi says very little: "Very strange country; very long
night; very complicated road system."  Not much more than that. 
But he brings great dignity to his quest, and the rituals he
performs for his parents are beautiful.  His search is a majestic
obligation that is the only and very ample thread on which the
filmmakers hang their acute observations of a hostile climate and
the culture created by it.  
     Credit the cross-cultural independent film makers who
imagined this story, and Masatoshi Nagase, who carries it as
Atsushi.  As he says at the end, "Sometimes, the road you take
leads you to a place that's not on any map."  He's right, and it
is a very good trip.      </P>
