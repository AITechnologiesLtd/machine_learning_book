<P>Susan Granger's review of "WHIPPED" (Destination Films)</P>
<P>Luscious Amanda Peet deserves better than this wretched sex
comedy.  She's built up a loyal following from TV's "Jack and Jill"
and made a charming appearance in "The Whole Nine Yards," but this is
a disaster. Written, produced and directed by Peter M. Cohen, the
story revolves around three, single twentysomethings who gather each
Sunday morning for breakfast in a Manhattan diner, along with a fourth
buddy who is married, to brag and exchange graphic tales of their
erotic Saturday night conquests. They're self-proclaimed experts in
"scamming" which involves scoring a date and having sex with a
woman. Brian Van Holt plays the Wall Street guy, the slickest of the
trio; his trick is to approach women and pretend to be their friend's
brother. The friend is always named Jen because, as he reasons, "they
all have a friend name Jen." There's Zorie Barber, a shallow
pseudo-hippie, East Village screenwriter type; pathetically eager
Jonathan Abrahams, who's supposed to be sensitive; and Judah Domke,
who gets vicarious thrills and whose exploits with a juicer and an egg
beater are minor league. However, the group's womanizing camaraderie
is challenged when they meet an enigmatic, uninhibited sexpot - that'
s Peet - and she begins to date all three - at the same time. It seems
she's scamming them, waiting until the second date to have sex and
then vowing to each that he, and he alone, is the one she truly
loves. The less said the better about the grotesque scene in which
Peet's vibrator is dropped into an unflushed toilet. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Whipped" sinks to an obnoxious low with a
creepy, cynical, coarse 1.  It's a smutty, repellent sleazefest.</P>
