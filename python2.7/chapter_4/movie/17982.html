<P>"Life" (1999) - Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy...</P>
<P>        Last fall, Eddie Murphy took on a very subdued (at least by his
standards) role in "Holy Man," and turned out a splendid performance that
deserved much better than the mediocre reception it received. In that
movie, he wasn't constantly stealing scenes, and his trademark horse-laugh
was nowhere to be found. Both he and the movie were remarkably funny, and
Murphy's restrained performance was both admirable and successful. I
thought that maybe, after almost twenty years, Murphy had finally learned
that he's not the most important person in the theatre - the viewer is.</P>
<P>Last weekend, "Life" opened around the country, earning over $20
million. It is funny, but intermittently. Certainly not as funny as it
could have been, had Murphy remembered what he learned from G, the
Zen-spouting mystic he played in the previous movie.</P>
<P>"Life" gets off to a slow start, taking over thirty minutes to get
leads Murphy and Martin Lawrence into the central premise - two New
Yorkers given a life sentence to a Mississippi state prison, circa 1932.
Convicted of a murder they didn't commit in the segregationist South, the
story of how they got there is so bizarre and convoluted it could only
happen in the movies.</P>
<P>Once there, the movie really takes off, introducing the viewer to
a whole cast of usual suspects. Miguel A. Nunez Jr. is the probably-gay
character, Bokeem Woodbine is the probably-savant character, and so on.
Rarely are characters drawn out past the point of a stereotype, but in
this case it works. "Life" goes for the quick gag, the cheap chuckle, and
more often than not gets it. Unfortunately, this means that very little in
the way of character development ever happens, and (in classic, old-school
Murphy style) roughly half of the script consists of words that can't be
printed in this paper.</P>
<P>Occasionally, it gets even more ambitious, trying to work in a bit
of a story too. These efforts generally fall flat, a shame because the raw
material available given the premise and setting is so rich. "Life" is
primarily a comedy; those who want a far better version of `the message'
should watch (or read) "The Shawshank Redemption," Stephen King's seminal
prison tale. The broad stereotypes that work so well to build comedy are
exactly why the drama fails to register.</P>
<P>Running just shy of two hours, "Life" isn't exactly a life
sentence, but it is very slow-paced in all the wrong places. Much of the
bathroom humor (and language) wears thin; why some of those slow spots
weren't filled with original jokes, or character development, remains a
mystery. Even the outtakes, shown at the end of the film with the credits,
are funnier than some of what was used in the movie proper.</P>
<P>"Life" has a few bright spots, scattered randomly throughout the
rest of the film. Wait for the home video release, and make a game out of
trying to find them. It'll be at least as entertaining as the rest of the
movie.</P>
