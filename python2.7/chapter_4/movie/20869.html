<PRE>Every Family has a Video Camera
The Celebration</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Gritty, grainy, shot with available light and a video camera -- so it looks
like your family videos. Although, I do hope this isn't your family.</P>
<P>And no doubt, directed a heck of a lot better than your videos. Vinterberg
(director) whips his little vid cam around like it's taped to the remote
control toy car from a "Home Alone" film.</P>
<P>The story follows Christian, a full grown man with childhood issues yet to
resolve, as he changes the tone of this family celebration.</P>
<P>"The Celebration" showcases excellent acting, a great screenplay, and new
innovative cinematography that is exciting and exhausting at the same time.</P>
<P>Directed and co-written by: Thomas Vinterberg (Vinterberg is a member of a
collective of film directors (Dogme 95) who oppose the auteur concept,
make-up, illusions and dramaturgical predictability; letting 'the inner
lives of the characters justify the plot.')
In Danish with English subtitles.</P>
