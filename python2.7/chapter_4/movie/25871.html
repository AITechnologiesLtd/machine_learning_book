<P>At some point during the late 90s, every guy and his credit card slapped
together a film about how he and his friends scored (or tried to score) with
girls. SWINGERS was the ultimate "guy" movie for me, a film that gave you a
true insight as to how guys feel when asking girls out and what rejection is
like. It was also very, very funny and contained great dialogue! Many other
films failed to deliver the quality writing and acting that SWINGERS did,
and today, another film has tried to once again, to give us an even wider
glimpse into the world of "picking up"- guy style! Of course, the angle with
this movie is that the guys will ultimately be challenged by a woman, who
for all they know, is also playing their "game". So who's gonna end up on
top? Read on...</P>
<P>PLOT:
Three single college buddies and their married friend get together at a
diner every Sunday to discuss their weekly conquests with women. They
generally give their best "scamming" stories and pat one another on the
back. That is until they all happen to really fall for the same girl named
Mia. Now in competition with one another, the trio of bachelors suddenly
find themselves at the other end of the "playa" game.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Lots of laughs, interesting characters and plenty of dirty detailed insight
into the world of "dating" raise this flick above all the other "talking
heads" movies and require that anyone who is riding the "single" scene check
it out. And despite a certain feeling of deja-vu, this film does move along
nicely, delivers a cool soundtrack and for once, gives us a little more
insight into the women's point of view. I personally enjoyed much of this
film because I was in that "single" scene for years on end, and related to
many of the humorous anecdotes presented here. We've all got that one friend
who liked to "play" it, another intellectual type who always thought that he
was God's gift to women and the other guy who just masturbated a whole lot.
I'll say this much...I definitely wasn't the "playa" in my own scenario!
Anyway, I really liked the dialogue in this film as well, most of which rang
funny and true, especially in tandem with the succinct delivery put forth by
most of the actors in the film.</P>
<P>And that's another thing that I really liked. All of the personalities in
the film weren't part of this generic ball of "guy". Each dude actually had
his own personality traits and the actors played off each other really well.
Mind you, the thespianism was a tad off during a couple of confrontational
scenes between the fellas and I suppose some would fault the film for going
for the easy toilet humor at times, but I was personally entertained by much
of it. It certainly isn't a grand film making a major statement, but a small
film with just a little insight into the crappy ass world of dating in this
day and age. Credit Amanda Peet for delivering yet another charming
performance and Judah Domke for having some of the funniest lines in the
movie, as the one guy in the crew who is "happily" married. Don't go into
this movie expecting to see a lot of sex because it's not there. What is
there is a pretty funny little tale about guys and girls and the "games"
that they like to play with one another. It's not romantic and it's not
sexy, but it's definitely got some yucks and should be a definite tool of
the trade for those still in the dating world. Oh yeah and
incidentally...the reason that I am no longer in the dating world myself is
because...I'm whipped!!! :)</P>
