<P>If you've heard of Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, and their old 
"beach party" movies from the 1960's, such as 65's "Beach Blanket 
Bingo," then you know the definition of the word corny. Those beach 
films may have been kinda fun and harmless, but they were also 
undeniably dumb. Then in 1987, Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello 
returned to their "beach party" movies, and made the best film they 
could have possibly done.</P>
<P>"Back to the Beach" stars Avalon and Funicello, playing their screen 
images, as a married couple living in Ohio. Avalon seems to have lost 
his spontaneity and is now an uptight car dealer, while Funicello is a 
spunky housewife who has an obsession with peanut butter. Together, they 
have two kids, a daughter, Cindi (Lori Loughlin) in her early twenties 
living in Malibu, and a teenage son named Bobby (Demian Slade) who 
dresses like a punk. At the start of the film, they realize that they 
desperately need a vacation, so while on their way to Hawaii, they stop 
over in Malibu to see Cindi, not knowing that her fiance (Tommy 
Hinckley) is living with her on a pier at the beach. After they get 
there, Annette and Frankie get in a fight when he meets up with an old 
pal from the beach, Connie Stevens, and appears to be having more fun 
with her. Figuring into the story are various musical numbers, a surfing 
contest, and, yes, beach parties.</P>
<P>By hearing the premise, "Back to the Beach" may sound exactly like 
Funicello's and Avalon's old movies, but it is not at all. "Back to the 
Beach," in fact, is one of the most entertaining comedy musicals I have 
ever seen, and is one of those movies that can be watched over and over 
(and I've seen it many times, to be sure).</P>
<P>One of the biggest surprises of the film is that the movie is a little 
bit more edgy than expected. Funicello and Avalon are good sports, and 
actually satirize their images to humorous effect. Funicello, especially, is 
so purely good and sweet that she is absolutely entertaining to watch. 
Stealing the opening scenes of the film is Demian Slade, who is hilarious 
as their punk son. Remarking about his parent's dim-witted conversations, he
observes, "It's like a conversation at the Kissinger's."</P>
<P>The music in "Back to the Beach" is perhaps the main star of the 
picture, and every song is memorable and fun to listen to. The musical 
numbers are also well choreographed and they give off a lot of spark and 
joy. </P>
<P>"Back to the Beach" is, by no means, a deep and thought-provoking motion 
picture. It knows that it is only a "beach" movie, and it makes the most 
of it by adding a winning, lightweight screenplay, charming performances 
by the whole cast, a delightful array of cameos (ranging from Barbara 
Billingsley to David Bowie to Pee Wee Herman), and some great music. And 
when you're dealing with Frankie and Annette, what more could you ask 
for?</P>
