<PRE>               A film review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>Scheduled to open on December 20th is the comedy/drama 'One Fine Day'
starring Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney.  I had the opportunity to
view this movie in advance on the evening of December 5th here in my
hometown through various established contacts and I can tell you right now
that there's no need to hold your breath.  The movie is set in New York
City and Pfeiffer and Clooney star as the parents of kindergarten aged
children who arrive one morning escorting their offspring to school and
they are late and the class has already left for their scheduled field
trip.  She is an architect on the verge of a major promotion within her
company and he is a high profile journalist working on the most important
story of his life.  They are forced to juggle the needs of their children
and their careers and are inadvertently thrown together for ONE FINE DAY
of course meaning it will be one of the most chaotic and alarming days in
memory as they must bring small children to work with them!  Unfortunately
you can't build a film with a running time of 108 minutes simply around a
premise.  The premise must expand into plot and develop gears to get off
the ground.  This film never does that and I looked at my watch at
precisely the 24 minute mark which is a bad sign.  Clooney, who has struck
gold on television's 'ER' and who is presently shoooting next summer's
'Batman and Robin' in which he will star as the caped crusader is the only
character with some interesting aspects.  He makes the most of a
repetitive script by adding an easy going charm and likeability while
Pfeiffer suffers badly in a role that gives working women a bad name and
really makes them the target of male chauvanism.  The film plays more like
a network television movie rather than a big screen Hollywood presentation
and I was actually offended at the amount of unintended child neglect that
is associated with this film.  Michelle Pfeiffer is a remarkably talented
actress and gained breakthrough recognition and critical acclaim in 1983's
'Scarface' as Al Pacino's trashy and drug addicted wife.  Clooney has had
small success on the big screen but gained some surprisingly good notices
earlier this year for Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' as a
murdering escaped prisoner on the lam in Texas trying to make it to the
Mexican border with his sexually psychotic brother and a family he's taken
hostage.  Clooney was one of the most chilling and unrepenting bad guys in
recent memory in that movie which was indefensible garbage.  I would like
to see Clooney perform well in a good film instead of being the standout
character in really bad movie which has been happening a lot lately.  'One
Fine Day' even has the nerve to insult us by having its two leading
characters who hate each other at the beginning of the movie slowly fall
in love and bring us to a disappointing conclusion.  I've given away
nothing but what a cliche!</P>
