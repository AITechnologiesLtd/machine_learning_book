<P>This is one of the earlier Werner Herzog films, and it put both himself, and
Klaus Kinski, in the knowing, that they were around to stay.</P>
<P>Klaus Kinski had done many B rated films through out Europe, and had never
been able to acquire the respect he might have liked to have for a half way
decent actor ( even if his life is not ) and the quality of work he could
do, when given the chance.  Werner Herzog was a perfect vehicle, because it
allowed Klaus to experiment and Werner to just shoot many rushes, when the
actors don't know it.  For this reason, many of Werner Herzog films, have
characters which are well developed, but also show an inclination to do one
or two things that don't seem to fit, but they work.  Such is the price for
improvisation on an expensive medium.  Add libbing is often a better answer
than a temperamental writer, or worse yet, a temperamental actor, which
Klaus is, if the special (shown occasionally on PBS) on Fitzcarraldo is any
indication.  However, the continuity of the character is better, thus
showing a side of the actor, which is not always found in the pre meditated
and over studied acting styles.</P>
<P>Aguirre, the Wrath of God  is a good film, if you happen to like to see an
endless jungle, full of green-ery, mystery, and secret noises, and spaces.
Accompanying this visual film is the music of the German group POPOL VUH,
whose music is moody, very well defined, and well applied.  The music for
this film was around, before the film was made, which suggests that the
director took the feel of the music and built a scene around it.  The
perfect example is the opening of the film, when the music has a sad
somberness to it, which is filled with an incredibly beautiful long shot of
the Amazon jungle from a distance, with its fog moving in slow portions
across a very large valley.  Underneath, is the river, and Aguirre on his
raft, running into the side of the river in the fog.  The mystery, may be
infused with blindness after all.</P>
<P>Aguirre is the story of the Spanish explorer who went up the Amazon river to
find Eldorado.  He never reached that far, and disappeared totally, nothing
of his voyage, raft, or belongings was ever found.  The myths and legends
say that the Indians killed him, which the film plays to the hilt.  By the
time Aguirre arrived in the deep Amazon, many of the tribes had already been
alerted to the evils of the 'white man in a hard robe' as the Guayacu
Indians described the old Spaniards in their armors.  However, there is also
a story that he did arrive at the higher plateaus of Peru and decided to
stay there forever,  for he found the area beautiful beyond belief, which
the film also plays on.</P>
<P>In between this slow moving, but beautifully shot film, Aguirre tries to
withstand the common ailments which befell those who tried to navigate an
incredibly difficult river to maneuver, due to its size, and chaotic waters.
He manages to survive until the end, when the arrows of the Indians finally
have done in all the menders of the raft.  The film ends with the raft
moving downriver, bumping into a few rocks, turning, and moving down another
slow stream, until it fades out of existence.  The camera pans upwards to
the sky and the film ends.</P>
<P>It isn't a great film, by any means, but it establishes what Werner Herzog
will perfect in the later film NOSFERATU , which is a cohesion of music and
visual style.  Aguirre, though a curious film, is not an enjoyable film,
though we may learn a line or two of history while watching it.</P>
<P>Only for film addicts, and art film students.</P>
<P>Still, it is a good film.  Has little dialogue, except for Aguirre's
meanderings and fantasies.  It is the study of one man's obsession.</P>
