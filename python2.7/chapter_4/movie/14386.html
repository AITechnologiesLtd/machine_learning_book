<PRE>A Film Review by Mark O'Hara</PRE>
<P>There is enough dysfunction among the Gulden family members to fill the 
plotlines of two or three television dramas for an entire season.  What 
makes the film refreshing and watchable is that the director does not 
over-reach in portraying emotional moments.  Never does the film fall 
into unforgivable sentimentality;  never does it sketch a character in 
purely black or white.</P>
<P>Director Carl Franklin's toughest task must have been getting right the 
terrible and delicate shadowing in the backgrounds of the characters' 
lives.  The Gulden family has so much going for it - a Victorian mansion 
an hour or so outside of  New York City, a house made perfect and 
picturesque by Kate (Meryl Streep).  There is Kate's husband George 
(William Hurt), owner of a National Book Award, respected essayist and 
chair of the English Department at Langhorne College, no Harvard but a 
respectable small pond.  The Guldens' two children are Brian (Tom 
Everett Scott), a college student, and Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a 
Harvard grad and rising writer at a New York magazine.  When Ellen's 
cancer intrudes suddenly on their lives, and George asks Ellen to resign 
her responsibilities in the City and care for her mother, the story 
unfolds and the emotions unload.</P>
<P>It's a safe guess that Meryl Streep did not require much coaching.  She 
is brilliant, her angular features shining in her Dorothy costume (she 
even clicks her ruby-slippered heels!) that she sports for her husband's 
birthday party.  So much of Streep's acting is subtle, telegraphing her 
character's thoughts and making so many words unnecessary.  Streep 
should be a shoo-in for another Oscar nomination.  Although Ellen seems 
very put off by her mother's domestic prowess, she is forced by 
necessity to assume her mother's household duties.  This mother-daughter 
relationship is the key one in the story.  Two of the film's most 
wrenching scenes feature these women:  one at a  town gathering - 
perfectly accented by a lingering camera shot;  the other in Kate's 
bedroom, a cathartic scene that is at once a confession and an 
absolution.  Here Carl Franklin demonstrates his timing, intuition and 
experience.</P>
<P>In the novel on which the film is based, Anna Quindlen crafts Ellen as a 
remote intellectual, looking down her nose at her housebroken mother, 
while looking up at her writer-god father.  Zellweger fills in this role 
well.  She is wonderful in scenes involving a disastrous meal;  
notwithstanding, Ellen is inducted into her mother's women's group, the 
"Minnies."  Ellen's reluctance slowly gives way not only to an 
acceptance of the hard housework, but to an appreciation of Kate's 
diligence in keeping the Gulden family running so smoothly.  For much of 
the film Zellweger, stone-faced, watches her parents' lives altered for 
good.  When it counts, though, she delivers "the right thing to do."</P>
<P>The screenplay, by Karen Croner, preserves much of Quindlen's clever 
dialogue.  It also adds new pieces that portray the characters in bleak 
lighting.  For instance, Professor George Gulden comes off as pompous, a 
phony who relies on a couple of quotes, one stolen, to impress his 
listeners.  Also added are memory strobes in which Ellen remembers her 
younger father, full-bearded, buying her ice cream and carrying her atop 
his shoulders.  It's not difficult to admire a film that takes even 
minor risks, like these flashbacks.  William Hurt's George is just as 
complex as Ellen.  His actions are often detestable, unthinkable for a 
man whose wife is terminally ill.  But we also see qualities that go a 
long way toward redeeming him, and in the end we witness George and 
Ellen sharing a remarkable epiphany.</P>
<P>Symbolism in the picture is noticeable but not heavy-handed.  We follow 
the seasons from fall through a dreary winter.  In an uncharacteristic, 
medication-induced rage, Kate shatters plates whose pieces Ellen later 
uses in a mosaic project started by her mother.  Finally, mother and 
daughter switch roles.  Together with other moving scenes, the product 
is a fine adaptation of Quindlen's compassionate work.</P>
<P>If not for the uttering of a forbidden word three times, this R-rated 
film may have been a more accessible PG.  (Even if the word were 
included one time, wouldn't there be a PG-13 rating?)  There is no 
nudity, only brief references to sex, certainly no violence.  Many 
children will miss a well-drawn drama about a family, because someone 
decided not to sacrifice verbal realism.  Oh, well.</P>
