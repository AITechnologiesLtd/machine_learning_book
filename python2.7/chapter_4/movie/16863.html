<P>Wasn't it George Bernard Shaw who said that "America and England are two
nations separated by a common language"?  Little Voice, set entirely in a
seaside town of Northern England (Scarborough was used) and among working
class people (even if they don't work) is linguistically one more addition
to the UK. filmmakers' passion for cockney, regional, plebeian and other
accents that are a far cry from BBC or Oxbridge English.</P>
<P>American ears strain, viewers ask their neighbors "What did she say?" and
much of the dialogue is lost. That's why some films have had re-recorded
sound tracks for export, or, in the case of the great Ken Loach's Riff-Raff
and his current My Name is Joe, were subtitled--in English.</P>
<P>It's not all that bad with LV (Little Voice) because the speeches are not
deathless. One also gradually gets over some of the talk hurdles as the
movie unreels.</P>
<P>The film is based on a much-liked play especially written for Jane Horrocks
(of TV's Absolutely Fabulous), specifically to showcase her unquestionable
talent for voice and above all song imitations.</P>
<P>Brenda Blethyn plays widow Mari, a motor-mouth tarty tippler with a
piggly-wiggly neighbor for best friend and colleague at the fish market.
Mari's daughter is a young woman, LV, a kind of recluse in the modest
home's attic. She's modern only in one respect, being--what
else?--dysfunctional in an odd way. Since the death of her dad (when, I
cannot tell), she has inherited his collection of recordings, mostly of
American pop and Hollywood songs. She plays them by the hour, looks up at
Daddy's photograph, puts more records on the player.</P>
<P>One would think she is a mute, until incidents such as the electricity
(hence the machine) going out, make her burst out in amazing vocal copies
of Judy Garland, Edith Piaf, Shirley Bassey, Billie Holiday, Marilyn
Monroe, Ethel Merman, Marlene Dietrich, Barbra Streisand and more.</P>
<P>A small-time promoter named Ray Say (Michael Caine at his Cockney best) who
seems to have hit bottom, in spite of his big, red, American convertible,
has been among the many lovers of Mari. He comes to town on business,
engages in carnal preliminaries with the ardent Mari, but gets distracted
by hearing LV's voice. "Eureka!" he exclaims, "we all got it made!" (Not
his specific words but that's the general drift).</P>
<P>He sets out to convince and cajole the more-than-reluctant LV to sing in
public. This, of course, is what we're all waiting for. But it takes about
the first 45-50 minutes of the movie to get there. Even then, it's just a
try-out that panics the shy girl. It will be another 20 minutes until she
appears on a stage, doing a beautiful, impressive selection and, in an
unlikely way, having already mastered showbiz garb (a clinging sequined
dress), manners, gestures, body-English.</P>
<P>The rest of the story is just a frame for LV. Generic, with a number of
nice or interesting or semi-eye catching or indifferent bits, by and large
it's nothing to sing about.</P>
<P>The performers are very good. Michael Caine cannot be otherwise.   Brenda
Blethyn, that-woman-you'd-like-to-shut-up, shows a new aspect of her
talent. A notable UK stage and TV actress, she came to films in The Witches
(1990), played the Rev.Maclean's wife in A River Runs Through It (1992),
zoomed to fame and prizes for Secrets and Lies (1996). She's been in
movie-demand ever since.</P>
<P>Rising young star Ewan McGregor (Shallow Grave, A Life Less Ordinary, The
Pillow Book, etc.) was a lead in LV director-adapter's Mark Herman second
feature (this is his third), the charming Brassed Off.</P>
<P>Here McGregor has a smallish role as a telephone repairman who falls, for
whatever reason (shyness in common?) for the girl. At the end, in the Fall
of LV (not tragic) he takes her up where he keeps pigeons. These fly way,
symbolizing freedom, just as Marlon Brando's did in On The Waterfront.</P>
<P>The singing is the main reason to see the picture. I am also pleased by the
British affection for old songs, mostly American. This places LV marginally
in the line of Terence Davies's splendid, moving autobiographical movies
about songs and films bringing solace to otherwise hard, somber
working-class existences: Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988) and The Long
Day Closes (1992)</P>
