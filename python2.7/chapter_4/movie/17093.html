<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> To be clear about things, this is what Shakespeare in Love is.  Shakespeare
in Love is a comedy of mistakes about one gentleman in Verona (or, in this
case, Elizabethan England) desperately trying to concoct Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter by the Twenty First Night.</P>
<P> Shakespearean puns aside, Shakespeare in Love actually does center about a
young William Shakespeare (Joseph Finnes), righting a play on assignment
known as Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, in a period of no less than
three weeks.  However, he is making much bother about something: the fact
that William Shakespeare, one of history's most prolific playwrights, has
writer's block.</P>
<P> In former times, he was able to enjoy himself in adulterous fashion with
everyone from the tired wives of Halifax to Othellina, the Mooress of
Venice.  Not one of the eight wives of Henry VII can do a bloody thing to
complain about this lover.</P>
<P> Now, however, he is Hamlet, serf of Sweden with his beloved Ophellia.  He
has no inspiration, only angst.  He does not like it as it is. This is,
however, until he finds himself smitten with Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth
Paltrow).  This temptress causes an emotional tempest.</P>
<P> But, keeping with the pilgrim's passion, he lusts after a woman engaged (do
I hear Prince Paris in the wings?), this time to Lord Wessex (played by
Colinn Firth, who lost another girlfriend to a Fiennes boy in The English
Patient).  Lord Wessex comes across with all of the charm of Yiago,
Othellina's trusted friend, but he does it in such a funny way that you have
to love him.</P>
<P> In fact, you have to love the entire movie.  The way that you see the
evolution of Romeo and Ethel evolve into Romeo and Juliet while a similar
play is being shown in their lives is a perfect postmodern device: used
before and equally well with Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, the
highly satiric and intelligent play that launched Tom Stoppard onto the
literary scene by telling the story of Hamlet from the view of the friends
sent to spy upon him.</P>
<P> Hey!  I went a paragraph without using a pun!  I'm going to my myself
something from the merchant of Paris!</P>
<P> The performances are worth writing sonnets about and put Caesar Augustus to
shame, one of them already having earned a Golden Globe for Best Actress
(Paltrow) and the movie is magical to watch.</P>
<P> What is most interesting to watch, however, is the shrew taming that
Stoppard demonstrates over his script.  Equally included are postmodern
devices and plain old storytelling.   Grounding humor mixed in with things
King Richard the First and Fourth could have been proud of, not to mention
any of the Henrys.   Almost every line is tainted with Shakespearean
reference.  So, when you see someone laughing their head off for almost no
reason, let them: there probably isn't an un-funny line in the script.</P>
<P> In fact, there are equally many lines there for just anyone.  The way it
opens has Geoffrey Rush bartering a deal with a loan shark to save his feet
from coals.  It has funny quips like, when Shakespeare begins talking in
iambic pentameter, Rush saying "prose, please".</P>
<P> The fact is that Shakespeare in love is incredibly funny, incredibly
brilliant, incredibly beautiful.  It's exactly as I like it.  Next to Saving
Private Ryan I would have to call it the best film of the year, and boy is
it a close second.  Shakespeare buffs like myself will get all of the inside
jokes, non-Shakespeare fans will be swept off their feet by the love story
and by the humor that they'll get.  Everyone will enjoy, from Timon of the
New York City Homeless Shelter to the King of Lears, Bill Gates.</P>
<P> It doesn't even have an unhappy ending!  But I can't tell you much more
except this: all that ends well  is well and that's the last pun you'll hear
in this summer's tale of a late winter's daydream.</P>
