<PRE>Grade: 90</PRE>
<P>What can be said about "Star Wars" that hasn't been
said already?  It finished its lengthy theatrical run
in 1977 as the highest grossing movie of all time,
then reclaimed that title with another massively
successful re-release in 1997.  The two films that
have replaced "Star Wars" atop the all-time Box Office
charts, "E.T. the Extra Terrestial" and "Titanic",
also relied heavily on special effects.  This was
the true impact of "Star Wars" and its many sequels:
it raised the bar for audience expectations of
blockbusters.  No longer was a great story sufficient,
as it was for "The Godfather" in 1972.</P>
<P>I doubt that anybody reading this hasn't seen the
film, but a plot summary is obligatory.  Luke Skywalker
(Mark Hamill) is an excitable, idealistic young man
who lives with his 'uncle' as a farmer on the remote
planet of Tatooine.  He hungers for adventure, and
gets his wish when he encounters Obi-Won Kenobi
(Alec Guinness).  Kenobi endeavors to train him as
a Jedi, a master of a universal 'force' that can be
used for good or evil.</P>
<P>Skywalker and Kenobi hire Han Solo (Harrison Ford),
who is a mercenary with a heart of gold, to help
deliver 'death star' plans stored in the robot
R2-D2.  Solo's sidekick is 'walking carpet'
Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and R2-D2's sidekick is
comic relief C-3PO (Anthony Daniels).  Along the
way our heroes rescue beautiful but independent
Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of
imposing, panting Darth Vader (voiced by James
Earl Jones).</P>
<P>"Star Wars" is refreshingly innocent, lacking
the cynicism common to 1970s films.  With its
good versus evil theme, it is easy to criticize
the story as simplistic.  But the plot is
elaborate, and the depth of the main characters
has been underrated.  Luke, for instance, may
be a goody-goody, but his boundless faith in
Kenobi and his unjaded enthusiasm for adventure
is winning.</P>
<P>As far as genre goes, the "Star Wars" series seems
derived principally from "Flash Gordon" 1930s serials,
albeit with far greater production values.  But
the thrills of the old serials are lost on adults,
who can see through the hokey script and sets, while
only the most stubbornly snobbish viewer can disregard
the magic of "Star Wars".  Except for a gratuitous
awards ceremony at films end, this is one blockbuster
that really delivers.</P>
<P>"Star Wars" received 11 Academy Awards, winning
in all the technical categories (sets, score, sound,
editing, costumes) but losing in the major
categories (Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay,
Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Guiness)).</P>
