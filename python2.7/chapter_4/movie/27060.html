<PRE>"Yi-Yi"</PRE>
<P>NJ Jian (Wu Nienjen) is at a mid-life crossroads but doesn't know it. His
family suffers through one crisis after another and his business,
prosperous only a year ago, is on the brink of bankruptcy. He is beginning
to question the direction his life has taken when he has a chance encounter
with Sherry (Ke Suyun), his first love and the girl he left behind, without
a word, decades ago. But, this is just the beginning of the stories of the
people who populate the family drama from Taiwan, director Edward Yang's
"Yi-Yi."</P>
<P>The "normal" problems of NJ's existence are further complicated on the day
(a fortuitous one according to the almanac) his debt-ridden brother-in-law,
A-Di (Chen Xisheng), gets married to the very pregnant Xiao Yan (Xiao
Shushen). The wedding, a raucous affair, is disrupted with the appearance
of Yun-Yun (Zeng Xinyi), A-Di's jilted girlfriend. NJ and his wife, Min-Min
(Elaine Jin), are suddenly called away from the reception when they learn
that Min-Min's mother collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.</P>
<P>Grandma (Tang Ruyun) is sent home, in a coma, to be cared for by her
family. Although it is unlikely that she will recover, the doctor
encourages the other family members to talk to the unconscious grandmother
because, maybe, she can hear them. Min-Min can't take the strain as she
comes to realize that her life is wasted - "I tell grandma about my day and
it only takes a minute," she bemoans as she runs off to seek the guidance
of her spiritual teacher, the Master. Her children, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee)
and Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), also have problems talking to the silent
grandma. Ting-Ting blames herself for grandma's mishap, while Yang-Yang
refuses to talk to his grandmother at all.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, NJ is trying to save his stagnant company and it is suggested
that he and his partners team up with a brilliant Japanese games designer,
Ota (Issey Ogata). NJ is chosen to wine and dine the innovator and a fast
friendship develops between the two men. But, the plans they make are soon
subverted by NJ's partners who make a deal with a Taiwan tycoon, Boss
Huang, and opt to use pirated software rather than the quality product that
Ota can provide.</P>
<P>While all this is going on, Ting-Ting begins a romance with Fatty after he
tells her he is no longer dating Lili (Adrian Lin), Ting-Ting's new
neighbor and friend. Eight year old Yang-Yang gets in trouble at school and
has no one to turn to with mom in the mountains and dad trying to save his
business. Little Yang-Yang also harbors a crush on a pretty classmate who
swims. A-Di's investment manager has gone broke and fled the country,
leaving the luckless A-Di with nothing. Yun-Yun still feels she has control
over A-Di and crashes the couple's baby shower. Xiao Yan later finds A-Di
unconscious in a gas filled bathroom. Is it by accident or by design?</P>
<P>NJ, thinking the deal with Ota is genuine, heads to Tokyo for more
discussion and, coincidentally, to meet Sherry. His jilted lover still
carries a torch for the handsome, taciturn NJ, but he tells her, during a
private interlude, that he does not have those feelings anymore. He left
her, decades before, because he could not tell her, then, that she and her
mother were stifling him and forcing him down a path not wanted. Ongoing,
also, are the underhanded dealings of NJ's partners as Boss Huang forms an
"alliance" with the sexy owner of the knock off company and drives NJ's
business further down. On the home front, Ting-Ting is summoned from school
and learns that Fatty has attacked and brutally murdered a tutor who has
been having an affair with Fatty's old lover, Lili, and her mother.</P>
<P>There is even more going on in this epic-scoped soap opera of the life of
an extended family than what I have already described. The complex story,
written by helmer Yang, is a rich mining of the emotions, needs and desires
of normal people. Far from creating larger-than-life beings whose problems
are loftier than those for us mere mortals, the world of "Yi-Yi" teams with
average folk with very human flaws. At the center is NJ, a quiet,
intelligent man who is comfortable in his reserve. He learned, early in his
life, to go after what he wanted, not what was expected of him. As his
family faces their own crises, NJ, from the time he spent with the
deep-thinking Ota, relearns the lessons of life, once again taking matters
into his own hands.</P>
<P>With NJ as the anchor of "Yi-Yi" (English title is "A One and a Two?"), the
rest of the players are given free reign on their individual tales of love,
sadness, pain and pleasure. Some stories, like NJ and Ota and NJ and
Sherry, are more compelling than the others, but they are all intriguing in
their own way. This is one of those rare films, with a run-time of 173
minutes, which you beg to continue when the credits start to roll. Edward
Yang ties things up nicely at the end, but his storytelling is so masterful
that you want to see what happens next in this elegant family drama.</P>
<P>Capitalizing on the rich screenplay is the textured, beautifully composed
photography by Yang Weihan who frames every shot like a gorgeous
photograph. Helmer Yang uses the extended, near silent photography to allow
us to linger on the images up on the screen. It's almost like a leisurely
stroll in an art gallery to gander at the works of a master. The languid
pace afforded the wonderful cinematography pads the running time
considerably, but is such a visual pleasure you don't notice the time. The
visual impact of the film is key to its overall high quality. Of course,
production design, costume, the brilliant use of colors to change the films
mood and the rest of the techs all contribute to this superior work.</P>
<P>The vast ensemble cast revolves around Wu Nienjen as NJ. The screenwriter
turned actor/director plays the strong, silent type here, but a man with a
great deal of emotion and feeling under his inscrutable surface. The
terrific cast around him is too numerous to catalogue, but they all give
solid performances right down to little Yang-Yang, whose final speech over
grandma's casket tells it all. From the mouths of babes?.</P>
<P>"Yi-Yi" is a true universal film that has appeal across cultural and racial
boundaries as it tells its stories of the day-to-day lives and plights of
normal people in normal, and sometimes not-so-normal, times as they cope
with life's difficulties, both large and small. Kudos to Edward Yang with
his Taiwan-contender for Best Foreign Film this year. I give it an A.</P>
