<P>Today you're the toast of the town, tomorrow you're just 
toast. That's what happens to popular TV and stand-up comedian 
Ellen DeGeneres in her first feature role.</P>
<P>Actually, past a dumb giveaway opening scene that leads to a 
long flashback, the start of "Mr. Wrong" is at least as funny 
as the thought of certain people as US President.  Martha 
(DeGeneres), 31, a talent coordinator for a local TV talk 
show, is at her younger sister's wedding. Even when unspoken, 
the pressure by family and friends to have Martha find her own 
Mr. Right permeates the air. Martha however, professionally 
content and personally well-balanced, is acceptably happy as a 
single. She bides her time. There are good nuances in her 
portrait. </P>
<P>Cut to some amusing office scenes, notably of Martha's much 
younger assistant  Walter who keeps courting her. Cut to 
lonely Martha's date with a yoyo who brags:"I can  sell ovens 
to Eskimos." Nonplussed Martha: "I think the usual expression 
is freezers." He, puzzled: "What would they need them for?" 
And on her doorstep he asks: "Give me a French kiss." Ugh.</P>
<P>The future suddenly materializes in the person of  Whitman 
Crawford (Pullman), met cute (but not too) around a jukebox 
playing the Hank Williams oldie "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" 
(performed by Chris Isaak). Before you can say Valentine's 
Day, they're having a hot affair. The morning after, at the 
office, her best friend breathlessly inquires "Did you? Did 
he? Did he?"--1990s coded language for safe sex.  </P>
<P>Martha is in seventh heaven with Whitman's  devotion, 
classiness and gentleness. He writes poetry (he recites some 
gibberish to her in a funny scene) and, as we learn later, 
gets from a trust $50,000 a month. </P>
<P>When he takes her to see his mother (Joan Plowright)  
weirdness begins to set in. When Martha innocently tells him 
"I want you to be yourself," this turns out to be as drastic 
as pressing the red missile-launching button. Whitman drops 
what we realize was a fake persona and does become himself. 
No, he's no serial killer but a total loony who does odd and 
tasteless things, and desperately wants to marry Martha. In 
turn, she now desperately wants out.</P>
<P>So far, so good. But the movie takes a sudden dive past the 
first 35-40 minutes and keeps shedding ratings stars. The 
balance is devoted to Whitman's relentless pursuit and 
stalking of Martha. </P>
<P>Unreasonably jealous, Whitman's previous girlfriend Inge 
(Cusack) aided by a fat, hopeless suitor, menaces Martha whom 
Whitman keeps showering with gifts and unwelcome attentions. 
"Mr. Wrong" becomes tedious though not awful (yet), given its 
small ambitions. But after a second plunge it smashes itself 
flat on the pavement.  Meandering, incoherence, confusion and 
stupidity turn fun into fiasco.</P>
<P>Much is wrong with "Mr. Wrong." The direction, hesitant and 
uneven from the start, worsens exponentially. The 
concocted-by-committee scenario gets even more painful. One of 
the scripters had done the "Bill & Ted" flicks. The other two 
are first-timers. Past the initial impetus, the trio grope in 
the dark, have no idea where to go next, fail to find a single 
acceptable development, gag or line.</P>
<P>The plot includes some name performers given either 
microscopic walk-on parts (Goulet) or a small, wasted ones 
(Plowright, Stockwell, TV "Alice"'s Holliday).  </P>
<P>Criminally idiotic is the role of the usually incomparable 
Joan Cusack, slated in my book for the Thelma Ritter Award.  
Criminally cruel is the way DeGeneres is photographed. The 
very fact that she is no movie beauty should have been worked 
on to show us a real person, a change from bimboids. It is 
pure technical sloppiness. Look at Robert Redford in 
newscasts, then at his younger, well made-up and shot, 
transformed face in the previews of his new film.</P>
<P>Coming close to being right in "Mr. Wrong" are a) the natural 
rapport between DeGeneres and Best Friend  Ellen Cleghorne, a 
black actress, and b) the perfect normalcy of older women 
having affairs with younger men. Alas, both notions are way 
underdeveloped, and the second is botched up by the asinine 
ending. </P>
<P>Perhaps theaters ought to screen only the first section, for 
two thirds off tickets. </P>
