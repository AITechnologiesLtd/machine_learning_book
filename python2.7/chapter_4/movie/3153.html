                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The familiar story of the feral child
          and civilization discovering each other is given a
          very polished and generally intelligent treatment
          by Michael Apted.  Beautiful Smokey Mountain
          photography and some very good performances make
          the first two-thirds very watchable.  The last
          third is disappointingly familiar.  Rating: +2 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In the back woods of the Great Smokey Mountains of North Carolina
an old hermit woman dies.  When a  policeman (played by Nick Searcy)
and a doctor, Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson) come to investigate and tidy
up the loose ends, they find a loose end nobody knew about.  The woman
had a daughter Nell (Jodie Foster) who had lived virtually without
human contact and who spoke a completely unintelligible language.  Nell
has been raised to fear people and her reaction to these invaders is
pure panic.  Lovell brings in a second doctor, Paula Olsen (Natasha
Richardson), little realizing that he is sowing the seeds of a three-
way battle for the fate of Nell.  One faction will want her to remain
in the wild, one will want to study her in an institution, and both
will want to keep her out of the hands of the media who want to exploit
her.  Deep in the woods Lovell and Olsen competitively initiate studies
to understand Nell and the forces that made her what she is, to
decipher her language, and to ease her terror of strangers.</P>
<P>     Michael Apted is singularly appropriate to direct NELL.  Two of
the major themes of his film are how Nell's childhood has molded her
into the enigmatic woman that she is and how the outside world and
mainstream society are a corrupting influence.  Apted is the creator of
the 7 UP, 7 PLUS 7, 21 UP, 28 UP, and 35 UP documentaries, which are
released each seven years, examining at seven-year intervals the lives
of 14 people and how they develop.  He also directed GORILLAS IN THE
MIST, THUNDERHEART, and the documentary INCIDENT AT OGLALA, each of
which has a theme of the corruptive or exploitive influence of society
on the innocent.  Both themes are present in William Nicholson and Mark
Handley's adaptation of Handley's stage play "Idioglossia."  Nicholson,
incidentally also wrote the screenplay for SHADOWLANDS.  This story
also looks at two approaches to science: one that tries to study in
nature and one that prefers the laboratory approach, in vivo versus in
vitro.  In a violation of political correctness, unusual for Apted, the
nurturing scientist, who sets up a pup tent and tries forming a
relationship with Nell, is the man.  The woman scientist's approach is
to bring up a houseboat full of electronic equipment and to observe
Nell with surveillance cameras.</P>
<P>     The telling of the story is deliberate, like a scientific case
study.  For viewers who are not interested in the puzzle of
understanding Nell's behavior and her language, the film will be as
slow-paced as watching someone fill out a crossword puzzle or paint a
picture.  The writing requires at least a modicum of curiosity about
the reasoning of anthropologists and how they do their work.  Apted
takes a good long time before he starts talking down to his audience
and moving the story in what are, unfortunately, some very predictable
directions.</P>
<P>     As time goes by Nell and her language become more understandable.
It is not entirely clear why this verbal fruit cocktail starts sounding
more comprehensible.  It is possible that the listener's ear becomes
more attuned to the language or that the more Nell is around people the
more she might start to imitate their speech patterns.  I suspect,
however, that the film is really a little less than honest by simply
having Foster's language written closer to spoken English in the later
parts of the film.</P>
<P>     Foster's acting in dramatic scenes is nearly perfect, though her
ecstatic, dance-like jaunts though nature seem a bit idealized.  Neeson
is compelling and sensitive.  Probably he is typecast as being
sensitive after playing Oskar Schindler.  Richardson comes in a fair
third for acting honors, but it is really Foster's movie.  Also
watchable is the photography of the Great Smokey Mountains, by Dante
Spinotti.  And  though it lacks the breathtaking spectacle of his work
for THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, his eye for the beauty of nature becomes
an intergal part of the film.</P>
<P>     This is not so much an original film as a familiar story done very
well.  Certainly it ranks among one of Apted's better dramatic films.
I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
