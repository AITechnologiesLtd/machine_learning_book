<P>This is quite simply the worst movie I have subjected myself to in a long
time.  I thought it couldn't fail because of the dandy cast of character
actors.  But I was wrong.  Very, very wrong.
The film opens with a cameraman, Mr. Knight, going along with a police raid
on a house being used as a drug drop.  The actor chosen to play Mr. Knight
was not a very good choice: he's so short that the 1" master video camera
he carries looks to be bigger than his torso.  And he staggers quite
perceptibly while carrying it.  Anyway, Knight manages to film the massacre
of all the policemen by some thugs led by David Warner (groovy character
actor #1).  Knight also films Warner driving away, and even has the GALL to
turn on his camera lights to make sure he gets the shot of him - and yet
Warner never notices!  What's the deal here?  Does Knight have an
invisibility shield or what?  Mr. Warner proceeds to blow up the house,
which goes kablooey in a rather interesting fashion - all the walls seem to
fly off in one piece, leaving the frame standing.  Is this a house
specially built to explode or what?  Anyway, Knight gets bunged up in the
explosion, but has his assistant/buddy, who looks a little bit like Bruce
Dern but isn't, promise to retrieve the all-important videotape.  Already
this film is exerting a paralyzing aura of utter boredom which is close to
stultifying - but wait, it gets WORSE.
Now David Warner is reporting to his boss, Lance Henriksen (groovy
character actor #2) about how he managed to overlook the cameraman filming
his illegal and heinous deeds.  Mr. Warner does not seem to give a very
good accounting for himself.  He looks bored.  Lance looks bored.  I am
bored.  I actually fantasized about pushing a button on my laserdisc remote
which could make the dialogue turn into what the actors were really
thinking:
Warner: "Boy this script is abominable.  And for that matter, so is that
shirt you're wearing, Lance."
Henriksen: "I couldn't agree with you more - I hate this shirt.  Let's go
kill our agents for arranging for us to appear in this dreck."
Warner: "Oh, what a charming idea.  Then let's flay the scriptwriter alive
and roll him (or her) in salt."
Henriksen:  "I'll bring the flensing knives."
Warner:  "I'll bring the amphetamines so they can't escape into
unconsciousness."
Warner & Henriksen: (together) "LET'S PARTY!"
The above discussion would have been more interesting than the sum total of
the film, believe me.  Warner never does say why he didn't see the
cameraman.  An interesting discussion might have been about how Warner was
blind as a bat but refused to acknowledge it.  Anyway, bad ol' Henriksen
wants the tape back.  
Now we cut to our two cops who are going to be the hero-type people.  They
are Charles Napier (groovy character actor #3) and Leo Rossi, who I do not
know but certainly has an interesting accent.  Mr. Rossi and Mr. Henriksen
are prominently featured on the front cover on the disc, so I assume that
Rossi is some sort of a groovy guy.  We are now approximately seven minutes
into the film, and I start leaning on the fast-forward button.  Even while
Charles Napier is talking, I am leaning.  This film is really starting to
get on my nerves.  
Mr. Knight in the hospital meets a pretty nurse (Ashley Laurence - groovy
character actor #4) and naturally goes ga-ga over her.  Who wouldn't?  But
while he's there, the two cops show up to question him about the
disappearance of the vital tape and substitution of a blank one.  Knight
plays dumb - not much of a stretch.  I actually managed to watch this scene
all the way through, mainly because two bad guys dressed as doctors were
drifting around and I was hoping for a fight in the hospital.
No such luck.  The hitmen shoot Knight's cabdriver and Knight takes off on
foot, eventually getting trapped in an alley after being shot in the arm. 
He rolls around in the garbage in a manner I found strangely attractive. 
Would be that the makers of this film had been rolling around with him. 
Anyway, Mr. Knight is about to be sent to his richly-deserved reward when
somebody blows away the assassins and zips off with Knight in a pickup
truck.  That person being - Joe Don Baker! (groovy character actor #5). 
Mr. Baker gives Knight a big chunk o' expository dialogue about the CIA,
drug running, internal investigations, and Knight jumps out of the truck. 
Who could blame him?  
Meanwhile, Knight's Bruce Dern look-alike buddy has made a copy of the tape
and sells it to Warner, only to be ambushed by a group of overweight men in
suits.  Who the suits were I have no idea - I'm still hittin' that
fast-forward button about once every three minutes.  The buddy gets a hole
blown in him, but lives long enough to crawl to Knight's house, where he
gracelessly expires.  Knight jumps out a window (or rather, a stuntman who
is at least six inches taller than the diminutive actor does) and is on the
run, with the cops thinking he killed his buddy.
Naturally, Knight runs to Ashley Laurence's house for protection.  And
wouldn't you?  She assaults him (alas, not sexually) with a tennis racket. 
And then --
Then I give up.  I don't care about the plot.  I don't care about the
characters.  There's a passel of great actors here and they aren't doing
shit with this boring rotten script and leaden direction.  I'd much rather
watch all these people sit around and talk for two hours about movies and
their lives and stuff than have to endure this film.  If the director had a
lick of sense he'd set up a camera in the caterer's truck and secretly film
the actors as they ate - I'd rather watch Lance Henriksen CHEW than watch
this movie.  I'd rather watch Joe Don Baker FART.  I'd rather watch David
Warner get the giggles, and MILK come out of his NOSE, than even pop this
disc in for a moment to double-check my plot points.  I found myself
gloating with every blow, pummel and scrape rained upon the heads of the
cast, wishing that those self-same pains could be inflicted in real life on
the casting director who put such good people into such a rotten film. 
Look, these actors could ad-lib a better movie than this!  Just cut out a
few of those really stupid car thingies where the car goes leaping up into
the air and falls over like a bowling pin for no discernible reason, and
you'll save enough money to do some rehearsals and rewriting and such.
Basically, I leaned on the fast-forward for the rest of the film, and
determined that evil was defeated, good triumphed, and there was a window
left open for a SEQUEL - NO, PLEASE NOOOOOO!
