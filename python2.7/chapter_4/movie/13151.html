<PRE>MULAN
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        There's good news and bad news about MULAN. The positive is 
that Disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness 
of POCAHONTAS and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and the 
childishness of HERCULES. On the other hand, the studio is pulling 
out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs, several steps down 
from the days of THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. But 
MULAN is a step in the right direction and Disney's best animated 
feature since THE LION KING.</P>
<P>        After giving Native Americans a turn in POCAHONTAS, Disney 
has decided to turn a movie over to the Asians. MULAN is set in feudal 
China and features the ever-popular Heroine Who Marches To A 
Different Drum And Wants To Do More With Her Life Than Get 
Married. That's what we find out when young Mulan (voice of Ming-
Na Wen) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a 
rogue cricket splash coffee all over her. Cartoons...</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, word comes from the emporer that one man from 
every family must join the army and help fight the Huns. Since 
Mulan's a girl, that means her decrepit old father must go. She pleads 
with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old Dad, but that kind of 
groveling and desperation brings shame on her family. That's Chinese 
culture for you... So imagine how embarrassed the family is the next 
day when they find Mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword 
and run off to join the army in his place. The movie in a nutshell is 
about the stuggles of being a woman in the army. It should have been 
called G.I. CHANG.</P>
<P>        Mulan calls on her ancestors for help. They decide to 
summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her, but a 
mini dragon named Mushu screws it up. Voiced by Eddie Murphy, 
Mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do 
more slapstick harm than good for their human charges. Murphy's 
performance is a direct descendent of Robin Williams in ALADDIN -- 
lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about 
how much fun they're going to have. You ain't never had a friend like 
Mushu.</P>
<P>        Speaking of songs, MULAN doesn't have too many of them, 
which is a plus with a story like this. Disney songs about war probably 
wouldn't go over too well ("Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to war I go..."), 
and the ones they do have aren't memorable. The best of the bunch, 
sad to say, is "Be a Man," the requisite Basic Training Montage song. 
Yes, even in medieval China, they had to run through that web of car 
tires before they were ready for battle. Sung by Donnie Osmond (a bad 
sign if ever there was one), "Be a Man" accompanies footage of 
Mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes. It makes me wonder, 
has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly? I 
only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a 
peppy montage.</P>
<P>        For the curious, Mulan does pass for a man in the army 
despite looking like a girl. All she does to transform herself is cut her 
hair to a sexy shoulder-length, talk macho and slap guys on the butt, 
as was male custom a thousand years ago in China. The deception 
fools everyone but the audience, who thinks she might be able to pass 
for a 12-year-old boy, at best. But she does manage to strike the 
biggest blows to the Hun army, led by a big, evil-eyed Attilla-looking 
monster. As a villain, the head of the Huns is menacing, evil and 
entirely forgettable. I saw the movie yesterday and I don't remember 
the man's name.</P>
<P>        Otherwise, MULAN is a good movie. The animation of the 
characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be, but there 
are some amazing battlefield shots. Eddie Murphy pulls off some good 
one-liners, as do other star voices like Harvey Fierstein and Pat 
Morita, the quintessential Asian movie star. Hell, George "Mr. Sulu" 
Takei does a voice in MULAN. You get the sense Disney said to 
themselves, "Alright, let's get out there and find us some Chinese 
Americans in Hollywood. Who can you think of?" "Well, there's Mr. 
Myagi..." "Good." "And Mr. Sulu." "Perfect. We've got ourselves a 
movie now." Soon Disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the 
colors of the wind.</P>
