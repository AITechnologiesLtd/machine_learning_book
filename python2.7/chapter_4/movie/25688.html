<PRE>BLESS THE CHILD
---------------</PRE>
<P>The Bethlehem star shines bright one Christmas and a child is born beneath it
on December 16.  Nurse Maggie O'Connor (Kim Basinger) arrives home a week
later to find her drug addicted sister Jenna (Angela Bettis, "Girl,
Interrupted") huddled in her doorway clutching a newborn which she abandons
with Maggie.  Six years later, during a string of child murders, she returns 
as the wife of Erik Stark, (Rufus Sewall, "Dark City") founder of The New Dawn, 
a Scientology-like organization for young drug addicts.  But Maggie discovers 
The New Dawn is really a front for Satanists looking for a special child in
"Bless the Child."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"Bless the Child" is the anti-"Omen."  It also borrows copiously from other
Satanic horror flicks such as "The Prophecy" and "The Exorcist." </P>
<P>The horror genre is a tough one to succeed in as can be seen by the enormous
amount of dreck one must sift through in order to find the gems.  With that
in mind, "Bless the Child" isn't all that bad, mostly due to it's unusual
emphasis on the good part of the 'good vs. evil' plot and some imaginative
special effects.  It's also derivative to the max, perfunctorily acted
(except for Sewell's over-the-top perf) and features some outright howlers
(of laughter, that is).</P>
<P>Cody (Holliston Coleman) is quiet to the point of being diagnosed as autistic
so attends a special (conveniently Catholic) school where she resuscitates
dead birds and makes votive candles burst into flame.  Her nightmares are
telepathetically shared with Aunt Maggie, who races to Cody's bedroom to
find the child held hostage by red-eyed rats while being leered at by the
gargoyle outside her window.  Cody's head banging incidents scare away
Maggie's dates.</P>
<P>Once Cody's snatched by Stark, Maggie crosses paths with FBI Agent John Travis
(Jimmy Smits), a former seminarian who's on the case of the murdered children
(all, like Cody, born on December 16).  He believes Stark's involved but needs
to prove it.  Maggie gets tips, follows them on her own and gets into 
enormous jams that Travis can then save her from.  Meanwhile Stark's trying
to 'turn' Cody to use her special powers for the dark side.  He tries to
convince her by lighting bums on fire and sweet talking her into jumping off
their building's roof, but she's not buying it.  The whole things ends on
Easter Eve in a gothic mansion where Cody must accept Satan or die.</P>
<P>Kim Bassinger frets a lot and Jimmy Smits looks earnest.  Sewell gets mileage
out of the freekiness of his lazy eye.  Holliston Coleman is quite believable
as the troubled Cody.  Lumi Cavazos ("Like Water for Chocolate") is luminous
as a nun.  Christina Ricci is wasted (both literally and figuratively) as
a former New Dawn goth chick.  Angela Bettis nicely traverses the road from 
strung out to brainwashed.  Ian Holm's nothing more than a classy credit, 
appearing in one unnecessary scene.  It's truly fun to see Dimitra Arlys again, 
(so good as the diner waitress who tries to kill Robert Redford in "The Sting") 
here playing the demonic nanny right out of "The Omen."</P>
<P>The screenplay adaptation (Tom Rickman, Clifford and Ellen Green) of Cathy
Cash Spellman's book contains a few nice touches.  Travis prays for help
and a janitor offers some encouraging words - when he leaves the dead lillies
on Travis' window sill are abloom again.  A pretty woman uses her umbrella
to open subway doors Maggie and Cody are running for, then is nowhere to
be seen when Maggie turns to offer thanks.  It also offers such idiocy as
a rescue attempt at a dentist's office and blatant ripoffs such as having
Maggie's housekeeper leave her rosary under Cody's pillow (straight out of
"The Exorcist").</P>
<P>The best thing about "Bless the Child" are the special effects by Glenn
Neufeld ("Terminator II") and Joel Hynek ("What Dreams May Come").  They
create demonic creatures which Maggie begins to see when evil is afoot.
Their hovering and skittering are truly creepy, some resembling the flying
monkeys of "The Wizard of Oz."</P>
<P>"Bless the Child" is mostly derivative junk, but its few novel touches 
are worth noting.</P>
