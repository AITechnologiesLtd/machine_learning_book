<P>     The Soundgarden song goes, "I'm looking California and feeling 
Minnesota."  In Steven Baigleman's FEELING MINNESOTA, the characters may 
be looking to Las Vegas, but they're still feeling Minnesota, which is 
where most of the movie takes place.</P>
<P>     I think my most frequent complaint about movies is that they're not 
original enough.  That's one accusation I won't be leveling at FEELING 
MINNESOTA, for, while this twisted romantic comedy is far from an 
example of perfect film making, it is quirky, offbeat, and highly 
original.  Take a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, set them down in a 
universe that feels like it was created by pop-culture wannabe-god 
Quentin Tarantino, and throw in dashes of THE STING, Dostoevsky, and the 
absurdist humor of MONTY PYTHON, and you still haven't quite got what 
FEELING MINNESOTA is offering.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Baigleman has cheerfully thrown all the formulas 
out the window.  I suppose it's possible to guess at the outcome of 
certain events, but, in general, this movie defies prediction.  Some of 
the twists are decidedly bizarre, but it's precisely because this movie 
is willing to take chances that I'm giving it a marginal recommendation.  
I'll admit that I didn't always feel comfortable watching FEELING 
MINNESOTA -- it's a gritty, grungy film with thoroughly dislikeable 
characters -- but I admired what Baigleman was trying to do, even when 
his attempts went astray.</P>
<P>     The opening of FEELING MINNESOTA introduces us to Freddie (Cameron 
Diaz), who, dressed in a wedding gown, is fleeing from her former boss, 
Red (Delroy Lindo), an underworld-type.  Red has plans to punish 
Freddie, who he believes stole $10,000 from him.  He's going to force 
her to marry his most loyal employee, Sam Clayton (Vincent D'Onofrio), 
because, in his words, "It's the worst thing I could think to do to 
you."  Despite the bride's reluctance, the ceremony takes place.  In 
attendance is Sam's younger brother, Jjaks (Keanu Reeves), a repeat 
offender criminal who despises all of his blood relations.  There is 
immediate electricity between Jjaks and Freddie, and, while the 
reception is going on outside Sam's house, the pair retires inside for 
some quick sex.  Afterwards, when Jjaks announces his intention to hit 
the road again, Freddie begs him to take both her and Sam's private 
stock of cash with him.  Then, together, they can head to Las Vegas, her 
vision of paradise-on-Earth.</P>
<P>     I'm reasonably sure that Baigleman intended for FEELING MINNESOTA 
to be a comedy, but, primarily because the tone is so grim (people are 
always dying unexpectedly), it's difficult to find much that's funny.  
Anyone expecting to laugh their head off is in for a bummer.  FEELING 
MINNESOTA's sense of humor is bleak -- this picture is a prime example 
of a black comedy.  I mean, two guys sitting on opposite sides of a 
road, pelting each other with rocks is ludicrous, but hardly likely to 
cause waves of uncontrollable laughter.  And, as was the case in TRUE 
ROMANCE, the love affair between the man and woman is far less important 
than the one between the men and their guns.  On top of that, it's 
impossible to sympathize with the characters -- they're all a bunch of 
intellectually dim, lowlife criminals for whom betrayal and backstabbing 
are second nature.  </P>
<P>     For the most part, I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan.  But, despite 
his limited range, he's right for Jjaks.  His performance in FEELING 
MINNESOTA never caused me to wince.  Cameron Diaz, who has been 
appearing in a number of independent productions (including THE LAST 
SUPPER and SHE'S THE ONE) continues to show great promise.  Even under 
all the grime of FEELING MINNESOTA, her charisma shines through.  
Vincent D'Onofrio, who usually plays inoffensive supporting roles, is 
effective here as Sam the bully.  Dan Aykroyd has a sometimes-amusing, 
sometimes-irritating part as a crooked police officer infatuated with 
Freddie (his fake accent makes him sound like he wandered over from 
FARGO).</P>
<P>     Ultimately, I probably liked the idea of FEELING MINNESOTA more 
than I enjoyed the execution.  Nevertheless, when the end credits 
rolled, I was reasonably satisfied because I had just experienced 
something a little different.  FEELING MINNESOTA certainly isn't 
everyone's cup of tea, and, despite the drawing power of Keanu Reeves, 
I'm not sure it was wise to expose the film to such a wide distribution 
(it invites disappointment).  But, if you're tired of routine, "feel 
good", Hollywood fare and are looking for something a little Tarantino-
ish and a lot unusual, FEELING MINNESOTA will leave you feeling 
pleasantly surprised.</P>
