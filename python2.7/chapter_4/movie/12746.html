<PRE>CAREER GIRL POWER!
by Kristian Lin</PRE>
<P>He had his big success with SECRETS AND LIES, and now everyone has gone
back to ignoring Mike Leigh.  We shouldn't be surprised.  He's not the
kind of filmmaker who'd parlay his Oscar nominations into a big-time
transatlantic career.  Maybe that's too bad - it'd be interesting to see
which American actors would flourish under his direction, and what kind
of movies he'd make on a Hollywood budget (what would MY BEST FRIEND'S
WEDDING have been like with him directing?).  Nevertheless, Leigh 
keeps doing what he does best:  small, intimate, sharply observed
slice-of-English-life movies.</P>
<P>His new film, CAREER GIRLS, takes place during a weekend when Annie
(Lynda Steadman) returns from Yorkshire to London to see Hannah (Katrin
Cartlidge), her roommate and best friend from college.  Hannah complains
that the men she meets don't last a weekend with her, but Annie makes
the grade with her.  They haven't seen each other in six years, but they
have little trouble reconnecting.  They're like ex-lovers who still turn
each other on (in fact, they're twice mistaken for a lesbian couple). 
The movie recognizes that there's a sexual charge to any close
friendship, be it these two or Thelma and Louise or Agent Mulder and
Agent Scully.  There's little in this movie besides extended
conversation between these two, in flashbacks to their college days and
in the present day.  In this respect, the movie's like Richard 
Linklater's 1994 magnum opus BEFORE SUNRISE, and the fact that CAREER
GIRLS can stand the comparison is high praise indeed.</P>
<P>We see the two of them as social misfits in their student days who band
together for companionship.  Hannah is a rather alarming piece of work. 
She's a motormouth who talks in a Robin Williams-like
stream-of-consciousness deluge.  She's an English major, which is just
as well, since her mind runs frenetically in literary circles.  Her
bizarre and highly original sense of wordplay grabs at anything that 
presents itself - outrageous puns, metaphors, allusions, and
off-the-cuff impressions of Marlon Brando and Robert DeNiro.  She's also
prone to fits of rage, with a nasty attitude to go with her steel-trap
mind - witness her ruthless destruction of a psych major who
good-naturedly tries to analyze her.  No wonder people keep away from
her; aside from giving off the appearance of some kind of dementia, her
wit is so sharp that she frequently cuts herself and people she cares
about.</P>
<P>But if Hannah has a soft spot for Annie.  Annie touches Hannah deeply,
in fact, and it'd take a cold heart not to be moved by this pathetic
creature.  As a collegian, her hair is dyed some shade of orange, she
chain-smokes despite her asthma ("Isn't that a bit kamikaze?" erupts
Hannah), and she has a shambling walk from carrying a bag that's too
large for her.  She also has a severe case of dermatitis on her face,
and she can barely lift her eyes from the ground during a conversation. 
Hannah says, "You look like you did a tango with a cheese grater," which
is enough to send Annie to the bathroom in tears.  But Hannah's able to
sense the gentleness and resilience in Annie's heart, a quality that
comes to the forefront when Annie makes her present-day appearance as a
well-adjusted, warmly radiant presence.</P>
<P>Hannah, for her part, has morphed from a gangly, scowling misanthrope
into a cool, fashionable business executive, though she's still rough
around the edges.  Her nervous tics have now been replaced by the self-
consciously theatrical gestures of a woman who hasn't lost her desire to
act out, just refined it.  Nor have her verbal idiosyncracies
disappeared; she explains Annie's fear of heights by saying, "She's got
a touch of the Hitchcocks."  Annie's enthralled by her, and so are we,
as she continues to thrust herself, insecurities and all, in people's
faces.  In a Hollywood movie, a character like this would be required to
have a tearful breakdown at some point and reveal her innermost fears -
audiences want to see such a hard-shelled person (especially a woman)
exposed and made vulnerable.  It doesn't happen here, and the 
characterization is richer for it.</P>
<P>If Kristin Scott Thomas is a Britisher who acts like a French actress,
Katrin Cartlidge is a Britisher who acts like an American actress. 
She's unstudied, content to be unpolished, loose with her body and at
ease with herself (though this could be just simple relief at playing a
character so different from her roles in BEFORE THE RAIN and BREAKING
THE WAVES).  At the movie's end, when Annie asks her if she'll 
meet anybody exciting on the train, Hannah says, "Maybe you'll meet the
man of your dreams."  The end of this line is accompanied by a hand
gesture which, we have come to learn, is one of Hannah's trademarks. 
Cartlidge puts her whole being into it, and yet it's a delightfully
self-deprecating jab at her way of expressing things.  The effect is
terribly charming; you couldn't imagine it coming from another 
British actress (or even most American leading ladies), so ladylike and
self-possessed are they.  It's something out of the Julia Roberts
repertoire.  Hey, here's a comparison - Roberts is similarly tall, with
an excess energy that keeps pouring out of her in the form of tiny,
illuminating gestures.  But anyone can see that Cartlidge isn't Roberts
- with her severe, angular features and a cerebral ferocity that shows
even in this light comedy, Cartlidge's presence in a movie is strong
stuff indeed.</P>
<P>Of course, it takes two (and not a cheese grater) to tango, and the
newcomer Steadman, while overplaying the naïveté a bit in the
present-day section, is an effectively soft counterpart to Cartlidge's
hardness.  We don't see too many movies about women forming close
friendships.  We see even less of them done so convincingly.  It still
dips into clichés like Hannah telling Annie, "You're the only person
who's ever appreciated me," but the chemistry between the actresses
redeems the movie's occasional talkiness and overexplicitness.  In this
respect, CAREER GIRLS is like a down-to-earth English version of ROMY 
AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.  It doesn't have the silly comic
highs of its American counterpart, but when you're watching the latter
movie, you're always aware of two funny actresses clicking together.  In
CAREER GIRLS, you're aware of two characters finding strength in the way
they complement each other instead.</P>
<P>Mike Leigh designs his movies to be unformed, with stray stories poking
out from the edges.  There's a funny house-hunting scene where the two
girls meet a bathrobe-clad stockbroker who lights up a joint 
while showing them his apartment and clearly wants to have sex with
them.  (Hannah spots an open girlie magazine on his bed and asks, "Going
through your family album?")  On the flip side, there's the boyfriend
that Annie rejected who turns up six years later homeless and insane. 
This vignette lacks the tragic power of a similar scene in FARGO - it
takes too long without really going anywhere.  But Leigh's films acquire
their richness from hinting at the lives that are lived offscreen and
only peripherally touch on the movie we see.</P>
<P>Hollywood likes movies about bland people, and does its best to smooth
out interesting actors.  Only minor characters are allowed to be
eccentric, and they tend to be grotesque caricatures.  There seems to be 
no middle ground - a movie like MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, which allowed
its protagonists some mild oddities, amounts to a blast of fresh air. 
On the other hand, some American independent filmmakers strain mightily
to create characters who talk, act, or think in original ways.  Mike
Leigh always gives the impression that he's just found these people and
treasures them for being the way they are.  At one point, Hannah credits
her first boss with saving her sanity.  How?  She says, "He let me be
myself."  We never meet that boss, but I'll bet he was Mike Leigh.</P>
