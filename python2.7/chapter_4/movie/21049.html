<P>_Drive_Me_Crazy_ (PG-13) * (out of ****)</P>
<P>As the press notes are so eager to announce, _Drive_Me_Crazy_ takes its
title from "(You Drive Me) Crazy," the latest hit single by teen pop
phenomenon Britney Spears.  Since Fox went so far out of its way to
retitle the film for the tune (the original name was the more fitting but
Britney-inspiration-lacking _Next_to_You_), I will go through each of
this teen comedy's painfully pedestrian plot paces as it relates to the
song.</P>
<P>"Baby, I'm so into you/You got that something/What can I do?"  In-crowd
high school girl Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) pines for star basketball
stud Brad (Gabriel Carpenter).  Similarly, her next-door neighbor (hence
the film's original title), outcast bad boy Chase (Adrian Grenier) is so
into his girlfriend Dulcie (Ali Larter).</P>
<P>"Baby, you spin me around/The earth is moving/But I can't feel the
ground."  Brad withdraws his invitation to Nicole to a big dance after he
falls for a cheerleader.  As coincidence would have it, around the same
time, Dulcie gives Chase the heave-ho.  Determined to win back their
respective paramours, Nicole and Chase--now made over into a clean-cut
popular guy--pretend to be a couple in order to incite jealousy in their
exes.</P>
<P>"Every time you look at me/My heart is jumpin'/It's easy to see/You
drive me crazy/I just can't sleep/I'm so excited/I'm in too deep/Oh oh
oh, crazy/But it feels all right/Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all
night."  Of course, Nicole and Chase find that their false attraction has
become real; as the song goes, in one scene, Chase, lost in thought about
Nicole, stays up an entire night.  With this easily foreseen turn of
events comes the major flaw of the screenplay by Rob Thomas.  The way
these mismatched couple movies are supposed to work is that once the
"ugly duckling" is made over, the other person falls for him/her--by
seeing through the slick veneer and taking a liking to his/her "true
self."  In this film, Nicole takes a liking to Chase once he starts
acting like the in-crowd and gradually erases all trace of his original
personality.  So much for not judging a book by its cover.</P>
<P>The film is not helped by Hart's accordingly shallow performance, which
never once convinces that there's anything more to Nicole than her
popular girl image.  Even more ruinous is the complete lack of chemistry
between her and Grenier, and Thomas and director John Schultz come up
with nothing else to hold the audience's attention; certainly not the
routine subplots, including nice guy Dave (Mark Webber)'s cyber romance
and the scheming of Nicole's so-called best-friend Alicia (Susan May
Pratt).  _Drive_Me_Crazy_ feels like another lackluster youth entry into
the new fall TV season, a point driven home by one touch that is amusing
for all the wrong reasons: there are a number of basketball scenes in the
film, and it's hard not to notice that on Brad's team and all the others
they play, every single player is Caucasian.</P>
<P>I was expecting _Drive_Me_Crazy_ to follow the same tactic that
_Dangerous_Minds_ used with its featured hit single, "Gangsta's
Paradise"--that is, milk it to death and then some, exploiting the
theatre's Dolby Digital sound system whenever possible to remind patrons
exactly what brought them into the theatre.  But it didn't; in fact, it
got to the point where I was actually _waiting_ for the song to blare on
the soundtrack.  (For the record, it is played for a brief moment
mid-film and then in its entirety during the end credits--the latter
instance inspiring some teenybopper girls in the audience to sing along
and dance in their seats.)   The fact that I was waiting for a Britney
Spears song to play speaks volumes about how incredibly boring this film
is.</P>
