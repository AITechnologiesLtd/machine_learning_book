<P>     Substance has slammed into the summer season with the landfall of
COURAGE UNDER FIRE, an imposing and entirely affecting military drama
that reteams Oscar-winning actor Denzel Washington with his glorious
GLORY director Edward Zwick.  This time we're witness to a modern
conflict, as the movie opens on a friendly-fire incident during the Gulf
War.  Commanding a compliment of armored vehicles, Lieutenant Colonel
Nat Serling (Washington) gives the order to fire on what is thought to
be an enemy target.  His men die, instead.  Six months after the end of
the war, Serling is working on his own death-- a slow suicide via
Scotch-- when he is assigned to investigate the approval of a posthumous
Medal of Honor for a helicopter pilot (a gritty Meg Ryan) who died in
the war.  A discrepancy in the surviving accounts piques Serling's
interest and, soon, he begins uncovering the truth about many things,
including his own suffering state.</P>
<P>     COURAGE UNDER FIRE carries surprising emotional weight, even as it
all too often relies on familiar dramatic devices.  You may wince at
such seeming cliches as Serling grasping for the whispered words of a
dying man lying on a hospital bed.  Or his clandestine meeting with a
newspaper reporter (Scott Glenn) complete with a trench coat, sun-
glasses, and, amusingly, a Redskins cap.  The too-polished plot is as
potentially distracting as the tightrope casting (Ryan, with a slurred
Southern accent; Lou Diamond Phillips as a buffed and tough solider;
Bronson Pinchot as a White House spin doctor).  Credit a couple of
rock-solid performances (including Washington and Michael Moriarty as
the commanding officer) and a no-nonsense approach by Zwick and
screenwriter Patrick Sheane Duncan (MR. HOLLAND'S ANUS, NICK OF TIME).
Their frank presentation of the subject matter and a unflinching
attention to detail help drive home the point that the consequences of
war are hell.  Go and have a good cry.</P>
