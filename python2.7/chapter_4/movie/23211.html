"You know, pregnant women can have sex up until their third trimester," one of
the holy prophets so eloquently points out just as this bloated flick ambles to
its bloated finale. The prophet is played by perennial Kevin Smith stoner,
Jason Mewes, who utters all his dialogue in witless colloquialisms. Mewes
reminds me of the members of Howard Stern's Wack Pack: The radio host regularly
invites individuals with peculiar speech impediments to invoke scripted lines
on his show. Their is the stutterer who harasses celebrities with queries like,
"A-a-a-are you s-s-still in sh-showbizness?", the Woody Allen soundalike made
to say...well you can imagine. Mewes is a comparative performer, a one-noter
who delivers all his lines (no matter what they are) in a similarly loopy,
zonked out, phonation.
Admittedly, I did laugh at Mewes' stoned-beyond repair schtick in Smith's
earlier works, but this act has not aged well. Must this dimwit be in every
Kevin Smith movie? To call him one-dimensional would be rather complimentary.
Smith's insistence on sticking with the character smacks of insecurity with his
new material. That being DOGMA, a religious comic fantasy, in which Smith
sprinkles his philosophies regarding organized religion and Catholicism amid a
flurry of dick jokes.
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck play two fallen angels, whom we first encounter in
an airport discussing a loophole in Catholic Dogma that could possibly get them
back into heaven. Damon and Affleck both posses an affable charm that suites
the blandly attractive stars well. They play their roles like a couple of frat
boys presuming to emulate religious entities.
British thespian Alan Rickman is a good angel on a mission to obstruct the evil
frat boy angels, who will unknowingly negate our existence if they succeed in
their plan. He approaches a lapsed catholic, abortion clinic employee (sorry
for being so verbose, I just couldn't resist putting the words "abortion" and
"catholic" in the same description), Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) to aid him in
the crusade. Bethany's character is later related more relevantly, but I won't
give that away. She sets out on an adventure with two "prophets" (Jay and
Silent Bob), and a black apostle, Rufas (Chris Rock), who falls out of the sky
bare-ass naked.
As Smith uses his story to jump back and forth between both predicaments, he
manipulates his characters as vessels in which to voice his own (presumably)
religious ideologies. Whenever this occurs (and it does frequently) the flick
falls into preachy didacticism; the proceedings are halted for Professor Smith
to give us a little lesson.
We do get some of Smith's trademark raucous humor, but delivered without the
panache that is desperately needed. Smith knows that comedy is about
unexpectedly juxtaposing incongruities, unfortunately, here, he doesn't seem to
realize that timing is equally important.
Also problematic is his severely dull directing "style". The director has yet
to become aware of film as a visual medium. Nor is he conscious of how to
properly position his actors in front of the camera. The frame is constantly
cluttered, as if everyone had fallen into place. Smith has never been a great
director, but this was less than noticeable in low budget movies about impudent
clerks or slackers passing the time in a mall.
With DOGMA, Smith has switched genres. He's making an adventure. One that is
without action or movement, a stagnant talkfest with lessons! This wouldn't be
so bad if he were able to elicit more laughs from his cast. Oddly enough, most
of the actors seem rushed, and unsure of the material they are proclaiming.
Rickman speaks so rapidly we miss many of his punch lines. Mewes doesn't seem
to be aware of where his punch lines are. It's as if everyone were in a hurry
to get to the conclusion. Though that's doubtful; the conclusion is easily
DOGMA's weakest, most incoherent sequence.
Damon and Affleck give the most seasoned performances, at least early on. Damon
plays the more pugnacious of the two, an angel of death who gets off on taking
out his wrath on the not so innocent. Affleck plays good angel to Damon's bad
angel. Constantly fretting over Damon's irate jabbering, Affleck's hang dog mug
and Caesar hair cut conjures up that of an emasculated puppy. Watching the two
riff off each other is the movies prime regalement. I kept envisioning a much
better DOGMA, one that focused solely on these rascally fellows.
Suddenly, without warning their dynamic is incongruously switched. Following an
embarrassingly staged brawl aboard a train, Affleck's character is altered from
puppy dog to bull dog. He has an epiphany, turns certifiable and regenerates as
his own angel of death. The switch is completely out of character, and
pointless; there is no pay off.
As for the other actors, never have I seen such a talented group do more
execrable work. The usually deft, husky voiced Fiorentino is laughably miscast;
like Demi Moore in STRIPTEASE, she doesn't seem to be aware that she's acting
in a comedy.
Chris Rock is adept at handling the one liners (when asked if he knew Jesus,
Rock delivers the best line; "Knew him? Nigger owes me $12 bucks!"), but unable
to inject anything in the corny You-can-do-it speeches he ladles on Bethany.
Jason Lee, another Smith regular, overacts his demonic role, aggrandizing each
line. He's like a child, playing demon, but never becoming the malevolent
figure he's ostensibly aiming for.
Other appearances include Salma Hayek (as a stripper who never strips yet
somehow manages to pull in large quantities of dough), comedian George Carlin
(as a gravel voiced priest), a mute Alanis Morisette, and Janeane Garafolo in a
cameo too tiny to even comment on.
The disjointed performances puzzled me more than anything. Where these talented
thesps so mis-directed as to act as if they were appearing in a lousy high
school play, not a major motion picture?
I like Smith's other films. I even believe his much-maligned MALLRATS has some
merits, but his talents are beginning to seem increasingly limited. The
slacker\stoner whimsy that imbued the Jersey Trilogy (CLERKS, MALLRATS, CHASING
AMY), with contemporary mid-90's immaturity (albeit wily immaturity) has grown
tiresome.
And I didn't even mention the shit monster. . .</P>
