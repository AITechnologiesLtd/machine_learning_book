<PRE>                              A FEW GOOD MEN
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<P>142 min., R, Drama, 1992
Director: Rob Reiner
Cast: Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon,
      Kevin Pollak, James Marshall, J. T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland,      
      Christopher Guest, Xander Berkeley</P>
<P>     Two Marines are accused of killing another Marine in their platoon.
They are represented by Navy lawyer Tom Cruise and by Demi Moore.
Cruise and Moore want to prove that the Marines didn't kill the man on
purpose, but were just following orders given by their commanding
officer, Jack Nicholson.</P>
<P>     A FEW GOOD MEN is an excellent film, and I suggest that you don't
miss it.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  On a scale of zero to five, I
give A FEW GOOD MEN a five.  A FEW GOOD MEN is rated R for explicit
language and violence.</P>
<P>     The cast for this film is exceptional.  I expect to see some
Academy Award nominations for the cast (among other categories) for this
film.  Jack Nicholson (HOFFA, THE SHINING) stands out above the rest of
the cast.  His performance is the best that I have ever seen him give.
I think that Jack Nicholson gives a much better performance in this film
than in HOFFA, so if you can only see one of his current films I suggest
this one.  Tom Cruise (RAIN MAN, RISKY BUSINESS) gives an excellent
performance.  His character is completely believable.  Demi Moore (GHOST
[1990], ABOUT LAST NIGHT..., BLAME IT ON RIO) is perfect.  I don't think
that she could have done any better with her character.  Kevin Bacon
(FLATLINERS, PLANES TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES) is great.  Kiefer Sutherland
(1969, TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME) also is outstanding.</P>
<P>     The director, Rob Reiner (THE PRINCESS BRIDE, STAND BY ME), does an
excellent job.  He has created a near perfect, if not perfect, film.
The writing for this film is great.  I was entranced for every minute of
this film.  This film is far better than the other court film out, BODY
OF EVIDENCE.</P>
<P>     The locations used for this film are great.  They set the film
perfectly.  The characters are well built so that they are all three
dimensional.  They are characters that I found myself liking or hating.
They also can bring emotion from the audience watching the film.  I
could probably go on forever talking about all the great aspects of this
film so I will stop here before I end up boring you.  Definitely go out
and see this film as soon as possible.</P>
