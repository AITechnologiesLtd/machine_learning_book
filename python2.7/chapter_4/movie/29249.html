<P>   After the shootout at Colorado's Colombine High School the
cliche was bandied around once again: "In my day, disputes
were settled by fists.  Nowadays they use guns."  You think that's
bad?  Contrast that with what they're saying about the high
school kids not in Columbine but in Colombia: "They used to
settle disputes with machetes.  Now they use guns."  This is an
actual quote from Barbet Schroeder's new film, "Our Lady of the
Assassins," the first Spanish-language work from the director
familiar to Americans for movies like "Reversal of Fortune" and
"Single White Female."  In this bleak, cynical, blasphemous and
occasionally even humorous vision of life in Medellin--known to
us here as the capital of that country's drug cartel--Schroeder
hones in on a well-traveled homosexual now in his fifties,
Fernando (German Jaramillo), who has returned home, as he
puts it, "to die."  Why so?  Despite the large apartment with a
stunning three-sided view of the city and a considerable sum of
money which he has inherited from his sister, he is simply tired of
living.  Ah, but redemption, spelled L-O-V-E awaits in the form of
a innocent looking teen, Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros), to whom
Fernando is introduced at a party by a friend and with whom he
establishes a sexual and caring bond.</P>
<P>   Schroeder's take on the city of Medellin, based on Fernando
Vallejo's novel, is not the sort that the Colombia Tourist
Department would want to use to lure potential travelers to its
doorstep.  Schroeder filmed on the fly to avoid mighty unpleasant
repercussions from the locals who dwell in the drug-infested
barrios of the otherwise sparkling city.  Its clean, well-stocked
malls could pass muster in Southern Cal. and touristic areas of
Europe.  But "La Virgen de los sicarios" is a tour of a city, as
Fernando advises a witness to a murder, in which
"people get killed all the time....This isn't Switzerland."  The  lad
whom Fernando has taken under his wing and who is in turn
protected by young Alexis is sought by hit men.  Bearing the kill-
or-be-killed demeanor, Alexis has no problem whipping out his
Baretta and offing a cab driver who refuses to turn down his radio.
Ditto several people his own age who come bearing down on him
on their Kawas, guns drawn.  While Fernando does not much
approve of his prot‚g‚'s behavior, he seems remarkably
accepting, blaming the death of civilization for the murders that
befall his homeland in much the way that Wallace Shawn's
intellectual played by Mike Nichols in "Death of a Mourner" laments 
the demise of high culture.</P>
<P>   If Fernando were living on New York's Sutton Place, we'd
probably call him not so much a limousine liberal as an acolyte of
radical chic.  He has money, but he is a militant non-believer, an
atheist who believes that if God exists, then He has failed and
Satan has won the battle.  He understands that the rich run the
world, but like so many other radicals of the left, he has
considerable contempt for the poor, telling one young, ragged
woman with two children in tow to "beg for pesos from the person
who knocked you up."</P>
<P>   Amid the death and decay that Fernando and Alexis find in the
city (in one area there is a sign "Do not dump corpses," where, of
course, several bodies have been placed in states of advanced
decay), there is considerable humor.  In one scene Schroeder
contrasts Fernando's love of Maria Callas with Alexis's fondness
for rock, the latter insisting that the diva sounds as though she
were being strangled.  "Our Lady of the Assassins" is filled with
the music of the people--the tango of the night club, the drums of
the punk who lives in the apartment next door, the blaring beat of
the taxi radios--but a Jerry Bruckheimer-type score would be
gratuitous.  Schroeder delivers his message loud and clear:
civilization as the older generation knew it is dead, and Medellin
is merely metaphor.</P>
