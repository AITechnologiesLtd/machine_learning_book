<PRE>                                   THE ADVOCATE
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<P>Director: Leslie Megahey
Starring: Colin Firth , Ian Holm, Donald Pleasence, Amina Annabi, and
          Nicol Williamson
A BBC/ CiBy 2000 film distributed in the US by Miramax</P>
<P>     The absolute worst thing about this film is the poorly conceived
US ad campaign.  Faced with an offbeat tough sell project, Miramax
decided to try to use their old CRYING GAME strategy and hope for
lightning to strike twice.  The ad implores you not to reveal the
identity of the client.  The still in the ad shows a minor character in
a costume not seen in the film holding a sword.  There is almost no
swordplay in the film.  Those looking for a sword and sorcery epic will
be sorely disappointed.  Fans of THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE and THE
NAME OF THE ROSE, however, are in for a real treat.</P>
<P>     The very first frame of the film gives the secret away.  A mule is
about to be executed for her role in an unnatural act.  There was a
time when animals were held as culpable for there actions as humans.
The film takes place in the middle ages.  Colin Firth is a Paris
trained lawyer who has taken up practice in a small town near the
French border.  Much of the film is a play on the city boy in the
country motifs.  With the time left over from his various romances,
Firth uses his new-fangled legal notions as a kind of public defender.
Firth's modern notions of justice simply have no place among the great
(and quite literally) unwashed.  His attempts to use logic in cases
simply confounds the court.  Like modern lawyers, he then has to resort
to exploiting centuries old loopholes to delay cases and waste the
court's money, hoping they will simply drop the case.</P>
<P>     One of his cases, the one the ad implores people not to divulge,
is the trial of a pig for killing a Jewish boy.  From this case we see
many of the popular notions of the Middle Ages, questions of whether
non-Christians are counted as people or something less, of whether the
person is on trial or the evil spirit that compelled the person.</P>
<P>     These legal questions become the backdrop to a well handled
mystery.  For reasons everybody except the advocate seem to know,
everybody wants the pig case disposed of quickly with few questions
asked, except of course, the Gypsies who own the pig.</P>
<P>     The mystery is the heart of this often quite funny and quite
erotic little film.  Although the film takes place on the French
border, it is in English with an excellent cast of mostly Shakespearean
actors.  Besides Firth, Nicol Williamson and Donald Pleasence create
quite believable characters.  Amina Annabi gives a very earthy and
sensual performance as the Gypsy.</P>
<P>      This film was cut from the European original to get an R rating.
In Great Britain it was released as THE HOUR OF THE PIG.</P>
