<PRE>                                 THE D.I.
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1957) * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        My inner flag was at half-mast last year when Nick at Nite 
pulled "Dragnet" reruns off the air. Sure, I'd seen them all at least 
once, but I could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs 
from ultra-serious Jack Webb when there was nothing else on TV. 
Even though "Dragnet" is out of circulation at the moment, we 
Webb anti-fans still have THE D.I., a 50's propaganda piece for the 
military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "Blue Boy" episode 
of "Dragnet."</P>
<P>        For anyone like me who got laughs out of Webb's rapid-fire 
speeches and straight-faced seriousness, think of THE D.I. as what 
would happen if Sgt. Joe Friday ever enlisted, because he plays 
exactly the same character here, a no-nonsense old fart who looks 
with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long-
winded, melodramatic speeches on any topic. In this election 
year, I'm more convinced than ever that Webb and Bob Dole 
were separated at birth.</P>
<P>        The movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit 
after another knocks on Webb's office door and enters. He gives 
each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits 
come up. The "Produced and Directed by Jack Webb" card pretty 
much goes without saying. This is his movie all the way, and after 
the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no 
reason, I was wondering if there would even be a plot. I certainly 
would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark 
Webb rants, but THE D.I. gives us more -- much more.</P>
<P>        Webb's mission is to make a man out of Private Owens, 
the local screw-up. The Captain gives Webb three days to convert 
Owens into Marine material or, the captain will "personally cut the 
lace off his panties and ship him out myself." (Whether the "lace 
panties" part refers to Webb or Owens remains unanswered.) This, 
of course, gives Webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy 
on making Owens' life a living hell.</P>
<P>        For those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the 
pleasures of Webb watching, here's a reprint of a typical monologue 
of his. I can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper, but the words 
should at least partially convey what I'm talking about... "Now you 
listen to me, youngster. Someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach 
and you'll pray to God somebody doesn't get killed because of your 
foolishness... I've got a headline for you: Every time you make one 
of those little mistakes of yours, you're gonna turn around and I'll 
be standing right there."</P>
<P>        I couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from 
THE D.I. (nearly all of it belongs in the Bad Movie Hall of Fame), 
but I tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines, like one 
from the scene where Webb unwinds from a hard day's work by 
going to the local bar (where he orders a tomato juice). He meets a 
woman who, coincidentally, also orders tomato juice but walks away 
from a typically-stimulating conversation with Webb to flirt with his 
arch-rival, another Marine D.I. Webb marches over to the table, gets 
up in her face and says, "Just what kind of a dame do you think you 
are?" Bogart he ain't.</P>
<P>        The other D.I. gets one of the few memorable non-Webb 
lines when he confesses to the girl, "He's a damn good D.I. ... I 
guess I'm just a little jealous." Join the club, we're all jealous of 
Jack Webb's way with women, which is showcased even more 
amusingly in a later scene, as Webb finds his way to the woman's 
place of employment, a lingerie store, and stands around looking 
incredibly flustered at the negligees on display. "You expect me to 
talk to you... in _here_?!" he exclaims, no doubt intimidated by the 
barrage of bras.</P>
<P>        The woman goes off to help a customer, leaving Webb 
to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen. A little 
girl spots him in the store and demands, "What are you doing in 
here... you're a man, aren't you?" He doesn't reply, but you know 
he's thinking in his head, "What an odd species of human -- so 
small. Must be one of those children everyone's been talking 
about." This poor girl, scarred for life by her early encounter with 
Jack Webb, would later swear off the male gender entirely, just one 
of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for.</P>
<P>        The movie doesn't focus too closely on Webb's romance, it 
also continues the Owens subplot with probably the most memorable 
scene in the entire movie, where Webb forces his platoon to spend 
the entire night searching the ground for a flea Owens killed during 
one of their drills. After two privates hatch a scheme to present 
Webb with the wrong dead flea, Webb asks Owens, "Was that flea 
you killed a male or female?" Owens replies, "A male, sir." Webb 
yells to the platoon, "This ain't the one!" That such a scene (along 
with the rest of the movie) was intended to be taken seriously defies 
comment.</P>
<P>        But we know it was all presented with the utmost 
seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the Marines not 
only for their cooperation in the making of THE D.I., but for Iwo 
Jima, Guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of 
the 20th century. Webb held the military in such high esteem that 
all the soldiers in the movie (with the exception of Owens) were 
played by actual Marines. Someone wanting to parody this movie 
couldn't do a more comical job than Webb did.</P>
<P>        It makes it all the more ironic (like raeeyain on your 
wedding day) that the man had no sense of humor himself. There's 
a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time 
discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter. 
Webb bursts in the room and shouts, "What did I tell you about 
laughing?!" to which the private replies, "Sir, only nine-year-old 
girls laugh, sir!" And let me tell you, I was as happy as a nine-year-
old girl while watching this movie.</P>
