<P>Ulee's Gold (1997) *** out of ***** - Cast: Peter Fonda, Patricia
Richardson, J. Kenneth Campbell. Written and Directed by: Victor Nunez.
Running Time: 111 minutes.</P>
<P>Living a small town in Central Florida, Ulee Jackson (Fonda) is an aging
beekeeper who's had a difficult life. His wife has passed away, his son is
in jail for robbery, and his daughter-in-law has run off, leaving him to
raise her two daughters by himself until his son is released. With demand
for Ulee's honey slowly decreasing, the upcoming season will be his most
important. Unfortunately, some people from his son's criminal past are about
to re-enter the scene, and could possibly change Ulee's life forever.</P>
<P>"Ulee's Gold" is very slow-going, but thankfully the story's conflict
presents itself early enough, so the audience is interested to see what's
going to happen next. Peter Fonda, in a role I could easily have seen his
father play (and sometimes in this film the resemblance between Henry and
Peter is uncanny), gives probably the best performance I've ever seen from
him. He always seems to be playing Peter Fonda, but here he's give an actual
character to work with, and I'll admit I was impressed. It's not a fantastic
performance, but a very good one considering who's giving it.</P>
<P>My only real complaint with the film is the character of the youngest
daughter, who seems way too thoughtful, sensitive, and poetic for someone
that young. "Ulee's Gold" is a pleasant little film. Nothing great, but
certainly entertaining enough. [R]</P>
