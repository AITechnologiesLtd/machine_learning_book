<PRE>MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>It is rare when the sequel, GODFATHER PART II being perhaps the most
popular example, is better that the original.  Regardless of the hype
surrounding the change of directors in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, with famed
action director John Woo (BROKEN ARROW and FACE/OFF) replacing sagging
director Brian De Palma (SNAKE EYES and MISSION TO MARS), the sequel
doesn't even measure up to the mediocre standards set by the first.</P>
<P>Having more flat, dead spots than Death Valley, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2
drags whenever Woo isn't blowing something up, switching to slow motion
or staging a kickboxing extravaganza.  And when, on those rare
occasions, he does get the action in gear, he comes up with only a few
ideas, which he uses ad nauseam.  Like in FACE/OFF, his characters wear
false faces.  This is a cute idea that Woo and writer Robert Towne, who
co-wrote the original, abuse by having people conveniently packing a
host of masks for the right occasion.  As soon as a character starts
acting strange, you can be sure that he will shortly rip his fake face
off.</P>
<P>Again starring Tom Cruise as IMF(Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan
Hunt, the movie certainly hopes to bank on his star power to make
megabucks.  Some of the money the studio spent for him and the expensive
stunts might have been better saved until the script was worth shooting.
And with such a paucity of ideas, why was the movie allowed to expand
into over two hours?</P>
<P>An underutilized Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, Ethan's beefy
computer geek.  As Ethan's romantic interest, a fetchingly beautiful
Thandie Newton (BESIEGED) plays thief and IMF recruit, Nyah
Nordoff-Hall.  With mesmerizing eyes that penetrate like lasers and
flowing jet-black hair, Nyah is undeniably gorgeous, but she isn't a
worthy action companion for Ethan.</P>
<P>The plot involves a stolen substance whose purpose is unknown to the
thief, played by the numbers by Dougray Scott.  This parallels the
uncertainty of director Woo over what to do with the murky plot, which
he turns into James Bond-lite.  The mysterious matter turns out to be a
powerful virus -- no, not a computer one -- and a corresponding
anti-virus.  Knowing this alone makes it easy to predict a key "twist"
late in the story.  Don't hold your breath for any scene as imaginative
as the computer room break-in from the original, since there aren't any.</P>
<P>The leaden dialog ("I confess.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to
make money.") only makes the movie's long, slow sections more difficult
to sit through.  You feel like yelling at the screen for them to blow up
something, which inevitably picks up the pace for a while.</P>
<P>A few nice moments does not a movie make.  Even if Woo demonstrates, on
occasion, his gift for setting up vibrant action sequences, this isn't
enough to forgive him for wasting our time through most of the movie.
Almost all of the picture's best footage occurs in the last 15 minutes,
so Woo does send off his audiences with a big adrenaline rush.  The
question is whether it was worth the one and three quarter hour wait.
I, for one, expect more than a 15 minute short from a big-budget action
picture.  Other viewers may feel similarly cheated.</P>
<P>MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 runs a long 2:06.  It is rated PG-13 for action
violence and some sexuality and would be acceptable for kids around 10
and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave it *** 1/2 and was very positive on the
film, the plot and the stars.  He liked it a lot better than the
original, which we watched on DVD last week, since he thought that the
sequel had more action.  He particularly liked the big motorcycle chase.</P>
