<PRE>                                 FRENCH KISS
                       A film review by Eric Grossman
                   Copyright 1995 LOS ANGELES INDEPENDENT</PRE>
<P>     Lawrence Kasdan's FRENCH KISS starring Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline is
a charming romantic comedy that also doubles as a travelogue for
France.</P>
<P>     Ryan plays Kate, an obsessive-compulsive, lactose-intolerant woman
who is so terrified of flying,  she won't even accompany her
doctor-fiance, Charlie (Timothy Hutton), with whom she is madly in love,
to Paris.  "I get around the way God intended, a car" she says.
Charlie, who has a medical meeting, goes on by himself and then Kate's
worst nightmare happens, Charlie falls in love with a French beauty
named Juliette (Susan Anbeh).  Kate's phobia of flying is overwhelmed
by her fear of losing the man she loves and she journey's to France to
get him back.</P>
<P>     On the flight over, she meets Luc (Kevin Kline), a French thief
who feigns interest in helping her so that he can use her to smuggle a
valuable necklace into the country.  As Luc struggles to retrieve his
stolen property from Kate's bag, he begins to sympathize with her
plight and eventually, begins to fall in love with her himself.  At the
same time, Kate is falling for Luc and ultimately must decide which man
she really loves.</P>
<P>     FRENCH KISS is somewhat of a comeback for Kasdan whose last film,
WYATT EARP, starring Kevin Costner, was a certified bomb.  Although he
is a great writer and responsible for some of the most successful
screenplays of all time (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, RAIDERS OF THE LOST
ARK, THE BODYGUARD), Kasdan as a director (BODY HEAT, THE BIG CHILL)
has obtained many critical kudos but only a few hits at the box
office.  However, with the help of Adam Brooks' screenplay, Kasdan is
back on track with this film.</P>
<P>     A French person's worst nightmare, Ryan's Kate can be a real
whiner.  Despite this, the sweetness that caused audiences to fall in
love with her in TOP GUN and that made her a huge star in WHEN HARRY
MET SALLY is still there.  Kline, a superb actor with an equal gift for
drama and comedy (GRAND CANYON, A FISH CALLED WANDA) plays his
Frenchman with a delicate balance of humor, sleaziness, and warmth.
Most importantly, Ryan and Kline have chemistry.</P>
<P>     Hutton is fine as the not-so-nice-guy, Charlie, but the
scene-stealer is Jean Reno (LA FEMME NIKITA, THE PROFESSIONAL).  He
plays Jean-Paul, a French policeman who is both Luc's friend and
pursuer.  Reno has a wonderful face the overflows with character and
without a doubt, he has the finest accent in the film, mostly because
it's real!</P>
<P>     FRENCH KISS is a light, "feel-good" romp that slowly pins a smile
to your face.   Effective music and beautiful scenery are an added
bonus.</P>
