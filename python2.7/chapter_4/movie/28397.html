EVOLUTION
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>EVOLUTION, by director Ivan Reitman (GHOSTBUSTERS), is a silly sci-fi 
flick that's a fun blend of your favorites including JURASSIC PARK, MARS 
ATTACKS and GALAXY QUEST.  Although it starts slow, once it gets in gear 
the laughs start to fly.</P>
<P>It all starts when a meteorite strikes the earth and unleashes a rapidly 
evolving alien race.  From single cell organisms, they quickly change 
into world-class menaces.  </P>
<P>The two-person scientific team initially investigating the big incident 
comes from the local community college.  Ira Kane (David Duchovny, "The 
huge botched experiment on humans.  His doofus assistant is fellow 
instructor Harry Block (Orlando Jones, THE REPLACEMENTS), who coaches 
the girl's volleyball team when he isn't teaching science.  Harry's main 
concern is about the payout schedule and tax implications of a Nobel 
Prize.  </P>
<P>This rag-tag team of subpar scientists is aided by Wayne Green (Seann 
William Scott, ROAD TRIP), a pool boy who'd like to be a fireman.  His 
qualifications, other than almost getting smushed by the rock from 
space, are that he "took some chemistry in high school."  Later they are 
joined by Allison Reed (Julianne Moore, HANNIBAL), a klutzy researcher 
from the CDC, who can't walk without falling.</P>
<P>The science behind the story has equal measure of fascinating 
imagination and needlessly troublesome logical holes.  As the aliens 
evolve, Phil Tippett's models are a mixture of the creative and the 
mundane as if the production were hurried.  A typical "monster" is a 
cute little baby Jabba the Hutt that turns out to have an ALIEN-like 
creature in its throat.  The film, which is rated PG-13, will make you 
jump more than once.  Don't even think about bringing kids of any age 
that are easily frightened.</P>
<P>The comedy, both physical and verbal, is a real treat, but the actors' 
ability to pull it off varies widely.  Orlando Jones and Seann William 
Scott are definitely the best.  Jones has great fun chewing up the 
scenery, and Scott never played dumb better.  Duchovny's performance is 
uneven, and Moore seems miscast.</P>
<P>In a picture that pulls no comedic punches, it is one of the few so 
brazen as to have not only a major product placement but an outright 
commercial as well.  But, never fear, it's all in the service of the 
comedy and turns out to be quite funny.  I'm sure that the placement 
fees had no influence whatsoever.</P>
<P>EVOLUTION runs 1:42.  It is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, and 
for sci-fi action and would be acceptable for not easily frightened kids 
10 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, found the film quite funny and gave it *** 1/2.  
With a scientist mind, he had complaints about a logical gap in the 
evolution progression that troubled him.  His friend Sam, also 12, gave 
the movie a full ****, saying that it was very clever and funny.  He had 
similar concerns to Jeffrey's about some of the science.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 8, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.</P>
