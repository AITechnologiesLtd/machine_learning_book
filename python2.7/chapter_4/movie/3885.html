<PRE>                                 POCAHONTAS
                       A film review by Fred Edwords
                        Copyright 1995 Fred Edwords</PRE>
<P>>From the July 1995 issue of the Interracial Club of Buffalo Newsletter</P>
<PRE>                DISNEY'S FIRST INTERRACIAL CARTOON FEATURE:
                    NEW SONGS, OLD STORY, TIRED FORMULA</PRE>
<P>     It's as though Disney has been beating around the bush for a long
time on this whole mixed-couple thing.  First it was a love story
between a cocker spaniel and a mongrel in LADY AND THE TRAMP.  A sexy
songstress and a bunny got it together in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?
Then a fish/woman and a handsome prince fell in love in THE LITTLE
MERMAID.  Finally, it was a young gal and a bewitched prince in
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  But never in all this was there a decidedly
non-white lead character.  That didn't happen until ALADDIN, which,
though not an interracial film, was definitely a welcome change of
habit.</P>
<P>     Not until last month, then, can we say that Disney finally took
the plunge.  Yet when they did, it wasn't entirely worth the wait.
True to traditional Hollywood form, their scriptwriters saw to it that
the interracial love affair was a fleeting thing indeed.  And the
artists made sure that Pocahontas was comfortably anglicized.  (She may
have had her mother's eyes, but definitely *not* her father's nose.  As
NEWSWEEK put it, "... tall and shapely in a buckskin minidress, with
miles of floating hair:  she's Native American Barbie.")</P>
<P>     Remember American TV's first interracial kiss?  It was on STAR
TREK in 1968 and the faces were turned away from the camera so the lips
would not be seen.  Ditto for Disney's first interracial kiss in
POCAHONTAS.  Fortunately, however, there is a second kiss at the end of
the film that is much more honest.  Perhaps those doing the storyboard
figured the audience would be softened up by then.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, the tired script offers, as TIME magazine put it,
"... a boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl story whose plot is
familiar in every weepie affair, from ROMEO AND JULIET to THE
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY."  However, the boy-loses-girl ending is the
weakest part of the tale, and totally unnecessary.  After Pocahontas
saves Captain John Smith's life by placing her body between him and her
father's war club, Smith saves her father by standing between him and
Governor Ratcliffe's bullet.  Smith is wounded.  So in the next scene
we learn that Smith must be taken back to England.</P>
<PRE>     "Does he have to go?" Pocahontas asks.</PRE>
<P>     "Going back is his only chance," she is told.  "He'll die if he
stays here."</P>
<P>     In other words, the only way to save this seriously wounded man is
to break his heart by hustling him away in a primitive sailing ship
where he will suffer months at sea in the raging Atlantic Ocean until
he can get to England where some quack with no knowledge of sanitation
or anesthesia will cut him up, bleed him, and then put leeches on his
wounds.  Trust me: he's far better off staying with Pocahontas in the
wilds of old Virginny!</P>
<PRE>     "Will you come with me?" John Smith asks his lady love.</PRE>
<P>     Pocahontas looks up at her father, who tells her, "You must choose
your own path, my daughter."</P>
<P>     So Pocahontas thinks for a moment, then says. "I am needed here."</P>
<PRE>     "Then I will stay here with you," Smith responds.</PRE>
<PRE>     Pocahontas shakes her head.  "No, you have to go back."</PRE>
<P>     And that's that.  The relationship is over and, in the manner of
ONE POTATO, TWO POTATO, the film ends with Pocahontas running after
Smith's ship as it sails away, seeking that one last glimpse of the one
she loves.</P>
<P>     How convenient.  Not only does their interracial love have no
future, but it is the non-white lover who breaks it off, thus saving
the white lover from any suspicion of racism.  Both of their motives
are made pure -- the union simply wasn't meant to be.</P>
<P>     Now, to some, this criticism will seem unfair.  After all, the
real historic Pocahontas didn't marry Captain John Smith, either.
After being abducted by the English in 1612, Pocahontas married a
different white guy, John Rolfe, had a son by him, went with him to
England, and died there of smallpox in 1617.  But if historic accuracy
is an issue, then Disney's POCAHONTAS has other problems.  The real
Pocahontas was only 12 when she rescued John Smith (or performed a
*pretended* rescue as part of a tribal adoption ritual for the good
captain).  The supposed romance never happened, it being an invention
of the 1790s, and the legend has grown ever since.</P>
<P>     So let's not talk history, or even faithfulness to the original
forms of great fairy tales: Disney has never had much regard for
either.  Let's talk cultural bias.  After all, if the studio was
willing to change the poignantly tragic ending of Hans Christian
Anderson's THE LITTLE MERMAID in favor of a happy Hollywood finish,
then why did it break its own tradition this time to give us a tragic
POCAHONTAS?  In the usual manner of film scripting, they could have
merged the character of John Smith with that of John Rolfe and had
Pocahontas marry him.  Then the reward for her courage would have been
complete.  But racism can be a hidden and subtle thing.  I'm sure most
everyone involved with the film felt they had done something truly
advanced and enlightened.</P>
<P>     Well, they certainly tried.  Pocahontas is depicted as
intelligent, independent, fearless, assertive, athletic, and, in the
words of her father, a young woman who "speaks with a wisdom beyond her
years."  She's definitely the best Disney female role model since Belle
in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Furthermore, the film goes out of its way
to be politically correct when it comes to its depiction of Native
Americans.  And it promotes environmentalism in the bargain.  TIME
said, "As teacher of the land's bounty with John Smith as her student,
Pocahontas becomes the first eco-feminist."</P>
<P>     So, despite the fact that Disney Studios couldn't quite shake off
all the vestiges of entrenched, unconscious racism, they at least gave
us a generally positive interracial romance, a strong non-white
heroine, a clear preachment against racial bigotry, and an upbeat
ecological outlook put beautifully to music.  The rest of Hollywood
hasn't given us better, and generally provides much worse.  So, despite
my caveats, I'd recommend taking the kids and making a family affair of
it.  We did.</P>
<P>     And if you happen to find yourself chuckling a bit at the
excessive use of heroic images of Pocahontas perched commandingly atop
precarious precipices, or drifting wistfully through the weaving mist,
her long black hair blowing engagingly about her shoulders and face in
the colorful autumn wind, just remember that this too can be part of
the fun.  And POCAHONTAS is definitely a fun movie.</P>
