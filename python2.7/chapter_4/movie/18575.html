<P>   In the long-running musical "Sunset Boulevard," Norma
Desmond, an aging, has-been actress, misinterprets a call
she receives from Cecil B. DeMille's office.  Thinking that her
long-dormant movie career is about to take off, she heads for
the great man's studio, again full of herself, only to be shot
down.  Nobody wants you when you're old and gray, unless
your name is Gloria Stuart.</P>
<P>   This is true even in Cuba, where a forty-year ethos of so-
called communist equality does not mean celebrity status can
be counted on forever.  Take a marvelous group of singers
and instrumentalists, mainly now in their seventies and
eighties and even beyond.  The group were largely forgotten
until guitarist Ry Cooder--noted for composing the soundtrack
for Win Wenders's unconventional movie "The End of
Violence"--went to Havana to record an album with these
former greats.  The record, entitled "Buena Vista Social
Club,"  sold a million copies and prompted the celebrated
director to travel to Havana to join Cooder next time around.  
As the aging musicians, called by the film crew the Super-
Abuelos," step up to the microphones to record, we get the
feeling that they had not interrupted their calling for a single
day--they are that much at ease with melodious instruments,
both vocal and mechanical.  Wenders follows the crew
around the streets of Havana with side trips to towns like
Santiago, recreating the youths of the musicians now given a
new lease on life.  As we in the United States--for the most
part either discouraged or downright banned from traveling to
that communist-governed island--see the dilapidated but
vibrant streets of that proud nation, we become caught up in
the stories that the performers tell of their greener days while
admiring the joie de vivre of the ordinary people who
enthusiastically mug for the camera.</P>
<P>   Box Office Magazine may have pushed the envelope a bit
when its critic, Wade Major, called this "One of the most
beautiful and poetic documentaries ever made."  (How many
has he seen?) But the film has quite a bit going for it,
principally its structure.  Rather than numb the viewers by a
talking-heads, Q&A with interviewers, Wenders allows each
personality to speak for himself or herself, free-associating
without the intrusive presence of a formal exchange.  Even
better, Wenders allows the music to speak for itself.  This
social club is not made up of now raspy-voice, halting
performers that could remind you of the embarrassing
moments on the Ed Sullivan show when octogenarians
attempted to dance until their breaths ran out.  These people
are so good that they fully justify the standing ovations they
received during their climactic trip to New York at a sold-out
show at Carnegie Hall.  Ibrahim Ferrer, the Santiago-born 70-
year-old singer, knocks out silky renditions of Cuban rhythms.
Close your eyes and you'll think Nat King Cole.  The 90-year-
old, Siboney-born Compay Segundo ("I've been a cigar
smoker for 85 years") endows the film with its opening
humor, as he rides around in the back seat of an aging
convertible asking the local Havana folk facetiously to direct
him to the Buena Vista Social Club.  Compay, who was born
Francisco Repilado, not only continues to strum up a storm
but is credited with inventing his own instrument, the
armonico, a seven-string guitar.  The 80-year-old Ruben
Gonzales does a remarkable job playing piano for the group, 
involving the audience further by reminiscing about his first
piano, essentially the great love of his life.  Omara
Portuondo, the one female of the group, sings a
heartbreaking solo with Ferrer, demonstrating a chemistry
with the man that Hollywood romances would have a tough
time beating.  </P>
<P>   The one song, gratefully repeated by the entire company,
begins with the words "Fire! Fire! I'm burning up.  Call the
fireman!  Tula's room is all ablaze!"  Wenders, who uses
footage from Amsterdam, New York, L.A., and Berlin as well
as Cuba, has us believing this literally, as he conveys the
bliss that each ripened entertainer feels during this musical
feast.</P>
