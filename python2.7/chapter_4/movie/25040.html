<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Robert Aldrich set this epic duel between the king of the hoboes versus
the most sadistic of Railroad Men during the height of the Great
Depression in 1933. The simple story taps in on the hatred the railroad
people have for the tramps. It is about one bum's aim, Lee Marvin, who
is known as A No. 1, king of the hoboes, to ride the previously unridden
No. 19 freight train of the murderous Shack (Ernest Borgnine).</P>
<P>Aldrich for the most part steers clear of the political situation in the
country, instead he uses these men as powerful mythic symbols, showing
the oppressed versus the oppressor. Marvin is laconic, immensely proud
to be a hobo, and proud enough to claim he can ride any train for free.
While Borgnine is a sadist, who sports a menacing grin. He will
sledgehammer anyone to death who thinks they can get a free ride on his
train. Borgnine's claim to fame is, no one gets a free ride on his train
unless they want to be dead. These two are on a collision course and
their dispute can only be settled in a violent manner.</P>
<P>Into the picture comes a young hobo called Cigaret (Keith Carradine),
who has an unmitigating gall for taking risks but has trouble telling
the truth. He has no class in the beginning of the film and no class by
the film's end, as he forces himself on Marvin, riding along with him on
No. 19. Marvin reluctantly tries to make him a hobo, but the kid is a
wise guy, always making a backstabbing remark as a rejoinder to anything
Marvin says.</P>
<P>Marvin announces his challenge to Borgnine on the water tower: A-No. 1
to Portland on train No. 19. This comes after Marvin rode in with
Borgnine to New Orleans for a short hop, but was discovered in the empty
cattle car, when Carradine also jumped in. When Borgnine locks them in
the car, it spells certain doom for them, but Marvin sets the car on
fire and jumps out in time.</P>
<P>Not able to shake Carradine, he acts as a reluctant teacher to him,
trying as best he could to warm up to the obnoxious kid. When they are
spotted by Cracker (Tyner), another enforcer on the train, they are
forced to jump off. But determined to continue, Marvin greases the
tracks to slow down another passenger train and thereby meet No. 19 in
Salem, Oregon.</P>
<P>Trying to teach the kid the ropes, he takes him to a Baptist baptism in
the river and has the kid steal their clothes while they are going
through with the dunking ritual. If the kid could just shut up and be
grateful that he is learning how to be a hobo from the king, Marvin
could have warmed up to him a little.</P>
<P>But Marvin's main beef is with Borgnine. This all leads to the duel
between the steel chain swinging Borgnine and the board wielding Marvin,
as Carradine chickens out and becomes only a cheerleader for Marvin. The
fight atop the moving train is filled with blood and gore.</P>
<P>Marvin is terrific as the spry and wizened hobo. He becomes the only one
to ride No.19 for free. Borgine is a caricature of someone spewing
hatred. Carradine is the one who breaks the illusion that all the hoboes
are good and all the railroad men bad. Aldrich's film is muscular,
depicting the natural beauty of the Oregon countryside, while the
aimless life of the hoboes is humorously set in motion. It's just too
bad that the director couldn't connect all the dots with the corrupt
political situation that caused this great suffering and left so many
with hardened hearts.</P>
