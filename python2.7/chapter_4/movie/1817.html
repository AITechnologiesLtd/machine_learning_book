<PRE>                                  EL MARIACHI
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1993 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     EL MARIACHI is written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. It stars
Carlos Gallardo, Consuelo Gomez, and Peter Marquardt.  In Spanish, with
English subtitles. Rated R, due to violence.</P>
<P>     EL MARIACHI is not a great film, but it is a remarkable one, and
it may be the harbinger of an important new filmmaker.  The filmmaker
is Robert Rodriguez, an Austin, Texas, writer-director. His plan was to
make EL MARIACHI on the cheap, sell it to the Mexican video market,
take the profits and make two more Spanish-language films which he
could parlay into a slightly larger English-language film, and then
break into Hollywood. To raise part of the $7,000 he budgeted for his
first film, he volunteered for a drug experiment at his school, the
University of Texas, Austin; four weeks later he had $3,000, a script,
and one of his actors, Peter Marquardt (who would play the gringo drug
lord). He and his co-producer and star, Carlos Gallardo, shot the film
in a week, using mostly local townsfolk in a border town, Cd. Acuna,
Coahuila. For dolly shots, Gallardo pushed Rodriguez in a borrowed
wheelchair as Rodriguez shot with a borrowed camera. He filmed in 16-mm
and edited in video. He inserted footage of a mostly inert pit bull
whenever the narrative was out of synch with the film.</P>
<P>     His film style appears to be modeled on the Coen brothers, or
perhaps satirizing it: violent subject matter, some black humor, fast
camera movements, fish-eye distortions, and speeded-up action
sequences. As for a moral center, the film is a more than a little
tentative. This is not Peckinpah, not yet at least, but the mariachi of
the title does have a sense of who he meant to be and who he became
instead. But mostly this is an action film that puts its energy into
being energetic. Still the characters, especially the mariachi and the
woman bar-owner he falls in with are interesting characters, credible
and likable. The plot, the characters, the editing, the use of music,
the direction, and the inventiveness in the face of a nearly cash-free
production are worthy of our attention.</P>
<P>     Rodriguez' plan, by the way, went somewhat awry when EL MARIACHI
unexpectedly attracted a studio bidding war. When the dust settled,
Columbia had agreed to distribute the film to twenty U.S. cities in
Spanish with English subtitles and signed Rodriguez to work on a $5
million or $6 million remake (or sequel -- I've read both).</P>
<P>     Admittedly, EL MARIACHI has a freak-show element to it -- not
unlike Dr. Johnson's crack about the woman preacher ("The wonder, sir,
is not that she preach well, but that she preach at all") -- but there
is something under the student razzle-dazzle and the gee-whiz appeal of
the story of the film's making that attracts me, entertains me, and
makes me hope for more miracles from Robert Rodriguez.</P>
<P>     If EL MARIACHI plays near you, I highly recommend you see it, even
at full ticket price.</P>
