<P>   If your kids are not into heavy metal, there's no better way
to introduce them to the genre than by taking them to "The
Iron Giant."  With a month remaining to the summer, I'll
wager this will iron out as the summer's best family film,
"Tarzan" notwithstanding.  There are benefits for adults as
well.  1) The usual mature stuff is thrown into this
well-written, non-preachy morality tale; 2) the adult
paraphernalia will soar over the head of the small fry but will
glide by so quickly they won't notice that they've missed a
thing; 3) the picture at eighty minutes in length does not
overtax its invitation; 4) best of all, there's no Broadway
soundtrack or icky songs.  The strangest business about this
movie, a circumstance that doesn't bode well for human
actors in this age of digitalized everything, is that when bad
things happen to the title character, you may actually feel like
shedding a tear.  That's how well-developed the big metal
monster is, while at the same time the human, er, animated
people are three-dimensional.  With voices like Jennifer
Aniston's as the concerned mom, Eli Marienthal's as the
principal kid Hogarth Hughes, Vin Diesel's as the Giant and
Christopher McDonald's as the (of course) villainous
government agent, Warner Bros. has on its hands a package
that is well-written, appropriately soundtracked, though with
animation that falls way short of the "Tarzan" density--but
with a genuine story to tell, who cares?</P>
<P>   Brad Bird, who directs the picture which was co-written by
Tim McCanlies from a Ted Hughes book, keeps the action
situated in 1957 for good reason.  The 50's was the duck-
and-cover decade, a time that schoolchildren were convinced
they could not be touched by nuclear weapons as long as
they had a school desk to crouch under.  With the U.S.
government seeing a Communist conspiracy under every rock
and with the possibility that the Iron Giant could be a Red-
created Trojan horse, the Pentagon could not be expected to
restrain itself form using the ultimate weapon on a seemingly
indestructible force.  Or as one agent says, if it's not made in
the U.S., "we'll blow it to kingdom come."  The story takes
place in the picturesque town of Rockwell, Maine, home of
10-year-old Hogarth Hughes (voice of Eli Marienthal) and his
mother Annie (voice of Jennifer Aniston).  From the beginning
we are privy to the boy's interest in pets.  He's had a raccoon
that caused mayhem and his mom will therefore not allow
him to adopt the squirrel he has smuggled into his mother's
coffee shop.  One night, Hogarth goes into the woods to
check out a noise.  Confronting the 100-foot giant that some
local seamen had reported seeing, he is at first afraid, but
when he cuts the power to an large electric generator that the
giant was in the process of eating--thereby saving the big
guy from the shock of his life--the two become friends. 
Hogarth and a beatnik artist neighbor whose work consists of
selling scrap iron and turning some of the product into
sculptures are ultimately pitted against the forces of
government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald) and
the U.S. army--who are determined to cut the behemoth
down.</P>
<P>   Throughout the tale, we become convinced that its writers
are politically anti-violence, whether the savagery consists of
attempts at destroying the friendly Frankenstein monster or of
shooting the local deer for pure sport.  The Iron Giant himself
can represent any human beings who are treated in our
society with less than toleration.  Interestingly enough,
Hogarth teaches the townspeople to call the Giant HIM and
not IT--perhaps the key moral point that the picture makes--
since we human beings have the tendency to depersonalize
anyone we hate to make ourselves appear less culpable
when attacking.</P>
<P>   Comic touches abound throughout, both the visual imagery
(the way Hogarth's eyeballs frequently rotate when he is
thinking deeply or reacting to stimuli) or verbal (as the beatnik
Dean McCoppen, voiced by Harry Connick Jr., whines that he
can easily sell his scrap iron "but when I turn it into art, I
can't give it away").</P>
<P>   The film's greatest success lay in audience reaction.  At
the sneak preview screening I attended, which was populated
by a massive colony of small fry, there was not a peep in the
audience--a situation which is all too rate with the
constituency of a mature adult film.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG.  Running Time: 80 minutes.  (C) 1999
