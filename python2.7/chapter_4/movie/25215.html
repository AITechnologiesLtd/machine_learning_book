<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>Pro wrestling, for me, has always been kind of like a traffic accident -- 
you don't really want to watch, but you just can't look away. I was a big
fan of the World Wrestling Federation back in the mid-1980s. These were
the days when Hulk Hogan was king of the ring, Andre the Giant was a
feared presence lurking in the background, and one of the WWF's biggest
heels (that's wrestling parlance for "villain") was -- wait for it -- an
Elvis impersonator.</P>
<P>I eventually grew out of wrestling, and for a decade I didn't really pay
it much attention. But the WWF (and its lesser-known competitors, the WCW
and ECW) have been increasingly hard to ignore in recent years. The action
is riskier, the characters sleazier, and the sexual innuendo almost
palpable. Wrestlers parade across the screen in the company of
enormously-endowed women, make profane gestures at the audience, shove
soiled underwear in their opponents' faces, and generally behave like
raving savages.</P>
<P>I consider myself a fairly discriminating viewer. I detest programmes that
insult my intelligence and flaunt gratuitous violence and sex. So why do I
find myself anticipating word of the latest WWF shenanigans? Why do I sit
in front of the tube and watch people pummel each other with any object at
hand? Witness choreographed posturing so exaggeratedly scripted as to
utterly defy suspension of disbelief? Good questions.</P>
<P>Barry Blaustein, the director of the new wrestling documentary "Beyond The
Mat" -- the first documentary shown in St John's theatres in my memory,
and quite possibly ever -- seems to be wondering these things too, 
although he never confronts the answer directly. Instead, Blaustein's film
is more of a travelogue, taking us from a sort of "minor league"
wrestlers' training school, to the WWF itself, to the careers of wrestlers
past their prime. It gives the documentary a somewhat lightweight feel,
but the subject matter is bleak enough that this might not be such a bad
thing.</P>
<P>Blaustein focuses mainly on three wrestlers. There's Terry Funk, a fifty
year-old grizzled veteran of the ring. We follow Funk as he visits his
doctor, and witness the x-rays that so tellingly demonstrate the effects
of his career on his health. His knees are devastated, and the doctor
sounds almost incredulous when he wonders that Funk isn't already in
extreme pain.</P>
<P>Then there's Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who was one of wrestling's big guns
when I was young. Roberts' career has taken a turn for the worse, as an
addiction to crack cocaine has caught up with him. Now he earns his keep
wrestling no-name jobbers in small towns, trying to support his habit. The
change between Roberts in and out of the ring is striking. In front of the
audience, he's almost the wrestler of old, working the crowd like a
master. Out of the limelight, he's a haunted, broken man. We learn of his
tragic past, including abandoning university for wrestling to earn the
love of his ex-wrestler father.</P>
<P>Most telling of all is Roberts' hesitant, detached reunion with his
estranged daughter. His only defense against her charges that he was never
there when she was young? That he had to wrestle, two dozen times or more
a month. If he had taken three months off to be with his family, WWF
President Vince McMahon would have had him fired. There are many careers
which take people away from their families for extended periods of time.
How many virtually hold them hostage in doing so?</P>
<P>But "Beyond The Mat" doesn't just dwell on wrestling's dark side. The
third featured wrestler, Mick Foley, clearly loves the game as much as
anyone could. We see him battering his body mercilessly, punishing himself
more than most of us could bear -- and survive it not just intact, but
grinning. At the time "Beyond The Mat" was taped, Foley was one of the
biggest draws in the WWF (he has since retired due to mounting injuries).
His charisma and enthusiasm leap off the screen.</P>
<P>But even this is tempered by scenes involving Foley's young son and
daughter. Before a big match, Foley reminds them that it's all just an
act, and the other wrestler -- the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) -- doesn't really
hate him. But when the Rock beats Foley with a steel chair over and over
and over again, his children still cry, and his even his wife looks on in
abject terror. When Blaustein shows Foley this footage, the wrestler is
uncharacteristically subdued. That he regrets what he puts his family
through is undeniable. But, as he himself says, if he didn't wrestle what
would he do?</P>
<P>"Beyond The Mat" is not a perfect film. Blaustein lingers too long on some
subjects. There is an overlong depiction of Funk's farewell bout, for
example, made all the more pointless by the revelation that he returned to
wrestling just months later. Some topics are glossed over or ignored
altogether -- for instance, the topic of women in wrestling merits just a
few soundbites from the wrestler known as Chyna (Joanie Laurer), and is
rather glibly assessed. Blaustein also neglects such popular controversies
as the death of Owen Hart, the betrayal of Hart's brother Bret by McMahon,
and the allegations of sexual impropriety by ex-wrestler Sable (Rena Mero).</P>
<P>But maybe what this points to is that there is more going on outside the
frame of the weekly wrestling programmes than can be contained in one
documentary. Certainly, Blaustein has more than enough material for
"Beyond The Mat II".</P>
<P>I noticed that the promotional poster for "Beyond The Mat" loudly declares
this to be "the movie Vince McMahon doesn't want you to see!" That's
because McMahon has forbidden the airing of the movie's trailer during WWF
broadcasts. But is this a genuine move to counter what I guess McMahon 
sees as negative publicity, or just a ploy for media attention? Where
wrestling is concerned, who can say?</P>
