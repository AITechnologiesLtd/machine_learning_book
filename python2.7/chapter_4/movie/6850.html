<PRE>                                THE RELIC
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>It is early January and for the most part, those films that were not
expected to be Oscar-nominated because they were so miserable, are now
brought to light.  One such is RELIC, a science-fiction film ridden
with cliches.</P>
<P>There is hardly a well-lit scene in the entire film.  Making dark
scenes and using green ominous lighting to denote fear and terror are,
of course, old tricks of the trade.  Another is sudden LOUD sounds. It
seems that every scene-change was accompanied by a very loud crash that
had nothing to do with the scene on the screen. One noise that is
supposed to scare is a cat knocking something over.  Give me a break.</P>
<P>The film has no science worthy of the name but a good deal of fiction.
"The basic premise," says Douglas Preston, who along with Lincoln Child
wriote the book on which the film is based, "is that a virus can
introduce genetic material into your own DNA which produces a hormone
that can produce dramatic physical changes.</P>
<P>There are many examples in the animal world, such as a tadpole turning
into a frog."  Hardly the same thing.</P>
<P>In the film, there is an animal on a rampage of murder.  Because of the
lighting we barely see the creature until it is on fire and dashes thru
the passageways.  That is the only bit of special effects worth
mentioning.  OTOH, there are other special effects such as Dr. Margo
Green (Penelope Ann Miller) an evolutionary biologist (sure!) who goes
through hell without hardly a hair out of place.  She is even given the
opportunity to wear a tightly-fitting black sheath dress that also
remains almost pristine.  I think one shoulder strap slid a bit off her
shoulder.</P>
<P>When all hell is breaking loose in the Museum, with people running out
into the street and police spurring them on to leave quickly, police
and ambulance sirens shrieking, Dr Green and Dr Frock (defrock?) (James
Whitmore) are in the lab joking and carrying on a friendly conversation
while waiting for the results of something they are testing.  HELP!</P>
<P>Also lending his talents, as Detective Lt. D'Agosta are Tom Sizemore
and Linda Hunt as Dr Cuthbert, the head of the museum.</P>
<PRE>Enough said.</PRE>
