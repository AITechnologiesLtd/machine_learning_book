<PRE>IRON GIANT</PRE>
<P>  Despite the decade's reputation for depravity and lowest common denominator
crappiness, the 90's have actually produced a whole slew of intelligent and
superbly crafted family films. From wickedly imaginative fantasies like The
Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach to more down to earth
dramas like Harriet the Spy and Fly Away Home, a wide range of high quality
films have brightened up what might otherwise be known as the John Hughes
kicked-in-the-balls period. Now there's a new movie to add to the modern family
classics category, a movie that will also take its place among the best all
around films of the '90s and the greatest animated features ever made. And to
my delight, this movie happens to be about a giant robot.
  Iron Giant delivers as a giant robot film, depicting all manner of robotic
adventure for its wonderful, retro-styled title automaton. You get to see the
robot flying, fighting, carrying people, shooting beams out of its eyes -
everything you'd expect. But for this film, that stuff is only the surface -
even if it doesn't need to be. Most likely, Iron Giant is not what you expect.
It could easily join Toy Story and Babe in a trilogy of warm, compassionate
fairy tales with universal appeal. Like its predecessors, Iron Giant is a
nearly flawless masterpiece of cinematic storytelling. The basic premise - boy
befriends giant robot from space - is an old one, but it comes out feeling like
something entirely unique. It is fortified with healthy doses of humor and
invention that will appeal to adults even more than to children. At the sneak
preview screening I attended, the audience was mostly made up of adults who
seemed to think they were just treating their small children to the latest
kiddy flick. They ended up laughing loud and hard from beginning to end. 
  Most importantly, Iron Giant continues the Toy Story/Babe tradition by
instilling a strong sense of humanity and emotion into a character we wouldn't
have imagined could be so moving. I never in a million years would have
expected to care about a talking pig the way I do Babe, so that was one of that
film's most surprising qualities. It also seems a bit odd to get tingles from a
clunky action figure of a spaceman super hero, but that's just what happens
when I watch Buzz Lightyear realize he's only a toy and try to fly anyway. 
  I did expect to like the giant robot of Iron Giant, because I'm the sort of
guy who likes that sort of thing. But I couldn't have hoped for such a moving,
Frankenstein's-monster-like personality inside this cool-looking mass of metal.
All of the characters, even the humorously xenophobic villain, have enough
dimension and humanity to them to make the story inescapably compelling. At one
point in the movie it occurred to me that the giant might live out a certain
tragic tradition of giant robot stories, and suddenly I found myself crying.
Now that I didn't expect.</P>
<P>  Unlike recent non-Disney hits like Anastasia and Prince of Egypt, it's
actually difficult to think of Iron Giant (which was produced by Warner
Brothers) in terms of Disney animation. Despite being an all ages animated
fable, Iron Giant is a completely different animal. I like Tarzan, and the way
it sticks its toes just a little bit outside the borders of the Disney formula.
I think it is more dramatic and emotional than most Disney films, and I
appreciate the lack of musical sequences. When compared to Iron Giant, though,
Tarzan seems laughable and by-the-numbers. Iron Giant doesn't skewer animation
tradition, but it doesn't follow formula at the expense of story. You don't get
the feeling that this is a commercial endeavor, where merchandising and
marketability are first or even second priorities. They're not even a factor at
all. This is just good old fashioned storytelling that seems to be effortlessly
universal in its appeal.
  Iron Giant isn't a musical either, but unlike Tarzan it doesn't bow to the
Toy Story inspired Middle-Aged-Rock-Crooner-Replaces-Show-Tunes formula. The
story takes place in the '50s, and most of the music (besides Michael Kamen's
mythic score) is period source music that usually wafts out of some distant
radio, like in the kitchen of the café where young Hogarth's mom works. We're
talking sound design more along the lines of Jaws than Beauty and the Beast. It
helps to give the film a realistic, live action feel. The atmosphere is
somewhat akin to that of Kiki's Delivery Service - a magical animated fantasy
that manages to depict reality a little more convincingly than many live action
films. 
  (It is significant to note that producer Pete Townshend recorded a rock opera
concept album based on the same Ted Hughes book the film is based on. Keeping
this in mind, it's hard to believe the filmmakers were actually able to fulfill
their vision. Call me pessimistic, but I think Disney would have forced songs
on them.)
  Tarzan, despite its fairly serious tone (I am still very fond of the scene
where Tarzan kills a leopard and hoists its corpse above his head) is saddled
by a couple of cartoony comic relief sidekicks who occasionally let their zany
antics and references interfere with the story. They're tame by Disney
standards, so they don't seem that bad in Tarzan. 
  But Iron Giant has no comic relief characters or wacky sidekicks. At the same
time, I can't think of a Disney movie that made me laugh half as hard as Iron
Giant. Instead of having characters in the story whose job it is to be funny,
the main characters themselves are funny and face funny situations. Director
Brad Bird helmed early episodes of The Simpsons and helped establish many of
the show's longstanding storytelling techniques, so perhaps it shouldn't be
surprising that the many funny scenes in Iron Giant are masterfully executed.</P>
<P>  It is surprising, though, or at least refreshing, how genuinely warm and
human the movie is. I think a lot of people will see that it's a non-Disney
animated feature and expect the kind of saccharine pseudo-sweetness they get
from movies like Balto or the sinister works of Don Bluth. You know, the movies
where shots of cute animals or sad orphan girls batting their eyelashes are
what passes for emotion. Hogarth is the real thing - a believable and likable
child protagonist. You can relate to him because he's smart and self-reliant
and likes to watch monster movies. 
  In his Family Dog episode of Amazing Stories, Bird displayed a knack for
depicting realistic children and getting great performances out of child voice
actors. This tradition is continued with Hogarth, who is superbly portrayed by
Eli Marienthal. In most ways, Hogarth behaves just like a normal kid, reading
comic books and playing in the lake. To me he seemed just like the kids who
were in the theater, telling each other that the giant wouldn't harm anyone
because "he's a good guy." But while Hogarth seems like a normal kid, it also
seems perfectly natural when he forms unusual friendships and performs acts of
genuine heroism. I think a lot of filmmakers, and not only those who work in
animation, could learn from the characterization in this movie.
  Hogarth's relationship with the robot begins with a situation thematically
similar to the unforgettable pitbull rescue in Babe: Pig in the City. Hogarth
encounters the huge metal creature stomping through the woods and he thinks -
maybe even correctly - that it's trying to kill him. Hogarth gets his chance to
escape when the metal monster trips into a web of power lines. Seeing it writhe
in pain, Hogarth perhaps sees that there is something human about the giant,
and he risks himself to save it from electrocution.
  This act of kindness is the beginning of a relationship in which the boy
helps the machine realize that he can be more than a weapon. The giant turns
out to be almost more of a boy than Hogarth, so much so that he idolizes
Superman. Even if Iron Giant were a shoddy piece of filmmaking, I'd probably be
suckered just by that wonderful notion: the powerful giant robot from outer
space who likes to play Superman. Lucky for me (and everyone who's not a
sucker) that's just one of many beautiful touches on this animated masterpiece,
which is easily my favorite film of the year so far. It's an instant classic
which will surely be remembered alongside the likes of the aforementioned
Kiki's Delivery Service, Toy Story and Babe - movies that make you smile just
thinking about them.</P>
