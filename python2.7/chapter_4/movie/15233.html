<P>It should be recorded that Stephen Spielberg was involved with one
solid antiwar film in 1998. That film is Dreamwork's "Toy Soldiers,"
not the flag-waving "Saving Private Ryan." "Toy Soldiers" received
some praise for the animatronic designs, which give the toy soldiers
life-like motion and three-dimensionality, but the underlying story
will last with you much longer than the special effects.</P>
<P>"Toy Soldiers" is a clever satire on the culture behind the
testosterone-laden combat toys hawked to little boys on Saturday
morning television. Denis Leary plays the head of a huge conglomerate
that began in the munitions business, but is now gobbling up new
companies left and right in order to diversify. The latest acquisition
is a toy company run by a couple of naïfs. He tells them to come up
with a toy soldier that will really do the sort of things that you see
on the television commercials: climb up hills, swim across rivers,
jump from airplanes. Most importantly, this toy soldier must destroy
its enemy, a companion toy called the Gorgothon. Desperate to please
his new boss, one of the toy company executives decides to use a
special artificial intelligence microchip from the munitions division
of the conglomerate to satisfy the big boss's demands. To everybody's
shock, the chip does this and much more.</P>
<P>The toy soldiers and their Gorgothon prey end up at a "warm and fuzzy"
toy store, where violent toys are prohibited by the owner who is away
on a business trip. Alan Abernathy , his teenage son (played ably by
Gregory Smith), is watching the store and decides to sell the toys
since business has been so slow.</P>
<P>On the very first night, the toy soldiers bust out of their boxes and
gather around their leader, Chip Hazard (voice by Tommy Lee Jones),
who delivers a hilarious speech to his assembled troops. He manages to
include just about every bloody cliché ever heard in a war movie,
while pacing back and forth in front of a huge American flag. To leave
no doubt, the film score quotes the musical theme from "Patton." The
gist of Hazard's speech is that the Gorgothon must be killed because
they "are the enemy." This injunction, just as the ones that are given
to raw recruits in the wars of our 20th century, is all that is
necessary.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Gorgothons, while unlovely to the eye, are about as
gentle and lovable a group as one can imagine. Their leader is Archer
(voice by Frank Langella), who has the head of a lion and a quiver of
arrows on his powerful back. There is a striking similarity between
this toy monster and the extraterrestrial killer in "Predator," who is
pursued and destroyed by a Chip Hazard-like Arnold Schwarzenegger in
the jungles of Central America. The movie subverts these identities,
however. The solider becomes the insane pursuer, while the monster
simply desires to live in peace. Why are the monsters hated? The toy
soldiers have the answer. They are DIFFERENT. They have been
programmed to hate the OTHER.</P>
<P>After the Gorgothons take refuge in Alan's home, the toy soldiers
decide to take his girl-friend (Kristen Dunst) as hostage. She will be
returned safely if he turns over the Gorgothons. His refusal to do
this leads to a riotous climax that owes much to the movie "Gremlins."
Since Joe Dante directed both "Gremlins" and "Toy Soldiers," the
combination of slapstick and violence is immediately recognizable as
his signature. What makes "Toy Soldiers" different, however, is that
our fear ultimately is not of some green creature from outer space,
but our own military culture.</P>
<P>Hollywood's ambivalence about military culture goes to the roots of
our dilemma as a people. The Hollywood moguls grouped around
Dreamworks are solid liberals who can deplore war toys in one movie
and then turn around and make another that glorifies America's
military exploits. The reason for this is obvious. "America," as James
William Gibson, author of "Warrior Dreams" states, "has always had a
war culture, and that long history of martial adventures provides a
crucial background for understanding the post-Vietnam warrior."
"Warrior Dreams" is a study of the film iconography of the Reagan era,
one that "Toy Soldiers" is a pointed footnote to.</P>
<P>The Minutemen of the American Revolution were warrior heroes, who set
an example not only for the Indian killers of the nineteenth century
but Teddy Roosevelt's "harum-scarum Rough Riders" as well. The legend
of Roosevelt's victory at San Juan Hill was actually recorded by
Vitagraph. To make a more exciting newsreel, the Vitagraph
photographers and the Rough Riders staged a mock battle at Santiago
Bay after the real fighting was over. World War One and World War Two
replenished the mythology of the warrior hero. So by the time the
Vietnam War started, millions of young American men had already been
acculturated to violence and domination, as Ron Kovic put it in "Born
on the Fourth of July":</P>
<P>"Every Saturday afternoon we'd go down to the movies in the shopping
center and watch gigantic prehistoric birds breathe fire, and war
movies with John Wayne and Audie Murphy. Bobbie's mother always packed
us a bagful of candy. I'll never forget Audie Murphy in To Hell and
Back. At the end he jumps on top of a flaming tank that's just about
to explode and grabs the machine gun, blasting it into the German
lines. He was so brave I had chills running up and down my back,
wishing it were me up there. There were gasoline flames roaring around
his legs, but he just kept firing that machine gun. It was the
greatest movie I ever saw in my life."</P>
<P>This scene not only inspired Ron Kovic to join the Marines and lose
his legs in Vietnam, it is also very similar to the blockbuster finale
of "Saving Private Ryan," a movie that might inspire the next
generation of Ron Kovics to go off to distant lands in pursuit of
warrior dreams. It is a sign of the peculiar divided consciousness of
late 20th century American capitalism that it is simultaneously
producing its own most dedicated propagandists and social critics,
often combined in the same individual. Such a tension can not remain
permanent.</P>
