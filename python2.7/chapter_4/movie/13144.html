<P>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)</P>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is one of the most
successful and beloved Westerns of all time.  The
film stars attractive and likeable Paul Newman and Robert
Redford, there are many action scenes and humorous lines,
and there is good cinematography.</P>
<P>Still, I found the film to be somewhat disappointing.
It is a good movie, but the personalities of the
main characters (engaging nice guys) do not match
their actions (ruthless bank robbers).  Many scenes
rely too heavily on the dialogue interplay between
Newman and Redford, which is only mildly entertaining.
The film has some slow moments, such as the series of
still photographs showing Redford, Newman and Katherine
Ross living it up prior to visiting Bolivia.  The comic
relief characters, such as Woodcock (who blathers on
about his loyalty to the unseen Mr. Harriman) and the
Bolivian old-timer (who not only constantly spits, but
keeps up a monologue about his success in doing
so) are charmingly eccentric but not completely credible.
Ross is never wanted by the police in Bolivia despite
participating in robberies there.  They are highly
conspicuous, yet spend much time at restaurants,
taverns, etc.</P>
<P>Newman and Redford are bank and train robbers in the
old west at the turn of the century.  The railroad
hires a team of crack lawmen and trackers to hunt them
down.  Newman and Redford, with their mutual girlfriend
Katherine Ross, flee to Bolivia, where they resume
robbing banks.  But they are soon hunted there, as well.</P>
<P>There are some spoilers in what follows.</P>
<P>Clues to the film's ending are obvious.  A friendly
sherrif tells them that their days are numbered and
that they will die a bloody death.  Ross says that
she doesn't want to be present when they are killed.
I felt that these hints, especially Ross's, were too
heavy-handed.</P>
<P>"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" won the Golden
Globe for Best Picture, and was nominated for Best
Picture by the Academy, correctly losing to "Midnight
Cowboy".  "Butch Cassidy" is also noted for the
Burt Bacharach score.</P>
