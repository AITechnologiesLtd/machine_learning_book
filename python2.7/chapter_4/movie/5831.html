<P>     Ron Shelton appears to understand two things better than any other
contemporary film-maker:  sports, and Kevin Costner.  Put a sports movie
in the hands of almost any other director, and you get the feeling that
they're just biding their time until the big climactic game/fight/match;
put Kevin Costner in the hands of almost any other director, and you find
the thin-voiced actor placed in the uncomfortable position of playing
commanding and heroic.  When the two men joined forced previously, for
1988's BULL DURHAM, the result was one of the best and funniest sports
films ever, and probably Costner's best performance ever.  That casually
charming Costner is re-born in TIN CUP, yet another superior Shelton
sports film overflowing with pleasures.</P>
<P>     Costner plays Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy, a one-time college golf star now
reduced to operating a run-down driving range in the west Texas town of
Salome.  He also gives lessons, and one of his students is Dr. Molly
Griswold (Rene Russo), a therapist newly arrived in Salome who immediately
captures Roy's fancy.  Unfortunately, Molly is already involved with David
Simms (Don Johnson), a tour pro who used to be Ray's college team-mate and
now is his rival.  Roy is determined to win Molly over by playing in the
U. S. Open, but first he needs to overcome the quality which sunk his
professional prospects, his insistence on going for the impossible shot
rather than playing the percentages.  For that he will require someone to
help him with his "head game," and the only therapist in town happens to
be Molly.</P>
<P>     There are a lot of Kevin Costner bashers out there -- I have been
known to be one of them -- who have forgotten that he became a star in
films like BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS which allowed him to be warm,
funny and approachable.  That is too bad, but it happened because Costner
himself and plenty of other directors forgot, too.  They keep trying to
turn him into an icon -- witness ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES, JFK, WYATT
EARP and WATERWORLD -- and he generally winds up looking sour and 
constipated throughout.  TIN CUP is a reminder of Costner at his best,
boyishly handsome and with an equally boyish temperament, and he has so
much effortless fun playing Roy that it is nearly impossible not to have
fun with him.  He is like a Little League player who never out-grew Little
League, always swinging for the fences and always eager to please.
Costner manages to make immaturity incredibly endearing.</P>
<P>     Shelton has given Costner a great character to work with, and has
fashioned a great story around that character.  BULL DURHAM was so
authentic in its detail about minor league baseball that it was easy to
overlook the fact that Shelton made a film that wasn't just about
baseball.  It was about playing a game because you loved it so much you
couldn't imagine doing anything else, and the frustration of seeing a
player with less love (Tim Robbins' Nuke LaLoosh) have so much more
talent.  This time, Costner gets to play the equivalent of Nuke, a player
with "a million dollar arm and a fifty cent head," in a story that is not
just about golf.  Roy's problem is that he understands all too well that
fans don't watch professional sports to see the steady hitter, the guy who
runs the precise receiving route, or the guy who can make all his free
throws; they watch to see the home run hitter, the flashy runner, or the
360 degree dunk.  Roy could never be the steady player because he is too
obsessed with creating that moment of glory, and it is both an
acknowledgment and a subversion of the way sports movies are supposed to
end when Roy finally gets that moment of glory.</P>
<P>     That is what makes a Ron Shelton sports movie better than anyone
else's sports movies:  he has a better understanding of the way fans and
players think.  He also knows how to create scenes which sing with
unexpected wit.  Roy is always willing to take a bet on an improbable
shot, and some of TIN CUP's best moments involve those bets, including one
in which Roy uses a bag of garden tools to play.  Shelton also gives his
actors subtly eccentric characters to play, with tremendous results.  Rene
Russo is sexy and off-center as Molly, Don Johnson is a perfect arrogant
foil, and Cheech Marin does superb supporting work as Roy's friend and
caddy Romeo.  Only the leisurely, golf-like pace of TIN CUP proves
troubling -- at 135 minutes, it has a few too many dead spots, and a
rather unnecessary tangent involving Roy's stripper ex-girlfriend.  But by
the time TIN CUP ends, those moments will have been forgotten.  You'll be
thinking about how smartly and cleverly Ron Shelton can write a sports
film, how good Kevin Costner can be in them, and how many sports might be
left on which they can collaborate.</P>
