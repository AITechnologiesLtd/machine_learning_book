<P>Martin Lawrence is a talented comedian, but too often he gets stuck with
creaky material, such as the script to the mediocre action comedy
_Blue_Streak_.  Lawrence plays Miles Logan, an expert jewel thief who
poses as a cop to retrieve a diamond he unwittingly hid at a
then-under-construction police station years ago.  Far-fetched
fish-out-of-water hijinks ensue, with Miles somehow getting promoted up
the ranks and showing the ropes to a wet-behind-the-ears partner (Luke
Wilson).  There are a handful of funny lines and situations, but Lawrence
is always better than the script, his charisma and infectious energy
shining through, even during some forced set pieces such as one scene
where Miles does an unfunny dance dressed as a pizza delivery boy.</P>
<P>Like _Blue_Streak_, once-great NBA rebounder Dennis Rodman's latest bid
for big-screen stardom, _Simon_Sez_, is actually an _intentional_
comedy--but one quickly wishes that the film were played as straight as
the advertising.  That's because the sight of Rodman earnestly growling
such tough guy lines as "It ain't... _over_" as Interpol agent
extraordinaire Simon is infinitely more hilarious than the excrutiating
"comic relief" provided by his perpetually punchlining sidekick (Dane
Cook) and a couple of goofy "cybermonks" (don't ask).  With such sheer
ineptitude onscreen--get a load of the obvious blue screen compositing
and phony-looking visual effects--it's amazing that this hack job didn't
go straight to video.  But that's just as well--it's probably already
hitting shelves as you read this.</P>
