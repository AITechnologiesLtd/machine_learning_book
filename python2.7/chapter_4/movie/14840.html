<P>Plot: In a mysterious city where the sunlight never shines, John Murdoch 
wakes in a hotel room with no memory of who he is. He is pursued by 
police who suspect that he is responsible for a series of  killings of  
prostitutes; a creepy doctor who insists that he is insane; and 
mysterious aliens in black coats and fedoras who place the entire city 
to sleep on the stroke of midnight while they manipulate its fundamental 
structure. However Murdoch finds he is the only person who can not be 
made to sleep by the aliens and that he shares some of their 
reality-manipulating abilities. In his efforts to understand the 
situation, he comes to discover that the entire city is a vast 
laboratory being used in experiments by the aliens to reorder and 
transplant people's memories in an attempt to penetrate the secret of 
the human soul.</P>
<P>Forget about what Variety and a number of the other trained-monkey 
mainstream reviewers have said about 'Dark City' being confusing and 
hard to follow. I can say without any hesitation that this is one of the 
most conceptually audacious and best sf films I have seen in the last 
few years.</P>
<P>It is the second film of Alex Proyas, who made a striking debut with the 
darkly driven and nihilistic 'The Crow' in 1994. The film is clearly a 
very personal project of Proyas's - he also had a strong hand in the 
script - and marks him as one of the directors most worth keeping an eye 
on in future. It is a film that eludes any easy pigeonholing. It 
seemingly takes place in a world of self-conscious artifice that 
suggests a collision between 'Brazil' and 'The Maltese Falcon'. Here 
Proyas deliberately evokes film noir - everyone dresses in trench coats 
and hats, the women come across as slinky vamps, the cars are all period 
and the technology has a striking 1940s retro look. (The city was built 
entirely stagebound inside Australia's Movie World studios). But there 
is also a dystopian feel to it too - there are times the film is 
extraordinarily threatening -  a visit to a cafe where each item of food 
sits in a compartment of its own in a backlit glass case is striking. 
Proyas shoots it all in a beautiful, virtually monochrome lighting 
scheme that renders the city as permanent night-time - one where the 
recurrent vision of a sunlit, palm-shaded beach (even when it is 
revealed as only a faded mural) becomes an achingly palpable 
representation of all hope.</P>
<P>Of course in this noir world everything is far from normal. In an almost 
classical setup the hero wakes in a hotel room with complete amnesia and 
to find himself on the run from the police as a suspected killer. But 
then in the first of the film's wild spins finds he is immune to (and 
maybe even one of) a group of bald aliens beneath the city who on the 
stroke of midnight each night cause the populace to fall asleep while 
they rearrange the spatial geometry and the very fabric of reality 
within the city. After several wild (but completely logical) twists the 
hero makes a classical conceptual breakthrough to discover that the city 
is an experiment set up by the aliens to determine the nature of the 
human soul by manipulating and transplanting people's memories. One of 
the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film comes when he tries to 
explain to his wife that the memories of their marriage are entirely 
false and were only implanted the previous night, only to have her 
tearfully protest "But they can't be - I love you." An extraordinary 
film.</P>
