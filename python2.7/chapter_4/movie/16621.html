<PRE>A Bug's Life (**** out of ******)</PRE>
<P>A review from the  Stockholm Film Review
<A HREF="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/heat/435/">http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/heat/435/</A></P>
<P>Worker ant Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) has a streak of individuality 
that constantly gets him into trouble. He invents things, to the 
bemusement of the rest of the ant colony, and he lands himself (and the 
colony) in big trouble when one of his inventions, an automatic 
harvester of grass seeds, causes the destruction of a food pile, the 
collection of which had occupied the whole colony for the summer. The 
problem for the colony is that the pile of food had been the annual 
offering to a group of bullying grasshoppers, who will destroy the 
colony if they do not get their food. When the grasshoppers, led by the 
cruel Hopper (Kevin Spacey) discovers the lack of food, he demands a 
double supply of food to be gathered before the end of the summer.</P>
<P>The colony is led by the ant Queen (Phylis Diller) who has given most of 
her responsibilities to her neurotic daughter Princess Atta (Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus). While Atta and her staff debate Flik's punishment, he 
suggests that he will travel from the colony (which is on an island) to 
find a bunch of warrior insects who will free them from Hopper's 
tyranny. The colony are glad to be rid of him and don't give him any 
chance of success. On his journey, Flik encounters a down-trodden (flea) 
circus of various insects and mistakes them for a bunch of fierce 
soldiers he and brings them back to the colony. The troupe think that 
they have been hired to give a performance. </P>
<P>John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton set a very high standard for 
computer-generated animation with Toy Story (1995), which evoked classic 
Disney animation values, with breathtaking animation, exciting story and 
a sharp and witty script which worked on two levels; amusing and 
entertaining kids and grown-ups equally. This time, the release of Antz 
(with a broadly similar backdrop and story) has added an extra 
competitive edge. And while both movies feature with a plucky individual 
ant, they are really quite different.</P>
<P>A Bug's Life is a far lighter movie in tone than Antz, and it is easy to 
see how the movie follows the traditional Disney formula. The animation 
is bright and colourful, and the humour is broad and wholesome, aimed 
squarely at the kiddies. Most of the characters are lovable (apart from 
Hopper) , and differ in appearance from each other (important for the 
cuddly toy spin-off market). Much of the humour is derived from the 
silly voices, antics and inept circus acts of the circus troupe - one of 
the most enjoyable scenes of the film is when the circus troupe try 
unsuccessfully to entertain a bunch of bored and unappreciative 
fruitflies. </P>
<P>Funnily enough, it is the fact that this is unashamedly a children's 
movie that points up the main weakness of the film. Like Toy Story, a 
number of celebrities appear (courtesy of their famous voices). However, 
the series that feature these actors, such as Frazier (David Hyde 
Pierce), Seinfeld (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Spin City (Richard Kind) are 
unlikely to mean much to the average eight or nine year old. Moreover, 
their personas in the film are pretty much the same as those for which 
they are better known on TV. Therefore Hyde Pierce is a haughty stick 
insect (Slim), Louis-Dreyfus is a neurotic whiner and Kind (as a 
grasshopper called Molt) is a big goofy but well-meaning sidekick to 
Hopper. The problem is, they don't seem half as funny in the film, as 
they do in their familiar TV surroundings. Louis-Dreyfus is particulary 
grating. This is due, in no small part, to the script. It is rather 
bland, and only Kevin Spacey gets lines worthy of his menacing character 
(but the bad guy always gets the best lines in movies).</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong - this is a fine entertaining movie for kids, which 
is exactly what it was intended to be. But the animation is not as 
well-detailed or spectacular as Antz, and as a follow-up to Toy Story, 
it certainly doesn't have the same impact. There were scenes in Antz 
that I felt simply could not have been made as well using traditional 
animation, whereas A Bug's Life, in it's structure and visual effects, 
looks as if it could have been made twenty years ago. But maybe that is 
no bad thing either. </P>
<P>It is also a rather cloying movie, with the moral of the story well and 
truly rammed home. However, before you, as a viewer, go home after the 
show, be sure to watch the end credits(after the theme song has played). 
It is the wittiest part of the movie.</P>
