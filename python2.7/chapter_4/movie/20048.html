<PRE>Love Stinks (R) ** 1/2
Starring French Stewart, Bridgette Wilson
Directed by Jeff Franklin
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Attending Love Stinks more than a month before it actually opens, I am actually
here with my first movie review (imagine me, 12, and seeing a special
screening!) before a movie opens. Luckily, I saw Love Stinks, a film that
reminds us just how funny well-used bathroom humor can be.</P>
<P>Seth Winnick (Stewart, Harry from 3rd Rock From the Sun) is a writer for a new
sitcom called Jesse & Rebecca. He meets Chelsea (Wilson) at his fellow writer's
wedding. Instantly overcome with love he brings to the planetarium to dance
under the stars, and their romance begins. She redecorates his apartment and
makes him get allergy shots to live with her beloved cat, but she soon becomes
more and more controlling. </P>
<P>But what Chelsea is really after is someone to marry. On Valentine's Day Seth
says he might marry her in a year, and she settles for it. But when I comes
around that time next year, he doesn't propose. She sues him for palimony and
begins ruining his life, he does the same to her. Throwing her cat off a pier
(could that be a inspiration from There's Something About Mary popping up
again?) and inviting over the sexy bimbo she asked him not to cast on his show.</P>
<P>Yes, the film contains a lot of bathroom humor. However, (I am ashamed to say)
that most of it is pretty darn funny. Another nice thing about Love Stinks is
the way that the story is told in flashbacks. Stewart gives a fine performance,
although his character seems very Harry-ized (read 2nd paragraph) and I wonder
if he can do any other types of acting. Also performing well is Tyra Banks, in
her movie debut, she adds a different touch to some of the scenes.</P>
<P>Looking for an intelligent and witty sophisticated film? Not one ounce is to be
found here, but if your just looking to laugh regularly in a darkened theater
for 90 minutes or so, see Love Stinks which gets ** 1/2 stars.</P>
