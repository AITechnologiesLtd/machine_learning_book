                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Remember "The Poseidon Adventure"? It was one of the grandfathers of the
modern disaster movies, spawning "Airport", "Towering Inferno" and
zillions more. The latest off-spring takes after its ancestor more than
just in theme.</P>
<P>Somewhere in a small darkened room in LA, a studio executive sat
watching the upside-down ship disaster and had a flash of insight. They
could remake the film, but set it in the Manhattan-New Jersey tunnel and
cast Sylvester Stallone. There would be all of the same elements that
were in the popular movie from over 25 years ago: running for higher
ground to escape drowning in rushing waters, fires burning from the
walls for no apparent reason, hold-your-breath underwater scenes, a
racially and socially mixed group of survivors trying to make their way
to the top while some die on the way. And it will make tons at the box
office.</P>
<P>This is what is known in Hollywood as a "high concept". Out here in the
real world, high concepts often result in what is known as a "bad
movie".</P>
<P>A car-jacking trio of punks decide to make their getaway in the tunnel
-- it=92s easy to understand why they turned to a life of crime since the=
y
obviously couldn=92t get into the college of their choice because they
didn't understand the spatial relationship of how a tunnel works. The
equation 1 Exit =3D Easily Trapped never crosses their minds.</P>
<P>It turns out that it doesn't matter much as a few seconds later, their
vehicle careens into a truck loaded with toxic waste which blows up in a
fireball that shoots down the tunnel much like the scene from
"Independence Day". So much like it that it seems a waste to have spent
all of those big bucks on the special effects when they could have just
clipped film from "ID4".</P>
<P>The blast collapses the tunnel on both ends and kills the crooks and
just about everyone else on the highway except our intrepid band of
barely adequate actors. Stallone is on the outside and must jump through
a series of gigantic fans to come to the rescue. The fans can only be
turned off for a few seconds and each conveniently comes equipped with a
red digital timer installed, I suppose, so that anyone having to vault
through them would know how much time he has left.</P>
<P>He gets in, some people die, some live. Some are brave, some are not.
There's a lot of water and explosions. There=92s a big dog. No one cares.=</P>
