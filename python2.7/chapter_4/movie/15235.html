<PRE>                            THE AVENGERS1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
             0 out of 4 for a British sort of embarrassment</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent.
Screenplay:  Don Macpherson.
Producer:  Jerry Weintraub.
Director:  Jeremiah Chechik.</P>
<P>This is the worst movie I've viewed so far in 98. THE AVENGERS = silly =
man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil
scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil, Sir August De
Wynter wearing kilt. The question is what could have gone wrong with a
potentially great idea with big name cast? The same question was
probably asked of last year's stinker BATMAN and ROBIN. I feel the
production got a little too smug, the script a little to smart and
direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided
together to form a movie.</P>
<P>My greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry
between Emma Peel and John Steed (Thurman and Fiennes) – something that
was a vital element of the 60's TV serial of the same name. The dialogue
goes on and on about tea and other finer British perks, but does not
allow much room for character development and interaction, except to
perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves. One wonders why the dynamic pair
bother kissing in the end except for pure English formality. Connery as
Sir August, does not fair better than Thurman or Fiennes. His dialogue
is as erratic as stormy weather, mostly embarrassing and poor quality.</P>
<P>If there is a movie you would prefer never to see, I believe THE
AVENGERS would be a good choice. For one thing, you will not have to
witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names
that is associated with the title. I cannot understand how something so
poorly produced could have been released, but I put it down to one of
those freak happenings in nature, like lightning you can't see it coming
until it hits you.</P>
