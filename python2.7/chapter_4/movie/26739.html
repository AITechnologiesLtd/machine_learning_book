<PRE>LIVE NUDE GIRLS UNITE!
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Some people spend time thinking about unions.  A lot of people spend 
time thinking about sex.  Very few of us combine these thoughts, but 
directors Vicky Funari (PAULINA) and Julia Query do in their fascinating 
peek into the labor struggles of a group of sex workers, a.k.a. 
strippers, at by-the-quarter peep shows.  LIVE NUDE GIRLS UNITE! tells 
the inside story of the well publicized organizing effort by the sex 
workers at the Lusty Lady in San Francisco, which, we are told, has 
mainly female owners and managers.  </P>
<P>Julia Query, a stripper as well as the co-director, is one of the 
documentary's central characters.  A writer and stand-up comic, she was 
a "professional dominatrix" prior to becoming a stripper.  As the story 
opens, a girl, representing the younger Julia, draws in a coloring book 
about Dr. Martin Luther King.  Julia fancies herself as a major activist 
for justice like her mother, a doctor who has dedicated her career to 
the betterment of the lives of prostitutes through proper health care.  
(Her mother hates the idea of her daughter being a sex worker, and the 
scene in which she first tells her mother about her job is quite 
dramatic.)</P>
<P>The documentary features lots of full frontal nudity, as would be 
expected.  This could be criticized in that it does raise the 
titillation factor, but, without it, it would be hard to imagine exactly 
what goes on behind the glass curtain.  Basically, the women work in a 
large tank, dancing and cavorting while men on the other side of the 
glass perform solo sex in little booths.  Yes, it is as sleazy as it 
sounds.  The women, however, are frequently mothers and college 
graduates who look upon their time dancing together as something between 
a girl's slumber party and a grueling day of hard physical labor.</P>
<P>What motivated the workers to be the first in their industry to organize 
were the working conditions.  At the top of their complaint list was the 
treatment of sickness.  Most companies allow sick workers to stay at 
home, but not the Lusty Lady, which is typical according to the film.  
If sick, a woman could have her salary cut and even be fired.  To avoid 
such penalties, a woman was required to find a replacement who had 
breasts at least as large as hers and skin at least as white.  A 
secondary issue for them was scheduling based on race, since management 
believed that the men preferred blonde Caucasians.  Their reasoning was 
that blonde Caucasians were by far and away the most popular choice for 
porn video sales.</P>
<P>Once the workers go on strike, they think up some of the funniest 
slogans and chants you can imagine to popularize their cause.  Most, 
however, are unprintable.  One that is printable appeared on a button: 
"Bad Girls Like Good Contracts."  They also had one of the more unusual 
job actions in the history of labor fights.  They tried keeping their 
legs closed while dancing in order to discourage the patrons.</P>
<P>The last third of the movie concerns the offers and counteroffers during 
the negotiations between union and management.  It is intriguing but 
covers more traditional material.  The only questionable choice the 
documentarians made was to include some simple cartoon figures to 
illustrate some of their points.  They are funny and cute, but the women 
themselves are more interesting.</P>
<P>When asked to summarize her job as a stripper, one of them says simply, 
"boring!"  This is something that could never be said of LIVE NUDE GIRLS 
UNITE!, a mesmerizing examination of a world that most of us have never 
seen and never will.  The film also provides your one opportunity to say 
to someone, the ticket seller in this case, "I'd like Live Nude Girls, 
please."</P>
<P>LIVE NUDE GIRLS UNITE! runs a fast 1:20.  It is not rated by the MPAA 
but would be rated NC-17 for graphic nudity and strong language.  It 
would be acceptable for college students.</P>
