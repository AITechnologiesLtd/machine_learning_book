<PRE>                                FAITHFUL
                       A film review by Scott Marcus
                        Copyright 1996 Scott Marcus</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Cher, Chazz Palminteri, Ryan O'Neal, Paul Mazursky
Director: Paul Mazursky
Screenplay: Chazz Palminteri, based on his play
Running Time: 89 minutes
Grade: C</PRE>
<P>First question: why does anyone let Ryan O'Neal act in their movies
anymore? And, not only let him in, but give him a starring role. He's
at best a has-been, though many would consider him a never-was.
Anyway, he ruined any chance this movie might have had in my mind.</P>
<P>The setup is about the most interesting thing the film has going for
it. A couple, Margaret O'Donnell (Cher) and her husband Jack (Ryan
O'Neal) are celebrating their 20th anniversary. They've each got a
little surprise for the other, though. The movie is based on
Palminteri's play, where it may have worked better than on the big
screen.</P>
<P>Tony (Chazz Palminteri) shows up at the couple's mansion, claiming
that someone - he believes it's the husband, Jack - has hired him to
kill Maggie. Tony has problems: he constantly has to stop and talk to
his psychiatrist - played adequately by director Paul Mazursky - over
the phone. It's no surprise that the emotionally confused hit-man is
the strongest character: Mr. Palminteri wrote the film, after all,
and saves the juiciest lines for himself.</P>
<P>There are some very good moments, reminiscent of the film SLEUTH, when
the audience doesn't know which way things are going to go, or if
everyone is really who they claim to be. These moments, however, are
not enough to save the film. There are numerous plot holes, and quite
a few developments that make little or no sense, once the denouement
comes. For instance, why are there no servants? This really bothered
me. The O'Donnell's live in a huge mansion, own a Ferrari and a Rolls
Royce, and yet he makes his own breakfast, and she does her own
shopping.</P>
<P>It also bothered me that the characters would switch between being
clever and being stupid from scene to scene. I just didn't see any
consistent characterizations; transformations came at will, with no
justification. Contrast this with SLEUTH. In that film, Michael
Caine and Laurence Olivier are both extremely clever, and continually
outmaneuver each other. Here, the characters mostly seem to fumble
over one another, except for a few times when they act intelligently.</P>
<P>The bright spots of the film - Mr. Palminteri's performance, some of
the dialogue, and the set-up - are not enough, ultimately, to save the
film. I grade it a mediocre C.</P>
