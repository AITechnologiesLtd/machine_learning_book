<P>'The Skulls' was such a disappointment.  More than that it was appalling and
downright destined for the 'Dawson's Creek' generation and no one else.  In
fact, this could have been a 'Dawson's Creek' episode where people would
say: "Wow, how bizarre.  I never thought I would ever see an episode like
this".....much in the same way that fans of 'The X-Files' re-acted when they
saw their first humour episode of the show.....the only difference is that
'The X-Files' is usually brilliant and is certainly landmark television.  I
wanted to see this film eagerly because, allegedly, it is based on fact,
however loosely.  It's an intriguing premise.  A group of ivy league
freshmen at a prestigious American university take a vow and become members
of a secret society which amounts to little more than selling you soul to
the devil.  The cars, the cash, the women and the political connections make
you almost untouchable.  The seductive aspect of these creature comforts is
stamped with a hot branding mark on your body in the form of a skull that
makes you a distinct member of the society.  There is also the hidden crypt
where meetings take place, a wrist watch in the form of a skull and a code
of conduct guide in the form of a pocketbook that you are to keep in your
possession at all times.  The movie alleges that three former presidents of
the United States are members and the real life curiosity of the media
prompted them to ask a former president and his son if they're former
members.</P>
<P>Joshua Jackson of television's 'Dawson's Creek' is Luke McNamara, a young
man with a seemingly bright future who gets more than he bargains for when
he joins a secret society with all the trappings mentioned in the above
paragraph.  Luke's closest friends in life are his girlfriend Chloe (Leslie
Bibb) and his best buddy Will (Hill Harper).  Luke makes friends and a fresh
face in his life is Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker).  Caleb's father Judge
Litten Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) is a reigning power within the skulls and
welcomes new members with the aid of Senator Ames Levritt (William Petersen)
and the university provost, Lombard (Christopher McDonald).</P>
<P>As I was watching this film I was reminded of how some film makers bite off
more than they can chew.  This film is the perfect Saturday night popcorn
movie rental when it comes to home video where a group of teenage girls will
gather around their television and swoon over the two young male leads.
Fine, but what about something for the rest of us.  This film is also
unintentionally funny to the worst extent.  It constantly looks like the
actors are trying to pull off dramatic situations and they keep tripping
over themselves and can't find the whirlwind of success in pulling it off.</P>
<P>Director Rob Cohen who made a startlingly brilliant television movie for HBO
in 1998 entitled 'The Rat Pack' which captured perfectly the lives of
entertainers Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford,
is at the head of 'The Skulls'.  Cohen also made a fine bio pic of martial
arts legend Bruce Lee in 1993 entitled 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' and
Cohen has a knack for capturing the nostalgia of a certain period with fluid
filming and a brisk pace to shower audiences with entertainment.  He should
have seen the light at the end of the tunnel here.  Writer John Pogue's
screenplay is like a blister driving you mad.  You keep hoping the pain will
go away but it only gets worse.</P>
<P>The climax tries to usher in an old fashioned way for gentlemen to settle
their differences but you can rent Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' to see
it done in a much better fashion.  It's also a climax (again,
unintentionally funny) where you don't care one bit about what happens to
the characters.  I was actually sitting there with my eyes closed and my
hand in front of my face and glancing up every few seconds because it was so
bad and now I guess I'll tell you how I REALLY felt about the movie!
: - )</P>
<P>Oh, well, with a film this bad, we at least know that given the treatment by
this motion picture that if this type of thing does exist in real life, we
know the perpetrators are definitely safe!  But there is no safe part of
this movie which will make you attack the movie theatre's cashier in an
attempt to get your money back.</P>
<PRE>OUT OF 4 > zero</PRE>
<P>A film must receive a three star rating or higher to be eligible for a
recommendation.</P>
