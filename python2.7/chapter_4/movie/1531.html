                       A film review by Frank Maloney

<PRE>Following are three non-reviews:</PRE>
<P>################################################</P>
<P>LITTLE NEMO: ADVENTURES IN SLUMBERLAND is an animated feature film,
directed by Masami Hata and William Hurtz and written by Chris Columbus
and Richard Outten.  The voices are provided by Mickey Rooney, Rene
Auberjonois, and Gabriel Damon.  Rated G.</P>
<P>Little Nemo was the great, landmark creation of Winsor McCay, who was
one the most popular, most influential cartoonists in American history.
McCay can also be considered the father of animation due to his
pioneering animated cartoon "Gertie the Dinosaur."  "Little Nemo" ran in
newspapers for two decades and was immensely popular.  Today, we can
only look at those strips in wonder and amazement and with no little
sadness at the degradation of the medium in our niggardly times.</P>
<P>It was because of my admiration for McCay (who also authored the surreal
strip "Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend") that I had to see this animated
film.  The film successfully recreates much of McCay's art style, eerie,
monumental dream imagery full of surprise, wit, and irrational
juxtapositions.  Unfortunately, despite the presence of some important
talent, the filmmakers hedged their bet with a number of non-McCay
intrusions.  Little Nemo himself is too cute; the mischief making
trickster too nice; there's a flying squirrel buddy; there's a major
steal from the "Night on Bare Mountain" sequence in FANTASIA; and there
is a throw-away score of songs by the same Sherman Brothers who wrote
the songs for MARY POPPINS.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers ignored the
Victor Herbert Broadway version of Little Nemo, a smash hit of the 1908
season.</P>
<P>Overall, I found the film charming and engaging, probably not entirely
appropriate for the youngest children, and can recommend it to you at
matinee prices or as a future video rental or purchase.</P>
<P>#################################################</P>
<P>RAPID FIRE is a film directed by Dwight Little and written by Alan
McElroy.  It stars Brandon Lee, Powers Boothe, Nick Mancuso.  Rated R,
for chopsocky violence.  This is, of course, the vehicle meant to launch
Brandon Lee, Bruce Lee's son, as a film star.  While the film is never
going to be the pet of filmschools, it does deliver its promise of a
presentable action film.  And it is less gross, less gruesome than most
of the present generation of actions films, such as those of Van Damme
or Seagal.  In style and mood, it is closer to the older Lee's
swashbuckling, kidding movies.  The story is perfectly predictable, and
the addition of Tienanmen Square and a call to political responsibility
are not meant to be taken too seriously.  However, McElroy's script does
attempt to make the hero human and likeable.  The character actors are
fun to watch, too: Tzi Ma as an Asian godfather; Powers Boothe as the
good cop; and especially, Nick Mancuso as the psycho heavy.  I think Lee
does have a future; he has presence and some competence as an actor; he
is not so intense as his dad, but rather laid-back, slightly yuppified,
non-arrogant.</P>
<P>I can recommend RAPID FIRE at matinee prices or as a winter video treat.</P>
<P>################################################</P>
<P>STAY TUNED is a film directed by Peter Hyams and written by Tom
S. Parker & Jim Jennewein.  It stars John Ritter, Pam Dawber, Jeffrey
Jones, and Eugene Levy.  Rated PG.  This is one of those supremely dumb
movies that I am a sucker for.  Of course, TV is too easy a target of
satire.  Of course, having former TV personalities in the cast is
obvious.  But then, again, why not, it's summertime and the living is
easy.  This is, obviously, not a film to take seriously, but it's fun
enough while it lasts to justify a matinee ticket, especially if like me
one has an irrational fondness for John Ritter, despite his willingness
to appear to total dreck like the PROBLEM CHILD flicks; I concentrate on
his other, better kind of films, the ones no one goes to, like THEY ALL
LAUGHED and that theater farce he did with Carol Burnett et al.  at the
beginning of the summer.  This is somewhere in between, mostly harmless,
and that's high praise these days.  Jeffry Jones is always fun to watch,
too, and his track record is possibly even worse than Ritter's.  </P>
<P>Probably, you should save this one for a really dreary winter day and
rent the video.</P>
