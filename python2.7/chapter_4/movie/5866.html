<PRE>                            FROM DUSK TILL DAWN
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        If Beavis and Butthead had a favorite movie, FROM 
DUSK TILL DAWN would probably be it. Scripted by Quentin 
Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado), the 
movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is 
incredibly fun to watch. It starts off as a PULP FICTION-type 
crime story, with criminal brothers George Clooney and Tarantino 
robbing a convenience store. Because this is a Tarantino movie, 
however, it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot, it's 
a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand, a man on fire 
jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as 
they drive away.
        The opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the 
movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems. Clooney 
and Tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an RV 
with a family in it. Harvey Keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher 
and Juliette Lewis his daughter, whom registered sex-pervert 
Tarantino eyes endlessly. You know you're mentally unbalanced 
when you find Lewis the least bit attractive, although she's not 
nearly as obnoxious as usual in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.</P>
<P>        The first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages 
trying to get to and through the Mexico border, Clooney's strategy 
involving hiding in the RV shower while Lewis is on the toilet. It 
does its trick; the border guard takes one look at Lewis relieving 
herself and immediately goes blind, never noticing Clooney or 
Tarantino.</P>
<P>        Once they get to Mexico, it's time to wait at the rendezvous 
point, a topless bar called Titty Twister where we're once again 
reminded Tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off 
the foot of a stripper. Finally, after about ten minutes of intercut 
boob shots and Clooney forcing Keitel and Lewis to drink with 
him, the stripper turns into a vampire. Soon half the people in the 
bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back.</P>
<P>        That's right, we've come all this way to see a vampire 
movie. But like everything else, Tarantino takes this age-old genre 
and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment. 
So we get holy water condom balloons, heads rolling, quadruple 
impalement on an overturned table and Keitel getting bitten by a 
vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he 
becomes "a lap dog of Satan."</P>
<P>        The FROM DUSK TILL DAWN dialogue is 100% 
Tarantino, hovering between absurd and disgusting (as when 
they're entering the nightclub and Cheech Marin announces the 
main attractions of the Titty Twister), but always entertaining, and 
is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of 
being one more second-rate gorefest. Clooney, Keitel and especially 
Tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue 
is that much more hilarious, ensuring not one second of FROM 
DUSK TILL DAWN is taken the least bit seriously.</P>
<P>        Stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie, but 
Tarantino and Rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain 
people, even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to 
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. PULP FICTION had the vulgarity 
and violence for a reason, but this movie just throws it out for 
cheap entertainment. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN isn't the classic 
of modern cinema that PF is, but is does prove you can do a 
good job making a really bad movie.</P>
