<PRE>                            GRACE OF MY HEART
                       A film review by Dave Cowen
                        Copyright 1996 Dave Cowen</PRE>
<P>Just into the second act of GRACE OF MY HEART came a disarming moment
which I was never quite able to recover from.  Up until that moment
the casting of the film was contemporary and vibrant: John Turturro
and Eric Stoltz give hilariously fast-talking performances, while 
Bridget Fonda steals the show as a disturbed Lesley Gore.  However, 
after seeing punkers Redd Cross strike Gen-X poses over Matt Dillon 
and leer at a theremin player making horrible noise during a failed 
studio session modeled after the Beach Boys' sessions while producing 
the never-released _Smile_, I knew that I couldn't quite trust the 
film any longer.</P>
<P>In GRACE OF MY HEART, Illeana Douglas plays Edna Buxton, a "willful"
young woman who swaps dresses and musical numbers at the last minute 
in order to wow the crowd at a talent audition, finding herself the 
winner of a recording contract in New York.  That recording contract
never comes, and Edna finds herself destitute in New York.  A crying
fit at an audition nets her a lunch meeting with nice hebrew boy
Joel Millner, played by John Turturro as if he were the Barton Fink
of the music business, who convinces her to change her name and become
a songwriter.  The film follows Edna, loosely modeled on Carol King, 
through two decades of hits, misses, and her three failed relationships 
with industry insiders.  </P>
<P>Director Allison Anders literally races through the first half of the 
film, favoring distracting jump cuts between lines of dialogue and 
quick montages to lay out Edna's rise as one of the premier 
songwriters of the Brill Building era.  First encounters with Turturro, 
Eric Stoltz's Howard Cazsatt and Bridget Fonda's Kelly Porter border on 
the berzerk, bringing the film an endearing manic quality.  The use of 
original music, written by the likes of Los Lobos and Elvis Costello, 
saves this first half of the film from the kind of false sentimentality 
that usually grounds films similar to GRACE in nature.</P>
<P>After speeding through a brief relationship with a timid DJ, played by 
Bruce Davison, GRACE OF MY HEART takes a left turn when Matt Dillon's
character Jay Phillips is introduced.  Dillon brings to his character
a deliberately dazed impression of Beach Boys leader/producer Brian 
Wilson.  Dillon gets the carefully studied mannerisms and motions
right, but ultimately seems out of place in the part -- his teen idol 
reputation obscures the boyish quality that the real Brian Wilson
always seems to exhibit.  The film strikes an eerie note as Phillips
and Buxton marry: while Dillon's Brian Wilson may not be entirely
convincing, Illeana Douglas is a dead ringer for Wilson's real-life 
ex-wife, Marilyn.</P>
<P>The pace of the film slows as it portrays Phillip's descent into 
paranoia and isolation.  As an exploration of the downfall of 
Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, the film provides a fascinating 
portrait -- but as the film shifts focus from Edna to Jay, it begins
to lose the emotional bond that the audience had created with Edna.  
At the end of the second act, an acceptably accurate portrayal of 
Brian Wilson's life is completely invalidated by a drastic action, 
and the film's tone switches again.</P>
<P>As followers of the Beach Boys know, Brian Wilson began to live his
life in bed, gaining weight hundreds of pounds over his normal size
and isolating his wife.  Earlier in the second act, Edna explains 
to rival songwriter Cheryl that she would stay with Brian no matter
how far he descended into madness.  In real life, that ended up in
years of isolation for Wilson's wife, and an eventual break-up --
and I had completely assumed that the plot would continue to follow
Wilson's life into order to make an ironic point about Edna's 
useless relations with men.  However. instead of continuing to use
Wilson's life as a drive for the film, Anders forcibly steers the 
script away from the Phillips character in order to finish the film 
with an ending which paints a much more rosy picture of Edna's life
than would seem necessary.</P>
<P>Throughout the first two acts, GRACE OF MY HEART is an invigorating
film: and unlike many other viewers who have found the second act
to be tedious, I was perfectly happy to accept the change in tone 
between the first and second acts, possibly out of my personal 
interest in Brian Wilson's life.  In the final minutes of the film, 
however, Anders drops both the manic energy of the first half and
the biographical portrait of the second in favor of Hollywood-style 
schmaltz.</P>
<P>As much as the film has extremely glaring faults, I do have to 
recommend it.  There's a lot to like in the film: Turturro fills
his scenes with charm, and Douglas is positively radiant.  Only 
the poor editing of the first half, where Anders compresses time 
to a ridiculous extent (in one scene, Anders doesn't even give Edna 
three seconds to walk over and greet a character, instead cutting 
directly to their embrace) and the distressingly commercial finale 
lowers my impression of the film.  At the very least, fans of Brian 
Wilson should get a tremendous kick out of Dillon's maligned
impression -- and fans of the music of the 50's and early 60's 
should be very pleased by the original music..</P>
