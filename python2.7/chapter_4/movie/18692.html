<P>AMONG GIANTS (M).  
(Fox Searchlight/Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: Sam Miller
Stars: Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Griffiths, James Thornton, Lennie 
James, Andy Serkis, Rob Jarvis, Alan 
Williams, Sharon Bower, Steve Huison
Running time: 94 minutes.</P>
<P>Simon Beaufoy, writer of The Full Monty, knows the depressing
working class areas of northern England quite well, and he returns to
this familiar background for the setting of his latest film.  However,
Among Giants is a decidedly inferior film, lacking the charm, warmth,
gritty honesty, and winning humour that made that modest film a crowd
pleaser.</P>
<P>Actually written before The Full Monty, Among Giants deals
with a team of unemployed painters who land a covert contract to paint
a series of electricity pylons spanning the Yorkshire hills during the
summer.  It's a job of high risks, uncertain payments and plenty of
challenges.  The foreman of this motley group is the hard-as-nails Ray
(Pete Postlethwaite, from The Usual Suspects, etc).  Ray is divorced
and shares a house with his younger work mate Steven (James Thornton).
Their friendship is shaken up by the arrival of Gerry (Rachel
Griffiths), a nomadic Australian who has spent most of her adult life
backpacking around the world.  On a whim, Ray hires the feisty
Australian to work as part of the crew.</P>
<P>Romance slowly develops between Ray and Gerry, much to the
consternation of Steve.  This odd couple romance is the least credible
part of the film, and, despite the solid performances of the two
leads, it never really works or sets the screen on fire.  This
mismatched pair also engage in a bit of gratuitous full frontal nudity
for a scene set in an abandoned water tower that is far from erotic.
Gerry's sudden and uncharacteristic decision to settle down and
establish roots with Ray is also unconvincing, and never totally
works.</P>
<P>Among Giants is a fairly conventional and shallow film that is
at its best when exploring the camaraderie between the work crew as
they undertake the challenge of painting 150 steel towers in a couple
of months.  Beaufoy's script is also at its best as it explores the
humour, mateship and sense of identity that unites the working class
in this bleak post-Thatcher Britain.</P>
<P>Among Giants is not a film for those who suffer from vertigo
as there are many scenes set high above the ground.  At times Witold
Stok's camera whirls with dizzying speed through the countryside.
Director Sam Miller hails from a television background, and he handles
his first feature film in a fairly straight forward and uninspired
fashion.</P>
<P>The solid cast try hard, and bring a bristling energy to the
material.  Postlethwaite in particular seems uncomfortable in the role
of a romantic lead.  Newcomer Thornton delivers a sympathetic
performance as Steven and establishes himself as an actor to watch in
the future.</P>
<P>But, otherwise, this unspectacular and often pedestrian
romantic drama seems little more than a high class, big budget
television movie.</P>
