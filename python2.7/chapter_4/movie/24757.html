<PRE>Rating: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Rated PG: sexual innuendo and humor, language, mild slapstick violence.</P>
<P>Starring: Mark Addy, Kirsten Johnston, Jane Krowkowski Stephen Baldwin, Alan
Cumming, Joan Collins, Voice of Rosie O' Donnell.
Running time: 90 minutes</P>
<PRE>Directed by: Brian Levant.</PRE>
<P>In 1994, a family film opened with a 37.2 million dollar weekend, and went on
to gross a little under $140m. That film was based on a hugely popular cartoon
entitled "The Flintstones"...the movies name? The Flinstones. The huge hit
starred John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney, Elizabeth
Perkins as Wilma and Rosie O'Donnel as Betty. The co-stars were Joan Collins,
Kyle McLachlan and Halle Berry. It was a very good family movie, with some
terrific acting and special effects. Now in 2000 we get the long-awaited sequel
"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas", which isn't as good as the first movie.</P>
<P>Now the worst thing about the film is the actors: Mark Addy (an english guy) as
Fred Flintstone who was previously in the great film "The Full Monty" gives a
terrible performance as Fred. Stephen Baldwin (LOL) as Barney...is well
indescribably bad, but the two stars that shine in the lead roles is Kirsten
Johnston as Wilma, and Jane Krowkowski as Better. Kirsten who is in the NBC
show "3rd Rock From the Sun" plays Wilma very well, and brings her
characteristics out, as well as her character herself. Jane who is on the huge
show "Ally McBeal" is beautiful as Betty, and makes me wonder why Rosie
O'Donnell was picked to play Betty in the first film. She fits the character
greatly, looks like Betty, and acts like Betty. Mark Addy is a great actor, but
just doesn't have the capacities to play Fred Flintstone, he doesn't look like
Fred, act like Fred nor does he talk like Fred. Now for Stephen Baldwin,
although he looks like Barney, he doesn't have the mental capacity to play him,
because to me Barney is smarter.</P>
<P>Now for the plot of the movie: Years before Fred and Wilma meet, years before
Barney and Betty meet, Fred wishes for the person that is meant for him to be
out there, and Wilma wishes to go to Bedrock and out of her rich home. Wilma
leaves and meets Betty and moves in with her. They become best friends, as is
Fred and Barney. Fred and Barney meet Wilma and Betty at a Burger King type of
place, and they go on a double date, only to have several misadventures such as
Chip Rockefeller trying to woo Wilma to marry him and get rid of Fred, and a
little alien who is sent to Earth to study the human mating rituals. The story
is quite good, and tells alot about the Flintstones past, and is well
developed, like how Dino came along, how they got married, and how they lived.</P>
<P>The major flaw in this film is the cast though, we could have easily gotten a
better Fred and Barney, but Wilma and Betty are priceless, the great supporting
cast includes: Joan Collins as Wilma's mother, Thomas Gibson as Chip, and
several other cameos. The movie has some great sequences, and the special
effects are quite well developed, but it's missing the charm of the first film,
as well as the comedy. This one seems to be directed towards adults, and
contains some sexual humor that at times for a PG film is quite frank. It's not
a terrible film, but I could have wished for a better Flintstones movie, with a
much better cast.</P>
