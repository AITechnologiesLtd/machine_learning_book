<PRE>"The Gleaners & I" </PRE>
<P>The gleaners of yesteryear were peasant women who rummaged for the bits of 
wheat left over from the harvest. Documentary filmmaker Agnes Varda studies 
the modern day foragers of France who now glean (or, gather) everything 
from grapes to garbage to clocks without hands in "The Gleaners & I." </P>
<P>This is an uneven little documentary that benefits, greatly, from its 
untapped subject matter. As far as I know, there has not been another film 
to cover the lifestyle of the gleaners of the world, and the grandma of 
French New Wave cinema, Varda, gives us a unique view into an unusual 
world. </P>
<P>The original gleaners had been such a presence in the old agrarian culture 
of France that it eventually became the institutionalized right of the 
practitioners of the gathering art. Today, legal statutes guarantee that 
the traditional rights of the gleaner continue, unfettered, following the 
harvests throughout the country. We learn about the differences between the 
gleaners, who turn the earth to find their treasures, and the pickers, who 
invade the vineyards and orchards after the harvest. There is even a 
subculture that reserves the right to glean oysters following that harvest. </P>
<P>Varda goes on to compare the nature of gleaning and the similar methods 
that the urban homeless use to garner enough to eat and live, without 
money, in the cities. The marketplaces that carry the fresh produce for the 
urban areas, at the end of the day, become the place for the scavengers to 
go to search for anything that is left behind. Fresh fruit and veggies, 
cheese, meat and fish are gathered to feed those who take the time to live 
off of the land. </P>
<P>Varda's roving video camera follows other modern gleaners who choose to 
collect the cast-asides of society, like TV's, refrigerators and stoves, to 
repair and sell to survive. Still other foragers use the public's detritus 
for more esoteric uses, like artistic expression. Today, gleaning is not 
just for wheat gatherers anymore. </P>
<P>Agnes Varda captures some fascinating moments during the course of "The 
Gleaners & I," but as I said earlier, the effort is uneven. Some of the 
more interesting stories and styles are given short shrift, while other, 
less interesting, subjects are given far too much air time. Varda also 
intrudes herself in the film (the "& I" of the title) in an effort to show 
that she, with her video camera, is simply another gleaner let loose on the 
world. When the documentarian chooses to be a subject and not just an 
observer, attention is taken from the real subject. She indulges, in one 
far too long a scene, in taping a dangling lens cap from a camera left 
running. The dance of the cap reps Varda's own gleaning of the images she 
captures, accidentally or not. Mostly, her intruding is an annoyance in 
what is otherwise an interesting documentary. </P>
<P>I give a qualified recommendation for "The Gleaners & I" since it offers a 
view into a world unknown to us. In fact, with the American obsession with 
rights of privacy and property, the gleaner could not even exist here, but 
continues to thrive in France. I give it a C+. </P>
