Susan Granger's review of "ROAD TRIP" (DreamWorks Pictures)</PRE>
<P>         This is a silly, sophomoric sex comedy - and, if that's what
you're in the mood for, line up at the popcorn counter. But it's not
as good as "American Pie" or "There's Something About Mary." And it's
not as funny as "National Lampoon's Animal House" or "Porky's."
Breckin Meyer stars as Josh, who's been in love with Tiffany (Rachel
Blanchard) since they were kids. He's committed to her - except for a
college fling with sexually aggressive Beth (Amy Smart). But his
infidelity was recorded on videotape - and that tape has been
accidentally mailed to Tiffany. Which necessitates a spontaneous,
desperate three-day, 1,800-mile road trip from Ithaca, New York, to
Austin, Texas, to intercept the incriminating sexcapade and save his
romance. He's accompanied by his bumbling best-friend, played by Seann
William Scott, plus pot-smoking Paulo Costanzo and the requisite
nerdy-guy-with-the-car, DK Qualls. So much for plot. MTV comedian Tom
Green serves as the cryptic narrator/tour guide named Barry
Manilow. (That moniker is typical of the lame humor.)
Co-writer/director Todd Phillips wallows in the gross, crude antics as
the four guys in a Taurus experience all the gratuitous nudity
(a.k.a. bare breasts) their testosterone levels can conjure
up. Unfortunately, none of this is very original if you've ever seen a
dumb teenage sex comedy before. It's 91 minutes long - which only
seems like three hours. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Road
Trip" is a trashy, raunchy 3, determined to offend as many people as
possible.</P>
