<P>    An animated tribute to North Carolina's most famous native not
currently crusading against radical homer-sexual agendas, SPACE JAM is
both a surprise and a disappointment.  Who would've thought that such a
commercially crass premise (ninety minutes of Hare Jordan) would yield
such a fun family film?  While the brilliant colors, frenzied
characters, and pulse-pounding soundtrack are a dandy distraction for
the wee ones, Mom and Dad are guaranteed a good time by the many flashes
of adult humor, like a PULP FICTION gag here, a bit of sexual innuendo
there, and all of those gloriously exaggerated (and refreshingly
politically incorrect) speech impediments.  (Watch when Daffy coats the
lens after a particularly moist monologue.)</P>
<P>     Animation fans are also in for a treat, though they're likely to
lament the absence of any discernible edge.  Missing are the Toons' twin
trademarks:  rapid-fire wit and violent physical humor.  Sure, the final
reel breaks loose, but most of the gags (and the animated characters
themselves) are lamer, tamer versions of the originals.  Even a bigger
letdown is how... familiar the whole experience is.  What does SPACE JAM
say about our exposure to celebrities-- and the entertainment industry
as a whole-- when a well-attended, decently- reviewed blockbuster can be
built by simply casting a bunch of basketball stars, cartoon characters,
and one actor (Bill Murray) as themselves?  </P>
