<PRE>'U-Turn'</PRE>
<PRE>A movie review by Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>When director Oliver Stone made his 1994 statement 'Natural Born Killers', it
was to illustrate a point.  Violent criminals were made out to be celebrities
and heroes by not only the tabloid but mainstream media.  That film was
misunderstood by most who felt it nothing more than a free for all of
violence, coarse language and sexually demeaning innuendo when its real
intention was in fact to bring an anti-violence message.  Make no mistake,
there is no misunderstanding Stone's latest film 'U-Turn' as it is simply a
low key re-hash of 'Natural Born Killers' given a soap opera twist, wretched
characters whom we care nothing about and the film is blatantly pointless.</P>
<P>A hustling drifter (Sean Penn) on his way to California is caught up in the
Arizona desert after the radiator hose on his car bursts and he must take it
to the only garage in the area which is in the real life small town of
Superior, about 50 miles east of Phoenix.  He encounters a frightfully shifty
garage mechanic (Billy Bob Thornton) who is the only memorable character in
the film.  Upon leaving his car to be repaired he journeys into an odyssey of
hell where almost every character is evil.  He encounters a sultry young
woman on a street corner (Jennifer Lopez) and helps her with her parcels all
the way home and upon getting close to each other her husband (Nick Nolte)
walks in the assaults Penn who promptly leaves.  Later Nolte encounters him
again and apologizes and asks Penn if he might be interested in killing his
wife and he'll split the insurance money with him.  Penn at first says no but
finds himself in a position where he needs the money and upon seeing Lopez
again she asks him to kill Nolte !  And more money is involved ! !  If this
sounds like 'Double Indemnity' in the wild west, it just might be.</P>
<P>The town's sheriff (Powers Boothe) isn't what he appears to be and the film
reaches a certain point and just goes on and on way to long for the audience
to care anymore about anybody involved.  There are a couple of pointless
scenes which involve Penn encountering
a blind Vietnam veteran who begs for change on the street (Jon Voight) and
his character is insultingly stereotyped.  There is also a goofy spat between
Penn and a jealous redneck (Joaquin Phoenix) who thinks Penn is trying to
move in on his girl.</P>
<P>Oliver Stone has made some of the most shocking, important, socially aware
and truthful films in recent memory and has three Oscars for his filmmakng
efforts in directing and writing.  Since Stone has nothing left to prove and
can choose to make any film he wants to, is it necessary to be so pointless?
 At least Steven Spielberg can make a pointless film like 'Jurassic Park'
which at least contains state of the art special effects but entertains an
audience to the point where they want to come back.  Stone hasn't had a top
notch film since 1991's 'JFK' and six years is a long enough wait.     </P>
