<P>Following in the grand tradition of comedy classics such as Porkys and
Revenge of the Nerds, American Pie arrives in cinemas to relieve the heyday
of the smutty college sex comedy. Even though narrowly avoiding a NC-17
rating with a few cuts, American Pie is still not really raunchy enough to
make it really funny. The story centres around four boys, all virgins, who
make a pact to get laid by prom night. It's proves to be quite a challenge
though, and breasts, laxative and erotic dancing, plus the inevitable apple
pie, all make an appearance.</P>
<P>American Pie has it's fair share of gross out gags: early on there's a scene
involving a glass of beer that may have a few gagging. But in-between these
gross out highlights, the film gets very shaky trying to develop some kind
of plot. The script, by Adam Herz, just isn't strong enough to make these
scenes. Boredom sets in, then, while the audience has to sit through badly
written mushy romantic scenes while waiting for the next set of tits to
appear. Still, the characters are a likeable bunch, if hideously
stereotypical, and there's an hilarious performance by Alyson Hannigan as a
band member with a more sinister agenda. The four leading lads aren't bad,
although one of them is stuck with a girlfriend meaning he can't be as
outrageous as the others. The girls are O.K, although the mechanics of the
script push them to the sidelines and don't make them as exciting or funny
as they should be. One highlight of the cast, however, is 80's comedy God
Eugene Levy turning in a funny performance as Jim's dad. He provides some of
the biggest laughs in the film.</P>
<P>American Pie is also startlingly predictable. Many of the jokes can be
anticipated well before they lumber on the screen. There are also some jokes
that fall flat, and the last twenty minutes occasionally turn very flat.
Although the belly laughs really are belly laughs, the film really needs
more work as a whole, to make the running time go by a bit quicker.</P>
<P>As per standard in college sex flicks, the soundtrack isn't bad, and there's
a good selection of music. The direction is pretty much straightforward, and
doesn't detract from the film. It looks as though censorship has affected
the film, because some of the scenes look a little jumpy, making the cuts
obvious.</P>
<P>American Pie is a odd affair to watch. I knew the gag was funny, but it just
wasn't funny enough. This combined with the fact that the jokes are entirely
predictable make American Pie somewhat of a disappointment. But the cast and
the big set pieces are really rather good, dragging it out of mediocre
territory. American Pie is worth a look.</P>
