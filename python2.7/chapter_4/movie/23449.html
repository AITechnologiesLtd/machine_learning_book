<P>The art of puppetry is commonly associated with children's
entertainment. However, when taken to its heights, it is sublime and
abstract, requiring the puppeteer to be both a dextrous manipulator
and an expressive performer. While acting requires the actor to
communicate mood and emotion through kinesthetic expression, puppetry
demands the same expressiveness while adding the extra dimension of a
separate body, one which is more difficult to control.</P>
<P>This curious film begins with Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), an out of
work puppeteer, looking for gainful employment. He is a master of his
art, but because he is unwilling to debase his talent for commercial
success, he must find some type of menial work to help support himself
and his pet-addicted wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz). Craig happens to find
a position where some of his talents give him an advantage. His
dextrous fingers make him a superior file clerk, and he gets a job
with a mysterious filing company.</P>
<P>>From its outset, it is clear that the film will be unusual and
interesting. The opening scene of real puppetry is haunting and
mesmerizing. Lotte's eclectic menagerie of exotic animals portends an
odd, expressive story. It is not surprising that the director of this
film, which has a strong foundation in vivid imagery, comes from a
background of directing music videos. Although that medium is usually
characterized by insipid depictions of musicians and singers
unconvincingly pretending to be actually performing, a handful of
directors are able to inject real creativity into their craft, and
Spike Jonez is widely recognized as one of them. Among his works are
the Beastie Boys' Paranoid and Weezer's Buddy Holly. Jonez capably
translates his talents to the big screen with this film and produces a
work of stunning originality.</P>
<P>The emergence of more narrative developments fully launch the film to
its "cruising altitude". First, Craig becomes smitten with a sexy,
sassy coworker, Maxine (Catherine Keener), who is a stark contrast to
the dowdy Lotte, and proceeds to pursue her. The second, and more
momentous, development is that Craig accidentally discovers a tunnel
in his office that leads to an alternate reality. It seems that
whoever enters the tunnel becomes temporarily transported within the
mind of contemporary actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). The
participant experiences all of Malkovich's sensations for a short time
before being abruptly dumped beside a New Jersey highway.</P>
<P>The most interesting aspect of the story is that the audience shares
in the experience of "being John Malkovich". That is, the role played
by the actor is that of the actor himself, therefore instead of seeing
the character on screen as a fictitious person (which he surely is),
the impression created is that the John Malkovich of the film is the
real John Malkovich, thus the viewers have the feeling that they are
peering into the everyday existence of the actor, John Malkovich.</P>
<P>The film is not flawless, as some inconsistencies are conveniently
ignored. However, this is dwarfed by all the other rewarding aspects
of the film. The film aspires to tell a story that is many dimensions
deeper than a typical movie, and it is highly effective in doing so.</P>
<P>Highly recommended. This is a film of exceptional imagination and
quirky curiosity. The surreal story is engagingly developed and its
many complexities are interwoven with deft craftsmanship. Director
Spike Jonez scores a breakthrough in his first feature film by
composing a clear vision for this complex and highly entertaining
effort. Viewers who desire a familiar, formulaic effort may find the
film difficult to digest, but anyone who appreciates originality and
creativity will enjoy this film.</P>
