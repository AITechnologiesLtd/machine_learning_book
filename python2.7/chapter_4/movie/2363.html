<P>One-Line-Summary
----------------
    A man, his wife, his daughter, his lover, his memories and his problems.</P>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) is a successful architect with
Sally (Sharon Stone), his wife and business partner of sixteen years,
and a lovely daughter (Jennifer Morrison).  His newfound love, Olivia
Marshak (Lolita Davidovich), fills a void in Vince's life and is more
than he can resist.  He suffers lots of angst as tries to choose
between his family history, or his happiness with Olivia.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts
------------
     Lame Lame Lame.  There doesn't seem to be a point to INTERSECTION,
other than to study Gere's character.  At one point Vince yells at
Olivia, "It's not about you, it's about me!"  How true.  The whole movie
is set up so we can identify with his problems, his emotions, his
turmoil, his everything.  One problem.  I didn't.  Vince is a dweeb.  I
wished he would get it together and stop being indecisive.</P>
<P>     The movie takes place over the span of about a week, with
*frequent* flashbacks where Vince remembers and daydreams.  We see his
happy memories with Sally, his growing dissatisfaction, his meeting
with Olivia, his break with Sally, and his time as ex-husband and
single father.  Of course Vince thinks highly of himself.</P>
<P>     INTERSECTION's one action scene is the car crash featured in all
the commercials.  Because of this, I initially thought the movie might
be something like REGARDING HENRY, with a tragic accident and the
aftermath.  Nope.  Instead, we suffer through lots of Vince's problems
first.  And when the crash finally happens, the filmmakers get pretty
excited about it.  So excited that it is heavily foreshadowed and even
shown twice.  First we get the two-minute slo-mo version where everyone
makes their favorite anguished Sly Stallone faces, and then after the
comment--"I didn't have time to react, it all happened so fast..."--we
get to see exactly how fast two seconds is.</P>
<P>     Sharon Stone once again successfully avoids being sexy.  Unlike in
the stinker SLIVER, I think this time it was intentional.  At one point
Vince remembers (and we see) a "quickie" at a family gathering that is
actually humorously sad.  Poor Vince, no wonder he left.</P>
<P>     I wouldn't have noticed this a year ago, but this movie is just
monstrously *male*.  Everything supports Vincent.  Olivia's stated
goal--"I just want to make your father happy".  The glimpses of Megan
shows she still loves Dad and wants to be with her father, even
inviting him "out to the island" for Easter with Mom.  Sally even tries
to seduce her ex-husband--"what's a girl need to do to get some action
around here", but stops herself, saying "oh, where did that come from?"</P>
<P>     The ending was out of place ...  after everything that happens, we
are left with the distinct impression that everyone, wife AND lover,
still loves Vince, that romantic rascal.  Bah.  I don't believe it.
The heroic strength of "character" at the end is kind of insulting.</P>
<P>Tak Rating system:
------------------
     I didn't like this film.  I won't recommend this film.  I won't
even watch this film again.  There wasn't enough going on to keep my
interest, either emotionally or intellectually.  Maybe some of you will
like INTERSECTION, but I doubt it.</P>
<PRE>  X avoid at all costs
    watch it on cable
    wait for videotape
    see once as a matinee 
    see several times (w/friends) as matinee
    see once at full price
    see it several times - full and/or matinee
    see many times at full price</PRE>
