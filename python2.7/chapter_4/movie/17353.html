<PRE>Rating: * (out of five)  </PRE>
<P>Written by Frank Dietz.  
Directed by Lyndon Chubbuck.  
Starring Pamela Anderson, David Warner, and Dean Stockwell.  
Rated R (contains nudity, sexuality, profanity, and violence)  85 mins.  </P>
<P>Synopsis:  Big-breasted and dim-witted sculptress Britt gets really mad at
her grad student boyfriend because he spends too much time on his
thought-transference experiments instead of her art showings.  Elderly, evil
scientist Everett Longstreet switches minds with Britt's boy, in the
meantime, and goes completely mental.  </P>
<P>Comments:  NAKED SOULS opens with a naked woman, and the movie makes no
illusion that it's a sci-fi vehicle designed to show Pamela Anderson's, um,
talents.  If you are really interested in seeing Anderson's talents,
however, I suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous Pam and
Tommy Lee honeymoon sex tape, now available on home video.  At least with
that "movie," you don't have to go through the painful experience of
watching Pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like "eclectic."  </P>
<P>A premise does exist in the movie.  Basically, while Anderson wears skimpy
clothes which barely contain her talents, she practices her art --
brilliantly slapping plaster of Paris on naked women.  Her boyfriend,
meanwhile, spends 20 hours a day in a morgue trying to view the memories of
dead prison inmates because this will "make a difference to humanity."
Whatever.  The movie fails to explain how these two hooked up.  Be grateful.
After we meet the evil Everett Longstreet, lots of technobabble and mystical
mumbo-jumbo get tossed about, Pammy has sex replete with cheesy make-out
music, and minds get transferred.  Never fear, though, Pammy uses her sharp
mental abilities (ahem) to save her boyfriend in the end.  Unfortunately, no
one saves the movie.  Avoid this would-be sci-fi thriller, unless you're in
for a good laugh or two.  </P>
