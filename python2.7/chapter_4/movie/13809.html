<PRE>BASEKETBALL
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The first film to take advantage of the South Park craze has hit the big
screens.  Starring the creators of Comedy Central's crudely funny
animated show, BASEketball is a hamhanded attempt to merge their brand
of offbeat insult humor with the zany gags that have been a trademark of
director David Zucker.  Surprisingly, the alliance actually works,
creating a movie that, while not for all tastes, has moments of genuine
hilarity.</P>
<P>The new sport baseketball gets its start as the brainchild of two
friends, Coop (Trey Parker), and Remer (Matt Stone). Making up rules on
the spot, the two merge baseball and basketball, removing all sense of
athleticism while adding a heaping dose of trash talking.  The end
result is enjoyed by Coop and Remer and several of their neighbors,
including Kenny "Squeak" Scolari (Dian Bachar).</P>
<P>However, things take off when the wealthy Theodore Denslow (Ernest
Borgnine), enjoying the freshness and innocence of the new sport,
creates a national league.  Within five years, the new sport has become
a national craze, but can it live up to its idealism?</P>
<P>One man, owner Baxter Cain (Robert Vaughn), seeks to spoil the sport.
Will his desire for higher profits lead to the corruption and downfall
of baseketball? And can Theodore Denslow's trophy wife, Yvette (Jenny
McCarthy), be up to any good? At least Coop & Remer's love interest,
Jenna (Yasmine Bleeth), seems to be on the side of goodwill...or is she?</P>
<P>Fans of South Park are obviously the film's intended primary audience,
and said fans are likely to have a blast here.  (Though, the film only
resorts to using South Park voices twice.)  However, if the South Park
brand humor doesn't particularly strike your fancy, BASEketball isn't
likely to convert you.</P>
<P>The film expends most of its gags on its insult humor, applied when the
teams attempt to "psych out" their opponents.  The result is a mixed
bag, with some of the psych-outs being genuinely funny, others landing
with a dull thud.  The film is actually better when it aims its comical
eye elsewhere:  such as at the excesses of pro sports.</P>
<P>The film's plot is a letdown, constructed merely as a loose framework
for gags and jokes.  There's hardly an unanticipated step in the film.
Even in the sporting scenes, you never are made to care who wins or
loses... it's all done for the gags.</P>
<P>Vulgar and gross, the film never rises above low comedy.  But at times,
the low comedy really shines.  It's never as consistent as There's
Something About Mary, and its laughs are rarely as intense, but it does
have its fair share of them.</P>
<P>BASEketball should please it's target audience.  If simply hearing about
this film makes you want to go see it, then this is likely for you.  For
those with second thoughts, this one can easily wait until video.</P>
