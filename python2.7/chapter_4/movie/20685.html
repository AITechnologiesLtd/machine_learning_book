<P>The rivalry between the two was subtle, well paced, and went through
years of the characters lives without leaving the audience feeling
cheated on who they characters were becoming. I left feeling like I
knew a great deal about the people involved - perhaps the ultimate
success of a film biography. As a side note, it's unfortunate that
Griffiths received somewhat of a second billing in the movie. She was
the stronger performer - playing the role that didn't demand the
attention or the eccentricities of Watson's character. Her performance
was vital to the film's success, grounded Hilary and Jackie in
sensibility and as a way for the audience to connect to the
characters.</P>
