<PRE>                     ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: While SHREK, still playing in
          theaters, mocks the old Disney traditions,
          ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE pays respectful homage
          to old Disney films while telling a story like
          H. Rider Haggard on steroids.  A legendary book
          leads a mismatched expedition to find the
          mythical city still alive, though just barely,
          deep beneath the waves of the ocean.  A little
          heavy on the mysticism and the fighting, this
          animated film is not a bad choice adventure
          fans.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     In the late 1800s there was still a lot of the world that was
terra incognita.  Much of the map had still to be filled in and
adventure stories were being written about fabulous finds of ancient
cities still alive in the far corners of the world.  The greatest of
these stories, in my opinion at least, was H. Rider Haggard's SHE,
filmed in multiple silent versions and at least two sound versions.
Other authors who have written lost race stories include Edgar Rice
Burroughs, Ian Cameron, and A. Merritt.  What science fiction is to
many branches of science and alternate history is to the study of
history, lost race stories are to archeology.  They are the stories
of the imaginative dreams of every archeologist.  (For those
interested in the lost race genre I can recommend the web site

<P>     The current film starts at a breakneck pace as a huge wave
rushes foreword to engulf the advanced island-civilization of
Atlantis and some strange flying machines racing it to try to save
the island.  Meanwhile there is something strange and mystical
happening on the island, but not so powerful that it saves the
island from sinking below the waves.</P>
<P>     Flash forward to 1910 or so.  Exploration runs in the family
for Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox).  Thatch's grandfather
searched for the lost city of Atlantis.  Milo has his own ideas as
to where the city can be found.  His dedication and energy applied
to this goal has won him a reputation of being a little demented on
the subject.  Then an enigmatic millionaire has his own plan to find
Atlantis with the help of an ancient book thought to be lost but
found by Milo's grandfather.  A new expedition will search for the
city and its mysterious power source.  The expedition will be led by
Commander Lyle Tiberius Rourke (James Garner) and begin with a
descent to the ocean floor in a fabulous submarine.</P>
<P>     The base story by Bryce and Jackie Zabel leaves room for some
spectacular action scenes with an undeniable excitement.  The film
seems to be an H. Rider Haggard adventure in concentrated form.  The
story moves faster and has more action than Haggard would have given
it, but the spirit is there.  One thing that does seem a little out
of place: most lost race stories were told in a serious tone.
Because of the subject matter the stories were rarely told with much
humor.  There is a lot of Disney-style comedy and weird
international characters on the expedition.  (Is the character of
Moliere based on the character of the same name in the ZBS's Ruby
series?  There are definite similarities.)  The writers make the
usual politically correct choice for the presence and ethnicity of
the villain.  The script in the end feels a little top-heavy with
fighting and mysticism.  Some may long for the subtlety of some of
the writers of years past, but overall the film does have its
moments.</P>
<P>     To some extent ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE is an experiment.
First it is a PG cartoon, unusual for Disney.  The whimsical nature
and the less realistic animation techniques seem less likely choices
for the subject matter.  The style might go better with a humorous
animal story.  Further toward the end of the film a lot of what is
happening is not carefully explained and is left to the viewer's
interpretation.  The film does have some breathtaking images of the
city Atlantis and especially of the great submarine seen all too
briefly in the first part of the film.  The submarine seems like a
cross between Disney's Nautilus and the interior of an airship.
Real submarines don't look like this, but they ought to.</P>
<P>     Once again we have an all-star cast of voices in an animated
film where their familiarity can be only a distraction.  We have
Michael J. Fox in the lead.  We also have James Garner, Jim Verney
(who died in February of 2000), Claudia Christian, Don Novello (who
on frequently played the comedic Father Guido Sarducci), John
Mahoney, and Leonard Nimoy as the King of Atlantis.  While far from
ideal, Atlantis is a good adventure film with at least some of the
nostalgic feel of classic exploration films.  I rate it a 7 on the 0
to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
