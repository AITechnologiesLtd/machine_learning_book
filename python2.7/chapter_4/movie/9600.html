<P>Darkness.  A little shimmer of light from the New Line Cinema credit.
Then darkness again.  Darkness, and more darkness.  Suddenly, breaking
the darkness and the silence is a huge neon sign sporting the title of
the film: BOOGIE NIGHTS.  The 70s music destroys the peaceful silence
when the audience finally shuts up.  The neon sign is vibrant, wild,
and very descriptive of the film we are about to see.  Preparing for a
good time, and not really knowing what to expect, I walked into the
theater for a special engagement of the film.  In fact, it was obvious
most audience members didn't know what to expect.  Overall, I feel
that the film left its mark for life on every single audience member,
in one way or another.</P>
<P>BOOGIE NIGHTS is one of the best films of the year.  Period.  I have
heard all the praising done by critics, but never had I expected this
film.  Opening with probably the best character-introducing scenes
that I have ever seen in all my years of watching films, a smile came
across my face which never left for the first hour of the film.  The
camera pans away from the neon sign and drifts across the street and
into a local club.  We follow the host of this club, Maurice
T. Rodriguez (Luis Guzman), as he seats a couple of people.  This
couple is Jack Horner and Amber Waves (Burt Reynolds and Julianne
Moore).  The camera never cuts throughout this entire sequence,
following one person, and then landing on someone else to introduce us
to.  We follow Rollergirl (Heather Graham) and we finally meet Eddie
Adams (Mark Wahlberg).  This one sequence is so impressive that even I
was marvelling the great camerawork done.  I have never seen a scene
like it before, and if I ever do, it will probably not be as well done
as this one.</P>
<P>Director Paul Thomas Anderson has fully recreated the 70s decade in
vivid and shocking detail.  The colorful clothes and wild hairstyles
are magnificently reproduced.  But despite this, BOOGIE NIGHTS is more
of a character-driven drama.  Deriving its plot from the hardcore porn
films of the late 70s and early 80s, Nights creates an atmospheric
setting in which the adult film actors rise and fall from stardom.
The film centers around Eddie Adams, who changes his name to Dirk
Diggler after venturing into the porn business.  Adams is a busboy at
the club in which the film begins.  Jack Horner, a respected adult
fimmaker (respected in the porn industry anyway), who spots Eddie in
the club.  Later, he asks Eddie if he would like to be a star in one
of his films.  "I got a feeling that behind those jeans is something
wonderful just waiting to get out," remarks Horner.  All of this
happens within the first 15 minutes.</P>
<P>The rest of the film deals with many different characters, but focuses
mainly on Dirk Diggler and Jack Horner.  Amazingly, with all the
characters, all of them are well developed making us care for them and
their situations.  Among them include Little Bill (William H. Macy,
FARGO), Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), and
the Colonel (Robert Ridgely).  Of course, these are just a few of
them.  Many critics complained that the film didn't develop any of the
characters completely.  On the contrary, BOOGIE NIGHTS does develop
every single character, but what screenwriter Anderson does is cut out
all the scenes which supposedly bring the characters out even more.
Many of these scenes are fillers and unnecessary.  Running at around 2
hours and 30 minutes, BOOGIE NIGHTS establishes the characters, shoves
them into the porn industry, and then yanks everything out from under
them.  At its most basic, this film is a simple "Rise and Fall" story.
But what lies beneath this is a world of discovery and surprise.  And
beneath that is a world of love and hope.</P>
<P>More goes on in BOOGIE NIGHTS than in most movies of this genre
(whatever that may be).  It has more subplots than PULP FICTION and
more characters than any film out this year.  Many characters appear
in other films, but BOOGIE NIGHTS actually focuses on the happenings
of all the different people.  Little Bill is disturbed because his
wife (porn star Nina Hartley) keeps committing adultery, and not being
too shy about it.  In one scene, she displays her sexual talent in the
driveway, surrounded by on-lookers.  When Little Bill asks her what
she is doing, she says, "Shut up Bill.  You're embarrassing me."  Reed
Rothchild becomes one of Dirk's best friends, and he also becomes his
sidekick in some of the porn films.  Buck Swope has an entire subplot
devoted to him, beginning with him as a country-loving stereo salesman
to a loving hubsand.  Due to his activity in the porn industry,
however, Swope is prejudiced against in his future business deals.</P>
<P>One of the most inventive and effective techniques used by Anderson is
the change from the 70s to the 80s.  During the 70s, the porn industry
is done on film and shown in theaters.  Jack Horner's dream is to make
movies with actual stories to keep the audience in their seats once
they have achieved their purpose for watching the film.  The change to
the 80s is done in one remarkable scene.  During the New Year's Eve
party, everybody is at Horner's house, and having a good time.  Little
Bill finds his wife with another man, and fet up with her
adulterations, gets a gun from his car.  He walks into the house,
shoots his wife and her partner, walks into the living room with all
the guests, and sticks the gun into his mouth.  The transition from
the disco, fun-loving 70s to the violent, disturbing 80s is very well
executed.</P>
<P>Despite what may sound like a sex-filled drama, BOOGIE NIGHTS cleverly
manages to show us very little.  In fact, what it does show us is done
in such a way that it is more humorous than erotic.  In one scene, the
film expires and they have to change reels.  Horner tells Dirk and
Amber to pause while they reload.  The conversation between Dirk and
Amber at this moment is truly hilarious, and also makes us realize
that sexual pleasure is more like this ("Does it feel good?") than in
other films with sex scenes.  The nudity is more explicit, showing
full frontal nudity of both sexes.  However, Anderson wisely waits
till the very last shot (considered to be the "money shot") to show
the audience Dirk's possession.  Previously, Anderson relies on
actor's expressions to display the impressive size of Dirk Diggler.
In one of my favorite scenes, The Colonel asks to see it, and gets an
awkward grin on his face, replying, "Thank you."  Never leaving the
actor's face during this moment, we are left to imagine... until the
last scene, of course.</P>
<P>The cast of BOOGIE NIGHTS is top-notch and I sense a couple of Oscar
nominations headed towards Burt Reynolds and perhaps even Mark
Wahlberg.  Burt Reynolds does an incredible job, giving one of his
best performances ever.  Instead of overacting (like he did in
STRIPTEASE), he relies on the character's depth and conviction to
propel the character forward.  He remains low-key, but everything
seems to revolve around him.  Mark Wahlberg gives an outstanding
performance, proving to be a better actor than a singer.  His turn in
Fear was quite frightening, but here he establishes a star-making
performance.  Julianne Moore gives one of the best performances in the
film with one of the best characters.  Moore's character becomes
Dirk's surrogate mother when Moore regrets losing her son years ago.
Heather Graham, as Rollergirl, is very good and charming.  Refusing to
take of her skates--which also aid in a very violent scene--Graham
gives the character added depth with a sweet face and an innocent
appearance (which, as we all see, is not entirely true).  William
H. Macy gives yet another good performance, providing a lot of humor
himself.  John C. Reilly gives a good performance in a slightly
underdeveloped character.  Don Cheadle is extremely effective as the
stereo salesman, who provides one of the most complex characters in
the film.  Many other actors appear, and all are very good.</P>
<P>BOOGIE NIGHTS is rated R (and a very hard R it is) for strong sex
scenes with explicit dialogue, nudity, drug use, language, and
violence.  Nearly receiving an NC-17 rating, Anderson cut several
scenes out.  By doing so, he creates an "R rated depiction of XXX
rated movies."  The sex scenes are filmed not by showing the actual
deed, but by showing the filmmaker's reactions.  The language is very
harsh, but it is to be expected.  Be advised that this film is not for
the weak of stomach or heart.  In fact, several people walked out in
disgust during the screening of the film.  Perhaps they were offended
by Anderson trying to put the porn industry into a good light, but
they also missed the downfall of the porn stars, which gave the film
added depth.  BOOGIE NIGHTS is a courageous and daring film which
reminds us how fun watching a movie can really be.</P>
