AND THE BAND PLAYED ON
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Some may argue that movies made for cable television belong
to the limbic world between commercial cinema and commercial
television, which allows their authors to use all their
creative energy without full limitations of those two
industries. On one hand, cable movies are less restrained by
censorship. On the other hand, they are less restrained by
commercial considerations. So, it shouldn't surprise anyone
that some of the best or most impressive pieces of American
cinema in 1990s came from that domain. One of such cases is
AND THE BAND PLAYED ON, 1993 HBO docudrama directed by Roger
Spotiswoode.</P>
<P>The movie is based on the book by Randy Shilts, gay activist
who chronicled first years of AIDS epidemic. The author of
this review had read excerpts from that book many years ago.
Shilts, who died from AIDS himself in 1994, made quite
compelling read, telling the true yet intriguing story about
few unknown heroes - doctors, government officials, gay
activists, scientists - who were trying to cope with new,
frightening disease. Although non-fiction, book was full of
real, vivid characters and dramatic situations, and it
looked like a good screen material .</P>
<P>Among many characters in the movie, chief protagonist is Dr.
Don Francis (played by Matthew Modine), CDC expert for
infectious diseases. At the beginning of the film we see him
still troubled by his traumatic experiences during the Ebola
epidemic in Central Africa 1976. Few years later, his team
is faced with another, less visible, yet equally deadly
medical mystery - young, healthy people, mostly homosexuals
are having their immune system destroyed. While the number
of casualties slowly rises, Francis desperately tries to
find the cause and suspects the unknown virus. In the
meantime, gay activist Bill Kraus (Ian McKellen) tries to
raise awareness about "Gay Related Immune Defficiency", both
in the gay community and among U.S. administration. But the
odds are against him - in 1980 Ronald Reagan becomes
President and new, conservative administration is unlikely
to help gay minority by financing desperately needed
research. Research is even more hampered by the rivalry
between Pasteur Institute in Paris and group of American
scientists led by Dr. Robert Gallo (Alan Alda).</P>
<P>Although faithful to the book, and, as a consequence, almost
two and half hours long, this film never becomes boring.
Spottiswoode keeps the perfect pace, and the editing
provides great drama. But the most important asset of this
film are the actors - many of major Hollywood stars agreed
to appear in cameos. They all work very hard and their roles
are something to be remembered, even when they pop up only
for a second. Even Matthew Modine, who can be rather
irritating in other films, is impressive here as hero.
However, the most impressive role is played by Ian McKellen
as Bill Kraus, the most tragic figure in this sad epic.
Musical score by Carter Burwell helps to set atmosphere and
make this film distinctive from any average television
product with the similar themes.</P>
<P>The movie, although very impressive, could have been better.
The ending, with Elton John's song and long series of shots
featuring most important AIDS victims, seemed somewhat out
of place. The film had already told everything the viewer
had to know, and this remainder at the end looked
over-sentimental and too direct. But, despite that flaw,
this is still very good piece of cinema. The audience
recognised that - in, Croatia, for example, AND THE BAND
PLAYED ON was the only film ever to be released in cinema
theatres after being in video distribution first. So far,
this is the most informative and compelling film ever made
about AIDS, and I hope that one day its reputation would
surpass unjustifiably praised PHILADELPHIA.</P>
