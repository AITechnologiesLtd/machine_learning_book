<P>_Happy_Accidents_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>        While at its core a romantic comedy, Brad Anderson's _Happy_Accidents_
defies conventional categorization, and that's undoubtedly the reason why it's
taken so long to make its way to screens (shot and set in 1999, the film fell
off the radar after premiering at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival).  That very
unconventional quality also what makes the film so well worth seeking out.</P>
<P>        And seeking out is what it'll take to find _Happy_Accidents_, for in
keeping with its low-budget indie roots, the film is appearing only in a handful
of arthouses--a shame, since this is as commercial a romantic comedy as
mainstream Hollywood has put out all year, not to mention an even more
satisfying one.  Marisa Tomei has her first worthy role in years as Ruby Weaver,
a hopelessly romantic single in New York City with an unfortunate knack for
hooking up with guys with problem.  One day at the park she meets Sam Deed
(Vincent D'Onofrio), and not only is the attraction instantaneous, it looks like
he could be the perfect, normal guy she'd always wanted.  Alas, bliss is
short-lived when Sam drops the whopper to end all whoppers: he claims that he is
originally from Dubuque, Iowa... in the year 2470.</P>
<P>        That Ruby's reluctant decision to hang on to Sam is completely
believable owes a lot to D'Onofrio's performance.  He delivers the increasingly
convoluted back story with the right balance of wry humor and earnestness that
keeps the audience continually off-balance as to whether Sam is telling the
truth or downright insane.  D'Onofrio is also so naturally warm a performer that
one cares for the character regardless of his mental state, and he strikes
quirky but no less potent sparks with the ideally cast Tomei, who nails both
Ruby's comic neuroses and genuine, soul-deep romantic yearning.  Unlike
Anderson's previous comic meditation on romantic fate, _Next_Stop_Wonderland_,
one is given convincing reasons why these two could, indeed, be destined to be
together, as Sam often insists.</P>
<P>        That idea of balance is the key to the success of _Happy_Accidents_. 
Anderson strikes the right note in the humor, relying on a subtler, more
natural, situation- and personality-driven comedy than broad, buffoonish
physical gags.  Similarly modulated are the sci-fi touches; Sam's stories of
"the future" are outlandish but follow a certain plausible logic that could very
well account for their truth.  Most impressive about _Happy_Accidents_ is how
Anderson is able to make the two seemingly incompatible genres of sci-fi and
romantic comedy mesh into a seamless whole that remains completely convincing
even at its most disbelief-tempting.</P>
