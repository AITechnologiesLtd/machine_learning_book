<PRE>THE BROTHERS
A film review by Annette Cardwell
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Like many other African-American-targetted flicks like The Best Man and
Waiting to Exhale, The Brothers is best when it's trying to be a comedy
and comes off as fluffy if not sappy and lame when attempting to teach
us more serious lessons about life and love.  But this movie about the
trials and tribulations of four attractive, successful "buppies" will
definitely entertain, and it's sure to rake in the box office cash.</P>
<P>The four "brothers" are commitment-fearing Jackson (Morris Chestnut, who
also starred in The Best Man), woman-hating playboy Brian (Bill
Bellamy), not-so-happily married Derrick (D.L. Hughley) and reformed
womanizer Terry (Shemar Moore).  When Terry decides to get married, his
boys start sizing up their own lives.</P>
<P>Jackson's new girl Denise (Gabrielle Union) seems like "the one," until
he finds out a secret from her past.  Derrick's wife (Tamala Jones)
isn't meeting his -- ahem -- needs.  And Brian is busy fighting off
crazy "sistahs" and venturing into interracial dating, only to find that
all women are -- to him -- just plain crazy anyway.  In the end, they
all have a lot to learn, as all these kinds of movies seem to preach.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, you'll have to endure the film's preaching to enjoy the
truly hilarious dialogue and ad libbing from this talented cast.  While
the script is full of great lines for him to deliver, almost everything
that comes out of Hughley's mouth gets a laugh.  He's especially a riot
in the outtakes shown at the end of the movie, where he invents new
versions of one of the film's already hysterical speeches.</P>
<P>Bellamy and Chestnut are serviceable and sometimes even good in their
roles, but the wooden Moore is clearly just hunky, chiseled, Rick
Fox-wannabe eye candy.  Thankfully for him, this is definitely the type
of movie that calls for a guy like Moore.  It's a picture that's
tailor-made for the ladies -- especially black women -- who will be
swooning over these almost-perfect, hard-working, educated "brothers"
who just need a good woman to make them "wanna be a man."  And, it
doesn't hurt to throw in a few gratuitous shirtless basketball scenes
that could rival the famous volleyball scene from Top Gun.</P>
<P>For anyone who's already a fan of Hughley or the comedy of Chris Rock
and his ilk, or even if you just like ogling a pack of "fine" young
African-American men, The Brothers has a lot to offer.  Don't go looking
for any sage revelations on life, love and happiness.  When this
hit-and-miss script gets up on its pulpit, you may want to walk out on
the sermon.</P>
