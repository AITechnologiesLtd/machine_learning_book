<P>     Once again, Orion Pictures has gone to the shelves to dust off a
print for distribution.  This time, it's the last feature of the late
director Tony Richardson--a muddled melodrama wrapped around a
cautionary tale about the dangers of nuclear fallout.  The 1991 film
shows its age with shots of Chris O'Donnell and Amy Locane looking
significantly less mature than in some of their more recent screen
appearances.</P>
<P>     BLUE SKY is a dreary, disjointed affair that tries to tie together
an anti-nuclear message with a family-in-crisis melodrama.  The most
significant problem is that the script is more dysfunctional than the
Marshall clan.  At no time is there a clear sense that this movie is
going in any particular direction.  It lurches along until stumbling
upon something that passes for a conclusion.</P>
<P>     Set in the early Sixties, BLUE SKY approaches the issue of
underground nuclear testing and fallout as if it was a timely subject
for today.  Had the story been compelling, the approach might have
worked, but this part of the tale--about a United States Army officer
with a conscience (Major Hank Marshall, played by Tommy Lee Jones)--is
heavyhanded, contrived, and cliched.</P>
<P>     The dissection of Marshall's home life is potentially more
interesting.  He has a manic-depressive wife (Jessica Lange) and a pair
of teenage daughters (Amy Locane and Anna Klemp) who long for
stability.  However, a resolutely downbeat tone (not necessarily a bad
thing in itself) coupled with an agonizing example of over-the-top
acting by Lange (reminiscent of the quality of her "work" in 1976's
KING KONG) conspire to ruin these portions of BLUE SKY.</P>
<P>     The ubiquitous Tommy Lee Jones gives a surprisingly bland
performance.  Maybe it's the character, but there isn't much here for
the audience to latch on to or care about.  Powers Boothe, playing a
stereotyped nasty commanding officer with an inflexible mindset, is
lifeless.  Despite being one of several obvious villains, his Vince
Johnson is too dull to actively dislike.</P>
<P>     For those who crave originality, there's very little of value in
BLUE SKY.  This is unfortunate, considering that the film was the final
effort of a respected director.  Since their Chapter 11 filing, it
seems that every time Orion Pictures gropes for something to release,
it comes up with a dud.  (Remember such "classics" as ROBOCOP 3 and
MARRIED TO IT?)  I suppose the library of undistributed movies must be
as bankrupt as the company itself.</P>
