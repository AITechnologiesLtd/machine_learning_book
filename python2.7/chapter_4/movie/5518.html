<P>Suspension of disbeleif is a necessity when watching an action movie.
For an action movie to be entartaining, it has to feature some things
that are implausible. Arnold Schwarzeneggar has been in Hollywood for
for a decade and a half now, mostly in action movies. Many of them were
implausible. Remember Commando? He took out an entire army by himself.
This works in Arnolds favor, because the majority of the viewing public
has come to accept that Arnold can do things in a movie that others
cannot. So when he gets shot in the shoulder and manages to get back up
and fight like nothing is wrong, it is easier for us to suspend our
disbeleif because its Arnold.</P>
<P>Arnold plays an FBI agent who erases people's identities so they can
testify at trials. His latest assignment is Vanessa Williams, who plays
a computer expert that is asked by the FBI to download some secret
information about arms smuggling that could get some big names in
Washington into serious trouble. She completes her task and Arnold is
assigned to erase her identity. Thats when the fun begins.</P>
<P>There are some intersting twists and turns in Erasers plot.  The plot
is much more entertaining than Mission Impossible's, for an example.
And as you come to expect from an Arnold movie, there are some great
stunts and special effects, such as a scene in a zoo with some nasty
and hungry alligators, and a scene where Arnold goes head to head with
a plane. The plane sequence would've been laughable with any other
actor in the role, but its Arnold, so I began to think Arnold should
pick on someone, or something his own size.</P>
<P>While Arnold is doing his action hero best here, he is also surrounded
by a great supporting cast. James Coburn is dignified in the role of
Arnolds boss. Vanessa Williams gives you everything you'd expect from
an action movie heroine, and does it better than most. James Caan is a
terrific villain. Best of all is Robert Pastorelli, someone Arnold
erased so he could testify against the mafia, and who Arniold enlists
to help him out. Pastorelli is a funny and charming sidekick. Direcot
Charles Russell doesnt bring anything new to this movie, but he
definitely has energy. He gives us what we expected, and what we
wanted. If you're a fan of Arnold, or action movies in particular, here
is a movie you will enjoy.</P>
