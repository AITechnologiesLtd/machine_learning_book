<P>BRIDE OF CHUCKY
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *1/2 (out of ****)
Universal / 1:28 / 1998 / R (language, absurdist violence, shadowy doll 
coitus)
Cast: Jennifer Tilly; Katherine Heigl; Nick Stabile; John Ritter; Alexis 
Arquette; Kathy Najimy; voice of Brad Dourif 
Director: Ronny Yu 
Screenplay: Don Mancini<HR>America's favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in "Bride of 
Chucky," and their unholy matrimony is something old, nothing new. The 
burning question on the minds of most moviegoers, however, has nothing 
to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up, but rather 
whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood-soaked 
honeymoon. The answer is a sick-and-twisted yes - and viewers are 
treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubber (or at 
least singe it) lovin'. Guess they're anatomically correct. </P>
<P>Chucky (again voiced by Brad Dourif), of course, is the star of the 
"Child's Play" series, a My Buddy-type doll possessed by the spirit of a 
slain serial killer. In "Bride," the plot (heh) picks up with his 
girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) resurrecting Chucky's remains (he 
was blown up at the end of "Child's Play 3") with the help of a black 
arts manual called "Voodoo for Dummies." Silly mortal. Before long, 
she's also been reduced to shin-high figurine status, and the plastic 
incarnations of these one-time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope 
out some potential new human bodies. </P>
<P>The rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as Tiff and the 
Chuckster stalk a young couple (Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl) with 
conjugal plans of their own, leading them towards a New Jersey grave 
where a magical, soul-transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait. Along 
the way, our murderous Barbie and Ken go through post-marriage motions 
similar to any given pair of newlyweds - bicker, argue, kiss and make 
up. But when they squabble over who's going to do the dishes, watch out. 
Hey, even faux people have got to work through their problems. </P>
<P>Director Ronny Yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene 
or two, but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these 
creepy Kewpies are neither scary nor menacing. When one of them charges, 
it's nothing a good forward punt couldn't take care of. And when a 
climactic chase scene is needed, one of the dim-bulb protagonists must 
_pick_Chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at 
gunpoint. Throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending (will 
"Son of Chucky" be next?) and this is a bizarrely bad 89-minutes at the 
movies. </P>
<P>As is the thing to do in post-"Scream" slasher cinema, Don Mancini's 
screenplay slathers on the in-jokes and genre-parody. But little of the 
humor succeeds, proving self-reference can be completely worthless when 
it lacks bite. To be fair, though, most of "Bride of Chucky" is on 
auto-pilot, so it's not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of 
the film. Similarly shaky, the acting ranges from screeching camp to 
boring bland, the effects aren't that special and the story is one big 
groaner. Here's hoping Chucky and his entire clan - past, present and 
future - rest in peace.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"... Soon the son is bouncing in a hammock with a nubile 12-year-old and 
telling his father, ‘Me like you - love only one female.' I doubt if the 
relationship will last, since the boy is prettier than the girl." -Roger 
Ebert on "Little Indian, Big City"</P>
