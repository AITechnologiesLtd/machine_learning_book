<P>The Brylcream Boys tells the story of two prisoners of war who are
incarcerated in the same prison camp in the Republic of Ireland
during World War Two, and have fallen for the same girl, a local
flame-haired beauty named Mattie Guerin (Jean Butler). There is an
added complication that one of the prisoners is a Canadian airman,
Miles Keogh (Bill Campbell) while the other suitor is a German
officer, Count Rudolph Von Stegenbek (Angus McFadyen).</P>
<P>The film touches upon a little known part of Irish (and World War
II) history. In the outbreak of war in 1939, the Republic of Ireland
was determined to remain neutral. The country had independence (from
Britain) for less than two decades and the leadership of both Ireland
(De Valera) and the UK (Churchill) had been former adversaries in
the battle for independence. The Republic had a small army with
almost no ability to defend itself against attacks from sea or air.
A declaration of support for the Allies would have meant that Allied
(i.e. British) troops would have had to occupy Ireland in order to
defend it against German attack - an prospect which had too much
historical baggage for De Valera to contemplate. Most Irish supported
the Allied cause and many fought in the British and (to a lesser
extent) the US army during the war. De Valera was determined to
preserve the appearance of neutrality throughout the war, even to
the extent of sending the official condolences of the Irish government to 
the German embassy in 1945 on the death of Hitler.</P>
<P>Soldiers from both the Allied and Axis sides (mainly shot-down pilots, and 
some shipwrecked sailors) were imprisoned (in separate compounds) in the 
same military camp outside Dublin - in reality, many of the Allied pilots 
were allowed to return to duty by making their way (largely unhindered) to 
the border with Northern Ireland (only 50 miles away from the camp). 
Security in the camp itself was lax, since it was understood by all that 
breaches of the rules would only make things worse for other prisoners. It 
was also a fact that, if one was fated to be a prisoner-of-war, the camp was 
a pretty good place to sit out the war.</P>
<P>What a pity that the potential for an offbeat exploration of a little
known aspect of WWII is completely wasted by this trite and cliché-ridden 
production. Almost every character in the film is a crudely drawn 
stereotype, from the well-meaning but stupid Irish soldiers guarding the 
camp, to the square-bashing, humourless Germans obsessed with discipline. Of 
course, Count Rudolph is a 'good' German; i.e. he
despises the other Germans in the camp (and by implication, the Nazi
cause). Miles Keogh is a gung-ho pilot who just wants to get back into 
action - he teams up with the British prisoners (absolutely
unconvincing performances, to a man) to plan his escape.</P>
<P>The love interest arrives in the rather fetching shape of Mattie
Guerin, who seems to hold both men in thrall merely by fluttering
her eyelashes (perhaps because she is not capable of much else).
Actually, that is not entirely true - this film was intended to be the 
breakthrough role for Butler. She had already achieved fame as the lead 
dancer (along with Michael Flatley) in Riverdance, a Celtic
music and dance extravaganza. She gets a chance to dance in the
film, too - but the sequence is so ineptly photographed that her
dancing skills don't shine. Since her acting skills are not in
evidence, I foresee a short movie career unless she can become the
Esther Williams of Irish dancing, miraculously weaving dancing
routines into every film. I'm not sure the world is ready for that!</P>
<P>Campbell and McFadyen don't fare much better, though the script is so
bad, I doubt there was much either could do. McFadyen (who played
Robert the Bruce in Braveheart) looks particularly uncomfortable
throughout the film, as if he had realised too late what a turkey
it would turn out to be. However, the worst performance is that of
Gabriel Byrne (also a co-producer) who mugs and grins stupidly
throughout the entire film. He seems to be imitating Barry
Fitzgerald in The Quiet Man in every scene. There is a reason that
movies like The Quiet Man isn't made any more, but at least John
Ford knew how to invest his film with charm and whimsy. The
Brylcream Boys possess neither - one might accept the crude
national stereotypes if the film was at least entertaining. But it
is not, and is simply an insult to filmgoers.</P>
