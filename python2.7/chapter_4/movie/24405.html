<P>   When I was running a speakers' program for my high school
teaching job, I once invited a male ballet dancer from a local
theater.  As soon as the macho students heard of his
profession, they laughed--just like four young barflies in
Nicholas Hytner's new and highly entertaining movie, "Center
Stage."  The dancer, whose name was Mischa, walked on his
toes for several minutes about the raised platform in the
center of the auditorium amid continued titters.  He then
invited three of the class weight lifters to come up and do the
same.  Guess who got the last laugh?</P>
<P>   "Center Stage" takes us into this world of dance, not only
of ballet but also of salsa, modern, jazz, and aerobics.  This
is a thoroughly refreshing movie, most unlike director
Nicholas Hytner's celebrated "The Madness of George III," its
script closer to the second-rate writing of the same director's
"The Object of My Affection."  As we left the theater after a
critics' screening, one colleague stated that Hytner had
"prostituted himself," explaining that the story was banal and
predictable and that "I just can't become interested in a movie
if I don't get into the story."  His attitude is unfortunate.  No
doubt there are moviegoers who demand that their
entertainment be plot-driven, but some of the best films are
character-driven and, in this case, music-and-dance
propelled.  And my, what a splendid diversion is "Center
Stage," a Broadway musical splashed across the big screen
treating its guests to front row seats at a small fraction of the
cost of seeing a live performance at Lincoln Center!  The
characters are types rather than unique individuals: one has
ample talent but an attitude problem; another has bad feet
and the wrong body, but her heart is abundantly large; yet a
third girl is the best, talent-wise, but she is unhappily in the
wrong profession, one which makes her sad and even
desperate.  The principal male is the envy of the entire
company and is appropriately full of himself and a perilous
womanizer.  But who cares if they're stereotypes?  The
bodies on the stage are young, bouncy and attractive, their
spirits are alive in youth's best tradition; and when they dance
they make us feel as though we're at once in the world of
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and of Arthur
Laurents and Leonard Bernstein's "West Side Story."</P>
<P>   "Center Stage" focusses on Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull),
whose name may be a homage to "42nd Street"'s Peggy
Sawyer--a blue-eyed blonde of flawless good looks who is
accepted into a class at the American Ballet Academy at New
York's Lincoln Center because of her face and despite her
"bad feet."  As she pirouettes across the grounds of this most
prestigious of American dance schools, she greets an
assortment of people, actually types: Maureen (Susan May
Pratt) is the academy's finest dancer, a bulimic profoundly
unhappy in a career chosen for her by her frustrated mother,
Nancy (Debra Monk).  Jonathan (Peter Gallagher) and
Juliette (Donna Murphy) are the school's director and chief
instructor respectively while Eva (Zoe Saldana) is the
chip-on-her-shoulder girl whose manner virtually challenges
the director to throw her out.  Though many young eyes are
on the attractive, Seattle-born Charlie (Sascha Radetsky), the
superstar is first- class dancer and choreographer Cooper
(Ethan Stiefel).</P>
<P>   The dance numbers (which are what we came for, not for
Carol Heikkinen's giddy story) are so varied that we don't get
to learn much about the nature of any one genre.  We do find
out from an opening visual on a performer's feet that the
ballet punishes far more than stiletto heels ever could,
causing sores and rashes and bunions that make us wonder
how dancers can last through even their brief ten-year
careers before they become teachers or burger flippers.  </P>
<P>   As Jodie wins the attention and infatuation of Cooper only
to lose heart when Cooper inevitably moves on to his next
conquest, and as Maureen learns through months of
regurgitation that this career is not for her, we get a sense
however spurious of the backstage lives of these young
people--their relationships with one another and with the older
folks who run the school.  What the movie is really about is
Ethan Stiefel's dancing to the George Balanchine-
choreographed Stars andStripes, the two gossamer lovers in
Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet, and especially the
bang-up concluding performance, an original rock creation
complete with motorcycle on stage, performed to the music of
Michael Jackson--which brings the SRO audience at the
American Ballet Theater to its feet.</P>
<P>   The story is no way up to the caliber of Mike Leigh's
"Topsy-Turvy," but the Broadway-style performances are
more vivid than the segments shown in that picture's excerpts
from "The Mikado."  What you come away with is that these
dancers can prance to salsa, aerobics, and jazz as readily as
they pirouette to the stately and soaringly romantic airs of
Tschaikowsky.  Ethan Stiefel is the man to watch, a principal
dancer with the American Ballet Theatre who is perhaps the
present generation's answer to Mikhail Barishnikov.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 2000
