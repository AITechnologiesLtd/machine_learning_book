<PRE>Blade
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2</PRE>
<P>Occasionally I'm in the mood to forget about art, story, characterization and
everything that makes a film worthwhile. During those times, I'm content to
just sit in a dark room watching glitzy pictures flash by on the big white
wall. Fortunately this was my state of mind while viewing "Blade".</P>
<P>Blade (Wesley Snipes) is one tough SOB. Half-vampire, half-human, he has all
the strength and speed of the bloodsuckers and none of their weaknesses to
garlic, sunlight or silver. He's armed with silver stakes, big guns with
silver bullets and a huge sword. Revenge for the death of his mother is his
motivation for turning the world's fiends into dust.</P>
<P>The film's opening scenes follow a woman leading her male friend into a
secret hip disco. (You can tell that it's hip because there are lesbian
couples dancing and a threesome making out on a couch in the corner.)  The man
is digging the techno beat, flashing lights and overt sexuality until blood
starts raining down from the sprinkler system. Then he realizes that he's been
brought to the rave by his vamp paramour as prey.</P>
<P>Enter Blade. Single-handedly he starts wiping out the dancers. One after
another, they are blasted by his shotgun and dissolve into sparkling
ectoplasmic powder.</P>
<P>Later he rescues Karen (N'Bushe Wright), a hematologist who has been bitten.
She is what passes for the love interest in the movie, with the exception of a
subsequent episode that would make Oedipus blush. His only other human contact
is crotchety urban hermit Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who rescued the young
Blade and makes his weapons for him.</P>
<P>Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), the leader of the angry young vampire Turks, is
Blade's nemesis. Turned into an undead by a bite, Frost also opposes the staid
older vampires-from-birth international cartel who meet in a boardroom like
the suits that run IBM. Commenting on their secret negotiations with humans,
he asks why they make deals with their food.</P>
<P>He isn't content to coexist with what he considers lower life forms. He wants
to rule them. The Goth Generation X vampires are like decedent spoiled
children of the rich, dancing and feasting the night away.</P>
<P>Frost has secretly been translating ancient writings that describe how to
summon the Blood God who will bring about the vampire jyhad. Blade finds out
and realizes that this could put a crimp in his plan to destroy the evil
vermin. They eventually meet at an inevitable brutal Hong Kong style showdown
in an enormous underground ancient-future cathedral.</P>
<P>The acting is nothing to write home about, but fitting to the film. Snipes is
as wooden and emotionless as you might expect an obsessive killer to be. Dorff
is snappy as he sneers his lines reminiscent of Keifer Sutherland in <I>Lost
Boys<I>. Rhodes scholar-turned songwriter-turned rock star-turned actor
Kristofferson, a personal favorite, is always entertaining but under-used
here. His eccentric character provides some of the humor especially in a scene
where he slops gasoline around while lighting his cigarette.</P>
<P>Director Stephen Norrington's filmmaking is stylish to the extreme and it
works in this film. Extremely short cuts of vampires snarling and glimpsed
beings scurrying around are like things seen out of the corner of the eye. The
jerky super-speed moments are surprisingly effective.</P>
<P>The sexual aspects of vampirism are used well. There's a lot of licking and
messy wet sliding around. One particularly eroticized incident features the
female victim gasping in ecstasy as her blood is drained away. Her seducer
howls in gratification when he finishes.</P>
<P>The movie has more than its share of faults. Seemingly every object in every
set is made of glass just waiting to be shattered. None of the characters are
real. The underground vampire structure is centuries old and looks cool, but
it just happens to exist in the same US city as the rest of the story? </P>
<P>There are scenes lifted completely from "Raiders Of The Lost Ark" and other
films. The computer effects occasionally look poor and are redundant. Seen one
exploding head, seen 'em all. There's a huge hole in Frost's plan. If everyone
is transformed into vampires, what do they eat? The Blood God is a disappointment.</P>
<P>The biggest disappointment is the climax of Blade and Frost's battle. After
all of the high energy action during the movie, the last minute or so of that
are a letdown. It was so low-key that I kept waiting for more.</P>
<P>There is an interesting subtext of elite groups engaging in war while
regarding the rest of the world as inferiors. The vampires see everyone as
blood machines. Blade regards most other humans as ignorant and beneath his
attention. He savagely beats a vampire-collaborator cop in the middle of a
busy street without the least thought to on-lookers. He's in a secret war zone
and the mundanes don't matter.</P>
<P>His attitude is what terrorists must feel. Their cause is righteous and if
innocents get in the way, too bad. Hidden wars have a long history: the CIA
vs. the KGB, the Tong and Mafia wars, the struggle between criminals and law
enforcement. It's interesting to get an inside look at what goes on around us.</P>
<P>This is a poorly plotted ridiculous film, but it's a well made poorly plotted
ridiculous film. Sometimes on these blistering dog days, that and air
conditioning are enough.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has scrawled these words of wisdom for over 23 years and seems
to have emoved with the paper's name change. Point your electrons to <A HREF="mailto:redman@indepen.com.">redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
