<P>"Mumford" would appear to have a great deal going for it, and it does. An 
extraordinary ensemble cast, resembling that of writer-director Lawrence 
Kasdan's marvelous previous efforts (1983's "The Big Chill," 1991's "Grand 
Canyon"); a director who has proven his filmmaking skills many times before; 
and the fact that it would be primarily character-driven, all gave reason to 
expect that this would be a bright, winning, and intelligent comedy. Little 
by little, as the film played itself out, it became abundantly clear that 
"Mumford" is a prime example of a movie that is played out entirely on the 
surface, with not a thought or idea beneath the characters' exteriors. What 
Kasdan has done here is taken a step way down; where his two aforementioned 
pictures earned points for their knowing human observations and realism, 
"Mumford" is strictly a television sitcom masquerading as a feature film, and 
is instantly forgettable once the end credits begin to roll.</P>
<P>The peculiarly-named psychologist, Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean), showed up in the 
quaint, Mayberry-style town of Mumford only three month ago, and the 
residents are already starting to flock to him, whether they really need 
therapy or not. Sharing a home with self-named cafe owner Lily (Alfre 
Woodard), Mumford has the gift to be able to really listen to what people 
have to say, and more often than not can completely understand and sympathize 
with their problems. Some of his patients include Althea (Mary McDonnell), a 
compulsive shopper who is married to a jerk (Ted Danson) and has two worried 
teenage kids; a pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince) with such low self-esteem 
that he is constantly making up fantasy stories about a large guy with big 
abs; Nessa (Zooey Deschanel), a rebellious, pretty young girl; and a lawyer 
(Martin Short) who talks and talks but doesn't seem to have anything worth 
saying. Seeked out by Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), an appealing, young 
technology genius who also happens to be a billionaire and the creator of the 
Panda Modem, Mumford quickly becomes good friends with him. Later, a possible 
romance flares up when he is won over by the innocent, kind-hearted Sophie 
(Hope Davis), who has come to him for help on curing her of her Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome. At first a little stand-offish, Mumford and Sophie begin to 
spend some time together, and as they become closer and closer, Sophie's 
exhaustion gradually vanishes. </P>
<P>If "Mumford" sounds rather aimless and with very little of an actual plot, 
that's because it is. For 111 minutes, the film is non-stop dialogue, usually 
between two characters at any given time, and while this has the chance to 
work wonderfully (see 1995's charming "Before Sunrise," in which two 
twentysomething strangers get off a train in Vienna and spend the day and 
night together before going their separate ways), "Mumford" is bogged down by 
a paper-thin, artificial screenplay, by Kasdan, that never stops feeling 
"written," and thoroughly mishandles its wide array of characters. The film 
wanders around without any clear destination, and with very few story or 
character developments, and therefore, grows monotonous by the half-way mark. 
It's difficult to dedicate any sort of rooting interest in a group of people 
who, for the most part, are either uninteresting creations or disappointingly 
wasted.</P>
<P>With such a strong cast, one wonders what the principle actors were so 
attracted to with this particular film. On the positive side, there isn't a 
mediocre performance to be had. On the negative side, the characters are 
never given a chance to spring to life, because its potential simply is 
nowhere to be found on the written page. Loren Dean, who appears in almost 
every scene as Mumford, is low-key and remarkably appealing, one of the most 
promising, fresh performances this year. His character of Mumford, however, 
always seems to be standing at arm's length from the audience, and we never 
really get to know him, aside from the obligatory background info that is 
told in an overlong, patience-testing flashback. </P>
<P>Hope Davis, the stunningly versatile actress from such pictures as 1997's 
"The Daytrippers," 1998's "Next Stop Wonderland," and 1999's "Arlington 
Road," is likable as always as the weary, recently-divorced Sophie. Dean and 
Davis work well together and have a lot of chemistry, but each of their 
scenes seem like nothing more than character filler, rather than the natural 
dialogue that one usually speaks. Their eventual romance, unfortunately, 
feels too orchestrated on the screenplay level to set off any fireworks.</P>
<P>Jason Lee (1997's "Chasing Amy"), as Skip, forms a nice rapport with Dean, 
and the friendship that is developed between the two is the film's most 
effective element. Lonely and constantly used by people who only like him for 
his money, Skip chooses Mumford to be his buddy because he knows that he 
wouldn't judge him on a materialistic level, and is overly enthusiastic about 
the technological inventions he is always cooking up. </P>
<P>Also of note is the effervescent Alfre Woodard, an always-engaging and 
criminally underappreciated actress who, coincidentally, had a meatier, more 
satisfying role in Kasdan's powerful "Grand Canyon;" and Zooey Deschanel 
(daughter of famed director of photography, Caleb Deschanel), in her film 
debut, who has a natural charisma and authenticity that is absent from every 
other character in the film. Making no impression in even slighter, 
criminally empty roles are Jane Adams, so astounding in 1998's "Happiness," 
as the town's other psychologist; David Paymer as a resident psychiatrist; 
and Ted Danson, who has all of one scene as McDonnell's husband.</P>
<P>Everything leads up to a courtroom scene that, thankfully, isn't as 
manipulative as it is just-plain contrived. By the conclusion, the majority 
of the central characters have either fallen in love with someone, or have 
become emotionally at ease due to their connection with another, but it is 
distastefully unjustified. Kasdan has chosen to paint his characters with the 
broadest, most general strokes possible, and has forgotten to do one thing: 
develop them. "Mumford" is an intellectually vacant and pointless excursion 
to a town that is almost frightening in its artificiality. In fact, I 
wouldn't have been particularly surprised had "The Brade Bunch" made cameos 
as Mumford's next-door neighbors.</P>
