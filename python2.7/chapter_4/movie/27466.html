<PRE>Antitrust
A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2001 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>* (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The cultural phenomena of the rise to power of the computer geeks over the
past several years has been fascinating to observe. Those loner kids with
skin tones missing any trace of color from sitting in their rooms hunched
over a keyboard are now billionaires and rule the world. In a complete
turn-about, head-hunters are searching high school yearbooks for members of
the Chess Club and the AV Crew.</P>
<P>You would think that Hollywood would recognize the vast audience of young
people in touch with that scene and release films that appealed to them. And
you would be wrong. Instead they give us "Antitrust" which appeals to
teenage girls in touch with how pretty Ryan Phillippe is.</P>
<P>Stealing most of its plot from "The Net" and "The Firm", this film is old
hat. Young computer genius Milo (Phillippe) is seduced by Bill Gates
lookalike Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) away from his buddies and into the
world of corporate code-writing.</P>
<P>In short order, Milo discovers the underbelly of Winston's evil empire and
sets out to put everything right with the world. Not a bad concept, but it
fails on almost every level.</P>
<P>Admittedly it's difficult to make typing seem exciting even on the big
screen, but the opportunities to generate tension are ignored. This is a
prime example of one of the worst film genres: the thrill-less thriller. The
scene where Milo discovers the secret plan is remarkably lifeless.</P>
<P>Maybe I've seen too many films. I found myself annoying my companions by
predicting the rest of the movie during the first 15 minutes and was only
able to stop after repeated beatings. In a story where people are supposedly
not who they appear to be and shocks await around every corner, it's
probably not such a great idea to make everything so obvious. This might
work with the target audience of young girls who may not be acquainted with
the hundreds of films this one copies, but for anyone else, it flops.</P>
<P>The one bright spot is Robbins' portrayal of the amoral software
gazillionaire. Why this multi-talented man is in this movie is a mystery for
the ages, but he does Bill Gates to a T.</P>
<P>Geeks in the audience will be searching in vain for the "Restart" key
minutes after it starts. But there is no hope. Nothing to do except watch
the program crash and burn.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column since before computers became
domesticated and had more fun de-fragging a hard drive than watching this
movie. Email tales of geekdom to <A HREF="mailto:redman@bluemarble.net.">redman@bluemarble.net.</A>)</P>
