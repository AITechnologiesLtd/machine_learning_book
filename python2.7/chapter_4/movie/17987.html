<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Doug Liman's GO is almost the certainly the first film in Columbia
   Pictures' history where its trademark fanfare and torch-bearing
   emblem flickers out to give way to a full-out rave in progress.  It's
   the sort of brazenly confident touch which Liman employs throughout
   the picture, revealing a fearless flashiness previously unseen in his
   breakout debut, SWINGERS.  So frenetic is GO, so aggressively
   energized, it'd be utterly exhausting were it not so exhilirating.</P>
<P>   Wearing its sardonic sense of humour like a badge of honour, the
   snappy screenplay by John August segments the film into three
   interrelated sections running along the same 24-hour timeline and
   careens through them at a breakneck pace.  We meet Ronna (Sarah
   Polley), in desperate need of rent money, who haphazardly engineers a
   drug deal which predictably goes awry.  There's her co-worker Simon
   (Desmond Askew), who embarks on a disasterous misadventure during a
   fling to Las Vegas with friends.  And there's Adam (Scott Wolf) and
   Zack (Jay Mohr), the soap opera actors who instigated the deal with
   Ronna and find themselves stumbling into a strange series of
   quandries.</P>
<P>   The entire film, in fact, is essentially a string of escalating
   situations which comically spin out of control in quirky and
   unexpected ways as its collection of disaffected young characters
   recklessly plow through the night.  While each of the vignettes has a
   slightly different tone -- Adam and Zack's is the most wickedly
   mischievous, while the madcap anarchy in Simon's manic half-hour
   contrasts with the sly deliberation in Ronna's chapter -- they easily
   meld in this lively black comedy where both Liman and his characters
   throw caution to the wind and charge into a pulsating world of
   dangerous chic.</P>
<P>   Despite possessing elements of action and tension, at heart, GO is a
   gleeful comic romp and consequently Liman never takes the mishaps
   which befall the characters seriously -- there are shootings, ODs and
   other assorted misfortunes, and yet the film doesn't let up for a
   moment; it's as if the director feared the picture would stall the
   moment he took his foot off the pedal.  While there's nothing
   especially remarkable about August's topical, consciously hip
   dialogue, the situations in which the characters find themselves are
   often very witty and some of the cute little touches are inspired; the
   unlikely macerena and feline sage are standout moments.</P>
<P>   As good as Liman is in effectively injecting offbeat comedy into
   otherwise grim situations of youthful folly, his confident, kinetic
   visual work is his chief contribution to the picture.  The film's
   urgent pacing is assisted by Liman's bold, appealingly edgy
   cinematography; the handheld camerawork pops with energy that
   complements the rhythmic soundtrack, and Stephen Mirrione's crisp
   editing helps keep GO humming.</P>
<P>   While it's Liman's picture, the young ensemble cast is uniformly
   solid.  I don't think that her performance as resilient would-be drug
   dealer Ronna is vintage Sarah Polley, but it says a lot that she's
   nonetheless wholly arresting.  In his North American debut, Askew is
   great naughty fun, while Taye Diggs as level-headed friend Marcus is
   an unexpectedly strong screen presence.  Katie Holmes, playing Ronna's
   timid friend Claire, makes for an appealing collatoral, while William
   Fichtner makes a strong bid for leftover Christopher Walken roles with
   his memorable turn as the creepy Burke.</P>
<P>   For all of its propulsiveness, GO begins to run out of steam before
   reaching the finish line, but its primary deficiency is its sheer
   narrative unpredictablility; all of the twists and turns in the plot
   basically play out in random fashion.  While this certainly helps to
   keep the audience on its toes and involved to a certain degree, such
   arbitrariness also makes the proceedings feel a bit fleeting and
   shallow.  Although PULP FICTION, to which this picture owes its
   structural resemblence and shared general aesthetic, completely deals
   with redemptive themes, GO really doesn't have any running
   undercurrent -- it's cheerfully, blissfully amoral, and consequently
   lacks any real resonance.  Ultimately, GO is nothing more than a
   thrill ride, but it's a stylish, enjoyable one.</P>
