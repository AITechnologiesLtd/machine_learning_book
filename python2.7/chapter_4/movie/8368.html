<PRE>AIR FORCE ONE (1997)
A film review by Steve Kong
Copyright 1997 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>On the surface Air Force One looks like a formula film, "Die Hard on a
plane." But, as the movie starts, we see that it is different, though not
much, from the formula. </P>
<P>Harrison Ford is the President of the US, James Marshall.  And as the name
somewhat suggest, he is somewhat like a cowboy.</P>
<P>In a team effort between the US and Russia, the leader of rebellious
Kazakhstan is captured. The President is in Moscow giving a speech and
taking a stand against terrorism.  After the speech, the President boards
Air Force One and this is where the fun starts.</P>
<P>The movie opens with the capturing of the Kazakhstan leader.  This sequence
opens the film with a bang, and sets the mood for the rest of the film.
The film is packed with action, and surprisingly, most of it is well done
and takes place on Air Force One.  This is surprising because of the tight
quarters that the surrounds the action.  Some sequences that are of the
wow-factor are the refueling plane, the many gunfights, the C-140 sequence,
and the sequences with the F-15s.</P>
<P>As the plane is being hijacked, the President is put into an escape pod and
ejected.  But this would be too easy of a solution.  The President, with
the motivation to save his wife and daughter, stays on the plane,
unbeknownst to the terrorists.</P>
<P>Gary Oldman plays the terrorist.  He is a hard communist and wants to
reinstate Communism to Russia.  He and a team of men take over Air Force
One and threaten the Vice President (Glenn Close) and Defense Secretary
(Dean Stockwell).  Their threat is that if the leader of Kazakhstan is not
released, then one hostage will be eliminated each half-hour.
The story moves quickly, and the action is spectacular. There are some
minor details that bugged me, but not much.  The terrorists are near blind
and the President has a great shot.  The load of weapons on Air Force One
is incredible and somewhat easily accessible.  And for one minor character
we never do learn his motivation.</P>
<P>Ford, like always, is a joy to watch.  He gives a great performance in Air
Force One.  Oldman does a good job at his part also.  He is as much, and
maybe a little more intense than Ford. Wolfgang Petersen, who directed
Clint Eastwood in The Line of Fire, does a great job of building tension
and creating dazzling action. There is one character, which I won't name,
that is like the wrench in the wheel.  And this character lives almost to
the end of the movie.  All of this time making you wonder what the
character is going to do. I loved how this character was used, although
sparingly, in the film.</P>
<P>Air Force One is a late comer to the summer action movie territory, but it
makes up for this by being one of the most exciting films of this summer.
The action in Air Force One never really goes into the yeah-right category,
but is always in the wow-and-ouch category. Air Force One is a must-see
movie. And when you walk out of the theatre, you too will be saying like
me, "I'm proud to be an American!"
