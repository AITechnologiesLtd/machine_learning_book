<P>Sometimes,in the heat of battle,a soldier gets hit by a bullet but does
not know it right away.In "A Time to Kill" many viewers, who, unlike
professional critics, don't watch it with eagle yes, may realize only
later that the film is full of eyebrow-raising items, manipulations,
weaknesses, inconsistencies and cliches.This is because it is such a
go-go-go, kinetic and suspenseful movie with a weighty theme. But do not
misunderstand me. It is a genuine movie-movie that, warts and all,is
interesting to watch, even thrilling at times.</P>
<P>The first reaction I heard after the film was by a bright, movie-savvy,
liberal (that's a compliment) Mississippian."They got the bad things
that happen much better than the good things."Right.</P>
<P>The bare bones of the story: In Canton, Mississippi,the 10-year old
daughter of construction worker Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) is
raped and almost killed by two sickening white-trash louts. Her father
later shoots them dead while,unfortunately,wounding most seriously a
deputy.</P>
<P>Newish lawyer Jake Brigance(Matthew McConaughey),clientless and in
arrears with all his bills,is a conservative liberal and all around
great fellow. He defends his friend Jackson,even though neither have any
money. The opposition includes venal Judge Noose(Patrick McGoohan)and
D.A. Rufus Buckley(Kevin Spacey),snooty, cold and ambitious for the
governorship.</P>
<P>The town gets polarized between blacks and many of the whites. A dormant
Ku Klux Klan resurfaces in plain sight,goes after our hero-lawyer."Does
he have a family?" asks a Klansman. "Yes? That's good." You can see what
violence is coming,the kind that calls for the National Guard.</P>
<P>There's something so old-fashioned about the movie's style and content
that many filmgoers will think of "Intruder in the Dust" (1949) and "To
Kill a Mockingbird" (1962), both  great, near-flawless movies about
black people accused of crimes in White Power settings. But "A Time to
Kill" is not in their league.</P>
<P>Its time-frame is so nebulous that it is, at first, the new cars that
clue you in that all this is happening in our period--an awkward notion:
the new South may not be a paradise of racial brotherhood (or the rest
of the USA for that matter) but in the film it is seen as a throwback to
the bad old days.</P>
<P>This is mostly because much of the plot revolves around the question:
"Can a black person get justice from a white, local jury?" The answer is
arbitrarily assumed to be "No." When Jake asks for a change of venue, it
is repeatedly rejected by sneaky,tricky,dishonest and whisky-loving
Judge Noose.</P>
<P>Desperate Jake and Carl Lee do find modest funds for the sustenance of
the jailed man's family and for the trial. How this is done--plausibly
or not--is the neatest trick of the week,thought up by an unexpected
person. Many other aspects are clearly manipulative. Take the early
scenes with Jake's wife Carla. She is pretty,she is bra-less under her
tank top,she glistens with perspiration (ladies perspire, men sweat).
All this spells photogenic sex-appeal. </P>
<P>Take the many scenes with Sandra Bullock. She too radiates sex-appeal.
She is a most talented actress who,unlike most other by-the-numbers
stars, has her own personality.It is a universal truth that Ms.B.is the
most likable and appealing new face of the 1990s.Now,except for Jake and
Carl Lee,all other characters have second-banana roles-which is
good.It's nice to see the British model applied to US movies,for
name-performers (like Bullock) to take on lesser roles instead of having
the film build up their parts for reasons of prestige or vanity.</P>
<P>The problem however is that Ms.B.'s part is phony. She plays Ellen, a
wealthy, patrician  Bostonian, a law student at "Old Miss" (The
University of Mississippi),the daughter of a legal eagle,the sexy owner
of a sexy Porsche convertible,the possessor of vast experience in
jurisprudence,of the ability to find legal precedents in a wink,of a
genius mind and many other fantastic (I used the word on purpose)
attributes. She keeps bugging Jake,offering her assistance for free. He
keeps refusing until,predictably,he takes her on. She keeps delivering
the legal goods,even if it means doing an improbable Nancy Drew turn by
impersonating a reporter,then sneaking into an office where she finds
with impossible rapidity files helpful to the Cause. It's suspenseful
but overdone.</P>
<P>Also predictable is the tentative (but mercifully aborted) start of a
romance between Ellen and Jake.This develops after the perspiring
Mrs.Jake gets ticked off at her husband's endangering his family, then,
for safety, goes with her daughter to stay with her parents.I am not
breaking a state secret by revealing that she will return,all love and
contrition. </P>
<P>If all this is not undiluted Hollywood hokum,what is? Yet I do admit
that Ms. B. is a charmer,that by Tinseltown standards her lines are cute
and perfectly in character. </P>
<P>Jake forms a too picturesque volunteer team with Ellen, Harry and
Oliver. Pal Harry (an excellent Oliver Platt) is an Oscar Levant type
(remember him?),a  self-deprecating,boozing youngish lawyer who
painlessly sacrificed his social ideals to the practice of divorce law
that has made him wealthy. Lucien Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland) is an
older man,a colorful alcoholic,a brilliant but
no-longer-allowed-to-practice lawyer. He supplies,it seems to me,more
ethical than legal support.Sutherland plays him with gusto,probably also
relishing the fact that his son Kiefer Sutherland is in the movie as ...
ignominious villain Freddie Cobb.</P>
<P>On the periphery is Jake's middle-aged secretary. She fills a small
function as a kind of Chorus to Jake. Her "I'm a respectable Southern
lady" is played convincingly by,of all people,Brenda Fricker who is
Irish and was Oscared for "My Left Foot."</P>
<P>Samples of additional improbabilities, cliches and in-jokes: 1) Max the
dog survives a fire, which  makes Jake and animal lovers happy; 2) The
overdone discrediting of the prosecution's medical expert followed by
the discrediting of the medical expert for the defense; 3) Sheriff
Walls, who is black and liked by all,enters a redneck bar. The camera
pans his body from bottom to top,as for enforcers in Wild West pictures;
4) Jake's dramatic summation gives us hitherto unmentioned facts
concerning the rape; 5) Judge Noose's name is like a take-off on Wild
West hanging judges,such as Roy Bean; 6) The nasty DA's name is
Buckley,like you-know-who; 7) Carl Lee Hailey's last name is like that
of the writer of "Roots"; 8) Carl Lee's shooting of the rapists is
photographed in cliche slow motion; 9) How did Carl Lee get so quickly
an assault weapon?; 10) Too many habitual or occasional drunks. </P>
<P>Making up somewhat for excesses,movieish pulchritude or ugliness and the
abundance of local color,are some original points: The NAACP's
involvement, more for its glory than to help Carl Lee. The preacher of
Carl Lee's church who is not above an indirect bribe by the NAACP.The
penury of both defendant and his lawyer,something very real yet almost
never treated in films. Non-dragging courtroom scenes.</P>
<P>Production values are tops.The performers are all very good, including
newcomer-in-a-lead role Matthew McConaughey,the object of huge
publicity.  Whether his looks deserve the hype they're getting is not
for me to decide. Samuel L. Jackson is fine too,but he will surely be
outlasted by the memorable,magnificent Juano Hernandez,the proud Lucas
Beauchamp in "Intruder in the Dust."</P>
<P>The city of Canton is in Madison County. The moral brunt of this
overwrought but well-intentioned film is to throw bridges between races,
the bridges of Madison County.</P>
