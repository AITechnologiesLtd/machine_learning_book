<PRE>                           INDEPENDENCE DAY
                              [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Ife Hsu
                        Copyright 1996 Ife Hsu</PRE>
<P>Twentieth Century Fox Release (1996)
Running Time: Approx. 2:20 hr
Starring: Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Robert
Loggia, Margaret Colin..
Director: Roland Emmerich</P>
<P>The idea of alien invasion brings endless plot possibilities.
Just describing the far advanced alien technology that permits
billions of light-year traveling might have filled up an entire
script.  But the makers of Independency Day (ID4) chosed to
focus on the lives of three characters: An US Marine fighter
pilot with aspirations of space-traveling (Will Smith), the
American President dealing with negative poll results (Bill
Pullman), and a MIT grad/expert in complex-system hacking (Jeff
Goldblum). </P>
<P>ID4 covers a three day period (July 2nd thru 4th) observing the
alien arrival, its destructive colonization tactics, and the
world-wide military convergence that fights back the outer space
intruders.  Implausible and repeated coincidences bring the
three main characters together along with the people they care for. </P>
<P>In the first two days, ID4 never looses grip to its grand
entrance. Many faces are introduced and quickly disposed with
minimal care. A single strike was all it took to annihilate New
York, Washington, and Los Angeles. So, as expected, the
counter-measures by the US military force proved meaningless and
ineffective. </P>
<P>But in the final day, Smith, Pullman, and Goldblum are converged
to devise and execute a survival plan for Earth. At this stage,
ID4 loosely introduces a X-File-type government conspiracy and
covert operation. It narrows its premise to focus on this group
while sketches of the aliens and their technology are quickly
shown to satisfy audience's curiosity. </P>
<P>The final strike is again built in total disbelief. World-wide
forces are joined together via primitive communication
mechanism; alien spacecraft can be intuitively piloted; alien's
defensive air force is no longer as agile and efficient; all
other areas in the planet have equivalent fire-power that can
prevail against the invaders.</P>
<P>Clearly, ID4 is not to be taken seriously. It is a feel-good
movie (despite millions of casualties) that is heavily grounded
on special-effects. There is simply not enough time to explain
much, and ID4 does not have the intention to do so anyway.  </P>
