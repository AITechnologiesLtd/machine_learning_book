<PRE>MEET THE FEEBLES (1989)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Peter Jackson
Writers: Peter Jackson, Danny Mulheron, Stephen Sinclair, and Frances Walsh
Starring: Mark Hadlow, Ross Jolly, Brian Sergent, Peter Vere-Jones, Mark
Wright, Donna Akersten, Stuart Devenie</P>
<P>A friend of mine said to me about three minutes into watching Peter
Jackson's "Meet the Feebles" that (I'm paraphrasing) "This is nothing but
an obnoxious, nasty version of the Muppets; everything that's going on is
just being aimed at the lowest common denominator."  To which I relpied
"Yeah...so?"</P>
<P>"Meet the Feebles" is one of the creepiest, most disgusting films I've ever
seen, and also one of the more interesting, to say the least.  As my friend
said in the quote, it's a nasty version of the Muppets, kind of like the
vile behavior.  The film's about a group of living puppets all working on a
one-hour variety show a la the Muppets, but all on their very first show. 
And the film takes place in a short period time before this show, as we are
introduced to every single character on the show, some of which get more
attention than others, and are shown as bluntly as possible.</P>
<P>The film exposes all the melodrama of the backstage of the show, including
several stores going on at the same time, such as one featuring Heide the
Hippo, an overweight actress hired only because she's a star, which is also
the reason she's married to Bletch the Walrus, the show's double-crossing,
asswhole producer, who's carrying on an affair with Samantha the Siamese
Cat, his voluptuous secretary.  Meanwhile, we meet the quiet, lovable
Robert the Hedgehog, the least depraved of the sort, who has fallen in love
with Lucille the Poodle, who has the eyes of Bletch's Peter Lorre-accented
assistant, Trevor the Rat, who shoots S&M films on the side.</P>
<P>You think these characters are bizarre?  Here's a couple more: there's the
show's bitchy director, Sebastian the Fox, who has a musical suprise near
the end; the dim-witted Sid the Elephant, who has accidentally gotten a,
um, chicken pregnant (don't ask me how); Harry the Hare, another star who
has found out that he may have AIDs; Wynard the Frog, the shaky knife
thrower who does morphine every thirty seconds to calm the pain of a past
war where he was held captive and forced to do Russian Roulette (yes,
there's a "Deer Hunter" parody); and a Papparazzi fly who shows up now and
then.</P>
<P>This should basically give you an idea of what the film is like: it IS the
Muppets made afoul.  This is exactly why the film is fun, though.  And I
was wrong about my first impression that it was merely just this. 
Underneat we have a hilariously scatching satire of the line between how we
view celebrities and how they really are.  On stage, Harry the Hare may
seem like a lovable Bugs Bunny rip-off, but what you don't know is that the
minute he leaves the stage, he's off to take on two chick bunnies in his
dimly-lit room.</P>
<P>No, it's not accurate; it's a puppet movie, and it takes everything it can
to the extreme at any moment.  But this is exactly what the film is about
and why the film is fun.  Although barely released in the States, this film
has a cult status, and it's easy to see why.  I can understand why this
film would seem very fun after a couple friends come over and following a
brief downer of some heavy liquor.  It does pander to the lowest
denominator, that's why it's fun.  And because it has some general depth,
it can also hold up when sober.</P>
<P>If there's anything wrong with the film, it's that it's too long.  97
minutes is nothing normally, but when you have puppets talking and doing
shit for that long, it seems like an eternity.  Although several things are
a riot, this film just needs some good editing, especially in the middle
where it drags horrifically, making for a generally uncomfortable
experience.  Although I have to admit I don't know what could be cut.</P>
<P>But that's all made fine by an ending which is so over-the-top, so much a
parody of "Carrie" and "The Wild Bunch" that I suddenly lept to my seat
when it began.  Yes, it's another typical Peter Jackson gorefest, but he
does them so well that I can't see how anyone could complain with a
straight face.</P>
<P>I kept thinking back to what my friend said (who left after five minutes or
so to do something "better"), and how I wished he had stayed until the end.
 Although it's often a big task to watch, the reward for making through it
is a fiercely funny and satirical film which may be foul, disgusting, and
horrific to watch, but at the same time, entertaining, mesmerizing, and
unforgettable, which isn't always a good thing, but here's an exception.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
