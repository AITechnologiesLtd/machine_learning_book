<PRE>KISSING A FOOL
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Doug Ellin wrote and directed Kissing a Fool, a hit-and-miss romantic
comedy, that, although humorous, is hampered by a bad structure and weak
characters.</P>
<P>The story of Kissing a Fool is framed in a flashback, in which a
publisher, Linda (Bonnie Hunt), while hosting a wedding at her house,
relates to two over-eager wedding guests the story of how the bride and
groom got together.</P>
<P>The bride in question is Sam (Mili Avital), an editor who works for
Linda. She's currently editing the novel of Jay (Jason Lee), whose best
friend is Chicago sportscaster Max Abbott (David Schwimmer).  Jay sets
up Sam and Max, and before you know it, the couple is engaged to be
married.</P>
<P>However, the womanizing Max has doubts about the loyalties of his
bride-to-be. He tries to get his pal Jay to seduce her as a test.  If
she bites, Max will call off the wedding...otherwise, he's found the
right girl.  Of course, Jay is reluctant, coming off a bad relationship
with Natasha (Vanessa Angel), but he soon finds himself falling in love
with Sam.</P>
<P>The heart of any romantic comedy is its characters, and Kissing the Fool
runs the gamut from good to not so good.  In the "good" category: Jason
Lee. His is the most developed character in the film, and he handles it
well. To top it off, he's funny, and gets most of the film's good lines.</P>
<P>Mili Avital sits somewhere in the middle of the road.  Her character is
nice, but flavorless.  We never learn that much about her, and she
doesn't express a strong presence that might transcend her mundane
character.</P>
<P>Playing out of type, and without much success, is David Schwimmer.  As
much as he tries, his suave sportscaster is never quite believable. He's
at his best during his "pathetic" moments, or, in other words, when he
seems to be in more familiar territory. It just goes to show that a
change of pace isn't necessarily good.</P>
<P>And then there's Bonnie Hunt.  She barely registers a presence as a
minor character throughout the flashbacks, but when she's the narrator,
you wish she would just go away.  It certainly doesn't help that the
entire awkward flashback structure kills the story (for some reason it
reveals the answers to the film's central questions right at the
beginning). But any time the film begins to gain momentum on its own,
WHAM! We're thrust back to Bonnie Hunt and her over-eager guests, and
everything falls apart.</P>
<P>The story itself is a bit light.  Even without the revealing framework,
you can see exactly where the film is going.  But the film's saving
graces are its humorous moments.  There are some wonderful exchanges
between characters, and plenty of amusingly awkward situations
throughout Kissing a Fool. However, while the humor makes Kissing a Fool
palatable, its many flaws keep it from being completely enjoyable.</P>
