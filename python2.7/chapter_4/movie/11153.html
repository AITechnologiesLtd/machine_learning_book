A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Volker Schlondorff</PRE>
<P>Written by: E. Max Frye (based on the James Hadley Chase novel JUST
ANOTHER SUCKER) </P>
<P>Starring: Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue, Gina Gershon, Chloe Sevigny</P>
<PRE>Ingredients: 
Con artists, patsy, kidnapping scheme</PRE>
<P>Synopsis: 
Two con artists find the perfect patsy in Harry (Woody Harrelson) - - an
inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post, tries
to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye, has ill-timed fits of
coughing, and fails at everything he does. </P>
<P>The story is told from Harry's point of view. Harry always carries
around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink. One day
Harry is approached by the con girl Rhea (Elisabeth Shue), who is
similar to Harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she
doesn't smoke. Seduced, Harry agrees to participate in a money-making
scheme involving faking the kidnapping of Odette (Chloe Sevigny), the
teenage daughter of a rich man. Turns out, it's all part of a needless,
very puzzling, extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme (it involves
hiring special impersonators) by two cons in order to fool Harry, a hero
who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post.  </P>
<P>When the 'kidnapped' Odette is found dead, the clues point to Harry as
the kidnapper/murderer, and the police are hot on Harry's trail. Harry
suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom
money. Can he get out of this mess?</P>
<P>Opinion:
PALMETTO is a long, uninteresting film with all the wrong feel. Hero
Harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently
overestimates his own intelligence. This farcical kind of character
works best in an entertaining NAKED GUN action comedy or DRAGNET spoof.
But PALMETTO is played like a dark, serious, detective noir drama, and
watching Harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating
distraction.</P>
<P>There's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the
camera goes wild on breasts, buttocks, short skirts, colored painted
nails, and women's legs. Even when the focus is supposedly on Harry and
his dilema, you can always notice the side of Elizabeth Shue's breast
forming a prominent foreground. </P>
<P>Towards the end, PALMETTO re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a
confusing explanation involving impersonators, with Woody Harrelson
handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals'
confession. </P>
<P>If you can imagine 'Shemp' from the THREE STOOGES playing the detective
hero of an HBO 'lingerie suspense' thriller, that's how out of synch
this movie feels.</P>
