<P>   The after-movie talk is likely to be not so much about the
quality of "Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane" but about how it
got to be made at all.  While some studios are vying for who
can make the most expensive film, others compete for
bargain-basement figures.  Since this film, written and
directed by Joe Carnahan, got into the can for $7300, it joins
"El Mariachi" in a fight to make the Guinness Book for
flourishing penury.  Consider that Mel Gibson was paid $25
million for his role in "Lethal Weapon 4."  Let's say he takes
off after taxes with $15 million.  Remember: that's for a couple
of months' work!  (It would take me, wow, three YEARS to
earn that sort of bread.)  If Mr. Gibson is not rushed into
"Lethal Weapon 5" but decides instead to become a producer
or director, how many "Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane"'s
could he make?  Two thousand fifty-four.  In every likelihood
two thousand of them would be better than a "Lethal Weapon
5."</P>
<P>   Put it another way.  Joe Carnahan's movie at under eight
large is actually superior to three of Gibson's police dramas. 
Its cast and crew were paid in Doritos and its star performer
reliably comes through on a gallon or so of gas.  A 1963
Pontiac LeMans is the center of attention, a vehicle which
turns out to be worth more than Richard Quine's solid gold
Cadillac.  It's worth so much, in fact, that a guy is willing to
pay two used-car dealers $250,000 just to give the LeMans a
space for forty-eight hours.  What gives this oversized
convertible its value?  You'll have to wait till the end for that,
and you'll be glad you did.  Carnahan's ultimate payoff is 
keenly realized, a remuneration explained in thorough,
philosophic and sentimental terms by its most morally immoral
character.</P>
<P>   The indie film, considered by Village Voice critic Amy
Taubin one of the two most captivating works to come out of
the 19th Independent Feature Film Market, was shot in
thirteen days, though its conception stretched out for half a
year while Mr. Carnahan scraped up needed funds and
equipment.  Filmed in 16mm, transferred to video, and then
relocated again to whatever could give it a grainy, indie feel,
"Blood, Guts" highlights Sid (Carnahan) and Bob (Dan Leis)
as its car's supporting individuals.  They own a used car
dealership about to go under, crushed by the next-door
competition of Danny Woo (Dan Harlan), who has sewed up
the market so tighly that Sid and Bob cannot even get
deliveries of the autos they need.  They get the chance of a
lifetime to reinvent themselves when a thug offers them
$250,000 if they would simply hold on to the LeMans and
leave it in their fallow plot of land for two days.  Though the
more practical Bob is suspicious, he is talked into the deal by
his partner, who would not have cared if forty people were
killed over the lemon--as indeed they were.</P>
<P>   Did somebody say "talked"?  The folks in this accomplished
film could always go into rap if their careers as actors were
curtailed.  Fast talkers all, they keep up such an outpouring of
chatter that their seemingly improvised prattle will distract you
from worrying about a plot hole.  The flawed plotline would
have you consider that in order to get the auto from South
America to its final destination it became necessary over and
over to sell and then to shoot and kill every bargain-hunter
who fronted cash to get behind the driver's seat.  Like
business partners everywhere, Sid and Joe would spend their
time bickering about the small things, seeming to disagree
about every aspect of the business.  Much of the film's fun is
in the robust interchange of ideas between the plump,
overbearing, excitable Sid and his handsome, practical
partner Bob.  </P>
<P>   The actors, who obviously contributed their time, turn in
professional ensemble work.  Ken Rudulph as FBI Agent
Jared embodies the no-nonsense federal cop of the Janeane
Garafolo ("Clay Pigeons") variety, getting comic mileage as
the straight man supervising the uncovering of bloody body
parts in a hotel dumpster.  As Danny Woo, Dan Harlan is the
sentimental hub, a happily married man who will do anything
for his sick, wheelchair-bound wife Dottie (Karla Cave). 
Carnahan provides an assortment of hillbilly oddballs and
nerdish car buyers as well, in this nonlinear narrative about
taking risks and about doing good by doing evil.  The hand-
held camera takes frequent breaks for quick, frequent
flashbacks in color and in black and white as though
Carnahan were gently spoofing film-school antics.  On the
whole, "Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane" shows that with the
right volunteer help and a financial incapacity to shoot the
same scenes over and over, you can evoke enough
spontaneity to capture the full attention of an intelligent
audience.</P>
