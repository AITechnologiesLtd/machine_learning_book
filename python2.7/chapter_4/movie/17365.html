<P>Like most teen dramas or comedies, CRUEL INTENTIONS follows an annoying
pattern of oversimplification. Reality is suspended indefinitely and
imperitively, and all sorts of assumptions are necessary for the movie
to make sense. Although this movie fills its time with a plethora of
edgy sexual situations and dialogue so as to establish its context
firmly in the minds of its adolescent target audience, the latest from
director Roger Kumble is all smoke and mirrors. CRUEL INTENTIONS does
not deliver on any of its promises, and has little to offer other than
an occasionally witty script and some steamy content. </P>
<P>The plot is a bet: step-siblings Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and
Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) are idle and rich (as in the Upper East Side
of Manhattan rich) and without parental supervision over the summer.
Upon news that their exclusive prep school is getting a new headmaster
and more importantly, a new headmaster's daughter, the foundation for
the bet is laid. Then we learn that the daughter in question, Annette
(Reese Witherspoon), is a firm believer in abstinence until true love.
So Kathryn bets Sebastian, a suave young womanizer, that he can't
devirginize Annette; if he succeeds, Sebastian has his way with Kathryn,
the only girl he can't seduce, and if he fails Kathryn gets Sebastian's
classic Jaguar sportster. </P>
<P>There follows 95 minutes of sexcapades among an elite clique of
teenagers in New York City. The movie plays heavily to anticipation,
saturating the script with heavily lustful dialogue and providing
unlimited footage of foreplay. Kudos to a director that can keep a
premise such as this nudity-free, but the lack of skin means this film
was far less erotic than it could have been. Instead, the direction
comes off as inadaquate. </P>
<P>The acting corps *is* adaquate, but that's not much of a complement
considering the limited nature of the roles involved. Sarah Michelle
Gellar, best known from TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," does not play
the temptress to its fullest potential, and often has seemingly mixed
motivations -- ruining the possibilities of the character. Phillippe
does the job of chief romancer well enough, even managing to evoke some
sympathy in the movie's twist of an ending. But he's stoic throughout,
giving little reason to feel anything for him. Witherspoon evokes the
most emotion as the pretty-in-pink heroine, but the role is too overdone
for her to be noteworthy in it. No one has a chance here. </P>
<P>About the only thing that does have a chance is the script, which is
unfailingly witty in a straight-faced sense. Although it's almost
pathetically dumb when it counts, trite insults fly across the screen
with humorous abandon. This allows the audience to achieve some foothold
in the lives of the characters. But by and large CRUEL INTENTIONS is an
ignorant movie, promising things that cannot be delivered and taking
large steps in all the wrong directions. </P>
