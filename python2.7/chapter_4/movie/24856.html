<P>Chandeliers are grand, ornate and thoroughly ridiculous, and sometimes fall 
down on people. Roman Polanski's "The Ninth Gate" is like that -- a 
supernatural thriller and detective movie that begins by playing tricks with 
its genre and ends up playing one on the audience. It deliberately leaves us 
unsatisfied, but is silly and goofy and a whole lot of fun.</P>
<P>Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso, a rare book dealer hired by a strange 
collector (Frank Langella) to track down a book entitled "The Nine Gates of 
the Kingdom of Shadows". Legend has it that its illustrations, when used in 
satanic ritual, can summon up Lucifer himself. Corso, in trying to find it, 
runs into one strange person after another, and we are reminded of such films 
as "The Big Sleep" and "Angel Heart", although "The Ninth Gate" is goofier, 
and the structure and details of the plot make it extremely predictable.</P>
<P>Until, that is, the last act, when the fire-and-brimstone conclusion we've 
been expecting doesn't happen, and there is a confusing final shot that 
leaves us wondering whether Corso has lost power over his soul, sold it, or 
gone to battle.</P>
<P>Polanski, the director, is manipulating us. He knows how to make a serious 
detective movie ("Chinatown"), tale of witchcraft ("Macbeth"), or movie about 
the Devil ("Rosemary's Baby") -- but he's decided to forget about that and 
have a little fun. The early scenes involve us with a subtle, odd sense of 
humour: they undermine the seriousness of the plot by focusing on ridiculous 
images like a light fixture a guy hung himself on; and by letting Depp skulk 
through the movie with an eyebrow raised, as he did in "Sleepy Hollow". Then 
the anti-climactic nature of the ending reveals that Polanski's chuckles 
extend to us, because he's toying with us just as surely as he is with the 
film noir genre. Odd, but not uninteresting.</P>
