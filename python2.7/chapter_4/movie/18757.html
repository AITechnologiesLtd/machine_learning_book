A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Roger Michell</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Richard Curtis</PRE>
<P>Starring: Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Rich and famous actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is walking down the
street when she bumps into William Thacker (Hugh Grant), the chatty,
handsome and humble owner of a tiny London bookstore barely making ends
meet. Of course he accidentally spills a drink on her, and it's love at
first sight. Thacker's underachieving, eccentric friends are thrilled for
him, but can a relationship between glitzy Hollywood royalty and a British
commoner really work out? </P>
<P>Opinion:
We all know the romance formula. Cute meeting. Girl meets boy. Girl loses
boy. Fate draws them together for the big resolution. NOTTING HILL is no
different. The twist is that SHE is a celebrity and HE is a commoner, so
the situation makes for a fantasy relationship that any theatergoer or fan
can identify with. Meanwhile comic relief is provided by an underachieving
roommate. </P>
<P>Julia Roberts does an excellent job playing Anna Scott, an overpaid and
indulged celebrity who admits she has very limited acting ability and that
her "acting" is merely good looks and body doubles. Anna is rotten at
relationships and carries a lot of petty emotional baggage. Roberts is
absolutely believable as the inept Anna. </P>
<P>NOTTING HILL, however, must be considered a chick flick rather than a guy
flick. Women may thrill to a cute guy such as Hugh Grant's William Thacker,
but men are sure to abhor Thacker as someone from the legendary Neville
Chamberlain school of appeasement. Thacker humbly "understands" when Anna
sleeps around with other men. He kowtows and submits and indulges when Anna
throws cheap verbal abuse and directs mean-spirited tirades at him. His
answer to Anna's persistent bullying is, "Can I get you more tea, dear?"
Thacker needs a backbone, and fast. </P>
<P>Male or female, if you continually are disrespected in a real relationship
and don't stick up for yourself the union won't last long. But we can
fantasize in NOTTING HILL, can't we?</P>
