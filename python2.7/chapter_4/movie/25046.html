Running Time: 81 minutes </P>
<P>Five years after a virus has caused the dead to rise and walk the Earth
in search of human flesh, a squad of zombie hunters (known fittingly as
the Zombie Squad) are working to rid the nation of the undead.  While
taking care of some business in Ohio, the Zombie Squad stumbles upon a
religious sect that has other plans for the living corpses.  It's up to
Raimi (Peter Ferry) and the rest of his squad members to figure out what
the cult is attempting to do and stop them before they are allowed to
get away with it. </P>
<P>An incredibly ambitious film directed by a then 19 year old J.R.
Bookwalter and financed by an uncredited Sam Raimi, The Dead Next Door
has an epic feel that it is actually able to pull off (thanks in large
part to the hundreds of extras that agreed to participate and some
kindly folks in Washington that allowed them to shoot on the steps of
the Lincoln Memorial and on the lawn of the White House).  Bookwalter
was able to assemble a large enough cast that the film never seems as if
it is low budget at all.  In fact, only the use of 8mm film (and a
couple of weak performances) gives away the fact that the film's budget
was nowhere near even some of the lowest budgeted independent films.  </P>
<P>Sam Raimi's connection doesn't just end with his production of the
film.  Penultimate cult star Bruce Campbell of Raimi's classic Evil Dead
trilogy does a vocal turn here dubbing over the lines of what sounds
like the character of Raimi (and possibly one other character).  Also,
Evil Dead II co-writer Scott Spiegel makes an appearance as an ill-fated
member of the Zombie Squad early on in the film.  The film Evil Dead
itself gets a tribute early on in the film with several characters
watching the film on TV and hyping some of the more famous sequences to
other characters.  </P>
<P>Note: Several characters are also named after other horror film
directors, most notably the character of Raimi, but there is also a
Commander Carpenter and a Dr. Savini that show up in the film.  For some
reason, only those three directors are used, but there's an interesting
parallel between Jon Killough's character of Vincent and his
more-than-a-passing resemblance to director Tim Burton (the irony being
that Burton's first short film was entitled Vincent).  I don't know if
the reference was intentional, but it is clever nonetheless. </P>
<P>The cast is fleshed out by a number of people who have become regulars
in other Bookwalter directed and produced films.  Barbara Gay has a
cameo as a nurse and went on to appear as Whinnie in Skinned Alive and
makes an appearance in The Sandman (under the name Barbara
Katz-Norrod).  The creator of the zombie virus, Dr. Bow, is played by
Lester Clark, who also appeared in Skinned Alive and had a character
named after him in Polymorph.  Skinned Alive director Jon Killough
appears as the aforementioned Vincent.  Two other cast members, Floyd
Ewing Jr. and Scott Spiegel, also had major roles in Skinned Alive,
fully solidifying the connection to that film.  </P>
<P>Some better than average special effects also lift this film high above
its low budget roots.  Several very inventive puppets complete the image
of severed zombie heads swallowing fingers (with the finger coming out
of the open throat hole), zombies eating rats, and even walking cadavers
displaying levels of decay that an actor in makeup wouldn't be able to. 
Plus, Bookwalter's expertise at editing allows for some effective shots
of people being hit with machetes or ripped to shreds by hordes of
mindless killing machines. </P>
<P>The Dead Next Door is available on VHS from www.tempevideo.com.  The
transfer is overly dark, which makes for a bit more of a distraction
than there should be, but an adjustment of the brightness on your set
should take care of most of the problem.  The video contains a "making
of" segment that details what Bookwalter and his cast and crew went
through to make the film and even contains some interesting commercials
for the release of the original videocassette (one featuring Bookwalter
himself showing what happens if you decide to pirate his film and
another that features Barbara Gay again as an old woman who desperately
wants a copy of the film from her local video store).  There is also a
discussion of the proposed sequel to the film that sounds like a good
idea, especially after viewing The Dead Next Door's surprise ending. A
DVD is set for release this summer and it is proposed that the disc will
contain commentary, the original cast audio track, and a few other
select goodies.  </P>
<P>Well worth checking out, The Dead Next Door is a stellar effort and
worthy of the cult status it has achieved in the fifteen years since its
first release.  I've seen it said about Bookwalter before, but I can
also attest that given a huge budget he could really turn some heads. 
He has a great grasp on editing and direction and is even currently
working on a Full Moon film.  I hope he does get around to a sequel to
his first film ever because I'd be interested to see where he takes the
story from here.  Given the talent he has already displayed I'm sure it
will be something worth talking about. </P>
