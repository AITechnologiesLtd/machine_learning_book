CHILDREN OF HEAVEN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Ali (Mohammad Amir Naji), an Iranian third-grader, is working hard to
come in third place in the big race.  Battling hundreds of other
competitors about his age, he races four kilometers around the lake.  As
he approaches the finish line, he is in danger of overachieving -- only
a third place finish will win the shoes he needs.  Ever since he lost
his sister's shoes, they have been time-sharing his pair of shoes, so he
desperately needs exactly two runners in front of him.</P>
<P>CHILDREN OF HEAVEN (BACHEHA-YE ASEMAN), written and directed by Majid
Majidi, is less a movie than a visual pantomime of a short story.  The
thin narrative and sparse dialog almost dares critics not to like it by
imbuing just about every character with near sainthood.  When we finally
meet the one family we expect to hate, it turns out to be led by a blind
beggar with a heart of gold.  Add in the amateurish acting, and you
would seem to have a recipe for a film that will cause people to smile
politely and try think of kind things to say.</P>
<P>The director does fashion a few nice visuals.  The movie opens with an
intimate close-up of a little girl's shoes being mended.  Another lovely
little image has kids blowing soap bubbles at each other.  Too often,
however, he runs out of ideas and just films the same ugly alleyway,
again and again.</P>
<P>The story's dirt-poor family hasn't paid their rent in 5 months, and
they're overdrawn on their credit with the grocer.  The son, Ali, loses
his first-grade sister Zahra's (Mir Farrokh Hashemian) shoes on the way
back from the shoe repair shop.  The plot revolves around the logistics
of sharing shoes and of obtaining a replacement pair.  Using little
dialog, the film sticks to the visuals to tell the bulk of its story.
The kids spend large amount of their screen time either racing to swap
shoes or waiting for the one with the shoes to return home.</P>
<P>As a change of pace, one day Ali and his father take a beat-up bike and
go looking for work as gardeners in Tehran's wealthy enclaves, where the
rich live in alabaster mansions behind large gated walls.  The movie's
best sequence occurs when the father gets inside the gates and views the
exterior of one of the elaborate homes.  His saucer-sized eyes speak
volumes, as he is dumbstruck by the opulence.</P>
<P>Many obvious questions are never answered.  Why don't their parents ever
realize the shoes are missing?  And, why don't the kids wear their
sandals, which they both have, rather than continue getting in trouble
for being late to school?</P>
<P>The movie does contain one amazing scene.  We actually see the kids
doing homework!  Kids all over America do this everyday -- except in
American movies.</P>
<P>CHILDREN OF HEAVEN runs just 1:28.  The film is in Persian with English
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be a G since nothing even remotely
offensive occurs.  The picture would be fine for all ages, but kids
would probably need to be at least 9 to be interested.</P>
