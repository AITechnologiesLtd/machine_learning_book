<PRE>                               X-MEN
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Very nice to look at but
          startlingly unoriginal, X-MEN is a short feature
          film consisting mostly of borrowings from other
          films.  It is based on the popular graphic novel
          series X-MEN and features two good actors.
          Still the production offers us little we have
          not seen elsewhere.  The film works but rarely
          impresses the viewer.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), +1
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     There is a war going on.  The battlefield is all around us, but
we normal people do not see it being fought.  We will, but not yet.
There are around us mutants with special powers far superior to us
humans.  But the war is not yet between them and us.  Right now it
is between two factions of mutants.  And we humans are just
bystanders whose fate may depend on the outcome of that conflict.
This is the plot of David Cronenberg's 1981 film, SCANNERS.  It was
indeed a very original and atmospheric film.  However that same plot
also describes X-MEN made almost two decades later.  Now it may well
be that SCANNERS could have taken some inspiration from the X-MEN,
but Cronenberg did the in film first.  Even if the Marvel Comics X-
MEN preceded the film SCANNERS, it is an idea that has already been
explored in film and probably more intelligently in a previous film.
Most of anything is good about X-MEN has been done better elsewhere.</P>
<P>     The film opens at an unnamed concentration camp.  A young
Jewish boy is separated by force from his mother.  Trying to follow
her he is restrained by four guards and in his grief somehow causes
two metal gates to bend.  (There are two things wrong with this
scene.  The Jews they show are in a condition too good.  They
probably would not be brought to the camp without already having
been through much rougher treatment than implied.  Also a Jew
causing this much trouble would simply have been shot.)  We see that
the boy, Eric Lehnsherr, obtains his powers from his own mental
anguish and that he has good reason for mistrusting and hating human
nature.  Perhaps understanding this is why Dr.  Xavier (Patrick
Stewart) and he remain lifelong friends.  One would expect them to
be enemies.  Each leads one of two opposed factions of mutants.
This friendship of adversaries is probably the most remarkable and
unexpected twist of the script.  Lehnsherr (now played by Ian
McKellan) leads a faction of militant and ugly mutants, preparing
them for war against humans.  Xavier trains his attractive mutants
to co-exist with the normal humans.  Invited to join the fold are
two new mutants: the nihilistic Logan, known as Wolverine (Hugh
Jackman), and the very confused Marie, called Rogue (Anna Pacquin).
Xavier runs a school for mutants not unlike the one in Brian De
Palma's THE FURY.  The school is complete with a huge spherical
chamber the design for which seems to come from Terry Gilliam's
BRAZIL.  To this school he invites the new mutants Rogue and
creature of rage Wolverine, a creature who likely was inspired by
the animal ferocity of Lawrence Talbot in THE WOLF MAN.</P>
<P>     David Hayter wrote the screenplay based on a story by director
Bryan Singer of THE USUAL SUSPECTS and by Tom DeSanto.  Occasionally
the lines are unintentionally humorous.  The first line of the film
says that mutation has allowed us to evolve from one-celled
creatures to the dominant life form on this planet.  Of course when
there was only one-celled creatures, that WAS the dominant life
form.  Occasionally the writers overstate their point.  At one place
we anti-mutant people hanging "Mr. Mutant" in effigy.  This is a
little heavy handed.  I think discrimination these days would take
more subtle forms after this sort of expression has been so
obviously associated with racism.</P>
<P>     The art direction and set design give this film a nice look
down to detail like X-MAN symbol shows up as the wheels of Xavier's
wheelchair.  They have not given in to satire or levity.  Instead
this is a nice dark story that wants to be taken seriously.
Unfortunately when the fight scenes play fast and loose with
Newton's Laws the feel drops to the level of a bad martial arts
film.  The film has a lot to see, but not much to think about.  It
all builds to a large fight out in the interior of the Statue of
Liberty, perhaps a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.</P>
<P>     That makes it all the more surprising that it attracted the
acting talent that it did.  Patrick Stewart, Formerly of the
Starship Enterprise and currently of the cast of Arthur Miller's
"The Ride Down Mt. Morgan" plays the lead.  Ian McKellen is one of
the finest actors living, but the role of a super-villain in a
costume may stretch his talents.  Anna Paquin of THE PIANO is
reasonable as the troubled Rogue.  Bruce Davison who was touching in
LONGTIME CONPANION and on Broadway as THE ELEPHANT MAN has not much
to do as a United States Senator bigoted against mutants.  This is
hardly one of his better roles.  Famke Janssen who played Xenia
Onatopp in GOLDENEYE is on-hand, apparently as Xavier's assistant.</P>
<PRE>     Stylish but redundant, I give this film a 6 on the 0 to 10
scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</PRE>
