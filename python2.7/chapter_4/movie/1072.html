<PRE>                          THE SHELTERING SKY
                       A film review by Linh Tu
                        Copyright 1991 Linh Tu</PRE>
<P>     Last night I rented the video version of the THE SHELTERING SKY by
Bertolucci.  On purpose, I waited until I finished reading the book
before seeing the movie; and for myself, I can say that I liked it this
way better.  As someone has remarked, the book is hard to follow and to
made sense of and I agree.  The story justs wanders around aimlessly
without any focal point; I admit that it was hard reading the book at
times.  However the movie, with its stunning visual scenes of the
desert, made me understand for the first time, the existential malaise
that the two main characters seem to possess.  If I had not read the
book, I would have had a hard times following the movie; the people just
seem to wander from one place to another for no reason.  For people who
are afflicted with a quest for the "meaning of and to life", like
myself, I would say that both the book and the movie are worth a shot.
Every one will probably see different meanings into the story.  For the
general public, it probably will be boring.</P>
<P>     In the movie version, the author (Peter Bowles) made several 
appearances where he commented on the motives of the main characters.
And at the end of the movie, I guess he kind of lets us know his
understanding of his own desert wanderings.</P>
