Susan Granger's review of "THE BASKET" (North by Northwest Entertainment)</P>
<P> The impact of regional film-making is growing and this
independent "family film" is one of the best to emerge in recent
years.  Working with three friends, film-maker Rich Cowan has created
a character-driven, intriguing tale of opera and basketball, nostalgia
and history, love and war set amid the rolling wheat fields of
Washington State. His company, North by Northwest, raised the $3
million budget for the period drama, set in the rural town of
Waterville in the midst of World War I. The story begins as a
pastor/physician welcomes two German war orphans, 12 year-old Helmut
(Robert Karl Burke) and his 17 year-old sister, Brigitta (Amber
Willenborg), into his home. At the same time, a new school teacher
named Martin Conlon (Peter Coyote) arrives from Boston, bringing with
him phonograph records of an evocative German opera called "The
Basket" about a stranger who saves a town that is threatened by
barbarians at the gates. The plot of the opera obviously parallels the
suspicion, prejudice and intolerance of Waterville's citizens, much to
the dismay of a sympathetic farmer's wife (Karen Allen) who bears her
own wartime tragedy. "Why are you teaching the children a German opera
when we are at war with them?" she asks. Conlon also introduces a
then-new sport called "basketball" with its emphasis on teamwork,
saying: "To defend a mighty wall, each one must fight for something
small." Ultimately, Waterville challenges Spokane's experienced team
for money - which will allow the farmers to buy the new thresher that
they desperately need for harvest season. Despite its slow-pacing, on
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Basket" is a warm, heartfelt,
uplifting 7. It's a gem, one of those rare, thoughtful, beautiful
movies with a feeling of "A River Runs Through It."</P>
