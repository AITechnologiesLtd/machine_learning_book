BLAZING SADDLES
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>There are plenty of reasons why 1970s should be viewed as
the Golden Age of filmmaking. The most obvious of all those
reasons is better quality of movies, at least compared with
present times. That is evident not only in cinema industry
as a whole, but in careers of individual directors. Some
people whose names today are synonymous with mediocre or
downright bad filmmaking actually happened to make very good
films in 1970s, and some of those films are even considered
to be the classics. The best known example of such
phenomenon is the present-day career of Mel Brooks, actor,
screenwriter and director whose comedies in last two decades
were, to say the least, extremely disappointing. The
disappointment is even greater when we compare such letdowns
with the movies Mel Brooks used to make in 1970s. In that
period he created some of the most original and entertaining
comedies in the history of American cinema. One of such
films is BLAZING SADDLES, ultimate western spoof made in
1974.</P>
<P>The plot of the film takes place in the unnamed Western
territory in 1874. Hedley Lamarr (played by Harvey Korman)
is corrupt attorney general in the administration of
incompetent governor William J. Le Petomane (played by Mel
Brooks). Small town of Rock Ridge lies in the path of
encroaching railroad and Lamarr sees that as an opportunity
to make himself wealthy. Bunch of cowboy goons, led by his
trusted lieutenant Taggart (played by Slim Pickens), is sent
to terrorise the town and force citizens to sell all their
land to Lamarr. Instead of fleeing, good folk of Rock Ridge
petition governor to send them a sheriff. Lamarr grants them
their wish in the form designed to offend them - Bart
(played by Cleavon Little), black railroad worker who awaits
execution for striking his racist boss with a shovel. Bart
comes to town, and, naturally, good citizens turn out to be
racist bigots. The only help comes in the form of Jim a.k.a.
The Waco Kid (played by Gene Wilder), town's drunk and
former expert gunslinger that would become his friend and
mentor. Despite everything, Bart manages to do his job and
take care of terrorising cowboys, gradually earning the
respect of the citizens. Frustrated Lamarr uses another
approach and employs femme fatale talents of Lily von
Schtupp (played by Madeline Kahn), bar singer who should
seduce the sheriff. That plan fails when Lily gets seduced
by Bart instead, and Lamarr takes last ditch attempt by
assembling the small army of bandits that would raze the
town to the ground. Bart must use all their ingenuity in
order to save Rock Ridge and gets an absurd, but
nevertheless effective idea how to foil Lamarr's plans.</P>
<P>The screenplay for BLAZING SADDLES was written by five
different people (Brooks, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor,
Norman Steinberg, Alan Uger) and because of that plot gets
weak and quality of humour in the movie is uneven. But, in
general, the film is extremely entertaining, and Brooks as
director keeps the good pace, making this film 93 minutes of
pure fun. Brooks as parody maker has one great advantage
over his colleagues in later decades - this film, despite
sometimes loose plot, is actually very tight in terms of
general theme. And Brooks also shows a great fondness for
the object of his parody - the movie is full of references
to classic westerns and Golden Age Hollywood, references
that couldn't be made by someone who wasn't very familiar
with the period and that type of cinema. Brooks also enjoyed
privilege of having truly superb cast at his helm. Cleavon
Little, his lead actor, was actually replacement for Richard
Pryor, too controversial comedian at the time, but his
performance was great. Others were also great, each creating
memorable characters - Gene Wilder as alcoholic sidekick,
Harvey Korman as pathetic over-the-top villain and, finally,
Madeline Kahn in Marlene Dietrich impersonation almost as
iconic as German actress herself. Brooks also gave his
acting contribution in the role of governor that could be
seen as role model for Clinton. Brooks obviously enjoyed
working in this film (as well as the rest of cast, painfully
trying not to burst into laughter in front of cameras) and
also helped write few memorable songs ("The Ballad of Rock
Ridge", "I'm Tired" and "The French Mistake") together with
John Morris. The general result is short, but effective film
that could be seen thousand times and still make people
laugh.</P>
<P>There is another reason why this film should be appreciated,
and it is probably the same reason why 1970s are viewed as
the Golden Age of filmmaking. Only in that period BLAZING
SADDLES could have been made. Two decades earlier the same
film would be crucified as iconoclastic, subversive,
insulting to the memory of pioneers and opposed to all old
American values and other pillars of society. Two decades
later the same film would be equally unacceptable because of
the way it treats the new sacred cows of Hollywood - Jews,
blacks, Indians, women and homosexuals and all the other
"oppressed minorities". Looser standards of censorship,
together with the lack of "political correctness" enabled
Brooks to turn this film into equal-opportunity satire, in
which anyone might get mercilessly ridiculed. From our point
of view, and especially after experiencing low standards of
Hollywood humour in last two decades, viewing experience of
BLAZING SADDLES is quite refreshing. Huge popularity of this
film, still uncontested after so many years, really
shouldn't be that surprising.</P>
