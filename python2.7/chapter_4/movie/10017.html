<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Given current popular sentiment, it's almost a cliche to depict
   lawyers as the underlings of Satan, but such is the case in Taylor
   Hackford's THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, a delightfully glorious romp that
   begins with a simmer and culminates with a devastatingly impudent
   climax, only to ultimately boil over with a disappointingly
   unsatisfying conclusion.</P>
<P>   The protagonist of THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is young defense attorney
   Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), who seems to have everything going for
   him at the film's opening: a beautiful wife Mary Ann (Charlize
   Theron), and perhaps most importantly from his perspective, a
   thriving and successful practice.  Kevin's courtroom record is
   unblemished, and it doesn't take long to understand why in an
   audaciously funny opening sequence which sees him defending a
   schoolteacher charged with molestation.  As victimized schoolgirl
   Barbara (Heather Matarazzo, perfectly cast as the hapless, awkward
   witness -- I kept waiting for the jury to burst into a spontaneous
   chorus of "Wiener Dog!") recounts her accusation, any question Kevin
   may have of his client's innocence vaporizes when the defendant
   virtually salivates in arousement at her tale.  Nonetheless, Kevin
   puts aside any moral qualms to ruthlessly cross-examine Barbara and
   ultimately win his client's acquittal.</P>
<P>   Kevin's good, but there's only so far he's going to go in
   Gainesville, Florida.  Fortunately, a bigger fish has been keeping a
   watchful eye on his progress, and soon enough Kevin is lured by a
   flatteringly generous offer and lushly exorbitant new Fifth Avenue
   digs to New York, where he joins the powerful firm of Milton,
   Chadwick and Waters.  Falling under the wing of enigmatic senior
   partner John Milton (Al Pacino), Kevin is put on the fast track to
   the top with a series of difficult and intriguing defense cases and
   becomes single-mindedly devoted to his work, oblivious of Mary Ann's
   slow meltdown.</P>
<P>   Although it's not explicitly revealed until the end of THE DEVIL'S
   ADVOCATE, it's quite apparent from the outset (and the promotional
   trailers for the film make no attempts to hide this fact) that Milton
   is the Devil.  Even Milton himself performs little subterfuge to
   disguise his alter-ego, continually emphasizing his demonic qualities
   with his wild-eyed stares and gleeful looks -- I particularly liked
   the scene in the restaurant where he adjusted his dress shirt collar
   up to resemble the traditional devil's cloak.  While in this respect
   THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is fun in its recklessness, I wonder how the
   film would have played out had it been more coy with its
   machinations.  Due not only to the promotion of the film, but of the
   horrific hallucinations undergone by Mary Ann relatively early on,
   there's no real sense of intrigue and no involvement required in
   order to decipher what's occurring in the film; it's simply nothing
   more than a thrill ride.  As the conclusion of THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE
   nears, only Kevin is in the dark with respect to Milton's true
   nature, and his ignorance comes across more as incredulous than
   sympathetic.</P>
<P>   Still, Mr. Pacino makes the devilish role his own, and this is a
   terrific piece of casting for THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.  While a few
   actors come to mind as possessing the sort of look and acting chops
   to portray the Prince of Darkness -- Jack Nicholson, for one, and I
   could certainly envision a demonic Jeremy Irons -- Mr. Pacino is
   perfect in the part because he makes The Devil so much, for lack of a
   better word, fun.  This is the perfect outlet for the scenery-chewing
   which has been plaguing many of his recent performances; here, such
   an over-the-top approach is entertainingly beneficial, as opposed to
   a hindrance.  By the end of the film, I was basking in wicked delight
   at Milton's unrestrained theatrical rants, and blasphemously rooting
   as much for Mr. Pacino's witty Antichrist as I was for Mr. Reeves'
   bland hero.</P>
<P>   Mr. Pacino seems to relish every minute of his role, and delves into
   the part with great enthusiasm.  He's way over the top with his
   now-customary bellowing, grandiose gestures, and plenty of demonic
   grins galore, while Mr. Reeves, despite a Southern accent which
   wavers into every third reel and then abruptly disappears, does some
   of the best work I've ever seen from him.  His physical performance
   severely outclasses his line delivery -- he often recites his
   dialogue with distractingly little conviction -- but he's not a
   liability here.</P>
<P>   Ms. Theron's attempt at a Southern accent is far better (particularly
   considering she's from South Africa), but it's disappointing that
   she's saddled with such a generic and uninteresting role: the
   obligatory wife who cries neglect (although at least in THE
   DEVIL'S ADVOCATE she gets to combine this with the person-in-the-know
   staple).  She often has a startling resemblance to Ashley Judd, which
   is perhaps emphasized all the more in that her performance in the
   film echoes back to some of Ms. Judd's earlier work -- Ms. Theron's
   scene in a church is eerily similar to Ms. Judd in NORMA JEAN &
   MARILYN, while Ms. Theron's portrayal of her character's breakdown
   is brings back memories of Ms. Judd's emotional volatility in John
   McNaughton's NORMAL LIFE.</P>
<P>   Judith Ivey's role, as Kevin's mother, is even more frustratingly
   generic: a bible-thumper whose purpose it is to serve on the polar
   opposite axis to all of the film's demonic aspects.  You dread her
   solemn recitation of some gravely-worded scripture-referenced
   warning, because you know she's ultimately going to be proven
   correct.  Still, as insufferable as her character is, it's worth it
   for a deliciously funny scene where Mrs. Lomax and Milton awkwardly
   share an elevator ride.</P>
<P>   THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE builds up to a wonderful, if excessively
   visually extravagant, conclusion which is deliriously operatic in
   nature and genuine high camp in style.  I was stunned and thrilled by
   the sheer fearless temerity of the film's climax -- no American film
   had delivered such a similarly nihilistic knockout blow which left me
   as thunderstruck since David Fincher's SE7EN -- so I was consequently
   crestfallen that the film badly drops the ball and kicks it away with
   a final coda which can only be classified as condescending and
   absurd.  After teasing at a provocative and daring conclusion, THE
   DEVIL'S ADVOCATE buckles under and provides an epilogue which lacks a
   fraction of the bite.</P>
<P>   Technically, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is terrific to look at: Andrzej
   Bartkowiak's cinematography is superb, and the much-ballyhooed
   production design by Bruno Rubeo is extremely impressive, from the
   spectacular rooftop scene to the inventive design of Milton's office.
   The film is cast remarkably well, although I'd have liked to see
   Delroy Lindo (curiously unbilled as a animal-sacrificing voodoo
   practitioner whom Kevin defends) and Craig T. Nelson (as Alexander
   Cullen, a smarmy real-estate tycoon whom Kevin defends on a murder
   charge) swap roles.</P>
<P>   Mr. Hackford's helming on THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is generally solid,
   although the film's build-up is a bit too long.  There are too many
   scenes which involve Mary Ann complaining about neglect and Kevin
   defending himself, and a sequence where Jeffrey Jones' Eddie Barzoon
   character on the run from Milton is particularly ineffective, given
   that his fate is a foregone conclusion.  Mr. Hackford also goes a bit
   overboard with the use of time-lapse photography to generate an
   ominous atmosphere, showing days and nights on each other's heels as
   storm clouds zip through the sky.  Once or twice is enough, but after
   this technique is reused over and over, I felt like I was watching a
   7th grade science class film, and was hoping that he might insert
   time-lapse footage of a seedling sprouting from the earth and
   blooming into a flower or something of that sort.</P>
<P>   All the same, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is good fun for the most part and
   it's highly amusing to watch Mr. Pacino run rampant in a film which
   provides the proper context for his unbridled theatrics.  There's a
   scene where alluring Christabella (Connie Nielsen) interrupts a
   gleeful Milton rant with an unamused "Shut up.  You talk too much."
   What, and lose the most entertaining element of the film?</P>
