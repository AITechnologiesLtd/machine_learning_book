<P>It was Akira Kurosawa, I think, or perhaps Luis Buñuel, who said that movies 
which tell us everything often have nothing to say. It was one of the great 
directors, anyway, and those guys know what they're talking about. "Up at the 
Villa" feels like it was made to prove the point. If you removed every bit of 
its dialogue that strains to make sure we understand obvious details, the 
film would be half as long. That would be great for the authors, because 
they'd have plenty of free space in which to insert a comprehensible story.</P>
<P>Kristin Scott Thomas stars as Mary Panton, a young English widow staying in 
Florence at the advent of Word War Two. She receives a marriage proposal from 
Sir Edgar Smith (James Fox), a man she does not love, but who could provide 
her with security. This point is emphasised by an American society lady, 
Princess San Fernando (Anne Bancroft), who informs her guests "He has his 
qualities..." while rubbing her fingers together to make clear she's alluding 
to his money.</P>
<P>Of course, EVERY minor point is emphasised in "Up at the Villa". "Surely he 
didn't come all the way here just to dance with you," Princess asks Mary, 
while needlessly adding "He must be wanting to marry you!" We understand what 
the characters are talking about, but the screenplay keeps providing them 
with unnecessary clarifications. My reviews have featured a lot of quotations 
as of late, because sometimes that's the best way to illustrate what a film 
is like. It's absolutely essential here; the dialogue is the key point, 
drawing attention to itself by insulting our intelligence and cluttering 
things up.</P>
<P>There is a love interest for Mary in the movie, a playboy named Roley Flint 
(Sean Penn). He too gets some awkward lines, the most memorable of which are 
spoken at a dinner party. The topic of conversation is electricity shortages. 
"It's because of the munitions factories," says Roley. "They're using up all 
the power." So far, so good. But then: "They're preparing for war. The 
situation in Europe is getting really tense right now. Opposing countries are 
getting ready for armed conflict, and preparing arsenals of weapons."</P>
<P>As the film goes on, Mary finds she needs to turn to Roley for help: After 
she breaks the heart of a young Austrian refugee (Jeremy Davies), the boy 
shoots himself in her bedroom, and Roley is needed to help get rid of the 
corpse. This part of the plot becomes the middle section of the film; it's 
intended, I suppose, to show Mary and Roley getting to know each other. But 
it sidetracks the drama by bogging it down in thriller elements -- the 
characters are closely observed, all right, but as conspirators rather than 
potential lovers. The emotions of the film get confused and lost, and by the 
finale I wasn't sure what had happened. Mary ends up with neither Edgar nor 
Roley, but is this intended as a sad or happy ending, and what made her come 
to her decision?</P>
<P>"Up at the Villa" was written, directed and edited by the husband and wife 
team of Philip and Belinda Haas, who adapted the novella by W. Somerset 
Maugham. It's tempting to say that two people with an intimate psychological 
connection shouldn't work on a film together without some other significant 
creative influence, because they run the risk of making it so personal that 
other people won't understand it. But that's just not true -- think of the 
wonderful movies made by such auteurs as the Coen, Hughes and Marx brothers. 
This is a bland and aimless film. I don't know why and I don't much care.</P>
