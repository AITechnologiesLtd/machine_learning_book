<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>The most notable element of Meet Joe Black is its length.  Director
Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman) has made a long movie.  It's a real
problem when you're trying to make a moving, emotionally sweeping love
story, and the most prominent feature of your film is its three-hour
running time.  This film will challenge the endurance of your buttox; it
will also challenge your attention (audience members with ADD are warned
to stay far away from this picture).  Meet Joe Black is so long that it
makes me wonder if anything was left out:  it just might be the first
film ever to be released without being edited first.</P>
<P>Of course, I'm just joking.  But it is way too long.  As we were
walking out of the theater, my friend commented that it might take
twenty minutes to read the script out loud.  In fact, the characters
don't say very much at all; when they do speak, they speak very slowly,
and employ ten seconds of silence between every sentence.  The pacing in
Meet Joe Black is almost disastrous, especially in the last forty-five
minutes, during which the film ends roughly six times and concludes with
an inexplicable event and an overblown fireworks show.  </P>
<P>And yet, Meet Joe Black is an exceptional picture for the first hour. 
The main character is Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), and aging tycoon
and father of two daughters, Susan (Clair Forlani) and Allison (Marcia
Gay Harden).  One night, he's confronted by Death (in the form of Brad
Pitt).  It's Bill's time to die, but Death would like to see the world
first.  So, Bill takes him to dinner with his family, introducing him as
Joe Black.  Susan, who recognizes Joe as a man she had met in a coffee
shop that morning, is confused by his presence.</P>
<P>Well, the subplots take off from there.  Susan is engaged to a man
named Drew (Jake Weber), an executive of Bill's communications company. 
We all know that he's a cold and boring guy, and that Susan doesn't
really love him.  What isn't necessary is the subplot that involves Drew
trying to get Bill fired (his reason for doing this is that he thinks
Joe is a consultant and that Bill is running the business through him). 
The focus of the story, however, is the love affair between Joe and
Susan, and what Bill does to keep it from happening.</P>
<P>The best thing in Meet Joe Black is Hopkins.  He's such a fine actor,
and brings class and dignity to every role he plays.  As Bill Parrish,
he adds a dimension that might not have been present in the script:  we
care about him, and we care about the relationships he has with his
daughters.  Even when the silly corporate takeover plot swings into full
gear, we care about Bill and the way he deals with his loss.  Meet Joe
Black would have been much less of a film without Hopkins, and since
it's already pretty messy, it's a good thing he's here to help.</P>
<P>But the other actors aren't lost.  Pitt has been widely criticized for
this role, but I enjoyed his work.  When he first appears as death, he
shows superb comic timing -- even his wooden execution of the dialogue
is appropriate.  Clair Forlani is quiet and somber, but so what?  Susan
is a quiet and somber character -- it doesn't make her any less
interesting.  Weber is one of the better slimeballs in recent history,
and backup performances from Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffry Tambor (as
Allison's husband) are both very nice.</P>
<P>Brest is a good director, and makes a few effective artistic choices. 
He's a big fan of the close-up, and it works in this picture -- it makes
the characters more personable.  I always got the feeling that Brest is
passionate about his story; he cares about his characters, and he wants
his film to be moving.  I wasn't always taken with the love story, but
it's effective on some levels -- the love scene, for instance, is
touching.  The first half of the film is also very funny -- the
fish-out-of-water stuff with Death in the real world is great fun.  But,
overall, less would have been more:  there are entire subplots that
could have been taken out (such as the corporate takeover), and this
would have helped the pacing immensely.</P>
<P>By the final hour, you might be wondering if the film will ever end. 
It does end -- in fact, it ends several times.  There are so many
revelations, so many scenes in which people say "good bye" to one
another, so many finales that are supposed to be big and important, that
the film really just seems bloated and unrestrained.  Brest should have
sliced at least an hour off of his movie; as it is, Meet Joe Black is an
interesting movie that starts off funny and ends up self-important.  A
good editing job -- and I mean *really* good -- is all it would have
taken to make Meet Joe Black a swift and wholly effective film.</P>
