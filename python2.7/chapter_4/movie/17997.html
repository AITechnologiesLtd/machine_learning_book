<P>Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation
A review by Joe Chamberlain
Starring Renee Zellweger; Matthew McConaughey; Robert Jacks; Tonie Perensky
& Joe Stevens</P>
<P>There is a rule when it comes to movies. A sequel is never as good as the
original. There are very few exceptions to this rule, and Texas Chainsaw
Massacre: The Next Generation is not one of them. Now if you also take into
consideration that the original Chainsaw Massacre was a REALLY bad movie,
and that this isn't even the first sequel to it, you have a recipe for a
very painful viewing experience. Don't be fooled by the presence of up and
coming talents Matthew McConaughey (A Time To Kill) and Renee Zellweger
(Jerry Maguire). They made this movie before they were stars. Judging by
their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons.
It's a wonder they ever worked in Hollywood again after appearing in this
turkey.</P>
<P>Apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was, because
it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to
capitalize off the success of McConaughey and Zellweger. Apparently the two
young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of
day. And I don't blame them, they would have been better off if this had
been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them. Unfortunately for
them it is a horror film in which Zellweger plays your typically stupid
horror film character. While McConaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical
brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control. (Hey,
don't say I didn't warn you.) To make matters worse, Leatherface, the
chainsaw wielding maniac, who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers
at the best of times, has now become a full blown cross-dresser, and spends
the entire movie in drag. There is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth
mentioning. Let's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the
typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote
control man (McConaughey) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving
half-witted sidekick. Man, I can't get over just how bad this movie is.</P>
<P>This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Even the obligatory topless
babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds. The
writing is bad, the direction is even worse, but both of those things look
good in comparison to the acting. This is the sort of movie that they should
make people in prison watch. A guarantee you, if criminals thought that they
would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again.</P>
