<PRE>POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE
copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P> Just because something makes money doesn't mean that it is good.</P>
<P> This is a hard lesson to learn, especially for Americans, but
fortunately there are always things like POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE to
remind us.</P>
<P> No one at Nintendo thought to wonder if a video game could really
provide sufficient backstory to sustain an entire movie.  Nor has anyone
at Nintendo ever stopped to think about whether children might enjoy
childhood more if they didn't spend it mindlessly repeating nonsense
words like "pikachu" made up in spare moments by Nintendo employees.
Instead, Nintendo saw a chance to make billions of dollars, and moved
forward monolithically with their cynical hypermarketing.</P>
<P>The resulting Pokemon craze is the emptiest craze yet --- a fantasy
world of garbage, without plot, compelling mythology, or point.</P>
<P> Before now, children's literature was dominated by writers like Dr.
Seuss, A. A. Milne, C.S. Lewis, Lloyd Alexander, Disney, etc., who took
seriously the responsibility of creating entertainment that might shape
the thinking of children.  No longer.  The content of POKEMON is
probably harmful to kids in a dozen ways, but to even try to find any
intellectual subtext in the movie at all is pretty iffy, so I will not
waste readers' time with a lot of analysis of how the movie fosters
violence, discourages environmental awareness, and so on.</P>
<P> This is the most cynical movie ever made.  Even the movie's subtitle,
"MEWTWO STRIKES BACK", is cynically derivative --- the filmmakers secure
in the knowledge that the film's target audience doesn't care that there
is already a movie called THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (which was itself an
amalgam of earlier works).</P>
<P> There are no redeeming qualities of POKEMON... and only one serious
question: Should entertainment products be designed solely to please
children too young to understand what is entertaining? In previous
centuries, people thought not.  Is this progress?</P>
<P> For an adult, the only appropriate response to the Pokemon craze is
simply, ostrich-like, to try to pretend it doesn't exist. After writing
this review, I'm going to try to do just that.</P>
