<PRE>_Dogma_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Much has been said about _Dogma_, much of that being negative.  For all
the talk I had heard about the allegedly inflammatory content of the
religious-themed comedy prior to seeing it, what shocked me the most were
those general accusations that writer-director Kevin Smith had committed
a cinematic act of sacrilege.  If you ask me, there is perhaps no other
filmmaker working today who is more serious about his or her faith than
Smith.  After all, is there any other filmmaker who has thanked God in
the closing credits of every single one of his films?</P>
<P>That said, after watching _Dogma_, I can see why people (namely the
Catholic League) have raised some objections.  After all, outrageous
elements such as dialogue passages criticizing the Bible's "bad
storytelling" and a thread where a cardinal starts a ridiculous
"Catholicism Wow" promotional campaign are bound to raise eyebrows--even
moreso when taken out of context, which is what the film's vocal
detractors have done (and how could they not, given the fact that they
haven't seen a frame of the film?).  And context is everything when it
comes to _Dogma_.</P>
<P>_Dogma_ is being billed as "a comic fantasia," and that description
should be taken to its core: it's a comedy; it's a fantasy.  As in it's
supposed to be taken lightly.  And not in a realistic fashion.  As a
hilarious typed pre-film disclaimer notes, this becomes clear within the
film's first ten minutes.  Smith's wacky plot revolves around the
dastardly scheme of two fallen angels, Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby
(Ben Affleck).  They discover a loophole in church dogma that will allow
them to end their eternal exile in Wisconsin and reenter the pearly gates
of Heaven.  The added consequence, however, is that their success would
spell the end of all existence.  With God having been put out of
commission while on a holiday, the fate of the world and all else rests
with efforts of a ragtag bunch: Metatron (Alan Rickman), the angel who
serves as the voice of God; Rufus (Chris Rock), the bitter, heretofore
unknown 13th Apostle; heavenly Muse-turned-stripper Serendipity (Salma
Hayek); a pair of familiar Prophets by the name Jay and Silent Bob (Jason
Mewes and Smith, reprising their recurring roles); and the reluctant key
figure in thwarting the renegade duo, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), an
abortion clinic worker who, after a series of rough life experiences, has
lost her faith.</P>
<P>The last sentence points up _Dogma_'s central flaw: overpopulation.  In
addition to the aforementioned, also encountered along the way is a demon
named Azrael (Jason Lee) and his trio of hockey stick-wielding henchmen;
Cardinal Glick (George Carlin), who institutes the "Catholicism Wow"
campaign; and cameo roles played by familiar faces such as Janeane
Garofalo.  Some characters could have easily been jettisoned, namely
Serendipity; while it's always a pleasure to see Hayek on the silver
screen, her character is pretty much just the token female celestial
being (or, rather, the token celestial being with breasts, for those from
above have no gender).  All the extra bodies also draw valuable time away
from one of the story's more primary concerns, which is Bethany's winding
road to rediscovering her faith; as such, her ultimate enlightenment
doesn't pack the punch that it should.</P>
<P>Much like there are characters that don't quite work, there are also
scenes and gags in _Dogma_ that fall short.  Jay and Silent Bob's big
entrance is a throwback to the over-the-top and largely unfunny comic
book gags in _Mallrats_, and there's one elaborate effects set piece
involving a shit demon (yes,  you read that right) is a complete failure.
 Where _Dogma_ excels, however, is in the area of verbal humor, arguably
Smith's forte.  The most memorable moments are all in the written and
spoken word, and the film has more than its share of great dialogue:
Rufus' rumination on Mary and Joseph's sex life and his angry diatribe
over being left out of the Bible; Loki and Bartleby confronting a
boardroom full of execs on their wide variety of sins; and the general
byplay between Jay and Silent Bob, and that between the pair and Bethany.</P>
<P>Along its lighthearted and offbeat comic path, though, Smith does raise
(and in a fairly seamless manner at that) some serious and not-so-serious
questions about Catholic dogma and organized religion in general.  By
virtue of their definition and the fact that they're in regards to
religion, these questions would understandably upset religious groups. 
But what those objectors fail to see that the questions raised, such as
the dangerous differences between "beliefs" and "ideas," are intelligent
ones that would only spring from the mind of someone who takes his or her
faith seriously.  Smith isn't labeling anyone or anything as being wrong,
rather offering food for thought.</P>
<P>Aside from the uniformly strong work of the ensemble and Smith's wit and
ever-improving way with the camera (check out all the added action in the
background!), that's what makes _Dogma_ a cut above most other comedies:
the audacity to challenge the very audience that comes in for all the
penis and flatulence jokes (and no, they're not in short supply).  A lot
of people will walk out of _Dogma_ thinking back on its many laughs, but
just as many, if not more, will come out reflecting on their own
religious faith--people who, on any other given day, would probably not
give the issue a single thought.  And if that's not an act of piety--as
opposed to one of blasphemy, with which Smith has been so unjustly
charged--then I don't know what is.  (opens November 12)</P>
