<P>   Andrew Fleming has a super concept going for him with
"Dick."  Splashing a revisionist interpretation of one dramatic
incident in U.S. history across the screen, the co-writer and
director of this satire re-writes the Watergate chapter and by
doing so, explains one of the great unsolved mysteries of a
top political scandal:  the source called Deep Throat that
exposed the president's connection to the burglary of the
Democratic party headquarters.  As a stroke of imagination,
the story brings to mind "All the President's Men."  But to a
greater degree think of Ivan Reitman's movie "Dave," in
which the U.S. president is incapacitated by a stroke and the
look-alike title character (played by Kevin Kline) takes his
place, winning over the public, the press and even the First
Lady.  In its farfetched premise, Dave proves that the most
complex national questions all have simple, homespun
answers, and even solves the problem of the national budget
with the advice of his local accountant.</P>
<P>   There's a difference between "Dave," which was 
implausible and yet successfully related, and "Dick," a
likewise improbable yarn, which is not.  "Dave" had superior
actors like the inimitable Kevin Kline and the impressive
veteran of stage and screen, Frank Langella.  "Dick" features
two gifted performers who have come quite a way for their
age, but to my knowledge are both under 21 and have not
matured into convincing thesps.  A more important weakness,
though, is that Fleming overlooks the concept that satire must
be grounded in a recognizably realistic portrayal of
characters, but the director portrays Pulitzer-prize winning
journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as a couple of
awkward kids who clown around with each other in much the
way that the far younger principals of the movie do.  While
Fleming does not make saintly characters of the heroes of
the tale, he paints all with an equally derisive  brush.  Not
only the journalists, but the girls who expose the president's
betrayal of his office, their parents, and even the squeaky-
clean Henry Kissinger are all bimbos, bozos, and assorted
unformed personalities.</P>
<P>   Fleming follows the trajectory of the Watergate Affair with
reasonable fidelity while substituting outrageous deviations. 
When 15-year-old best friends Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle
Williams) and Betsy Jobs (Kirsten Dunst) accidentally happen
upon the burglary of the Democratic Convention office in the
capital's Watergate Hotel, the presidential advisers John
Dean (Jim Breuer), Bob Haldeman (Dave Foley), and G.
Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) think they know too much. 
President Dick Nixon (Dan Hedaya) tries to buy them off by
giving the teenage girls jobs as youth advisers after having
appointed them walkers for his dog, Checkers (Brunswick). 
Haldeman wonders whether the girls are a threat at all, since
he describes them by saying "I've seen more going on
upstairs in a yam."  The young ladies are indeed dense,
knowing virtually nothing about government.  Thoroughly
naive about how things get done in Washington, they think
they can end the Vietnam War by telling Nixon "War is not
healthy for children and other living things."  </P>
<P>   For a while, though, it appears that the White House could
lend them an ear.  In the movie's most amusing scene, the
girls give Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev (Len Doncheff) cookies
they baked, unknowingly adding some pot supplied by
Betsy's spaced-out brother, Larry (Devon Gummersall).  As
the Russian party secretary and the U.S. chief executive
break into "Hello Dolly," a potential nuclear disaster is
averted.  Because Arlene seems to have no life except for
one rich in fantasies, she develops a crush on the president,
dreams of taking him away from his wife Pat, but is later
thoroughly disillusioned upon hearing tapes of the president
cursing and making anti-Semitic remarks.</P>
<P>   Ann Brodie's makeup job helps make all the high
government officials look strikingly like their actual
counterparts.  Saul Rubinek is a ringer for Kissinger, laying
on the heavy German accent, while Dan Hedaya could
almost pass for the dishonored chief.  But the portrayal of
Bob Woodward by Will Ferrell and particularly the depiction of
Woodward's partner on the Washington Post, Carl Bernstein
(by Bruce McCulloch) are grossly silly and unfair.  Watching
the two youthful stars travel through the political arena is at
first not without interest, but Dunst and Williams's one-joke
roles cannot carry the movie's 95 minutes.  The soundtrack,
so applicable to each scene and so dramatic, is a highlight,
especially Carly Simon's song, "You're So Vain."</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 95 minutes.  (C) 1999
