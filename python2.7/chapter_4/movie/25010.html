<P>What do I love most about going to the movies? The surprises! Here I was, a
hater of all films musical, not a fan of the old-school movies, not a fan of
a man they call Shakespeare and definitely not a fan of this movie's lame
ass title, and I walked out of this picture with a shit-eating grin so wide
across my face, you'd think I just hit the motherload. Instead, I was
treated to a fun, joyous, wonderfully orchestrated picture resurrected for
the audiences of today. Will it bring back the genre as GLADIATOR did
earlier this summer? Only time will tell...</P>
<P>PLOT:
The four boys of Navarre have sworn off girls and limited their food and
sleep intakes for a period of three years, in order to concentrate
exclusively on their studies. Unfortunately for the gents, circumstances
soon change when four very lovely ladies come to visit, and cupid, the boys,
the girls, the songs and the dances all take a shot at their hearts.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Wow. A magical recreation of the classic 1930s style musicals, filled with
infectious dances, delightful songs and an overall sense of joy and
merriment all around. What a wonder to see such an original film still being
produced in our day and time. Is there a market for this type of movie? I'm
not sure, but the film put together here by Kenneth Branagh is certainly an
excellent candidate to begin the trend. The movie is able to capture the
pure essence of the classic films from the day, and present it to us within
a bouquet of colorful costumes, authentically decorated settings,
captivating performances from the cast and every fine detail that you would
expect to receive from a master craftsman. In fact, the opening credits
impressed me right off the top, with their classic-style of character
presentation, pictures - actor names - character names, along with the
proper background music and letter font, all of which just seemed to
kickstart the whole show on a sensibly nostalgic tone. Stranger more is the
fact that rarely had I ever sat through any of those "old time" movies
before, since not a one had interested me in the least.</P>
<P>And yet the "feel" of this movie, the "look" of the entire piece, the songs,
the black and white updated news footage from the time, the many groovy
choreographed dance sequences, all seemed to resonate a flawless homage to
the classics, and just won me over, dammit! It's funny because I honestly do
not prefer the word of the Bard to the words of Tarantino, since for one, I
do not understand most of what Shakespeare is saying (mark me an ignoramus,
but at least I'm honest), and two, I'm a child of the 80s...sniff, sniff.
Pity me. Seriously though, my only reservations with this film actually lay
within those areas. Granted, I did love the dances, the songs, the costumes,
the settings, but you know the thin story line actually had to be driven
along by at least some dialogue, and when the dialogue came, well...I just
tuned out. Half of what was being said struck a foreign chord with me, so
getting the gist of their conversations was the best that I could do. I also
couldn't help but notice the Alicia Silverstone factor, which just seemed
out of place, to be sure. Not that she was necessarily bad in her role, but
somehow, she just didn't seem to belong there. But no biggie.</P>
<P>In the end, we accept the fact that these types of films aren't exactly
character studies or created solely on the merit of their story lines. They
are generally based on the spirit of their convictions, the zip of their
songs and the zap of their dances, and by golly, this movie struck gold on
all those counts. Color me impressed, cause God knows I would be the first
to tell you to keep me far and away from any musicals this side of the SOUTH
PARK movie, but listen to I, when I tell thee this...romance, show tunes,
dance, enchantment, moonlight and even a little humor never hurt anybody.
Drop your cynicism off at the door and enjoy.</P>
