<PRE>The Dinner Game ***</PRE>
<PRE>rated PG-13
Lions Gate Films
78 minutes
in French with English subtitles
starring Jacques Villeret, Thierry Lhermitte, Francis Huster, Alexandra
Vandernoot, Daniel Prevost, Catherine Frot
written and directed by Francis Veber</PRE>
<P>The title of Francis Veber's "The Dinner Game" refers to a cruel game
in which a group of men each have to invite an idiot to dinner and
entertain themselves at the idiot's expense. Pierre(Thierry Lhermitte)
has chosen to bring Francois(Jacques Villeret), because he, who spends
his free time making models out of matches, is definitely an
idiot. But as soon as Francois arrives at Pierre's home, Pierre's back
condition worsens and he cannot leave his home. Francois decides to
stay, and he turns Pierre's life upside down, forcing him to lose his
wife, his mistress, his fortune and his mind.  This throwback to the
days of classic screwball comedy was written and directed by Francis
Veber, who wrote "La Cage Aux Folles"; later remade into the inferior
"The Birdcage". A U.S. remake is also on its way for "The Dinner
Game", which is very funny itself. Although I am no fan of farce or
slapstick comedy, the comic timing in "The Dinner Game" is too superb
to be ignored. Entertaining but slight, "The Dinner Game" is a
pleasant art-house diversion.</P>
