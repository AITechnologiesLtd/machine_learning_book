<P>The Sixth Sense is a genuine, unexpected treasure in a summer plagued
with severe disappointments (The Haunting, Deep Blue Sea). It manages to
be creepy, unsettling, heart-felt and emotionally satisfying all at the
same time.</P>
<P>Is there a minimum age required for an Oscar nomination? If not, an
early suggestion would be Haley Joel Osment for his amazing performance
in this film. Osment, from Bogus and Forrest Gump, is the most talented
and credible child actor to grace the good screen in years. His tears of
sadness and despair are so frighteningly real it will give you
goosebumps. The mediocrity of a younger actor's performance often
downplays the overall effect of a film like this, but The Sixth Sense is
definitely not the case.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis, in a welcome change of pace, plays child psychologist
Malcolm Crowe. Crowe has been praised for his efforts for helping the
city's children, and awarded with a framed commendation plaque from the
mayor. On the celebration night, he and his wife (Olivia Williams) are
breaking out the champagne when they discover an intruder has entered
their home. It's a former patient (played by Donnie Wahlberg), who is
blaming Crowe that he was of no help to him during the sessions they had
years ago. Despite attempts to calm him down, the frightened man shoots
the good doctor and then turns the gun on himself.</P>
<P>Skip to `Next Fall', where Crowe is now a shadow of his former self. His
new patient is eight-year old Cole Sear (Osment), a social outcast who
is haunted by something he can't explain. His mother (Toni Collette) is
seriously concerned about the strange bruises and cuts forming on Cole's
wrists and back, but she too is totally unaware of the boy's serious
condition. After a few sessions discussing his parents' divorce, the boy
begins to feel more secure with Dr. Crowe. And so Cole works up the
courage to tell him his secret: `I see dead people,' he says. `Walking
around like regular people.'</P>
<P>The Sixth Sense is not a traditional thriller by any means. Director M.
Night Shyamalan (who directed another film with a spiritual angle called
Wide Awake) has crafted a sensational little drama that will chill your
spine and warm your heart both at once. The emotional maturity that
Shyamalan displays in the second half is wonderful and surprising. There
are frightening moments and shocking images, but the overall emotions
displayed here will have you uplifted while leaving the theater</P>
<P>This is Bruce Willis' best performance.... well, ever. The actor
displays incredible power and realism with his character that comes as
an unexpected fulfillment. The scenes between Willis and young Osment
strike the perfect tone. The lines are perfectly delivered, the emotions
are played perfectly, and their relationship is marvelously realized and
never artificial. Actually, it seems as if the adult actors are given
new opportunities to shine whenever around the extraordinary Osment. The
relationship between Cole and his mother is also touching and
well-balanced, and never altered by any kind of emotional fakery. The
directions The Sixth Sense will take you are unexpected and extremely
effective right until the end (and I do mean the very end).</P>
<P>The Sixth Sense is probably the best movie I've seen all year. It's an
amazing, unparalleled and fulfilling experience. The performances are
virtually flawless, the screenplay is consistently well-written, the
dialogue is totally absorbing, and the direction leaves little margin
for error. The final twist of the film is so clever and unexpected that
you will ponder it for weeks afterward. On closer inspection, it may
contain certain flaws, but it remains the most marvelous and surprising
finale I've seen in years. This is a movie that you simply can't miss.</P>
