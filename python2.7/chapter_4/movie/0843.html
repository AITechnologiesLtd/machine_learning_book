<PRE>                                 HENRY & JUNE
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1990 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Anais Nin's affair with Henry Miller as
     recounted in her diary may well be pretentious enough to have
     pleased her.  This is a film with a lot of sex and very
     little eroticism as Nin demurely and sensitively has sex with
     anyone who will stand still and then describes it in perfumed
     prose in her diaries.  Rating: -1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Take these comments with a grain of salt.  Films about people's sex and
love lives somehow just do not appeal to me, even from excellent filmmakers
such as Woody Allen or Philip Kaufman.  I rate them much lower than other
people seem to.  Not that sex itself cannot be interesting, but even a Woody
Allen agonizing over why he cannot bed Diane Keaton is for me the formula
for a total yawner.  Philip Kaufman's last film, THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF
BEING, while much in this genre, did have enough substance besides the
sexual maneuvering that it held my interest.  His current HENRY AND JUNE is
a long film, but not nearly as long as it seems.  In spite of the title, the
film is mostly about Anais Nin and her early 1930s affair with Henry Miller.
The film is based on the account in her memoir of the same title.  She makes
herself out to be small and in some ways strong, but in most ways she is
fragile.  She is not entirely satisfied by her banker husband Hugo and is
attracted to virile American writer Henry Miller.  Awakened by his presence,
she proceeds in her frail, sensitive way to have sex with everyone in reach
but the housemaid and perhaps the dog (though the dog wasn't talking).  She
also has a stimulating intellectual relationship with Miller, who is
straight-laced enough to limit his sexual partners to only the members of
the opposite sex within reach.  When one of them is not making love, he or
she is agonizing, writing books, or riding bicycles.</P>
<P>     Most of the story is told in Nin's voice, which is an acquired taste
like candied violets.  The camera adopts a soft focus to mirror her writing
style.  One set, apparently near the house where much of the action happens,
is a long walkway next to a wall in night and fog.  It looks very much like
an impressionist painting.  I was hoping we would see it in the daytime or
at least without fog, but we never do.  I remember no other fog in the film
and it is there apparently mostly for effect.</P>
<P>     Kaufman underscores that most of what we are seeing is from Nin's point
of view by having one sequence be a flashback narrated by Miller.  The soft
focus is banished and the prose changes to a hard-boiled Raymond Chandler
style.  Even in Nin's style Fred War may be trying to affect Miller's
character but it comes out like Humphrey Bogart.  Maria de Medeiros' Nin is
a dictionary illustration for "demure" and often also for "naked."  Kaufman
has created a tremendous number of nude positions for couples in which the
parts that would be most busy are out of sight, perhaps trying for an R
rating, or perhaps affecting Anais Nin's point of view.  (Of course, the
film got first an X rating and then inaugurated the NC-17 rating.)  "June"
refers, incidentally, to Miller's wife, played by Uma Thurman, who usually
is not around.</P>
<P>     The film is constantly melodramatic, with deep people feeling deep
emotions which we are told about cheaply and superficially.  You know you're
in trouble when characters start voicing lines like, "Does she think she can
love anything in you I haven't loved?"  Even if these are real people, these
people aren't real.  My rating: -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  It might have
been lower but for the peculiar background created of Paris in the 1930s.</P>
