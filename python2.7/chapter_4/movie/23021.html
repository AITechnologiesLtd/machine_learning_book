<P>Perhaps the best question to ask of a biographical film on the late comedian
Andy Kaufman is whether or not it finds Kaufman's true essence, if it helps
you discover what Andy was really like. It is indeed ironic that "Man on the
Moon" does exactly the opposite-and may be better off for it. Milos Forman's
biopic on the mercurial performer doesn't claim to get a handle on what made
Kaufman tick. It offers up suggestions and possibilities, but can't quite
arrive at a conclusion. Why might this be a good thing? Because "Man on the
Moon" has few pretensions. The film doesn't take one tack on Andy Kaufman
and call it the ultimate truth; rather, it explains his ultimate mystery. No
one knew who Andy was, not even his closest friends. What "Man on the Moon"
displays is how Kaufman's comedy affected others, his friends, co-workers,
and audiences. Aided by an astonishing performance by Jim Carrey in the lead
role, Forman's rendition of this is impressively entertaining and strangely
affecting.</P>
<P>Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, the late comedian whose life "Man on the Moon"
chronicles. The film shows Andy as a showman from the start, "performing" to
the characters on the wallpaper of his childhood bedroom. We then flash
forward to Andy as a young man, performing in local nightclubs. Told by one
owner that he must do a more conventional act, Andy replies he doesn't want
to go for cheap laughs and refuses to merely "tell jokes." He gets his break
when he goes on stage pretending to be a shy foreign man bumbling through
his act-until he launches into a smashing Elvis impersonation that
thoroughly impresses talent scout George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who lands
him appearances on "Saturday Night Live" and a plum role on the TV sitcom
"Taxi" doing his foreign-man shtick as Latka, the lovable mechanic. Kaufman,
however, treats his regular job almost as a chore, merely a vehicle he can
use to pursue more creative endeavors. With the help of his friend and
writing partner Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti) and eventual girlfriend (who meets
Andy initially by accepting his challenge to a wrestling match) Lynne
Marguiles (Courtney Love), Andy creates the repulsive lounge singer
character Tony Clifton (for whom Andy demands appearances on "Taxi," with
disastrous results), fools with the sketch-comedy show "Fridays," takes up
pro wrestling as "Inter-gender Champion," getting into a fight with
fan-favorite Jerry Lawler, and plays Carnegie Hall. Kaufman's life was
tragically cut short in 1984 by a rare form of lung cancer. He was 35.</P>
<P>"Man on the Moon" clearly leans on how well Carrey performs in the lead
role, and fortunately, he is fantastic. For a lifelong comedian who has
spent almost his entire career mugging for the camera, this is an impressive
accomplishment. Carrey truly embodies the character and spirit of Andy
Kaufman. It's hard to explain. Certainly the actor does a fine job of
imitating Kaufman's stunts. His Clifton impression is dead-on, his SNL
"Mighty Mouse" singalong could easily be mistaken for the real thing, and
his "feud" with Lawler that came to a head on David Letterman's "Late Night"
is surprisingly convincing. But that's all imitation-impressive, but not
indicative of a real performance. What Carrey really does well is to
convince the audience that they are not watching a Jim Carrey movie. Without
a doubt, we are always watching a movie about Andy Kaufman, not a movie
about Jim Carrey playing Andy Kaufman. This is a real leap for Carrey. His
star vehicles ("Ace Ventura," "The Mask," "Dumb and Dumber") were exactly
that: means for Carrey to show off, whether you found him amusing or not.
"The Truman Show" gave us some sign of him breaking out of this rut, but it
was still a role that required him to mug, since he was playing a famous TV
star whose life has been constructed to get precisely those reactions out of
him. Here, he cannot do his usual act. He must convincingly embody another
person. For my money, he did as good a job as anyone could have done.</P>
<P>The supporting performers turn in solid turns as Kaufman's closest
companions. DeVito comes off well as George Shapiro, though the role seems
to hamper the later recreation of "Taxi" scenes, since he can't reprise his
part on that show. I liked seeing Paul Giamatti as Bob Zmuda. The man is a
talented character actor who does more good work here. Courtney Love's part
is surprisingly small, almost to the point of becoming the dreaded
Superfluous Love Interest. To her credit, Love doesn't overact and doesn't
distract, accepting her limited role gracefully. What could have been a
major annoyance barely registers. Several star cameos show up in
reenactments of Kaufman's antics. Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Christopher
Lloyd, and Carol Kane make appearances as "Taxi" cast members. Real former
pro wrestler and current broadcaster Jerry Lawler appears in a rather large
part, and does fairly good screen work, to my surprise. A scene where he and
Kaufman explain their act to George Shapiro is priceless. Current WWF
commentator Jim Ross also appears, to no one's surprise, as a wrestling
announcer. Along to recreate the "Late Night" fight are Letterman himself
and bandleader Paul Shaffer. SNL producer Lorne Michaels also plays himself.
Seeing these now more grizzled stars playing younger versions of themselves
is a bit jarring at first, but not hard to get used to.</P>
<P>"Man on the Moon" refuses to be a conventional biopic. Many will go into the
film expecting to get some kind of great insight into Kaufman's life. Why
was he the way he was? Why did he choose to pursue such a career, and why
did that career take such unusual turns? "Man on the Moon" doesn't know. It
doesn't claim to know. In many other films, this could be seen as a cop-out,
but Forman's film is not, because it explains exactly why this approach has
been taken. There are several telling exchanges between Kaufman and his
business partners, friends, and lover. When Lynne tells Andy "There is no
real you," the film's vision has become clear. No one knew who Andy Kaufman
was. If you're looking for insight into that, you've come to the wrong
place. What "Man on the Moon" claims is that Andy was all out there in his
performances, but you had to figure out where that was.</P>
<P>Andy was not a comedian; he was a showman, a man seeking to get people's
attention, to see their reaction to his performances. Some got it, some didn
't, and if you're going to appreciate his brand of "comedy," you had to
first understand what he was trying to do. Explaining this is where "Man on
the Moon" really succeeds, because it starts out with perhaps the most
clever opening of the year: Carrey comes out, brandishing Kaufman's
wide-eyed stare and tells the people in his Latka voice that since so much
of it was false, he had to cut the movie so much that there was no movie
left. He then plays his mini record player and begins rolling the credits.
After a bit of silence, Andy returns and says that was to clear out all the
people who wouldn't understand. This is Forman's way of letting you know
that this will be a story told on Andy's terms, not one to give us a
sentimental picture of his life, but one that will leave us guessing. Andy
often had people so turned around that they didn't know if he was performing
or being serious. When he read "The Great Gatsby" in its entirety to a
theater full of rowdy college students, only those who stuck around really
"got" the joke. Not many cast members got the joke when Tony Clifton trashed
the "Taxi" set. Not many women got the joke when he put himself up as a
misogynist wrestler. Even when he was diagnosed with cancer, no one believed
him.</P>
<P>Likewise a whole lot of people won't really get "Man on the Moon." There is
sure to be a whole lot of disappointment coming from audiences viewing this
film. Some might see it as a mere chronology of Kaufman's life and career,
pointless and empty. Others might think Kaufman was a repulsive person, not
worthy of having a feature film based on his life. But "Man on the Moon" is
really Andy's final performance, his final refusal to play by the rules and
give the people what they think is best. The irony here is that everyone who
is disappointed with this film, everyone who didn't get what they expected,
are those that would be clowned by Andy consistently. So a lot of people are
going to dislike Forman's film. So what? George Shapiro complained to Andy
after a performance, "They hated you out there." And Andy said just what he'
d say about this film: "That means we're a success."</P>
