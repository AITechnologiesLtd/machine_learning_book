<PRE>                              MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE
                       A film review by John Robertson
                        Copyright 1996 John Robertson</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Brian DePalma</PRE>
<P>Starring: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emilio Estevez, Emmanuelle Beart, Henry 
Czerny, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames, Kristin Scott Thomas, Vanessa Redgrave, 
Ingeborge Dapkunaite </P>
<P>Perfect Person Rating*: The Perfect Person for Mission: Impossible is someone 
in the mood for an action thriller, with a keen mind for details coupled with 
the ability to suspend disbelief for a little while.  The Perfect Person for 
this film would probably give it a 9 out of 10.</P>

<P>There is an episode of The Simpsons, when Marge and Homer go to a movie called 
"The Stockholm Affair", a taut, political thriller.  As the movie progresses, 
Homer makes comment after comment, like:</P>
<PRE>"Who's that guy?"
"Who's THAT guy?"
"What did that guy say when I said, "Who's that guy?"?"
"Oh, that submarine is so fake!"
Gasp, "An octopus!"</PRE>
<P>Misison: Impossible made me feel alot like Homer Simpson.  </P>
<P>Mission: Impossible is a fast moving, stylish thriller, based on the 
television show of the sixties.  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, disguise expert 
and point man of an expert team of super spies with a reputation for doing the 
impossible.  The movie begins with Cruise and his team of experts performing 
another mission -- only this one goes horribly wrong.</P>
<P>Cruise escapes, only to discover that he's now considered a traitor.  How will 
he get his clean name back?  By performing another impossible mission, of 
course!</P>
<P>There are several different types of scenes to this movie, and they all work 
in different ways.  When Cruise and his pals are performing missions, it's a 
tight suspenseful film, very well-done.  When Cruise is trying to figure out 
what's really going on, it's a cerebral film.  When Cruise is forced to 
abandon plans and improvise, it becomes a top-notch action film.  I have no 
complaints with any of the three types of scenes you see in Mission: 
Impossible, but you do need to be able to follow closely and use your mind or 
suspend your disbelief in turns, something that isn't too easy to do.</P>
<P>Cruise works well as the charismatic lead of the film, though his acting is 
strained at times.  The supporting actors acquit themselves similarly -- 
effectively, but not flawlessly.  Interestingly, Emelio Esteves appears 
uncredited in the film, only to make a rather quick and brutal exit.  </P>
<P>When you talk about summer blockbusters, Mission: Impossible fits the bill.  
It's not a perfect film, but it thrills you, engages your mind, and lets you 
leave the theater thinking.  It's pretty hard to follow at times, and you do 
start to feel like a certain member of the Simpsons, but you could do much 
worse.</P>

<P>* Perfect Person Rating: The Perfect Person Rating is an attempt to give the 
reader a new way of understanding my rating. Rather than give a film a score, 
either overall, or on several attributes, the Perfect Person Rating tries to 
identify the type of person would enjoy this movie the most. Since a reviewer 
is by nature someone with a great deal of experience in what they are 
reviewing, their experience may not be the same as someone who has less 
experience, is less jaded, or more attuned to the subject. Hopefully the 
Perfect Person Rating will go further toward eliminating reviewer bias than a 
simple rating scale. Comments are appreciated. </P>
