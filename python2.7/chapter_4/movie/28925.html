<PRE>BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
July 3rd, 2001</PRE>
<P>Renee Zellweger is an actress whose sprightly charm and quivering, cutesy smile
can melt moviegoers' hearts like no other. She is the girl-next-door type but
her irresistibility breaks some new ground here - you get the feeling that she
can be embarrassed and impish at the same time. She is the unique joy of
"Bridget Jones' Diary," a fairly amusing if slightly misguided
romantic comedy with ample charm and considerable laughs. It just lacks the
extra leap to take it beyond conventionality. </P>
<P>Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is the neurotic, lonely, uncouth heroine of the
1996 bestseller by Helen Fielding. She is so lonely that she drinks
heavily while listening to Eric Carmen's "All By Myself" (a touching,
heartbreaking moment). At first glance, no one seems to take a gander at
Bridget. She is plumpish and tends to say exactly what is on her mind, including
at book receptions where everyone looks at her with slight bemusement. At dinner
parties, she confronts men who see her as an unappealing spinster, including the
rich Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth). Her boss,
however, takes a liking to her (he is played with irresistible glee by Hugh
Grant), and the two begin having an affair. Of course, Mr. Darcy gets jealous
since he does like her. </P>
<P>It is no surprise where the film is headed when we know Mr. Darcy will
inevitably change his mind about Bridget. But the film takes on a knowing,
self-conscious style at the beginning where we begin to think that it will poke
fun at romantic comedy conventions. There is a moment where Bridget
> makes an error in judgment at work and we see her unsaid obscenity splashed
across the screen. "Bridget Jones' Diary," however, does not take as many
unconventional routes as one might hope. Bridget loves the two men but has to
decide between one. Bridget tries to bring her parents back together after a
brief separation. Some of these episodes work better than others but they hardly
figure cohesively as a whole. </P>
<P>I have not read Fielding's book but I've been told that it truly maps out
Bridget's insecurities and messy lifestyle with more depth. The film does show
her drinking and eating and smoking too much and we sense she is real obsessive
and has trouble finding the proper man (she is also a bad cook, witness the
strange coloring of her cooked meals). But all these qualities are painted in
broad strokes. Bridget's biggest flaw seems to be her uncouth quality but I was
not clear why everyone seemed so perturbed whenever she made a speech (I found
her speeches funny and engaging). As played by Zellweger, she has charm and an
affable quality but her weight gain (reports say she gained as much as 20 to 40
pounds for the role) does not exactly put her on the same scale as Conchata
Ferrell (who I love no matter how much she weighs). In other words, I get the
sense that the film has been sanitized from its written form to accommodate all
women in the audience. Where does this leave the wom!
en who are perhaps uncomfortable
 with their weight or who need someone like Bridget Jones as their role model,
essentially saying it is okay to be fat and still have Hugh Grant as your
suitor? </P>
<P>"Bridget Jones' Diary" has Zellweger at its center and she is as convincing and
delightful as one can imagine. Kudos also go to Hugh Grant and Colin Firth in
witty supporting roles (I could have lived without a cliched
fistfight between them). There is also a funny cameo by Salman Rushdie as
himself no less. The film has pizazz to offer but compare this to any other
romantic comedy, and I dare you to find the difference. </P>
