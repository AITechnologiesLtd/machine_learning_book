Destry Rides Again (1939)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 75</PRE>
<P>"Destry Rides Again" is a very good movie.  Comedy and Drama,
more the former than the latter, are effectively mixed.
The plot is thick, there is plenty of action to keep things
moving, and the many supporting players have well-defined
characters.</P>
<P>"Destry Rides Again" is a Western Comedy.  Crooked saloon
owner Brian Donlevy, mayor Samuel Hinds, and entertainer 
Marlene Dietrich are cheating honest folks of their ranches. 
The sheriff is murdered, and drunken fool Charles Winninger is 
appointed new sheriff.  Winninger brings in legendary lawman 
James Stewart, who has eccentric law and order philosophies.</P>
<P>"Destry Rides Again" demonstrated that Stewart was a
comedic as well as dramatic actor, skills later demonstrated
in "Harvey" and "Magic Town".  Dietrich added another
dimension to her femme fatale stereotype, and revived
her flagging career.</P>
<P>It is not a perfect movie.  The closing battle at the tavern
is muddled, and Stewart's actions are not consistent.
First he is a pacifist, and then he isn't.  Now he is
amiable, now he's a tough guy.  Dietrich and blowhard
Jack Carson have sudden character transformations.
Also, Stewart's secondary love interest (Irene Hervey)
might as well be Miss Perfect.</P>
<P>Still, the brawl between Dietrich, Mrs. Callahan, and Stewart
is great cinema.  And there are so many great supporting
roles, especially Hinds and excitable ranch owner Tom Fadden.</P>
