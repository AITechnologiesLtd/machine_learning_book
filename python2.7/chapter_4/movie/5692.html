<PRE>                              DEATH IN VENICE
                       A film review by Ralph Benner
                        Copyright 1996 Ralph Benner</PRE>
<P>        Venice -- the great watery serpent of indefinable plagues and 
forebodings, the last grand visitation of rotting romanticism, the Grim 
Reaper as elegant theme park. This city's atmosphere of Borgesian imagery 
is the quintessential setting for the pitifu end of Gustav von Aschenbach 
in Thomas Mann's exquistely prosed DEATH IN VENICE. There's no locale on 
earth more conducive to let Aschenbach feel, as Mann wrote, "a dark 
contentment with what was taking place...(the) wicked secret of the city 
was welded ith (my) own secret." But too much of moribund Venice and 
rationalized sexual repression can do a reader in: Mann's writer, who 
lost Cicero's "foundation of eloquence" early in the story, is already 
pegged a sexual malcontent by the fourth page and by t  time his 
Aschenbach finds in a fourteen year old his Prince Charming and goes on 
and on about the boy's Narcissism, you're very close to exhaustion; you 
can't wait until the sirocco -- the winds off the Mediterranean that have 
been known to carry death - overtake him so you can be relieved of his 
unfulfilled desires. Mann believed "writers are happiest with an idea 
which can become all emotion and an emotion all idea," but he's 
insistently Germanic with mythological veneration of beauty as pardon for 
 e emotion that dare not speak its name. He may have gone beyond his 
Germanism; he's eclipsed the spiritual and physical enthrall of beauty -- 
the young Tadzio is, by end, not Herrmes but Michelangelo's David -- and 
made Aschenbach an intellectual pedoph e. The story isn't so much a study 
of the dangers of consuming beauty as it is punishment for private 
thoughts as crime never committed. </P>
<P>        Luchino Visconti's movie version of DEATH IN VENICE, even with 
changing Aschenbach from writer to composer, modelled after Mahler, is 
reconstructed with stunning fidelity to Mann: just about every major 
scene in the story is brought to the screen witho  compromise. Visually, 
with maybe not more than a few dozen pages of dialogue, Visconti and his 
crew -- photographer Pasqualino De Santis (who also did 1984's best movie 
BIZET'S CARMEN), costume designer Piero Tosi and art director Ferdinando 
Scarfiotti - give us a languishing, glamorously stifling Venetian holiday 
at the turn of the century as a malignancy of class snobbery; the images 
reek with an aura of knowing denial. While his camera scales Venice to 
exacting proportions -- St. Mark's Square is m e to look its real size -- 
De Santis also catches the funereal gandola and its seats perfectly, just 
as Mann did, and the green goo of the canals and the cold, damp walls you 
bump into as you make passage through the mazy narrow walkways, which can 
be l e journeys into a menacing past. Even the author's pathos that makes 
you squeamish -- the barber's vulgar touch-up of Aschenbach's hair, 
cheeks and lips -- is here in all its ingloriousness. </P>
<P>        Dirk Bogarde's Gustav is made up to look like Thomas Mann, but he 
doesn't have Mann's imposing height or air of eloquence, and he could 
never be accused of being Germanic; every flabby cell of his being 
confirms he's an English pris. It's this later pa  that makes him wrong 
for the role but obviously appealing to those closeted academicians who 
rave about his performance -- because educated inverts who don't engage 
in the sex of their wishes and who hide between the stacks of their 
libraries often do  come grotesque parodies. Bogarde manages the slow 
death of consumption -- a crumbling artist devoured by beauty and its 
controvertable attractions and hindered by restrictive societal 
proprieties. And the less he says, the better the performance. But Bo rde 
isn't Aschenbach the German, and without that identity the story loses 
its tragedy; though Gustav is already in the fall of his lifetime, it's 
his Teutonic masculinity that he betrays in his feeble attempts to 
reenergize. We're supposed to be in hor r at his dissipatedness when he 
uses any trick to recapture what's gone forever. As Bogarde plays him, 
Gustav's a dignified horror right from the start and so when he's being 
primped up or when he slumps over to his death, with his hair dye running 
down is face, there's no tragic punch. He's a pathetic English Yuri out 
of a gay Pasternak -- and his Lara doesn't continue onward through the 
snow but out to sea, stopping long enough to give the old man his last 
jollies with a David come-on. </P>
<P>        What's ambiguous about Mann's story is Aschenbach's pride in 
virility -- his lack of admiration for his own maleness -- and that is 
the opening that Visconti takes advantage of through Bogarde. There is 
something annoyingly simpy about Aschenbach, espe ally to those of us who 
are attracted to Germans and don't see them as fearful when it comes to 
their sexual curiosities. Discreet, yes, procrastinators, no. One of the 
more effective psychological weapons Hitler was able to use on his own 
people is the doration of assumed Aryan perfection; he took advantage of 
their idolization of their own robust, hearty physicality. He didn't 
invent it, he only re-packaged what has always been there. (Enamoured of 
Germany, having spent a year in the baroque conceit   Wurzburg and having 
returned to the country three times since, I can say with a modicum of 
authority that some of the most exciting experiences a traveller can have 
is finding one's self inflamed by the Germanic; the heat can be best 
described as sexua fascism.) Recent biographers claim Mann also had 
personal conflicts with his own attractions to men -- particularly to 
orthodox Georgian Ernst Glockner. And if true, this explains why his 
Aschenbach hadn't the inner-fortitude to go to his logical step:  German 
true to his loins would have at least sneaked a peek into Tadzio's beach 
tent.</P>
<P>        Mann ejaculates, "With astonishment Aschenbach noted that the boy 
was absolutely beautiful. His face, pale and reserved, framed with 
honey-colored hair, the straight sloping nose, the lovely mouth, the 
expression of sweet and godlike seriousness, recal d Greek sculpture of 
the noblest periods; and the complete purity of the form was accompanied 
by such a rare personal charm that, as he watched, he felt that he had 
never met with anything equally felicitous in nature...it was clear that 
in his existenc the first factors were gentleness and tenderness. The 
shears had been resolutely kept from his beautiful hair; like a Prince 
Charming's, it fell in curls over his forehead, his ears, and still 
deeper, across his neck." The more Mann's Aschenbach goes on dolizing 
Tadzio, the more you wonder where an actor could be found to physically 
live up to the description. Visconti did, though, in Bjorn Andresen. If 
the effeminacy isn't quite Grecian, he's still a ravishing icon; he's so 
delicate a creation that ev yone wants him and at the same time wants to 
protect him. Mann suggests that Tadzio is oblivious tease without sexual 
experience, but Andresen is directed to be a precocious temptress; 
Visconti allows Andresen to imply through too many glances a recepti ness 
to invitation. But I couldn't respond to Andresen, perhaps because I kept 
seeing in him his British equivalent actress Patricia Hodge, whose 
identical porcelain symmetry, while an attraction in THE LIVES AND LOVES 
OF A SHE-DEVIL and THE CLONING OF  ANNA MAY, can also leave you stone 
cold. (They're not quite celestial androgynies, they're Draculized 
inflatibles.) From the movie's point of view, though, there can be no 
question where Tadzio's looks come from -- Silvana Mangano. She's a 
breathtaking  rgaret Leighton. </P>
<P>        Born into authentic nobility in Milan in 1906, Visconti became a 
Communist ideologue who, with his OSSESSIONE (which borrowed heavily from 
James Cain's THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE), raged against Fascism. When 
Mussolini and Hitler were finished off, so were the director's passions 
for the proletariat, though he'd periodically return to condemn Fascism 
-- 1969's THE DAMNED his last major treatise. Aficionados of trash still 
talk about mommie Ingrid Thulin and sonnie transvestite Helmut erger 
bedding down together; about the "Night of the Long Knives" sequence; 
about what goodies were edited out. (The truth may be that, for all 
Visconti's harping about the Nazis, he's an inveterate German, addicted 
to his adopted culture's degenerate c ssicism.) Most of Visconti's time 
was spent dreaming about and occasionally making epics on the aristocracy 
of Europe -- THE LEOPARD (with Burt Lancaster doing Visconti) and LUDWIG, 
about the innocently mad King of Bavaria, famous for his addiction to r l 
fairy tale castles, Wagner and his music. Attracted to DEATH IN VENICE 
partly as a tale of woe about unconsumated Adonis worship that Mann 
literally came upon while visiting Venice -- almost all the details in 
the story are authentic to his observance  including the threat of 
wind-carried disease, prophetic encounters with an aging queen and his 
Tadzio; attracted partly because of his own sexual preference; drawn to 
it partly because so many intellectuals were pushing him to film it -- 
can't you just ear the ivy leaguers sighing, "Oh, Luchino, it's my 
story!" -- and attracted partly, if not largely, to it because of his 
aristocratic iciness, Visconti's as good a choice as any to make a movie 
of Mann's frost-nipped melodrama about proscriptions neith  probably ever 
considered justified. They both knew how to give you a case of the chills 
about sexual heat.</P>
