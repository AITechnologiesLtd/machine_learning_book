<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>A considerable portion of Forces of Nature feels like a 90's remake of
Plains, Trains and Automobiles, with only a couple of notable
differences.  Whereas Steven Martin desperately tried to make it home
for thanksgiving in 1989, Ben Affleck is engaged to be married and is
battling against time (and a fear of flying) to attend his wedding
ceremony.  From trailers and posters, it's no secret that this is a boy
meets girl film, but again, there are couple of exceptions.  This is not
your average Hollywood romantic comedy since its two principal
characters carry weighty emotional baggage with them.  Whilst there is
nothing drastically wrong with Forces of Nature - a very likeable
piece - it ends up stabbing itself in the foot by trying to be too smart
too quick.  There will undoubtedly be many smiling faces walking out
from the movie; others, like me, will feel a little cheated.</P>
<P>Affleck plays Ben Holmes, a man who is about to get married and
everybody is telling him how marriage is a bad idea.  His best man is
demanding that he sleep around before committing himself, and his
agitated parents hardly provide a welcoming example of holy matrimony.
On his way home, Ben's plane skids off the runway and he quickly finds
himself forming a partnership with a sexy, mysterious lady named Sarah
(Sandra Bullock) as they fight traffic, police and, yes, forces of
nature to get to their destinations.  Sarah's gorgeous looks and
fearless spirit tempt Ben, but he soon realizes that there is more to
her than she would like him to believe.</P>
<P>Much of Sandra Bullock's character is purposely self-explanatory, but
it's hard to grasp where she is coming from and what she is after.
Sure, she works on more levels than just pleasing eye candy for the
guys, but this doesn't substitute the fact that she is not properly
digested by the film's screenplay.  Consequently, this slightly hinders
Bullocks appealing performance and the believability of Sarah and Ben's
relationship.  Affleck has a better grasp on his material, and he
delivers his lines with the kind of goofy sincerity that made Steve
Martin a star.</P>
<P>This is quite a funny, and definitely likeable film littered with many
cynical jokes about marriage and relationships.  Look out for some
impressive work by cinematographer Elliot Davis, who gives the film a
lively visual feel - he even succeeds in making a rain storm the basis
of one of the film's best choreographed sequences.  With so much
romantic fluff, it's a wonder why director Bronwen Hughes decided on a
rather cynical novelty ending that is poorly staged and written.  Love,
it seems, carries confusion with it, and this is quite a confusing
completion to an otherwise simplistic story.  Forces of Nature succeeds
in giving viewers plenty to talk about in the car ride home, but this is
one film in which an unexpected ending works to its disadvantage.  Not a
bad film, in fact it's quite a good one.  But Forces of Nature tries to
be too smart too quick, when it should have been dumb but enjoyable.</P>
