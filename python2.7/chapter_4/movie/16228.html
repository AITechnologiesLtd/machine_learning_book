<P>Some films take you by surprise, and just tear you apart.  And then some
films make you feel guilty that you didn't enjoy them sooner. NELL is such
an example.</P>
<P>This is an excellent, loving, and caring film about .... well, about ....
Nell, who has been raised in the woods away from all contact, except her own
corners of the world.  And she has created her own language, based on the
sounds of her grandmother who brought her up.  Nell had been afraid of the
daylight since her young days, when she was scared.</P>
<P>And two people have come to discover Nell, and have different opinions about
how to study her and re-introduce her to society.  Jerome is a bit of an
anthropologist, and he does things his own way.  And Paula
is representing an academic side that takes what it can at whatever price
for the sake of its own ego.</P>
<P>And Jerome manages to get a three month observation period, to find out what
they will do with Nell, now that she is by herself.  They find that Nell
comes out at night, and sleeps most of the day.  During the night she lives
her imagination, and the memories of her childhood, with what appears to be
a twin sister who died, in unclear situations, and was buried by Nell amidst
the rocks and caves in the area.</P>
<P>Nell manages to survive the eventual court proceedings, and she has  grown
to cope very well with everything around her.  She eventually  joins the
family of the local sheriff, whose wife has a similar  physical condition to
that of Nell.   Nell may have grown some, and her innocence is now
translating into womanhood, but she has not lost any of the feel she has for
the child within, as the last scene  indicates.</P>
<P>There are some wonderful things in this film, and most of them center around
Jodie Foster, and the design of the film.  It is a visual showcase, and well
designed in the evening and night scenes that it creates to display the
child within this grown woman.  In the evenings Nell goes to the lake in
front of the house and relives in
her mind, the happy days with a twin sister, and the way this is directed
and photographed leaves no doubt as to what is the prettiest and best part
of this film and story, and what we, the audience, are supposed to defend.</P>
<P>This is a film with excellent performances, even if Liam Neeson is probably
the weaker of the three leads.  He seems to gasp to keep up with two ladies
that have lived theatre and film all their lives and know how to be and
unload at any minute.  His character is good but not as strong as the other
two.  The other two stand out,  and Liam's characterization only stands out
because he is in the way between the outside and Nell, and just about
everyone has to go through him.  But he manages to hold himself well, even
if the acting has to descend into the level of mechanics to be able to get
something across.  One never feels this lack of ability and confidence in
the other two ladies.  But it is not fair to say that Liam is not good.  He
is very good.</P>
<P>This is an excellent film, well designed all around, with excellent music
and cinematography for anyone who is capable of enjoying these things.  It
is not only a strong film, but one that will linger for some time in one's
mind.  Quite an achievement in design and creativity.</P>
<PRE>Excellent work.</PRE>
