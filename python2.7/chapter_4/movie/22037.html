<P>_Liberty_Heights_ (R) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>_Liberty_Heights_, writer-director Barry Levinson's fourth cinematic ode
to his hometown of Baltimore, plays like a memory, and with that
description comes everything it entails.  While a work of great affection
for the time and place it so painstakingly recreates, the film also
suffers from a problem not unlike one described by the narrator at the
film's end: the images in his memory are not always as sharp as he'd like
them to be.  Similarly, the meandering focus of Levinson's script isn't
quite as sharp as it should be, but there is nothing muddled about the
warm feelings the film strongly evokes.</P>
<P>_Liberty_Heights_ takes its name from a Jewish neighborhood in 1954
Baltimore, the setting for the coming-of-age stories of brothers Ben (Ben
Foster) and Van (Adrien Brody).  University student Van's storyline
follows his attraction to a blonde gentile beauty (Carolyn Murphy) who,
unbeknownst to him, is the girlfriend of his rich preppie buddy Trey
(Justin Chambers).  The more interesting thread belongs to high schooler
Ben, who falls for Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson), a fetching young lady who
shares his homeroom.  The complication, however, is that she's
African-American.</P>
<P>Speaking in terms of plot, there is not much at all to either of these
storylines.  But on these thin threads, Levinson hangs a number of
smaller details that lend the film its beguiling and universal flavor. 
While the stories are told from a Jewish perspective circa the mid-1950s,
anyone can relate to the awkwardness and bliss of first love; the pursuit
of that love in the face of adversity, societal or otherwise; the
challenging of stereotypes; and living through a time of sweeping social
change.  The likable cast, in particular Foster and Johnson, make it even
easier to get involved in the proceedings.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, however, _Liberty_Heights_ is not entirely a
coming-of-age of youth, but that of an entire family.  In addition to the
stories of Ben and Van, the other prominent plot thread involves their
father (Joe Mantegna), a burlesque house owner and numbers racketeer who
finds both of his businesses being irreversibly affected by the changing
times.  This thread, which also comes to involve an errant drug dealer
(Orlando Jones), never feels quite of a piece with the gentler youth
stories, and the (inevitable) convergence with Ben's storyline feels
forced.</P>
<P>Levinson obviously enjoys remembering the times of his youth, and like
people often do while reminiscing, he loses track of time.  At 120
minutes, _Liberty_Heights_ is overlong by at least 20 minutes, its energy
dissipating and ultimately completely draining by the time the final
credits start rolling.  But what  remains strong as ever by that point is
the wistful emotion the film evokes, the bittersweet affection that comes
with looking back at an era that was, for better and worse, much simpler.</P>
