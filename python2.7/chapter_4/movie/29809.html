<PRE>                              HEIST
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<PRE>    CAPSULE: This is one of David Mamet's best.  It is a 
    razor-sharp crime film.  Gene Hackman stars as a very smart 
    robber pulled into one final heist for a crime lord played 
    by Danny DeVito.  Clever robbery plans and double crosses 
    stud the plot.  And the Mamet dialog is great even if the 
    Mamet stagy acting is not always so hot.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), 
    high +2 (-4 to +4) </PRE>
<P>One never quite knows what one is going to get with a Mamet film.  
His AMERICAN BUFFALO is a set-bound piece that has very little 
plot.  Sometimes he will tell a story that really moves.  HEIST is 
Mamet doing his most entertaining work.  Unlike his THE SPANISH 
PRISONER, there are no lapses in credibility.  HEIST is probably 
the best Mamet thriller since HOUSE OF GAMES.  It is the kind of 
plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom, and 
frequently it is Mamet double-crossing the viewer.  Watching the 
film's team getting around security the viewer is frequently 
asking himself either "what the heck are they doing?" or "why 
didn't anybody think of that before?" </P>
<P>Appropriately enough HEIST opens with a very clever jewelry store 
job.  It is so clever that one wonders if Mamet really thinks up 
all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional 
magician and con expert Ricky Jay, now a regular actor in Mamet 
films.  This is a robbery that works like a well-oiled machine.  
There is just one problem and it is enough to get Joe Moore 
(played by Gene Hackman) filmed on a security camera.  Now Joe has 
to get out of the business.  It was coming time anyway.  Joe's 
team including Bobby Blane (Delroy Lindo), Fran Moor (Rebecca 
Pidgeon), and Pinky Pincus (Ricky Jay) is going to split up and go 
separate ways.  But crime boss Bergman (Danny DeVito) is pulling 
the strings and he says that Joe and his people have to manage one 
more robbery.  And he has to take along a young kid, the short-
fused Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell).  Immediately it is obvious that 
there is more going on than meets the eye. </P>
<P>Much of what distinguishes HEIST is Mamet's dialog.  Remarkably it 
serves a double purpose.  The robbery team sounds at once very 
professional and at the same time it has Mamet's special feel for 
dialog.  Hackman has lines like "Everybody needs money.  That's 
why they call it money."  Mamet's timing is perfect in the 
direction but terrible in the production.  The plot is 
coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent THE SCORE, which 
is, in fact, a very similar story.  Both are good films, perhaps 
for some of the same reasons.  But at least on a high level they 
are much the same story.  The other problem with the timing of 
HEIST is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get 
around them.  I saw the film at the Toronto International Film 
Festival on September 12, 2001.  That made the subject matter just 
a little too timely.  My understanding is that the release will be 
delayed. </P>
<P>My biggest problem with the film is that Rebecca Pidgeon's acting 
at times seems very poor.  It is some kind of Mamet trademark I do 
not understand to have women talk without inflection, as if they 
are just reading the words for the first time.  It is an 
irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good 
thriller.  It is one I rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high 
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
