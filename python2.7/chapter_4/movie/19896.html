<P>   The major particular to recognize about "Shiri," a Korean
production which received its North American premiere at the
22nd annual Asian-American International Film Festival--is
not the quality of the movie itself.  By Hollywood standards,
the production values are just satisfactory, the story about as
original as a Jean-Claude Van Damme video game, the
romance tepid and hardly credible.  Rather, what's striking is
that this movie has toppled all box office records in its home
country, overturning even "Titanic" to bring in an astonishing
return from the people of that divided Asian nation.  How to
explain the phenomenon?  No doubt the adrenaline-charged
action, which keeps conversations to a minimum, didn't hurt. 
Nor did the presence of Han Suckyu, Korea's number one
star, the country's Tom Cruise.  Like Americans, people
throughout most of the world probably put action pictures at
the top of their lists, and given the preoccupation of "Shiri"
with Korea's leading political dilemma, the division of the
country into two independent sovereignties, "Shiri" was bound
to become a big hit.</P>
<P>  Yet the picture has not yet found an American distributor,
despite the good quality of the English subtitles--the reasons
perhaps being that none of the performers has any
recognition at all except within this country's small Korean-
American communities, and dozens of domestic action
pictures will keep the public busy the year 'round.  Were it
not for the annual Asian-American International Film Festival,
which highlights films featuring Asians and Asian-Americans,
chances are that no one in the U.S. would have had the
opportunity to see this mundane picture.</P>
<P>   Its chief flaw, one which impairs our enjoyment of at least
the first half of this nearly two-hour production, is not even
the credibility factor.  With action-adventure movies we're
perfectly willing to suspend disbelief.  But we must be made
privy to at least a whisper of what's going on.  "Shiri" begins
like a video game, the sort that has zero character
development.  While video games require none--they demand
only that you rack up points by shooting down terrorists and
the like--a film needs to give the audience at least a clue or
two from the very beginning.  "Shiri," however, begins with a
Hong Kong style shoot-'em-up involving sinister people
carrying considerable firepower, virtual killing machines that
destroy everything that moves without seeming rhyme or
reason.  In this case, a film review would not be giving away
information better left concealed by informing readers of the
central plot point. "Shiri"--apparently transliterated from a fish
known as a swiri (whose meaning becomes clear midway)--
involves the struggle of a North Korean unit without the
authorization of its own government to provoke a war with the
South, a combat which the bad guys hope will result in the
unification of the two Koreas after fifty years of division.  The
unit is led by a fanatic name Park (Choi Minsk), a man who
escaped from a plane during a foiled hijack attempt and who
has vowed to override the "corruption" of the politicians on
both sides.  Like some Palestinian extremist groups today, he
has little faith that even his own side will bring about the
reunification that dominates his dreams.</P>
<P>   Park conspires with his band of fellow fanatics to seize a
brand new weapon developed by the South, the CPX, a liquid
bomb indistinguishable from plain water.  The weapon, when
triggered by a combination of fuse and powerful lights shone
on it, can vaporize everything within at least a kilometer of its
center.  Park hopes to provoke a final conflict in Korea by the
strategic placement and detonation of up to ten of these
bombs.  Intelligence agents led by Ryu (Hans Suckyu) seek
to destroy the villain and recover the hijacked bombs, but to
do this Ryu must learn the identity of a leak within the
agency.  Since he, like every other agent, trusts nobody, not
even his partner, he is at a loss to understand how secret
information has become the property of the terrorists.  </P>
<P>   When director Kang Jegyu is not contemplating nuclear war
or something as trivial as mass murder by grotesque machine
guns, he focuses his camera on a luke-warm romance
between Ryu and his current squeeze and fiance, Hyun (Kim
Yunjin).  So tepid is this liaison that when the two are in bed
confessing their passion, Kim is fully dressed while her man
lies coyly protected by sheets up to his neck.</P>
<P>   At the very least, the film will educate its audience to the
political thinking that has dominated Korea for the past fifty
years.  In 1910 Japan annexed the country, calling it Chosun. 
After World War 2, two major allied powers occupied the
former Japanese protectorate, and at Potsdam the Soviet
Union and the United States divided Korea at the 38th
parallel, with the Soviets installing a Communist system in the
North while frustrating the desires of the Korean people to
reunify.  In the film, the satanic Park correctly points out that
while South Korea--which had been administered by the U.S.
for several years after Potsdam--is enjoying hamburger and
cokes, the children of the North are starving.  "The world is
unfair," he whines, implying that the poverty in the North is
somehow the fault of its neighbors to the South.  But political
points aside, "Shiri" is strictly a run-of-the-mill, formulaic
operation.</P>
