<P>A Review by Akiva Gottlieb
When Francis Ford Coppola entered the movie business,
he should have anticipated that his entire family
would also leave their own mark. Sofia Coppola is his
daughter, Talia Shire is his sister, and Nicolas Cage
is his nephew. Cage married Patricia Arquette, Sofia
Coppola married Spike (`Being John Malkovich') Jonze,
and Talia Shire wed Jack Schwartzman, a film producer.
The Schwartzmans had two children, Jason, who starred
in 1998's `Rushmore', and Robert, whose feature film
debut is in cousin Sofia's `The Virgin Suicides'.</P>
<P>If Sofia is trying hard to live up to her family's
distinguished name, then she doesn't show it, because
`Virgin Suicides' is a leisurely-paced, darkly comical
and often dreamlike first feature. After her
performance in `The Godfather Part III' received
critical pans, she turned her ambitions to photography
and fashion, and succeeded in both fields. Her unique
visual flair lends a quiet subtlety to her portrait of
suburban dismay.</P>
<P>`The Virgin Suicides', based on the novel by Jeffrey
Eugenides, is the story of five unattainable teenage
girls and the four boys who lust after them in 1970's
Michigan. The five Lisbon sisters live in a quiet
suburban house with their domineering mother (Kathleen
Turner) and their passive father (James Woods). The
mysterious girls live by strict rules, and the fact
that they're not allowed to go out at night adds to
the boys' obsession.</P>
<P>Things become more mysterious when the youngest Lisbon
sister, Cecilia (Hanna Hall), attempts a suicide.
`You've never been a thirteen-year-old girl,' she
tells a psychologist (Danny DeVito). When she gets
better, the parents let the girls throw the first and
only party of their short lives. For the first time,
the neighborhood boys are able to sneak a peek at the
world of the Lisbon sisters.</P>
<P>But the party turns tragic as Cecilia tries suicide
once again, and succeeds. An even thicker cloud of
mystery shrouds the house Strangely, in the aftermath,
all the Lisbons act as if the suicide had never
occurred, </P>
<P>It is at this point that school hunk Trip Fontaine
(Josh Hartnett) meets the dreamily gorgeous Lux Lisbon
(Kirsten Dunst). Against all odds, he is able to
persuade Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take her to the
homecoming dance. He is the first and only boy to ever
get close to one of the sisters. But the events that
occur at the dance lead Mr. And Mrs. Lisbon to remove
the girls from school and leave them locked up in the
house 24 hours a day. This builds up to a climax that
will be the most talked about aspect of the film.</P>
<P>Sofia Coppola has succeeded in painting a vivid
portrait of adolescent obsession that feels a lot like
a dream. Like all dreams, not everything is clear at
first, and everything is open to interpretation.
Coppola's film is a mystery with an open ending, like
waking up from a nightmare because you can't dream
your own death.</P>
<P>There's so much subtlety here, that it makes me wonder
why the filmmakers provided voice-over narration (by
Giovanni Ribisi) to tell the emotions of the
characters in almost every scene. It's an overused
tactic that's used to death in this film. Coppola's
pictures speak louder than words, and the film would
have been even better without the running commentary. </P>
<P>James Woods and Kathleen Turner give nice, restrained
performances as the parents, but it is the beautiful
Kirsten Dunst (`Dick', `Interview With The Vampire')
who steals the show. We never learn very much about
the Lisbon sisters, but Dunst makes Lux the one the
audience is still thinking about when the film is
over.</P>
<P>Sofia Coppola's absorbing debut film proves once again
that the only good films about teenagers are from the
art-house. With its delicate balance of fantasy and
reality, a screen full of beautiful imagery, and a
haunting musical score by Air that I ended up
purchasing, `The Virgin Suicides' is one of the first
pleasant surprises to emerge from Sundance 2000.</P>
