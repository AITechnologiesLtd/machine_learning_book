<PRE>                     The Lost World: Jurassic Park </PRE>
<PRE>                        A movie by Steven Spielberg</PRE>
<P>  With Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite</P>
<P>The lights are on but nobody's home. This is a movie without any
storyline worth mentioning, a bunch of good actors who aren't allowed
to act and marvelous dinosaurs. Let's start with the good things. The
computer generated dinosaurs as well as the animatronics seem even
more real than in 'Jurassic Park'. I also liked the way they were
used, exept for the T. rexes who had to be the typical small family.
It was for the sake of the dinosaurs that I don't regret having spent
more than two hours in a movie theater. I didn't even care that the
dinos were shown off without any story worth mentioning to wrap them
up in. Let's hear it for progress. Too bad that so many movie makers
think they don't have to care about anything else
if only they creatively play with their special effects .Why worry
about something like a good script, for example. The few strings of
story David Koepp wove to connect the dino scenes can only be called
annoying.</P>
<P>Cynical, serene Ian Malcolm as we know him from the books and the
first movie has changed into a chauvinist jerk. Even Jeff Goldblum
can't save the part. The script condemns him to save his seemingly
stupid girl friend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) from the dinosaurs.
She allegedly is a paleontologist familiar with predators. Still she
breaks even the most simple of rules like don't touch the young, don't
walk around in bloody clothing. Apart from that she utters cool
speeches, stares into the camera and screams.</P>
<P>Oh, well, as we all know women only watch this kind of movie only for
their boy friends' or husbands' sakes. So why create a credible female
lead that women in the audience can identify with and rob the guys of
this cozy "Women!" -feeling.</P>
<P>Isla Sorna, the dinosaur island, is a paradise for real men. On the
good guys' team apart from  Malcolm we have Nick Van Owen (Vince
Vaughn), radical environmentalist, lovable on-duty macho and
one-man-backup-plan and nice Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) who ends up
being the only good guy eaten by the T. rexes.</P>
<P>On the bad guys' team there are Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite), the
Great White Hunter with the noble heart who is looking for the
ultimate trophy and psychopathic dino-torturer Dieter Stark (Peter
Stormare) who first meets a swarm of compies and then his maker
because his pal prefers to listen to his walkman instead of Dieter's
cries for help. Morale: evil always is punished justly.</P>
<P>For a negative role model the men are presented with wimp Peter Ludlow
(Arliss Howard) who may be rich but no real man. Even his own men
rather follow Nick Van Owen. Tsk, tsk.</P>
<P>Michael Crichton could have saved himself the trouble of writing a
sequel to 'Jurassic Park'. All that is left of it in David Koepp's
script is the trailer scene and some names. My favorite dinosaur
scenes are taken from the first book. The rest is stolen from other
movies - oops, sorry, that's called hommage. John Wayne certainly
would have loved the technical advancement of animal catching in the
'Hatari'-scene.</P>
<P>About half way through the movie I reached the point when I didn't
want to see another face staring open mouthed into the camera or
another vibration in a puddle. But there was no mercy... In spite of
all this I cannot help but admire Steven Spielberg. How he could keep
a straight face in various interviews as he claimed to have focused on
character developement is beyond me. Maybe he should take up acting.</P>
<P>And once more the dinosaurs are not wiped off the face of the Earth,
as Michael Crichton had planned in his first dinosaur book. John
Hammond (Richard Attenborough) suggests to maintain a dino reservation
on Isla Sorna. I see another sequel coming up. Money can keep rolling
in when real men want to measure their strength against the
prehistoric giants. 
Who needs Marlborough Country...</P>
