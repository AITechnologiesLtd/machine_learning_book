Susan Granger's review of "SWEET AND LOWDOWN" (Sony Classics)</PRE>
<P>Vintage jazz aficionados will appreciate Woody Allen's
fanciful mock documentary about a legendary musician of the 1930s,
allegedly the second-best jazz guitarist in the world. This totally
fictional character, named Emmet Ray and embodied by Sean Penn, is a
jaunty, self-absorbed egotist who justifies his aloof, amoral behavior
by explaining that he's an "artist."  Ray lives in awe of his idol,
Django Reinhardt, the son of gypsies who lives and plays in France,
and brashly admits that loves his guitar more than any woman who ever
shared his bed. There are two memorable women with whom the itinerant
Ray becomes involved. First, he lives with the long-suffering,
worshipful Hattie (superbly played by British actress Samantha
Morton), a mute laundress whom he picks up on the Boardwalk on the
Jersey shore. Then, he impetuously marries the beautiful, bitchy
Blanche (Uma Thurman), a socialite writer searching for
inspiration. Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol, and John Waters
contribute supporting roles, and famed Chinese cinematographer Zhao
Fei (Raise the Red Lantern) makes a memorable American film debut. The
sensational soundtrack includes I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles, Limehouse
Blues, It Don't Mean a Thing, Sweet Sue, All of Me, and I'll See You
in My Dreams, tastefully arranged by pianist Dick Hyman - but,
curiously, not the title song, written by George and Ira Gershwin for
the 1925 musical Tip-Toes. There are more than a dozen guitar solos by
the real-life Django Reinhardt, lifted from his old recordings, while
musician Howard Alden supplies the notes for Sean Penn's realistic
guitar strumming.  On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, Sweet and
Lowdown is a genial, light-hearted, rhythm-filled 8, whimsically
proving that art imitates life.</P>
