<PRE>                               TIME CODE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Sorry, Mr. Lynch, your place at the head of the avant-garde
experimental filmmaker table has been given away.  Messrs. Jarmusch,
Toback, Korine, and Cronenberg, you'll all be eating outside.  Mike
Figgis will be taking over for all of you, and don't come back.</P>
<P>     Figgis, who earned a Best Director Oscar nomination for Leaving Las
Vegas in 1996, appears to have gone a little funny in the head last year
with his inexplicable and nearly dialogue-free The Loss of Sexual
Innocence.  Now he's fully gone off the deep end with what may be the
most ambitious experiment ever: Time Code.</P>
<P>     Now pay attention: Shooting on digital media (and thus avoiding the
limitations of holding 10 minutes of film in a cartridge - the problem
that haunted Hitchcock's Rope), Figgis took four digital cameras,
started them rolling at 3:00 in the afternoon on a November day in 1999,
scripted out a few basic plot points, and let a cast of 20 or 30 actors
do their thing for 90 minutes.  The four cameras follow around various
characters as they improvise their way through an earthquake-torn day in
Hollywood's snooty and provincial movie studio scene, often crossing
paths, and invariably creating heartbreak.  Usually lesbian heartbreak.</P>
<P>     The catch is that the footage from all four cameras is all
displayed at the same time: in four panes on the screen in front of
you.  Watching one Time Code is challenging enough.  Watching four is
serious work.  The reprieve from this catch is that the sound is
typically limited to one pane at a time -- and it's usually the one
where Figgis wants you to look.  As the story unfolds all around town,
the drama shifts from pane to pane so that it's relatively easy to
follow the intersecting tales.</P>
<P>     If Time Code weren't so unique it would be awfully easy to dismiss
the movie for its pretentiousness alone.  At one point near the end of
the film, a Euro filmmaker pitches an assembled cast of movie producers
and executives the very premise of the movie we're watching -- which is
then dismissed as being a pretentious joke!  As if acknowledging the
silliness up front somehow makes it less silly.  Figgis even plans to
attend select screenings and mix the soundtrack -- live -- for the
audience like a DJ.  Oh-kaayyyyyy....</P>
<P>     Despite its quirks, Time Code is actually mostly enjoyable, and you
quickly get used to the gimmick of the four panes.  The acting is good,
especially for improv work under duress, and the story is about what
you'd expect.  While I'm quite sure I'll soon be ready for good-old
single-pane films, I'm certain Time Code is something that will stick
with me for awhile.</P>
