<P>LIVE FLESH is as lurid and sensual as you'd expect, with a title like 
that.  It's a sultry melodrama populated by larger-than-life people, 
brought together by a series of far-fetched coincidences.  It is 
preposterous and outrageous, but by the time the final credits roll, 
you've actually come to care about these peculiar people and their 
mixed-up lives.  Pedro Almodóvar takes sensational material and, 
through a tricky artistic balancing act, manages to keep it both 
touching and wildly implausible, without ever becoming too sappy or 
too silly.</P>
<P>It is a tale of five criss-crossed lovers.  Sancho (José Sancho), an 
abusive, alcoholic cop, is married to Carla (Àngela Molina), who is 
cheating on him.  Victor (Liberto Rabal) had sex with a stoned Elena 
(Francesca Neri) in a public washroom a week before, and is determined 
that she honour a date she barely remembers agreeing to.  Sancho and 
his partner David (Javier Bardem) are called to Elena's apartment when 
Victor appears there, demanding that she go out on the date with him, 
and is then mortally offended when she tells him that he was a lousy 
lover and she isn't interested in him.  Four of the five characters 
meet, there is a struggle, and a gun is fired.</P>
<P>Fast forward several years.  Victor has just been released from 
prison, ending his sentence for the shooting of David.  David, 
paralyzed from the waist down, has become a wheelchair basketball star 
(this is one of many nice touches that give the movie its quirky 
allure) and is now married to Elena, who is living clean and helping 
deprived children.  Carla is still trapped in her marriage to the 
violent, possessive Sancho, and she begins an affair with Victor.  All 
five will feel the effects of that one gunshot for the rest of their 
lives, and those lives are irrevocably linked.</P>
<P>This plot could have been lifted straight from a weekday afternoon 
soap, with one major distinction: this soap opera is less than two 
hours long, even though it has enough sex and betrayals and reversals 
and confrontations to keep a daytime show running for a year or more.  
In other words, it keeps all the fun stuff, but leaves out the tedious 
exposition.  The atmosphere is fun too.  Almodóvar films Madrid 
lovingly, in bright colours, whether it be a verdant, sun-drenched 
cemetery or a city bus at night where a baby is being delivered.  He 
has an eye for sensuous details: the beads of sweat on lovers' bodies 
and the flash of gunpowder from a gun's muzzle are as important as any 
of the plot twists.  LIVE FLESH shares some of film noir's sensibility 
in the intoxicating way it combines moodiness and melodrama.</P>
<P>But as exuberant and over-the-top as it is, LIVE FLESH is also a 
trenchant examination of sexual politics, and Almodóvar does justice 
to the complexities of desire.  Several of the relationships have a 
sadomasochistic element--be it mental or physical--and, in all of 
them, what is called love is really a welter of guilt, insecurity, 
need, lust, and martyr complexes.  In his own inimitable fashion, the 
flamboyant Spanish director is exploring some murky territory here; he 
could easily get lost, but does not.  It helps that the women are not 
demure and passive, seeking only to please their men, as they so often 
are in American films.  No, here they have their own desires, and are 
not afraid to act on them, or speak about them--as Victor finds out in 
one tender, amusing scene, when Carla explains to him why he has a 
long, long way to go before he can become the Best Lover in the World, 
as he would like to be.</P>
<P>There is something absurdly touching about this hope of Victor's.  
His motivation is simply to prove to Elena--a woman he did not know, 
whom he had sex with only once--that he is not a bad lover.  This 
motivation, which drives the entire film, is the motivation of a hurt, 
insecure adolescent.  And here, I think, is the key to the movie's 
success: all these characters are, on some level, simply confused 
adolescents acting on desires they do not fully understand.  Their 
sometimes humourous, sometimes painful struggles are the struggles we 
have all been through, and you can't help but feel for them.</P>
