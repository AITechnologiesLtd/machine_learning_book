<PRE>My Name is Joe     * * * (out of * * * * )</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Ken Loach.
Cast: Peter Mullan, Louise Goodall.
1999 - 105 minutes
Rated R (for violence and profanity).
Capsule Review, June 25, 1999.</PRE>
<P>In 1998, Peter Mullan won the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival 
for "My Name is Joe," and rightfully so. A serious depiction of a recovering 
alcoholic (Mullan) who, aside from coaching soccer games and working as an 
amateur housepainter, has a life that's going nowhere...that is, until he 
meets the community health worker, Sarah (Louise Goodall). Sarah is a lovely, 
but cautious woman who isn't looking for a relationship but nonetheless is 
charmed by Joe. The plot thickens when one of his soccer novices' life is 
threatened for owing money to a group of drug traffikers, and Joe steps in to 
help by illegally transporting drugs to them, unbeknownst to Sarah. "My Name 
is Joe" is a captivating drama with a second stunning performance from Louise 
Goodall, whose Sarah is not simply the thankless "girlfriend" role, but an 
independent woman with her own thoughts and beliefs. Adding to the film's 
clarity are subtitles to help us Americans get over the extremely heavy 
Scottish accents. The film plays well as both a romance (even if this has 
been overdone) and a portrait of a lonely man coming to terms with the 
mistakes in his life.</P>
