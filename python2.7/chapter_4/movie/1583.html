<PRE>                                THE MIRACLE
                                [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Ken Johnson
                        Copyright 1992 Ken Johnson</PRE>
<PRE>95 min., PG, Drama, 1990
Director: Neil Jordan
Cast: Beverly D'Angelo, Donal McCann, Niall Byrne</PRE>
<P>     Because there is no way I can see to give a summary of the film
without giving away a little of the film, the summary of the film is
right after the spoiler warning.</P>
<P>     THE MIRACLE is a very good film, and I highly recommend going to
see it in the theater or renting it, depending on what is available in
your neighborhood.  It doesn't make a difference in which way you see
the film.  THE MIRACLE has been released on video cassette and is also
still playing in some third run theaters.  On a scale of zero to five, I
give THE MIRACLE a four.   THE MIRACLE is rated PG for adult situations
and explicit language.</P>
<P>     *Contains minor spoilers for THE MIRACLE*</P>
<P>     Teenager McCann sees D'Angelo one day on a beach in his home town.
He falls in love with her, so he tries to get her to go out with him.
She is hesitant because she is his mother, which McCann doesn't know.
D'Angelo can't tell McCann that she is his mother, but doesn't want him
to hate her.</P>
<P>     THE MIRACLE is not trying to be a real somber drama, as the title
might suggest to you.  When I went to see this film, I was really
worried that it was going to be some boring overdramatic film.  It was
part of a double feature and I wanted to see the other film so I figured
that I might as well see both.  I was surprised at how good this film
was.</P>
<P>     The actors and actresses in the film do a great job.  The only
person in the cast that I had previously heard of is Beverly D'Angelo
(who plays Clark's wife in the NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION series).  The
director, Neil Jordan (MONA LISA, WE'RE NO ANGELS), did a great job.  I
have only seen one of his films, HIGH SPIRITS, in the past, which was
not as good as this one.   The script is well written and keeps up
interest through the film, although there are a few slow spots.</P>
