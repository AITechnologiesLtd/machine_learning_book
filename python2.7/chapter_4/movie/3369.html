<PRE>                               BEFORE THE RAIN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Time never dies.
The circle is not round.</PRE>
<P>     BEFORE THE RAIN is a story in three parts: Words, Faces, and
Pictures.  The parts form sort of an Escher print and the movie itself
is somewhat of an enigma.  The movie is from Macedonia and is one of the
academy award nominees for 1994 Best Foreign Film.</P>
<P>     As one who has traveled to Yugoslavia when (1986) it was peaceful
and beautiful and one who even went to the trouble of carefully
learning to speak Serbo-Croatian before the trip, this movie held a
special fascination for me.  Although I went to what is now Serbia,
Croatia, and Slovenia and not Macedonia, the language, scenery, and
people all looked familiar but so tragically sadder.</P>
<P>     The story, written and directed by Milcho Manchevski, tells the
story of a small village in Macedonia where part of it is populated
with Macedonian speaking Orthodox Catholics and part by Albanian
speaking Muslims.  Every boy above the age of puberty carries an Uzi.
Although the village has a deceptively serene look, it is filled with
constant and unrelenting hatred and violence.</P>
<P>     High above the village is a monastery where a young Orthodox monk
(Gregoire Colin) hides a frighten young Albanian girl (Labina
Mitevska).  The concatenation of a house of God to the violent village
provides a strong irony.</P>
<P>     Part of the movie takes place in London where a Pulitzer Prize
winning photo-journalist, played by Rade Serbedzija, wants to go back
to his native Macedonia.  He asks wants his girlfriend and fellow
photographer (Katrin Cartlidge) to leave her husband and go with him to
his homeland to film the civil war there.</P>
<P>     The cinematography is spectacular in the outdoor scenes.  The
editing on the other hand was terrible.  Sometimes, the scenes dragged
along way too long.  More frequently the editing was too choppy and
made the movie had to follow.</P>
<P>     The director had the actors act in a distant almost removed
fashion.  The quote at the first of the review was used as the glue to
link parts of the movie.  Its obtuseness was reflected in the script
where the images of the war were very moving and yet the characters
seemed unreal.  I found the movie as a whole interesting and yet
inaccessible at the same time.</P>
<P>     The movie runs a bit long at 1:55.  It is in Macendonian,
Albanian, and English with English subtitles for the first two.  The
movie is unrated, but would have certainly gotten an R for gory,
graphic, and realistic violence plus a little sex and female nudity.
The violent scenes include people with partially blown off faces and
one of a cat being slowly blown to bits with a machine gun.  I give the
show a mild thumbs up for adults only, and I rate it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
