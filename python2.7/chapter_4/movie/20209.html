<P>The 1950's is an era that has always fascinated me, and so any film that
focuses on such a long forgotten time and place of innocence and sensibility is
one I look forward to. Earlier this year, there was "October Sky," a film
centered on an ambitious boy's dreams of rockets in a West Virginia mining
town. "The Iron Giant" is the latest film set in the 1950's when the Cold War
had just started, and a farm boy befriended a giant metal robot unaware of its
potential harm. </P>
<P>The film begins with an innocent, likable kid named Hogarth Hughes who
desperately wants a pet, but his single mother (Jennifer Aniston) will not
allow it. One day, the antenna at the house fails to work, and Hogarth notices
that something gnawed and bit its way to his house. He searches in the middle
of the woods near the power station and finds a giant metal robot wrestling
with the electrical power lines. The boy is mystified and in awe of this giant
creature - he slowly observes how calm it is and befriends it. Of course, how
can he explain to his mom that his new pet is over twenty stories high? He
tries to hide it in the barn, but it manages to make the other parts of its
body function on their own. In one hectic scene, Hogarth pants and squirms
trying to push the robot's hand out the bathroom window while his mother knocks
on the door. </P>
<P>"The Iron Giant" has a little bit of everything. There are mad generals,
insanely clumsy government agents, lazy beatniks, Mad magazines, disbelieving
townsfolk, Atomic Age training films, junkyards, etc. Just about anything
associated with the 1950's is presented here with no shame (those training
films are hilarious), as well as various rock songs from that period. </P>
<P>"The Iron Giant" also has charm and pathos to spread, and it does it
convincingly with the simple metal giant who is also a weapon sent from the
enemy (possibly the Russians?). It is friendly, jovial, learns how to speak and
eats anything metal, but it can also fire missiles when threatened to defend
itself. The advertising for "The Iron Giant" and the look of the robot
strangely reminded me of the short Nazi animated film shown in "The Rocketeer"
- a combination of shock and terror at the possibility of something threatening
our world during a time of political chaos. </P>
<P>"The Iron Giant" is often preachy, reverential, and its anti-gun message could
not come at a better time (but it could be relatively more subtle than
proclaiming that guns are bad). There are the typical stereotypes and cliches
but in a sense, none of it matters. For an animated film that is as
well-designed and clever as this one, this is entertaining, boisterous, simple
fun thriving on simple pleasures. "The Iron Giant" taps into our dreams of
finding a genuine friend in the form of something extraordinary, and it
delivers.    </P>
