<P>"Go" really earns its "R" rating and I like that. The film 
unapologetically presents amoral characters, recreational drug use, 
marginally-sympathetic dope dealers and young people having sex with 
strangers, along with nudity, violence, gunplay and a car chase that 
actually packs some oomph, all set against a low-rent backdrop of L.A. 
raves and tacky Las Vegas glitz. This "Pulp Fiction Lite" wallows in 
recklessness and, in these oh-so-responsible times, there's something 
perversely refreshing about that.</P>
<P>For his second feature, "Swingers" director Doug Liman, working from 
newcomer John August's screenplay, weaves together three stories that 
spring from a single encounter at a grocery store. After following one 
plotline for roughly 30 minutes, he returns to the initial setting to 
launch into the second tale, then repeats the technique for the third, 
which flows into a conclusion that more or less wraps up all three 
stories. The fragmented, non-linear technique is ambitious and not 
altogether successful, but offers more than enough satisfying moments to 
make up for its weak points. </P>
<P>A big part of the fun in "Go" comes from the film's many surprises, so 
I'll keep the plot description as bare-bones as possible. It begins at a 
Los Angeles grocery, where checkout clerk Ronna (Sarah Polley) spends the 
Christmas holiday season working overtime, trying to earn enough money to 
avoid eviction from her apartment. Reluctantly, she agrees to work a 
shift for Simon (Desmond Askew), so he can vacation in Las Vegas with 
friends. Then soap opera actors Zack and Adam (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) 
show up at the store to buy drugs from Simon. </P>
<P>Plotline A begins when the entrepreneurial Ronna decides to make some 
extra cash by handling the drug deal herself. With two pals in tow, she 
visits Simon's dealer, Todd (Timothy Olyphant), leaving her friend Claire 
(Katie Holmes) as collateral while she conducts the business. Things go 
very wrong, leading her to pursue a risky backup plan at a nearby rave. 
Plotline B follows Simon and his buddies to Las Vegas, where some 
remarkably bad decisions result in a wild, and quite entertaining, chase 
scene. Plotline C chronicles the travails of Zack and Adam when they 
become involved with an extremely intense police officer (William 
Fichtner) and his equally bizarre wife (Jane Krakowski).</P>
<P>Ronna's storyline works primarily because of a hilarious depiction of 
life from the perspective of a kid whacked out on Ecstasy, and the 
considerable talents of Sarah Polley and Timothy Olyphant, two actors 
with wonderfully expressive eyes. Polley, so good in "The Sweet Hereafter,
" is compelling here, managing to look defeated and determined 
simultaneously, and Olyphant proves adroit at blending a menacing stance 
with an off-kilter sexiness. Interestingly, "Dawson Creek's" Katie Holmes,
 the closest thing this film has to a traditionally nice character, is 
also the blandest. </P>
<P>The center story, focusing on the misadventures of Simon and his buddies 
in Las Vegas, provides the juiciest action and biggest laughs. Breckin 
Meyer is a hoot as Tiny, a Caucasian kid trying his damnedest to be black 
("If you were any whiter, you'd be clear," snaps one of his friends), but 
the lion's share of the time is given to Simon and Marcus (Taye Diggs), 
whose trip to the Crazy Horse strip club turns into a riotous flight from 
a vengeful father and son. Director Liman, who dealt with Las Vegas and 
male bonding in "Swingers," seems most comfortable handling this segment, 
effortlessly blending repartee and action scenes. Desmond Askew and Taye 
Diggs make a great comic team, with Simon's skittering impulsiveness and 
Marcus' Tantric efforts at serenity balancing out beautifully. </P>
<P>The third storyline, featuring Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf, suffers by 
comparison. The couple's situation demands that they be nervous, but I 
still found their stammering and furtive glances tiresome. Thankfully, 
William Fichtner and Jane Krakowski are a scream, exuding a deliciously 
ominous forced peppiness during a tense dinner scene with the boys. The 
husband and wife clearly have an agenda beyond sharing Christmas cheer, 
and the payoff is memorable. </P>
<P>Of the countless movies patterned after "Pulp Fiction" (it's hard to 
believe that only five years have passed since Quentin Tarantino turned 
contemporary cinema upside down with that film), "Go" is the best one yet,
 due to Liman's assured direction, coupled with a well-constructed script,
 a generally strong cast, great editing and effective use of music. Is 
the film a triumph of style over substance? Of course, but this genre is 
based on the pursuit of style over everything. Had the characters been 
more substantial, their nihilistic behavior would have been hard to take, 
and in "Go," nastiness and irresponsibility is half the fun.</P>
