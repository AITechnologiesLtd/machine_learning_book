<P>A retrospective movie review by Walter Frith</P>
<P>Oliver Stone's semi-autobiographical account of his own experiences in the
Vietnam War is presented in 1986's 'Platoon'.  When I first saw this film
with a packed audience I was not only entertained, not only informed but I
was astonished at how many people disliked this film all for the wrong
reasons.  Certainly people are entitled to their opinion but more important
than that, 'Platoon' forced movie audiences, politicians, military brass and
society in general to look at an ugly aspect of world history.  A lot of
people don't want to face the many aspects of combat tradgedies associated
with war but Oliver Stone did his part by making a film to which a testament
of thoughtful insight was made to try and prevent history from repeating
itself.  </P>
<P>To depict 'Platoon' as simple war film would be superficial.  It's probably
the best film in at least the last 30 years or more that correctly formulated
the three aspects of quality story telling: man vs. man, man vs. nature, man
vs. himself.  Filmed on an initial 6 million dollar budget and with the
Philippines substituting for Vietnam in location shooting, Stone had a tight
schedule to work with and the results were nothing short of brilliant.  </P>
<P>Charlie Sheen is the film's protagonist, a young man who narrates his
experiences in Vietnam in letters he sends home to his grandmother and we
gain an insight into the men within his platoon.  Tom Berenger plays a no
nonsense, unorthodox and somewhat evil sergeant undoubtedly made a victim of
it all by the insanity of war who tries to shape and mold the men in his
company into fighting without rules, without morals and without comapssion
for anyone, even women and children in a suspicious village they stumble upon
where weapons for the enemy are being stored.  Willem Dafoe plays another
sergeant within the same platoon whose personality is just the opposite of
Berenger's and he butts heads with Berenger's war crime activities and the
two men become at odds with each other with tragic results.</P>
<P>'Platoon' is a smart film that is told with little or no plot but rather a
style uniquely inventive of caring about the characters involved and paying
tribute to the men who fought and died in the Vietnam War and Stone dedicates
the film to them in the movie's closing credits.  Filled with explosive
scenes of combat including a vicious climax which may force some to cover
their eyes and with a cast of ordinary characters of all different
personalities and habits, Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' is a lacerating indictment
of a confict fought and which makes people debate the real purpose of the
Vietnam War.  One of the greatest films in the history of cinema and a war
film like no other.       </P>
