<P>The words "not bad" have never summed up a movie so well. Then again, the
words "not that great" also apply here. ALWAYS, Steven Spielberg's film to top
off the 1980's, is quite the example. The cinematography, acting, and even the
overall idea isn't too bad, but this movie is still nothing to get excited
over. Mostly, it's just a semi-decent rental when you've already seen
everything else.</P>
<P>ALWAYS is a remake of the 1943 film A GUY NAMED JOE, a supposed favorite of
Mr. Spielberg himself. Richard Dreyfuss stars as Pete, a pilot with a passion
for fighting forest fires - a passion so intense, it leads to frivolous stunts
and in-the-air horseplay, much to the dismay of Pete's pilot girlfriend,
Dorinda (Holly Hunter). Dorinda has had enough high anxiety and, professing
her love, convinces Pete to finally settle down and take a teaching position
in a small Colorado town. But before he quits the job he loves so much, Pete
finds himself fighting one last forest fire, but this time he doesn't come
back.</P>
<P>The excessive foreshadowing doesn't allow for any real surprise at Pete's
"sudden" death. In fact, it takes too long trying to create a heavy fairy-tale
atmosphere and romance before it gets to this point. When Pete does get to the
other side however, he is welcomed by an angel named Hap (Audrey Hepburn - now
we know how she's spending her afterlife). Hap tells Pete he must go back and
help a young hopeful named Ted Baker (Brad Johnson) succeed as a fire-fighter
pilot. As obvious as it is to the audience, Pete doesn't realize he is
actually helping Ted find Dorinda, and therefore find true love. For this to
take place however, both Pete and Dorinda need to get on with their life (or
afterlife), something they don't seem to want to do.</P>
<P>John Goodman has a role as Pete's pre-death best friend Al. In fact, it was
Al's life Pete was saving when he was killed, a less-than-affective attempt at
turning the protagonist's death into a touchy piece of heroism. Al's role in
the film is a bit undefined, and it's very hard to tell the importance, if
there is any, of his character. When the film ends, there is still no answer.</P>
<P>It's obvious this film is aching to be a magical "make you laugh, make you
cry" experience, but instead, it comes off rather corny. It's a sad failure in
excellence, especially when it's so obvious Spielberg (and even Dreyfuss)
really want it to work. You can sense their dedication to the project, but
dedication or no, the gas tank was empty, and ALWAYS just couldn't get going.
It was also quite forgettable, and I'm already finding it difficult to
remember what happened outside the basic plotline. Flat, unimpressive
characters haven't left anything to chew on either.</P>
<P>ALWAYS gets a simple * * for being a bearable two hours of boredom. Watching
airplanes take off at the airport is cheaper and perhaps a bit more exciting,
but if you're just looking for a cure to insomnia that won't upset your
stomach, this could be the answer.</P>
