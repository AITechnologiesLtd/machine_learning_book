<P>Georges Polti once wrote a paper called "The Thirty-Six Dramatic
Situations," in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be
defined by no more than thirty-six different situations. This may be the
modern restatement of the Biblical prophecy from Ecclesiastes, "There's
nothing new under the sun." THE FACULTY, the latest movie by FROM DUSK
TILL DAWN director Robert Rodriguez, certainly proves this in typical
Hollywood fashion. There's not a measureable fraction of original
material in this unworthy outing. </P>
<P>Drawing elements from both THE PUPPET MASTERS and INVASION OF THE BODY
SNATCHERS, screenwriter Kevin Williamson (of SCREAM 2 credit) gives us a
horror tale set in middle America (Ohio) one eventful fall. Making use
of a cast of unusually stock characters, Williamson designs an alien
invasion that will not be done INDEPENDENCE DAY-style but rather
"through the back door." Parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a
run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body,
leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day. </P>
<P>The lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block. Even though the
genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this, they've
been saved by an energetic approach. This casts more than a shadow of a
doubt on Williamson's ability, who enjoyed success with the Wes
Craven-directed SCREAM but couldn't pull anything solid in for this
outing or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Although he designs THE
FACULTY with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture, it
still comes down to the same results: throw the stock characters in a
steel cage match and see who comes out alive. </P>
<P>On that level, the main roles are played by virtual unknowns. Only the
recognizeable Elijah Wood (DEEP IMPACT) is at the front; other than
that, the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien
teachers. Perhaps Williamson has it in mind to champion these
up-and-comers to the fame that their SCREAM and LAST SUMMER counterparts
achieved; but to do that, they'd all need to star in their own WB
television show about the horrors of puberty a la "Dawson's Creek."
Needless to say the acting is far from top notch, nor does necessity ask
that it should be. There is a moment or two of genuine horror, but
unfortunately Williamson and Rodriguez did not take the story far enough
in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it. In sum, THE FACULTY was
just one long shot that did not pay off. </P>
