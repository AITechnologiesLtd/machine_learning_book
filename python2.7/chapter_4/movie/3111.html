<P>     "To make a film is always an adventure and a defiance.  I DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT is the riskiest of my films and also the one that
taught me the most about myself....  Charlotte is a metaphor for all of
us who are in one way or another different from the flock.  In that
sense ... she could be any independent spirit."
     - Maria Luisa Bemberg, director of I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT</P>
<P>     There are many ways to deal with a child's disability.  The least
practical, and probably the most immature, is to deny that it exists,
eradicate all reminders of it, and refuse to allow anyone to mention
it.  Which is exactly how Dona Leonor (Luisina Brando) reacts when she
realizes that her daughter Charlotte (Alejandra Podesta) is a dwarf.
Not only does she place the entire town of San Jose de los Altares
under a gag rule, but she takes a pick ax to some local stone gnomes
and burns copies of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, SNOW WHITE, and TOM THUMB.</P>
<P>     How to classify I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT is something of a
mystery.  The story is structured as a fractured fable, but contains
elements of comedy, melodrama, and tragedy.  Those determined to
pigeonhole this movie into a specific genre are likely to be
confounded; I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT isn't conventional enough for
that sort of generic identification.</P>
<P>     Everyone in the 1930s Argentinean community has their own vision
of Charlotte.  Her mother does everything she can to build the girl up
and have her lead a "normal" life, including allowing what might at
other times be considered a shockingly inappropriate marriage.
Ludovico D'Andrea (Marcello Mastroianni), a local playboy with a
fondness for collecting small things (he has a miniature pony and a
tiny monkey) falls in love with her, in part because of her stature.
Charlotte, on the other hand, is a very pragmatic young woman who
doesn't mind acknowledging her shortcomings.</P>
<P>     Even at its most poignant, the tone of I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
IT remains playful and romantic.  The budding relationship between
Ludovico and Charlotte, which could easily have turned into something
satirical or uncomfortable, is handled with restraint and sensitivity.
Incidents of frequently funny, offbeat humor are included to keep the
audience off-balance.  I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT is nothing if not
unusual.</P>
<P>     The trio of lead performers--the charismatic Mastroianni, the
sultry Brando, and the charming Podesta--cement this movie in a solid
foundation.  These three handle every turn given to them by the script,
and make even the most bizarre situations believable.  Cinematographer
Felix Monti chooses his shots effectively, suggesting a sense of magic-
realism (the scenes outside on the benighted streets of San Jose de los
Altares, photographed through a blue lens, are stunning).</P>
<P>     I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT has a lot of heart, and that's why
its themes come across so clearly.  As director Bemberg has admitted,
this is not a story to be viewed from a logical perspective.  Its
mystical quality makes it a fairytale for adults, complete with a moral
that each individual can interpret as it applies to him- or herself.</P>
