<P> Analyze This (1999) 1 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Robert De Niro, Billy
Crystal and Lisa Kudrow. Directed by Harold Ramis.</P>
<P> The key to comedy is pacing and timing.</P>
<P> And the creators of "Analyze This" need to have their watches repaired.</P>
<P> "Analyze This" is slow, uneven and only intermittently humorous.</P>
<P> The movie is unoriginal, predictable and cliche-bound. Worse, you can see
the actors working at trying to be funny.</P>
<P> Robert De Niro plays Paul Vitti, a powerful New York mobster who is having
a mental crisis. He's under a lot of stress. His best friend has just been
killed and he has to prepare for a big meeting of all the mob bosses from
across the country.</P>
<P> Billy Crystal is Dr. Ben Sobel, a suburban shrink with a comfortable
practice, a smart-aleck son and an insecure fiancé.</P>
<P> Fate takes a hand when Vitti's and Sobel's worlds collide - literally.
Before you can say "GoodFellas," Vitti is unburdening himself to Sobel,
much to the uptight doctor's dismay.</P>
<P> Vitti cannot take "no" for an answer, even though Sobel continually tries
to discourage him from becoming a patient.</P>
<P> The comic possibilities of such a plot are unfulfilled in "Analyze This."
It's flat and slow.</P>
<P> Unlike the new HBO series, "The Sopranos," which is an expanded version of
the same premise - conflicted mobster unloads his psychic garbage on a
sympathetic shrink - "Analyze Thi"s cannot sustain or take advantage of the
possibilities of such a situation.</P>
<P> De Niro and Crystal seem lost, as if they cannot get a firm grasp on their
characters. Crystal mostly frowns or looks scared, while De Niro does a lot
of cursing, finger pointing and crying.</P>
<P> And lovely Lisa Kudrow is wasted in the thankless role of Crystal's
frustrated fiance.</P>
<P> The only time the movie seems to come alive is when Sobel fills in as
Vitti's representative at the big meeting and begins transforming it into a
giant therapy session.</P>
<P> Other than that, "Analyze This" just plods along, hoping that the
personality of its stars will carry the weight. Unfortunately, there is no
strong script to bolster them.</P>
<P> "Analyze This" is a major disappointment, unworthy of the talents of its
two stars.</P>
