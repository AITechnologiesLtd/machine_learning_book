<P>Chad'z rating: ** (out of 4 = fair/below average)</P>
<P>1997, R, 108 minutes [1 hour, 48 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[science fiction/thriller]</PRE>
<P>starring: Sigourney Weaver (Ripley), Winona Ryder (Call), Ron Perlman
(Johner), Gary Dourdan (Christie); written by Joss Whedon; produced by Bill
Badalato, Gordon Carroll, David Giler, Walter Hill; directed by Jean-Pierre
Jeunet; based on characters created by Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett.</P>
<P>Seen December 1, 1997 at 7:20 p.m. at The Glenwood Movieplex Cinemas (Oneida,
NY), theater #2, by myself for free (free pass). [Theater rating: ***: good
seats, sound, and picture]</P>
<P>        If there's anything I learned about the "Alien" series, it's the fact it
epitomizes the term "The more things change, the more they stay the same."
Each film has a unique direction to it, yet the stories and individual
elements are basically the same. But what's most annoying about "Alien:
Resurrection," besides the fact it repeats absolutely everything we've seen
before, is it doesn't even try to have any direction or originality.</P>
<P>        Describing the plots and the way they are set up in these films is beginning
to become an exercise in futility, and I wouldn't doubt the screenwriters
feel the same way writing them. Much like the previous sequels, there's a lot
of jargon and rhetoric here to explain how Ripley (Weaver) will end up facing
the aliens even though everything was fine when we last saw her. This time
it's 200 years after the death of her original self, and scientists have
created a clone of her (why did they wait so long?). How they did this isn't
clearly explained, but we are knocked over the head with the fact she has
memories and was slightly crossbred with alien DNA (which explains her
super-strength and psychic abilities).</P>
<P>        We get more variations on the same plot such as the arrogant scientists and
leaders who try to study, breed, and exploit the aliens but something goes
wrong and chaos ensues. There's also a militia brat pack, although this time
they're pirates instead of miners, marines, or prisoners. Much like Ripley,
they're also re-incarnated characters. First there's Johner (Perlman), the
wise-cracking tough guy; then Call (Ryder), the smart, rational,
strong-willed woman; Christie (Dourdan), the special weapons guy; along with
a cripple in a high-tech wheelchair, a frail woman, and the suave leader.
Most of these characters will die just as we're beginning to like them, and
one of them will turn out to be a robot (deja vu!).</P>
<P>        The storytelling here is so choppy we don't really get establishment of
plot, but a collection of remotely related scenes, such as the scientist
driven mad with curiosity studying the aliens, or the meeting between the
pirate leader  and the corrupt military leader which somehow explains why the
pirates are on board the huge military vessel the film takes place in.</P>
<P>        Of course the aliens break free from their cages and run rampant around the
ship, killing many of the humans and giving the pirates something to run from
and shoot at. And if that wasn't generic enough, I counted at least six times
in which the music built up with violins screeching and then an alien popping
out the shadows and killing someone. There's also an interesting scene (the
only one for that matter) that takes place underwater, but somehow the humans
manage to hold their breath for five or ten minutes!</P>
<P>        Most of the film recycles and even rips-off elements from the other films
that didn't work that well to begin with. We get dizzying action sequences
with fire and bullets flying all over the place, corny one-liners, guns jam
up at the last second, and people apparently dead come back to life. The faux
Gothic atmosphere with lots of shadows, strobe lights, and steam all over the
place is also tiring. The aliens themselves are now such cartoony embodiments
of evil it's hard not to laugh at them, much less be frightened by them.</P>
<P>        The "Alien" films are meant to be intense, sci-fi thrillers and there's no
doubt that's what "Alein: Resurrection" is too, and I don't object to that
principle. What I do object to is how the film constantly tries harder to be
intense, but the more it does so, the sillier it seems.</P>
