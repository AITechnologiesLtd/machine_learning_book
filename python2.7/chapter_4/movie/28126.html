<P>THE TASTE OF OTHERS (Les Goutes des Autres)<HR></P>
<P>Have you ever misjudged someone, treated them badly, then felt horrible 
about it?  This and other aspects of the human condition are explored
in cowriter/director/star Agnes Jaoui's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar
nominee "The Taste of Others."</P>
<P>The film begins by following the seemingly unrelated conversations of two
tables of diners.  Castella (cowriter Jean-Pierre Bacri, "Place Vendome") is 
a businessman attempting to sneak a sweet past his controlling wife Angelique
(Christiane Millet) while also carrying on a business lunch.  At another
table, storytelling Franck (Gerard Lanvin) and literal Bruno (Alain Chabat, 
"French Twist") appear to have little in common until we learn that Franck
is Castella's bodyguard and Bruno his driver.</P>
<P>Castella interviews Clara (Anne Alvaro, "Danton") as an English teacher, but
dismisses her when she doesn't produce a fun technique.  Later, when he's
dragged to a stage production of Berenice by his wife (his niece has a small
part in the production), Castella is entranced by Clara in the lead role and
begins to ardently pursue her, much to her dismay (she needs his English lesson
money, but finds him boorish and uneducated).  Meanwhile Bruno encounters Manie
(Agnes Jaoui) tending the bar at a cafe and she informs him they once slept
together.  While they aren't successful rekindling the former flame (Bruno
can't believe he didn't remember while Manie can't believe she did), Manie
begins a relationship with Franck.  Manie's also buddies with Clara and 
the rest of the theatrical troupe customers, closing the circle of the main
cast.  A subplot, where Angelique forces her interior decorating skills
upon her sister-in-law Beatrice (Brigitte Catillon, "Artemisia"), most
literally conveys the film's title.</P>
<P>This warm, funny, all too human story is about how people's myopia can lead
them astray in their search for happiness.  It's an assured, typically French
(conversation heavy) piece of work by Jaoui and her costar Bacri.  Jaoui gets
top notch work from her entire cast.  (Oddly, the central characters all
resemble American stars with Jaoui herself looking like "Ally McBeal's"
Courtney Thorne-Smith, Bacri like "L.A. Law's" Alan Rachins, Clara like
Lily Tomlin and Bruno like Peter Riegart.)  The film is beautifully editted
(Herve de Luze), sometimes for comic effect (Flucky, Angelique's puffball
little dog who 'always bites for a good reason,' gambolling about) or to
jump across time while one character glides from one encounter to the next.</P>
<P>"The Taste of Others" is both heartbreaking and hopeful.  Alvara's final smile
is like something out of a constellation while Bruno's mysterious, solitary
flute playing is given satisfying closure for both the character and the film.
Small moments, even when anticipated (Castella placing his newly purchased
modern painting amidst his wife's flowery, fluffy decor), bring large payoffs.
"The Taste of Others" is a real treat.</P>
