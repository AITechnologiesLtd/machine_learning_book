<PRE>                       SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                        1 :-)  for the ice maiden</PRE>
<P>When I first heard that Smilla had a sense of snow, I was expecting her
to climb Mt Everest. She doesn't. Instead this ice maiden spits liquid
nitrogen with a vengeance and shoots icicles from her arse. She is one
seriously, emotionally frozen lass who is perpetually on the edge of the
toilet seat. What is Smilla's problem? Her Icelandic mother died when
she was six depriving her of the comfort of breast milk. Her Anglo-Saxon
father whisks her away to the confines of Denmark, away from the open
spaces of Greenland. She then competes with her father's bimbette
mistress for his love, before she befriends a deaf Icelandic boy who
gets pushed off the roof of her apartment blocks. So it's not surprising
that Smilla (Julia Ormond) gets pretty pissed off when her only friend
gets killed. The reclusive, bitter Smilla shouts foul play, not because
she has a feeling for snow, but because she's got a feeling it's murder.</P>
<P>The story then revolves around bizarre meteorites and ancient parasitic
worms, which is all fantastically unbelievable. These elements serve as
a mere distraction to the far more interesting Smilla on which the story
is based. This woman who bites, fights, spits to get her way makes an
interesting character, but she is also confused, frightened and fragile
making her a bit of an enigma. If only this movie carried more romance
than mere mystery and suspense, then perhaps Gabrielle Byrne would not
have been wasted as a male body. He gets to bed Smilla and temporarily
defrosts the ice maiden, but that's as interesting as his character
gets. Annoyingly, he is so mysterious that he can't make up his mind
whether he wants to be a good guy or bad guy – leaving the audience with
little hope of figuring him out.</P>
<P>This movie has an interesting feel to it that one finds hard to put into
words, except to say that one gets a good sense of frost when Smilla's
around. Although it scores poorly in the department of plot conclusion,
it redeems itself in creating a character as memorable as Smilla.</P>
