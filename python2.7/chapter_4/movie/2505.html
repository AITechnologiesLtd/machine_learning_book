<PRE>                                THREESOME
                           A film review by Tak
                        Copyright 1994 Mark Takacs</PRE>
<P>TriStar Pictures /rated R
Starring:   Lara Flynn Boyle        Stephen Baldwin            Josh Charles
Classification: Romantic Comedy
Tak Rating: see it several times - full and/or matinee</P>
<P>One-Line-Summary
----------------
    A non-traditional love-triangle where no one's lust is reciprocated.</P>
<P>Tak Plot Summary
----------------
     Things heat up when Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) is mistaken for a male
by the college bureaucracy and placed with Eddie (Josh Charles) and
Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) in a college dorm room.  Alex soon develops a
huge lust for Eddie, Eddie would rather not get involved, and Stuart is
really hot for Alex.  The rest of the movie is about trying to sort out
these feelings and the situations that arise.</P>
<P>Tak Thoughts ** minor spoilers -- revealed in first 20 mins ** 
------------
     THREESOME opens with a definition of "deviant" that goes much like
this: 1) to stray, esp. from a standard, or principle.  2) to depart
from an established course or norm.  Eddie narrates, and says "... this
is the story of a time in our lives where we traveled the less traveled
path and, for a brief while, became deviants."</P>
<P>     When you look at the thick of things, it seems far from the norm,
but it's not such a stretch.  Each step down the so-called deviant
lifestyle makes sense as it's taken.  It's only after you've traveled
for awhile that you realize how far from normal you've gone.</P>
<P>     Anyone into combinations and permutations?  Well, THREESOME would
make an interesting story problem.  If you had three people, Alex,
Stuart, and Eddie; all of whom wanted to sleep with one of the others,
but the person they wanted didn't want them.  List all the possible
combinations of partners and their directed lust, indicated by a
directed arrow. ---> Find the solution with the most fulfilled lust.</P>
<PRE>    Ok, start by writing down what you know.</PRE>
<PRE>given:        Alex-->Eddie            Eddie-->Stuart          Stuart-->Alex        </PRE>
<P>     That's a lust of 3, but that's the given.  So let's list all the
other combos, including leftovers.</P>
<PRE>*rate*        *Relationships*                           *Leftovers*
  0         null                                       Alex, Eddie, Stuart
  2          Alex<-->Eddie                           Stuart
  2          Eddie<-->Stuart                         Alex
  2          Stuart<-->Alex                          Eddie
  3          Alex-->Eddie-->Stuart-->            null        (given)
  6          +-Alex<--->Stuart<--->Eddie-+             null
            +------------><-------------+</PRE>
<P>     The numbers say everyone should sleep with everyone, right?
Right.  But that's too easy.  And it just doesn't work.  Mostly because
the two guys have a problem with taking certain partners.  Though it's
not with each other, as Eddie is gay.  Eddie won't do Alex (except for
a trial run), and Stuart won't do Eddie (though he makes certain
concessions).  So they really have to find some solution that everyone
is comfortable with.</P>
<P>     They really try.  They try out all the combinations listed above.
They even bring in "outsiders" for the left out person in the couples
experiments.  These just don't work.  They're only really happy when
they're all together.  Then some sort of magic happens, where they can
all believe they're getting what they want.</P>
<P>     THREESOME could be seen as a glorification of an immoral
lifestyle.  This is certainly acknowledged, as the threesome become
quite the scandal at their dorm.  I certainly wouldn't condemn them.
It fact, I'm envious.  They look like they're having so much fun.  I
know there've been times in my life ... well ... :-)</P>
<P>     My favorite scene is a road trip where they abduct an garden
gnome, frolic in a rental convertible, and end up at a swimming hole.
Fun, tense, and delightful to watch.  Oh, and there's the "scary, hairy
Larry" scene.  There's lots more.</P>
<P>     I've spent more time than usual talking about the storyline.  I
think that's pretty high praise, actually.  I didn't have any problems
with any of the mechanics of the movie (actors, direction, etc) getting
in the way of me being totally immersed in the story.  Bravo.</P>
<P>Tak Rating:
-----------
     I liked THREESOME.  Strict adherence to wholesome-ness can be so
restricting at times.  Check it out--let yourself think about what it
might be like to be a deviant.  Who knows? If you're lucky, maybe
THREESOME will set you off on your own deviant path.</P>
<PRE>   avoid at all costs            see several times (w/friends) as matinee
   wait for videotape            see once at full price
   watch it on cable          X see it several times - full and/or matinee
   see once as a matinee    see many times at full price
