<PRE>                                       BLINK
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Michael Apted
Written by Dana Stevens
Starring Madeleine Stowe and Aidan Quinn</PRE>
<P>     BLINK is the latest in a long line of Flawed Hollywood Thrillers.
The plot is formula--a psycho stalks an attractive woman who's
protected by a cop who's sleeping with the target--but good humor, a
good cast, and a couple neat twists provide the real thrills in this
"thriller."</P>
<P>     Once again, distress duties fall upon Madeline Stowe, who was last
seen resisting "Unlawful Entry." This time, Stowe plays
sightless-since-seven Emma Brody, a folk-band violinist who's awaiting
a corneal transplant.</P>
<P>     When the eyes are finally upon her, Emma has problems with her
newfound vision--one of which is what her doctor calls a "perceptual
delay."  That is, there's a delay between her eyes and her brain.  What
she sees can, sometimes, take over a day to appear in her head.</P>
<P>     Of course, poor Emma also suffers from flashbacks and blurry
vision.  So, when she catches a glimpse of a passing serial killer,
neither she nor the police completely believe her eyes....</P>
<P>     Despite the odd ocular angle, BLINK is a formula film at heart and
has the cliches to prove it.  There's the cautious-of-commitment cop
(Quinn), the cop's hard-nosed boss (Young), and the cop's rival, the
maybe-too-friendly doctor (Friedman).</P>
<P>     Throw in some psychological mumbo-jumbo and you have the perfect
recipe for disaster.</P>
<P>     This stew would probably sour in the hands of lesser talent.  But
with a Respectable Director (Michael Apted) behind the boards, BLINK
rarely sinks as low as the subject matter suggests.  Sure, there are a
couple of Awful Moments--including a hideous POV shift to that of the
killer's--but the bulk of BLINK is easy on the eyes (and brain).</P>
<P>     Most of the interesting stuff happens in the first half, when the
script promises more than it could ever hope to deliver.</P>
<P>     You get great flourishes like Quinn's character quoting Longfellow
to get gals.  Or Emma's flashbacks of her mother, who blinded her in a
fit of rage.  Or the crowning moment of questionable ethics, when
Quinn's boss tells him to, simply, "sleep with her and get it over
with."</P>
<PRE>     (Though he MAY have used a different verb choice in said sentence.
-:)</PRE>
<P>     BLINK is also an unusually funny film.  A jovial bunch of
detectives provides gallows humor by the yard.  And a couple hilarious
herrings, of the red variety, are netted at key points late in the
film.</P>
<P>     There are other reasons not to blink at BLINK. The cast is
attractive, the locales (in Chicago) are great, and Stowe makes a
refreshingly strong heroine.  But when the plot passes the point of
oversaturation, somewhere in the last half-hour, BLINK drags like the
best of them.</P>
<P>     The director side-steps this problem, however, by simply slapping
on the suspense.  As any Bad Movie Fan knows, shameless manipulation
works wonders in the absence of a polished script.</P>
<PRE>     See Stowe stalked.  See Stowe scream.  See her eating ice cream.</PRE>
<P>     To the victor belongs the spoils and BLINK does reward the patient
viewer with a slightly surprise ending.  And, in a moment of unbridled
audacity that's worth the price of matinee admission alone, Apted even
allows a visit from Norman Bates' mother.</P>
<PRE>     All this and three love-scenes to boot!</PRE>
<PRE>Bottom line:  The formula remains the same in BLINK, a Flawed Thriller
              about a woman who regains her sight, only to see a killer.
              Good humor, a good cast, and a couple neat twists are the
              real thrills in this better-than-passable potboiler.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B
