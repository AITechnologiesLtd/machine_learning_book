<P>                              AIR FORCE ONE
                     A film review by George McAdams
                      Copyright 1997 George McAdams
Return to your (movie) seats!  Fasten your seatbelts and restore your
seat backs to their full upright position because the summer's best
action/drama movie is here, and its title is "Air Force One." Harrison
Ford stars in this must-see movie as James Marshall, the President of
the United States whose "The United States doesn't negotiate with
terrorists" philosophy is challenged when Air Force One is hijacked
while in route from Moscow to the U.S. Ford, playing the president in a
manner that probably has President Clinton dreaming with a smile on his
face, has the situation further complicated when his wife and daughter
are part of the hostages.</P>
<P>Yes, you can put behind you painful memories of "Batman and Robin," and
you can just forget all the other weak plots devices of other
presidential dramas, such as "Murder at 1600" because Harrison Ford
gives the best performance as a president since Ronald Reagan's.</P>
<P>And while other performers fill the screen, none rises to the top like
Air Force One the plane. In the proud tradition of
mechanical devices having greater fortitude over man, the plane shows
that it can take a licking a keep on ticking, right to the
very end. Gary Oldman neither disappoints or overplays the part as the
lead hijacker sympathetic to a splinter-group of Russians who want to
reverse the results of an open market economy: gangsters, prostitutes,
and poverty.</P>
<P>One cannot help but feel that Director Wolfgang Peterson has pulled
together his memories of two other previous directorial
efforts, "Das Boot" and "In the Line of Fire," to give the viewers a
movie that flies through two hours of turbulence with such a rush that
viewers will want to take a return flight.</P>
<P>One interesting note about the film was the interesting way that two
dramatic situations were handled. In the first, President
Marshall has faxed to the White House Conference Room instructions to
have Air Force One reduce its speed and lower its
altitude while refueling. As the viewers watch the faxed document rest
at the White House unbeknownst to everyone around it, the hostages
prepare to parachute from Air Force One, hoping that the message will
have gotten through. On one hand, this
gives the appearance that the producers wanted to cut some time from the
movie; however, thinking about this some more, I
find that I liked it because its about time a movie doesn't show me
everything. In a second sequence near the end of the movie,
the release of a militant general is imminent and viewers are left
wondering if his release will be stopped.</P>
<P>"Air Force One" gets three and one-half stars out of four from me. I'd
recommend it to others and wouldn't hesitate to see it
again.</P>
