<PRE>                               A FAMILY THING
                       A film review by John Schuurman
                        Copyright 1996 John Schuurman</PRE>
<P>     Alright, there is one mighty stretch of credulity that we viewers
must make if we are to become fully engaged with this movie. The film
asks a lot in this one regard but once the concession is made we are
pleased we have made it and congratulations are in order. If we can do
this -- suspend our native skepticism -- this fine film and America's
two best actors take over and provide a wonderful encounter with that
which is best in the human condition.</P>
<P>     OK, here is what you have to get around: Robert Duvall and James
Earl Jones as biological half-brothers. Of course, not in a million
years. So we all agree. But then we can get back to the movie.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in modern day America. It is a simple story
and one gives nothing away by telling some of it. Earl Pilcher (Duvall)
a deeply Southern man from a thoroughly Southern place learns that
though he was brought up white and though he looks white and acts
white, he is in fact half black.  It seems that his biological father
forced sexual relations on a black woman who worked for the family.
The woman became pregnant and died while giving birth to little Earl.
The child is light skinned and is then brought up in his father's home
under the ruse of being the natural son of two white parents.</P>
<P>     The movie begins with Earl being told the truth about his origins
and composition. He is also made aware that there is a brother, a
half-brother named Ray Murdock (Jones), a policeman who lives in
Chicago.  The rest of the film is a dance between these two -- a
sometimes painful, often angry, deeply touching, frequently humorous
dance -- through the minefield of contemporary race relations.</P>
<P>     The partners, Earl and Ray, move across the screen toward each
other. Carrying all the baggage of their respective cultures, they are
wary and suspicious, even hateful at the outset. But the music of --
biology? duty? decency? -- slowly draws them towards one another and
they become friends and at the end of the dance, we think they find the
special love *phileo* of brothers.</P>
<P>     Assisting them, (and arguably the music personified), is  blind
Aunt T. in an inspired performance by Chicago stage actress Irma P.
Hall. Go see this movie just for Aunt T. She steals the show. Since she
can't see, she tells us that she no longer "has the benefit of being
able to judge between people on the way they look." But blind Aunt T.
is the catalyst that brings the best out of her two reluctant dancers.</P>
<P>     As I watched, I was at once frightened and hopeful for the rest of
us. If a suspension of disbelief is necessary to view Duvall and Jones
as half-brothers, no such act is asked of us to believe that we are in
a terrible and frightening crisis of racism in America. Self-evident
though that is, this film made my heart quake over the vastness of the
gulf between cultures.</P>
<P>     And yet, here we saw one relationship in which healing occured. It
was just one, (and the movie is not silly or so naive as to suggest
that something so vast and unwieldly as the contemporary racial gulf is
fixable), but it was one sign that there IS something better than
racial divide. Such relationships can happen and as a sign, this was
for the moment -- enough.</P>
