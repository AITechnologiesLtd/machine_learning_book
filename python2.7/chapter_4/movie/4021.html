<PRE>                                    ANGUS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Bring together big stars George C. Scott, Rita Moreno, and Kathy
Bates to do a feature film and what do you get?  A movie about a
teenager named Angus, "the fat kid who's good at science and fair at
football" and who just wants to be accepted.  What else would you
expect?</P>
<P>     While not really a "kids' movie," ANGUS is a workmanlike
coming-of-age film, full of slapstick and insult trading among the
youthful cast and their parents.  Angus is played by newcomer Charlie
Talbert (who was discovered in a Wendy's restaurant).  Bates plays Mom,
and Scott is Grandpa.  With the help of his nerdy friend Troy (Chris
Owen), Angus chases after local beauty Melissa (JURASSIC PARK's Ariana
Richards) and overcomes the obstacles placed before him by the
requisite jock-bullies who are threatened by his being different.</P>
<P>     A heavily tested formula, to say the least.  The predictability of
ANGUS is mind-numbing, but thankfully it's pretty funny along the way,
especially Scott's crusty grandfather (note that the humor may not be
totally suitable for children).  But don't expect a lot of touching
dialogue or an even remotely believable romance between Angus and
Melissa; instead, between the jokes, just sit back and listen to 20 or
30 of your favorite pop hits, one after another.</P>
<P>     In the end, the movie is humdrum, marginal eye candy--made of pure
saccharine.  Take it or leave it, it's completely harmless and as
filling as a packet of Sweet N Low.</P>
