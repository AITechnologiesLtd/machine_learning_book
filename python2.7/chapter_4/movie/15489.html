<PRE>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Marilyn Burns; Allen Danziger; Paul A. Partain & William Vail</P>
<P>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the original slasher films. Unlike the
current crop of slasher films, like Scream -- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is
a little more low budget. Actually, that is an understatement. Chainsaw
Massacre makes the original Halloween look as if it was shot on a budget the
size of Titanic. This is one cheesy movie. Cheesy camera shots, cheesy
locations and even cheezyer (is that a word?) acting, if you can even call
it acting. Even with that all said, Chainsaw Massacre wasn't as bad as I
though it was going to turn out to be. I'm not sure whether it was the fact
that I appreciated that it was one of the original classic slasher horror
films, or if it was the fact that it was just so bad that it was almost
good. Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter.</P>
<P>Chainsaw Massacre focuses on a group of teenagers out for a drive who go to
explore an abandoned property owned by one of their parents. In the true
tradition of horror films, this turns out to be a mistake. It turns out that
this old house has some neighbors nearby who aren't that friendly. Among
them is a kindly gent named Leatherface who has a tendency to cut people up
with a chainsaw. Never an endearing quality in a neighbor. Anyway, you can
undoubtedly figure out from the title of the film what good old Leatherface
ends up doing to these poor unsuspecting teenagers.</P>
<P>As I said, the acting, writing, camera work and just about everything else
you can think of is so low budget that a kid with a camcorder could almost
have done a better job. But that is sort of the sick charm of this little
film. Although, Scream it is not. If you are interested in watching Chainsaw
Massacre for nonstop terror, keep right on going past this title in the
video store. On the other hand, if you are looking for a few laughs (albeit
unintentional) and a kind of historical perspective on the genre, give
Chainsaw Massacre a look. At the very least you will appreciate just how far
these films have come over the years.</P>
