<P>Helena Bonham Carter either has a pact with the devil or some very good
friends in the makeup business, as she's been playing the same
role--passionate impetuous girl defies societal mores-- for more than a
decade now. "Room with a View" was, if I remember correctly, 1985, and the
intervening years have featured her in "Howards End", "Enchanted April,"
and the Zeffirelli "Hamlet" as a rather assertive Ophelia, among others.
Though her character is inevitably in her late teens or early twenties,
she didn't seem young for the part when she started, and certainly doesn't
seem too old to play the central character in Iain Softley's "Wings of the
Dove," recently released. Perhaps more importantly, she gives each role
life in ways that typecast actors or actresses sometimes don't--each part
has its own peculiar motivations and quirks--and her performance is
perhaps the best thing about "Dove."</P>
<P>That, however, is somewhat faint praise, because this film is something of
a mess. The third recent adaptation of a Henry James novel, "Wings of the
Dove" tackles a work whose drama is arguably more psychological than that
of "Washington Square" or "Portrait of a Lady" (not that those were
action-packed, but you get the idea), and ends up with a pace so languid
that the whole thing feels in danger of grinding to a halt. The plot is
not particularly complex--Carter, an orphan unable to marry her
impoverished journalist lover because of her patroness aunt's disapproval,
schemes to have him inherit the fortune of an ailing, naive American
heiress--and the film relies on the talents of the leads to hold the
audience's interest. But though Carter is up to the task, with flashing
eyes, pouty lips, and intimations of a hot temper, the other two underplay
their parts. Linus Roache of "Priest" is the lover imprisoned by his
conscience and torn by two different attachments, but very little of it is
actually apparent; the best word to describe his expression is "blank." We
can, of course, infer what he's supposed to be thinking, but it might be
nice to get more of a hint of it now and again. And Allison Elliott's
dying heiress seems either too forgiving to be a real character or simply
rather dim, and Elliott never really gives her understandable motivations.
Of course, many a film has ben carried on the strength of one performance,
and Carter's is good enough--but she spends little of the last third of
the film on screen, and the pace consequently drags considerably.</P>
<P>Softley does best when he lets the camera stay on Carter, and he does that
often enough at the beginning, when the film's clear focus is on
developing her character. But when the story turns to the triangle and
Softley wants to point out tensions or problems, he resorts to intrusive
devices--voice-overs, strange camera angles, inexplicably poor
lighting--that distract from the story. After all, a psychological drama
is interesting because of the characters, and holds our attention only if
the characters are compelling; direction that takes the audience's
attention away fromt he performers doesn't help. Particularly emblematic
in that repsect is s scene toward the end, after the heiress' death; yes,
a gondola hearse in Venice is a striking picture, but it also might have
been nice to get a look at Roache during that scene, even if all we're
going to get is more blankness. There are some skillful moments, notably
one where Carter and Raoche pass each other in a stairwell and the camera
trades angles repeatedly, but Softley calls attention to himself too
often. Perhaps the worst example is the transition from the clinic where
Elliott goes for treatment--Softley makes the transition out of the scene
by zooming in on an object and turning it into another object in a new
scene, but the new scene has nothing to do with anything and serves only
as a flimsy transition into an entirely different scene. Clever camerawork
is all very well, but it should aid, not impede, the story.</P>
<P>"Wings of the Dove" certainly looks good. The pitch for a costume design
Oscar is fairly obvious (how often does costume design make it into the
opening credits?) and it even seems that Carter's elaborate dresses and
hats become shabbier as her spirits sink. One particularly well-mounted
sequence follows the three in a pair of gondolas through a long series of
tunnels: there, and elsewhere, the languid quality of the life the people
lead translates well into the feel of the film itself.</P>
<P>As with "Washington Square," the story here centers on ambiguous
motivations, and the ambiguity gives the drama whatever force it has. But
the problem here is that the chemistry between Carter and Roache is less
than strong, and thus it wouldn't feel particularly significant if their
relationship took an unexpected turn. Put another way, his commitment to
her seems lukewarm from the beginning--perhaps there's supposed to be
something there that Roache's underacting doesn't convey--and a change in
his affections doesn't feel like all that dramatic a development. The
erotic element of their relationship, though it gets a lot of camera
time--starting with a scene in an elevator in Carter's dream in the
beginning, a scene which she (in her own dream) halts--is not particularly
well developed, and if the intent was to portray unbridled passion, it
doesn't quite work (and it's hardly what James had in mind). One scene
where Carter is bewailing her separation from Roache gets a gratuitous
little touch when the camera moves from her to the empty pillow next to
her and stays there, as it to say "Ha! That's what this is REALLY about!"
But the story is more interesting as a tale of three characters struggling
to understand each other than as a collection of frustrated desires, and
the quasi-erotic bits that Softley throws in are not highlights.
Paradoxically, though, the one sex scene in the film is done with some
intelligence--it isn't interchangeable with any other such scene, for one
thing-- and captures something of the rift between the characters
involved. Even if the idea of depicting such a scene would have been
anathema to James, it does provide a measure of resolution.</P>
<P>"Wings of the Dove" is certainly not a dreadful film; there are some
memorable scenes and some snappy dialogue, and Carter's performance is
consistently strong. But even at 105 minutes, relatively short these days,
it feels long and drawn-out; it often takes three scenes to convey what
could have been done in one. Whatever its merits, the appeal of "Dove"
will likely be lost on all but the most die-hard of period piece fans.</P>

<P>The room is as you left it; your last touch--
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly--hallows now each simple thing,
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's gray fingers, like a shielded light.</P>
