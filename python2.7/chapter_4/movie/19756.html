<P>Watching filmmaker Toshimichi Ohkawa's Japanese film, "Nobody," it struck me 
several times that this picture could be scripted and made in the same exact 
fashion as an American revenge thriller, although here it includes a 
no-nonsense, assured style that is rarely found in the U.S. mainstream. 
Tautly filmed and tightly developed without getting side-tracked with a bunch 
of needless subplots, the film includes three flawed heroes, easily 
discernible villains, mucho action sequences, and even a few clever, if 
somewhat cliched, plot twists. Moving at a brisk pace and highly entertaining 
for the genre, "Nobody" ultimately falls apart in its last five seconds, 
which does not solve the film in any way, but instead adds another conflict 
that makes you question what the point was to begin with.</P>
<P>Taki (Masaya Kato) and his two friends, the hard-edged Nambu (Riki Takeuchi) 
and weak Konishi (Hideo Nakano), are everybody businessmen in Japan enjoying 
themselves in a bar when they wrongfully are caught talking negatively about 
three mysterious men at the table next to theirs. When the three men pick a 
fight, their confrontation ends anticlimactically, but later, while going 
back to get the umbrella he left inside the bar, Konishi is severely beaten 
up. This means war for Taki and, especially, Nambu, who become set on finding 
out the three mens' indentities and hunting them down. Just when they begin 
to realize they probably will never see them again, they unexpectedly come 
into contact with one of the culprits and beat him up in the same manner that 
they did to Konishi. Receiving a threatening telephone call the next day, 
however, they are told that the man died, and they are not going to get away 
with what they have done.</P>
<P>"Nobody" is a conventional action-thriller that works particularly well 
because of director Ohkawa's expertise in stylish filmmaking, with a noir 
undertone and a collision of effective, chic elements, including moody 
camerawork, a memorably creepy music score, and thrilling action setpieces. 
There is very little in the way of character development or multi-layered 
plotting, aside from an unsatisfactorily realized subplot in which Taki's 
girlfriend discovers he has cheated on her, but that doesn't matter too much, 
just as long as the film is able to sweep you up in its basic, simple 
storyline, which it does.</P>
<P>A substantial amount of suspense is mustered up in many masterful scenes, 
including one in which Konishi foolishly meets the two remaining villains in 
a restaurant, expecting to simply talk with them, and another in which Nambu 
has a confrontation with an unidentified man in a black car that takes a 
violent turn. The color scheme of the film only adds to the atmosphere, as 
the night scenes are lit in varying shades of blue and black, while the day 
scenes are painted as gloomy and rather pallid. Accordingly, the climax is 
appropriately grisly and somewhat unpredictable.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "Nobody" becomes problematic in its cheap conclusion and 
wrap-up section, which includes a terribly-performed, artificial scene 
between Taki and his girlfriend, which, to begin with, is an inadequately 
developed relationship that has not earned the right to be as emotionally 
rewarding as it's supposed to be. Worst of all is the film's last few 
seconds, which are a complete and utter letdown that shows Taki has not 
actually won anything. He's practically back where he started at the film's 
ten-minute mark, and therefore, proves that in the ninety minutes that 
followed, he solved nothing. It is difficult giving a recommendation to a 
film that asks you to devote your time with it, only to add a final twist 
that is in no way justifiable. Perhaps this would not be such a severe flaw 
in a horror movie, where a sequel is almost inevitable, but in a Japanese 
thriller, it is doubtful we will be seeing a "Nobody Part 2" in the future. 
Still, "Nobody," Part 1, is a prime example of style over substance (which 
there is very little of), and its one major blunder does not erase the 
success that the rest of the film achieved.</P>
