<P>     The pieces are familiar, but they don't quite fit together.  A
reporter tries to uncover the secrets behind a mysterious celebrity,
interviewing his ex-wife at a night club.  Extended, surrealistic,
dialogue-free musical interludes are used to advance character and set
tone.  Campy dialogue, gaudy costumes and ambiguous sexuality flourish.
Speculative romantic connections are established between roman-a-clef
versions of pop music stars, accompanied by effectively pseudo-period new
songs.  It's CITIZEN KANE meets PINK FLOYD THE WALL, THE ROCKY HORROR
PICTURE SHOW meets GRACE OF MY HEART.  And that's saying nothing of the
suggestion that Oscar Wilde, the father of flamboyance, was an alien
progeny.</P>
<P>     Welcome to the evocative, provocative world of writer/director Todd
Haynes, the man who used Barbie dolls to tell the story of Karen Carpenter
in the little-seen underground film SUPERSTAR, and who fashioned a
sublime, complex cautionary tale about environmental and psychological
collapse in SAFE.  In VELVET GOLDMINE, a fictionalized account of the
early 70s glam rock scene, Haynes takes a somewhat appropriate style over
substance approach.  The center of the story is the rise and fall of Ziggy
Stardust...I mean, Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an androgynous
music sensation who created a musical alter-ego called Maxwell Demon and
bears no resemblance to any real music stars, living or David...I mean
dead.  Along the way Slade meets Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), an American
proto-punk whose onstage theatrics influence Slade to transform from
singer to full-fledged performance artist.</P>
<P>     The relationship between Slade and Wild -- actually a romantic
triangle including Slade's wife Mandy (Toni Collette) -- is only one piece
of the collage of decadence Haynes patches together.  VELVET GOLDMINE is
less a narrative than it is a long-form music video, intriguing images 
full of manufactured outrageousness (including the bizarre Oscar Wilde
prologue).  As such, it certainly re-creates its era effectively.  The
music, the mood and the theatricality are all pure glam; Rhys Meyers looks
perfectly the part as pop creation already beginning to eat itself.  But
Haynes piles stylish surface on top of stylish surface in VELVET GOLDMINE
until it never quite gets at the heart of anything -- not the artists, not
the appeal of glam, not even whether the scene was about social change or
filthy lucre.  </P>
<P>     It certainly comes awfully close on occasion.  More compelling than
the actual story of Brian Slade is the film's framing story, which finds
reporter Arthur Stewart (Christian Bale) trying to track down Slade in
1984, ten years after a stunt in which Slade staged his own mid-concert
assassination.  It turns out that Arthur was in attendance at that
concert, and that Slade and Wild were key figures in his youth.  In one
wonderfully cross-cut sequence, Arthur's sexual awakening is connected to
the sexual excesses of Slade's entourage, suggesting that even in their
self-absorption the glam rockers -- often tormented as children for their
sexual individuality -- succeeded at expanding boundaries for other youth.
Yet even this storyline spins into an absurd, pointless conspiracy-mystery
which Arthur could have put together only by actually viewing footage from
the film we're watching.</P>
<P>     That's the kind of infatuation with his own film-making that Haynes
displays in VELVET GOLDMINE.  Because it's always visually engrossing, it
keeps holding out the hope that it's going somewhere substantial.
Instead, it offers the cinematic equivalent of hip-hop sampling, turning
into a montage of visual and musical cues from other pieces of popular
cinema; Haynes even cribs from SUPERSTAR with a romantic scene between two
dolls.  If glam was somehow about the fine line between profound and
shallow, Haynes has hit the mark dead on.  This is one deliberately
confounding spectacle.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 saggy stardusts:  5.</PRE>
