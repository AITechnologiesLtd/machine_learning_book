<P>   The tagline of "Office Space" is "works sucks," a concept
that may indeed be true.  Ironically, what sucks in real life
(murder, mayhem, fatal illness) can be most entertaining on
the big screen, as the audience sit back safely in their
comfortable seats with their popcorn and burritos and
contemplate the fate of people less fortunate than they.   You
may have to look for a while for movies that concentrate on
people at work ("Wall Street" is a good example).  "Office
Space" is another reliable illustration.  This one takes a
Dilbert-like view of people sitting in their cubicles crunching
numbers and doing assorted jobs which are not in the least
as meaningful as the genuinely productive stuff that muscular
guys accomplish on the street with their drills, hammers, and
saws.</P>
<P>   "Office Space" is directed by Mike Judge, who is perhaps
best known for his direction of the animated feature "Beavis
and Butthead Do America," but some of you may be familiar
with his short cartoons going under the name of "Milton." 
The title character of this lampoon has been seen on
programs like "Saturday Night Live" and, in fact, the entire
movie comes across as an extended sketch of that unevenly
comic TV entertainment.  Judge's movie satirizes office work
with its impossible bosses, alienating labor, and meaningless
paper-pushing. Though it centers on three particular software
engineers who are mad as hell and are not going to take it
any more, "Office Work" does not even approach the depth of
Sidney Lumet's 1976 cry for help, "Network." Nor does it
possess the witty, sledgehammer impact of Michael Moore's
hilarious 1998 documentary, "The Big One."  Nonetheless, it's
a fun movie that will appeal particularly to those in the
audience who have the misfortune of spending their
weekdays in cubicles, one that works because of the
wonderful deadpan acting of its central character, Peter
Gibbons (Ron Livingston), who teams up with his two best
friends on the job to do something about their lives of quiet
desperation.</P>
<P>   Essentially a sophisticated sitcom, an extended joke that
manages to keep the giggles coming throughout its ninety
minutes, "Office Space" begins its thesis that work is  a
travesty by spotlighting a major traffic jam on a typical
morning.  Watch especially the nerdy-looking Michael Bolton
(David Herman) lip-synching gangsta rap from the safety of
his closed automobile.  When he, his Saudi-American co-
worker with an unpronounceable name (Ajay Naidu), and
Peter Gibbons learn that their company expects to downsize
workers, they conjure up a plan to introduce a virus into the
computer network which would not only damage the
corporation but would be slowly and imperceptibly put money
into their bank accounts over a period of years.  </P>
<P>   The running gag of the story, however, is that Peter,
hypnotized into a permanent don't-worry-be-happy attitude,
not only stops coming to work on time if at all, but convinces
a hatchet man hired as a consultant that he should be
promoted rather than fired.  </P>
<P>   The brief romance between him and Joanna (Jennifer
Aniston), serves as a subplot, as Joanna is as disgusted with
her job as a restaurant waitress as Peter is as a software
developer.  Despite Ms. Aniston's appeal, the entire romantic
interlude could be cut from the movie with no great loss,
giving Judge an opportunity to concentrate on what he does
best--to send up corporate America.  </P>
<P>   "Office Space" is for the most part sit-com formulaic but
when the jokes work--which they do most of the time--they
provide quite enough laughs and signs of rueful recognition
for the audience.  When Peter, who has taken a devil-may-
care attitude, is warned that he will be fired and will not be
able to pay his bills, he responds confidently and coolly, "I
never really liked paying bills."  This is the sort of quip that
infuses the entire movie.  If that appeals to you, this is your
kind of movie.  I know it's mine.</P>
