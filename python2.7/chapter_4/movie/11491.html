<P>Niagara Niagara (R) *** (out of ****)
        Bob Gosse's Niagara Niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of
young-lovers-on-the-road movies.  Wild Marcy (Robin Tunney) and calm Seth
(Henry Thomas) meet cute, literally running into each other while
shoplifting at a local store.  A mere couple of scenes later, the two
embark on a journey to Toronto from their small, unnamed American town in
pursuit of a rare doll that Marcy desperately wants.  Along the way, true
love inevitably blossoms.
        What sets Niagara Niagara apart, though, is that Marcy is afflicted with
Tourette's Syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and
vocal tics.  Tunney, displaying an acting range not hinted at in the
teenage witch thriller The Craft, delivers an astonishing performance that
won her the Best Actress prize at last year's Venice Film Festival.  To
term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery;
Tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability, which
makes her depiction of Marcy's illness--which often causes her to act
violently--that much more convincing and tragic.  She and the nicely subtle
Thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry.
        Their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way, mostly the
fault of writer Matthew Weiss.  A detour involving a kindly widower
(Michael Parks) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching
halt, and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist (Stephen Lang) is
highly unbelievable.  But these missteps do not blunt the power of Tunney's
bravura turn, which carries Niagara Niagara to a level of poignance it
would not have otherwise achieved.  (opens March 20)</P>

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
