<P>"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is what happens, I suppose, when a few hundred 
actors gain access to photographic equipment and drugs. Is there another 
explanation for the film's existence? Could serious businessman and artists 
have conceived, written, financed and produced it? Mybe some anti-social 
scumbag in the film industry decided he needed to create something grotesque 
to release on St. Patrick's Day weekend, so that the few people in the 
country without hangovers would be suffering ordeals too.</P>
<P>This movie is technically and artistically inept. Shots are set up from 
arbitrary angles, meaning there is no rhythm to the cuts between them. Most 
of the transitions are slightly jarring anyway, as in some cheap 1970s porn 
film. The music seems to be from one of those flicks, too, on a soundtrack 
that doesn't match the picture properly; the timing of the lip-synching is 
off, and all the sound effects are at the same volume, which sounds creepy.</P>
<P>It doesn't help that the actors speak with phoney voices. The cast is headed 
by two Americans, Kevin Spacey and Linda Fiorentino, and they are joined by 
British actors Helen Baxendale and Peter Mullan. All try and fail to put on 
Irish accents, and since most of the cast is made up of foreigners with the 
same problem, our ears can hardly bear it. Did it never occur to the 
filmmaker, Thaddeus O'Sullivan, that plenty of available actors are native to 
Eire?</P>
<P>Some of them can be seen in John Boorman's film "The General", which was 
released to acclaim in 1996, and followed the legendary career of a real-life 
criminal named Martin Cahill. "Ordinary Decent Criminal" borrows from the 
same story, which didn't need to be told again, especially not in this dumb 
way. The character, renamed Michael Lynch and played by Spacey, is shown as a 
loveably crafty and confident rogue, who is always outsmarting incompetent 
police with such hilarious tactics as kidnapping and car bombs. Ho, ho, ho, 
what fun!</P>
<P>Spacey is expected to win an Oscar next Sunday for his performance in 
"American Beauty", the tragi-comic story of a suburban loser's search for 
happiness. Obviously the great actor isn't having a hard time finding 
challenging material. So why did he agree to star in "Ordinary Decent 
Criminal"? It's the kind of film you stare at in appalled silence, amazed 
that your local cinema would actually book it. It's impossible to write a 
satisfactory review of the experience. Please accept this fragmented list of 
gripes.</P>
