<P>by Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>    Here's a note for any film maker intending to include a scene in
which characters bungee jump from the Eiffel Tower: the tower itself is
not composed of straight, vertical lines. The support beams curve away
from the center closer to the bottom, so anything that falls off the top
is likely to smash into the side of the tower no later than halfway
through the fall. So, in effect, people bungee jumping from the top will
not reach the ground until they collide with many steel girders,
bouncing their way down, down, down, until they reach the bottom as a
dead lump.</P>
<P>    The characters in An American Werewolf in Paris didn't have this
problem--they found an alternate version of the Eiffel Tower, which
represents more closely the Washington Monument, so they were not only
able to avoid hitting the side of the tower, but to clear every bit of
the building itself and land safely in the grass clearing hundreds of
feet away. I bet that Andy (Tom Everett Scott) didn't realize how his
life would change when he selflessly leaped from the top of the tower in
order to save a beautiful girl (Julie Delpy) attempting suicide. Of
course he saves her, in a stunt that makes every Schwarzenegger film
look realistic, and sets her on the ground, only to collide with a
girder on the way up (I suppose some points may be given for
understanding that there are, in fact, girders on the Eiffel Tower).</P>
<P>    The girl's name is Serafine, and she is a werewolf. Andy and his
friends find this out the hard way. When Andy becomes a werewolf
himself, he uncovers a plot in which a group of nihilistic werewolves
trap unknowing Americans and kill them. Their ultimate goal is to turn
the entire world into werewolves; Andy, with the help of Serafine, must
stop him at all costs! But only after he comes to terms with the fact
that he is a werewolf, and that the woman he loves is also a werewolf.</P>
<P>    Most horror films set up rules and guidelines by which the
characters act and ultimately destroy the evil bad guys. There are no
such rules in this film. I was under the impression that only silver
bullets could kill werewolves, but here they seem rather weak (many of
them die by multiple gunshots from a standard hand gun). Aside from the
concept not following what I know about werewolves, nothing else in the
film seems to be guided by any laws or rules.</P>
<P>    Take, for example, the Eiffel Tower bungee-jumping scene, which is
later upstaged by a Statue of Liberty bungee-jumping scene. There are
also tasteless moments in which Andy talks to ghosts. (These ghosts are
unique--they are the victims of werewolves, complete with the original
bloody wounds; they are damned to walk the earth until the werewolves
that have taken their lives die.) The entire idea behind the ghosts is
unfounded and absolutely pointless. The film also includes those
irritatingly dumb scenes in which Andy's friends try and get him ready
for a big date with Serafine by telling him what to wear and what to
say.</P>
<P>    All of this adds up to one big problem: in a film that lacks even a
hint of realism, it is impossible to care, or even get excited, about
the characters and the situation. There was not a doubt in my mind that
everything would be okay, not because it's a typical horror film and
everything is always okay, but because I knew the characters could just
cast an "Everything is Okay!" spell and everything would be okay. A
situation that appears to be certain death provides an escape when the
floor falls out from underneath a character for no particular reason.
Don't ask why Serafine loses all self-control when she turns into a
werewolf, and why the other werewolves seem completely aware of
themselves and others. Certainly don't question the pseudo-science in
which the bad werewolves synthesize a drug which can induce the werewolf
effects at any time during the day (which has a laughable, "scientific"
explanation having something to do with the moon cycles).</P>
<P>    As bad as this film is, I have to admit that it's not without guilty
pleasures. Director Anthony Waller should get someone to give him a real
script, because he could probably do some interesting things. And the
acting is rather entertaining, especially from Scott. There are also a
few really funny moments, and I actually liked the CG werewolves (they
don't look too cartoony). If you love werewolf or horror films, then you
might like this silly film. I'm not a big fan of either one, but I can't
say I wasted my money here. It's a bad film, yes, but it's charming in a
tasteless, lawless manor. I didn't like it, but I sat through it, and I
can't say I was disappointed. I got what I expected after seeing the
preview.</P>
