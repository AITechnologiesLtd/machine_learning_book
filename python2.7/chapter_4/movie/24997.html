<P>This is a true story. In the early 1940s, Joe Mitchell, a staff 
writer of the New Yorker Magazine encountered Joe Gould  - an 
eccentric, bohemian,  self-styled writer and genius, a bum, 
panhandling drunkard,  sponging, scrounging street person, strikingly 
ragged, ever-performing and grandstanding figure, the author - he 
claimed - of a monumental work-in-progress, "The Oral History of 
Time," and a man who spoke seagull language.</P>
<P>The latter trait became the title of a 1942 New Yorker profile by 
Mitchell, "Professor Sea Gull." It was a hit, which brought no riches 
to anyone yet made Gould famous in certain circles, notably the 
Greenwich Village sort. Gould's new celebrity opened doors for him, 
though there were no drastic changes in his personality or modus 
vivendi.</P>
<P>He kept referring to Joe Mitchell, a courtly, diffident Southerner 
married to a photographer and the father  of two charming girls, as 
"my biographer," a title that soon became a burden for Mitchell, 
just as the now-dependent-on-him Gould did.</P>
<P>The movie is a now flowing, now starts-and-spurts depiction of the 
relationship of the two Joes. Its epicenter is the portrait of Gould, 
whom Sir Ian Holm plays with in-your-face passion, demonic energy, 
ego-projection, explosiveness, and hamminess (appropriate here) that 
make it the most electric role of his career.</P>
<P>Eccentrics and/or bohemians are not uncommon, but genuine as well as 
lovable eccentrics are rare. Forget  the mythology of much 
literature, film and journalism which often depict them as the salt 
of the earth --when at most "spice of the earth" would have sufficed. 
Professed anti-conformism is not by itself enough to make great 
characters. Joe Gould is not great, but he does stand out, and in a 
sense, that's all that is needed to hold your attention today, in our 
era of homogenized sameness when individualism --notably on-screen 
figures -- is at a low ebb. (Beyond films and people, think of cars. 
 From the 30s to the 50s kids used to play the game of identifying 
each marque and model. The autos were so distinctive. Now they're 
like the proverbial peas in a pod).</P>
<P>Joe Gould reeks with personality while blurring the line between who 
is the real Joe and who the invented one. Hirsute, dishevelled and 
unkempt, must also reek with odors, the result of not bathing, not 
changing clothes, sleeping in flop houses or missions. 
Delicately--and unrealistically-- the film does not mention this 
point, and when Gould attends a party we don't see the other guests 
sniffing the air.</P>
<P>Joe Mitchell, on the contrary, is a breath of fresh air. Quiet and 
polite,  he suggests a bundle of complexities that do not come to the 
fore, a mystery of creativity, writer's blocks and problems that 
remain un-analyzed and seldom suggested. Of the two Joes he is the 
more interesting behind his near-but not-quite-placid facade. And 
indeed, in his lifetime, Mitchell produced one book, "Up in the Old 
Hotel," a collection of his writings. And after Gould died (1957) in 
a mental hospital, Mitchell did another New Yorker story on him in 
1964, "Joe Gould's Secret." That was the last thing he ever wrote, 
even though for the next 30 or so years, Mitchell dutifully came to 
the magazine office where he was heard typing away. The mystery is 
Mitchell, and not Gould.</P>
<P>Stanley Tucci plays Mitchell with extraordinary realism. He is not a 
star, an actor, or a player, but he is, in an unshowy fashion, a 
living, complex presence that is totally credible and implies a great 
deal more than meets the eye. Tucci lives his part with immense yet 
guarded understanding, and buttresses this with the great love Tucci 
has always professed for the New York of many decades ago. It shows 
all the time, with a certain sweetness that, curiously, goes as far 
as eliminating any references or allusions to the on-going World War 
II in the 40s.</P>
<P>In a time when film soundtracks consist of platitudes, grunts, jejune 
dialogue and noises from explosions or crashes, Tucci is kaking us a 
gift of a real talkie. And of a real adult work. I don't mean "adult" 
as in sex and expletives but as in grown-up. We ought to genuflect.</P>
