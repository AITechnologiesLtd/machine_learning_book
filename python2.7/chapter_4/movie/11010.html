<P>   A current movie, Marlene Gorris's "Mrs. Dalloway"--which is
based on a novel by Virginia Woolf--depicts a shellshocked
soldier returning from World War I who takes his own life.  It's
not at all unusual for veterans who have been to the front to
return home with emotional difficulties.  Imagine, then, what
it's like to survive the Holocaust, being incarcerated in a labor
camp or, even more momentous, a Nazi death camp like
Auschwitz.  After being worked for sixteen hours a day, living
on one bowl of watery soup and perhaps a piece of bread,
witnessing fellow inmates tortured and hanged, shot, or
gassed, you're more than likely to lose your spirit, your very
soul.  "The Truce," a movie equally somber and humorous,
focuses on one such survivor named Primo who is liberated
from Auschwitz in April 1945 by Russian soldiers and faces
an uphill struggle to regain his spirit.  Based on the book of
the same name by the chemist Primo Levi, an Italian Jew
who, like Rupert Graves's shellshocked character in "Mrs
Dalloway" took his own life, director Franceso Rosi's film
traces the revitalizing of Primo's senses, principally his erotic
feelings, in a relatively high-budget movie which was begun in
1987.  Though no American or British characters are
depicted, this Italian-French-German-Swiss co-production is
principally in the English language, while shards of Russian,
Italian, and Greek dialogue remain untranslated.</P>
<P>   The biographical narrative, fully dramatized rather than in a
documentary format, deals with the months immediately
following the liberation of scores of inmates in Poland's
Auschwitz concentration camp by Russians in April 1945. 
While the movie opens upon a violent battle scene as the
Russian troops approach the camp, the remainder of the film
is more of a meditation by Primo, his reactions to the
adventures he undertakes as a refugee eager to return from
Poland to his home in Turin, Italy.  Perhaps the most
surprising aspect of the movie is its glorification, indeed its
deification of the Russian soldiers and civilians alike.  As
Primo was not a Communist sympathizer or in any way a shill
for Soviet ideology, this veneration provides a bold contrast to
Mark Jonathan Harris's views in his 1997 documentary "The
Long Way Home."  "The Long Way Home," produced by
Moriah Films in affiliation with the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
chronicles the odious procedures to which these refugees
were subjected from the end of the war in 1945 to the
establishment of a Jewish homeland in Israel in 1948.  Unlike
Franceso Rosi, who directed "The Truce," Harris observes
that the American troops who liberated the prisoners of the
Dachau concentration camp near Munich looked at the
inmates with disgust, even throwing up at the sights and
smells they encountered.  There, the homeless and solitary
Jewish refugees were rounded up into barbed-wire camps not
unlike those they faced from the Nazis, while government
higher-ups even kept military guards outside to prevent the
Jews from "scattering" and "creating anarchy."  Even worse,
in the Lithuanian town of Vilna, five who tried to return to their
homes were murdered, a note stuffed into one pocked which
read, "This will be the fate of the surviving Jews."  Even in
Britain, Labour Party Foreign Secretary Nye Bevin once raged
that the "Jews are a pestilence."  </P>
<P>   No such problems for the survivors in Primo Levi's memory. 
Jews and non-Jews alike, they are picked up by Russian
trucks of the Red Army and sent into Cracow and
resettlement camps of Katowice, spending a good deal of
time wandering through Russian towns in a roundabout
journey that would take them to their homelands.  </P>
<P>   One refugee center features a beautiful, blond Russian
woman who takes a fancy to Primo (John Turturro), amused
by the refugee's open-faced shyness and inability to put his
feelings and thoughts into words.  A chemist by trade, Primo
is put to work classifying the medicines that arrive daily at the
camp, and through the alluring woman who invites him to a
small party in the home of the supervising doctor, he begins
to regain his sexual feeling.  Primo's rehabilitation is aided by
his relationship with his best friend,Cesare (Massimo Ghini),
who sees the humor amid the darkness and while not
verbalizing his philosophy, makes clear to Primo that laughter,
not the chemist's drugs, is the best medicine. Primo is
likewise charmed and occasionally humiliated by a boisterous
companion known simply as "The Greek" (Rade Serbedzija),
an opportunist and bon vivant who makes the best of his
situation by selling clothing and even managing a makeshift
Russian brothel.  In only one case do the local citizens turn
away from the refugees, when they discover that the mostly
Jewish exiles have recently been liberated from Auschwitz. 
Otherwise, these people are treated virtually like conquering
heroes by the people they meet, most poignantly by an
offering of beer and food by an Austrian woman who had
once written to Hitler advising him not to start a war.  (The
letter did not reach Der Fuhrer, but the SS got their hands on
it and burned down her shop.)</P>
<P>   From time to time the film bursts forth in unadulterated
bliss, particularly when focused on a raucous night of
entertainment. Hundreds of Soviets cheer in the audience, as 
performers burst forth in song and a cocky Russian does a
respectable imitation of Fred Astaire, sword waving about, to
the music of Irving Berlin's "Cheek to Cheek."  Filmed in
Ukraine using Italian and Ukrainian crews, "The Truce"
features a pulsating soundtrack of largely European hits like
"Chardash" and "Hungarian Dance" and "Moskva Majskaja." 
John Turturro's toned-down performance is contrasted with
the vivacious presentation by the large ensemble, allowing us
to watch the hero's transformation from a near-zombie to a
life-affirming human being.</P>
<P>   Since the movie is more a reflection on life by its principal
subject than a plot-driven story, it moves along at a pace as
meandering as the train which takes Prime to Italy not by the
logical southern route through Odessa but by a northward
detour into Russian, Polish and German cities.  Yet the story
moves along inexorably as Rosi traces the movement of the
train on a map of the area, stopping here and there to
reinforce Primo's conviction that the joys of life outnumber its
miseries.   </P>
