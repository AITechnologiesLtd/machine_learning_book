<PRE>A MAP OF THE WORLD
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        When the kids are acting up, parents may wish to be transported to
some solitary place where the rigors of domesticity can be placed far
behind them, if only for a couple of hours.  The state penitentiary would
probably not be most people's first choice of destination, but that's where
Alice Goodwin finds herself in "A Map of the World."  Oddly, Alice seems to
welcome, even relish, this opportunity to get away from her demanding
children and her ineffective husband, yet there's one thing she cannot get
away from no matter how hard she tries: the specter of irreconcilable guilt.</P>
<P>        How could anyone live with oneself when a child entrusted into
one's care dies?</P>
<P>        This act of criminal negligence isn't what lands Alice in prison,
but it is the start of a downward spiral that Jane Hamilton examines in her
book, and director Scott Elliot attempts to examine in his cinematic
adaptation, scripted by Peter Hedges and Polly Platt.</P>
<P>        Elliot's "A Map of the World" fails to pack any kind of emotional
wallop, however, which is strange given the film's subject matter and even
stranger given the confident performances of its leads.  Sigourney Weaver
is convincing as the emotionally-troubled Alice, David Strathairn plays her
husband Howard with his usual sensitivity, and Julianne Moore is typically
strong as Theresa, the friend and neighbor whose young daughter
accidentally drowns in the Goodwin's pond.</P>
<P>        Alice, who has promised to take Theresa's two young girls and her
own two daughters swimming, spends a little too long searching for her
bathing suit and returns downstairs to find one of her charges missing.  A
few panic-stricken moments later, Alice discovers the little girl lying
face down in the water.</P>
<P>        Compare this scene to the drowning at the beginning of Nicolas
Roeg's "Don't Look Now," for example, and you'll get a sense of Elliot's
lifeless handling of his film's dramatic content.  In fact, the director's
matter-of-fact approach to the material is a serious liability; scenes and
situations are presented rather than developed, and while Weaver gives
Alice her all, we are left feeling distanced from this woman and from this
cast of characters.</P>
<P>        After the accident, Alice, a part-time school nurse who has always
spoken her mind, is accused of child abuse as the unnamed Wisconsin town
turns its back on her and her family.  The film veers between rural
domestic drama and tacky women's prison melodrama culminating in an
impotent and blessedly-short courtroom sequence.  Again, Elliot keeps the
events at arm's length, as if afraid to commit one way or another.</P>
<P>        Arliss Howard plays defense attorney Paul Reverdy with a wink in
his eye which comes across as tasteless given the seriousness of the
charge, and that's Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched from "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest") as Alice's conscientious mother-in-law.  Their
contributions are adequate, but don't enhance the drama any.</P>
<P>        "A Map of the World" is a well-meaning but imperfect work,
recommended only for fans of Ms. Weaver, devotees of imperturbable cinema,
or, perhaps, cartographers.</P>
