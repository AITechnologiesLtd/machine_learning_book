<P>     In the movies, like in real life, it isn't enough just to have a heart
in the right place.  Good intentions are nice, but they need to be backed up
by an intelligent script telling an involving story.  In the case of
DANGEROUS MINDS, we get an idealized version of inner city life, where,
though problems may require more than the wave of a magic wand to remove,
the solutions still seem too facile.</P>
<P>     DANGEROUS MINDS is based on a true story (MY POSSE DON'T DO HOMEWORK,
written by Louanne Johnson), but never has the Hollywood sheen been more
apparent.  With master crowd-pleasers Don Smith and Jerry Bruckheimer behind
the production, there is never any question that this movie will pander to
the least common denominator.  Drama is pretty much by-the-numbers, tragedy
is shallow, and the resolution is expectedly upbeat.  Emotion and character
interaction rarely ring true.</P>
<P>     Ex-Marine Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer) comes to a Palo Alto high
school in search of a job as a student teacher.  What she gets instead is a
full-time position teaching English to a group of bright but "socially
challenged" students that she quickly dubs as the "rejects from hell."  When
her first-day wardrobe choice and meek attitude earn her the nickname of
"White Bread", she tries a radical approach: wear a leather jacket, curse as
proficiently as the kids, and teach karate as a lead-in to English Lit.  It
works, and the students start to come around.  Despite protestations from an
uptight, by-the-book principal (Courtney B. Vance), lives are changed as a
result of Louanne's unorthodox approach of using Bob Dylan lyrics to teach
poetry and rewarding completed assignments with trips to amusement parks and
dinners at fancy restaurants.</P>
<P>     How much of DANGEROUS MINDS ended up on the cutting room floor?  A good
question, and the answer may explain why this film is so erratic.
Relationships that should have been better developed are left in an
embryonic stage.  The most notable is between Louanne and an especially
difficult pupil, Emilio (Wade Dominguez).  There's obviously something
missing in the way these two learn to relate to each other.  The result of
this incomplete, hit-and-miss approach diminishes the impact of the film's
central tragedy.</P>
<P>     DANGEROUS MINDS has a heart, but no soul.  In the face of hard-hitting
pictures like KIDS and TEEN DREAMS, it's difficult not to see this movie as
trivializing serious issues.  The seams in the script show a little too
clearly, and the heavy-handed attempts at audience manipulation stand out.
Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as do a number of the young
actors playing Louanne's students, but DANGEROUS MINDS is in desperate need
of more than good acting.  It demands substance rather than the filler that
the film makers thought would make an acceptable substitute.</P>
