<PRE>Entrapment</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones
Directed By Jon Amiel
Running Time: 1 hour 52 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(20th Century Fox)</PRE>
<P>Fox's first summer blockbuster before 'that' film is a entertaining enough
thriller which more twists than a very twisty thing. Sean Connery plays
master thief Robert MacDougal, who's still hanging off buildings and
prancing around at the age of sixty. Jones plays FBI agent Gin Baxter, who
thinks she'll be able to catch Connery if she goes undercover with him,
pretending to be a 'thief' herself. The plot is not as simple as it sounds,
however, and the film pulls off a number of twists that keep the tension
running.</P>
<P>Entrapment amounts nothing more than a pleasant diversion. There's nothing
heavy in this movie, it's as linear as hell and doesn't really suffer from
that. Sean Connery is charismatic enough as the thief, although it's a
little implausible that this granddad can survive some of the situations
he's thrown into. Zeta-Jones, who's starting to get a movie career going
thanks to The Mask of Zorro, looks pretty on-screen, although her acting is
a little flat. Unfortunately, her character must have been described in the
script as 'show off her butt,' because the character doesn't amount to
anything else. But that's what the popcorn popping public expect, the studio
obviously thinks. It won't hurt the box office, anyway. Comic relief comes
from the ever excellent Ving Rhames as Connery's sidekick, although he is
woefully underused. He gives the film a comic lift that is missing from the
rest of this somewhat droll affair.</P>
<P>Jon Amiel, whose previous film include the ho-hum Sommersby, is again rather
ho-hum here. There's only one true scene that has a lot of tension, where
Zeta-Jones is skilfully twisting and turning to avoid lasers. Other than
that, the direction is somewhat flat, and the first 30 minutes are almost
hideously slow, and not promising at all. The last 30 minutes are hideously
loud, and while full of bam bam action, are missing a spark that makes the a
ction exciting. It's all rather dead. Still, some nail biting stunts are
included, but it won't keep you on the edge of your seat during the entire
movie, which is what a action suspensener should do.</P>
<P>Finally, a large amount of suspension of disbelief is needed to make this
film work. It's seem impossible that Zeta-Jones would fall for Connery, not
due to the age difference, but due to the fact that the script gives them
little reason to. It's also hard to believe that Connery's character could
still be running and jumping around at his age, especially during the high
octane department. I wouldn't be surprised if Connerys stuntman earned more
than Connery himself. The twists are executed well, however, and not to
predictable.</P>
<P>Entrapment, although fun, has a air of disappointment about it. The film
really could have tried a little harder, and there's only small patches of
excitement rather than a continuing stream. It's no waste of celluloid, and
Connery and Jones are both watchable, but Entrapment hasn't set the
benchmark for summer movies.</P>
