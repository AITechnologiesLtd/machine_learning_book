<PRE>My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)</PRE>
<P>Seen at the UA Criterion for $4.50 on 28 July 1997</P>
<P>*My Best Friend's Wedding* is the film that finally proves that a woman's
best friend is not diamonds--he's a gay man.  I had resisted this movie,
because frankly, who can forget *Mary Reilly*? Did anyone even see *Mary
Reilly*? Case closed...</P>
<P>*My Best Friend's Wedding* is the best Julia Roberts movie since *I Love
Trouble.* Let's face it, Dermot Mulroney (as Michael) and RRRRRRupert
Everett (as George; a gay actor playing a gay character) are a lot more
appealing than Nick Nolte--whom I love, even though he refuses to return
my many, many phone calls.</P>
<P>Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best friend in Michael (Dermot Mulroney) 
with whom she once had a brief romance, nine years ago. But when she
discovers that he is marrying superwealthy Kimmy (Cameron Diaz--who's
inexplicably hated by many women I know), she suddenly realizes that she's
in love with him, and she has four days to stop the nuptials. </P>
<P>What ensues is improbable but comic. Julie flies into Chicago and is
immediately swept into the wedding plans. Kimmy, the bride, fawns all over
Julie and after a while, it seems that Kimmy really is perfect. She
thwarts Julie's attempts to discredit or embarrass her--whether she's
being forced to sing off-key karaoke or admitting wrongdoing to Michael.
This frustrates Julianne. So she has to call in the big guns--her gay
friend George. He actually has more of a life than she does. George shows
up in Chicago and poses as her fiance. </P>
<P>Her machinations fail and it is hard to root for her. What make the movie
enjoyable is that it is a traditional romantic comedy, except this time
the Rock Hudson type is openly gay. Even the opening credits give a nod to
tradition. Julia Robertsactually has good comic timing. She falls down
with the best of them--John Ritter, Dudley Moore. Personally, watching
people fall down is a cheap laugh unless it's done well (which is why I do
not really like too many Blake Edwards movies). </P>
<P>As for the romantice, the soundtrack amplifies the throwback ambiance with
ballads like "The Way You Look Tonight" or the entire cast exuberantly
singing "I Say a Little Prayer" at a crab house (the best scene in the
movie--the reason I would sit through the movie again). No Depeche Mode or
Smith dirges here. </P>
<P>Dermot Mulroney turns in a good performance as the "straight man" and we
will probably be seeing him in bigger-budget movies from now on; but the
real scene-stealer is Everett, who is more than just the typical gay
character dying to be a woman's best friend. He is a good friend, and he
counters her mad schemes with comeuppance rather than compliance. </P>
<P>The supporting cast is also very good. Rather memorable are Rachel
Griffiths and Carrie Preston as the loudly dressed sisters and friends of
the bride, Samantha and Amanda; Susan Sullivan shows up as the upper crust
mother of the bride and plays the part well. </P>
<P>JD Department: I could have very easily snuck into Speed 2 at the
Criterion, but decided against it; if the building collapsed, it would be
worse than being found dead with dirty underwear. </P>
