<PRE>      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>Literary works do not always translate very well into the screen, and on
occasion, a complete interpretation has to be set up, to avoid the traps of
confusion, or complaints, by those who live and die by the words of a novel.</P>
<P>Herman Hesse's STEPPENWOLF, is not a good subject for a film.  But it would
make an excellent film if the persons involved believe in the work and the
process which the characters go through in it.</P>
<P>Fred Haines' film version of this very famous novel is not going to satisfy
everyone, but it should give a good example of what Herman Hesse was all
about, and the main ideas of the novel come through very well, specially
when it is set up by the thinking mind of the main character, played by the
veteran actor extraordinaire Max Von Sydow.</P>
<P>The film opens with a cartoon, which summarizes the whole thinking into a
small Cliff notes.  And then it concentrates on the voyages of the main
character, from his drug intervals, to his involvement with a woman who is
bisexual, and not specially in love with him ( very German if you ask me )
but likes the mind of the man who trips so much.</P>
<P>With the exception of the MAGIC THEATRE sequences, which I wish were more a
part of the novel than the film, this story is good, while it isn't as
interesting as the novel itself.  In the book, we get a feeling  that the
writer is going to continue, and will survive the forays into unknown spaces
of the mind and body.  In the film, I don't remember that this is as strong
a point as it could be.</P>
<P>The actors are very good, and Dominique Sanda is very attractive and
seductive through out, and we wish there was more to her in the story, but
there isn't.</P>
<P>A FILM FOR THE INTELECTUAL FILM GO'ERS.
IF YOU KNOW HESSE, SUSPEND YOUR IDEAS FOR A WHILE.</P>
<PRE>4.5 out of 5 GIBLOONS</PRE>
