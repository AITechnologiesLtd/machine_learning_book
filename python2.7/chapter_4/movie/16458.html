<PRE>54 by DeWyNGaLe    * * 1 / 2</PRE>
<P>Ryan Phillippe, Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, Breckin Meyer, and Selma Hayek star
in this drama about the nightclub called 54.  54 is a nightclub that existed in
the 70s and 80s in Brooklyn, New York.  This film tells the story of a man's
dream of becoming a star, and how he made it to the top.  Ryan Phillippe stars
as Shane O'Shea, a city kid.  He and his buddies always hang out on the
weekends, and don't have much to do.  Shane always wonders what is on the other
side of the bridge, in Brooklyn.  One night he decides to go there with a few
buddies.  He sees the club of Studio 54.  He has heard all about it in the news
and papers.  Many stars go there, people he admires.  The only problem is, you
are only allowed in if you are on the list, or you are good looking enough to
enter.  </P>
<P>Mike Myers plays Steve Rubell, owner of Studio 54.  He has it made.  He is
pulling in a ton of money from 54.  He is the one who makes the list of the
people allowed in, and he is also the judge of who is good looking enough to
enter.  On the night that Shane comes, he allows Shane in, but he does not
allow his friends to come in.  Shane feels guilty, but enters anyway.  He is
about to have the time of his life.  He enters 54, and sees all the glitz and
glamour.  People are dancing, music is playing, and everyone is happy.  It is
like a dream come true.  He is now placed on the list, so he is allowed in at
anytime.  As he comes back more and more, Steve offers him a job as a
bartender.  He meets Greg (Breckin Meyer) and his wife Anita. (Selma Hayek) As
the movie progresses, the three of them become great friends.</P>
<P>One night at 54, Shane spots his dream girl, Julie Black. (Neve Campbell) Julie
is a soap star who is extremely popular.  He has always wanted to meet her and
now is his chance.  He talks with her, and they seem to get along.  As the
movie goes, Julie and Shane meet some more and get together.  They become
boyfriend and girlfriend after meeting the day after Chirstmas.  The
relationship between Shane and Julie was way underdeveloped and not told very
well at all.  Neve Campbell gives a fair performance in her short, ten minute
roll.  She could have been shown a lot more, and her character could have been
developed.</P>
<P>Greg and Anita's marriage is having many problems.  Greg thinks that Anita and
Shane are having an affair, which they are not.  Anita's dream is to be a
singer.  She wants to sing at 54 in front of everyone, and she finally gets the
opportunity at a New Year's Eve party.  Everyone likes her performance, and
Greg is very proud.  Greg and Anita eventually work everything out, including
their friendship with Shane.</P>
<P>Steve keeps bumping Shane up in the ranks at 54.  Shane is making a lot of
money now, and he is modeling for magazines.  Steve is proud to have Shane at
54.  Greg is becoming quite jealous, and their friendship is becoming
jeopardized.  Shane is still close to his family at home, but he is mostly in
the city now.  He is starting to become unhappy with his life and what he is
doing.  The only thing he has is the title "Shane 54" and a whole lot of money.
 Now, Steve is in a lot of trouble with the law.  He is losing money, and they
are ordering for 54 to be shut down.  Once it is shut down, everything is back
to normal.  Shane is still a big star, rich and famous.  Anita and Greg stay
together and remain friends with Shane.  A few years later, they re-open 54 for
a couple of years.  Everyone is there for the reunion, including Shane.  Shane
simply smiles at Steve, not speaking a word to him.  54 is not all that it used
to be, and a few years later 54 would shut down once again.</P>
<P>54 is an over dramatic tale of the rise and fall of a boy with a dream.  It had
a lot of potential to be a great film, but failed.  The plot is not strong at
all, and a lot of things aren't explained in the film.  Ryan Phillippe over
acts throughout the entire movie.  Mike Myers deserves an Oscar nod for his
role as the owner of 54.  Breckin Myer, Neve Campbell, and Selma Hayek all give
mediocre performances in their underdeveloped roles.  If they had not cut out
so many scenes, and added about twenty more minutes of footage, 54 could have
been a real winner.</P>
