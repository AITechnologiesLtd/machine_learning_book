<P>Norman Jewison is a great crafter of friendly, easy movies such as The
Thomas Crown Affair and The Cincinnati Kid, but his resume also boasts a
few titles that include provoking and thoughtful themes.  Among these
films are In the Heat of the Night, A Soldier's Story, and the
culture-influenced Fiddler on the Roof and Moonstruck.  What is so
glorious about the last two movies is that both are hearty fun, not
straying too far from the brilliant style that makes Jewison the
accomplished moviemaker he is.  Their parallels can be seen after
watching them- Fiddler on the Roof is a film based in Czarist Russia and
explores the traditions of a little Jewish town and Moonstruck explores
Italian families in New York.  Both films do it all so humorously that
the "education" is painless.</P>
<P>Released during the year of The French Connection and A Clockwork
Orange, Fiddler on the Roof had no hope of winning the Academy Awards'
Best Picture, but today, it is known as the last great epic musical ever
made.  Yet, it is not really a musical, at least not in the way most
musicals are.  It tells the story of Tevye (Topol), a Russian-Jewish man
who has five daughters (unfortunately no sons- alas!), a cow, and a
bickering but fun wife, Golde (Norma Crane).  Tevye is content with his
simple life in his simple town- when he sings "If I Were A Rich Man," he
only wonders; he longs, but does not grieve.  He talks to God and is
religious like all the people in his village.  When the town matchmaker
tries to find his older girls husbands, daughter Tzietel groans "The
last time she got me an old, bald man!"</P>
<P>"You want someone with hair, marry a monkey!" says the mother.</P>
<P>When the matchmaker finds Tzietel a husband, the butcher, the family is
overjoyed- after all, he is rich, old, and will take good care of her.
Tevye laughs, "I always wanted a son, but I wanted one a little younger
than me!"  Tzietel is not pleased.  She is in love with the town
ne'er-do-well (Leonard Frey) and when Tevye discovers this, he is
vexed.  "No girl should ever pick her own husband!" he thinks.  He soon
discovers that times are changing when a young man comes to the town
spreading his knowledge and reprimanding the townsfolk for not knowing
the goings-on in the world.</P>
<P>It is difficult for Tevye to face this reality; his world is a cage of
dull, yet happy life in which you settle for what you can get.  This
young man preaches different attitudes and it pains him to have to
accept and let go of the morals and traditions he has held fast to for
so long.  Soon, his daughters know this thing called "desire" and are
wanting to marry men they love, not old men they will have to serve.
Tevye is understanding and tries to conform as best he can.</P>
<P>There are many gems of comedy in Fiddler on the Roof.  You start to
realize how narrow and outrageously funny the old Jewish traditions
were, how limiting they were for people.  The townspeople's lives are so
simple that when Golde sends Tevye to talk to the butcher about
something (he does not yet know the butcher will ask for Tzietel's
hand), he thinks he will ask to buy his cow!  On Tzietel's wedding day,
it is hilarious to see Tevye and the butcher violently fighting only
seconds after they have spoken cordially to each other.  When the
matchmaker finds husbands for Tevye's two little girls, Golde asks
"Which boy for which girl?"  In return, the matchmaker shrugs and says,
"Does it matter?  Take your pick."</P>
<P>Those who aren't fond of musicals will hate Fiddler on the Roof at first
listen.  At the beginning, the townspeople join in a performance of a
sickeningly bland song called "Tradition".  A) The song is scathing and
B) it does not meet the standards an audience is likely to have set if
they have ever seen other parts of this movie.  This film is mammoth, an
epic as grand as Doctor Zhivago, yet as simple as a childhood
fairytale.  Once away from that blasted and dreaded pre-title sequence,
things get so much better.  Isaac Stern's violin croons in the
background.</P>
<P>Fiddler on the Roof is very literal-minded.  There is nothing hidden
behind its sleeves, nothing particularly striking, except for its
refreshing humor and honest heart.  The cinematography gives the film a
dull feel- the film's palette includes subdued browns, oranges, reds,
and greens.  What is exceptionally intriguing is Topol, the actor behind
the Tevye character.  He is a big man with a deep voice.  He makes a
fool of himself while dancing moronically in the "If I Were a Rich Man"
sequence, then becomes sincere in his conversations with God.  This
mixture of emotions and personalities make his performance the jewel
that it is.  He is a large, joyful presence that makes the film a sunny
experience, at least for the first hour.  The final two hours are filled
with turbulent emotions, when father collides with daughter and reality
collides with the little town.</P>
<P>The music in Fiddler on the Roof is beautiful, but the dance-and-music
sequences are not used for the same purpose as they are used in a West
Side Story-type musical.  The songs are lyrically-mediocre, but the
musical sequences are not to showcase great songwriting (the
songwriting, frankly, is mere) but to tell and enhance the story.  The
characters use the songs for telling their story, not to show off their
dancing skills and singing skills (of which most of the performers have
only average capabilities).  This makes the music almost operatic.  It
isn't opera but, like operas (which aren't showy displays of excellent
songwriting; the songs are simply undulating collections of notes),
their only purpose is to give a musical translation of the story, to add
on to what is already being said.  Most musicals use music, dance, and
song deliberately- to show dancing, singing, and songwriting
capabilities.  Fiddler on the Roof is filled with tiny songs that are
just melodic extensions of the tale being told.</P>
<P>Moonstruck, made a little more than a decade after Fiddler on the Roof,
is not a musical, but the music gives it a certain atmosphere.  Dean
Martin belts out "That's Amore" during the opening titles, setting the
tone for this very Italian movie.  Cher is radiant here, and very funny-
she, Olympia Dukakis, and Vincent Gardenia are like a chorus- each
singer hitting the right note, making an extremely funny study of New
York-Italian family and tradition.</P>
<P>The down-to-earth Loretta (Cher) accepts the proposal of a timid and
nearly empty-headed bachelor (Danny Aiello) whom she has been in
acquaintance with for some time.  The proposal sequence is hilarious-
Loretta, who has been hurt by the death of an earlier husband, demands a
proper proposal, complete with groveling, a ring, and full names
stated.  Only minutes later, she is fighting with her fiancee over when
the wedding will be.  She wants a good date, one free of bad luck.  Her
fiancee is soon off for Palermo to see his dying mother whom he is very
devoted to.</P>
<P>When at home, Loretta's mother asks, "Do you love him?"</P>
<PRE>Loretta answers, "No."</PRE>
<P>"Good, when you love them they drive you crazy because they know they
can."</P>
<P>This is the rationale Loretta has been taught and her insipidness to
love and romance makes for good comedy.  Like in Fiddler on the Roof,
Moonstruck also dabbles into its studied culture and its reasons for
getting married.</P>
<P>Loretta has been asked by her fiancee to invite his brother (Nicolas
Cage) to the wedding; they have been on bad terms for years.  When the
reason for the distance between the two brothers is revealed, it is
outrageous!  "He cut off my hand!" bellows Cage.  His hand being cut
off, in reality, was related to his brother but, if it was anyone's, was
his own fault- the bread-slicer caught hold of his hand while he was
talking to his brother.</P>
<P>John Patrick Shanley, the author of Moonstruck's script builds the
sexual tension between Cage and Cher.  It ends in an eruption including
a toppling table and screaming.  Cage loves Cher but she is too
level-headed to believe in love.  Nicolas Cage is an actor who always
seems like he's in a dream- he uses this quality of his very well while
his character is in love with Loretta.  There is a momentous speech in
which Cage's character is very direct- "I don't care about tomorrow, or
the next day.  All I know is I want to sleep with you and I don't care
if both of us burn in hell!"  It is refreshing to see such a twist on
the typical movie serenade.</P>
<P>It turns out that the moon has concocted a spell on the people of New
York and has made everyone fall in love.  Dukakis becomes acquainted
with a flirtatious middle-aged professor (John Mahoney); Gardenia falls
for a ditzy woman; a loveless, aging marriage has been rekindled; and
Cher and Cage fall madly in love.</P>
<P>The scenes with Olympia Dukakis are a joy, but it is Cher, Italian
accent and all, that carries this film.  She is bubbly in the role of a
rather dry woman.  She demands attention- when she's angry, like in the
scene where she slaps Cage and screams "Snap out of it!", and when she's
full of love, kicking an empty bottle along the street.  She seems like
she's floating in those scenes and has such an engaging presence that
she is able to have so much responsibility on her back and still be
fully enjoyable.</P>
<P>Moonstruck, though it has several Italian nuances and can very much be
considered an ethnic comedy, is, at its core, a delicious romance.  It
is full of savvy, but is gooey and marshmallowey inside.  Jewison,
Shanley, and the cast have cooked a dish that tastes like chicken, but
with Italian seasonings- and it tastes delicious.</P>
<P>Fiddler on the Roof is much warmer than Moonstruck, which has a bit of a
sarcasm to it.  Both are very slim and simple movies: Fiddler disguised
as an epic and Moonstruck disguised as a culture study.  Both are
satisfying, and like all good movies, should be savored.</P>
