<PRE>THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION
------------------------------</PRE>
<P>CW Briggs (Woody Allen) believes he's the top insurance investigator in
New York City, but the new efficiency expert brought into the firm, Betty
Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) thinks he's a dinosaur.  When the two are 
chosen to be part of a nightclub's hypnotism act, code words will turn them
into the criminals they should be investigating in Allen's latest, "The
Curse of the Jade Scorpion."</P>
<P>Finally, the Woodman's back in form with his best flick since 1996's "Everyone
Says I Love You."  Allen, who has a real knack for nostalgic period pieces,
has created a sweet mystery.</P>
<P>CW Briggs is a hard boiled, chauvinistic insurance investigator and one of
Allen's funniest characters.  He goes toe to toe with tough cookie Betty
Ann Fitzgerald, who delivers some of the sassiest insults ever to be volleyed
in a battle of the sexes.  Betty Ann has a secret that makes her appear
suspicious to Briggs, but when revealed, uncovers her vulnerability.</P>
<P>When Briggs gets a late night call from Voltan (David Ogden Stiers, "Everyone
Says I Love You") whispering "Constantinople," he robs the wealthy Kensingtons,
stashes the jewels in his bedroom and has no memory of it.  Investigating
the next day, he meets spoiled Kensington daughter Laura, (Charlize Theron)
the type of gal who swims in fountains and drives fast cars.  She's turned
on because he's different ('I find it strangely exciting standing here in 
this grungy hovel with a myopic insurance investigator,' she purrs when
visiting his apartment).  When Briggs leaves her in his bed to heed another of
Voltan's calls, Laura finds his behavior suspicious.  Briggs discovers that
his boss Magruder (Dan Aykroyd) has taken on Coopersmith detectives who've
interviewed Laura and that he's now a suspect!  As much as Betty Ann presumably</P>
<P>hates Briggs, she doesn't believe he's a crook, but when he's put away, Voltan 
uses her code word 'Madagascar.'</P>
<P>Beautifully shot in a golden glow by cinematographer Zhao Fei ("Raise the
Red Lantern," "Sweet and Lowdown"), "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" has
both the look and feel of a 40's film.  Allen's plot is like a loving
restoration of a caper from a more innocent time.  His interweaving
suspicions and code words ('Paris' is used by the married Magruder to
convey sweet nothings to his mistress Betty Ann in mixed company) snake 
throughout his screenplay masterfully.  Allen's impeccable choice of music 
includes recordings of Duke Ellington's "Sophisticated Lady" and Glenn 
Miller's "Sunrise Serenade."</P>
<P>"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion" is a solid mid-range effort from the prolific
writer/director that's a delight from start to finish.</P>
