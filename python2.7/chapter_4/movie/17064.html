<P>"Practical Magic," is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that 
it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even 
get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one.</P>
<P>The film stars Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman as Sally and Gillian 
Owens, two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches, 
spanning back 200 years. At the start, their parents die when they are 
still children, and they go to live with their two zany aunts (Stockard 
Channing and Dianne Wiest). Switch to the present day, Gillian, who is 
the stronger, more rebellious sibling, leaves home, and meets up with a 
dark, abusive guy (Goran Visjnic), while Sally stays in their hometown, 
meets and falls in love with a sweet, caring man, has two children, and 
then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed (come 
to think of it, she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about 
two minutes). When Gillian calls Sally to come get her after having 
another abusive spat with Visjnic, they accidentally murder him, and in 
desperation, bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house. Add to 
this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an 
exorcism, not to mention a spattering of "light-hearted whimsy," and you 
have a pretty good idea how messy "Practical Magic" is.</P>
<P>After seeing the film, I reflected that there was not even one scene, or 
element, that I liked or enjoyed. It is a comedy, to be sure, but all of 
the humor falls astoundingly flat, and the occasional dramatic moments 
are the least bit touching. It is not charming or entertaining in any 
way. And then to top it off, we've got this dark, but bird-brained story 
of an evil spirit taking over Gillian's body. Whatever.</P>
<P>The characters are handled terribly, and actually, most of the actors do 
not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a 
character. There is no reason why Channing and Wiest should have decided 
to be in this film, and in every scene involving them, they are always 
standing side-by-side. No attempt is made to flesh them out into actual 
people. The same goes for Aidan Quinn, as a handsome police 
investigator, who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite 
Bullock, even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark, and 
once again, there is no attempt to develop their relationship, or his 
character, in any way. In fact, every line of dialogue in the film is in 
service of moving the plot along, rather than getting to know the people 
saying the lines. I should have know I was headed for trouble during the 
opening credits, when I found out the screenplay was written by the 
deeply hated Akiva Goldsman, who managed to destroy the "Batman" series 
with "Batman Forever" and "Batman and Robin."</P>
<P>"Practical Magic" is directed by Griffin Dunne, primarily an actor, who 
last year made the contrived, clumsy romance, "Addicted to Love," with 
Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick. I disliked that movie quite a bit, but 
since "Practical Magic" is even worse, that can only give you a taste of 
what a talentless filmmaker he is. I'd tell him to quit while he's 
ahead, but in these last two years, he's ultimately already buried 
himself.</P>
