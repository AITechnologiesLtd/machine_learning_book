<PRE>                                    BABE
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Somehow, from all the hype, I was expecting BABE to be one 
of the most entertaining movies ever made. Don't get me wrong, it's 
definitely ninety minutes of fun for the entire family with no sex, 
violence or anti-Semetic content (all of a sudden I feel like Michael 
Medved), but it won't go down in history as any kind of classic, at least 
not in my book (this book, of course). I'll leave all the jokes about pigs 
who are one day nominated for Oscars and the next day killed by 
Oscar Meyer to the talk show hosts who have said it all a thousand 
times, but I'll admit the concept of a pig as the cute hero of a movie 
never struck me before watching it, but I now realize it can be 
done -- and done well.</P>
<P>        Babe is born in the stockyard, where sooner or later all pigs 
are "chosen" to be marched onto the truck to heaven. (I wouldn't call 
Safeway "heaven," but it's only a movie after all.) Babe is the only pig 
who doesn't get picked for slaughtering because he's a runt and we all 
know little pigs like that are hardly worth the McDonald's circular 
bacon strips they eventually become. So he ends up being given to an 
old farmer (James Cromwell) as a prize for winning a state fair 
midway game. It beats one of those plastic whistles, I guess.</P>
<P>        The farmer's wife (who, oddly enough, looks like a pig 
herself) is looking forward to fattening up the pig so she can serve the 
family a nice Christmas ham, but Babe soon proves his worth in a 
different field -- sheep-herding. His tactic involves asking the sheep 
nicely to come into the corral, rather than barking and biting them on 
the legs (and I think if Clinton would do this he'd find Congress that 
much more cooperative). He soon becomes the prize sheep dog / pig in 
the farmer's eyes, taking the place of a bitter sheep dog named Rex. So 
the farmer decides to make Christmas dinner out of Rex instead and 
spare Babe's life... I'm lying, of course.</P>
<P>        The amazing thing about BABE is of course that they 
managed to make all the animals' lips move to appear as if they were 
talking, all without any form of electric shock. It's almost like "Mr. 
Ed" multiplied by a hundred, with talking dogs, pigs, horses (of 
course, of course), sheep and a duck who thinks he's a rooster. BABE 
has a wonderful surreality to it that makes it appeal to children and 
adults, with an intelligent sense of humor and saccharine sweetness to 
boot.</P>
