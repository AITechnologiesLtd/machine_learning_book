<P>     Big bugs are the order of the day in STARSHIP TROOPERS, an honest-
to-God, old-fashioned combat movie set in a retro, fascist future where
impossibly square-jawed grunts still carry machine guns, endure the
abuses of drill sergeants, and get sent away to exotic, faraway places
to be slaughtered en masse.  Okay, there is *one* thing that's new:  men
and women fight together.  And bunk together.  And even shower together,
as in a gratuitous, humorous boobs-n-butts bath scene from SHOWGIRLS
director Paul Verhoven.  Relax, Mr. V. is no longer orbiting the hirsute
moon of Eszterhas-- he's back in ROBOCOP territory, fusing social satire
with gory violence and, perhaps, pissing in the face of the studio's
target audience-- teenage boys already clogging the Internet with their
grousing nit-picks.  Granted, the director *is* poking fun at everything
that he can lay his hands on, but he's also trying to channel his own
wartime experiences as a youth.  So, while you *will* get the gore-- am-
putations, decapitations, eviscerations, and immolations-- be prepared
for cheesy dialogue, glaring plot holes, and, at the end, and just when
you think you've grown used to the tone, movie monsters that look like
giant human sex organs.  Hilarious.  Now, for *my* nit-picks:  occasion-
ally the action runs a bit long; the dramatics don't deliver quite
enough emotional impact; and, at times, I was distracted by actors aim-
ing their rifles a little too high to realistically hit their computer-
generated foes.  With Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Jake
Busy, Neil Patrick Harris, Clancy Brown, and a meaty Michael Ironside.</P>
