"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Most people don't realize that Eddie Murphy won the Best Actor award
from the National Society of Film Critics for his performance in The
Nutty Professor in 1996.  And it's not like there was a shortage that
year, either.  The NSFC passed up the likes of Billy Bob Thornton (for
Slingblade), Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient), Tom Cruise (Jerry
Maguire) and eventual Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush (Shine).</P>
<P>Was the NSFC off their cumulative rocker in '96?  Maybe.  But the group
has an uncanny knack for acknowledging deserving Academy Award nominees
(like Russell Crowe and Nick Nolte), as well as talent that Oscar just
plain overlooks (like Reese Witherspoon, Ally Sheedy and Bill Murray).
Their list of recent Best Picture winners reads like a who's who of
cinematic coolness (Being John Malkovich, Out of Sight, L.A.
Confidential, Breaking the Waves).</P>
<P>Even though his performance in The Klumps is even stronger than it was
in Professor, Murphy shouldn't clear off his mantle just yet.  After
all, The Klumps is a sequel to a remake of a Jerry Lewis film.  We're
not talking about your typical Oscar pedigree here, folks.</P>
<P>The Klumps takes the funniest and most memorable part of the first film
– the titular professor's four gassy relatives that are each played by
Murphy – and builds the movie around them.  Ordinarily, this would be a
recipe for disaster, but Murphy makes each of his characters so unique
and so witty, you almost forget that it's him underneath all of the
makeup and latex.</P>
<P>Murphy's performance aside, The Klumps isn't really that good of a
film.  Once again, Professor Sherman Klump (Murphy) is on the run from
his genetic alter ego Buddy Love (Murphy).  The film also features
storylines involving Sherman's horny grandmother (Murphy) and his
romantically challenged parents (Murphy and Murphy).  While the presence
of the additional Klumps shows off Murphy's wonderful skills as a
character actor, the script does nothing but serve as a launching pad
for a plethora of potty humor.</P>
<P>The Klumps opens with a dream sequence where Sherman is marrying a
fellow biology professor named Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson, Poetic
Justice).  After admiring his bride's ample cleavage, Sherman pops a
boner that turns into Buddy Love.  The next scene, where Sherman's
father has a retirement party at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, is more
lowbrow humor.  The meal is punctuated by burps, farts and talk of dick
size, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Before the credits start
to roll, you'll be treated to puke, flatulence, erectile dysfunction,
saggy boobs, bestiality and projectile turds, as well as nods to films
like Star Wars, Cape Fear and Armageddon.</P>
<P>The crux of the lame story, which was co-written by Barry W. Blaustein
and David Sheffield (Nutty) and Paul and Chris Weitz (American Pie),
focuses on Sherman's latest invention – a fountain of youth formula that
can actually make a person younger.  None of it makes sense, and the
inconsistent script has plot holes big enough for a Klump to fall
through.</P>
<P>On the plus side, Jackson is an improvement over Nutty's annoying Jada
Pinkett, although Pinkett probably wouldn't have insisted that her new
song be played throughout the film.  Larry Miller and John Ales reprise
their roles as Sherman's money-hungry dean and lab assistant,
respectively.  Directed by Peter Segal (My Fellow Americans), The Klumps
features some pretty funny outtakes during the closing credits, so don't
leave the theatre early.</P>
<P>1:45 - PG-13 for crude humor and sex-related material</P>
