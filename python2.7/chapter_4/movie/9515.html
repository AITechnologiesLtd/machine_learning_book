<PRE>THE FULL MONTY (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Paul Cattaneo
Writer: Simon Beaufoy
Starring: Robert Carlyle, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Addy, Paul Barber, Steve
Huison, Hugo Spier</PRE>
<P>"The Full Monty" is another one of those comedies from England that put
American comedies to shame.  Yes, we make funny movies over here, but
there's almost no debate that British cinema is funnier than American. 
And "The Full Monty" is a prime example of that.  It's not only a funny
film, but it's surprisingly engaging, touching, and, well, revealing. 
It's not the greatest film in the world, but it proves that even the
most cringe-inducing idea can be funny as hell.</P>
<P>"The Full Monty" deals with a group of urban Englishmen who were all
laid off from a once-prominent steel factory and are all seeking jobs. 
Their group "job club" meetings are pretty much wasted, with the old
foreman seeming to be the only one with any aptitude to get a job.  In
fact, the other guys waste time by trying to steel from the closed
factory, and even one of them is up for a bit of suicide.</P>
<P>The protagonist of the film (Robert Carlyle) comes up with a plan to
exploit his town's apparently popular Chippendales entertainment by
seeing if this group of normal-looking men (one of them actually being
quite fat) can raise money by stripping in an elaborate club, much like
Chippendales, all to hokey music and nice spotlights.  In an American
comedy, this would probably star Chris Farley and have him running into
a wall repeatedly and screaming at the top of his lungs for no reason
whatsoever.</P>
<P>But since Brits made this, and since Brits do have a better sense of
humor (it's a fact, okay?), this film is funnier more often, and also
has a bit of a brain.  Yes, this is a lovely concept for a comedy, but
it takes some intelligence to bring it to the screen in a good fashion,
and make the concept work out fully.  Luckily this film does.</P>
<P>There are six men who end up being in the dance/strip group, and they
are all explored interestingly.  They're not all explored in fullness,
but nevertheless interestingly.  The protagonist is a divorced father
who's wife has remarried some jerk, and who has a kind of buddie-buddie
relationship with his son, who hangs with him like they were chaps.  He
is, however, in danger of losing him due to a bit of a custody battle,
and needs some money to pay for it.  Hence, his motivation for getting
into this, other than paying for his smokes.</P>
<P>There's also a fat guy (Mark Addy), who is characterized as being rather
self-concious about his weight (and with good reason), and being a bit
suspicious of his much-thinner wife, who flirts with other men and likes
them Chippendales.  Then there's the ex-foreman (Tom Wilkinson) who
hasn't even told his wife he was fired six months ago, and who can
actually dance.  And there's also a rather quiet and lonely suicidal guy
who still lives with his mother (Tom Huison); an old black man
mysteriously nicknamed "Horse," (Paul Barber) who used to be quite the
break dancer; and a kind of studly guy (Hugo Speer) who can't dance,
can't sing, but who's favorite movie is "Singin' in the Rain" and also
has another formidable quality which is helpful in their "mission."</P>
<P>The ending of this film would be anti-climactic in a lesser film, but
here it's the high point, and it reaches it nicely.  It builds up to the
ending, and when it happens it not only delivers but adds some element
of surprise (will the men actually go "the full monty," if you know what
I mean, nudge, nudge).  And there are scenes that are absolutely
hysterically funny.</P>
<P>The acting is very good too.  The best performances come from Mark Addy
as the insecure fat man, and Tom Wilkinson as the former foreman who
starts off as tough and distanced (he was the foreman, man), but
eventually assimilates into their little microcosm.  But the film is
stolen by Robert Carlyle, who has the lead and does it so well.  He is a
bit immature, but has a kid who is more of a buddie to him than a son,
and who he kind of looks at as a peer (at one point when his son is kind
of ashamed of him, he comes across not only as being hurt since he's the
kid's father, but also as a friend).  Carlyle, you might remember, was
also brilliant as Begbie in last year's "Trainspotting," a role exactly
180 degrees away from this one.  To play a drunken asswhole then turn
around to play a somewhat immature divorced father/stripper just shows
that Carlyle is a great actor.</P>
<P>"The Full Monty" is funny as hell, but it's not totally funny.  There
are touches of melodrama (will the fat guy strip?), and the occasional
dramatic scene (a funny scene results in a bit of crying from one of the
strippers).  But overall, this film is hilarious, well-written, and
just-plain great.  And, the Brits are still funnier than us.</P>
