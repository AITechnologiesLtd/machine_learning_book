<PRE>"Over My Dad's Pottie!"
Rugrats in Paris - The Movie</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>I enjoyed this film so much, I wondered if it overshot the intended
audience. So I asked a few little tikes after the film. Two were too shy,
but their mom said they loved it. And the other one, he left the theater
singing, "Who let the dogs out!" the Baha Men's catchy chorus off the film's
soundtrack. That should clinch it then, a strong follow-up to the first
"Rugrats - The Movie."</P>
<P>The opening logo comes together in brilliant computer-animated ease forming
the familiar fun Nickelodeon-styled "Rugrats," then the lights dim as the
text changes to "The Godfather" font. You can expect this parody to pepper
spice the rest of this kids' flick. But there are plenty of other adult
ingredients, and two diapers full of pottie humor to go around for everyone.</P>
<P>After taking the consequence, Tommy is scorned by Angelica, "That's what you
get for winging your buggers on Susie." Undaunted Tommy smiles, "So that's
where I left 'em!"</P>
<P>Mr. Pickles gets a call from France summoning him to fix the huge
Godzilla-spoof robot he engineered for the Disneyland-spoof EuroReptarland.
Of course he takes the whole family. But this movie's star is really
Chuckie. Chuckie's need for a new mom compels him to search deep down and
find the courage to approach a beautiful princess. But he isn't the only one
scheming prospective partners for his single dad.</P>
<PRE>"What are dates?"
"Big raisons that make you poop."</PRE>
<P>Though most of the animation is painted in the old fashion 2-D style; the
colors are Starburst juicy, and the action paced for those with little tiny
attention spans - so don't expect to be bored. These little munchkins get
into everything! And of course, songs tie it all together. You'll no doubt
be singing "Who let the dogs out" during your walk to the parking lot. But
there are a few other notes of note as well: "Chuckie Chan," the dream
sequence ("He'll break up the party if he's not on the pottie"), and "Reptar
I love you" (a refreshing poke-funnery of those Disney classic odes).</P>
<P>Chuckie-full of juicy one liners, you'll have to keep your ears open:
"I love their fries and all ... but."
"See how nice his head stays on."
"It's a nerd, it's a pain, it's Angelica!"</P>
<PRE>Enjoy.</PRE>
