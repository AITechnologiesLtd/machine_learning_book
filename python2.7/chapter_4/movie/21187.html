<PRE>Waiting For Guffman (R) ***
Starring Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy
Directed by Christopher Guest        
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>The often confused genre of mockumentary, basically a scripted documentary is
often not understood by every Hollywood director. The concept of having
interviews with the characters, but forgetting not to give big glamour shots
and regular filmed footage has often been forgotten in films like Drop Dead
Gorgeous. But this is a fine display of what a true mockumentary should be.
Quirky, fun, and entertaining this story of a small town putting on a play of
it’s history is sure to entertain many, while still staying true to it’s
genre.</P>
<P>Corky St. Clair (Guest) is a gay director that has written an original
screenplay about the history of the little Missouri town called Blaine. Blaine
is one of those Fargo-type towns where every knows everybody else, and
everybody has the same mid-west accent. The auditions are the first major part
of a play, Corky is impressed by the town’s dentist, Dr. Allan Pearl (Levy) a
man who wears very, very big glasses and is equally stunned by the duo of
Sheila and Ron Albertson (Catherine O’Hara and Fred Willard) the man and wife
who can really sing. The production has six main players, with Parker Posey
(imagine an independent film without her) as a Dairy Queen worker round out the
bunch.</P>
<P>When a New York critic named Mr. Guffman (hence the film’s title) promises to
come and review it they get even more excited. But the production runs into
various problems, Corky insists on having the proper funding to take the show
to Broadway, one of the actors is taken out of the play at last minute, and he
can’t get Dr. Pearl to take off those darn glasses.</P>
<P>Why is it that everyone in a small town is so weird and quirky? For once if
Hollywood could make a movie that didn’t showcase them in this way. Not to
say that it isn’t enjoyable, this film is loaded with inside jokes and fun
characters. I especially liked Eugene Levy as the town dentist who ends up
singing songs to the elderly in Hebrew. But after a while some of the people in
this film just seem to be there to be annoying. Seriously, this people must
have some connection to the outside world. Waiting For Guffman also stays true
to the formula never cutting away to do something super and fantastic and
letting the characters interact and respond with the audience. If your looking
for a little quirky fun I suggest you rent Waiting For Guffman, which gets ***
stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: While not made to appeal to children, this comedy includes 2
f-words. Good Age 11 & Up</P>
