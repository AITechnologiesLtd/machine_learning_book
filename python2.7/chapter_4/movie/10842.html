<P>Deep Rising is one of "those" movies. The kind of movie which serves no
purpose except to entertain us. It does not ask us to think about
important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that
there is no god...screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer
generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable
booboos to a bunch of little known actors. Heh! Them wacky monsters ,
gotta love 'em. Of course , since we can rent about a thousand B movies
with the same kind of story , Hollywood must give that little extra
"oumph" to  get people in theaters. That is where Deep Rising fails ,
which is a good thing. Confused? Let me explain:</P>
<P>Despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , Deep Rising is
still , at heart , a good 'ol B movie. Luckily , it's a very good B
movie. The worst cliches in movie history are a B movie's bread and
butter. Therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually
help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre. Of
course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one
person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always
know which persons or person will make it out alive. We just don't know
when or how horrible it will be. </P>
<P>I went to see Deep Rising with my expections low and my tolerance for
bad dialogue high. Imagine my surprise when i discover that Deep Rising
is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times. A funny B movie? Well ,
that's new. These flicks are not supposed to make us laugh. (Except for
a few unintended laughs once a while.) And before you know it , Treat
Williams , Wes Studi and Famke Jansen appear on the big screen. </P>
<PRE>Hey! I know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies. Cool.
Familiar faces. 
So far so good.</PRE>
<P>Our man Treat is the hero , he'll live. Wes is a staple of B movies , he
is the token victim. We know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few
creeps with him on the way out. Famke is the babe , 'nuff said. There is
also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black
person ( B movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails
) and a very funny , nerdy guy. ( Ah! Comic relief. How can we possibly
explain having to kill him...let him live.)</P>
<P>After the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home. I know who to root
for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew. (Please kill me.) </P>
<P>Suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my
seat a few times , went "ewwww" about a dozen times and nearly had an
orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing.
I'm a man , we nottice these things. All in all , i'd recommend Deep
Rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain
at the door...but bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you.
The acting is decent , the effects top rate. </P>
<P>How to best describe it? Put together the jet ski scene from Hard Rain ,
the bug attacks from Starship Troopers , a couple of James Bond like
stunts and all those scenes from Friday the Thirteenth and Freddy where
you keep screaming "don't go there , he's behind you" and you end up
with Deep Rising.</P>
<P>Rating: 3 and 1/2 stars out of 5 for creepy crawly goodness , tight
t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every
fifteen minutes from seing all that water.</P>
