<P>Okay, so the film doesn't exactly have the catchiest title in the world, but
how could you go wrong with Harvey Keitel and singer/actor Jon Bon Jovi in
the same movie? Well, uhhm....okay, forget that! All you have to remember is
that this is a submarine movie, an action submarine movie, a fun, loud,
easy-to-swallow action submarine movie. Slap in handsome naked
pothead/bongo-man Matthew McConaughey, and you've got yourself a swingin'
time!</P>
<P>PLOT:
World War II is raging on when an American Navy crew is sent to overtake a
stranded Nazi U-boat (aka nasty sub), stuck somewhere in the middle of the
ocean. Their mission: to capture their unique decoding device.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A loud, fast-paced, simple story set within the always tense environment of
a submarine, featuring a lot of repetitive "sub-talk", great looking men in
cool Navy garb and the official christening of the summer popcorn flick
season. (Splashes) I can't say that much about this film surprised me, in
fact, I can't say that anything about it really did. But I suppose there are
only so many ways that one could tell a story in a sub. Lots of cramped
quarters, an all-male crew tossing jargon upon jargon back and forth, others
manning the electronic surveillance equipment diligently, everyone bracing
for impact, or hoping for the non-impact. The proverbial "dive, dive, dive"
bellow from the captain, the rookie member of the crew with his big moment
to shine, the captain's difficult decision to make, the staple scene of the
entire crew stripping down to their skibbies and getting "jiggy" with one
another. Well, okay...that last one was just to see if you were paying
attention! (Splashes)</P>
<P>All in all, the film does deliver on its intended purpose: to entertain. I
thoroughly enjoyed the film while I was there, liked the loud booms and
bangs of the detonations, felt like I was getting thrown around just like
one of the crew. Really liked the actors, McConaughey in particular, with
his great looks, great hair and subtle confidence...a perfect casting
choice. Keitel was also decent in his second fiddle role, as were the rest
of the dirty group, who all seemed real enough for me to care about.
(Splashes) Of course, the screenplay doesn't really get too deep in respect
to any of the characters, or the story for that matter (Nazis
bad...Americans good), but these aren't exactly the types of films which
accentuate character development. This film is about having fun, believing
what you see, being entertained and made especially for those who enjoy the
easy, crunchy, action movies. Admittedly, I could have done without the
umpteen shots of people staring at the sky waiting for the eventual
impact/non-impact or the cheesy dialogue here and there, but God bless
America, because this movie took my mind off my crappy problems du jour and
at the end of the day...that's what it's all about! Get the nachos, grab the
better half, spread some salsa all around and have yourself a good time!
(Splashes)</P>
<P>The (Splashes) references throughout my text are made to poke fun at a
recurring line from the film which was just too good to pass up. And for all
you Jovi fans who want to know how the man makes out in this film, allow me
to put your minds at ease, since he does deliver a pretty decent
performance. Of course, things do get a little slippery when wet, right?
(Sorry, but I just had to!)</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Jonathan Mostow recently dropped an email over at our good buddy
Harry Knowles' infamous movie site, and offered him some behind-the-scenes
pictures of the full-scale 600 ton diesel-powered submarine replica which
they built especially for this film. If you'd like to see the pics, visit:
<A HREF="http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=5693">http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=5693</A>
Actor Jack Noseworthy also starred in director Mostow's second picture
called BREAKDOWN starring Kurt Russell. Mostow's directorial debut came in
1989 when he helmed the comedy BEVERLY HILLS BODYSNATCHERS starring TV
"Alice's" own Vic Tayback. Incidentally, Jack Noseworthy was also featured
in a Bon Jovi video called "Always". Ironically, he co-stars with Jovi in
this movie.
Jon Bon Jovi's birth name is John Francis Bongiovi. Jovi lost the lead role
in CROW: CITY OF ANGELS to French actor Vincent Perez (Thank your lucky
stars, Johnny boy!).
Harvey Keitel is a great actor who is also known for showing off his
"goodies" onscreen in various pictures including THE PIANO, BAD LIEUTENANT
and FINGERS. Rock on, Harv!</P>
