<P>FOR LOVE OF THE GAME (M).  
(Universal/UIP)
Director: Sam Raimi
Stars: Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C Reilly, Jena Malone, Brian 
Cox, J K Simmons, Carmine D Giovinazzo, Larry Joshua
Running time: 137 minutes.</P>
<P>For the first time in a decade Kevin Costner returns to the
baseball diamond.  One would assume it's a sure-fire recipe for
success as two of his better movies - Field Of Dreams and Bull Durham
- have involved the sport of baseball.  While he may not exactly hit a
home run with his third time at the plate he doesn't strike out
either!</P>
<P>For Love Of The Game is almost two movies in one as it mixes
some exciting baseball action with the formula of the romantic drama.
It's a mix that proves unexpectedly compelling for much of its length,
but at over 130 minutes it loses momentum.  You don't need a detailed
knowledge of the intricacies of baseball to appreciate For Love Of the
Game, but you do need a bit of patience to endure the long and
eventually tedious flashback sequences tracing the romantic saga that
occupies half of the film's running time.</P>
<P>For nearly twenty years pitcher Billy Chapel (Costner) has
been the heart and soul of the Detroit Tigers.  A horrific injury to
his arm threatened to cut short his career, and he has only recently
returned to the team.  The long time owner is selling the team, citing
corruption and the increasing corporatisation that is destroying the
game as reasons for his departure.  Part of the deal involves trading
Chapel to arch rivals, the New York Yankees.</P>
<P>In possibly his final game in the sport to which he has
virtually sacrificed everything, Chapel has to make a momentous
decision - to quit while still on top or to continue with another team
and possibly watch his career decline.  Can Billy's ageing body and
aching arm also stand up to the strain to allow him to pitch the
perfect game and go out on a high?</P>
<P>The film unfolds in two strands - the defining baseball match,
and a series of flashbacks charting the romance between Billy and Jane
(Kelly Preston), a journalist who provided him with a perspective of a
normal life outside the game.  However, Billy's single minded
determination to heal his wound and return to the game eventually
created a rift in the relationship as Jane grew tired of coming second
to his love of the game.</P>
<P>Costner gives one of his best performances for some time here,
and projects the type of heroic brooding image with which he first
established himself.  He's more credible in roles like this than as
the saviour of a post-apocalyptic world!</P>
<P>For Love Of The Game is an uncharacteristic film from Sam
Raimi, a director better known for his gloriously apocryphylic horror
movies (The Evil Dead, etc) and his flashy, comic book-like visual
style.  Raimi's direction here is unusually restrained.  He manages to
suffuse the narrative with plenty of suspense as he takes us inside
Chapel's head for the strategy of this crucial game.  Raimi manages to
bring his usual visual flourishes to the film, and brings the baseball
sequences alive.  For Love Of The Game is quite manipulative,
especially in its use of Basil Poledouris' evocative, occasionally
stirring score.</P>
<P>Even those not normally fond of sports themed movies may find
themselves sucked in by the suspense and the rich emotional
undercurrents at play.</P>
