<PRE>Top Hat (1935)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 56</PRE>
<P>"Top Hat" was one of ten films that Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers made together, and is probably
the most famous of those films.  It was nominated
for Best Picture, and features songs by Irving
Berlin.</P>
<P>The plot has dancer Astaire working on a show
with producer Edward Everett Horton.  He romances
Ginger Rogers, who plays hard to get, mostly
because she thinks that he is Horton, who is
already married to Helen Broderick.  Astaire's
rival for Rogers is Erik Rhodes, who plays a
comic relief character, the pompous fashion
designer Beddini.</P>
<P>Astaire's vehicles are praised primarily for the
dance numbers.  Certainly, Astaire can glide
across a dance floor, and he can tap dance and
choreograph a production number.  It is apparent
that much effort has gone into his performance.
He knows how to sing, although his voice is nothing
special, and the songs have been painstakingly
composed, although bland from being stripped of
anything that anyone would find objectionable.</P>
<P>One of the dance numbers has Astaire shooting
a row of dancers with his cane.  Originality
like this is much more interesting to me than
watching Astaire flail his arms and tap dance,
which Bugs Bunny can do with more flair.</P>
<P>But most of the movie is dialogue, and if you
are renting the film for the dancing you will
need to do plenty of fast-forwarding.  The script
is average, with the plot based on a misunderstanding,
as if taken from an episode of "Three's Company".</P>
<P>The character with a thick foreign accent, Beddini,
is also the biggest jerk in the film.  Normally
this "co-incidence" would bother me, but I have to
admit that he is my favorite character in the film.
Director Mark Sandrich should have given him more
scenes.</P>
