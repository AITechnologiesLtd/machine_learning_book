<PRE>_The_Castle_ (R) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>  Although Roger Ebert has called it "this year's _Full_Monty_," I'm not
entirely certain that this Australian import will connect with American
audiences like that flashy British sensation of two summers ago.  In fact,
the comparison is entirely unfair, for this lower-key, character-driven
comedy is, for my money, better than that overrated fluke Best Picture
nominee.  The castle in question is the Kerrigan house, a modest abode
situated next to the runway of an airport and underneath a bundle of power
lines.  When a proposed airport expansion threatens to claim his happy home
and those of his neighbors, patriarch Darryl (Michael Caton) dares to take
his case to court.</P>
<P>To be honest, this simple and straightforward "little guy versus the
system" tale does not pack too many gutbusting laughs.  In their place are
smaller but ultimately more rewarding delights: a consistent stream of
giggle-worthy lines and situations and, best of all, a wide variety of
sharply defined personalities.  Proud and loving Darryl is indeed the main
character (played without a single false note by Caton), but the rest of
the Kerrigan family and the other peripheral characters are allowed to
carve out their own memorably quirky niches.  Making the strongest
impressions are Darryl's trading post-obsessed, "ideas man" middle son
Steve (Anthony Simcoe) and Darryl's incompetent lawyer (Tiriel Mora).
_The_Castle_ is as light and disposable as it appears to be, but there's no
denying how efficient (the film runs a scant 89 minutes), crowdpleasing,
and heartwarming an entertainment director Rob Sitch and writing
collaborators Santo Cilauro, Tom Cleisner, and Jane Kennedy have created.</P>
