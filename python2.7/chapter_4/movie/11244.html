<P>        Dark City is an imaginative, entertaining pre-cult film--intense and
visually absorbing.  It harnesses a lot of new ideas, some of which are
profound, and others absurd, but all are compelling.  I say "pre-cult"
because I imagine that Dark City, like Blade Runner and 2001, will
probably be a cult hit in a few years, and will be remembered in the
long run as great entertainment.  </P>
<P>        Rufus Sewell (whom I've only seen as Fortinbras in Branagh's Hamlet)
plays John Murdoch, a man who mysteriously wakes up in a bathtub and
doesn't remember who he is.  He receives a strange phone call from an
alleged doctor (Kiefer Sutherland) who tells him that he has no memory,
and that there are people after him.  John quickly makes it out of the
hotel and onto the streets of the Dark City in which he lives.  </P>
<P>        His objective now is to find out who he is; he finds out that he has a
wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and that she hasn't seen him in three
weeks.  Not long after this, he finds that he is wanted for the murders
of six women, though the detective in charge of that case (William Hurt)
isn't sure what to believe.  John, with the help of the doctor, is
finally allowed to know about an experiment of an extraterrestrial race
called the Strangers.  The Strangers' purpose is to understand the
effects of memories on human beings.  The Strangers have a power, called
"tuning," that allows them to alter physical reality.  Their interest in
John lies in the fact that he also has this power.</P>
<P>        For the first half of the film, I was impressed with the visual
presentation of Dark City, but completely disengaged from the story and
the characters.  I realized, though, that this is because even John
doesn't know who he is, and for us to sympathize with him, it takes more
time as he uncovers the details of his own past.  Later in the film,
there are scenes between John and Emma that are extremely moving, like a
moment in which he is talking to her through a pane of glass in a police
station.</P>
<P>        In fact, by the end of the film, I was impressed with how well all of
the characters are developed.  Sewell does a great job in the lead, and
with this film he proves that he is a solid leading man.  The beautiful
Connelly is as luminous as ever, and she truly shines in more than one
moment here.  Hurt is extremely dark and brooding (he has a lot of
screen time, but I think he opens his mouth twice); and Sutherland,
although he overacts (Peter Lorre syndrome, I think), he still manages
to be likable in his role.  Good characters is a very good thing in a
film that exists primarily to showcase masterful sets and special
effects:  it makes our enjoyment of the film effortless and smooth.</P>
<P>        Proyas has done a great job with the look of this film.  The city
itself is a deep and complex setting, just as interesting as any of the
human characters in the film.  Proyas, who also directed the visually
powerful The Crow, takes elements from other films such as Batman, Blade
Runner, and his own previous film, and manages to make a new and unusual
setting by extending on these concepts.  Some of the sets here--like the
Strangers' meeting place--are truly breathtaking.  And in the final
scenes we get to see the City from afar, and it is quite a sight.</P>
<P>        I do have issues with the science depicted here, though.  I'd like to
see what studies fuelled Proyas' ideas revolving around the memory, but
for some reason I don't think that our memories come in the form of
liquid.  There's also more than one instance later in the film that
doesn't treat basic concepts of physics with respect.  </P>
<P>        But, when all is considered, this is a fantasy film, and these are
allowed to extend beyond common cinematic boundaries from time to time. 
Dark City is a good, original film that I found very refreshing, given
the level of rehashed garbage that we've already gotten this year. 
Proyas--with his visionary, moving picture-style of direction--should
have a long life in the business.  </P>
