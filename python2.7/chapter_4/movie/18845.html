<P>The big crime committed by "True Crime" is one of excess, but it's
rarely severe enough to be labeled as wretched. This stately Clint
Eastwood thriller suffers from both an overlong running time and
eventually overcooked story elements, undoings that have also jumbled
recent directorial outings "Absolute Power" and "Midnight in the Garden
of Good" and Evil, and even suffers a bit from the Aging Matinee Idol
Factor - at 68, Eastwood's self-exuding machismo sometimes comes across
like a weird parody of itself, and the actor is way too old to doff his
shirt for a sex-aftermath scene. Still, he's in better shape than some,
a statement that also rings true for "True Crime."</P>
<P>Those who have seen the coming attraction and are aware of the whole
death row storyline know that "True Crime" looks about as promising as
"Dead Man Walking" with our man Clint in the Sister Helen Prejean role.
But surprise, surprise: Portions of the movie really hit home, even if
its ambitions are diametrically opposite to that deep, thoughtful
rumination on capital punishment. Dramatic sparks do occasionally fly as
Eastwood's Steve Everett, a newspaper reporter sorting through his share
of nasty personal problems (most involving a voracious lust for women),
maneuvers through a most difficult assignment - to chronicle the last
hours of life spent by a convicted killer.</P>
<P>Of course, this being a Clint Eastwood film, the set-up isn't as
meditative as it might sound. Everett is handed the article with little
prep time, just after the writer slated to take it dies in a sudden car
accident, but immediately senses that things aren't quite kosher. So,
with less than 24 hours left until the execution, he sets out on an
all-out quest to find out what really happened in this seemingly random
convenience store murder. Adding fuel to the fire is that the alleged
perpetrator (noble Isaiah Washington) maintains his innocence yet has a
double-strike criminal record and questionable ties to the victim, only
circumstantial evidence exists, and witness testimony is faulty at best.</P>
<P>Can clues and leads overlooked for six years be unearthed in time to
save a condemned man who very well might be innocent? Maybe not in the
real world, but there's probably a serious dearth of living journalists
with Eastwood's rough, squinty-eyed determination - an attribute that
serves both his character's plight and his dedication as a filmmaker to
deliver the goods. Here, those include a fine attention to detail and a
full-fledged sense of humor that often borders on surprising; most of
the laughs come from subplots involving the bickering between Everett
and his high-strung superior (James Woods). So good is this material
that you occasionally wish it were "True Crime"'s main focus.</P>
<P>Too bad most of the other discursions don't gel as well. Much is made of
the fact that Everett is fooling around with the wife of his aware
section editor (Denis Leary), but this aside provides little more than
prolonged manly glaring. Everett's failing marriage is also given
generous (and often questionable) coverage, bogging the narrative down
further, while random sidetracks involve penitentiary workers on a lunch
break, a randy homeless man whose footage seems cut from a completely
different movie, and Michael McKean as a intrusive prison chaplain. What
the latter is doing here is anybody's guess, especially since his comic
talents aren't rewarded with any kind of a payoff.</P>
<P>But as long as "True Crime" sticks to Eastwood's dealings with
Washington and/or Woods, it cranks out a fine flow of strong scenes,
even when they involve twists and revelations best described as
suspension of disbelief-reliant; this must be the first cinematic
mystery, for example, to hinge upon the location of a rack of potato
chips, while a key clue turns up with "something fishy here" literally
_inscribed_ on it elsewhere. Swallow goofiness like this and "True
Crime" ranks as serviceable matinee fare, as cool and cozy as it comes.
It could be Eastwood's relaxed-as-blue-jeans ardor paired with the overt
plot familiarity, but this must be the most comfortable
race-against-the-clock scenario ever.<HR></P>

"There is possibly an audience for this movie, but I have the oddest
feeling that on opening night the people in the theater will all be in
black and white. See ‘Pleasantville' if you wonder what I mean. In fact,
see ‘Pleasantville' anyway." -Roger Ebert on "I'll Be Home for
Christmas"</P>
