<PRE>                               JURASSIC PARK
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1993 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>     I didn't write a review of JURASSIC PARK when I first saw it for
many reasons, primary amongst them the fact that I was too busy
standing in wide-eyed amazement at the technological wonder of the
whole thing to pay the slightest bit of attention to the story, the
characters, the dialog, or really any part of the movie beyond the
truly amazing special effects.</P>
<P>     However, after sitting through the movie a second time, several
things came to mind, and I thought I would share them with the net.</P>
<P>     First of all, the movie actually moves along fairly slowly once
you know what's going to happen.  The first time through there is a
frenzied feel to the film, but once the element of surprise is gone,
the movie plods along.  This isn't like ALIENS where each viewing
manages to preach you right back on the edge of your chair all over
again, least ways not for me.</P>
<P>     If JURASSIC PARK is viewed as it should be, a special-effects
extravaganza with a thin envelope of story to hold it all together then
it succeeds marvelously.  If, however it is judged on the same merit
scale as other films, it comes up sadly lacking.</P>
<P>     There is a lot of preaching going on.  Spielberg spends an
inordinate amount of time drilling the same basic "don't f--- with
Mother Nature" theme into our heads.  There's no need, the action in
the movie is sufficient warning to all comers.</P>
<P>     The only characters (beside the T-Rex and the 'raptors) with any
real personality seems to be Dr. Slatter (Laura Dern), the rest are
just cardboard stereotypes that never seem to escape their predefined
molds.  Sam Neill is wasted, I think, in a role that almost any
half-talented actor could have pulled off.  Jeff Goldblum is either
too outrageous, or not outrageous enough -- hovering somewhere in a
morass of ineffectuality.</P>
<P>     I think the mistake Spielberg made was the mistake that Lucas
*didn't* make in STAR WARS, he forgot that no matter how great the
effects are, the movie still has to be about *people*.  With STAR WARS,
the last film to shatter the special effects window, the effects are
just there, literally the vehicles that the story just rides along on,
the story is still a people story.</P>
<P>     Spielberg had a choice, he could either concentrate on the
the 'raptors and make them real characters, as they were in the book, or
he could make a wonderful demo film for ILM.  Too bad he chose the later.</P>
<P>     Perhaps he should have looked at some of the classic
horror/monster flics of the past to see what he did wrong.  KING KONG
for instance, or perhaps more appropriate ALIEN.</P>
<P>     ALIEN was in many ways similar to JURASSIC PARK, "big-bad-monster-
on-the-loose" but it succeeded where JURASSIC PARK failed, in making a
movie that was worth seeing several times.  The only reason to see
JURASSIC PARK again is so you can sit back, relax, and really watch the
effects.  They're perfect.  They're wonderful, and they're all that's
there to see.</P>
