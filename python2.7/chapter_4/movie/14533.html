<PRE>                                 RONIN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A good director, a great lineup of
          stars, lots of action, explosions, car chases,
          crashing cars, and flames.  But RONIN also has
          almost no story beyond double crosses and murders.
          This is a film with minimal characterization.  John
          Frankenheimer gives us a film that is all sizzle
          and no steak.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     It would be hard to choose the best American political thriller.
Some people would probably pick THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and others
(myself included) would pick SEVEN DAYS IN MAY.  Both those films were
tense exercises in chills.  The two films came out within two years of
each other and both were directed by the same man, John Frankenheimer.
But that was 1962 and 1964 respectively.  For most of the rest of his
career Frankenheimer has turned out some decent films, but has shown
little of the promise that those two thrillers showed.  Each of those
films had memorable characters and a tense plot.  They had almost
nothing in the way of chases or gunplay.  The thrills all came from the
plot.  RONIN is like a film made by another man.  Somewhere behind all
the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa
plot, but we see only tiny pieces of it.  We get a clue here and one
there as to what is going on but J. D. Zeik's screenplay is a bit
obscure.</P>
<P>     The film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai.
When a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from
death, he becomes a ronin, much like a gunfighter in the American West.
If you miss the opening, do not worry.  This film will explain again
what a ronin is.  Sam (played by Robert De Niro) is the modern
equivalent of a ronin.  He is a free agent who seems to have really
good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional
killer.  He clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he
seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in France.  Sam is
recruited from a Montmartre bar by Dierdre (Natascha McElhone of THE
TRUMAN SHOW), an Irish woman, to be part of an action to steal a
mysterious metal case.  Dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in
the case.  Sam joins a team of four others: Vincent (Jean Reno of THE
PROFESSIONAL/LEON and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE), Spence (Sean Bean, TV's
Richard Sharpe, and also PATRIOT GAMES and GOLDENEYE), and Gregor
(Stellan Skarsgard of BREAKING THE WAVES and GOOD WILL HUNTING).  Also
along is Larry (Skipp Suddeth).  The group seems to know their
business, particularly Sam, but each is in his own way cold and
professional with his own field of expertise.  Their only human side
seems to be in tensions among the members of the team.  The story is
not very easy to follow.  It is never clear who is double-crossing whom
and who is working for whom.  Somehow Russians (who may or may not be
the Russian Mafia) and Irish radicals are involved trying to get their
hands on a certain metal case.</P>
<P>     Some very good actors are involved in this film.  One wonders what
they saw in the script.  The characters are mostly one-dimensional
professional killers.  They know their work, and seeing their thought
patterns adds some interest to the film, but for this group deep
feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that
neither is killed.  By the end of the film we never really got to know
anybody.  Maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts,
since these are not very demanding characters to create.  In addition
to the above characters the film also features Jonathan Pryce and
Michael Lonsdale (the latter of MOONRAKER and of the superior thriller
THE DAY OF THE JACKAL).</P>
<P>     As a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the
1960s, I was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and
enjoy.  Unfortunately there are no deep characters, and little to make
us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it.
I rate RONIN a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.
NON-SPOILER: Incidentally, the tale of THE 47 RONIN has been filmed
multiple times, usually under the title CHUSHINGURA or as THE 47 RONIN.
Also one frequently sees in Japanese art the image of a man breaking
down a door with a huge mallet.  This is the first blow of the 47
Ronin.</P>
