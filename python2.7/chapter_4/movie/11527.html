<PRE>                             THE BOXER 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                  2 :-) :-)  for the Irish way of life</PRE>
<P>Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Brian Cox, Ken Stott, Gerard
McSorley, Ciaran Fitzgerald
Director: Jim Sheridan
Screenplay: Jim Sheridan & Terry George</P>
<P>I usually dislike movies that carry a strong political agenda and when
it concerns the IRA, the feeling sinks even lower. For one thing these
movies contain too many bombings, innocent killings, human suffering and
unhappy endings for my liking. Too much gloom and misery may be
gut-wrenching informing, but it sure kills the entertainment in the
industry. Fortunately, THE BOXER is more than just a political
statement. Director Jim Sheridan shows us the feelings of loss and pain
within a very closed secretive, community of the IRA. He paints for us a
gritty world of genuine suffering with non-glamorised footage of the
Irish world - cold concrete walls, perpetual grey skies, the rattle of
machine gun fire in the distance and the cries of an unhappy nation
shouting for independence.</P>
<P>What makes THE BOXER different is its approach to the subject material
and also an outstanding performance from Daniel Day Lewis. It shows us
how willing young lives are sacrificed for the belief in a single
principle. It focuses on a man who is a victim of circumstance (Daniel
Day Lewis). After being imprisoned for twelve years, he tries to rebuild
his life after being released from the penitentiary. A poignant point is
made when he realises that the best years of his life have been taken
away from him, by and for the IRA. His potential to be a great boxer,
his future, his childhood sweet heart, all the missed opportunities. It
is heartbreaking to see this grown man try to salvage the remains of the
day and to pick up where he left of with life. Fortunately, he sees the
need for change, to unite Protestant and Catholic and sets about doing
it the best way he knows how – through boxing. One of the most symbolic
moments of the movie comes when Day Lewis is fighting an African in the
boxing ring. His opponent is beaten, but instead of going on to finish
the man with more strokes, he puts his gloves down. Basically saying
that there comes a time to stop fighting.</P>
<P>This is thought provoking material, despite the fact that the ending is
rather ambiguous. One isn't quite sure what happens to THE BOXER. Does
he leave Ireland or does he go back to his neighbourhood? Otherwise this
movie does make a valiant attempt to try to shed some unbiased views on
the entire Irish Republican Situation.</P>
