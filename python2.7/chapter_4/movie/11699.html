<PRE>BATMAN & MR. FREEZE: SUBZERO (1998)</PRE>
<P>Starring the voices of: Kevin Conroy (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Michael
Ansara (Mr. Freeze), Loren Lester (Dick Grayson/Robin), Mary Kay Bergman
[well, I'm... fairly sure it was her] (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl), George
Dzunda (Dr. Robert Belson), Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (Alfred Pennyworth), Bob
Hastings (Commissioner Gordon)</P>
<P>Not Rated (but it's probably a PG, just like the last animated Batman
film was)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Doug Skiles</PRE>
<PRE>Yes, it's animated.</PRE>
<P>That having been said, let it be known that possibly the greatest
interpretation of Batman to hit tv or movie screens IS the animated Bat
that first appeared in the fall of 1992 on Fox.  It quickly became a
prime time series before hitting the big time - an animated theatrical
release film.  That was BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM (1993).  Clearly,
it was and still is the best Batman film to yet hit theaters.  The plot
was intelligent, the action loud and exciting, the voice-acting perfect,
and the score beautiful.  </P>
<P>As of this year, on TV, Batman has moved his animated adventures to the
WB network.  Characters have grown, and, most noticably, design styles
for many of the characters have changed - mostly for the worse.  As a
result, for both those who watch the series, and those casual Bat-fans
who have only seen the first animated film, this second animated feature
(which has gone straight to video), BATMAN & MR. FREEZE: SUBZERO, is
like reuniting with an old friend.  The film tells a story that takes
place before the current season of the show and after the final season
on Fox, so the character designs the like are all in line with those of
the earlier part of the series.  Only better animated than usually seen
on the show.  This is a level of animation slightly under that seen in
BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM but still slightly higher than that seen on
the tv series.  One thing this movie does have other MASK OF THE
PHANTASM is more use of computer animation.  There's a CG submarine,
Batwing, and highway scene for your viewing pleasure, and all of them
look very nice.</P>
<P>Of course, animation comes secondary to plot.  Plot, action, dialogue,
and of course, acting are what drive a film.  Well, on the old Batman
scale, SUBZERO is not quite as good as PHANTASM was, and maybe not even
as good as the first two Tim Burton live-action films, though that could
be debated.  It's certainly much better than the last two Joel
Schumacher films - and it's truer to the characters than any of the live
action films to date.  The plot goes that Mr. Freeze's wife, Nora Fries,
still in cryo-sleep, has her stasis tube broken open in an accident. 
Now Freeze knows that the only thing that can save her is an organ
transplant.  He enlists the help of Dr. Belson, and, when no deceased
donors of Nora's rare blood type are found, Freeze decides that he will
use a live donor - which of course, will kill said donor.  There's 18
live donors of Nora's blood type in Gotham.  And one of them is Barbara
Gordon.</P>
<P>Luckily, Barbara only appears in Batgirl garb for about one minute near
the beginning of the movie, and stays out of costume for the rest while
Batman and Robin try to save her - and she tries to save herself.  The
whole thing is better animated than most of the non-Disney stuff you see
(Well, those big-time other-studio releases like ANASTASIA [1997] not
withstanding, I guess) and has that same simple-yet-beautiful character
design of the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons from the days of yore. 
All the characters are well-done.  Of course Batman is cool, but wow, so
are Robin and Barbara.  Now THAT'S a feat.  Belson is interesting, and
Mr. Freeze is cold and emotionless, as he should be, thanks to Ansara (I
promise he's not at all jokey, like Schwarzenegger), and overall, I
assure you, this is a much better experience than that Schumacher piece
of crap BATMAN & ROBIN (1997) that had many of the same characters.  </P>
<P>In all, though it runs a too-short 67 minutes, and yes, it has
appearances by Batgirl and Robin (come on, you *know* that Robin isn't
always a bad character), this is still definitely worth a rent... and if
you're a big Batfan... it's worth a purchase.  Watch it, then rewind,
and enjoy it again.</P>
<P>Hey WB... you want a good Batman film to add to your live-action
franchise?  WHY NOT PUT PAUL DINI AND BRUCE TIMM IN CHARGE?!</P>
