<PRE>THE INVISIBLE CIRCUS
--------------------</PRE>
<P>Phoebe O'Connor (Jordana Brewster, "The Faculty") remembers the magic her 
late father (Patrick Bergin, "Sleeping With the Enemy") and her sister Faith
(Cameron Diaz) brought into her life as a little girl.  Now eighteen and
living alone with her mother (Blythe Danner), Phoebe needs to understand
her sister's death, a purported suicide which took place halfway around the 
world.  After provoking her mother to tears, Phoebe runs away to Europe to 
retrace the steps of Faith and her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston, 
"Elizabeth"), the pair who once brought her "The Invisible Circus."</P>
<P>"The Invisible Circus" is one of those movies that you can enjoy in a numb
way on a rainy day when you're sick in bed.  Watching it is like having a
book read to you by someone who can't enliven his voice above a monotone.</P>
<P>Writer/director Adam Brooks ("Almost You") clearly exposes a source novel
(by Jennifer Egan) by his use of extensive voiceover narration and
flashbacks.  Phoebe tells us how wonderful things were when she was a 
child, even as she lets slip that both she and her mother were kept at
a distance from dad and Faith's close relationship.  Rebellious Phoebe
dares to suggest Mom didn't understand her own husband as much as she,
his daughter, did as a child.  Once in Europe, the narration is given over
to Wolf, who fills in the parts of her sister's story that Faith's postcards
glossed over, in an ever tightening circle.  An affair of proximity/comfort
is fallen into.</P>
<P>Some liveliness is added to the proceedings by the flashbacks taking place in 
the tumultuous 60's and the present action taking place on location in Paris, 
Berlin and Portugal.  Yet even these aspects aren't fully realized, as
much discussed drugs are nowhere to be seen in the flashbacks and a present
day acid trip in Paris is handled embarrassingly.</P>
<P>Brewster isn't bad as the central character whose search for truth ends
with some image shattering reality.  The camera certainly loves her dark,
exotic looks.  Diaz is also OK as the idealistic Faith whose desire to
change the world leads her down an ironic path.  (The two's contrasting
dark and light looks can be explained away by the casting of their parents.)
Unfortunately, Diaz and Eccleston, a usually fine actor, never really seem
to connect except on a superficial level.  Eccleston seems like a nice
guy in a long haired hippie wig with Faith and simply uncomfortable in his
later scenes with Brewster.  Still, he adds a bit of class to the proceedings.</P>
<P>At least Brooks keeps things moving along at a fairly steady pace, although
things begin to drag a bit as the climax approaches.  Cinematography by Henry 
Braham ("Waking Ned Devine") presents a bright San Francisco but rather
dank looking Europe.  Landscape is kept to a minimum in favor of close
character shots.</P>
<P>"The Invisible Circus" is both overwraught and undercooked.</P>
