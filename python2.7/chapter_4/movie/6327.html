<P>     RANSOM is director Ron Howard's first venture into the action 
thriller genre, and, although he's working with a solid cast and an 
auspicious premise, his attempts to emulate suspense maestro Alfred 
Hitchcock fall short.  The reason is simple -- it's impossible to 
believe that Howard (PARENTHOOD, APOLLO 13), whose name is synonymous 
with epic adventures and feel-good comedies, would ever allow an 
innocent child to be murdered.  Hitchcock had no such compunctions (see 
SABOTAGE if you doubt this), and that's a trait that separates his 
thrillers from this one. </P>
<P>     It's pretty unfair, however, to damn RANSOM by saying that it 
doesn't live up to Hitchcock's standards -- how many movies do, after 
all?  RANSOM isn't a bad thriller, it's just not a great one.  There's a 
little too much pointless running around, a subplot that leads nowhere, 
and a certain creeping predictability that argues for a shorter running 
length.  On the other hand, strong acting, smart dialogue, and a couple 
of neat twists counterbalance many of RANSOM's weaknesses. </P>
<P>     The script, which is based on a 1956 movie of the same name, has 
been re-worked by novelist Richard Price (CLOCKERS) to bring it up to 
date.  The film's noir quality is supplied by the camerawork of longtime 
Kieslowski collaborator Piotr Sobocinski (DECALOGUE, RED).  There are 
numerous instances when Sobocinski's heavy atmospheric contributions are 
effective in enhancing the grim, almost-claustrophobic mood. </P>
<P>     Mel Gibson, in his first role since BRAVEHEART, is Tom Mullen, the 
CEO of Endeavor Airlines, the world's fourth largest carrier.  He's a 
devoted family man, paying more than lip service to his love for his 
wife, Kate (Renee Russo), and son, Sean (Brawley Nolte, son of Nick).  
One day, at a New York City school science fair, Sean is kidnapped by a 
gang of four (Lili Taylor, Liev Schreiber, Evan Handler, and Donnie 
Wahlberg).  Handcuffed and blindfolded, the boy is held in a small, 
windowless room.  From this hideout, the group's ringleader, corrupt cop 
Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinese), makes his $2 million ransom demand.  And, 
while money is the primary issue, the struggle between classes is also 
involved.  Shaker sees himself as striking a blow for the hard-working 
man against the rich and overprivileged. </P>
<P>     Tom calls in the FBI.  The agent in charge of the investigation, 
Hawkins (Delroy Lindo), advises paying the ransom.  At first, Tom 
agrees, but, as time passes and the situation becomes more desperate, he 
begins to believe that Sean is already dead.  Finally, no longer 
trusting the cops and worried that he's being played for a fool, he 
makes a stunning decision. </P>
<P>     Since there's no way Sean is going to be killed (or a Disney-owned 
company never would have released the movie), the most compelling 
questions relate to how he will be recovered and whether anyone will die 
attempting to save him.  Howard wrings a surprising amount of tension 
out of this cat-and-mouse material.  There are times when RANSOM is 
genuinely gripping, most notably during the scenes in and around Tom's 
fateful decision.  We can also be thankful that Howard spares us a lame 
whodunit.  We know the kidnappers' identities from the beginning, and 
this eliminates the necessity of peppering the plot with distracting red 
herrings.  The ending could have been steeped in unexpected irony, but 
the script opts instead for a conventional resolution. </P>
<P>     At least one subplot is worthy of a more detailed exploration than 
it receives.  Early in the film, it's revealed that Tom participated in 
the illegal bribery of union officials to avoid a strike.  An accomplice 
went to jail, but, by denying involvement, Tom kept his hands clean.  
The kidnappers use this incident to peg him as a "payer", someone who 
would rather buy his way out of trouble than take a risk.  Beyond that, 
however, little is done with this information, and, eventually, it's 
forgotten about.   </P>
<P>     The strength of RANSOM lies in the performances.  Mel Gibson is 
easy to believe as a desperate father who will do anything to get his 
son back, and who is tormented by the potential consequences of a wrong 
decision.  Renee Russo, who has refined her acting skills since last 
appearing opposite Gibson (in LETHAL WEAPON 3), holds her own, although 
her role isn't especially meaty.  Gary Sinese fashions a chillingly 
complex villain who's both ruthless and intelligent.  And Delroy Lindo's 
effective secondary character reminds us of the stakes in Tom's "game". </P>
<P>     With recognizable, popular names like Ron Howard and Mel Gibson 
involved, RANSOM is all-but-guaranteed to bring a huge financial 
windfall to Touchstone Pictures.  Only those who approach this film with 
expectations of something with a real edge will be disappointed.  The 
movie delivers the kind of mainstream entertainment likely to generate a 
positive buzz.  And, for better or worse, that's the most I've been able 
to claim for any of 1996's overhyped blockbusters. </P>
