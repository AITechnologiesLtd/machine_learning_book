<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a silent serial told in 10 chapters about subversive vampire
thieves as they suck the
blood out of sleeping bourgeois Parisian society, stealing their jewels
in novel and innovative ways. The public loved these films, until the
"talkie" pictures came into being and this film was forgotten until
rediscovered in the 1950s by Henri Langlois and in the 1960s by
directors such as Alain Resnais and Jacques Rivette.</P>
<P>The vampires are led by the irrepressible Irma Vep (Musidora), her name
being an anagram for "vampire." Musidora was a former Music Hall star,
whose raven hair and seductive looks suited her villainous black-garbed
heroine role in contrast to the sugary sweet blond American heroines at
the time, who starred in popular serials such as The Perils of Pauline
and The Exploits of Elaine.</P>
<P>The films were shot cheaply and swiftly in the Gaumont studios and on
the surrounding
Parisian streets. The combination of lyrical, odd scenes of naturalism
and the melodrama of a crime-fiction story, as the film is full of
disappearances and disguises, sudden deaths and uncanny resurrections,
hidden trapdoors and secret tunnels, bus chases and rooftop escapes-
which gave the film its power, its sense of dread (perfectly matching
the public's mood at the time of World War1). And it was that, coupled
with their almost anarchistic view of society (the Vampires steal only
from the rich), and their often contemptuous disregard of logic (the
result of tight shooting schedules), that made the films so popular. Les
Vampires was treasured by Surrealists like Andre Breton and Louis
Aragon, which gave it weight in intellectual circles, also.</P>
<P>The serial ran into some trouble with the Parisian Chief of Police, who
had one of the film's episodes banned for glamorizing the criminals.
Feuillade, the former cavalryman and journalist, atoned for his sin with
more moralistic films in the future, such as his Judex (1916).</P>
<P>LES VAMPIRES is one of France's great classic contributions to the world
of cinema; and fortunately, this once lost film has now been restored
and is available on video.</P>
