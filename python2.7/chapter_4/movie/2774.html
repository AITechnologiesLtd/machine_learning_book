<P>     When considering this movie, a word analogy comes to mind.  FEAR
OF A BLACK HAT is to CB4 as THIS IS SPINAL TAP is to AIRHEADS.  Having
said that, I can assure you that two of those films (BLACK HAT and
SPINAL TAP) won't be mentioned again in this review.  AIRHEADS isn't
worth the comparison.</P>
<P>     Observing how fertile the field of heavy metal music is for
satire, it's disappointing to watch AIRHEADS bumble around, desperately
trying to find something funny to say.  Even sadder is the continuing
nosedive of director Michael Lehmann's once-promising career.  It's
hard to believe that this is the same man who brought us the delicious
black comedy HEATHERS (then again, he was also responsible for HUDSON
HAWK).</P>
<P>     The premise of AIRHEADS sounds promising.  Three musicians of
limited intelligence (Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler)
break into a radio station and hold the DJ (Joe Mantegna) and manager
(Michael McKean) at gunpoint to get their demo played.  Things go
wrong, however, and when the police show up, the "Lone Rangers" have to
take hostages.  One problem, though.  Their real-looking weapons are
actually water pistols.</P>
<P>     Despite a chuckle here and there, most of AIRHEADS isn't worth the
film it was processed on.  It requires an effort to avoid gritting
one's teeth as obvious comic opportunities are allowed to pass by
untouched.  On the other hand, most of the jokes actually offered up by
the script are either unfunny, obvious, or both.  The overt stupidity
of the three leads is amusing for a little while, but it doesn't take
long for this trait to become tiresome.</P>
<P>     AIRHEADS is not a good parody.  Its comedy has no real edge, and
consistently avoids risks.  On those rare occasions when the film takes
a stab at being outlandish, it is funny, but that doesn't happen too
often.  Most of the time, AIRHEADS flounders around trying--and
failing--to be humorous.  In that way, it's a lot like 1993's CB4, a
rap parody that was more dumb than witty.</P>
<P>     The cast contains some surprisingly good performers.  Joe Mantegna
is a respected name, but this is his second low-brow film in a row
(BABY'S DAY OUT being the other).  Steve Buscemi (of RESERVOIR DOGS)
and Ernie Hudson also have roles.  Brendan Fraser, the film's resident
heartthrob, displays little comic timing.</P>
<P>     It's hard to determine how much heavy-metal fanatics will enjoy
this film, since the music isn't really the point.  Then again,
considering the confused nature of AIRHEADS, it's a little difficult to
determine whether or not this film has a point.  Anyway, regardless of
who the target audience is, the filmmakers appear to have missed it.
Considering the poor quality of the production in general, and the
screenplay in particular, AIRHEADS appears to be an apt title.</P>
