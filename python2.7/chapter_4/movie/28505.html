<PRE>"Sexy Beast" -- Tough as Nails
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>If you thought that British films lacked a certain
edginess, then this should come as a shocking and a
pleasant surprise.  After all, with recent slushy fare
like "Billy Elliott" and "Bridget Jones's Diary," you
might think that British films have the feel of a
Three Musketeers candy bar.  Remember their slogan? 
Fluffy, not stuffy.  </P>
<P>Well, you won't find any fluff in "Sexy Beast."  The
stuff inside is a gritty, foul-mouthed film noir about
Gary (Ray Winstone), a retired gangster, who is
mercilessly coerced into performing one last heist. 
This is a tough-guy film for people who like tough-guy
films.</P>
<P>Gary has built a comfortable life for himself and his
wife with the fortune that he has amassed from his
previous jobs.  Residing in his idyllic Spanish
hillside villa, his toughest task seems to be trying
to avoid sunburn while lounging by his pool.  But an
afternoon dip, dinner with his wife, and drinks with
his friends are all that he wants.</P>
<P>His general state of bliss, however, is about to be
shattered when a former colleague visits him.  It's
none other than Don Largo (Ben Kingsley), a ruthless
criminal that needs Gary for an ambitious bank heist
back in London.</P>
<P>Wait a minute.  Can the words "ruthless" and "Ben
Kingsley" actually be used in the same sentence? 
Didn't he win an Oscar for his role as the irenic
Gandhi?  He has built his career on roles that
required quiet intensity.  Here, he is as tough and
threatening as they come.  Don't let that wiry frame
of his fool you.  There is more meanness packed within
that body than there is in a dozen junkyard dogs. 
It's quite a startling transformation.</P>
<P>It is this element of "Sexy Beast" that will grab your
attention.  Don looks like he could easily be snapped
in two.  Meanwhile, Gary has the build of a bear.  But
our likeable lummox is easily overmatched by Don's
brusque methods.  He continually backs down in fear as
Don first asks, then demands, and then threatens for
his involvement.  Much of this film centers on this
volatile fox-and-hound relationship.  Gary meekly
tries to sidestep the pressure, but Don's verbal
assault, which brims with curt yet poetic gangster
invective, is fearfully intimidating.  As the vicious
hoodlum continues to press and as the reluctant
retiree continues to retreat, we hope that Gary
somehow manages to survive this predicament.</P>
<P>While "Sexy Beast" showcased a great, dark turn by
Kingsley, there were a couple of things that were very
distracting.  The language was absolutely appalling. 
Its vituperative nature frequently made me
uncomfortable rather than awestruck with Don's
menacing nature.  There were some absurd moments of
comedy to break this cycle, such as banter that
revolved around falling boulders, goats, and
hairdressers.  But you can't get over the mountain of
foul language.</P>
<P>Even more difficult to filter through might be the
heavy Cockney brogue spoken by the actors.   It takes
a bit of concentration to understand what everyone is
talking about.  So, it becomes a tough exercise when
you have to absorb the foul language in addition to
the somewhat indecipherable accents.  Like Gary who
needed to work really hard to make Don understand his
situation, we may need to work equally hard to
understand the film's finer points as well.</P>
