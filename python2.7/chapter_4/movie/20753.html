SERPICO
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In one of my previous reviews I mentioned SERPICO as one of
the most important films of the 1970s. Perhaps it was an
overstatement, because that film means very little to people
who didn't actually live or were too young to remember that
particular time period. But in its time anything involving
the real life story of New York police detective Frank
Serpico was a big news. In 1972 that story first became a
best-seller book by Peter Maas and, one year later, found its
way to the silver screen under the direction of respected
film- maker Sidney Lumet. The success of the movie was such
that the producer, Dino de Laurentiis, even created
short-lived television series starring David Birney few
years later. Of course, the main reason why people still
remember Serpico after more than a quarter of a century is
Sidney Lumet's film.</P>
<P>The plot begins with the shooting of Frank Serpico (played
by Al Pacino), New York undercover policeman. Serpico, while
being treated in hospital, starts remembering his police
career. He started as young, idealistic policeman whose
nonconformist views often clashed with conservative views of
his colleagues and superiors. In the turbulent decade of
1960s, his reputation of black sheep is enhanced with his
image, totally different from the regular cops - he grows
long hair and beard, wears hip clothes and takes interest in
exotic arts and philosophies. To his conservative superiors
he claims that this is the best way to work undercover in
rapidly changing society. But the outside appearance isn't
the only thing that bugs his colleagues. Serpico is man of
principles and he not only refuses to take bribe, like
almost any other plain clothes policemen do, but he also
wants to put the end to such widespread corruption. Mostly
ignored by the top police brass, he does things that are
strictly forbidden by unwritten laws of New York police - he
blows whistle to outside agencies and media and later
testifies against his colleagues. The word gets out and
Serpico becomes marked man among all New York policemen, who
are all more than willing to set him up during his life
threatening undercover assignments.</P>
<P>Sidney Lumet made a lot of different films in his long
career, but they often share a common themes or settings.
Lumet seems to have certain fondness for New York and its
burning social problems, as well as rampant moral ambiguity,
most often associated with police and political corruption.
SERPICO is one of such films, and it was made in a
especially favourable time. Early 1970s were the era of
Pentagon Papers and Watergate, when America as a society
stopped taking the established perceptions of itself for
granted. In such times, when everything was questioned,
there was a hunger for people ready to expose the darker
side of American dream. Frank Serpico was one of such
perfect heroes - he didn't just expose police and
establishment corruption, he as a personality with his hip
image was antithesis of everything associated with
conformist, pre-1960s America. And Serpico's life story -
his quixotic struggle against establishment, personal
courage and martyrdom, made him not just a perfect hero of
the public, but also a perfect protagonist for socially
important movie like those Lumet used to make in 1970s.</P>
<P>The name most often associated with SERPICO, of course,
isn't his director Lumet. The icon of this film is Serpico's
alter ego in the form of Al Pacino, young Italian American
actor who was just beginning his rise towards Hollywood
acting pantheon after his brilliant debut in GODFATHER.
Pacino here worked very hard in order to make a role very
different from the one he had in Coppola's masterpiece. And
he succeeded, at least in making the screen personality of
Serpico authentic, if we are to believe real Frank Serpico,
who was very pleased with the portrayal of his character.
Pacino plays Serpico as an idealistic, low-key but stubborn
character, who is hero, but never superman - he has his
doubts, he gets angry and depressed, and often drowns
himself in self-pity, making the life very miserable for
everyone around him. Pacino's performance was so strong,
that he had managed to overshadow almost every actor around
him; on the other hand, it wasn't that hard, since the
script by Oswald Salto and Norman Wexler left place for only
minor roles, often filled by good, but this time hardly
noticeable character actors.</P>
<P>Direction by Lumet is superb, with the splendid use gray and
dark scenery of New York locations; they serve as perfect
illustration for this serious and often depressing story.
Sadness is also underlined with the touching musical score
by Mikis Theodorakis, with the Mediterranean motives that
illustrate Serpico's humanity and noble ideals. The script
by Oswald Salto and Norman Wexler, on the other hand, is the
weakest part of the film. Serpico's background is mentioned
in the beginning, than mostly ignored through the film. Time
given to the depiction of Serpico's private life is too long
and it often gets in the way of his real story (especially
when he has to deal with many, often hardly recognisable or
established characters).</P>
<P>However, despite all that, SERPICO is one very brave,
socially critical film that asks important questions.
Unfortunately, time that had allowed such films is behind
us. These days, Hollywood wouldn't touch such depressing and
non-commercial subjects with ten-foot-pole and Serpicos of
our time could see their screen incarnations only in
television and cable movies. Which is sad, but, in the same
time guarantees good reputation of SERPICO for future
generations of film-lovers.</P>
