<PRE>THE MASK OF ZORRO (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson
Copyright 1998 Steve Kong</PRE>
<P>Zorro is the first true action hero of this summer, and maybe of the last
few summers. And for the price of admission you get not one Zorro, but two!</P>
<P>A detailed explanation of the underlying plot for The Mask of Zorro is an
exercise in futility. It deals with Don Montero (Staurt Wilson) trying to
buy California. The story that drives the movie is that of the relationship
between the elder Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) and the new Zorro (Antonio
Banderas).</P>
<P>Each Zorro has his own problems to solve. The elder Zorro wants revenge on
Montero for killing his wife, stealing, and raising his daughter. Young
Zorro seeks revenge against a corrupt US Calvary man, Captain Love (Matthew
Letscher), for killing his brother. Young Zorro is also romantically
attracted to Elder Zorro's daughter. The daughter of Elder Zorro, Elena
(Catherine Zeta Jones) was stolen and raised by Don Montero. She slowly
finds small clues to who she is.</P>
<P>Though there are some gun fights in The Mask of Zorro, the largest chunk of
action uses swords and not guns. This makes for some exciting swashbuckling
fun, unlike many of the films currently playing onscreen. I was happy to
see a movie that does not rely on gunfights to generate excitement. Kudos
to director Martin Campbell for keeping the sword fights exciting and fresh
instead of going the gun battle route.</P>
<P>Talking about Campbell, he seems to be the guy that can revive anything. He
has a knack for making so-old-it's-cool type films. Campbell's last film
was GoldenEye, which single-handedly revived the James Bond franchise. Now,
it looks like he has also revitalized the Zorro franchise.</P>
<P>As kids, my sister and I watched re-runs of the black and white Zorro
episodes on TV, so I was quite delighted to see that there was going to be
a big screen version of Zorro. I stepped into the theatre expected a lot
and was not disappointed when I left.
What can you say about Anthony Hopkins? To begin with, he is one of the
best actors around. And with Zorro, he shows that not only can he act, he
can handle swordplay with no problems. Hopkins is wonderful in The Mask of
Zorro.</P>
<P>Antonio Banderas has not had a real big-screen hit, but I believe The Mask
of Zorro will be his first. Banderas lights up the screen with his casual
charm. He is the perfect Zorro. What I loved about Bandera's Zorro was that
the character was suave, but also had some flaws. Look for the scene in
which he is surround by an army of men after trying to steal a horse. Also
look ashe tries to jump onto his horse like the elder Zorro.</P>
<P>The one to watch for is Zeta Jones, though. A relative newcomer to the
bigscreen, Zeta Jones lights up the screen. She has a zest that is
indescribable. The chemistry between her and Banderas is some of the best
I've seen lately. I love the scene in which she catches Banderas's Zorro
trying to steal a horse.</P>
<P>The script by Terry Rossio, Ted Elliott, and John Eskow has enough action
to keep our attention. The dialogue is snappy and funny. The script is
somewhat convoluted and hard to understand, but this really doesn't matter
because of Campbell's excellent direction. The film runs a bit long and
there are things that feel out of place. For instance, the Montero's gold
mine looks so fake that it feels as if it belongs in some Las Vegas hotel.</P>
<P>The score by James Horner is well done, especially taking into account that
his last score for Deep Impact was as generic as it could be. The score for
The Mask of Zorro is quite listenable.</P>
<P>Overall, The Mask of Zorro is an exciting film and a good escapist movie.
It is a fun film and I highly recommend it for everyone who is sick of all
the gunfights in motion pictures lately. The swashbuckling sword fights are
worth admission itself, but the movie producers decide to give us more and
give us two Zorros for the price of one.</P>
