<PRE>_The_Green_Mile_ (R) *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>_The_Cider_House_Rules_ (PG-13) ***</P>
<P>Of my six years of attending press screenings, the film that has
received by far the largest ovation at the film's end was
_The_Shawshank_Redemption_, Frank Darabont's 1994 adaptation of Stephen
King's prison-set novella.  Exquisitely written, directed, and acted, the
film was one of the most soul-stirring and moving motion pictures to
emerge from this decade, going on to earn seven Academy Award
nominations.  While the film ended up not winning a single statue (a
heinous snub if there ever were one), the film's esteem has only grown
through time, becoming on video the hit the film never was at the box
office.</P>
<P>With such a tough act to follow, it perhaps is no surprise that only now
has Darabont come out with his next film, which, as it happens, is also
an adaptation of a Stephen King prison story.  _The_Green_Mile_ shares a
number of other qualities with _Shawshank_, but one of them is not its
astounding excellence; not many will label the new film as the instant
classic its predecessor was.  But freed from the inevitable comparison,
on its own terms _The_Green_Mile_ is a very poignant and well-told tale,
albeit one not without its flaws.</P>
<P>As in _Shawshank_, the film is set in the past (here, 1935) and focuses
on an unlikely friendship that develops behind prison walls.  However,
the relationship here is between one Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), the head
guard of a stretch of Death Row called "the green mile"; and John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan), a an inmate convicted for the grisly murder of
two young girls.  Bulky and seven feet tall, Coffey certainly looks like
the type who could commit such a despicable crime, but his gentle
demeanor is a complete contradiction--as are the miraculous powers he
appears to possess.</P>
<P>This element of the fantastic is a fairly outlandish twist for a story
set on Death Row, but the turn is completely believable because Darabont
takes the time to strongly anchor his characters in reality.  However, he
takes a bit too much time; while getting to know and spending the time
with such colorful folk as Paul's guard cohorts and Coffey's fellow
inmates is rewarding, it could have been just as so in less the time.</P>
<P>The same can be said of the entirety of _The_Green_Mile_.  Execs at
Warner Bros. made a big deal about how they did not feel the need to cut
down the film after it received remarkably high marks at its first test
screening; even so, some trimming is clearly in order.  Granted, the
three-hour-plus film, bookended by scenes with an aged Paul (Dabbs Greer)
in the present day, consistently holds the interest and has an
unquestionably powerful emotional payoff.  But none of the film's virtues
would have been diminished with some careful pruning of the runtime.  In
fact, a shorter, less leisurely paced version would just bring its
strengths into clearer view.</P>
<P>And what strengths they are, particularly in the acting department. 
Hanks has become such a reliable dramatic performer over the years that a
good performance from him is hardly a surprise; needless to say, there
are no shocks here, and his trademark everyman quality makes him an
instantly likable and relatable lead.  More impressive, however, is the
much-buzzed-about work by Duncan, perhaps heretofore best known for his
supporting role in _Armageddon_.  Not much is learned, if anything at
all, about Coffey's past, but that Coffey is made into a believable human
being rather than a walking dramatic construct has a lot to do with
Duncan's vivid performance.  Just as good as the two leads are the
supporting players, all of whom shine.  Bonnie Hunt acquits herself well
in an uncharacteristically serious role as Paul's devoted wife; newcomer
Doug Hutchison is chilling as sadistic guard Percy Wetmore, as is Sam
Rockwell as psychotic inmate Wild Bill; and Michael Jeter is touching as
inmate Del, who takes in a pet mouse.  Gary Sinise also has a nice cameo
as Coffey's public defender.</P>
<P>With so much talent aboard, from the great cast to the solid storyteller
that is Darabont, perhaps expectations were trumped up to an unrealistic
level.  It goes without saying that _The_Green_Mile_ is no _Shawshank_;
after all, what is?  To give that easy criticism is to discount what
Darabont and his crew have accomplished, which is craft a heartfelt fable
that pushes all the right emotional buttons.  Long before its release,
_The_Green_Mile_ has been touted as the movie to beat at the Oscars, and
while I cannot honestly say that it's the best film I've seen this year,
it would certainly be a worthy winner.</P>
<P>The studio that is usually the one to beat during awards season is the
scrappy Disney subsidiary Miramax, and a lot of their awards hopes are
pinned on _The_Cider_House_Rules_.  An adaptation of John Irving's
highly-regarded novel (Irving also wrote the screenplay), _Cider_ is the
story of Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who is raised as protege
to one Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) at St. Cloud's orphanage.  Dr.
Larch hopes Homer will follow his path one day and assume his position at
St. Cloud's, but after the young couple of Cathy Kendall (Charlize
Theron) and Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) stop by to take care of a
private matter, Homer decides to leave with them and experience the
world.  That he does, landing a job on Wally's mother's orchard while Dr.
Larch tries to cope with life without his surrogate son.</P>
<P>_Cider_ tackles a number of issues--abortion being the foremost--and
does so in an efficient manner, never detracting from the main story of
Homer's journey to self-discovery.  The film as a whole is an admirable
and enjoyable one, highlighted by superb performances, in particular
those of Delroy Lindo (as Homer's superior at the orchard) and, in a
surprisingly strong debut, R&B chanteuse Erykah Badu (as Lindo's
daughter).  But while a good film, _Cider_ is far from the great one
Miramax and director Lasse Hallström were hoping it would be, marred by
an unconvincing romantic subplot between Homer and Candy.  The
relationship is a keystone in Homer's growth as a person, but Maguire and
Theron have so little chemistry that it is never once believable.  If
_Cider_ is this year's big Oscar gun for Miramax, à la _Shakespeare_in
_Love_ and _The_English_Patient_, then I don't think that the house the
Weinsteins built will be adding too many more, if any, gold statuettes to
their collection.</P>
