<PRE>                                 THE CLIENT
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<P>     The third, and by far the most successful translation of a John
Grisham legal suspense novel to film.  A tough little trailer park
pre-teen named Mark Sway (Brad Refro) happens upon the suicide of a
mafia attorney and is almost instantly caught between mob hitmen and a
remorseless federal prosecutor (Tommy Lee Jones).  Mark shrewdly hires
himself a lawyer--and is lucky enough to get Reggie Love (Susan
Sarandon), a woman who has lost so much by surrender that she is now
willing to risk everything to win big.</P>
<P>     The story is at bottom just as hokey and nearly as piously
legalistic as THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF, but director Joel
Schumacher cannily finds the best in it.  He finesses the violence,
putting all of it off camera, and concentrates instead on character and
relationships, specifically the one between Mark and his damaged but
utterly determined lawyer Reggie--a part that Sarandon seizes with
joyful abandon.</P>
<P>     The film, particularly the first two-thirds, is filled with
wonderful setpieces: the opening confrontation with the fat, suicidal
lawyer (Walter Olkewicz) in his car; Mark's visit to a decrepit roach
motel of an office building, full of shady shysters; almost every scene
with Jones as U.S attorney "Reverend" Roy Foltrigg directing his
supporting crew of worried yes-men; and every confrontation between
Sarandon and Jones. (Jones essentially clones his character from "The
Fugitive"--and is every bit as much fun to watch as he was in that
film.)</P>
<P>     The director and screenwriters (Akiva Goldsman and Robert
Getchell) eventually get into trouble following the novel too
faithfully.  All those threats and atmospherics eventually have to pay
off in some kind of action scenes--and Grisham's books seem to have the
least resourceful assassins in the genre.  The letdown, however, is
almost welcome.  In what must be the most over-pyroed, over-stunted
year in the history of the medium, Schumacher sticks with people
instead of falls and explosions, and makes it work.</P>
