<PRE>"America's Sweethearts" Lacking Chemistry
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>There are three problems that suck all the fun out of
"America's Sweethearts," a romantic comedy with enough
star power that should light up a city.  First, Larry
King, who provides a two-minute cameo, gives the most
zestful performance among the reputable ensemble cast.
 On his show, he lustfully berates his guest, film
actress Gwen Harriston (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  She's
a beautiful and an accomplished celebrity, but her
stardom has faded over the past two years.  Why?  As
call-in listeners will tell her, they lament and
complain about her previous decision to separate from
her popular husband, film actor Eddie Thomas (John
Cusack) in favor of a Castilian boy toy (Hank Azaria).
 Eddie, shattered by that incident, has become a
permanent fixture at a secluded Serenity Institute
where he is taught peace, gratitude, and unfathomable
words of wisdom ("life is like a cookie," says its
wizened leader).</P>
<P>Second, the most intriguing character, Lee Phillips
(played by Billy Crystal), is swept aside into
obscurity by the end of the film.  Lee is a lubricious
press agent who is tasked with assembling a blowout
press junket for the estranged couple's last film.  At
first, he seems to provide a welcome dimension of
edginess to a somewhat uninspired film.  Watch him
scheme and put his plan into motion as he coddles,
appeases, maneuvers, and exercises damage control. 
This formidable task requires wit and energy. 
Unfortunately, he is eventually relegated to flippant
one-liners and crude sight gags with a Doberman
pinscher.</P>
<P>Third, the center of this film (the real reason we're
going to see it) never generates any real momentum. 
This involves a budding love triangle between the
narcissistic Gwen; her frumpy but sweet sister, Kiki
(Julia Roberts); and the neurotic Eddie.  But the
tension is only lukewarm.  In fact, the best scene of
the film is given away if you've seen any of the
trailers.  It's really no contest between the two
siblings.  Kiki's character is the only one grounded
in reality, and becomes the only person that you begin
to care about. </P>
<P>All of this overwrought melodrama makes much of the
film uncomfortably ham-fisted. The first 30 minutes
(when we meet the major characters in their individual
environments) are especially corny rather than funny
and sadly laughable rather than amusing.  It strains
for laughter and the interplay between the characters
feels laborious.  </P>
<P>All of these actors are much better than this material
would suggest.  Zeta-Jones was delicious in "Traffic";
Roberts charm was played to perfection in "Notting
Hill", and you'll miss Cusack's unique brand of
quirkiness, offbeat humor, and wry behaviorism from
films past.  Perhaps, this role was a bit too
mainstream for him.</P>
<P>"America's Sweethearts" failed to evoke that
indescribable feeling of joy, weirdness, and goodness
that are the necessary ingredients in a love story. 
Partly, Roberts could not particularly shine as she
was obscured behind the star power of the other
actors.  Partly, the film spends too much time as a
lampoon about the junket scene (where multitudes of
critics ask the same questions, eat for free, and
think up quotes like "America's Sweethearts Lacking
Chemistry").  Thus, the film lacked conviction and its
tone becomes fuzzy.  Sometimes it's cute.  Sometimes
it's clever satire about Inside Hollywood.   But more
often, it's just unremarkable.  Ultimately, it's
inability to generate more than just some fleeting joy
will leave you heartbroken.</P>
