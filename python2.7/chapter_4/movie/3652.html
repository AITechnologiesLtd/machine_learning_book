<PRE>                          DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>Director: John McTiernan
Editor: John Wright, A.C.E.
Starring: Bruce Willis, Samuel L.  Jackson, Jeremy Irons</P>
<PRE>(*) (*) (*) ( )</PRE>
<P>     It's about midway through DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE when Zeus,
played by Samuel L. Jackson, asks Bruce Willis's John McClane, covered
with distasteful grue, if he's okay.</P>
<PRE>     "I'm all right," Willis responds. "It's not my blood." </PRE>
<P>     That pretty much sums up the operating principles of DIE HARD 3, a
focused bloody action machine of a movie.  The film is so tightly
trained on Willis's cop caricature that nothing else beyond his status
as everyday guy caught up in extraordinary
circumstances--again--matters.  No mention is made of the number of
casualties when a New York City department store is blown to bits in
the middle of the day; we're told no one is killed when an explosion
sends a subway car careening through a Wall Street station; subsequent
acts of brutality are just par for the course.  McClane gets bloodier
and grimier, but he just likens himself to the Energizer Bunny and
takes on another thug.</P>
<P>     Only when the mad bomber suggests that schoolchildren will be the
target of his next attack does anybody's death seem to matter.  Oh,
yeah--the mad bomber.  The story, such as it is, concerns a German
military type (Jeremy Irons) who blows up a midtown Manhattan
department store and then phones in to police headquarters demanding to
speak to McClane, who has been suspended from the force in an alcoholic
haze.  A police shrink explains to the cops and the audience that this
German guy is a psychopath with an obvious vendetta against McClane.
Somehow McClane got on the terrorist's bad side, and the bomber's now
out to make his life hell, sending him charging uptown and downtown,
beating the clock and solving riddles and brain teasers to find and
defuse bombs in the city.</P>
<P>     The first half of the movie is delicious--especially so, I
suspect, for New York audiences, who are treated to a terrific paranoid
fantasy set in familiar locations.  One great scene involves a pay
phone and a trash can at 72nd and Broadway, and another shows why the
quickest route downtown is through Central Park.  It's a little
disconcerting to see Willis wandering through Harlem in his underwear
and a sandwich board boasting a racial epithet--the bomber's first
attempt at humiliating him and perhaps getting him killed--as though
Quentin Tarantino has now made movie houses safe for slurs.  It's not
so much the use of an ugly word as it is the feeling that the scenario
was borne from laziness, a need to jump-start a script (by allowing
pawn-shop owner Jackson to save Willis's life) that takes a few
halfhearted NYC-style swipes at racial issues.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, DIE HARD 3 has inventive performers backing up
Willis's star turn, since they have to make up for Jonathan Hensleigh's
script, which is lacking in almost every regard.  Jackson extracts a
real soul from Hensleigh's Angry Black Man (With a Heart of Gold) paper
doll, and becomes the high-strung nerve center of this movie in the
same way that he was the pumping heart driving Tarantino's PULP
FICTION.  Irons -- ever the trooper--has it even worse, in a role that
should be clever and snide but is instead reliant on Hensleigh's rote
dialogue.  Worse, we're never sure whether his stated intention of
revenging himself on Willis is a red herring, since the connection
between them is so incidental and contrived that it matters not one
whit to the story (which was not originally a DIE HARD film).  Irons
never has the good sense to have his adversary shot in the head when
the opportunity presents itself, but at least the script never puts him
and Willis together in a little room to beat the crap out of one
another.  That's something.</P>
<P>     But let's face it.  The script, tepid as it is, is just a coat
hanger for Willis's bloody, grimy, T-shirted exploits, and the exploits
are pretty fantastic.  DIE HARD director John McTiernan, brought back
alive after his foray into megabomb territory with THE LAST ACTION
HERO, takes some interesting chances with straightforward material.
The best scene by far is an ultraviolent set piece in an elevator that
shows the clear influence of Hong Kong crime films, perhaps by way of
(him again) Tarantino.  The culmination of one long scene in an
aqueduct is a cartoony coincidence that qualifies oddly as dream
logic.  Editor John Wright undertakes some energetic cross-cutting as
the New York police force and Willis, many miles away, both work to
defuse an especially nasty bomb, and we get some artsy time compression
in the weirdest places, courtesy a series of jump cuts and funny
dissolves.</P>
<P>     The verdict?  What we have here is a pretty good movie that falls
apart as it moves toward its episodic conclusion, as though whole sections
of the story were dumped.  The story and especially the dialogue are major
liabilities (as is Michael Kamen's stupid, militaristic score), but we're
treated to the work of performers who can pull it out in a pinch.  Did we
mention Bruce Willis?  Anyone who still has the chutzpah to argue with
Willis-as-working-class-hero just doesn't understand American action
movies--and his solid performances in PULP FICTION and the wonderful
NOBODY'S FOOL prove that he is, indeed, very talented.  This one's a good,
exciting flick, and it probably bodes well for the future of action movies
that have a little more there there, if you know what I mean.  And I hope
these folks understand that we really, really, don't need to see DIE HARD
4. </P>
