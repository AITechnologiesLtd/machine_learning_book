<PRE>                         FINDING FORRESTER
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Gus Van Sant returns to the
          familiar territory of GOOD WILL HUNTING with a
          retread of that concept.  This time the genius
          is a ghetto boy and basketball star who hides
          the fact he is one of America's best writers.
          While there are a few nice moments the film
          reeks of a filmmaker who is desperate to have a
          successful film.  Sean Connery stars as J. D.
          Salinger type who helps the hero develop his
          talent.  Van Sant respects great writers but
          desperately needs one himself.  Rating: 4 (0 to
          10), 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Two films back Gus Van Sant had a large success with GOOD WILL
HUNTING.  The public seemed to go in a big way for this story of a
blue collar mathematics genius. (Mine was one of the few dissenting
opinions and mostly for the unlikelihood of the premise.)  Van
Sant's follow-up made a definite thud with an almost scene-for-scene
remake of the classic PSYCHO.  PSYCHO is one of those films that one
ought not to remake.  Van Sant needs another success to show that
GOOD WILL HUNTING was not just a fluke.  He really has to have
another GOOD WILL HUNTING.  Sadly that is rather transparently what
he was trying a little too hard to make.  He took the premise of his
former success and doctored it to be an even surer success.  First
he plays the race card.  This time his hero is not just a blue
collar worker, he is a really deserving sixteen-year-old black
writer who is trying to succeed in an academic world dominated by
white males, some of them nasty.  Coming to a new and posh school a
rich white girl takes an interest in our young writer, and you know
immediately they are going to hit it off.  Why?  Van Sant is taking
no chances.  If they fight the script will have to make one of them
right.  It can not make a white right in a conflict with a black or
a man right in a conflict with a woman.  Neither would be safe
filmmaking, so the clearly can be no conflict between the two of
them.  Then to make the film even safer there is a big part for Sean
Connery as a great writer who takes our deserving lad under his
wing.  Connery makes few films that do not succeed and here he even
was one of the producers.  Retread concept, political correctness,
and Sean Connery: this is Van Sant playing it super-safe.  Oh, yes,
and did I mention there is also a "big game"?</P>
<P>     Outwardly, Jamal Wallace (played by Robert Brown) seems like
just about any other ghetto kid.  Well, he is great at basketball.
But privately Jamal likes to read the great works of Western
literature.  And then he has his notebooks where he writes his
thoughts that he does not want to share with the world.  In this
Bronx neighborhood there is a strange old man who never leaves his
apartment.  He just stares out the window at the passing parade and
does who knows what else.  He just looms as a presence over the
neighborhood.</P>
<P>     On a dare Jamal breaks into the strange apartment and is about
to steal something small to prove he was there but is frightened off
leaving behind his backpack with his writings.  The old man
eventually gives the backpack back, but the notebooks have been
marked up with the critical comments that could only come from a
great writer.  It is the kind of tutelage that Jamal desperately
wants.  The recluse turns out to be the great William Forrester
(Sean Connery), the J. D. Salinger-like writer who wrote one great
novel and then never published again.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile Jamal has attracted the attention of a prestigious
school who wants the students for his basketball skills and only
secondarily for the potential that his test scores show he has.  But
there is pressure in the new school to push Jamal into the
basketball track while his writing teacher Professor Crawford (F.
Murray Abraham) finding his writing getting better and better
bigotedly suspects Jamal of cheating.</P>
<P>     There is not doubt that the best part of the film is the
writing lessons which are written with insight.  Suggestions like
writing first from the heart and then rewriting from the mind sound
useful, though they may be a little obvious.  And they are a special
treat delivered by the charismatic Connery who, though not known for
his writing ability, has the hypnotic style that would make even
toilet repair sound enthralling.</P>
<P>     This is the second film I have seen this year photographed by
Harris Savides, the other being THE YARDS.  I definitely see a
pattern forming.  Both are films in film noir style with overuse of
dimly lit scenes.  Many of the scenes really seem to be carved from
the darkness.  In Forrester's apartment the lighting is so muted
that shadows on Connery join with the background darkness.
Crawford's classroom is also filmed in dim and downbeat style.
Scenes are frequently washed out.  It feels to me like this is
manipulation, though in a better film it might more sympathetically
be called style.  In any case there seems to be an excess of it
here.</P>
<P>     By trying too hard to be successful, this film rarely rises
above mediocrity.  I rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the
-4 to +4 scale.  I did like the writing lesson, but with that
exception everything I ever needed to know about FINDING FORRESTER I
got from watching the trailer.</P>
