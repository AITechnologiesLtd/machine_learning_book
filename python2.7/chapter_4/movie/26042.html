<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>It would be easy to dismiss "The Way Of The Gun" as just another rip-off
of Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction". Indeed, it would also be quite easy
to praise it as a worthy successor, and reviewers have taken both
approaches. But the similarities between the two movies are superficial at
best, limited to their avant-garde approach to violence, mixing bloodshed
with clever dialogue. Whereas Tarantino's masterpiece was an essay in
absurdism -- contrasting discussions of European fast food with a brutal
mob hit, for example -- "The Way Of The Gun" is more a reinterpretation of
a genre than a subversion. "Way" is, at its most essential, a post-modern
western. The movie by which it is most inspired is not "Pulp Fiction" but
rather "Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid".</P>
<P>"Way" and "Butch" share a number of similarities. Most obviously (if
somewhat obscurely for those not intimately familiar with the 1969
film) is the fact that the main characters in "The Way Of The Gun" go by
the names Mr Parker and Mr Longbaugh, the civilian identities of the Paul
Newman and Robert Redford characters in the earlier film. Both movies
feature likeable outlaws who give up their traditional way of life in
search of greater glory. "We stepped off the path," says Parker in "Way",
"and went looking for the fortune we knew was looking for us." In both
pictures, the main characters concoct ambitious plans which go
unexpectedly and appallingly awry. And the two films each portray the
passage of the western into new times: "Butch" was set at the sunset of
the Wild West era, "Way" depicts a western of modern times.</P>
<P>Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) are drifters in
search of the big prize. While earning small change donating sperm, they
learn of a woman (Juliette Lewis) who is being paid one million dollars to
act as the surrogate mother for the baby of the wealthy Chidducks. They
decide to kidnap the woman and hold her for ransom. But what they do not
realise is that Chidduck (Scott Wilson) is a money launderer with 
nefarious ties. Soon they are being pursued by Chidduck's singleminded
bodyguards and his veteran bagman, Joe Sarno (James Caan).</P>
<P>"The Way Of The Gun" was written and directed by Chris McQuarrie.
That McQuarrie assumes both key creative roles is the movie's blessing and
its curse. McQuarrie clearly understands the intricacies of his story
intimately. This results in a number of wonderful scenes of delightful
originality, often railing against the cliches of the genre. Every crime
movie must have a car chase, for instance, and McQuarrie obliges. But when
the scene comes, it is not a typical reckless race down a busy city 
street. Instead, McQuarrie's take slows the spedometer down to just a few
miles an hour, and takes place not on a freeway but in labyrinthine
alleyways. It is less a chase than a cat-and-mouse game, and is a
marvellous slice of cinema.</P>
<P>It would be tempting, indeed, to label "The Way Of The Gun" as a "thinking
man"'s crime movie. This is true not so much because the plot is
particularly complicated -- it isn't, and what twists and turns McQuarrie
does throw at the viewer are mostly related to character rather than
incident -- but because the film is populated by thoughtful, 
well-conceived individuals none of whom feel as though they've been  
summoned up out of stock.</P>
<P>The best of these is probably James Caan's Sarno, a wise master of the
business who has learned to divorce business from personal time. At one
point, he confronts his prey (Longbaugh) in a bar, and the two spend the
night conversing about their shared trade. "The only thing you can
assume" about a man his age, Sarno tells Longbaugh, "is that he's a
survivor." McQuarrie's script is peppered with such gems.</P>
<P>McQuarrie also demonstrates that he is as capable a director as he is a
writer. There are some well-crafted shots in "The Way Of The Gun", such as
a slow pan from a crowd of Chidduck's subordinates, setting off in hunt of
Longbaugh and Parker, up to Chidduck's wife, watching from a window.</P>
<P>But, as indicated, McQuarrie's role as both scripter and director is a
mixed blessing. This is most evident in the pacing of the movie, which
feels sluggish from start to finish and is especially torpid in the middle
third, before the action moves to a Mexican hacienda and even more "Butch
Cassidy" comparisons are invited (whether this includes Parker and
Longbaugh sharing the fate of their namesakes is left for the reader to
discover). "The Way Of The Gun" is a movie desperately crying out for an
objective viewpoint amongst its creators, somebody to recognise the
strengths of McQuarrie's screenplay while cutting down on his excesses.</P>
<P>The result is a film that lacks momentum, that spends so long in transit
that it is easy to miss the pleasant stops along the way. This is not
helped by the fact that, apart from Caan, none of the other actors quite
manage to establish themselves in the movie (though Del Toro comes 
closest, and his scene with Caan is especially impressive). Phillippe and
Lewis, amongst others, are disappointingly inconsistent -- very good in
places, never less than okay, but often fading into the background. Dylan
Kussman, as a gynecologist with secrets of his own, feels as though he's
just stepped off the bus from the prep school.</P>
<P>The result is that "The Way Of The Gun" is wildly uneven. It possesses
some truly remarkable moments, but these are trapped in an undisciplined
concoction, like nuggets of gold peeking out from the mud. McQuarrie
clearly has all the tools needed to be both a fine writer and a fine
director, and I have little doubt that he will one day create a movie 
which showcases both disciplines at their best. "The Way Of The Gun"
demonstrates that that day isn't here quite yet.</P>
