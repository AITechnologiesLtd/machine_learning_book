<P>1999 has been a stellar year for animation, bringing viewers the
exhilarating and heart warming adventure, "The Iron Giant," Disney's
kinetic version of "Tarzan," the outrageous "South Park: Bigger,
Longer and Uncut" and the American release of the Japanese epic,
"Princess Mononoke." To cap off this surfeit of riches, we now have
"Toy Story 2," a terrific sequel to the smash 1995 story about the
private lives of toys.</P>
<P>The original "Toy Story" initially drew a great deal of attention for
being the first totally computer animated film, then became an instant
classic because it was a marvel of warm, clever storytelling. "Toy
Story 2" does its parent proud, delivering 92 minutes of smart, zippy
entertainment. The characters are even better defined than in the
original, the action is fast and furious and there are loads of laughs
in this remarkably inventive movie.</P>
<P>Director John Lasseter and his associates at Pixar clearly understand
what makes for a winning sequel. They touch on treasured moments from
the original without repeating them, and allow the characters to grow,
while retaining the qualities that made us love them in the first
place. "Toy Story 2" is that rarest of birds; a sequel as good as (and
some will argue, better than) the original.</P>
<P>As with the first film, the story is deceptively simple. While young
Andy is away at camp, his cherished cowboy doll Woody (Tom Hanks) gets
stolen by a toy collector (Wayne Knight, nicely portraying the greedy
mindset of those who hoard toys for their investment potential). A
rescue team is quickly organized and action figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim
Allen), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (John
Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), and Slinky Dog (Jim
Varney) hit the city streets to save their friend.</P>
<P>While stashed away, Woody learns of his illustrious history and has a
crisis of conscience. Seems he was a TV celebrity in the '50s,
starring in a "Howdy Doody" style puppet show, and has an extended
family from the glory days: spunky cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack),
Bullseye the horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey
Grammar). Jesse pleads with Woody to stay; explaining that if he
escapes, she will be put back into storage, the purgatory for
neglected toys.</P>
<P>The story contains an amazing number of riotous set pieces, none of
which I will reveal here. Suffice to say that everything satisfying
from the original returns with clever twists, and the new additions to
the family of toys are most welcome.</P>
<P>In this cavalcade of delights, I have only two minor
criticisms. First, both films would have been better served by keeping
the human characters offscreen (as the adults were handled in the
various "Peanuts" TV shows). While great strides have been made in
computer animation, they still can't create convincing humans and the
presence of partially realized people is distracting. Second, as with
Pixar's "A Bug's Life," the latter portion of "Toy Story 2" gets a
little busy. In their quest to satisfy the audience, the filmmakers
try a bit too hard and the pace becomes needlessly frenetic. The folks
at Pixar need to realize that they are working with magic here and
with magic, simplicity is the key.</P>
<P>I want to stress that these are minor quibbles. "Toy Story 2" is a
triumph, blending bright, eye-popping animation, exceptional work from
its voice talent and wildly imaginative writing (peppered with
hilarious pop culture references) to create one of the best films of
the year. Those who dismiss the movie as "kid's stuff" are doing
themselves a disservice. Like the original, "Toy Story 2" is a
treasure for everyone.</P>
