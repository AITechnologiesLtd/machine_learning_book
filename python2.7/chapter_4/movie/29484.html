<PRE>HARDBALL
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Michael Robbins' Hardball is quite the cinematic achievement.  In about
two hours, we get a glancing examination of ghetto life, a funeral with
a heartfelt eulogy, speeches about never giving up, a cache of cute kids
(including a fat one with asthma), a hard-luck gambler who finds
salvation in a good woman and a climactic "big game," where the
underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined.</P>
<P>All that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to
have the first film solely based on cinematic clichés.  I can't wait to
see the deleted scenes when it comes out on DVD.</P>
<P>Obviously, Hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat
anywhere near the ball.  It stars Keanu Reeves as the aforementioned
gambler, who seems to owe every bookie in Chicago an amount of money
that rivals the gross national product of Guam.  Out of solutions, he
begs his successful corporate friend (the always welcome Mike McGlone)
to lend him $5,000.  Instead, McGlone offers Reeves the chance to help
him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly
stipend.</P>
<P>Reeves, who wants to keep his fingers, accepts the offer, but discovers
McGlone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely.  The
drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the
baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs.  And
maybe, just maybe, they'll play in the big championship game.</P>
<P>One of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by John Gatins (Summer
Catch), adapted from Daniel Coyle's non-fiction book, is that there
aren't any.  The movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment
like a zombie.  That wouldn't be so bad, if the characters had an ounce
of subtlety or humanity to them.  Most of the kids' time is spent
yelling at each other, talking in slang and acting surprised.  There's
little that's naturally amusing about them, as they all seem to know the
cameras are rolling.  The worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger
player (DeWayne Warren) whose sole purpose, as the movie unfolds, is
being an emotional pawn, a tactic so utterly despicable I can't find the
right words to express myself.</P>
<P>The adults also don't fare well.  Reeves is impressively uninspiring as
the down-on-his-luck loser.  The character is poorly written, but Reeves
gives another charisma-free performance.  Every time he speaks, he
sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up. 
Kids are supposed to rally around this guy?  Diane Lane, who co-stars as
Reeves' obligatory love interest, remains a glowing screen presence (see
My Dog Skip for better proof).  It's too bad that her role here consists
of uttering lines like, "These kids trust you, and they don't trust
anyone!"  Then there's D.B. Sweeney as an evil rival coach and John
Hawkes as Reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters
you've seen before and hope never to see again.</P>
<P>I wanted Hardball to be good.  Robbins' Varsity Blues was a funny and
alternately taut tale of Texas high school football that had Ali Larter
smothered in whipped cream and Jon Voight sneering at everything that
moved.  I haven't seen Robbins' goofy Ready to Rumble in its entirety,
but I am intrigued that "Macho Man" Randy Savage and Martin Landau can
exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide
repercussions.</P>
<P>Robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies
for guys and not cutesy, cuddly pap such as Hardball, which also manages
to annoy and insult the audience.  Here's hoping that happens in the
immediate future.</P>
