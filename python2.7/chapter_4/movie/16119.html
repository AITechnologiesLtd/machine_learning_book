<P>To understand Rounders, you have to understand the work of Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi.  Csikszentmihalyi is not a great filmmaker or novelist,
but a professor at the University of Chicago who studies creativity.  He's
best known for his 1990 book, Flow:  The Psychology of Optimal Experience.</P>
<P>Professor Csikszentmihalyi's work focuses on what he terms "flow", that
state where people reach their peak experience.  Flow occurs when our
skills are challenged by demands such that we immerse ourselves in whatever
activity we undertake.  To quote the professor, "Because of the total
demand on psychic energy, a person in flow is completely focused. There is
no space in consciousness for distracting thoughts, irrelevant feelings.
Self-consciousness disappears.  When a person's entire being is stretched
in the full functioning of body and mind, whatever one does becomes worth
doing for its own sake; living becomes its own justification."</P>
<P>For example:  When I was in law school, I wrote two lengthy papers to write
-- fifty-page monsters with hundreds of footnotes, placed just so.  I'd sit
down at my desk and write, and next thing you know, it would be four in the
morning.  I had blocked out everything.  The world had narrowed itself to
me and my notecards and my word processor.</P>
<P>However, I can't claim that I "flowed" my way though law school (sometimes,
I feel like I "slept" my way through law school).  Law school can be an
ugly, depressing, soul-killing time, as Matt Damon finds out in Rounders.
(You knew there was a segue in there somewhere, didn't you?)  Damon plays a
"rounder", a young poker player who prowls the mean streets of New York and
the casinos of Atlantic city like a cat, looking to pounce on unsuspecting
pigeons with more money than ability.  After losing his stake to a Russian
cardsharp named Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), Damon decamps and goes to law
school, working his way through driving a pastry delivery truck.</P>
<P>Damon lands on his feet in law school, finding a cute girlfriend (Gretchen
Mol) and a possible internship with a judge.  But we get the sense from him
that he's not happy, he's not using his skills to the finest.  When his
best friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison, the lure of easy money
and fast times seduce Damon back into the world of high-stakes poker.  (A
dark, seedy, atmospheric world that's lovingly rendered and presented by
director John Dahl.)</P>
<P>The conflict in the movie is whether Damon will choose Mol and an education
and a career or choose to pursue his talents as a gambler.  What makes
Rounders so compelling is how it makes the latter choice seem more
appealing than it otherwise might be.  There are many factors involved in
Damon's choice -- his loyalty to his friend, his (apparent) struggles in
law school -- but the most important factor is that playing poker puts
Damon in the "flow".  He's able to lose himself in the game and test his
skills against others.  Damon is not playing poker because he's under a
compulsion or an addiction, he's playing because he's good at it and can
take pleasure in stretching his skills.</P>
<P>Rounders is more than just a great illustration of an important
psychological concept, of course.  It features fine performances from Damon
and Norton, who is fantastic as the sleazy gambler Worm.  Norton seems to
have the idea of flow down pat as well, losing his identity and slipping
neatly into the skin of whatever character he's playing.  Malkovich, on the
other hand, delivers a cartoonish performance as Damon's nemesis, who
proves that it's a bad idea to play with your food.</P>
<P>Rounders is a sharp, classy, intellectual picture, buoyed by an intelligent
script, sharp directing, and first-rate performances.  Well, that about
sums it up for this review.  Hey!  It's almost midnight!  Where did the
time go?</P>
