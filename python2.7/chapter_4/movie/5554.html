<P>     First of all, let's get the obvious question out of the way.  Yes, 
Demi Moore does take off her top (on several occasions, in fact), 
although it takes half the running length for her to do it the first 
time.  However, while Moore's body may be the movie's primary selling 
point, the film tries to do more than just display naked breasts.  The 
heart of STRIPTEASE is a satirical examination of those who frequent 
strip clubs, and this makes it profoundly different from SHOWGIRLS, 
which embraced those aspects of American culture that STRIPTEASE 
lampoons.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, STRIPTEASE's satirical bent, while aimed not only at 
the sexist attitudes of those who patronize topless joints, but at 
politicians, right-wing religious fanatics, and lawyers, is unfocused 
and lacks the requisite viciousness.  It's just one aspect of a muddled, 
overly-long motion picture that can't decide whether it wants to be a 
comedy or a drama.  Ultimately, the overabundance of ineffective 
dramatic moments hurts the movie. The situation is just too improbable 
and silly to carry any dramatic weight.</P>
<P>     Demi Moore plays Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary who now works 
as a topless dancer at the Eager Beaver Strip Club.  She needs to earn 
enough money to sustain a prolonged custody battle for her 7-year old 
daughter, Angela (Rumer Willis, Moore's real-life offspring).  Among the 
Eager Beaver's sleazy regulars is Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt 
Reynolds), the perpetually-drunk, womanizing, election-day choice of 
Christian groups.  One night, Dilbeck makes a scene at the strip joint, 
lunging for Erin and hitting another patron over the head with a bottle.  
Someone captures this on film, and a game of blackmail and murder 
ensues.  Meanwhile, Erin snatches her daughter from her criminal ex-
husband, Darrell (Robert Patrick, doing his best Gary Oldman 
impersonation), and solicits the help of a Miami cop (Armand Assante) to 
keep the little girl.</P>
<P>     One of the supposed comic elements of STRIPTEASE is Burt Reynolds' 
offensive, fatuous character.  Unfortunately, there's something sinister 
about this ignorant drunk (in fact, before some re-shooting was done, he 
attempted a rape) that diminishes any humor associated with him.  This 
is an unsavory man, and Reynolds plays him in a creepy, unsettling 
manner.  But, if it's difficult to laugh at Reynolds, the same can't be 
said about Ving Rhames.  In his role as Shad, the Eager Beaver's 
bouncer, Rhames' deadpan, matter-of-fact style (similar to the one he 
used in PULP FICTION) is consistently hilarious.  He is STRIPTEASE's 
high point.</P>
<P>     Moore is fine in this role, although more attention will be paid to 
her physical attributes than her acting.  She supposedly studied hard to 
be a stripper, and her on-screen, on-stage act is believable.  She's a 
little out of her depth in the dramatic sequences, although that's only 
one of the reasons they don't work (the script being the primary 
culprit).  Young Rumer Willis, who received a lot of notoriety before 
she was born as a result of Moore's VANITY FAIR cover, displays some 
promise with her unaffected performance. </P>
<P>     Despite being designed to mock those who leer, STRIPTEASE does some 
leering of its own.  Several lengthy topless dance sequences are shot in 
an energetic and provocative manner.  It's easy to be cynical about this 
film's motives, especially considering how drastically Andrew Bergman's 
script has watered down the most biting aspects of Carl Hiaasen's novel.  
STRIPTEASE is a curious mix of eroticism, comedy, and drama that, 
instead of blending into a pleasing whole, has a tendency to separate 
and curdle.</P>
