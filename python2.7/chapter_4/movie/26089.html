<P>When Academy Award winning writer ("The Usual Suspects") and first-time
director Christopher McQuarrie sat down to block out "a kidnapping saga
as a contemporary western awash in film noir overtones," he had an
agenda. It seems McQuarrie was unhappy with the way mainstream Hollywood
screenplays handle characters when they behave badly.</P>
<P>"The thing that has continually bothered me about films today is this
skewed sense of justice, this false sense of accountability," stated
McQuarrie. "In reality, people die all the time and the score isn't
evened, their death isn't justified. What's frustrating with Hollywood's
approach is that you see someone do a bad deed and they're punished for
it 10 times over. Not only is that not reality, but you're telling
people that their judgment about anything is okay."</P>
<P>Thanks a heap, Chris. After watching and reading countless news stories
about human beings doing unspeakably horrible things to other human
beings and getting away with their deeds, what a comfort it is to know
that you are out there, striving to insure that movies are just as
repulsive as real life.</P>
<P>"The Way of the Gun" follows two creeps as they kidnap a surrogate
mother-to-be, only to learn that the target of their ransom demands is a
money-laundering, union-busting bagman with a slew of thugs in his
employ. The story takes place in some alternate universe, where innocent
bystanders stare numbly at gunfights until they are instructed to flee,
where men race about shooting at each other with little visible concern
over the flying bullets and where no one ever calls the police.</P>
<P>Oh yes, Christopher McQuarrie has this hard-edged reality business down
pat.</P>
<P>In his alternate universe, women merely seethe or shriek, while the
men-folk pontificate endlessly, lobbing around quotes like:</P>
