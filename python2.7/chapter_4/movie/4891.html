<P>Camp-followers must be pleased these days, what with the work
of David Lynch, the Coen Brothers or Pedro Almodovar.</P>
<P>In TIE ME, Almodovar, Spanish cinema 's  brat who thumbs his
nose at filmic conventions by exaggerating them, takes a minor
but serious movie genre, pushes it to extremes and turns it
into a comedy. This genre is the captor-captive movie. 
Liliana Cavani's scandalous THE NIGHT PORTER had a former Nazi
concentration camp commandant and his former victim enter into
sadomasochistic games. In William Wyler's obsessive THE
COLLECTOR, a young man adds to his butterfly collection a
woman he is infatuated with. In the romantic THE WIND AND THE
LION, a Moroccan desert prince captures an American widow, and
her admiration. And so on.</P>
<P>What Almodovar does in TIE ME is to take themes along such
lines but de-dramatize them with that special Spanish variant
of kitsch known as "hortera."</P>
<P>Ricky (Banderas), released from a mental hospital, has a
fixation on former hooker Marina (Abril) with whom he once had
a one-night stand. She is now a porn-horror star and something
of a junkie--which in Spanish is pronounced "yunkee,"
perilously close to "Yankee."</P>
<P>Ricky forces himself into her apartment but not on her. He
declares: "I am 23, I have 50 thousand pesetas and am alone in
the world. I would like to make a good husband for you and a
good father for our children." Then this peculiar lover, more
swain than swine, proceeds to tie down Marina, oh so gently.
Yet as he had battered her a bit, and she also has other
pains, he proceeds to take care of her needs.These include
analgesics as well as heroin.</P>
<P>Ropes and devotion create bonds. Bondage leads to bonding.
When Ricky comes "home" all bloodied up by street druggies,
Marina's maternal-sexual feelings are aroused. True love
explodes.</P>
<P>One should not dismiss this situation as a misogynist fantasy
by a homosexual director (which Almodovar openly is). On the
contrary, Almodovar's screen world is sympathetically and
empathetically populated by female protagonists. More than
anything else, the point here is to make a parody of pulp
literature, film romances, B-movies, and the post-Franco Spain
which has been catching up with modern times with unfettered,
bewildering speed.</P>
<P>By itself, the main sex-love theme cannot convince us or
sustain the movie, but Almodovar throws in non-stop
peripherals, some pathetic, some not, all of them funny.
Marina, who looks like Rosanna Arquette's Iberian cousin, is
introduced as the movie she stars in is winding down.</P>
<P>It is directed by Maximo Espejo(Rabal) whose name--what a
stroke of genius!--means "maximum mirror." A veteran
filmmaker, now wheelchair bound, he is hornier than ever and,
quote:"making a comeback with a second-rate horror film."
Using the film-within-a film  device, Almodovar satirizes
deliciously yet affectionately the movie-making process and
the mentality behind such flicks.</P>
<P>Marina has a comic, outlandish sexual experience in her
bathtub, with a wind-up toy. Later, handcuffed to Ricky, she
goes out to her friendly, single-mother dentist who generously
offers her pills as well as a joint. In search of other pills
the two women disturb a fornicating lady-pharmacist who
appears girded with a holster and gun.</P>
<P>The television set shows a wild commercial on retirement, with
Germans, as young Nazis, efficiently planning ahead, while the
hedonistic Spaniards dance. </P>
<P>Bound and gagged, Marina uses the remote control to watch THE
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD on TV. Ricki's search for dope takes
him to the streets, where dealers are seriously talking
politics and a junkie offers herself to Ricky for 5,000
pesetas. "Make it 4,000" she then says "since I have herpes."</P>
<P>The movie abounds in paradoxes. The main one is that
theoretically, in spite of raunchy language and, at
face-value, sordid scenes, TIE ME is neither dark nor squalid.
Rather it is on the luminous side, and its vulgarity is
systematically de-fanged by Almodovar's eccentric humor. Of
course, it is emphatically not to everyone's taste, but if one
suspends disbelief and sets aside preconceptions, TIE ME is a
wildly entertaining and kinky piece of cinema. It might even
tie you in knots.</P>
