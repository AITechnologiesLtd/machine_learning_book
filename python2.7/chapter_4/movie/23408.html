<PRE>ORDINARY MADNESS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>First-time writer/director Bernardo Gigliotti's ORDINARY MADNESS is a
little bit of a mystery and a little bit of a comedy.  And therein lies
the problem -- it's not a lot of anything.</P>
<P>The film does have one strong thing going for it -- Denise Gentile's
compelling and alluring screen presence as Faye, the mad seductress at
the heart of the story.  The director never seems quite sure what to do
with her, but Gentile steals all of her scenes anyway.  She has a
passive-aggressive attitude that suggests she's vulnerable when she's
anything but.  Dressed to the nines, Faye has an elegance that's several
orders of magnitude above the old suburban home in which she lives with
her invalid husband, Albert (Gary D. Mosher).</P>
<P>Faye snares young male borders like a spider with her web.  She's not an
easy woman, however.  She chooses her men, not the other way round.</P>
<P>The busy story has several subplots including one about a tough parole
officer and another concerning some bad blues brothers.  The awful
singing duo, Larry Funk (Robert Musgrave) and Warren Funk (Alan
Gelfant), call themselves The Funk Brothers.  Larry's mantra is "Right
on!"  He says this as often as most people clear their throat.  These
blues brothers by night are gardeners during the day.  They get the
film's few genuinely funny lines, the best being when they claim that
their music is popular in Japan.</P>
<P>As is obvious from the beginning, the movie turns macabre in the last
act.  The mysterious Faye demonstrates her capacity to control
situations.</P>
<P>Denise Gentile tries her best to save the picture but can't.  The
writing is too loose and the other acting is credible only in fits and
spurts.</P>
<P>ORDINARY MADNESS runs 1:34.  It is not rated but would be an R for
sexual situations, violent images, drug usage and language.  The film
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film is being shown now as part of San Jose's Cinequest film
festival (www.Cinequest.org).</P>
