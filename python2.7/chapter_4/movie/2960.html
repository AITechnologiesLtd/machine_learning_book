<PRE>                                    QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by N'Gai Croal
                Copyright 1994 N'Gai Croal/Terrordome Bookworks</PRE>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW is the worst good film of 1994, which says as much about
the current state of American film as it does Robert Redford's most
recent directorial effort.  It sports an intriguing premise, a
top-notch cast, an ace cinematographer (Scorsese partner-in-crime
Michael Ballhaus) and a famously intelligent director.  But all of
these elements, like the trappings of the actual quiz show scandals,
are smoke-and-mirrors that conceals the fact that something is wrong at
the center--in this case, Paul Attanasio's screenplay--but for only so
long.</P>
<P>     The film begins with great promise.  Congressional investigator
Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) circles a spanking new convertible at the
center of a gleaming showroom; circling directly overhead is a
smooth-talking salesman who recites the specifications of the car like
the virtues of a lover.  Redford and Ballhaus depart from the Sundance
Kid's notoriously formal style; here, the two cross-fade from shot to
shot as Goodwin walks around the car, a rhythm that establishes the
seductiveness of the moment as well as its artifice.  The scene has
nothing to do with the narrative, but it's got everything to do with
the film's theme: the importance of probing beneath shiny surfaces.</P>
<P>     Redford effortlessly tops anything he's done to date with the next
sequence, which introduces us to the quiz show of the title,
"Twenty-One."  The camera prowls the studio where the show is shot,
introducing producers, contestants and a rapt studio audience.  Outside
the NBC building and across the country, men, women and children flock
to their television sets to watch long-running champion Herbert Stempel
(John Turturro) defy the odds and win yet again.</P>
<P>     The sequence is a marvel of simple-yet-effective cross-cutting, but
Redford doesn't stop there.  As he shows us the brilliantly scripted
puppet show taking place on national TV, he pulls back the curtain to
reveal the puppeteer standing behind it; in this case the Geritol
sponsor (director Martin Scorsese).  While the bosomy blonde sitting
next to him remarks that Stempel's face was "was made for radio," the
sponsor calls up the head of the network, who in turn calls up the
show's producers, who in turn inform Stempel that it's time for him to
go.</P>
<P>     The search is on for a new face--a "Twenty-One" champion "who
looks like he could get a table at Twenty-One."  Enter Charles van Doren
(Ralph Fiennes), an Ivy Leaguer who teaches at Columbia and whose
family seems to breed literati like rabbits.  A WASP among WASP, he's
the perfect replacement for the overbearingly Jewish (or is it Jewishly
overbearing) Stempel.  Needless to say, Stempel doesn't take the coup
very well, and determines to show the uncircumcised Hamptoner what
little Queens boys are made of, kicking off a grand jury investigation
that catches Goodwin's attention.</P>
<P>     What Stempel and Goodwin don't realize is the full extent of the
power wielded by the two institutions they're taking on--the old
whiteboy network and big business.  Goodwin is very nearly seduced by
the former; in investigating Charles van Doren, he finds himself so
drawn to their easy, erudite life of privilege that he resists
implicating van Doren until he can no longer protect him.  And the
latter, with millions of dollars behind it, walks into Goodwin's line
of fire and emerges unscathed.  "I thought I was gonna get television,"
he says, "but the truth is, television's gonna get us."</P>
<P>     For a while, QUIZ SHOW gets by on its gentle humor.  But Redford
is ill-suited to get to the bottom of the human comedy of the quiz
show scandal.  He trots out the usual suspects: Stempel is motivated by
his resentment of WASPs, Goodwin by his ambition and van Doren by an
Oedipus complex (minus the sexual component, of course).  None of these
are complicated enough to justify a two-hour movie--particularly one
with three main characters--unless it's balls-out satire.  Directors
with acid for blood, like Scorsese, Altman or Kubrick understand that,
which is why superficially superficial films like GOODFELLAS, THE
PLAYER and DR. STRANGELOVE shoot right to our core.  Redford is so
mistakenly brings a knife to a gunfight, so it's no surprise that he
fails to draw blood.</P>
<P>     Attanasio's script, while competent, is content to lay out a map
so complete that there are no surprises; there isn't a single moment in
the film that can't be predicted.  The source material may be
insubstantial, but there is a lot of ground the narrative has to
cover.  Attanasio's mistake is to attempt both breadth and depth
simultaneously; it's inevitable and unfortunate that both fail
spectacularly.</P>
<P>     The actors seem to understand that QUIZ SHOW should be a satire,
which has the effect entertaining us superbly even as it exposes the
hollowness at the film's core.  Ralph Fiennes, so effortlessly chilling
as Amon Goeth in SCHINDLER'S LIST reminds us why Day-Lewis status
isn't too far away for this young Brit.  Here, he strains for a
credible New York accent (as does Yank Rob Morrow), but the demons that
lie beneath his patrician exterior are only too believable.  Paul
Scofield puts in an award-worthy supporting turn as van Doren's father,
an man who intuitively, if not intellectually, understands the danger
that television represents.  And Martin Scorsese gives such a scabrous
performance an unflappable Geritol executive, that, at greater length,
could have rivaled his infamous backseat pussy-and-a-.45 monologue in
TAXI DRIVER.</P>
<P>     But the bravura performance is delivered by John Turturro.  He
sinks his teeth into Stempel's Jewish inferiority complex with such
over-the-top gusto that were this a Spike Lee film, cries of
anti-Semitism would be unleavened by Goodwin's good-Jew role.  More
sweaty, jittery and boorish than Tommy Lee Jones' warden in NATURAL
BORN KILLERS, the part is right out of Der Sturmer.  But Turturro
plunges so far into the part that he creates a truth completely outside
of Attanasio's scripting, refusing to sentimentalize Stempel in the
least.  It's as if Turturro were saying, "I double-dare ya to like this
shmuck."</P>
<P>     Unfortunately for Redford, the truth Turturro creates is so
effective that we can't be bothered to take him up on his dare.  Both
van Doren and Stempel may be frauds, but van Doren's smooth,
all-American beauty is far better company than Stempel's snaggle-toothed
chutzpah, so we can't begrudge Goodwin or Redford for deciding to spend
more time with van Doren.  We see van Doren at work, rest and play, but
every time we see Stempel, he's monomaniacally focused on "Twenty-One."
By hewing so tightly to Goodwin's point-of-view, Redford reinforces our
opinion that Charlie isn't so bad, and Stempel is a bit of a loser.  If
van Doren were more vacant, more greedy, more grasping than he turns
out to be, Redford could have punished us and Goodwin for falling for
van Doren's golden-boy charm.  Instead, Redford's even-handedness
becomes infuriating, and his insistence that television is the real bad
guy rings more-and-more hollow.</P>
<P>     Despite the screenplay's significant problems, QUIZ SHOW is very
entertaining.  Redford's skill with actors is very much in evidence,
particularly in the quiet scenes, and most impressively with Fiennes
and Scofield; the stunned expression on Scofield's face after hearing
his son confesses to him suggests a loss of innocence that was never
America's to lose.  But Redford slyly saves his best and most
disturbing image for last:  behind the end credits, a studio audience
laughs and applauds in ominous slow-motion, as if the scandal had ever
happened.  Turning the camera back on us, in fact, is the most
intelligent choice Redford makes in the entire film, a choice that
almost justifies QUIZ SHOW's existence.</P>
