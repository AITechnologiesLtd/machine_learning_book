<P>     REALITY BITES doesn't quite add up.  On the surface, this
agreeable romantic comedy seems like a landmark achievement from both
director Ben Stiller and writer Helen Childress.  It's funny, it's
handsome, and it boasts a *very* appealing cast.</P>
<P>     Touche, Richard Linklater, REALITY BITES is also Hollywood's first
saga about today's disillusioned, post-college youth.  A group better
known as "Generation X."  Comic book forthcoming.</P>
<P>     The film centers on Leaina Pierce (Ryder), a recent Houston, Texas
grad.  Formerly the class valedictorian--who closed her speech with the
sentence "There's no answer."--she now works as an intern on a morning
television show.  She also moonlights as an amateur filmmaker.</P>
<P>     Her roommates are a motley crew.  There's Troy (Hawke), a musician
who excels at lost jobs and umkempt hair.  And Sammy (Zahn), also
unemployed but known to bathe.  And Vickie (Garofalo), proud manager of
a Gap clothing store.</P>
<P>     All living and breathing and eating together.  All in the throes
of dating woes.  And all being filmed for Leaina's documentary.</P>
<P>     With its film-within-a-film subplot, REALITY BITES sounds the
perfect "verite" vehicle for an exploration of "X."  Wrong!  REALITY
BITES is a completely conventional film right down to the squishy,
happy Hollywood ending.  Which is not needed in a story rich with both
humor *and* insight.</P>
<P>     These are kids raised on sitcoms and advertising; kids who talk in
jingles and don't understand why their worlds cannot be restored at the
end of the half-hour.  To which Troy can only comment "Mr. Brady died
of AIDS."</P>
<P>     Who needs formula with psychology like this?</P>
<P>     Ryder, Hawke, and the rest of the gang are tremendous appealing.
Even if they need baths and better clothes.  Ryder, in particular, is a
dynamite presence.  Watch for John Mahoney, who steals a couple scenes
as a chatty TV host, and an unbilled Jeanne Tripplehorn.</P>
<P>     With Stiller's smart direction and good gag after gag, REALITY
BITES feels fine up to a point.  After about an hour of endless
references to the seventies, something doesn't just add up.  These kids
were infants at that time!  How do they know so much about disco and
"Good Times" and PLANET OF THE APES?  Do reruns *really* contain that
much detail?</P>
<P>     Honestly, REALITY BITES feels like it was written by someone in
their their '30's.  The cultural references just don't add up and it
makes an for an incongruity that almost pushes the film into fantasy.
Is writer Helen Childress (in her '20's) *really* taking the pulse of
America's young-adults.  Or did she just find the perfect world to
populate with phony characters?</P>
<P>Suggested alternate title: FANTASY BITES.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:    REALITY BITES is a tremendously appealing,
                old-fashioned-disguised-as-new romantic comedy.
                Questionable cultural references may bother some.</PRE>
