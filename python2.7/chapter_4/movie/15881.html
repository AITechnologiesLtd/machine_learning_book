<PRE>PATCH ADAMS (1998)
A Review by Amateur Film Critic Sharon Connolly</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Robin Williams, Monica Potter, Bob Gunton, Daniel London, Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Josef Sommer and Peter Coyote Directed by Tom Shadyac
Written by Steve Oedekerk Released by Universal Pictures</P>
<P>This film is based on real-life doctor Patch Adams of Virginia who tried to
reinvent the medical practice through humor and a free clinic.        Patch has
been described as an iconoclast, a pattern-breaker and professional clown,
and who could play Patch any better than Robin Williams, who's proven to the
world over and over again that he's a comedic genius! Williams also has that
unique ability to make you laugh and cry almost within the same scene.</P>
<P>With a Christmas premiere, the timing is perfect because it's a "feel-good"
film for the holidays.        Now I ask you - what's wrong with that?  Its clever
script brings rich humor poking fun at the medical establishment and the myth
of doctors as godlike creatures. And that's something nearly every one of us
can relate to.        Described as a drama/comedy, the script focuses on five years
of the doctor's life. As an amateur film critic, I have to declare "Patch
Adams" a definite winner DESPITE the influx of complaints from national
critics who have referred to it as syrupy, beyond belief and toying with the
emotions with a heavy hand, even going so far as to say that the soundtrack
was also manipulative.        Well, name one that isn't.  At the sneak preview I
attended, the audience responded with a round of applause, highly unusual. I
think moviegoers have had their share this year of action and special-effects
films, which demand total suspension of disbelief for a solid two hours! 
Therefore, "Patch Adams" has a refreshing appeal and can be embraced as a
story of joy and hope in the face of illness and death, which we must all
eventually succumb to.</P>
<P>Bob Gunton plays his villainous role with fervor as Dean Walcott (remember
him as the prison warden in "Shawshank Redemption"?) while Monica Potter
delightfully plays Patch's love interest despite her Julia Roberts'
look-alike image.  Kudos also goes to Daniel London as Patch's geeky pal as
well as to Philip Seymour Hoffman as the earnest but pompous and humorless
roommate. (A bit like some of these film critics, eh?)        And, yes, the
cantankerous, dying patient in Room 305 is indeed Peter Coyote, whose awesome
voice can still be easily recognized.</P>
<P>As a final note, this film has received two Golden Globe nominations, one for
Best Picture in the musical/comedy category and one for Williams as Best
Actor. Guess there must be plenty of other folks out there who agree with me.</P>
