<P>Director Taylor Hackford's greatest cinematic achievement as of 1998,
this movie was able to touch people from both sexes and various sides
of the track, as the love story and the determination of the human
spirit reached out and played everyone's heartstrings succinctly.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Loser/loner Zach Mayo enlists in the Navy because he wants to inject a
little direction into his wayward life. During his 13-week boot camp,
he gets taught a lot of lessons of discipline, friendship and
ultimately, love, as he starts off as a son trying to escape his
father's past, and ends up as an officer and a gentleman.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Inspirational and timeless, this romantic drama melds together a tight
script, strong performances by its lead actors, and a universally
positive message regarding the defiance of one's own demons, and the
success drawn from one's own determination, hard work and true heart.
This movie is made for the romantic in all of us, as well as the loners
that we've all experienced being at one point in our lives. How does
one get past the fact that there is no one around them willing to lend
them any love or support? How does one triumph over all adversities
despite the plethora of obstacles standing in their way? Well, besides
listening to hours of endless Tony Robbins motivational tapes, there is
only one way that we could all muster a little personal
self-confidence, and that is sheer persistence, will power and heart!
If you really want to do something, and I mean REALLY WANT TO DO
SOMETHING...you should be able to do it, no matter what obstacles lie
in your wake. This movie presents us with a great example of just that.</P>
<P>This film drills this philosophy right into our brains to the point
where I actually felt like going out and "doing something", just for
the sake of the thrill that the film gave me. Then I realized that it
was three in the morning, I was tired, and in my PJ's, so I left it
until the next day :). All that, and you get an interesting story about
the trials and tribulations of boot camp Navy candidates, plenty of
fully developed characters, a great performance by Louis Gossett Jr.,
and a wonderfully sugared romance which begins on notes of despair but
ends in true inspiration. Oh yeah, and I almost forgot...Richard Gere
is also quite good in the movie. This is a wonderful film that will
make you laugh and cry, smile and cringe, and give you more reason to
believe in yourself, and follow your dreams till their end. If
candidate Mayo-naisse can do it, we all can !!! </P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Louis Gossett Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in
this film.
The part of Zach Mayo was originally offered to John Travolta, who
turned it down on the advice of his agent. Richard Gere went on to play
that character in this film, and the film garnered 6 Oscar nominations.
Debra Winger spent part of her youth in Israel and served three months
in the Israeli army. She moved to California, where she decided to
pursue a serious acting career following a severe accident at a local
amusement park at which she was performing. She was married to actor
Timothy Hutton from 1980 to 1990. They had one son together.
Richard Gere was married to supermodel Cindy Crawford from 1991 to
1995.
Director Taylor Hackford lived with actress Helen Mirren from 1986 to
1997, at which point, they got married.
Look for an early film appearance by the actor who thought he was "too
good for TV", David Caruso, of TV's NYPD fame. He's the redhead recruit
with the heebie-geebies about water.</P>
