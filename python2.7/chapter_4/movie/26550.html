<P>
The Contender (2000)  1 star out of 4. Starring Joan Allen, Gary Oldman,
Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater, Sam Elliott and William Petersen.
Written and directed by Rod Lurie. Rated R.</P>
<P> It's bad enough that this year's political campaigns are more about
style and sound bytes than substance.</P>
<P> Now we have "The Contender," a pretentious political pot-boiler that
will do to political movies what "Roller Boogie" did to disco.</P>
<P> How lame is "The Contender?" Probably the Gore-Bush debates will ignite
more sparks and offer more excitement than this tedious, overblown,
filibuster of a feature.</P>
<P> Not only that, the movie lacks the courage of its convictions, proving
a lame,  cop-out ending.</P>
<P> And that is too bad because "The Contender" had potential to be an
interesting examination about morals, the double standard and the
nuts-and-bolts of political machinations.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, all this was flushed down the toilet to include a stupid
subplot about a governor who goes to extreme lengths to try to reach a
higher office.</P>
<P> In "The Contender," the vice president has died in office, and now
President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) must fill his position.</P>
<P> His nominee is a centrist woman senator, Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). The
opposition is led by a conservative House elder, Rep. Sheldon Runyan
from Illinois (Gary Oldman).</P>
<P> "The Contender" isn't a movie; it's a boring two-hour-plus civics
lecture. The characters don't speak dialogue, they spout politically
correct slogans guaranteed to warm the cockles of any liberal. It is a
movie overbaked with platitudes and clichés about democracy, the rights
of privacy and the majesty of government.</P>
<P> Writer-director Rod Lurie has created a ham-fisted, clunky diatribe
that is about as entertaining as reading the "Congressional Record." One
of his biggest problems is the sanctimonious, self-righteousness that
peppers his script. Lurie is as subtle as Roseanne singing `The Star
Spangled Banner.'</P>
<P> He despises hypocrisy, male chauvinism and zealots - especially
political ones - witch hunts, persecution and McCarthyism. Well, gee,
with the exception perhaps of Jesse Helms, who among us doesn't?</P>
<P> In fairness, it should be noted that the actors give their all. Allen
is lovely combination of steel and sex as the senator who will not yield
on her principles even if it costs her the vice presidency as well as
her reputation.</P>
<P> Oldman is not as spontaneous and overripe as he has been in features
such as "Air Force One." Of course, he just can't say his lines. He
fiddles with his hair, and fusses around as if he's primping for a Mr.
Congressman beauty contest.</P>
<P> Bridges gives a sly performance as a president who acts like a good
‘ole boy, but in reality is a shrewd player.</P>
<P> Also featured is Christian Slater as a young congressman with a
conscience - an endangered species.</P>
<P> No, in this political season the best thing to do is veto "The
Contender." It definitely does not get my vote.</P>
