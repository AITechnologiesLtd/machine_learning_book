<P>     At one point in DROWNING MONA -- one of the strangest, most
frustrating films I've ever been able to sort of recommend as a critic --
small-town cop Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) conducts an interview after the
suspicious death of town witch Mona Dearly (Bette Midler). The interviewee
is Mona's dimwitted son Jeff (Marcus Thomas), who is trying to implicate
his landscaping business partner Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck) by
recounting a confrontation in which he recalls that Bobby shouted a threat
to Mona: "I'll tear out your ovaries!" An incredulous Chief Rash asks
Jeff, "He said 'ovaries?'" "Oh yeah," responds Jeff, "all the time."</P>
<P>     That can't possibly read as funny as it plays, but it's typical of
the throwaway gags that kept me chuckling constantly through an utterly
pointless plot. The premise is that virtually everyone in town -- Jeff,
Bobby, Mona's husband Phil (William Fichtner), Phil's waitress lover Rona
(Jamie Lee Curtis), Bobby's fiancee and Chief Rash's daughter Ellie (Nee
Campbell), even Chief Rash's deputy Feege (Peter Dobson) -- had a motive
for slaying the much-hated Mona. Through flashbacks we see a variety of
antagonizing incidents, many of which may have happened in a completely
different way. The goal would seem to be a broad, dark comedy combining
DeVito's twisted sensibilities, Midler at her most obnoxious and a
well-known everybodydunnit: THROW THE RUTHLESS PEOPLE FROM THE ORIENT
EXPRESS.</P>
<P>     Only the broad, dark comedy is far and away the least interesting
thing about DROWNING MONA. At its best, it's a showcase for the sort of 
giddy, utterly unexpected moments (by screenwriter Peter Steinfeld) that
can make a devotee of great film writing swoon. Due to a test marketing by
the car manufacturer, everyone in the town drives a Yugo (and the service
station helpfully announces "We specialize in Yugos"). A suicidal man's
demand to Chief Rash, "Don't come any closer, Sheriff" is greeted by
another officer's insistent plea, "Wait wait wait ... he's not a sheriff!" 
A funeral parlor's neon sign announces "As seen on TV." And so on.</P>
<P>     Actually, and so on and on and on. Steinfeld is clearly a clever
fellow, but he also doesn't quite know when to quit, or how to keep the
tone jaunty. There are trite scenes involving an alcoholic Catholic
priest, shoulda-been-but-not-quite gags involving a man's use of the
"Wheel of Fortune" board game as foreplay and a misguided scene apparently
intended to make Mona a sympathetic loser (instead of the cackling cartoon
better suited to the story). By the time the final half hour rolls to a
close -- including a forced bit with a lesbian kiss and Tracey Walter
becoming the film's town loony ex machina -- DROWNING MONA has lost a lot
of the bounce in its step, tossing out much of the subversive humor for
chases and exposition (and far too much screen time for Neve Campbell).</P>
<P>     Still, there are those great bits of business that make too much of
DROWNING MONA too much oddball fun to dismiss completely. Plenty of those
bits of business would have worked just as well in any other story, which
makes it a shame that it had to be a wacky farce. Crank DROWNING MONA down
a notch or five, yank some of the bigger stars out of the film and make it
a sly low-budget film (which has been director Nick Gomez's milieu), and
you might have really had something. You have something anyway, something
as smart and weird as it is big and dumb. Maybe it's only a certain kind
of viewer who will enjoy sitting through the big, dumb stuff to get to
big, dumb Jeff sarcastically tapping his thumb and forefinger together,
taunting Bobby by playing "the world's smallest tambourine."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Yugo bosses:  6.</PRE>
