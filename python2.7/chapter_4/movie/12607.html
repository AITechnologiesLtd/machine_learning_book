<P>If there's anything THE HORSE WHISPERER says very well, it's what it has
to say about personality, and consequently, characterization. The three
or four main characters in the drama, and the ten or so more that are
significant supports, are very solid and very believable. And although
that should be a given in most movies, it is almost thankfully so in
this new Robert Redford film, a painstakingly thorough and mostly
powerful motion picture. It's been hailed as the best movie of 1998 thus
far, and although it may not warrant itself that award, it is definitely
among the top three movies yet. </P>
<P>Redford directs himself for the first time in his thirty-six year career
as an actor, and the results are somewhat muddled. His skills as both a
director (ORDINARY PEOPLE) and an actor (OUT OF AFRICA) are excellent,
but he loses some of his touch when devoting his energies to both
positions on the set. Fortunately, the rest of his cast really picks him
up, and in the end makes him seem better than he really is. Kristin
Scott Thomas (THE ENGLISH PATIENT), Sam Neill (JURASSIC PARK), and
Scarlett Johansson (MANNY & LO) all enforce the movie's solidity and
concrete characterization. Believable as everyone is, though, the entire
cast seems to lack an extra edge or push that would grant them any
noteability. No one in the cast astounds or amazes (with the possible
exception of Johansson, whose portrayal of a crippled girl is akin to
Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of a mentally retarded boy in WHAT'S
EATING GILBERT GRAPE), and thus the intense character issues are
somewhat bland. </P>
<P>The movie begins with Grace (Johansson) and her friend Judith (Catherine
Bosworth) out for a horse ride on a winter morning. Tragically, though,
their horses slip on icy ground, onto a road andinto the path of an
oncoming truck. The collision kills Judith and renders Grace minus her
right leg, which severly traumatizes the girl as well as her horse.
Annie (Scott Thomas), her mother, in her search for anything to help the
girl, chances upon the name of Tom Booker (Redford), a rancher with a
gift for helping horses. For lack of anything better, Annie leaves her
husband Robert (Neill) behind and takes Grace and the troubled steed out
to Montana to meet Tom and see if he can help them at all. It's from
here on, throughout the last three-quarters of the movie, that best part
of THE HORSE WHISPERER is clearly evident. The photography of Montana -
the impregnable mountains, the wide open skies, and the rolling hills -
is simply amazing. This movie may certainly garner an Academy Award
nomination in this respect. </P>
<P>THE HORSE WHISPERER isn't for the uncomitted viewer. It runs almost
three hours in length, and doesn't include a continual excitement factor
in movies of similar length, such as Titanic or The Postman. Rather, it
relies on important character relationships and the inklings of intense
melodrama to keep an anticipatedly intelligent audience very interested.
This strategy works - most of the time - as those watching become bent
on learning just how Tom Booker will help the horse, or how Annie will
deal with her new position in life. Other than its lack of sheer
panache, there's nothing wrong with THE HORSE WHISPERER; this is quite
possibly the best three-star movie I've ever seen.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "THE HORSE WHISPERER": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
