                             HARD RAIN 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                 1 :-)  for lot's of water over the dam</PRE>
<P>Cast: Cristian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver,
Edward Asner, Mark Rolston, Richard Dysart, Betty White, Henry Sears,
Wayne Duvall Director: Mikael Salomon</P>
<P>Too much rain and too much water almost sinks this armoured car heist.
Nevertheless, one has to compliment the production team for playing with
water and attempting to create a feel different from the mundane dry
land bank robbery. Add water, lots of water, so much so that everyone
needs to have a grade A certificate in water treading and a breath span
of 2 minutes. Following in the footsteps of TWISTER and DANTE'S PEAK we
watch nature wreak havoc on a small town. Although the special effects
are not as spectacular as the aforementioned, there is something special
about water not found in wind or lava. The level of destruction lies on
a slowly rising exponential curve and drowning is so peaceful.</P>
<P>I started out desperately wanting to hate this movie for the very
reasons it stared Christian Slater (armour car guard) and Morgan Freeman
(robber) - two actors who I don't particularly enjoy watching. You
wouldn't guess, by watching Slater on screen that he's the problem child
he is in real life. Freeman on the other hand is totally miscast as the
outlaw. His demeanour is entirely too dignified and controlled for a man
desperate to secure his retirement plan. Slater's onscreen love interest
is Minnie Driver (stain glass window expert) who is over the top pouty
and far too concerned about her glass windows than staying alive. The
attempts to generate heart felt emotion between the couple Driver and
Slater fails miserably. They take turns rescuing each other from
drowning, but tense life threatening situations does not equate to long
lasting love relationships. It's Randy Quaid (Sheriff) who by far gives
the best performance amongst this bunch of wet actors.</P>
<P>As I watched this movie from start to conclusion, the more I was able to
forgive its annoying flaws. The only reason for this is purely
philosophical and not theatrical. As I left the cinema I asked myself
this question - If I was in a flooding town excommunicated from the rest
of the world, would I kill for three million dollars tied to a
tombstone? My concluding thought was …… no. I can't swim and I can't
shoot and I'm way too generous.</P>
