<PRE>"All for one... and one for all!"</PRE>
<P>Starring Justin Chambers, Mena Suvari, Stephen Rea,
Tim Roth, Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Peter Hyams.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers is one of the
most often-adapted literary works, and for good
reason: the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just
a story. Perhaps The Musketeer, a new film that
"reimagines" the novel in the spirit and style of The
Matrix, is one adaptation too many. It's just awful:
spiritless, silly and unforgivably boring,
transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of
old-as-time clichés and incoherent, repetitive action
sequences.</P>
<P>This time, D'Artagnan is played by Calvin Klein model
Justin Chambers, who can't even pronounce his
character's name. As a boy, he watched his father get
killed by Febre (Tim Roth), a lackey of power-hungry
Cardinal Richelieu. He vowed to have vengeance. After
undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman,
he goes looking for his enemy.</P>
<P>On his quest, he embroils himself in a struggle for
control at the highest levels of the French
government. The Royal Musketeers have lost their
gusto, what with their jobs being taken over by the
Cardinal's own guards. Only a few loyal swashbuckers
remain, among them Athos and Portos (who are only
figureheads in this movie). Together with D'Artagnan,
they fight to extricate the Queen (Catherine Deneuve)
from the traps that Febre and Richelieu are trying to
plant. Oh, and as an afterthought, D'Artagnan falls in
love with the poor maid at the local inn (Mena
Suvari). Just thought I'd mention that.</P>
<P>Now, look: I don't know whose idea this was, but
whoever is responsible deserves a severe
tongue-lashing. I have nothing against "modernizing"
classic works of literature - at the very least, they
can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but
films as dull as this have no positive side effects.
Director Peter Hyams, known for such masterpieces of
modern cinema as Timecop and End of Days, has
jettisoned everything that was great about Dumas'
masterwork: the sense of excitement, cause, and
camaraderie. Instead, we get impressively
choreographed but somehow vacuous, uninvolving action
sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to
nothing. When the musketeers finally get to holler
"All for one, and one for all," I could have sworn
that was Dumas rolling in his grave that I felt.</P>
<P>Maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here
is the Hyams's tone, which is unreasonably dark and
brooding when you consider the Reader's Digest
condensed version of the story that he gives us. It's
as though anything that may have been construed as
"fun" was purposely expunged from the production. The
joylessness of the proceedings, from the oppressively
shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes, can be
felt in every frame.</P>
<P>Chambers can't act; Suvari, Roth and Deneuve can, but
aren't given the chance. And when push comes to shove,
the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious,
though at least Roth gets to play a villain without
having to wear an ape suit.</P>
<P>Some movies seem sloppy and careless, clearly made for
a quick buck. With The Musketeer we get the sense that
it was meticulously crafted to be awful. The film is
intricate, stylish and precise, hitting the wrong note
every single time. </P>
