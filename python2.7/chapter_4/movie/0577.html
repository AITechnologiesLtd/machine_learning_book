                               LICENSE TO KILL
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  More action, less campy self-parody is
     the by-word of the latest Bond film.  There is almost too
     little humor in this hard-edged adventure film involving
     Bond's vendetta against a Panamanian drug lord.  Rating: +2.</P>
<P>     Operative 007 had been getting older and softer as the series
progressed.  The series had lost its hard edge.  In the early days, Bond was
a sort of all-purpose thug for the good guys fighting people who were
basically grandiose hoods toppling missiles or holding cities for ransom.
Later he lost the hard edge and became a sort of fop.  His foes were people
wanting to start nuclear wars and/or kill everyone in the world.  And the
stories became more campy and more silly, with more idiotic special
equipment and more and more obvious product placements.  Around the time
they made MOONRAKER, the series hit bottom.  After MOONRAKER, somebody must
have seen that the series needed rethinking.  Since then the plots have been
better constructed, but there has been an uneasy blend of the tongue-in-
cheek with some tighter storylines.  The choice of Timothy Dalton, with a
face like a Swiss Army knife and a sharp edge to match fueled speculation
that the series was going back to hard adventure.  LICENSE TO KILL is the
least fanciful Bond film ever made.  James Bond is no longer the lucky but
greying fop; he is young and vital and angry.  But for a couple of stagey
stunts toward the end of the film, this is a surprisingly serious action
film.</P>
<P>     There is a lot of story in this 133-minute film.  Even the pre-credit
action sequence advances the main story.  It is rare that it ever does and
this time it really is an integral part of the plot.  Bond is helping old
friend Felix Leiter(played by David Hedison, who becomes the first actor to
play the role twice) catch Sanchez, a Central American drug lord.  Things go
extremely wrong and Bond finds he has a serious vendetta against Sanchez
(played by Robert Davi, whose pockmarked face adds a touch of realism).
Bond must track the drug lord to Panama (thinly disguised under the name
Isthmus) where Sanchez ruthlessly holds his own empire through schemes
involving drug-running, evangelists, and Contras.</P>
<P>     The credit sequence is once again stunning in spite of the instantly
forgettable credit song by Gladys Knight.  Michael Kamen's score is not up
to the classic John Barry efforts, but it gets the job done.  Some aerial
stunts are impressive though driving stunts tend to be a weak point in the
film.  The characters lack some of the interest value of those in FROM
RUSSIA WITH LOVE, the only other Bond film with any credibility.  LICENSE TO
KILL is a sign that the Bond series is improving.  I give it a +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.</P>
