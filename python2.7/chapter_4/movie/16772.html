4 stars (Out of 4)
After seeing At First Sight I found myself in a very rare scenario. As I 
tried to visualize how this review would go, what angles I would take, 
and whether or not this film deserved a positive or negative review, I 
was at a loss for both word and thoughts. But then, to quote one of my 
favorite films, Good Will Hunting, "Something occurred to me and I fell 
into a deep, peaceful sleep." It occurred to me that any movie capable 
of making me think that hard about it's entire panoply of elements is a 
great film for that reason alone.</P>
<P>The real beauty behind At First Sight is that any idiot can see it, and 
they will probably enjoy it and get something out of the whole 
experience. But when someone who is capable of thinking is to view it, 
they will be intellectually challenged by the incredible amounts of 
symbolism found within this great work. Everything in this film from a 
hockey stick to a school bus to a tree brings so much more significance 
to it than the 3 dimensions in which it exists. Not a scene will escape 
where this movie hasn't transformed an otherwise dull object, activity, 
or element of life into a richly vast rainbow of emotions.</P>
<P>Virgil Adamson (Val Kilmer) has been blind since he was 3 years old. 
Living in a small town and working as a masseuse for a resort, he had 
adapted to this handicap and his sister, Jennie (Kelly McGillis), had 
dedicated her life to helping him fight it. Absent of both a father and 
mother, the 2 have fought their way through life together. Their lives 
are filled with the routine necessary for a blind man, and that is the 
extent of excitement that they will encounter.</P>
<P>But all will change when Virgil falls in love with a client named Amy 
Benic (Mira Sorvino). As Amy slowly takes over his life, she convinces 
him that he can regain his sight through a complex medical procedure. 
After undergoing this treatment, Virgil indeed can see, but struggles 
with association and adjustment. Despite the help of therapist Phil 
Webster (Nathan Lane), things seem even blurrier than before. And so it 
is that the lack of a sense that he once claimed to be a handicap holds 
a presence that disables him even more.</P>
<P>On the surface this appears to be study of human sight, love, romance, 
and a life regained; but below the surface it is so much more. The lack 
of and regaining of sight are merely a vehicle for this film to explore 
some of the innermost complex human emotions. And it does that in a 
manner equivalently miraculous to the vehicle it uses.</P>
<P>Val Kilmer's performance is the best yet of this new year. He takes on a 
very demanding role and meets every expectation that could be imagined, 
then takes it one step farther. Nathan Lane also gives a wonderful 
performance in his small, but far from limited role. He actually manages 
to create a memorable and unforgettably emotional scene in a strip bar. 
However, as all things must have a down side, this film's weak link is 
Mira Sorvino. She is incredibly dull and unconvincing. She closer 
resembled to her father, Paul Sorvino, in Goodfellas than a young girl 
in love. And with that can only bring questions of whether or not she is 
capable of acting, or could Mighty Aphrodite have been a shear fluke.</P>
<P>At First Sight is not so much a film but rather a dazzlingly complex 
portrayal of symbolism. Although damaged by a sub-standard acting 
performance, At First Sight will still has an incredible effect on 
everyone that will see it. And it is for that reason that it is such a 
wonderful film.</P>
