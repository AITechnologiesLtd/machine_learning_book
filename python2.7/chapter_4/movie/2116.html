                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Husband and wife team Jeff (Dennis Quaid) and Jane Blue (Kathleen
Turner) have, during their illustrious career as spies, worked for both
the FBI and the CIA.  Now, with an eleven-month old baby, they're in
semi- retirement while vacationing in New Orleans.  Of course, there
wouldn't be a movie if a plot device didn't come along to re-activate
them.  In this case, it's a Czech terrorist, played by Fiona Shaw.
Simply put, Jeff and Jane have to locate, then stop, her.  Along the
way, the two are pursued by the incompetently villainous Muerte
(Stanley Tucci), who is intent on redressing past insults.</P>
<P>     Anyone who takes any part of this film seriously has missed the
point.  UNDERCOVER BLUES is pure farce, with no inconvenient things
like drama, characterization, or storyline thrown in to muddy the
waters.  The film frequently doesn't make sense and, on those occasions
when it does, its stupidity is so transparent that we almost wish it
didn't.  But that's part of the movie's limited charm.</P>
<P>     Most comedy spy stories try for a few dramatic or thriller-type
moments, but not UNDERCOVER BLUES.  In a way, it's refreshing never to
have to worry about the heroes being in danger.  You know from the
beginning that there's no chance of that.  The bad guys are straight
out of the comics, and they're not the only ones.</P>
<P>     The characters of Jeff and Jane Blue have absolutely no depth, but
their banter is frequently amusing, although not laughably funny.
Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid appear to be enjoying themselves
immensely in these frothy roles, and they mesh well together.  Whatever
term you want to use for their pairing, be it likable or appealing,
Turner and Quaid play off of each other as well as the script allows.</P>
<P>     Fiona Shaw is a little to shrill to be enjoyable, and her role
isn't a particularly large one.  Her Novacek is a nasty woman who never
elicits more than a halfhearted chuckle, and manages to get involved in
an embarrassing mud-wrestling match with Jane Blue.  Similarly, Obba
Babatunde (as the tough-as-nails cop who trails around after the Blues)
has few genuinely funny moments, and it's a little difficult to fathom
exactly what his character is doing in the movie.  More than
occasionally, he becomes an unwanted annoyance.</P>
<P>     The same cannot be said of Stanley Tucci, whose Muerte is by far
the best element of the movie.  Muerte, called "Morty" by the Blues,
gets into a knife fight with Jeff early in the movie.  Despite being
one of the most feared men in Cajun Country, the inept thug is beaten
soundly by Jeff, whose only weapon is a baby stroller.  After that
humiliating incident, he shows up time and time again, providing
several moments of hilarity amidst the sometimes plodding movement of a
pointless plot.</P>
<P>     A major weakness of UNDERCOVER BLUES is that it pays more than
mere lip service to its story (i.e., it actually allows events to move
along towards a recognizable conclusion).  There are numerous scenes
that simply don't work, and their presence slows proceedings to a
grinding halt.  This is pretty obviously a case of having too little
material to fill up the requisite feature film length.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, UNDERCOVER BLUES is silly enough to deserve some
credit, and for those who see it, there will at least be a few laughs.
This is one of the most empty-headed comedies in a long while, and it
revels in its own admitted idiocy.  It's debatable whether anyone would
want to pay money for this picture, but when it gets to cable, it might
be worth a look for those in the right mood.  After all, there's always
a place for mindless entertainment, even if that place is on
television.</P>
