<P> Starring Denzel Washington, John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev
Schreiber, Dan Hedaya, Vicellous Reon Shannon. Rated R.</P>
<P>Some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high Oscar
potential that when they're finally released, everyone just goes along
with it. Thus sometimes, films unworthy of any award sans the Razzie
become Oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations. Last year it was
The Thin Red Line. This year's "winner" is The Hurricane, pure
unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with
critical plaudits and votes in the office Oscar pool.</P>
<P>Acclaimed director Norman Jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions
of courtroom movies without any of the fun. And that's supposed to be
ok because, see, it's a true story. It's about Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
(Denzel Washington), a legendary African American prizefighted who is
unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly
(racist!) detective (Dan Hedaya) who's had it in for the "big-shot"
Hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a
knife (in self-defense but who cares, right?) when Rubin was only ten.
He is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole. Most
of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison.</P>
<P>To the rescue -- Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) and his team of
wanna-be detectives. Lesra is an African American teenager taken in by
three well-off Canadian white people (Hanna, Unger, Schreiber) to get
an education. Lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where Lesra picks
out his very first book -- "The Sixteenth Round," Rubin's
autobiography. Immediately thereafter, Schreiber's character tells
Lesra "Sometimes we don't pick the books we read, they pick us." Hmmm.</P>
<P>After a few visits to the prison, they become convinced of Rubin's
innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two
juries have convicted him. They meticulously go through all the files
and revisit all the old witnesses (I wonder if any of them might be
cranky old women who slam the door in their faces?) and in the course
of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence
confirming the Hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never
seeked out during the first two proceedings. Of course, we're already
told that he's innocent.</P>
<P>A movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being
shown everything significant that happened to Carter during this period
in his life. All too obviously, we're getting the Hollywood watered-
down version. That would be ok except that the parts we are getting is
milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could
possibly squeeze out of it. It's almost cruel. The melodrama isn't of
the entertaining kind either; it's the hokey, rammed-down-your-throat
variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity.
Witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial
or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists.</P>
<P>The Hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills
courtroom movie. It's formula stripped to the bare necessities. You
have your wrongly accused black man. You have your melodramatic final
courtroom scene. But there's nothing else. You'd expect some sort of
involving investigation. But that's not necessary since we're
implicitly informed of his innocence. Thus the whole middle portion of
the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding. Brooding to himself.
Brooding to other inmates. Brooding to Lesra. Brooding to Lesra's
Canadian friends. Brooding in letters. I don't think I'll ever look at
brooding the same way again. It wasn't long before I got tired of
hearing the Hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition.
I wanted something to happen.</P>
<P>As for Washington's performance in the title role -- I figured I'd have
to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's
received -- he is top notch, though still boring. How is that possible?
Well, he does what Jewison wanted him to do perfectly. Unfortunately
what Jewison asked him to do is a load of crap. What a waste of a great
performer.</P>
<P>Speaking of wastes, why the hell did John Hannah agree to do this? He's
an extremely talented actor and I love him dearly, but what is he doing
here? To call his character (along with Schreiber's and Unger's) a
stick figure would be a gross understatement. All three of them come
off as veritable Mother Theresas, as benevolent as do-gooders come. If
they're to play a major part in this movie, why not make them real
people, with real feelings and emotions?</P>
<P>Look: if you're going to make a formula movie, don't undermine the
formula. Courtroom dramas can be fun, but this is ridiculous. Not only
is it trite, it's boring.</P>
