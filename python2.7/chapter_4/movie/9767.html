<PRE>                               PARENTHOOD
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     When they are told that their son Kevin (Jasen Fisher) must go to
a special school next year due to his behavior problems, his parents,
Gil (Steve Martin) and Karen (Mary Steenburgen), start blaming each
other and then they come up with various crackpot ideas.  "We'll throw
away the TV," Gil blurts out.  "We'll perform Shakespeare in front of
him."</P>
<P>     Although Ron Howard's 1989 film PARENTHOOD is a master at the
verbal humor, the physical humor has its own special, subtle beauty.
When the lights go out at the big family dinner, everyone goes looking
for a flashlight.  When power is restored Gil ends up holding the
pulsating vibrator of his grown sister Helen, played in a knowing,
Academy Award nominated performance by Dianne Wiest.  In another scene,
Helen flips through the graphic sexual pictures of her daughter Julie
(Martha Plimpton) and Julie's boyfriend Tod (Keanu Reeves).  Never
letting us see the pictures, Helen laughs in horror as she interrogates
Julie about how the pictures came to be made.</P>
<P>     Interlaced with the humor is a multigenerational parenthood story.
Frank (Jason Robards) is the family's patriarch, and Gil is one of his
children.  Most shows concentrate on the kids, but this show stays true
to its title and focuses almost exclusively on parenthood itself,
including relationship of adults to their parents.</P>
<P>     Gil flashes back with daydreams about his relationship with his
father when he was young and forward to a dream of his son's being
valedictorian and thanking him in the commencement speech.  When things
don't go quite as Gil wishes, the dreams turn to nightmares of Kevin
being as a campus sniper.</P>
<P>     Lowell Ganz, Ron Howard and Babaloo Mandel's intelligent and
profoundly wise script manages to be serious and delicious funny at the
same time.  Martin, in his prime, is the Dad who remains willing to do
anything for his son, right down to impersonating Cowboy Dan at his
son's birthday party.  (The real Cowboy Dan was beaten to a pulp at an
adult male's birthday party when a stripper and Cowboy Dan got their
addresses mixed up.)</P>
<P>     Gil resents the way his father ignored him when he was young.  Gil
doesn't understand Kevin either although he certainly tries harder than
his dad did.  "Where does he get this excessive behavior?"  Gil asks
about Kevin, while Gil obsessively washes his hands.</P>
<P>     Most films are advised not to include too many featured parts lest
none be adequately developed, but director Ron Howard is one of the few
who can and does bring this off.  Among the many minor players, Tom
Hulce appears as Frank's ne'er-do-well son and compulsive gambler,
Larry.  Frank feeds Larry money which only exacerbates Larry's
troubles.</P>
<P>     Besides coping with her daughter Julie, Helen has other
difficulties.  One day, Helen uncovers the big secret of her 9-year-old
son Garry, played by Joaquin Phoenix (then known as Leaf Phoenix).  She
fears it's drugs he's been keeping in his carefully guarded brown paper
bag, but it's porno tapes instead.  Relieved, she takes a charitable
view, saying he must be "interested in sex -- or filmmaking."</P>
<P>     My personal favorite scene is when Nathan (Rick Moranis) drills
his 4-year-old daughter with flashcards of the chemical elements.  It's
never too soon to get ready for the best universities.</P>
<P>     Gil loses his big promotion to partner to a guy who is so
dedicated to his job that his boss doesn't even know if the guy has
children.  "Women have choices, and men have responsibilities," an
angry Gil explodes to his wife when overcome by the pressures of both
being a good father to his kids and keeping an adequate job.  When his
wife points out the fallacies in his argument, he backs down, but feels
even more lost.</P>
<P>     After being detestable in most of the movie, Frank finally becomes
sympathetic toward the conclusion.  "It never ends," Frank tells Gil
about fatherhood.  Frank's grown son Larry, being threatened with
extinction by gangsters wanting their money, is still more than Frank
can handle.  And like a good father, he comes up with what he views as
an eminently reasonable resolution of the problem, complete with an
installment scheme payoff.  Larry, never able to grow up, of course,
does not see it that way and wants to chase another get-rich-quick
scheme, this time with platinum.</P>
<P>     Leave it to Grandma to explain it all.  Although some people like
merry-go-rounds, she says she has always preferred the roller coaster.
Gil realizes his life is a roller coaster, and he comes to relish it.
The marvelously life-affirming film ends in a massive baby birthing
scene with enough joy for every member of the audience.</P>
<P>     PARENTHOOD runs 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for profanity and sexual
humor and situations.  The film would be fine for kids 10 and up.</P>
<P><HR>     My son Jeffrey, age 8 1/2, said he liked the show, especially the
little girl and her father from HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS.</P>
