<P>"If you liked _The_Sixth_Sense_, then you'll love _Stir_of_Echoes_." 
I'm actually a bit surprised that Artisan Entertainment isn't going that
cornball route with their film's publicity, for David Koepp's adaptation
of the Richard Matheson novel shares a remarkable amount in common with
the surprise box office phenomenon of the summer.  Unfortunately, one of
those common traits is falling short of complete success.</P>
<P>For all their similarities, _Stir_of_Echoes_ is a completely different
animal from M. Night Shyamalan's film, especially in terms of style. 
Koepp approaches his material in a much more conventional fashion than
Shyamalan, a fact that can best be summed up by a simple comparison.  In
_The_Sixth_Sense_, the now-famous "I see dead people" is spoken roughly
an hour into the film.  In _Stir_of_Echoes_, the psychically gifted
child, Jake Witzky (Zachary David Cope), asks "Does it hurt to be dead?"
to an invisible (but not to him) apparition at about the five-minute
mark.</P>
<P>This sixth sense also comes to be possessed by Jake's father Tom (Kevin
Bacon) after he is put under hypnosis by his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana
Douglas).  What is meant as a harmless lark during a party turns natural
skeptic Tom into a true believer, for he soon has haunting visions of a
mysterious stranger lurking about his house--apparently the same
heretofore invisible one with whom his son has been regularly conversing.</P>
<P>The reasons for the ghostly stranger's visits recall similar points in
_The_Sixth_Sense_, and that's about where the similarities end.  There is
a more menacing edge here that was fairly absent in that film.  A point
that comes into play in _Stir_of_Echoes is how ghosts get angry when not
paid attention to, resulting in some effective scare scenes where Tom and
his family are actually threatened.  The darker shades are reinforced by
Koepp, who employs an effectively flashy visual style that lends an
eeriness to even the more sedate sequences, such as the clever staging of
Tom's hypnosis experience.</P>
<P>The absorbing style and urgent pace of _Stir_of_Echoes_ kept me
interested as it progressed, as opposed to the glacial crawl of
_The_Sixth_Sense_.  In the end, though, my reaction to _Echoes_ was the
inverse of mine to _Sense_: where the latter's much-talked-about ending
nearly redeemed the entire slow-going film for me, the dismayingly
conventional conclusion to _Echoes_ left me soured on the picture.  It's
a contrived standoff/hostage setup that belongs in much lesser film, and
needless to say it completely kills the otherworldly atmosphere that
Koepp had meticulously created.  Never have I seen reality come crashing
down in a film in a more literal--and disappointing--way.</P>
<P>For all its fantastic elements, Rupert Wainwright's supernatural
thriller _Stigmata_ will hold a grounding in reality for a lot of viewers
due to its religious themes.  Any film that deals with religious issues
inevitably comes under fire (witness the storm surrounding Kevin Smith's
forthcoming _Dogma_), and _Stigmata_, which touches upon a fictional
conspiracy within the Vatican, has already been denounced by the Catholic
League.  However, I think the film provides something
valuable--surprisingly serious and intelligent food for thought about
faith and supernatural phenomena.</P>
<P>While the film deals with serious themes, _Stigmata_ is foremost a
thriller, and Wainwright delivers the requisite shocks in telling the
story of Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), an unreligious young
Pittsburgh woman who becomes violently afflicted with the wounds of
Christ on the cross, or stigmata.  Wainwright--perhaps not an obvious
choice for a thriller, given that his last credit was for directing
_Blank_Check_, a Disney vehicle for former _Family_Ties_ moppet Brian
Bonsall--stages these bloody scenes in quick-cut MTV style (not
surprising, since he's also a veteran of music videos), and the usually
annoying effect of such a style works quite well in this context,
succeeding in jolting the audience.</P>
<P>Naturally, a priest enters the scene--Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel
Byrne), a onetime scientist who now serves as an investigator for the
Vatican.  In dealing with Frankie, Father Andrew must come to terms with
his own doubts about his faith.  Sounds very much like _The_Exorcist_,
and much of _Stigmata_, including some of the special effects scenes,
recall that classic.  Also like that film, _Stigmata_'s effects are
lavish without feeling particularly exploitative.  However derivative
some individual aspects are, the fresh ideas of Wainwright and writers
Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage, along with the believable performances of
the cast, give _Stigmata_ its own identity.</P>
<P>Not all of the ideas work, however.  Wainwright's visual style careens
into overkill during the quieter scenes; there are one too many shots of
drops of blood falling into water, not to mention some unnecessarily
emblematic closeups of menial things, such as coffee being poured into a
cup.  He also overuses a device that repeats dialogue spoken in a scene
as a voiceover on the following scene.  The virtual absence of any police
hasn't stopped Lazarus and Ramage from indulging in the reliable cop
cliché where an officer is taken off the case by a superior (in this
instance, Father Andrew by Cardinal Daniel Houseman, played by Jonathan
Pryce).</P>
<P>Even so, _Stigmata_ leaves the audience with more to chew on afterward
that any of the other thrillers currently crowding theatres--including
_The_Sixth_Sense_.  While that film makes one think about things you've
seen during the course of its progression, _Stigmata_ makes one reflect
upon one's personal beliefs and values--and therein lies all the
difference.</P>
