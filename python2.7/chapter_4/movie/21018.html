PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></PRE>
<P>Julien (Ewen Bremner, The Acid House) isn't the most normal kid you will
find in cinema today.  His overbearing, wrestling-obsessed German father
(Werner Herzog) consumes entire bottles of cough syrup before prancing
around the house wearing a gas mask and offering his sons $10 to wear
Mother's wedding dress.  His pregnant sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny, The
Last Days of Disco) also dances – ballet – and calls Julien on the phone
pretending to be their dead mother. Brother Chris (Evan Neumann)
wrestles trashcans.</P>
<P>The trashcan wrestling, for those of you that weren't lucky enough to
see Gummo, is somewhat of an homage to the chair wrestling in
writer/director Harmony Korine's debut film.  Gummo, a critically
maligned freak-fest, was a distinctive masterpiece about two kids that
hunted and killed neighborhood cats and sold them to the local grocery
store, which turned them into fresh ground chuck.  Sure, it sounds like
something to avoid, but the movie was visually stunning, using different
film stock together with still photographs to create a shocking rural
nightmare.  It even made my Top Ten List in 1997.</P>
<P>Korine's new film, however, is a totally different nightmare
altogether.  Officially the first American film (and sixth overall) to
meet the strict rules of the Danish `Dogme' group (no flashbacks, no
artificial light/sound, etc.), julien donkey-boy is a mess.  The story
is virtually non-existent and, because of the Dogme restraints, the film
is much darker and considerably more grainy than Gummo.  Which leaves
only the cavalcade of freaks, including an old man who eats lit
cigarettes, a guy with no arms that plays the drums and does card
tricks, and a black albino that fancies himself a rapper, repeating `I'm
the black albino down from Alabama.'  And don't get me started on the
retard bowling.</P>
<P>I wasn't sure if Julien was supposed to be retarded or not.  He would
certainly seem to be if surrounded by a few normal characters.  Bremner
is also a dead ringer for Rochester Raging Rhinos midfielder Mauro
Biello.  His performance is gutsy and somewhat effective, as I actually
wondered if he may actually have a neurological disorder.  After all, he
did play similar roles in Trainspotting and The Acid House.</P>
<P>Korine explained, after the screening I attended, that he was approached
to join the Dogme group after Gummo and that the filming of julien
donkey-boy was closely monitored by several Danish supervisors.  The
movie was mostly improvised (save the phone call between Julien and his
dead mom) and Korine used about thirty digital cameras during filming.
Korine preferred the initial cut of the film, which ran at an ungodly
six-and-a-half hours, and, when asked if the picture was real in any
way, stated that the picture was based on `a true inspiration.'</P>
<P>1:34 – R for mild violence, adult language and situations</P>
