<P>     How we deal with death is as important as how we deal with life.  
In fact, how we deal with death affects how we deal with life.  That's 
the central theme of Pascale Ferran's celebrated first feature, COMING 
TO TERMS WITH THE DEAD, which won the Camera d'Or for best picture at 
the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.  The childhood trauma of losing someone 
close forms the common underpinning of three stories that examine how 
death transforms the survivors, both in the short- and long-term.</P>
<P>     The first segment of the triptych focuses on Jumbo, a nine and one-
half year old who has lost his best friend to cancer.  Jumbo is racked 
by guilt over this loss, feeling that he somehow should have had the 
power to stop it.  To cope with the unexpected void, the boy has created 
an elaborate ritual in which he ventures into an abandoned underground 
chamber and lights candles in memory of the dead so that, for as long as 
he remembers them, their souls can remain free from the "brokers of 
nothingness" that consign forgotten spirits to oblivion.</P>
<P>     The second and third episodes view another loss -- that of a young 
girl killed more than twenty years ago in a moped accident -- from the 
perspectives of her younger brother and older sister.  Francois and Zaza 
are very different people, but both have been scarred by this same 
childhood tragedy.  Zaza, always regarded as "the strong one", finds 
that, in middle age, her hard facade is cracking.  She's suffering from 
insomnia and breaks into tears at the most unexpected times.  Francois, 
who collects and classifies insects, is fascinated by death as "a 
condition of precision".</P>
<P>     The three stories unfold in a leisurely manner, as a series of 
disjointed, seemingly-random flashbacks which emerge during a summer 
afternoon that the characters spend at the beach, watching Francois and 
Zaza's older brother, Vincent, build an elaborate sand castle.  The 
castle, the film's central image, is a monumental symbol to both the 
ephemeral nature of life and the resilience of the human spirit.  
Although something so meticulously-constructed and beautiful can be torn 
down easily, with patience, it can also be built up again.</P>
<P>     Ferran never insults the audience's intelligence, nor does she make 
concessions to the inattentive.  Her unique narrative style forces 
viewers to piece together multi-dimensional pictures of the three main 
characters.  However, even though all the holes aren't filled in, and 
the sequence of events is presented in a jumbled, non-chronological 
order, Ferran's techniques of remaining with one character through an 
extended series of flashbacks and repeating scenes in the present from 
different viewpoints keeps confusion to a minimum.  It's actually easy 
to understand where each scene fits in the overall story, and which 
character a flashback pertains to. </P>
<P>     Ferran's unconventional style has much to do with the film's 
success.  By presenting her triptych in this manner, she infuses three 
relatively-simple stories with a constant sense of discovery.  On the 
surface, nothing much happens during this day at the beach -- a bunch of 
people sit around watching the construction of a sand castle.  But, 
through Ferran's keen probing, we see into the souls of Jumbo, Francois, 
and Zaza.  And, for those of us in the audience, that makes this 
ordinary sun-soaked day a momentous occasion.</P>
