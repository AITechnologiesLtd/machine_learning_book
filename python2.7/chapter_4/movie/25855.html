<PRE>"Bring It On"</PRE>
<P>The Toro cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High School is at the top of the
game. The six-time national champions have a new captain, Torrance Shipman
(Kirsten Dunst), and it looks like they are on their way to a seventh. Until,
that is, Torrance learns that the Toro's kick-ass routine is stolen from another
cheerleading squad, the Clovers, leading to a moral dilemma for the new team
leader in "Bring It On."</P>
<P>The world of cheerleading at the national competitive level has never, as far as
I know, been the subject of a feature film. The picture that comes to my mind
when I hear the word "cheerleader" harkens back to my days in high school (many
moons ago) when the 'leaders were pretty, stuck up chicks who had their
exclusive clique and ignored everyone who didn't belong. (OK, so I was a shy kid
who didn't too well with girls back then.) Tyro helmer Peyton Reed and
first-time screenwriter Jessica Bendinger shatter that image with a neatly done
moral teenage tale about competition, honor and integrity. Winning isn't
everything in "Bring It On," but honesty and fair play are.</P>
<P>The story, extensively researched by Bendinger, has a notable lack of parental
involvement in the cheerleading lives of the principles. This is actually a
strength breathe of fresh air for the film, with Torrance and rival team captain
Isis (Gabrielle Union) acting out of dedication and love for their sport, not
out of some pressure by mom or dad. I call cheerlead competition a sport
because, at the regional and national level, you are looking at kids who have
trained as hard as any other athlete and are the best in combining gymnastic
skill and dance choreography. I knew nothing about the whole cheerleading thing
going in to "Bring It On." Afterward, I did a little research and talked with
parents of cheerleaders. I was assured that the movie, as I described it, has
the ring of authenticity.</P>
<P>The moral nature of the script builds very strong characters in Torrance, Isis,
and the others. Kirsten Dunst does a fine job as the newly elected captain who
learns from transfer student Missy (Eliza Dushku) that Torrance's champion
cheerleading squad has been gaining kudos by using stolen material. It turns out
that the Toro's former captain Big Red (Lindsay Sloane) had surreptitiously
videotaped a rival team, the Clovers from Compton High, and homogenized the hip
hop routine for the more white bread Rancho Carne High School squad. Not
believing that her team's success is based on theft, Torrance agrees to go see
the Clovers with Missy.</P>
<P>Torrance is stunned by the blatant rip-off of the other team's excellent
performance. The Clovers are every bit as good as the Toros, but their economic
circumstances in their blue-collar neighborhood has kept them from competing at
the regional and national level. When Isis confronts Torrance and accuses her of
being another spy for the Toros, the right-minded Torrance insists that her team
completely redo their routine with only six weeks to the nationals, causing a
rift in team spirit. Meanwhile, she coaxes her father (the only time parents
show up to any degree and they just to fork out money) to collect the funds
needed to bring the Clovers to the nationals, too. (In an inexplicable move,
Isis tears up the from-the-heart check and the Clovers get to the big show by
other means. I thought that the heartfelt and meaningful gesture by Torrance was
unnecessarily snubbed.)</P>
<P>The Toros go through the painful exploration of reinventing their performance,
going to the expensive pains of hiring a choreographer, Sparky Polastri (Ian
Roberts), who turns out to be a con artist selling the same cheer routine up and
down the California coast. Of course, just when she is at the end of her rope,
Torrance is inspired by Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford), the romantic
interest the pretty team captain keeps denying exists, and a new cheer routine
is born. Once all these ends are tied together, the big finale at the nationals
kicks into gear. I won't discuss the outcome, but it is one heck of a bang for
the little movie.</P>
<P>The kids surrounding the principal characters get a chance to flesh out their
own characters, if only a little bit. Eliza Dushku ("True Lies") plays the part
of Torrance's conscience as she points out the fraud of their routine. She
sticks by Torrance when she knows her new friend will do what is right. Jesse
Bradford ("King of the Hill") is good looking and has the presence to provide
the almost unnecessary, but obligatory, romantic interest. Members of the music
group Blaque - Natina Reed, Shamari Fears and Brandi Wiiliams - are very cool
and talented as the key members of the Clovers, giving attitude to the Toros and
rightfully so. Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback, as Courtney and Whitney, are
the dim-bulb stereotype Rancho Carne High squad members, but their pride in
being dumb but pretty and popular has a certain charm.</P>
<P>There are a number of teams and routines shown during the competition sequences
and they are uniformly exciting with energy and fine choreography. The
filmmakers and the kids on the screen make what is very hard look easy and
graceful. Cheers to dance master Nancy Rae Stone and cheerleading choreographer
Ray Jasper for their fine contribution to a good teen flick.</P>
<P>As you'd expect, it all comes down to the best team winning, but "Bring It On"
stresses that it is the healthy competition and desire to do one's best for self
and team that count. And don't go thinking that the sport of cheerleading is all
girls. The press material states that "97% of all cheerleaders are female,
however, 50% of all collegiate cheerleaders are male." When a youngster gets to
that level - the best of the high schoolers are shown here - the athletic
abilities and physical strength of a guy is an absolute necessity in pulling of
the remarkable tosses and flips they do. This is a good date flick for older
teens and a good roll model movie for younger girls.</P>
<P>"Bring It On" doesn't preach political correctness, just a good moral tale of
right versus wrong and why doing the right thing is necessary. If kids are
raised believing these simple, but important, concepts then the world will
indeed be a better place. It's nice to see a well-crafted, thoughtful film that
shows what kids are like at their best. I give it a B.</P>
