<PRE>THE MATRIX (1999)
Review by Matt Pusateri</PRE>
<P>With many big-budget science fiction films, great ideas are often wasted by
bad scripts, cheesy plot twists, and, terrible acting. The Fifth Element,
The Abyss, and Godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting,
writing, or both. At first glance, The Matrix, Larry & Andy Wachowski's
sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular, looks like a prime candidate to join
the list of high-concept bad movies, especially with dopey Keanu Reeves in
the leading role. But despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue, The
Matrix works. It's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that
borrows from dozens of other films (most obviously the Terminator films,
Star Wars, and Total Recall), but remains refreshingly original and
interesting throughout.</P>
<P>Reeves plays Neo, a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially
bewildering set of encounters with "Trinity" (Carrie-Anne Moss), a rival
hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks, a unseen,
omniscient cult figure known as "Morpheus" (Lawrence Fishburne), and a trio
of creepy men in dark suits who act like IRS agents from Hell. Neo quickly
learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems.
Moreover, he discovers that the grim, bleak world he is introduced to has
been waiting for him to save it. Neo is reluctant to assume the role of
messiah, with grave doubts that he is actually "The One" prophesized to come
and save the world.</P>
<P>Reluctant or not, what follows is a mix of Hong Kong-style slow-motion
shootouts, surreal dream sequences, high speed chases, and comic book
Kung-Fu fights. The film also raises interesting philosophical questions
about reality. How exactly do you know what is real and what is in your
mind? And if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one
you were living in, would you want to face the true world or continue to
live in a more comfortable illusion? Unfortunately, The Matrix doesn't
provide many answers to the questions it raises, but at least it puts some
ideas behind all the explosions, shoot-outs, and flying roundhouse kicks.</P>
<P>Perhaps stealing the entire show in The Matrix is Australian actor Hugo
Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, the leader of the creepy agents in
sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything
to stop Neo and friends from destabilizing the Matrix. Weaving's stony
appearance, deadpan voice, and chilling comments put a grim human face on
the haunting, evil technological force that controls the Matrix. Like Robert
Patrick as the shapeshifting T-1000 Terminator in Terminator 2: Judgement
Day, Weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot
because, despite his power and seeming invincibility, he looks ordinary,
even scrawny. Weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence.</P>
<P>The film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish
cinematography. It seems to be deliberately kitchy, with stylized fight
sequences directed by Hong Kong stunt specialist Wo Ping that reportedly
required months of martial arts training by the actors. In a few scenes, the
posing and posturing is unintentionally funny. Just seeing Keanu Reeves
engaging in serious Kung Fu is a bit jarring. However, with the comic-book
style and tone of the film, you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to
enjoy the ride without losing patience.</P>
<P>The Matrix isn't a classic. Its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises
more questions than it answers. It fails to resolve many of its own plot
twists and philosophical questions. It also relies on some conventional
sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that
most of the film avoids. Reportedly, the producers have high hopes for the
film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story
for the sequel. Unfortunately, audiences deserve a little more than a vague
sense that the story will continue in the future. The Matrix is an fun,
enjoyable diversion, like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival. Just
don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry.</P>
