                      FAIRYTALE: A TRUE STORY 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon

              2  :-) :-)  for the fairies in the backgarden</PRE>
<P>Cast: Florence Hoath, Elizabeth Earl, Paul McGann, Phoebe Nicholls,

<P>If someone told me there were pixies picking daisies on my front lawn
and sprites were salting salami in my back garden, I would smile and ask
them whether the wicked witch of the west was cleaning my roof as
ordered. What the heck, I'm in need of some recreational fantasy and if
sprites and pixies want to do my gardening and cooking, then by all
means let them.</P>
<P>In this magical tale of tiny people with wings, two little girls have
claims to fairies frolicking in their neck of the woods. If you don't
believe them, they can always whip out their Kodak shots of the
momentous occasion. This is a true story in the sense that these events
too place in the early twentieth century, and does not is any way imply
that fairies are true. In the grand scheme of things we have two
prominent historical figures like Houdidi (Harvey Keitel) and Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle (Peter O'Toole), involved and scrutinising the photos of the
fairies. In may ways their presence makes this tale more real to life,
as it shows us that lots of people were interested with the photos at
the time, and more importantly - this is not just some washed up tale
from an outhouse.</P>
<P>With the miracle of special effects, the fairies in question are brought
to life more magically on screen than perhaps in life. However, their
screen presence is sadly limited to the occasional midnight flickering
appearance in the garden. This is unfortunate because the fairies are
this movies highlight and I felt the audience wanted to see more fairies
in action and less humans bumbling about. Harvey Keitel makes an
interesting interpretation of Houdini and O'Toole is very suitable in
the role of Conan Doyle. There is also a special cameo appearance of a
fellow Australian towards the end of the movie.</P>
<P>So the question on everybody's mind is whether or not to believe the two
girls? My response is - does it really matter? The fairies aren't here
to invade the world, cause mass genocide or to destroy it with pollution
and nuclear weapons. So let the girls believe in fairies if they want to
and if you had a little imagination in your life, perhaps you should
too.</P>
