<PRE>WHOOPIN' SEXISM</PRE>
<P>For a movie that aims to dispel the prejudicial stereotypes of sexism, THE
ASSOCIATE may succeed in some aspects, but it ends up falling into a
patterned plot and perpetuating other forms of sexism.</P>
<P>What is the role of a woman in the ruthlessly competitive and
testorone-tilted world of Wall Street? She could be a secretary and get
called "sweetie," or she could do all the work and let her male partner take
all the credit. After all, if business deals are to be closed in strip bars,
a woman can hardly expect any respect. Perhaps she should get breast
enlargements. At the very least, she would then be able to get some
attention, proceeding then to sleep her way to the top. Through it all, she
must never show her temper, for it would surely be interpreted as
pre-menstrual syndrome. Such a starkly stereotupical but realistic portrait
of corporate culture is portrayed in THE ASSOCIATE.</P>
<P>It seems as if the only way a woman can break down the
barriers errected by the Wall Street Boys' Club is to
become a man, which is precisely what Whoopi Goldberg's character, Laurel
Ayres, does. As a financial analyst who fails to get the recognition she
deservesbecause of her gender and race, she creates and subsequently dons
the persona of the fictitious Robert Cutty. Using her intelligence and
business savvy behind the persona of this imaginary White, Caucasian
male,she achives exceptional success. her partner in crime is fellow
secretary Sally, played engagingly by two-time Academy Award winning Dianne
Wiest. However, hilarious fixes arise when Cutty's fabricated persona
becomes the target of the insatiable media, makes deals with Laurel's
devious competitor (portrayed with wicked gleefulness by Tim Daly), gets
subpoenaed for fraud, and even "fathers" a child.</P>
<P>Whoopi Goldberg's androgynous appeal, comic talent and intelligence lend
realism and humour to the character of Laurel. As an African-American woman
overcoming discrimination and beating the odds, we champion her cause and
what she represents. However, Goldberg's portrayal fails to illicit sympathy
and audience-identification. As with THE COLOR PURPLE, her steely edge and
street-smarts make her unbelievable as a marginalized and exploited figure.</P>
<P>Furthermore, even as it continues to be a ver real and pressing issue today,
the storline of Black Woman versus White Man seems cliched when dealth with
in comedy, especially since the possibility was raised back in the sixties
of God being a Black Woman. In addition, the disguise strategy recalls films
like MRS DOUBTFIRE and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, and makes the plot's unfolding
highly predictable.</P>
<P>Finally, even as the movie shatters female stereotypes, it perpetuates male
ones. The mend o not develop beyond being cariacatures of the manipulative
businessman, the fumbling nerd genius and the sensitive new-age man. As such
there is an imbalance in the treatment of issues of prejudice. Directed by
Donald Petrie, known for such hit comedies as MYSTIC PIZZA and GRUMPY OLD
MEN, THE ASSOCIATE merely retells, albeit with the slightest dash of humour,
a well-known tale of sexism in today's society.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
* Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
