<P>Brad (Brian Van Holt), Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams) and Zeke (Zorie Barber) 
convene once a week over Sunday breakfast to compare scamming notes from the 
previous two nights. No - they aren't credit card thieves, door-to-door 
salesman or even sleazy businessmen. They are "scammers" or, for those of you 
as apparently out of it as me, "swingers" or, for those of you who missed 
that educational 1996 film as well, they are what the parents of Generation-X 
refer to as "womanizers." Yep, the trio have Friday and Saturday night to get 
through as many women as possible or - in the case of one member with a 
masturbation obsession - come up with as interesting a set of stories as 
imaginable. There is a fourth member of their clan, Eric (Judah Domke), but 
he is two-years married and his encounters with post-marital sex - no matter 
how interesting (and some of them are quite exotic) - nauseate the group.</P>
<P>Oddly enough, the group's ventures are wonderfully entertaining in a very 
primitive, chauvinistic manner and should give single male audiences - 
especially those Gen-Xers with notoriously hyper-inflated egos - a great deal 
of pleasure to watch so long as they don't realize that they are laughing at 
themselves. Those who enjoyed other cheaply-made examinations of dating like 
Kevin Smith's "Clerks" and the aforementioned "Swingers" - both dignified 
cult-classics - should appreciate the biting reality of "Whipped" as the film 
examines how the three sleazy pals will cope with each other when they all 
fall for the same gal, Mia (Amanda Peet) and break the first rule of dating: 
"bros before hoes, pals before gals." And for those who envy the slick world 
of scamming, the film could, in many ways, serve as a starter's manual 
complete with a few sets of pickup lines and plenty of performance tips like 
how a man can enhance his taste to a female if consuming pineapple juice 
before receiving fellatio. </P>
