<P>The perennial problem with film buffs is the belief that filmmakers are fine
wines.  That, due to the name of such and such, said film will undoubtedly
be good.  Oh, they'll say: `it's a Van Sant, circa 1989' or a `Spielberg.'
To an outsider to this particular argot, one would almost find the Napa
Valley and the San Fernando Valley indistinguishable… both homes of fine
craftsman of a product of whateverness.  As From Dusk Till Dawn proves, this
is not the case.</P>
<P>Both a `Rodriguez' and a `Tarantino,' still manages to be a fairly
unengaging vintage filled with little humor, a go-nowhere plot, and a
vampire mythology so far off the norm that From Dusk Till Dawn's only
redeeming value is in self-parody.  And call me someone who doesn't
appreciate Tarantino's or Rodriguez's innate genius, but said self-parody
fails to do anything for me.</P>
<P>Of course, this in and of itself isn't the really disappointing factor in
>From Dusk till Dawn.  Schlock horror in and of itself makes for interesting
viewing and psuedo intelligent insults.  From Dusk till Dawn, however, doesn
't choose to go campy or go artsy.  It does both.  It starts off by
introducing Seth (Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino) Gekko, two brothers who
have robbed a bank and are now heading for Mexico to get sanctuary in a town
called El Ray.  Seth is cool, calm, professional: a cold sociopath who cares
about nothing more than getting the job done.  Richie, on the other hand, is
a full blown psychosexual pervert.  He rapes women, he kills for no reason,
and he's absolutely paranoid.  On the other side of the tracks lie Jacob and
Kate Fuller (Keitel and Lewis), an ex-minister and his daughter, both low on
their faith.</P>
<P>So how do we become a movie about a bunch of stripper vampires?  You've got
me.</P>
<P>I really could tell you how this film descends into the utter madness at
which it ends up, but it doesn't seem to matter.  All that matters is that
>From Dusk till Dawn is good until it gets in the bar, and then it sucks
worse than the vampires it depicts.</P>
