Running time: 120 minutes.</P>
<P>The tortured life of gifted but flawed musicians has provided
some rich material for film makers over the years.  Former documentary
director Anand Tucker's stylish and touching film depicting the life
of tragically doomed world renowned cellist Jacqueline Du Pre is
nearer to the moving realism of Scott Hicks' brilliant Shine than it
is to the excesses of Ken Russell's tasteless and exuberant biopics
(Mahler, The Music Lovers, etc).</P>
<P>Hilary And Jackie looks at the complex relationship between
Jacqueline, who eventually succumbed to multiple sclerosis, and her
older sister Hilary, an acclaimed flautist whose career never really
took off to the same extent.  This earnest film is a telling
exploration of sibling rivalry, the sense of competition between
artists, the weight of living up to expectations, and the toll that it
inevitably takes.</P>
<P>As youngsters, the two girls were driven to succeed by their
pushy mother (Celia Imrie).  Hilary was the early achiever in the
family, but when Jackie's prowess with the cello thrust her into the
limelight their respective fortunes and careers took very different
paths.  Hilary (Aussie actress Rachel Griffiths) eventually married
and settled down in a remote farmhouse to raise a family, while Jackie
(played by Emily Watson, from Breaking The Waves, etc) embarked on a
mammoth European tour that took a huge physical and emotional toll.</P>
<P>Drawing largely upon Hilary Du Pre's own memoir about her
sister, British writer Frank Cottrell Boyce (Butterfly Kiss, etc)
brings the characters to life in an intelligent and detailed script
that avoids the usual clichés of the biopic.  The narrative traces
the different fortunes of the two sisters, and some key emotional
events are seen from two perspectives.  Hilary And Jackie spans some
thirty years, moving from the post war austerity of 1950's England
through to the 1980's, although Tucker doesn't overload the film with
conscious period references or tiresome details.  Tucker (best known
for The Vampire's Life, his documentary about author Anne Rice) makes
his feature debut with Hilary And Jackie, and he brings a sense of
gritty realism to the material.  David Johnson's camera constantly
prowls around the stage, bringing life and a sense of energy to
otherwise static scenes.  Tucker draws a pair of superb performances
from his two actresses.  Griffiths delivers a more restrained
performance, but she captures the sense of frustration and failure
experience by Hilary, who feels slighted that she is often overlooked
and remains in the shadow of her sister's achievements.  Watson has
the meatier role as the sexually precocious, selfish and intense
Jackie.  She has to deal with depression and debilitating illness, and
she delivers a powerful and draining performance that elicits
begrudging sympathy for this doomed figure.  Both should have good
reason to feel a little miffed that they were beaten at the Oscars by
a couple of lightweight performances from Shakespeare In Love.</P>
<P>James Frain (recently seen in Elizabeth, etc) delivers a solid
performance as Daniel Barenboim, the Argentinian pianist who married
Jackie.</P>
