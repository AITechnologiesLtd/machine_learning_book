<P>Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan shot to fame in the summer of 1999 with 
the release of his highly effective "The Sixth Sense," which, due to having 
one of the most extraordinary twist endings in film history, gradually became 
one of the top-grossing motion pictures of all time. "The Sixth Sense" was 
such a powerful stunner, in fact, that it possibly helped and hurt 
Shyamalan's future directing efforts. The film's success proved that he was a 
fresh and exciting new filmmaker, but also put a very large feat over his 
head in attempting to top its predecessor. </P>
<P>Everyone who sees M. Night Shyamalan's latest endeavor, "Unbreakable," will 
unfairly be comparing it to "The Sixth Sense," which is a shame. In its own 
way, "Unbreakable" is as just as much a one-of-a-kind film, if not quite as 
air-tight in every aspect. Both movies are similar in many stylistic ways, 
and it will always be clear who is at the helm here for anyone whose seen 
"The Sixth Sense." Both movies are moody and foreboding, and their 
intentionally gloomy cinematography stands as a symbol of where the 
characters stand in their lives. There is even a subplot in both concerning 
marital discord. The similarities stop here, as "Unbreakable" is a completely 
different type of movie, with separate goals in mind, and a gratifying payoff 
that isn't quite as shocking as the one in "The Sixth Sense," but every bit 
as necessary in completing Shyamalan's complete intentions.</P>
<P>David Dunne (Bruce Willis) is a Franklin Field security guard in Philadelphia 
who is traveling home from a job interview in New York by train. Following a 
failed attempt to strike up a fling with a pretty fellow passenger (Leslie 
Stefanson), the train is involved in a tragic freak accident leaving 131 
passengers dead, and one survivor: David. Even more mysterious is the fact 
that David is not only alive, but escaped completely unscathed of even a 
minor cut or bruise. Returning home to his young son (Spencer Treat Clark) 
and a lifeless marriage to his wife, Audrey (Robin Wright Penn), David takes 
up where he left off with his job as security guard, but grows intrigued when 
he receives a note on the window shield of his car asking how many days he 
has been sick in his life.</P>
<P>The writer of the note turns out to be comic book art dealer Elijah Price 
(Samuel L. Jackson), who was born with a rare disease leaving his bones 
terribly brittle and particularly apt to injury. When David finally realizes 
that he has never grown ill before, nor has he ever been injured (save for a 
near-drowning as a child), he is aided by Elijah in progressively setting 
into action the true reason why he survived the train crash, and more 
precisely, why he was put on the earth.</P>
<P>It's no secret to say that "Unbreakable" is sort of like a reality-based 
superhero movie, since this plot development is hinted at even before the 
first frame of film and comes into play fifteen minutes in. What is so 
special about the picture, however, is in the way that it follows this story 
thread throughout, unfolding with a deliberate pace that remains intriguing 
due to its great amount of detail and character nuances. To give away any 
more of the movie than has already been mentioned would be criminal, as much 
of the film's satisfaction evolves from not knowing where the story is 
leading.</P>
<P>While the relatively slow pace of "The Sixth Sense" helped to make the 
frightening sequences all the more startling and the ending all the more 
meaningful, the occasionally lethargic tone of "Unbreakable" proves 
problematic. Although never boring or tedious, the movie is nearly devoid of 
anything resembling happiness or humor. The characters remain in depressingly 
downbeat lives free of any sort of joy, and it is difficult to grow close to 
anyone because of this approach. We care about their welfare, even as we wish 
they would show a little more human emotion aside from overwhelming sadness. 
It is Shyamalan's one downfall, but should be noted.</P>
<P>Ever since wisely realizing his career was at a standstill with his endless 
action movie roles, Bruce Willis has found a much-needed resurgence in his 
career, and rightfully so. Willis is very good as the confused protagonist, 
and his low-key performance does nothing but help to convey a character 
filled with insecurities and flaws, who isn't quite sure how to mend the 
damage he has done in his life, particularly with his rocky marriage. Samuel 
L. Jackson, as the elusively kind Elijah, brings added flavor to his role of 
a man who turned to comic books as a child as a way of dealing with his 
health problems.</P>
<P>The supporting cast have less-meaty roles, but some are just as memorable. 
Robin Wright Penn poignantly presents Audrey as a physical therapist who 
spends her time helping others when its her own life that needs the most 
mending. She longs to recapture the spark in her relationship with David, as 
sees his surviving of the crash as a strong sign that the time to do such a 
thing is now. As David and Audrey's pre-teen son, Spencer Treat Clark has got 
the whole brooding-kid act down flat, but doesn't have enough to work with to 
make him entirely sympathetic. And Charlayne Woodard, as Elijah's loving 
mother, projects nothing but sweetness and caring in a movie that is 
otherwise absent of such adjectives.</P>
<P>"Unbreakable" is a mostly spellbinding drama that may not be the spectacular 
achievement of Shyamalan's last film, but why does it--or should it--have to 
be? There is no doubt that he knows exactly how to write and direct 
thought-provoking pieces of work, and he has only confirmed this here. In the 
end, the movie finds the one vital missing link that puts everything that has 
come before into perspective. The conclusion is unpredictable and a little 
surprising, but it's necessary, rather than a simple plot device to one-up 
"The Sixth Sense." Ultimately, "Unbreakable" is a truly impressive rumination 
about the importance of finding meaning in every person's life, and not 
letting that purpose put to waste. </P>
