<PRE>                                  HEAVEN AND EARTH
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros

"Me and men don't mix."
                - Le Ly</PRE>
<P>     Director Oliver Stone completes his "Vietnam Trilogy" with HEAVEN
AND EARTH, a story that's told, for a change, from the perspective of
"the other side."  Based upon the real life story of Vietnamese peasant
Le Ly, Stone delivers another satisfying, but, this time, heavy-handed
lesson in war and peace.</P>
<P>     The story introduces the simple rice-farming community of Ky La.
It's a lush paradise in Central Vietnam, relatively unscathed until the
arrival of the Viet Cong in '63.  Young Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le) watches her
brothers join the Communists, who return one night to torture and rape
her.  (The 'Cong, that is.)  She escapes the bedlam by fleeing to Saigon
at age 18.  There, she works for a wealthy, married master who, promptly,
gets her pregnant.</P>
<PRE>     And all this before turning 20!</PRE>
<P>     Later on, Le Ly meets a nice American soldier (Jones).  They get
married, he's nuts, and her life takes another terrible turn when she
moves to America.  All, so she can return to her homeland, many years
later, and deliver a touching message about the value of strife and
suffering....</P>
<P>     Taken at face value, most of HEAVEN AND EARTH is an interesting
and, ultimately, satisfying examination of war.  But the director lays
it too thick this time--hammering every point across at least a dozen
times too many.</P>
<P>     His most annoying technique is how he punctuates every Important
Moment with a short, slow-motion montage of Important Images.  This bit
works well for, about, five times, then grows grating.</P>
<P>     Of course, after the first hour, the viewer is already pretty numb
from the raw drama.  Happily, at the ninety-minute mark--when Tommy
Lee Jones shows up--Stone takes a breather and lets some levity into
his film.  Granted, it lasts for all of twenty minutes, but, oh, how
sweet it is!</P>
<P>     Stone mines some surprising humor out of Le Ly's arrival in
America.  Classic bits include her first encounter with a full
refrigerator and a wide-eyed visit to her first supermarket.</P>
<P>     As the supremely oppressed Le Ly, newcomer Hiep Thi Le is quite a
find.  She displays a good range of emotions and some surprising signs
of subtly.  Tommy Lee Jones is equally watchable.  He's at his most
menacing, though, in his later scenes.  Both Joan Chen and Haing S.
Ngor barely register playing Le Ly's parents.  Go figure.</P>
<P>     Look for Debbie Reynolds, who makes her first screen appearance in
over twenty years.</P>
<P>     Technical credits are all very fine, with the exception of a bit
too much filtered lighting.  What's the haze for, Ollie?</P>
<PRE>Bottom line: Oliver Stone completes his "Vietnam Trilogy" with
             HEAVEN AND EARTH, the solemn and staggering story
             of real-life Vietnamese peasant Le Ly.  With exceptions
             for the director's sledge-hammer style, this is fairly
             satisfying stuff.
Grade: B</PRE>
