<P>       "The Wings of the Dove" --which is "inspired by the novel by
Henry James," according to the press notes-- lifts James' basic
situation and characters but ignores the extensive backstories that
clutter the book, as well as the judgmental tone the author seemed to
take toward his anti-heroine Kate Croy (luminously played by Helena
Bonham Carter). Kate is rescued from a life of destitution with her
opium-addict father (Michael Gambon) by a generous but domineering
Aunt Maude (Charlotte Rampling) who frowns on Kate's beloved, a
penniless journalist named Merton Denscher (Linus Roache). Marriage to
Merton is out of the question, since it would mean Kate being cut off
from both 1910 London society and her aunt's much-needed money. "You
make her sound like a witch," gasps Kate's new friend Milly (Alison
Elliott), when Kate crabs about Maude's restrictions on her. "Oh no,"
Kate says, "she can't fly. . .yet."</P>
<P>Milly, an American innocent with millions in the bank, an eye
for Merton and a cough like Camille's, becomes Kate's unlikely
passport to happiness. What if Merton could be persuaded to woo the
terminally ill heiress? Then she might leave him her fortune, making
it possible for Kate to escape Maude's clutches and marry the man of
her choice.</P>
<P>"The Wings of the Dove" is almost a sort of
turn-of-the-century "Indecent Proposal," with the canals of Venice
standing in for the casinos of Vegas. But though Hossein Amini's
eloquent screenplay brings to the surface the eroticism James only
hinted at, it doesn't neglect the fascinating psychology of the
characters, all of whom have their own agendas and desires to
satisfy. Director Ian Softley (best known for "Backbeat") keeps the
picture sailing along at a surprisingly brisk pace for a period-piece,
and he's gotten exceptional performances from everyone in his cast,
particularly Roache, who conveys Merton's troubled conscience
exquisitely, and Carter, who makes sure we understand Kate's scheming
is motivated by love and desperation, and not by maliciousness.</P>
<P>One of the fascinating sidelights in "Dove" deals with a
skid-row doctor who "repairs" child prostitutes and sends them back
out on the streets with "virginity certificates"; though the Age of
Innocence is gone, those British do like to keep up appearances. James
