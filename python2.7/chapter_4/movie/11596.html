<PRE>                               EVEREST</PRE>
<P>For starters, anyone who has never attended an IMAX screening has
missed out on a new kind of amazing movie.   With a screen five to
eight stories high and some ninety feet wide, the panorama is
magnificent.   Add that IMAX films are photographed in 70 millimeter
film so that unbelievably crisp, sharp focus prevails  This huge
encompassing brings you right into the picture as if you were there.</P>
<P>In this thrilling movie, a documentary of mountain climbers, both men
and women, who want to conquer the very highest mountain peak on
Earth located in China we are made to feel as if we know them; we
understand to some degree their drive, their belief they can make it
to the top despite many attempts by others having ended in the
tragedy of frostbite and death because of the terrible windstorms and
avalanches.</P>
<P>MacGillivray Freeman Films was fortunate enough to have two veterans
of Mt. Everest leading the group, filmmaker David Brashears and Ed
Viesturs, America's leading Himalayan mountaineer.   Jamling Tenzing
of Norway and Araceli Segarra, the latter wanting to be the first
Spanish woman to reach the peak, were among those along with 8 other
climbers, 50 porters and 100 yaks who were on this expedition.   The
cameras follow the intrepid adventurers ascent, the interim places
where they stop to rest, the Sherpa villages, the base camps.</P>
<P> With oxygen content of the air becoming thinner and thinner with
each new altitude, they are aware that the body must be allowed to
accustom itself.  To go straight up, even if one could, would mean
death.  These are some of the things the climbers have to keep in
mind.    Later, when they are near the top, the lack of oxygen
combines with the utter weariness to cause them to lose their normal
behavior and reasoning.   Climbing is but one of the obstacles they
have to face.</P>
<P>We are shown the gear used to climb, to span chasms,   But the
filming of the ascent required heroic work of getting cameras and
film to the top where helicopters found it hard to go because there
was not enough air to be gripped by the blades.</P>
<P>Breathtaking vistas, sweeping panoramas, fierce winds and snow storms
are the norm in this magnificent film.  For an adventure unlike most
others, EVEREST cannot be beat.</P>
