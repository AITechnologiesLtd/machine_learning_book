<P>   A colleague swears that he saw a picture in one of those
gossip magazines featuring Richard Gere with Cheryl
Crawford on one arm and the Dalai Lama on the other.  Why
not?  No words can better sum up the Richard Gere who eats
up the screen in "The Red Corner," a picture which is so
cleverly digitalized that you'd swear that the action was taking
place in and around Beijing's Tienanmen Square.  With an
opening timed to coincide with the high-profile visit of China's
president, Jiang Zemin, "Red Corner" is an effective
representation of Gere's views on the current Chinese regime
while demonstrating that he has the highest regard for its
pretty women.  (The dreamily intense, socially-conscious 48-
year-old actor made an impassioned plea for the sovereignty
of Tibet at the 1992 Academy Awards ceremony, a year after
campaigning for worldwide AIDS awareness.  If you're not too
clear on the connection between China's human rights abuses
and the situation in its western province, see the equally
politically-correct movie, "Seven Days in Tibet.")</P>
<P>   While some films made by Chinese themselves such as
"The Story of Qui Ju" more artfully criticize that country's
political conditions, they cannot match Hollywood for the slick
melodrama which director Jon Avnet delivers for his audience. 
Gere, his hair grayed over and closely cropped, is cast in the
role of an businessman competing for a lucrative contract in a
potentially huge market.  China is undergoing radical change,
some of its younger politicians eager to bring in sexy Western
entertainment to replace some of the more stolid forms of
diversion.  Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is competing with a
German executive on a plan to bring in American satellite
technology to one fourth of the world's population.  Seduced
by a model, Hong Ling (Jessey Meng)--who seems intent on
sketching Moore's long nose--he wakes up in a hotel to
discover his playmate murdered and is dragged away by
police.</P>
<P>   The bulk of the story deals with Moore's unfortunate
experience with the Chinese legal system and his more
fortuitous relationship with his lovely, intelligent and charming
attorney, Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling), who has been appointed by
the court to defend him.  Insisting that the best defense is a
guilty plea--which would almost automatically spare him from
an ignominious execution within a week of the trial's
conclusion--Shen is frustrated by her client's insistence on
proving his innocence.  </P>
<P>   Director Avnet allows considerable time for romantic and
sentimental attachments to develop between client and
lawyer.  She is unmarried in a culture that considers
singularity to be offensive but complains that China's one
billion men are too threatened by her intelligence to ask her
out.  He is a widowed graduate of Harvard College and
Stanford Law School, all the more desirable to Shen because
he did not grow up as the pampered son of a capitalist family-
-he worked his way through higher education serving at rich
people's parties.  </P>
<P>   Nor does Avnet disappoint the action-adventure crowd,
cramming an absurd, though heart-pounding chase as a
handcuffed murder defendant rushes toward the American
Embassy in a dash for sanctuary. </P>
<P>   As in so many paranoid thrillers, the American officials are
almost as villainous as the real enemy, in this case providing
the businessman with little help because sensitive trade talks
are under way between the U.S. and China--a clear reference
to President Bill Clinton's alleged refusal to insist more
strongly that China takes steps toward greater human rights in
return for lucrative agreements with the States.</P>
<P>   "The Red Corner" has its heart in the right place, even
allowing its lead Chinese actress to argue that the U.S. is no
paradise but rather a country with only one-sixth of China's
population but with ten times its murder rate.  Politically,
though, the movie--from Robert King's screenplay--is whipping
a dead horse since we all know by now that Communist
regimes tend to be brutal, xenophobic, and reactionary.  But a
now mature Gere looks good on the screen and Bai Ling may
even give China's premier performer, Gong Li, some heady
competition.  With its Casablanca-like finale, chase scenes,
and political purport, "The Red Corner" is a well-made, if
generally by-the-numbers, sentimental thriller, balancing the
anti-Fascist agenda of a Costa-Gavras with the anti-
Communist program of Jon Avnet.  Rated R.  Running Time:
119 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
