<PRE>AMERICAN OUTLAWS
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Not so long ago, men by the names of Peckinpah, Ford, Leone, and
Eastwood made westerns.  Real westerns.  These were some of the best
films of the twentieth century.</P>
<P>Those days are gone.  Now we have crap like Wild Wild West to pass for
the western.  And that record is not improved with the unbearable tale
of American Outlaws.</P>
<P>Outlaws is yet another re-telling of the Jesse James legend, courtesy of
B-movie king James G. Robinson (producer of such classics as Wrongfully
Accused and Chill Factor).  Delayed since the spring, this version stars
the Irish hunka hunka burning love Colin Farrell (the best part of
Schumacher's Tigerland) as the bad-ass Jesse James.  Alas, any sense of
his character has been left on the ranch, leaving us with only cute
chicks like Ali Larter (minus the whipped cream) to watch.</P>
<P>The spin this time around: Fresh from serving as Southern militiamen in
the Civil War, Jesse James (Farrell), his brother Frank (Gabriel Macht),
and his pal Cole Younger (Scott Caan) lay down their arms and head home
to Missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended.  But
trouble is brewing in their small town of Liberty when evil railroad
baron Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin) and his cronies Rollin Parker (Terry
O'Quinn) and Allan Pinkerton (Timothy Dalton) demand the boys turn over
their lands to the railroads.  The Jameses and the Youngers then join
forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down Missouri,
thus cutting off the railroad's financial surplus and playing Robin Hood
to the local people.</P>
<P>Along the way, the boys squabble over who's the cutest of the gang,
who's the most popular cowboy in the gang, and who ought to go on MTV's
Total Request Live.  They rob numerous banks with identical interiors,
always with the kindest of hearts, strutting in their grungy dusters as
Moby songs play in the background.  The witty banter they share could be
plastered within a Hallmark card.</P>
<P>The biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of Colin Farrell. 
After a great job in Tigerland, Farrell walks through this role easier
then Nicolas Cage in Gone in 60 Seconds.  And his American accent rivals
Richard Gere's Irish accent in The Jackal.  Combined with feeling like
Bonanza: The Teen Years, this homogenized production (toned down to get
the ever-popular PG-13 rating) gives us an invincible Jesse James that
quickly grows tiresome and boring.  The unbearable villains courtesy of
Timothy Dalton and Thaddeus Rains spend the entire film proclaiming that
everyone should be hanged, sucking out any energy left in the film.</P>
<P>Not to mention: The real story of Jesse James and his gang bears no
resemblance to the plot of American Outlaws.  Instead, the movie is full
of old, outrageous tales about the Wild West -- tales which went out of
style in 5-cent magazines about a century ago.</P>
