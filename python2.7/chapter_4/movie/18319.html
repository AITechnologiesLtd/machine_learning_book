<PRE>THE THIN RED LINE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>A study in pretension, The Thin Red Line marks the infamously reclusive
director Terrence Malick's anticlimactic return to the cinema.  On the
surface, the film is a war movie, based on the James Jones novel of the
same name.  But, this film has no real interest in telling a war story
at all. Instead, the film embarks on an artsy philosophical journey to
discover the soul, a journey so long and painful that one might prefer
the war itself.</P>
<P>The closest thing the film has to a central character is one Private
Witt (Jim Caviezel).  At the opening of the film, he and another soldier
have gone AWOL to live in a virtual Eden with some islanders.  However,
Witt is soon captured and sent into the Battle of Guadalcanal.</P>
<P>A few other stories intertwine throughout the film's wanderings. Private
Bell (Ben Chaplin) pines for his wife back home.  Lt. Colonel Tall (Nick
Nolte) is eager for a battle.  Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) doesn't
share his commanding officer's bloodlust, and searches for a better way
to use his men.</P>
<P>But, intermingled with the war (and sometimes overlaid on top of it),
the soldiers (turned poet-philosophers) contemplate eternal questions of
life.  Is mankind apart from nature or a part of it?  Where does evil
come from?  Is war a natural phenomenon?  What is the nature of the
soul?  And other, similarly pretentious, unanswerable questions are
posed with regularity throughout the film.</P>
<P>The Thin Red Line is actually composed of two separate films that try,
but are never able, to merge into a complete whole.  There's the
traditional war story on one hand, delivering the overly familiar scenes
of nervous soldiers heading to battle and plunged into the hellish
thicket of combat.  The other film is a puffed-up philosophical National
Geographic piece.  Lingering shots of wildlife, the local flora and
fauna, and the idyllic lives of the Melanesian islanders intertwine with
portentous philosophical ramblings.  Though the two films are thoroughly
intercut and overlaid, there's never a sense that one relates to the
other.  Would these soldiers be thinking these thoughts?  No...it sounds
much more like the self-important words a screenwriter might dream up
than an epiphany discovered on the field of battle.</P>
<P>As was likely intended, most of the characters in the film blend
together (in an attempt to show the face of the every-soldier). A few
faces are distinctive, but aside from the wildly out of place (and
thankfully brief) cameos by stars such as John Travolta, George Clooney
and Woody Harrelson, only a few are memorable.  And those memorable ones
are poorly used.  Sean Penn's Sergeant Welsh, for example, is played
with intensity, but with no purpose.  Though the characters are
constantly in jeopardy, you don't really care.  In fact, the film is
orchestrated in such a way to distance the audience from even knowing or
caring about them at all.</P>
<P>On the bright side, The Thin Red Line boasts some very gorgeous imagery.
Shots of nature and shots of war are all examine for their inner beauty.
Unfortunately, by the umpteenth time we are shown a shot of the sunlight
filtering down through the trees, you simply wish the film would hurry
up and get over with.</P>
<P>Neither half of The Thin Red Line is overly bad by itself. However, the
convergence of the two creates a nightmare. Too self-important and vague
for war film lovers, and too grounded and mundane for art film devotees,
The Thin Red Line will fail to please nearly everyone.</P>
