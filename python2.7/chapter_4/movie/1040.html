<PRE>                                THE ROCKETEER
                                  [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Enrique Conty
                        Copyright 1991 Enrique Conty</PRE>
<PRE>     There are some *major* spoilers for THE ROCKETEER below.  Read them
at your own risk!!!</PRE>
<P>    The casting was great, especially Timothy Dalton as the utterly
villainous Oil Can Harry ... err, Neville Sinclair.  Howard Hughes
(actor?)  and Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) looked just like they should.
Jenny (Jennifer Connely) *did* look like Betty Page ... from the neck
down.  Wowzers!</P>
<P>    But enough pig-chauvinist sexist remarks.  On to the FX.  The flying
scenes were pure Hollywood magic, and a treat to the senses involved.
I'm still trying to figure out just how did they do the scene where the
rocketpack goes in flames behind, around, and all over Neville (if
you've seen it, you know what I mean).  One thing I didn't like a bit
was Neville's giant hitman.  The makeup job was so atrocious he couldn't
even talk right!</P>
<P>    Some things that I didn't like at all:
- The flag scene.  Why does every recent superhero movie thinks it needs
  a cutesy scene where the main character looks a zillion times
  larger-than-life?
- The scene near the end (you know it if you've seen it) which literally
  screams "SEQUEL!!" back atcha.  Pfeh.</P>
<P>    The plot is *very* different from the graphic novel, but it still
managed to capture the "feel" of the 1930 serials, which was the novel's
strong point to begin with.  There were a couple of corny and downright
campy bits (the animated Nazi propaganda film that ended with "Today
Europe, Tomorrow The World" being a perfect example), but overall it
"clicked".  One scene to add to rec.arts.movies' "perfect movie moments"
discussion is the scene where the balsa "Spruce Goose" model glides away
into the night...</P>
<P>    Overall, I think the movie is worth the six bucks to watch in a
first-run cinema.  Very good stuff.</P>
<P>P.S.  What was the aspect ratio for this film?  Either I've got
astigmatism or it was more than 1:2.</P>
