<PRE>                              EXECUTIVE DECISION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     For those action film fans who think that Steven Seagal is
indestructible, I highly recommend you see EXECUTIVE DECISION, a
cheese-o-rama of an action flick that gives Seagal *seventh* billing and a
quick ride to Action Hero Heaven.</P>
<P>     No, this is *not* a "Steven Seagal Movie."  It's a "Kurt Russell
Movie"--the New Kurt Russell, the tough-yet-vulnerable Kurt Russell, the
Kurt Russell a la Bruce Willis-type with whom we're about to be deluged,
like it or not (answer:  probably not).</P>
<P>     The story of EXECUTIVE DECISION is easy to boil down:  another
rehashing of DIE HARD, on an airplane for the first time since PASSENGER
57.  This outing, Seagal, Russell, John Leguizamo, and Oliver Platt head a
team of scrappy commandos and less-warlike people who board a 747 in
mid-flight to stop a nerve gas bomb from detonating over Washington and
wiping out the Eastern seaboard.  This, apparently, is what terrorists do
for kicks.</P>
<P>     It could've been fun.  It's been done, yes, but a fresh take on the
hostage story can be exciting, and at times, EXECUTIVE DECISION is
edge-of-your-seat material.  The problem, and it shouldn't exist, is that
for the entire first *hour* of this film, it is the most hideously boring,
lifeless, repetitive, derivative, and pointless bit of celluloid you can
imagine.  Clocking in at a whopping 2 hours, 20 minutes, this picture had
*plenty* which could have been cut out but wasn't, resulting in a whole
lot of catching up to do in the last hour.</P>
<P>     Thank God that the catch-up is pretty fun--but still, putting the
audience to sleep at the beginning of the movie is a violation of the
cardinal rule of action filmmaking.</P>
<P>     If you're wondering about the acting, dialogue, etc.--don't.  They're
all typically cheese-infested (Seagal's character is actually, and I am
not making this up, named "Austin Travis").  Instead, if you go to
EXECUTIVE DECISION, sit back and try to enjoy the explosions and high-tech
gadgetry.  But more importantly, try to get there late.</P>
