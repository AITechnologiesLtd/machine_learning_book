<P>     BASQUIAT, the fictionalized biography of graffiti artist-turned-
international sensation, Jean Michael Basquiat, is the latest in a long 
line of "suffering artist" motion pictures, following closely on the 
heels of last year's controversial TOTAL ECLIPSE.  As presented by 
first-time director (and rival painter), Julian Schnabel, BASQUIAT is a 
skewed and often shallow look at the man who became an icon, the forces 
that shaped his life and death, and the way he was treated by his 
contemporaries and hangers-on.</P>
<P>     The film, which is first and foremost a character study of its 
subject, opens in 1979 when Basquiat (Jeffrey Wright) was a graffiti 
artist going by the name of Samo.  After lurching erratically through 
the next nine years, BASQUIAT concludes in 1988, shortly before the 27-
year old artist died of a heroin overdose.  According to Schnabel, the 
movie is intended to celebrate the man's life, not to mourn his death, 
so Basquiat's last days are not shown.  It's one of many miscalculations 
made by the director, because, when the end credits roll, we're left 
without a sense of closure.  </P>
<P>     For the most part, BASQUIAT works as a series of anecdotes, but not 
as a deeper portrait.  Despite the screen time afforded to Jeffrey 
Wright, who gives a superlative performance, we never really connect 
with the painter.  His influences, both artistic and personal, are 
presented in a perfunctory and unsatisfactory manner:  his 
institutionalized mother, his long-suffering girlfriend (Claire 
Forlani), his supportive friend (Benicio Del Toro), etc.  As for the 
pressure and inner pain that drive him to drug use -- we've seen it all 
before, better portrayed and more convincingly dramatized.  In terms of 
feeling for Basquiat, this picture left me cold.</P>
<P>     Schnabel also appears to have a mercenary motive that makes parts 
of his film seem indulgent.  One of Basquiat's fellow artists, Albert 
Milo (Gary Oldman), is a thinly-veiled representation of Schnabel 
himself, and the writer/director populates BASQUIAT with many of his own 
paintings.  Although Schnabel probably intended the movie as a tribute 
to a celebrated colleague, his self-promotion lends a distasteful aura 
to the proceedings.</P>
<P>     One area where BASQUIAT succeeds is in its portrayal of the 
artificial, exploitative forces that encircled Basquiat, sucked him in, 
and eventually spit him out.  Since Schnabel moved in the same circles, 
it's not surprising that he would understand, and be able to effectively 
portray, this aspect of the artist's experience.  Using scenes that are 
pointed and nearly satirical in tone, Schnabel details the double-
dealing and boot-licking that surrounds successful artists -- how honey-
tongued sycophants and hangers-on replace friends and lovers.  Basquiat, 
seduced by his own fame, turns his back on the companions of his 
obscurity to bask in the adulation of Andy Warhol (David Bowie), and 
arts dealers Bruno Bischofberger (Dennis Hopper) and Mary Boone (Parker 
Posey).  In the end, the young painter ends up alone, with only drugs to 
ease the loneliness.</P>
<P>     BASQUIAT boasts a gallery of superlative performances.  A number of 
big names became involved in this project, including Dennis Hopper, Gary 
Oldman, Willem Dafoe, and Christopher Walken, all of whom provide solid 
support for Jeffrey Wright's amazing portrayal.  Wright's Basquiat is 
animated, passionate, and deserving of a better script than he was 
granted (the Tony award-winning actor is on record as having disagreed 
with Schnabel's interpretation of how the role should be played).  Also 
worthy of notice is Claire Forlani, who is heartbreakingly sympathetic 
in the thankless role of the girlfriend abandoned on the way up.  And 
David Bowie is every bit as good as Jared Harris (I SHOT ANDY WARHOL) as 
the effeminate, enigmatic Warhol.</P>
<P>     Every once in a while, BASQUIAT strikes a real nerve with 
statements like "[Dealers] are no longer collecting art; [they're] 
buying people" or "[Basquiat's] audience hasn't even been born yet."  
The film doesn't do a total autopsy of the art business, but it affords 
enough glimpses to enable us to read between the lines.  Unfortunately, 
Schnabel doesn't have the same success plumbing the secrets of 
Basquiat's soul.  For a subject with such depth and passion, it's sad 
that Schnabel's treatment is so uneven.  </P>
