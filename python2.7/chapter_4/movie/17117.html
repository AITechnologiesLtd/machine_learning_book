LEON MORIN, PRIEST (director: Jean-Pierre Melville; cast: Jean-Paul
Belmondo (Leon Morin), Emmanuelle Riva (Barny), Irene Tunc (Christine
Sangredin), Nicole Mirel (Sabine Levy), Marco Behar (Edelman), 1961-Fr.)</P>
<P>How many other directors could handle with great deftness the innuendoes
of this potentially, sexually explosive relationship between an
attractive and problematic widow with a young daughter (Emmanuelle) and
a handsome 26-year-old priest (Belmondo), during the German Occupation
of a small French town ? Melville establishes his exquisite control of
the subject matter by allowing the story to unfold in such a perfect
manner. I suspect, not many directors have that kind of grace and
understanding of life... Melville's sense of how to tell a story has
influenced many directors through his long career starting in the late
40s, and that list would include the great director, Bresson, who
developed the same style and feel for filmmaking as Melville, who at
times outdoes Melville's Melville, giving some the false impression that
Melville imitated Bresson.</P>
<P>Melville's success comes through the intelligent use he makes of his eye
for seeing what is spiritual and what is intelligent, and allowing it to
be emotionally compelling. His characterization of the Occupation and
how some survived it by becoming collaborators with the Germans, or by
becoming part of the black market, or by becoming part of the Resistance
Movement, is accomplished by relating the priest to all that goes on in
town, and how the priest brings out his ideas of what God is and how
tolerance is the message of all sane people, even as the horrors of what
the Nazis stand for is glossed over in the background, its evil is still
felt by those who must live under them; meanwhile, Melville is
connecting the religious needs of the community and the deportation of
the Jews, with the personal savior, Jesus Christ, who he reminds us,
died as a Jew. The implication being, for those who think that because
they are Christians, they don't have to be concerned about what is
happening to the Jews, are sorely mistaken, because they have forgotten
who Christ is and how he died for everyone and how if he was around
today, he would be a Jew taken away to the death camps. The priest sees
his task in life as a fulfillment of his Christian vows by helping those
who need to be helped, no matter what they believe in. He appeals
especially to the women in town, as a sort of modern day Christ, that
results in some very complex emotional questions being raised, relating
to mundane matters and affairs of the heart and spiritual quests.</P>
<P>Belmondo's performance as a priest who questions authority and is not
afraid of what others might think is superb, as he attracts many women
practitioners, especially, leaving himself vulnerable to public opinion
when he openly maintains a very close relationship with the widow. His
argument for a God couldn't be put forth with more verve and
intelligence, even though it didn't convince me, as he was not
challenged with counter arguments by any one in the film who had the
ability to present a cogent differing opinion, nevertheless, this film
moved me to further expand what I think...  It even shows that it is
possible to have a truly spiritual person be a part of the church,
something that I have rarely come across outside the cinema.</P>
