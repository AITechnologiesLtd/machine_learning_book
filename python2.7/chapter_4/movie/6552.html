<PRE>                     BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA
                       A film review by Paul Miller
                        Copyright 1996 Paul Miller</PRE>
<P>Okay, let me first say, this is a BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD movie.  If you do
not like BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, DO NOT go to see this movie!!!!!  However,
if you do like them, I recommened you get out right now and go see it.  </P>
<P>The movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their TV.
They notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it.  This wind
their way through America searching for Dallas (she is a woman).  They
look for her because as they are searching for the TV, they find a drunk
who wants them "to do" his wife.  Well, of course they think he wants
them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her.  And the
fun starts their.</P>
<P>This movie is a mix of funny gags that anly Beavis and Butthead could
pull off.  It is quality entertainment that only fan of Beavis and
Butthead would enjoy.  I enjoyed this movie alot because Mike Judge knew
how to keep pace.  Even when they were crawling through the desert and I
thought the movie started to lag, he manages to keep the laughs coming. </P>
<P>If you expecting changes from the show keep looking.  The same
character, the same voices, the same everything from the show and that's
what makes it good.  You might think with a movie from a TV show, you
can change a few things.  Often times this spells disaster for films
because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the
first place!</P>
