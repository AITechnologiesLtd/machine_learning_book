<PRE>                               SHALLOW GRAVE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Here we have a humorous, taut, gory and fast-moving mystery that
will keep you more than interested as your emotions get rocked about in
this sometimes funny, sometimes violent film.  Made in Scotland (in
1994) we here in the States could occasionally use subtitles but for
the most part we know what is being said and what is happening.</P>
<P>     Juliet (Kerry Fox), David (Christopher Eccleston) and Alex (Ewan
McGregor) live together as friends in a large apartment.  They
advertise for a fourth roommate.  Juliet is a doctor, Alex is a
reporter but I never did find out what David does for a living except
that he is always in a hurry as he leaves with his briefcase.  After
interviewing what seems like dozens of people, none of whom fits the
criteria set up by the three roommates, (picky, picky, picky) they
finally agree on Hugo (Keith Allen) who appears to be just the right
kind of roommate they are looking for.</P>
<P>     That, however, does not last long as the very next morning they
discover Hugo lying nude and dead (Dr. Juliet confirms he O.D.'d) and a
drawer reveals a hypodermic needle.)  While they are about to call the
police, they discover a suitcase which when opened reveals it is filled
with money.  This presents a dilemma. To keep or not to keep, that is
the question.  They decide, after much ... well, a little ... soul
searching they could use the money better than the authorities.  Of
course,  there is the little matter of getting rid of the body.</P>
<P>     All of this takes place in perhaps the first twenty minutes of the
film.  The fun and the mystery, more murders and police, disputes among
the three former friends take up the the remainder of the film.</P>
<P>     Nicely directed by Danny Boyle who manages to bring out the
changes in people when money is involved ... and to do it with no
wasted film.</P>
