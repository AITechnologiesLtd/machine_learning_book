THE IMPOSTERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>Perhaps if THE IMPOSTORS didn't have so much going for it, it wouldn't
have been such a tremendous disappointment.  Written, directed, and
produced by one of its two stars, Stanley Tucci, whose last picture was
the indie smash hit, BIG NIGHT, THE IMPOSTORS almost never catches fire.
Sputtering like a two-day old campfire, the story plays like an ad-lib
sketch that was never polished or completed.</P>
<P>The film's other star, Oliver Platt, was hilarious as the Senator's aide
in BULWORTH.  The bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of
acting talent, including Woody Allen, Steve Buscemi, Hope Davis, Alfred
Molina, Campbell Scott, Lili Taylor and Tony Shalhoub.  All are wasted
save Allen, who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at
the bad acting before his eyes.  (The audience will easily identify with
Allen's sentiments.)</P>
<P>With the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged
subtitles, the movie engenders little genuine laughter.  The stale humor
is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing
sporadically at the picture rather than with it.</P>
<P>The plot for the movie involves two starving actors, Maurice (Oliver
Platt) and Arthur (Stanley Tucci), who accidentally end up on a cruise
ship.  In order to escape an angry Shakespearean actor (Alfred Molina),
who is chasing them, they dress up as ship's stewards.</P>
<P>The over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  When the
leads hide from their pursuers, Arthur covers Maurice's mouth as he
suffers an unending sneeze.  At other times, we have the typical zany
comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else, while darting in and
out of staterooms.</P>
<P>With the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage,
it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce.  The press notes
describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time
all of the actors were having.  Too bad they weren't more concerned with
the audience's potential enjoyment.  The jokes, frequently framed in
silence, fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear
them hitting the ground.</P>
<P>One wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies.  Surely, if they
had, they would have realized what leaden results they were producing.</P>
<P>It is tricky having good actors play bad ones, but, if they couldn't
pull it off, they should have just given up.  "The show is over for this
fella," Steve Buscemi's character says towards the end.  The mystery is
why they didn't all give up in the beginning.  There must have been a
better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast.</P>
<P>THE IMPOSTORS runs 1:42.  It is rated R for a little profanity and would
be fine for kids around 12 and up.</P>
