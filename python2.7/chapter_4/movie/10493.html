<P>Scream 2  ***1/2 (out of four)
Directed by Wes Craven. Written by Kevin Williamson.
Starring Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette.</P>
<P>Only a year after the initial release of "Scream," the horror send-up from
veteran horror director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson that
seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre, the inevitable sequel
"Scream 2" has arrived in our theaters. While the tongue-in-cheek, parodic
element is still noticeable in this film, it's really a sideshow to a broader
commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story. The
first film, while often violent and gruesome, was mostly lacking in genuine
scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion
of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant.</P>
<P>The premise of "Scream 2" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a
movie called "Stab," based on a book written by opportunistic reporter Gail
Weathers (Courtney Cox) about the events in "Scream," is released and two
audience members are killed during the opening screening. I had heard about
this scene before I went to see the film and was surprised to find this
sequence largely lacking in camp comedy. Its conclusion, in which a bleeding,
wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience
that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt, is more surreal and
disturbing than anything else.</P>
<P>The satire in "Scream 2" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves
into an exploration of media perceptions in general. Although resident horror
film geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels
(and, interestingly enough, how they are usually inferior to their
predecessors), the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in
the pop culture encyclopedia as well. Everything from "Friends" and "Saved by
the Bell" to "Showgirls" and "Terminator 2" is referenced here; horror is only
one of many genres available for lampooning, and there aren't any "Wes
Carpenter" jokes this time.</P>
<P>More importantly, this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing
lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have
clearly been warped by what they have seen on TV and film. The killings are
clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "Scream" (in fact, the
culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom
defense), Weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety, and one man
seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview
on the Today Show. Understandably, "Scream 2" does not go so far as to
actually blame the movies, but rather shows that those who do imitate horror
movies are already sick and twisted.</P>
<P>Couple that with the fact that several of the characters, most notably the
lead character Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), are fairly well-developed and
that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense, and what we
have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right. We don't just get
the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of
sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered
(and, in one case, a significant character who was an audience favorite even
bites the dust) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed
murderer lurking around the corner. While I have not seen any of his other
work, it's easy to see why Craven is generally touted as the most
sophisticated "slasher film" director, as he clearly cares about something
more than just the actual acts of slashing.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "Scream 2" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror
tradition of throwing logic out the window. For example, several characters
seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been
a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this
particular trick, but it also happens with other characters and in an even
less believable fashion. There are also a few scenes in which the killer
suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that (s)he clearly
would have been seen moving in that direction.</P>
<P>As for the question of whether or not "Scream 2" is yet another sequel not as
good as its predecessor . . . well, it's hard to say. I gave the first
"Scream" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a
light-hearted send-up. "Scream 2" bounces all over the place stylistically,
but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the
questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first
installment. I'm not sure which is the better movie, but I did leave the
theater convinced of one thing: sequels, however much Randy might argue, do
not necessarily suck.</P>
