<P>At any given moment movie genres come in twos, threes or in wolfpacks.
Currently playing are "Wag the Dog," a shaggy dog story without a dog, and
"As Good as It Gets," a shaggy dog story with a dog. The title "Wag the
Dog" suggests another kiddie movie about a friendly hound, It is not. It's
an adult (sort of) satire of politics, Hollywood, and the media. And
although beautifully acted and intermittently quite funny, I find that its
premise is mean and opportunistic as the inspiration obviously comes from
headlines about President Clinton. It is all the stranger since, chances
are, the filmmakers are Democrats.</P>
<P>The President of the United States has been charged by a young girl  of
molesting her when she was touring the White House with a group of Firefly
Girls, whatever those are. By the horniest stretch of imagination, the
accusation is unbelievable, but as the country is only days away from  an
election, it can do irreparable harm.</P>
<P>The President is away in China (collecting Chinese votes???!!!). His
desperate aide Winifred Ames (Heche) calls Conrad Brean (De Niro) to a top
secret meeting in a White House bunker. Brean, a Mr. Fixit spin doctor opts
for a major diversion. He enlists Hollywood producer Stanley Motss,
pronounced Moss (Hoffman) to fabricate an imaginary war with Albania --a
ludicrous, farcical yet clever choice given America's ignorance of
geography. The conflict comes complete with phony documentary footage made
easy (and funny) by digital techniques. It includes references to a
nonexistent new bomber (an airplane that is). A country singer (Willie
Nelson) is hired to write a patriotic parody of "We Are the World" that
massed choirs perform.</P>
<P>In its last section the plot somehow gets lost. The end of the "crisis"
tries to top the fabulation with a returning war hero who is not what was
expected. This is a strictly from hunger development, though Woody
Harrelson has memorable presence. They baptize him Schumann (read Shoe Man)
and incite the public to pepper the country with symbolic shoes (sic).</P>
<P>The hoodwinking of an entire nation is imaginative but never gives you a
chance to suspend your disbelief. The eagerness of the media, especially
TV, to swallow and disseminate the "news," the gullibility of the nation
and its leaders, the cooperation of the military go from very, very, very
marginally believable to incredible..</P>
<P>The other element is the comically exaggerated. But whereas in a gem like
"Dr. Strangelove" the roles are out and out caricatural, here their
outrageousness is semi-realistic as both Washington and Hollywood converge
in their belief that, in De Niro's words, "war is show business." Dustin
Hoffman, in his physical and temperamental likeness to and parody of the
outrageous producer Robert Evans, merely pushes the envelope, which he does
with great gusto. With frantic pacing and faster and faster talk (a
contemporary variant of Howard Hawks' screwball comedies), under the lead
of he agitated Hoffman and the unflappable De Niro, there is an avalanche
of in-jokes about movie-makers and politicos.</P>
<P>What motivates Hoffman is twofold: his gripe that producers don't get
Oscars, and his compulsion to produce the Himalaya of his career. This is
amusing, up to a point. The yak yak however tries to pack too many esoteric
references that contribute to some troughs of monotony. The dog barks but
does not bite, the film does not open eyes or soar to a higher level. Its
parts can be entertaining but their sum stays on the ground.</P>
