<P>   People serving time in jail live in their own worlds,
organizing themselves into status hierarchies just like the
folks churning out a living outside.  The common mugger,
often a semiliterate young person going from victim to victim
to feed a drug habit would be fairly low on the totem pole
except perhaps among his fellow street criminals.  Those who
rape children are pretty low on the scale as other prisoners
may think of their own sisters, while members of organized
crime are on top--doubtless because fellow inmates fear them
but also have respect for the businesslike ways they carry out
their activities.  The subject of Andrew Dominik's compelling
drama, Mark Read (aka Chopper), is a killer but in a different
way from the hit men who do jobs for the mob.  He is not
organized, he has few and ultimately no real friends, and yet
he has garnered the respect not only of the prison guards but
of TV interviewers, detectives, and readers of best-sellers. 
The film, a character study of one of Australia's most best-
known criminals, examines Read from various perspectives,
with scripter Dominik placing words in his mouth that make us
laugh at the very moment we witness some gruesome, violent
acts.  Based on Read's autobiography--which sold 250,000
copies in his home country--"Chopper" look like a biopic but
in reality is not for two reasons: some of the characters that
inhabit the man's world are composites, and some of the
braggadocio of Read himself is scarcely to be believed.</P>
<P>   Late in the story, we hear Read boasting that he killed
nineteen people, slicing off the toes of some of them simply
to hear them pop; in the film, we observe this killer murdering
only two.  Read is a bundle of ironies and contradictions: he
is human just like the rest of us, feeling guilty for what he
does, and yet he persists in his alarmingly violent behavior.
He is witty, a guy with a great sense of humor, yet when he
carries a grudge he relentlessly seeks out vengeance.  His
basic demeanor is an engaging one so that those who have
no idea what he has done would consider him a worthy
subject for a chat on TV (which indeed he participated in),
and yet he can change his mood from delight to fury as
quickly as a giggly baby who suddenly wets himself or a
wiseass adolescent who is told to leave the room and see the
principal.</P>
<P>   This Sundance 2001 entry which has already won three
major awards from the Australian Film Industry (best actor,
best supporting actor and best director) is divided into two
segments, the first taking place in 1978 while the latter part
follows Read's life eight years later.  We see him in the H
Division, the maximum security section of Melbourne's
Pentridge Prison, watching the interview that he took part in
some time earlier on the small screen of his cellhouse TV. 
Two guards sit with him laughing when he does and generally
seeming to bond with this paradoxically charming murderer
more than with their fellow screws.  Dominik then takes us
back to Chopper's earlier days in the brig, where he had
been sentenced for kidnapping the judge who was presiding
over the trial of his pal Jimmy (Simon Lyndon).  Taunted by a
fellow inmate (who uses shoe polish to cover a bald spot),
Read wreaks terrible vengeance only to be betrayed later by
his best friend--who stabs him multiple times, compelling
Read to plot vengeance later when both are released from
prison.  Dominik follows Read from his earlier days as a slim,
in-shape fellow to a pudgy, tattooed and scarred wreck who
had lost none of his sense of humor.  While the subject
remains obsessed with vengeance, he has time to spend with
his hooker girlfriend Tanya (Kate Beahan), who makes little
attempt to hide her affection for a rich drug dealer Neville
Bartos (Vince Colosimo).  Read becomes so obsessed with
hatred for Neville and Jimmy that we are amazed he can
smile broadly, whether interviewed by a comely and
fascinated  host (Renee Brack) or chatting with his
understanding and forgiving dad, Keith Read (Kenny
Graham).</P>
<P>   Eric Bana, who is ethnically German-Croatian and is well
known as a TV comic in his native Australia, turns in a
remarkable performance, easily combining the severity of his
character's passion with the easy wit and carefree charm that
could--and did--win over a jury which refused to convict him
for murder.  As evidence of his appeal even to those who are
properly horrified by his deeds, simply go to Amazon.com and
note the titles of his books which include "How to Shoot
Friends and Influence People."  My distinguished online
colleague from Australia, Luke Buckmaster, has said of this
picture, "Hollywood has built a foundation that relies on
stuffing films down the viewers' throats...we are told what to
think and how to react....'Chopper' cannot take this
stance...[it]doesn't treat viewers like consumer purchasing
morons."  Absolutely true: as with "Natural Born Killer," we
are not told what to think of the subject of the picture. 
"Chopper" is a thinking person's comment on a brutal man
with a wry sense of humor, its lensers (Geoffrey Hall and
Kevin Haywood), filming the prison scene in what could best
be called puke green while writer-director Dominik confronts
us with a barrage of contradictory emotions, at one point
even having his characters speak in rhymed couplets as
though he were staging a comedy by Moliere. </P>
