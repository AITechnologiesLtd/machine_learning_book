<P>"The Blair Witch Project" opens with a title card that reads "In October 
of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near 
Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their 
footage was found." That's all you really need to know before viewing 
this ingenious, extremely creepy horror movie. Shot with two shaky hand-
held cameras on a shoestring budget, "The Blair Witch Project" works 
because the creators remembered that the most effective of all special 
effects is the human imagination. </P>
<P>With very little money (roughly $25,000) to work from, filmmakers Eduardo 
Sanchez and Daniel Myrick decided to turn lemons into lemonade, 
constructing a storyline that would transform their financial and 
technical limitations into assets. The result is a "mockumentary" about 
the shooting of a documentary. </P>
<P>Heather Donahue, a film student and aspiring director, sets off to 
explore the legend of the Blair Witch, an 18th century woman who 
supposedly haunts the Black Hills Forest of Maryland, periodically 
reaching out from the netherworld to strike at those who trespass on her 
domain. Heather is accompanied by two fellow students: cameraman and 
friend Joshua Leonard and sound operator Michael Williams. While Joshua 
shoots documentary footage on 16mm black and white film, Heather records 
virtually everything on video, for use in a "The Making Of" feature about 
their movie.</P>
<P>After playfully filming each other and interviewing some locals, the trio 
heads off to search for the sight where the legend began, only to get 
lost in the woods. Hours grow into days, supplies grow scarce, tensions 
increase, and then the kids start hearing these strange noises... </P>
<P>Setting the story in 1994 was smart. While firmly in our high-tech age, 
the year predates, just barely, the current climate where having a pocket 
cell phone is de rigueur for those under 30, so the idea of the three 
truly being cut-off from the outside world is plausible. Yet 1994 is 
recent enough to encompass the mentality of shows like "The Real World," 
so Heather's insistence on keeping the cameras running even when the 
situation becomes extremely dire is not that much of a stretch. After all,
 the more dangerous things get, the more important it is to continue 
filming because, as the "Real World" mindset goes, we are all potential 
stars if, and only if, our lives provide enough high drama.</P>
<P>The casting of Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard was 
equally inspired. All three actors (their actual names are used in the 
film, adding to the "is this real?" mystique) have a genuine quality 
crucial in making the production seem believable. Heather is determined, 
over-confident and a bit pushy; required traits for a director-in-the-
making. When she tapes an introduction to the documentary, her delivery 
is self-conscious and a tad stilted, exactly what one would expect from a 
student filmmaker. </P>
<P>Even though he is working with a friend, Joshua remains reticent, clearly 
more comfortable filming the action than being a part of it. As the 
outsider, Michael is the wild card of the group. The extremely likable 
young man does his best to cooperate with the others, despite his 
discomfort at being stuck in the middle of nowhere with two people he 
barely knows.  </P>
<P>I cared about the fates of these individuals and found myself hoping 
against hope that they would somehow avoid the fate predicted by the 
title card. "The Blair Witch Project" deftly creates a sense of dread 
that grows steadily as events progress, with the shaky camerawork, 
obscured views and limited night-lighting effectively amplifying the 
disorientating ambiance.  </P>
<P>To a degree, the actors actually experienced those feelings. They were 
left alone in a Maryland state park for extended periods of time, filming 
themselves and improvising their dialogue based on directoral notes left 
at prearranged drop points. The unnerving sounds they heard were provided 
by the directors, who would periodically sneak around the actors' 
campsites in the middle of the night. </P>
<P>On Internet film newsgroups, where arguing and sniping is the norm, a 
debate rages between devotees of the movie and those who consider the 
production nothing more than an over-hyped gimmick. To be sure, there has 
been a great amount of hype for the film, but so what? Convincing a mass 
audience to try out a low-budget independent flick is a tough chore and 
the folks behind "Blair Witch" have used clever promotion to create a 
whale of an advance buzz. And the finished product delivers the goods. 
"The Blair Witch Project" is much more than a gimmick. Eduardo Sanchez 
and Daniel Myrick have crafted a horror film that is genuinely 
disquieting, because they understand that no matter how much money 
studios throw into lurid nightmare imagery, the scariest monsters are 
those who lurk just out of sight, in the dark recesses of our own minds.</P>
