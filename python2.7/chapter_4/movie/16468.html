<P>SHE'S ALL THAT by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: B-</P>
<P>She's All That has a story that is very common.  It has a new teenager twist
though, which will make the story line available to a larger audience.  I have
been very much anticipating this new film.  The up and coming Freddie Prinze
Jr. stars as Zack, the most popular kid at his high school.  Zack is in trouble
now.  His girlfriend Taylor, played by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, went on MTV's Spring
Break over their school's spring break.  She met a guy from the show "The Real
World", Brock Hudson. (Matthew Lillard) She decides to break up with Zack. 
Zack is extremely angered with Taylor's decision.  Zack talks with his best
friend Dean, played by Paul Walker, (Varsity Blues) about what Taylor did.  The
two make a bet that Zack can turn any girl in the school into the prom queen in
six weeks.  Dean picks Laney Boggs, (Rachael Leigh Cook) the school dork.  The
film's first twenty minutes are quite promising.  Music accompanies the opening
almost the entire time.  She's All That was on its way to being great until
Zack made the bet.</P>
<P>Zack meets up with Laney and gets rejected by her.  His project is even tougher
now that she ignores him.  He follows her around, and tries to get involved in
her life.  The two of them become extremely close friends.  Laney is now
popular.  At school, Laney has even been nominated for prom queen.  Zack has
helped out Laney a lot.  The problem is that he is doing all this for the wrong
reasons.  </P>
<P>Freddie Prinze Jr. has reassured me that he can act after his terrible
performance in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  The character of Zack
was developed pretty well.  The film explained the fact very well that he is
extremely popular.  Everyone looks up to Zack, even kids in middle school. 
Taylor's characters is very annoying at many times in the movie.  She is just
the kind of character that you wish wasn't even in the movie.  The performance
by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe was well done, but the character really annoyed me.  Paul
Walker's character, Dean was also annoying.  Is these two characters were
changed a bit, this could have helped the film out a lot.   </P>
<P>A large cast is pretty much what saved She's All That from being terrible. 
Clea DuVall, Usher Raymond, and Sarah Michelle Gellar make extremely brief
performances.  If these characters were brought into the film more, they could
have helped the total outcome.  The main characters are developed pretty well
in the film, but we could have known a little more about Zack and Taylor's
background.</P>
<P>She's All That, like many teen comedies these days, makes you feel good about
yourself.  The music and characters are upbeat and nineties, and that's what I
liked the best about the film.  The dance sequence at the prom was very nicely
done.  The choreography was very nicely done.</P>
<P>Little suspense was put into the film at all.  It was extremely predictable
what was going to happen.  If a few more twists and turns were added to the
over-used plot, She's All That could have been a lot better.  Many sub plots
went on throughout the movie.  I think the sub plot of the prom queen race
could have been added to for some more fun in the film.  The film is also slow
moving at times.  My mind drifted away three or four times throughout the film.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- It could have been "all that", but not enough effort was put
into it. </P>
