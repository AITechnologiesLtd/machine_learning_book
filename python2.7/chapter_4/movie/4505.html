<PRE>                                FOUR ROOMS
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>

Menke. Cast: see text. A Miramax Film. 96 minutes. Rated R 
(language, sex, violence)</P>
<P>The mainstream is where most movies thrive financially but 
drown artistically, unless the particular mainstream adds 
imagination and quality. Offbeat films can hold promise, point 
to progress and in some cases be most rewarding. But while a 
bad mainstream film is plain bad, a bad offbeat movie can be 
awful. Such is the case with "Four Rooms."</P>
<P>"Four Rooms" is an omnibus of four films averaging 25 minutes 
apiece, each written and directed by a different person. 
Already, that concept is iffy. Few multi-episode pictures are 
successful. I can think of many failures--but to be fair, of 
some exceptions too, like the classic British "Dead of Night," 
the also British "Quartet" from Somerset Maugham stories, or 
the multinational five-parter "Love At Twenty" with its 
striking episode by Andrzej Wajda and the superb "Antoine and 
Colette" by Francois Truffaut. </P>
<P>"Four Rooms" starts out with cutesy, dumb and unfunny 
animation, often an indication of troubles to come. Then we 
have the overture.  On New Year's eve, in a Hollywood hotel 
that had known better days, bellboy Ted (Tim Roth) is taking 
over from a retiring employee. If you are a movie buff you 
might get a pleasurable little shock of recognition by 
identifying the old man as Marc Lawrence, the supporting actor 
who played villains in so many gangster movies and westerns. 
At age 85 he reappears on the screen after more than a 16-year 
absence, then vanishes.</P>
<P>Tim Roth is the connecting link among all episodes. The 
segments' other two points in common are that they take place 
in different rooms of the Monsignor Hotel and that they are 
all bad. Tim Roth, seen generally in menacing roles, has done 
very well in such movies as "The Hit," "A World Apart," 
"Vincent and Theo" (as Vincent Van Gogh), "Reservoir Dogs" " 
Little Odessa" or "Pulp Fiction." In 1965 he just about stole 
the show in "Rob Roy." </P>
<P>Roth's Ted is probably the lowest point of his career. He 
mugs, flutters, minces, sways, twitches his facial muscles, 
gestures idiotically, tries miserable imitations of silent 
comics, and of the Jerry Lewis of "The Bellboy." Roth's nose 
(which ought to get him the nickname "Il Nasone" in Italy) 
seems to get more prominent with each successive episode. His 
accent undergoes changes from Cockney British to Fake 
American. A washout.</P>
<P>Filmlet #1 by Allison Anders ("Gas Food Lodging" and "Mi Vida 
Loca") is about the meeting of a coven of seven witches, 
including Sammi Davis, Valeria Golino  and Madonna. There is a 
fixation on breasts and much pulchritudinous toplessness. The 
latter might be enjoyed in a Politically Correct way since the 
director is a woman. There is also much ado about body fluids 
and especially semen that Ted will have to provide to Ione 
Skye. The less said about all this, the better. </P>
<P>Episode #2 by Alexandre Rockwell ("In the Soup") has Ted, on 
room   service duty, becoming involved with pantless David 
Proval who holds a gun, has gagged his wife (Jennifer Beals) 
and tied her to a chair. The subject is unworthy of 
description and critique. When Beals, who shows no trace of 
acting ability, gets un-gagged, she proceeds with porno-flick 
language.</P>
<P>In Number 3, by Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi," "Desperado"), 
tough, tuxedoed Antonio Banderas, wants to take his Oriental 
wife to a New Year's celebration. He hires Ted to check on 
their kids every half-hour. The 6-year-old boy, also wears a 
tux. He smokes, smells his feet. His 9-year-old sister, in 
evening clothes, smells them too, as well as hers. The odors 
have ramifications. There's also a champagne bottle, a 
stripper on TV, a huge hypodermic syringe, a mysterious 
corpse, and so on. Though a tad less dull than the other 
vignettes, coming from the promising Rodriguez it is 
appalling.</P>
<P>Number 4, by Quentin Tarantino, unites two of the most 
unpretty male faces in Hollywood, Tarantino's and Roth's.  Set 
in the penthouse, it gathers a group of pals: Tarantino, Bruce 
Willis, Paul Calderon and Jennifer Beals. Like the other 
episodes it has echoes of surrealism and of the Theatre of the 
Absurd, both undigested and not understood. </P>
<P>Media freak Tarantino feebly attempts in-jokes on film-making 
plus  other references to film and TV, all without any trace 
of intelligence, finesse and appropriateness. There is more 
talk of Jerry Lewis. The core of the episode is to recreate 
"The Man from Rio"--not to be confused with "That Man From 
Rio," a French, heavy-footed James Bond parody with Jean-Paul 
Belmondo. The model here is the "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" 
item in which Peter Lorre bets his new car with Steve McQueen. 
If McQueen can light his lighter ten times running he gets the 
car. Otherwise, he loses his pinky.  </P>
<P>All this episode shows is that Tarantino may be an an "ersatz 
wunderkind."  All the movie as a whole proves is that the 
Brothers Miramax, while now belonging to Disney -- but with 
their own unit-- are asserting how independent they can be.</P>
<P>Apparently they try proving this by making an 180-degree turn 
away from Disney's sugariness. However, over and above the 
"risque" nature of "Four Rooms" is the choice of language: the 
f-word pervades the movie not just from A to F but also from G 
to Z. This monotonous repetition points to a lamentable lack 
of imagination --linguistic or other--and to a low-life 
conception of humor. </P>
<P>In life and in films, crass terms are often inevitable, 
perhaps even made necessary by the situation. But this movie 
goes over the top. So prevalent is the f-word in the speech of 
all characters (females and males, children and adults) that 
if you were to eliminate it you might be left with just half 
of the total dialogue. </P>
