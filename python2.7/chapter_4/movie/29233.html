<PRE>GREENFINGERS
A film review by Pete Croatto
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>My summer was recently saved by two very different movies.  On opening
night, I saw American Pie 2 and laughed like a moron.  Then a few nights
later, I watched and thoroughly enjoyed Joel Hershman's Greenfingers
even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp, girl-on-girl action,
or Seann William Scott.</P>
<P>However, I felt just as good leaving American Pie 2 as I did after
leaving Greenfingers, which tells the offbeat tale of British murderer
Colin Briggs (Clive Owen of Croupier).  After spending roughly half of
his life behind bars, he is transferred to a more lenient facility,
Edgefield.  The picaresque, rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a
trade, while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges.</P>
<P>At first, Briggs doesn't want to be there.  He's used to living as a
prisoner and wants to be left alone.  However, his ailing roommate,
Fergus (David Kelly of Waking Ned Devine), wears Briggs down through his
benign nature.  The two become friends, with Fergus giving Colin a
packet of violet seeds as a Christmas gift.</P>
<P>Briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil, and
begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball
smashes his beloved flowers.  After the prison's governor (Warren
Clarke) reprimands them, he's awed at what Briggs has accomplished.  And
he's struck by an idea -- Briggs, Fergus and the other men will grow a
garden on the prison's grounds.</P>
<P>Greenfingers, which is "inspired by actual events," becomes a bit like a
sports movie after that.  Despite their differences, the men come
together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game --
in this case a prestigious garden show.  One renegade, in this case,
Briggs, will prove to have talent.  Of course, love will also rear its
head (no, not "prison love").  To Hershman's credit, he doesn't pump up
the drama or try for cheap laughs, like last year's lame marijuana
comedy Saving Grace.  I had to keep pinching myself when I didn't see a
single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies, or the
men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers.</P>
<P>The movie deals with people and scores on that concept.  It's wonderful
seeing Briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again. 
Give credit to Owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for
overacting.  His speech to the parole board about being reborn through
gardening is the best scene of its kind since Morgan Freeman's last
stand in The Shawshank Redemption.  Owen's bedside scenes with Kelly,
who lends the film a human touch, are a marvel to behold, emotionally
gripping without being sappy.</P>
<P>Written by Hershman, Greenfingers contains plenty of laughs.  Most come
courtesy of Helen Mirren, who shines as the world-class gardener who
works with the inmates but fears for her daughter Primrose (Natasha
Little) when she starts dating Briggs.  The mother can't believe what
he'll do if her daughter "burns the Sunday roast."</P>
<P>Nothing is forced in Greenfingers.  The funny lines come forth naturally
in conversations and not from punch lines.  Primrose and Briggs'
relationship takes awkward steps.  Even when Briggs decides to go back
to Edgefield, it's done for reasons of loyalty, not because the movie
requires him to do so.  After grimacing through the forced screwball
antics of movies like America's Sweethearts and The Princess Dairies,
it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time
to tell a story very well.</P>
