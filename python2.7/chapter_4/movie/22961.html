<P>   In Frank Loesser's musical "Most Happy Fella," a quartet of
guys who are standing on the corner watching all the girls go
by begin singing, "Brother, you can't go to jail for what you're
thinking."  Good thing.  Thoughts and fantasies of hate are
far more common than physical displays of these emotions:
feelings of racism and homophobia are probably more typical
than we presume.  Very fortunately, these feelings are
physically acted upon in only a relatively small minority of
cases.  "Pariah" demonstrates some of these.</P>
<P>   Randolph Kret's movie is thrown together helter-skelter,
scenes popping up before our eyes without rhyme or reason, 
but the picture is so visceral, has no much damn frenetic
energy, that it compels our attention.  The performers are
charged up throughout, giving us in the audience barely a
moment to reflect on what's going on, but then again, the
characters in this movie are probably clueless themselves
about their motivations.  They profess that they hate
"niggers," "spics," "fags," "kikes," "pussies" and all the
others in the country who are not exactly like them--and in
fact each often appears to hate his fellow in this pathetic
skinhead cult and, of course, himself as well.  Ultimately,
though, they get into daily fights not so much because they
can't stand members of minority groups but because fighting
is fun.  Like the boxers in David Fincher's "Fight Club" who
profess to dislike rampant consumerism and the feminization
of the male sex in America, the reasons they give for
confrontations are mere rationalizations.  These are empty-
headed, emotionally crippled individuals who would have to
face their nothingness if they could not dominate those who
were physically--but certainly not intellectually--weaker than
they.</P>
<P>   "Pariah" focuses particularly on Steve (Damon Jones), a
formerly peaceable white guy who becomes a hater because
he witnesses the rape and subsequent suicide of his black
girl friend (Elexa Williams).  Attacked by a band of skinheads
who beat the stuffing out of him and force him to watch the
gangbang, Steve becomes Dirty Harry, a one-man army who
takes the law into his own hands by going underground,
becoming a skinhead, and worming his way into the
organization of riff-raff in a raffish section of Hollywood that
seems to be inhabited by nobody from this planet.  He seeks
vengeance particularly against the person who led the attack,
David Lee (David Lee Wilson) and the honcho of the gang, a
large, well-built chap named Crew (David Oren Ward).</P>
<P>   While the movie will inevitably be compared to "Fight Club,"
it shares a genre more with Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic "A
Clockwork Orange"--about a society in the not-too-distant
future in which rape, torture and killing are everyday events
and the law is nonexistent.  While this movie in no way has
Kubrick's style, it conveys the writer-director's view that
though many of us normal people never see these Hitler
youths close up, they are a dangerous force in America who
are difficult to reckon with despite their recognizability.  In fact
in watching the endless beatings engaged in by Crew, David
Lee, their simple-minded female groupies, and the
counterattacks launched by gangs of young blacks and gays,
we wonder why no one responsible for enforcing the law is
around and why these easily identified skins never get picked
up by the police.  </P>
<P>   Raldolph Kret does not motivate these sickos.  Sure, in one
case a young woman complains that his brother was killed by
a black man and in yet another a dysfunctional father
alternately throws the hoods out of his house and supplies
them with hospitality.  But he does not really delve into the
psychology of these common criminals who have memorized
gibberish from Nazi ideology but otherwise have no gray
matter inside their glabrous craniums.  "Pariah" is chock full
of rape (the only way these guys can enjoy sex), killing,
maiming and vulgar, racist language.  The most interesting
twist occurs when the undercover Steve is asked to prove his
loyalty by "offing" a transvestite.  Has Steve's hate become
so intense that he has himself become like one of his mortal
enemies?</P>
<P>Unrated.  Running Time: 105 minutes.  (C) 2000
