<PRE>BEAUTIFUL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>BEAUTIFUL isn't.  A lifeless, mean-spirited film, it arrives DOA at your 
local theater today.  Advertised as a comedy, the picture, thanks to 
Sally's Field's inept direction and Jon Bernstein's dull script, is, 
instead, a depressing drama.</P>
<P>With beauty pageants as its subject, BEAUTIFUL should have been an easy 
success.  Is there anything easier to satirize than beauty pageants?  
Last year's marvelously funny DROP DEAD GORGEOUS showed what is 
possible.  Even if BEAUTIFUL can't rise to that level, does it have to 
be so painful to watch?  Every performance is gratingly awful, and all 
the roles are badly miscast.  </P>
<P>Attractive Minnie Driver, as Mona Hibbard, the story's protagonist, 
doesn't have the body for a beauty pageant winner.  Her head and her 
bones are too large, and her movements are too awkward.  She's a 
terrific actress, but even she can't pull this one off, especially given 
how badly and unsympathetically her part is written.</P>
<P>To give you an idea of just how ugly BEAUTIFUL can be, one of the key 
subplots concerns Mona's disowning her own daughter, Vanessa.  It seems 
that you can't be Miss American Miss if you have children.  When Mona, 
who likes to sleep her way to victory, comes up pregnant, she keeps the 
baby but tries to claim that she is the child of her friend Ruby (Joey 
Lauren Adams).  Vanessa is played cloyingly by Hallie Kate Eisenberg 
(PAULIE).</P>
<P>Incidents in BEAUTIFUL will more likely have you going "yuck" than 
laughing.  When the teenaged Mona is starting off in the beauty world, 
she sleeps with a whistle.  At night, as she cuddles with her plush toy 
in bed, she has her whistle at the ready in order to ward off her 
lecherous father.  At least it works so that we don't witness child 
abuse.</P>
<P>Since the teenaged Mona isn't even finishing in "the top 20" of contests 
that don't seem to have more than a dozen entrants, she hires a beauty 
consultant.  This consultant is played by none other than Kathleen 
Turner (BABY GENIUSES), which again proves the rule that I've had for 
the past decade.  Any movie willing to have Kathleen Turner in it is 
bound to be a stinker.  Yes, she was once a good actress.  The operative 
word in that last sentence is "was."</P>
<P>BEAUTIFUL should have been released as a TV movie.  If so, it would have 
been a decidedly below average TV movie.  Actually, were it not for 
Sally Field and Minnie Driver being associated with the production, it 
would never have been released in any venue.</P>
<P>BEAUTIFUL runs a long 1:52.  It is rated PG-13 for language and thematic 
elements.  Although it would be acceptable for kids 11 and up, I would 
not recommend this to anyone of any age.</P>
