Running Time: 93 minutes</P>
<P>On one of the busiest travel days of the year with a dangerous storm
front moving across the western part of the United States, two Phoenix
air traffic controllers square off against one another at their job
while battling equpiment malfunctions and power outages.</P>
<P>Keifer Sutherland stars as Jack Harris, a former air traffic controller
who is unable to do his job any longer after a flight he was controlling
crashes, killing everyone onboard.  A few years later a former collegue
asks him to help out at the control center, as they are severely
understaffed.  There he clashes with another controller (Robert Sean
Leonard) who thinks that Harris has no business controlling any longer.</P>
<P>Ground Control has a good cast, particularly Henry Winkler as the
engineer trying to keep the control center together.  It has an
extremely low budget, as it looks like the main set is just a darkened
warehouse with a couple of rows of computer monitors in the center of
it.  So if watch the film don't expect a lot and you just might like
what you see.  It's a simple tale of air traffic controllers on a busy
day, almost like a reverse Airport.  Nothing fancy, but entertaining
nonetheless.</P>
<P>Ground Control is available on DVD from Trimark.  It contains the film
in it's standard format, the usual cast and crew info, and includes
the film's trailer.  [PG-13]</P>
