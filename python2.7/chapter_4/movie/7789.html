<PRE>Con Air (R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Don Simpson may be dead, but former producing partner Jerry
Bruckheimer keeps the old Simpson/Bruckheimer spirit alive with Con Air, a
loud, superslick, ultramacho, and all-around entertaining blast of action
and excitement.</P>
<P>A buffed-up Nicolas Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a decorated Army
Ranger who lands in prison after killing a thug in a drunken brawl.  Years
pass, and the paroled Poe is one flight away from a new life with his wife
(Monica Potter) and the young daughter (Landry Allbright) he has yet to
meet.  However, the flight he boards is one reserved for the transport of a
number of the nation's most dangerous felons.  Under the leadership of Cyrus
"The Virus" Grissom (John Malkovich), the convicts hijack the plane, and
it's up to Cameron, with the ground support of U.S. Marshal Larkin (John
Cusack), to save the day.</P>
<P>Con Air marks the first production of the Simpson-less Jerry
Bruckheimer Productions, but most, if not all, of the hallmarks of
Simpson/Bruckheimer productions are here.  Helming the feature is a director
hired to make things look good (commercial director Simon West, best known
for the spot where a boy is sucked into a Pepsi bottle); there are
explosions and gunplay galore; the musical score (by Mark Mancina and Trevor
Rabin) is loud and pounding; and, most of all, nary a trace of estrogen in
evidence.  There is a female guard aboard the flight (played by Rachel
Ticotin), but the character is of little consequence; the same can be said
of Potter's role as Cameron's wife, which is even smaller than Vanessa
Marcil's analogous bit role in the final S/B production, The Rock.</P>
<P>This formula can grow tiresome without some refreshing tweaks, and
that is where the actors, with the help of screenwriter Scott Rosenberg (who
also wrote--of all things--Beautiful Girls), come in.  Cage continues to
carve out a niche in the action market without sacrificing his penchant for
quirky roles.  He is more of a traditional kick-ass action hero here than he
was in The Rock, but his Cameron Poe is still an oddball--trailer park white
trash with a hint of Elvis (complete with matching accent and politeness
streak).  Also not sacrificing any eccentricity is Malkovich, whose Cyrus
the Virus is the type of effete, cerebral, and decadent character he's been
playing for years in less commercial projects (most recently The Portrait of
a Lady).  Steve Buscemi plays one of the most bizarre characters of the
bunch, notorious mass murderer Garland Greene.  As written by Rosenberg and
played by Buscemi, "The Mangler" is a deliciously ironic character, the con
with the most notorious rap sheet and reputation--who is also, as it turns
out, perhaps the most innocuous of the bunch.  One con who is not fleshed
out as well as he could have been is Ving Rhames's Diamond Dog, a black
militant.  Cusack's stressed-out Larkin is the straightest character in the
piece, but he brings his own sense of vitality to the role.  I'm all for
interesting, unique characters, but one I could have done without is Sally
Can't Dance, a flamboyantly gay, cross-dressing con played to the camp hilt
by Renoly.  Though his presence does set up one of the funnier throwaway
gags in the film, the character is a somewhat of a drag, a superfluous
flourish in a film already filled to the brim with eccentrics.</P>
<P>Bruckheimer films get the job done as far as action and pyrotechnics
(for which the audience sees the film in the first place), but they tend to
come up short is in the area of emotion.  Any attempt at anything
approaching serious drama, especially in a film as loud and frenetic as
this, cannot help but seem like an afterthought.  Even worse, these moments
are played so earnestly that they come off as a joke, which is exactly what
happens here with Cameron's tender moments with his wife and child.  A
number of people in the audience could not help but laugh because West lays
on the sap about as thick as he does the explosives in the overpowering
action scenes.</P>
<P>As action icons Stallone and Schwarzenegger creep into middle age,
the time is right for the emergence of some new, fresh blood to headline
action/adventure films.  With The Rock and now with the thrill ride of Con
Air, Nicolas Cage proves that he can not only look and play the part but
also add on a layer of refreshing character dimensions and quirks to the
traditional kick-ass hero.  In doing so, he is truly breathing new life and
then some into the action genre.<HR></P>
