<PRE>The Evil Dead (1982)
***1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<PRE>Cast: Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, Sarah
York
Written and Directed by: Sam Raimi
Running Time: 85 minutes</PRE>
<P>Ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of
friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force
in the woods via the Necronomicon, the Book of The Dead.  Bruce
Campbell stars as Ash, who eventually becomes the sole survivor and
has to battle both the demons from the woods, and his friends who have
become demons (including his own girlfriend).</P>
<P>The results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny
budget, constant location changes, and a filming schedule that was
sporadic over two years.  Followed by two sequels: Evil Dead II (1987)
and Army of Darkness (1993).</P>
<P>The DVD release of this film from Elite Entertainment contains the
film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  The disc contains two
versions of the film's audio: a stereo 2.0 track and a newly
remastered Dolby Digital 5.1.  Included are two separate running
commentary tracks: the first features writer/director Sam Raimi and
producer Rob Tapert and the second track features the film's star,
Bruce Campbell.</P>
<P>Campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty, as he has a
story to tell for virtually every scene in the film.  Such informative
tidbits include: The original title of the film was going to be Book
of the Dead (and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's
title) and when they were asked to change the title to The Evil Dead,
everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard.  Also,
there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and
listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about
the demonic forces in the woods.  For that scene, it was written for
the characters to be smoking marijuana, so being the wacky kids that
they were at the time, they decided to actually smoke marijuana for
the scene.  Almost all of that footage became unusable because many of
the actor's had never smoked before, and as a result they became
"confused" and were unable to perform the scene.</P>
<P>I wish the entertainment factor was as high for the Sam Raimi/Rob
Tapert audio track.  The two people you'd think would be more
enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to
say at all.  Don't get me wrong here, when they do speak it's
entertaining to hear, but there are many instances where both are
silent for long periods of time.  Sometimes after one of those long
silences Rob will ask "Have anything to say Sam?"  To me, that's not a
good sign.  Also, it seems like Sam Raimi doesn't remember much about
the film and it's production...  well, compared to Rob and Bruce
anyway.</P>
<P>Also included on the disc is a photo gallery (which includes pictures
from the film's "gala" premiere) and about twenty minutes of raw
footage from the film.  This raw footage really shows you how much a
film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques.</P>
<P>Overall, The Evil Dead is a good low budget horror film, superior to
many films in it's genre.  And the collector's edition DVD release is
well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan
of the filmmaking process.  All special edition DVDs should be this
thorough and entertaining.</P>
