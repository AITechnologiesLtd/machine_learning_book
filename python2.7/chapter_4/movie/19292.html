<PRE>Arlington Road</PRE>
<PRE>A Mark Pellington movie</PRE>
<P>With Jeff Bridges, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Hope Davis</P>
<P>History professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) meets his new
neighbors Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) in a
very dramatic way: he picks up their bleeding 10 year old son Brady in
the street and takes him to the hospital. Brady makes friends with
Michael's son Grant while Michael and his girl-friend Brooke (Hope
Davis) cultivate neighborly relations with the Langs. But the idyll of
barbecues behind picket fences starts to crack all too soon. Suddenly
Michael notices inexplicable discrepancies about his friendly
neighbors. What are those strange blueprints in his office, that
Oliver seems eager to hide from Michael, how was Brady injured and why
did Oliver change his name?</P>
<P>Michael believes Oliver to be a terrorist, but his theories seem so
far-fetched that his friends don't want to believe him. Maybe he spent
to much time studying terrorism. Maybe he simply hasn't gotten over
the death of his wife, an FBI-agent who was killed in a shootout with
alleged terrorists. Or maybe he is just jealous of Oliver, because
Grant will rather talk to him than his father. </P>
<P>Mark Pellington tackles a hot issue with his story of the friendly
neighborhood terrorist. In the USA and elsewhere people prefer to
believe in threats from outside, and if it has to be „one of us` then
some half-crazed loner who acted on his own. But please, not an
organization working in the dark with frightening efficiency and able
to hit anywhere and any time. A decent family man who builds shopping
malls and takes his daughters to their ballet lessons can't be a
member of such an organization, or can he? And what about his wife,
the pillar of the comunity who looks as if she never does anything
more dangerous than bake cookies in her spare time? Tim Robbins and
Joan Cusack are our worst nightmares. A brilliant casting decision.
Jeff Bridges however is rather disappointing. His main task is yelling
and breathing heavily as he sprints across the set. He can do better.
Hope Davis, the token blonde, isn't worth mentioning. </P>
<P>ARLINGTON ROAD could have been one of the best movies of 1999, but the
makers relied too heavily on the gullibility of the audience. A little
poetic license is granted, and there may be situations where an absurd
coincidence is the only way out, but this movie features too many
miraculous turns. But even if there are some plotholes still to be
closed the ending is spectacular, unexpected and made me leave the
theater with a queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.</P>
