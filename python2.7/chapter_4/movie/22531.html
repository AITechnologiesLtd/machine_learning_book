<P>     I can say without reservation that GALAXY QUEST boasts the best
mainstream "high concept" of 1999. I started chuckling the moment I heard
about a film in which the cast members of a beloved television
science-fiction series -- a decade removed from any career except 
appearing at conventions and ribbon-cuttings -- were mistaken by an alien
race for real fighters for interplanetary justice. I saw it as a wonderful
opportunity both to needle the phenomenon of "Star Trek" fandom and to
embrace its fundamental optimism. If handled properly, it could be a fun
and funny adventure into the way our popular entertainments can help
define our world, and define the performers who create them.</P>
<P>     I was so engaged by the concept of GALAXY QUEST that, even as the
film was unfolding, I kept cutting it slack. I nodded in amusement at the
personalities of the show's "crew": Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), bombastic
prima donna who portrayed Capt. Peter Quincy Taggart; Gwen DeMarco
(Sigourney Weaver), still bitter that her Lt. Tawny Madison was viewed as
a pair of breasts that repeated what the computer said; Alexander Dane
(Alan Rickman), a Shakespearean-trained thespian who dreads every time he
has to don the prosthetic headpiece of the alien Dr. Lazarus. I smiled at
the idea of a troubled alien race, the Thermians, so captivated by the
positive message of the "historical documents" they intercept that they
model their entire society after the world of "Galaxy Quest." And I was
ready to ride along as the has-beens get a chance to be real heroes,
helping the Thermians battle for freedom from the domination of the
would-be dictator Sarris (Robin Sachs).</P>
<P>     GALAXY QUEST turned out to be a pleasant diversion. It's also
something of a missed opportunity (or, more specifically, a series of
missed opportunities). Screenwriters David Howard and Robert Gordon drop
in plenty of goodies for those in the "Star Trek" know, yet they're often
more content to rely on insider gags than to flesh those gags out. The
characters are broadly sketched, with their various crises and need for
respect providing a vague foundation for the story (Tony Shalhoub is far
more vividly goofy as the "chief engineer" too oblivious to realize his
situation is genuinely dangerous). A story with the potential to focus on
how the actors come to terms with their legacy ultimately becomes just
another comic adventure, less about the people than about the premise.</P>
<P>     Oh, but that premise does make for some entertaining viewing. Most of
the best jokes showcase an internal logic that should be the envy of every
science-fiction film: Because the Thermians designed the real ship after
the television ship, it follows all of the show's rules. Wonderful moments
find Nesmith and DeMarco navigating a series of crushing obstacles that
serve no logical purpose ("I'm going to kill whoever wrote that
episode," quips DeMarco), and the ship's former child star helmsman (Daryl
Mitchell) scraping the "Protector" out of space dock. Though the humor
does tend towards the "insider," at least it's insider in a generally
clever way, finding amusement even in the captain's tendency to lose his
shirt during every fight scene.</P>
<P>     GALAXY QUEST is far too lively and good-natured to deserve harsh
criticism; in a season full of prestige-hungry Oscar wannabes, it's nice
to see a film interested primarily in putting a smile on your face. The
smiles, unfortunately, don't turn into full-fledged laughs often enough. 
The situations beg to have the absurdity level turned up just a notch; the
characters beg to be given more personality. "High concept" is most often
used by critics as a derogatory term, but that didn't have to be the case
for GALAXY QUEST. Though it may send you out of the theater chuckling, it
could have taken its concept even higher.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Trek lites:  6.</PRE>
