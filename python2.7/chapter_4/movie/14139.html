<P>Plot: Helen Quilley is fired from her job with a London PR firm and 
returns home. Depending whether or not she bumps into a child on the 
tubeway steps she misses her train home. If she catches the tube she 
gets home in time to catch her boyfriend with another woman and from 
there walks out, finds and becomes involved with another man and 
successfully sets up her own business. But in an alternate scenario she 
misses the train, never discovers her layabout boyfriend's continuing 
deception and continues on in a low-paying waitressing job.</P>
<P>I was preparing to start this review with something like "`Sliding 
Doors' conducts a unique venture into the concept of alternate 
timelines, the wildly divergent sets of circumstances that may result 
from a different choice made at a crucial point ...". At least I would 
have thought it a more unique film had two weeks earlier, I not seen the 
Hong Kong gangster film `Too Many Ways to Be No. 1'. `Too Many Ways' was 
made a year prior to `Sliding Doors' and both films are remarkably 
similar. Both conduct two different divergent stories dependent on the 
central character making a crucial choice in a trivial matter at the 
start of the story. It is hard not to believe that `Too Many Ways' was 
not an influence over `Sliding Doors', especially considering the timing 
and the sudden emergence of the uniqueness of this theme. Of course both 
films choose to tell the story in very different milieus. `Too Many 
Ways' is almost a parody of the hard-boiled Hong Kong gangster film 
while `Sliding Doors' is a romantic comedy made in the shadow of `Four 
Weddings and a Funeral'. Of the two `Sliding Doors' is certainly the 
more conceptually audacious in that it tells its two stories 
concurrently, interweaving and allowing aspects of one story to mirror 
the other, while `Too Many Ways' settles less challengingly for merely 
telling its two stories consecutively.</P>
<P>But of the two `Sliding Doors' is invariably the lesser. It tries a 
little too hard to be another `Four Weddings' - yet another cosmopolitan 
London romantic comedy and cast with an eye toward international 
box-office (with the beautiful swan-necked Gwyneth Paltrow at least 
conducting a creditable British accent here). Howitt writes some 
occasionally quite amusing one-liners but the characters are 
one-dimensional. The depth they are given seems to come only in terms of 
catchphrase descriptions - Jeanne Tripplehorn is just The Bitch; John 
Hannah is Prince Charming - we never even find out what sort of 
businessman he is; and John Lynch is The Cheating Loser Boyfriend. 
Lynch's character is so one-dimensional and he given so little 
motivation in his cheating and indecision that one cannot help but 
wonder what it is that two women see in him.</P>
<P>It's just that one finds it hard to swallow the basic premise. Howitt 
asks us to believe that not only does whether Paltrow misses the train 
or not make the difference between two paths she leads (fair enough) but 
also the entire difference between whether she leads a successful life 
or not. One could maybe have bought it if the two pathways were not so 
categorically black-and-white - if she makes the train she gets Prince 
Charming, makes a success of herself in business, gets a new sharp 
image; whereas if she doesn't she ends up unhappy, stuck in a low-paid 
job as a waitress and never finds out the truth about her useless, 
unfaithful boyfriend. It even makes the difference, for goodness sake, 
whether she gets pregnant to Prince Charming or to the loser boyfriend. 
Underneath it all the film is really a rather bland Yuppie daydream - 
beneath all its romantic ambitions it buys into the fantasy that success 
in life equates with success in business, a good image and true love; 
and Hell in life is being caught in a dead-end relationship and a 
thankless, low-paying job in the service industry. Sadly the film buys 
into the whole Cinderella Complex - that a woman's success and happiness 
in life is dependent on success and happiness being delivered to her. 
What is says is that success, fulfilment and uncovering the truth about 
the world are things that only really occur by chance happenstance as 
opposed to being dependent upon one's own decisions and 
self-determination, and that happiness is a result of external 
consequence rather than an attitude of mind. Personally I don't buy it.</P>
