<P>"The Faculty," the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that 
has teamed up director Robert Rodriguez (1995's "Desperado" and 1996's 
"From Dusk Till Dawn") and screenwriter Kevin Williamson (1996's 
"Scream" and 1997's "Scream 2"), is being called a cross between 
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and "The Breakfast Club," and I don't 
think I could describe it any better than that.</P>
<P>The film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to 
have much in common, and then the science-fiction aspect is added, 
involving the fear that the faculty at Herrington High School are 
actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town. The 
six characters, as in "The Breakfast Club," can be easily labeled as a 
stereotype, but as they are developed, they become far more complex: 
Casey (Elijah Wood), the much picked upon nerd; Stokely (Clea DuVall), a 
goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so 
everyone will avoid her; Zeke (Josh Hartnett), a drug dealer who turns 
out to be a science whiz; Stan (Shawn Hatosy), the star football 
quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on 
academics; Delilah (Jordanna Brewster), the popular cheerleader and 
newspaper journalist; and Marybeth (Laura Harris), the sweet 'n southern 
new girl in town. Although the characters are only slightly connected 
(i.e. Casey is Delilah's photojournalist assistant; Marybeth tries to 
become buddies with Stokely, since they both don't have friends, etc.), 
when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and 
strange occurrences, the only people they can count on for help is each 
other, even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one 
another.</P>
<P>"The Faculty" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from 
Williamson, although it does not equal up to his best film, the original 
"Scream," and Rodriguez, whose "From Dusk Till Dawn" is still one of the 
more original genre films of the 90's. Williamson and Rodriguez are so 
assured at their professions, respectively, that the idea of teaming up 
together is pretty much a no-brainer. The plotline of "The Faculty," 
involving aliens taking over other people's bodies, has been done quite 
a lot before, from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," to "The Puppet 
Masters," to "Invaders from Mars," so one of the obstacles that 
Williamson and Rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea 
seem fresh, and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the 
protagonists be a group of teens, they were mostly successful. Surely, 
the conventions of the story are still the same, and the climax was 
inevitable, but there were a few surprises along the way, including the 
question of who were the aliens, and who weren't. The epilogue was also 
a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a 
note that probably could not have been any better.</P>
<P>The performances in "The Faculty" were a treat throughout, since there 
were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite 
of what they usually do. One exception were the teens, who, aside from 
Elijah Wood, are not very well-known, but they all aquit themselves 
nicely, particularly Wood (the seasoned pro), Clea DuVall, and Jordanna 
Brewster. As members of the faculty, Robert Patrick ("T2: Judgement 
Day") was creepy as the gym coach; Piper Laurie was amusing and 
threatening as the drama teacher; Bebe Neuwirth actually was somehow 
able to look like an alien; and Salma Hayek, as the school nurse with a 
bad case of the cold, was very funny in a small role. The standout, in 
my opinion, of the whole cast was Famke Janssen who turns in an oddly 
touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who, after 
turning into an alien, becomes the sex bombshell. If there was any 
problem I had with the faculty, it was that some of them were given no 
real payoff in the climactic sequence. Since the teenagers realize that 
in order to save everyone they must kill the "Queen" alien, many of the 
faculty members disappear. It might have been more fun if they had to 
face every one of the teachers, although the finale is still pretty 
impressive, and includes some showstopping creature effects, especially 
for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget.</P>
<P>Although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films I have 
seen, "The Faculty" is still an exciting and worthy film that Dimension 
Films was smart to release around the Holiday Season when this type of 
genre offering is usually not released. While the story is as old as the 
hills, it is also, in a way, timeless, because everyone, I think, has 
suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not 
act right, as if they really weren't human. And by putting this idea in 
the setting of a small-town high school, it perfectly contrasts with the 
alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to 
adults and other peers. </P>
<P>+ Note: The ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading, 
as it features R & B artist Usher Raymond as one of the main characters. 
In actuality, he only has a small role as one of Stan's buddies who 
becomes quarterback after Stan resigns from the team. If I were one of 
the heads from Dimension, I would change this advertising at once, since 
it is unnecessary and rather deceiving.</P>
