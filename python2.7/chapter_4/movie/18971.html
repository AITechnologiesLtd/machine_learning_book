<PRE>ENDURANCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  0</PRE>
<PRE>The name says it all.</PRE>
<P>You'll check your watch frequently waiting for something to happen in
Leslie Woodhead's abysmal documentary, ENDURANCE, and you'll still be
checking it when the closing credits roll.  If there were a cinematic
dullness scale, this movie would reside just one notch ahead of the
rating for a blank screen.</P>
<P>The movie attempts to tell the story of Ethiopian long-distance runner
Haile Gebrselassie, whom Runner's World magazine called "the greatest
distance runner of all time." Gebrselassie deserves much better than
this lame attempt at a movie.</P>
<P>The best one can say of the film is that it undoubtedly has good
intentions.  But, regardless of the filmmaker's plans, the result is a
docu-drama that robs the viewers of their time as they stare at a movie
without a single compelling moment.  Almost all of the story concerns
the minutia of Gebrselassie's life on the farm as he grows up.  Even
when, toward the end, we finally get to see him race, the movie saps all
of the life and vitality out of the scenes.  His big victory at the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta is drained of energy by the editing of the film and
the sound.</P>
<P>Most of the movie consists of a badly reenacted story of his life.  The
filmmakers, incorrectly, assume that the film's images as so interesting
that they can get away with having no narration and almost no dialog.
This is a huge mistake.</P>
<P>An even larger error is made in the amount of time allocated to
completely uninteresting activities.  We watch the young Gebrselassie as
he sips an orange soda, flips through pages of an atlas, milks a cow,
plows the fields, reads by the fire and hauls water up from the stream.
The camera dwells on each activity as if we had never seen it before.
We get the point that Gebrselassie grew up in poverty, but do we have to
devote the first 80% of the movie to it?</P>
<P>The filmmakers haven't a clue as to how to tell a coherent story.  The
confusing one they lay before us never draws us in or makes us care.  As
we watch, the people in it are stripped of their humanity by the film's
lackluster and patronizing presentation.</P>
<P>Only the African music breaks up the monotony.  Although it sounds good,
one suspects that they could have played absolutely anything, and it
would have been welcome.</P>
<P>If the American Film Institute ever compiles a list of the worst
documentaries ever made, ENDURANCE would have to be considered a top
contender.</P>
<P>ENDURANCE runs 1:23.  The film is mainly in Ethiopian with English
subtitles.  It is rated G as there is nothing to offend anyone.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, complained that the film was confusing and
contained no plot or point.  He gave it 0 stars and said that he found
nothing interesting in the entire movie.</P>
