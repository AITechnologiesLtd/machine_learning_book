<PRE>                             BEVERLY HILLS COP III
                       A film review by Roger A. Rubio
                        Copyright 1994 Roger A. Rubio</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Eddie Murphy, Judge Reinhold, Hector Elizondo, and
         Bronson Pinchot
Directed by John Landis</PRE>
<P>     Uh-oh.  The roman numerals are back.  I wonder what the next DIE
HARD sequel is going to have: 3 or III?  How about the next ALIEN
movie?  (Yes, I heard, they're making another one; but this was through
word of mouth, so my sources are not reliable).  Will that be ALIEN IV
or ALIEN to the fourth power or ALIENESESES?  Do people see my point
here?</P>
<P>     Money.  Most sequels coming out these days are *purely* for money.
I am sorry to say that, because some of these movies have characters
that I would love to see in different situations.  But BEVERLY HILLS
COP III was barely, if anything, close to a movie with my favorite
characters in different situations.  It had ANOTHER 48 HRS. written all
over it.</P>
<P>     Eddie Murphy is, as of late, trying to make a more mature name for
himself (or so it would seem).  I thought BOOMERANG was a response to a
huge guilt trip about BEVERLY HILLS COP II (I don't know how many times
he referred to women as bitches in that movie, but it was a lot).
ANOTHER 48 HRS. had all the elements of the first movie, but the
storyline was rather bland.  BEVERLY HILLS COP III suffers from the
same ailment.</P>
<P>     Murphy looks like he is trying to regain his 80's popularity and
gain a mature reputation at the same time.  This seems impossible to
me.  Part of the appeal of Murphy in the 80's (IMHO) was his
playfulness and immaturity.  He could make any situation hilarious.
Nowadays he just seems to watch as the world goes by.  The original
BEVERLY HILLS COP and 48 HRS. established his popularity as a vulgar
yet hilarious force of nature.  Now he appears drained.  It's too bad,
too.  Eddie Murphy always made me laugh.</P>
<P>     In BEVERLY HILLS COP III, we see sparks of the old Eddie: the
trademark smile, that characteristic laugh, a couple of good
one-liners.  But that's it.  COP II was loaded with this kind of stuff;
I believe it was what established Eddie as a comic force.  Axel Foley
was a clever cop; he could get in and out of almost anything.  In COP
III, there are no clever dodges, none of Eddie's hilarious assessments,
none of his snide remarks.  In COP II, Axel 'carried' in
multi-explosive sound-seeking projectiles into the Beverly Hills Gun
Club in order to gain access to the building.  I thought that whole
scene was hilarious.  In COP III, in order to get into Wonderworld, he
buys a ticket.  That's not Axel!  Where's the clever dodge?  In COP II,
a bartender tells Axel his coke will cost $7 (if I remember
correctly).  Axel says "I can get blown for seven dollars!"  When told
the price of admission for Wonderworld, he merely repeats the price.
What happend to the old Axel?  What happened to the old Eddie, for that
matter?</P>
<P>     I would consider COP III to be a really good dollar flick, but it
is not worth the full price of admission.  Keep trying Eddie; you're
getting closer, but this one didn't quite do the trick.</P>
