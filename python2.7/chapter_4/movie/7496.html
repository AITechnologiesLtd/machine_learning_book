<PRE>                    ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     With more Go-Go's songs than any other film this year, ROMY AND
MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is a treat if for no other reason than to
hear the 80's soundtrack.  The plot?  Simple:  Romy and Michele have
gone nowhere in the ten years since high school, so they create
themselves into seriously unbelievable "businesswomen" in an attempt to
impress their fellow graduates at the reunion.  Much like GROSSE POINTE
BLANK, though, too much emphasis is placed on nostalgia and not enough
is placed on the script.  Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow prove to be a
powerful duo on-screen, but with jokes that hit about 50 percent of the
time, not even the shiniest of outfits can pull them through the low
points of this film.  Janeane Garofalo disappoints here, also, reprising
the stereotypical, crusty, chain-smoker she has played a hundred times. 
It all boils down to a fair-enough experience... you know... like,
whatever.</P>
