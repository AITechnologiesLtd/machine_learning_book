<PRE>UNSTRUNG HEROES (1995)
 A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Diane Keaton
Writers: Elizabeth S. Barton and Richard LaGravenese (based on the
autobiography of Franz Lidz)
Starring: Nathan Watt, Andie MacDowell, John Turturro, Michael Richards,
Maury Chaykin, Anne De Salvo, Celia Weston</P>
<P>There's a scene late in "Unstrung Heroes" when the father (John Turturo)
and his son (Nathan Watt) sit in a giant darkened room, watching film
reels of their wife/mother (Andie MacDowell), who had recently died of
cancer, and for the first time in the film, bond.  Maybe it was because
I was a tad depressed when I watched this, but I cried hysterically.
Now, I usually don't cry at films, so to me, if a movie strikes an
emotional nerve that isn't triggered solely for superficial reasons,
it's an excellent film.  But this is more than just a tear-jerker.  This
is a film with a true heart, which tells of real people, and their
realistic troubles.</P>
<P>The film tells the auto-biographical (I guess) story of writer Franz
Lidz, born Steven (Nathan Watt), who had a very unusual late childhood.
His father, an eccentric inventor (John Turturro), barely speaks on a
human level to him, but treats him as an adult, raising him to believe
that religion is a "crutch," all while inventing bizarre things he
doesn't need.  Then there's his chain-smoking, loving mother (Andie
MacDowell), who, in the beginning of the film, is diagnosed with cancer.</P>
<P>On the other side of his family, as well as the dimension, are his
bizarre-as-hell uncles (Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin), who make
Steven's father look average compared to their eccentric quirks.  They
live in a run-down apartment building, hiding from the landlord, and
stacking all the newspapers they never read all over their apartment.
Seeing this apartment is one of the great sequences of the nineties.</P>
<P>After a little bit of pain in seeing his mother dying, as well as his
father becoming more and more intolerable, Steven runs away from home,
and finds himself at his uncles' apartment building.  He decides he will
shack up with them until his mother is fine (um...), much to the
immeadiate dismay of his parents, who don't want him being raised by his
paranoid uncles, but at the same time, not wanting him to remain unhappy
and in the emotional hell that he was in at home.</P>
<P>"Unstrung Heroes" is a simple film: just showing us little human quirks,
and painting a wonderfully realistic story in a surreal way.  Director
Diane Keaton's humor is not like that of friend Woody Allen's: her humor
is more like the Coens, and is very off-beat.  While I prefer the
Woodster's humor to hers, she shows that she has a great sense of humor,
that stands alone from that of Woody's.</P>
<P>In a lesser film, the humor and pathos that comes in this film would
feel uncomfortable, like that of, say, "Liar, Liar" (well, I couldn't
think of another example off the top of my head).  But Keaton perfectly
mixes sadness and comedy into this film, giving it a truly human
feeling.  The scenes where Turturro narrates his experiments, only to
see them go ineptly wrong are hysterical, but then the scenes where
Turturro lays his head on his dying wife's belly is one of the most
poignant and beautifully sad images I've ever seen.  Just thinking of
the former makes me laugh; thinking of the latter brings a tear to my
eye...well, maybe not a whole tear, but it makes me kind of sad in that
good way.</P>
<P>The acting is excellent.  Nathan Watt makes a wonderful protagonist:
someone we can associate with in this kind of situation, even if we
never felt nearly as kafkaesque as he did.  Turturro gives one of his
best performances, showing us a man who is complicated, all while
sometimes seeming overly-mean.  But when he sees his wife in the old
reels, we feel his pain.  Andie MacDowell, who is usually criticized for
her acting, gives the best performance she has since "sex, lies, and
videotape," presenting a woman who is strong although she is dying, and
is loving towards her children.  And Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin
are priceless as the overly-eccentric uncles.  Who else could have
played these roles?  I think the production would have had to shut down
if either of these two would have denied the roles.</P>
<P>Diane Keaton's direction is beautiful, the acting is incredible, and the
script by Richard LaGravanese (of "The Fisher King" fame) and Elizabeth
S. Barton is poignant, and full of great dialogue.  While it didn't do
much at the box office, this is a fantastic film, and is definitely
worth a viewing, especially for that scene at the end.  Never
underestimate the power of a film that can actually make someone as
unemotional as me cry.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
