<PRE>                            SOMEONE LIKE YOU
                    A film review by Robert Strohmeyer

<P>Based on the Laura Zigman novel, Animal Husbandry, Someone Like You is a
romantic comedy about a late night TV talent coordinator named Jane
(Ashley Judd), whose luck in love is predictably bad.  So predictable is
her misfortune, in fact, that she has devised a pervasive theory on the
subject, revolving around the notion that men are like cattle.</P>
<P>When she meets her show's new executive, Ray (Kinnear, You've Got Mail),
however, her luck -- she thinks -- begins to change.  But Ray, she
discovers, is just a typical bull, looking to spread his seed in wider
pastures.  And it's not until he dumps her for his ex-girlfriend that
she realizes the true depth of her plight.  Jane, it seems, is an old
cow.  And Ray is looking for a new cow.  This joke more or less carries
the film, and -- though interesting at first -- it gets old after its
twentieth or fiftieth appearance in the script.</P>
<P>Fortunately, though, the film's fresh, funny dialogue packs enough power
to keep things interesting.  And the wry, cynical performance of Hugh
Jackman (X-Men) as the incorrigibly good-timing Eddie drops in just in
time to prevent the entire film from degenerating into a ridiculously
softball piece of fluff.  These combine with quick, quirky editing to
provide enough stimuli to keep most audiences alert for this sub
two-hour picture.</P>
<P>Those needing a little more stimulation than that (men, mostly) should
take heart in the fact that Ashley's underpants scene from the movie's
trailer is served justly on the big screen.  (Though anyone looking for
world-class cheerleading sequences will be saddened to learn that Judd's
jumping splits performance was ruined by her inability to keep both legs
straight in midair.  For the record, this didn't bother me a bit.)</P>
<P>Judd carries her role with a Meg Ryan-esque charm that should prove
valuable in future productions, while Jackman proves he has all the
qualities of a rugged, enviable leading man.  The supporting cast is
funny, and well placed, as well -- particularly Ellen Barkin as the host
of the late night show.</P>
<P>Much to my surprise, Someone Like You made for a funny, enjoyable
picture right up until its final moments, when it completely brained
itself by falling into the usual rut of romantic comedy conclusions. 
With its richness of dialogue and editing, I was certain it might have
overcome its genre to set some new precedent in romantic comedy cheese. 
But no.</P>
<P>In the end, this is still a warm, fuzzy picture with enough wit to
satisfy most audiences in need of a laugh.  Ladies: Go for the humor. 
Gents: Stay for the underpants.</P>
