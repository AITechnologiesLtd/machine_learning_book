<PRE>Arlington Road (R) ****
Starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins
Directed by Mark Pellington
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>I don't care how early we are into the year, there will be nothing like this
movie until the new millennium. Finally, a film has come along that challenges
the traditional action/suspense genre and gives new meanings to the words
paranoia and suspense.</P>
<P>Michael Faraday (Bridges) teaches a domestic terrorism class at the local
college, it's his way of remembering his wife who died by accident in a
confused shootout at a house in the woods. After helping the next door
neighbor's boy to the hospital (in a frightening and brilliantly executed
opening sequence) he realizes that he doesn't even know the people who have
been living across the street for a year.</P>
<P>Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins & Joan Cusack) are the creepy neighbors, the
boys begin to bond but paranoid Michael senses something odd about them. He
begins to hunt around to see who Oliver really is, much to the objections of
girlfriend Hope Davis, and discovers he was charged for trying to blow up a
building when he was 15. He also discovers a hidden blueprint behind a painting
in their house.</P>
<P>Will Oliver strike again? As paranoia mounts, he is driven into insanity with
nowhere to turn.</P>
<P>This film uses blackouts extremely well, and I just can't get over how original
and disturbing the ending was. To know that their actually are people out there
like that is enough to frighten a heck lot more than anything else at the
cinema. Arlington Road belongs in the Top 10 Best Films of the Year and earns
my outstanding **** stars.</P>
