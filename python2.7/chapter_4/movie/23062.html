<P>Good God almighty, what a movie. Let me ask you something, fair reader. Are
you feeling a little down after wading through the late-summer dreck thrown
at us by the movie studios recently? Do you need something to restore your
faith in film making? Never fear, because a film called "American Beauty"
has come along to prove that, yes, studio-funded films can still be
ambitious and intelligent. It's funny, tragic, entertaining, and
thought-provoking all at once, and may be the most impressive film released
by a major studio in the last three years. If nothing else, "American
Beauty" proves that Hollywood can still churn out a well-written and
satisfying movie when it wants to. Oh, and by the way, Kevin Spacey is one
hell of an actor.</P>
<P>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a man stuck in a rut. He works at a
dead-end job, is married to Carolyn (Annette Bening), a wife he no longer
cares for, and has a teenage daughter (Thora Birch) he pays no attention to.
The film opens with Lester, as narrator, telling the audience about how
pathetic his life has become. He would seem to have it all: a family, a
house in the suburbs, and a steady job, but he is unhappy. Wishing his life
weren't so boring, Lester waits for something to pull him out of his
oppressively dull existence. His wait is ended when he is dragged to a
basketball game at the local high school during which his daughter Jane will
perform in a cheerleading routine. During the routine, Lester's focus turns
to his daughter's beautiful friend and fellow cheerleader Angela (Mena
Suvari), who awakens his previously-dormant libido and inspires him to break
out of his dead-end life. He quits his job (but not before blackmailing his
former employers for a sizable severance payment), begins lifting weights
and smoking pot with abandon, and buys a brand-new sports car in which he
cruises around town blasting 70's rock music. Lester's newfound freedom has
serious repercussions on his family, who are taken completely by surprise
when he starts behaving so strangely.</P>
<P>The above plot summary doesn't remotely do justice to the numerous sub-plots
and characters in "American Beauty," and I will touch on several of those
later on, but I begin by centering on the character of Lester Burnham
because the actor playing him has delivered the best performance of his
rather illustrious career. That's not an exaggeration. Folks, if there was
ever any doubt of Kevin Spacey's immense acting talent, this film should put
an end to it straight away. Spacey is a complete delight here, delivering
each line with such conviction and depth that one can find at least two, and
often three meanings behind everything he says. At times, it seems like he
finds meaning that the screenwriter didn't even intend to be there. When his
lines are comical, Spacey makes them hilarious. When they're dramatic, they'
re shattering. When poignant, it's absolutely heartbreaking. I could go on
raving about Spacey, but he has plenty of worthy co-stars, so I'll just say
that he delivers the kind of performance that makes you think the actor has
far more screen time than he actually does.</P>
<P>While Spacey delivers the standout performance in "American Beauty," part of
the film's genius is that his is not necessarily the most important
character. That burden may actually fall on the shoulders of Wes Bentley,
who plays Ricky, the boy next door who spends much of his time videotaping
his neighbors, particularly the melancholy Jane. He initially appears as a
peripheral character, an outside observer, but Jane is soon drawn to his
mysterious nature, while Lester finds in him an unexpected confidant (and
drug provider). As it turns out, Ricky is not videotaping the Burnhams
solely for voyeuristic purposes, but because he sees something strangely
beautiful in them, along with everything else he records. A particularly
revealing passage has Ricky narrating some footage he took of a plastic bag
blowing in the wind, telling Jane, "Sometimes I feel there's so much beauty
in the world, I just can't take it." The quote feels like it should, a
little bit simplistic, but awfully profound for a 17-year-old kid.</P>
<P>Bentley is a revelation in his role, which should garner him more choice
parts in the future. It's not easy to play a character like Ricky without
coming off as silly, but Bentley manages a certain earnestness that can't be
dismissed. Every other actor in "American Beauty" also delivers a fine
performance. Bening starts off as an annoyingly shallow caricature, but
reveals a sad desperation when left alone with her own self-doubt. Suvari
likewise seems a stereotypical teenage vixen, but in a particularly rending
scene near the end of the film, Bentley tears down her facade with a few
well-placed comments. Suvari really shows some acting chops here, and it may
be the most singularly honest scene in the film. Chris Cooper, playing Ricky
's controlling ex-Marine father, is intense and frightening. It's a fine
performance from an unappreciated character actor, and even though his
character isn't fleshed out as much as the others, rest assured that even he
is not what he seems on the surface.</P>
<P>A great strength of "American Beauty's" script is its refusal to draw up
simple characters and keep them as they are. The characters here change and
grow, and even though they aren't the nicest people in the world, I couldn't
help but feel sympathy for each and every one of them at some point during
the movie. I was often reminded of the first time I saw "A Streetcar Named
Desire" and was initially put off by what I saw as the inherent shallowness
of Blanche DuBois. Of course, it is eventually revealed that the shallowness
is there for a reason, as Blanche's annoying personality is only skin deep.
There are similar characters, and similar disrobing moments in "American
Beauty" (and I'm talking about metaphorical disrobing, not the literal kind
that Birch and Suvari each engage in during the film). Just remember,
whatever you think of the characters' personalities early in "American
Beauty," it's a very thin veneer.</P>
<P>What makes this film's accomplishments all the more remarkable is that the
director, Sam Mendes, is directing a feature film for the first time! Having
only worked in live theater previously, Mendes directs "American Beauty" as
though he's been making movies for years. The film doesn't feel like a
photographed play; rather, the director has a good feel for
three-dimensional space, and he delves into symbolism and expressionism with
a steady hand. The screenplay, by Alan Ball, occasionally sinks into the
plotting of a trumped-up sitcom, but the characters are fully realized, and
its most shocking scenes hit like a ton of bricks. Mendes utilizes the
script to its full extent, and succeeds in squeezing every last drop of
effort out of his actors. It's nice to see a movie in which the entire cast
has put their best foot forward, and the end result doesn't look like a
wasted effort.</P>
<P>Ultimately, this film is about people who feel trapped. Sometimes they are
trapped by others, and sometimes they have trapped themselves. An overriding
illustration of this is in Spacey's opening narration, in which he reveals
to the audience that he will be dead by the end of the year. Not only does
this help us focus on the characters by drawing attention away from the film
's plottier elements and set up Lester as a tragic figure, but it has the
added effect of creating him as a man who is "trapped" by fate. No matter
how much Lester tries to recapture his youth, it is too late for him. In
this, the film would seem terminally cynical, but it is ultimately
redeeming. For you see, though he has lost his life, Lester Burnham has
accomplished his goal. At the time of his death, he has long since broken
out of his rut, while forcing others to break out of theirs, with sometimes
disastrous results.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" is the kind of film that when looking for something to
best encapsulate the 90's, one could hold up as a prime candidate, and few
would argue. It takes a microscope to the overriding cynicism of the decade
and tries to discover just what triggered such an attitude. Several films
have tried to get at this idea, with varying results, but none have been
half as entertaining and satisfying as "American Beauty." This is a stunning
film, a rare occasion when direction, writing, acting, and even studio
funding blend to create a masterpiece.</P>
