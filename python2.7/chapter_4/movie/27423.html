<PRE>WISHMASTER (1997)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
January 10th, 2001</PRE>
<P>There is one great shot in the hopelessly overwrought "Wishmaster." It is a 
quick shot but definitely a keeper. The heroine of the film, Alex (Tammy 
Lauren), visits the well-kept house of a curator (Robert Englund). He shows 
her various historic, priceless statues, including one of Pazuzu! Yes, the 
very same one from "The Exorcist," though perhaps smaller. It is a great 
shot, and one of mystery, allure and introspection, all the things the rest 
of "Wishmaster" is not. </P>
<P>The titled character is an evil genie, also known as the Djinn (Andrew 
Divoff, who played the anonymous biker villain in "Another 48 HRS."), who is 
ready to wreck havoc on the world by granting people their innermost wishes 
and desires. The trouble is that he takes their simple wishes and exploits 
them in an evil manner. For example, he grants a wish to a homeless man who 
wishes the rude pharmacy manager would contract cancer and die. The Djinn 
grants the wish, yet the manager grows pale and dies within a few minutes 
after the wish is granted. Surely the homeless man did not mean to do that!  </P>
<P>Alex, the jewel expert, inadvertently unleashes this evil spirit from a fire 
opal and, in a nod to "Nightmare on Elm Street 4," she can feel pain each 
time a victim falls prey to the genie. She has to grant him three wishes and 
in return, he gets to destroy the world or rule it or whatever he plans to do 
with it. </P>
<P>"Wishmaster" could have been an enjoyable, highly moralistic little horror 
film if done with some imagination and taste. Instead it feeds on buckets of 
gore to make its exclamatory points about why you should think about the 
wishes you make before making them. The film quickly grows ponderous and 
silly, particularly with the Wishmaster's tired one-liners (do genies truly 
utter four-letter words? Haven't they been around long enough to make more 
snappy remarks?) Divoff is convincingly menacing as the Djinn but he even he 
grows tiresome. Here's a wish: I wish Wes Craven would direct the films he 
produces.    </P>
<P>P.S. Buck Flower plays the toothless homeless man in "Wishmaster," a similar 
role to his Bread character in the "Back to the Future" movies where he also 
played a homeless man. Alluding once again to the "Exorcist," Flower has a 
similar line to the homeless man in that film: "Hey, can you help an old 
altar boy? I am Catholic." Sacrilege!</P>
