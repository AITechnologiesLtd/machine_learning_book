Susan Granger's review of "TOPSY-TURVY" (USA Films)</PRE>
<P>When the New York Film Critics voted it as Best Film of 1999,
this unconventional, music-laden biopic of Gilbert & Sullivan by Mike
Leigh took on a surprising, new status. By definition, the term
"topsy-turvy" means inverted or confused, both of which apply to the
life and times of Britain's operetta maestros William Schwenk Gilbert
and Arthur Sullivan, who worked together from 1871 to 1896, concocting
delights like H.M.S. Pinafore, The Gondoliers and The Pirates of
Penzance. The story, covering 14 months in the mid-1880s, finds the
ailing, aristocratic composer Sullivan (Allan Corduner) deeply
discontented with his collaboration with the somewhat boorish
librettist Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) after the tepid reception of their
Princess Ida. Depressed and despondent, Sullivan decides to turn his
attention from "light" to "serious" opera, much to Gilbert's dismay,
not to mention the chagrin of the manager (Ron Cook) of the Savoy
Theater. That is - until Gilbert's wife (Lesley Manville) takes him to
a Japanese exhibition in London which sparks a fanciful idea - namely
The Mikado, which became one of Gilbert & Sullivan's greatest
hits. Then the rest of the film concentrates on the meticulous
preparation of this witty, new operetta - focusing on the rehearsals,
primarily on the prickly, temperamental actors (Timothy Spall, Martin
Savage, Kevin McKidd, Shirley Henderson). Leigh's pacing,
unfortunately, is uneven. There's a middle section with tepid musical
numbers from The Sorcerer that gets quite tedious. And the including
of some risque nudity seems gratuitous, earning an R-rating when the
content should have been suitable for teenagers. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, Topsy-Turvy is a deftly performed, frothy,
delightful 8, particularly for Gilbert & Sullivan fans.</P>
