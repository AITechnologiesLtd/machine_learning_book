<P>   Remember when we were kids, had best friends, and
swore to each other that we would keep in touch for the rest
of our lives?  Maybe this sort of promise would work in a
traditional society like India's, but how many of us can
honestly say that we've even seen any of our childhood
friends ten, twenty, thirty years after we've grown up?  Not
many, I'll bet.  Why is this so?  Could be that we're now
working in different cities, or perhaps we're even in close
proximity but we have different lives.  In my case, I became a
high-school teacher while two of my buddies are doctors,
another's a dentist, yet another "best friend" is a CPA.  They
all live somewhere in New York City but I haven't seen or
spoken to them since we were 22.  Is this bad?  Not really. 
As we change our lives--if not our basic character--new
people enter our perimeters.</P>
<P>   But what if one day you were surprised to see your bygone
best friend unannounced at your front door?  You'd invite him
in, of course, but what would you have to say to each other? 
You might get a chuckle or two remembering your
experiences as kids, but aside from that, you're more than
likely to be on different wave lengths.  Now comes a movie
that develops that theme.</P>
<P>   In "Chuck & Buck," the character of Buck is played by the
film's scripter, Mike White, who goes through his role so
convincingly, with such seeming authenticity, that we are sure
there's no small element of his own life in this sad and
sincere tale of friendship gained and lost.  Shot in digital
video to give photographer Chuy Chavez more flexibility,
"Chuck & Buck," directed by Miguel Arteta, is as unaffected
as a faintly similar take on childhood, "Disney's the Kid," is
blatantly counterfeit and commercial.</P>
<P>   Buck's the kind of guy we've seen before, though not in
such a state of Peter-Panism as is on display here.  He's the
fellow who still lives with his mom though approaching thirty,
he's the married woman who calls her folks constantly to
recount every detail of her days and weeks, he's the guy who
double-dates with his sister, or the person who depends on
his parents to set up job interviews and negotiate with his
landlord.  Buck represents a more intense degree of
childishness, one who could use the services of both a
psychotherapist and an image-maker (like "Disney's The
Kid"'s Russ Duritz).  When his mother dies after a five-year
illness, the 27-year-old Buck has no idea what to do.  He has
no job, he has an inadequate education, and in fact he has
spent his days in his room playing with and matchbox cars
and listening to the records that were his favorites sixteen
years ago.  By contrast his best childhood buddy, Chuck
(Chris Weitz), is an upwardly mobile executive in the music
business with a Beamer, a trophy girl friend, and a lavish pad
in Hollywood Hills.  When Buck invites Chuck--whom he still
considers his best friend though he has not spoken with him
in a decade and a half--to his mother's funeral, Buck tries to
re-establish the old bonds as though nothing has changed.
He stalks him at home and office, and even writes a play
called "Hank and Frank" to express his feelings for the pal. 
As Chuck realizes that he must shake off this nuisance, the
executive also perceives that he too has gone off the deep
end.  He has cut himself off from his inner child as much as
Buck clings to his own frozen-in-time existence.  The story
features an impressive performance by the always excellent
Lupe Ontiveros, this time in the role of Beverly, the house
manager at the small theater which takes a chance with
Buck's play.  </P>
<P>   Forced by circumstances to find himself, Buck can look
forward to his first career and to joining the world of adults--
while still not giving up the preciousness of his childlike
character.  This whole enterprise is constructed with such
candor and openness that we wonder why the mass movie
audience still cheers on the endless escapism of the
Hollywood studios.  Could this tendency be a reflection of our
own wish not to grow up and encounter life as it really is?</P>
<P>Rated R.  Running time: 95 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
