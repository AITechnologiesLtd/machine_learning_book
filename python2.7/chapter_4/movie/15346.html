<P>   Not so long ago there was a great deal of concern about
security in the ATM's.  Depositors were getting mugged at an
alarming rate and citizens' groups were frightened. 
Legislation was enacted to answer their concerns.  Security
guards were posted and, to help deter criminals, surveillance
cameras were installed in all booths.  While the public were
not completely mollified, few voices of innocent citizens were
raised in protest.  Some cities began installing similar
surveillance cameras in subways, always scary places, while
other cameras were located on lampposts in city streets.  Not
even the American Civil Liberties Union was particularly
piqued.</P>
<P>   In 1998, just about the only use of electronic gadgetry that
disgusted large segments of the American people was the
operation of telephone tape recorders to chronicle one silly
woman's descriptions of President Clinton's peccadilloes.  Yet
these wires are about the simplest, most basic, most
unsophisticated devices known to spies.  Why are these
details mentioned in a review of "Enemy of the State"? 
Simply because the premise around which the movie is
framed is flawed.  The audience wants the hero to fight a
knave that all can agree is positively evil.  Since the
government officials who make life difficult for a nice
Washington lawyer want only congressional permission to
extend information-gathering technology in a country that is
increasingly threatened by terrorism, the folks staring at the
screen may just wonder what the commotion is about.  Oh,
sure, the higher-ups may engage in extra-legal tactics to get
their way--such as murdering a congressman who opposed
the escalation of spy gear--but aside from that, and from the
fact that they are eager for a promotion, are they really the
incarnate evil we love to hate?</P>
<P>   This blemish aside, "Enemy of the State" is a top-notch,
edge-of-the-seat thriller that puts actor Will Smith in his first
major, starring role, and he comes across terrifically as a 
likable guy because he's such a human hero. He's no macho
soldier of the Kurt Russell variety.  To the contrary.  He's
befuddled a good deal of the time, especially when he is
ordering lingerie in a store brimming with compliant models
you'd expect to see in a Victoria's Secret catalogue.  He's
understandably flustered when he finds himself on candid
camera more than any subject deserves to be, and chased
down unmercifully by government thugs working under the
orders of the spiffily-dressed apparatchik of the National
Security Agency who looks remarkably like former defense
secretary Robert McNamara.  What makes his situation all
the more pitiable is that he's carrying a computer diskette that
they want and that he does not even know he has.</P>
<P>   Since "Enemy of the State" is a collaboration between the
premier action-adventure producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, and
director Tony Scott, we can expect lots of fireworks, and we
get all we want, almost incessantly without a breather to
check our credulity meters.  Director Scott, noted for such
popular films as "Top Gun," manages to shoehorn a
secondary plot which meets up with the main story to provide
a clever, fiery finale to the proceedings.  Throughout, Scott
displays an impressive array of computer gadgetry that can
cough up a man's vital and other statistics in seconds when
government nerds feed it a picture of the hapless prey.</P>
<P>    Establishing that attorney Robert Dean (Will Smith)
dislikes organized crime's infiltration into a labor union, the
action picks up when a powerful congressman (Jason
Robards) who opposes legislation favored by National
Security Agency official Reynolds (Jon Voight), is murdered
while playing in the woods with his dog.  The crime is
accidentally photographed by a bird watcher, whose presence
was picked up by an NSA crew of nerds. His phone is
tapped, and he is chased by the officials who want to recover
his digital photos.  When Dean unwittingly receives the
evidence, he becomes the target of the assassins.  While
Dean must avoid being apprehended for reasons he is not
aware, he is in hot water as well for his relationship with a
former girl friend, Rachel Banks (Lisa Bonet), his wife
(Regina King) throwing him out without believing a word of
his story.  (Despite her membership in ACLU she is
convinced on little evidence that her main man is guilty of
adultery.)  </P>
<P>     Director Scott often puts his cameras into high gear with
some awe-inspiring jump shots--including a really long shot of
a satellite allegedly 154 miles in space without which little
surveillance would be possible.  He establishes Dean's
relationship with an eccentric electronics expert, Brill (Gene
Hackman), who was thrown out of Tehran after the Shah was
expelled and who has since bottled himself up in a totally
secure building with a stack of monitoring equipment.  </P>
<P>   Of the two big, rousing chase scenes, one is reminiscent of
"Ronin," though this time the victim races from the perps on
foot via the dividing line of the freeway.   The big shootout
that climaxes the action results from Dean's artfully contrived
setup, which convinces his new pal, Brill, that he is anything
but the stupid man that Brill thought him to be.</P>
<P>   Perhaps the audience would get better clues to the villainy
of Reynolds' scheme to bug the country if scripter David
Marconi threw in ways that the average Joe could be
adversely affected. As critic Roger Ebert says in his review,
an innocent bystander in the Ken Starr investigation had her
tax returns audited, her neighbors and employers questioned,
and her adoption of a war orphan threatened all because she
testified that Kathleen Willey had asked her to lie about a
meeting with President Clinton.  We must go back to the
Ancient Greeks for inspiration (as did the creators of "A Bug's
Life.")  The most important word in the vocabulary of the
Athenian philosophers was "moderation."  We must always
seek a balance between the desires of government for more
powers to control crime and the needs of the American
people for privacy.  "Enemy of the State" does not really give
us pause to think about lofty issues like that one, nor must be
require it to do so.  It's a popcorn thriller with a wonderful
performance by the warm-and-fuzzy Will Smith who proves
that you don't need big muscles, a large piece, or even
military training to be an uncommon hero.</P>
