                              THE GAME 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
           5 angry :-( :-( :-( :-( :-(  for a very stupid game</PRE>
<P>Cast: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn,
Anna Katerina, Armin Mueller-Stahl Director: David Fincher Producer:
Cean Chaffin, Steve Golin Screenplay: John D. Brancato, Michael Ferris,
Andrew Kevin Walker</P>
<P>I found myself shaking my head continously at the absurdity of "The
Game", so much so that I developed a neck sprain. The director David
Fincher has tried to recreate the confusing "twist" and "turns" which
made his other movie "7" a success. If you like this sort of film that's
fine, but trying to keep the material believable is much harder. There
are numerous examples of how badly wrong, or how dangerous "The Game"
could have become. The prime example is Michael Douglas jumping of the
roof top towards the end, now tell me how did they know where to place
the cushions exactly?? Ooops a spoiler, but I don't recommend you watch
the movie either.</P>
<P>If you're wandering what I'm talking about at this point in time, I'm
not referring to Monopoly, Backgammon or Chess. Although all of these
games are much more fun to play than this particularly elaborate game.
Basically, it is the 42nd birthday of wealthy millionaire Nicholas Van
Orten (Michael Douglas). He is given a virtual gift from his unsuccesful
younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn). The surprise is that the gift
unravels itself in the form of daily experiences, encounters and strange
coincidences, which become weirder and more dangerous the longer you
play.</P>
<P>I didn't like "7" and I don't like this movie. It is disguised as an
elaborate excuse to thrill, when all it provides is a nervous twitch.
Talk about over working a person's paranoia. If my brother decided to
throw me a bash as stupid as this, I wouldn't hesitate to shoot him; and
I would be a hell of a lot angrier than Michael Douglas. Somehow, I
don't think being shot at, being drugged, being chased by dogs, being
drowned, being buried alive, being lost in a foreign country without
cash is very much fun. The only life changing experience "The Game"
provides is a nervous break down, not a hearty thank-you. Next time, a
simple birthday card will suffice instead.</P>
