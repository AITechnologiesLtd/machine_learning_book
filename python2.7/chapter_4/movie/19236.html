Wild Wild West (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>Another July Fourth weekend, another big Will Smith action/sci fi release. 
This time around, Smith stars in the big screen version of the "Wild Wild West"
TV series (1965-1970), a light-hearted, campy western with lots of science
fiction elements.  Although I'm generally opposed to the trend of making every
1960's TV series into a movie, I enjoyed "Wild Wild West."</P>
<P>It's 1869, a few years after the Civil War.  Government agent Jim West (Smith)
is tracking former Confederate general "Bloodbath" McGrath (Ted Levine, best
known as Buffalo Bill in "Silence of the Lambs"), who was responsible for
slaughtering a community of freed slaves which included Jim's parents.  Jim
collides with marshal and inventor Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), who is
following McGrath to find a group of kidnapped scientists.  President Grant
(also Kline) assigns Jim and Artie to work on the case together. </P>
<P>They trail McGrath to Louisiana and find that the mastermind behind the
abduction of the scientists is Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a mad
scientist who lost half of his body creating super-weapons for the Confederacy.
 Loveless plans to conquer the country and carve it up between himself and
various other nations.  With the help of a giant mechanical spider, Loveless
kidnaps the president just before Grant can drive the golden spike joining the
transcontinental railroad.</P>
<P>The appeal of "Wild Wild West" depends almost entirely on the charisma of Will
Smith.  There's a scene in the movie where he charms a mob that is ready to
lynch him, and that scene typifies Smith:  he is irresistibly funny and
likeable.  Since he's playing an action hero, Smith swaggers a lot, talks
tough, and acts cool, but it's his sense of humor and genial nature that make
the movie fun.</P>
<P>Also delightful is Branagh's performance.  Perhaps taking his cue from Jack
Nicholson's Joker, Branagh revels in playing a campy, over-the-top cartoon
villain.  His Southern accent is deliberately exaggerated (he can do a more
realistic one; check out "The Gingerbread Man"), and he grins broadly most of
the time.</P>
<P>The weak link is Kline.  He seems ill-pale, sagging, tired.  The buddy film
elements fall flat because Kline seems unable to hold up his end.  His usual
comic energy (on display as recently as "In & Out") is entirely absent.  He's a
bit funnier as Grant than as Artie.</P>
<P>For some reason, Salma Hayek is in this movie.  Her character, Rita Escobar, is
also on the trail of the scientists, but there are only token nods toward a
romance between Rita and either hero.  Rita wanders in and out of the movie,
and the audience is not motivated to notice either her presence or her absence.</P>
<P>The script, from writers responsible for "Tremors" and "Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?," has both strengths and weaknesses.  The overall plot (kidnapped
scientists, mad scientist plotting conquest, heroes with opposing personalities
thrown together) is tired and predictable.  However, there are small touches
that are clever.  I especially enjoyed how the gadgets Artie invents seem to
work with nineteenth-century technology.  For example, a miniature drill he
carries is powered by an air pump in his boot heel.  There is also a hint of
intelligence in the theme of national unity:  Loveless threatens to tear apart
the country which has only recently be rejoined and chooses to strike just
before the spike can be driven into the railroad that will physically unite
west and east.</P>
<P>Elmer Bernstein's score deserves special mention.  Smith's rap theme, which was
featured in the trailers, is saved for the end credits.  "Wild Wild" begins
with an updated version of the TV theme, and Bernstein (who's scored over 150
movies but is best known for "The Magnificent Seven") gives us rousing, heroic
music that draws on the long tradition of western movies.</P>
<P>Best known for "The Addams Family" and "Men in Black," director Barry
Sonnenfeld has a style that is free-flowing, bizarre, and fun.  Although his
work as a director lacks the depth of his work as a cinematographer under other
directors (most notably the Coen Brothers; Sonnenfeld photographed "Blood
Simple," "Raising Arizona," and "Miller's Crossing"), he can be relied upon to
deliver a movie that is visually interesting and unusual.</P>
