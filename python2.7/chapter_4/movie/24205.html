<P>         We've often heard the Marines are looking for a few good men,
and director William Friedkin seems intent on creating another "A Few
Good Men" in "Rules of Engagement," another drama about the terrible
consequences that can result when military officers make the wrong
choices in the heat of the moment. In "Rules," that officer is Col.
Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson), a 30-year veteran of the Marine
Corps who oversees the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. By the
time it's all over, 83 Yemenis are dead and more than 100 are wounded.</P>
<P> Everyone agrees there was a demonstration outside the building,
that the protesters got a little rowdy and that snipers took a few
potshots at the Marines. But there's controversy over whether or not
Childers was justified in ordering his troops to fire on the crowd. Some
observers insist the Marines were gunning down unarmed civilians;
Childers thinks he saw weapons in the hands of some of the women and
children.</P>
<P> With an international scandal brewing, the stage is set for a
court-martial, and Childers turns to his old friend Col. Hayes Hodges
(Tommy Lee Jones) to defend him. Since National Security Advisor William
Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) has secretly destroyed the videotape that would
back up Childers' charges -- "Why should the United States be held
responsible for the actions of one man?" Sokal argues -- Hodges and
Childers face an uphill battle.</P>
<P> "Rules of Engagement" has some points of interest, not the
least of which are the performances of Jones and Jackson. Jackson pours
so much barely contained intensity into Childers the audience can't
always be sure he was thinking clearly during the incident, and that
keeps the interest percolating. After sleepwalking through so many of
his recent films ("U.S. Marshals" and "Double Jeopardy" immediately come
to mind), Jones again reminds us here what a resourceful, exciting actor
he can be. There's entertaining work from the prosecution as well, with
Guy Pearce ("L.A. Confidential") contributing an attention-grabbing turn
as a showboating lawyer anxious to send Childers to prison.</P>
<P> The acting can only go so far, however, in camouflaging the
movie's dullish screenplay. Writer Stephen Gaghan, who trained in
television, tends to sacrifice depth and characterization in the name of
narrative, meaning we're served copious flashbacks to Childers'
experiences in Vietnam but few meaningful details about his personal
life. As for Sokal and the weak-willed ambassador (Ben Kingsley)
Childers saved, they're pure cardboard, just another pair of easily
vilified bureaucrats.</P>
<P> As expected, "Rules" climaxes with the trial, and although
Friedkin inserts many extreme close-ups of Childers' angry eyes and
Hodges' furrowed brow, the finale still seems awfully cut-and-dried.
Unlike the much better "Courage Under Fire," in which viewers had at
least four different sides of a story to choose from, "Rules" offers
only two, and only one of them is genuinely credible. In a courtroom
that's sometimes the case, but in a movie we need a more substantial
pay-off after two hours of build-up. James Sanford</P>
