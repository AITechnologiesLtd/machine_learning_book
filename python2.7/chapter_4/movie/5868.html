<PRE>                           RUMBLE IN THE BRONX
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1996) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        What do you give a movie with four-star action and zero-
star acting? If you're me, you round it up to three stars because 
you laughed under your breath most of the time at how bad the 
acting and dialogue dubbing was and sat in awe the rest of the 
time at the amazing action, "hellacious" in the words of a friend I 
went to see the movie with. He and I seemed to have very different 
viewing experiences with RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. He didn't 
seem to notice anything wrong with the acting and even asked 
me at one point what was so funny.</P>
<P>        This question coming right after a sequence where a giant 
hovercraft is racing down the streets of New York toward a punk 
band playing in the street. The drummer stands up, points at the 
immense thing and yells out, "Hovercraft!" Maybe I just have a 
weird sense of humor. Then again, I had to talk the guy out of two 
other movies -- HAPPY GILMORE with Adam Sandler and BLACK 
SHEEP with Chris Farley and David Spade  -- before we could settle 
on RUMBLE IN THE BRONX, so I'm probably not at fault.</P>
<P>        RUMBLE IN THE BRONX is just one of many Jackie 
Chan action movies, all imported from Hong Kong and having one 
overwhelming gimmick going for them -- Chan and everyone else 
do their own stunts. And what incredible stunts they are too. Chan 
has some amazingly-choreographed one-take fight scenes, jumps 
off buildings and various other potentially maiming or paralyzing 
activities. He pulls them off with such ease that I was actually 
surprised to see outtakes at the end of missed attempts at some 
of the stunts in the movie, one of which earned Chan a broken 
leg.</P>
<P>        As a movie-reviewer (in a loose, interpretive sense of 
the word), I'm obligated to point out that the plot of RUMBLE IN 
THE BRONX is unoriginal, cliched and sometimes unintelligable, 
but in a movie like this the plot only serves to tie the various action 
scenes together. Chan plays a Hong Kong tourist who visits his 
uncle in the Bronx. The uncle has just sold his grocery store and 
is leaving for a honeymoon, but Chan decides to stick around 
anyway and help out the store's new owner, an incredibly whiny 
Asian women who we're fortunate enough to see on the pot later 
on in the movie.</P>
<P>        The week isn't all daisies and roses for Chan, though, 
especially after walking in on the Asian woman using the 
restroom. There's a motorcycle gang terrorizing the neighborhood, 
a motocross gang actually, doing stunts in the street with BMX 
bikes. (What's next, the Go-kart Gangstas?) Chan spends the first 
half of the movie waging war with the street gang before falling in 
love with one member of the gang, who moonlights as a cage 
dancer in the local nightclub when she's not moonlighting as 
the gang leader's girlfriend.</P>
<P>        The second half of the movie shifts abruptly as Chan finds 
a bag of diamonds belonging to some mafiosos. He then has to trade 
off the diamonds for his girlfriend and a few members of the biker 
gang. Why would he want to save the gang members' lives after 
sparring with them for half of the movie? I think as long as there's 
ass for him to kick, he doesn't really care who's ass it is. If it had 
been Barney, Tammy Faye Baker and Tom Arnold held hostage, 
he'd rescue them too. He just likes to smash pinball machines into 
people's heads, a common psychosocial disorder that comes from 
eating nothing but plain rice for thirty years.</P>
<P>        RUMBLE IN THE BRONX is a mixed bag of entertainment 
from the movie critic's perspective. The acting and plot are 
atrocious, some of the character's voices are obviously dubbed, 
others aren't, but the action sequences are indeed "hellacious," 
even though I've never heard that word before or used it myself. 
If you go for that kind of stuff, you'll enjoy the movie. And if you 
like to watch really bad movies and laugh at them, you'll like it too. 
I mean, where else can you see a guy trounce an entire room full of 
gang members, then turn to them and announce, in a dubbed, 
monotone voice, "You people are the scum of the earth"? I mean 
_besides_ a Bob Dole campaign rally.</P>
