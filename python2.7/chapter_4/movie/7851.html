<PRE>                         SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>If you are looking for some follow up, a sequel to
SPEED, forget it. Other than Sandra Bullock there was no
legitimate reason to include "Speed" in the title; all
other principals and the film's locale are different
 , . . but hey, that's showbiz.</P>
<P>The excitement that was engendered in the original SPEED
is here not present until the last half hour when the
cruise ship heads for shore.   Frantic, yes; exciting,
no.   Annie Porter (Bullock) is very hyper when she is
careening thru Venice, CA., behind the wheel in a
driving test being given by  Dept of Motor Vehicles' Mr.
Kenter (Tim Conway . . . funny but doing his usual
befuddled routine).  In the film's subsequent scenes
aboard ship  Bullock continues her frantic behavior,
probably trying to stir up the excitement that is not
there.</P>
<P>Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) is the capable, daring hero.
He is also Annie's betrothed.  Because it is the late
1990s it is no surprise that he does not tell his
fiancee the truth, in this case about his job. Instead
he says he is in some kind of law enforcement where he
arrests young pickpockets who frequent the Venice Beach
area when in fact he is on a SWAT team. Conveniently
(for the story), while Annie is careening around town
with one near miss after another she spies Alex crashing
his motorcycle in a chase after a criminal.</P>
<P>Annie is upset about Alex's dangerous job but he gets
around her by telling her what they need is a quiet,
relaxing 6-day cruise to the Caribbean.  Annie readily
forgives him.  That the cruise is anything but relaxing
comes as no surprise.    Aboard ship is John Geiger (as
in "counter") (Willem Dafoe) who is a former employee of
the cruise line where he was the computer expert. Geiger
is more than a little annoyed at having been fired.   He
is maniacal.    He grins maliciously, his eyes roll in
their sockets, and he looks like a caricature of a
crazed villain.   How best to get revenge on the cruise
line than by programming the engines and rudders and
anchors and whatever else it takes to have the ship ram
into another ship and sink</P>
<P>Fortunately, Alex is there to take on the evil genie.
All of the above, it seems to me, may sound more
exciting than the movie.    Where the film became of
interest to me was when the special effects come into
play and we see, with camera low to the ground and
pointing up to make the most of the ship's height, what
appears as an irresistible force (the ship) approaching
its doom with nothing to stop it.  Quite effective.</P>
