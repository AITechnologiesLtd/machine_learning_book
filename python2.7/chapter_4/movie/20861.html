<P>Susan Granger's review of "ELMO IN GROUCHLAND" (Columbia Pictures)</P>
<P>          Anyone who's ever had toddlers knows there are certain
taboos - like separating a kid from his security blanket. In this
latest of the "Sesame Street" movie spin-offs, stemming from the
genius of the late Jim Henson, lovable Elmo, the shy, little,
red-tufted yarn puppet with an orange nose and eggshell eyes, loses
his beloved blue blanket, named Blanket. The story starts as Elmo gets
very, very upset when his best friend Zoe wants to hold Blanket. In
fact, a tug-of-war breaks out and neither of them sees Telly coming at
them on his new roller blades. An accident occurs and Blanket winds up
in Oscar's mysterious trash can - which, in turn, leads him
Grouchland, a stinky, yucky place where everyone's irritable and
smiling is forbidden. And there's a cranky villain in
Grouchland.. That's greedy Huxley, played by Mandy Patinkin. He's a
selfish bully who stamps everything "Mine" and sucks up Blanket with
his Hoxocopter and won't give it back. Moppets will not only love
watching but they're invited to yell, sing and clap along, and that's
about as interactive as cinema can be these days. And the best part -
insofar as parents are concerned - is that whenever the going gets
tough - like Blanket might rip - Bert and Ernie interrupt the story to
reassure viewers that they shouldn't worry and things will turn out
all right. With the Muppeteers, there's light-hearted humor and
good-natured fun which makes for lots of laughs - and Vanessa Williams
makes a great Queen of Trash. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10,
"Elmo in Grouchland" is a warm, fuzzy 8, teaching pre-schoolers a
gentle lesson about sharing.</P>
