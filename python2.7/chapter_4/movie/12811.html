<PRE><HR>>From 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars<HR></PRE>
<P>For those of you who thought that the Titanic had appeared a little too
many times on film, get this: there have been over twenty motion
pictures featuring Godzilla in some way or another. These include the
big lizard appearing with "the giant moth," King Kong, "Space Godzilla,"
the "Bionic Monster," and (would you believe) Bambi.</P>
<P>The 90's equivalent from this massive Japanese market, which put the
country on the map for international films, is a remake of the 1954 hit
Gojira (or as we know it, Godzilla: King of the Monsters).  Not
unpredictably, it's what we've come to expect from mainstream remakes:
state of the art special effects, and cinematography that leaves the
original for dead.  But whereas the original film was a revelation for
its time - pushing the realms of classic cinema to produce something
that no one had seen before - the new version looks strangely recycled,
bringing more than just elements of Jurassic Park and The Lost World
back to the big screen.</P>
<P>For reasons none too clear to me, a giant lizard somehow emerges from
French Polynesia to destroy a large Japanese fishing vessel.  It goes on
to create havoc on other fishermen until it finds its way to land - the
city that never sleeps.  Whilst this is occurring we are hastily
introduced to Dr. Niko "the worm guy" Tatopoulos (Mathew Broderick), and
a team of
lets-not-kill-it-too-soon-because-that-wouldn't-make-a-good-movie
experts.</P>
<P>They have a little trouble - well, maybe more than a little - destroying
the beast that is turning New York into rubble.  From setting traps to
searching the subways, Godzilla is not an easy fella (or sheila, in all
fairness) to bring down.  One soldier wisely points out that they "need
bigger guns."</P>
<P>Having an estimated budget of US one hundred and sixty million dollars,
the film is a spectacle to watch. Cinematographer Ueli Steiger captures
the urban streets of New York quite well, and it rains for most its
duration because, darn it, it just looks more exciting that way.  But
that's it for Godzilla - just looks - there is no depth, no point and no
emotion attached to this cold serving of banged up lizard.</P>
<P>Saving Godzilla from total failure are the moments with Jean Reno (whom
you may remember as "Krieger" from Mission: Impossible) playing a French
secret service agent; with motives that are not clearly defined yet
intriguing none the less.  He orchestrates some well-timed send-ups of
the "American way of life" with hilarious results; he's a strong actor
who gives an equally strong performance.  In fact, it's interesting to
note that most of the laughs come from Reno, surprisingly leaving Harry
Shearer (famous for his many voices in "The Simpsons") looking bland and
predictable as a conniving journalist.
I found this disappointing, because Shearer is such a naturally funny
man who, when given the chance, might just be able to work as well as
some of his more famous characters, like Monty Burns and Ned Flanders
(both hilarious and legendary in their own deranged way).</P>
<P>Roland Emmerich's (the film's director) other recent blockbuster
(remember a little film named Independence Day?) and now this indicates
a belief that the public want large budgeted, special effects bonanza
motion pictures.  Whilst he may be right to some extent (as these two
films have scored massively in the box office), can't Emmerich ever
consider that perhaps people also want intelligently written, appealing
scripts?  Probably not, since many Godzilla posters have the words "Size
Does Matter" printed in big bold letters.  But forget that - its plot
that really Does Matter.</P>
<P>If you simply must see Godzilla to get a whiff of possibly one of this
year's biggest films, watch out for the thrilling helicopter chase
scenes and the final confrontation on top of the Brooklyn Bridge.  But
if you take my advice - and I highly suggest you do - wait till Godzilla
is released on video, so you can fast forward through all of the failed
sub plots and the unnecessarily large chunk of the film devoted to a
ridiculous scenario in Madison Square Garden.  Even this holidays' other
Sci Fi disappointment, Deep Impact, will prove to be vaguely more
satisfying.</P>
