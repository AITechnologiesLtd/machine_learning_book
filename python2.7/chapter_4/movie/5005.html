<P>     I really really really wanted to walk out of this terrible movie,
but I didn't.  Instead, I stayed and endured, in spite of the sheer
awfulness that erupts when a hit man (Chazz Palminteri) breaks into a
housewife's (Cher) expensive home, only to begin sprouting monologues
about fidelity and faithfulness.  Paul Mazursky directs from Chazz's
play, which also stars a pudgy Ryan O'Neal as the husband who hires the
"contract artist." The plans go afoul when the neurotic hit man-- he
calls his shrink while "on duty"-- begins to fall for the wife.  (He's
obviously moved by her unnatural beauty and a voice that sounds like a
perpetual head cold.) The laughs in this movie number, oh, about ten.
The dialogue is probably racy enough to keep you awake, if that be your
type of torture.  Or, just pass the time by imagining David Letterman as
the host of next year's Oscar ceremony:  Chazz, Cher; Cher, Chazz.</P>
<PRE>     Grade: F</PRE>
<P>[ Video note:  For a *real* intimately hilarious hostage comedy, go       
  rent THE REF (1993).  Kevin Spacey, Judy Davis, and Denis Leary.    
  You'll laugh. ]</P>
