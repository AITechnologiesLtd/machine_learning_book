<PRE>CABARET BALKAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>"You've heard about this city," Topi (Voja Brajovic) says about the
war-ravaged Belgrade.  "It's much worse.  The Balkans are a powder keg."</P>
<P>Goran Paskaljevic's ironically named CABARET BALKAN (BURE BARUTA) was
originally titled THE POWDER KEG.  The movie was filmed entirely at
night because, according to the press notes, the director feels that
"night has fallen on my country."</P>
<P>The relentlessly depressing story is well acted but hard to watch.  The
only sympathetic character is a puppy that appears briefly.  The large
cast of unhappy characters are uniformly angry at each other and the
world as they are forced to live a marginalized existence in a city with
few legal jobs left.</P>
<P>The script by Dejan Dukovski, based on his play, is composed of a series
of partially related vignettes of desperation.  In one of these, two
long-time friends have what starts as a harmless argument.  Although
they share a nervous laughter, the tragic result is anything but funny.</P>
<P>Another incident has a rebelliously angry youth hijacking a bus.  After
terrorizing the passengers with a knife, he leaves them with little life
lessons to ponder.</P>
<P>Some of the episodes are less hostile, as the one in which a professor
has to drive a bus for a living.  His problem one night is that he can't
get his needed caffeine fix before his shift starts because the gas is
off again in his cramped apartment.</P>
<P>"For you it's funny," the transvestite performer in the nightclub
Cabaret Balkan tells the audience.  "For me it's horrible, kids."
Certainly living in a city in which the inhabitants pulverize each other
with little compassion would be hard.  To remind us of how bleak and
inhospitable their environment is, the script has the city's residents
averaging one F-word per sentence.</P>
<P>Looking for a depressing film in an obscure foreign language, filled
with anger and random acts of senseless violence?  CABARET BALKAN is it.
Although this is just the high-minded sort of film that critics tend to
love, most moviegoers will avoid this movie like the plague.  And if
they do go, they will probably find it long and tedious.  As tragic as
the situation is in the former Yugoslavia, CABARET BALKAN provides few
fresh insights and little compelling reason to see the movie.</P>
<P>CABARET BALKAN runs 1:40.  The movie is in Serbo-Croatian with English
subtitles.  It is rated R for strong violence including an act of sexual
assault, strong language and some drug use.  It would be acceptable for
teenagers only if they are older and mature.</P>
