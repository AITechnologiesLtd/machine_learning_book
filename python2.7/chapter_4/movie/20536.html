Review Copyright Rose Cooper, 1999</P>
<P>There's something about Kevin Costner and uniforms--especially of the
baseball variety. He wowed us (at least this part of "us") in "Bull
Durham", and came back for more in "Field Of Dreams"; and now, he gives us
"For Love Of The Game". The question remains: did he knock this one outta
da park, or was it a swingandamiss?</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: some spoilers contained below)
Ever since he was a wee lad, Billy Chapel lived for the game of baseball;
after spending his whole professional career as a Pitcher for the Detroit
Tigers [native-Detroiter-Bammer will rant about this later,] in the last
game of what a teammate describes as "the end of a shitty season", he
reaches down deep and lives in "the zone", potentially pitching a perfect
game. He finds himself at a crossroads when the love of his life threatens
to leave him. The question is, who is that love: his girlfriend Jane
Aubrey, or Baseball itself?</P>
<P>The Upshot
I have no Deep Abiding Love for baseball. Truth to tell, it bores me
silly, as do most sports. And let me go 'head and get my promised rant out
of the way: for a movie that proclaims the Glory of being a Tiger,
whythell was Detroit so totally shunned in this flick? Bad enough that
e-v-e-r-y friggin game they played was an Away game; they couldn't do
Detroit the honour of mentioning its name more than once or twice, even
just in passing? It was very noticeable to the crowd that watched with me
(I was surprised there were so many there for this sneak preview), and my
husband ranted about it when I got home, even though he didn't watch with
me. This aspect of the movie dulled the authenticity of it all for me; had
Chapel been made a Yankee instead of a Tiger, I could've dug it, but there
was no real Tiger Pride as far as I could see.</P>
<P>Now that that's out of the way, I'll surprise you a wee bit: I liked this
flick. And strangely, I don't quite know why. To be sure, it seemed to do
everything it could to insure that I wouldn't like it, from the
Detroit-less Tigers, to being a baseball movie to begin with--and
especially because of Kelly Preston.</P>
<P>Kelly Preston. Man, that chick was hard to deal with. At once seeming way
too young for Chapel, and very outclassed in the acting department by even
Costner (who doesn't deserve all the flack he gets. Some, but not all); in
the end, she grew on me, maybe becase Chapel turned out to be such a prick
[y'all shoulda seen the typo I made on the first draft of this review!
But, as is my way, I digress.] My major Issue with her was that she
looked, and acted, more like a Valley Girl than a Noo Yawka. She seemed
too flighty at first, and her character began as unsympathetic for me (we
see Jane stand-up Billy just before his Big Game, as she tells him she's
going to London because "you don't really need me"; "Get over yourself!",
I mumbled quietly to the screen), but as the movie progresses, she seems
to "grow up" in fits and starts, though some of the crap she takes from
Billy throughout had me wanting to shake her and wake her dumbbutt up. In
the end, though there could've been better choices of actresses for her
role, she acquits herself adequately enough.</P>
<P>And Costner, The Man Hissef; what of him? I'll put it like this: he wears
his uniforms well. And that's no backhanded compliment; though he looked
too old for the part, I could Believe him as a ballplayer. The shots of
him (and his double) on the diamond were beautifully done by the
cinematographer (it's hard to describe, unfortunately; you'll have to see
it for yourself to know what I mean), especially the "clear the mechanism"
scenes. And even when the pseudo-Philospher that's apparently inherant in
all baseball players, came to the fore, I didn't run Yelling And Screaming
from the theater. Costner's Billy Chapel seemed Real to me, and though
overall, "Bull Durham" was a much better flick for him (Costner's "How do
you like to be kissed?" line couldn't touch his Bull Durham characters' "I
believe in..." speech to Susan Sarandon, on a good day), Kevin should be
able to loose the ghosts of "The Postman" past with this one; until his
next Big Flop, at least.</P>
<P>As for the story itself, I am again surprised that I wound up being
interested in it. There was very little actual conflict, and what there
was, seemed contrived. The baseball game itself was just a set-up for the
flashbacks which told the story--or was it? Hmmm...even if it were,
though, the "conflict" in the game itself was light; and yet, still
effective. I loved the character of Gus ("the ugliest Wife in the league";
played by Reilly), and I found myself rooting for Billy's every pitch,
straining to hear his "conversations" with the stadium crowd, his "worthy
opponents" on the other team, and most of all, with himself--despite my
lack of enthusiasm for baseball. And at the end of the game (I won't give
it away, but needless to say, there were no real plot twists), I cheered
right along with the rest of the crowd--on screen, and off. The
simultaneous love story was rather bizarre, too; there was nothing there
at all to grab onto from either the characters' standpoint or for Joe
Viewer, until the appearance of one of Jane's family members (Heather, who
I found quite charming, in spite of my reservations about that kind of
character being added to Save The Day; perhaps because Heather was played
nicely by Malone). And oddly enough, that whole plot took on a different
Feel from there; it became softer, sweeter; it became interesting. It
threatened to lose my interest when Preston's lack of acting skills got in
the way again, but the whole timbre of the movie changed with that one
scene. I blushed at their "will you still love me when..." telephone
conversation--having remembered one very much like it after I fell in love
with my now-husband. Recognition of Self, when watching a movie, generally
being A Good Thing...</P>
<P>"For Love Of The Game" was no "The Natural", but at least it was no
"WaterWorld" either. If you need a Feel-Good movie right about now [I did:
just before I went to see it, my wallet was stolen], you could do much
worse. And coming from me, that's about as good a compliment that a film
not on the same level as, for instance, "The Matrix", can get.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor" [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]
As a Black woman, I see the "Black Factor"--things that affect me as a
"consumer of color"--in many aspects of life; movies included. Whether
from the standpoint of noting Black (and other "minority") cast and crew
members (if any), to the (lack of) focus toward "people of color" (dag, I
hate that term), to the out-and-out antagonistic attitude toward Us
(Jar-Jar, anyone?), the "Black Factor" (BF) is something that plays as
much a role in my film enjoyment as any other aspect of the movie itself.</P>
<P>As has been noted Elsewhere about the lack of Blacks in new TV series this
Fall season (there's an article in the 7/30/99 issue of "Entertainment
Weekly" that I highly recommend, titled "White Wash"), it's much easier
depicting an integrated workplace than it is to show folks of different
races hangin' out after hours--but what if that workplace was the sports
arena, as it is in this flick? I'd postulate that in those cases, there'd
be the usual hand-wringing by The Powers That Be over How To Handle The
Race Issue: "Well," I hear The Powers thinking; "should we show the team
lineup as a reflection of what we actually see in real-life sports, or
should we add a White [or Black, as the case may be] guy in the mix?
Should we trip all over ourselves to include a Black [White] Friend? Oh
how do we get The Black Dollar in to see this one?!?"</P>
<P>Fortunately, that postulation in this case, would be wrong. That mindset,
and the slippery slope it begets, didn't seem to be at the forefront in
this movie, for the most part. The Black players clearly had a
Relationship with Billy, but so did the rest of the team (those that were
featured, as well as the team in toto). Billy respected Davis Birche
(Rogers) a former teammate of his that happened to be Black (whose wife
Keisha--played by Sheila Lussier--also had an effect on Jane), and though
the little time they spent on their personal relationship felt a little
clumsy, it wasn't focused on long enough to make the problematic part of
modern entertainment--showing White and Black folks together in
non-workplace settings--become an Issue. And I still have the feeling that
if it were (this being a movie drama, not a TV sitcom), it would've been
done well. At any point, there was no big deal made of the fact that
either Davis, or Mickey Hart (Barnes), a current teammate who he gave some
sound advice to, in the role of OldSchooler, were Black. And that, in this
instance, was A Good Thing.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line 
My problems with the flick notwithstanding (Kelly Preston at times; the
DAMNED ANNOYING Fox TV announcers--I think all sports announcers should be
fined for stoopidity when they keep yammering on; likewise, the DAMNED
ANNOYING "instant replays"--not only did they not look real, they were
simply unneeded, having added nothing to the story), there was something
about this film that Reached me. I didn't mind being less $6 for the sneak
preview that I saw. That may not sound like much of a movie
recommendation, so look at it this way: I wouldn't mind seeing it again,
even if only as a second-run flick; "Chill Factor", and its ilk, I
wouldn't see again if you paid me. Can ya diggit?</P>
<P>"For Love Of The Game": Though I have no love for the game of baseball,
this flick stands out for me if only because it was the first new one I've
seen in awhile that didn't plain Suck. Maybe my standards are too low
lately because of that, but what the heck; unless you're an certified
Costner-hater (or if the thought of seeing even fictionalized baseball
gives you gas), go check it out.</P>
<PRE>And that's the way I see it.</PRE>
