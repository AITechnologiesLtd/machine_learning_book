                                  BLACK RAIN
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Engrossing and moody travelogue of the
     dark side of Osaka.  As an excuse for the atmospheric
     photography there is a police chase plot you have seen *many*
     times before.  The plot is punctuated by a lot of mindless
     violence and action, but the atmosphere is really the film's
     main virtue.  Rating: low +1.</PRE>
<P>     A store near me sells a watch that comes with five watchbands of
different colors and five watch faces to match.  The ad says it is five
different watches in one.  The works, of course, remain the same.  You just
change some superficial outer trappings and the ad would have you believe
that you really have a different watch.  At times I think that the American
film industry thinks that same way.</P>
<P>     The story of BLACK RAIN was a good one at one time.  A cop is trying to
bring a mean and violent criminal to justice.  The cop screws up and his
prisoner escapes.  Now he has got to go out into the hostile environment to
bring the creep to justice again.  Fortunately, he gets someone to work with
him.  Unfortunately, he and his new partner can't stand each other.  But
working together for a common goal, against all odds, they learn to respect
each other and finally get the creep.  But they have also learned an
important lesson in human understanding.  Yes, Hollywood has once again
remade RED SUN, RED HEAT, 48 HOURS, BEVERLY HILLS COP, and by now probably a
dozen other films that have that same plot, give or take a detail.  I will
give whoever first wrote that plot some credit, it would have been a good
plot if it had been used once.  Too bad it has become such a popular
standard that good filmmakers like Ridley Scott feel they can get away
filming it again and calling it a new story.</P>
<P>     Now let's get down to a few of the specific details for BLACK RAIL.
In this case, the hostile environment is Osaka.  The main cop is really two
American cops.  One is Nick a dishonest but basically good cop sleazily
played by Michael Douglas.  Nick's close shaves are many but always
figurative--he seems to be able to go for what must be an entire week with
the same two-day growth of beard.  And if the Japanese think Americans are
barbarians, Douglas's character more than justifies the viewpoint.  The
other cop is played much neater by Andy Garcia.  They stumble onto a Yakuza
execution in New York City and nab a major Japanese hood.  However,
escorting him to Osaka turns out harder than they expected.  So they find
themselves in a strange city in which they do not speak the language,
escorted by a dour-faced Japanese detective, Masahiro (played in a nicely
understated manner by Ken Takakura of THE YAKUZA).  The story is really
about how Nick and Masahiro learn to respect each other and how with
motorcycle chases and gunfights Nick regains his self-respect and becomes
honest again.</P>
<P>     If such a hackneyed plot is to be turned into a watchable film by
anyone, it would probably be a Ridley Scott.  Scott has directed some good
films, though generally their weakness has been plot problems.  His ALIEN is
a very good film but almost entirely because of mood and great visuals, not
because it has a stellar plot.  Similarly, the visual sense of BLADE RUNNER
outdistances the plot by miles.  Scott's plots are acceptable (usually
better than for BLACK RAIN's) but it is the misty atmospheric feel of the
film that makes his work worth seeing.  Watching a Scott film is the health
equivalent of smoking a pack and a half of cigarettes.  Virtually every
scene seems to have smoke or smog in it somewhere.  He has smoggy scenes of
New York, smoggy scenes of Osaka, smoky steel refineries, smoky police
departments.  But even if he is starting to do the smoky bit a little too
much he has a fresh eye, particularly for accenting the alien in an alien
culture.  His Osaka is a Japan we have rarely seen before, from neon buses
to smoky (of course) pachinko palaces.</P>
<P>     I will give BLACK RAIN a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale as an atmospheric
travelogue.  It was worth the $3 I paid just to see a different view of
Japan.  I figure the plot comes along free, and that was just a bit more
than what it is worth.</P>
