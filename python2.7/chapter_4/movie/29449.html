<P>Charlie Chan returns by ship with his children to his hometown for a working
vacation because he received a letter from Sir Stanley Woodland (David Torrence)
asking for help, but he did not spell out what that help is he wanted. On the
boat, he receives a threatening letter telling him not to stay in Shanghai. </P>
<P>Charlie is welcomed to Shanghai by Sir Stanley's attractive niece Diana Woodland
(Herve) and her boyfriend, Sir Stanley's secretary, Philip Nash (Charles
Locher-he later changed his name to Jon Hall). </P>
<P>Unfortunately at a banquet welcoming Charlie back to China, Sir Stanley opens up
a case to present a scroll to Charlie and an explosion from a gun-like device
occurs killing him. </P>
<P>It turns out that Sir Stanley was a British agent investigating opium smugglers.
Charlie does not even trust the police chief, Colonel Watkins (Hobbes), when he
asks to help, as Charlie tells him as of now he prefers to work alone. He is
only helped by his overeager but mostly inept Number One Son, Lee (Luke). In
their hotel room someone tries to kill Charlie, but Charlie had pillows stuffed
in his bed and slept in another room. </P>
<P>A chauffeur comes with a message to Charlie that it's urgent for the police
chief to see him immediately, he smells something fishy and calls the police
chief. But the hotel switchboard operator tells her boss Marloff that Chan is
still alive, as she puts Charlie's call through to him. Marloff acts as the
police chief confirming the meeting. When the real police call, Lee follows Chan
but is knocked out by the taxi driver and brought to where they are questioning
his father. But Lee makes up for his carelessness by telling them the place is
surrounded by police and uses kung-fu to overtake the captors as they go to
look. </P>
<P>James Andrews (Russell Hicks) arrives and tells Charlie he's an American agent
who was working with Sir Stanley on the opium smuggling case and that they
shouldn't confide in anyone else, as that's the way he worked with Sir Stanley.
A messenger gives Andrews a note marked very important, but when opened it is of
trivial concern. But when Nash is caught stealing that note and then is
suspected of trying to take a shot at Charlie while he was conferring with
Andrews, he is arrested by Watkins as his fingerprints are found on the weapon.
When Charlie takes Andrew's note back to the hotel, he recognizes the important
message written in invisible ink and becomes suspicious that Andrews didn't know
the code. But Andrews comes by Charlie's hotel and figures out the code. </P>
<P>When Philip escapes from Watkin's office with the help of Diana, Charlie doesn't
seem too concerned. And when Lee tells him he spotted the taxi driver who
kidnapped him and that he is at a waterfront club, Charlie whispers instructions
into Lee's ear and goes with Andrews to make the arrests there of the opium
smugglers. It concludes with an action-packed finale, which is not usually the
case for the more cerebral way Charlie solves his cases. But there's the usual
twist in plot to catch you by surprise as to who the gang leader is. </P>
<P>It made for a very entertaining film, a solid Charlie Chan vehicle even though
there's less detective work done in this Chan episode than in others. But the
film had plenty of energy, and Oland was just terrific as the persistent
detective getting shot at, being abducted, and keeping his head at all times as
he tracked down the gang and their leader. </P>
