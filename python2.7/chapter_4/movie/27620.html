<P>   Joan Baez sang a mournful song during the 1960s that
went like this: "Hard is the fortune of all womankind/ She's
always controlled, she's always confined/ Controlled by her
parents until she's a wife/ A slave to her husband all the rest
of her life."  Was she talking about the typical American
woman?  Could be, but if so that's her interpretation.  Joan
should see what a woman's life is like in Iran today.  Since
1979 when the Ayatollah took the reins of power forcibly
away from the Shah, Iran became a man's world.  Women
were restricted not only by the lifeless clothing they had to
wear including the chador which covered them over garments
that already needed to hide every hair on their head but more
by a full range of allegedly Koranic restrictions that forbade
them to smoke in public, to travel from city to city unless
accompanied by their husbands or male relatives or unless
they were in possession of the proper student or other id's.  </P>
<P>   But forget about mere words.  No-one has done a better
job than Jafar Panahi, utilizing a screenplay based on his
own ideas from the pen of  Kambozia Partovi, in portraying a
narrow world that women face in Tehran nowadays, where
religious police patrol the streets looking for violations of
medieval rules, even entrapping people into violating laws 
against prostitution.  </P>
<P>   Panahi's "The Circle," which gets its name from
 the circuitous path traveled by women who simply 
cannot break loose, cannot make progress, but
go round and round in much the way that the Greek figure
Sisyphus kept rolling a stone up a hill only to have the marker
come tumbling down once again.  Unlike American movies
like Jonathan Kaplan's "Brokedown Palace" (depicting the
absurd harshness of the police in Thailand who entrap Alice
and Darlene on a trumped-up drug charge), "The Circle," or
"Dayereh" as Panahi's film is called in Farsi, uses no score
and makes frequent takes with a handheld camera as though
following the Dogme 95 style. In other words, "The Circle" comes
across without Hollywood histrionics but rather as would a
docudrama in its description of the plight of a handful of
unfortunate females in Iran's benighted capital.</P>
<P>   Panahi frames the film by showing a section of a door
opening and closing on a woman who beseeches an official
for information, and to carry the metaphor of the title further
even portrays much of the architecture of the city in circular
form.  The story opens on a woman screaming from the pain
of childbirth (Solmaz Gholami) whose elderly mother displays
a distraught expression.  An ultrasound test had predicted
that the newborn would be a boy but when a girl turns up,
Solmaz fears that her in-laws would insist on a divorce.  (One
could scarcely accept the idea that this extreme reaction is
typical throughout the country, or every woman giving birth to
a little girl would be a single mother!)  The most frantic scene
of the film focusses on three young women who had just
been granted temporary leave from prison.  When one is
arrested, the other two, Arezou (Maryiam Parvin Almani) and
her buddy Nargess (Nargess Mamizadeh) plan to flee by bus
to a rural area of the state where they believe they can find
safety from the police.  The most poignant vista involves Pari
(Fereshteh Sadr Orfani), who had escaped from jail after her
husband was executed, and now, four months pregnant, she
begs a friend who works in the local hospital to get her an
abortion.  No such luck.  To get such a procedure requires
the husband's permission and, if no husband is available, the
father and father-in-law must consent.  (To be honest, I was
surprised that abortion is even legal in Iran, requiring merely
the acquiescence of the husband!)</P>
<P>   Because Panahi does not coddle us with a commercial,
American-style of filmmaking, "The Circle" will depend for
success on an arthouse audience with the patience to endure
and even thrive on Panahi's extended looks at each of the
women.  He can hold his camera on a face for a solid minute,
giving the viewer the chance to absorb the inner torment of
these ill-fated people.  The one person who might be most
accepting of her jail sentence would be Mojgan (Mojgan
Faramarzi), who could pass for a hooker anywhere. She does
not try to hide her profession and at one point justifies her
choice of profession: "How else do I pay my bills, honey?"</P>
<P>   Though critical of the Iranian political system, "The Circle"
might conceivably have passed the censorship boards in that
country if only because the apparatchiks there might see
nothing wrong with the way these women are treated.  The
reality, though, is that Panahi succeeded in getting a permit to make the
picture only when his country's directors' guild interceded
with the government for him.  The authorities were even
willing to show the movie in Iran if the director would cut the
final eighteen minutes (which he did not).  What happened
then was that after 400 students in his country saw the film at
a private screening, it was shipped to Venice where it wowed
the folks at a festival there and wound up in last year's New
York Film Festival as well.  Except for the poignancy shared
by Panahi's other works, his third film is most unlike his naive
but effective "The White Balloon," a story about a little girl
who runs into an assortment of people while buying a
goldfish.  When you realize that women in Afghanistan have it
even worse than the fair sex in Iran, you get to wonder about
the rationality of the civilized mind.</P>
