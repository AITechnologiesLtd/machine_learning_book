<PRE>Gentleman's Agreement (1947)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 83</PRE>
<P>"Gentleman's Agreement" is a drama that explores prejudice
against Jews.  Not the kind of prejudice that is demonstrated
in a fiery, defamatory speech, but the quiet kind, done to
exclude Jews from a job, a home, or a social occasion.
The film also infers that it is not enough merely to not
discriminate personally, but that discrimination when found
must be confronted, or it will continue.</P>
<P>"Gentleman's Agreement" accomplishes these ambitious goals
while being compelling rather than pedantic.  Gregory Peck
is the lead, a widower writer with a young son who has
just arrived in New York.  He has a new job at a magazine
but has a difficult assignment: he must write an article
about anti-semitism from an emotional viewpoint.</P>
<P>Peck's character, who is a Christian, decides to tell his
co-workers and acquantainces that he is a Jew for the
duration of the story.  He soon encounters prejudice,
and always confronts it directly, even when it comes from
his fiancee (Dorothy McGuire).  People are quick to tell
him that they are not prejudiced, but their phrases
and actions say otherwise.</P>
<P>Peck is perfectly cast for the role.  His character
radiates integrity and deserved self-righteousness,
giving him the moral authority to identify (and tell off)
others when they show prejudice.  The script is also
kind enough to always give him the last word.  Peck
would later have a similar (and even more famous) role
in "To Kill a Mockingbird".</P>
<P>I don't like McGuire's character.  She is delicate and affected,
and can't handle stress or confrontation.  Peck must choose
between her and brassy Celeste Holm.  I won't reveal his decision,
but you can guess whose side I am on.  I am not criticizing
McGuire's performance though, as she plays the character well.</P>
<P>Time has made some of the film's references obscure.  Bilbo
and Gerald L. K. Smith were apparently nationally-known
at the time as hate-mongers against Jews.</P>
<P>While the romance in "Gentlemen's Agreement" is unconvincing,
Peck's battle against prejudice remains compelling and makes
for good drama.</P>
