<P>I don't think any one director's film stands out as clearly as his or
her masterpiece as '2001: A Space Odyssey' does for Stanley Kubrick.
Amazingly, in my opinion, the film doesn't look dated at all.  On DVD,
the clarity, colour, resolution and overall presentation have held up
remarkably well.  It's the kind of film that contains hypnotic elements
directly intended to stir any imagination and conjure up debate
contained in its religious overtones.  It's also the kind of film that
means different things to different people.  The entertainment value of
it's beginning, middle and ending depend entirely on your views of
evolution vs. creationism.</P>
<P>In 1989's 'Field of Dreams', Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) observes while
speaking to Terence Mann (James Earl Jones) that he once read a passage
he wrote that speaks of all the cosmic tumblers of the universe falling
into place and for a brief moment the universe opens up to show you
what's possible.  This was never more true than for the film '2001: A
Space Odyssey', as it is a film far ahead of its time and when it was
released in 1968, it kept in line with director Stanley Kubrick's
central theme of technology running amok.</P>
<P>Failing to earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination, '2001: A Space Odyssey'
did get nominations for Kubrick as Best Director, Best Screenplay, based
on the work of author Arthur C. Clarke's 'The Sentinel'.  Clarke
co-wrote the screenplay with Kubrick.  The film received additional
Oscar nominations for its sets and Kubrick won an Oscar for creating,
supervising and executing the film's tremendously revolutionary visual
effects.</P>
<P>Beginning in prehistoric times with what the film's opening caption puts
forward as 'The Dawn of Man', apes move around on a huge open wasteland
and display the barbaric attributes that would remain intact as
evolution would eventually make them humans.  A group of the beasts
awaken one morning to find a a large rectangular black slab among the
natural landscape of desert rock.  The primates are astonished by its
remarkably smooth texture and divine construction, perhaps it served as
a stepping stone (no pun intended) for mankind's progress in the things
he later invented.  Perhaps the wheel, the printing press and other
forms of ancient technology could be derived from this.  The large
rectangular black slab is known as the monolith.  The monolith appears
later in the film and its purpose remains a mystery.</P>
<P>>From a slow motion shot of a primate throwing a bone in the air, the
film cuts to a time we now know as being near to the 21st century as a
space craft in the similar shape of the bone travels through outer space
and we are treated to some wonderful classical music by Strauss as we
gaze in splendor at Kubrick's fantastic visual style.</P>
<P>The monolith appears again in 1999 on the moon near the Sea of
Tranquility as an expedition team of American astronauts finds it and
the monolith omits an eerie ringing to deafen all who come into contact
with it.</P>
<P>Next is the Jupiter mission in the year 2001. Astronauts David Bowman
(Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) lead an expedition team
aboard the spacecraft Discovery.  They are seen as the rest of the crew
is in hibernation for the long trip.  The computer overseeing the
mission is HAL 9000.  I noticed that the three letters after H, A and L
are I, B and M.  Coincidence?  Who knows?  Seems clever to me.  HAL 9000
is voiced by actor Douglas Rain who has an eerie emptiness in his voice,
making HAL a most chilling character and the best developed one in the
movie, even more so than his human counter parts.</P>
<P>As the mission proceeds there is an apparent malfunction by the HAL 9000
computer and this leads to the beginning of the film's stunning climax
where silence is used as powerfully as any loud, expensive action film
where the noise is deafening.  This is the film's greatest asset.  The
terror of being alone in space where the silence is extremely loud to
the human condition is felt as clearly as actually being in the film.</P>
<P>The term 'Space Odyssey' pertains mostly to the film's last half hour as
astronaut Bowman is transported to a part of the universe not only
unexplored by man but unimagined as well.  The mansion style
surroundings contained in the film's lavish conclusion where a bedroom,
bathroom and dining room are seen by Bowman observing his own origins
and future lend suspicions that mankind's origins have an outer space
connection which is a theory put forward by many scientists.</P>
<P>I must confess that I am not a student of literature.  I don't read
books.  When I observe a film, I judge it only on its own merits and any
comparisons I may draw to its literary origins are based on what I've
heard and researched.  One thing I didn't like about the sequel to
'2001: A Space Odyssey' entitled '2010: The Year We Make Contact' is the
explanation of why the HAL 9000 computer failed.  The computer was
apparently told of the true nature of the mission and instructed not to
reveal anything to Bowman or Poole so when HAL was questioned by the
astronauts in the original film, he became trapped and not having the
human capacity to lie, he malfunctioned.  This seems like a cop out to
the original film's theme of technology running amok as I mentioned in
the second paragraph as '2010' explains that human meddling caused HAL
to malfunction rather than HAL malfunctioning on his own.</P>
<P>'2001: A Space Odyssey' is a marvel of film making not for what it does
but for what it doesn't do.  It doesn't try to be a film with a formula,
primary character development or scathing amounts of dialogue.  There is
in fact, very little dialogue in its running time of nearly two and a
half hours and Stanley Kubrick's intention is to leave his audience with
something to take home in their minds and reflect upon it as not only a
work of art but as an experience designed to push the full limits of the
human imagination.</P>
