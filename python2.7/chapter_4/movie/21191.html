<PRE>PERFECT BLUE
Japan, 1997
Directed by Satoshi Kon
Screenplay by Sadayuki Murai from novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi
Reviewed by Kent Johnson</PRE>
<P>This is an animated murder mystery suspense thriller from Japan about an
idol singer trying to become a serious actress.  The last third is so
wonderfully surreal that it seems an inconclusive "which world is real?"
ending is inevitable (but it isn't).  PERFECT BLUE is excellently
written and executed and except for one thing, would be moody,
suspenseful and shocking -- all the virtues of a good mystery film
combined with the beauty and poetry of an animated film.</P>
<P>The fact that PERFECT BLUE is *opening* at the dinky Opera Plaza theatre
(usually reserved for second-run art films) tells you how marginal this
release is, so it's great that it made it into the theatres at all.
Unfortunately, instead of being subtitled, the film has been dubbed in
English and although it's not that bad for an English dubbing effort, at
every turn the dubbing undermines the effectiveness of the film.  The
voices don't sound right, the dialogue is awkward because it was
rewritten to match the animated mouth movements and Japanese concepts
are slaughtered in the Americanized dialog.</P>
<P>It's disturbing to watch a movie which you constantly have to mentally
filter ("Well, would have been a good scene if it was subtitled...),
especially since Japanese voice-acting is generally really good and adds
a lot to the animated films.  I don't feel like I'll have really seen
the film until I see a subtitled version.</P>
<PRE>Evaluation:  Dubbed:  Worth Seeing
                   Subtitled:  Highly Recommended</PRE>
