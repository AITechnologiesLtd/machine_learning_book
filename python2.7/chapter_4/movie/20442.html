<PRE>Lonely Hearts (1982)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"Lonely Hearts" is an engaging romantic
comedy, gentle and ironic in its writing
and direction.  An Australian production,
it is refreshing in its unpredictability,
its indifference to marketing demographics,
and in the depth and credibility of its
lead characters.</P>
<P>Peter (Norman Kaye) is a middle-aged man
who has spent his life living with his
mother, who has recently died.  He makes
a modest living as a piano tuner, and has
a number of friends, mostly involved with
amateur theater.  He joins a dating service
and is assigned Patricia (Wendy Hughes),
a thirtyish woman who is inhibited and
frigid, perhaps due to her controlling
and demanding parents.</P>
<P>Some of the supporting characters are
interesting.  There is a blunt, despairing
play director (Jon Finlayson) who seems
to live for his amateur productions.
Patricia's father (Vic Gordon) seems
intent on keeping his daughter emotionally
dependent and without relationships.</P>
<P>The wry script deftly nails some of the
difficulties associated with romantic
relationships, especially the unrealistic
expectations that can come with them.
The low budget shows, however, as the
sets and cinematography are limited, and
most of the film has a playlike atmostphere.</P>
<P>"Lonely Hearts" won the Best Film award
from the Australian Film Institute.  It
was also nominated for Best Actor (Kaye),
Best Actress (Hughes), Best Direction
(Paul Cox), and Best Screenplay (Cox and
John Clarke).</P>
