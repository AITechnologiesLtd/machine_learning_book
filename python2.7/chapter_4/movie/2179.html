<P>The history books lie.  Most of us recognize that, but it isn't until 
we're exposed to a blistering film like WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS that we 
get a clear image of the extent of the lies.  While admittedly this 
documentary doesn't make any declarations of objectivity, most of its 
claims ring more true than what we've been taught in our high school 
history classes.</P>
<P>WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS gives us the Native American perspective on the 
last five hundred years, beginning with the landing of Christopher 
Columbus (who, not surprisingly, is far from a hero in their opinion), 
and ending with the current treatment of the race in Canada (which 
probably isn't all that different from their treatment in the United 
States).  Films like DANCES WITH WOLVES have attempted to present a 
different perspective of American Indians in fiction; WAR AGAINST THE 
INDIANS does the same thing in fact.</P>
<P>In order to better explain why Native Americans reacted as they did to 
the arrival of the White Man, producer/writer/director/narrator Harry 
Rasky spends time giving a condensed primer of American Indian mysticism.  
While some of this may be a little tough to accept for those not brought 
up with similar beliefs, this background makes it less difficult to 
understand why the work of early Christian missionaries was viewed as 
offensive.  </P>
<P>The plunder of North America is brought brutally into focus, both then 
and now.  For hundreds of years, greed and gold justified atrocities.  
Today, forests are torn down and land ripped up in the name of progress.  
WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS makes the telling point that despite man's 
apparent maturity as a species, there are some things that have changed 
very little.</P>
<P>The impression of most people is probably that the Native American is 
treated far better today than he was five-hundred (or even one-hundred) 
years ago.  Certainly, it's true that there is no longer the wholesale 
slaughter that happened at Wounded Knee, but such killing has been 
replaced with a far more subtle and subversive method:  assimilation.  
The danger is no longer the genocide of a people, but the eradication of 
a culture.</P>
<P>Many whites watching this movie are likely to have moments of extreme 
discomfort as they consider some of the points uncovered by WAR AGAINST 
THE INDIANS.  Cynics will brush these concerns aside, but those with a 
more thoughtful viewpoint may find themselves disturbed.</P>
<P>The problem with the film is its presentation, not its content.  While 
the straightforward documentary style can sustain short movies, it 
becomes cumbersome for longer efforts, and almost unbearable when a movie 
nears the two and one-half hour mark.  Rasky doesn't try anything 
innovative, instead opting for simple interviews, landscape shots, and 
views of paintings and photographs.  Without the originality of such 
efforts as ROGER AND ME, THE THIN BLUE LINE, and BROTHER'S KEEPER, this 
film threatens boredom before it ends.  WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS is 
perhaps forty-five minutes too long.</P>
<P>Whether you should see this film or not depends in general on your 
opinion of documentaries, and specifically on your interest in the 
subject matter.  WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS may be too didactic for the 
casual viewer.  As a means of presenting ideas and redressing historical 
wrongs, WAR AGAINST THE INDIANS is an excellent effort.  However, its 
methods of doing these things is somewhat lacking.</P>
