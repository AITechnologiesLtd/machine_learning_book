Susan Granger's review of "BLACK AND WHITE" (Palm Pictures/Sony Screen Gems)</P>
<P>  There are not too many films that attempt to give viewers an
insight into contemporary American society like Spike Lee's "Jungle
Fever" and "Get on the Bus" along with Warren Beatty's "Bulworth." But
now there's James Toback's "Black and White," which delves into race
relations and hip-hop music in New York City.  Toback sets the stage
in an early classroom scene in which a young black girl talks about
how all the white kids she knows romanticize the ghetto life, while
all her black friends just want to get out of it. There are several
intersecting plotlines. Brooke Shields and Robert Downey Jr. play
documentary film-makers examining privileged white teens who are
obsessed with street life. That's Elijah Wood, Gaby Hoffman, Bijou
Phillips (daughter of John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas), Eddie
Thomas and Kim Matulova. Then there's the rap mogul/gangsta, played by
Oli "Power" Grant from Wu-Tang Clan, and Joe Pantoliano as a District
Attorney with family problems. Ben Stiller is a crooked cop who bribes
a college basketball star, played by Allan Houston of the Knicks, plus
Mike Tyson as - who else? - Mike Tyson. Claudia Schiffer surfaces as a
grad student. Even Donald Trump's former wife, Marla Maples, shows
up. James Toback obviously improvised much of the fragmentary action
as he went along with no sense of cohesion or purpose, so this is not
a smooth, evenly edited picture, but perhaps it isn't supposed to
be. And the most authentic buzz about deceit and treachery comes from
the recruited performers, not the professional actors. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Black and White" is a complex, sexually
energetic, fast-paced 4.  It's a risky, interesting concept but not a
very good movie.</P>
