<PRE>                               MURIEL'S WEDDING
                       A film review by Christopher Null
                        Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     What is it with Australians and ABBA?  First THE ADVENTURES OF
PRISCILLA took ABBA worship to a new level.  Now, MURIEL'S WEDDING
seeks to break that boundary with a nearly non-stop ABBA soundtrack.
After nearly two hours of exposure, I'm realizing that they weren't too
bad of a band.</P>
<P>     MURIEL'S WEDDING uses the songs of the Swedish supergroup as a
clever link to the thoughts and feelings of Muriel, a young Australian
woman obsessed with becoming married as soon as possible.  Muriel (Toni
Colette) lives with her go-nowhere family in the town of Porpoise Spit,
where she spends most of her time in her room, listening to ABBA when
her father isn't giving her grief.</P>
<P>     With the rest of her family members constantly off in their own
world, Muriel decides to take off on holiday with a little "borrowed"
cash from her father in order to escape the routine of Porpoise Spit
and make a new life for herself.  She eventually settles in Sydney with
her friend, Rhonda, where she can concentrate fully on her goal of
marriage.</P>
<P>     MURIEL'S WEDDING is an entertaining film with a bit of an identity
crisis:  it doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama.  The
filmmakers perpetually toy with the viewers, dragging them from high
comedy to melodramatic tragedy in a heartbeat, and more than once.
This problem arises whenever the camera is not on Colette, who really
owns this picture completely.  Whenever the plastic supporting cast is
the main focus, the film falls flat.  A tacked-on, bittersweet ending
doesn't help, either.</P>
<P>     Don't be discouraged; MURIEL'S WEDDING is still a solid and
entertaining movie.  Just understand what you're getting in to.
There's lots of music, but this ain't no disco.</P>
