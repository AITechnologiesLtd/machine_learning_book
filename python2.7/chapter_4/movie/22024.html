<P>Riddle me this:  when does a crime drama become an art film?  Answer:  when 
it's directed by Steven Soderbergh.</P>
<P>Soderbergh's direction of "The Limey" is both quiet and stunning.  It's the 
story of a career criminal named Wilson, portrayed by Terence Stamp.  Wilson 
leaves England for Los Angeles with the intent to investigate and possibly 
to avenge his daughter Jennifer's death.  So what we have is a revenge 
story, and when we see Wilson's method of operation, we know it's going to 
be a violent one.  In scene after scene, Soderbergh has this aging bloke 
step right into the rhythm of a seedy Southern California atmosphere;  
Wilson contacts a former friend of Jennifer's, an ex-con named Ed, who is 
now trying to stay clean.  Wilson is shown purchasing a pistol and several 
rounds from a couple of bike-riding bangers.  Next he follows a lead to a 
warehouse where he asks about a man named Valentine.  When Wilson mashes a 
man's face and steals Valentine's address from a Rolodex, things heat up on 
both sides.  The director shows admirable taste when he keeps the key 
violence off-scene.</P>
<P>Another dimension of the script kicks in when Wilson contacts another of his 
daughter's friends, an acting coach named Elaine (Leslie Ann Warren).  She 
does not seem to think the circumstances of Jennifer's death are suspicious, 
but she seems to understand Wilson's need to discover the truth.  Although 
the scenes leading to friendship between Wilson and Elaine are too few, we 
totally believe the connection between them.  Warren is nicely cast for the 
role, and she plays a sophisticated foil to Wilson's Cockney-accented 
plainness.  Guzman's Ed is also pals with Wilson.  His role is to leaven the 
Brit's hot-headedness, or at least to help his friend to avoid prison.</P>
<P>What's so original about Soderbergh's method is camera work.  Director of 
Photography Ed Lachman assists Soderbergh's vision with a series of 
flash-forwards:  we frequently view shots from scenes that take place 
several minutes later.  In a type of forecasting montage, the frame often 
slows down, cross-cuts or repeats key images.  Soderbergh has always shown a 
fascination with multiple facets, and his narrative technique here is a 
successful experiment.  Occasionally he resorts to holding his subject in 
the corner of the frame instead of in the center - a trend popular in 80's 
commercials.  But the storytelling intelligence outweighs this cliché.</P>
<P>In depicting the different sides of Wilson's life - husband and father and 
sociopath - Soderbergh also employs various flashbacks.  We see Jennifer as 
a child, galloping across a beach or peering through a doorway at her 
parents.  When we watch her-a cute little girl threatening to turn her dad 
into the police should he go astray again -- we become closer to her and 
perhaps feel more acutely her father's loss.  In a bizarre and original 
effort on the part of the filmmakers, clips from the 1967 film "Poor Cow" 
show a dark-haired Terence Stamp playing a thief named "Wilson."  He 
interacts with a bubble-haired woman, and even plays a song on a guitar, and 
we can tell it's Stamp.  What an effect!  Stamp is a long-shot for 
nominations for major awards, but if "The Limey" gets the attention it 
deserves, this almost 40-year veteran of the screen will have even more 
roles in which to show his superior talents.</P>
<P>The action in "The Limey" is sudden and striking.  First in the warehouse, 
and several times as Wilson closes in on Valentine, we see almost unexpected 
escalation into violence.  As Valentine, Peter Fonda seems to reprise many 
of the roles he played in the 60's.  He does seem rather Eastwood-like with 
his hoarse whisper;  but Fonda has perfected an understated acting style 
that works well here, in his role of hunted man.  It's fascinating to watch 
the touches of characterization that tell us of Valentine's underworld 
connections, which he tries to rationalize away.  Because Valentine is not 
himself a violent man, he has hired the smooth and ruthless Avery (played by 
another veteran of many television and film outings, Barry Newman).  Avery 
in turn hires a couple of street toughs to rub out Wilson, but is not afraid 
himself to pump a shotgun if necessary.  Newman is a reliable actor who 
sketches here a sophisticated killer, completely efficient and amoral.</P>
<P>As much as the action of this film is well-done, it is the characterization 
that strengthens the story.  We end up knowing so many sides of Wilson, and 
end up liking him, even after we see him killing one of Valentine's henchman 
in cold blood.  The henchman is also not guiltless.  So all of these 
characters have taints of badness, and the result is a modern naturalism, an 
updated revenge film with style, slickly directed and watchable more than 
once.</P>
