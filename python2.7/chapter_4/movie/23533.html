<P>Coming at a time when so many family films aim to bowl audiences over
with razzle-dazzle animation ("Toy Story 2"), state-of-the-art
animatronics ("Stuart Little") or nonstop merchandising ("Pokemon: The
First Movie"), "The Tigger Movie" represents a refreshing detour from
the norm.  Recent Disney efforts such as "Tarzan" and "Mulan" have
employed gorgeous, almost three-dimensional visuals, but "Tigger" has
a retro look that's very much in line with the 1960s shorts "Winnie
the Pooh and the Honey Tree" and the Oscar-winning "Winnie the Pooh
and the Blustery Day." As in those films, most of the art looks like
it was based on watercolors and charcoal sketches, and it's a pleasant
blast from the past.</P>
<P>Nor do the songs by veteran Disney music men Richard M.  Sherman and
Robert B. Sherman ("Mary Poppins") have much to do with the Phil
Collins pop of "Tarzan." Instead, they're simply clever little ditties
that spring from the characters: Pooh warbles a "Lullabee" to put a
hive full of angry bees to sleep, while Tigger's "'Round My Family
Tree" underscores his fantasy about his ancestors.</P>
<P>The voices may have changed a little in the past 30 years - Jim
Cummings does splendid work voicing both Tigger and Pooh, while Nikita
Hopkins' Roo has just the right mix of sweetness and spunk - but the
sweet-natured characters and gentle humor have been preserved. So has
the concept of having the story's episodes pop off the pages of a
book, a subtle reminder that if you like the movie, you might want to
read the original A.A. Milne tales.</P>
<P>My 4-year-old niece Rachael (who, for the record, loved the movie, as
did her 6-year-old sister Megan and 2-year-old sister Emily) astutely
compared "Tigger" to "The Last Unicorn," an underappreciated 1982
feature which has become one of her personal favorites. Like
"Unicorn," it involves a unique creature - in this case, Tigger, of
course - who goes off in search of its own kind and learns a valuable
lesson in the process.</P>
<P>Tigger's journey is sparked by an accident in which Tigger
inadvertently drops a boulder on the deadpan donkey Eeyore's home
(don't worry: Eeyore isn't inside at the time) and incurs the wrath of
Rabbit.</P>
<P>Ordinarily, Tigger might have laughed off the incident.  But Roo, the
young kangaroo who Tigger describes as being on "the smallish side of
tiny and a little bit lacking in the perpendicular," idolizes Tigger
and has innocently put thoughts in Tigger's head about the possibility
he's not the only spring-loaded feline in the world. So Tigger sets
off on an "expotition" to uncover his history, a process complicated
by the involvement of Pooh Bear, Owl, Kanga and Piglet.</P>
<P>The story makes the same point as "Stuart Little," that a family is
not defined by its physical similarities, but by the feelings members
share for each other. There's nothing wrong with being different,
we're told, especially if you can still love - and be loved by - those
who aren't like you.  That's an important message for children to
hear, particularly those who feel like outsiders in their peer group
because of their size or talents, and it's quite entertainingly
conveyed here.</P>
<P>"The Tigger Movie" is preceded by a brief music video from Lou Bega,
in which he rewrites his Top 10 hit "Mambo No.  5" as a tribute to
Disney characters: "a little bit of Minnie in my life, a little bit of
Mickey by her side," etc. It cracked up most of the kids and several
of the adults in the preview audience.</P>
