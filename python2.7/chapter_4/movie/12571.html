<P>        Critics have been quick to judge the current trend of films about grand-scale
 disaster as pure eye candy, and for the most part they're right. However,
 "disaster" is somewhat of a misnomer as the type of films aren't so much about
 the cataclysmic events themselves as they are about people banding together
 because of a threat. This is a concept that could, in theory, combine action
 and drama perfectly, and "Deep Impact" is the latest mega-budget event movie
 of the sort which tries its hardest to be completely plausible, but in turn
 detracts from the fantasy of it all. </P>
<P>        There's no denying we want to be excited and intrigued by movies right from
 the get-go, and this film realizes that notion and exploits it through one of
 the most pathetic excuses for tension ever produced. We start off with a high
 school astronomy club in Arizona where a boy named Leo Biederman (Wood) has
 unknowingly discovered a comet. When his pictures are sent to a professional
 observatory, the scientist there realizes the comet is on a collision course
 with Earth. Of course it takes a lot of high-tech computers to calculate this
 within seconds, but somehow the same computers can't log on to the Internet so
 the scientist can warn the world. If that had not already been a sign of the
 sheer cheesiness to the film, the script uses bottom-of-the-barrel cliches to
 "remove" the scientist and make for a sense of danger about as frightening as
 film is plausible.</P>
<P>        Incorporating the modern, massive news media is becoming an ever-increasing
 Hollywood trend and when used properly it can provide for a sense of reality.
 The film goes about establishing reality by using a popular broadcast
 journalist, Jenny Lerner (Leoni), as one of its main characters. Lerner is a
 typical character who plays an important role when she uncovers a news story
 involving the resignation of a Cabinet member which is secretly related to the
 government's discovery of the comet. Lerner seems to be the only reporter for
 MSNBC (which the film would have us believe is the only broadcast media), and
 is told she's stumbled onto something big. Meanwhile, she's having a personal
 crisis as her old divorced mother is depressed at her father's marriage to a
 much younger woman. All of this is generic to the extreme, especially as
 executed through Leoni's bland performance and scene after scene of pointless
 confrontations which would be right at home on "Melrose Place."</P>
<P>        Had the film begun at the second act it would not have been hindered at all.
 It takes at least 45 minutes for the aspect of the comet collision to come
 into play and thus create for some semblance of plot and conflict. The mid-
 section of the film suddenly becomes a series of interactions between
 supporting characters with an effort at tension thrown into the mix. Morgan
 Freeman co-stars as President Beck, who informs the world, and thus us the
 viewers, what the situation is and how it will be resolved. Freeman is great
 actor, but even he cannot create for the kind of suspense the film intends to
 build through philosophical lines and speeches and overly dramatic shots.
 Another great actor, Robert Duvall, co-stars as Spurgeon "Fish" Turner, the
 eldest member of a space crew sent to knock the comet off course, and yet he
 too seems silly trying to recite campy dialogue.</P>
<P>        Soon the focus shifts from any kind of a general plot to individual conflicts
 between the characters and the mission to save the world. Through both of
 these aspects it becomes more and more clear the attempts at intelligent
 storytelling have been exhausted. Needless to say, Turner's crew doesn't
 succeed on its mission (or else the film would have ended after an hour), and
 proceeds to make things worse. It's all downhill from there with as the
 characters are put through the meat grinder in an attempt to create for
 suspense which only comes across as melodrama (and poorly-written melodrama at
 that). It's difficult to feel sorry for them since they're so generic, not to
 mention how sloppy the script is in its attempt to balance the story.</P>
<P>        The last act clinches this idea as it seems like the world really will come
 to an end and yet none of the characters seem worried about it. The attitude
 is so apathetic that it asks us to sympathize with the characters who see
 confronting the impending apocalypse head-on as an honorable notion. The
 script conviently provides for the massive special effects disaster imagery it
 promises and a climatic resolution, but still fails to work even as eye candy
 as it's very unconvincing and ends much too quickly.</P>
<P>        Perhaps "Deep Impact" would have worked as a television mini-series as it
 tries to squeeze so much into such little time and space. It's no wonder story
 and character flaws and massive continuity errors take the place of drama and
 suspense.</P>
