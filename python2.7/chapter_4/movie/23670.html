<P>The premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `Final Destination'
causes a recollection of a memorable `Simpsons' Halloween episode. After
attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster, lovably ignorant
patriarch Homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine. After a
trek into the Cretaceous period, Homer observes that any minor
alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and
seriously modify the present world. Again and again, Homer toys with the
master plan and pays dearly for it. The characters of `Final
Destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their
existence - their `design'. Someone is after them with the strict intent
of correcting the mistake. That someone is Death.</P>
<P>You see, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) and six others have cheated the Grim
Reaper.... but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve. For a high
school excursion, Alex's French class is traveling to Paris by airline
transport. Alex, tense and neurotic, has a shocking premonition after
boarding: he sees the plane, and every passenger on it, spontaneously
explode in mid-air. In a panic of sheer lunacy, Alex charges his way
through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft. After a handful
of others (including one teacher) follow and are denied admittance back
onto the plane, the unwitting ‘survivors' watch in horror as the plane
actually explodes in the drizzling night sky. The loony vision Alex
experiences does actually materialize.  But Death won't be cheated so
easily, and one by one, the survivors of Flight 180 are offed in
mysteriously gruesome circumstances. The grisly murder count baffles the
local officials and FBI. Before I delve into the meat of the review, I'd
just like to confer.... is that one helluva premise, or what?</P>
<P>`Final Destination', creepy beyond rational comprehension, probably
reads more like an unsettling `X-Files' episode than `The Simpsons' -
therefore, the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators
behind both are Glen Morgan and James Wong. On familiar turf, the task
of establishing footing is not difficult for Morgan and Wong, and the
opening 20 minutes of `Final Destination' reflects that. Unlike most
thrillers, the set-up is crisp and cool. You just deeply, sincerely hope
that the momentum won't unspool, leaving us with a second-string effort
with nothing but cheap, derivative shocks. Young viewers have a palpable
reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration, what with `I Know
What You Did Last Summer' and sequel, `Idle Hands' and -- a movie with a
nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `Urban Legend'. After
the set-up, when I remained slouched apprehensively in my chair, I
started to really have fun with `Final Destination'. Low and behold, a
teen thriller that is actually unsettling, actually suspenseful and --
yes -- actually intelligent. Some splotty logic and a heap of
characteristic genre flaws aside, this film is among the most refreshing
and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge
`Scream' in 1996. `Final Destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a
exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher
crap we've endured throughout the past few years.</P>
<P>Not that the characters are that good. Sawa is game as Alex, a
connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend. In
addition, the survivors are endearing geek Tod (Chad E. Donella), jocky
control-freak Carter (Kerr Smith of `Dawson's Creek'), Carter's ditzy
girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer), the none-too-subtly named Billy
Hitchcock (Seann William Scott, supplier of lukewarm comic relief) and a
lone teacher - the emotionally delicate Ms. Lewton (Kristin Cloke).
Aside from Alex, the primary center of interest is intended to be Ali
Larter (`Varsity Blues'), playing an abstract character named Clear
Rivers (what were her parents thinking?!?). The personality of Clear is
written with such a vague, nebulous definition that she resembles a
walking flash-card saying `Hello, I am the offbeat character designed to
identify with the main character's plight!' Toss a few stereotypical FBI
agents (Daniel Roebuck and Roger Guenveur Smith) and a....ummm...
`spiritual' mortician (former `Candyman' Tony Todd) into the mix, and
you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing,
dicing and assorted disembowelments.</P>
<P>Not so. `Final Destination' has no slicing and dicing, or at least none
dealt by a human killer, and the thought of Death itself as the unseen
stalker is unique and frightening. The extra dimension of disconcerting
irony rejuvenates the decaying ‘murderer-on-the-loose' concept, with
assistance from a shrewd, intelligently paced screenplay by Morgan, Wong
and Jeffrey Reddick. The plot twists are fun and clever without toppling
into utter absurdity (listen up, `Reindeer Games'). But I suppose the
most satisfying aspect of `Final Destination' is the murder scenes.
Creative, resourceful and breathlessly inventive, the death sequences
involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise.
What will trigger the accident? Will it be the John Denver record, just
put on to play `Rocky Mountain High'? (yeah, sick humor). Will it be the
leaking toilet? The falling fishing reel in the corner? The murders are
startling and largely unforeseen, including one surprise incident that
made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for
roughly a minute afterward. A sense of giddy unpredictability is added
with this inventive approach. It gets sorta tasteless and cheap
sometimes, but who cares? It's fun.</P>
<P>In that simple regard, `Final Destination' is my cup of tea. This
stylishly executed thriller, although tagged with laughable
circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue, is an
immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side. After the show, it will
also have an frightening impact on you. When will your ‘design' expire?
Is Death waiting around the corner? The `Final' effect is a major case
of the heebie-jeebies.</P>
