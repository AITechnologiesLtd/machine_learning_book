<P>All right.  I admit it.  After seeing Lake Placid and Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me, the concept of a collaboration of David "The Bill Gates of TV"
E. Kelley and M. Jay "Cock" Roach didn't seem like an altogether good idea. 
Revision: it seemed like a terrible idea.  Despite the nice shot in the
preview of the kid rocketing down the ice, when the voice-over said "David E.
Kelley, the writer 'Ally MacBeal' and 'The Practice' and M. Jay Roach, the
director of Austin Powers" I groaned.  I expected it to be so bad that I
brought a book along with me.</P>
<P>A few minutes worth of word of mouth and my book went back in the car.</P>
<P>Unlike most movies that come highly recommended while seeming incredibly
mainstream, Mystery, Alaska did not disappoint me.  It did not annoy me.  It
did not make me cry, but it sure as hell made me laugh.</P>
<P>Mystery, Alaska is the story of a grassroots hockey team that ends up on the
cover of Sports Illustrated because of an article a former town dweller
(Charles Danner, played by Hank Azaria) wrote.  In it, Danner claims that "the
team of Mystery, Alaska has the skill to rival any of the NHL."  This being
American and this movie being Hollywood, the New York Rangers decide to take
the challenge and send up the team as a publicity stunt.</P>
<P>The first thing that will surprise you about Mystery, Alaska, aside from its
incredible scenery and ability to blend toilet humor with intelligence, is the
depth to which each character is explored.  They are all fully dynamic
individuals with background.  They all have their humorous side, they all have
their human side, and they all have their conflicts.  While real life may not
be that interesting or complete, what we the critics like to call this is good
characterization.  It's what lets the hooks penetrate our rocky hides and drag
us into the movie.</P>
<P>To start off with, we have John Biebe (Russell Crowe), the closest thing to a
main character that the movie has.  Biebe has been playing hockey all his
life, is desperately in love with his wife, and is the all-American Alaskan
that we'd expect.  He's even the town sheriff.  Then we have the
aforementioned writer Danner, who only seeks acceptance of the town.  We have,
for partial comedic effect and partial seriousness, Skank (a nickname), played
by Ron Eldard.  Skank gets his name for the obvious reason that he is
promiscuous to the Nth degree.  We have big-bodied, big-hearted Adam "Tree"
Lane (Kevin Durand).  We have the overweight lawyer who only loves hockey
(Maury Chaykin).  The Judge who is initially against inviting the Rangers to
play (Burt Reynolds).  And, this being a small town, the couple that is trying
to go all the way right under their parents noses (Rachel Wilson and Ryan
Northcott).</P>
<P>Although these characters may not be real, and the story is very obviously
not, the movie gives the impression of reality.  Hollywood being the business
of illusions, and the best illusions being the most realistic looking,
Mystery, Alaska does a very good job.</P>
<P>David E. Kelley should be lauded on his ability to sidestep every cliché that
could have found its way into the movie.  The characters aren't stock, the
ending unpredictable, and the laughs often shocking.</P>
<P>But I'm not all great words for Mystery.  It did use the toilet humor a
little too much, and it begins to get on your nerves after about thirty
seconds.</P>
