<P>     The film opens in an amphitheater in Greece, with an appropriately
garbed Greek chorus chanting of the deeds of Achilles and Oedipus.
Suddenly, unexpectedly, the masked men and women decide to switch to the
tale of Lenny Weinrib (Woody Allen)--definitely not a name known from
mythology.  And, as things go from slightly absurd to completely
ridiculous, the Chorus, led by F. Murray Abraham, say things like "Oh
cursed fate!  Some thoughts are better left unthunk!" and breaking into
verses of "When You're Smiling."  And all this is accomplished with an
appropriate level of pomposity.</P>
<P>     MIGHTY APHRODITE, Woody Allen's 1995 film, lacks the brilliance and
hilarity of his two previous efforts (MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY and
BULLETS OVER BROADWAY), but it's not bad as a lightweight one-hundred
minutes at the movies.  Thematically, the film is pretty thin, unless
you consider that everyone's life can resemble a Greek tragedy in one
way or another.  Allen appears determined to craft a motion picture that
can be laughed at without plumbing any especially deep neuroses of the
human condition.</P>
<P>     The story opens with Lenny and wife Amanda (Helena Bonham Carter,
sans period costumes and British accent) discussing adoption.  Lenny
doesn't want a child, but Amanda does, although she isn't willing to
sacrifice a year of her life to have one the normal, biological way.
Eventually, Lenny gives in and the couple gets a healthy male infant,
whom they name Max.  As the child grows and Amanda becomes more wrapped
up in her attempts to procure her own art studio, Lenny fights a growing
curiosity to learn more about his son's natural mother.  Eventually, he
sneaks a peek at the adoption agency's records.  This leads to a meeting
with Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino), the woman who gave birth to Max.  Much to
Lenny's dismay, she turns out to be a statuesque blond with a helium
voice and little in the way of intelligence.  Worse still is how she
makes her living--her dual career involves starring in porn films and
turning $200 tricks for a bald-headed, homicidal pimp.</P>
<P>     Woody Allen really only has one on-screen personality, and he plays
it here as usual, although, at this point in his career, he's getting a
bit old for roles better suited to someone twenty years his junior.
Helena Bonham Carter, taking time out from Merchant/Ivory type
productions, gives a snappy turn as a contemporary American woman.  The
only noticeable acting blot on MIGHTY APHRODITE is Michael Rapaport, who
displays the same lack of range and energy he showed in HIGHER LEARNING.</P>
<P>     The shining star is, without a doubt, Mira Sorvino (AMONGST
FRIENDS, BARCELONA), giving the finest performance of an as-yet short
career.  Since, in BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, Jennifer Tilly earned an Oscar
nomination for an inferior portrayal of a character of similar
intelligence, Sorvino deserves at least that much--if not more.  This
is a star-making outing by one of America's top young actresses.</P>
<P>     The most original element of MIGHTY APHRODITE is the use of the
Greek Chorus.  However, what starts out as a clever, innovative device
quickly becomes tedious through overuse.  The Chorus seems always to be
on hand to make pithy remarks, and their presence becomes intrusive.  At
times, it's as if Woody Allen is attempting to take a page out of the
MONTY PYTHON book, and those two very different styles of humor do not
mix well.</P>
<P>     While not up to the level of many of Allen's recent films, MIGHTY
APHRODITE is nevertheless an entertaining diversion.  The comedy, most
of which is light and easily accessible, is worthy of some laughs, and
the movie has a good sense of irony.  MIGHTY APHRODITE is far from a
tour de force, and some Woody Allen die-hards may be disappointed, but
there's enough in this picture to recommend it.</P>
