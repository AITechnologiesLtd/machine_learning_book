<P>The Diva, in her ME, MYSELF & IRENE review, was far too kind.  This
movie wasn't just bad; it was Ugly.  *Butt Ugly*.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Charlie (Jim Carrey), a mild-mannered Rhode Island motorcycle cop,
stands by while the world walks over him, especially his two-timing wife
Layla (Traylor Howard), who cheats on him with Chante Jackson (Tony
Cox), the Black chauffeur at his wedding.  Even when his "triplet" kids,
Jamaal (Anthony Anderson), Lee Harvey (Mongo Brownlee), and Chante Jr
(Jerod Mixon) come out looking remarkably more like Chante than him,
Charlie just grins and bears it--until Layla leaves him and Charlie
eventually snaps into two personalities: his mild, sexually-repressed
self, and "Hank", the angry, sexually-hungry, (and no longer) suppressed
side of him that Charlie "buried" inside when Layla ditched him.</P>
<P>Something-or-other about a dirt-dumb subplot involving Irene (Renee
Zellweger), the target of Charlie and Hank's affection, and bad cop Lt.
Gerke (Chris Cooper) and embezzlement at a golf course, ensues,
and...sorry, I can't be arsed to describe anything else about this inane
movie.  I'd really like to forget it ever happened, actually.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Going into this flick, I of course knew it was a Farrelly Brothers
production--and what that exactly meant.  Shakespeare, it ain't; I can
dig that.  And though I avoided THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY like the
plague, I understood well in advance that the gross factor would be high
in "Irene".  "Gross", I could deal with.  "Jackass Stupid" and
"Unreasonably Meanspirited", however, pisses me off to no end.</P>
<P>"Irene" has no redeeming factors, or at least, those that might bring it
up from the sewer it occupies, are so damn subtle and underplayed that I
spent more time getting irritated by the grating music, the illogical
plotline [whoever came up with the Bad Turf Manager idea, needs their
butt whupped.  Now.], the foolishly empty characters, the bad acting,
Zellweger's nails-on-a-blackboard voice, and the crappy "special
effects" [that cow looked like a reject from the JAWS mechanical animals
pile] than in noticing any semblance of good within its l-o-n-g reels of
film [two bloody hours?  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  Oops.  Forgot.]  The
sound of silence--in the theater, and from the screen in between moments
of Slapstick Hijinx--was deafening.  And remember, this was supposedly a
comedy.  Oops.</P>
<P>The only tolerable thing about this whole movie--Jim Carrey's amazingly
agile body and the way he can contort it--was tempered by the knowledge
that he's Been There/Done That before; the child's play has played out,
bub.   All the Clint Eastwood voice-channelling in the world can't make
up for the fact that Carrey has quickly become a one-trick pony,
recycling the same characterization over and over, ad nauseum.  I kept
thinking to myself, "He gets paid $20 mil for this?  Where do I sign up
for Clown Lessons???".  Even the Rhode Island scenery was marred by the
thuddingly foolish decision by the directors to have Charlie covered by
bugs when he motored through the countryside on his Harley Electra Glide
Police Special.  Having just recently taken a cross-country trip on the
back *and* front of an Electra Glide, I'd complain about the fact that
That Just Wouldn't Happen, but since the balance of this film wouldn't,
either, what's the point?</P>
<P>Wasted potential grinds my gizzards.  Recycled waste served up as a
fresh dish, causes me to paint Yellow lights, Red.  I want that two
hours of my life, refunded to me, dammit.</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
In this day and age of so-called Political Correctness (about as stoopid
a term as "colorblindness"), one must be careful not to get ones hackles
raised when the group with which one closely affiliates--be it Blacks,
women, paraplegics, Catholics, World War II vets, soccer moms, what have
you--is targeted in a flick like "Irene".  The thin-skinned amongst us
might be read'ta take up arms, crosses, bazookas, what have you, to
protest Those Bad People Who Made Fun Of Us.</P>
<P>Me, I don't consider myself all that thin-skinned.  So when much fun was
made of Chante and the chip on his shoulder for being Black, a
chauffeur, and a dwarf, I barely batted an eye [but, take note, Farrelly
bros: Chante is a *girl's* name, ka peach?]  When that ho Layla tongued
(ewww) Chante right in front of Charlie, I almost lost my lunch, but my
temper was intact.  Even the "one-drop rule" joke made of Charlie's
"triplet" (uh huh) sons, elicited not much more than a roll of my big
brown eyes.</P>
<P>But when the brothers Farrelly implied that the only thing Charlie's
smart, Black sons got out of watching Richard Pryor, was the ability to
toss around cuss words like lettuce in a salad...well, them's fightin'
words, buster.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
The question is begged: is Jim Carrey a grossly overpaid but
Misunderstood Clown with a Lucille Ball-like gift for physical humor
(and little else)--or does he just have an unholy fixation with his ass?</P>
<PRE>ME, MYSELF & IRENE (rating: redlight):
Mama don't like Ugly.</PRE>
