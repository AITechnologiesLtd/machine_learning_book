<PRE>                           VANYA ON 42ND STREET
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A group of actors get together in an
          old theater and perform Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" in
          modern dress.  This is an odd way to present a good
          play.  Chekhov does better with a more traditional
          performance of his work, and the revisions do
          little for the drama of the play.  Rating: low +2
          (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     This is a play within a play, though there is little in the outer
play to do much but to explain why the classic Russian play is being
done in modern dress and with virtually no set design.  A group of
actors get together in an old theater to perform Anton Chekhov's "Uncle
Vanya" for a tiny audience.  The film starts with a few external shots
of the streets around the theater, perhaps to get some motion and
action into the otherwise static film.  Once the play begins, it is
performed on one set which it leaves only for a minute or so at
intermission.  Even that would not matter as much for some playwrights,
but Chekhov wrote for a different culture, and audiences used to fast-
paced action plays by the likes of William Shakespeare may find the
style here a bit off-putting.  Chekhov is wont to have actors get their
turn in the conversation at speaking and not give up the floor for a
good five minutes.  The dialogue for this version was written by David
Mamet.  Mamet himself is used to giving characters short and choppy
dialogue, as he did in OLEANNA, and letting the actors speak for so
long may have been a bit of a strain on him.</P>
<P>     In the inner play Serybryakov (George Gaynes) is an incompetent
and talentless academic, successful without ever really understanding
his own supposed field of expertise.  His entire household sacrificed
to support him in his career, doing all the little low-profile clerical
tasks so that he could spend his time teaching and writing about art
that he did not really understand.  Now he has retired and spends his
days in writing about nothing at all and rudely demanding obeisance and
care from his household.  His beautiful second wife Yelena (Julianne
Moore) and Sonya his homely daughter from his first marriage (Brooke
Smith) tend to his whims.  Also tending is Vanya (Wallace Shawn), the
cynical and embittered brother of the professor's first wife.  Yelena
is lovelessly loyal to Serybryakov but is aware of the wistful,
unrequited love of her by both Vanya and Dr. Astrov (Larry Pine), the
physician who comes to the estate to treat the old professor.  In the
meantime, Sonya has fallen for Dr. Astrov.  With faster pacing these
tangled loves might have led to melodrama.  Instead it is preparation
for entanglement to come.</P>
<P>     Wallace Shawn, like Woody Allen, has one of those faces that is
hard to take seriously.  To some extent that acts as a hindrance to him
in this film, but less so than in many other dramatic roles.  But it is
part of the character Vanya's dilemma that he is not considered and
taken seriously.  Vanya is really something of a non-entity in his own
household and putting a man with a comical face in the role cuts a
little from the drama but also adds additional meaning to the story.
Julianne Moore, who plays Yelena looks like Jane Curtin and sounds like
Diane Keaton.  The former does not hurt all that much, but her
performance reminds one too much of Keaton in LOVE AND DEATH, which
makes a burlesque of just the sort of drama that Chekhov wrote.</P>
<P>     Somehow the technical credits show surprising unevenness.  Declan
Quinn's camera work is more irritation than art.  He frames scenes
badly, at times slicing off part of an actor's face.  Other times all
the action will be on one side of the frame while the rest of the frame
seems wasted.  During some speeches the camera seems distractingly
unsteady as if it is being hand-held.  All of this may have been
intentional, but if so the reason was not apparent.  Continuity is
poorly maintained.  At one point a character plays solitaire and when
seen from different angles there are different cards on the table.
Again there filmmaker may be saying that it is what is being spoken
that is important and not details like care for continuity.  It could
be a stylistic touch like e.e.cummings writing in lower case, but iF sO
iT dID nOT cONVEY aNY sPECIAL mEANING.  For that matter, if this is
supposed to be a stage play with no technical embellishments we are
seeing, we need some explanation as to why we can hear Yelena's
thoughts without her lips moving.</P>
<P>     There is little in this film that one could not get from seeing a
more traditional performance of the Chekhov play.  What is good the
film owes to Chekhov.  Because the play is good, the film gets a low +2
on the -4 to +4 scale.  But a more traditional performance with the
same actors would have gotten a higher rating.</P>
