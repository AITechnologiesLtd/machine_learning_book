<PRE>*** out of four</PRE>
<P>Starring Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly Shannon, Michael Vartan. Rated
PG-13</P>
<P>The first line of Never Been Kissed is "You know how some movies have these
dream sequences but they don't tell you it's a dream? Well, this is so not a
dream." If you examine those two sentences closely, you'll notice that they
don't really make sense. However, they made me sit up in my chair and really
pay attention, because those two sentences when placed at the beginning of a
film are somehow appealing, unusual, almost like a dream. This very well
describes the movie that follows those words. Wasting no time, we are
introduced to Josie Geller, a shy young copy editor for the Chicago
Sun-Times, who prides herself in her neatness and precision and who feels it
necessary to correct everyone else's grammar usage errors. She's a young,
small-time employee, who seems to be waiting for her big break as a reporter.
That break comes at a company meeting where her boss (played with hilarious
gusto by Garry Marshall) gives her an undercover assignment -- she is to
enroll in high school and investigate what the cool people of the 90's like
to do.</P>
<P>This is both delightful and depressing to Josie. She is overjoyed at her big
opportunity as an undercover reporter. But high-school also brings back
excruciating memories. She was the queen of geeks back then. The whole school
would mock her shouting "Josie Grosie!". She was invited to the prom by the
guy that she adored, only to be devastated when, on prom night, she finds out
it was a joke and gets pummeled with raw eggs as she is standing outside her
house in a dress waiting for her date.</P>
<P>So, you can imagine how it would be difficult for Josie to go back to all
those memories and attempt to fit in among teenagers, again. But go to
high-school she does, wearing a ridiculous outfit, being mocked, spit on and
rejected. She has no success among the "in" crowd, which is her assignment,
until her 23-year old cool brother (David Arquette) also enrolls in high
school and literally tells everyone to like her.</P>
<P>The idea, as well as the film itself, is completely implausible. It is
unconceivable that in this day and age, two twenty-year olds would be able to
enroll in a high school, without having their age revealed or at least
without generating some suspicion. It is also ridiculous that there could be
stories in the Sun-Times telling about an undercover reporter at that high
school, and not have anyone snoop around to find out who the person is. But
in this particular film, it hardly seems to matter. You see, Never Been
Kissed plays out almost like a surrealistic fantasy. Time flies when watching
it, and one feels almost as if he is in a dream.</P>
<P>The movie is ridden with cliches, but since nothing we see on the screen
seems real (in a good way), those cliches are there exclusively to make a
point. And the film's point is a nostalgic one; it seems to be saying that
people come and go, but school does not fundamentally change. The same kinds
of people will be there time and again, and what really matters what breed
you choose to fit into, what games you choose to play.</P>
<P>Drew Barrymore gives a charming performance in an interesting exploration of
what might happen if a girl gets a second chance at being young. She has a
big part in a little movie, making it twice as important for her to come
through, and she does. We are with her character every step of the way, and
we absorb and understand every dilemma that faces her.</P>
<P>Director Raja Gosnell, who made his directing debut almost two years ago, with
the digestible Home Alone 3, completely triumphs with this graceful,
entertaining, smart teen comedy/adult fantasy. It's not only funny, it's also
profound, touching and relatively subtle. Never Been Kissed blows a glaring
opportunity at the very end to really make its point heard, but I was too
delighted with the last two hours to complain.</P>
