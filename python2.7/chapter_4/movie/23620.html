<PRE>Erin Brockovich (2000)</PRE>
<P>Naming a film or book for its protagonist is often a simple but ingenious 
tactic.</P>
<P>It's a strategy used by writers from Charles Dickens and Honore de Balzac to 
Muriel Spark and Saul Bellow.  What we look for in these namesake titles is 
strong characterization: what else are they but focused character studies?  
A work should, after all, be about what it is called.</P>
<P>So ERIN BROCKOVICH serves as a good title, as its heroine seems to have two 
sides - the tender loveliness of a mother to match her first name, and the 
assaulting harshness of a fullback to match her last name.  Julia Roberts 
does a strong job displaying these sides, sometimes within the same extended 
shot.  As she is driving late at night, for instance, she calls home to talk 
with her lover, George (Aaron Eckhart).  After days of legal legwork she is 
exhausted and bitter, and just hearing his voice cheers her;  but what 
should confront her but that she has missed the first words of her infant 
daughter!  On a cell phone in a car, alone late at night, Roberts mixes her 
emotions wonderfully.</P>
<P>One flaw in the characterization is the lack of background.  We are told 
that Erin Brockovich has been married and divorced twice, that she had been 
badly used.  But her only behavior that reflects this history is her caution 
around men.  She is hesitant to get close to George too fast - or at least 
she claims she is hesitant - but we see no real evidence of past trauma.  
Couldn't director Steven Soderbergh have shot snippets of old fights, or at 
least provided family photographs of Brockovich's three children with their 
respective fathers?  The film spends more time showing the woman's futile 
job search than it does explaining why she is the way she is now.</P>
<P>What proves the salvation of Erin Brockovich is the job into which she 
insinuates herself.  Unsuccessful in a lawsuit against a doctor whose Jaguar 
plowed into her jalopy, Brockovich appears in the office of her lawyer Ed 
Masry (Albert Finney).  Again and again showing her abrasive attitudes, this 
determined mother becomes a top-notch legal assistant, sharpening her skills 
on a case that actually becomes too large for Masry's firm to handle by 
itself.  It's a suit against the multi-billion dollar corporation Pacific 
Gas and Electric, a company that has committed crimes against local 
populations by contaminating groundwater for decades.</P>
<P>Of course this whole situation reeks of cliché, and the players even refer 
repeatedly to David and Goliath.  But the acting lifts the premise out of 
the mundane and into the human: we see frailties and platitudes and motives 
that are believable, and we end up liking all of the main players, even 
though we might not want them as close friends.</P>
<P>As Ed Masry, Albert Finney may be a bit old, but his facility as an actor 
convinces us completely.  He plays a good foil to Brockovich, rolling with 
her ego-deflating punches, learning some tact himself from her tactless 
chidings.  Like the other focus characters, Masry's life before the action 
of the film - and outside the office as well - is kept uncomplicated.  We 
only hear him say, "But I'm married," yet we never meet his wife.  Such 
simplification is not always good, but it does create an emphasis on the 
action at hand, and evokes chemistry between Roberts and the masterful 
British actor.</P>
<P>Aaron Eckhart is underused in the picture.  George's relationship with Erin 
causes a certain ambivalence:  we want to see more of him, yet we admire the 
decisions made by screenwriter Susannah Grant, decisions that remove George 
from the scenes that lead up to the climax.  In any case, Eckhart has a sure 
screen presence, and is certainly cut from the cloth of young leading men.</P>
<P>Do we know enough about the problem that is causing various cancers and 
other illnesses among the people living near the gas and electric plant?  It 
is explained to us a few times, and thankfully, the explanations do not 
treat viewers as idiots, as does the scene in ARMAGEDDON in which Billy Bob 
Thornton moves a space shuttle model around a moon model.  Reservations:  
the business with the trump card, involving Charles Embry, comes too easily; 
and though it sounds unlikely, the story actually has too few courtroom 
scenes.</P>
<P>Julia Roberts is a sort of working person's actress.  She has created for 
herself a public persona that is slick and smart, that banters almost 
spitefully with the press yet offers pleasant interviews.  At 32, she's 
received the highest paycheck for a female lead, a reported $20 million for 
this outing.  That this information is common public knowledge attests to 
the coverage with which Julia Roberts is swarmed.  Like her or not, she is 
an important force in entertainment; fortunately for the public, her agendas 
are mature and decent and compassionate.  ERIN BROCKVICH shows that she can 
inhabit a character who is larger than life.</P>
