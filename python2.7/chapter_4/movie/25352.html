MUTATIS MUTANDIS</PRE>
<PRE>THE X-MEN</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Bryan Singer</PRE>
<P>Screenplay by David Hayter, based on the Marvel Comics characters</P>
<PRE>With Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart</PRE>
<PRE>UA South     PG-13     100 min    </PRE>
<P>     It's the not-too-distant future, and mutants (the kind with 
superpowers) are beginning to make their presence felt in our society.  
Society is not pleased - you know how it gets about accepting people who 
are different.  As Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), the leader of the 
anti-mutant putsch, thunders in Congress, "Would you want them teaching 
your children?"</P>
<P>     The allusion to gay rights is clear, but it's tricky metaphorical 
ground.  Kelly is a McCarthyesque bad guy, but when he rants about the 
dangers these mutants pose, he's onto something - there are good mutants 
and bad mutants, but even the good ones are capable of some pretty 
horrendous destruction.  And as for the bad ones, well, you don't want 
to know. </P>
<P>     Still, this is rousing, crisply done stuff for a summer action 
blockbuster.  It boasts a top director (Bryan Singer, The Usual 
Suspects), and a fine cast led by intense newcomer Hugh Jackman 
(Wolverine, who seems less a mutant than a victim of fiendish science) 
along with British veterans Patrick Stewart (Dr. Xavier, leader of the 
can't-we-get-along mutants) and Ian McKellan (Magneto, dark prince of 
the disaffected branch, who has good reason to distrust the essential 
decency of humankind.)  The Xs, by the way, include women - they're 
really X-People.  The movie has style, and emphasizes character as well 
as special effects, which makes a nice balance.  Ultimately it turns out 
to have nowhere to go, and halfheartedly mutates into the final credits. 
 But of course it does have someplace to go: a promising future of 
mutant sequels. </P>
