<P>   If you are a reluctant public speaker, you are advised by a
recent study to avoid having your fans in the audience.
Mothers, dads, sweetheart and all others who might be
rooting for you could disrupt your talk.  You're better off
speaking to a bunch of strangers who have no particular
opinion of your merit.  Sounds strange?  The explanation is
that you will be especially nervous in front of your devotees
for fear of letting them down.  Could we stretch this concept a
bit and apply it to medicine?  Sure.  If you are performing life-
threatening surgery on a member of your own family, you
may be particularly jittery, since a mistake could cost you
someone you hold dear.  In other words, it's best for doctors
not to be emotionally involved with the patients they are
treating.  Some physicians, though, go to the other extreme
and are absolute cold fish.  You want the best that
technology has to offer if you're in the hospital, but you also
want human beings to treat you as a person and not just as a
disease.  "I'm wheeling in the appendix from room 303," just
doesn't cut it, so to speak.</P>
<P>   Now, "Patch Adams" is about a physician who  violates the
rule against emotional involvement, an infraction which brings
him in conflict with the administrator of a hospital and dean of
his medical school.  By the conclusion of the film he has
gained the enthusiastic approval of everyone else--the girl of
his dreams who was repelled by him at first meeting,
the roommate who challenged his way of thinking, the kids in
the cancer ward, the nurses who pretty much said "let
Patch be Patch," even the head of a medical disciplinary
board that considered expelling him from school.  Patch
Adams is probably going to be your hero, especially if you've
ever gone to the typical full-of-himself, godlike doctor who
may hardly make eye contact with you or call you by name or
refer to you by anything except a case.  He clowns around
wildly with the deadly sick kids, using an enema bulb to make
a red nose; he insists that a diabetic being studied by a group
of medical students be called by her name and not "the
diabetic," when making the round he wears shirts that
Hawaiians would consider loud.  He's a genuine human
being. But alas, he's not the sort of guy you'd want for your
own physician.  While he pricks the pretensions of the
pompous practitioners, he goes to the other extreme instead
of finding the golden mean.  You want your professional to be
highly sympathetic, even get somewhat emotionally involved
with you and your background.  But for laughter, you'd best
do what the late editor of Saturday Review magazine,
Norman Cousin, did when he was hospitalized with a fatal
illness.  Rent Charlie Chaplin movies, look at the Marx
Brothers, laugh laugh laugh.  But you don't want your doctor
wear a Pinocchio nose or an enema bulb, do you?</P>
<P>   Though Patch Adams may not be your cup of curative
chicken soup, the movie, which is based on an actual person,
is involving and emotionally fulfilling, if quite a bit over-
sentimental.  Conventionally directed like a TV story by Tom
Shadyac and based on Hunter Doherty Adams's own story,
"Patch Adams" begins in 1969 when Adams voluntary checks
himself into a psychiatric hospital, a suicidal wreck.  There he
discovers that he has the gift to reach his fellow patients,
something the head psychiatrist is unable to do since the
latter does not even look his clients in the eye.  ("You suck at
helping people," Patch says, even though the year is 1969.) 
Though middle-aged, he decides at that point that he wants
to help people and, with the aid of his brilliant mind, is able to
enroll in medical school and attain super grades with a
minimum of studying.  He falls in love with one of the few
women in the class (the adorable Monica Potter who looks
about twenty years his junior) and with the help of an
empathetic classmate, Truman Schiff (Daniel London), he
converts that ultra-serious student to his philosophy.  His
ideology can be summed up, "You treat a disease, you win
you lose...you treat a patient and I guarantee you'll win."</P>
<P>   Much of the film is taken up shtick performed by the title
character, played wonderfully and with sincerity by Robin
Williams, who has sprung back from his role in the disastrous
"What Dreams May Come."  As Adams, Mr. Williams finds
that he can draw laughter from people of all walks of life and
ages, as he demonstrates in speaking to a convention of
meat packers where he jokes, "In New Zealand they found a
new use for sheep...wool."  As the school's dean, Bob
Gunton is appropriately villainous, a man whose serious
stature is threatened by this great bag of fun.  Their
personality clash leads to Adams's near dismissal from the
school for violating just about every rule of proper behavior in
the book, but Adams brings out the humanity of other
doctors, such as one played by Josef Sommer (who is, by the
way, exactly the sort of physician I would like to have
rather than Adams) and the head honcho played by Harve
Presnell.</P>
<P>   The major drawback of the work is its conventional story-
telling, not too different in structure from what you might see
on the tube.  But given the hostility that so many people have
against the presumptuousness of the medical profession on
whom we all depend so much, you will be drawn to Robin
Williams's temperament however much you may find it
excessively good-natured and whimsical.  After all, his 
character did ultimately establish a large, free clinic for
uninsured patients called the Gesundheit Hospital on 105
acres of countryside.  "Patch Adams" should have been
released years ago where it could have served as effective
advertising for the Clinton medical plan.</P>
