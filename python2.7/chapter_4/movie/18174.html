<P>Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review:</P>
<PRE>THE ODD COUPLE II</PRE>
<P>Grumpy Old Men, it ain't.  Hell, My Fellow Americans, it ain't.</P>
<P>Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon team up again for an even more worn out
vehicle than any of their films over the past few years.  Odd Couple II
feels terribly generic, where in the first movie, made thirty one years
ago, feels like a wonderful tale.  That's like repackaging Campbell's
Soup in a generic food can, really.</P>
<P>How writer Neil Simon could've made such a horrible mistake in screen
writing is beyond me.  Throughout the movie, I really didn't laugh once.
Honestly.  I mean, there were dumb situations, yeah, like the cropduster
who let these old geezers have it without any notice, but they just
really didn't seem funny to me.  And that car rolling off the cliff?
The only way I would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it.</P>
<P>And the ending gets all super-mushy, too.  In the final twenty minutes
or so, Lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one, then loses her; Matthau
talks to his son (a wasted Jonathan Silverman) about his amrriage to
Lemmon's daughter; and, of course, Lemmon and Matthau have another
roomie situation on their hands.  Ooh, I really gave a lot away there,
I'm sure.  Consider it a hospitable gester, you won't waste your time
renting this muck.</P>
