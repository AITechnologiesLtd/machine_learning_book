<PRE>³ Stigmata ³          *</PRE>
<P>     I missed a 1 o¹clock for ³Stir of Echoes² by six minutes
and, not being one to miss a second of the movie-going
experience -- I¹m talking lights dimming, previews, even that
THX thing with the cows (m¹I psycho, or what) -- I caught a 1:15
of this film, instead.  Mistake.</P>
<P>Produced with an MTV-eye, ³Stigmata² is all photography
direction.  The story, next to impossible to concentrate on one
second to the next because the film¹s visual style is so abrasive,
follows Atheist hairdresser Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette) as
she becomes ³afflicted² with the titular phenomena.  Meaning, wounds
of Christ; receive five, and you die.  So, the film is more or less
a countdown to her death.  Well.. why is this happening?  As a
form of extreme punishment on a non-believer, or a method of _making_
them believe?  Dunno.  Either way, that¹s not entertaining, it¹s
depressing.  We get loving shots of large nails being hammered into
feet and hands, over and over again;  divine imagery, right?  If it
isn¹t Arquette getting slashed or impaled, it¹s blood dripping into
water, water dripping into water (Frankie¹s apartment has a
convenient leak), or rain -- everything in annoying close-up.  Tip:
try to make everything look cool (microwaves, candles, coffee
cups, more candles.. did I mention water), and nothing does.</P>
<P>As for the gore, I wonder how a movie like this one skirts
the NC-17 rating.  One scene, featuring an open wound on Arquette¹s
wrist that gushes blood so profusely for, like, five seconds, or
thereabouts, made me nauseous.  That, plus images of carnage
scattered throughout at what seemed like two-minute intervals;
where¹s the line?  A minute¹s worth of sex in greater cinema like
³Eyes Wide Shut² is too obscene for mass audiences, but 100
minutes of bloodshed here isn¹t?  Oy... the hypocrisy continues.</P>
<P>If anything, I enjoyed Gabriel Byrne¹s performance as the
priest/scientist/whatever the hell he¹s supposed to be.  He¹s got
a couple reaction takes, off the possessed Frankie, that felt
natural.  Of course, then they get all doe-eyed toward one another,
and flirty, and talk about how he misses sex, and drink beer:  how
is there time for this?  He¹s supposed to be a man of the cloth,
what would she see in a -- nevermind.</P>
<PRE>Bad movie.</PRE>
<PRE>     Best line(s):  ³It only bleeds when I touch it.²</PRE>
<PRE>            ³Then, don¹t touch it.²</PRE>
