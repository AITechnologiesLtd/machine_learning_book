<PRE>                            WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING
                                 [Spoilers]
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1995 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<P>     Although it won the Best Screenplay Award at the Los Angeles Gay
and Lesbian Film Festival, WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING ultimately proves that
a woman (in this case writer/director  Patricia Rozema) can make a film
as badly as any man.  The film is *so* bad, in fact that its high camp
watermark might make it a candidate for the next BAD MOVIES WE LOVE
book.  Rozema makes quite a departure from her earlier, brilliant I'VE
HEARD THE MERMAIDS SINGING, and turns in a tepid, softcore epic worthy
of Zalman King (RED SHOES DIARY).</P>
<P>     While the Canadian location is never specified, we suspect it's a
few miles from LAKE CONSEQUENCE, due to truck-sized plot holes and
missing character bone structure.  Rozema has taken a paint-by-numbers
approach to lesbian romantic adventure: take two disparate, but exotic
women from different worlds (in this case, the Circus and a seminary),
give one of them a beautiful but boorish man to choose from, and have a
crises to make one of them emotionally vulnerable.  Also have one of
the women be incredibly brazen in her pursuit of the indecisive
beginner.  Preferably, make the romance interracial or cross-cultural
(Rozema does both).</P>
<P>     In this case we have Camilla (Pascal Bussires), a stone-faced
Isabelle Hubert wanna-be who teaches mythology in a strict Protestant
seminary.  She's emotionally distraught from hiding her passionate
affair with fellow faculty member, Martin (a throw-away performance by
Henry Czerny, the evil woofcake of BOYS OF ST. VINCENT).  We know that
she's really torn over the conflict between her religious convictions
and pre-wedlock sex, because she's sends him to work with a sloppy kiss
on the doorstep, wearing only his pajama tops!  (Focus, Camilla,
focus!)</P>
<P>     Camilla's emotional vulnerability is heightened by her dog, who
mysteriously bounds out of her office and dies in an alley-way, with no
evident sign of injury.  The distraught Camilla installs the pooch in
her Frigidaire, then heads to the laundromat for relief.  A chance
encounter there with the exotic Petra (Rachel Crawford) leads Camilla
into new territory.  Petra is a circus acrobat!  Knowing a good thing
when she sees it, Petra pulls a switcheroo on the laundry so Camilla
will have to track her down at the weird warehouse Circus where she
performs exotic dances.</P>
<P>     Camilla's first glimpse of Petra in her "other world" of the
circus is when Petra steps out of a silhouette against a drumskin to
reveal shes done up in a skin-tight leather jump suit, with pilot
goggles like Rocky the flying squirrel.  (Who could possibly resist
that?)  Petra also has one of the best lesbian pick-up lines of all
time, "Camilla!  I like that name, it sounds like "Come here.'"</P>
<P>     Zalman King dished up a Chinese steambath for Joan Severance and
Billy Zane to do the nasty in at LAKE CONSEQUENCE.  Rozema creates a
never-never circus world with disco lights on the ceiling, and interior
decorating in Petra's trailer that would make Andy Warhol swoon!  (Just
how much they pay you to perform in a Canadian circus).</P>
<P>     Over-the-top background characters are used to make Camilla's and
Petra's lack of motivation more believable.  The circus is run by kooky
but lovable Tim (Don McKeller with an accent he picked up somewhere
between Transylvania and Detroit) and streetwise Tory (Tracy Wright).
In one of their many altercations, Tory is accusing Tim of being
incompetent.  "Oh, yeah," shoots back Tim, "what about that raccoon act
you did!" Tory pauses and sighs, "How could I know they'd be so
selfish!"  Sure, it doesn't make sense, but neither do any of the major
plot points.</P>
<P>     Softcore flicks with woman-on-woman action aimed at straights
usually have a musical key to alert viewers that something is about to
happen.  In NIGHT IS FALLING, an irritating cello solo begins sawing
away whenever these gals are ready to shed their clothes and have at
it.  The love scenes are interspersed with a pseudo Cirque d'Soleil
trapeze act between two women to symbolize the dangerous balance they're
in.  (The speechless high-wire artists prove much more interesting than
the two main characters).</P>
<P>     The rest of the plot doesn't much matter, as it offers few
surprises.  Lighting, pace and tone for each scenes comes straight from
Zalman King.  Rozema pays a nod to PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT with
a ludicrous surprise as the credits roll.  (Remember the Judy Doll/kite
landing in the Japanese monastery?)  Camilla has buried her beloved dog
in a pile of soap flakes (uh, snow!) before trying to do herself in.
After being revived by her beloved, Camilla head towards the
international Circus Festival in San Francisco with Petra.  We see a
paw emerge from the snow ... and voila!  The pooch bounds, resurrected,
across the snowy landscape, (in slow motion of course).  It's an
appropriate ending for a film that is a dog, in every sense of the
word.  We can only assume that like River Phoenix in MY OWN PRIVATE
IDAHO, the dog was a victim of narcolepsy.  Or maybe he tried to make
it through the script.</P>
<P>     Viewers wanting answers to missing character motivation and more
can meet Screenwriter/Director Patricia Rozema when her film screens at
the Mill Valley Festival on Saturday, October 14 at 10 PM, in the
Sequoia II theater in Mill Valley.  Contact BASS for ticket info.</P>
