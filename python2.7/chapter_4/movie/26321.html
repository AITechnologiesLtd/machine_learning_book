THE REMAINS OF THE DAY
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>One of the most common complaints against producer Ismail
Merchant and director James Ivory is that their films look
the same. Actually, phrase "Merchant-Ivory film" began to
enter dictionaries as description for "adaptation of
Victorian or Edwardian novel about socially repressed
stiff-upper-lip middle or upper class Englishmen". However,
every now and then Merchant and Ivory make the film that
strays from that formula. One of such occasions was THE
REMAINS OF THE DAY, 1993 adaptation of novel by Japanese
writer Kazuo Ishiguro, set in England during the last
decades of British Empire.</P>
<P>The screenplay was written by Merchant-Ivory's long time
associate Ruth Prawer Jabhvala. Film begins in 1958 when
luxurious country manour called Darlington Hall gets sold to
American congressman Lewis (played by Christopher Reeve).
Lewis has spent some time in the manour before WW2, so he
wants to gather as many of the original staff as possible.
One members of the staff is long-time butler Stevens (played
by Anthony Hopkins), who begins travelling England in search
of his former co-workers. During the travel he remembers
pre-war days in Darlington Hall, when he was employed by the
Lord Darlington (played by James Fox), politically
well-connected aristocrat with pro-German sympathies which
grew stronger with incoming world conflict. Stevens, same as
his old father (played by Peter Vaughn) was the man
completely dedicated to his duty towards his master, and
nothing outside his small world mattered to him, not even
the increasing numbers of men in black shirt who began
arriving to the estate. When new housekeeper Miss Kenton
(played by Emma Thompson) arrived in Darlington, her rather
different temperament and worldview caused initial friction
with Stevens. But two of them gradually develop love for
each other, but Stevens was bound by tradition and unable to
express his feelings.</P>
<P>According to the old saying, the best love stories are those
about unrequited, impossible or unhappy love. THE REMAINS OF
THE DAY, one of the most melancholic films made recently,
perfectly fits this description. To make the tragedy even
less bearable, the love in this film was present but never
consumed. However, Jhabvala and Ivory weren't satisfied by
making this film as simple melodrama about love squashed by
societal pressures. They actually took great pains in order
to describe and represent such pressures, making THE REMAINS
OF THE DAY into film which is both melodrama and
sociological study. Ivory paints both fascinating and
utterly bleak picture of men who are trained all their life
to supress their feelings and most natural desires for the
utterly pointless and worthless ideal of "duty". In doing
so, Ivory employs same subtlety and stiff-upper-lip
philosophy of his protagonists. So, the inner life of the
protagonists is never explicitly portrayed and instead we
receive only hints in order to reconstruct the drama
afterwards. This slow approach turns very effective in few
scenes that feature protagonists who allow feelings to
manifest through simple but powerful gestures.</P>
<P>This approach was perfect for Anthony Hopkins, whose role of
emotionally repressed butler shares some resemblance with
his best known performance in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Hopkins
plays Stevens as a character who almost never changes the
expression of his face or the tone of his voice, but small
gestures instead can speak volumes. Such strong performance
is also given by Emma Thompson as a woman who looks like his
emotional opposite yet nevertheless succumbs to the same
societal pressures. Two of them managed to overshadow
everyone, including James Fox as their pompous aristocratic
master, alienated from the outside world.</P>
<P>Nostalgic and melancholic feeling of the film is somewhat
compromised with the filmmaker's need to put this powerful
intimate drama into historical background. So, THE REMAINS
OF THE DAY receive another, political dimension. Through the
character of Lord Darlington, British aristocrat alienated
from real world, Ishiguro, Jhabvala and Ivory try to explain
reasons which led Britain to pre-WW2 appeasament policy
towards Hitler. In their opinion, government was dominated
by aristocrats, conservative and totally alienated from the
real world and thus more than willing to accept any option
that would guarantee their rigid class privileges - and
Nazism was exactly such option. Lord Darlington is presented
as one of such fools, whose initially innocent Germanophilia
later develops into full-blown Nazism, including racial
purification of his staff. Naturally, such people wouldn't
have anything against Hitler taking over Europe and their
influence on British government explains betrayal of
Czehoslovakia in Munich 1938 - diplomatic disaster which
practically made WW2 inevitable one year later. This view,
although rather popular among amateur historians, is not
quite correct. British appeasament of Hitler in late 1930s
was motivated more with pragmatic than ideological reasons -
British and French governments were impressed with the speed
and scope of German pre-war re-armament and with their
militaries lagging behind, appeasement was seen as buying
time for re-armament of their own. Also, appeasament wasn't
only advocated by aristocrats - majority of population of
Western democracies prefered to sacrifice some unknown
countries in Eastern Europe in order to avoid going back to
trenches.</P>
<P>THE REMAINS OF THE DAY perhaps owe this political dimension
to the times when they were made. In 1993 world's media was
still bombarded with images of war-torn Bosnia and many
comentators criticised British and French policy of
appeasing Milosevic, drawing parallels to 1930s and Hitler.
Jhabvala and Ivory offer alternative to this suicidal and
morally bankrupt policy in the form of American congressman
who, same as his country in 1990s, favours tough
uncompromising line against world thugs. This is probably
the weakest part of the film, since it is not historically
accurate. USA in 1930s were more concerned with problems of
Great Depression and increasingly isolationistic, with
government and public even less likely to meddle into
European affairs. Without that uncessary excursion into
pre-WW2 politics and with authors completely concentrated on
more down-to-earth drama, THE REMAINS OF THE DAY could have
became true masterpiece. However, even this less than
perfect film might be more than satisfying to the fans of
period melodramas.</P>
