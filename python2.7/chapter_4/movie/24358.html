<P>   There's nothing wrong with a sitcom, with its predictable,
credibility-challenging plot, provided that the characters are
vibrant and likeable and the writer's heart is in the right
place.  That's just the kind of TV-type comedy that
"Luminarias" provides.  Directed by Jose Luis Valenzuela,
"Luminarias" had its birth as a staged play by the director's
real-life wife, Evelina Fernandez, which the playwright--who
radiates a spirited performance as its lead character--has
successfully opened up for the big screen.  Despite its mere
one million-dollar budget," Luminarias" is the sort of picture
that could make a grand showing in Latino communities
throughout the U.S. and given its easy-listening format
should draw a reasonable crossover audience as well.</P>
<P>   Though the story bears some resemblance to Forest
Whitaker's "Waiting To Exhale," which displayed Whitney
Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon
auspiciously despite that movie's redundant plot, Valenzuela's
film deals with men who are not all jerks.  What's more
important, serious racial issues are discussed in some depth. 
While the characters in "Waiting to Exhale" are all black, this
time we're treated to a Jesse-Jackson rainbow involving
Koreans, Korean-Americans, Mexican-Americans, one
Jewish-American, and one African-American, all jumbled
together in an East Los Angeles nexus.  The focus is on four
well-to-do, professional Mexican-American women who get
together regularly in an Angeleno restaurant known as
Luminarias to discuss the men in their lives.  They drink
margueritas and tequilas, easing the way for the women to let
it all hang out.  We listen in on their jovial banter and serious
arguments alike, absorbing an image of the affinities and
antipathies of people we do not often get to see in the movie
theaters: prosperous Latinas living in spacious housing,
driving Mercedes and the like, and throwing lavish parties for
their families and friends.</P>
<P>   We quickly learn from their spirited restaurant banter that
these women may be of the same professional class but their
views on men and race diverge considerably.  Andrea
(Evelina Fernandez), a domestic relations lawyer in her
forties, is herself getting divorced from her wayward husband
Joe (Robert Beltran).  She is particularly incensed that Joe is
cavorting with an Anglo woman, furthering her own racist
view that the only reason whites date Latinas is to feel
superior.  Despite her wealth, she admits to having a deeply
felt rage.  Her friend Sofia (Marta DuBois), on the other hand,
is a therapist who believes in mixing in with the white society
and has forsaken her old East Los Angeles neighborhood for
the predominantly Anglo west side.  Ironically, she is the only
one of this gang of four to wind up with a Mexican man, a
waiter named Pablo (Sal Lopez) who can barely speak
English.  In smaller roles Dyana Ortelli plays Irene, a
flamboyant clothing designer who is ashamed of her
transvestite brother (Geoffrey Rivas) and who has sworn off
sex for the Lenten season, while Angela Moya performs in
the role of Lilly, an artist who is dating a Korean man, Lu
(Andrew C. Lim). </P>
<P>  The one subplot that does not mesh with the buoyant tone
of the rest of the story involves Cindy (Seidy Lopez), in a
custody battle with the physically abusive ex-husband, Tony
(Richard Coca).  But as the hub of the story, Scott Bakula
turns out a credible performance as Joseph, a lawyer who
finds himself opposing Andrea in court.  Drawn to his
adversary, Joseph is at first rebuffed by Andrea not only
because he is fighting against the interests of her client but
more important because he is white and Jewish.  Struggling
with her own racist attitudes toward Anglos, Andrea is frank
and cutting as she challenges Joseph to come up with the
real reason he is interested in a woman who is not of his race
and religion.  As in most romantic comedies, their differences
keep them apart until the movie's conclusion in which
Valenzuela wraps up all the loose ends too conveniently for a
tale which seeks to elevate itself above sit-comish fare.</P>
<P>   The music is terrific though not intrusive and the upbeat
tempo of this good-hearted and spirited comedy makes
"Luminarias" easy to take as social commentary that deals
with themes of identity, marriage and independence. This is
one of those rare pictures that do not treat Spanish-speaking
Americans as either gangsters or servants but as people who
have prospered in a multi-cultural society that all too often
patronizes and demeans even those non-whites who have
lived in the U.S. for generations.</P>
