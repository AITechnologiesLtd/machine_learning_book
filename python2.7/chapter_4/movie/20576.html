<P>     My brother says I shouldn't review sports movies.  Because I'm not
a sports fan, he says, I can't be objective.</P>
<P>     He may have a point, but I don't think FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is
fundamentally a sports movie.  Sure, suit Kevin Costner up in a baseball
uniform and you might think you're looking at another FIELD OF DREAMS,
but FOR LOVE OF THE GAME is something we don't see a lot of.  Allow me
to explain.</P>
<P>     On the last day of a losing baseball season, veteran Detroit Tigers
pitcher Billy Chapel (Costner) gets the news that he's going to be
traded *and* that his girlfriend is ditching him to move to London.  The
information devastates Chapel, so he decides to take it out on the
baseball diamond, steeling himself up for the game of his life.</P>
<P>     Before you know it, we're watching Chapel edge closer and closer to
the near-impossible perfect game:  9 innings, 27 batters, no hits, no
walks, no men on base.  And while Chapel struggles inning after inning –
against the Yankees, against the coach, against his aching body and mind
– he relives the last five years of his life through flashback.</P>
<P>     The flashbacks include the meeting of his on-again off-again
girlfriend Jane (Preston), befriending her daughter (Malone), his ups
and downs with his old buddy and standby catcher Gus (Reilly), getting
injured, getting better, and basically living the life of an aging
ballplayer.</P>
<P>     Back at game time, Chapel realizes he's made some mistakes, and
this final match becomes a shot at redemption.  Everyone watching the
game somehow seems to realize this, and through those nine innings, all
lives are invariably altered.</P>
<P>     If it sounds like a powerful film, that's because it is.  Director
Raimi is a master at pulling strings, and no expense has been spared at
coaxing the tears out of you.  All the players are perfectly suited for
their roles, with special marks for Reilly and Costner, who gives his
best performance since JFK in 1991.</P>
<P>     But it isn't too far into FOR LOVE OF THE GAME that you start to
realize a couple of things.  First, that the baseball game is far more
dramatic and interesting than the flashbacks.  (The film is obviously
adapted from a novel, and sometimes it feels like the flashback pages
are being shot verbatim.)  Second, that the whole thing is a ploy to
manipulate you into getting over-emotional.  There are points when you
want to spit, the movie is so saccharine.</P>
<P>     But this GAME is just so compelling, it's hard not to put those
flaws aside and just let yourself be washed over by this movie.  I may
be a victim of Hollywood mind games, but at least I enjoyed myself.</P>
