<P>     When it comes to spoofs of horror films, one of the greatest of all 
time is surely Mel Brooks' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, a movie that's as clever 
as it is funny.  Now, more than two decades later, Brooks has attempted 
to re-create the magic by doing to Bram Stoker's vampire legend what he 
did in 1974 to Mary Shelly's gothic tale.  Alas, DRACULA: DEAD AND 
LOVING IT doesn't come close to the level attained by YOUNG 
FRANKENSTEIN.  It's a toothless parody that misses more often than it 
hits.</P>
<P>     Maybe one of the problems is that there have been so many attempts 
to lampoon vampires.  A few, like George Hamilton's LOVE AT FIRST BITE, 
have been genuinely funny.  However, most, like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER 
and VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN, have failed.  With DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, 
Brooks is far from virgin territory.  Some of his jokes here have been 
used before, and, even for the good ones, familiarity mutes laughter.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, however, DRACULA is infected with the same disease that 
has plagued the last several Brooks films -- it's just not all that 
funny.  Sure, there are humorous bits here and there throughout the 
running length, but not enough to justify an entire movie.  DRACULA: 
DEAD AND LOVING IT sputters as badly (or worse) than ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN 
TIGHTS, LIFE STINKS, and SPACEBALLS, to name a few.  Whatever 
inspiration stirred Brooks to make YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has long since 
deserted him.  </P>
<P>     The storyline of DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is an amalgamation of 
all the various screen incarnations of Stoker's tale.  English 
businessman Renfield (Peter MacNicol) travels to Transylvania to meet 
with the mysterious Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen).  While staying at 
the count's castle, Renfield falls under Dracula's spell.  Together, the 
two travel to England, where Dracula begins his reign of terror by 
draining the blood of two lovely women:  Lucy (Lysette Anthony) and Mina 
(Amy Yasbeck).  When Lucy's health fails, her guardian, Dr. Seward 
(Harvey Korman), and his assistant, Jonathan Harker (Steven Weber), call 
in the strange-but-brilliant Professor Van Helsing (Mel Brooks) to 
unmask the fiend.</P>
<P>     Given the comic turn his career has taken since the early '80s, 
it's hard to believe that Leslie Nielsen was once a serious actor.  
These days, thanks to the Zucker brothers (AIRPLANE, THE NAKED GUN), he 
has become an accomplished satirical performer.  His sense of timing is 
impeccable, and this asset has made him a sought-after commodity for a 
wide variety of spoofs.  Here, Nielsen takes on the title role, but his 
presence can't resurrect this stillborn lampoon.</P>
<P>     Unless you're a die hard Mel Brooks fan (are there any of them 
left?), there's no compelling reason to sit through DRACULA: DEAD AND 
LOVING IT.  The sporadic humor promises some laughs, but the ninety 
minutes will go by slowly.  The general failure of this movie leads to 
one obvious question:  why couldn't Brooks just leave Dracula dead and 
buried?</P>
