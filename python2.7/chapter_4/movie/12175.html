<P>     THE BIG HIT exhibits many of the same characteristics as the most 
over-the-top entries into the Hong Kong action/comedy genre, which 
shouldn't come as a surprise considering that the director (Che-Kirk 
Wong) and executive producer (John Woo) made their reputations overseas 
on those kinds of films.  THE BIG HIT is as irreverent as parodies come, 
and exhibits a great deal more energy than the tired, pun-filled NAKED 
GUN clones.  This movie isn't afraid of venturing into the realm of bad 
taste -- in fact, it revels in it.  There's sure to be something in THE 
BIG HIT to offend just about everyone, but the film is audacious enough 
that I found myself gaining sporadic entertainment from its cheerful, 
cartoonish spoofing.</P>
<P>     THE BIG HIT's lead character is the improbably named Melvin Smiley 
(Mark Wahlberg, last seen wearing a prosthesis in BOOGIE NIGHTS).  He's 
a hit man who has killed about 100 people, but is afflicted with an 
undesirable weakness for someone in his position:  "I can't stand the 
idea of anybody not liking me."  Melvin has a complicated personal life 
-- he is engaged to be married to a ditzy blond (Christina Applegate) 
and has a black girlfriend (Lela Rochon) on the side.  Their financial 
demands have put him in debt, so he joins his buddies, Cisco (Lou 
Diamond Phillips), Crunch (Bokeem Woodbine), Gump (Robert Dunne), and 
Vinnie (Antonio Sabato Jr.), in a kidnapping scheme.  They snatch Keiko 
(China Chow), the pretty college-age daughter of a bankrupt Japanese 
businessman (Sab Shimono).  Unfortunately, she also happens to be the 
goddaughter of crime lord Paris (Avery Brooks), Cisco and Melvin's boss.  
To save himself, Cisco turns against the rest of the gang, going after 
them one-by-one.  Meanwhile, Keiko and the sensitive Melvin fall in love 
and plan to run away together.</P>
<P>     The plot is ludicrous and the acting falls neatly into one of two 
categories:  way over-the-top or simply awful.  Mark Wahlberg is badly 
miscast as Melvin.  His rather bland portrayal of the hitman fails to 
energize certain comic scenes that should have been funnier.  Lou 
Diamond Phillips is the perfect villain for an overblown movie:  it 
looks like he took lessons on scenery-chewing from either Dennis Hopper 
or Gary Oldman.  Christina Applegate, Lainie Kazan, and Elliot Gould are 
all irritatingly bad, but I believe that's actually the point.  I don't 
think the film makers had Oscar nominations in mind when they cast these 
three.  Newcomer China Chow is the only one who shows any promise, and 
that's not saying much.  </P>
<P>     THE BIG HIT's comedy is widely variable -- some of it is funny and 
clever while some is weary and familiar.  During the course of the 
movie's 90 minute running time, THE BIG HIT gives us ethnic caricatures, 
tremendously over-the-top car chases, and jokes involving vomit, 
mutilated body parts, masturbation, hara-kiri, video store clerks, high-
tech call tracing methods, chicken stuffing, and KING KONG LIVES 
(arguably one of the worst movies of all time).  How often you laugh is 
likely dependent upon a few factors:  your mood, your tolerance for 
humor in bad taste, and your willingness to ignore Wahlberg's wooden 
performance and lack of chemistry with his female co-stars.  </P>
<P>     Wong directs THE BIG HIT with more flair than the material perhaps 
deserves.  This is a colorful, kinetic motion picture that never 
threatens to bore even a viewer afflicted with attention deficit 
disorder.  There are a lot of shoot-outs and other action sequences, 
and, while none of them are suspenseful or thrilling, they're suitably 
noisy.  I viewed most of these as takeoffs on more generic testosterone-
and-adrenaline sequences, and, seen on that level, they work.  The film 
also has some fun showing (via instant replay) the way people in action 
movies live through unsurvivable situations.  The less seriously one 
takes things, the better they work.  As low-intelligence entertainment 
goes, this film is very much a hit-and-miss affair.</P>
