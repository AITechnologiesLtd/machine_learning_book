<P>_Teaching_Mrs._Tingle_ (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Once upon a time, there was a 10th grade English class run by one Mr.
Jerry Stover, a teacher who was a pain to (with a few exceptions) all of
his students but made an extra effort to continually tear down one
student in particular.  This usually strong English student found all of
his best efforts met with indifference at best, outright derision at
worst by Stover, who often seized every opportunity to humiliate the
student in front of the whole class.  When called on to do an oral report
on a reading assignment, the student only got about two words in before
Stover criticized his barely-begun report and asked him to sit down.  But
that was nothing compared to what came at the end of the school year,
when the student's year-ending speech project--which was capped off with
a spirited song number that was wholeheartedly embraced and warmly
praised by his classmates--was verbally torn to shreds by Stover in front
of everyone.  That public attack was just a warm-up for a comment Stover
made during a subsequent private meeting with the student: "I don't like
you."</P>
<P>As you can guess, the student in question was yours truly, and while it
did take some added effort--and, I'd like to think, guilt on Stover's
part--to get an A in that class, I didn't have to resort to anything
resembling the over-the-top antics presented in hot scribe Kevin
Williamson's directorial debut, _Teaching_Mrs._Tingle_.  My own
experiences undoubtedly contributed to my enjoyment of this admittedly
junky but wickedly watchable revenge fantasy.  I immediately identified
with the film's protagonist, solid A student Leigh Ann Watson (Katie
Holmes), who, in an early scene, presents a much-worked-on project in her
history class, only to have her presentation abruptly cut short by
vicious barbs hurled by the class's instructor, Mrs. Eve Tingle (Helen
Mirren).  This scene (and the entire film, for that matter) has been
criticized for being grossly exaggerated, and indeed it is, to biting
comic effect.  But there is a ring of truth--not just for me personally,
who knows it is possible for teachers to have unfounded personal grudges
against students; but I'm sure for many other people who have had
similar, if not overly so, trying experiences with hardass teachers.</P>
<P>Williamson sends all basis in reality out the window, however, when the
film's main story kicks into gear.  After Mrs. Tingle falsely accuses
Leigh Ann of cheating, she and her friends Luke Churner (Barry Watson)
and Jo Lynn Jordan (Marisa Coughlan) confront Mrs. Tingle at her home. 
One thing leads to another, and soon Mrs. Tingle is tied to her bed, held
prisoner by the three students, who try to reason with her--and teach her
an overdue lesson or two.  The stage is set for a tense and witty
psychological battle between the teens and Tingle, who is as adept at
manipulative mind games as she is mean.</P>
<P>For a first-time director, Williamson shows great skill working with
actors.  While Watson is fairly bland as the hunky bad boy, he does share
palpable chemistry with the other core three, who make good impressions. 
Holmes is an instantly likable screen presence, and her calm and poise
grounds the film in some level of reality and plays well off of newcomer
Coughlan, who has the showier role as the kooky aspiring actress Jo Lynn.
 The showiest role of them all, of course, is the title character, and
Serious Actress Mirren sinks her teeth and then some into this
change-of-pace part.  Her venomous performance has been criticized as
being one-dimensional, but the point of the part is to be an
over-the-top, love-to-hate villain, and does she ever succeed at that.</P>
<P>That said, one does wish there were more of an explanation of Tingle's
wicked ways, or at least a clearer one for her malice toward Leigh Ann;
it is implied that she is jealous of her ability and bright prospects,
but the implication is a bit too vaguely made and not altogether
confirmed.  (After all, Mrs. Tingle does have one bright pet student.) 
_Tingle_ was the first script Williamson ever wrote, and it is indeed the
least polished of his heretofore produced works, and his inexperience in
the director's chair doesn't serve the more awkward moments well.  There
are a couple of scenes that establish Leigh Ann's warm relationship with
her mother (Lesley Ann Warren) that are not only ridiculously saccharine,
but feel completely out of place in what is otherwise a gleefully
heartless film.  A bit more in line with the tone is Jo Lynn's hyper
reenactment of scenes from _The_Exorcist_, and while it is good for a
chuckle, the scene is a showstopper of the worst kind, a dead halt in the
action; it is also a rather obligatory movie reference, a device worked
well--and served a recognizable purpose--in Williamson's _Scream_ films
but adds nothing in this context.</P>
<P>To borrow an obvious metaphor that has been used--and will surely
continue to be used--by detractors of the film, Williamson does, in fact,
need to be taught a few more lessons on film direction.  But with
_Teaching_Mrs._Tingle_, it is evident that Williamson does possess some
natural filmmaking ability, and he has already found a distinct
voice--something that many more established filmmakers have yet to
discover.</P>
