<P>When I first heard about this comedy starring Robert DeNiro and Ben Stiller,
I was stoked. After DeNiro proved himself to be more than just a great actor
in last year's ANALYZE THIS, with a wonderful performance, and Stiller
continually solidifying himself as one of the best comedic actors of his
generation, the film could do no wrong in my eyes. But then I saw the first
trailer for the movie, and well...I won't mix words here: it wasn't very
funny. I was mortified, petrified! How could this be...DeNiro, Stiller, a
father-in-law comedy...how could it miss? But all of that anxiety quickly
dissipated as I sat to watch this film, a movie that has now become my
favorite comedy of the year. DeNiro is great in it once again, Stiller
perfect and the world is as it should be...</P>
<P>PLOT:
This is the story of young man who loves a young woman and wants to ask for
her hand in marriage. But before he does that, he believes that a meeting
with the young woman's father and asking for his approval would be a good
idea. They meet and things don't go too well. You see, the father loves his
daughter very much and isn't sure about this young man. The father is also
very good at psychological profiling...and he's quite paranoid. Let the fun
begin.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal
actors, laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences
with a believable story line. Go see this movie and laugh! See it with your
parents and join in the fun. See it with your better half and remark on the
similarities. See it with your brother, your sister, you cat for God's
sakes, most "people" should be able to identify and appreciate this film.
And even though I love toilet humor as much as the next guy, I have to admit
that it was nice to see a movie that despite some "easy" dirty jokes (one
excellent running gag was the use of the Stiller character's last name
during the entire feature, spelled f-o-c-k-e-r), relied mostly on sight
gags, physical comedy and finely tuned humorous moments. Really well-made.
And kudos to director Jay Roach who came off his one-two punch of the AUSTIN
POWERS movies with a solid underrated uppercut a la MYSTERY, ALASKA and
TKO'd it all with this.</P>
<P>And DeNiro, boy-oh-boy, what can be said about Robert DeNiro? Is there
anything that this man can't do? Another one out of the ballpark for the man
best known for his dedication to the craft of acting, with one more
extremely effective comedic performance. Wow. Now let's see Pacino take a
few shots at the game of funny! Woo-haa, indeed! But I can't top off this
review without mentioning the great work done here by the incomparable Ben
Stiller. I love this guy! I love his whole persona, his nervous twitches,
his way of being sincere, funny and serious all at the same time. I really
do believe that he is one of the more underrated comedic actors of our time
and I sincerely hope that he gets more recognition after this. The rest of
the performers were also very well cast, notably Blythe Danner as the aloof
mother and Owen Wilson, set perfectly as the stinkin' rich ex-fiancé. Gotta
love that crooked nose of his. I enjoyed this entire movie from start to
finish. It's funny when it has to be, hilarious when it needs to be and even
touching as it nears conclusion. Many memorable lines, many funny moments
with the cat (cat haters beware!) and an overall good time. Don't go in
expecting the world to bowl you over with this but do expect to be
thoroughly entertained. Thumbs way up, folks!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Robert DeNiro is currently in Montreal, Canada shooting a film called THE
SCORE directed by Frank Oz, co-starring Marlon Brando and Edward Norton. Now
I mention this not necessarily as a "little known fact", but more as a "very
cool fact". Three actors greatly admired by their respective generations
starring in a film together. Wow. Pretty gosh darn cool.
Speaking of Ed Norton, he recently made his own directorial debut with
KEEPING THE FAITH, starring the always funny, and part-time director on his
own right (remember THE CABLE GUY?), Ben Stiller.
This is actress Teri Polo's "big break" movie, but fans of the TV show
"Felicity" know her as the recurring character Maggie. She also appeared as
Rebecca on the ABC sitcom "Sports Night".
Actress Blythe Danner, the mother in this movie, is Oscar-winning actress
Gwyneth Paltrow's mom in real life.
Besides playing the "goof" in many of his recent movie parts, actor Owen
Wilson is also a pretty decent writer as well. He co-wrote two critically
acclaimed movies with writer/director Wes Anderson, BOTTLE ROCKET and
RUSHMORE. He is currently playing a male model in ZOOLANDER, a comedy
written and directed by Ben Stiller, based on a character he came up with
for the VH-1 Fashion Awards three years ago.</P>
