<P>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (director: Steven Spielberg; cast: Tom Hanks , Tom
Sizemore, Ed Burns, Adam Goldberg, Jefferies Davis, 1998)</P>
<P>An instant classic. The WW11 story of the Americans landing on bloody
Omaha Beach for D-Day. Tom is the captain on the boat telling  his
ranger troops that he'll see them on the beach. This is an old-fashioned
war story, except for the bloody graphic details of the war that is
realistically shown. The film successfully takes aim at the horrors of
war, showing how the boys we knew back home have become killers, as we
witness how the war brings about unimaginable human suffering. For the
first 30- minutes of the film you see this carnage: the men drowning in
water that is too deep for them, arms and other body parts floating by
them as their only concern is to get to the beach alive, the utter fear
and indecisiveness of the moment, and the pain of being shot at and of
being shot, is vividly photographed. This scene of unrelenting horror,
brings us as close to the war zone as we can get without being there.
The sounds you hear, that makes the talk among the men almost inaudible,
are the guns of war, just like it is in actual combat. In fact,  95% of
the first wave of men to land on the beach were either killed or
wounded. (In the first two attacks on the beach only 15 men survived out
of 5,000, which should give you an idea of how bloody the actual battle
scene was).</P>
<P>>From this zenith in filmmaking history, the story continues on its
gripping pace as we follow Hanks and the men who were lucky enough to
survive with him, as they are given the almost impossible mission of
finding a private Ryan, who is in an airborne unit that just landed on
the vast battle scene in France. They are ordered to bring him home from
the war and spare his family any more grief than what has already been
experienced with the death of all his three brothers, in recent
skirmishes. This is an assignment that they do not relish (they would
rather be fighting the war), and they bitch and gripe about it, but they
carry out their duty, which is an important sub-theme of the film. The
men did what they had to do.</P>
<P>This is not really an anti-war film as Spielberg would like us to think,
but it is more likely a film about how difficult it is to be in a war
and how necessary it is for us to fight for our freedom when called
upon, in fact, it is just like all the other war films (waving the flag
and all that sort of stuff) except for the explicit battle scenes shown
in the opening. It is a film about the citizen soldier who just wants to
survive the war, who experiences chilling things in combat that are very
difficult to put into proper prospective. It is about a country that has
been involved in recent wars that were not fully accepted by the public
and has, perhaps, forgotten how gallantly the men of the WW11 generation
fought to preserve democracy. But ultimately, this is a war movie that
is really about war and how it can be so devastating, how returning
soldiers may find it difficult to explain to those who were not there
the psychological traumas they have gone through. There is no need for a
John Wayne type in this film (Tom is Everyman! And he is just great in
this role, you can feel his moods, the fears that he has-- and his need
to do the job and go home).</P>
<P>This film can in someways be considered a masterpiece because Spielberg
knows how to do one thing really well, that is, he knows how to tell a
story visually that can reach the masses. The flaws in the movie, minor
as they might appear to some, still reflect Spielberg's need for kitsch,
and since the film does make a concerted effort for accurate details it
should be noted that Tom would have covered his captain's bars in a war
zone, and the men wouldn't have had long and loud conversations when
walking through a battle area. But the most serious transgression, which
gave me pause to think that this is the same old sentimental Spielberg
returning, is when the translator (Davis) who is new to combat, loses
his nerve in the field, and what ensues are a series of events that
seemed to be too contrived to flow with the rest of the movie, not
because soldiers don't freeze in combat as he does, but because here it
happens so conveniently that the soldier can be spotted redeeming
himself for the American audience as he kills the only unhelmeted German
soldier on the bridge, of course, that is the one that Hanks let go for
humanitarian reasons (remember in SCHINDLER'S LIST the Jewish lady in
the concentration camp with the red dress as everyone else was shot in
black and white!).</P>
<P>This is a great war film, not because it has anything different to say
than other war films did, but because it tells its story visually well,
and it does so with much gusto, as seen through the eyes of what the
soldier saw in combat. You can talk to those who were there and they
will tell you to a man, that this is the way it happened.</P>
