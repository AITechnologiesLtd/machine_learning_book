<P>_The_Next_Best_Thing_ (PG-13) no stars (out of ****)</P>
<P>Best friends may make the best mistakes, but Madonna makes the absolute
worst, at least in terms of her film career, which has been a comedy of
errors or a horrible tragedy, depending on how one looks at it.  After
the surprisingly impressive anomaly that was _Evita_ (which won her a
Golden Globe), the pop music diva is back to her infamously poor projects
and even poorer performances with _The_Next_Best_Thing_--which, as the
title states, is not the best, but it's hardly that close to it.  In
fact, this awful mess is more like the absolute worst.</P>
<P>One can understand Madonna and co-star Rupert Everett's decision to make
this film.  The two are longtime friends, and it gives them an
opportunity to work together in roles that are "like" themselves--or,
rather, how _they'd_like_ to see themselves: a witty everyman (Everett)
who just happens to be openly gay, and--more notably--a "normal" woman
(Madonna).  But, as her nearly two-decade-long stint in the spotlight has
shown, being "normal" is hardly natural for Madonna.  What is natural to
her, it seems, is that strange British-or-whatever accent this Detroit
native has adopted in recent years.  And that affected speech pattern
always gets in the way; while she does have a few uncharacteristically
relaxed moments (perhaps due to her ease with Everett), the funky accent
eventually creeps in and ruins it.</P>
<P>Then again, with one big exception, Madonna's voice has always been
grating in her screen efforts, long before she fancied herself a
foreigner.  That exception, of course, is in the entirely sung-through
_Evita_, and that's no coincidence.  Singing is something that she is
clearly comfortable with and--crucially--confident in doing, and that's
what made the difference in her justly-lauded performance.  It was not so
much the indisputable fact that she's a much better vocalist than
thespian, but that she was considerably calmer and thus more natural, not
trying so hard to prove her "acting ability."  Without a musical crutch,
however, she overcompensates--as she again does in _The_Next_Best_Thing_.</P>
<P>It must be said that there's so much deficiency in the film that one can
almost understand the need to make up for it with overkill.  In
_Next_Best_, Madonna's Abbie and Everett's Robert--two
generically-written characters--are best friends living in L.A.  Coming
off of a nasty breakup (hers) and the death of a close friend (his), the
two drown their sorrows one night and end up doing the dirty deed.  She
gets pregnant, and the two decide to raise the child (a son, named Sam)
together.  Light stuff, all done with a light touch, but so light as to
make one wonder if director John Schlesinger was ever in the room when
the film was shot.  Madonna is always clueless as an actress, so it's no
surprise that her formless, flavorless portrayal of Abbie cries out for
guidance.  The big shock is how bad the usually reliable Everett is.  His
ability to toss off bon mots is less smooth as smug, often peppered with
some ill-advised mugging and other sorts of physical gags.  The biggest
botch of all, though, is Schlesinger's, with the centerpiece night: while
the aim is not to be romantic, there should be at least some sense of
warmth and affection; these are, after all, best friends.  But there's no
tenderness, just some would-be funny instances of furniture being broken
(ha ha), glimpses of the two doing drunken dance steps, and closeups of
liquor being poured into goblets.</P>
<P>_Next_Best_ would be bad enough as a comedy; once the film flashes
forward six years, tired cute kid humor is added into the mix.  Yet for
some reason screenwriter Thomas Ropelewski, who doesn't come close to
meeting his modest initial goals, decides to aim even higher.  Abbie
meets and falls for a New York-based businessman (Benjamin Bratt,
boring), and then the film takes the left-field turn into a heavyhanded
custody battle drama.  As feared, this shift brings out the worst in
Madonna, who cannot hold her own with Everett, who is indeed a capable
dramatic actor.  But she's not the only one at a loss as to what to
do--so are Ropelewski and Schlesinger, who open up a can of worms and
then just toss it aside.  Many films use text cards to divulge the fate
of their characters, but I have never seen a film rest its entire
resolution on them.  The film fades out, with no sense of closure--or
even a sense of things coming together for a close--then states in print
how it all turns out.  What the hell?</P>
<P>There other flubs in _The_Next_Best_Thing_ (such as a line where Robert
mentions it's the 21st Century in a scene that, in the film's time frame,
should be set around 1993; or the fact that Robert's sole love interest,
a cardiologist, has no name and is rather comically listed in the closing
credits as "Cardiologist"), but to go over them would be as pointless an
exercise as the entire film is.  One should just not make a flub oneself,
and avoid this _Thing_.</P>
