<P>Amidst the brainless production of the summer season, a film with half
a brain will be noticed and praised as an epic. 'Mimic' happens to be
a fairly intelligent science fiction, wisely released along side with
the action and adventure cliches of this season.</P>
<P>In a brilliantly chilling title sequence, where behind the photographs
of the dead children and frightening insects sounds, a child is
counting to the infinite, symbolizing the dead. Slowly the story takes
shape. 'Strickler's Disease, in the face of the common cockroach, came
to New York like a thief in the night, threatening to steal an entire
generation of our children from before our eyes. Since it has proven
to be virtually immune to chemical control, a new avenue of attack had
to be discovered. A team of brilliant scientists recombined ant- and
mantis DNA to create a biological counter agent. They called it the
'Judas Breed'. These creatures are the most successful creations, that
are fit to adapt to any situation. Their breeding rate is
approximately 40 000 a year. They were designed to survive. And they
were released into the streets with one single mission: eliminate the
deadly carrier and die...Three years have passed. Susan and Peter are
now a happy couple, praying for a baby. The epidemic is completely
forgotten. Things are not so swell, however, in the dark caverns
beneath the city. A mysterious killer, called "Long John" terrorizes
the homeless in the subway system of New York. People are
disappearing. The police are unable to find him, and yet, during the
night, he can be seen, standing silently -- observing, waiting to
strike. Susan's happy existence is suddenly interrupted by two
homeless boys that collect insects for money. They offer her a new
kind of "bug" that has never previously been seen. What she discovers
is a gigantic speciment of the Judas breed. The shock comes when she
realizes that it is only an infant. You see, sometimes an insect will
evolve to mimic its predator. A fly can look like a spider. A
caterpillar can look like a snake. The Judas breed evolved to mimic
its predators -- us. These creatures can imitate us. They can
infiltrate us and they migrate. There is no telling how far they will
spread...May the the strongest survive...</P>
<P>This film is the first pleasant surprise of the season. It is
intelligent enough to be called science fiction and frightening enough
to be called a horror film. Faithful to Ridley Scott's classic
'Alien', Guillermo del Toro directs his film in the same fashion. This
is a darker and less 'family appealing' version of 'Jurassic Park'. It
tells the story about science out of control, about the cruel nature
and its ways. At the same time it's very interesting to see how nature
looks at the human species and in what way it tries to imitate it.</P>
<P>Mira Sorvino and Jeremy Northam make a fine, believable pair. And,
though a bizarre choice, Sorvino is surprisingly effective as the
brilliant scientist. The rest of the actors do their job honestly and
professionally, though not quite memorably.</P>
<P>'Mimic's centerpiece is the survival game played out between humans
and giant insects, and for its most part you'll certainly get the
adrenaline in your body flowing. The first hour is nearly
flawless. Del Toro is a true master at creating a chilling,
frightening atmosphere, that works because of the combining efforts of
an incredible team: brilliantly chilling cinematography by Dan
Laustsen, beautifully controlled, fast paced editing by Patrick
Lussier, and a magnificently sensual and yet frighteningly spooky
musical score by Marco Beltrami. Del Toro knows that what is left
unseen is more terrifying than what the camera reveals, no matter what
it is. But even when he unravels his mystery and the shadows disappear
on by one, we still are amazed because it's done so brilliantly. From
the very beginning the brilliant Del Toro captures you in his world of
pure artistic symbolism and dark poetry. The hand reaching into
darkness had me sliding down in my seat. The script features some
incredibly strange, but incredible human characters, that are anything
else but stereotypes from previous horror flicks. I liked the two
little kids who are bug collectors and know their way around the
subway system. And there's a shoeshine man's kid who clicks spoons
together in such a way that he mimics the clicking sounds of the Judas
Breed. Things appear and disappear. Mysterious entities look like one
thing and suddenly reveals itself as something else. Laustsen has done
a great job with lighting and camera placement, creating a dark,
depressive atmosphere, where the characters slowly emerge from the
shadows. Every shot and scene is filled with mystery and a sense of
indescribable danger lurking beneath. There are moments that are
frightening and interesting through the first hour of the film, the
mystery and suspense slowly builds up and is all released in the last
half hour. Although I didn't find the ending very satisfying, I still
think that this film has a lot to offer. Under Del Toro's incredible
atmosphere, there are not ver y ``Event Horizon', "The Relic", and
other films descended from 'Alien', but manages to rise above most of
its predecessors. Believe me, it will provide an intelligent horror
that is well worth your money and time. And since it is a summer
movie, it hardly needs anything else.</P>
