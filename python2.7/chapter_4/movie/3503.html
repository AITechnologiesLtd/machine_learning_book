<P>     There are about as many sublassifications in the thriller genre as 
there are TV talk show hosts.  There's the noir thriller (BLOOD SIMPLE), 
the action thriller (DIE HARD), the "cop" thriller (anything starring 
Clint Eastwood), the "twist and manipulate the audience" thriller (BASIC 
INSTINCT), the "artsy" thriller (PULP FICTION), the exploitation 
thriller (anything with Shannon Tweed), and the "nothing much happens" 
thriller.  1995's version of KISS OF DEATH (the script is based on a 
1947 screenplay) deserves placement in the last category.</P>
<P>     This is the second consecutive lackluster film delivered by 
REVERSAL OF FORTUNE director Barbet Schroeder.  Like his last effort, 
SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, KISS OF DEATH boasts an interesting cast; lush, 
atmospheric cinematography; and a hole-riddled plot.  Despite a one-
hundred minute running time, the movie fails to resolve several obvious 
hanging threads, and the climax is so weak that the only real clue that 
the credits are about to roll is a slow pull back and pan by the camera.  </P>
<P>     The film opens with Jimmy Kilmartin (David Caruso, late of NYPD 
BLUE) enjoying the rigors of everyday family life with wife Bev (Helen 
Hunt) and baby daughter Karina.  Jimmy is recently out of prison, having 
served a term for car theft, and is willing to do just about anything to 
keep on the good side of the law.  But when an old buddy, Ronnie 
(Michael Rapaport), fears for his life if he doesn't get help pulling 
off a massive car heist, Jimmy reluctantly agrees to accompany him.  Not 
unexpectedly, things go badly.  Ronnie gets away, but Jimmy is busted 
and a cop (Samuel L. Jackson) is shot in the face.  DA Frank Zioli 
(Stanley Tucci) wants to make a deal with his lone prisoner/potential 
informant, but Jimmy won't talk about the others involved and, while his 
silence earns him extra time in Sing Sing, it buys the gratitude of 
wiseguy Little Junior Brown (Nicolas Cage), a nutcase who likes beating 
people to death with his bare hands.</P>
<P>     KISS OF DEATH generally meanders, taking quite a few unnecessary 
and ultimately pointless detours.  The basic storyline probably wouldn't 
satisfy half the running time, making it necessary to find something to 
pad out the film.  The result is a great deal of running around, 
meaningless and unconvincing attempts at character and relationship 
building, and a horribly manipulative "child in jeopardy" scenario.  A 
pair of fine performances (by Helen Hunt as Jimmy's wife and Katherine 
Erbe as his babysitter) are wasted.</P>
<P>     There are the expected double-crosses and revelations, but KISS OF 
DEATH's twists are neither momentous nor surprising.  The entire film is 
rather low-key, which might be an asset if the script wasn't in need of 
at least one more rewrite.  The somber tone and New York setting recall 
Robert DeNiro's 1992 remake of NIGHT AND THE CITY, another motion 
picture that failed to live up to expectations.</P>
<P>     The acting is very much a mixed bag.  David Caruso, who gets top 
billing after leaving TV's NYPD BLUE for a "motion picture career" 
(although this is by no means his first feature role), is unspectacular, 
bringing little to a largely underdeveloped role.  Stanley Tucci is 
suitably slimy as the prototypical self-serving politician in a three-
piece suit, and Nicolas Cage (who must have put on about forty pounds of 
pure muscle for the part) is at his over-the-top, vicious best as the 
main villain.  Samuel L. Jackson, who has fashioned a reputation as one 
of today's finest actors, turns in another on-the-mark performance as a 
police officer trying to resolve conflicting emotions about his quarry.</P>
<P>     KISS OF DEATH fits in well amidst the mostly-bland crop of releases 
clogging theaters this spring.  With a theatrical trailer far better 
than the actual picture, Schroeder's film delivers little more than a 
healthy dose of disappointment.  The picture is watchable, but nothing 
about it will linger, except perhaps the feeling that, with a more 
polished script, it might have been significantly better. </P>
