<P>Susan Granger's review of 'WITHOUT LIMITS" (Warner Bros.) 
  "Running is not about winning, it's about guts...To give anything
less than your best is to sacrifice the gift," said Steve
Prefontaine. In an era where heroes are hard to find, it's no wonder
that this popular track star's story has inspired so much
interest. Prefontaine had it all:talent, charm, grace, beauty,
self-confidence, and - above all - tremendous drive. He broke every
American record between 2,000 and 10,000 metersbefore he tragically
died at the age of 24 in 1975 in a car crash. Written by Robert
Towne and Kenny Moore (a champion runner and one of Pre's closest
friends) and directed by Towne, this biopic examines the boy behind
the man, the coach behind the athlete. A mill worker's son who grew up
in a German-speaking household in Coos Bay, Oregon, Steve
Prefontaine (Billy Crudup) learned early how to run. As a kid, he
ran from kids who taunted him. As a teenager, he ran for fun and
glory. As an athlete, he ran for himself. He was a rebel, a
perpetual front-runner who refused to win a race with a mediocre
effort, saying: "When you set the pace, you control the race." At
the University of Oregon, he met the two most pivotal people in his
life: his legendary coach, Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland), and
his devoutly Catholic girl-friend, Mary Marckx (Monica Potter), who
both cooperated in the making of this movie. The story doesn't
idealize Prefontaine as a role model. On the contrary, it details
his blunt, cocky attitude, self-obsession, and anti-authoritarian
outbursts. Robert Towne hasbeen this route before with "Personal
Best," his story about women runners training for the Olympics. On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Without Limits" is an inspiring
7, examining the cool, fearless legacy of the long-distance
runner. It's a great American story.</P>
