<P>I have no personal agenda against action movies in general. If they are 
entertaining, even in a remotely campy manner, then I will not complain. God 
only knows that we should not expect much more in this digital, impersonal 
age. So "Mission: Impossible 2" hardly has much going for it except 
straightforward action scenes to dazzle and numb the brain. Incredibly, the 
film is no fun at all - a never-ending trailer for what might look like a 
cool, sleek action picture that never comes to fruition. It is vapid and 
joyless - two words that should not be associated with thrill rides. </P>
<P>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), the htoshot superspy from the original, is back, 
this time trying to prevent a bland villain, Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from 
buying the antidotes to a deadly virus. From what I gather from the plot, 
this ambitious nut hopes to gain billions by unleashing this virus upon the 
world, and since there will be millions of dying, infected people, he will 
have access to the antidote which he can sell in multitudes. Just sounds like 
another business proposition that Bill Gates should pursue. The only way to 
stop this madman is for Hunt to hire a beautiful jewel thief, Nyah Hall 
(Thandie Newton), to charm the pants off of her former love, Ambrose, so that 
the IMF team can trace his every move. Sounds like an update of Hitchcock's 
classic "Notorious" eh? And I assure you that is where the similarities end, 
since this "M:I 2" possesses not one syllable of greatness from its far 
superior inspiration. </P>
<P>In fact, this movie is one of the worst sequels in years, embodying 
absolutely nothing that made the first "Mission: Impossible" a passable 
success. It is not witty, funny, exciting or engaging at any given moment. 
For pure excitement, we have an echo of Cruise's famous suspension from a 
ceiling from the original (which echoed the caper "Topkapi"), and a tense, 
believable opening plane crash followed by Cruise dangling 2000 feet up from 
a cliff. Outside of that, director John Woo overdoes the slow-motion 
technique in his action scenes...even using this technique when Cruise and 
Newton make goo-goo eyes at each other. I felt like I was watching a 
commercial for one of those cologne ads.   </P>
<P>Cruise slums and preens with not a trace of his personality coming through - 
he sleepwalks through this movie. Thandie Newton just looks beautiful, a 
shame considering this is the same actress from "Beloved." Ving Rhames barely 
reprises his role from the original, and looks just as bored. The villains 
would barely threaten Adam Sandler. The whole film feels like a bland souffle 
- it is sour and mechanical. Woo does nothing to enliven the proceedings - he 
is on automatic air pilot with dozens of shots of motorcycles, kicks, flips 
in the air, gunfire, oh, and a dove (another Woo trademark). None of this is 
remotely close to his purely visceral and intoxicating "Face/Off." </P>
<P>Apparently, Tom Cruise fans want him to do more action-oriented/romantic 
comedy fare, and less of his exalting turns in offbeat films such as 
"Magnolia." Perhaps this was just a ride to the bank for Cruise, and now he 
can pursue more challenging roles. My recommended mission, should you choose 
to accept it, is to avoid this movie at all costs. </P>
