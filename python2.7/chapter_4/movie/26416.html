<P>   Iranian movies are often about children, given the regime's
preference for G-rated fare, but while "A Time for Drunken
Horses" centers on youngsters, Bahman Ghobadi's film is no
"White Balloon."  This is no fairy tale despite its mystical
setting in a rugged, snow-covered area on the Iran-Iraq
border but rather a tale about children that could make Oliver
Twist look like the prince in Mark Twain's "The Prince and the
Pauper."  These children who live in a large area that
embraces Iran, Iraq and Turkey known as Kurdistan have a
hardscrabble life, one that robs them of their childhood,
turning many into petty smugglers who face the constant
threat of Iraqis ambushes, land mines, and abysmal
exploitation of their labor.  What makes this Shooting Gallery
offering a bit of breakthrough cinema is that this is one of the
first movies made in the Kurdish language--which is 
comprehensible via white subtitles which often are blurred out
by the snowy background encompassing many of the scenes.</P>
<P>   Credit must be given to a man (who is to our knowledge
the only known Kurdish filmmaker) to create a story amid
difficult weather conditions about people whom he has known
all his life--peoples familiar to Americans only as the objects
of oppression by the Iraqi government of Saddam Hassan
and who are partially protected by an U.N. sponsored no-fly
zone which forbids the Iraqi Air Force from flying over
Kurdistan.  The participants in the film are from the village of
Baneh, they are non-actors mostly from the same family, and
though they lack the very basics that virtually all westerners
possess--electricity and TV for example--they are in the film
maker's opinion happy people.</P>
<P>   One can understand that this film has been received
enthusiastically in the Kurdish regions of Iran and Iraq but for
a western audience and even for a non-Kurdish Iranian
audience, the reception may not be as sanguine.  Limited in
plot and repetitious despite its brief seventy-seven minutes'
running time, "A Time for Drunken Horses" does evoke the
suffering, poverty and boredom of people who as members of
a minority group living in remote regions are doubtless the
poorest of Iranians.  However I found myself unable to feel
the heartbreak that Ghobadi would hope for in his non-
Kurdish audience because the mostly plotless road movie is
loosely structured, fastening almost exclusively on the trek
through vast reaches of snow by groups carrying contraband
(auto tires and the like, not illegal drugs) over the border to
their fellow Kurds living in Iraq where the goods can
command a better price.  </P>
<P>   The principal element of the story is the struggle,
sometimes narrated by the twelve-year-old girl Amaneh
(Ameneh Ekhtiar-Dini) whose brother Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi)
has become the young leader of the orphaned family.  Ayoub
is responsible not only for Amaneh for also for his sister
Rojine and for a crippled, deformed and perhaps retarded 15-
year-old, Madi (Mehdi Ekhtiar-Dini).  Ayoub and his clan are
hoping to be paid enough by the heads of the smuggling
operation to get his crippled brother an operation that he
needs to have within the year to save his life, but the adults
who lead the force of mules not only make excuses to avoid
payment but feed their animals vodka-laced water to
encourage the "horses" to walk in the sub-freezing weather. 
Predictably enough, the mules get intoxicated and at one
point simply lie down on the job, at which point their are
futilely whipped by their cruel and desperate masters.</P>
<P>   "A Time for Drunken Horses" played at Cannes where it
was named co-winner of the Camera d'Or prize and was
featured as well at the Toronto Film Festival where Toronto
National Post critic Noah Richler found the film "gut-
punching" and "heartbreaking."  My own reaction, unlike that
of the story's mules, is more sober.  While Ghobadi's heart is
in the right place and the acting perfectly fine considering its
non-professional nature, the film simply lacks the punch
needed to give the poverty and desperation piercing.</P>
<P>Not Rated.  Running time: 77 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
