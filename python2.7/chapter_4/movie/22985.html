<PRE>SCREAM 3</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Wes Craven
Written by: Ehren Kruger</PRE>
<P>In "Scream", director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson created a film 
which was a brilliant blend of horror and self mocking comedy. In "Scream 2", 
the same writer, director team made a film which, while not quite as 
enjoyable as the first, blended the two genres as it joyfully poked fun at 
sequels. With "Scream 3", Wes Craven was given the chance to have fun with 
trilogies. The problem is, Williamson wasn't on board this time and was 
replaced by Ehren Kruger ("Arlington Road"). Williamson is sorely missed. 
While all the old characters are back, Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dopey Dewey 
(David Arquette), and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) don't seem to be having 
too much fun anymore. The truth of the matter is, I can't blame them. The 
Scream films have turned into the exact thing they were trying to satirize.</P>
<P>The ghost masked killer is back, and he/she is desperately seeking Sidney 
(sorry, couldn't help myself). However, Sidney has gone into hiding out in 
the woods, fearful of yet another killer coming after her. Meanwhile, Stab 3, 
the movie in a movie of the Woodsburough murders, is being filmed. The film's 
cast is becoming worried that the killer may start after them rather than of 
their real life counterparts. Dewey and Gale team up with homicide detective, 
Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), and attempt to find the killer before he strikes 
again (and again, and again). Tossed into the mix are Stab 3's director, 
Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the film's producer, John Milton (Lance 
Henriksen), Stab's entire cast, and, somehow, Sidney's dead mother, Maureen 
(I believe played by Priscilla Pointer).</P>
<P>One of the trademarks of the Scream films has been to kill two characters off 
at the very beginning of the film. I personally believe this is a bad idea. 
This makes for an incredibly predictable first ten minutes or so. In "Scream 
2" we may have received this predictable intro, but at least the remainder of 
the film was somewhat surprising. In "Scream 3", an easily forseen film 
follows this intro. One of the other major failings in "Scream 3", as opposed 
to the previous two films, is the lack of any real humor. We all might 
chuckle at Dewey's stupidity at times, but it's not the same. The reason is 
obvious, and for those of you that haven't seen "Scream 2", I advise you not 
to read this next sentence. With the departure of Randy (Jamie Kennedy), all 
the humor has been sapped out of the film. We are no longer granted hilarious 
little monologues about the faults of horror movies or, at times, of movies 
in general.</P>
<P>Despite all this, "Scream 3" does have its moments. Randy does make a brief 
appearance of sorts, which is quite amusing, but promises things the movie 
fails to deliver. Also, watch for a cameo by two characters from another film 
series which comes completely out of left field. It's also nice to see Dewey 
and Gale again, as the two will occasionally indulge in some very funny 
dialogue. However, Sidney has rather worn out her welcome. She's no longer 
the strong character that she was in the previous two films. She now hides 
away from her troubles half the time, and simply appears tired of the entire 
situation the other half (who can blame her?).</P>
<P>I suppose I could go on listing faults all day, but what exactly is the 
point? Nearly every teenager on the planet is going to see this film, despite 
what I say. Perhaps they'll see something in it that I didn't. One more thing 
I simply must note: indie film favorite, Parker Posey ("Coneheads", "The 
House of Yes") is absolutely wasted in the role of the actress playing Gale 
Weathers in Stab 3. Parker is a delightful actress, but she is allowed to do 
nothing here other than follow Gale about, making idiotic and annoying 
comments about how she would have done things differently. "Scream 3" runs 
far too long at 116 minutes. I don't think you'll be able to sleep because 
someone is constantly screaming (imagine that) throughout the film. I'd 
recommend it to fans of really cheesy "b" horror films, but to no one else. I 
give it a generous two and a half out of five stars.</P>
