<PRE>Once Upon a Time in America (1984)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 90</PRE>
<P>There are people who believe that most movies should be
ninety minutes or less in length.  Anything more, and the
storyline and tension becomes diluted.</P>
<P>Perhaps that is the case for most directors, but definitely
not for Sergio Leone, who was a master at making films that
challenged the audience's kidneys.  His best movies:
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", "Once Upon a Time in
the West", and "Once Upon a Time in America", all take
their time, with the focus on cinematography rather than
script.</P>
<P>"Once Upon a Time in America" was his last direction, and it
could be his best.  It tells the story of the rise and
fall of New York Jewish mobsters, covering a time period
from the early 1920s to the late 1960s.  Robert De Niro
and James Woods have the leading roles, with Elizabeth McGovern
and Tuesday Weld playing their girlfriends.</P>
<P>The film goes on and on for nearly four hours.  This led to
heavy cuts by the studio that damaged the continuity, but
most of the film's length has since been restored.  There
are some scenes that are drawn out. For example, De Niro spends
a few minutes stirring the coffee while his fellow gangsters
impatiently wait for him to speak his mind.  But mostly
the length is due to the depth of the story, which is really
three films in one: the mobsters as adolescents, young adults,
and middle aged men.</P>
<P>De Niro and Woods are the leaders of their gang.  They may
be lifetime friends, but they are also rivals, with differing
ambitions.  Woods is looking for the big score at any cost,
while De Niro is content with a local fiefdom that plays
by his rules, valuing friendship and avoiding giving control
to strangers.  This leads to inevitable conflicts between
Woods and De Niro, and it doesn't help that Woods is unstable
while De Niro is prone to depression.</P>
<P>For an Italian director, Leone had a great interest in
American mythology, especially the West.  His attempt at
capturing the Prohibition era results in an outstanding film.</P>
