<PRE>                                   CRUMB
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Remember, way back in the 60s, when everywhere you looked you saw
the cartoon, "Keep On Truckin'. . .?"  That was the work of the
"underground cartoonist" Robert Crumb; this documentary is not only
about Crumb but his mother, his artist brothers, his wives; they make
for an odd lot despite their obvious talent.  In addition, there are
interviews with current top underground artists.</P>
<P>     The second most famous of his work was something he did for Janet
Joplin's Cheap Thrills.   Robert Crumb was also famous for Fritz the
Cat which Ralph Bakshi made into the first x-rated animated feature.
Time Magazine's art critic, Robert Hughes, compares Crumb with the 16th
Century Brueghels.  While I have seen many Brueghels, I don't know
enough about art to see the resemblance that Hughes finds.</P>
<P>     Over a period of about six years, Director Terry Zwigoff, did
interviews with Crumb, his wives, his family and other cartoonists.
What emerges is a film of a very talented and entirely uninhibited
artist.  In all the film, he wears his hat and his smile while all the
time he is sketching in pen and ink.  The ease with which the pictures
take shape is a marvel to behold as the pen seems to be scratching away
with a will of its own..</P>
<P>     An appreciation of underground art is helpful in enjoying and
understanding Crumb and all those with whom he associated.  ZAP Comix,
for instance, is one of his.  While here in the U.S. he has cult fame,
in Europe and Japan his artistic work is more readily seen as "real"
art.   If you do not mind admiring the work of an artist who, at age
five,  was sexually attracted to Bugs Bunny, you will get a bang out of
the film ... even when Crumb goes way beyond tilting with what today
is considered PC.</P>
