<PRE>TWO GIRLS AND A GUY
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Two Girls and a Guy is an odd and pretentious character drama that can't
quite sustain interest beyond its first thirty minutes.  In fact,
reading the scandal sheets about its star, Robert Downey Jr, would
probably create a more lively experience.</P>
<P>The film opens with two women standing outside an apartment in New York
City. There's Carla (Heather Graham), who is seemingly quiet and
reserved. And there's Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner), bounding with energy
and a non-stop talker.</P>
<P>After a little introductory chit-chat, the two discover that for the
past year they have been unknowingly sharing the same boyfriend, actor
Blake Allen (Downey Jr.).  Shocked and upset, the two decide to confront
Blake about his roguish activities.</P>
<P>But confrontation doesn't seem to be enough.  In the ensuing
argument/conversation that follows, the two girls try to discover the
reasoning behind his behavior.</P>
<P>The action of Two Girls and a Guy is confined to one set, Blake's
apartment, and, aside from a few minor roles at the very beginning, is
limited to the three main characters.  There's a lot of talking in the
movie, and its not very good (or even revealing) conversation.</P>
<P>The movie might stir some interesting comparisons between Robert Downey
Jr himself and the self-destructive character that he plays.  But that
is really the only interesting thing about his character.  The movie
never inspires the kind of curiosity about Blake that Carla and Lou
evince.</P>
<P>As for Carla and Lou, they don't quite hold their end of the show
either. Natasha Gregson Wagner fares the worst.  In the opening scenes,
she recites her lines with the liveliness of cue cards.  To be fair, she
gets somewhat better in subsequent scenes, but is never fully convincing
in the role.  Heather Graham does a better acting job, but is stuck with
the film's least interesting (and most perplexing) character.</P>
<P>Director James Tolback directed Downey Jr. once before in 1987's dull
The Pick-Up Artist. The second time's not the charm here.</P>
