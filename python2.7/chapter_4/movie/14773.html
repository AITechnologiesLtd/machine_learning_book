<PRE>                    JERRY AND TOM (United States)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: Two used car salesmen are also contract killers for the
organized crime syndicate.  We see them over the course of years as the
Mentor loses his edge and the younger learns the skills of the older
man but does not inherit his scruples.  Humor and drama intermingle.
Joe Montegna leads a cast of familiar actors.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), 2
(-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Saul Rubinek.  Screenplay by Rick Cleveland based on
     his own one-act play.
   - Older killer Tom (Joe Mantegna) teaches Jerry (Sam Rockwell) the
     nuts and bolts of the killing profession.  Including how to make
     things like a chainsaw work.  Jerry is a dim bulb.
   - Paternal Tom eventually becomes bothered by the ruthlessness of
     his partner Jerry.
   - Many familiar actors in small roles.  Peter Riegert, Ted Danson,
     William Macy, Saul Rubinek (who also directed), Charles Durning,
     Maury Chaykin.
   - Initially a comedy, but the serious elements take over.  They
     could not remain flippant about murder for long.
   - Amazing scene transitions that look like one continuous cut; yet
     there are no special effects in the film.  All transitions done by
     building a recreation of the previous set next to the following
     set.
   - Humorous allusions to real events. (E.g. Kennedys, Jimmy Hoffa).</P>
