<PRE>Me: **** (out of four stars)</PRE>
<PRE>   Note:  Some may consider portions of the following text to
          be spoilers.  Be forewarned.</PRE>
<P>It's tough to make a thoughtful and tasteful film about a taboo
subject like necrophilia, rather than simply taking the easy way
out via an exploitation film or going for shock value.  Eschewing
a brazenly outrageous or exploitive tact on the film's decidedly
taboo subject matter, Lynne Stopkewich's first feature film
KISSED is a magnificent, beautiful piece of work, wonderfully
written, acted, and shot.</P>
<P>Even as a child, Sandra Larson (played by Natasha Morley as a child;
Molly Parker portrays the adult Sandra) is fascinated by the beauty
and stillness of death, collecting dead rodents and other small
animals from the woods in order to perform intricate rituals.
Sandra strips, dances, and lovingly caresses the dead animals
against herself in order to claim their essence before carefully
burying them.</P>
<P>Years pass, but Sandra's interest remains.  Quitting her job at a
flower shop, she gets a job at a funeral parlour and studies embalming.
She gets a boyfriend too, Matt (played by Peter Outerbridge), a
young medical student taking some time off.  When Sandra reveals
her secret to him, Matt's reaction is not that of disgust or horror,
but curiousity.  His passion for Sandra eventually spins out of
control, leading to an inevitable conclusion which is poetic and
poignant.</P>
<P>Molly Parker gives a sensational performance as Sandra.  With her
photogenic freckled features and natural screen presence, she makes
a compelling, engaging lead, and her take on her character is intriguing.
Sandra is, for all intents and purposes, the girl next door (albeit
a little quiet and withdrawn) with a striking little character quirk.
Parker's dreamy narration throughout KISSED perfectly suits the tone
of the film, and her timid mannerisms are wonderfully executed.  She's
a real revelation.</P>
<P>The screenplay for KISSED is wonderfully written - sparse, well-paced,
classy, and very clever.  There are well-timed moments of dry humour,
such as many of the scenes with Sandra's funeral parlour boss, and
in an argument Sandra has with Matt, where she blurts out "I don't
fuck everything that's dead!"  It's particularly impressive that
the screenwriters didn't succumb to the temptation to get overly
clever with the plot, and allowed the film to flow to its natural
conclusion.</P>
<P>Stopkewich's poised direction of the film is first-rate and demonstrates
remarkable proficiency for a debut feature. The film was clearly
lovingly crafted, with virtually every shot well laid out; it's a
stunningly beautiful film to watch.  There's an incredibly surreal
feel to the film, aided in part by the cool lighting as shot by
cinematographer Gregory Middleton, and the music for KISSED, as
handled by Don MacDonald, is orchestrated perfectly.</P>
<P>KISSED simply will not be to everyone's taste.  Despite being a
completely tasteful film, there will be those who simply will not
accept a film whose lead character is a necrophiliac, and will have
the preconceived notion of a groteseque, disturbing film.  My
condolesences go to them, as they're missing a great movie.  I'm
keeping my eyes out for Lynne Stopkewich's next project.</P>
