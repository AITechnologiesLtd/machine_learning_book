A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>"We cannot run away from who we are. Our destiny chooses us," explains
Professor Petrovsky to law student Mike McDermott.</P>
<P>If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on half the people reading that
statement thinking "Great, bring it on!" And the other half saying "Oh God,
no! Anything but this!"</P>
<P>The notion that fundamentally we are who we are and nothing we can do will
change that is both comforting and frightening. How dismaying it is that we
might be fated for a role in life and yet how inviting it would be just settle
into who we are and quit fighting it.</P>
<P>McDermott (Matt Damon) is a poker player. No matter how much he wants to be
something else, he is a genius at the game. When he loses his $30,000 life
savings in one hand to KGB Teddy (John Malkovich), he begins to doubt his
chosen profession.</P>
<P>A few months later, we catch up with Mike who has hung up his deck of cards
and is driving a delivery truck to put himself through law school. He's doing
well although his live-in girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) is constantly
suspicious that he'll return to his addiction. Mike is living the straight and
narrow until his childhood buddy Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison and
guilts him into returning to The Game.</P>
<P>Although Worm was a stand-up guy while they were growing up and didn't rat out
Mike when they got into big trouble, he's a something of a sleezoid. Where
Mike is a master at the psychological game, Worm is a "mechanic", manipulating
the cards and dealing off the bottom. In short order, he's racked up a $7,000
debt in Mike's name, gotten him into danger from violent gangster Grama
(Michael Rispoli) and beat up by dozens of state cops.</P>
<P>Focusing on immediate problems, Mike screws up his potential law career
showing up for moot court completely unprepared. Jo is disgusted that he's
gone back to gambling and moves out. Unless he comes up with a huge wad of
cash in a couple of days, Grama and KGB Teddy are going to kill him.</P>
<PRE>Things are not looking good.</PRE>
<P>The inside look at high-stakes poker is fascinating. From the posh Las Vegas
World Series Of Poker to the paint pealing walls of New York game rooms hidden
behind locked metal doors, we get a glimpse of a world that most of the
audience have never seen. Director John Dahl ("The Last Seduction") has wisely
chosen not to dumb-down the scenes for those of us who are only acquainted
with the penny-ante version of the pasteboards. Often voice-over narration
only tells us what we already know, but in this case Damon's explanations work
well as a map to a foreign world.</P>
<P>Mike maintains that poker is a game of skill rather than luck. He plays the
man, not the cards. An expert at picking up the little physical "tells" that
reveal what a player has and knowing when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em, he
fleeces the flock faster than most people could deal a hand of five-card stud.</P>
<P>But the gambler has an ego problem. After a big game when he has all the money
he needs to re-pay Worm's debts and then some, he can't resist one more round
for everything. Gambler's Anonymous is going to have a problem with this film.</P>
<P>The movie is jammed with first-rate actors and the film's defects are salvaged
by their performances. Damon is as easy to like as he was in "Good Will
Hunting", partially because he plays essentially the same character having to
choose between school and the seamier side of life. Norton's quirky and
nervous Worm is a Sean Penn role and he plays it as well as Penn ever could.
Malkovich is hilarious as the Russian mob-connected poker player with one of
the thickest accents around. Martin Landau has a small but pivotal role as
Mike's professor and is a pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>Under-used is John Turturro as Joey Knish. Knish is the opposite of Mike. He
plays poker to pay his alimony and child support rather than for the thrill of
victory. Turturro is wonderful and I kept wishing for more screen time.</P>
<P>This is definitely a film about men. The women seem tossed in as an after
thought and are as well fleshed-out as Barbie dolls. Mol's Jo is little more
than a nag from the beginning. Famke Janssen as Petra, operator of a poker
room, has potential but a very minor role.</P>
<P>When the camera leaves the poker table, the film has some problems. Everyone
is telling everyone else how to live their lives. Jo demands that Mike not
gamble. Mike insists that Worm do things his way. Knish advises Mike on the
true path. Petrovsky informs Mike on the way things work. Grama lays out the rules.</P>
<P>As believable as the interaction between the characters is, their
relationships are lacking. Mike and Jo are never shown doing anything but
bickering. Their relationship exists only to provide the obligatory love
interest. He seems as unaffected by their break-up as he is by his academic
problems. Mike and Worm are pals, but their friendship is never really resolved.</P>
<P>Although the movie is flawed, I'll lay you ten-to-one that the atmospheric
subculture of high-stakes gambling will be as enticing to you as it is to me.
I'm ready to pack up my $34 life savings and head to the tables.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for over 23 years and he just found
two more dollars to play poker with but he still can't remember if a flush
beats a straight. Email the answer to <A HREF="mailto:Redman@indepen.com.">Redman@indepen.com.</A>)</P>
