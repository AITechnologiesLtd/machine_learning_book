<PRE>THE BEACH
A film review by Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Normally, I try to avoid pitting novels and their film adaptations against
each other. Side-by-side comparisons are inevitable, of course, but
when i read the book and then go right out to see the movie, whether
each is good or not, I can't help noticing the subtle differences. The
things that were cut, the things that were changed, the things that
now make far less sense because of the other things that were cut and
changed.</P>
<P>I was about 40 pages from the end of Alex Garland's novel THE BEACH
when I saw the big-screen version. Like many adaptations, the
intricacies of the original story were cannibalized, simplified or
straight-up ignored in the movie. The substitute? Vague, steamy sex.
Sex that was only contemplated or not mentioned at all in the book now
becomes necessary because this is a Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle, and
that means the female element will be coming to see it. I guess director
Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) thinks the female element likes its
cinematic sex vague, steamy and seemingly out of left-field.</P>
<P>So, completely gone in the movie version are most of the moments of
human politics and wry humor. The voice of the narrator in this movie
isn't the one from the book -- it's Leo's, obviously, but the words aren't
usually even the same. They're dumbed-down, less clever, mostly
humorless and designed to fit in with the overall lack of subtlety in
DiCaprio's performance. He probably considers the early outbursts of his
character (absent from the book version) to be foreshadowing, but to
me they spoil most elements of nuance or surprise that should come
later on.</P>
<P>You want an example of a movie that perfectly captured the essence of
its source book? Look at the David Fincher-directed Fight Club. It
crackled with the kinetic energy of the book, condensing ideas instead
of simplifying, finding ways to show rather than tell or eliminate. Boyle
buries the narrative by moving from Point A to B to C, and so on. The
reasons why don't make much sense to newcomers. Motivation from
these characters? As far as the movie is concerned, the whimsy and
boredom on their faces are all the motivation that can be explained
within the given running time.</P>
<P>That's not to say THE BEACH is entirely bad; it's a fairly well-botched
adaptation job that manages to bring to life the sequestered, Eden-like
world of the book. I mentioned Fight Club because the opening of The
Beach almost reminded me of it. Leo's character is a world traveler out
on his own -- that's about all the background we get -- who is just now
touching down in Bangkok in search of thrills. While an edgy techno
score plays, Leo throws back a shot of snake blood while the assembled
group of Thais looks on, impressed with his American angst.</P>
<P>At the two-bit hotel he's staying in, walls so thin they don't even reach
the ceiling, Leo overhears the incoherent ramblings of a drunken
Scotsman (Robert Carlyle, who feels no pain and can push himself
longer and harder than any normal man). He's rambling about some
idyllic beach society that's hidden away from the eyes of modern man.
And he even has a map to the place, which he leaves for Leo to find
after he (i.e. the drunken Scot) slashes his wrists in the dead of night.</P>
<P>On a whim, Leo decides to strike out for this beach. On another whim --
a steamy, vague whim -- he asks the neighbors (Guillaume Canet and
Staffan Kihlbom, the French couple he could hear through the walls) to
go with him. And, no questions asked, no deliberation shown, they head
for the island, which is located on designated Marine Park land. That
means they have to swim from the next island over, and after Canet
and Kihlbom play a practical joke on him, we see just how volatile the
movie protagonist can get.</P>
<P>The movie shows us the island in all its tour-book beauty, as well as the
obstacle course travelers have to go through to arrive at THE BEACH. In
particular, the enormous waterfall and field of pot, carefully tended to
by the Thai drug dealers who occupy half the island. (Idyllic hippies and
Thai druglords sharing an island -- sounds like a bad, neo-"Gilligan's
Island" sitcom premise, doesn't it?)</P>
<P>Naturally, the politics of this secret society ("a full-scale community of
travelers not just passing through but actually living here") are toned
way down in the movie version. There's no real exploration of the work
details, no Tet festival, no food poisoning, and the "Jed" character (one
of the book's best) is missing entirely. What we do have are Keaty
(Paterson Joseph), the black Briton the Leo character bonds with, and
Sal (Tilda Swinton), the somewhat volatile unofficial leader of THE BEACH
group. This being DiCaprio country, the absence of plot politics is
compensated with an abundance of vague soap steam, most notably an
underwater, "phosphorescence" love scene.</P>
<P>THE BEACH was called the first mainstream Generation-X novel, but the
movie has been stripped of any such context, save the sampling of
Apocalypse Now moments and surreal Sega-game vision toward the
end. Now it's in Hollywood hands, which means the most profound idea
expressed is the paradox of trying to create an ideal paradise in a
frighteningly unideal world. These travelers want to hop from place to
place, experiencing thrills, but only as long as it comes with the
illusion
of uncharted territory. Too many other travelers there, and the original
people come to resent it. Rifts are created. Problems arise. (Oh, and
there's the Fight Club-familiar notion that ours is a generation raised in
unsatisfying, ungodly technological nightmare, and that there's no sane
way for us to cope.)</P>
<P>The ending is also of the "less complicated, more Hollywood" ideology.
We're denied the (ironically) much more cinematic shock-value ending of
the book, although I'm betting the MPAA wouldn't have been too keen
on that. Anyway, like I was saying, the reason I don't normally read
books before watching and reviewing their movie counterparts is
because of the nitpicky comparisons that result. This time, though, the
differences are enormous and noticeable and really distract from the
experience.</P>
<P>On a superficial level, I enjoyed the cinematography in THE BEACH, and
the virtual unknowns in the cast all hold their own with Leo. (You have
to wonder why DiCaprio is the only person anyone's heard of in The
Beach. Was there only $20 million in the casting budget to begin with?)
Even the cannibalized plot has some merit -- i.e. not all the book's
nuances are missing here -- but overall I'd definitely say this movie has
only the illusion of uncharted territory.</P>
