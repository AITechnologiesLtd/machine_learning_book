<P>Susan Granger's review of "ILLUMINATA" (Artisan Entertainment)</P>
<P>         After "Shakespeare in Love," this sumptuously presented but
overly long story of behind-the-scenes actors pales in comparison. But
you have to credit it as a labor of love by John Turturro, who
co-wrote, directed, and acted in it. Set amid a flamboyant
turn-of-the-century New York repertory company, it revolves around a
failing resident playwright, John Turturro, whose claim to fame is his
marriage to the troupe's leading lady, played by Katherine Borowitz,
Turturro's real-life wife. The playwright yearns to shelve the
heavy-handed melodramas of the period as he aspires to a more
naturalistic style of theater, but no one believes in
him. "Illuminata" is both the title of a play-within-the-movie and
what he eventually calls his wife after they survive treachery,
back-biting, and intrigue - not to mention the on-stage death of the
leading man mid-performance on opening night. Susan Sarandon is
glorious as the promiscuous, aging diva who glances at a young actress
and murmurs, "That is how I shall look years from now. I'm beginning
to be able to play ingenues." But Christopher Walken steals the
picture as a smug, gay critic - think Oscar Wilde - who relishes the
cruelty he liberally dishes out, and Bill Irwin is amusing as the
wretchedly reluctant object of his affections. Their characterizations
are particularly bawdy. Beverly D'Angelo, Ben Gazzara, and the late
Donal McCann complete the supporting cast, along with Turturro's son
and cousin. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Illuminata" is an
art-house 6, exploring the durability of love with enough dramatic
lulls to catch a quick snooze.</P>
