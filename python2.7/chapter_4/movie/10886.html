<PRE>The Rock
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1996 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Summer action films are an odd thing to review. The genre is so narrowly
focused (low on characterization, plot and just about everything else, big
only on the keeping-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seatness), that it's remarkably
rare for it to produce a truly great movie.</P>
<P>The season is usually filled with mediocre -- occasionally downright
horrendous -- offerings and the tendency is to compare: `At least this one
isn't as bad as that one.' </P>
<P>"The Rock" is definitely different. Starting with wonderful casting and
featuring a mastery of the genre, the film strikes at the heart of summer
excitement with surgical precision. It is so well crafted that you'll be
holding your breath for over two hours and not notice its defects until after
the credits roll. Exactly as it should be.</P>
<P>Ed Harris is a renegade Brigadier General who leads a group of Marines first
in stealing enough deadly gas and rockets to destroy a major city, and then in
taking over Alcatraz along with 81 hostages so they can be in position to take
out the city by the bay. Their demands are on the noble side: money and
recognition for US servicemen killed during illegal military actions.</P>
<P>His very reluctant opponents are the makings of the best odd couple in years.
Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) is a  bookish FBI bomb defuser and
self-described chemical `superfreak' drafted into the action hero role. Sean
Connery plays John Mason, a street-wise highly trained British ultra spy who
was in his heyday during the early sixties. (Wait a minute, you don't think he's...?)</P>
<P>Mason was arrested and jailed for 30 years without a trial for stealing
microfilm from J. Edgar Hoover revealing such major US secrets as who really
killed JFK and other nefarious truths. He comes into play here because he is
the only person ever to have escaped Alcatraz. Now he's going to lead the
anti-terrorist squad in.</P>
<P>Mason is exactly the role that Connery is best at: the grand old man still
capable of kicking butt with the best of them. Cage is his perfect foil who
goes by the rules but then loosens up with begrudging admiration for the convict.</P>
<P>Everything starts of with slam-bang action, then goes to big guns, then deadly
gas, then missiles, then more slam-bang, and more big guns and -- you get the
idea. There's not a moment to stop and smell the roses before they get blasted away.</P>
<P>And it's a good thing that you don't have that moment or else you would
realize that the plot is almost exactly the same as "Executive Action", that
some of the filmmaking is sloppy (exactly how many missiles did Cage disarm in
the morgue?) or that "Bad Boys" Michael Bay films the thing like a damned
music video.</P>
<P>But as I said, you never get the time to realize that and Harris, Connery and
Cage are so good that you don't want to and besides it's summer.</P>
