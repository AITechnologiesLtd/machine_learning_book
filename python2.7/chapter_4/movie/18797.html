<P>Whilst A Midsummer Night's Dream may not be one of Shakespeare's best
plays, it's arguably his most atmospheric.  Only one previous film
adaptation has been made by a major studio, and that was in the 1930's.
The reason: it's such a big ask for a motion picture.  The Bard intended
his play to be a magical and luminous experience, and these are
qualities that can't be produced through just a script.  Thankfully,
filmmaker Michael Hoffman's take on the well-known production is
pleasing to the senses, and with the aid of cinematographer Oliver
Stapleton (One Fine Day), he has created quite a spectacular mythical
world.  The lively visual energy of A Midsummer Night's Dream is its
selling point both commercially and artistically and it evokes, as
Shakespeare would have would intended, a sense of wonder and magic.
Although some of the film's other elements bring it down - which,
incidentally, are mostly the same things that limited the play's
narrative success - this piece will please the masses, and for all the
right reasons.</P>
<P>Instead of 16th century Greece the setting is 19th century Tuscany, and
the bicycle has just been invented.  Kevin Kline is Nick Bottom, a
comical, obnoxious but courageous actor who is assigned to play Pyramus
in 'Pyramus and Thisby,' an absurd drama from a company of struggling
entertainers.  They are to perform in front of the Duke on his wedding
night.  Meanwhile, four star-crossed lovers are pursuing each other in a
magical forest.  Helena (Calista Flockhart) loves Demetrius (Christian
Bale), who barely acknowledges her existence and is engaged to marry
Hermia (Christian Bale), but Hermia's true object of affection is
Lysander (Dominic West).  The Fairy King Oberon (Rupert Everett) watches
them from a distance, and instructs his mischievous servant Puck
(Stanley Tucci) to find a special kind of flower juice.  A drop of this
juice, once placed on the eyelids of somebody sleeping, will make them
fall instantly in love to the first person they see upon waking.  Puck,
of course, worsens the situation by placing the juice on the wrong set
of eyelids.</P>
<P>Given the nature of his material, Hoffman's direction is quite heavy
handed.  Much of the cast, too, try a little too hard to make it all
work.  Kevin Kline is the only lead performer who looks completely
natural on the screen, and almost effortlessly entertains.  Bottom, as a
comical character, is one of Shakespeare's finest, and Kline fits the
criteria perfectly. Calista "Ally McBeal" Flockhart, on the other hand,
is more unconventional in her approach to Helena's eccentric
personality.  Flockhart overplays her somewhat, obviously intending to
portray love-struck Shakespearean craziness, but she misfires somewhere
along the line.  Perhaps it's because she is the only actor who looks
like she's been dragged from the set of Ally McBeal and asked to read
Shakespeare.  Flockhart, and especially Hoffman, are two production
members who sometimes make A Midsummer Night's Dream feel like it is
taking itself a little too seriously.  Even in the final scene, in which
Puck recites his famous speech ("if we shadows have offended, think but
this, and all is mended…"), Hoffman misses the point entirely.  He takes
the speech very seriously, whereas Shakespeare intended it to ask
forgiveness for those who were hoping for another Macbeth or Hamlet.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, A Midsummer Nigh'ts Dream is a solid and entertaining
adaptation with some nice touches, both visually and literately.
Watching cast members wizz around on bicycles is a novel idea, as are a
couple of fun scenes that audiences will get a hoot from, including a
good old fashioned female mud fight and, as Geoffrey Rush in Shakespeare
in Love voiced, a "bit with a dog."  The film's narrative structure,
like the play's, is simplistic if not a little trite, but it was never
intended to be something profound.  A Midsummer Night's Dream is
probably the closest description of Melrose Place in the 16th century
(or, as it is here, the 19th century) that one can find.  If you are
tossing up whether to see Michael Hoffman's beautifully textured,
visually entrancing and charming film or wait for the next high school
production, I know which one I'd choose.</P>
