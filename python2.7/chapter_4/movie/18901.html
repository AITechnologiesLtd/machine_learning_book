The Negotiator (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>Police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson) wows the press and
annoys his fellow cops with his daring maneuvers to take out hostage-takers. 
One night Danny's partner Nate (Paul Guilfoyle) tells him that cops in their
precinct are stealing money from the disability fund.  Nate is soon murdered,
and Danny is accused of both his friend's murder and the theft of the
departmental funds.  Faced with certain conviction, Danny takes his only
suspect, internal affairs inspector Niebaum (J. T. Walsh in his last role), and
three others hostage.  Danny knows that Niebaum's co-conspirators will be
nervous that the inspector will talk, so they will reveal themselves and try to
kill both Danny and Niebaum.  Since he can't trust anyone in his precinct,
Danny demands that the hostage team bring in a negotiator from another
precinct, Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey).</P>
<P>"The Negotiator" is character-driven, so its success rides on the able
shoulders of its lead actors.  Jackson and Spacey complement each other well: 
Jackson -- angry, on edge, striking out at everyone around him; Spacey -- calm,
crafty, perceptive.  Their scenes together are tense and suspenseful.  Danny
stalks around with a gun, spewing threats and coming ever closer to killing a
hostage.  Chris approaches the situation like a chess match, and he tries
various gambits to gain control of the board.  The conflict of negotiators is
built around talk, of course, and Jackson and Spacey are two of the best
talkers in Hollywood.</P>
<P>The cast is filled out by a familiar group of character actors.  As the major
suspects to be the mastermind that framed Danny:  David Morse (the father in
"Contact"), Ron Rifkin (the DA in "LA Confidential"), and John Spencer (the FBI
director in "The Rock").  Paul Giamatti offers some welcome comic relief as a
petty crook among Danny's hostages. Regina Taylor (from TV's "I'll Fly Away")
plays Danny's wife.</P>
<P>The down side?  Even though Danny is supposed to be an unpredictable
risk-taker, we also know early on that he is a) innocent and b) a good cop. 
This undercuts a lot of the suspense; despite the movie's elaborate attempts to
make us believe that Danny will kill his hostages, we know he's too decent a
person to cross that line.  </P>
<P>"The Negotiator" won't make anyone's Ten Best list, but it is solid genre fare
with a strong cast.</P>
