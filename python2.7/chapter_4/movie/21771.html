<P>This controversial, disturbing and visually stylish new film
from Spike Lee is certainly not for the faint hearted.  Dealing with
the killing spree of David Berkowitz, dubbed the Son of Sam, during
the hot summer of 1977, this uncompromising film is something of a
return to form for Lee, whose last couple of films have lacked impact,
and have even failed to secure a release in this country.  But Summer
of Sam is no mere police procedural depicting the intense
investigation to track down the killer, who later claimed that he was
ordered to kill by his neighbour's barking dog.  Rather, Summer Of Sam
recalls Lee's superb Do The Right Thing, which explored how events
reverberate throughout a neighbourhood, like a rock thrown into a pool
sends out ever increasing ripples that disturb the smooth surface.</P>
<P>Lee beautifully evokes the heat and steamy tension of New York
during that unforgettable summer, characterised by an unusual heat
wave.  Real life events from the time are also woven into the
narrative, giving a sense of authenticity.  Lee captures feverish
Saturday nights spent dancing in hip discos, the palpable sense of
fear that permeated the neighbourhood with Sam stalking the streets,
the sweaty heat wave, and the deep seated suspicions and tensions that
upset an otherwise close knit Italian American community.</P>
<P>John Leguizamo (the awful Spawn, etc) gives a career best
performance here as Vinny, a swaggering and macho Brooklyn
hairdresser, whose marital infidelities finally catch up with during
that fateful summer.  Sex, drugs and an increasingly chaotic lifestyle
soon take their toll on Vinny, and creates a rift between him and his
long suffering wife Dionna (Oscar winner Mira Sorvino).  His best
friend is Ritchie (Adrien Brody, recently seen in the star studded The
Thin Red Line, etc), who proudly struts around the neighbourhood
sporting his new look, heavily influenced by the British new wave of
punk rock, much to the chagrin of his buddies who profess a far more
reserved and traditional outlook.  But as Sam's killing spree
continues, fear and suspicion soon permeate the neighbourhood.
Vigilante gangs form, the mob offers a hefty reward, and some outraged
citizens take the law into their own hands, targeting those whose
behaviour they view as suspicious.  Soon Vinny and Ritchie find
themselves on a violent and nasty collision course that will forever
taint their friendship.</P>
<P>Summer Of Sam is a very violent and confronting film, and Lee
sails close to the wind with his recreation of both a time and a place
that has left some very deep psychological scars.  The scenes dealing
with Sam have a gritty intensity and palpable sense of madness to
them, and Lee gives these sequences a bizarre, almost surreal touch
that sometimes jars with the other elements of the film.  Lee has
bathed the film in hits from the '70's, which creates a nostalgic mood
for many in the audience.  But rather than merely using the music as
an accessory on which to hang the obligatory soundtrack album, Lee
carefully integrates the songs into the structure and fabric of the</P>
<PRE>
film.</PRE>
<P>Somehow he has married two vastly different story strands into
what is largely a nostalgic look at the glory days of disco.  It's
almost as if Son of Sam had wandered into Saturday Night Fever and
started blasting away at random!  Lee also cleverly bookends the
narrative with a monologue from Jimmy Breslin, the former reporter who
wrote the definitive book on the Son of Sam killings, which gives the
material a nicely ironic touch.</P>
<P>Performances throughout are quite solid, with The Practice's
Michael Badalucco, cast against type, delivering a rather intense
performance as the driven killer.  Sorvino is also strong as Dionna,
who finally summons up the courage and strength to leave her
philandering husband.  One weak link is Lee himself, who gives a very
wooden and uncomfortable performance as a television journalist
attempting to seek out community responses to the murder spree.</P>
<P>Lee uses a lot of his usual cinematic tricks to give the film
an idiosyncratic look and feel, but Summer Of Sam will test the
patience and stamina of many within the audience.  As strong and as
compelling as Summer Of Sam may be, though, one is left with the
overwhelming impression that the definitive film exploring the Son of
Sam killings has yet to be made!
