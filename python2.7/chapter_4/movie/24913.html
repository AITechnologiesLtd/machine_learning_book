<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A vigorously played AIP submarine B-film, with a no-name cast and
low-budget special effects. All the enlisted men talk in an unnatural
jargon, which is make-believe navy talk, that is sometimes irritating on
the ol' cranium and at other times slightly amusing to the proletarian
in me. This is basically a harmless WW11 war film that is watchable for
insomniacs turning the TV dials late at night in search of something
benign. It is one of those rare 1950s WW11 films where the Japs are not
even cursed out -- the men could have been fighting the Greeks and no
one would have known the difference.</P>
<P>The sub goes by the name of Seahawk, celebrated for being a fighting
ship. The proud sub crew reacts with baseball cheers when the home team
torpedoes a Jap destroyer and with boos when they can't fire their
'fish.'It's one of those 'gung ho' movies, where the only dissension
comes from one of the officers who goes over-the-top in being too gung
ho.</P>
<P>I recommend this film for those who didn't like "The Yellow Submarine"
but like any other submarine film which doesn't have a cast of rock
singers. This is one of those films that has a simple plot and pads it
with supposedly human interest stories, as it highlights one character
from among the officers and one from the enlisted men.</P>
<P>The officer who the film hones in on, is the new skipper of the Seahawk,
Paul Turner (Bentley). He is given command even though his captain, Dean
Stoker (Heffley), gave him a negative report and the executive officer,
Bill Hallohan (Maxwell), can't stand him. They think he is too cold to
the men and too academic to be in charge of his own boat. But their
superiors pick him to take charge when the present captain is promoted
to be a desk jockey. Turner has the qualifications that are necessary
for the next mission, being a scholar and an expert in Japanese boats,
having been assigned by the service before the war to help the Japs
build their boats. The mission will change the role of the submarine
from one of shooting into one of reconnaissance, as the orders are to
find some 30-odd missing Jap war ships. The importance of the mission,
is that by locating where the Japs are building up a reserve force, the
navy will know where to strike them first.</P>
<P>The enlisted man the film hones in on, is the tiny, bespectacled Seaman
Ellis Bellis (Henry). He looks like a nerd, is a hick from Kansas,
doesn't drink booze or look at other women and talks only about marrying
his farm girl Nancy. The men, in what goes for spoofing humor, feel they
should get him drunk, and the chief officer Andy Flowers (Steve
Mitchell) becomes in charge of seeing that he gets drunk and hooks up
with a prostitute (Mabel). The fruition of the chief's project comes
close, but the Shore Patrol comes to the nerd's rescue and carries him
back to the sub for the emergency departure of the Seahawk, just before
he is about to become romantic with the prostitute.</P>
<P>The gist of the story is about the feelings the crew of the Seahawk have
about their new captain, as they grumble that the new captain is
inexperienced and is a coward because he doesn't allow them to sink the
near-by Japanese warships.</P>
<P>Turner must put up with the new radio officer (Halsey) assigned to the
sub, who tries to sabotage his efforts with the other men, and even
tries to take over command. He will be reclassified when they get back
to Pearl, as Turner learns how to be tolerant with the men while
exercising his command. Halsey's acting efforts nearly sabotaged the
film, as his strained performance was just blah! The film's purpose was
to build tension for its action-packed climax, but by having an inferior
complex because of the thinness of the story and the characters all
being dullards, an effort was made instead to show how courageous the
captain was and how he was, predictably, able to win the men over to his
side.</P>
<P>The best scene in the movie was reserved for the climax, with the men
trapped in the Jap submarine nets, as the American airplanes are
destroying all the ships that are trapped along with them. The captain
must figure a way to get his leaky sub out of there and take the boat
safely back to Pearl, and as they say in Kansas, that ain't easy Maisie.</P>
