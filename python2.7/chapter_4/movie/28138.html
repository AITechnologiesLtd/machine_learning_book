<P>   Every time a U.S. president is shot or a major government
figure is assassinated in a foreign country whether by a
crazed gunman or a group that has carefully planned a coup,
I think of how much more pleasant it is to be an ordinary guy. 
Oh, there are dangers facing all of us in these parlous times,
but it seems that the less you need a bodyguard, the less you
seem to attract people out to do you in.  Take the most
recent case of a national leader gunned down in a coup.  
Some months ago President Laurent Kabila of the Congo
was assassinated.  Even if you keep up with the New York
Times, you're likely to say, "Huh...what's this all about"? and
then you remember the time you ignored your high school
history who insisted that if you don't know her subject
thoroughly, you not only miss out on some fascinating
reading but you have no real idea how things got to be the
way they are--how a particular figure came to be the target of
an assassin's bullet.</P>
<P>   In this case Laurent Kabila was a supporter of the Congo's
George Washington, Patrice Lumumba, who--contrary to our
own country's dad--was no landowner but simply a self-taught
postal worker who began delivering fiery diatribes in his huge
country in the central part of Africa while selling beer.  He
became the former Belgian colony's first prime minister only
to be shot by a firing squad just months after assuming office. 
Does this tell you why his follower, Laurent Kabila, was
similarly taken out forty years later?  In a way it does.  If you
want a history lesson that's not only painless but fascinating
as well, take in Haitian director Raoul Peck's riveting, docu-
drama style political thriller (which he co-wrote with Pascal
Bonitzer), "Lumumba."  </P>
<P>   As the title character, Eriq Ebouaney looks and acts like
Denzel Washington in his portrayal of "Malcolm X" in Spike
Lee's considerably longer historical drama. The picture opens
on a grisly scene, that of a couple of Belgian soldiers (one
drinking heavily from a bottle, a man who was later to go
insane) are hacking up and disgracefully burning three
corpses.  As they chop and saw away at Lumumba's body in
the darkness, far from witnesses, cinematographer Bernard
Lutic (who shot the work mostly in Mozambique and
Zimbabwe) cuts to the young Lumumba haranguing a crowd
in Stanleyville, a pep rally urging complete independence of
the then Belgian Congo from its minuscule European colonial
power.  (As I recall from World Geography 2, sixty Belgiums
can fit inside the African country it dominated.)  Rising to the
leadership of his political party and receiving the most votes
in a democratic election, he cuts a deal with Joseph
Kasavubu to share power, with Kasavubu as president and
Lumumba and Prime Minister.  </P>
<P>   In a power struggle that began even before the decisive
appointment, the more moderate Kasavubu--who gives a
conciliatory speech on independence day, playing up to the
Belgians in the audience--would break completely from the
radical Lumumba--who courageously indicts the Europeans
for their snobbery, their readiness to imprison dissidents, and
their continued role as white officers leading an all-black
Congolese army.  Still later in the story, as riots break out in
the barracks leading to the rapes of Belgian women by
undisciplined Congolese soldiers, Belgian paratroopers move
in to restore order and protect their nationals who remain,
while the American CIA, eager to protect American business
and geopolitical interests, back Moise Tshombe (Pascal
N'Zonzi) and his Katanga region secessionist movement.</P>
<P>   If the direction comes off on the stiff side and the
performers occasionally fall into agitprop caricatures of their
ideologies, the picture as a whole has the look of authenticity,
sincerity, and an obvious pro-Lumumba partisanship. Raoul
Peck subtly evokes the selfish, even evil motives of the
whites from the condescending Belgian general to the Belgian
ambassador and even a representative of U.S. President
Kennedy's government.  Framed by the shameless burning of
Congo's national hero with only a smidgen of kootchi-coo
family sentimentality, "Lumumba" richly deserves its Best
Picture award at the 2001 Pan African Film Festival.</P>
