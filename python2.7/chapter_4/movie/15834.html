<P>_Hilary_and_Jackie_ (R) **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jacqueline (Emily Watson) du Pre are a
sisterly pair of child musical prodigies: Hilary on the flute and
Jacqueline on the cello.  As an adult, Hilary gives up music to live a
normal life; Jackie, on the other hand, embarks on a wildly successful
career as a concert cellist, winning over worldwide audiences with her
flamboyant brand of skill and showmanship.  The divergent trajectories of
their lives (and not in the way one would expect) and the resulting
emotional and physical fallout threatens the sisters' strong bond.</P>
<P>According to the press notes, the fact-based _Hilary_and_Jackie_ was
"written and produced as a tribute to Jackie," and, as such, the focus
lies squarely on Jackie--and how could it not, with the extraordinary
Watson in the role.  For me, she is the woman to beat for best actress of
the year delivering a stunning performance that captures the entire
spectrum of her personality: from sweetness to bitterness, from madness
to illness.</P>
<P>But the film is not called _Hilary_and_Jackie_ for nothing, and not just
because Griffiths does some terrific--and sure to be underrated--work as
the more stable sister.  In an ingenious storytelling tactic, director
Anand Tucker and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce split the story in
three sections, giving clear definition to both sisters.  "Hilary and
Jackie" details their youth together up until a crucial point where they
are separated.  "Hilary" focuses on Hilary's quiet life and her
ever-shifting feelings about Jackie, who periodically reappears. 
Finally, there's "Jackie," which picks up at the first section's cutoff
point and assumes Jackie's perspective.  As we see her turbulent life
unfold, her character is given greater dimension, providing vivid reasons
for some of Jackie's more erratic behavior in the "Hilary" section (some
events from which are retold from Jackie's perspective here).  The result
is an uncommonly well-rounded portrait of a tormented genius, and a
supremely affecting story of real people, only slightly marred by a bit
of arbitrary surrealism at the end (which, coincidentally, also
marred--moreso--Watson's breakthrough film, 1996's _Breaking_the_Waves_).</P>
