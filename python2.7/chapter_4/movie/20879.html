<PRE>Dazzling Special Afflecks
Forces of Nature</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Ben Affleck stares up at the camera as he's carried on the hands of his
bachelor-partying friends. It's an upbeat opening to a movie comprised of
one up-beat after another. DreamWorks takes a rather uninteresting plotline
and makes a movie that moves around it.</P>
<P>Punchy grooving funk rocks the unlikely coupling (or is it?) of Bullock and
Affleck as the latter contemplates his matrimonial promises. I loved the
music even though it was set on 11 compared to the relatively civilized
levels of the dialogue.</P>
<P>Seems Bullock on the set inspired the filmmakers to advance the picture
along at the pace of "Speed." They were also diligent in the editing room,
bringing humorous ironies to simple cuts.</P>
<P>Affleck and Bullock (who act up a storm) survive a plane wreck among other
disasters, hooking up with Vic, a marvelously deranged side character for
whom this fine exchange was written...</P>
<PRE>Bullock: "You got any kids?"</PRE>
<PRE>Vic: "No, but I see them all over."</PRE>
<P>Steven Vahn shows off his finesse as a stand-up, crack-up, best man. While
DreamWorks shows off a few of it's not so natural-looking, but nonetheless
dazzling special effects. A few decibels short of a thunderous ending,
"Forces of Nature" will take you by storm anyway. You'll leave the theater
doing the funky chicken to a hippy-hoppy version of Crosby, Stills and Nash
"If you can't be with the one you love ... honey, love the one your with."</P>
<P>Starring Sandra Bullock, Ben Affleck and Maura Tierney.
Directed by Bronwen Hughes. Rated PG-13.</P>
