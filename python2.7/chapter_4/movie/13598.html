<PRE>The Truth About Cats & Dogs
PG-13, 97 m, 1996
Uma Thurman
Janeane Garofalo
Ben Chaplin
***1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Janeane Garofalo plays Abby, the host of a call in talk show about
pets. She gives advice to people about cats and dogs and other
creatures, great and small.</P>
<P>When a caller asks to meet with her, insecurity about her appearence
causes her to lie about her looks and stand up the man. She describes
Noelle (Uma Thurman), who lives down the hall from her, when asked
what she looks like because she never plans on meeting the caller.
The caller, Brian (Ben Chaplin), is persistent; he shows up at the
station. As luck would have it, Noelle is seated at the mike and the
die is cast on the deception: on the phone or radio, it's the real
Abby; in person, it's Noelle standing in for her.</P>
<P>This Cyrano de Bergerac-like scheme just sort of naturally unfolds,
but it can hardly be the basis for a real relationship. Ben isn't
stupid and senses something is up with the two women; this feeds
his interest in Abby. He has most in common with the real Abby,
and Noelle really can't keep up. When Brian gives her a book or
asks what she thinks about a photograph, she can't relate the way
the real Abby can. Abby and Noelle are different kinds of women.
Abby is independent and is fine with her pets. Noelle can't
imagine herself not being in a relationship and must use a check
list from a magazine to experience the epiphany that, yes, indeed,
her current boyfriend is an abusive loser.</P>
<P>The whole thing is unfortunate because Abby and Brian hit it off
so well over the phone. Also, Brian seems like a nice guy and Abby
is an attractive women with a pretty face and a warm smile, but next
to the tall, thin, and exotic Uma Thurman she must feel short and
dumpy looking. That's sad, because Brain doesn't seem like he is
necessarily looking for a Vogue model for a girlfriend.</P>
<P>What's great about this movie is instead of degenerating into a
farcical romp, the characters are developed and you instantly
want to like all three. Brian connects with these two women at
whatever level he can, which is very different depending on
whether he's got Abby on the phone, or "Abby" in person. There
is a great phone scene in which Abby and Brian have a long talk
culminationg in phone sex. There is also a very erotic scene where
he feeds Noelle -- the goody starved model -- some forbidden desert.</P>
<PRE>There is plenty to like in this movie.</PRE>
