SLAM (director: Marc Levin; cast: Saul Williams, Sonja Sohn, Bonz
Malone, Lawrence Wilson, 1998)</PRE>
<P>An intense look at the low quality of life for blacks in the inner city
of Washington, D.C.,  where killings and drugs are commonplace. SLAM has
the feel of a documentary film, as it traces the story of a young rapper
and minor drug dealer, Ray (Saul), who gets caught with the stuff while
running away from the scene of his friend being shot. He is faced with
the decision of ratting out others and going free, copping a guilty plea
and getting two years, or of taking the case to court and if convicted
getting a ten year sentence.</P>
<P>In jail, Ray uses his slam poetry (a combination of rap, hip-hop, and
expressive non-traditional poetry) to save himself from being set upon,
as he discovers that freedom is in the mind of the beholder. Jail is a
perplexing place for this gentle soul, as he is bedazzled by  the
inhumanity and injustice of it.</P>
<P>He is noticed by an attractive, sensitive prison English teacher, a
reformed addict and prostitute, Lauren (Sonja), who starts a
relationship with him, intrigued by his poetic ability and the
desperation of his situation. These two non-professional actors give
this film the fiery performance, it sorely needs.</P>
<P>When he is bailed out of jail, he meets Sonja at her home, and realizes
that he has entered a new world, where the practice of non-violence
through his poetry is the best way out of his situation. The highlights
of the film come from the strong performance poetry readings by the
actual poets, where their poems are seen as innovative, and have a more
powerful feel to them than the liberal preachiness of the film does.</P>
<P>What makes the film seem somewhat foolish and improbable, is the
contrast of how real and menacing the authentic prison scenes looked and
of how artificial the message of non-violence is, when delivered by
those who lived their entire life in violence and are suddenly converted
by one slam poem into changing their ways. It does give the film an
uplifting message, but it was not believable in the context of this
story.</P>
<P>This film can be valued for the energy it spends on its performances,
the sharpness of its poetry, and the clarity of its cinematography.
There is hope for Ray, as he tries to survive and establish his art and
self-identity. There is, also, hope that this film can have a positive
affect on the young audience that sees it. But, it should be noted, this
is by no means cutting edge film making.</P>
