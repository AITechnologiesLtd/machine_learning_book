<PRE>Scary Movie </PRE>
<P>The title is no misnomer, what's so scary about this movie is that with all 
the easy targets for a zany spoof
comedy available and the backing of a major studio this is all they could 
come up with. </P>
<P>Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and written by Wayans among six or so other 
writers, this outrageous
comedy takes aim at the 90's horror movie genre and hits below the belt.... 
waaaay below the belt. You've
probably never seen so many lowbrow sex and genitalia jokes crammed into one 
movie before. The
comedic elements at play here at the over-the-top gags and really cruel black 
comedy that are so extreme
the film often comes off as a pure B-movie. It's a miracle the film avoided 
the NC-17 rating. </P>
<P>Be that as it may there's still some laughs to be found here, especially if 
you see it in a crowded movie
theater. It's the kind of comedy where the jokes work once and are powered by 
a big audience (if you catch
it on video in the fall you probably won't laugh at all). See it on the 
weekend for a good time for 90
minutes, but you won't exactly be enlightened or bettered in anyway by doing 
so. </P>
