<P>   What's it like to get a new identity and to be situated in a
place that would keep you well hidden from those who are out
to get you?  If you're a city mouse and you're sent to another
urban center far away, you're probably in luck.  If you're an
urbane con man accustomed to slick dealings with a
sophisticated clientele, the last thing you'd want if you're in
trouble with mobsters is a change of venue to L'il Abner
country.  The latter fate befalls Teddy (Johnathon Schaech) in
Stephan Elliot's new comedy, "Welcome to Woop Woop,"
which obeys the cardinal rule of anarchic buffoonery--which is
to be totally off-the-wall--but whose intentions (whatever they
might be) are not realized.  The movie with an alliterative and
pleonastic title embodies outrageous episodes of mayhem
and irrationality but the picture simply does not gel despite
Rod Taylor's zany impersonation of a tough, tattooed cult
leader named Daddy-O and a deft performance by Mr.
Schaech, who progresses through his outback adventure in a
perpetually bemused state, wondering why his relationship
with a gorgeous, sex-obsessed bimbo does not make him the
luckiest man alive.</P>
<P>   Opening his film in New York's Times Square where Teddy
is busy selling smuggled Australian cockatoos to well-heeled
bird lovers, director Stephan Elliott swiftly puts his leading
character through paces as he escapes from the clutches of
two gangsters and is forced to flee the country to elude
capture by others of their ilk.  After his Qantas flight, he
proceeds by van to the Australian outback when he is waylaid
by a stunning antipodean, Angie (Susie Porter), who exhausts
the poor man with her libidinous demands and who soon
thereafter finds himself unwittingly married to her and under
the iron thumb of her father-in-law, Daddy-O (Rod Taylor). 
Taking up residence in the godforsaken town of Woop Woop
which, according to the town's absolute ruler is "not on the
map as far as the 7 o'clock news is concerned," his fancy
turns eagerly to thoughts of escape.  Teddy is unimpressed
with his father-in-law's one-man rule, which forbids desertion
from the hot, fly-infested desert of inbred imbeciles but places
no ban on the shooting of dogs and defectors.</P>
<P>   "Welcome to Woop Woop" is cut from the same cloth as
Stephan Elliott's 1994 burlesque, "The Adventures of Priscilla,
Queen of the Desert," about two drag queens and a
transvestite who journey to a remote desert gig on a bus
named Priscilla, though in this case the traveler is a
reasonably balanced individual who wants only to return to
the benefits of civilization.  In a picture which would hardly be
promoted by the Australian Tourist Commission, Elliott tries to
be offensive as well as comic, but succeeds in being neither. 
Scenes such as one involving the pumping of gas by a blind
man (Barry Humphries) are derivative and, in fact, a good
deal of the time the off-the-map town may remind you of
similar locales in Kevin Costner's "The Postman."  </P>
<P>   Johnathon Schaech, who resembles Peter Gallagher, does
his best with the script as a lucid fellow in the company of the
demented, Owen Paterson does a fine job in designing a
production with houses built of beer cans and bottles, but the
best thing about "Welcome to Woop Woop" is the nostalgic
soundtrack of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs.  Some
enchanted evening this chop suey is not.  Not Rated. 
Running time: 101 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
