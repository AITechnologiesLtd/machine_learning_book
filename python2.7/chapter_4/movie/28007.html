<PRE>Cherry Falls
2000 - 92 minutes - Rated R
DVD Released March 20, 2001
Review by Dustin Putman</PRE>
<P>"Cherry Falls," directed by Geoffrey Wright (1992's "Romper Stomper"), was 
filmed in 1999 in Richmond, Virginia, with a healthy budget, support from USA 
Films, and a top-notch cast that included Brittany Murphy (1995's 
"Clueless"), Jay Mohr (1999's "Go"), Jesse Bradford (2000's "Bring It On"), 
Michael Biehn (2000's "The Art of War"), and even a then-unknown D.J. Qualls 
(the skinny, nerdy boy in 2000's "Road Trip"). Originally scheduled for 
theatrical release in the summer of 2000, followed by a date change to 
September, the MPAA got in the way, threatening the picture with an NC-17. 
Recut five times before receiving an R rating, the movie ultimately premiered 
in the U.S. on the USA television network, even while it was doing healthy 
theatrical business overseas. The unfair, unjust censorship of America may 
have destroyed the chances of "Cherry Falls" being financially successful 
stateside, but now that it is out on DVD (in a double feature format that 
also includes the direct-to-video John Ritter thriller, "Terror Tract"), it 
would be foolish to pass up what is essentially the scariest, smartest 
slasher movie since 1996's "Scream."</P>
<P>In the small, idyllic Virginia town of Cherry Falls, teenage students of 
Thomas Jefferson High School have begun falling victim to a long-haired, 
fingernail-polish/high-heel-wearing killer who seems to be targeting virgins. 
When the town sheriff (Michael Biehn) suspects this pattern, he begins 
fearing for his own 16-year-old daughter, Jody (Brittany Murphy). With the 
school abuzz about innocence leading to death, a mass orgy party is planned 
where the slasher predictably makes a special appearance.</P>
<P>Stylish, suspenseful, and unusually intelligent for a genre movie, "Cherry 
Falls" is an excellent example of how to make a horror movie, in the vein of 
John Carpenter's 1978 classic, "Halloween," right. There is generous 
bloodshed to be had, and occasional violence, but the film is also equipped 
with emotional truths and realistic, believable characters. In the Jamie Lee 
Curtis role, the ever-talented Brittany Murphy places at least ten notches 
above the rest of the recent horror movie heroines. Murphy paints Jody with 
several different shades, and turns her into a three-dimensional individual. 
Jay Mohr also stands out as a much-liked teacher at school, as does Candy 
Clark (1985's "Cat's Eye") as Jody's loving, but confused, mother.</P>
<PRE>DVD Review</PRE>
<P>How Does It Look?
Presented in a 1:77:1 aspect ratio widescreen transfer, the picture on 
"Cherry Falls" sparkles with surprising detail for a relatively low-budget 
feature, and does absolute justice to the beautiful, atmospheric 
cinematography by Anthony B. Richmond. Black levels are very good, and the 
color of red, which is an ongoing theme, bursts off the screen. There is 
slight grain in several of the darker moments, but it is brief and remains 
undistractive. A highly impressive transfer.</P>
<P>How Does It Sound?
In the opening scene, the sound, in English 2.0, concerned me. The dialogue 
was difficult to understand with precision, and sounded muffled. Luckily, it 
was very likely the way the characters were speaking, because this problem 
cleared up immediately afterwards. While not overly dynamic (much of the 
movie is intentionally quiet, save for the action and suspense scenes), the 
music and dialogue play well off one another, neither ever overpowering the 
other.</P>
<P>Special Features?
Unfortunately, "Cherry Falls" offers no special features (unless you call 
"scene selections" bonus material). There isn't even a trailer, which is 
unfortunate, although there are production notes on the inside booklet that 
comes with the disc. An audio commentary would have been highly appreciated, 
but this movie's DVD treatment, much like its theatrical one, was obviously 
not taken as seriously as it should have been.</P>
<P>The Lowdown
While the special features are non-existent, "Cherry Falls" is such a good, 
overlooked movie that it is able to stand on its own. With it being offered 
as two movies for the price of one, with the full-length picture, "Terror 
Tract," and selling for only $24.99, the DVD is one that is recommended for 
all horror fans. In "Cherry Falls," you will find a slasher opus that does 
not disappoint.</P>
