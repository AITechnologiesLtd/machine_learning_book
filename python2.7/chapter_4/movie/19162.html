<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>TARZAN</PRE>
<PRE>Me Tarzan...you happy viewer.</PRE>
<P>For a minute there, I thought I was going to be groaning over the
release of Disney's latest, another adaptation of a legend from the
past.  (Remember the pathetic Pocahontas?  Yikes!)  But guess what-
Disney, a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films,
strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well
as the inner kid in you.</P>
<P>The story is pretty basic- Tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla
who's lost her young adopts him into her group.  As he matures into a
much older man, Tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different
from the clan, and then arrives a hunter, a professor, and the
professor's lovely daughter, Jane- who meets Tarzan rather quickly after
getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons.  From there, Tarzan
faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with
or go join his own kind in England?</P>
<P>The voicework here is pretty top-level.  Tony Goldwyn is very convincing
as the Ape Man; Minnie Driver adds a delectable touch to the
already-beautiful Jane; Nigel Hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter
voice; Rosie O' Donnell keeps the laughs rolling as Tarzan's best ape
friend Terk; and Wayne "Newman" Knight has his moments as a panicky
elephant.</P>
<P>The movie is superb throughout, mixing a great script with incredible
computer-assisted visuals.  When Tarzan tree-surfs (a twist that was
added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one, I might
add), the camera twists and turns, allowing the trees all around to come
to life vividly.  I couldn't believe my eyes- Disney has come a long way
since starting in a ballroom for Beauty and the Beast.</P>
<P>And the music's not half bad, either.  Fortunately, there's no
ridiculous singing characters here, just a great set of songs by Phil
Collins that perfectly fit the mood.</P>
<P>There's some great action sequences here as well, including a
wonderfully done chase between Tarzan, Jane, and the aforementioned
babboons.  But, of course, it's not all action- there's a message here
as well that has to do with family.</P>
<P>This is easily one of Disney's best animated films of the decade and
it's one I can't wait to put in my home library...that is, if my VCR
still works in the year 2000.</P>
