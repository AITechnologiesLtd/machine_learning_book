Reviewed November 9, 1998.</P>
<P>"Torch Song Trilogy," based on a popular Broadway play by Harvey 
Fierstein, is an earnest, emotionally accurate, but seriously flawed 
drama. </P>
<P>The film is a character study of Arnold Beckoff (played without a false 
note by Fierstein), a man working as a drag queen who always knew he was 
gay, and wasn't afraid to show it. Beginning in 1971 after a small 
prologue, Arnold meets Ed (Brian Kerwin) at a bar and they immediately 
hit it off, but Ed immediately lets it be known that he is also 
interested in women, even though we sense it is only because he is 
afraid to come out to his family and friends. After things get too 
complicated for Ed, he leaves him, and Arnold is seeked out by a much 
younger fasion model, Alan (Matthew Broderick), who meets him at the 
club where Arnold works as the drag queen. Things begin to look up for 
Arnold, but tragedy strikes just as he begins to believe that he finally 
has found true love. Although on the surface, Arnold seems very secure 
with his sexuality, we begin to sense that he is hurting very much 
underneath because he knows that his mother (Anne Bancroft) secretly 
wishes he had never been born.</P>
<P>"Torch Song Trilogy" would be an examplary motion picture, if not for 
its many problems. It is serious and well acted by all, but the gay 
characters are mostly stereotypical, which is a surprise, since 
Fierstein, a homosexual in real life, wrote it. All of the people are 
portrayed as very promiscuous, and although this may have been the case 
in the 70's, before AIDS surfaced, it still feels a little too trite.
Another problem is that time moves way too fast throughout. At some 
points, three to five years will pass between certain scenes, which 
disappointed me since a lot of major events had happened, we find out, 
off-screen. This is no doubt because the film had to come in at two 
hours, but it still felt a little rushed. Many of the plot points could 
also be easily predicted, especially the untimely fate of Alan, which is 
clumsily telegraphed well in advance. </P>
<P>Many moments in "Torch Song Trilogy," do ring true, however, despite its 
faults, and I suspect it is largely due to Fierstein brilliant 
performance. I have never seen him have such a juicy role before, and he 
pulls it off flawlessly. Karen Young, in a supporting role as Ed's 
sympathetic wife, also adds a lot of humanity to all of her scenes, 
although I wish she would have had more to do. A confrontational 
penultimate sequence is also very well-done, between Fierstein and 
Bancroft.</P>
<P>"Torch Song Trilogy" is full of good intentions, and has a fair share of 
strong points, so it is especially disappointing that Fierstein hadn't 
changed some of the weaker elements in the screenplay. I don't know how 
this material worked on a stage, but as a film, it is well-done in many 
respects, but could have been much more.</P>
