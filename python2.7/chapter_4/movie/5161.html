<PRE>                              SISTER MY SISTER
                       A film review by Jason Becker
                        Copyright 1996 Jason Becker</PRE>
<P>This is an excellent film from Director Nancy Meckler. An adaptation of a true 
story of two sisters who become lovers; the performances by Joely Richardson 
and Jodhi May (the sisters) are inspiring. The intimacy between the two is 
touching and beautiful (and erotic). I especially liked the direction of these 
scenes - in particular, the breathing of the sister Lea.</P>
<P>The most convincing true love story since The Professional's Leon and Matilda.</P>
<P>I must also praise the screenplay. I thought that I might have to be 
patient with this film but that wasn't the case at all! From beginning to 
end the film had me hooked. </P>
<PRE>This really is a must-see!</PRE>
