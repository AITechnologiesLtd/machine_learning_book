<P>     COLOR OF A BRISK AND LEAPING DAY won a deserved cinematography 
award at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival.  This movie, shot in black-
and-white, makes brilliant use of grays and shadows to create a tapestry 
of unparalleled visual impact.  Unfortunately, the tale unfolded by 
these images is both pedestrian and incomplete, with a number of 
frustrating narrative holes that writer/director Christopher Munch feels 
no need to plug.</P>
<P>     This is the story of "John Lee, Railroad Man" (Peter Alexander).  
Lee, an Asian American living in post-World War II California, is 
concerned about the possible demise of the 78-mile long Yosemite Valley 
Rail Road, which has been in operation since 1907.  Despite his father's 
almost-contemptuous skepticism, Lee throws all of his efforts into 
saving the railroad from liquidation.  When he finds a financial backer, 
Lee takes over the day-to-day operations himself.  But even his 
enthusiasm can't stop the inevitable.</P>
<P>     Although the main storyline concentrates on the railroad, COLOR OF 
A BRISK AND LEAPING DAY is more about Lee's awakening.  Before he comes 
to Yosemite, his life is without direction, he's involved in an 
incestuous relationship with his sister, and he's unable to admit love 
for any woman.  Once away from his family and involved in a cause that 
engages his passion as well as his skills, he becomes a new person.  No 
longer emotionally crippled, he is able to fall in love and live a full, 
healthy life.</P>
<P>     Despite a certain thematic richness, COLOR OF A BRISK AND LEAPING 
DAY has a multitude of problems.  It does such a poor job of 
illustrating Lee's various relationships (with his parents, his sister, 
and his girlfriend) that they all feel contrived.  In fact, there's 
virtually no interpersonal interaction that exhibits any semblance of 
emotional depth.  Characters come and go with frustrating irregularity.  
We never have much of a feeling for anyone except Lee, and he's such a 
cold fish that his supposed passion for the railroad is never 
effectively conveyed.  Actor Peter Alexander, who plays the lead, is a 
study in blandness.</P>
<P>     The film is a visual marvel, especially considering its meager 
budget.  Archive footage is blended seamlessly with new material, making 
it seem like Munch had a lot more money to work with.  Ultimately, 
however, it's difficulty for me to summon up much enthusiasm for this 
picture.  If you search hard enough, good cinematography isn't that 
difficult to come by; good stories are.  COLOR OF A BRISK AND LEAPING 
DAY has the former, but not the latter.</P>
