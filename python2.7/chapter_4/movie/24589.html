<PRE>THE VIRGIN SUICIDES
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        When Sofia Coppola landed the key role as Mary Corleone in the
final chapter of her father Francis Ford Coppola's legendary "Godfather"
trilogy, the cries of nepotism could be heard as far away as the Hollywood
Hills.  Overt familial favoritism notwithstanding, the greater outcry was
that Sofia simply wasn't good enough and for many, single-handedly ruined
the picture.</P>
<P>        In the ten years since "The Godfather: Part III," the 29-year-old
actress has had few film roles--she's appeared as Cindy in "Inside Monkey
Zetterland," as herself in Dad's documentary "Hearts of Darkness: A
Filmmaker's Apocalypse," and as Saché in last year's "Star Wars" prequel to
name the sum-total.  In short, she's done very little and failed to make
much of an impression.</P>
<PRE>        But with "The Virgin Suicides," all that is about to change.</PRE>
<P>        Switching to behind the camera as both writer and director, Coppola
might well have found her niche.  Skeptics will be quick to question just
how much of the finished product is Sofia's handiwork, given her bloodline
and insider connections, but the film plays very much *unlike* a Francis
Ford Coppola movie and in some ways that's a finer compliment than calling
her a chip off the old block.</P>
<P>        "The Virgin Suicides" is a deliberately-paced (or "slow" if you're
predisposed to cynicism) gothic fantasy about the ill-fated Lisbon
sisters--Cecilia, Bonnie, Lux, Mary, and Therese--told from the vantage of
the neighborhood boys who worshipped them from afar.  It's a fragile and
delicate affair, as fragile and delicate as the teenage female condition it
examines.  The film shimmers, breathes, and moves both on air and with Air,
since it's scored by the French avant-pop duo with a sparing insistence.</P>
<P>        The film is all the better for posing more questions than answers,
since its theme--the universal dilemma of young women struggling with their
blossoming sexuality--is not easily concluded.  The five young actresses,
among them Kirsten Dunst as the bold Lux, are fabulous, as are veterans
James Woods and a surrealistically frumpy-looking Kathleen Turner as their
parents.  Woods, especially, is remarkable since he rarely plays soft and
his Mr. Lisbon is a treasure of paternal quirks and insecurities.</P>
<P>        Behind the lens, Coppola's direction is sure-footed, her pacing
perfect.  And the power, wit, and calculated efficacy of her insightful
screenplay (based on the novel by Jeffrey Eugenides) can best be summed up
by a single line of dialogue.  Shortly after her first failed suicide
attempt, the youngest Lisbon daughter tells a male caregiver who falsely
assumes that everything is OK now "obviously, doctor, you've never been a
13-year-old girl."</P>
<P>        Watching the splendid "The Virgin Suicides," it's quite obvious
that Sofia Coppola has.</P>
