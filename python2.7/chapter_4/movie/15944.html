<P>PECKER (New Line)
Directed by John Waters
 Once renowned as the man behind such cinematic atrocies as "Pink Flamingos"
and "Female Trouble," writer-director John Waters has gradually eased into
the mainstream during the past decade, first with his 1988 "Hairspray," the
movie that brought Ricki Lake to prominence, and then with the lavish 1990
musical "Cry Baby," showcasing Johnny Depp, a film that plays like an
acid-soaked "Grease." Most recently, Waters gave Kathleen Turner her best
role in ages when he cast the femme fatale as the title character in 1994's
"Serial Mom," the story of a housewife who resorts to murder to solve her
domestic troubles. Fans of "Flamingos" will probably gripe that "Pecker" is
diluted Waters, but there's more than enough disturbing behavior and
off-the-wall satire here to shock the faint-of-heart and delight those who
enjoy the director's quirky sense of fun.
 Despite the pornographic-sounding title, "Pecker" is no skin flick. It
does, however, manage to detail exactly what is involved in what male
dancers call "teabagging," and to include the only voting booth sex scene in
any film in recent memory. The action is underscored by songs by such 1950s
novelty acts as The Nutty Squirrels and The Henhouse Five Plus One, which
should give you an idea of how seriously the author takes his material.
 In his short career, Edward Furlong has been known to suffer from the Daryl
Hannah Syndrome: He's only as strong as his director. Working with a James
Cameron in "Terminator 2" or Tony Kaye in "American History X," Furlong can
excel; under lesser talents, he generally flounders. Waters knows how to
bring out Furlong's goofy/grungy appeal -- here, Furlong has the silly grin
and wobbly voice of a little boy who managed to break into Daddy's liquor
cabinet -- and the character of Pecker, a happy-go-lucky amateur
photographer who is literally an overnight sensation among the culture
vultures of New York's art scene, seems tailor-made for the actor.
 Waters has also handed juicy parts to Christina Ricci, who's divinely sour
as Shelly, a laundromat manager who treats stains and customers with equal
severity, and Martha Plimpton, a solid riot as Pecker's sister Tina who
operates a bar specializing in "trade" dancers and who almost dies of grief
when a burglar makes off with her prized Liza Minnelli CDs. Brendan Sexton
III, best known as the scuzzy delinquent of "Welcome to the Dollhouse," is
utterly charming and quite funny as shoplifting ace Matt, Pecker's best
friend.
 In terms of its content, "Pecker" breaks little new ground in Waters'
world. It's set in and around Baltimore -- his locale of choice -- and
involves class clashes (as in "Hairspray" and "Cry Baby"), unsavory
businesses (like "Polyester") and slightly twisted but kindly folk, such as
Pecker's mom (Mary Kay Place), who runs a thrift store that puts
streetpeople into colorful new outfits. There are also a few gross-out
moments along the way, most of them involving either food or vermin.
Although "Pecker" rarely hits the comic heights of Waters' best films (his
movies just haven't had the same zing since the passing of his premiere
leading lady Divine in 1988) and it will do nothing to convert those who
abhor Walters and what he represents, it's a solid example of the director's
rude but good-natured style.
