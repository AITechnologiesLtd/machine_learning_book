SAY IT ISN'T SO!
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>SAY IT ISN'T SO! is another comedic misfire produced by the Farrelly 
brothers (ME, MYSELF & IRENE).  Although there are a few good laughs in 
it, most of the film stays at the crudely unfunny level with jokes about 
a wife who uses her armpits to salt her husband's food and a guy who 
gets his arm stuck up a cow's anus.  "Saturday Night Live" writer Peter 
Gaulke and first-time writer Gerry Swallow also look for sources of 
humor in the repeated theft of the artificial legs belonging to an 
amputee (Orlando Jones) and in the constant humiliation of a stroke 
patient (Richard Jenkins).  First-time director James B. Rogers's next 
film is AMERICAN PIE II.  I can hardly wait.</P>
<P>When we meet animal control officer Gilly Noble, played with 
mind-numbing blandness by Chris Klein (AMERICAN PIE), he is looking for 
the love of his life, one who will produce goose bumps all over his 
body.  When he first lays eyes on the town's new hairstylist, Jo 
Wingfield, who hacks up hair with all of the skill of a drunken barber 
at work on the high seas, Gilly is covered in goose bumps.  Heather 
Graham (BOWFINGER) is fairly wasted as Jo since the script gives her 
little to do other than smile a lot with the intensity and honesty of a 
politician looking for votes.  </P>
<P>Sacrificing more than just his hair to the cause, Gilly works his way 
into Jo's heart and bed.  But -- surprise! -- he turns out to be her 
brother.  And, even bigger surprise, he really isn't.  (These "twists" 
happen early on and have been given away by all of the trailers.) </P>
<P>The body of the movie has Gilly trying to win Jo back before she marries 
Jack Mitchelson (Eddie Cibrian), the evil philanthropist of the 
close-knit town of Beaver, Oregon.  Working against Gilly is Jo's bad 
mother, played by Sally Field in a performance that is itself quite bad.  </P>
<P>In the spirit of full disclosure, there were a couple of scenes that 
were so surprising and shocking that I did laugh loudly.  The best of 
these involves a dinner table discussion at the home of Gilly's boss.  
It is the show and tell part of the meal that I found so funny.  And 
finally, the ending is cute even if somewhat predictable.  It is also 
one of the few times in which they effectively use Graham's gift for 
innocent sexuality.  </P>
<P>Wait for video and keep your finger by the fast forward button.</P>
<P>SAY IT ISN'T SO! runs just 1:33 but feels longer.  It is rated R for 
strong sexual content, crude humor and language and would be acceptable 
for older teenagers.</P>
