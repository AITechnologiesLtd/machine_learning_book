<PRE>"American History X"</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by Tony Kaye. Written by David McKenna. Starring Edward Norton,
with Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks, and Stacy Keach. 1998, 119 min., Rated R.</P>
<P>     "American History X" gained publicity when director Tony Kaye publicly
denounced the version that was going to be distributed. He wanted his name to
be removed, and 'Humpty Dumpty' put in it's place, claiming that the film's
star, Edward Norton ("Primal Fear," "Rounders"), had re-edited it to give
himself more screen time. Ultimately, the movie would gain more publicity when
Norton garnered an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His performance is
truly stirring; the saving grace of a story with tremendous potential because
of it's social relevance, but one that fails to rise above average.</P>
<P>     Daniel Vinyard (Edward Furlong, "Pecker") is a high school student who
turned in a report about Hitler's "Mien Kampf." His alarmed teacher takes the
paper to Principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks), who calls Daniel into his office and
tells him that from now on he will report to Sweeney for a class called
American History X. By the next morning Daniel must have turned in to him a new
report, this time about his older brother, Derek (Norton). Earlier in the day,
Derek had been released from prison after doing time for killing two young
black men whom he'd caught breaking into his car a few years ago.</P>
<P>     Daniel arrives home and we're given a more formal introduction to his
apparently racist background. His mother Doris (Beverly D'Angelo), sister
Davina (Jennifer Lien), and younger sister, are fawning over Derek. The
brother's hug and Daniel shows Derek a white power tattoo. Derek wants to know
when he got it, and doesn't seem pleased. Seth (Ethan Suplee), the token
hulking idiot of their circle of acquaintances, arrives, and he, too, is given
an inexplicably chilly reception by Derek, who obviously has other things on
his mind.</P>
<P>     As Daniel writes his report, black and white flashbacks of what happened
the night Derek was arrested begin. The flashbacks comprise a large part of the
one-minute less than two hour running time of the movie. Derek's mysterious
behavior continues when he tells Daniel not to go the party that is being
thrown that night for the white supremacist group at the home of Cameron
Alexander (Stacy Keach). Of course, Daniel goes anyway, and is shocked and
feeling betrayed when Derek has a private confrontation with Cameron that
escalates into Seth pointing a gun at Derek, who runs from the angry group that
had, just moments earlier, been proclaiming him a hero for having killed the
would-be burglars.</P>
<P>     When Daniel catches up with him, we're treated to some more flashbacks
that attempt to more fully explain Derek's change of heart. Turns out,
unsurprisingly, that he wasn't as big a hit in the slammer as he had been with
the groups he used to cheer into frenzied race-motivated attacks by simply
standing on his soapbox and being the rhetorical ringmaster to a bunch of
misguided teens. He was a recruiter and did Cameron's dirty work, something he
didn't realize until his stint in jail, during which he was raped and became
close friends with his secret protector, Lamont (played terrifically by Guy
Torry). All of this opened up his eyes, and he turned to Sweeney, who had once
been a man he greatly respected, for help.</P>
<P>     When Derek is through telling Daniel about what 'changed' him, the flaws
in the story become more noticeable, mainly because Daniel is so willing to
accepting of Derek's reasons, and himself reforms. The next morning, Derek has
an appointment with his parole officer, and is eager to get his life back on
track by obtaining his old job position, and he stops with Daniel, who is on
his way to school, to get a cup of coffee. Sweeney and a police officer show
up, in need of Derek's help. Cameron had been beaten badly the night before,
and they need Derek to get to the bottom of things. Derek reluctantly agrees,
telling Sweeney, "You're going to get me killed by a bunch of white boys."</P>
<P>     Foreshadowing has been evident up to this point, with Derek looking a bit
ill at ease before he even entered the coffee shop. But as he sees Daniel off
in front of the school building, the impending sense of doom is palpable. If
this synopsis seems short, let me assure you that it basically covers the
entire film, except for a short incident at the beginning that is pertinent to
the ending, I left it out because it would definitely be a spoiler. Even so,
considering the running time not very much happens. The 'present-time' actions
occur in color and within a very short (24 hour) time frame, and the
flashbacks, tastefully done in black and white, span from Derek's high school
years to his final day in prison.</P>
<P>     Furlong is solid as Daniel, but it is the amazing performance of Norton
that keeps "American History X" from lapsing into a tired story. The biggest
fault of the script is that believable reason for what led to the racist views
and actions of the Vinyard boys is never explained. Instead, an ill-conceived
dinner table scene has their murdered father, Dennis (William Russ of TV's "Boy
Meets World") explain "affirmative black-tion" to Derek, who had just told the
family about Sweeney, a double Ph.D. holder and great teacher, who was having
the class read "Native Son." What Dennis said, and how Derek had been portrayed
as up to that point, don't come close to adding up to the hate Derek harbored
towards non-Aryans.</P>
<P>     Lacking motivation, the characters wouldn't be believable at all if not
for the acting. Furlong gives his Daniel a depth that, while really only
extending towards trust, admiration, but also residual pain from the horror of
what he witnessed his fallen-hero older brother do to the intruders on the
night of the murders. And Norton's often chilling performance provides one of
the scariest cinematic scenes in recent memory; that of Derek's look of triumph
as he is arrested after the killings. Additional cliched characters include
Stacey (Fairuza Balk), Derek's ex-girlfriend, Murray (Elliott Gould), the
teacher from the beginning and an ex-boyfriend of the equally cliched ill
Doris, and the liberal sister (Lien). The supporting cast does what they can
with their underdeveloped roles. D'Angelo, Brooks, Torry, and Suplee in
particular, but the real supporting standout is Stacy Keach as the disgustingly
cowardly bigot Cameron.</P>
<P>     The most frighteningly realistic aspect of the story is that, while it
never convinces us why the main character(s) joined the neo-Nazis, it is very
convincing in it's depiction of insecure teens who feel a need to belong, and
find that sense of belonging in unabashed hatred. Charismatic recruiter Derek
isn't the kind of Bible-thumping Grand Dragon that appears on cheap talk shows,
he is a poised, passionate, and fervently articulate and captivating speaker.
Even those who disagree with his ideas listen, though incredulously, and are,
like Murray in a flashback scene, still resigned to the fact that nothing can
be done about it.</P>
<P>     In spite of the lackluster script (which admittedly may have come across
as a bad story because of the editing. Unless the Kaye-approved version is over
released, that may never be known), "American History X" is an engrossing film
that deserves to be seen. After seeing this, I'm looking forward to seeing
future work of director Kaye, who first made a name for himself directing
commercials. He also served as cinematographer, with impressive results. Shots
that are alternately stylish and gritty add a realistic touch that is otherwise
only visible through the performance of Norton.</P>
<P>     Brought to DVD by the New Line folks, renowned for their excellent
Platinum Series, of which "American History X" is not a part, the disc is, as
expected, an excellent package. The picture quality, for both the color and
black and white sequences, is crisp and clear. Presented only in widescreen,
also enhanced for 16x9 (widescreen) televisions, and in it's original 1.85:1
aspect ratio, it is another great transfer from New Line. The sound is also
very good (5.1 Surround or Surround). The supplements include, beside the usual
interactive menus, three deleted scenes (two are about a minute or less and
fairly inconsequential, another scene which explains what happened to Cameron
runs about five minutes long), the original theatrical trailer (widescreen),
and biographies and filmographies of the cast and crew.</P>
<P>     Notes: Rated R for graphic brutal violence, pervasive language, nudity,
and sexuality.</P>
<P>     DVD Details: Snap case.  Widescreen (16x9 enhanced) featuring three
deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, and cast and crew biographies
and filmographies.</P>
<P>     The Verdict: "American History X" is a stirring drama, and marks the
beginning of a promising career on behalf of director Tony Kaye. The story is
uneven, but Edward Norton's brilliant portrayal of a young neo-Nazi who's time
in prison forces him to reevaluate where hatred has gotten him in life is
reason enough to view this film. For optimum picture and sound quality, the DVD
is very highly recommended.
