<PRE>.                                ELIZABETH
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Seeing ELIZABETH on the day of the impeachment of President Clinton
was a bit strange, but it did put things in perspective.</P>
<P>     450 years ago, no one would've thought a thing about a little
intern boinking. Today, that's obviously big news, and it should have
made the sexual, political, and religious escapades of ELIZABETH all the
more thrilling.</P>
<P>     Too bad it doesn't. The tumultuous tale of young Elizabeth I's
(Cate Blanchett) rise to power in the mid 1500's, we are treated to a
two hour trip through her battles with the French, a number of suitors,
the Pope, the Spanish, underhanded lords, and other nefarious types.</P>
<P>     The problem is this all comes off as too cliquish, with Britons the
obvious wink-wink insiders in all of this, as is typically the case with
movies about roylaty. Despite a rash of good performances, lush
camerawork, and great costumes, ELIZABETH is just too stand-offish to
really get into.</P>
