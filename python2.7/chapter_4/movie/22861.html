<PRE>THE CUP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>A coke can as soccer ball? If you're a monk who's taken a vow to
renounce worldly possessions, then you make do with whatever's handy, as
do the poor Tibetan monks living in exile in India in THE CUP (PHÖRPA).</P>
<P>Writer/director Khyentse Norbu's THE CUP is an innocent little picture
that suffers from being a one-idea movie. If the characters in it were
not monks, then the only reaction would be to write off the formulaic
picture as a lame and amateurish version of the kids' big game movie
that has been done hundreds of times before and usually much better.
Whether the mere fact that the cast is composed of monks can supply
enough charm to make you ignore all of its shortcomings, only you can
judge. For myself, the charm quickly wore thin.</P>
<P>Set during the World Cup finals, the story concerns a group of the
younger monks who sneak out at night to go watch the games on television
in a nearby village. When it comes time for the final match, the soccer
fanatics try to get the Abbot (Lama Chonjor) to approve their renting a
television setup, including a near-broken satellite dish, so that the
whole abbey can watch the game. Geko (Orgyen Tobgyal) explains the game
to the Abbot as "two civilized nations fighting over a ball." Sounding
harmless enough, he gives permission for the event.</P>
<P>Ending in the traditional big game, this time a televised one, the
predictable movie has few surprises. As soon as you see their rag-tag
electronics setup, you know they'll have trouble with it. And given the
feel-good tone of the story, you can be sure that it will be resolved
successfully.</P>
<P>THE CUP runs 1:33. The film is in Tibetan and Hindi with English
subtitles. It is rated G and would be suitable for all ages.</P>
