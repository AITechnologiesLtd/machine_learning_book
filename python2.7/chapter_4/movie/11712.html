<P>It is films like this that redefine what films are made for. And it typifies
the attitude that is the European community, versus the American style of
action pictures that are vacuous. They may have a lot of clever things in
it, but they have little substance.</P>
<P>ANTONIA'S LINE may not have much action, the film is very slow, but it does
have charm, character, passion, and beauty, and on top of it, a magnificent
story, and outline.  Antonia has moved back into town, because her mother is
on her final days. She has come into town without a husband, and with a
daughter of marrying  age.  They both immediately become the talk of the
town and the immediate
attention of all the members that want to mix with the two women. But,
unlucky for them, both women are independent and do not spend much time at
the usual lifestyle of mating and making children,  which seems all that the
whole community has to live for.</P>
<P>The town is an incredible hodgepodge of characters, that are totaly out
there, which makes the film even more enjoyable. And how they all blend in
is rather funny.  Antonia's daughter, one day decides that she wants a
child, but does not want a husband. They end up in the city, where her
daughter visits a brothel and gets together with a man who is one of the
owner's favorite lovers, and probable father of at least one of her
children. Of course, the daughter gets pregnant and this starts the film on
chapter two. We find that the daughter is gay, and she now lives with her
friend. And other matches are made in the village, including one young man
who is a bit slow. And eventually, Antonia also gets in the mood, and takes
on a lover, a man about her age, who has a miriad of sons, and no wife to
help him raise his children. She has not allowed anything to come to pass
between her and him, for years. And when it finally happens, the film is all
aglow. Everyone is happy, and everyone has a lover/wife/husband and  the
there are no worries anywhere.</P>
<P>And then the film turns. Antonia's grandchild grows to be a young woman that
is head and shoulders above most of anyone, and has a tutor, who is the
town's lonely man, always buried in his books and studies. In school the
young lady even embarrasses a teacher because he is not capable and
intelligent enough to see what is happening. The whole class ends up leaving
the room, after the girl's lead.</P>
<P>But this girl, one day meets a rather somber moment in life. She gets raped
by one of the village guys, who thinks that he is better than most. And this
is dealt with in a very harsh manner, but considering what he did, it may be
thought of as some sort of justice.</P>
<P>The film progresses, and ends on a somber note. The town's tutor, is a sad,
disappointed man, who apparently had fallen in love with Antonia, but she
did not respond. He has his only smile in the whole film in the beginning
when she returns to the village.  This kinda brings the film to an end.
Antonia's grandgranddaughter, is the one telling us the story, and we
finally notice why the characters are so
strange. They are basically seen through a child's eyes, and the
punishments, and the events all come and go with the same horrific flavor
that this film brings forth. It seems that the events are all very
important, and  they all have serious consequences as to the chain of
events.</P>
<P>But none, take away from the enjoyment of this film. It just won't quit,
even in the end, when you shut the video player down, and the film is still
in your mind... wonder what all this is about. By the style of directing and
story telling, the film is not about anything in particular. It covers three
generations, and it displays problems that each of these generations has had
with its own growth and time. But these
problems never stop the growth of it all. and as the film says in the end,
nothing "has come to an end".... except this fine film, with so many
excellent moments.</P>
<P>Of special interest and fun here, are the priest and his turn around. He is
probably set up, because he is a dirty old fart anyway, but it is all for
the best. And who he ends up with is a treat. One could say that there are
meanings here and there, but all in all, these are understated as a part of
the whole picture, which is the whole film. Yes, we can say that there are
pointed moments, and statements, but when one does that, this film loses
some of its really precious moments. Like Antonia's daughter and grand
daughter always seeing things happening... in the oddest of moments... and
these bits are so enjoyable that it is hard to fault a film for anything
else.</P>
<P>Well thought out, beautifully written, and worth seeing.</P>
