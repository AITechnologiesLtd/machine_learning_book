<PRE>Switchblade Sisters (R) ***</PRE>
<P>In recent years, the exploitation film--cheap, sensationalist
no-budget offerings filled with violence, sex, nudity, and horrific
acting--have been relegated to direct-to-video status.  The resurfacing of
Jack Hill's 1975 Switchblade Sisters, reissued by Quentin Tarantino's
Rolling Thunder division of Miramax, shows that this genre's true home is on
the big screen, where its hilarious, immensely enjoyable camp charms can be
shared with an audience.</P>
<P>The basic premise of Switchblade Sisters is a power struggle within
the girl gang the Dagger Debs between leader Lace (Robbie Lee, whose squeaky
Lori Petty voice and ferocious line delivery make an interesting
contradiction) and newcomer Maggie (Joanne Nail).  But to leave it at that
would to discount the surprisingly inspired plotting by screenwriter F.X.
Maier, who weaves a complex web of gang wars both between gangs and within
them; in fact, one-eyed Dagger Deb Patch's (Monica Gayle) psychological
manipulation of Lace more than recalls Iago's scheming in Othello.  This is
not so say, however, that the exploitation staples aren't in abundance, and
they are: there are the requisite violent action scenes, including a rousing
street gunfight, a roller rink shootout, and a killer closing knife fight;
there more than a share of hilarious, quotable lines (my fave being "If you
go, it's gonna turn out bad!"; and the acting is as uproariously
over-the-top as can be imagined.  The opening half hour, in which the Debs
are arrested and spend time in jail with an abusive lesbian guard, is so
hilarious, so trashy, and so utterly enjoyable that it truly must be seen to
be believed.</P>
<P>Unlike recent howlfests such as Judge Dredd and, most notably,
Showgirls, the filmmakers are very self-aware, knowing they are making fun
trash.  Director Hill keeps his tongue firmly in cheek, tossing in throwaway
bits, such as a guy who suddenly drops his head onto a table, that show he's
far from playing it with a straight face.  The free rein he gives to his
thespians is not a sloppy move, but a deliberate, defendable choice--the
actors are, after all, playing histrionic teens (though the actresses look
well into their 20s, the actors over 30).  Camp sensibility aside, Hill is
also an efficient filmmaker, keeping the action moving and telling the
complicated story clearly and swiftly.  Switchblade Sisters is rather short,
but it certainly doesn't feel that way (but not necessarily slow) once it's
over because so much was compacted into a mere 90 minutes.  It is also
important to note that while this is an "exploitation" film, Hill shows an
unexpected restraint, leaving the most violent or "naughty" bits to the
imagination.  The fact that the film still satisfies as "exploitation" is
another testament to Hill's skill.</P>
<P>A number of people won't understand the appeal of Switchblade
Sisters, but those with a healthy appetite for fun, campy, exploitative
trash are sure to get their money's worth.<HR></P>
