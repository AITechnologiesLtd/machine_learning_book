<P>The hit man has no name. People in the neighbourhood just call him 'ghost 
dog'. He lives on the roof of a New York City apartment block, in an iron 
shack, surrounded by pigeons. His only friend is a Haitian ice-cream vendor 
who does not speak his language. Completely disconnected from reality, he 
uses the code of ancient samurai warriors as a guide on how to conduct his 
life and work.</P>
<P>"Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" was written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, 
the perfect and perhaps only filmmaker for this material. He's fascinated by 
the quietly insane, or at least the quirky outsiders, of society. Think of 
the layabouts in "Stranger Than Paradise", the mixed bag of oddballs in 
"Mystery Train", the trio of plodding inept crooks in "Down By Law". Good old 
Jim has dedicated his career to looking at nutcases with a tender grin.</P>
<P>In "Ghost Dog", he makes clear that the plot will contain no surprises, so he 
can devote his attention to observing little details. The early scenes show 
us that Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) does contract killings for a gang of 
Italian mobsters. He feels indebted to one of their number for saving his 
life when he was a kid. For reasons I wasn't really paying attention to, it 
is decided that Ghost Dog himself must die, and by the end of the movie, of 
course, this is what's going to happen.</P>
<P>As ever, Jarmusch's pace is slow, and his camera stays pretty much 
stationary. Scenes are deliberately flat, lending a poignancy to the pathetic 
atmosphere all the characters live in, and also a comedic contrast to the 
topsy-turvy nature of the things going on. Realistic foibles are thrust onto 
action-adventure set-ups: The film is full of little moments like the one in 
which a pair of tough-talking gangsters sit around in serious, contemplative 
confusion at why Ghost Dog communicates with them by carrier pigeon. Try to 
imagine the scene in "Pulp Fiction" where the two guys are nitpicking about 
how to clean their blood-drenched car, spun out to feature length.</P>
