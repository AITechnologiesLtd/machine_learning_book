<PRE>`Little Voice' – Deserves to Be Heard
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>`Little Voice' is one of those many offbeat comedies that depicts and
odd slice of British life and those that inhabit its strange little
world.   At the center is LV (Jane Horrocks), short for her nickname
of Little Voice, which was given to her by her mom.  LV is a very shy
and almost reclusive girl who seems to always stare at the ground and
bites her bottom lip in fear whenever someone talks to her.  When she
speaks, she emits a wavering, mousy voice.  It seems that the only
thing that makes her comfortable are the pleasant thoughts of her
now-deceased father and listening to a large record collection that he
had left to her.  When she feels threatened, which seems to be a
majority of the time, she drowns herself in the music that was left to
her by her dad, which she blares over the phonograph. </P>
<P>Any chance that she has of becoming a normal girl who can interact
freely and confidently with others is constantly being challenged. 
Her mom, Mari (Brenda Blethyn), is her biggest obstacle.  Her wild
ways, LV believes, led to her father's early death.  She constantly
puts LV down and is openly annoyed with her.  The mom is also reckless
in her ways and promiscuous in her actions.  To get the attention of
men, she gleefully says, `let's roll about.'  One of the men that she
winds up with is Ray Say (Michael Caine).  He was a once-respected
talent agent who is now relegated to scouting for strippers in a
not-so-nice part of the city.  </P>
<P>As in most situations where the only way is up, everyone is looking
for that frequently elusive route that will allow them to leave their
dismal lives behind.  For LV, it might be a young telephone repairman
(an underutilized Ewan McGregor) that she recently met.  He has a fond
interest in pigeons, and somewhat understands LV's situation, for she
is similarly caged up from the rest of the world.  For Mari, it might
be Ray Say.  Sure, he's no longer the force that he used to be, but he
still has a way with words, and those words speak volumes to the
star-struck Mari.  And for Ray Say, his ticket back to his previous
stature might be LV.  Say makes the startling discovery that under
certain conditions, LV can magically transform herself, enabling her
to sing uncannily like some of the greatest divas of yesteryear,
whether it's the breathy Marilyn Monroe or the brash Shirley Bassey or
the wistful Judy Garland.  She is a singer/impressionist
extraordinaire.  `You're sitting on a gold mine,' Say says to Mari. 
`Dreams that you dare to dream…she can make them come true.'  The
focus of the film now shifts to a test of wills between Say's and
Mari's desire to exploit her versus LV's simple wish to find normalcy.</P>
<P>In the end, I felt that the story was uneven at times (the implied
romance was unnecessary) and the resolution seemed unrealistically
quick.  But Horrocks is a real gem.  It's incredible how a fearful
child can completely and believably transform herself into a singing
dynamo that slinks and shimmies on stage.  She's real fun to watch and
is a great singer too.  In fact, she sings all of the songs that you
hear in the movie.  Caine effectively lends his talents as an oily
huckster, although in the end his character turns very mean for no
apparently good reason.  Also, Blethyn is an unexpected comic force as
a maddening, wench-like mum.  Several nice performances from the cast
make this odd slice of British life something to be heard and seen.</P>
