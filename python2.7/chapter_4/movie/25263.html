<P>Quite a cast has been assembled for this Altman-esque tale of
interlocked lives, all clamoring around the "serious social problem" of
gun control. While there's no denying that the USA has over fifty
million gun owners and it's a subject worthy of address and debate, this
movie thuddingly hits the same numb point over and over again: guns are
bad, guns can kill. That's about as resonant as It's the Rage will get.</P>
<P>Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen play a miserable suburban couple whose
marriage is disrupted by an accidental shooting in their living room at
midnight. As it turns out, the guy was Daniels' business partner. Allen
moves out in disgust and, through a process of self-discovery, figures
out that her happy little life was nothing more than a middle class
prison. She hides away at her new workplace, in the employ of eccentric
millionaire and computer guru Gary Sinise. Daniels sits at home fuming,
renting pornography and playing with his gun.</P>
<P>Andre Braugher (as Daniels' attorney) and David Schwimmer play a gay
couple who have just purchased their first pistol. Good timing, too, if
you're talking soap operas. Schwimmer has begun to suspect his longtime
companion of having an affair. Braugher's problems escalate when his
white trash lover (Anna Paquin) becomes afraid that her powder keg older
brother (wild Giovanni Ribisi) is gonna grab his gun and blow Braugher
away. </P>
<P>Of course, this being an Altman-esque intertwined plot, Ribisi is
chasing after entirely the wrong guy. He thinks friendly video store
clerk Josh Brolin is the one who's playing Lolita with his kid sister.
Wouldn't you know that Brolin worked for mad computer guru Sinise at the
start of the movie?</P>
<P>Guns figure into each narrative, and because they're so close at hand
our trigger happy cast are always a hairs breath from blowing each other
away. Unfortunately, they don't. We the audience are stuck with ninety
minutes of angry one-note characters who rub their quirkiness in our
faces. Jeff Daniels flounders as a pompous hubbie who screams and yells
when he doesn't get his way and David Schwimmer is grating as a swishy
gay stereotype prone to fidgety hissy-fits. Robert Forster sleepwalks
through the standard "cop ready for retirement" role who's investigating
every other character, often launching into bone dry, monotonous
speeches about the grim state of the world. Oh, the humanity.</P>
<P>I don't fault the cast, though. Some of them, like the always reliable
Joan Allen, fare better than others. Gary Sinise in particular has fun
with his socially inept geek persona, often reacting to the computer
screens in his room which purportedly reflect his games but seem to
display his own manic thoughts (which sometimes involve violence and
guns, natch.) Only problem is, the charismatic and mannered Sinise often
looks like he belongs in another movie entirely - say, a better Terry
Gilliam movie, than the bland, by-the-numbers movie of the week everyone
else is taking part in.</P>
<P>Once you get past the characters, the very look of the film screams
student filmmaker. The budget shows its seams painfully in poorly lit
flat imagery, often cheating shots to avoid showing the entire house of
a millionaire or upper middle class couple in ways which limit the film
visually. The final montage where everything heats up and blows,
involving several guns going off and many characters buying the farm,
it's so choppy and unclear that I didn't know what happened to a major
character until catching it a second time.</P>
<P>Intended as a bleak comedy about the "gun control problem", the movie
never finds enough social nuances in its display of guns in the homes of
the rich, the middle class and the poor to work as humor or political
satire. The caricatures and situations James Stern has placed under his
microscope are simply too broad to have much of an impact. </P>
<P>By the time I reached the closing credits, where we are informed what
happened to each of the characters afterwards in a cutesy anecdote about
what they learned (such as "Don't shoot the friendly charging rhino,
climb up a tree instead!"), the temptation was great to hang up my
liberal conscience and join Charlton Heston's merry men at the NRA. I
had to remind myself, "It's only a movie, it's only a movie…" </P>
