<P>My friend Tomas de Torquemada is a very inquisitive fellow.</P>
<P>TT: Why did you wait this long to review American Beauty?</P>
<P>EJ: My paper has limited space. I gave the priority to other titles.</P>
<PRE>TT: Why?</PRE>
<P>EJ: Because too many worthy films get here without the ballyhoo, 
publicity, promotions, previews, TV "interviews," or reviewers' 
glowing quotes. Hence, many persons miss them -- especially small 
productions, independent ones and especially foreign films.</P>
<P>TT: Yet doesn't movie quality eventually speak for itself?</P>
<PRE>EJ: Are you kidding?</PRE>
<P>TT: But at least some non-hyped, unfamiliar titles do make it on 
clocal screens.</P>
<P>EJ: They do. But the publicity is still zilch, the big chains 
schedule few showings, and/or don't keep them long enough for 
word-of-mouth to bring in
the public.</P>
<PRE>TT: What about the art houses?</PRE>
<P>EJ: These are often too indigent for big ads. Since the distributors 
push the big, commercial titles, whenever a good but unfamiliar movie 
does arrive, its best -- often only -- friends are positive reviews 
in local media.</P>
<PRE>TT: So it's not hopeless.</PRE>
<P>EJ: Not totally, but ninety percent. With rare exceptions, individual 
critics wield no power. What does is a mass of praise coming from the 
majority of the media. Even then, that works mostly for popular, 
mainstream films.</P>
<PRE>TT: Without exception?</PRE>
<P>EJ: No, I said "mostly." There are surprises. The Blair Witch 
Project, an original, independent production made for a shoestring, 
has done extremely well, partly thanks to clever distributors who 
spent a fortune on promotion. But by and large, the masses hardly 
read reviews. Let's not fool ourselves about the influence of movie 
critics.</P>
<P>TT: Let's get back to your priorities. What are some of the recent 
movies you reviewed while postponing  American Beauty?</P>
<P>EJ: It was obvious that this film was being received enthusiastically 
by everybody and his sister. My own two cents would not make any 
difference, either way.</P>
<PRE>TT: So you concentrated on?....</PRE>
<P>EJ: ... solid but unknown titles, many of them foreign: the hilarious 
French The Dinner Game; the beautiful Chinese The King of Masks; the 
quirky British My Life So Far; the French gem for connoisseurs, 
Autumn Tale. American films like the wrenching Holocaust film The 
Last Days; small, good movies which deal with minorities and had no 
publicity, such as Trick, or the Canadian Better Than Chocolate.</P>
<P>TT: But you did include some mainstream titles.</P>
<P>EJ: Yes. Even duds, as save-your-money warnings. Or else items that 
were getting negative reviews but, in my opinion, were highly 
entertaining. Like Double Jeopardy.</P>
<P>TT: Well now, what about American Beauty?</P>
<P>EJ: It 's good. The acting by Spacey and Bening is superb. Spacey is 
highly versatile and talented, can suggest (here and elsewhere) 
ambiguity like nobody's business. This ability serves fleshes out a 
character who, while not eccentric or original, melds anomie, revolt 
and libido.</P>
<P>In her best roles Bening has been a charmer with character, but no 
passive sweetie-pie. Here charm is replaced by nastiness. in the 
difficult role of a compulsive neatnik of the Martha Stewart 
persuasion, as well as an ambitious and shallow creature. She brings 
a weird kind of complexity to an unbending heart and brain.</P>
<P>Everyone knows by now that the film is about a dysfunctional society 
of which we see only a small section, which is conveniently set in 
suburbia. Conveniently because it keeps characters topologically 
close to one another. But there is no real reason for suburbia to be, 
as intended, a genuine culprit.
The who, what, where, how of the movie could as easily be in a 
megalopolis , in non-suburbia or non-exurbia.</P>
<P>There's almost a genre in which suburbanites are the target of 
ironies. The last one was Ang Lee's exceptionally powerful and 
memorable The Ice Storm. If you go back many years, one of the 
pioneering movies in the genre was the sad and sadly forgotten The 
Swimmer (1968) with Burt Lancaster(from a John Cheever story). In 
1975 we had The Stepford Wives (from an Ira Levin novel) that made is 
caustic points by going to science-fiction and its own brand of 
horror. The list is long.</P>
<P>If there is no horror, literally, in American Beauty, the picture is 
a gallery of creeps or creepiness. No one is immune or has redeeming 
values, from the protagonists to the two girls (and classmates) to 
Budy Kane, the smooth real-estate Czar who is not too far removed 
from business zombieism and with whom Carolyn Burnham has a sadly 
mechanical affair. Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts, the 18-year old 
schoolmate, compulsive videographer,voyeur, druggie and drug-dealer 
is invidiously romanticized by the movie (a mistake, in my opinion). 
He gave me the creeps. Creepy too is his father, retired Colonel 
Fitts  (effectively played by Chris Cooper), with his Nazi 
paraphernalia, his silent, near-catatonic wife (we guess why she's 
that way at film's end, but I won't reveal it in case you have not 
seen the movie), his relationship with his son. Creepiest of all may 
be the son presenting his urine samples to Dad, so as to show he he 
is drug-free.</P>
<P>Also creepy is the supporting role of Lester's new immediate boss who 
stands for materialistic, arrivistic heartlessness, and stupidity. 
When the rebelling Lester tells him off you fell like applauding. But 
this is a secondary, though well worked-in character. The main ones, 
father, mother, daughter and only child Jane (Thora Birch in a 
Christine --The Ice Storm -- Ricci part), her pal  Angela and Ricky 
make up a sextet which is also a SEX-tet.</P>
<P>Each, in his/her way, is a sicko. Not that this is unjustified. 
Angela, the end-of-millennium Lolita, is an icky creature, almost 
repelling for me, but as the beacon of Lester's mid-life-crisis 
libido and his alienation from Carolyn, she fits in well.</P>
<P>Even so, I keep thinking of Gertrude Stein whose words ought to be on 
the Decalogue of Filmmaking: "I prefer the normal to the abnormal, 
since the normal is so much more complex and interesting."</P>
<P>Summarized in High Concept fashion American Beauty is primarily about 
Lester who takes stock of his life and comes up with a negative 
balance. Unnecessarily, the film opens with Lester addressing us "de 
profundis,"  telling us about his last days on this planet and about 
his impending death. This deja vu gimmick detracts from the story, as 
does much of the over-the-top script. It substitutes  "more is more" 
for the advice "less is more."</P>
<P>The overkill goes as far as packing, claustrophobically and  most 
improbably, almost all the characters as next-door-neigbhors.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the photography, by a master, is superb. There is also 
quite an assortment of humorous bits, not the least of which is 
Lester, semi-drunk, alcohol in hand, starting to make passes at his 
own wife who worries about her high-priced couch being soiled. What's 
extra funny to me is that I don't blame her.</P>
