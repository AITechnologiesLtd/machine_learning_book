<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>One of the better versions of the Charlie Chan series, now having Sidney
Toler as Chan. He replaced the deceased Warner Oland, and plays Chan in
a more avuncular style. This film comes at the onset of WW 11 and
therefore has a patriotic theme, which is well-crafted into the sabotage
story so as not to seem misplaced storytelling. Chan tries to stop
saboteurs from blowing up an American Naval Fleet passing through the
Panama Canal. The story is a virtual remake of  "Marie Galante" (1934)
with Spencer Tracy, but this version is far superior. Director Norman
Foster became a protégé of Orson Welles after making this film.</P>
<P>A seaplane lands in Panama City (the city of spies) and an American
Secret Agent named Godley embarks to give Charlie Chan, working in
disguise as a Panama hat maker, some info on who might be the elusive
Ryner, a dangerous spy whom no one has seen before. But before he can
give that info, he takes a puff on his cigarette and dies from the
poison put in it.</P>
<P>Charlie, working with his goofy Number 2 son, Jimmy, suspects that Ryner
must be one of the passengers on the seaplane. He reasons that it had to
be someone on the plane who switched cigarette packs with Godley. The
passenger list includes the following: Manolo, a smarmy cabaret owner;
Kathi Lenesch, an illegal alien from Eastern Europe, who was a
stewardess and is now hired to sing in Manolo's dive; Richard Cabot, a
handsome square coming to the Canal to be a supervising engineer, who
becomes smitten with the frightened Kathi; Jennie Finch, an old maid
schoolmarm from Chicago, who is squeamish about her visit to such an
exotic place; Cliveden Compton, a British novelist, who has a penchant
for snooping; Dr. Rudolph Grosser, an Austrian scientist, who is doing
illegal experiments on rats -- he induces them with the bubonic plague;
and, Achmed Halide, a tobacco shop owner, who followed Godley to Chan's
hat shop and is later on discovered to have a tomb where explosives were
transported to the Canal's Power Station.</P>
<P>Charlie gets off some good quotes:  "Man without relatives is man
without problems." "One enemy is one too many." "When prepared for
worst, one can hope for best."</P>
<P>The best part of this enjoyable whodunit, was that it was hard to guess
who Ryner was. Charlie figures it out by having all the suspects from
the seaplane gathered at the Power Station, as he tells them they will
all get killed unless the suspect tells them where the explosives are.
Charlie's a wily one!</P>
