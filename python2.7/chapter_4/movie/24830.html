<PRE>IN SHORT: An average John Woo flick</PRE>
<P>"Good morning Mr. Hunt (Tom Cruise). The picture you see is a Dr.
Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. Dr. Nekhorvich
was killed in a plane crash while on his way to deliver something to us.
We don't know what but it's really dangerous. IM agent Sean Ambrose
(Dougray Scott) was on the plane, too, and we haven't found the body.
We're not sure where he is, if he's screwed us, or exactly what your
mission is, other than to stop something really nasty from happening.
We're sure you'll figure it out along the way. Oh, you can only use two
agents and you must include a civilian thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie
Newton) on the team. We know we're not supposed to configure your team,
but we can discuss that when you come over and discuss the matter in
person with us (Anthony Hopkins). If you or any member of you IM team
should be caught or killed, yada yada yada. Have a nice day."</P>
<P>With all the baggage of the past buried and forgotten, John Woo takes up
the director's reigns, overseeing the one-man strike force that is Ethan
Hunt, leader of the Impossible Mission "team," in Mission: Impossible 2.
Woo, whose visual sense can make a boy giddy, lets loose with both
barrels and all the visual fireworks he can put on the big screen.
That's a good thing 'cuz the M:I2 script stinks. Like its big screen
predecessor this flick has very little in common with the television
series it is based upon, other than a self-destructing set of
instructions and characters pulling rubber mask disguises off their
faces. We don't compare to Source Material. Fans of the series can
figure out what's different from the paragraph above.</P>
<P>Then again, it's summertime, when all most of us want out of a movie is
onscreen fireworks and a reason to plunge our mitts into the
extra-large-super-sized popcorn up to our elbows. M:I2 delivers that in
spades, refusing to cut fight scenes that run on too long, resorting to
makeup gimmicks instead of developing a great story and, in short,
refusing to roll over and play dead when its story was done. It's almost
as if the writers and Woo sat down and figured out what would be really
cool to do and which really cool bits would be even cooler if shot in
slow motion, and then wrote the script around them. That means a
motorcycle duel, a half naked Cruise on a rock and the gun in the sand
bits that are in the teevee commercial, and a wee bit of "aerobatic
insanity" that reprises something in the last flick and which had the
audience happily giggling.</P>
<P>Absolutely giddy. Myself included. I told you.</P>
<P>If you're a novice to the concept, the IM is a secret force that
manipulates situations to bring about conclusions that punish the evil
guys and ensure that truth, justice and the American way win out. In
this case, it's the story of one renegade agent and his possession of an
artificially created strain of influenza that could devastate the world.
The "good" IM team -- our heroes include Ving Rhames, the only returnee
from M:I1 and John Polson as an almost utterly dispensable guy with an
Australian accent, useful since the film is set in Australia -- must
track and destroy another -- Richard Roxbury is the muscle on bad guy
Ambrose's side -- using the civilian and a small tracking device
implanted in Newton's ankle, as bait. The notion of one IM team against
another one is a good one. The problem is that one team leader knows all
about the moves of the other, and not vice versa. The bad guys also have
all the IM technology, so how they miss the tracking device is news to
me.</P>
<P> No, it's not. It's scriptwriters ignoring the obvious. It's
scriptwriters ignoring what they've written earlier in the script. But,
just as in the last flick, this series is not so much about the story as
it is about Ethan Hunt, $20 million dollar action figure. That being the
case, Tom Cruise is absolute dynamite in black clothing. He makes a
great John Woo movie action toy. The action sequences, as in everything
John Woo does, are the reason to lay out hard cash to see the flick.
Bullets fly. Explosions, um, explode. Cruise does unbelievable physical
things believably and gets a love interest to boot. So the hell with
history and any requirement of logic in the script.</P>
<P>Buy the extra big popcorn and stick to the small soda. This sequel is
less complicated than the last one, but if you have to make a quick run,
you'll still miss something important.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Mission: Impossible 2, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.50</PRE>
<P>It's a summertime, popcorn dateflick. All sweetener and no nutritional
value at all.</P>
