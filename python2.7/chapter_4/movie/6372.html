PG-13.</P>
<P>The remake of French movies is a major Hollywood sub-industry. The
results are  invariably inferior to the originals.Some remakes are OK
now and then, but the great majority are bad. The latest case was
"Diabolique" The surprising news is that the new opus by and with Barbra
Streisand is better than the 1958 French movie.</P>
<P>Surprise Number Two for me is that for once I enjoyed watching a movie
with a large audience. I normally go to earliest possible shows on the
least trafficky days. No odious smells, no sticky goo on the floor, no
crinkling cellophane and loud chomping, no running commentaries, no
laughter at the wrong places. For "The Mirror," however, the theater
though packed was odorless, noiseless and the audience laughed
unboisterously at the right times.</P>
<P>The film is most enjoyable, well paced and without dull  moments. Its
improbabilities or exaggerations vanish behind the qualities of script,
acting and Miss Streisand's direction, her third after "Yentl" and "The
Prince of Tides."</P>
<P>It starts as Jeff Bridges's picture, then is shared by him  and
Streisand before the focus  moves on her --an interesting progression. A
mathematician at Columbia University, Greg is addressed as Professor
Larkin. He should really be called Professor Dullski or, if he taught
literature, Professor Yawnesco. He knows and loves his stuff, even has a
new book out, but he bores his students to perdition. I have never seen
such a somnolescent or indifferent group outside some Hollywood high
school pictures. </P>
<P>Bachelor Gregory is also a basket case in his private life. At 46 (I
give him the age of Bridges), he still gets terribly distracted by sex
-- and sex is everywhere, from a gorgeous redhead in his classroom's
front row to television where insects mate in educational programs and
so many products are sold through sex. (I waited in vain for the sound
track to come up with that vigorous old song "Everybody's Doing It.") </P>
<P>Larkin is influencable with a vengeance. At a book-signing gathering, he
opens his address  with some flat academic humor. A beauty  (model Elle
MacPherson) walks in, sits down, silently but blatantly provokes him a
la Sharon Stone with her sex appeal. Gregory's talk becomes gibberish.
Very funny.</P>
<P>We learn that she is his latest ex-paramour and that he is unhappy with
the fact that all his relations with women fail because they revolve
around sex. His conclusion is that he ought to be looking for a kindred
soul and mind, minus the sex. </P>
<P>Like the famous revue  "No Sex Please, We're British," the
mathematician's new slogan  could be "No Sex Please, I'm  Gregory." He
places an ad  ad in which he seeks only companionship and specifies
"Must have a Ph.D. and be over thirty-five. Physical appearance not
important."</P>
<P>The other thread of the plot deaks with two sisters, Claire (Rogers,"the
pretty one") and Rose (Streisand,"the smart one") .Claire spots the ad
and sneakily mails Greg the picture of Rose. She looks just right to
Greg.</P>
<P>Rose, by coincidence (well, it's only a movie) is also a Columbia
professor, of literature. As she readies herself in an awful dress for
Claire's wedding. Always a bridesmaid and never a bride, brainy,
lively,witty but without lasting relationships with men, she is a
perfect match for Gregory.</P>
<P>They and their minds meet, hit it off, develop an odd, platonic rapport
. They eventually marry, but always under the no sex strictures imposed
by Gregory and accepted by Rose, reluctantly as we shall see soon
enough, when Rose wants romance and what comes naturally. This leads to
complications and a transformation... </P>
<P>The acting, broad but not too, with a huge assist from direction and
script keeps hitting the bull's eye. Jeff Bridges, never a looker, has
been a major, versatile talent. Think of "Bad Company,"" Fat
City,""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,"" Hearts of The West,"" Starman," "
Nadine,"" Tucker,"
"The Fabulous Baker Boys,""Fearless." Streisand's great one-woman band
abilities are a given. Here, in odd ways, she may remind you  at times
of the still-moving "The Way We Were."</P>
<P>Mimi Rogers, who possesses the most interesting crooked mouth in
pictures, and her new husband Pierce Brosnan (of whom she gets quickly
tired), are pallid, superficial characters.This makes a contrast with
the personalities of the Gregory-Rose duo, lets Bridges and especially
Streisand bask in the spotlight. They deserve it.   </P>
<P>Lauren Bacall plays the mother of the two women with a combination of
chic, fading glamour, sure-of-herself presence and egotism, and motherly
limitations, notably her non-understanding of Rose. This incomprehensio
comes to an end in a long-delayed, moving scene that flirts dangerously
with maudliness but survives it.  Mother and daughter stop snipping and
sniping. They open their hearts as Rose comes out squarely with  her
complexes about her appearance. Here Streisand seems to be exorcising
her own demons.</P>
<P>With her refrain  "I raised two daughters, buried a husband,"  Bacall is
a Jewish mother, but one pushed neither into a cartoon or a caricature.
Overall, Jewishness in the film is not insisted upon. Sometimes it comes
through gently in details, like Rose's "Talk to me already."</P>
<P>Gags are in good supply and nicely timed, like Rose's showing Greg how
to capture his students' interest. There also humorous rather than
outright comic parts, such as Rose's astounding of Greg with her
comprehension of math. Better yet, the audience is rewarded with an even
larger number of subtle bits of business. Examples: the early sequence
about Claire's wedding is used for character portrayals and spares us
the actual ceremony; the talkative meanderings of Rose and Gregory in
which the discussions are amusing, novel and attention-grabbing but
always cut before they become cumbersome; the first semi-kiss of the
couple and Rose's wary reaction -- she pats Greg's back. There is much
more along those lines, with excellent details.  </P>
<P>Some weak areas do exist in the film, most of them papered over. When
Gregory drops in on Rose's huge, lively class, she is in the process of
charming and too manipulating her students with a discussion of love and
sex which rings phony. She gets far too personal in her "confessions,"
uses  medieval courtly love (adoration of the lady but no sex) in
sketchy ways, knows the name of every student in that crowded
amphitheater (!!!). The well over 50 prof fishes for the sympathy of
students in their 20s with hip language. About complete love she
exclaims: "When it does last, it feels fucking great!" The young
scholars applaud.</P>
<P>She also tells them that when you fall in love you hear Puccini. At
film's end Rose and Gregory, previously separated, are reunited in a
sequence out of old screwball comedies. We hear Puccini 's "Nessun'
dorma" but then, with the filmmakers clearly worried about this
cultural-musical reference becoming lost on most audiences, the finale
and end credits switch over to the couple's endless gyrations in the
street and the old cliche of a pop song pops up. Otherwise, the movie is
truly fresh.  Whether or not it is read closely as a throwback to
romantic comedies, as a part-feminist tract or whatever, it holds many
pleasures for any mature audience.</P>
