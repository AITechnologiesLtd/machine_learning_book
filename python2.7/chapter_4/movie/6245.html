<PRE>        "I am the bastard son of Claire Huxtable! I am the lost
        Cunningham! I learned the facts of life from The Facts of Life!
        Don't you get it? Someone has to save all the other cable boys and
        girls, someone has to kill the babysitter."</PRE>
<P>These are probably the best and worst lines in THE CABLE GUY, and in a
knowing, twisted film-student-with-a-vengeance sort of way, the combined
effort of director Ben Stiller (whom I hereby forgive forever for making
REALITY BITES) and writer Holtz is a dark and magnificently lunatic
mock-celebration of the flickering blue parent generation. OK, it's also
an excessive throw-in-all-the-popular-media-references-you-can type of
smartass caper with more intelligent directing than most of Carrey's
other films (although that isn't saying much), but being the first with
an actual body-functions-joke minimum, this film could very well be
Carrey's first into the comedians-can-act-too spectrum of Hollywood.</P>
<P>Unlike previous Jim Carrey successes like the Ace Ventura movies or DUMB
AND DUMBER, which were no more than empty vehicles for Carrey's manic
personality and a surprisingly inventive number of flatulent jokes, The
Cable Guy not only has a plot that follows to conclusion, more
importantly--gasp!--it has a concept: too much TV is, well, it's just
bad for you.</P>
<P>This is overwhelmingly proved by Chip Douglas (Carrey), the cable guy 
who fixes architext Steven Kovacs up with free cable television 
channels and then, taking Kovacs' unwilling friendship for granted, 
proceeds to mess up his life in a number of ways: he throws mind-splinting 
karaoke parties, wrecks friendly basketball games, stalks Stephen and 
eventually lands him in jail.  As Chip, Carrey is the optimum product of
self-conscious popular media gone deliciously and disturbingly wrong. He 
relates everything to television past and present, assaulting his newly 
appointed *schlemielman* with catchphrase melanges from sixties sitcoms 
and reenacting movie scenes with a screaming, maniacal sense of irrelevence 
that is darkly engaging to us postmodern audiences (or maybe just me), and 
morally unsettling to people like my parents, who would consider Mr Carrey 
to be a product of a satanic cult instead of mere television. </P>
<P>But then of course, isn't that the point? CABLE GUY is *about* the
dangers of television, if we are to believe the desperation on
Chip-Carrey's face as he dangles from a gigantic satellite above
imminent doom. *Somebody has to kill the babysitter*, he implores,
bringing to mind the kitschy flashback the film provided its audience
earlier about Chip's childhood loneliness, sans siblings and parents,
leading to a life of absorption in front of the TV.</P>
<P>But the moment, like everything in this movie, turns on itself with a
beautiful slow-motion climax that intensifies to blackness, resembling
the same metafictional acknowledgement of media-constructed realities in
the ending of that British bastion of silliness now revered by millions
across the world--Carrey's earlier counterparts--Monty Python's Holy
Grail.</P>
<P>In the end, CABLE GUY is worth watching if only to see Carrey
actually sort of act. Or at least, acknowledge the presence of his cast.
Perhaps this is more to director Stiller's credit, who refuses to allow
the film to degenerate into yet another Carrey showcase. Delightful
surprise guest appearances from Stiller and longtime partner in crime
Janeane Garafalo also keep the enjoyment going when Carrey's
hyperactivity annoys--and make no mistake, he will annoy, though far
less than in previous movies--and Carrey's own performance, subdued as
it is, is near-perfect for the media pastiche (the word no
self-respecting postmodernist would leave home without) that he
represents.</P>
<P>Like Mork (and much like Robin Williams himself), Carrey's comedy evokes
every pose, every gesture, every facial expression, tone and technical
idea ever used in the history of modern media, aggrandized and
fast-forwarded to grotesque proportions to pass for humor. Like Mork,
Carey's Chip Douglas (the name itself, the film reveals, is filched from
"My Three Sons," so Carey's character is literally nameless, never truly
identified, and a macabre inversion of Leone's Man With No Name) merges
real life conversation with commercial snippets and a movie quotes
compendium, and a paranoid self-consciousness that ironically blends
fantasy with real life. "If this were a movie, there would be danger
music," he snarls while playing villain with Stephen's girlfriend, 
singing along *with* the actual soundtrack with knowing vengeance.</P>
<P>It is therefore perhaps the film's self-awareness on the whole that
makes THE CABLE GUY weird, what with its parodic freeze frames and the
vicious mock-reality celebrity trials to name a few of the fun things
Stiller gets the film up to. And Hollywood has never taken to
metadramatics very well.  THE CABLE GUY was generally badly received by
critics and grossed little more than it took to make at the US Box
Office (according to figures taken from the Internet Movie Database).
Still, I recommend this film for its widescreen absurdity, great
performances all round, and its dark vision of our crazy lives. Carry
on, Carrey.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
