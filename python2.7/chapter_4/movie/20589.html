<P>Starring Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Ian Holm, Julian Sands, and Roy Scheider</P>
<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> Quick, off the top of your head, tell me all you know about this movie.</P>
<P> If you recalled fondly the line that Nelson said in an episode of "The
Simpsons" after Bart uses a fake ID to get into this film ("I'll tell you
two things wrong with that title"), then you're like most of America.  I
knew a little bit more coming in: that it was based on a novel by William S.
Burroughs that is the quintessence of non-linear narrative and that it was
directed by David Cronenberg.</P>
<P> On the way out, I know precious little more.</P>
<P> Naked Lunch is one of those films that is so mind blowing that it is
baffling.  So intelligent that it feels idiotic, and so strange that you
wonder if you took something beforehand and forgot about it.  Yet it was one
of those movies critics loved.</P>
<PRE> Screw 'em.</PRE>
<P> In the movie Contact, James Woods asks "Why is it always the opinion of the
egghead set that aliens are friendly?"  Although the answer Jodie Foster
gave back was sufficient, it should have been a more callous response:
"Because we don't fear what we don't understand."  However, among the
intellectual set, things go one step further.  Among the intellectual set,
heresy is saying "I don't get it", and thus hidden meanings that weren't
there in the first place are put into books and movies.  The entire business
is subjective, we will not know the metaphors placed into them unless we
know their makers, and thus everyone is afraid to say "you're wrong" about
what the meaning is.</P>
<P> The unknown doesn't scare us.  Admitting we don't know it scares us.</P>
<P> Naked Lunch, like so many movies, has no real point to it.  However,
because it is so weird and so out of our heads it is the automatically taken
position of the intellectual set that "if I don't understand it, it must be
good."  Two things come out of this.  The first is the comedy when someone
tries to give an idiotic explanation of what something means in the midst of
ignorance (i.e. the man who thought "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" was
an expose about Bill Clinton).  The second is the tragedy when people keep
their mouths shut, not brave enough to say what is on their mind.</P>
<P> What is on my mind, and the mind of just about anyone who has seen the
film, is "what the hell?"  You have no idea what is going on in the movie,
and by the end you still have no idea what is going on in the movie.  Yeah,
you've seen a lot of weird sights (the transvestite drug dealer, the
roach-centipede intelligence war, the cannibalistic typewriters), but you're
no closer to understanding what went down than anyone else is.</P>
<P> There is a word for this, intellectual elite: incomprehensible.  I know
that it is the "I" word and that you're not supposed to say it in class or
conversation, but that's what Naked Lunch is.</P>
<P> But, you know, what, it isn't just the intellectuals who do this.</P>
<P> It's everyone else, too.  For more of my ranting and raving, go to see my
review of The Sixth Sense at www.filmfrenzy.com .</P>
<P> That is, if you're not tired of hearing something that someone has needed
to say for a long, long time.</P>
<P> Either way, stay away from Naked Lunch.  Movies such as that will only
confuse you.  They will not entertain you and they will not enlighten you.</P>
