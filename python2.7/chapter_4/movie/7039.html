<PRE>                                   SHINE
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>An Australian child prodigy, bullied by his father to succeed, is on his
way to world fame by virtue of his remarkable skill at the piano. He
wins contests, impresses the right people and teachers stand in line to
work with him. Then it all falls apart amidst sweat, insanity and
Rachmaninoff's "Piano Concerto No. 3".</P>
<P>Based on the true story of David Helfgott life, the film has earned
numerous awards (Best Actor from New York Film Critics Association, Best
Picture from others). It is a powerful portrayal of madness but there is
also a certain "emptiness" to it that prevents the film from reaching
inside the audience with the intensity that the tale begs for.</P>
<P>Helfgott's journey from childhood through his breakdown to a comeback in
his forties is one of triumph over mental illness, however the viewer's
emotional involvement often remains detached. And that's too bad.
Whatever it is that just doesn't "click" stands in the way of this fine
movie being a magnificent one.</P>
<P>Geoffrey Rush who portrays the musician as an adult is wild and right on
target as the rambling fast-talking genius-in-left-field. His inspired
take on the deranged rivals Dustin Hoffman's Rainman. You'll be unable
to take your eyes off him while he is eating up the screen.</P>
<P>One of the problems is that Helfgott condition is never very clear. We
see him as a beaten child dominated by his monster father but driven to
excel at the keyboard. We watch as he gains more and more skill,
learning to use the piano as a means of self-expression. All along, his
eye is on his father's Holy Grail: performing the seemingly un-playable
"Rach 3".</P>
<P>After masterfully performing the piece, he collapses on stage. The next
thing we know, he's institutionalized: a shattered man. Slowly coming
back to life, during the next few years the pianist begins to regain his
sanity. What happened? It's never very clear and that missing piece of
the jigsaw puzzle leaves the picture incomplete.</P>
<P>There are some wonderful scenes between Rush and Helfgott
savior/lover/astrologer (Lynn Redgrave) and some truly frightening ones
featuring the boy and his father. Based on the reviews and awards,
perhaps others see something that I don't, but I couldn't help wanting
more.</P>
