<P>Some films are not great, but they display a desire to do well, and the
detail that could make them great.  El Mariachi, is nicely done, with no
budget to speak off ( hell, a Hollywood meal for a week for a star would
cost at least twice the amount this film cost... ), but its ability to
dedicate its style, and well designed continuity of the director, make this
film work from the very beginning.</P>
<P>It is a bit of a comedy, so it seems at first, but slowly works its way into
a serious film.  The new visitor in town gets mixed up by accident with a
drug dealer, and the accidental mis-match almost  costs him his life were it
not for his instincts and ability to
walk out of trouble.  In the process he befriends a young lady who has been
kept in business by a rival drug lord just so he can not only get to her,
but keep his eyes on his rival.  The young mariachi is trying to find a job
just playing his guitar and singing... and the gun toting drug dealer
carries a guitar case with a few guns to take care of his business.</P>
<P>While many films take a lot of money to get everything done, this is the
quintessential student film, if you will, in that the director is also the
writer, and the cinematographer.  Were he at UCLA, or at the USC film
school, he would get a heck of a passing grade just for getting his project
done ( who cares about the other grades when the  competition alone would
prevent it from getting done...!!! ) and delivered.  It is an excellent
first start, and shows a promising director in the works. He deserves a
budget and a studio to back him for a few films.</P>
<P>The film itself is not great.... it is just there, and consistent.  It isn't
slick.... just filmed.  It has no great looking actresses or dolls,  just
real women.... it doesn't have a slick soundtrack.... just a few songs  on
the guitar of the lead actor.  What else does one want from a film...???</P>
