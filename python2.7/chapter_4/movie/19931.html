<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Less effective than last year's Return to Paradise, Brokedown Palace
dwells on several of the same themes as the almost-straight-to-video
Vince Vaughn/Joaquin Phoenix thriller – narcotics, making the ultimate
sacrifice for your best friend, and the injustice of Third World legal
systems.  New here are a thinner script, a weaker ending, and the
casting of two females in the lead roles.</P>
<P>The two women in question are Alice (Claire Danes, The Mod Squad) and
Darlene (Kate Beckinsale, The Last Days of Disco).  They are both recent
high school grads that work as hotel maids in safe, suburban Upland,
Ohio.  Alice and Darlene plan a summer vacation, but decide that Hawaii
is too `middle class' for them.  They settle on Thailand after a bottle
of beer from that country shatters during a party - talk about a sign
from above.</P>
<P>Since `Thailand' actually means `freedom' in English, both girls escape
to the Asian paradise, although Darlene still tells her parents that
they're headed for Hawaii.  Before long, the duo are squealing at their
six-dollar-a-night roach-infested hotel, whining about the unbearable
heat, and complaining that the city's river is contaminated with feces
and unsuitable for swimming.  Acting?  Probably not.  Remember the Thai
government forcing a real-life apology from Claire Danes after she
mewled that the country was full of giant cockroaches, babies with flies
buzzing around their heads, and people missing arms and legs?</P>
<P>Before long, the two brats sneak into the pool at a five-star hotel,
charging their drinks to a made-up room number.  As security closes in
on them, a hunky Aussie named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine, Dangerous
Beauty) saves the day by saying that Alice and Denise are with him.
Within twenty-four hours, both girls have fallen for him, are fighting
over him, and they decide to meet him in Bangkok for a couple of days
after his business weekend in Hong Kong.</P>
<P>Of course, Alice and Darlene don't know that Nick Parks is really Skip
Karns (his alias is an anagram), a drug smuggler that uses naïve
Americans as mules to transport his wares.  Somehow, two giant tins
containing 2 kilos of heroin are sneaked into Alice's backpack, and both
women are immediately dragged off to a dank and even more roach-infested
prison and soon found guilty of drug trafficking.  So how did the drugs
get into Alice's backpack and how could she not notice the extra
weight?  Never mind that.  The real question is why someone would use an
anagram for an alias.  And if you need to be that clever, why not use
Sink Prank?  Or K. Crap Skin?</P>
<P>Enter `Yankee Hank' Green (Bill Pullman, Lake Placid), an expatriate
American barrister that agrees to help the prisoners.  He tries to talk
to the American embassy and its ambassador (played by Lou Diamond
Phillips, The Big Hit), but seems only to be spinning his wheels.  Hey,
speaking of spinning wheels, Palace's script comes from two debut
screenwriters (David Arata and Adam Fields, the latter a producer on
Fox's other box office flop Ravenous) and is directed by the guy who
made Bad Girls (Jonathan Kaplan).  Credit cinematographer Newton Thomas
Sigel for the moody, atmospheric feel to the film.</P>
<P>Other things to keep an eye (or ear) out for are a horrible cover of The
Clash's `Rock the Casbah,' a cameo from ex-punk rocker John Doe as
Alice's dad, and one odd moment during the weepy finale where the pixie
Brit Beckinsale flubs her impeccable American accent.  Males 18-35 will
also relish the scene where Danes and Beckinsale `spoon' each other on a
bed.  The remaining demographics will have to look a bit harder for
something to enjoy.  (1:46 - PG-13 for brief strong language, drug
related material and some violent content)</P>
