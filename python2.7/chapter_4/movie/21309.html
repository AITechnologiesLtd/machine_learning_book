<P>If you thought last summer's "Lake Placid," one of the most recent 
"nature-run-amok" horror flicks, was unsatisfying, wait until you get a load 
of "Bats," a PG-13-rated snoozefest that is just about as mild and unscary as 
a film can be in this genre. The premiere picture for new movie studio, 
Destination Films, it is obvious that they timed the release perfectly so as 
to cash in on the impending holiday, but in their mad rush to get it finished 
and out in theaters, they have forgotten a few vital elements, such as 
likable characters that you can root for, hair-raising chills, and a story 
that actually makes sense. Halloween may bring it in some fast cash at the 
box-office, but "Bats" is strictly direct-to-video fare, and it certainly 
doesn't bode well for Destination, which is off to a disasterous start.</P>
<P>The pre-credits sequence features a teenage couple parked out in the middle 
of a desolate desert road. The guy thinks he feels something swipe by his 
arm, which was hanging out the window, so he goes to check it out. Then, BAM! 
You know the routine, and this tried-and-true horror cliche can often be fun. 
Unfortunately, because of the PG-13 rating they must adhere to, the attack 
scene is a collage of quick, flashy cuts, which are rather difficult to make 
out. Even on the most elementary level, "Bats" fails miserably.</P>
<P>Switch to young bat researcher (now there's a career!) Sheila Casper (Dina 
Meyer) and her wise-cracking assistant (Leon), who are approached to travel 
to Gallup, Arizona, to investigate a series of murders believed to be caused 
by bats. This is impossible, Sheila skepticizes, because bats aren't 
carnivorous. That's, of course, before Sheila, along with the town sheriff, 
Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), discover mad scientist Dr. McCabe (Bob 
Gunton) has created two biologically-altered bats who have the ability to 
pass on a virus throughout their species, rendering them deadly. Soon, the 
small desert town is being overrun by the black-winged serpents, and it is up 
to our three zero-dimensional heroes to stop them.</P>
<P>If I had known that the film was going to be so depressingly bad, and that 
the word, 'bats,' was going to be uttered to the point of nausea, I would 
have kept myself busy by counting the exact number of times it is spoken. In 
all seriousness, the word, 'bats,' is mentioned in at least fifty percent of 
the lines of dialogue, clearly out of desperation to keep the film 
interesting when it's actually extremely dull. No attempt is made in the 
vacuous screenplay, by John Logan, to develop the characters or the 
relationships, and the plot itself furiously comes into focus in the first 
ten minutes, and is never brought up again. In place of intelligence, we get 
scene after scene of extras running around screaming, a 'la Hitchcock's "The 
Birds," but without any of the excitement. And once that ends, a prolonged, 
insipid climax comes into play, set in the pure daylight!</P>
<P>With visual effects that are adequately convincing, bats that are about as 
believable as the Muppets, and three performers (Phillips, Meyer, and Leon) 
who are unquestionably above this grade-Z material, the most annoying thing 
about "Bats" is its out-and-out earnestness. With a premise as ridiculous as 
this one, at least a little bit of self-knowing jokiness is needed to show 
viewers that, yes, the filmmakers know it's silly. Ultimately, the only 
comedy present is in Leon's lame-o one-liners, and that earnestness--it just 
never lets up! Had the tone of "Bats" been along the lines of 1995's 
intentionally campy, "Tales From the Crypt Presents Demon Knight," director 
Louis Morneau, in an inauspicious jump to the big leagues after his work on 
the surprisingly superior "Carnosaur 2," might have been onto something. As 
is, "Bats" is low-rent horror garbage, and one of those rare theatrical 
outings that actually deserves to be relegated to the junk bin at video 
stores across the world.</P>
