<P>     Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), one of Australia's best ballroom
dancers, is on-target for a number of championships until he starts to
dance from the heart, abandoning the Dance Federation's rigid steps in
favor of his own moves.  His partner Liz (Gia Carides) leaves him and
Scott is forced to take up with an amateur.  Fran (Tara Morice) matches
Scott's zest for life, but one question hangs over them as they teach
each other about life, love, and dancing: can they win by rejecting
tradition?</P>
<P>     STRICTLY BALLROOM, based on an Australian play of the same name, 
was one of that country's biggest 1992 screen hits.  It's easy to see
why.  The movie is funny, energetic, and enjoyable--the perfect film
for a night or an afternoon out, no matter what your mood is.  While
the plot and characters don't boast any special depth, there's enough
freshness and originality to hold just about anyone's interest.</P>
<P>     The movie has an inventive sense of humor that becomes apparent in 
the riotously funny opening scenes.  Although STRICTLY BALLROOM never 
recaptures the brilliant irreverence of its beginning, there are still a
lot of laughs peppered throughout.  </P>
<P>     The first half of STRICTLY BALLROOM is better than the second.  
The final forty-five minutes don't have the same sense of exuberance, 
perfect timing, and quirkiness.  The character of Shirley Hastings (Pat 
Thompson) becomes less amusing and more annoying with the passage of 
time, and the wonderful chemistry between Scott and Fran sputters a
little.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, even the less-enjoyable parts of this movie outshine
the best scenes in many American comedies.  From start to finish,
STRICTLY BALLROOM is filled with energy and color.  The dance numbers
are splendidly choreographed and the soundtrack is vibrant and varied.
The romantic elements, while skillfully downplayed, are never lost or
ignored.</P>
<P>     For a film of this sort, it might easily be expected for the most
memorable scene to be the "final dance", in which the contest is
resolved and the victor decided upon.  In STRICTLY BALLROOM, this isn't
the case.  More magical than the ultimate dance at the Pan-Pacific
competition is the sequence where Scott teaches Fran to dance to the
tune of "Time after Time".  Despite the presence of a
too-obvious-to-be-missed Coca Cola product placement, that portion of
the film is enchanting.</P>
<P>     Both of the lead performers are good as actors and dancers.
There's no "stunt dancing" here.  Mercurio and Morice (reprising her
role in the stage show) are clearly at home on the dance floor.  In the
acting department, Morice has the edge, but Mercurio doesn't embarrass
himself.  The two work well together.  Also, at least in Morice's case,
it's nice to have someone in a starring role who doesn't look like she
belongs on a magazine cover.  She's physically plain, but her talent
gives her a wealth of charisma.</P>
<P>     The parallels with DIRTY DANCING are so obvious that I won't bother
discussing them.  Instead, I'd like to point out some similarities to
the 1992 ice skating flick THE CUTTING EDGE, of which I was strongly 
reminded while watching STRICTLY BALLROOM.  Both films focus on love
and competition in a similar, lighthearted manner.  Neither boasts a 
cast of well-established names, but the principle performers are all
effective.  Finally, THE CUTTING EDGE, like STRICTLY BALLROOM, deals
with the crushing burden of others' expectations, and the exhilaration
that comes from being freed of them.  </P>
<P>     STRICTLY BALLROOM is immensely enjoyable, and, apart from the
slight fall-off during the second half, there aren't many flaws to be
found.  The movie has color, energy, wit, and style; doesn't demand an
inordinate amount of attention; and is intelligent enough to avoid
being condescending.  All-in-all, it's a fine movie-going experience.</P>
<PRE>                           Rating:  9.0 (A, ***1/2)</PRE>
