<PRE>  The Blair Witch Project Review</PRE>
<P>Starring: Heather Donahue, Mike Williams and Joshua Leonard</P>
<P>   After months and months of anticipation, Blair Witch has finally gone wide,
playing in more than 1000 screens.  To some, it may be the film you've been
looking for this year, to others, including myself, it's a flawed bone chiller.</P>
<P>   The film begins quite uniquely.  It turns out that 3 people,Heather Donahue,
Mike Williams and Joshua Leonard, went into the forest to do a project on the
mythical Blair Witch, and were never found. The only evidence left of their
trip, was film from an 18mm video camera. The interesting thing about the use
of the camera is the fact that it's 18mm, because it's as if the whole
situation seemed like a reality. Unfortunately it made me a little queezy at
times because it was too jumpy. Motion sickness people beware.</P>
<P> Another positive note is, that there are no big budget effects or big named
actors to make it a blockbuster, just normal people who act like they do on a
every day basis who get lost in the woods. That itself seperates it from any
other film out there, but with that said, it still feels a bit staged. There
are many unbelivable situations that occur, some of which gets the film lost
itself. For 1 thing, it's highly doubtful anyone would tape themselves when
they're scared to the bone. It just isn't human.</P>
<P>  Many people were saying that the hype would ruin the experience, but it's a
false statement. You are so intensely interested in their venture into the
woods, that you clear you mind of most everything. Not too amny films can put
you in that state. One disappointing thing that I noticed was the lack of
terror. Sure it was chilling to hear blood curling screams in pure darkness,
and eerie sounds, but that's enough to get you frightened. In fact, it spends
more time trying to get to know the character's, that you wind up laughing at
their jokes more than being terrified. Don't get me wrong the characters did a
fine job. We all could relate to the nightmarish time they were having in these
woods, becoming more frightened and paranoid by the minute.</P>
<P>   I have to give credit to the real filmakers though, this film delivers it's
originality. It's not the same old slasher flick, it's a horror film that makes
you cringe in fear at the chilling sounds, pay attention to the intriguing
story, ponder into what is really going on. All these emotions never pop up in
one's mind when they watch a gore infested film. It dares to be different and
doesn't let down.</P>
<P>   By the end, everyone seems to lose it in the audience and on screen. The
film spends a good amount of time building up to the end, where everyone sits
still biting their nails or feeling sick to their stomach, but by then it's
over. It ends so quickly audiences aren't sure what they saw right then and
there until they have a few minutes to think about it. Strange? Maybe, but it's
sure one chill fest, that will be buried in your mind for quite some time,
despite it's unpleasant atmosphere.</P>
