<PRE>                                ANOTHER WOMAN
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1988)</PRE>
<P>   Two unfortunate trends have reared their ugly heads in Woody Allen's
recent movies: the first is a shift away from comedy, Allen's forte, and
toward drama, and the second is Allen's reluctance to appear on-screen. 
ANOTHER WOMAN suffers from both of these problems.</P>
<P>   Told through flashbacks, dreams, and first person narration, ANOTHER
WOMAN is a somber and humorless psychological character study of a 50-year
old woman.  Gena Rowlands plays the cerebral and emotionally reserved
philosophy professor undergoing a mid-life crisis.  In the film, she has
rented an apartment so she can work undisturbed on a new book.  The
apartment turns out to be adjacent to a psychiatrist's office, and through
a vent she can overhear his therapy sessions.  As Rowlands tries to write
her book, she becomes infatuated with eavesdropping on one of her
neighbor's depressed patients, played by ... you guessed it ... Mia
Farrow.  Listening to Farrow's emotional problems leads Rowlands to
question her own life: her marriages, her childhood, her cold personality,
and so forth.  In short, she has a major mid-life crisis.</P>
<P>   Rowlands gives a solid performance and is convincing as a woman
incapable of expressing either warmth or passion, but, unfortunately, her
character is not very likeable.  Rowlands appears in nearly every frame of
ANOTHER WOMAN, and in not one of these frames do you ever really care
about her.  If Allen wants us to invest our emotions in this character, he
needs to expose her charismatic side in addition to her repressed side.</P>
<P>   The movie has a fine (and sizeable) supporting cast--including Martha
Plimpton, David Ogden Stiers, and the late John Houseman in his final
role.  Betty Buckley instills a refreshing breath of life into the film
during her one minute cameo appearance.  However, Gene Hackman gives the
most engaging performance in the film (as Rowlands' unsuccessful suitor),
but his screen time is limited to only two scenes.  Allen keeps the movie
focussed exclusively on Rowlands and does not develop any of the other
characters; their sole purpose is to motivate Rowlands' introspective
reevaluation of her life.</P>
<P>   Although ANOTHER WOMAN is well-crafted and never boring, I had to ask
myself during the film: "Is this all there is?"  Allen's psychological
character study of this confused woman does not seem especially
enlightening or insightful.  Perhaps you have to be a 50-year-old in a
mid-life crisis to fully appreciate ANOTHER WOMAN.  Then again, you didn't
have to wake up 200 years into the future to appreciate SLEEPER.  Although
ANOTHER WOMAN may be Allen's most successful attempt at pure drama to
date, I can recommend it only to die hard fans who take pride in having
seen every film he has ever made.</P>
