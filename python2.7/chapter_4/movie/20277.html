<PRE>Wayne's World ** 1/2
Starring Mike Myers, Dana Carvey
Directed by Penelope Spheeris
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Wayne's World, the popular Myers/Carvey skit was from Saturday Night Live was
turned into a phenomenon when it was released in 1992. It spawned a sequel,
merchandising, and had several very memorable lines. But despite being funny, I
still don't think Wayne's World is that good of a movie.</P>
<P>Wayne (Myers) and Garth (Carvey) are two happening punk rock dudes that host a
weekly television show where they make fun of inventions and talk about what
makes them hot from their basement. When evil television executive Benjamin
Oliver (Rob Lowe) sees the show, he decides to exploit it and make it the next
big hit. Then Wayne meets Cassandra (Tia Carrare) the girl of his dreams who is
also being hit on by Benjamin. Garth must deal with the fact that Wayne has met
his first true love and that he's not his only friend anymore.</P>
<P>As the show gets picked up. Wayne and Garth find their show being changed way
too much. A sponsor from Noah's Arkade comes on to talk about their new video
games, and the title song is totally re-done. This is against the punk rocker
way, so Wayne, Garth, Cassandra, and others, must unite to beat the snobby
executives.</P>
<P>Yes, the film is very, very, funny. It features several memorable scenes (the
multiple endings being my favorite) and funny moments. But Wayne's World
doesn't have much else going for it. Alice Cooper also makes an appearance in
one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Looking for a laugh? You'll find it
here in the shallow Wayne's World, which gets ** 1/2 stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: The film contains some discussion of male erections and contains
bad attitudes by almost every member of the cast. Good Age: 9 & Up</P>
