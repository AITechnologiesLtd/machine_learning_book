<P>     On one hand are duties, obligations, and traditions.  On the other 
are needs, desires, and freedom.  Wars between these two antagonistic 
camps have been fought through the ages across many societies.  The 
battleground in Deepa Mehta's FIRE is modern-day New Delhi, where the 
role of the woman in being re-defined.  No longer do wives submit 
without question to the whims of their husbands, and this shift is 
causing tremors throughout the entire Indian culture.  FIRE shows the 
causes and effects of one such tiny reverberation.</P>
<P>     Sita (Nandita Das) is a romantic, and that is her undoing.  When 
marrying the handsome Jalin (Jaaved Jaaferi), she envisions a bright 
future, but instead finds a barren wasteland.  Her new husband has no 
interest in her.  His desire is for his Chinese mistress; his marriage 
to Sita serves one purpose:  to placate his family, who want him to have 
children.  Sita is not the only lonely woman in the household, however.  
Her sister-in-law, Radha (Shabana Azmi), is married to Jalin's older 
brother, Ashok (Kulbushan Kharbanda) – a man whose religious fanaticism 
has caused him to take a vow of celibacy.  Duty, not love, is what he 
demands from his wife.  In this environment, it is only natural that 
Sita and Radha become fast friends, and, in time, much more than that.  
But their love is not without its share of painful obstacles.  As Sita 
states, "In our language, no word exists for what we are to each other." </P>
<P>     FIRE is less a story of lesbian love than it is a statement of 
female emancipation.  This is the tale of two vital, beautiful women 
breaking their cultural obstacles and being reborn through the passion 
they express for each other.  Their relationship is forbidden, but it by 
giving into their feelings that they find the strength to defy their 
husbands and turn their backs on tradition.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, the film would not be as successful if the romance 
didn't work on an emotional level.  Mehta has created a pair of 
memorable characters who are easy to empathize with, and who 
gratifyingly are never transformed from flesh-and-blood individuals into 
mere symbols.  It also helps that the roles are acted with feeling and 
ability.  Both of the female leads, Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das, are 
capable performers who develop a genuine rapport with each other.  
Kulbushan Kharbanda is excellent at playing a pompous icon of self-
righteousness and Jaaved Jaaferi is equally detestable as the 
philandering newlywed.</P>
<P>     In addition to being emotionally and intellectually satisfying, 
FIRE is a treat for the eyes.  Mehta and cinematographer Giles Nuttgens 
have crafted a beautiful-looking film, rich with bright colors and 
silhouetted eroticism.  The sex scenes are photographed discreetly (only 
one breast is briefly glimpsed) with an eye for sensuality.  Mehta's 
approach to this aspect of the movie is indicative of the care and 
effort that she has invested in the entire production.  </P>
