<P> In the minds of most people, Oliver Stone's 1987 film "Wall Street" is
chiefly remembered today for Michael Douglas' frighteningly funny
performance as a suave but bloodthirsty trader and for having opened
only weeks after the stock market tumble.  However, to some young
people, particularly those who re-read "The Art of War" regularly and
live for sales on Armani suits, the movie is a vital cultural touchstone
full of such pearls of wisdom as "greed is good" and "lunch is for
wimps." Writer-director Ben Younger's "Boiler Room" would love to be the
"Wall Street" of the post-yuppie era, featuring a crew of
twentysomething warriors hot on the trail of their first million and
willing to do just about anything to close a deal or get a promotion.
 Unfortunately, "Boiler Room" doesn't have Douglas or anyone like him at
its wheel. Instead, Younger gives us Ben Affleck as Jim Young, a
no-nonsense pitchman who recruits hungry youngsters into the J.T. Marlin
brokerage with promises of endless cash and luxurious living, then all
but castrates the kids if they underperform. Affleck appears to have the
moxey to pull off the role, but, much to the movie's detriment, he's not
the main character.
 In fact, he's reduced to a glorified cameo role while we're asked to
care about shiftless Seth Davis (Giovanni Ribisi) who gave up running
daily card games out of his living room to enter the trading world after
seeing the Porsches and Ferraris in the J.T. Marlin parking lot. "I was
making good money at the casino," Seth tells us in his narration, "but
these guys were mackin' it hard."
 Sadly, Seth soon learns what J.T. Marlin founder Michael (Tom Everett
Scott) and his disciples are peddling is not but blue-chip stock but
worthless shares in make-believe companies. Didn't he ever stop to
wander why the firm had its offices on Long Island instead of in
Manhattan? Or why so much paper-shredding goes on after office hours?
 Perhaps in an attempt to ape David Mamet's shark-eat-shark drama
"Glengarry Glen Ross," Younger's script is proudly profane and goes out
of its way to make almost all the major characters thoroughly
unpleasant. But Mamet's work had real bite and fire, while "Boiler Room"
is ultimately a troubled-son morality play (with bad Dad as the villain)
dressed up in tough talk and a relentless rap soundtrack.
 As he proved in last year's fiasco "The Mod Squad," Ribisi, with his
blackened eyes and thick tongue, is definitely not hero material and he
looks woefully out of place in the company of Affleck, Vin Diesel and
Scott Caan, all of whom are convincingly slimy and cold-blooded. With
such a cipher at its center, "Boiler Room" wears out its welcome about
as quickly as a telemarketer calling during the dinner hour. James
