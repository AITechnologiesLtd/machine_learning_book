<P>Can't Hardly Wait (PG-13) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Trust me, you _can_ wait for this messy throwback to '80s teen comedies.
A big, post-graduation blowout bash is the setting at which a number of new
high school graduates set out to resolve some long-simmering issues, most
prominently the shy Preston's (Ethan Embry) unspoken love for the popular
Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who was just dumped by her jock boyfriend
Mike (Peter Facinelli).  This thread is supposed to be the emotional hook
of the piece, but it is done in by the underwritten character of Amanda;
Preston claims to see the "person inside" her glammed-up exterior, but the
audience is never treated to a glimpse of this purported interior soul.
All that shows up on screen is an above-it-all, constantly bitching snob,
and as such writer-directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont do a
disservice to the engaging performance of Embry.</P>
<P>Far more involving--and upstaging the central action--is a subplot
following the unlikely but inevitable romance between Preston's acerbic
best friend Denise (the delightful Lauren Ambrose) and Ebonics-spouting
white boy Kenny (a hilarious Seth Green), who find themselves locked in a
bathroom together.  This thread is sweet yet raucous, and often very funny,
which is the mix Kaplan and Elfont obviously strived for in their other
storylines.  But all else, including a predictable arc about the geeky
valedictorian's (Charlie Korsmo) beef with Mike, quickly grows tiresome, as
does the movie as a whole.</P>
