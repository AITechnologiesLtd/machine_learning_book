<PRE>       TOY STORY 2
       --------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           GRADE: A-</PRE>
<P>       I suppose an argument could be made that Toy Story is one of
       those films that didn't need a sequel. Beloved by kids and
       their parents, respected equally by mainstream America and
       geekish movie buffs, that first movie remains a landmark of
       recent history, the one that burst open the possibilities of
       computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention
       and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the Disney animation
       machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle
       entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal
       songwriting.</P>
<PRE>       If Disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game
       (Toy Story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions, and one
       that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as
       demand for action figures far outstripped supply), it didn't
       show, and as distributor and part-owner of the property, at
       least it had a piece of the action. Toy Story 2 was
       greenlighted as a direct-to-video project, Disney's standard
       tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises
       without expending the effort of developing a proper feature
       film.</PRE>
<P>       As someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad
       thing (granted, they usually are a bad thing, but that's
       because they're made for the wrong reasons), I had to wonder
       what in the world they were thinking. Fortunately, Disney
       claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests
       that they let Pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical
       sequel. Lucky thing, too -- like the first movie, this one is
       a joy to behold on the big screen, and technically, it
       improves on its predecessor on just about every level. (From
       a business standpoint, the end credits show that the new
       creations are copyrighted by Pixar, while the previous film's
       elements are shared between Pixar and Disney, a sign of the
       production house's new cachet in Hollywood.)</P>
<P>       Visually, the main shortcoming of this fully
       computer-generated movie is that human figures are still
       rendered relatively poorly, making them look a little creepy.
       Fortunately, that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the
       perspective of the movie, where the secret world of toys is
       more immediate, and arguably more attractive, than the world
       of the humans who surround them.</P>
<PRE>       As before, the story is predicated on the premise that the
       toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named Andy
       -- and, indeed, all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of
       all little children -- come to life in the child's absence.
       While the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among
       themselves, the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something
       to its owner. One of the subjects of this new film is the
       sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned, left on a
       shelf to gather dust, and another is the sort of emotional
       limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous
       collectors. Most often, those toys are packed away in dark
       spaces, safe from sunlight and humidity, and often they're
       not even removed from their packaging. Imagine what a chip
       that would put on your shoulder, and you'll understand the
       attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this
       movie.</PRE>
<P>       Sheriff Woody (voiced by a note-perfect Tom Hanks), the
       longtime favorite among Andy's toys who was challenged in the
       previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action
       figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), suffers an injury early in
       the film, when Andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam
       apart, revealing the stuffing inside. This accident catalyzes
       some uneasieness among the toys, who know too well that a
       broken toy is often a forgotten toy, and a forgotten toy is
       one that loses its reason for existence.</P>
<PRE>       Those anxieties are crystallized when Andy's mom tears
       through his living room, collecting old toys for a yard sale.
       And there's an ironic twist to the tale, as Woody winds up
       being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that
       quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell
       to a Japanese toy museum for a sizable sum. The rest of
       Andy's toys, who owe him quite a debt, resolve to rescue him.</PRE>
<P>       That this film manages to turn a box marked "25 cents" into a
       symbol of doom, or to make its screed against the retention
       of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a
       metaphysical dilemma, is a testament to its skill at
       metaphor, seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our
       real world into that of the toys. Operating on this level of
       abstraction, Toy Story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues
       without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness. (The
       worst I can say is that Randy Newman seems to have reserved
       his sappiest lyric in years for Sarah McLachlan, who stops
       the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark.)</P>
<P>       Sometimes I think Toy Story 2 tries too hard. There's
       somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that
       energized the first film, allowing it to surprise and excite
       on a near-constant basis, and more philosophizing about toys,
       collectors, the nature of happiness and the meaning of life.
       While that leads to fewer bellylaughs, it does make way for
       more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity
       that asks the toys to consider their own status as
       commodities that move in and out of fashion. (Just don't ask
       why Andy's favorite toy is based on a TV series that was
       canceled in 1957.)</P>
<P>       Where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome
       moment as the one where Buzz arrives at Al's Toy Barn to find
       it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers, Buzz
       Lightyear action figures? Forget the self-congratulatory
       science fiction of The Matrix -- this is a fundamental
       mind-bender for Buzz, and the audience shares his humility
       and wonderment at the sight. Here, as in the roughly
       concurrent scene where Woody watches tapes of the Howdy
       Doodyish children's TV show that originated his character, we
       see our protagonists come face-to-face with God.</P>
<PRE>       In sly ways, then, Toy Story 2 can be read as a film about
       mortality, a metaphorical consideration of aging and death.
       Significantly, the film's very first sequence concludes with
       a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a
       near-uproar. And toward the end, when Buzz and Woody
       speculate on how long they have before Andy grows up and
       discards his old toys, one of them observes, with an alacrity
       both inspirational and heartbreaking, that it will be fun
       while it lasts.</PRE>
<PRE>       So Toy Story 2 joins the tradition of children's stories,
       largely neglected of late, that say something real about the
       inevitable joys and tragedies of existence. What's really
       striking is that both Toy Story films (and, to a lesser
       degree, Pixar's A Bug's Life) are kids' movies with wit and
       sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult
       counterparts, not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly
       eye-candy is due from the Disney dream factory any given
       summer. It puts one in mind of the glory days of Chuck Jones
       and the old gang at Warner Bros. animation. I'm not sure
       Lasseter and his pals at Pixar will ever operate at quite
       that level of purely visual invention -- they love
       traditional narrative too much -- but, boy, it makes me
       wonder what they might come up with next.</PRE>
