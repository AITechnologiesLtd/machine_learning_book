FIRELIGHT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     The impoverished Elisabeth has been paid 500 pounds, which in the 
early 1800s when the story FIRELIGHT is set would have been a 
considerable fortune.  All she has to do is travel from her native 
Switzerland across the sea to England and spend three nights with a 
stranger in order to conceive his child.  (Apparently getting pregnant 
was easier and more certain in days gone by.) They are never to be seen 
together then or after.  And she has to give up the child immediately 
after its birth.</P>
<P>     All goes according to plan until Elisabeth, played with fetching 
beauty and intense conviction by Sophie Marceau from ANNA KARENINA and 
BRAVEHEART, decides to find her long lost daughter.  After composing 
numerous unsent letters to her "English daughter," she arranges to 
become her governess.</P>
<P>     The seven-year-old child, Louisa (Dominique Belcourt), has become a 
hellion who goes through several governesses a year.  Her overindulgent 
father, Charles Godwin, is played with tenderness by Stephen Dillane 
from DEJA VU and WELCOME TO SARAJEVO.  Charles doesn't seem to mind that 
his child throws one temper tantrum after another.  He just wants her to 
be happy, and disciplining her seems cruel to him.  John lives with his 
comatose wife, his spoiled daughter, and an understanding sister-in-law, 
who runs the house for him with the expectation that he will want to 
marry her when her sister finally dies completely.</P>
<P>     When John realizes whom he has accidentally hired as Louisa's new 
governess, he orders Elisabeth to leave immediately, but he finds out 
that governesses need a month to find a new situation.  During that 
month, Elisabeth is determined to make Louisa want to learn how to read.  
She uses a tough love approach, locking them in the room together.  She 
promises John that anything she does to Louisa, she will do to herself 
as well.  When she throws paint at Louisa to punish her, she does the 
same to herself.</P>
<P>     Kevin Anderson has a minor part as the sincere sheepherder from 
Ohio, John Taylor, who is visiting his friend Charles.  With his 
wide-brimmed felt hat, John is dashingly handsome and would like nothing 
better than to take Elisabeth home to America as his bride.</P>
<P>     The best and most touching scene comes when Louisa realizes that 
her teacher is her mother.  Handled delicately but movingly, it is 
likely to reduce many to tears.</P>
<P>     The writer of NELL and SHADOWLANDS, William Nicholson writes and 
for the first time directs in FIRELIGHT.  Although the film is pure 
formula, it is so well executed that the audience soon forgets that 
they've seen all of this before.  The actors make the characters so 
genuine and touching that one doesn't mind the film's being so 
predictable.</P>
<P>     Nicholson devotes careful attention to the smallest details.  "All 
these huge rooms, and we live less than three feet from the fire," John 
reflects, reminding us how cold those large estate homes must have been.</P>
<P>     The movie focuses on three questions.  Will John throw the new 
governess out after a month as he promised?  Will his old passion for 
her be rekindled?  And will Louisa break out of her shell and end her 
defiance?  Yes, these are all easily guessed, but the beauty of 
FIRELIGHT is that it still radiates a special magic in its presentation.</P>
<P>     FIRELIGHT runs 1:43.  It is rated R for sex, nudity and brief 
profanity and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
<PRE>     The film has just begun to open in the United States.  In the San 
Jose area it has not yet opened.</PRE>
