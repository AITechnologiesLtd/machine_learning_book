BRIDE OF THE WIND
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Being married to a musical genius can be a humbling experience, and Alma 
Mahler isn't the type who handles humility well.  She's a free-spirited 
woman who despises being relegated to the role of a supporting player in 
her husband's triumphs. </P>
<P>BRIDE OF THE WIND, by director Bruce Beresford (DRIVING MISS DAISY), is 
a hurried, Cliff Notes version of the life of Alma Mahler, the young 
wife of composer Gustav Mahler and the lover of many other famous 
people.  The movie is saved by Mahler's sublime and ever-present music 
and by first-time screenwriter Marilyn Levy's sporadic flourishes of 
brilliance.  Sarah Wynter delivers an enigmatic performance as Alma, and 
Jonathan Pryce (TOMORROW NEVER DIES) gives a convincingly reserved 
version of Gustav.</P>
<P>The story, which spans several decades, starts in Vienna in 1902 at a 
time when conductor Gustav Mahler was very early in his composing 
career.  If there were a single thing that I could change about the 
film, it would be in the music mix.  Mahler was a powerful symphonic 
composer, but much of the film's wonderful background music has been 
mixed so that solo instruments overwhelm the rest of the orchestra.  The 
movie's most impressive moments occur precisely when the full force of 
Mahler's symphonic scoring is heard.  The best scene occurs when 
Mahler's opulent, horsedrawn hearse is pulled through Vienna as his 
music blasts away, mixed with rolling thunder from the storm brewing 
overhead.</P>
<P>Especially at first, Alma is not moved by her future husband's 
compositions, calling them "thematically disorganized and repetitive."  
An artist friend of hers reassures her that Mahler's music is "much 
better than it sounds," stealing a Mark Twain quote about Wagner.</P>
<P>Alma casts aside her current flame in order to seduce the shy and 
awkward Gustav, who has an undeserved reputation as a ladies' man.  An 
accomplished pianist and composer herself, she is asked by Gustav, as 
the price of a marriage ticket, that she abandon her career since there 
can be only one music in the family, his.  </P>
<P>Their initially happy life together is first shown being jarred by his 
proclivity for tragic musical compositions, as his one about the death 
of a child.  A few years later one of their two daughters dies, causing 
irreparable damage to the Mahler family.  This untimely death breaks 
both of the parent's hearts, and Gustav is diagnosed as having a 
congenital heart defect.</P>
<P>Alma seems inherently incapable of staying in monogamous relationships, 
but she does have a gift for attracting extremely talented men, 
including famous architect Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven), 
expressionist painter Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez), and writer and 
poet Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg).  A woman who doesn't take kindly to 
blending into the background, she appears to have made the wrong 
decision in marrying Mahler, or any man for that matter.  Still, her 
loyalty to a husband on whom she is cheating is fascinating.  When 
Gropius asks her to leave Gustav in order to run away with him, she 
turns him down flat.  She tells him that her husband needs her, and, 
after all, "He's Gustav Mahler!"  After his death, she increasingly 
worships him, much more than she did while he was alive.</P>
<P>A movie that is too often in a hurry to cover all of Alma's life, it 
does pause every now and then to offer tidbits of wisdom.  Oskar, who 
hates having to make love to Alma while the bronzed bust of the dead 
Gustav looks down upon them, tries to convince Alma that he is a more 
attentive lover than Gustav ever was.  After all, Oskar points out, he 
is willing to stop work in midday in order to have sex with her, 
something than Gustav never did.  When Alma replies that Gustav was too 
busy, Oskar tells her that "time is the money of love."</P>
<P>BRIDE OF THE WIND runs 1:39.  It is rated R for some sex and nudity and 
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, June 15, 2001.  
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
