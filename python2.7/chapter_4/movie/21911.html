Reviewed by Dustin Putman, November 27, 1999.</P>
<P>In Arnold Schwarzegger's very first starring role since 1996's "Eraser" (and 
not counting the embarrassing 1997 debacle "Batman & Robin"), Peter Hyams' 
"End of Days" is, on the one hand, an intelligent film choice, but on the 
other hand, a not-so-good one. In his role as ex-cop Jericho Cane, 
Schwarzenegger has more substance to work with than usual, because he is a 
washed-up, borderline alcoholic still grieving over the untimely murders of 
his wife and daughter. He handles his character well, and for someone who 
oftentimes is criticized for his thespian skills, he believably conveys the 
true loss of loved ones. The problem with "End of Days" isn't Schwarzenegger, 
and it isn't the nifty visual effects, or the other performances. No, the 
source of the dilemma stems squarely from the ham-handed screenplay, by 
Andrew W. Marlowe, which not only lays on the melodrama a little thick in the 
second half, but also wastes much of the opportunity to make a rousing, 
unforgettable, end-of-the-millenium thriller. As New Year's approaches and 
you'd like to check out a movie set on the eve of the 21st-century, rent one 
of the decade's most innovative, underrated films, 1995's "Strange Days."</P>
<P>Opening in NYC, circa 1979, a woman gives birth to a child, which is then 
briefly taken away from her to be involved in a snake sacrifice on the grungy 
basement level of the hospital. It seems this baby has been chosen as the one 
to be impregnated between the hours of 11 o'clock and midnight on December 
31, 1999, thus ending the world. Yes, I'm sure this sounds silly so far, but 
at least a character wisely asks if they mean Eastern Standard Time. Switch 
forward to the final week of the millenium, the baby has grown up to be 
20-year-old Christine York (Robin Tunney), a young woman who unknowingly has 
been hunted down for her whole life, and who has the ability to see things 
that aren't really there--or, at least, things that seem to only be in her 
imagination. Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, a wavery entity makes 
its way into a ritzy restaurant, travels into the bathroom, and enters the 
body of an unidentified businessman (Gabriel Byrne). Of course, we know out 
of common sense that it is the spirit of Satan himself, come to conceive of a 
child with Christine. Enter Jericho and his partner Chicago (Kevin Pollak), 
who unwittingly get involved in the satanic plot after investigating a 
mysterious gunman in the hospital, who turned out to be a priest.</P>
<P>Coming to theaters after the similarly religious-themed "Stigmata," "End of 
Days" is a better film, overall, simply because it introduces two 
protagonists (Jericho and Christine) that are at least likable enough to root 
for, unlike the central character in the former picture (played by Patricia 
Arquette), who was a slutty dimwit. Since "End of Days" is supposed to be 
nothing more than an entertaining popcorn movie (which it somewhat succeeds 
at), I can forgive most of its far-fetched nature, but some of it is such 
blatant rubbish that you can't help but snicker. A virtuous priest (Rod 
Steiger, in his first role that calls for him to actually act in years), for 
example, discusses how the number of the Devil, 666, actually means 999 if 
turned around. Add a "1" in front of it and you get 1999. If this is supposed 
to be anything but laughable, religious hogwash, then my first name is Merv.</P>
<P>New Year's Eve in 1999 is such an obviously provocative setting for a film 
that it is an unfortunate shame director Peter Hyams (1997's "The Relic") 
chooses to not put it to any notable use. With an alleged budget of 
$100-million, no one can tell me the filmmakers didn't have enough money to 
really throw caution to the wind and make an action-thriller that is 
something truly special and one-of-a-kind. As is, the only impressive visual 
effects are the effective ripples in the air that signify the Dark Side, and 
the demonic face of Satan that appears in a wave of fire in the otherwise 
cheesy climax.</P>
<P>As proven in "The Relic," Hyams may not be a master of building and 
developing characters, but he sure does know how to set up an action 
sequence, with no more valid example than the one edge-of-your-seat setpiece 
in the second half, which takes place on the subway. Nicely built-up and even 
suspenseful (one moment--the only in the whole movie--really startled me), 
the scene plays itself out to a stirring conclusion.</P>
<P>Gabriel Byrne, seemingly borrowing some of Al Pacino's mannerisms from the 
much-better 1997 horror film, "Devil's Advocate," is exceptionally menacing 
and appropriately cast as the ultimate villain. Byrne, who coincidentally 
portrayed a priest in "Stigmata," is, like in that film, the highlight of the 
cast. No matter what the role, Byrne takes himself, grabs the character 
tightly, and seems to make it his own, as if it was written for no one else.</P>
<P>"End of Days" isn't a bad movie by any means; it's just a reasonably silly 
one that, in one form or the other, has been overdone to death. There are no 
true surprises in the course of the whole film (aside from the aforementioned 
unconvincing and cornball twist at the end), nor does it even attempt to want 
to make any sense. After a sizable hiatus, Schwarzenegger is back in top 
form, but I think it's about time for this "End of Days" to signal the end of 
a well-worn, tiresome subgenre.</P>
