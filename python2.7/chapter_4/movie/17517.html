Review:                TANGO        </PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Miguel Angel Sola,  Cecilia Narova, 
                Mia Maestro, Juan Carlos Copes
                Juan Luis Galiardo</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by:        Carlos Saura</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse, the SILVER Screen Critic</PRE>
<P>This is a foreign language film, with subtitles.  That doesn't matter at
all.  You could enjoy this movie just by listening to the music.  The name
Lalo Schifrin is synonymous with wonderful music.  Add the tango to it and
you have a mesmerizing combination.   The world-renowned cinematographer
Vittorio Storaro [Apocalypse Now] has centered on various close-ups of
feet, the piano, etc.  The color is vivid.  Everything about the movie is
great - except for the story.</P>
<P>There are so many things going on that the plot is impossible to follow. 
It jumps from real life, to imagination, to memories, to history, and back
and forth.  Miguel Angel Sola portrays Mario Saurez, a director who walks
with a cane. We're never certain whether the leg injury is permanent or
not.  Cecilia Narova is Laura Fuentes, a dancer who was either his wife,
his girlfriend, or his dancing partner.  She is lovely and is a fabulous
dancer, especially when she is with Juan Carlos Copes who portrays Carlos
Nebbia,  an older dancer who continues to do what he loves…the Tango.</P>
<P>Mia Maestro is cast as the new young dancer, Elena Flores, a `friend' of
Mario's investor, Angelo Larroca [Juan Luis Galiardo] who convinces Mario
to give the girl a chance.    He gives her more than that!   They have
some fairly torrid love scenes despite the danger that they face if Angelo
discovers their affair.  Again, even that is confusing.  He imagines
things, and some things actually occur.  It's just impossible to know
which is which.  Luckily, most of these scenes are done in dance, the
Tango.  This is more like a ballet or an opera than a movie with music and
dancing.  It's beautiful.  I wouldn't mind seeing it again, but I know
that I want to get the CD of the music.  I give it a B.</P>
<PRE>SEE YOU AT THE MOVIES.</PRE>
