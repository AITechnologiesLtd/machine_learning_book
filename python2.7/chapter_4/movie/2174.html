<P>Motion pictures about mental illness can take many different forms.  They 
can be "feel good" experiences like AWAKENINGS, powerful dramas like ONE 
FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST, blood-curdling thrillers like THE SHINING, 
moronic comedies like CRAZY PEOPLE, or stories lacking any foundation in 
reality like BENNY AND JOON.  Unfortunately MR. JONES, the latest in a 
long line of these movies, falls decisively in the final category.  The 
plot actually might have been kind of sweet if it wasn't so completely 
unbelievable.</P>
<P>Mr. Jones (Richard Gere) is, in his own words, a man with a "grandiose" 
personality - a child in a grown-up's body.  However, by the definition 
of his psychiatrist (Lena Olin as Dr. Libbie Bowen), he's a "bipolar 
manic depressive", which means that his mood swings tilt wildly from 
exuberance to dejection.  Unfortunately for Mr. Jones, Libbie is right, 
and he soon finds himself in a mental hospital fighting to cope with his 
problem so that he doesn't throw himself off a rooftop in a futile 
attempt to fly.  During the course of his treatment, however, an amazing 
thing happens:  Libbie and Mr. Jones fall in love, save each other's 
lives, and sleep together - and she never finds out his first name.</P>
<P>It's never difficult to be cynical about run-of-the-mill love stories - 
most of them lend themselves easily to flippant remarks - but MR. JONES 
is so littered with implausibilities that it's a classic example of 
something awaiting a skewering.  Nevertheless, I'll start out with a few 
kind words:  this picture isn't boring and it succeeded in retaining my 
attention for the unnecessarily-long running time of one-hundred fourteen 
minutes.  Those who swoon at the mere mention of a weepy romance will 
probably enjoy this no matter what I say, as will fans of Richard Gere.</P>
<P>One of the primary rules of psychiatry is not to get involved with the 
patient.  So why is it that in movies, this rule is so often broken?  It 
happens again here, and for no good reason (other than that the story 
would have no place to go without this development).  Libbie has plenty 
of opportunities to keep things from going too far, but she doesn't act 
until it's too late.  Some people have no concern for ethics or 
propriety.</P>
<P>While there's something admittedly compelling about the character of Mr. 
Jones, very little about the man makes any sense, and the argument that 
he has a mental disorder is not a valid excuse for this inconsistent 
characterization.  He's Hollywood's cliche-riddled vision of the manic 
depressive, and he's stuck wandering around in a story that consistently 
veers towards the preposterous.  The central element of the movie, the 
love story, is something that never should have happened.  As a result, 
its presence creates a dissonance that permeates the film.</P>
<P>In far too many movies (such as PRETTY WOMAN and FINAL ANALYSIS), Richard 
Gere has marched through his roles zombie-like, with hardly a change in 
expression and little attempt at passion.  In MR. JONES, he goes to the 
other extreme, overacting is a way that is actually enjoyable to watch.  
Sure, this isn't a great performance, but Gere is undeniably charming 
when he emotes this much.  </P>
<P>Lena Olin, who was so playfully sensual in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF 
BEING, seems to have caught the stoic bug from Gere.  Frankly, she's 
incredibly dull, and it becomes a chore trying to sympathize with her 
character.  It's difficult to accept that even Mr. Jones' white-hot flame 
could melt through Libbie's icy exterior.  Added to that is the doctor's 
Swedish accent which occasionally renders a line or two incomprehensible 
(including a crucial plea to Mr. Jones in the middle of a rain storm).</P>
<P>Anne Bancroft has little more screen time than Libbie's cat, and probably 
doesn't turn in as impressive a performance.  What she's doing in this 
movie is something of a mystery.  Also turning up are Bill Pullman and 
Sheryl Lee (the infamous Laura Palmer from TV's Twin Peaks), neither of 
whose names appear in the final credits.  The only actor in this 
production who can legitimately be proud of his work is Delroy Lindo (as 
Jones' friend Howard), but he's not on screen nearly enough.</P>
<P>I often have problems with movies that go for the too-easy, fairy tale 
ending.  MR. JONES has all the subtlety of a Greek tragedy, and the 
screenwriters should have treated the concluding scenes appropriately.  
What do we get, however?  I won't explicitly reveal what happens, but 
suffice it to say that this is a Richard Gere executive-produced 
Hollywood concoction.  That just about says all that needs to be said.</P>
<P>It has always seemed insensitive to use mental illness as a form of comic 
relief, and that's exactly what MR. JONES does on several occasions.  To 
the film's credit, it tries to balance its presentation of the hospital's 
residents, but there's something that still smacks of exploitation.  
After all, when you get to the core of the matter, Mr. Jones' manic 
depressive problems are nothing more than a plot device to complicate the 
romance between the two main characters.</P>
<P>See MR. JONES at your own risk.  Those who enjoy such excruciatingly 
manipulative experiences like Untamed Heart will probably come out of 
this movie spouting words of praise.  Those who could do without that 
sort of melodrama would do better looking elsewhere.  There's not much of 
substance in MR. JONES.  Worse movies can be found in abundance, but this 
one's a little too empty for my taste.   </P>
