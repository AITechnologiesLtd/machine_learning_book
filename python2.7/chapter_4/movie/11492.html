A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Randall Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART)</P>
<P>Written by: Randall Wallace, from the Alexandre Dumas class novel</P>
<P>Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard
Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, Peter Sarsgaard, Judith Godreche, Anne
Parillaud</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Musketeers, greedy boy king, fancy costumes, father-son themes</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Is there such thing as swashbuckler movie that has no swashbuckling in
it? THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK comes close. It's an action drama, but I
hesitate to use the word action.</P>
<P>The first hour and a half takes a long time. Basically it takes ninety
minutes to portray that 1600s ruler young Louis XIV of France (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is ice-hearted and cares little for his people. The last half
hour is fast: three old retired guys (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and
Gerard Depardieu) plot treason. They try to secretly get rid of evil
king Louis XIV and switch him with a kindhearted look-alike. Meanwhile
their dear friend d'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), an expert swordsman who
has ties to Louis XIV and is also chief of the royal security force,
must decide whether his loyalties lie with the evil king or with his old
friends. In the end we learn why former hero d'Artagnan supported such a
bad king in the first place. </P>
<P>THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is actually a film version of a French literary
classic written by Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870), an author and playwright
best known for writing entertaining historical fiction. Dumas wrote the
‘three musketeers' trilogy (THE THREE MUSKETEERS, TWENTY YEARS AFTER,
and LE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE). LE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE, when translated
into English is subdivided into three smaller works; THE MAN IN THE IRON
MASK is the third of the smaller stories.</P>
<P>Opinion: 
Fans of TITANIC actor and recent Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo Dicaprio
get to see him wear a lot of hunky French period clothing as King Louis.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK also features an all star cast under the
competent direction of Randall Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART). </P>
<P>Unfortunately, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK rambles and wanders for an hour
and a half. Only the last half hour of the film has some kind of clear
goal or focus. In addition, the script feels strangely one step removed
from ‘real' action or drama. For example, the movie has many chances to
show the tortured faces and poignant memories of main characters, but
instead, we get to see characters sit down and say things like, "I'm
doing this because I feel guilty." Instead of showing a man's face and
his memories of raising a son for twenty years, we see a guy merely sit
down and pout and say, "I'm doing this because I raised a son for 20
years."  Or instead of showing the reverence that all musketeers have
for courage, valor, and heroism, a character merely announces, "They
revere us." Put simply, the dialogue in THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
resembles a group therapy session, where there is much talking about
action and drama but the actual action or drama is sparse.</P>
<P>The other deficiency of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is that it doesn't let
us get to know the main characters.  For example, when Athos' son Raoul
dies because of the treachery of the evil King Louis, the audience is
supposed to care. But nobody in the audience knows Raoul and nobody
cares about him because the movie barely shows Raoul or bothers to
develop him. Later of course, Athos TALKS about Raoul, but that's
therapy talk again.</P>
<P>In THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, the retired guys are supposed to be the
heroes. But a good solid focus on them doesn't appear until after 90
minutes have elapsed, so we aren't given enough time to know who they
are or care about their plan or their fate. </P>
<PRE>The last 40 minutes is pretty good.</PRE>
