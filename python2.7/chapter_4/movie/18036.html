<P>Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe. Rated R.</P>
<P>It's odd how movies tend come in pairs or in threes. Last year we had two
asteroid movies and two computer animated movies about bugs open at about the
same time, and many Hollywood analysts have commented on the strangeness of
the situation. In 1999, we are lucky enough to receive three -- count 'em --
three movies about virtual reality and video games of the mind. The first of
the group was The Matrix, an exquisite, exciting thriller that still sticks
with me almost a month after I first saw it. In May, Roland Emmerich,
director of the abysmal Independence Day and Godzilla will produce The
Thirteenth Floor which seems very similar to The Matrix.</P>
<P>But even without having seen The Thirteenth Floor I can tell you right now
that the weirdest of the bunch is far and away David Cronenberg's eXistenZ
(pronounced sort of like "existence" but with the accent on the last
syllable), a genuinely odd, sexually charged meditation on distortion of our
perceptions, video games' increasing tendency to try and imitate reality as
well as -- perhaps -- the fear of sex. It is a movie that exists in almost a
dreamlike state, eminently watchable but too bizarre to really involve its
audience personally. That is not a criticism, but only a statement.</P>
<P>Allegra Geller, a hot young game designer is ready to try out her new virtual
reality game "eXistenZ," but not all goes as planned. Shouting out the
kitschy slogan "Death to the Demon Allegra Geller," a visitor attacks with a
gun made of flesh and bone. Fortunately, Geller and a guy named Ted (Jude
Law) are able to escape and hide out.</P>
<P>The game controllers called fleshpods are likewise made of flesh -- they're
living things. And to make sure that her game pod still works and that her
game is safe inside it, Geller decides to play a round with Ted.</P>
<P>Even though that doesn't sound like much of a plot, it is and you'll
understand why if you see this meticulously structured, deeply layered
vision. Canadian director David Cronenberg, who made last year's
controversially shallow Crash is out to frighten us in eXistenZ, with
fittingly gory, convincing effects as well as spooky ideas running throughout
the film.</P>
<P>Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an energetic performance as Allegra and the
charismatic Jude Law plays the opposite of his self-confident Gattaca
character in eXistenZ. Law's Ted is a video game virgin who is forced to
learn fast to perhaps save himself and Allegra. Ian Holm has a terrific
supporting role in the game -- he does a mean accent, even though I don't
know what accent that was supposed to be.</P>
<P>eXistenZ is curiously alluring. Despite the occasionally repulsive gore, the
movie's slow, steady pace and offbeat rhythm are almost hypnotic. David
Cronenberg did a very good job of making me interested in the plot while
keeping me slightly detached, at an observing distance, if you will, thus
letting the story work as an allegory more than a horror film or a thriller.</P>
<P>Cronenberg's deftness behind the camera, attractive performances from the
leads as well as a few subtle, hidden universal themes make eXistenZ a
keeper. And if he doesn't go back to the likes of Crash, David Cronenberg is
a keeper too. ©1999 Eugene Novikov&#137;</P>
