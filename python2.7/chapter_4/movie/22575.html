<P>`Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman in ‘Man on the Moon'.'</P>
<P>You may think Universal has intended this tagline, which has been
attached to the poster and commercial advertising campaign of the new
Andy Kaufman biopic, merely to reveal the role Carrey is playing. But
there is more to it than just that. Carrey doesn't settle on a simple
recreation of the late comedian, he inhabits the role - climbing right
into Kaufman's skin -  to deliver a triumphant performance so borderline
accurate that many will find the comparison to be frightening. This is
one of the most dedicated and remarkable performances I've ever
witnessed on screen. Carrey is already a dead ringer for the daring
comic, but he also envelops every ounce of his character to such a
startling degree we believe that this could be out-takes of the real
Andy Kaufman.</P>
<P>Now, if you've heard that Carrey is essentially the entire show, you've
heard right. But he's just so damn entertaining. Watching the gifted
comedian reenact all of Andy Kaufman's comic shenanigans - the
wrestling, the stand-up, the Latka - is truly an astonishing spectacle
to admire. `Man on the Moon' charts, with a sure-footed approach,
everything from Kaufman's rise to fame on the sitcom `Taxi' to his
sudden death from lung cancer in 1984. Is there really any exploration
into Kaufman's character, or some indication given of his aspirations as
an out-of-control comic? No. For the most part, director Milos Forman
leads us through `Man on the Moon' from the perspective of a curious
outsider. Andy Kaufman was hilarious to some, offensive and obnoxious to
others....and his actual nature remains a mystery to many (including the
filmmakers).</P>
<P>The film opens in a thoroughly ingenious and side-splitting manner, as
Carrey makes his first appearance as Kaufman on a black-and-white
backdrop. He explains that the movie actually sucks because many
significant details of his life have been edited and removed. He then
adds he has since edited the movie to meet his approval....and,
strangely enough, the film is now completely over. Carrey watches from
the sideline as the credits begin to roll, impatiently rolling his eyes
and swinging his arms - until the screen goes black. After an extended
moment of silence, which may cause slight confusion for some audience
members, Andy's head pops into the screen and explains he was merely
showcasing his unusual brand of humor. And then, the biographical side
of the movie commences.</P>
<P>This is the one and only time we see a flashback of Andy as a child, and
then Forman abruptly skips ahead to the introduction of agent George
Shapiro (Danny DeVito), who is impressed by Andy's stand-up routine and
offers him a stab at showbiz. From here, Andy's trails lead him to a
musical guest spot on `Saturday Night Live', where he mouths the words
to the `Mighty Mouse' theme song (to the audience's subsequent delight).
The chance of a lifetime knocks at the door when Andy is offered a role
on the sitcom `Taxi', where he is to translate his Foreign Man character
(previously seen on `Hollywood Squares') into an immigrant mechanic
named Latka. Andy sees sitcoms as the lowest form of humor, and demands
a few additional requirements; namely four separate guest spots for
Vegas lounge singer Tony Clifton - who (unbeknownst to many) is actually
Andy's obnoxious alter ego. Carrey's introductory appearance as Clifton
- a chubby, ill-tempered jerk layered with prosthetic makeup - receives
gales of laughter. The actor's immeasurable talent comes in handy in
imitating the absurd and shocking lengths Kaufman would go to for the
purpose of humor.</P>
<P>Both DeVito and Paul Giamatti (playing writing cohort and buddy Bob
Zmuda) are kept at a distance, but with their undeniable talent and
admirable restraint, they deliver adequate performances. A similar fate
is dealt to Courtney Love (who previously appeared in Forman's `The
People Vs Larry Flynt') as love interest Lynn Marguiles, an outsider who
is baffled by a great majority of Kaufman's outrageous (and prolonged)
acts. Love is terribly under-used, but her scenes with Carrey strike a
certain poignancy, and minor details of their relationship are charming.
There are amusing cameos from the former cast of `Taxi' (including
Christopher Lloyd, Carol Kane, Judd Hirsch and Marilu Henner), but this
is strictly Jim Carrey's turf. Even close friends and relatives of Andy
have been astonished by his dead-on portrayal. The research process
Carrey must have gone through is almost unfathomable.</P>
<P>Forman directs in a wise, entertaining manner - but do we truly realize
who Andy Kaufman was and what he was striving for? `Man on the Moon'
lacks the answer to a few vitally important questions, but at the same
time, it celebrates Andy Kaufman's life with more dedication and proper
acceptance than any other recreation could. Perhaps the true inner being
of Andy Kaufman was best left to Kaufman himself - but his story is
certainly an entertaining one.</P>
