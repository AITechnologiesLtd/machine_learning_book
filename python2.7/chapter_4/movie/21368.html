Susan Granger's review of "THE BEST MAN" (Universal Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Remember Taye Diggs, the actor who played Angela Bassett's
lover in "How Stella Got Her Groove Back"?  Enough people were so
impressed with him that he's got a romantic comedy of his own. Diggs
plays a Chicago-based fledgling novelist whose upcoming book,
"Unfinished Business," about his college experiences, has his friends
buzzing, particularly regarding the steamy sections revolving around
who-slept-with-whom. It's already been endorsed by Oprah Winfrey and
an advance copy is doing the rounds prior to the upcoming marriage of
a New York Giants running back, Morris Chestnut, and his longtime
girl-friend, Monica Calhoun. It's a celebratory weekend in New York
that will reunite the successful African-American college crowd once
again as they face some of life's major dilemmas. Diggs is trying to
dodge making a marital commitment to his current girlfriend, Sanaa
Lathan, primarily because a sexy, ambitious TV producer, Nia Long, is,
as one of his buddies comments, "the best girlfriend you never had,"
while laid-back Harold Perrineau seems to be firmly attached to
domineering Melissa De Sousa, whom everyone knows is wrong for him,
and Terrence Howard continues to be a perennial bachelor as well as a
perennial student. Writer-director Malcolm D. Lee, a cousin of Spike
Lee whose company produced the film, quickly demonstrates that
film-making talent runs in the family, having genuine good fun with
the universality of intimate male/female relationships, at least from
the male perspective. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Best
Man" is an amusing, energetic 7 - and stick around for the
credits. Like "The Blair Witch Project," the hype for this date movie
began on the Internet, building anticipation for a whalloping opening
weekend.</P>
