                       A film review by George McAdams
                        Copyright 1996 George McAdams</PRE>
<PRE>Movie Grade 3.5 out of 4, Web Site Grade 4 out of 4</PRE>
<P>Moviegoers have reasons to begin celebrating the early arrival of the
holiday season with the pre-Thanksgiving release of "Ransom (
<A HREF="http://www.movies.com/rn/shock.html">http://www.movies.com/rn/shock.html</A> ), Ron Howard's latest film,
starring Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, Delroy Lindo, and Gary Sinise. With the
expected glut of sugar-coated holiday films just around the corner, this
is one you'll be able to return to for repeated viewings; however, don't
get out your magnifying glass too much, or you'll find some scenes will
leave you with questions.</P>
<P>This emotional action/drama that centers around the kidnapping of the
son of an airline mogul, Tom Mullen, played by Gibson, delivers the
wrenching conflicts of parents faced with the dilemma of how to get back
their son from an abductor, played by Sinise, whose systematic plan to
obtain a ransom is second only in his desire to get plebe's justice from
the rich Gibson, which adds more psychological weight to the
teeter-tottering the protagonist and antagonist give each other with
each downward thrust of their human character. While most kidnappings
envolve around the waiting and wondering about whether the person
kidnapped will be released, Gibson takes control of the situation by
using the ransom as a $2,000,000 reward for the person who turns-in the
kidnappers.</P>
<P>The righteous indignation displayed by Gibson is similar to others in
films, Harrison Ford in "Patriot Games," and even Charlie Sheen in "Wall
Street," come to mind; but, Gibson transcends this one-level response by
his physical reaction to the dramatic landmind that explodes when he
collapses soon after he realizes his proactive actions may have led to
his son being shot by the kidnappers.</P>
<P>Ransom is a movie that fully delivers, with none of the actors giving a
weak, or even lukewarm, performance. Even young Brawley Nolte, Nick
Nolte's son, deliver's out-of-the-gate. The small twists of illogic that
crop-up from time to time, only serve as reminders of just how complex
movies are, but given that Howard has worked dramas before, "Backdraft,"
et.al., it is disappointing that they are there.</P>
