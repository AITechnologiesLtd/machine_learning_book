<PRE>"The Three Kings" -- War Film Highness
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>There's a terrific scene when George Clooney describes
what happens when a person gets shot.  The worst part,
he says, isn't even the pain that is felt when the
bullet enters the body.  It's what happens afterwards,
as the bullet fragment completely wreaks havoc to the
body's internal organs.  An unseen chain reaction
begins to happen, and its ultimate effect is far
graver than anything that can actually be seen.  </P>
<P>This scene is especially appropriate to the backdrop
of the story, which takes place just after the end of
Operation Desert Storm.  While many soldiers happily
accepted their mission to 'liberate Kuwait' from Iraqi
occupation, they didn't necessarily know or understand
the ramifications of their actions.  When the American
bullet pierced the body of Iraq, damage was done in
ways that the allied forces probably never knew about.
 Why might that be?  Probably it was because we fought
such a high-tech war that, for a large part of it,
soldiers never even had to leave their bases. With
America's vast array of spying equipment and arsenal
of missiles that could accurately hit a stop sign on
any street corner, Desert Storm was very much a
faceless war.</P>
<P>"The Three Kings" is a fine film about a small group
of soldiers who venture out beyond where most soldiers
have gone during Operation Desert Storm and see things
that others never did.  When an Iraqi prisoner of war
is searched, a map is found that shows where the Iraqi
government has hidden millions in stolen Kuwaiti
bullion.  But instead of reporting it, the soldiers
decide to fetch the gold for themselves.  Troy Barlow
(Mark Wahlberg) will risk his life because he's a new
father and the money will come in handy.  Chief (Ice
Cube) wants to be a part of it because he feels that
God has put the gold within his reach for a reason. 
And Archie Gates, a Special Forces soldier (George
Clooney) is strictly motivated by greed.  Also along
for the ride is Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), an extremely
naïve boy who idolizes Barlow and wants to see some
combat action.  They don't tell their superiors what
they are about to do and also must dodge an
inquisitive and news-hungry reporter at the base (Nora
Dunn).  But the plan is simple.  Locate the bunker
with the gold, enter the bunker, take the gold, and
leave.  By claiming that they were sent to retrieve
the gold, the Iraqi guards will probably ignore them
while they load up.  </P>
<P>As they are about to leave with their booty, they see
that Iraqi soldiers have shot an innocent woman.  She
is one of many citizens who are doing what they can to
rise up (as President Bush urged at the end of the
war) against the current regime.  Other villagers will
undoubtedly be executed.  A tense standoff between
American and Iraqi soldiers occurs.  `Stick to the
plan,' yells Barlow.  But Gates has made up his mind. 
He can't let these people be slaughtered.  He decides
to help them, an act that greatly risks his military
standing, all of the gold, and even his life.</P>
<P>Like all good war films, the story that drives the
movie is not about war, but rather the moral
implications that arise as a result of it.  `Three
Kings' makes no effort to hide its strong political
undercurrents and clearly has something to say about
how we handled our involvement.  There are terrific
moments of truth and observation.  At the same time,
it shows how war is truly Hell.  The sunlight has been
bleached into an almost hallucinatory effect. 
Meanwhile gun battles are presented in slow motion to
make it shocking rather than some visceral display of
pyrotechnics.  And thanks to strong performances from
the cast, the film continually brims with enthusiasm,
energy and intelligence.  Korea had M*A*S*H, and
Vietnam had Platoon.  Now, the Gulf War has `Three
Kings.'</P>
