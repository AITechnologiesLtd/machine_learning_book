<P>     Frankly speaking, any $90M movie starring Brad Pitt and Harrison
Ford should be more exciting than this one.  Whatever the Hell the title
means, the plot is deceptively simple:  an Irish terrorist (Pitt) takes
refuge in New York City and moves into the basement of an unsuspecting
beat cop (Ford) and his family.  And then the latter finds out about the
former.  To the credit of director Alan J.  Pakula and however many
writers went without mention, this movie doesn't take the easy way out.
The hoary cliches are kept to a minimum, the violence is terse and to
the point, and each character is given a fair amount of breathing room.
So, what's the problem?  Well, it just ain't exciting enough.  THE
DEVIL'S OWN never reaches the emotional heights suggested by either the
story *or* the star power.  Sure, there's some suspense.  And an in-
triguing moral conflict.  And the slight pleasure of seeing Indiana
Jones as the father of three girls.  But when we get down to brass
tacks, and the characters have to confront each other, there's just not
enough punch to their punches.</P>
