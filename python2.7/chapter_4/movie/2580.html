                         EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES             
                        A Film Review by Jon A. Webb 
                         Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb </PRE>
<P>     I feel that I liked "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" more than it 
deserved. There is something about this film that is appealing, even 
though the writing is somewhat childish and the direction wooden.</P>
<P>     Uma Thurman plays Sissy, the woman with incredible thumbs, who is 
born to hitchhike,  She meets up with Bonanza Jellybean, played by Rain 
Phoenix (the latest of that strangely named, distinguished acting family) 
who leads the cowgirls on a Western dude ranch.</P>
<P>     I never read "Cowgirls," so I don't know how true this is to the 
book.  It seems to me that the story is a little dated now, when the shoe 
is on the other foot with regard to environmental issues, women's rights, 
and gay rights.</P>
<P>     But it is also clear that this story has meaning for a lot of 
people, quite a few of whom are in this film.  The cast list reads like 
something from Altman: Lorraine Bracco plays the whip-carrying peyote-
inspired cowgirl leader; John Hurt plays The Countess; Keanu Reeves the 
Native American object of Sissy's desire; Angie Dickinson runs the dude 
ranch; Sean Young and Crispin Glover are members of an Andy Warholesque 
party circle; and so on.  Its fun watching these actors stretch 
themselves in these odd roles.</P>
<P>     Gus van Sant has every actor speak his or her lines as if they were 
reading the script for the first time. This awkward effect is probably 
deliberate, as he also used it in "My Own Private Idaho." I don't know 
why he does this; perhaps it mutes the intensity of this strange material 
a little and keeps it from seeming ridiculous. It is probably what saves 
such outrageous scenes as the one where the cowgirls confront the 
Countess (which I found hilarious) and the one where Sissy does the 
commercial.</P>
<P>     I suppose it is the enthusiasm of the actors for the story, and the 
story itself, that made the film appealing to me. Lorraine Bracco, with 
her wild stare and whip seems to be truly enjoying herself, as does Sean 
Young with her teased hair. Buck Henry's turn as a crazed doctor seems 
heartfelt. Every one of these actors seems to genuinely want to be in 
this movie, disconnected and odd though it is.</P>
<P>     This is not a particularly insightful film, like "Drugstore Cowboy;" 
it does not even have very good direction. It is not a tribute to the 
book, so far as I can tell. It is a record of people who really want to 
work together with this material, and who are enjoying themselves doing 
it, while being held sightly in check by a talented artist who should be 
working with better material than this.</P>
