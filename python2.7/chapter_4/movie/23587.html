"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Dreamworks' latest foray into animation is the result of an interesting
idea.  Jeffrey Katzenberg and company decided to take the best aspect of
recently successful animated films – the wisecracking sidekick – and
build a film around this scene-stealing cut-up.  And just to drive the
hilarity home, the writers used two of these class clowns as the main
characters in The Road to El Dorado.  I can picture well-dressed
executives greedily rubbing their hands together while visualizing
coffers full of doubloons at the mere thought of a film with two hammy
leads.  Think of how great a movie would be with Eddie Murphy's Mushu
(from Mulan) and Danny DeVito's Philoctetes (from Hercules) as the two
main characters.</P>
<P>Okay, El Dorado isn't that great.  The two leads (Kevin Kline and
Kenneth Branagh) are funny, but not over-the-top enough to ruin the
film.  The slick animation is on par with Dreamworks' last traditionally
animated film, The Prince of Egypt, but the story is much more formulaic
than its predecessor.  And to top things off, the sidekick in El Dorado
still steals the show.</P>
<P>El Dorado begins in 1519 Spain, where soon-to-be-legendary explorer
Cortes (Jim Cummings, the voice of Tigger and Winnie the Pooh in The
Tigger Movie) is about to set sail for the New World, which he intends
to conquer for Spain.  In addition, Cortes plans to find and plunder El
Dorado, the legendary City of Gold.  He's a big meanie and points out
that his crew was selected more carefully `than Christ's apostles.'
Imagine that job interview.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, two lightweight hoodwinks - Miguel and Tulio (Kenneth Branagh
and Kevin Kline from Wild Wild West) - shoot craps with loaded dice in a
crowded Spanish alley.  Like Jack Dawson in Titanic, they win an unusual
pot that includes a map to the City of Gold.  Before long their
deception is discovered and, during their escape, the two men
accidentally end up on Cortes' ship.  Before they can escape, the ship
is already well into its voyage across the Atlantic.  With the help of
Altivo, Cortes' faithful horse, Miguel and Tulio manage to procure a
rowboat and steal away in the darkness of night.  With the horse.</P>
<P>After rowing around in circles for days, the trio finally reaches terra
firma.  Of course, the particular spot they land on is the precise
location that corresponds to the start point on the map to the City of
Gold.  So Miguel, Tulio and Altivo make their way through the jungle and
mountains and eventually find the city, which is run by the typical
friendly fat guy (Edward James Olmos, Selena) whose second-in-command is
the typical evil skinny guy that wants to be in charge (Armand Assante,
The Odyssey).</P>
<P>Thanks to an ancient legend and a healthy dose of dumb luck, the people
of El Dorado mistake Miguel and Tulio for gods.  The men want to stay
just long enough to pilfer all the gold they can carry from the trusting
inhabitants, and are able to fit in with the help of a local con woman
that looks like a porn star (Rosie Perez, It Could Happen To You).  Even
though they have to hit the road before Cortes and his men find the
city, Miguel and Tulio have a hard time leaving their new luxurious
lifestyle.</P>
<P>If El Dorado seems more Disney-ish to you than Egypt did, it's because
most of the filmmakers here were pilfered from the Mouse House.  The
film's three directors (Robert `Bibo' Bergeron, Will Finn and Don Paul)
worked on A Goofy Movie, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas,
respectively.  The music in El Dorado comes from the writing team
responsible for The Lion King, and features five new songs performed by
Sir Elton John.  There's also one of those Disney animating secrets that
animates - I swear to God - a bull with a nutsack the size of Rhode
Island.  If you don't see it, wait for the DVD.</P>
<P>The voice work is fine all around.  Kline and Branagh sound like they
had a great time working on this project, and Perez's voice isn't the
screeching nasal nightmare you're used to hearing.  She's much more
restrained and, as a result, her voice is quiet and – gulp – almost
soothing.</P>
<P>Now there's something I never thought I would say.</P>
<P>1:23 - PG for mild adult language and slapstick violence</P>
