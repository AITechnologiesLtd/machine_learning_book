<PRE>                                   QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Raymond Johnston
                        Copyright 1994 Raymond Johnston</PRE>
<PRE>Dir: Robert Redford
Starring: Ralph Fiennes, John Turturro, Rob Morrow, David Paymer,
          Paul Scofield.</PRE>
<P>     Robert Redford has proven that he is a better middle-aged director
than he is a middle-aged actor.  His recent roles in HAVANA, SNEAKERS,
and the truly dreadful INDECENT PROPOSAL can in no way stand beside his
stunning achievement in directing A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT and now QUIZ
SHOW.</P>
<P>     The ambiance of the late Eisenhower years is perfectly
recreated.  The cars, clothing, hair styles, magazine covers, and idiom
all come together to make a credible world, a world where naive people
believed that everything they saw on television was true.  It was
television that made everyone equal, and into this world come people
from diverse backgrounds.  All of them see the new medium as their
ticket to the top.  Television becomes something like a mirror that
reflects the character's moral make-up.</P>
<P>     When a film is based on questions of character, what a good
director needs most is character actors.  Quiz show is filled them.  John
Turturro (DO THE RIGHT THING) is mercilessly annoying in the role of
Queens, New York bookworm Herbert Stempel, a man whom one person
comments has a face for radio.  Few actors would have dared to create a
nudge with so few redeeming qualities.  Diametrically opposed to him is
Ralph Fiennes (SCHINDLER'S LIST) as Charles van Doren, the handsome
college professor and son of a prominent intellectual family.  He is as
flawless as Stempel is flawed.  Between the two of them there is variety
of fights: rich v. poor, Gentile v. Jew, handsome v. unhandsome,
suburbs v. city.</P>
<P>     While they are not top billed, the amoral center of the film is
the two game show producers, played by Hank Azaria and David Paymer.
They are two fast talkers who take basically honest people, and tell
them how the game show really works.  David Paymer as Dan Enright,
carries the heaviest load in the film.  If his depiction of the producer
who sees nothing more than ratings had been off the mark, the whole
film would have faltered badly.  But David Paymer is every media
executive.  If he doesn't win the Oscar for best supporting actor, it is
probably because the show is fixed.</P>
<P>     The only near miss is Rob Morrow, whose attempt at a Kennedy-esque
Boston accent manages to mostly be grating.  Also appearing in the film
is Martin Scorcese in a cameo.  One cannot help speculating that he gave
Redford a few tips on camera angles.</P>
<P>     The script by Paul Attanasio lets up on the moralizing enough for
a few good laughs.  Robert Redford keeps the longish film moving at a
good pace, leaving one story line for another just before it gets
boring.  QUIZ SHOW kicks off the serious fall Oscar race, and should
be a strong contender in most categories including minor ones like
costume and set design.</P>
<P>     This film would make a good double feature with Francis Coppola's
similarly themed TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM.  Both are about the
gap between idealism and reality in the post World War II era.</P>
