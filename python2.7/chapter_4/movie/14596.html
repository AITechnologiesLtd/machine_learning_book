<P>     In the last few minutes of PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, writer/director David
Veloz introduces a jarring element of irony to what had been a fairly
straightforward dark night of the soul drama.  It's the true story of
Jerry Stahl (Ben Stiller), a successful television writer during the 1980s
for such programs as "ALF" and "thirtysomething" who bottomed out as the
result of heroin and cocaine addiction.  The film's coda shows
Stiller-as-Stahl, having written his confessional autobiography, appearing
on a series of television talk shows to promote the book and bare his
soul.  In one of the film's best lines, Stahl explains in voice-over that
the most humiliating thing he ever did as the result of his addiction was
"appearing on 'Maury'."</P>
<P>     A good gag, but also a pretty self-serving one.  In an era when
celebrity mea culpas are just another part of the public relations
landscape, a film like PERMANENT MIDNIGHT has to work extra hard to
function as an honest cautionary tale rather than a plea to love me, feel
sorry for me, let me back into your hearts.  The film makes sure we know
about Stahl's troubled family life, including two suicidal parents, which
already suggests that Stahl and/or writer/director David Veloz is pointing
fingers outward as much as inward.  That five minute montage of chat show
appearances, however, acts almost as a slap in the face.  Watching the
character pitch his book -- which, of course, became the movie we're
watching -- takes every harrowing moment which preceded and makes it cheap
and exploitative.  Instead of learning from his experience, we learn that
a really good salesman can turn his tragedy into dollars.</P>
<P>     That's truly a shame, because Stahl's story is given a harrowing
conviction by Ben Stiller's performance.  Though best known as a comic in
films like the hit THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, Stiller is a versatile
performer who makes heroin addiction about as ugly as we've ever seen it.
It's funny yet pathetic watching Stahl trying with a ridiculous lack of
success to disguise his stupors as artistic eccentricity; even other
self-absorbed Hollywood types instantly recognize that he's utterly
useless.  What's fascinating about Stiller's performance is that there's
never a moment when his character appears to be functional as an addict.
He disappears instantly into a world of excuses and frantic searches for
his next high.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, there's nothing besides Stiller's performance to make
us care about PERMANENT MIDNIGHT.  The two romantic angles which are
supposed to give resonance to the story -- Stahl's marriage to a mid-level
television executive (Elizabeth Hurley) and his post-rehab infatuation
with fellow recovering addict Kitty (Maria Bello) -- are both undercut by
the circumstances of their relationships.  The marriage, though it
produces a child, is primarily a way for his British wife to get a green
card, and the romance with Kitty serves primarily as a device for Stahl to
tell his story in flashback.  There's not much at stake as we watch Stahl
disintegrate, nor is there a particular reason to care if he's earned his
second chance at love.  He's just another cleaned-up Hollywood junk-head
with a tale to tell, probably one of a thousand.  The last five minutes of
PERMANENT MIDNIGHT are as ill-conceived as any five minutes of film this
year, because they make it look like Stahl is just a different kind of
self-absorbed now.  You're left with the uncomfortable feeling that for
him, addiction is just a marketing hook.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 junk men:  5.</PRE>
