<P>At the very beginning of 1998's LES MISÉRABLES, the eighteenth remake of
the classic Victor Hugo novel, the convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
says to a kindly bishop (Peter Vaughan), "Thank you for the meal and a
bed to sleep in. In the morning I will be a new man." And indeed he is,
as this very ambitious, mostly pleasing, and surprisingly serious drama
tells the story of his life. Undoubtedly not as good as previous
versions, but a quality movie nonetheless, this remake is another gem
that will most likely be passed over in public opinion. </P>
<P>Valjean is our hero, and he is played by Neeson in outstanding fashion.
The benevolence displayed is very much akin to Oskar Schindler (in the
1993 classic SCHINDLER'S LIST), a role which won him an Academy Award
nomination. Opposing him is the persistent Inspector Javert, done by
Geoffrey Rush in a quite contemptable but perfectly compatible manner.
The few scenes when Javert and Valjean come within inches of each other
are tense and exciting because of the two actors' mastery of the roles.
Also of credibility and quality is Uma Thurman as Fantine, whose
baseline role accentuates the kind-heartedness of Valjean. Her daughter
Cosette (Claire Danes), on the other hand, plays exactly the opposite
and becomes the one character to unintentionally illicits negativity
from our hero. The cast is very solid and plays testiment to Hugo's
novel. </P>
<P>The movie follows Valjean from his first days as a parolee after
nineteen years of hard labor. Breaking parole, however, he escapes
policemen and turns up nine years later in the town of Vigo as the
mayor. His life, quite the opposite now, is perfect until the cunning
Inspector Javert is assigned as the chief inspector of the town. Javert
suspects the mayor to be the convict Valjean, but he cannot place
anything solid on the man and is forced to follow him from a distance.
It is then that Valjean makes a promise to Fantine, a woman who used to
work at his factory and is now dying of pneumonia, to bring her bastard
daughter back to Vigo so that the two may reunite before death.
Unfortunately, Javert tracks Valjean and forces him to take the daughter
to Paris, where the final hunt begins between Javert and Valjean. </P>
<P>In a time of the year when recent fare has been loaded down with
senselessness and unintelligence, a remarkable redone drama like LES
MISÉRABLES is a very watchable film. Its 140-minute running time makes
it quite long and windy, although every scene begins with a superb
narrative hook to make the picture mostly entertaining throughout. At
the midway point, when the film reaches its highest tempo, the viewers
are very into the movie, and unfortunately it takes a big cut in pacing
and starts over with another plot that doesn't conclude the original
until the very end. While the first half is the story of Valjean, the
second half is the story of Cosette and Javert, and the transition is
not very pleasing. Nevertheless, a very entertaining and watchable film,
recommendable on all counts.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "LES MISÉRABLES": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
