<P>We all know what a John Ford Western looks like, and what an Alfred
Hitchcock thriller looks like, and what a Frank Capra drama looks like.
And, amazingly enough, we all know what a Quentin Tarantino movie looks
like.  Amazing, I mean, becaus he's only directed three movies.  Not
that either Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction arise to the level of The
Searchers, North by Northwest, or Meet John Doe, by any means, but
Tarantino has a style as distinctive as John Wayne's red bandanna or
Jimmy Stewart's stammer.</P>
<P>But the key to Tarantino movies has always been the dialogue.  That's
why True Romance is a "Tarantino movie", even though Tony Scott directed
Tarantino's screenplay.  That's why Pulp Fiction will be studied in film
schools long after films like Buddy and The Jackal have evaporated like
the smoke from a Red Apple cigarette.  And that's why Jackie Brown is
just a little bit short of being the best movie of the year.  (Which
would be Titanic.)</P>
<P>QT is working with an Elmore Leonard novel as his source material, and
his screenplay has taken pains to remain true to Leonard's snappy
dialogue.  Although he's transplanted the setting from South Florida to
the familiar suburban outback of Los Angeles, QT has studiously kept his
trademark conversational vignettes out of the movie.  Also, the native
quirkiness of Tarantino characters is curiously absent -- partially
because Tarantino's not working with his regular cast  (Tim Roth, Steve
Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, QT himself).  And there's not a Big Kahuna
Burger or a four-way gun confrontation in sight.</P>
<P>And yet, these are minor quibbles, important to only die-hard Tarantino
fans. (And QT does add several signature touches -- one funny
split-screen moment, one Indiana-Jones-type map, and the turning-point
of the movie, told in three different segments from three different
perspectives.)</P>
<P>Jackie Brown is a fine movie, driven by plot and dialogue rather than
car chases and shootouts.  At its center, it's a duel between ghetto
arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson, in yet another
Oscar-worthy performance) and stewardess turned courier Jackie Brown
(Pam Grier, making a boffo return to the screen).  The winner will get
half a million dollars, the loser will die.</P>
<P>Ordell is a man who knows that it's good to be the king.  He rules his
large gun business and small harem like an empire, dealing ruthlessly
and efficiently with threats -- but he's a classy and smart king.
Jackson takes a character that could be instantly repellant and makes us
like and respect -- and fear -- him.  The only note that rings false
isn't Jackson's fault:  QT has grafted his musical taste onto Ordell's
character, and has him listening to the durndest music.</P>
<P>Where Ordell is powerful and commanding, Jackie Brown is dignified and
sharp.  Jackie is a 44-year-old stewardess on a cheesy airline, running
money for Ordell from Mexico.  An arrest by a federal marshal (Michael
Keaton, in a surprisingly colorless, Joe Friday role) forces Jackie to
try to walk a twisted tightrope to outwit both the feds and Ordell.</P>
<P>Grier is superb.  She makes Jackie Brown into a real person, rather than
just an older, wiser Foxy Brown.  We see Jackie in different moods:
quietly desparate in a small interrogation room, shouting down Ordell in
a tense confrontation in her apartment, tired yet dignified in getting
out of jail, alternately trying to overcome her nerves and then trying
to act nervous for the benefit of the cops, and in a wonderful scene,
rehearsing her fast-draw.</P>
<P>But the best reason to go see this movie is the one that no one
expected, the one that no one had ever even heard from in years:  Robert
Forster.   The veteran of such films as Maniac Cop 3: Badge of Silence,
Satan's Princess, The Kinky Coaches and the Pom Pom Pussycats, and Orgy
of the Nymphomaniacs somehow caught QT's eye, and got the part of bail
bondsman Max Cherry.  Forster isn't marquee-idol handsome, and his hair
plugs are painfully obvious, but he is...  Gary Cooper!  Yes!  When the
menacing Ordell explains that he doesn't have the money on him for a
bail bond, he replies calmly, in his flat, nasal voice:  "Is white guilt
supposed to make me forget that I run a business?"  Tough, smart, and
yet vulnerable to Jackie Brown's charms, Forster is a calm center of
gravity amidst the swirling plots and counterplots.  Maybe Forster
doesn't get an Oscar, but it's a crying shame that the Academy doesn't
give out a "Comeback Player of the Year" award.</P>
<P>However, the biggest disappointment in Jackie Brown is the performances
turned in by the veterans:  Michael Keaton and Robert DeNiro.  They're
both wasted in small, supporting roles -- Keaton as a hipster federal
marshal, DeNiro as a stoner ex-con.  DeNiro is primarily a sounding
board for Jackson, and for much of the movie, he sits around on the
couch with Bridget Fonda's surfer girl, smoking marijuana out of an
improbable statuette.  There's nothing wrong with any of their
performances, it's just that I would have like to have seen more use out
of this great cast.</P>
<P>But as good as the cast is, and a good as this movie is, the best thing
is this:  Jackie Brown makes me want to read more Elmore Leonard
novels.  That's a fine tribute to the skills of Jackson, Grier, and
Forster -- and especially to my main man, Quentin Tarantino.  In a
Hollywood obsessed with special effects, tiresome sequels, and unfunny
bathroom comedies, QT has once again proven that telling great stories
in a stylish and original way is magic.</P>
