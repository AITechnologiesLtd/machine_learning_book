<PRE>                           THE RAINMAKER</PRE>
<P>Based on the John Grisham novel of the same name, it is the story of
how one insurance company does not honor legitimate claims by its
policy holders.  With the exception of John Voight who is Drummond,
the insurance company's thousand-dollar-per-hour attorney, the rest
of the cast is either wasted or engages in some very mediocre
acting.</P>
<P>The film's hero, Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is supposed to be a young
hotshot lawyer trying to make it big.   As portrayed by Damon,
however, he falls very short in that role.   He never comes across
as being real, as being a real attorney who knows what he is doing.
He does not compare with John Voight as a brainy attorney.  The
film's title refers to someone who aspires to be a great attorney
and make tons of money for any company that is smart enough to hire
him; no such company has done that in Baylor's present.</P>
<P>Danny DeVito, as a "para lawyer" who has not passed the bar, hams it
up something fierce to the point where he comes across as
ridiculous. In more or less cameo roles, the following are wasted:
Mary Kay Place, Claire Danes, Mickey Rourke, Danny Glover, Virginia
Madsen, Roy Scheider, Teresa Wright, Dean Stockwell and others.   I
shudder when I think of all the fine films those actors have been
in; this was certainly not one of them.</P>
<P>     The screenplay and direction are by Francis Ford Coppala, and
that is hard to believe, too</P>
