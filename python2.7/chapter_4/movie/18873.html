<P>PLOT:
Philandering hotshot Southern lawyer takes on a simple case of a father
stalking/harassing his daughter (whom said lawyer is sleeping with), and
succeeds in getting the man put away. Unfortunately for all involved, the
nutty father escapes and begins to make the lives of his daughter, the
lawyer and his family a living nightmare. His band of religious hillbilly
followers help him along his twisted path.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Picking up steam like a snowball barreling down a mountainside, this film
starts off looking like your basic Southern Grisham "lawyer flick", but
slowly crafts itself into a tension-filled thriller, with interesting
characters, some relevant and unique stylings via the watchful eye of
veteran director Robert Altman, and many stormy scenes succinctly
paralleling the film's own brewing tension. Understand that this film is not
your everyday thriller, and does take some time to get going, but I
personally found the setting, the players, and Bobby Duvall's nutty
character interesting enough to keep me tuned into its two-hour stretch. I
will admit that I saw the film's "twist" coming up 5th Avenue from frame
one, but nonetheless, a couple of curve balls managed to keep me in the
game. Downey Jr. also plays a pretty neat supporting jokester, and Branagh
drops his British accent for a near-perfect Southern drawl. All in all, this
film's got great atmosphere, strong performances, interesting characters,
nice style, despite the predictable but enjoyable plot line. Check it out on
video, and bring an umbrella...you'll need it.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Word on the street is that director Robert Altman rewrote this film's
screenplay so much, that the only recognizable John Grisham story elements
left seem to be the loathsome Southern lawyer at the center of a crisis and
a sleazy detective following his beat. Grisham only ended up with a "Story
by" credit in this film, with the screenplay going to the pseudonym Al Hayes
(really Robert Altman).
Mary Jo Slater was the casting director of this film. She's actor Christian
Slater's mom. Stephen Altman was the production designer of this film. He's
director Robert Altman's son, and was also credited for the same on at least
six other films by dad.
Embeth Davidtz's real name is Gretta Milano (Don't ask me why she changed
it?? Very odd choice).</P>
