                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>Chad'z Rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1994, R, 99 minutes [1 hour, 39 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Irene Jacob (Valentine), Jean-Louis Trintisnant (The Judge),
Frederique Feder (Karin), Jean-Pierre Lorit (Auguste), written by Krysztof
Piesiewicz, Krzysztof Kielowski, produced by Marin Karmitz, directed by
Krysztof Kielowski.</P>
<P>If we could interfere with fate, we would (or should we) do it? Perhaps the
reason some people believe in fate is because of our sense of privacy. If
everyone knew each others' business the world would be a much different place
wouldn't it? "Red" tries to play up that theme through an encounter between
two strangers. </P>
<P>Irene Jacob stars as Valentine, a fashion model who is likable and very
sweet. We follow her around for a while, and at first the film seems a bit
confusing as it's hard to tell where it's going. At the same time we also met
a young, successful businessman named Auguste (Lorit). He doesn't have much,
if anything, to do with Valentine, only that he lives near her. However, his
entire character is a great technique in storytelling and filmmaking.</P>
<P>One day Valentine accidentally hits a dog with her car and when she returns
it to its owner, a retired judge (Trintisnant), he seems totally apathetic.
We can't help but be put off by his attitude, but at the same time he makes
for an interesting character because of his bitterness. After several
encounters Valentine realizes the judge listens in on his neighbors'
telephone conversations for amusement. He doesn't seem so much perverted as
he is curious. </P>
<P>Throughout the film the storytelling is breezy as it just tries to define
the mood of their rather odd relationship. They discuss his habit of
eavesdropping: Valentine claims it's a breach of privacy, but the judge
doesn't seem to care anymore. One conversation involves a man's secret affair
with his gay lover, and Valentine decides to tell him about the judge. When
she arrives at his house she meets the man's wife and child and knows if she
were to tell them what is happening it would ruin their lives. This idea of
interrupting with fate is the central theme of the film. The judge knows some
day the wife will catch her husband and the family will be shattered, had
Valentine told them she would have only sped up their misery.</P>
<P>There isn't much else to "Red." It's charming but not sappy. It could be
enjoyed by almost anyone, but I would recommend it for mature audiences.
Maybe Kielowski isn't trying to make a statement about love or fate, but just
present them as he sees them. It's nice to know these kinds of things are
relevant all over the world. </P>
<P>[Note: The film is rated R for a sex scene that last about four or five
seconds. Besides that, there is no other sex, profanity, nor violence and the
film should be suitable for ages 14 and up.]</P>
