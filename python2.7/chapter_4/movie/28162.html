<PRE>ENLIGHTENMENT GUARANTEED
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Sometimes movies transcend their descriptions.  Who would want to see a 
German film about a couple of brothers heading for Japan to visit a Zen 
monastery?  Surely there can't be much of interest in that, you might 
think as I certainly did.  </P>
<P>Well, there's a lot, as it turns out.  Writer/director Doris Dörrie's 
ENLIGHTENMENT GUARANTEED (ERLEUCHTUNG GARANTIERT) is a sweet, funny and 
absolutely delightful film about brotherly love, the meaning of life and 
the importance of a sense of humor in the face of adversity.  Think of 
it as a low-key version of PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES in which the 
humorous and touching journey is the reward.  The story has a pervasive 
but subtle spirituality to it as the destination for these brothers 
turns out to be more than just a place on a map.  (Actually, the lack of 
a good map is but one of many of their problems.)</P>
<P>Two gifted, charming actors, Uwe Ochsenknecht and Gustav-Peter Wöhler 
play brothers Uwe and Gustav in warm and sympathetic performances.  Uwe 
designs kitchens, and Gustav, practicing the art of Feng Shui, teaches 
people how to orient their houses and their furniture so as achieve 
maximum harmony with the spiritual forces.  Both of the guys are anal 
retentives.  Uwe keeps a tape measure to make spur of the moment 
measurements and a camcorder to record his every thought.  Gustav uses 
his trusty compass to check the Feng Shui arrangements of rooms he 
visits and keeps his Buddhist book of wisdom always at his side in order 
to provide for instant motivational lessons, such as "The melon knows 
not the cold wind of morning."</P>
<P>Gustav, who has been planning his big visit to the monastery, is joined 
at the last minute by his non-believing brother when Uwe's wife leaves 
him, taking the kids.  The ever jovial Gustav is non-plused by his 
whining brother.  They haven't been together much since they were kids, 
so both look forward, albeit with some amount of trepidation, to their 
time abroad on their big adventure.</P>
<P>Once in Tokyo, the movie pulls back to let us witness the hubbub of city 
life and the sea of people going about their fast-paced daily lives.  
Through a hilarious series of misadventures from voracious ATMs to a 
taxi driver who has trouble understanding their English with German 
accents and confuses the word "hotel" with "hospital," they end up lost 
and destitute, living briefly on the street.  The script does quite a 
credible job of making this both plausible and humorous.  You'll be 
rooting for them as they get into more and more difficulties.  And 
you'll be touched by their reactions to their trials and tribulations.</P>
<P>Along the way, the two brothers mock each other with gentle jabs.  Uwe 
particularly likes to ridicule Gustav with Zen quotes like, "Have 
patience with every day of your life."  But they also nurture each 
other.  "Never give up, you wimp," they tell one another.  This long 
middle section of the movie is the best part, but the two leads are so 
strong that the entire film is mesmerizing.</P>
<P>When, in the last act, these foreigners in a foreign land finally arrive 
at the monastery, they find a highly ritualized life.  The monastery's 
rubrics are at first awkward and strange for Uwe.  But it is the hard 
manual labor of cleaning already clean floors in order to clean one's 
heart that proves the most troublesome for the rotund Gustav.  </P>
<P>When we first met the brothers, their respective wives were cleaning up 
spills on the floor with no offer of help from the husbands.  Once at 
the monastery, these opening scenes prove both prophetic and ironic as 
they spend much of their day cleaning.  This gentle, good-spirited 
comedy does much more than make you laugh.  It makes you think as well 
about what really is important in life.  And it makes you realize that 
life's journeys are fraught with difficulties and opportunities.  You'll 
leave the theater with a smile on your face and perhaps a bit more 
optimistic view of life.</P>
<P>ENLIGHTENMENT GUARANTEED runs 1:49.  The film is in German with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but might be an R for brief nudity and 
language.  It would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
