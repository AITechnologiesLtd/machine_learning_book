<PRE>               AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY
                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Jay Roach
Writer: Mike Myers
Starring: Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Mimi Rogers, 
Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Charles Napier, Will Ferell, Tom Arnold, 
Carrie Fisher and...Burt Bacharach</P>
<P>When SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE was...you know, good, it starred a guy named 
Mike Myers who, along with such greats as Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman, 
made me bust a gut every Sunday morning (since I was always too tired at 
11:30 on Saturday so I would tape them and watch them before church...I 
was young).  Mike was my fave, though I always said Dana was because I 
was quite the little trendy lad back in the day.  But whenever Mike 
would do an Englishman (especially Mick Jagger), that was when the show 
was the absolute funniest, since his part was so well-rehearsed, so 
authentic and so educated.  </P>
<P>Of course, he was doing material written by someone else, but now, with 
his second big film on his own (the other being the 
nice-idea-but-not-too-good SO I MARRIED AND AXE MURDERER), he's the sole 
writer and main attraction (unless you consider Burt Bacharach a big 
financial attraction...).  With AUSTIN POWERS, he has created an 
original, non-SNL character: a mix between any 60s spy guy...complete 
with bad teeth, an awful wig, firghtening chest hair, big dork glasses, 
a male necklace and...a sweedish-made penis enlarger ("It's not my bag, 
baby!")</P>
<P>Myers not only does a kind of Fish-Out-Of-Water thing here (thank GOD he 
didn't play it up too much!), his full-length parody is one of the most 
intelligent comedies to come around since the days of early Mel Brooks. 
 The plot (somewhat irrelevant, but still good for good laughs for those 
of us who've seen too many Bond films): Austin has frozen himself for 30 
years since his nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers), has done the same thing 
to make sure taking over the world would not coincide with the 
sexual/hippie revolution.  He's thawed out and, along with his very 
attractive Emma Peel-esque agent, Vanessa Kensington (the wonderful 
Elizabeth Hurley), he tries to stop Dr. Evil from launching a nuclear 
bomb into the earth's core.  </P>
<P>Austin is a wonderful creation: a swinging ladies man who's a 
photographer by day, and a spy whenever his boss, Mr. Exposition (the I 
think thawed out as well, Michael York) calls him up.  He gets a major 
culture shock when he's thawed out ("As long as people are having 
premiscuous sex with multiple partners while at the same time 
experimenting with mind-expanding drugs, I'll be fine!" - don't quote 
me, I only saw it twice) but Myers choses not to dwell on it too much.  
His explorations with the culture shock on Dr. Evil are much better, 
since his initial plan is to make a false contreversy in the Royal 
Family about Charles having an affair forcing him to divorce and a plan 
to put a whole with "what we call 'a laser' into what we call 'the ozone 
layer' for...ONE MILLION DOLLARS!"  Hilarity ensues.</P>
<P>The film also has a plethora of 60s references, including: any Bond 
film, 60s Connery preferably; MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.; BLOW UP, THE 
AVENGERS, GET SMART, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and even a line from BEYOND THE 
VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (written by Roger Ebert - the line being, "This is 
my happening and it freaks me out!" - a great line I will use in 
everyday life henceforth).  Dr. Evil looks exactly like Donald 
Pleasance's Blofeld, equipped with his cat - Mr. Bigglesworth - who 
suffers a hilarious mishap in the beginning.  And to top that off, his 
henchmen consist of a woman who looks almost exactly like Lotta Lenya in 
FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and a man named Random Task who is a dead ringer 
for Odd Job.  </P>
<P>Another plot dealing with Dr. Evil's son, Scott (Seth Green), who was 
made from his sperm which was frozen before he left, is not essential to 
the plot but gives it a cornicopia of jokes, especially where it winds 
the two in therapy since he hates him for not being there his entire 
life.</P>
<P>Also, look for multiple cameos by the likes of Tom Arnold, Carrie Fisher 
and even...(you knew it, it's anticlimactic) Burt Bacharach himself, 
singing his tunes.  I hear Christian Slater and Rob Lowe were in it too, 
but I have no clue who they were.  Guess I should see it again.</P>
<P>AUSTIN POWERS is a great film, good for multiple viewings and especially 
fun if you know what it's spoofing.  Comedy is hard but Mike Myers is 
now a Titan of modern comedy, thanks to the greatness of this film.  
Rush out to see it and stay groovy, baby!</P>
