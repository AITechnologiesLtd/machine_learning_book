                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1997 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The characters from "A Fish Called Wanda" are back for another go at it.
They've changed their names and jobs, but with John Cleese, Kevin Kline,
Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Palin returning, the comparison is
inevitable, although it is not actually a sequel.</P>
<P>Rupert Murdock clone Rod McCain (Kline) adds a British Zoo to his empire
and sets about turning it into a money-maker by requiring that it only
feature dangerous animals. With the Rambo mode in mind, he decides that
the public is in love with violence and orders the zoo to do away with
the cuter furry guys.</P>
<P>Rollo Lee (Cleese) is the zookeeper in charge of carrying out the orders
which result in an execution order for the less desirable critters. This
brings about the film's most humorous scenes as the animal handlers try
to convince him that their charges are indeed man-killers. With fake
blood and scrapes, they capture an escaped deadly anteater, "Watch out
for his tongue!"  The harmless mammals are disguised as bloodthirsty:
the cuddly meercat is portrayed as the piranha of the desert that can
strip a corpse in three minutes.</P>
<P>McCain sends his son Vince (Kline again) and newly hired Willa Weston
(Curtis) to England to make sure that his orders are carried out and the
operation shows a 20% profit. Weston is on the high speed career track
and wants to impress her new boss until she is charmed by the furry
ones. Vince is only interested in getting Weston and her well-displayed
ample cleavage into the sack.</P>
<P>Once there, McCain The Younger sets about turning the zoo into marketing
hell. Commercial sponsor banners are everywhere and the tortoise
compound becomes "Bruce Springstein Presents" The keepers' uniforms are
plastered with corporate patches like those of stock car drivers.</P>
<P>Like "Wanda", part of the success of this movie depends on juxtaposing
British and American sensibilities. And like its predecessor, there are
some hilarious scenes. The difference between the two films is that this
one doesn't work quite so well. The slapstick is occasionally clumsy and
mis-timed. There is little that goes over the top.</P>
<P>British humor sensibilities are different than what the people on this
continent are used to. Some of it is so dry that we might miss it unless
paying close attention. Other aspects are so goofy that they have to be
top notch in order not to just look moronic.</P>
<P>When the film was originally shown to test audiences last year, the
viewers hated the ending so much that a new director was called in to a
re-shoot.</P>
<P>The film does do well with a number of scenes. The sex farces (Cleese is
often mistaken as a sexual acrobat as he talks to animals in his bedroom
and is thought to be orgying with hot babes and is discovered innocently
half-dressed in a hotel room with two women) are comical, although they
could have been more outrageous. The vision of the keepers dressed in
outrageous animal costumes running around like chickens with their heads
off is hilarious.</P>
<P>The movie is entertaining, but it misses a bit too often. Gentlemen I
knew "A Fish Called Wanda", and this, sirs, is no "Wanda".</P>
