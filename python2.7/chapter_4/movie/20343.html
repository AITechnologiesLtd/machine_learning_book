<PRE>The Dinner Game
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) THE DINNER GAME is a lightweight French comedy from
Francis Veber, who is best known for writing LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, remade
in the U.S. as THE BIRDCAGE. THE DINNER GAME starts with a good recipe,
follows it closely, and serves it up in an appropriate (if cheap) dish.
The only thing wrong is that it's all dessert.</P>
<P>Mr. Brouchant belongs to a club of successful former frat boys. The club
meets each Wednesday, and each member must bring one idiot. Whoever's
idiot is the most long-winded and boring, wins. The movie introduces a
few examples of prize dates: a bank teller with an opinion on
everything, a boomerang collector, and a man who makes elaborate models
out of matchsticks. </P>
<P>Brouchant's pick of the week is Mr. Pignon, the matchstick modeler. He
invites Pignon over to his house for drinks before dinner, but that
afternoon, he throws out his back playing golf. His doctor says he has
to stay home and rest.</P>
<P>Pignon shows up for drinks anyway, and Brouchant marvels at what a
perfect idiot he is. Not only does he go on and on about his matchstick
models, but he gets confused over the simplest conversational turns. He
is a grade-A, prize idiot.</P>
<P>The plot takes off from here at a steady pace that keeps increasing as
the movie races toward the end. First Brouchant's wife calls to dump
him, and Pignon wants to be a shoulder to cry on. Then Brouchant's
girlfriend calls and invites herself over, and Pignon volunteers to try
to keep her away. All the while, Pignon's "help" invariably makes things
worse. Brouchant keeps saying "au revoir" but Pignon always finds one
more reason to stay.</P>
<P>Eventually, what should have been a relaxing evening at home for the
ailing Brouchant, becomes a chaotic scene with Pignon, an old friend,
his wife, his wife's boyfriend, his girlfriend, and a tax auditor who
works with Pignon.</P>
<P>A complex comedic plot like this needs to have an ending that is not
contrived, and Veber comes up with something that caps it all off,
without coming across as DEUS EX MACHINA. It is the best possible ending
for this film.</P>
<P>The direction, also by Veber, is competent. The greatest directorial
challenge in a movie like this is to keep the plot moving ahead,
constantly accelerating. The pace can't slow down for a second, and
Veber handles this task very well. He also coaxes some good performances
out of his actors. I'm not familiar with any of the cast, but nobody was
wooden or amateurish. Each character was solid, "believable," and true
to the world of the script.</P>
<P>The most serious flaw of THE DINNER GAME is its feather weight. The
whole thing is insubstantial and meaningless. The sets and lighting are
stagey, like a play or a studio sitcom. The comedic extremes to which
the plot goes are so silly that they can't be taken seriously. As funny
and well written as it is, it's still a throwaway movie.</P>
<P>I found sitting through THE DINNER GAME to be enjoyable and amusing, but
I really got nothing out of it, which ultimately makes me like it less.</P>
<P>You could say THE DINNER GAME is all dessert and no main course.</P>
