<P>Hideous Kinky gave me the same kind of feeling I always get when it
seems the setting is more important than the characters:  emptiness. 
That's not to say the film is lifeless; on the contrary, Kate Winslet
gives a fantastic performance as Julia, an English mother trying to
raise her two daughters (Bella Riza, Carrie Mullan) in Morocco.  The
central story is a good one, but the plot feels needlessly thickened by
various intrusive elements, including Julia's not-so-moving love affair
with a Moroccan man (Said Taghmaoui) and Julia's underdeveloped
commitment to the local religion.  Winslet, as I said, is a truly
affecting actress, and I was also very impressed with young Carrie
Mullan.  Director Gillies MacKinnon does a nice job with atmosphere, and
the film always feels authentic.  But I got the strange sensation that
the setting and the characters are part of two entirely different
stories, and the movie just isn't very engaging because of this.</P>
