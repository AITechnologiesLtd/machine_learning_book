<P>As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't shut up often.  But, when the
lights go down, my mouth clamps shut... Unless its a complete Z-grade movie
like Bats.</P>
<P>Bats is one of those movies where you have to get popcorn just to throw it at
the screen.  It is one of those movies where you have to make fun of those
little kids scared out of their wits three rows behind you on the other side
of the theatre.  Most of all, however, it is one of those movies where you
have to provide a running commentary.</P>
<P>My theory on this is that, as the mind sees such a bad product, it begins to
make some sense of it by turning it into a comedy.  After all, any movie where
I can emerge from the theatre saying "once again, man has made the world safe
from small mammals" might just provide Post Traumatic Stress Disorder without
a bit of sardonic humor implanted into it.</P>
<P>The plot of Bats is so very old that I had to wonder if the movie was
vaulted.  Vaulted is the industry term for a movie that was deemed unfit for
release when it was made but is getting released now because a star or
director of it had recent popularity.</P>
<P>Bats centers around two virus-infected carnivorous bats that were genetically
altered by a mad scientist and are now infecting a good portion of the bat
population around Gallup, Texas.  Every night, they come out of their cave and
attempt to eat everything in sight.  Of course, even though they're supposed
to be omnivorous, they skip right by the all-you-can-eat-buffet of grass and
go straight for the Grade-A meat known as a fat Texan hick.</P>
<P>To stop these bats, Shelia Casper (Dina Meyer) and her assistant Jimmy
(rapper Leon) team up with straw-chewing sheriff Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond
Phillips).  What follows is an hour and a half of your best one-liners,
insulting a movie that begs for it.</P>
<P>For a vague approximation of how bad the movie actually is, think back to all
of those schlock horror films of the 1980s.  You know the ones I'm talking
about... the films that made people stop making horror films (and then Kevin
Williamson came along with Scream).</P>
<P>Better yet, think to any episode you might have watched of Mystery Science
Theatre 3000, the show where three individuals are forced to watch the worst
movies in history and end up cracking jokes on them.  When you think in this
frame of mind, it's easy to figure out what it will be like watching the film.
 You will find that you have inside of you more great one-line insults then
you ever imagined!  Your creativity will be honed!</P>
<P>For this reason, I say that Bats is a fine film to see with a group of
friends.  Go ahead and watch it, but don't expect thrills.  Don't expect
chills.  Expect laughs... at what comes out of your best friend's mouth.</P>
