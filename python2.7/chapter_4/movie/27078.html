<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A quintessential noir film, more entertaining and atmospheric than
essential viewing, featuring a hard-boiled story, average though it may
be, which goes beyond the main character getting killed in the first
reel to spend the rest of the film examining why he lost interest in
living anymore. All the cliché noir characters pop up here, including
the femme fatale, the innocent man who is corrupted, and the calculating
big boss and the cold-blooded hit men. There is also the recognizable
cinematography of this genre, which is darkly shot, using shadows to
frame its shots, long close-ups to show fear and to overall create a
mood for what has become known in film lore as the noir world.</P>
<P>"The Killers" use Ernest Hemingway's short story as a starting point for
its own story, as it picks up after the execution of an ex-boxer called
Swede (Lancaster-in his film debut). The wonderfully engaging scene sets
the stage for the dark story that unfolds, as the hit men, Al (McGraw)
and Max (Conrad) drive into a small New Jersey town and enter a diner
during the supper hour. They are not too subtle about what they are
after, as they intimidate the diner manager, the cook, and a customer
(Brown), asking about Swede (he's using an alias), even telling them
that they plan to shoot him.</P>
<P>When, by coincidence, it turns out that the diner patron works in the
same filling station as the Swede and knows the rooming house where he
lives, he rushes to warn him of the danger. But Swede tells him there is
nothing to do. He then asks, "Why do they want to kill you?" and Swede,
while lying in bed in a darkened room replies, "I did something wrong...
once." The actual killing is anti-climactic, as the killers enter his
room blasting away without saying a word.</P>
<P>Riordan (O'Brien) is an insurance investigator who finds this routine
case curious because he doesn't understand why Swede did nothing in his
defense and becomes obsessed with the case, very much in the cliché of
how a 1940s noir protagonist would react. And, even though his company
has to pay off only a small amount on the life insurance policy, he
decides to fully investigate it.</P>
<P>He figures out from Swede's bruised knuckles that he was an ex-fighter
and finds out that he came from Philly. But first he goes to Atlantic
City and meets the chambermaid Queenie in a hotel Swede stayed in. She
is the sole beneficiary of the insurance, and tells Riordan she only met
him once, when he stayed at the hotel and she stopped him from
committing suicide, which he said was because a girl he was staying with
ran out on him.</P>
<P>In Philly, Riordan meets with Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky (Levene) and we
see through flashbacks the biography of Swede, as Sam is not only the
cop who pinched him, so that Swede had to serve 3-years for a robbery,
but grew up with him and was always friendly with the fighter who fought
his last fight because he broke his right hand, he even married the girl
(Virginia) that Swede left. After Swede quit fighting, he got involved
with the wrong crowd and fell in love with the film's femme fatale,
Kitty Collins (Ava), even though he knew she was the girl of a gangster
called Big Jim Colfax (Dekker).</P>
<P>The film trails Swede's downfall and traces it to Kitty, who
double-crosses him after a  big-time heist Swede gets involved with, in
a gang put together by Colfax. It is through Riordan's insistence to get
to the bottom of the mystery, that we learn how the air went out of
Swede, and why he didn't care what happened to him anymore.</P>
<P>For Riordan, he gets to see justice done, but the tragedy that happened
to Swede is a personal matter and not society's fault -- of him
foolishly putting his trust in a beautiful woman who was rotten to the
core. The film is more or less a pessimistic reaction to the post-war
period and of the greed and lust that blinded those who typify the kind
of characters who dwell in the noir world, a place where corruption is
the norm. It should also be noted that Miklos Rozsa's musical score was
later used by Dragnet.</P>
