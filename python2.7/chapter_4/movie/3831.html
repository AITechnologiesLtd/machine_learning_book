<P>     It's difficult to view BELLE DU JOUR in 1995 and get a balanced 
historical perspective on the film, which was originally released 
twenty-eight years ago.  Recently, there have been a slew of productions 
probing issues of identity and double lives.  Indeed, this has become a 
favorite province of independent film makers, probably because it's such 
a rich field.  However, back in 1967, the path was less frequently 
trodden, and Luis Bunuel's serious-yet-satirical picture helped pave the 
way for many stories yet to come. </P>
<P>     Today, BELLE DU JOUR is as effective as ever.  With a ravishing 
Catherine Deneuve in the title role, this film is a study of contrasts.  
The main character is at once glacial yet erotic -- a wife by night and 
prostitute by day.  She is two different people in one body, but Bunuel 
underlines the truth that no person can effectively compartmentalize 
facets of their life.  Crossovers are inevitable, and the harder we try 
to repress one segment of who we are, the more likely it is to assert 
itself -- forcefully. </P>
<P>     Bunuel also pokes fun at the morals of society by depicting what 
goes on behind closed doors at the brothel where Deneuve's Severine 
spends her afternoons.  An internationally-known gynecologist begs to be 
punished.  A businessman frolics with three girls at one time.  Then 
there are Severine's erotic fantasies, which easily become entangled 
with her surreal secondary life.  In fact, her misguided relationship 
with a gangster (Pierre Clementi) arises out of a hidden desire to flirt 
with danger.   </P>
<P>     All along, Severine's husband Pierre (Jean Sorel) is blissfully 
ignorant of his wife's daytime job.  He loves her, but wishes she would 
be more sexually attentive.  Meanwhile, a friend (Michel Piccoli) 
pursues Severine tirelessly -- until he learns her secret.  At that 
point, the chase loses its allure.  After all, where's the fun if the 
"forbidden fruit" isn't quite so forbidden? </P>
<P>     Much of the film works because of the capable acting of Deneuve.  
The scenes where she first approaches the brothel, tentative and 
uncertain yet undeniably intrigued, are perfectly realized.  Deneuve's 
performance allows the viewer to feel -- not merely sense -- the strange 
mixture of seduction and repulsion that prostitution holds for a woman 
in her position.  And, as Severine's sexual liberation takes place, 
Deneuve's beauty is transformed from cool and aloof to coy and playful.   </P>
<P>     Because producers Raymond and Robert Hakim were unwilling to re-
release this film in theaters or on video, BELLE DU JOUR has not been 
seen for over a quarter of a century.  Now, with the rights acquired 
from the Hakims' estate, Miramax has chosen to use this classic to 
launch their new subsidiary distributor of French fare, Miramax Zoe.  
Recognizing how greatly admired the film is (directors from Alfred 
Hitchcock to Martin Scorsese have sung Bunuel's praise), Miramax has 
therefore given a new generation this opportunity to see a memorable 
feature from decades past. </P>
