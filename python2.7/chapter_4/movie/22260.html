<P>_Man_on_the_Moon_ (R) ** (out of ****)</P>
<P>_Man_on_the_Moon_ is one of those films where you walk out of the
auditorium completely flummoxed as to why you feel so empty.  All the
pieces are in place in Milos Forman's biography of the late comedian Andy
Kaufman; it's a polished, well-cast, well-performed, and technically
well-made piece of work.  Upon deeper reflection, however, the initially
mysterious reason is actually quite simple: while those pieces fit
together, the resulting picture is wrong, for _Man_on_the_Moon_ is less
about Kaufman than it is his portrayer, Jim Carrey.</P>
<P>That statement would appear to be a half-step away from a quote one
would find blaring from a newspaper ad or TV commercial:
"_Man_on_the_Moon_ is all about Jim Carrey!"  But when I say that Carrey
dominates the picture, it is not necessarily in a good way.  Yes, he does
a bang-up impersonation of Kaufman's many different personae, from his
career-making role as Latka on the late' '70s-early '80s sitcom _Taxi_ to
his most curious creation, sleazy and boorish lounge singer Tony Clifton
(whom Kaufman insisted was a completely separate person).  The problem is
that director Forman and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry
Karaszewski, who memorably humanized _Hustler_ publisher Larry Flynt in
_The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt_, do little to make the film appear to be
more than a showcase for Carrey's gift for reverent mimickry.</P>
<P>After a memorably absurd opening that perfectly captures the essence of
Kaufman's distinctly eccentric brand of humor, the creative team quickly
falls into the trap that becomes the film's ruin.  Once Forman stages his
first recreation of bits from Kaufman's standup act, the film sets into
cruise control, offering reenactment after reenactment of keystone events
and performances in Kaufman's career (including his infamous "feud" with
wrestler Jerry Lawler), with few moments of downtime in between and even
less dramatic momentum to string it all together.  There's no denying
that much attention was paid to make sure every note was played exactly
as Kaufman did years ago.  It's just that Forman and crew add nothing
fresh of their own, and the film becomes little more than a series of
rambling, indulgent performance pieces for Carrey.  This becomes all the
more redundant considering that Carrey proves he can capably do Kaufman
schtick within the film's first two minutes; and in seeing him repeatedly
hit the same beats and assume the same postures, one becomes more acutely
aware of the impersonation, of an actor acting.  Perhaps it would be
better said that _Man_on_the_Moon_ is not about Jim Carrey, but Jim
Carrey's _Oscar_bid_.</P>
<P>To Carrey's credit, during the quieter moments, he projects a sense of
vulnerability and humanity.  But not much is done to flesh out Kaufman's
life beyond the spotlight.  While his friendships with creative
collaborator Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti) and manager George Shapiro (Danny
DeVito) are fairly well-established, more problematic is his relationship
with girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).  The two meet on
_The_Merv_Griffin_Show_, where she angrily volunteers to fight Kaufman in
a wrestling match during his infamous anti-woman phase.  Backstage after
the show, he manages to charm her; and in their next scene together, he's
already proposing marriage.  After one more scene involving a wrestling
ring, their relationship is shoved into the background--as is Love, a
vibrant actress who radiates a beguiling warmth here, but it's
squandered.  Similarly, DeVito and Giamatti also impress, but their
efforts clearly lie on the second string as far as the filmmakers are
concerned.</P>
<P>The quieter moments also offer little in the way of insight into who
Kaufman was and why he was that way.  The points covered are easy,
surface ones: he marched to his own drummer; he took pleasure in
subverting audiences' expectations and wishes and in generally pissing
them off; he immersed himself so deeply into his characters that those
closest to him often did not know where the act ended and the real Andy
began--that is, if it ever did.  The last point highlights the difficulty
in making a biography about the notoriously enigmatic Kaufman; did
anyone, let alone those involved in the making of this film, ever get a
handle on who the real Andy was?   Late in the film, when Lynne tells him
with a smile, "There is no real you," one cannot help but agree--at least
as far as this shallow screen treatment goes.  (opens December 22)</P>
