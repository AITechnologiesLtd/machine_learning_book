YEAR OF THE DRAGON
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Some people would hardly believe it, but in the early 1980s
Oliver Stone was regarded as anything but left-wing. His
scripts were often being accused of promoting ethnic
stereotypes, sexism, and in the case of CONAN THE BARBARIAN,
even the most questionable right-wing agenda. One of such
examples is YEAR OF THE DRAGON, now almost forgotten 1985
gangster epic by Michael Cimino, the very first film that
misfortunate director made after his HEAVEN'S GATE fiasco.
That movie is now almost forgotten, but in its time it made
a serious brouhaha with its alleged racism towards Chinese
American community. Naturally, it was Oliver Stone with his
screenplay who was named the biggest culprit. On the other
hand, very few people then actually bothered to judge this
film on its cinematic merit, instead of cheap daytime
politics. As soon as THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON went out of the
release, it was forgotten, despite being one of the more
ambitious and interesting films of the previous decade.</P>
<P>The movie begins in New York, whose quiet and picturesque
Chinatown gets shocked by the assassination of its top Triad
boss. Following his death, the citizens of Chinatown and
neighbouring quarters become targets of a whole series of
violent incidents. On the surface, it looks like a
escalation of youth gang activity; however, all those
attacks are actually part of campaign, cleverly orchestrated
by Joey Tai (John Lone), young Triad boss who wants to
remove the old guard and become the undisputed leader
himself. Unfortunately for Joey, he is not the only
ambitious man who wants to break the well-established rules
of his community. Captain Stanley White (Mickey Rourke),
most decorated policeman in New York, is put in charge of
Chinatown. His Vietnam traumas and hatred towards Asian
people drives him to start relentless anti-crime crusade
with total disregard towards the law and unofficial pact
between the police and local community leaders. That brings
him in an unavoidable conflict with Joey, which would result
in even more bloodbath.</P>
<P>Critics who accuse Cimino and Stone of anti-Asian racism are
missing the point, because the way Chinese community is
portrayed in YEAR OF THE DRAGON isn't much different from
the way some other ethnic or racial communities of America
used to be portrayed in crime thrillers. For example, these
days hardly any Italian American would be offended by the
way Mafia is dealt by Hollywood. Cimino's sin was probably
in the fact that he was one of the first directors who used
to dig behind the surface and expose the problem. Even more,
YEAR OF THE DRAGON didn't just try to show all the sinister
reality of crime-ridden Chinese community and its share of
the evil that lurks on American street. It actually tried to
explain that the Chinese themselves are the greatest victims
of their crime lords, and even went further. The root of the
problem, according to the characters in the movie, doesn't
lie within the community itself; the self-isolation which
gave the crime organisations so much power is the direct
result of the racism. When the Asian people get shunned and
humiliated and denied their fair share of American dream,
they have no other choices but to turn to themselves and the
old ways, however bad it could be. So, YEAR OF THE DRAGON is
basically the anti-racist film.</P>
<P>The anti-racist message was, however, blurred by the heavy
use of some police film clich‚s. Like in the 1970s, the hero
and chief villain are presented like a total visual
opposites of their character alignment. The "good" cop is
presented like a racist, wife- cheating redneck pig, who is
ready to sacrifice not just himself, but also his friends,
family and colleagues in his personal, and very questionable
war; Mickey Rourke in one of the strongest performances of
his career even gives him some traces of psychosis. The main
villain, played by John Lone, on the other hand is handsome,
cultivated, charismatic man, who actually cares both for his
family and is shown as person capable of compassionate
deeds; Stone's script even goes even further and gives Joey
Tai opportunity to present himself as a leader whose
business-like philosophy might even signal the break with
the old tradition and bring his people from the isolation.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, if the movie concentrated on those two
characters only, YEAR OF THE DRAGON would be remembered as
thought-provoking epic worthy of GODFATHER. But it wasn't
meant to be - in order to make Stanley White definitely
likeable, out of blue comes the character of Tracy Tzu,
Chinese American TV reporter whose father somehow managed to
earn fortune in honest way and integrate her daughter into
American way of life. For some undetermined reason, Stanley
White gets attracted to her and begins questioning his own
racist beliefs. Although that would make his character more
sympathetic, his metamorphosys doesn't get properly
explained, most probably due to the incredibly inept (and
"Razzie" awarded) performance of Arianne as his love
interest. Things get even more complicated, when the
character of Stanley's long suffering wife Connie (Caroline
Kava, one of the most underused actresses in today's
Hollywood) gets overexposure, together with unnecessary and
too direct allusions to Stanley's own immigrant background.</P>
<P>All those many subplots are, on the other hand, excellent
opportunity for Cimino to make another film of epic
proportions. High budget, today almost unimaginable for the
movies that deal with simple "cops and robbers" stories,
gave an excellent opportunities for many delicate mass
scenes that Cimino likes so much. Some of them - like a
meeting with drug-producing rebels in the hills of Burma,
funerals, complicated shootouts in public places - are
impressive and would remain long in the the viewer's memory.
Unfortunately, Cimino didn't care much of the script, and
some of those scenes, including many unnecessary subplots
and scenes involving side characters, slow the pace of the
movie significantly. The uninspiring musical score by David
Mansfield is often used on the wrong places and because of
it, YEAR OF THE DRAGON sometimes look like a incoherent
combination of many different movies. However, despite all
those faults, and also because such movies would be hard to
make these days, YEAR OF THE DRAGON remains one of those
rare Hollywood products - unusual and thought-provoking
films.</P>
