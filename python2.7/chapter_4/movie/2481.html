<P>     Ever had a bad day?  Of course you have.  We all have.  But in THE
REF, Denis Leary experiences what it's like when Murphy's Law is in
full force.  This man just can't catch a break.  As a statement that
crime doesn't pay, this film sure gets the point across, and in a
manner that O. Henry would appreciate.</P>
<P>     Gus (Denis Leary) is an expert burglar undone by a "Road Runner"
type alarm system installed in the safe of his latest victim, the owner
of an upscale Connecticut mansion.  Fleeing a nasty encounter with a
guard dog named Cannibal, Gus hijacks a couple at a local convenience
store.  Unfortunately for him, his choice for hostages, Lloyd and
Caroline Chasseur (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), are in the midst of a
knock-down, drag-out fight that promises to continue well into this
chilly Christmas Eve, no matter how much Gus demands that they shut
up.  The bickering gets louder after the trio reaches the Chasseur
house, prompting Gus to declare that he has stumbled into "the fifth
ring of hell."  And the evening is just beginning....</P>
<P>     Usually, the burglar is supposed to be the bad guy, and his
hostages the victims, right?  Not in THE REF.  It quickly becomes
apparent that no matter who's holding the gun, Gus is the one in for a
long night.  The manner in which the situation develops isn't scripted
with great ingenuity or originality, but the dialogue sparkles.  Not
only is it funny, but it's occasionally insightful.  As delivered by
Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey, the barbs thrown by husband and wife
crackle with energy.</P>
<P>     Denis Leary is surprisingly subdued.  Until the last minute of the
picture, there aren't any of his trademark fast-talking, wisecracking
tirades.  He plays the role of Gus with the perfect blend of self-
deprecating sarcasm and sheer disbelief at the situation he's gotten
himself into.  One wonders if Gus has ever read "The Ransom of Red
Chief."</P>
<P>     The unwanted relatives that show up around the film's midpoint add
another dimension of hilarity to THE REF, and keep the overall story
from growing tired.  The same cannot be said of various snippets that
occur away from the Chasseur house, such as a subplot involving the
local police chief which is developed but never concluded.  While
occasionally amusing, these scenes do little more than distract from
the verbal war between Lloyd and Caroline.</P>
<P>     There's a sense that a lot of THE REF was snipped in the cutting
room.  While this undoubtedly helped the pacing, it also opened a few
noticeable plot holes.  This is not a seamlessly constructed movie, but
as long as you're not expecting great art, it's unlikely to
disappoint.</P>
<P>     The dramatic scenes aren't generally effective, but the comic bits
more than make up for most of the deficiencies.  Those searching for
something that examines a crumbling marriage with greater depth and
sensitivity would do better watching Judy Davis in HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
THE REF is designed more for those willing to empathize with Gus, a man
having the kind of day that most of us don't even like to have
nightmares about.</P>
<PRE>     Merry Christmas.</PRE>
