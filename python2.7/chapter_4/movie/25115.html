<PRE>SUNSHINE
--------</PRE>
<P>An alcoholic elixer known as "A Taste of Sunshine" brings wealth and
social standing to the Jewish family Sonnenschein (German for sunshine)
under the helm of Emmanuelle (David De Keyser, "Yentl").  Ralph Fiennes
plays his son Ignatz as well as two subsequent generations as the family
is buffetted through almost a century of turbulent Hungarian history.</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>Director Istvan Szabo ("Mephisto") cowrote this epic with famed playwright
Israel Horovitz ("Growing Up Jewish") which takes its family through
the end of a monarchy, the subsequent decline into fascism (and the
Holocaust) and the reactionary institution of communism.  Ignatz makes
his father proud by studying law and becoming a judge loyal to the crown,
while his brother Gustave (James Frain, "Where the Heart Is") becomes
a doctor of more liberal politics.  Then there's Valerie (Jennifer Ehle,
daughter of Rosemary Harris who takes on the role as the character ages),
the orphaned daughter of Emmanuel's brother whom Emmanuel adopts and raises
as his own.  The sexual spark between Valerie and Ignatz causes grief
to their parents while making Gustave jealous, but it will not be denied
and the two marry.  However, Valerie's political leanings are aligned with
Gustave's and eventually she leaves one brother for the other.
Ignatz also changes his family name to the more Hungarian (and less
Jewish) Sors (which means destiny) at the suggestion of the chief justice
and Valerie and Gustave follow suit, much to their parents' sadness.</P>
<P>Valerie and Ignatz's son Adam (Fiennes again) lives a life of priviledge
and becomes a national hero as a fencing champion, even winning Olympic
Gold.  He too has women problems as his sister-in-law Greta (Rachel Weisz,
"The Mummy") bullies him into an affair ('We're a lucky family - everyone
loves everybody else,' Adam comments wryly.).  When the Nazi regime rises and
rules governing Jewishness are heard on the radio, the Sonnenscheins/Sors
family qualify for special standing due to war medals and that Olympic gold,
but the family still ends up in the death camps, which only Adam's son
Ivan (Fiennes) and his grandmother Valerie (Harris by this point) survive.</P>
<P>Ivan becomes a pawn of the communist movement, although he has a good man,
Andor Knorr, as a mentor.  Like his father and grandfather before him,
Ivan has a messy love life, becoming embroiled in an affair with the wife
(Deborah Kara Unger, "The Game") of a high ranking official.  When the
communist party begins to turn in upon itslef and Knorr is targetted, Ivan
is forced to condemn his old friend.</P>
<P>The story is always interesting, yet is harmed by its willingness to stoop to
soap opera level.  Even more serious of a flaw is that each generation
played by Fiennes is essentially a weak, comprised man overpowered by the
women who love him.  The three hour film seems too short in that scenes
are abbreviated while we barrel into the next one in order to cram all
the events in.  The film plays like a six hour miniseries that's been
editted for theatrical release.</P>
<P>There are some standout performances, chiefly Jennifer Ehle ("Wilde," 
"Bedrooms and Hallways") who resembles a young Meryl Streep in both looks
and talent.  Her strong character is never compromised as she searches
for truth and beauty in life.  Rosemary Harris picks up the reins admirably,
but the film suffers when Ehle leaves the screen.  (A far less smooth 
transition is achieved when John Neville ("The Adventures of Baron von
Munchausen") takes over for Frain, whom he resembles not in the slightest).</P>
<P>Also exceptional is David De Keyser as Emmanuel, the good father whose 
children perplex and try him while also filling him with pride.  Miriam 
Margolyes ("The Age of Innocence") gives another great turn as his embittered 
wife Rose who loves her own sons over her niece and resents a similar cousin 
who once tempted her own husband.  Fiennes himself is solid, creating three 
distinct characters whose bloodlines demand they still resemble each other, but 
his performance is passionless.  William Hurt stands out as the decent Knorr,
remaining honorable as he's besmirched by his own party.  Rachel Weisz is
appropriately hiss-worthy as Adam's selfish lover while Molly Parker ("Kissed")
is bland as his wife.  Kara Unger is good as a woman whose sexual appetites
override her sense.</P>
<P>The film looks stunning, with cinematography by Lajos Koltai ("Mother")
utilizing a marvelous color scheme.  The first hour of the film is bathed
in golds and ambers, reflecting the "Taste of Sunshine" upon which the 
family is based, as well as nostalgia for a lost age.  The subsequent two
hours begin with the blinding whites of the fencing sport, which evolves into 
the reds of Communism and sickly greens of institutionism - the three colors 
of the oft-seen Hungarian flag.  Koltai also makes great use of his Budapest
locations and leaves the audience with some memorable images, such as
Valerie sitting in a courtyard filled with yellow flowers or Adam, left
hanging from a tree in a Nazi death camp encased in ice.</P>
<PRE>B</PRE>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Ralph Fiennes stars as father, son and grandson in the multi-generation drama
by veteran Hungarian filmmaker Istvan Szabo ("Mephisto," "Colonel Redl") in the
epic family film, "Sunshine." The story is told by grandson Ivan Sonnenschein
(which translates to the "Sunshine" of the title) and begins the tale of how
Great-great-grandfather Emmanuelle built his fortune using a secret family
recipe for a marvelous elixir called "A Taste of Sunshine." However, his sons
Ignatz (Fiennes) and Gustav (James Frain) refuse to follow in his footsteps and
seek more intellectual pursuits - Ignatz becomes a judge, while Gustav pursued
a career in medicine.</P>
<P>The family fable focuses on the ambitious Ignatz Sonnenschein as he abandons
his Jewish heritage in favor of advancing himself in the Hungarian Empire's
judicial system. His father is aghast when Ignatz changes his name to the more 
Christian sounding Sors and announces his amorous intentions for his cousin 
(almost a sister) Valerie. Ignatz's loyalty is to his emperor, not to his 
family, and he forsakes his Jewish past for personal advancement. His 
conservatism backfires, though, as the Europe is thrust into the throes of The 
Great War and beyond.  When Communism rears its ugly head, Ignatz falls from 
grace with the ruling regime and becomes a mere pawn in his country's 
political upheaval.</P>
<P>As Ignatz fades from the picture, his son, Adam (Fiennes), develops into an
outstanding athlete. He continues his father's denial of their Jewish faith,
converting to Catholicism in order to compete on the restricted national
fencing team. When he wins the gold medal at the 1936 Munich Olympics, his 
future in the again conservative regime seems assured. Then, with the rise of 
the Nazis to power in Europe, anti-Semitism rages and the Jewish Laws are 
issued. Adam steadfastly maintains that his exemptions - converted Catholic 
and national hero - protect him and his family from the fate awaiting Europe's 
Jews. In shock, Adam and his son, Ivan, are shipped to a concentration camp 
where Adam's demands that he is exempt and should be released end, literally, 
in his chilling death.</P>
<P>Ivan (Fiennes) survives the camp and, as a young man, becomes a police
investigator and embraces the Communist Cause as the savior for the survivors
of the Holocaust and Hitler's deadly fascism. But, changing masters does not
create the freedom that Ivan expected as the communist leaders, under the 
thumb of Josef Stalin, reprise the same brutal repression as Hitler's henchmen. 
Ivan, through the influences of his old grandma (Valerie, played in later 
years by Rosemary Harris) and aging uncle Gustav (John Neville), embraces his 
Hebrew past and rejects, even subverts, the communist oppression of the 
Hungarian people.  The final straw for the young man is when he is ordered to 
interrogate and expose his friend and mentor, Andor Korr (William Hurt), 
bringing the family tale full circle.</P>
<P>"Sunshine" is an ambitious film that spans decades, with the concentration on
Fiennes's several lives. The political and personal lives of each Sonnenschein
lad are influenced by the whims of history as one regime replace another, each
with a promise of a better life for its citizens. The promise is never kept,
though, and the people are mere duckpins in the political game as conservative
regime replaces liberal, then communist replaces fascist, ad infinitum. The
political scope of the film is impressive in it span of time and detail. The
upheavals that occur through Hungary's history are depicted with accuracy,
starting with the decaying opulence of the Austria-Hungarian Empire of Franz
Josef.</P>
<P>When World War One is thrust upon the countries of Europe, the political fabric
is torn asunder and traditional ways are destroyed forever. Chaos takes control
as followers of the left and right vie with each other to take control.
Communism takes command of Russia, while the rise of the Nazis grips Germany
and, eventually, the rest of the continent. Hungary sways first in one
direction, then the other, as the left and right struggle to take over the
government. This strife is shown in parallel as each of the Sonnenschein boys
makes his mark on their individual generations, trying to garner favor from the
powers that be.</P>
<P>While Ralph Fiennes is the nominal star of the film, it is really an ensemble
effort with some outstanding performances. Fiennes puts a unique spin on each
of his characters and does an impressive job of making each one different. It's 
a big creative challenge that the actor handles well enough, but there is a
flatness that permeates all three perfs. More impressive is the pair of
performances by the actresses who portray Valerie as, first, a young lady, and
later, an old woman. Jennifer Ehle is cast as Valerie the younger who becomes
the lover and wife of Ignatz. Ehle outshines Fiennes (and everyone else) in
every scene she is in, coming across as smart, independent, confident and
capable. Rosemary Harris, Ehle's real-life mother, plays Valerie in her
twilight years and carries forth the strengths developed by the younger Val. 
These two ladies are the best things in "Sunshine."</P>
<P>The rest of the large cast provides the requisite depth to their respective
roles, but are all so briefly presented that there isn't much time to develop
each character. Of the others, William Hurt stands out as the honest and
trusting Andor. He believes that his country is finally ready to care for its
people, only to have his ideals smashed by the brutal oligarchy of the
communists. His downfall also reps a significant turning point for Ivan.</P>
<P>There is depth in the screenplay by Szabo and Hungarian playwright Israel
Horowitz and they have no trouble in filling the film's 180 minute run time
with its three interlocking tales. But, 3 hours is a big investment of time 
for a moviegoer and Fiennes does not give a compelling enough performance to 
warrant the time for most. It's not the type of film I can "recommend" but I 
don't regret seeing it, either. It's an enigma.</P>
<P>Tech credits are first rate with Lajos Koltai providing the lush photography
that helps carry the sought after period feel. Costume, by Pedro Moreno, and
set design, by Attila Kovacs, recreate, nicely, the flow of Hungarian history 
over the last century. The score, by Maurice Jarre, suits the mood of the film.</P>
<PRE>I give "Sunshine" a B.</PRE>
