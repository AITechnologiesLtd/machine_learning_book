<PRE>"The Others" -- A Mesmerizing Bump in the Night
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>During the carefree school days of the 5th grade, we
had a gothic teacher named Mr. Hunt.  I secretly
called him "Mr. Haunt" because he had skin that made
him look somewhat charred, a box-like head and a
hairstyle that made him look like a distant cousin of
Frankenstein, and a gaze that might make you shiver. 
While his presence occasionally gave me (and some of
the other classmates) a few goose bumps, he was
beloved by all.  He knew how to keep us entertained. 
But most of all, he really knew how to tell a good
ghost story.</P>
<P>He would dim the lights, draw the curtains, bring out
a set of eerie noisemakers, and direct a flashlight
unto his face from under his chin to give himself a
spectral glow.  As he told his story, I would
sometimes cover my ears just to calm myself down.  </P>
<P>That kind of spine-tingling sensation has been
resurrected in "The Others," a wonderfully tense,
thoroughly haunting, old-fashioned ghost story.  The
film literally starts off with a scream.   Set just
after WWII, Grace (icy Nicole Kidman) lives in a
palatial yet isolated English mansion where eerie
things start to happen.  Enshrouded by fog and a
moribund stillness, this imposing estate would howl
itself if it could.</P>
<P>Grace is already a tormented soul who negotiates an
almost unbearable existence.  Her two children, Anne
(Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), who look
to be lifted from an Edgar Allen Poe tale, suffer from
a rare condition that renders them fatally allergic to
the light.  As such, the curtains must be drawn to
keep out the warmth of the sun.  She's also waiting
for the return of her husband (Christopher Eccleston)
from the war front.  Likely, however, he is already
dead.  She would easily succumb to insanity if not for
her devout faith.  </P>
<P>She relies on her religious grounding to combat the
unexplained and spooky things that eventually happen. 
For example, Anne claims to have conversations with an
unseen boy; strange noises emanate from a never-used
room; voices can be heard in the distance.  While
Grace doesn't believe in the supernatural, doubt and
fear slowly and creep in.  The chill of the unknown
not only eventually affects the stoic mother, but
slowly envelops the audience as well.</P>
<P>Writer-director Alejandro Amenabar ably plays upon our
inherent fear of the dark to create an edgy and moody
atmosphere that's sure to increase your heartbeat.  He
utilizes unsettling caterwaul-like music, shadows in
corridors, white sheets draped over furniture, and a
particularly effective camera trick -- whenever Grace
would slowly open a door, the camera would be
positioned behind our tragic heroine.  Like a child
who hides behind her mother when frightened, we also
want to hide, but agonize over what's behind that
door.  So chilling at times is this tale that the
scariest scene actually happens in broad daylight!</P>
<P>I can go on lauding Kidman's steely performance and
the tone of unbridled fear established by the
wonderful child actors.  But I scare easily anyway. 
So, what did the audience think?  Throughout the film,
there was mostly dead silence and the occasional
scream from the intimidated.  Where did all the
popcorn munchers go?  Perhaps there were only 20
people in the audience.  Surprisingly, when the lights
went up, there were 200!  They were all riveted by
what they saw, too afraid to move, completely
entranced by "The Others."</P>
