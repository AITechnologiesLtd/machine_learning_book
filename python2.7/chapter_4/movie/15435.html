<P>Meet Joe Black (Reviewed on Nov. 27/98)</P>
<P>Starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani</P>
<P>In "Meet Joe Black", Brad Pitt plays Death.  </P>
<P>That's all that really needs to be said, but nevertheless, I will provide
the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot
description.  Death decides to take a holiday, what with all the rigors of
soul-collecting and all, and forces Anthony Hopkins into showing him what
it's like to be human.  Death assumes the body of Brad Pitt, and from
there, much trouble ensues.</P>
<P>For one thing, Death-as-Pitt falls in love with Hopkins daughter, played
by Claire Forlani.  Obviously this enrages Hopkins, because really, what
can Death offer?  Besides eternal damnation, of course.  There is also a
sub-plot about Forlani's ex-boyfriend (she dumps him for Pitt) trying to
take over Hopkins company.</P>
<P>"Meet Joe Black" runs just under three hours.  I've always thought that
such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics.  "Meet
Joe Black" is neither historical nor is it an epic, though I get the
feeling Martin Brest (the director) desperately wants it to be.  Every
single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long.  And the
ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should.  A severe
editing job could have made this movie excellent, instead of just good,
which is what it is.</P>
<P>Pitt, an actor I normally loathe, is actually quite engaging as Death.  I
believed his performance, and I could see why Forlani's character would
fall in love with him.  I have to agree with Roger Ebert, though, who
found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time
wouldn't know what peanut butter was.  That has nothing to do with Pitt's
performance, of course, but it is a little distracting.</P>
<P>Hopkins gives his usual excellent performance.  He's able to portray the
angst of a man who knows he has very little time left, without making him
an obnoxious whiner.  And in her first major studio role, Claire Forlani
is surprisingly good.  She has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience
to instantly root for her.  </P>
<P>So, "Meet Joe Black" is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running
time.  Had the film been cut by an hour or so, I have no doubt that I
would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review.</P>
