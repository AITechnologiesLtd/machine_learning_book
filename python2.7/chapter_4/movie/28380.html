CURE (KYUA)   * *</PRE>
<PRE>1997 - Japan
Director: Kiyoshi Kurosawa
Starring: Yoriko Douguchi, Masato Hagiwara, Anna Nakagawa</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>"Cure" by itself is confusing. It's awfully slow, and takes a while for 
payoff, if such an ending can really be called that. The story follows a 
detective who is investigating a series of murders where the victims have Xs 
slashed into their throats, usually by their best friends. When the 
mysterious amnesiac the police think has planted hypnotic suggestions into 
the murder's brains comes in for interrogation, things become only more 
difficult. As the investigation continues, our detective hero finds himself 
entangled in the mastermind's web of thought, and finds his feelings about 
his amnesiac wife souring. </P>
<P>Got all that? Seattle International Film Festival 2001's emerging master 
Kiyoshi Kurosawa (no relation to Akira) peppers his story with long, gazing 
shots that have little to do with what's going on, and then inserts important 
plot points in quick flashes. The result is a lumbering thriller that winds 
you up on its little finger, and then lets you off with absolutely no reward, 
and certainly no purpose. This is just another violent, action/gangster film 
from Japan. </P>
<P>After the film in a question and answer session, Kurosawa explained what was 
going on. I wondered if we had just seen the same film. While moody and 
atmospheric, the filmmaker's job to accurately convey the story he imagined 
fails. Kurosawa is emerging, but he's hardly a master. Avoid this one. </P>
