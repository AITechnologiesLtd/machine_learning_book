<PRE> "A Knight's Tale" </PRE>
<P>In the days of yore only those of noble birth were allowed the honor of 
knighthood. The superstar athlete of his day, the knight would compete in 
mock battle at staged tournaments for the pleasure of the masses. One young 
man, lowborn William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), defies convention when he 
impersonates his now-dead liege lord and goes for the gold in "A Knight's 
Tale." </P>
<P>Writer/director Brian Helgeland delved into film noire, and earned a 
screenplay Oscar in the process, with his period crime thriller, "L.A. 
Confidential." He takes a sharp turn from mayhem to mirth with his latest 
oeuvre, covering territories that range from medieval fairytale adventure 
to contemporary pop culture. Mixing period and pop is a hard task that 
rarely meets with success, though there are exceptions, most involving 
Shakespeare. </P>
<P>There is an obvious hip ness to the material that is the crux of the 
juggling act the writer/director is trying to perform. Throughout the film 
he intersperses modern music and readily identifiable contemporary film and 
social references that meld the modern with the medieval. We're greeted, at 
the start of a jousting tournament, with the raucous refrains of Queen's 
"We Will Rock You" and the Middle Ages crowd of onlookers clapping and 
stomping and doing waves. It's slick and amusing, though the disparity in 
periods brings attention to itself as the film plays on. </P>
<P>The routine, oft-told tale of a young commoner striving to be something 
beyond his birthright, to "change his stars," is a staple for modern 
storytelling. Helgeland doesn't screw around with the rags to riches 
structure and concentrates on the exciting action of the tournament events 
- particularly the high-profile jousting matches - and his characters. </P>
<P>Heath Ledger is the first among equals in an ensemble effort that gives the 
young actor a chance to showcase himself while others get their chance at 
the limelight, too. The young Australian made a likable debut in "10 Things 
I Hate About You" and continues to build upon his good looks and easygoing 
charm as the ambitious Will Thatcher. Ledger handles the gamut of tasks put 
before him and acquits himself quite well riding, singing, dancing, sword 
fighting, and in comedy and stunt work. </P>
<P>The band of misfits accompanying William on his quest are an eclectic 
collection of affable rogues who are reluctantly drawn in to the young 
squire's hair-brained, and potentially deadly, scheme. Mark Addy ("The Full 
Monty") is solid as the serious-minded best friend, Roland. Alan Tudyk 
plays William's enforcer, Wat, a carrot-topped vassal whose hot-headedness 
is tempered by his loyalty to his friends. Rounding out William's merry men 
is a young poet and story-teller named Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany), who 
acts as Williams press agent, promoter and ring announcer, and a pretty 
blacksmith named Kate (Laura Fraser), a real master of metals. The only 
problem with these characters and their performances is you don't get 
enough of them. The rest of the cast is adequate, though Shannyn Sossamon 
as the love interest, Jocelyn, is pretty but little more than an object of 
affection - no sparks fly between her and William. </P>
<P>The production is first-class with great attention paid to medieval period 
details, but with a contempo feel throughout. The big tournie scenes 
maintain a Super Bowl atmosphere with the audience hyped to a fever pitch 
as the jousting action mounts. The jousts tend to be repetitive, as 
expected when two guys try to knock each other off their horses with a big 
stick, but slickly edited and visually exciting. The behind-the-camera tech 
team members providing the visuals for "A Knight's Tale" are equal to the 
director's talent and vision. Cinematographer Richard Greatrex, production 
designer Tony Burrough, and costumer and armor designer Caroline Harris 
contribute to the modern/medieval look that Helgeland seeks. 
The use of modern pop and rock music is handled in an amusing and 
interesting way, with each tune selected to appropriately fit the scene in 
which it is used. David Bowie's "Golden Years" is used over a Middle Ages 
line dance; Bachman-Turner Overdrive's "Takin' Care of Business" plays as 
William establishes himself as the leader and true friend of his little 
band; The World Series of tournaments, London, has the dream team come into 
town under Thin Lizzy's "The Boys Are Back In Town." Each tune works and 
will please the hipsters in the audience. </P>
<P>Brian Helgeland picked a tough nut in his combo of "Rocky" meets the 
knights of old yarn and, while not a great film, "A Knight's Tale" does a 
sound job in putting together the combination. The attractive, likable cast 
and excellent production values overcome the sometimes overly hip 
screenplay. I give it a B. </P>
