<P>Susan Granger's review of "BOYS DON'T CRY" (Fox Searchlight Pictures)</P>
<P>         First-time writer/director Kimberly Peirce was so appalled
when she read a newspaper account of how and why 21 year-old Teena
Brandon was shot dead with two friends in a farmhouse just outside
Falls City, Nebraska, back in 1994, that she was determined to bring
this true story to the screen. Teena Brandon - a.k.a. Brandon Teena -
so desperately desired to be a boy that she posed as one. She
"strapped and packed" by flattening her breasts beneath surgical
bandages and inserting socks into the crotch of her jeans. Not only
did she get away with the pathetic masquerade but, amazingly, she
seduced several young women who, when they questioned her sexual
identity, were told that she was a hermaphrodite. Brandon adamantly
insisted that she was not a lesbian, explaining that she was really a
boy trapped in a girl's body and often spoke of plans to have a sex
change operation. Actress Hilary Swank (TV's " Beverly Hills 90210")
delivers an incredibly believable performance as the troubled
"pretty-boy" Brandon with Chloe Sevigny as the gullible girl who
adores her. The problem is that all of the characters are essentially
repugnant for one reason or another, so it's difficult to relate to
any of them. (Giving a toddler beer to drink is hardly an endearing
quality.) Plus, there's a gratuitously violently brutal rape scene in
which two local boys (Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III) take their
revenge on the deceitful "dyke" - and that, in particular, is
distasteful and difficult to watch. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to
10, "Boys Don't Cry" is a pathetic, sad 4. It's a tragic, depressing
tale of prejudice and hatred.</P>
