<P>
The Church of the SubGenius has a motto for breaking away from the chains
of conformity: "Repent!  Quit your job!  Slack off!"  And that's
essentially what AMERICAN BEAUTY is about: waking up and realizing what a
sham modern life is, before it's too late.  But there are powerful forces
at work forces determined to keep us subservient and asleep; if you're not
careful, you'll invoke the wrath of these all-powerful gods and they'll
destroy you.  So it is with films of this sort: when the protagonist (you
can't call him a "hero") wakes up and begins enjoying life to its fullest,
he is soon destroyed by the inability of his companions, co-workers, and
family to allow him the freedom to rebel.  In other words: If you dare to
break away and be yourself, you're screwed.</P>
<P>AMERICAN BEAUTY follows the path tread by other movies of this sort, from
David Lynch's BLUE VELVET to Linklater's SLACKER, or BREAKING AWAY, or
even ROBOCOP.  The setting of a peaceful, perfect-looking suburban town
suggests echoes of Lynch, but rather than following BLUE VELVET's idea
that "it's a strange world" lying beneath the surface of picket fences
and bright colors (the opening scenes of this movie include a white
picket fence and dazzling red roses, reminiscent of Lynch's creation),
this movie dares to suggest that you can become *part* of the weirdness --
and if you do, then you'll realize once again that life can be fun and
exciting.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey is Lester Burnham, the man who repents, quits his job, and
slacks off.  He describes himself as a pethetic loser, but in fact
everyone in his world is so screwed up by their attempts to be successful
and "normal" that he's the only one who bothers to acknowledge it.  And
when he gets a glimpse of his daughter's best friend (a luscious
17-year-old cheerleader), he reacts in a manner that any grown-up man
would when he spies a girl of that sort.  But he's so beaten down and
numbed by his screwed-up "grown-up" life that the sudden feeling of
emotion takes him by surprise, overwhelming him and causing him to wake up
at last.  For a 42-year-old man to be lusting after a teenage girl is the
epitome of depravity...but Lester isn't really the dirty, sleazy child
molester that some critics of this movie have labelled him.  He's reaching
back to the time when he was 20 years old, free of responsibility,
listening to rock music and smoking pot, and lusting after teenage girls
when he was at the age to do so.  Lester was probably so much of an
outcast that at 20, he didn't have the courage to approach the object of
his fantasy.  And because his soul has been chained to a rock of
conformity and obedieance, he isn't able to wake up and achieve his goals
until now.</P>
<P>But *they* don't like that: how can this man actually expect to rebel
against authority and conformity, and even manage to be HAPPY?!?  Lester
may have been screwed up, but what none of the other characters in his
world want to admit is that they're even worse off than he is.  One of
this movie's strengths is the way that while we're given a lot of biting,
vicious laughs at the expense of Lester's wife, we also see that she's
terrified of the world -- so much so that we pity her, and we can honestly
understand her feelings during the movie's climax, as she drives home to
confront her husband for one last time.</P>
<P>And Lester's daughter -- played by Thora Birch, with a hairstyle and
makeup resembling Christina Ricci -- is so ashamed of her screwed-up
parents (and herself, for being raised in an environment like this) that
she saves money for a breast implant she doesn't really need and listens
to her best friend bragging about her sexual conquests.  So when the son
of her next-door neighbor comes into her life, offering her an alternative
from the asphyxiating "normality" of her everyday surroundings, she jumps
at the chance and bares herself (literally) to him.  In fact, it's the
neighbor's kid -- the one who gives Lester his first joint and encourages
him to rebel against society -- who's happiest in this movie.  (The fact
that his character spent two years in a mental instution probably
contributes to this: the world of AMERICAN BEAUTY is so insane that the
institution was enough of an escape to allow him to come to terms with
himself.)</P>
<P>The characters are what make this such a fascinating and entertaining
movie: they're out of control, every single one -- and yet we have no
problem seeing a little bit of ourselves there, right on the screen.  Am I
as hopeless and pathetic as Lester, scurrying to my job every day and
taking abuse from my boss?  Is my life destined to become as empty and
shapeless as his?  Or is it still possible for me to Repent, Quit my job,
and Slack Off? </P>
<P>The story has a few awkward moments, mostly during the scenes that shape
the ongoing plot and make it seem a bit too contrived at times --
especially during the scene where Lester's next-door neighbor spies him
"seducing" his son, and later going to his home to confront him.  But the
movie is still off-kilter enough to keep us guessing to the very end...and
while the ultimate resolution of the movie isn't quite as satisfying as it
could be, it still doesn't feel like a cop-out.</P>
<P>But in spite of alll this blathering, I haven't really been able to show
you what a wicked black comedy AMERICAN BEAUTY is.  It's one of the few
Hollywood movies to come out that dares to go for the jugular, shoving a
mirror into our faces and making us laugh at what a mockery our lives are.
If the world of real life wasn't as screwed up as it is, then we might not
need a movie like this.  But, unfortunately, we do.</P>
