<PRE>Pushing Tin
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) It is well known that air traffic controllers have one
of the most stressful jobs there is. So it seems odd that before now,
they haven't shown up as the subjects of a movie. </P>
<P>John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton break onto the screen as two
interesting specimens. Both are at the top of their field, though each
takes a different approach to his job.</P>
<P>Nick (Cusack) is extroverted and fun-loving. He has nervous tics and
can't handle driving below the speed limit. He's an alpha-male
overachiever, a grown-up kid who loves the stress and challenges of his
job.</P>
<P>During the film's setup, we catch a glimpse of what goes on in his mind
while he's working. The simple blips on the controller's screen
transform themselves into an active, dynamic 3-D computer simulation
when he's "in the zone."</P>
<P>Once we get a feel for the fast-paced, close-knit camaraderie of the
control room, the film introduces us to Bell (Thornton). He's the new
kid on the job with a killer rep. Rumors that he stood under a landing
747 to ride the turbulence turn out to be true. But unlike Nick, he's
always cool under pressure. He's just as good as Nick, but he doesn't
wear his adrenalin on his sleeve.</P>
<P>Nick is thrown off-balance by the arrival of Bell. Having someone equal
to him in the control room shakes him deeply, and he doesn't know how to
react. He's jealous of Bell. He doesn't dislike or begrudge him, but he
can't let go of the fact that someone else might be as good as or better
than him.</P>
<P>An unspoken competitive tension exists between the two characters --
mostly in Nick, but kept alive by Bell. Their tension is a spark waiting
for some fuel, say three bottles of vodka and several glasses of wine,
to ignite it.</P>
<P>Nick finds Bell's buxom wife Mary (played by the big-lipped Angelina
Jolie) crying in the supermarket with mostly vodka in her cart. She's
looking for sympathy and he's looking to give it. Since neither spouse
is home, the two end up in an Italian restaurant sharing lots of stories
and too much wine. Nick valiantly offers to follow her home, just to be
sure she gets there safely. One thing inevitably leads to another, and
the two end up in bed together.</P>
<P>Bell finds out what happened and reacts with his usual calm. Although
he's calm, he still manages to get back at Nick by insinuating some
cross-cheating with Nick's wife. These mind games make Nick jealous and
confused, as they were no doubt intended to.</P>
<P>The plot wanders away from its two main characters before it takes a
firm shape. Just when you think the film is entirely about Nick and Bell
and their wives, screenwriters Glenn Charles and Les Charles (of
"Cheers" fame) introduce a horribly transparent plot device. A bomb
threat is called in and the shift supervisor says "I need two" (what a
coincidence) "good men to stay and man the scopes!"</P>
<P>After that, it's hardly worth tracking the plot. The bomb threat clears.
Nick's wife Connie (Cate Blanchett, underused in this role) eventually
learns of his infidelity. Nick's paranoia about Bell comes to a head.
There are two or three "endings," none of which really feels like it
wraps up the whole movie.</P>
<P>Suffice it to say everything works out in the end for everyone, after
Nick undergoes a contrived catharsis that doesn't even make sense
emotionally.</P>
<P>PUSHING TIN is borderline recommendable. With such a confused and
contrived final act, the movie leaves you with a bad taste. But it CAN
be worth the price of admission, if you're not going for the plot.</P>
<P>Go because of the well-formed, well written characters. Go because of
the funny, solid camaraderie of the air traffic controllers. Go because
Cusack is surprisingly good and Thornton is predictably good. Go with
forgiveness in your heart, save some for the ending, and have a good
time.</P>
