<PRE>A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>One reason I think Jackie Chan is such a hit with American audiences is 
because his movies are so much fun. Known internationally as a martial arts 
master, he first appeared in the states with Operation Condor, First Strike, 
and Rumble in the Bronx. More recently, his first American film, Rush Hour, 
grossed over $100 million at the box office. This was mostly due to its 
mixture of comedy and nonstop action. Chan's latest, Shanghai Noon, does not 
deviate from the humorous action setup that worked so well before. This is 
basically Rush Hour with spurs and ten gallon hats. While this may seem like 
a disappointing thing at first, it turns out not to be. Shanghai Noon is the 
continuation of a movie I never really wanted to end, and by the time the 
film closed, I was asking for more.</P>
<P>Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is an Imperial Guard who gets sent to America to 
recover Princess Pei Pei (Ally McBeal's Lucy Liu) whom the Emperor believes 
was kidnapped. She actually went voluntarily, and gets tricked into working 
with a large group of Chinese immigrants on a railroad in present day Nevada. 
Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) is the talkative leader of a group of bandits who 
make the mistake of robbing the train that Wong is on. About five thrilling 
action scenes later, O'Bannon and Wong decide to team up together to rescue 
the Princess, and return her to China.  Many adventures involving a variety 
of villains and a variety of weapons ensue that will test the two friends' 
trust for each other.</P>
<P>Shanghai Noon is probably the funniest movie released so far this year, and 
is easily Chan's best. The fish out of water and radically different buddy 
plotline works magically again. As the chatty and sensitive O'Bannon, Owen 
Wilson shows much more potential than his previous efforts in Armageddon and 
The Haunting. He provides a nice alternative to the annoying Chris Tucker. 
Much of the film's humor derives from racial differences. When a Western 
couple is debating why Wong is wearing a dress (it's actually his Imperial 
uniform) they decide he must be one of those Jews. Similar jokes involving 
the Chinese, Native Americans, and African Americans are also present. 
However, the film is lighthearted, and the jokes aren't nearly as shocking as 
those of, say, Blazing Saddles. In addition to some offensive humor, there 
are a barrelful of clichés we've all seen before. These too get effectively 
covered up by the film's fast paced action and excitement. Jackie Chan 
retains his usual charm, and when you see Wong fighting a number of Crow 
Indians or a saloon of men with his bare hands, you know you are watching 
classic Chan. Pei Pei gets to kick some butt too. Lucy Liu, who will star in 
the kung fu heavy Charlie's Angels, proves she's no damsel in distress. It's 
nice to see a female character tangle with the guys. This movie has the 
perfect balance of comedy and action, but one must wonder how long this 
racial divide blockbuster action picture formula can last. I'm not sure 
exactly whose idea it was to open Noon the same week as Mission: Impossible 
2, but it is a worthy competitor. It is not only a better bang for your buck 
action flick, it achieves humor that is impossible to find in M:I-2. After 
the film ends, watch for the usual outakes, a token, and often best part of a 
Chan film. This movie embodies what summer really should be, lots and lots of 
fun.</P>
