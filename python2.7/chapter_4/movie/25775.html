Susan Granger's review of "GODZILLA 2000" (Toho Films/Tri-Star Pictures)</P>
<P>Good grief! Another Godzilla movie? The legendary lizard is
back in this low-tech, sci-fi fantasy from Japan's Toho studio - one
that seems better suited to the video screen than a theatrical
release. Actually, it's the 24th Godzilla picture - and much like the
rest. Directed by Takao Okawara, the story follows Godzilla as he
leaves his underwater home off Japan's coast, destroys a submarine and
seaside restaurant, and heads for a nuclear power plant. A sympathetic
scientist and his daughter, along with an eager reporter, want to
study Godzilla - forming a Godzilla Prediction Network - but the
military, as usual, has other explosive plans and Tokyo gets trampled
in the process. The twist this time comes from a shape-shifting,
radio-active, 6,000 year-old flying rock from outer space, an alien
Orga, who tries to gobble the fire-breathing Godzilla.  No effort has
been made to try to synchronize the silly Japanese dialogue with the
cheesy, dubbed-over Americanized English, and the results can only be
called ludicrous. "Ah, the damn teriyaki is cold again!" says a diner
when the big, green lizard lands near a noodle shop. "Great Caesar's
ghost!" exclaims another character. There's also little attempt to
disguise the actor who's wearing a cleated rubber suit.  Originally
conceived as a cautionary tale, "Godzilla, King of the Monsters" made
its debut in 1954 and, fittingly, the current Godzilla's size has been
scaled down from 328 feet (1991-1995 versions) to a mere 170 feet,
closer to the original concept of 168 feet, as detailed in the earlier
incarnations. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Godzilla 2000"
is a tedious 2 - for die-hard fans only - because "Maybe because
Godzilla is inside each one of us."</P>
