10/10</PRE>
<P>'American Beauty' is one of those films that leave a huge emotional impact
that remains for days after you have seen it. Seldom have I seen such
marvelous characters, each somehow representing an important puzzle piece of
our modern society. And it is not often you get to experience a film where
virtually every actor is giving an award worthy performance. The story
itself is a constantly surprising, complex and ingeniously spinned web of
events, ideas, characters, thoughts and feelings.</P>
<P>The hero in the story is Lester (Kevin Spacey). He is working in a
respectable firm, lives in a great neighborhood, has a beautiful wife and a
sweet daughter. He is living the American dream -- or so it seems. The truth
is that Lester is hated by his daughter, ignored by his wife and is
"expendable" at work. His wife, Carolyn (Anette Bening) is so perfect that
her garden shears are coordinated with her footwear. She is a successful
real state agent, happy and content -- or so it seems. Actually Carolyn is a
neurotic woman, unsuccessful in work and family. She has simply forgotten
what it is to feel alive. His daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) is a lonely and
unhappy girl that lives in a certain apathy, longing to leave home. Her
friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) is the blond beauty that is the school's main
attraction. A girl that is dreaming o becoming a model. Her motto is "There
is nothing worse than being ordinary". The truth is that she has never dated
a single boy and her love affairs have been fiction and lies that she used
to seem attractive and unordinary. Those are the main characters, but there
are others that add color and meaning to the story. There is an ex-Marine
officer (Chris Cooper) that collects nazi stuff and has some radical
thoughts about gays. He is a tuff, angry, almost sadistic man that tests
tests his son, Ricky (Wes Bentley ) for drugs, taking a urine sample every
six months and beating the shit out of him for no obvious reasons. In the
end it becomes clear that he is gay himself. Ricky is the good and polite
son at home, but spends his time to change jobs and selling drugs and
basically any whatever his "clients" wish for.</P>
<P>What starts as parallel stories soon float into each other, creating a web
of misunderstandings that are nothing less than bizarre. Lester is
unwillingly dragged along by his wife to see his daughter perform as a
cheerleader. And it is here he sees his angel, his key to instant bliss and
happiness, the only thing that makes him feel alive. The only trouble is
that she is Angela. There are so many events that it is impossible and
unnecessary to sum them up, they have to be experienced. The film ends with
a finale that is so intense and powerful that it is simply unforgettable.</P>
<P>"American Beauty" is not only a Lolita-kind of story. It is a tale about a
man waking up after 30 years of apathy and numbness, thinking about what
happened to your life.  It is a man that wants to bring some of his dreams,
hopes and fantasies to life - a simple wish to live again, to feel alive.
Off course there is more to it. It is basically a story about or society --
under the facade of obvious happiness and success, hides a different
reality. It is about the fact that image and success mean everything, and
are worth sacrificing your own identity and happiness. What we are trying to
hide is our humanity -- our true feelings, our actual thoughts and dreams --
the very things that make us human.</P>
<P>This theme is rather familiar and parallels to films as "Fight Club" and
"Eyes Wide Shut" can be drawn. Like "Fight Club", "American Beauty"
gracefully balances between tragic drama and amusing comedy, never becoming
boring or sentimental -- a kind of feeling like laughing through tears. Both
films are brilliantly written and spectacularly acted and both present our
society in a rather bad light. So it almost seems that they are equal, but
not quite. David Fincher's description of society is sharper, darker, deeper
and far more controversial, because of its unique style and daring story.
Sam Mendes doesn't go that far and he doesn't break any barriers or open new
doors. "Fight lub" didn't only capture the three dimentionality  and essence
of the problem, but provided also the consequences of our actions and
showing us the path towards which we are heading. Mendes doesn't do that. He
is simply scratching the surface and never goes as deep as Fincher. That is
why "American Beauty" will be popular at the Academy Awards, and "Fight
Club" will not.</P>
<P>Acting (as I've mentioned at least a hundred times) is wonderful. This may
be Kevin Spacy's finest, most colorful and mature performance. A natural and
intelligent approach that simply strengthens the film. Likewise is Anette
Bening. A rather unexpected depth and understanding that she portrays in
such an easy manner, that it is simply a joy to watch. The other cast
members are weaker, but still amazing. Especially Wes Bentley as the
romantic, dreamy young man that sees outstanding beauty in everything. I am
confident that a bright future in Hollywood awaits this promising, young
actor. The technical side of the film is likewise perfect. A brilliant
cinematography, magnificent editing and a stimulating musical score wrap the
whole thing up into an unforgettable and fascinating film that deserves both
attention and appreciation.</P>
