<PRE>                        LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     For me, Australia will always be the land of koalas, beautiful
beaches, twangy "English" accents, and delightful romantic comedies.
But I guess, every rule is made to be broken.  After being charmed by
two recent movie imports from Down Under, ALL MEN ARE LIARS and HOTEL
DE LOVE, I went into LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES expecting to see
another fun Aussie independent film.</P>
<P>     While not a bad film, LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES suffers from
terminal triviality.  Insubstantial films, SIRENS for example, can be
deliciously enjoyable if done with enough imagination and wit, but LOVE
AND OTHER CATASTROPHES is like a fluffy meringue without any taste.</P>
<P>     First-time screenwriters Helen Bandis, Yael Bergman, and Emma-Kate
Croghan tackle the problem of a large cast of leading characters by
making them out of interchangeable parts.  Since the characters and
their demeanors are remarkably similar, the writers are able to assign
pieces of dialog almost round-robin style among the characters.  To
continue this modularity, various characters profess to being asexual,
bisexual, homosexual, and heterosexual, thus providing an easy
Tinkertoy approach to building the script.</P>
<P>     Printed quotes from recognized sources are used as scene
transitions in an attempt to ameliorate the lack of adequate character
development.  ("Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it."  --
Lewis Carroll.  "Always make the audience suffer as much as possible."
-- Alfred Hitchcock.)  At other times, the characters will leap from
their normal, mindless banter into a pseudo-intellectualism in hopes of
obtaining the heretofore missing laughs.  ("Now that I realize I've
been suffering from a simple psychotic depression, I feel empowered,"
Mia (Frances O'Connor) in a revelation tells her therapist.)</P>
<P>     LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES happens at a college campus in
Australia.  Two stories are developed to advance the minimal
slice-of-life plot.  In one, a premed student named Michael (Matt Day)
tries desperately to find a new room after fleeing from his
life-is-a-party roommates.  In the other, Mia fights the college
bureaucracy in her quest to change majors.</P>
<P>     Most of the show is as exciting as white bread.  The movie's
population consists of excessively pleasant people who in addition to
Michael and Mia also includes Suzi Dougherty as Savita, Matthew
Dyktynski as Ari, Alice Garner as Alice, Adrian Martin as Adrian, and
Radha Mitchell as Danni. Only Professor Leach (Kym Gyngell),
representing the establishment, possesses an evil bone in his body.
Although there is a gross scene of a man, listed as "Vomit Man" in the
credits, throwing up in a sink while Michael brushes his teeth, the
film strives hard never to offend or take any risks.</P>
<P>     The upbeat and lyrical songs reminded me of those from THE
GRADUATE.  I rarely notice the songs, and when I do, it probably means
I am getting bored, which I was.  The print we saw had major problems.
The colors looked liked washed out sepia, and the backgrounds were
overexposed.  Some of the soundtrack had a problem too.  Whether this
is endemic to all of the prints, I have no idea.  The choppy editing by
Ken Sallows reminded me of a print that had been spliced together too
often and small parts were now missing.  The net result was that it
felt like a 60s film that was being rereleased without any restoration.</P>
<P>     As a film critic, I see just about every film that gets a US
distributor and some that never do.  I, for one, am growing tired of
seeing college students where everyone drinks and smokes dope.  Surely
there are some who abstain from these substances.  Never in a college
age film, do I see anyone who says a simple, "no thanks, I don't do
that stuff."  I am not looking for a big statement, just a recognition
that not everyone thinks its cool to get drunk and stoned.</P>
<P>     LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES runs an amazingly short 1:16, but I
bet you will think it feels longer.  It is rated R for sex, profanity
and some drug use.  It would be fine for older teenagers.  Flaws and
all, the film does a least have an upbeat spirit.  Still, it never
engaged me enough to be able to recommend it.  I give a generous **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
