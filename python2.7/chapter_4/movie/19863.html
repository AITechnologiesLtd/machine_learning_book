<P>In Suburbia, circa 1973, however, most of the principals in "The Ice
Storm" seem content to follow the lyrics of the Hombres' hit and "let
it all hang out." Even the young reverend attends a local swingers'
party, noting (via a scary metaphor) that "sometimes the shepherd
needs the company of the sheep."</P>
<P>Everyone who wants company seems to find it. Ben Hood (Kevin
Kline) carries on a dead-end affair with neighbor Jane (Sigourney
Weaver), the quintessential bored housewife, who rejects Ben's
attempts at afterglow intimacy. "I have a husband," she snaps. "I
don't particularly feel the need for another." Ben's teenage daughter
Wendy (the brilliant Christina Ricci, a long way from "Casper" and
"That Darn Cat") makes time with both of Jane's sons, the overly
sensitive Mikey (Elijah Wood) and the twisted Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd),
a budding psycho who graduates from blowing up toy planes to savaging
rose bushes with a whip. Even Ben's wife Elena (Joan Allen), after a
failed attempt to release her pent-up sexual tension through
shoplifting, begins looking for a more satisfying outlet.</P>
<P>The irony, of course, is that even though there's plenty of
physical togetherness, emotionally everyone is on their own
channel. And, often it seems as if director Ang Lee is purposely
keeping these needy characters at arm's length as well, and his
frequent cutaways to shots of ice cubes, ice cube trays and ice
buckets are not exactly the most subtle way to let us know what he
thinks of the residents of New Canaan.</P>
<P>But "The Ice Storm" is most effective at capturing the
desperately hip attitude that seemed to hang like incense smoke around
upper-middle-class/lower-middle-age adults in the early years of the
Me Decade. From the huge Peter Pan collars that sprout from the shirts
of the men to bedside copies of "Watership Down" and "When She Was
Good," Lee's film is a catalogue of scary '70's trendiness, and it
climaxes with a wife-swapping "key party" ("one of those California
things," a participant notes, excitedly) that today seems as peculiar
as an Aztec ceremony. Somehow in the wake of AIDS, it's easier to
relate to the sexually repressive atmosphere of "The Wings of the
Dove" than the wildly self-indulgent free-for-alls of "The Ice Storm."
