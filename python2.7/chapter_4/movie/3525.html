<P>    This is a charming movie about the young actress Mercedes (Rosie
Perez) making a living as a "taxi-dancer" (dancing with the customers
for money) in Nick's (Steven Randazzo) Dance Club.  At the same time she
is desperately fighting for just a little part in a Hollywood
production, that will get her recognized and eventually famous.</P>
<P>    Her lover is the former TV-star Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel)
but he doesn't support her all that much in fulfilling her ambition.
Instead she throws herself in the arms of Ernesto, a Mexican admirer she
meet at Nick's Dance Club.  This relationship develops into a strange
love affair, where Ernesto declare his love to her by tattooing her name
all across his chest.  But Mercedes can not leave Harry, but he still
refuses to leave his wife and see his life develop in the right
direction after he has been offered to play a part in a new Tarzan
movie.  This is where we see the famous scene where Harvey Keitel is
reciting Shakespeare, wearing only leopard-pants.</P>
<P>    Mercedes want to get out, but need a large sum of money, so she
can leave the city and fulfill her dream.  Ernesto take contact to
Emillio, a shady gangster (Anthony Quinn) who will give him the money
but in return he must assassin one Emillio's enemies, with fatal
consequences for Ernesto.</P>
<P>    This is the second move from Alexandre Rockwells, and the
captivating atmosphere found in the former IN THE SOUP (1992) has
been preserved, even though the budget for this movie is somewhat
larger.  This is a great movie and Rosie Perez, Harvey Keitel play their
parts astounding, and Quentin Tarantino has a small part playing the
Bartender in one of the scenes, making one of his notorious speeches
(like in SLEEP WITH ME)</P>
