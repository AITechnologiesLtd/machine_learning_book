<PRE>                              DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
                        A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
                         Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>        You know you're in big trouble when halfway through a movie you ask
yourself, "What would be better?  Sitting through the rest of this
garbage or receiving a scratch to the retina?"  Ultimately, the question
is moot, since both are examples of ocular mayhem.</P>
<P>        The impulse as you sit through Dungeons & Dragons is to close your
eyes, thereby shielding yourself from those atrocious computer-generated
zooming up and down gaudily-colored castles and cloud-capped palaces. 
Unfortunately, the sound design is so brutal with those sharp rings as
swords clash, glitter dust swirls, and magic spells go WHOOSH that sleep
is not a viable option.</P>
<P>        Consider just this small aspect of the film: Why is it that the main
characters are dressed like Tolkein's rangers but sound like The Real
World, some gaudy hybrid of Conan the Barbarian and Star Wars: Episode
I?</P>
<P>        Indeed, it's nearly impossible to look at the young Empress Savina
(Thora Birch, American Beauty) without thinking about Natalie Portman's
headdress.  Say what you will about the George Lucas film, Portman did
manage to appear regal.  Birch, on the other hand, comes off as a
bubble-headed Valley Girl whose glib talk of equality for everyone would
fit comfortably on the stage of a high school beauty contest.</P>
<P>        In our opening tracking shot across the sea, while dragons fly
underfoot, we hear a ponderous voice-over throwing out strange names and
places.  We haven't been introduced to anyone yet, and I defy the viewer
to make sense of it.  What we do get is this: The Mages are attempting
to overthrow the Empire of Izmer, while the commoners struggle for equal
rights.  Profion (former Academy Award winner Jeremy Irons) seeks the
scepter to control the power of the Golden Dragons, but we also learn of
an equally powerful rod which unites the Red Dragons.  Are you with me
so far?  There's a quiz afterwards.</P>
<P>        It's around this time that we meet the two young thieves, Ridley
(Justin Whalin) and his silly black sidekick, Step 'n' Fetchit (Marlon
Wayans, Requiem for a Dream).  Actually, the Wayans character is called
Snails, who will sacrifice anything, even his life if need be, to save
Massah.  Spike Lee would have a field day with Wayans' bug-eyed
performance.  Of course, Wayans is bringing it on himself -- he's
clearly set up as the white man's burden and is handled as such.  His
final scene nails the coffin shut on my case.</P>
<P>        Ridley and Snails sneak into the inner sanctum of a wizard who has some
sort of secret scroll (another prop) that the bad guys are after.  As
the good guys set off on their adventure, they team up with a young
magician (Zoe McLellan) who never actually uses her magic -- she's too
busy waiting for the boys to rescue her.  Since Jeremy Irons only wants
to pick up his paycheck for this film, he sends the sinister Damodar
(Bruce Payne) in hot pursuit.</P>
<P>        Together, the thieves, the young magician, and a few other trusty
sidekicks run through a series of hoops, with the crazy kids wandering
through forests and towns, thieves' mazes, and enemy castles.  To keep
things entertaining, they never let up on their sarcastic repartee,
slapping each other high-fives.  Meanwhile, Snails ponders the immortal
question, "Massah, why do you always get to save the girl while I go
after the dwarf?"  Riddle me that, Batman!</P>
<P>        The sorry excuse for a plot builds up to an elaborate, if
incomprehensible, dragon war.  Buildings are smashed, swords are drawn,
and the sky runs red with blood (actually, computer generated clouds
that might have been swell in Tomb Raider but won't be fooling anyone
here).  Jeremy Irons gets to stand at the top of a tower cackling,
contorting his face, and, ultimately, destroying his career with such
aplomb that I wonder when he'll work in this town again.</P>
<P>        Is there anything good which can be said about Dungeons & Dragons? 
Fans of the role-playing game will be distressed as they see their
beloved world contorted into a travesty.  Those who loved the Saturday
morning cartoon will wonder why the filmmakers didn't simply use that
cute, kid-friendly story as source material.</P>
<P>        Everyone else out there is on their own.  Just pretend this review is a
large iron gate where, written large, are the words Abandon Hope, All Ye
Who Enter Here.</P>
<P>        POSTSCRIPT: There is one good thing I can say about the film, which
perhaps will be of little interest to anyone who never saw the wonderful
British sci-fi show, Doctor Who.  My boyhood hero, Tom Baker, who played
the good doctor throughout the '70s, makes a cameo appearance in D&D as
the Lord of the Elves.  It made me feel good to know that he is still
getting work.</P>
