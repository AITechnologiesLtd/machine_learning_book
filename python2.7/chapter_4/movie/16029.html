<PRE>                            THE MUPPET MOVIE
                      A movie review by Joe Barlow
                           (c) Copyright 1999</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Charles Durning, Austin Pendleton, Scott Walker, and the

DIRECTOR:  James Frawley
WRITERS:   Jack Burns, Jerry Juhl
RATED:     G
YEAR:      1979
SEEN AT:   Northgate Theater in Durham NC (1979)... and
                countless times on video since then</PRE>
<PRE>                RATING: **** (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<PRE>     "A bear in his natural habitat... a Studebaker."
                ---Fozzie Bear, "The Muppet Movie"</PRE>
<P>        What do you get if you cross a bug-eyed, banjo-strummin' frog,
a wisecracking bear, a love-struck pig with delusions of grandeur,
Steve Martin (in disturbingly short pants), Orson Welles, a brilliant
script, astonishingly catchy music, and cinematography that
occasionally borders on magic?  Well, in this state you'd probably get
arrested... but that's okay, because you'd also get one of the most
charming and endearing films to claw its way out of the dreck of the
'70s.</P>
<P>        The continuing appeal of "The Muppet Movie" is difficult to
describe, but not hard to understand after you've seen it.  In a
nutshell: it's a fun film, skillfully crafted, featuring some of
cinema's loveliest melodies (both the musical score and its lovely
signature tune, "Rainbow Connection," were nominated for Oscars.
Neither won, but the soundtrack is still in print.)  But simply being
"fun" doesn't necessarily equate with "greatness," and it's not the
only reason for the film's continued popularity.  It touches a nerve
with viewers.  Its simple message ('Believe in yourself, and nothing
is beyond your reach') is one we all want to believe... and in the
hectic '90s, with weekly political scandals and perpetual conflict in
the Middle East, we could all use some quality time with the Muppets.</P>
<P>        Kermit the Frog (voiced by the late Jim Henson) is a simple
fellow.  He lives in a swamp, and passes the time by singing songs
on his trusty banjo, yet somehow he feels unfulfilled.  A passing
fisherman (Dom DeLuise), who moonlights as a Hollywood agent,
encourages the talented frog to consider a career in show business.
Kermit is still hesitant... until the agent mentions that Kermit's
talent could entertain millions of people.  Wanting nothing more than
to share his gifts with the world, Kermit sets off for Hollywood (by
bicycle, no less!  The sight is a visual marvel!) to seek his fortune.
Along the way, he meets a number of other friends, all of whom have
the same dream.  The most significant of these are the amiable Fozzie
Bear (voiced by Frank Oz), whose dream of being a stand-up comic is
not at all hindered by the fact that his act isn't the least bit
funny; the lovely Miss Piggy (also voiced by Oz), who falls hard for
the dapper Kermit; and the strange turkey-like Gonzo (voiced by Dave
Goelz) a plumber who dreams of being... well, a plumber.  But having
nothing better to do, he tags along for the ride.</P>
<P>        And what a ride it is!  "The Muppet Movie" is not just another
90-minute kiddie flick, like so many of today's so-called "family"
films.  No, this one is the real thing: a warm comedy, with a message
that actually says something significant to its audience; as such, it
can be enjoyed by parents and kids alike.  As with their spiritual
ancestors, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Muppets' humor is sophisticated
enough to offer smiles and laughs to all ages.  Kids will laugh at
Gonzo's physical stunts, while Mom and Dad will smile at the clever
verbal jokes and visual gags that sail right over Junior's head (the
piano player who looks just like Elton John, the recurring "hare
krishna" gag, etc).</P>
<P>        In many ways, "The Muppet Movie" resembles the 1939 Judy
Garland classic, "The Wizard of Oz": a lowly hero is on a quest to
reach a far away place, and joins up with new friends along the way
who share the same goal.  Both films are full of bright colors, music,
and a message that one can never hear too often.  (Wizard's "You've
always had the power to go home" moral is perfectly in-tune with "The
Muppet Movie's" own sermon.)</P>
<P>        One of the reasons that it all works so well is the fact that
director Frawley and screenwriters Burns and Juhl treated the material
with respect.  The fact that our main characters are colorful,
fabric-covered puppets is incidental.  With only minor modifications,
the same script could've worked just as well with real people playing
all the parts.  That's the secret of the movie's success: it's not
just a good children's movie... it's a good MOVIE, period.  The pacing
is as tight as any "adult" feature: each scene takes place in a new
town, with a new adventure on the horizon for our heroes.  (Who knew
it was so difficult to get from Florida to California?)  Granted,
Kermit has more obstacles to face than the distance which separates
him from his goal: the evil Doc Hopper (a fun performance by Charles
Durning) and his assistant Max (Austin Pendleton) are pursuing Kermit
every step of the way, trying to force him into being the spokesfrog
for Hopper's chain of French Fried Frog Leg restaurants.  When Kermit
resists, a professional frog killer (Scott Walker) is brought in to
dispose of our little green friend.  But again, director Frawley has
used these characters as incentive to keep the pace flowing smoothly:
Kermit and his friends have to keep moving; otherwise, they'll be
captured.</P>
<P>        Cameos by nearly every celebrity you can think of are in this
movie, though children of the '90s are unlikely to recognize Bob Hope,
Edgar Bergen, Madeline Kahn and others.  But that's okay: adults will
get the joke, and the guest appearances never feel gratuitous or
intrusive.  My favorites: Richard Pryor's friendly balloon salesman,
and, at the opposite end of the spectrum, Steve Martin's wonderfully
rude, abusive waiter:</P>
<PRE>        Kermit: "You may serve us now."
        Martin: <dripping sarcasm> "Oh, *may* I?"</PRE>
<P>        I first saw this film in 1979, at age six.  Watching it now,
twenty years later, I'm astonished by how little of the fairy dust has
faded from that initial viewing experience.  The music is still
haunting ("Moving Right Along" will stay in your head for days), the
characters are still utterly charming, and time hasn't dulled the
sparkle of the dialogue one iota:</P>
<PRE>        Fozzie: "If I'm not funny, I won't be able to live with
                     myself."
        Dr. Honeydew: "Well, you'll have to get another apartment,
                     won't you?"</PRE>
<P>        Whether you're five or 50, everyone should see "The Muppet
Movie" at least once.  For 97 minutes, you'll be five years old again,
caught up in the magic of what movies can do.  Four stars, Mr. Henson.
Thank you very much.</P>
