<P>        In a summer full of overlong epics like ``Armageddon'' and
``The Mask of Zorro,'' a modest quickie like ``Halloween H20: Twenty
Years Later'' seems refreshingly unpretentious, even though it takes
almost as long to pronounce that unwieldly title as it does to watch
the movie. But here's a case in which brevity is something of a
handicap.</P>
<P>  There are some intriguing issues bubbling just below the
blood-spattered surface of ``H20,'' which brings Jamie Lee Curtis of
the original two ``Halloween'' movies to restore some much-needed
class to the slasher-flick genre, but the film's 85-minute running
time leaves scores of irritating unanswered questions and unresolved
issues.</P>
<P>  All right, no one buying a ticket for ``H20'' is going in
expecting an insightful study of human nature, but much of the movie's
first hour devotes itself to detailing the disturbing, fragile bond
between Curtis' character Laurie Strode and her 17-year-old son John
(Josh Hartnett).</P>
<P>  Still traumatized from her violent brushes with her
psychotic brother Michael Myers, Laurie now lives under the alias of
Keri Tate and oversees Hillcrest, an exclusive prep school. She's
referred to by John as a ``functioning alcoholic,'' which apparently
means she can pound glasses of chardonnay at lunch, down a
triple-vodka at dinner and still have the energy to harangue
Hillcrest's useless security guard (LL Cool J).</P>
<P>  Director Steve Miner, whose previous films include the
clever sleeper ``Warlock,'' manages to sustain a fair level of tension
as Laurie's drink-induced hallucinations of Michael give way to the
all-too-real thing, the chalky-faced killing machine who shows up at
school while the kids are away on a Halloween field trip. While family
counseling might have worked wonders for other siblings in similar
situations, Laurie and Michael prefer to resolve their differences
with big knives, heavy machinery and the always-reliable fireman's ax.</P>
<P>  Curtis is both ``H20' ''s trump card and its biggest
problem, the trouble being that she does such a fine job of
illuminating Laurie's hollow shell of a life that we can't help but
want to know more about her and how she's managed to keep it together
for as long as she has. There's considerably more attention paid to
characterization here than one would expect in a horror film, and that
may cause ``H20'' to seem slightly sluggish to fans raised on the
high-energy, hip wit of the ``Scream'' movies.</P>
