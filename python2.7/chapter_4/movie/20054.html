<P>As a remake of the French play Les Liasons Dangereuses, Cruel Intentions
is a re-decorated and distinctly teen-orientated update that introduces
younger viewers to a familiar story. The lead roles, inhabited by Glenn
Close and John Malkovich in 1988's Dangerous Liasons, have been taken
over by good-looking representatives of the Gen-X acting crowd. And
despite the fact that Cruel Intentions may appear as a hackneyed and
laughably pretentious piece of work, it only exists to be good, trashy
fun. And that it is.</P>
<P>Judging by the amount of sarcasm displayed by one character, this film
could easily be labeled a dark comedy. It has shades of romance, but the
overall vibe a viewer would get from watching this is not necessarily a
pleasant one. This film is about revenge, deceit, and making people
miserable. Most of the treachery is committed by Katherine (Sarah
Michelle Gellar), a prep school president and (*ahem*) bitch
extraordinare. Katherine and her step-brother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe)
have this sick game they play, in which they bet on which new and
unexpecting virgin they can seduce. But things get too easy for
Sebastian. He gets bored with the job rather quickly.</P>
<P>And so, he attempts to raise his standards. His new subject is a pretty
rich girl named Annette (Reese Witherspoon), who has vowed to remain a
virgin until she first experiences genuine love. Sebastian has high
optimism that he can sucker her in, and with a hot bet proposed that
puts his car against something even more desirable, he just can't afford
to lose. But on a second inspection, Annette turns out to be more
strong-willed than Sebastian anticipated. While trying desperately to
win her over, he begins to actually fall in love with the girl. His once
fool-proof plan has back-fired on him.</P>
<P>The first hour of Cruel Intentions is pure, devilish fun. Well-deserving
people are stabbed in the back, and we revel in all the mockery. It also
introduces a new, naive student named Cecile (Selma Blair), whom
director Roger Kumble uses for much of the comic relief. In one of the
film's more enlightening scenes, Katherine shows Cecile what it feels
like to `get to first base'. She then becomes an object of Sebastian's
desire, but with all her incessant whining and her immature attitude,
she just annoys him to death.</P>
<P>There is quite a bit of sexual content in this film, but most of it is
implied in very detailed conversations. Little is shown on-screen. In
the two lead roles, Phillippe and Gellar perform past our expectations,
each displaying a whimsical sense of self-confidence and sarcastic bite.
Gellar does such an impressive job with the malicious Katherine that I
began wishing she'd get hit by a semi, or some other large moving
vehicle that would kill her instantly. Reese Witherspoon shows us how
her undisputed charm can lighten up a movie even of this dark caliber.</P>
<P>Sooner or later, Cruel Intentions becomes drowned out in seriousness,
but the transition is well-staged. Phillippe and Witherspoon have
believable chemistry, mostly based on his frustration, and the romance
is harsh but believable. But, I did enjoy the first half with greater
viewing pleasure, because it was dastardly good fun. Bearing some
resemblance to Wild Things, Cruel Intentions has some obvious trashy
elements that are swept under the carpet in favor of plotting. Director
Kumble has successfully revised an old story to fit the demanding
standards of the 90's, but he has maintained the basic plot structure in
doing so. This film is cheap and offensive, but if it happens to catch
you in the right mood, you should indulge in this mindless garbage.</P>
