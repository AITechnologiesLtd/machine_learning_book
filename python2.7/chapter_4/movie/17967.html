Susan Granger's review of "ELECTION" (Paramount Pictures)</PRE>
<P>The appeal of this intelligent, witty social and political
satire should extend far beyond the teenage years. It's classified as
a "high school flick" because virtually all the characters are
students or teachers, but its sly intrigue should appeal to a
sophisticated young adult audience. Set in Nebraska at George
Washington Carver High, the story revolves around an aggressive and
loathsome young woman, Reese Witherspoon, who is running, unopposed,
for president of the student government. She's a cocky, irritating
over-achiever with a sizable chip on her shoulder, cast in the mold of
Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Matthew Broderick, as a popular
faculty advisor, is so alarmed by her brazen determination that he
convinces a gentle but dumb super-jock (Chris Klein) to run against
her. Their rivalry becomes even more complicated when the jock's
younger sister (Jessica Campbell), a sophomore, declares her
candidacy, based on a promise to do nothing as student president but
abolish the idiocy of student government. It's a platform that seems
to have great appeal. Written by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, and
directed by Alexander Payne ("Citizen Ruth"), the theme is profound
cynicism about today's democratic process in which someone must be
ruthlessly ambitious, not to mention hypocritical, in order to win
votes and attain public office. Add to that a disdain for the state of
love, sex, and marriage in the '90s and you have a subversive,
wickedly clever premise which is fully realized by the artful
casting. Both Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick are completely
believable in their parts, as are Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell. To
me, this comedy rings with malevolent teenage truth. On the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Election" scores an audacious, acerbic
8. It's a winner.</P>
