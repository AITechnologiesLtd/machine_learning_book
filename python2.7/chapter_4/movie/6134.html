<P>The appealing, sure-footed debut of Tom Hanks as writer and director takes
us on a trip that follows the quick rise and disbanding of a rock group
from Erie, PA. It's a sweet picture that is in keeping with the movie
persona of Tom Hanks, though not necessarily with his role in this work.</P>
<P>It is February 1967, when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show and
revolutionized pop music. Guy (Tom Everett Scott), far more devoted to his
drums than to humdrum work in his father's appliance store, is recruited by
a garage-band for a one-night gig as replacement for the member who broke
an arm. They play "That Thing You Do," composed by guitarist Jimmy. Guy's
vigorous beat  is a decisive factor in making the group win first prize.</P>
<P>The One-Ders foursome have a fifth member who is no fifth wheel.  Jimmy's
cahrming girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler) is always around, helping
enthusiascticcally, while bimboesque blonde Tina, Guy's girl, is more
concerned with her looks than with the band. Later, smitten with her
hunkish new dentist she will part from Guy. She is played by Charlize
Theron, unrecognizable from her very different role as the Norwegian
accolyte in "2 Days in the Valley."</P>
<P>The band goes on to local fame, gets more provincial celebrity after
stranger Phil Horace, a small-time promoter, becomes their manager and puts
their signature song on the radio. Then, realizing that he did all he
could, Phil passes them on to Mr. White (Hanks) of Play-Tone Records.
Rebaptizing them "The Wonders," Mr. White takes the boys on to bigger and
better things.</P>
<P>That the movie has a slight subject cannot be argued, but this is no big
deal  since Hollywood makes so few think-films, hardly ever  probes into
Big Themes, and, except for special effects, makes pictures (from comedies
to blockbuster actioneers) that are slight in content.</P>
<P>What's interesting about "TTYD" is the accumulation of details that don't
shout at you, that may not even be noticed, yet build up to a very good
debut of Tom Hanks as writer-director.</P>
<P>In no hierarchical order here are some good points scored by Mr. Hanks:</P>
<P>1) The music. The audience takes a nice shower in 60's groove music--not
great but typical and right for the group. Guy's brief jamming with his
idol Del Paxton (a black jazz pianist) is delightful.The title song, much
repeated in different settings, gets increasingly better and more
energetic. The songs are all original (some are by Hanks) and sound like
authentic 60s, not pastiches.</P>
<P>3) The period look of the film. It is well-studied to plunge us into the
mid-60s, from overall ambiance to details of artifacts. The Patterson
Appliance Store is a cunning way to show us refrigerators, stoves, clock
radios, TV sets, rabbit-ears and such. There's minute attention to items
from dresses or "diamond"-studded eyeglass frames. Unlike films that lean
too heavily and colorfully on period recreation, this one handles visuals
discreetly,with no overkill.</P>
<P>4) The smitten audiences. Again, cleverly but not broadly weighed are the
details about them. Note especially the excellently sketched flirtatious
girl early on.</P>
<P>5) Tom Hanks himself. A real pro as the Play-Tone company man and as
manager, he is forceful but not dictatorial, friendly but not gushing, cool
but not cold, knows all about promotion. Calmly, without caricatural
cynicism, he is upfront about his function, which it to make money for
Play-Tone.</P>
<P>6) Un-cliched editing. In their first major appearance, in Pittsburgh, the
band, subject to jitters, falling mike stands and sound-system glitches,
fails in the afternoon performance. It's after this that Mr. White takes
over. He sends them off to the evening session with advice not to get
rattled if they don't do well. We don't see that performance which, in most
films would be included as a small triumph. Instead, the movie says nothing
but cuts to the next concert, in Columbus, Ohio.  Also, the eventual new
twosome of Faye and Guy is not heavily telegraphed.</P>
<P>7) The tour and California. A good montage parallels the Wonders' rise on
the Billboard and carefully dosaged details of the boys' sartorial looks,
self-confidence, character differences, and performances with back-up
singers.</P>
<P>8) Hanks again. He does not try to catch the spotlight but by keeping his
role to exactly what's necessary in relatively little screen-time, he
manages the tour-de-force of being a big, functional presence--and to make
himself quietly likable.</P>
<P>9) The cast. All are good. Guy (who does remind one somewhat of a younger
Hanks) and Jimmy are interestingly handsome. Well sketched bits of
personality and behavior. Jimmy may be the nominal leader of the group, but
it is Guy who has the brains and is in the discreet limelight. Which brings
me to...</P>
<P>10) Ringo's Revenge. Among the Beatles, Ringo Starr was less visible,
adulated and important than the other three. Here it is the drummer who is
central to the band.</P>
<P>11) Liv Tyler. In all her films, from many angles she bears an eerie
resemblance to Ava Gardner, down to a miniscule strabismus that lends
women's faces a touch of dreaminess: Karen Black, Madeleine Stowe,Jane
Greer, etc.</P>
<P>12) The supporting cast and nice touches. In Erie, the first manager may
make you think for a moment that he is out to exploit the group, but he
turns out to be a good guy. At the L.A. hotel, African-Amercian doorman
Lamarr is a humorous, sharp and debonair fellow whose short appearances are
perfect. In the lounge, note the gentle, sly irony when waitress Marguerite
starts telling her life story. Or one of the players who, having joined the
Marines, naively does push-ups before uniformed soldiers. Note also the
Play-Tone boss who is realistically coarse and not exactly pretty in pink.</P>
<P>13) Contrasts. As "artistic" Guy performs, his disapproving father reads
the ad of a rival store: "Telemark. They got barbecue kits for $7.89. Open
Sundays 12 to 6. What kind of world is this when you can't stay with your
family on Sunday!"</P>
<P>There's more, like the movie's good, fast but not hectic pacing.</P>
<P>There's a fantasy side to the film. The young people are very clean-cut,
their milieu seems free of booze, drugs, sex or four-letter words. Faye and
Jimmy have been going together for two-and-a-half years, yet apparently
only kissed a lot. All that adds a 50s tone to a movie set in the 60s,
which may be anachronistic but adds to the film's charm.</P>
