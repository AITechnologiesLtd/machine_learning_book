<PRE>                         THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Ah, the perils of being a billionaire these days.  Million dollar
mergers, on-site tailors, gourmet meals every night... and the thrill of
stealing priceless works of art just to see if you can get away with it.</P>
<P>     If you can relate to this heady premise, you'll love THE THOMAS
CROWN AFFAIR.  A loose remake of the 1968 THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, this
version pits Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo against each other in a game
of cat-and-cat.  Brosnan is Thomas Crown, an uber-wealthy NYC tycoon
with an art fetish.  Russo is Catherine Banning, a semi-rogue insurance
investigator who instantly pegs Crown as the thief when the local Monet
goes missing.</P>
<P>     Crown and Catherine then begin the dance of
you-like-me-don't-you-I-thought-so that the too too rich obviously play
every night.  I don't think it's giving away too much to say there's a
scene in which Russo writhes naked while being doused in gin.</P>
<P>     While Brosnan carries this picture entirely on his shoulders (in
fact, I've never seen Brosnan in anything that wasn't fairly good at
least), it's Russo that weighs down this AFFAIR to an extreme.  From the
get-go, it's obvious that Crown has all the cards over Catherine, and
Brosnan's prowess as an actor similarly leaves Russo in the dust.  And
while Russo's hairstyles have obviously been the subject of much
forethought, she always has on too much makeup and just doesn't look the
part of the femme fatale with her enormous, square jaw.  That the entire
movie is shot in extreme close-up doesn't help matters.</P>
<P>     Russo and a tacky Hollywood ending aside, THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR
is a fun and lively thriller with hardly an explosion to wow you.  And
while the asinine ENTRAPMENT visited this exact same premise earlier
this year, and I mean the *exact* same premise, discerning viewers are
bound to appreciate the intelligence with which this film has been
crafted.</P>
