<PRE>CUBE
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Vincenzo Natali directs this science fiction thriller with an intriguing
premise.  Unfortunately, there's little to Cube besides that premise and
some creative filmmaking techniques.</P>
<P>The plot of Cube seems to have fallen right out of the Twilight Zone.
Six complete strangers (well, there's a seventh...but he's a goner
pre-credits) awaken in a strange place.  They're stuck in a series of
identical cubic rooms.  Each room has a door in the center of each wall,
in the floor and in the ceiling.  Each door leads to another identical
room.  Well, not quite identical...the rooms vary in color and many of
the rooms contain elaborate deathtraps.</P>
<P>Quick to take charge of the situation is Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), a
cop who believes they can conquer the situation with teamwork and strong
leadership.  Rennes (Wayne Robson) has a different idea. He's a master
escape artist, confident he can escape this bizarre prison.</P>
<P>Holloway (Nicky Guadagni) is a bleeding-heart doctor who's wary of
anyone wanting to take charge.  Worth (David Hewlett) seems to know more
than he lets on.  Leaven (Nicole de Boer), a math student, has no idea
why she is here, and Kazan (Andrew Miller) is an autistic man who
doesn't seem to be of any help at all.</P>
<P>Can these six people survive the deathtraps and one another to discover
the purpose of (and escape from) this cube-maze?  Can they survive one
another?</P>
<P>Any film which essentially drops its six actors into a box for its
duration is obviously going to need strong characters and dialog.
Unfortunately, that is exactly what Cube lacks.  The characters are mere
archetypes (including one who inexplicably switches as the film goes
on).  Their interactions are forced and uninteresting. Nicole de Boer
displays a little charisma as the most likable prisoner.  But after the
first hour, even she begins to wear thin.</P>
<P>What are Cube's strengths?  Well, it does have an ingenious set design.
Only one cube-room was actually designed and used to represent the
entire structure.  The special effects are also particularly good (if a
bit gruesome)...you can't tell the film had a shoestring budget.</P>
<P>But an interesting premise and an interesting design can't change the
fact that while watching Cube, you feel like you're in your own
deathtrap cube room.</P>
