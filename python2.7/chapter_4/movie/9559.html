<P>Many North Americans are familiar with CD-ROMs, but not with seedy Roms. In
Europe it's the other way around. Rom is what Gypsies call themselves in
their language (Romany). They slowly migrated westward from northern India
about one thousand years ago. Now they live all over the world but mainly
in Europe, which they reached in the early 14th century.</P>
<P>The Rom refer to all non-gypsies as "gadje," a pejorative word, the way
"barbarian" was used by the Ancient Greeks for all non-Greeks. The "gadje"
have repaid the Rom by despising them as undesirables, thieves and other
nasty things. Of course, a few films have gone to the extreme of
romanticizing the Gypsies. Get a video of a darkened Marlene Dietrich and
Ray Milland falling for her in "Golden Earrings" (it is fun kitsch).</P>
<P>"Latcho" sounds to me like the word for "Good" in Serbo-Croatian and other
languages; "Drom" comes from the Greek "dromos" meaning "road" and was
incorporated into the Romany language."Latcho Drom" is a wish that
literally says "Good Road," i.e. 'have a good trip." In French it was
correctly translated  as  "Bonne Route."  In any case, all versions  are
applicable to the ever-ambulant Gypsies.</P>
<P>Director-writer Tony Gatlif, a citizen of France born in Algeria, is a Rom.
Most of his films are on Gypsy subjects. "Latcho Drom" was followed by
"Mondo" (1996) and "Gadgo Dilo" ("Crazy Stranger) (1997). "Latcho Drom" was
produced by Michele Ray, a famous reporter and the wife of the equally
famous film director Costa-Gavras. (There is an Alexander Gavras listed as
Assistant Director too).</P>
<P>The movie is more theme than subject. Its non-plot couldn't be simpler.
Gatlif's cameras and microphones focus on Gypsy musicians, in Rajastan
(India), Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain, main
stations in the wanderings of the Gypsies. It is beautifully photographed
by Eric Guichard ("Seven Years in Tibet") in 35mm. widescreen, with
superior sound.</P>
<P>Songs range from exuberantly joyous to plaintive. Vocal, instrumental , and
generally with dances, the pieces are quite different from one another. To
a specialized musicologist, there may be common threads running below the
different "numbers," but not to most listeners. The common ground is that
all of the items sound like the ethnic music of the countries they are
performed in. In simple terms, thanks to the Gypsies there's a two-way
traffic: the Rom music has been influenced by that country's music, and the
country's music, by its Gypsies. Much that would have died out of a given
land's musical heritage has been preserved in one form or another by the
Rom tradition.</P>
<P>The opening salvo, in India, features lavishly and ornately dressed women,
a man reciting energetic love poetry, and much else. Unlike documentaries,
there is no commentary, printed on the screen or as voice-over. Nor is
there any dialogue or viewer orientation. Nothing is identified, who the
performers are, what country they are in. What the words mean is only
occasionally subtitled.</P>
<P>Yet the film has impact, grows on you and involves you in odd ways. If
you're expecting what most of us think of as typically gypsy music,
initially you're in for surprises  The Rajastan part sounds Indian but not
quite. It may be somewhat familiar to the few Westerners who have seen
those Indian movies that are so popular in the subcontinent but almost
never reach western theaters. Yet even then, the gypsy sounds feel like
cousins to Indian sounds, not like siblings.</P>
<P>We are then transported, with no transition (as in the rest of the film) to
Egypt, where an ensemble performs an Arabic-sounding, vivacious melody on
love, in Arabic (I could not tell if this was pure or a mixture of Arabic
and Romany), with a ghaziya dancer moving rather sexily.</P>
<P>By the rear wall of a large cafe in Turkey, a teen-ager sings, nicely, a
Turkish-like song.The all-male clientele, with their backs to her, face
raptly the instrumentalists at the opposite end. In the streets Gypsies are
selling things. A man with a telescope sells looks at the sky. I thought of
conjunctivitis.</P>
<P>In Romania comes the shock of recognition as finally the music corresponds
to our notions of gypsy melodies. A solo violinist/singer celebrates - in
Romanian - the new freedom, showering the late dictator Ceaucescu with
insults. He uses a normal bow but alternates with a single horsehair that
draws eerie, fascinating sounds. Then you even meet happy Gypsies, smiling,
swaying, dancing, as  skillful  players (strings, cymbalom, clarinet,
accordion, flute) play for their own people.</P>
<P>A montage of a galloping horse leads to the Iron Horse, the railroad. The
rails speak of deportation (as for the Jews) by the Germans to
extermination camps. In a train car, a duet by, probably, a mother and a
daughter, has as its leitmotif "The whole world hates us -- we're always
being hunted and thrown out "  Discrimination, exclusion, disdain,
persecution are the ovewhelming themes and connecting thread of the various
"serious" pieces.</P>
<P>In  Hungary, the Gypsies use spoons, knives and a metal pot for infectious
rhythm. There, and in Slovakia, the musical territory becomes increasingly
familiar to our ears. In a Central European snowy landscape, barbed wire
and tattooed arms speak of Auschwitz. There's the surreal sight of the
Gypsies "camping out" atop trees. Men sing of wandering and persecution.</P>
<P>>From destitution to near-luxury. In France, the "gitans" have caravans. But
then two locals, one with a hunting gun, make the Gypsies leave their
encampment. In the Camargue (Southern France) where there is an annual
Gypsy Festival, there is terrific guitar and violin jazz a la  Django
Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli. And in Spain, the Gypsies squat in empty
buildings, are evicted by the authorities who brick up doors and windows.
Yet the Gitanos sing, clap and dance for themselves (there's an amazing
boy-singer) with the joys and sorrows of Flamenco.The film concludes with a
threnody about the unwanted. It is sung by a woman on a hill top
overlooking a city's public housing -- "for whites only," I kept thinking.</P>
