<P>     Just when it was starting to look like comedy was plucked, along 
comes the funniest movie of the year to put it back on its perch.  This 
will come as no surprise to fans of Nick Park and Peter Lord, the 
geniuses behind the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit shorts. </P>
<P>     Park and Lord work in claymation, a process so slow and painstaking 
you can't imagine how they can find anything funny.  But oh, do they!  
In their first feature-length film, produced through Dreamworks, they've 
created a hilarious spoof on WWII POW movies like The Great Escape.  But 
you don't have to know the sources - Chicken Run is funny and endearing 
and completely entertaining in its own right.</P>
<P>     The action takes place on the chicken farm of Mr. And Mrs. Tweedy 
(Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson), a grim stalag of barracks where 
chickens must produce or perish.  Some of them take it lying down, but 
not Ginger (Julia Sawalha of TV's AbFab), a plucky little hen with 
escape in her blood.  "So, laying eggs all your life and then getting 
stuffed and roasted, that's good enough for you, is it?" she demands, to 
which another chicken (Jane Horrocks of Little Voice) replies "It's a 
living."</P>
<P>     When the Tweedys install a chicken pot pie machine, things get 
desperate - when out of the sky comes what looks like the answer to 
Ginger's prayers: Rocky the Flying Rooster (Mel Gibson), a refugee from 
a circus who calls himself "The Lone Free Ranger."  She offers to hide 
him if he'll teach them all how to fly.</P>
<P>     What makes Lord and Park's work so great is a deeply wonderful 
sense of humor, both verbal and visual.  It's in the timing, in the 
characters, in the lines, in the lighting and the camera angles and the 
sets and the music (including the R&B classic "Flip, Flop and Fly".)  In 
a world of computerized high-tech, this is basic, and brilliant.</P>
