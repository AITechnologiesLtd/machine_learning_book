<P>Another action/comedy-buddy flick pits Hong Hong sensation Jackie Chan
aside Hollywood's latest Eddie Murphy wannabee Chris Tucker. Director
Brett Ratner, who directed Tucker in his "break-out" comedy, MONEY
TALKS (6/10), helms this melange of the original 48 HOURS (7.5/10) and
the original BEVERLY HILLS COP (8/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
A Hong Kong businessman's daughter is kidnapped for ransom. The FBI
attempts to solve the case, while the Hong Kong man brings in his own
private agent to help (Chan). The FBI wants to keep the new guy out of
their hair, and delegate this task to one of their lowliest LAPD cops
(enter Tucker). Stuck with each other, the unorthodox duo attempt to
solve the case for themselves. Fun and action ensues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Funny movie chopped full of action, lacks an original concept and plot
line, but comes through with hilarious banter from Tucker and fun fight
scenes with Chan. I found this film's main point of interest to be
Chris Tucker's verbal potpourri of mild profanity and humour, but
appreciate the fact that folks who don't enjoy the man's abilities may
be turned off from this film. He reminded me a whole bunch of the young
Eddie Murphy before the fame went to his head...vibrant, original and
voracious for laughs! </P>
<P>Chan is also a great combo for Tucker's motormouth, with his lack of
English pronunciation, swift moves and graceful stuntwork. Chan is
considered the straight man in this film, and works on that level. Some
of his fans may be put off by the fact that he doesn't joke around as
much as his other flicks, but all in all, the duo clicked for me, and
that's what led this film to the recommendation arena. Some low points
include the ho-hum story line, the obvious use of "hip" songs to pad
some retarded scenes, and the lowly, and I do mean lowly, appearance by
Chris Penn as a fat-ass con-man (es tu Penn?). How this man's career
went from RESERVOIR DOGS (9/10) to playing fourth banana in Chan movie,
I'll never know!</P>
<P>Overall, I will suggest this film to all those who appreciate the work
of Chris Tucker (I liked him in most of his films, except FIFTH ELEMENT
(6.5/10), in which I thought his wild animation was terribly out of
place) and Jackie Chan. At the same time, I must say that if you are
not a big fan of either star, and/or if you are looking for an
interesting story line, skip this sucker and go back and rent either
one of the Murphy movies that I mentioned earlier. One more thing, as
per usual at the end of every Chan movie, this film includes goofs
during the credits, which are just as (if not funnier) than most of the
humour in this film. Stay tuned!  </P>
