<PRE>"I have created a monster."
-Mary Shelley, Frankenstein</PRE>
<P>There are only two explanations for why anyone would make Pokemon: The 
First Movie: alien abduction or drugs.</P>
<P>Children were running around, waiting to get in hours before the movie 
started; one parent openly contemplated "How are we going to keep track 
of our kids?" Then the film began and near-deafening levels of applause 
were heard at the very sight of the opening credits. From there it was 
all downhill. Before long, people were walking out and cries of "I want 
to go home" replaced the children's glee. To say that the movie was a 
bomb would not do it justice. The movie was more like a bomb that is 
accidentally dropped at the wrong time over a country's closest ally, 
who just happens to have a massive nuclear arsenal and short temper.</P>
<P>The movie actually begins with a short film meant to introduce the 
audience to the world of Pokemon; a place filled with fictional 
characters, strange powers and human masters. Unfortunately, the film 
appeared to be little more than a fairy tale gone horribly astray. The 
characters' language was absolutely undecipherable and sheer pandemonium 
dominated the moment. The morals displayed for the film's young audience 
were despicable, including scenes where all the characters would point, 
stare and laugh at some poor creature who had fallen down. Worst of all, 
the piece doesn't accomplish its goal. Not only is the audience no 
closer to understanding the world of Pokemon, but the all-important 
first impression sets a negative tone that is constant throughout the 
feature film.</P>
<P>The nadir of all kids' movies this decade has a plot that makes that of 
Mission: Impossible seem self-explanatory. From the little that can be 
gathered, the Pokemon universe is in grave danger. Mew, an extinct 
Pokemon, has been cloned by an evil human and the result is Mewtwo, a 
Pokemon that is absolutely evil and more powerful than any other. The 
creature comes with the standard villain-sized ego, boasting "Behold my 
powers! I am the strongest Pokemon in the world." This creation then 
takes on all other Pokemon in a battle that is haplessly drawn out 
over much of the film's duration.</P>
<P>The production does use some techniques displayed in older, and more 
successful, movies. Gloomy colors and equally dark music act as constant 
tip-offs that evil is approaching. Some sewer scenes wreak of borrowed 
elements from the old Ninja-Turtles television series. A little palm 
communicator appears to be more like something Q would use in a 007 film 
than these annoying little creatures have a right to play around with. 
And the memorable moment in Star Wars, that was tastefully recycled in 
Men in Black, of a bunch of strange looking creatures hanging around 
nonchalantly (Star Wars was in a bar, Men in Black in headquarters), is 
not so tastefully exhibited here.</P>
<P>At the end of the film, Mewtwo suggests to all the other Pokemon 
"Perhaps for you, these events are best forgotten." So be it.</P>
<P>---EDITORIAL CRITICISM OF THE MPAA---</P>
<P>The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated Pokemon: The 
First Movie "G." That is the lowest possible rating and means that the 
film may be seen by anyone and everyone.</P>
<P>Pokemon: The First Movie displays considerable amounts of violence. 
The entire plot is dependant on hand-to-hand style combat. Although 
there is a moral solution to this fighting at film's end, it is too 
little and too late. It must also be pointed out that the numerous 
people who will walk out mid-movie will never receive this anti-violence 
message anyway.</P>
<P>Another film opening this weekend, The Insider, was rated "R". That 
means that anyone under 17 who wishes to see the film must do so with a 
parent or guardian. The Insider is a true story that people read about 
in unrated newspapers a few years ago. The only remotely questionable 
aspect of the movie is foul language.</P>
<P>I guess what the MPAA and its president, Jack Valenti, are trying to say 
is that fighting in a deranged and far-fetched film is okay for everyone 
to see but a real life story with real life language should only be seen 
by adults.</P>
