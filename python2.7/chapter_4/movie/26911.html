<PRE>"Quills"</PRE>
<P>During the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, the infamous Marquis
de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) narrowly avoided an appointment with Madame
Guillotine. Instead of losing his head, the randy aristocrat was given over
to the care of Abbe Coulmier (Joaquim Phoenix), the  head of the Charenton
Asylum for the Insane. The Marquis, whose writings were sexually
inflammatory, produced some of his most notorious works with the unwitting
help of the Abbe and the more than willing help of Madeleine (Kate
Winslet), a smart, inquisitive laundress at the asylum in director Philip
Kaufman's "Quills."</P>
<P>Philip Kaufman doesn't make a lot of movies. He certainly is not known for
his ability to "crank out" films on a quick and regular basis. Instead, the
helmer provides quality, and sometimes groundbreaking work, like the paean
to America's space program, "The Right Stuff," and his controversial, NC-17
(the very first movie rated as such) "Henry & June."
Now, he adapts the play by Doug Wright (who also wrote the screenplay) on
the last, imprisoned years of one of the most famous authors and men of his
time.</P>
<P>Today, the word sadism - which refers to sexual pleasure derived from pain
- draws a picture in our minds of a man who has forsaken propriety for the
satiation of his carnal and prurient pleasures. The Marquis de Sade may
have epitomized the definition of the word that bears his name, but
scripter Wright takes us down a very different path in his examination of a
man who, at the very basis of he accomplished, was the devout proponent for
the freedom of speech and artistic creativity.</P>
<P>We first meet Sade as the guillotine is falling on those hapless folks who
were on the wrong side of the Revolution. The story begins with the Marquis
telling what sounds like a bawdy story of a comely young woman only to have
the action change from lustiness to carnage as the razor sharp blade of the
guillotine snuffs out her life. It's a shocking opening to a film that
proceeds to tell us about the man, Sade, who is compelled to tell his tales
in a way that both shocks and titillates the reader. His unwillingness to
compromise his work causes his imprisonment (in relative luxury) by the
leaders of the revolt. His brief stint of freedom, following the
Revolution, is ended when he is committed to the Charenton Asylum by the
Emperor Napoleon for publishing erotic novels.</P>
<P>Wright's screenplay follows the last years of Sade as the man subverts the
system that imprisons him by secretly spiriting new manuscripts to his
publishers with the help of Madeleine, the laundress. Sade and Madeleine
form a chaste, though laden with sexuality, relationship that allows the
confined aristocrat a distraction from his confinement. Madeleine proves to
be extraordinarily intelligent, learning to read and write from the Abbe,
and using her education to read Sade's 'scripts to the unwashed masses
working at the asylum. (Madeleine is kind of like an 18th century book on
tape.) With her help, and the unknowing cooperation of the naïve Abbe, one
of Sade's most notorious works, Justine, hits the streets, eventually
falling into the hands of Napoleon, who "leafed through the most abominable
book that a depraved imagination ever conceived."</P>
<P>The Emperor's less than kindly attention results in the assignment of Dr.
Antoine Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to act as "advisor" to the Abbe. The
doctor's methods of treatment for "psychiatric" patients crosses the border
to the barbaric, making the viewer wonder who the true sadist is. During
this period, the Abbe is ordered to curb the work coming from Sade's cell
and the cleric begins by removing all the author's quills (hence, the
title), ink and parchment. Not one to be easily stymied in his creativity,
Sade uses chicken bones and red wine as his writing implements and his
sheets as paper to get his stories out to Madeleine. When even these meager
tools re removed, the resourceful Marquis uses bits of broken glass as
pens, his blood for ink and his very clothes for parchment. Besides the
obvious free speech theme of the story, you also get the moral that you
can't keep a good man down.</P>
<P>The acting amongst the three principles - Rush, Winslet and Phoenix - is
superb. There is a triangle of sorts but in a different way than one would
expect. Sade and Madeleine have a teacher/student relationship through most
of the film. It's not that the randy-minded marquis wouldn't like to jump
the pretty laundress's bones, he respects her too much to insult her or
drive her away. Madeleine and the Abbe also have a flirtatious
relationship, but, again, one that remains chaste through to the tragic
end. Sade and Abbe Coulmier strike up a long-term friendship with the
enlightened priest allowing Sade to oversee Charenton's theater as a form
of therapy. Each of the actors puts a convincing spin on their perfs with
Rush standing tallest. Caine's Royer-Collard is the symbol of the
oppression of free expression and isn't allowed beyond the symbolic nature
of the character. The members of the asylum provide an interesting,
sometimes bizarre, backdrop.</P>
<P>The claustrophobic feel of the play is carried to the screen and is
effective in showing the imprisonment of the remarkable marquis. I found it
to be a bit too constrained, not translating to the big screen as well as
other plays turned screenplays, like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
But, this is a minor complaint on a uniformly solid work.</P>
<P>Tech credits are exemplary with production designer Martin Childs lending
his Oscar-winning talents in creating the Marquis's prison as it
deteriorates from comfortable chambers to a bare prison cell. Costuming, by
Jacqueline West, isn't pretty - it does take place in an insane asylum,
after all - but it certainly fits the tone and period of the story.
Newcomer to American film, lenser Rogier Stoffers, captures the
claustrophobic feel of Sade's prison.</P>
<P>Philip Kaufman may not come out with a film but once every several years,
but they are worth waiting for. The quality work in "Quills" is no
exception and worth the effort. You won't get big, flash F/X and explosions
or lines like "I'll be back," but you will get a thought provoking yarn
about a man whose name is in the dictionary. How many people can you say
that about. I give it a B+.</P>
