<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>In this less than routine thriller, the cops and a philanthropist are
the bad guys. Emily (Russell) is an art restorer, currently working in
the Mexican section of L.A. at a church.
The divorced mom gets carjacked with her seven year old son Sam in the
car as she stops for the carjacker who poses as a cop, and when she
exits the car she is wounded, while the thief steals her car with Sam in
it. When the police find the car, Sam is dead and the car incinerated.
The police at first blame it on a Mexican gangbanger, but then find
chemicals she uses in her art restoration as the material used to
destroy the car and go to arrest her for the crime.</P>
<P>The incredulous story gets worst, because when the cops go to her
apartment to arrest her, a Mexican she saw at the church, a former
gangbanger, Reuben Alvarez (Eddie Velez), kidnaps her, as the cops try
to kill both of them but instead one of the cops gets killed by Reuben
in self-defense. Emily now becomes a woman on the run, wanted as a cop
killer. Her aim becomes to find out who killed her son and why, and who
framed her. Reuben turns out to be a good guy, angry that the cops are
blaming Mexican gangs for killing three Mexican kids in the church, when
he knows this wasn't a gang killing.</P>
<P>She goes to her ex-husband John Delaney (Gary Graham), a newspaper
reporter, and borrows his motorcycle to she go undercover, wearing a wig
and trying out a phony Mexican accent to infilitrate one of the vicious
Mexican gangs.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph.</P>
<P>The cops in charge of the investigation, Captain Gibbs (Robinson) and
detective Harris (Crivello), are so obviously corrupt and slimy, and are
now hell-bent on shooting her, that there's no doubt they are into some
scheme. What that scheme is, is uncovered by Emily as she notices a
toxic chemical used only by the army, but is strangely found in the art
she is restoring. She traces the chemical to a company called URI, which
is a philanthropic organization run by the wealthy William Drayton
(Pennock). She finds out about his illegal dumping of the chemical and
that his company was awarded the lucrative army contract to bury it
safely, but he instead is using it to destroy buildings he will then
refurbish for his urban development projects. He uses the police' hatred
of Mexicans to help him coverup his phony philanthropic aims. Poor Emily
was a witness to what they were doing and could eventually point the
finger at them, so this elaborate scheme was cooked up by Drayton and
the police to get rid of her. When confronting them with this info about
killing innocent Mexicans and blaming it on gangs as being insane,
Captain Gibbs replies, "The fewer Mexicans there are, the safer the city
is."</P>
<P>This is a bad film that exploits real issues that are plaguing a
troubled city that has serious problems of racism, crime, and police
corruption. It adds nothing to the situation. Every character was
one-dimensional, the story line was crass, the directing was more suited
for a TV show than a feature film, the acting was stiff, and the
cinematography was unimaginative. I can't think of one thing I liked
about the film.</P>
