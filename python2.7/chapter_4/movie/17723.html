<PRE>TWO GIRLS AND A GUY (M).  
(Twentieth Century Fox)
Director: James Toback
Stars: Robert Downey jr, Heather Graham, Natasha Gregson Wagner
Running time: 97 minutes.</PRE>
<P>The title says it all, really!  This is a film about two girls
and a guy who share an unusual sexual triangle.</P>
<P>Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner, daughter of the late Natalie
Wood) and Carla (Heather Graham, from Boogie Nights, etc) meet outside
a New York apartment building.  They are both waiting for their
boyfriend to return from the airport.  During their discussion, they
both discover that they have been sharing a supposedly monogamous
relationship with the same man - Blake Allen (Robert Downey jr), a
struggling actor.  They break into his apartment and prepare to
surprise Blake.  The ensuing confrontation offers insights into
relationships in the '90's, and questions the concept of honesty
between men and women.</P>
<P>This low budget three-hander talk-fest was shot in a New York
loft apartment over a period of eleven days, and its deliberately
minimalist style gives it the look and feel of a filmed play.  The
action takes place on one set, and centres around the three main
characters questioning the dynamics of their relationships.  The film
begins promisingly enough, but after the first twenty minutes or so it
seems to run out of steam.  From then it struggles to retain the
audience's attention.
 There's the gist of a good short 
film struggling to get out here.  </P>
<P>Many of the scenes seem improvised, and it's almost as if
director James Toback (The Pick-Up Artist, etc) shot the actors
work-shopping their characters through various scenarios.  The fairly
straight forward plot is unbalanced by many other elements that jar
and seem misjudged.  There is an unnecessary sex scene that seems
inspired by 9 And 1/2 Weeks.  The dialogue is gratuitously frank, and
peppered with casual obscenities, but lacks genuine wit.</P>
<P>Then there is Blake's ailing mother, who becomes almost a
fourth character in the drama. Although she is never seen or heard
from, her presence is nonetheless felt, and her character often serves
to diffuse many of the volatile tensions and emotions that surface.
The poignant ending also seems like a desperate contrivance to elicit
some sympathy for Blake, a man behaving very badly.</P>
<P>Downey's performance is sensational, which is not surprising
since writer/director Toback created the role especially for him.
However, Toback fails to provide any sort of definite resolution to
the situation he has established, and most audiences will walk away
feeling disappointed.</P>
