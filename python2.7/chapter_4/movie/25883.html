RATING: 1/10</PRE>
<P>"Nothing more than a high budget masturbation fantasy" </P>
<P>SHOWGIRLS (NC-17) - Contains graphic nudity, profanity, sexual situations and violence. Some people, however, keep their clothes on. </P>
<P>You do not watch porn films for their intellectual values, nor do you
write reviews on them. That's why this review will be short. It seems
that this film will end up in the porn section when it hits the video
stores. There is no story, script, point or acting. Only naked bodies,
which is exactly the point.</P>
<P>Here is the so called plot: Nomi, the 23-year-old with a dark past as
a hooker, has hitchhiked from somewhere back east to perform in a show
where a dancer doesn't wear much more than a light coating of powder
and a big, fake smile. No one is twisting Nomi's arm. No one is
holding her grandmother hostage. She wants to do this. And that is
what she is doing till the end credits. So what's the problem then?
What's the point? What's the film about? Is there anyone whose
aspirations could inspire less sympathy? This film can be described in
one sentence: Obscene level of incompetence, excessive stupidity in
the story line, gross negligence of the viewer's intelligence, a
prurient interest in the quick buck. Believe me, after an hour with
these characters, acting and script, you'll start hoping for someone
to kill somebody.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film,
that is bad even for Eszterhas' script. Her character is the only one
that is at least half written and she could really have done
better. Her character denies the fact that she is a whore for the
industry, selling her body to the hungry eyes of the horny public. "I
am not a whore! I am a dancer", she screams, but does it in such an
over dramatized way that you'll start laughing. In fact the acting in
"Showgirls" brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level. Not
one single achievement, besides the conventional cinematography, is
worth mentioning. It is a total waste of time and money. There is not
a single moment of what you might call intelligence. The dialogue is
structured of ancient stereotypes and cliches lined up one after
another. Its attempt to even imagine to have half a brain results in a
catastrophe. "In my films," writes director Paul Verhoeven ('Basic
Instinct', 'Total Recall'), "I hold the mirror up to life." Well,
excuse me? His attempt to go behind the scenes of Las Vegas, and as he
put it "show the naked truth", is simplified and unreal. Occasionally,
between his collection of mistakes and logical irrationalities,
screenwriter Joe Eszterhas (the creator of some of the worst
screenplays in Hollywood history) inserts some lines of deep morality,
that sound something like this: "Hey, I see you. I see that you're
hiding" - "From what?" - "From you". Yes, and even the only decent
line in this film: "Nomi is what Las Vegas is all about" can't save
'Showgirls' from going under. It's a strange phenomena. It's not
erotic, because it lacks sensuality. Not dramatic, because it lacks
the acting. And not intelligent because it lacks a story. It is simply
Verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography. You want to see naked
women? Bare breasts? Full frontals? It's nothing wrong with that. But
in that case I suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video
store, and not waste time surviving through Eszterhas' pathetic
dialogue.  B qualities, while it's only a high budget porn-film.</P>
