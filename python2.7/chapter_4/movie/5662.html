<PRE>                THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME vs. POCAHONTAS
                       A film review by Jim Maguire
                        Copyright 1996 Jim Maguire</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale
Produced by Don Hahn                </PRE>
<P>Featuring the voices of:
        Tom Hulce, Demi Moore, Jason Alexander, Kevin Kline, Charles 
Kimbrough, Mary Wickes, Tony Jay.</P>
<P>        Victor Hugo's tale THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME was an extremely 
long book - 600 pages- and showed us a lot about poor, evil, and the 
forces that surround all human beings. As they say, everything can be 
turned into Disney. First it was POCAHONTAS, now this. Disney, however, 
has really struck on something big. Although I had various reasons for 
not liking POCAHONTAS, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME has turned around all 
the complaints given by critics.</P>
<P>        First of all, the voices in HUNCHBACK are fresh, and surprisingly 
free. POCAHONTAS, however, is incredulously under-voiced. If the Disney 
animators care about comedy in their features, why don't the animals 
talk. NOTRE DAME has three refreshing gargoyles, voiced by Charles 
Kimbrough, SEINFELD's Jason Alexander, and the late Mary Wickes. </P>
<P>        Second, POCAHONTAS tries to convey emotion in terms of violence, 
sloth, and greed. On a comic note, it has all the seven sins from the 
Morgan Freeman movie SEVEN. HUNCHBACK puts more love in between the two, 
and less anger. Disney has finally realized that the comedy and romance 
is where their stories spring, not the lust.</P>
<P>        Third, and last, POCAHONTAS's songs are incredibly dry; it's the 
first Disney movie that actually had me annoyed from having songs in my 
head. For example, in the song " Mine, Mine, Mine" in POCAHONTAS said 
"mine, mine, mine" so much that I felt like stabbing all the characters 
who sung it. THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, however, had me muttering "the 
bells of notre dame" everywhere I went. </P>
<P>        With beautiful love contrasts between Demi Moore and Tom Hulce ( 
Quasi and Esmeralda,) who wants to have a history lesson???</P>
