<PRE>MORTAL KOMBAAAAT!!!</PRE>
<P>*Bah-buh-bah-bah-buhbuh, bah-buh-bah-bah-bahbuh, bah-bah-bah-buh-bahbuh,
bah-bah-buhbahbuhbuhbah*</P>
<P>Okay, so chances are you've heard that now-famous outcry and the techno
music that follows it, either on commercials for the movies, or the
video games, or on the soundtracks for the games or movies, or in the
movies themselves.  </P>
<P>In this, the sequel to the original MORTAL KOMBAT film, titled MORTAL
KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION, that theme music is still intact, and, just like
the last time, bolts into our ears right from the New Line Cinema logo. 
However, it's almost the only thing that's still around from the first
film.</P>
<P>In order to review MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION, one must have an opinion
of the original, since this essentially just tries to be more of the
same.</P>
<P>Okay.  I truly liked MORTAL KOMBAT.  Yes, I really did.  Maybe the plot
was sort of basic, but it was *fun*.  It was one of the most *fun*
movies of the summer of 1995.  It had some funny dialouge, some
appealing actors (and some not-so-much), some nice effects, plenty of
extremely well-choreographed martial arts battles, and a cool, pumping
soundtrack.  And, of course, it was directed very well by the talented
Paul Anderson, who could have a great career as long as he avoids crap
like EVENT HORIZON from now on.</P>
<P>Now the sequel is upon us.  The martial arts battles aren't as well
choreographed, but they're still pretty good.  Unfortunately, the
directing is nowhere near as good as in the original, and it dilutes the
quality of the fights.  The villian isn't nearly as imposing, many of
the original actors have been replaced for the worse, the effects might
have been impressive in 1992, it's filled with extraneous subplots and
characters, and, well, basically this movie just plain sucks.</P>
<P>Robin Shou is honestly trying here.  You can tell.  He wants this to
really not suck.  Sandra Hess wants to have an acting career, that's
obvious... so it's good news for her that she's better than the original
actress behind Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson).  In fact, she's not bad
at all.  I wouldn't mind horribly if I saw her again... in some other
film, of course.  </P>
<P>Talisa Soto seems sort of bored with this.  She obviously beefed up her
martial arts training, but when she's acting, she's rather stiff, just
like in the original.  Of course, that's Kitana's character for you, I
guess.  As a side note, her sudden romance with Liu Kang is utterly
ludicrous, and has no place here - it's just another piece of excess
baggage for the plot to carry.  The only person putting forth anything
resembeling effort is Litefoot, who plays Nightwolf, at least for the
whopping two minutes that he's on the screen.  This guy deserves
better.  James Remar replaces Christopher Lambert as Rayden, and does a
shoddy job.  Lambert was perfect for this role.  However, Remar isn't
given much to work with here, anyway.</P>
<P>Our villian, Shao Kahn (Brian Thompson) shouts a lot, but that doesn't
mean he's threatening.  Kahn's father is more interesting, but doesn't
do much.</P>
<P>Johnny Cage, the most fun of the characters in the original, is played
by another actor as well (Linden Ashby is having fun doing "Melrose
Place" by now), and is killed in the first five minutes.  This is pure
idiocy at work, people.  There's no reason for his death.  It just opens
up for another comic relief character to appear, Jax, played by Lynn
"Red" Williams, previously known as "Sabre" on American Gladiators.  He
gets a few funny lines, but is no where near as amusing as Johnny Cage
was.  Williams just tries too hard to be Will Smith.  He seems to have
some talent buried in him that briefly shines through here and there,
but overall, it's not really on display here.</P>
<P>Tons of characters show up for no reason, and bring up sub-plots that
have no point.  One example is when Sub-Zero (Keith Cooke) appears.  He
states that the Sub-Zero that Liu Kang killed in the original was his
brother, and that a robot, Smoke, has been reprogrammed to go after
Kang, instead of original target, Sub-Zero himself.  Why was the robot
going after Subbie?  Why was it reprogrammed?  Why did Sub-Zero bother
to save Kang?  Why did he take up the mantle of his brother?  How does
he do those cool ice manuvers?  Why do none of the writers of this movie
care to tell us any of this?  Sub-Zero is off the screen about three
minutes after he appears, and never comes back.  What was the point? 
Other characters, like Rain (Tyrone Wiggins) and Mileena (Dana Hee), pop
up in gaudy costumes and don't even last the three minutes that Sub-Zero
does.  And who honestly cares about the woman that shows up calling
herself Jade (Irina Pantaeva)?  This is worse than the "Street Fighter"
movie's overflow of characters.  What were they thinking?</P>
<P>Considering the advancements in effects since the original KOMBAT, it's
also distressing that the effects in this sequel are rather shoddy.  In
fact, we had some movies that had better CGI effects back in 1992, such
as TERMINATOR 2 and ALIEN 3.  Oh well.  Some things in this movie seemed
to be tossed in just because they allowed the chance for cheesy
effects.  C'mon, did we really need that lame "animality" sub-plot?</P>
<P>At least the soundtrack succeeds in doing what the original's did: it
makes hard rock and techno sound good and fun by setting it to martial
arts battles, and making those genres of music sound good is not a
horribly easy feat.  But still, the original's is better.</P>
<P>Overall, this is just another bad sequel.  It's about on the level of
this year's BATMAN & ROBIN, and that's really a shame.  The whole plot
is a jumble - it's tough to care much about what's going on.  The first
one was fun, but this is just a big mess.  It looks like 1995's MORTAL
KOMBAT remains the only truly *good* video game-based film so far.  The
mistakes here are so obvious.  This should've been better. </P>
<PRE>RATING: D+, or * (one star)</PRE>
