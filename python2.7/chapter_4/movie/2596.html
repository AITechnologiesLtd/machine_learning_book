<PRE>    NO JOHN WAYNE, NO WIG, NO MEMORY: DANA CARVEY GETS A CLEAN SLATE
                                   by
                               Michael Leo</PRE>
<P>     Young people may grow up quickly in today's complicated world, but
still they seem to want pop heroes who are in perpetual childhood.
That's been Dana Carvey's great fortune.</P>
<P>     Acquiring a hefty youth following during his seven years on
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, Carvey combines a parodistic accuracy with a smart
kid's let's-pretend delight in showing off.  It was all part of a
lifelong practice of surviving socially.</P>
<P>     "I was half-shy, half-funny," he says of his tyke-to-teen years.
"I discovered I had an ear and could mimic things when I was 7 years
old--and I could get attention.  And that's how it started.  I was
alternately shy or extroverted all through grade school."</P>
<P>     Though his most popular character has been chronic adolescent
Garth of WAYNE'S WORLD, he's branching into grown-up territory--sort
of.  In his new screen venture, CLEAN SLATE, he takes his cue from
gumshoe movies, stands tall and tries out an adult character--albeit
a funster one.</P>
<P>     Directed by Mick Jackson (THE BODYGUARD), this cloak-and-dagger
comedy casts him as a private detective with memory loss who's due to
testify at an important trial.</P>
<P>     Along the way, he gets snared by a femme fatale (mahogany-voiced
Valeria Golino) and locates a missing coin worth millions.  The hook is
that Carvey keeps losing his bearings while the audience stays way
ahead of him.</P>
<P>     "I thought the script was charming and kind of different," he
says.  "It was like some '40s movie, so it's retro, like some kind of
Danny Kaye-Bob Hope movie.  So I thought, 'I'll give this a shot.'"</P>
<P>     The part he plays doesn't call for mimicry, and Carvey wasn't
interested in doing any.  "That wasn't really the gig--I was just
supporting the story.  I liked the idea that the audience would get
ahead of the character."</P>
<P>     This did not keep him from amusing his fellow workers between
takes with constant caricatures, so much so that Golino says, "After a
while you wanted to say, 'Could I talk to Dana now?'"</P>
<P>     Two of his biggest fans have been his most public targets: Ross
Perot and George Bush, who have both called him up to pal around.</P>
<P>     "I was in the White House, real nervous, having cocktails with
George and Barbara Bush," he says, "and I said, 'Ross Perot is a gift
to comedians everywhere,' and Bush said, 'He wasn't a gift to me.' I
wanted to be sucked into the ventilation system at that point."</P>
<P>     Soon to come are films that may release new forms of deviltry.
Promising in particular is Alan Parker's upcoming adaptation of
T. Coraghessan Boyle's bestseller THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE, in which he
plays an all-out maniac opposite Anthony Hopkins.</P>
<P>     "I get to throw bottles of feces--human excrement--at Sir
Tony's face," he says with satisfaction.  "It's a dark, twisted movie."</P>
<P>     He's also in the middle of the Toronto shoot of It Started In
Paradise, a mafia comedy that casts him as an Italian-American hood
opposite Nicholas Cage.  And there's a completed Hans and Franz script
that may one day be filmed, equipped with a musical part for Arnold
Schwarzenegger.</P>
<P>     "Arnold loved the idea of it.  His favorite line is [and with
automatic ease he assumes Schwarzenegger's wiener-schnitzel baritone]
'I could flick you with my little finger and you would fly across the
room and land in your own baby poop.'"</P>
<P>     Not quite adult talk, but Carvey's juvenilia is infectious.  He
may not be forever young (one day he and Michael J.  Fox may battle to
inherit Mickey Rooney's twinkling geezer roles), but for the moment our
hero is the Earl of Adolescence.</P>
