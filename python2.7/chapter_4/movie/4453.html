<P>     Renny Harlin, whose previous directorial efforts include DIE HARD 2 
and CLIFFHANGER, seems fond of big, explosive action pictures.  
Unfortunately, excepting his debut (the middle film in the DIE HARD 
trilogy), plot coherency hasn't been a particularly important attribute 
of his movies.  CLIFFHANGER was little more than a series of spectacular 
stunts linked together by a paper-thin story.  If anything, the strands 
of logic in CUTTHROAT ISLAND are even thinner.  Fortunately, as a 
spectacle for the eye and ear, this high seas adventure is more than 
capable of capturing its audience's attention.  Holding it for more than 
two hours is a different matter altogether...</P>
<P>     By his own admission, Harlin patterned CUTTHROAT ISLAND loosely 
after CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE SEA HAWK, with his real-life wife, Geena 
Davis, taking the Errol Flynn role.  However, while the special effects 
and explosions here far outstrip Hollywood's early pirate movies, 
storyline, characterization, and acting are vastly inferior.  Thus, 
while CUTTHROAT ISLAND may have cost $70 million to produce, it's still 
a pale shadow of its predecessors.</P>
<P>     The "twist" here, as already mentioned, is that the hero is a 
female.  Davis doesn't plumb her acting skills deeply in this shallow 
portrayal of Morgan Adams, the captain of a pirate ship called the 
"Morning Star."  It's 1668 in the Caribbean, and she's on a treasure 
hunt.  Millions of pounds of gold are reportedly buried somewhere on 
Cutthroat Island, but the map to the treasure location is in three 
separate pieces, and Morgan possesses only one.  Each of the other 
sections is held by her uncles.  While Morgan is willing to make deals 
and share the wealth to put the maps together, her Uncle Dawg (Frank 
Langella) would rather take the more expedient route of killing everyone 
who gets in his way -- including his niece.</P>
<P>     The love interest, Shaw (the male Olivia DeHavilland?), is played 
in typically lackluster fashion by Matthew Modine (replacing Michael 
Douglas, who bowed out at the last moment).  Modine has absolutely no 
chemistry with co-star Davis, and watching these two together is about 
as exciting as sitting through those dumb slideshow commercials that 
precede movies in many theaters.  Frank Langella, who has apparently 
joined Dennis Hopper and James Woods as good foaming-at-the-mouth stock 
villains, does his usual shtick, although he's somehow not all that 
menacing here.  </P>
<P>     CUTTHROAT ISLAND is more entertaining for its dumb storyline and 
overt silliness than for its nearly nonstop action.  Technology plays 
its part in what the film has to offer, as well.  Some of the visuals 
are breathtaking (especially a scene where a pirate ship explodes).  
Sound editing is excellent and the score (written by John Debney and 
performed by the London Symphony Orchestra) is suitably rousing.  
CUTTHROAT ISLAND is a mindless diversion.  If, for whatever reason, you 
decide to go, maintain low expectations.  Hoping for more than a bunch 
of loud bangs and ridiculous dialogue will rob CUTTHROAT ISLAND of its 
amusement value.</P>
