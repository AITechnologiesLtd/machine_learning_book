<P>If there's something Martin Scorsese can always be credited for, it's
getting whatever his subject is portrayed correctly on screen. "GoodFellas"
is considered by many to be the most accurate Mafia film ever made. "Raging
Bull" got inside a boxing ring with striking realism. His 1997 film,
"Kundun," was a meticulously crafted biography of the Dalai Lama. In his
latest film, "Bringing Out the Dead," Scorsese is clearly going for a
somewhat realistic depiction of the life of a New York City paramedic.
Frankly, never having been a paramedic, I don't really know how good it was,
but it was realistic enough for me. Unfortunately, "Bringing Out the Dead"
isn't quite up to par with other Scorsese works. It's mediocre Marty, which
basically means that while it's not the best he can do, it's well above
average when compared to everything else.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage stars as Frank Pierce, a paramedic who works the night shift in
New York's Hell's Kitchen. Frank hasn't been sleeping well. He hasn't saved
anyone for months, and he is constantly haunted by the spirit of a dead
girl, the one that kicked off his "losing streak." The film opens has Frank
and his partner, Larry (John Goodman), take a call for an old man suffering
from a heart attack in his apartment. The old man seems to be a lost cause,
but shows a faint heartbeat at the last minute. This sudden hopeful case
causes Frank to become enamored of the old man's daughter Mary (Patricia
Arquette), despite his colleagues' warnings not to get involved with
patients. The rest of the film shows three nights Frank spends on the job,
with a new partner on each of the following two nights. Marcus (Ving
Rhames), the second partner, is a religious man who takes each assignment as
an opportunity to turn his patients into believers, while Tom (Tom
Sizemore), the third partner, is a sadistic fellow who enjoys his job only
for the chance it affords him to see blood. Frank, meanwhile, spends each
day looking for some kind of redemption for his previous failure.</P>
<P>If the previous paragraph doesn't sound like much of a plot summary, that's
probably because "Bringing Out the Dead" doesn't have much of a plot to
speak of. That's not necessarily a detriment, mind you. This is clearly a
character-driven flick, concentrating on three days in the life of Frank
Pierce. Scorsese provides plenty of his trademark visual flair, which keeps
the proceedings continually interesting, even while the story slows down. We
see New York City as only Martin Scorsese could film it, with the worst kind
of scum imaginable, and Scorsese films them from all angles, in all shades
of color. It's a kind of acid trip, only legal. Like most of this director's
films, this one is always strangely engrossing, the kind of film you can't
take your eyes off of, even if you don't know why.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage seems a little too restrained in his role, one that he probably
should have cut loose in. He seems to spend an awful lot of time staring up
into the camera and looking a little too disinterested. Maybe he's been
ruined by appearing in one too many brainless action movies that didn't
exactly demand much from him as a thespian. I really shouldn't knock Cage,
though. This is definitely his best performance since "Leaving Las Vegas,"
and it's loads better than his impression of a sleepwalker in "8mm." After
all, to see a truly disinterested performance, one need look no further than
Cage's co-star in this film. I don't know what somebody slipped into
Patricia Arquette's drink, but it definitely put her to sleep. Granted, she
has an uncanny ability to resonate innocence and warmth, but far too many of
her scenes felt like line-reading, complete with the random pauses of
someone who sounds like she's reading the script for the first time.
Arquette is certainly better than she was in "Stigmata," but that's not
saying much. The real bright spots of the cast are in the supporting parts.
All three of Cage's partners are perfect in their roles. John Goodman is
laconic and tired as Larry, which is exactly what the character calls for.
Ving Rhames is a hoot as the devout Marcus, who spends the early part of the
night flirting with the dispatcher (voiced by Queen Latifah), and then
treats his assignments as a chance to convert patients to Christianity. A
particularly good scene has him tricking a bunch of Goth rockers into
believing that their friend has been healed by divine intervention, when it
was really just an adrenaline shot from Cage. Tom Sizemore is appropriately
over-the-top as the psychotic Tom Walls. The scene where he attacks his
ambulance as Cage takes off work is priceless. Pop singer Marc Anthony does
a surprising turn as a whacked-out junkie, and does it well.</P>
<P>As is to be expected from Scorsese, the film is often exhilarating, with
symbolism to spare. I particularly liked the allegory of the dying man in
the desert, begging for a glass of water. Frank has had people dying on him
for so long that he just wants to save a life because "it's the greatest
high in the world." There is plenty of wry humor to counterbalance the
seriousness, meaning that "Bringing Out the Dead" is almost always
interesting to watch. There's just something wrong with it, however, that
keeps me from proclaiming it a masterpiece along with Scorsese's greatest
films. I think it has to do with a lack of true focus in Paul Schrader's
screenplay, and with the performances of Cage and Arquette. The film isn't
plot-driven, which is fine if you've got an interesting and well-developed
character. After all, "Taxi Driver" didn't have much of a plot, but Travis
Bickle was one of the most dynamic characters in American cinema. Frank
Pierce just isn't very interesting. There isn't half the character
development we saw in "Taxi Driver" or "Raging Bull" (no Robert De Niro
either, interestingly enough), and Cage doesn't help much with his
good-but-not-great performance. Another problem is the surprising lack of
chemistry between Cage and real-life wife Arquette. Where are De Niro and
Jodie Foster when you need them? I wasn't terribly interested in their
relationship until the final scene which, though a beautiful image, had its
power diluted by the draggy early ones.</P>
<P>Scorsese always has a knack for finding wonderful imagery in every film,
which he does in "Bringing Out the Dead." I loved seeing his vision of how
the ghost of the young girl appears to Cage, the aforementioned final shot,
Cage's hallucination about pulling people out of manholes, and countless
other breathtaking images. Even though he does go a bit overboard with this
when he practically turns Cage into a walking light bulb in the penultimate
sequence, it's not in Scorsese's direction that the major problem lies. The
real problem is a surprisingly lackluster screenplay turned out by Paul
Schrader, who scripted many of Scorsese's better films ("Taxi Driver,"
"Raging Bull," "The Last Temptation of Christ"). There is plenty of clever
dialogue and dark comedy, but little story or character development, and I
can't shake the idea that I just saw "Taxi Driver Lite." Despite these
problems, "Bringing Out the Dead" is still a fascinating film. It may not be
up to Scorsese's usual high standards, but would certainly be an impressive
accomplishment for an artist of lower standing. It's mediocre Marty, but
certainly top-level Schumacher.</P>
