<P>"Fight Club" Review
by Fontaine Lien
WARNING: You do NOT want to know the ending to this movie.  Stop reading
NOW if you have NOT seen the movie yet!</P>
<P>Wow.  Just when I thought all hope was lost for the fall movie season of
1999 (well, I had high hopes for "American Beauty" but my stupid friend
ruined my plans by telling me the ending).  "Fight Club" is a stylish,
testosterone-charged look at the mind of a man gone haywire, complete
with thought-provoking commentaries on modern society.  I'm more
appreciative now than ever that the folks who made the trailer did not
leave any hints as to what the movie was really about; it would have
ruined everything. </P>
<P>It starts with an explosion of sound and neurotransmissions and leads
right into the conclusion of the film, like plunging us all into ice
cold water without forewarning.  Everything else is flashback from
there.  Without wasting any time at all we are introduced to the
character of Jack (Edward Norton), a white-collar yuppie slowly
wasting away due to insomnia.  We're drowning in his poetic narrative
and some of the best dialogue to come out of Brad Pitt in years.  The
scenes are like the ebb and flow of the tide; some are overwhelmingly
powerful and some seem to exist for none other than stylistic reasons.
Somehow I don't give a damn as long as Norton keeps talking and the
camera keeps doing that thing it does.  Shiftng out of focus and
shivering.  Freezing in place and moving abruptly forward.  The
"Matrix" and some other things.  For example, I love the shot in the
very beginning where camera moves down to the van parked in the
basement.  Impressive camerawork overall.  The all-out effects
delicately balanced out Norton's narrative, giving it just enough
oomph but not taking effect away from it.  I mentioned that Norton's
voice-over was like poetry; in fact the entire film is Homeresque in
its scale and beauty.  It's not afraid to do things that haven't been
done before, to laugh at itself with its twisted sense of humor (yes,
it *is* very funny).</P>
<P>Pitt and Norton prove a superb duo (in a movie that is all about the
interaction between Jack and Tyler); it's nice to see Pitt and Helena
Bonham Carter throw away their images and throw themselves into their
eccentric roles.  Norton, however, holds up the bulk of the movie and
proves that he earned that Oscar nomination.  If "The People vs. Larry
Flynt" and "Rounders" didn't make him a star, this movie will.  Don't
be fooled by Pitt's top billing.  It's all about Ed this time.</P>
<P>One friend, deceived by the film's title (as I was), claimed that if
he wanted to go see a film about men fighting, he'd see a Jean-Claude
Van Damme movie.  Well, as anyone who's see "Fight Club" can tell you;
the "Fight" has nothing to do with the theme, at least not directly.
Yes, there are a lot of fights, but all staged to illustrate a central
theme.  The beauty of "Fight Club" is when you look back, when the
movie is winding down to a halt, at everything that happened, you
realize that all parts coalasce to become a whole, and everything
clicks into place.  Without all of its individual parts the tale would
not be whole.  It's intriguing, and it makes you want to watch the
entire movie again just to see its genius and foreshadowing at work.
"The Sixth Sense," anyone (I haven't actually seen the movie yet, I
just read an article in Entertainment Weekly :)?  It's like one of
those riddles that give you a crime scene and ask you to find out how
the victim died.</P>
<P>I've heard the aforementioned EW doesn't like this movie.  They say
it's senselessly violent.  I think they're missing the point.  Yes,
there is a lot of violence in this movie, and I wouldn't recommend it
to young children; but is it senseless?  Is the movie rendered
pointless because in the end, we find out that Tyler never even
existed?  That he was just Jack's alter- ego in his fantasies?  Some
say by writing Jack into a lunatic you destroy the whole purpose of
the movie.  I say it only adds layers of meaning.  It's about a man's
struggle with his inner voice and his ideas that are being suffocated
by upper-middle-class monotony.  On the outside, his suits are crisp,
clean, white as snow; his behavior impeccable, his choice in furniture
excellent.  Inside, as the film shows us, he is turbulent.  And this
is where the violence comes in.  It is terrible, but it is definitely
not senseless.  It serves to illustrate a point, to develop Jack's
character.</P>
<P>I cannot help but wonder, however, if the film wouldn't be better if
it had just ended with Jack dying.  That ending would've felt more in
tune with the rest of the movie.  This one feels fine too; I couldn't
have asked for anything more beautiful and poignant.  Jack's still
screwed up, but he found someone just as screwed up as he is.  In the
end we're not only shaken by the look into our materalistic lives but
we've also gotten a haunting and penetrating look into the mind of an
"ordinary man."</P>
<PRE>Rating: A (First viewing, 10/23/99)</PRE>
<P>* The only reason I didn't give the movie an A+ is because they blew up
Apple computers.  Hey, stop snickering!</P>
