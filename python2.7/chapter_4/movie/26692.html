<P>Not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie.
Earlier this year, Nora Ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least
likeable "comedies" called HANGING UP, featuring a bunch of annoying women
(ironically, Lisa Kudrow played one in that film as well) who barely have
time to care about anyone but themselves. Ick...real sweet stuff.</P>
<P>But her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what John
Travolta went through earlier this summer, with a film entitled BATTLEFIELD
EARTH. I seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated
the film, even if it was on a "cheese" factor, as everybody, and I mean
everybody else, pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst
disasters of all time. Yipes...another beauty. So what happens when you put
these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the
ever-versatile Lisa Kudrow? Uhhhm, you guessed it...not much.</P>
<P>PLOT:
In order to escape major financial difficulties, a local weatherman hooks up
with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery. But as
more and more people find out about their scheme, more and more people
demand a part of their winnings, and more and more problems arise.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Simply stated, I didn't laugh once during this entire picture. For a comedy,
it offered me a few smiles, a bunch of nincompoops as characters, a miscast
John Travolta hamming it up and Lisa Kudrow, in what can only described as a
"sluttier" version of her character of Phoebe on TV's "Friends". This film
was not as disastrous as I thought it would be, but it was pretty close.
Thankfully, the clips of Travolta dressed up in goofy outfits, dancing as
the weatherman were left in the film's trailer, and not in this final cut.
And not unlike the worst movie of the year so far, BEAUTIFUL, this film also
managed to feature many unsympathetic, idiotic and just plain irritating
characters in its cast. Foremost was Travolta's character, who declined to
give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie. And for me, the
casting choice of John Travolta for this role was just plain wrong. He
didn't fit the part. I just saw him in GET SHORTY the other day and thought
about how perfect he was for that role. A cool, calculating roughneck with a
certain hip, suave "je ne sais quoi". In this film, he looks like he's
trying to be funny, trying to be bad, trying to be good. We're not supposed
to be able to notice that, and when we do, at least in my case, I consider
it a wrong choice in casting.</P>
<P>Add that to Lisa Kudrow, boring us with yet another one of her patented
"dumb blonde" routines, but this time, dressed in sexier outfits. Michael
Rapaport, stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite
up at the same speed level as everyone else. And a truckload of empty
comedic bullet shells, and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience
anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize. The only real good
thing that I could say about this film is that its story was actually
half-interesting and never really bored me. I also liked Michael Moore's
perverted cousin character, and I loved, and I say it again, loved the
character that Bill Pullman played. Give this dude his own movie! He played
a lazy cop, a man who tries everything not to do any real work. He fakes
injuries to get off duty, tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't
have to fill out any forms...now there's a base of humor. Sadly, the
filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left
in the film. And there's not much else I can say about this movie, folks. On
the whole, it was lame, included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling
around in a pool of unfunny lines, and very little of interest for any
target audience. But get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy
cop played by Pullman and I'm there!</P>
