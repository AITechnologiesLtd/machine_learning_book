<PRE>COMMENTS</PRE>
<P>As with all stories REALITY BITES can be viewed from a range of 
overlapping vantage points.</P>
<P>*   The dyadic and romantic.  "Friendships" and/or "relationships" 
    between those of opposite gender or the same gender.  The most 
    prominent in this film was the "romantic tension" between Lelaina 
    (Winona Ryder) and Troy (Ethan Hawke) who alternately flirt and 
    fight on the border between friendship and love, and between the 
    casual and the intimate, throughout the course of the film.</P>
<P>*   An ensemble piece.  The culture and psychology of a small closely 
    knit group.  The success to which the culture of the group is 
    communicated as reflected by degree to which the "in jokes" are 
    comprehensible to outsiders (the audience).</P>
<P>*   As "Hollywood".  The perennial debate over whether the latest 
    Beautiful Young Thing can act or whether he or she is just another
    cinematic hood ornament.</P>
<P>*   The cinematographic and nostalgic.  The Past as video, home movies
    or black and white television.  Similar examples which come to 
    mind include: Paul Cox's films MY FIRST WIFE, MAN OF FLOWERS, MY 
    LIFE; the opening scene of TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL; THE SUM OF US; and MY 
    LIFE.  REALITY BITES could be seen as a nostalgic reflection on the 
    seventies is as distinct from that for the fifties and sixties.  </P>
<P>*   The developmental and socio-cultural.</P>
<P>It is to the last of these that the rest of this article addresses itself. </P>
<P>     This movie examines the transition from adolescence into young
adulthood made a background of accelerating social and cultural
change.  This transition period can be somewhat protracted for, among
others, those engaging in tertiary education.</P>
<P>    In any event, there can be a rather abrupt change in the was
reality is perceived from the view through the rose coloured glasses of
childhood to a much sharper and sometimes brutal "real world" outside
the protective boundaries of the family.  There being a marked contrast
between the experiences the post-war boom of the "baby boomer"
generation of rapid economic growth and full employment with that of
their post-post-war offspring.  The "generation gap" seems to widening
with each succeeding generation this century.</P>
<P>    There are reflections on the fallout of the changes in the Family,
for example, the experience of children who's parents divorced during
their childhood or adolescence.  This runs in parallel with the
disintegration of a uniform value system at the societal level.  That
is not to say that pluralism is a bad thing, however it does for many
hone certain existential issues to an uncomfortable sharpness.</P>
<P>    There is what might be described as the "evolution" of the hippie
into the yuppie.  A change which mirrors a conservative shift among
youth secondary perhaps to anxieties about finding work to "survive" -
if not fulfilling middle-class expectations of a certain standard of
living in industrialised urban societies.</P>
<P>    Examined also are the place (if any) in America of the Intellectual
and of other recognizable stereotypes such as the Yuppie, the Hippie,
the Dropout, and the Homosexual.  Overlaid on these types are the
individual characteristics of the particular person portrayed.  Are
relationships across such subcultural types viable, for example,
between Lelaina and Michael (a yuppie with a Heart of Gold?).</P>
<PRE>    Mrs Pierce: Why don't you try getting a job at Burger King?
    Lelaina: But Ma, I was valedictorian at my university!
    Step-father (?): Well, you don't have to put that in your 
        application...</PRE>
<PRE>GLOSSARY</PRE>
<P>Hippie = A young person who rejects conventional ideas and society and
         adopts and unusual style of dress and habits, etc (OED).</P>
<P>Yuppie = Young Upwardly Mobile Professional</P>
