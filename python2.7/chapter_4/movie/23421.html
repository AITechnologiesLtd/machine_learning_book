<P>For melodrama lovers still weeping the death of Bambi's mother, My Dog
Skip is the perfect film. Ditto parents looking for wholesome and
oftentimes cute material for their kids. But for those seeking popcorn
entertainment, adult fare or typical March trash, the last word of the
title should serve as a subliminal hint.</P>
<P>"My fondest memories are from my childhood days," explains Willie
Morris (Frankie Muniz of television's Malcolm in the Middle). Those
days began with a lonely nine-years-old Willie seeing his 20-something
best friend (Luke Wilson) depart to join American soldiers overseas in
World War Two. They would end with his best friend being the dog who
lends his name to the film's title and Willie's popularity among local
youth being far greater than anyone could have imagined. In-between he
would have fights with his "stern and overbearing" father, befriend
the cutest girl in town, uncover an illegal bootlegging operation and
witness a member of Bambi's type take one in the chest. Through all of
this, he would grow up.</P>
<P>Willie Morris penned the autobiographical book that became this
movie. After those days of French invasions, childhood crushes and
good ol' Skip, Morris became an accomplished author and served as
editor of Harper's Magazine for seven years. He passed away in August,
1999 - just months before the premiere of My Dog Skip.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is reminiscent of both Forrest Gump and Dennis
the Menace. As an unpopular only child against a background setting of
real events, Morris seems a lot like Gump; his girlfriend is equally
suggestive of Jenny. But the suburban life with nest-door neighbors
and sling-shots leads you to wonder why he doesn't have that one
strand of hair aimed at Ra.</P>
<P>Frankie Muniz seems to be the hottest new kid actor in Hollywood with
Malcolm in the Middle garnering both critical and popular
acclaim. Unfortunately, this overly-sentimental role proves a tad
heavy for the relatively inexperienced star and the result is numerous
emotional scenes losing their oomph because of his obvious
confusion. On a brighter note, however, Kevin Bacon (the center of the
movie universe) and Diane Lane (recently in the under-appreciated A
Walk on the Moon) turn in grade-A performances as our protagonist's
parents.</P>
<P>In wake of the overly-violent Pokémon and mediocre-at-best Tigger
Movie, My Dog Skips proves to be the first film since Toy Story 2 that
the tots can see without objection. This movie doesn't have as much to
offer on multiple levels as the November hit and is a less cheery
piece - but it is a genuine family film and those are hard to come by
these days.</P>
