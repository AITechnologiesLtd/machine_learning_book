<PRE>WILDE ABOUT EVERETT</PRE>
<PRE>AN IDEAL HUSBAND
Written and Directed by Oliver Parker
Based on the play by Oscar Wilde
With Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore
De Vargas    PG-13     97 min</PRE>
<P>     Marvelous actors wearing beautiful clothes and speaking the
exquisite dialogue of Oscar Wilde; this may not be a recipe for
perfection, but it's as welcome as a cool lemon squash on a sultry
afternoon.</P>
<P>Oscar Wilde's laconic, intricately-plotted drawing room farce
lifts the garment of faultlessness we demand our lovers and leaders
wear, and tickles the feet of clay that lie exposed.  Set on the eve
of the century we're about to shed, it reminds us that scandal in high
places is timeless ("Scandals used to lend charm and interest to a
man; nowadays, they crush him"), and we'd do well to evaluate things
on balance, not in absolutes.  Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam of
"The Winslow Boy") is a rising politician, adored by his wife Gertrud
(Cate Blanchett) and noticed by the Prime Minister.  Into this
paradise comes a lovely serpent, Mrs. Chevely (Julianne Moore), who
has possession of an incriminating letter written years earlier by
Chiltern -- a letter which would reveal the one dishonorable blemish
on his spotless public record.  In return for his support in
Parliament of a dubious Argentine canal project in which she has a
financial interest, she will return the letter.</P>
<P>Observing all this, at the story's center, is Lord Arthur Goring
(Rupert Everett).  Goring is Wilde's alter ego, and as such gets most
of the best lines, from the moment he opens his eyes and grumbles that
it will be a busy day "with distressingly little time for either sloth
or idleness" through such classic observations as "To love oneself is
the beginning of a lifelong romance."  Everett, who is fast becoming
one of the screen's most irresistible presences, sails through this
production with the aplomb of a yacht.  With his sleek good looks, and
his inexaustible range of nuance, he is An Ideal Wilde, and a man for
whom the great Oscar would happily have thrown over his beloved Bosie.
Everett's Oscar could well rate an Oscar.</P>
<P>Oliver Parker, who misfired on Shakespeare's "Othello", has done
much better by this giant of English letters.  Despite a few liberties
of which the master might or might not have approved -- tweakings of
story, and the discreet flash of breast and buttock -- he's managed a
thoroughly enjoyable and generally faithful work of Wildeana.</P>
