        This is a paticularly frustrating film to watch.  It's not a complete
failure on the level of "Heaven's Gate", nor is it the focused, involving ex-
ample of storytelling that "Unforgiven" is, either.  It is three hours plus of
filmmaking that more often than not fails to live up to its pedigree.  No sin-
gle level of the film is severely deficient -- the acting, directing, score,
production design, costumes and editing are all well executed.  The script has
many memorable lines and moments, although they are fewer and further between
than previous Kasdan efforts.  Kasdan still has a strong eye for composition,
and since "Unforgiven" seems to be the goal here, the pacing and character 
shadings seem appropriate.  Randy Quaid comes out of this the best...his Doc
Holliday is visually unsettling and flamboyant.  Flamboyant enough, in fact,
to seem somewhat out of place -- a sort of "Silverado" character in an "Unfor-
given"-toned film.  Still, he provides most of the film's best moments, al-
though the supporting cast delivers their share as well.  You can tell where
you're supposed to be cheering, where you're supposed be tense,  where you're
supposed to emotionally peak and valley along with the protagonist.  But you
don't connect as well as you should, the result being a well-crafted but ultim-
ately ineffectual.  Not recommended.</P>
