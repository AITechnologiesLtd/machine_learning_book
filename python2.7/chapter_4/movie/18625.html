<P>Everyone I talked to loved Patch Adams, and yet the critics completely
lambasted it. Here is a movie that I'm sure the movie-going public and
professional critics can agree on. They're saying that October Sky is
the first great movie of 1999, and they're right.</P>
<P>This is the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young boy
in a small West Virginia coal mining town who is obsessed with
building a working rocket. His influence is the Russian satellite
Sputnik, a landmark achievement that he sees pass, consequently, in
the October night sky.  His father (played by Chris Cooper), driven by
generations of coal miners in the family, views Homer's rocket
chemistry as nonsensical and wants him to follow in his footsteps.
The only support Homer gets is from his friends and his teacher, Miss
Riley (Laura Dern), who eagerly assists him as his dream unravels.</P>
<P>Joe Johnston manages to press all the right buttons that a director
possibly could, turning this basic formula movie into an uplifting,
heartwarming piece of modern day entertainment. It's absolutely no
surprise that the movie is produced by the same people as Field of
Dreams. It's that good.</P>
<P>October Sky could have easily failed if everything didn't click
appropriately. The first mission was to get a believable actor to play
Homer, the young real-life hero who now works at NASA. This is where
the filmmakers struck gold. In casting newcomer Jake Gyllenhaal as the
teenager brave enough to follow his dream, Johnston made the best
decision of his career. Young Gyllenhaal is a sensational find, and
the movie simply glows whenever he's on camera. This puts everything
to rest, because he's in nearly every scene in the film.</P>
<P>Another wise move was to put Homer's rocky relationship with his
father ahead of even the main story. Cooper has a familiar role and
speaks familiar dialogue, but his situation is so believable that all
signs of deja vu are quickly pushed aside. Laura Dern is also playing
somewhat of a stock character. Her role may be the one weak spot the
film has, but in the same sense she performs very well with the
material she's given. Everyone involved deserves a pat on the back for
making this movie.</P>
<P>There's truly never an uninvolving moment in this two-hour gem, which
has far more than the designated amount of laughs and smiles needed to
register. If you're looking for something entertaining on a Saturday
afternoon, you couldn't do much better than seeing this. October Sky
is the best movie Hollywood has presented so far this year.</P>
