Savoring "Private Ryan"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>I feel very lucky to be living in an age where society's greatest war is
that on drugs and on AIDS.  I can only nod my head in grateful silence
when I think about those who have given their lives for the security of
their children, for the subsequent betterment of society and for a life
free of tyranny.  And although these ends are noble and are worth dying
for, war has a strange way of eroding away the soul of a man and
replacing it with anger and emptiness.</P>
<P>"Saving Private Ryan" is a raw and powerful film that takes us right
into the bowels of WWII when allied forces staged their daring invasion
upon Omaha Beach, which we now know as D-day.  The film immediately
projects a mixture of raw tension and helplessness.  Like an animal
desperately trying to escape from a trap, thousands of men await in
their troop transports as they get ready to storm the beach.  Meanwhile,
the enemies have readied all of their artillery on them, waiting to
indiscriminately kill anything that moves.  Director Steven Speilberg
takes this masterfully shot battle scene one step further by allowing us
to see through the eyes of a soldier struggling to make it ashore as his
comrades fall prey to bullets, grenades and explosions while the color
of the ocean grows more red from the blood of the other soldiers.  </P>
<P>Countless lives were lost on D-day.  And throughout WWII, many more sons
lost their lives fighting for their country.  These kinds of losses are
insufferable for the parents of children killed in action and especially
for a widow named Ryan.  During the course of a month, 3 of her 4 brave
sons are killed.  One is possibly still alive.  He is Private James Ryan
(Matt Damon), a paratrooper that disappeared behind enemy lines after a
botched drop.  The War Dept. assures the mom that they will do whatever
they can to save him and to return him to her.</P>
<P>This assignments falls on the shoulders of Capt. John Miller (Tom
Hanks), who survived the invasion but is astounded to find out that he
has been selected to lead this trivial search and rescue mission.  The
group that he leads, in essence, is a microcosm of the ideas of war.
Three of them stood out for me.  There is Miller himself, whose
background doesn't lend itself to Captaincy, and the harsh reality of
war makes him worried that his wife will never again recognize him.
There is Pvt. Reiben (Edward Burns) who questions the practicality of
the mission.  And there is the meek Cpl. Upham who is an excellent
translator but has never fired a rifle or seen the brutality of war up
close.  But as they trek across the countryside in search of Ryan ("he
better be worth it," says one of them) and face snipers and machine gun
nests, they begin to learn more about one another.  Their time spent
traveling across the scenic French landscape allows them weigh the
importance of saving Private Ryan and allows them to finally internalize
the significance of the mission.  For these men, it is a way for them to
inject some of the humanity that has been stripped away through war,
blood, vomit and death.</P>
<P>This is not only a superior war film, but at it's moralistic center, it
is a dramatic story about a group of men in search of a form of
redemption that is as hard to find as Ryan himself.  There are some
disturbing scenes of carnage such as bodies exploding, people whose
limbs have been shot off, or even the intestines of a still-alive
soldier.  But all of it is appropriate given the backdrop of WWII and
the fierce battles that took place.</P>
<P>Indeed, during this time when men are reduced to animals that
indiscriminately kill to stay alive, when men undergo a startling
transformation from farm boys to killing machines, when men must band
together to overcome their greatest fears and most sorrowful of regrets,
finding and saving Private Ryan may be the one decent thing that they
can do - it may be the one positive thing that they can take away from
this war.  As each of the men who are assigned on this odd mission begin
to connect with it's moral importance, they realize that saving Private
Ryan means that in some way they can also save themselves.</P>
