<P>Susan Granger's review of "BELLY" (Artisan Entertainment)</P>
<P>      Hype Williams' rambling, confused gangsta rap story revolves
around lifelong pals turned drug dealers. Tommy Brown (Earl Simmons,
known as the rapper DMX) and Sincere (Nasir Jones, known as Nas) grew
up in the projects in Queens; now they're living in luxury on Long
Island. Each one decides to take a different path. Sincere's into
family life, perhaps a movie to Africa, trying to distance himself
from the chaos of illegal drug trafficking, while greedy Tommy's
getting in deeper and deeper with a superpowered heroin manufactured
in Omaha, Nebraska. Predictably, conflicts occur - and the
heavy-handed finale, set on New Year's Eve, 1999, revolves around an
interminable diatribe about ending mindless violence and saving
mankind, punctuated by a hallelujah chorus in the background. Hype
Williams' murky directing style stems from MTV, combining slow-motion,
rapid cuts, strobe effects, and a multitude of fish-eye shots and,
presumably, the actors are better at rapping than they are at
emoting. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Belly" is a stoned
2. It's hard to stomach.</P>
