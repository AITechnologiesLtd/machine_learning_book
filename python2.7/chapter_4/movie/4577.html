<PRE>                             Dusk Till Dawn
               A Review by Zach D. (<A HREF="mailto:zachd@hub.ofthe.net">zachd@hub.ofthe.net</A>)</PRE>
<P>First off, let's consult Webster's College Dictionary</P>
<P>    Gen-re (zhan're) n. 1. a class or category or artistic endeavor 
having a
    particular form, content, technique, or the like.</P>
<PRE>    Splice (splis) v. 4. to join or unite.</PRE>
<P>    be-wil-der (bi wil d'upside down e'r) v.t. 1. to confuse or puzzle
    completely.</P>
<P>    Ok, lets not kid anyone.  We all know Dusk Till Dawn is being hyped
because of Quentin Tarantino's involvement.  He's done a re-write here, 
some
less than good acting there, even a sandbox project for grownup directors
gone terribly wrong - but here is what he does best: Write scripts.  We
ALSO know or should know by now that his new movie is about killing 
vampires.
More things we know are that Harvey Keitel, Julliete Lewis, and George
Clooney are in the film.  Oh yeah, we also knew that hot-shot Robert
Rodriguez is not only the director but the 'Camera Operator' as the 
credits
say.  OK, you think you're set up pretty well. You are expecting the 
worst.
Maybe your expecting the best.  I'll just say that no matter what you 
expect,
you will in no way be prepared for this film!
    OK quick synopsis if you haven't heard.  Notorious criminals
Seth and Richie Gecko are armed, dangerous, and on the loose after
a jail break and bank robbery.  While fleeing to Mexico they take a 
family
hostage.  Keitel is the ex-minister/dad, disgruntled with the Lord for 
the
loss of his wife and heading to Mexico with daughter (Lewis) and Chinese
son (?).  So, the band swings on down to the rendevous point where they
proceed to KILL VAMPIRES.  AND MORE VAMPIRES. AND MORE AND MORE.
Mr. Blue: "How many vampires is that?"
Mr. White: "A LOT"</P>
<P>    Now, I don't recall ever having watched a movie with this sort
of genre splicing in my life.  This movie is 50% road/heist film and
50% Splatter/Horror.  I've seen movies that hovered on the fringe of it
(most recently, Dead Presidents) but never, never, never have I seen
something like this.  For that alone, I admire Tarantino much like Todd
admires Butthead when he says, "You're TWISTED MAN!". (p.s. that's
a compliment; Also, mentioning of Beavis, Butthead, or Todd in any
followup posts or mail is punishable by death)
    But, I guess we must dig to the heart of the matter and ask the
bigger question: Does it Work? CAN it work?  Yes and No.  It works
as 50% of a heist film, and it definitely works as 50% of a splatter
film.  But I'm not sure if those parts put together are as fulfilling
as 100% of either genre.
     The first half of the film is pretty tight.  Reminiscent of The
Getaway (No dummy, the one with Steve McQueen, not that Baldwin freak)
and Natural Born Killers if they had featured two brothers instead of
lovers.  First off we notice that Clooney can play the tough guy!  This
guy smokes. Tarantino also shows that he was really meant to play
a psychopath all this time also!  I rather enjoyed his performance,
and the two make quite a team.  We also  catch a good look at what
NBK would have looked like in it's original form (Die Oliver Die).
There's violence, tension, and humor, but it's all as black as the
outfits the Gecko Brothers are wearing.  The dialogue is Tarantino gone
Texas, and fairly accurate. The characters even throw in a few movie
references to get their point across.  But, before you get your panties
in a wad by saying that QT's a one trick dialogue spewing pony, it's
really not that similar to his last writing jobs.   OK, so maybe it is,
but different at the same time; Just don't let me hear that 'one trick
pony' line because I hate it.  Rodriguez does his usual magic with the
camera, and he does the desert road justice.  There is one disturbing
scene I won't mention which is rather well done, but quite bewildering
and I'll leave it up to you to figure THAT one out.
    The second half of the movie finds the unlikely gang making it to
the rendevous point (an insanely wild titty-bar, pardon my French) where
they are greeted by Cheech Marin and a load of Vampires.  They have a
couple of bruisers lend a hand for a while - a Black Vietnam Vet and a
Large Mexican Fellow.  From here the movie takes on the likeness of one
of the greatest splatter flicks ever made, Dead Alive.  As in Dead Alive,
the ex-minister must gain strength to fight the evil ("I kick ass, for 
the
Lord! - from D.A. not Dusk, but Keitel gives a similar, more sedate
monologue).  Also, the point is not really to escape, but to KILL every
last Mexican turned undead evil minion from the whorey nether regions.
They go at the task with great vigor, and the camera work may leave your
head spinning at times!  Drawback here as that any attempt to recapture
anything from the first half of the movie is lost.  Acting or dialogue
is no longer important, and so you've lost sight of the creative effort.
It's just too much of a shock to the film-goers well trained mind!  For
me it was a pleasent shock, but I can imagine many will be repulsed by 
the
total abandoment of basic film structure
    Having said all that, I'd say that if they had a genre for this
genre, it would be at or near the top.  But since they don't, this film
will probably be forgotten only to live on as a best renter in the cult
classics section of the video store 15 years from now.  I liked it
personally, and will probably see it again just to relive the bizarre
experience (note, still nothing has topped the experience of sitting
through Tetsuo's Ironman!).  I won't put it on my top shelf with 
Reservoir
Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but I will always marvel at the fact that 
Tarantino
actually got away with getting this film made, and doing it as grandly as 
he
did with the help of Robert "water into wine" Rodriguez. I see it as 
another
visually strong effort from Rodriguez and another page in Tarantino's
bizzarre film resume.  One that, when he is finished writing, will indeed 
be
more bizarre than anything that the good Doctor Seuss could come up with.</P>
