<P>
I suppose it was inevitable.  The end of the Cold War, and all the
geopolitical change that entails, finally made its effects felt in a
Bond film.  The Cold War really is over.</P>
<P>Yes, "Goldeneye" was called the first post-Cold War Bond film, but it
was only that way simply because it was made after 1991 and had the
Russians as friends from the start.  There was the self-conscious title
scene with the usual sillouetted naked ladies, this time wielding
hammers and sickles, but the film still had an old Bond feel to it,
whatwith with supervillains and plots to take over the world with a big
ray gun.  Instead of SPECTRE and Blofeld, we have renegade Russian Army
units; names are differnt, but methodologies are the same.</P>
<P>The new Bond film, though, is far more embedded in the late 1990s.
Yes, there are nifty gadgets, impressive I-want-to-do-that
globetrotting, beautiful women (Teri Hatcher needs something to do
nowadays) and serious cars, but there are material changes in this
installment.  The Russians aren't even mentioned except in the
pre-credits teaser.  And, then, even that mention has a certain
post-Cold War mixture of dreadfulness and decline, referring to loose
Russian controls over their nuclear weapons.  Not quite Russians as
Keystone Kops, but certainly not Russia as fearsome superpower.</P>
<P>The main foreign country, in fact, is China, but this is really a minor
point.  The filmmakers simply pick the country that's vaguely
threatening, certainly powerful, in a sort of fill-in-the-Great-Power
way.  Amusingly, at least to Americans, Britain is still shown having
geopolitical weight.  I suppose in this way, the new Bond film looks
back to the Empire, or at least to a Britain that wouldn't have had a
hard time taking on Argentina.  Even in the Connery films, it was
acknowledged that World War III would be fought out by the Americans
and the Soviets, with Britian only as a supporting player.  My guess is
that this episode of imperial nostalgia was brought about by the
handover of Hong Kong around the time the movie was released, a sort of
schoolyard "we didn't really have to hand it back if we didn't feel
like it" mood.</P>
<P>The real innovations of this film is the focus on Ted Turner as a Great
Power.  The historical reference is Hearst and the Spanish-American
War, but magnified by satellite TV.  Missiles, warships, and all the
other tokens of military power are subservient to almighty broadcast
news.  That CNN logo in the lower right corner, so indelibly etched
into our memory of the Gulf War, of NATO airstrikes, of any situation
that potentially means war, has, in this Bond film, been elevated to
superpower status.  (I would have been amused to see "logo burning"
legislation before the Congress.)  Great Power conflict has been
morphed into ratings wars and sweeps week.  While not exactly a new
concept -- CNN, I think, caused America to send troops to Somalia and
ultimately Kosovo, and I'm sure there have been scads of academic
papers being shed on this subject -- I suppose the idea achieves a
certain pop culture status by its inclusion into a Bond film.</P>
<P>The Bond Girl in this installment happens to be Michelle Yeoh, who we
know is more than capable of kicking Pierce Brosnan's ass.  A minor
issue: we can safely assume she's not on the motorcycle that's jumping
over the helicopter, whereas in the Jackie Chan movies, she really,
really is on the motorcycle jumping on the moving train; the blooper
outtakes shows her missing a number of times.  The thrill isn't quite
the same.</P>
<P>Oh, yes, the self-referential toss-offs.  There's the one that was on
the TV ads: "Bond... you know the rest": Bond, as entirely embedded in
popular consciousness.  He doesn't even utter his tagline "martini,
shaken not stirred".  Teri Hatcher does this; she knows what his
favorite drink is as well as the rest of us.</P>
<P>A more interesting Self-referential Moment is near the end.  Yes, the
big bad guy has once again explained his secret plan before attempting
to kill the good guys (at least there's a motive for this peculiar,
recurring stupidity: "I like an audience").  Just before Bad Guy gets
waxed, Bond tells him that the most important thing in the media biz is
to "give them what they want."  The bad guy then expires in a very
ouch, very messy way, giving all of us what we expect to see finish a
climatic mano-a-mano at the end of an action movie.</P>
<P>One oddity is Teri Hatcher as a previous love interest/entanglement.
Seeing her again is sufficient to drive Bond to drink (more).  I don't
believe he's acted like this before (that whole marriage thing
excluded, though that's immaterial since that's forgotten with this Gen
X Bond).  This is a change from the autonomous independent Bond,
perhaps an attempt to give him a new past.  It's a half-hearted effort,
and the filmmakers drop it without much issue.  I don't think it works
-- our image of Bond is already fixed.</P>
<P>Bond, thankfully and entirely unlike Ethan Hunt in "Mission
Impossible", does not have a Macintosh laptop and does not even mention
the Internet.  This saves us from having to mock the movie for a really
bad depiction of retrieving e-mail or that the Mac has powers to upload
a virus into an alien mothership (thereby saving the world).  Think
Different.</P>
<P>Perhaps one thing that isn't there to give it a truly late 1990s spin
is the lack of conspiracies in smoke-filled rooms, UFOs and maybe new,
exotic plagues.  But that may be a peculiarly American way of
thinking.  Or, maybe, something to put into 1999's Bond film.</P>
<P>Oh, at the end of it all, I liked the movie.  It's fun, perhaps not the
best Bond film, but up there.</P>
