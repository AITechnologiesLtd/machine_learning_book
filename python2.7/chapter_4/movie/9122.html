<P>     Here's an easy short-hand for thinking about THE PEACEMAKER:  it's a
James Bond film without James Bond.  The protagonist, U.S. Army
intelligence officer Col. Tom DeVoe (George Clooney), is a man of action
with contacts around the globe (Armin Mueller-Stahl plays his Russian
Felix Leiter).  His partner is a beautiful and determined woman, nuclear
specialist Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman).  Their adversary is a
nationalist from the former Yugoslavia (Marcel Iures) who has gotten hold
of a nuclear warhead.  Their search for the missing nuke takes DeVoe and
Kelly from Vienna to the Iranian border to New York City.  Okay, so
there's no sex and no vodka martinis, but THE PEACEMAKER comes with
virtually everything else you could ask for in an espionage thriller:
superbly crafted action sequences, a charismatic hero, marvelous
production values, the threat of mass destruction, humor and style.  At
times, it's as satisfying an action film as 1997 has produced to date.</P>
<P>     That's bound to come as a surprise considering the folks both behind
and in front of the camera.  THE PEACEMAKER marks the feature directing
debut of Mimi Leder (previously on duty as a director for "ER",
including the Emmy-nominated "Love's Labor Lost" episode), but she
shows no signs of rookie jitters.  Her sense of timing an action scene,
ably assisted by editor David Rosenbloom, creates tension in unlikely
places; her instinct for effective restraint (like the positively
heretical decision to show two trains hurtling towards one another, then
cut away before the collision) is uncommon and welcome.  Leder instantly
distinguishes herself as a big-screen action director to watch for.</P>
<P>     George Clooney, meanwhile, has previously distinguished himself on
the big screen largely by not distinguishing himself, disappearing into
the frenetic horror of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and the inane vortex that was
BATMAN & ROBIN.  In THE PEACEMAKER, he's a roguish hero with an edge.
DeVoe displays an often ruthless military pragmatism, yet his very refusal
to play politics gives many of his comic lines their bite.  He's an
international enforcer as Sean Connery used to play it:  with a twinkle in
his eye and a hand at your throat.</P>
<P>     He's no Bond, of course, which points out the one glaring deficiency
keeping THE PEACEMAKER from being a great action film.  The Bond films'
awareness of their own high-flying absurdity forced them to avoid
self-importance, while also making it easy for viewers to overlook
mediocre scripts.  Not only is Michael Schiffer's screenplay for THE
PEACEMAKER too serious by half, it feels only half-finished.  Instead of
an arrogantly megalomaniacal villain, or even an appealingly insane one,
Schiffer offers a somber, haunted Bosnian surrounded by the somber,
haunted ruins of Sarajevo.  Leder adds a touch of irony with a passing
shot of Sarajevo's Olympic rings, at least momentarily defusing the
impression that THE PEACEMAKER is trying to Make a Political Statement.
As for the characters...let's just call them functional.  There's a
mechanical feel to the narrative flow of THE PEACEMAKER; it moves from
place to place or person to person with little connective tissue to hold
it all together.  It's an action machine, albeit an extremely well-oiled
one.</P>
<P>     Well-oiled action machines are rare enough that THE PEACEMAKER could
find a receptive audience, perhaps the same audience anxiously awaiting
James Bond's next adventure.  Operating without a compelling script or the
built-in goodwill which accompanies the planet's most famous secret agent,
Mimi Leder and company manage to create a worthy challenger.  With
competition like Bond, it's impressive that Leder was neither shaken nor
stirred.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Bond-ed deliveries:  7.</PRE>
