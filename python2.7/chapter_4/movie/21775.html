<PRE>MICKEY BLUE EYES (M).  
(Universal)
Director: Kelly Makin
Stars: Hugh Grant, James Caan, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Burt Young, James Fox, 
Joe Viterelli, Paul Lazar, John Ventimigillia
Running time: 102 minutes.</PRE>
<P>It's easy to see what initially attracted Hugh Grant to this
rather disappointing comedy.  His character, an effete Englishman who
becomes involved with the Mob, is familiar stuff, virtually a
composite of most of the characters he has been playing since his
breakthrough role in Four Weddings And A Funeral.</P>
<P>Grant plays Michael Felgate, an auctioneer with a British firm
operating in New York.  When he proposes to his girlfriend, local
school teacher Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn), he is disappointed when she
tells him that she can't marry him.  Her father (James Caan, best
known for his role in the classic The Godfather) is a prominent
gangster, and she doesn't want him becoming compromised by that world,
where one small favour leads to another, and so forth.  Michael
convinces her that he will not be seduced by the mob and that he can
refuse any offers they may care to make.  But slowly, he finds himself
drawn into their world.  Before long, Michael finds that the auction
house is being used by the mob for money laundering purposes.
Complications set in when a mobster's son is accidentally murdered,
and Michael finds himself pretending to be a tough gangster from
Kansas.  Eventually he is forced to co-operate with the FBI in order
to survive a mob contract and get to the church on time.
 </P>
<P>Following other comedies that have dealt with the mob and its
murderous ways and codes of honour (Married To The Mob and the recent
Analyze This, etc), Mickey Blue Eyes is a second rate comedy that
struggles for genuine laughs.  Writers Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn
lack any sense of irony, and squander many opportunities to send up
the clichés of the genre.  The film becomes less likeable, less
credible and less funny as it unfolds.  Canadian director Kelly Makin
struggles to lift the lacklustre material, which moves along at an
uneven pace.</P>
<P>The performances lack spark.  Grant does his usual by the
numbers performance for much of the film, but he is out of his depth
when called upon to impersonate a gangster.  Even Caan seems
embarrassed here, and he struggles to milk as much ironic humour out
of his comic portrayal of an archetypal gangster as De Niro did in the
far superior Analyze This.  James Fox is totally wasted as Grant's
foppish boss.</P>
<P>Grant has established himself as a likeable star of light
weight romantic comedies, and it will be interesting to see how his
career fares after this disappointing and heavy handed farce.  But,
since he and girl friend Liz Hurley produced the film through their
own production company, they have no-one to blame but themselves for
this disaster.</P>
