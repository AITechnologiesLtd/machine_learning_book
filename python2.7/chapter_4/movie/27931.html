<PRE>The Wilby Conspiracy (1975) 102m.</PRE>
<P>Not the best-known film in the careers of Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier, 
but certainly worth catching.  Don't let the homogeneous Robert Ludlum-like 
title put you off - THE WILBY CONSPIRACY is an adventure yarn with enough 
odd flourishes to earn itself a cult audience.  Caine is a British mining 
engineer vacationing in Capetown who meets his new lawyer girlfriend 
(Prunella Gee) for lunch and ends up on the run to Johannesburg with one of 
her clients (Poitier), a black activist newly released from several years in 
jail.  It looks like some serious exchanges about politics, South Africa, 
and apartheid are being set up to take place between Caine and the 
handcuffed Poitier, (THE DEFIANT ONES springs to mind fairly quickly), but 
you'll have to watch Richard Attenborough's CRY FREEDOM if you prefer your 
chase movies to have a more political bent.  THE WILBY CONSPIRACY raises 
many provocative issues in its opening scenes and then leaves them to 
ferment as background material.  All we have to know about Caine and 
Poitier's escapade is that it is politically motivated - the specifics 
aren't necessary.</P>
<P>The best thing about THE WILBY CONSPIRACY is the wry, lurking humor 
displayed in its snappy dialogue and unusual asides (my favorite is when 
Poitier visits a fellow conspirator who runs a dental practice while Caine 
pretends to watch a movie in Hindi).  Throw in former Miss India Persis 
Khambatta and a very youthful Rutger Hauer piloting his own plane, and how 
can you resist?  But there's more:  the film is stolen by Nicol Williamson's 
laid-back performance as a chain-smoking government security officer who 
seems to occupy a South Africa all of his own, stramming about the 
countryside and remarking "All righty" whenever he's ready to move on.  The 
characters and cast alone could probably carry this movie, but the storyline 
is also engaging.  It splits easily into thirds, each section presenting the 
protagonists with a problem to solve, i.e. a flight from the authorities, an 
operation to retrieve some diamonds, and a plan to cross the border.  It's 
worth noting that this story would have been handled differently if filmed 
twenty years later - the fairly difficult but straightforward trials faced 
by the characters would have become over-elaborate and ultimately 
unrealistic set pieces replete with stunts.  The simplicity of the WILBY 
CONSPIRACY is what gives it its charm, but more importantly it places the 
protagonists' goals within their reach, preventing it from becoming entirely 
unbelievable.  THE WILBY CONSPIRACY is also a lot easier to enjoy now that 
the business of apartheid has been dispensed with in South Africa - it's 
probably just as well the story downplayed this element to begin with.  
Because of the touchy subject matter, director Ralph Nelson filmed on 
location in Kenya instead of South Africa.  Jack-of-all-trades Rod Amateau 
(a former producer, stuntman, actor and sitcom director) wrote the script, 
based on Harold Nebenzal's novel.</P>
