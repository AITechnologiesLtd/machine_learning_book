<PRE>                                 DANTE'S PEAK
                       A film review by David Wilcock
                        Copyright 1997 David Wilcock</PRE>
<P>A disaster movie starring Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton
A UNIVERSAL PICTURE</P>
<P>Now, this may sound like a bad joke, but I'll say it anyway. This film
is a "disaster." Ha ha, etc. As with any disaster movie, the plot is
frankly pitiful, the acting is terrible, the script is naff, and theres
no charecter development at all. But the worse thing is, not even the
speacil effects are terribly exciting.</P>
<P>The 'plot' centres around a town called, of course, 'Dantes Peak' And
Dantes Peak has a nice big volcano in the background just waiting to
erupt. Pierce Brosnan knows this of course, but when the tells the
council...guess what!...no one believes him except the (female) mayor.
But, of course, the volcano erupts, and Brosnan must go around rescuing
the mayor, her child, and the aunt who refuses to budge from the
volcano because it 'isn't going to erupt!'</P>
<P>Of course, before the volcano erupts, the movie tries to build
charecter, and a bit of story, but as soon as it does erupt, this is
thrown down the drain.</P>
<P>Quite frankly, this has to be one of the worse movies I've seen for a
long time. My advice...AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!</P>
<PRE>RATING=* out of *****</PRE>
