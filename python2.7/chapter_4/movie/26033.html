<PRE>TOUCH OF EVIL
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>There are some great films that are considered to be great
for the wrong reasons, not always having something to do
with their quality. TOUCH OF EVIL, 1958 noir thriller
directed by Orson Welles, is one of such examples. Its good
reputation among film critics and aficionados comes from the
background, not from the film itself. Simple fact that it
was directed by great Orson Welles is reason for respect.
But the story behind cameras indicates "great" film. In the
early stages of production Welles was originally hired only
for the acting part. At the insistence of his colleague
Charlton Heston, Universal agreed to allow Welles not only
to direct, and he also re-wrote the original script by Paul
Monash. The result was unusual film that didn't particularly
impressed studio bosses, so they ordered TOUCH OF EVIL to be
re-edited. Welles was unsatisfied with their decision and
practically disowned the film, creating another myth about
great masterpiece ruined by shortsighted, conservative
studio establishment that didn't understand true Art.</P>
<P>The film was actually based on BADGE OF EVIL, obscure pulp
novel by Whit Masterson. Complicated plot takes place in Los
Robles, seedy town on U.S./Mexican border. Ramon Miguel
"Mike" Vargas (played by Heston) is top ranking Mexican
anti- narcotics policeman who has just dealt spectacular
blow to Grandis, powerful group of narcotic smugglers.
Before he testifies, he plans to enjoy honeymoon with his
beautiful American wife Susan (played by Janet Leigh). They
are monitored by "Uncle Joe" Grandi (played by Akim
Tamiroff) who wants to prevent Vargas' testimony by
intimidating his wife. Their plans are affected by unrelated
incident that happens on the border crossing - powerful
local businessman from US side of the border and his
girlfriend get killed by a car bomb. Vargas, who witnessed
the incident, volunteers to help the investigation because
he thinks that the bomb had been planted on Mexican soil.
Investigation is led by Captain Hank Quinlan (played by
Orson Welles), grotesquely obese policeman who became a
local legend because of his law enforcement abilities.
Quinlan doesn't need much time to find a suspect - young
Mexican shoe clerk Manelo Sanchez (played by Victor Millan)
was employee of the deceased and had affair with the bosses'
daughter. When Quinlan finds explosives in Sanchez' home,
diligent Vargas can't fail noticing that the evidence got
planted. When he confronts Quinlan about it and threatens
with exposure, the old lawman decides to get rid of the
overinquistive Mexican. He gets in touch with Grandi and two
of them are plotting diabolical scheme to discredit Vargas
through his wife.</P>
<P>Like many other cinema classics, TOUCH OF EVIL flopped
during original theatrical run and was generally viewed as
the failure. This opinion was shared by studio executives
and critics alike. The latter considered Welles' work to be
nothing more than B-film with A-actors shot in some
unconventional techniques. On the surface, their arguments
have some merit - story which is set in seedy border town
drowned in prostitution and narco-trafficking and featuring
lesbian biker (played by Mercedes McCambridge) as drug
lord's henchman can easily be viewed as pure pulp. Welles
also contributes to this impression by conveniently showing
Janet Leigh in revealing clothes and putting her character
through mock gang rape and similar ordeals suitable for
damsels in pulpy B movies. Because of that, many
contemporary critics failed to see that TOUCH OF EVIL also
happens to deal with some serious issues like racism or
endless conflict between police efficiency and civil rights.
Perhaps that, more serious, dimension of this film got
overlooked because Welles tried to break too many
stereotypes. His idea to invert Hollywood cliches by
confronting honest and civic minded Mexican lawman with his
violent and corrupt American colleague might have looked
appealing on paper, but with not sufficiently polished
characterisation it made TOUCH OF EVIL almost too surreal.</P>
<P>However, main reason why people got attracted to this film
lies in Welles' directorial mastery and less in its content.
The most legendary thing about this film is an excellent
opening - 3 minutes long and continuous crane shot that
follows various characters and reveals many important
details about them and town where plot takes place. This
scene is awesome, especially considering how difficult it
was to make it. Afterwards, only a handful of directors
actually bothered to shoot such elaborate, encompassing
scenes and the practice became fashionable only most
recently. Unfortunately, the opening scene is the best and
the rest of film can't surpass it. Welles used many
interesting shots in order to make elaborate and memorable
scenes, but none of them fulfils the promise of those three
opening minutes.</P>
<P>The most valuable segment of the film is acting. Orson
Welles the actor was as impressive as Orson Welles the
director. Few characters in history of cinema were as
well-written and superbly played as Captain Hank Quinlan.
Welles first used everything in his power to make him as
unappealing as possible - Welles, already a man with extra
weight in real life, used padded clothes and low camera
angles in order to make Quinlan obese to the point of
caricature. But physical unattractiveness pales in
comparison with Quinlan's cynicism, racism and immorality.
Yet the audience slowly becomes to find sympathies to
Quinlan, who is slowly but inevitably following the path of
self-destruction until melodramatic finale. Welles did truly
splendid job, but his strong performance only underlined the
weaknesses in the rest of casting. Studio-imposed decision
to cast Charlton Heston as Mexican (spoofed in Tim Burton's
1994 ED WOOD) turned ruinous because of the bad make up.
Same problems with make up turned another potentially strong
performance - Akim Tamiroff's drug lord - into caricature.
On the other hand, some supporting actors were more than up
to the task - Joseph Calleia as Quinlan's faithful partner
and friend; Marlene Diettrich as Quinlan's old flame and
Dennis Weaver as neurotic motel clerk that predates Norman
Bates in PSYCHO. Film also benefited from musical soundtrack
by Henry Mancini, although some critics claim that the
opening scene works better without music which interferes
with genuine atmosphere of border town.</P>
<P>TOUCH OF EVIL is definitely not the best film by Orson
Welles and it doesn't even belong among the best of the
1950s. But inferiority of this film is rather relative; even
in underachievement Welles showed the truly magnificent
scope of his talent and the excellent reputation of this
film is, after all, well deserved.</P>
<PRE>RATING: 8/10 (+++)</PRE>
