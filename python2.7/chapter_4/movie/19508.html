<P>   Beauty can be effectively satirized by movies.  Look only to
the recent opening of "Drop Dead Gorgeous" to receive
parody upon burlesque (however ineffectual) of American
beauty pageants.  If beauty contests can be satirized, why
not beautiful movies?  There's no better target for spoofing in
that sense than the productions of director James Ivory and
his producer, Ismael Merchant, whose Masterpiece Theater-
type films are perfectly lovely--too much so.  Theirs are the
kinds of works that lead elderly folks to stop outside the
marquees and reminisce, "They don't make 'em like that
anymore."    Merchant-Ivory movies highlight lavish mansions
with groaning-board banquets, exquisitely dressed people,
and subtle dialogue amid the natural splendor of English
landscapes.  How utterly useless!  At least that's what
Esquire film critic David Thomson thought when he once said,
"The loveliness of Merchant-Ivory gives me the creeps!"  And
that's what director Gary Sinyor considers when in his "Stiff
Upper Lips" he concocts a story about a woman who tries to
force her niece to marry a big English bore when she guides
her and a coterie through Italy and India in the hope that the
young woman will forget her handsome and fascinating love
interest--who is of a far lower social class.</P>
<P>   Mavens of Merchant-Ivory, Masterpiece-Theater movies will
sit gloating as they check off which of that team's films are
parodied at which moment.  Is that shot of two English
university students involved in a hurdles race--one bearing a
crucifix about his neck while the other sports a Star of David--
from "Chariots of Fire"?  Does that sign outside the train that
points to the town of Ivory's End have anything to do with
"Howard's End"?  When one character wonders, "Why do you
need a room with a view," could that just possibly be from "A
Room with a View"?  And does the servant who urinates into
the soup and later into the fruit cup bear any resemblance at
all to the Anthony Hopkins guy in "Remains of the Day"?</P>
<P>   But you'll get no answers here. You'll have to see the film,
which to its detractors is merely a series of Saturday-Night-
Live skits but to aficionados of this sort of film is a stroke of
luck.  Unlike satires like the awful, no-joke "Drop Dead
Gorgeous"--which does not have a single likeable character--
"Stiff Upper Lips" may ridicule the pretentiousness of Ismael
and James, but displays quite a bit of affection toward them
and their genre.  (In fact Ismael Merchant was even offered a
small role in the film.)</P>
<P>   The story centers on the relationship between Agnes Ivory
(Prunella Scales, who is not unlike the maiden aunt in Oscar
Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest") and her
independent-minded and lovely niece, Emily Ivory (Georgina
Cates).  Emily wants to marry whom she chooses while her
more "responsible" aunt wants her to marry someone of the
right social class, specifically the boring stick, Cedric Trilling
(Robert Portal).  At first neither aunt nor niece could be said
to favor the view of Sir Arthur Sullivan's admiral in HMS
Pinafore who insists that "love levels all classes. " Emily is
horrified that a hunk who saves her from drowning, George
(Sean Pertweek), is from the lower orders, a man who
regularly drinks at a tavern called "The Scum of the Earth." 
Agnes makes a reluctant servant of George and together with
Emily and Emily's effete brother Edward (Samuel West) she
heads for Italy and then India in the hope of bringing Emily
and Cedric closer together.  What follows is a roundelay of
sexual situations, wherein Emily's brother (who has sexual
feelings only for his stuffed teddy bears)  and the monocle-
clad Cedric (who has "this strange feeling" for him) decide
that they are well-suited for each other.</P>
<P>   If "Stiff Upper Lips" does not retain the beauty of the real
Merchant-Ivory films, director Gary Sinyor nonetheless does
well by India and Italy, photographing elephants, sahibs, and
marvelous Roman-style monuments on location.  Georgina
Cates is drop-dead gorgeous as usual and Prunella Scales
furthers her reputation as one of England's top character
actresses.  Peter Ustinov should have been in more scenes. 
He does fine as both a judge, stiffly explaining British law to a
congregation of Indian subjects in a courtroom, and as a
suitor to Aunt Agnes--rounding out a happy ending for all in
which each character finds the person who is just made for
him or her.  Though Merchant-Ivory metaphors are skewered-
-compulsive letter-writing, racial animosities, suggestive
carvings, huge loads of luggage--you can easily sense the
affection that Sinyor and his co-writer Jeremy Bolt have for
the target of their barbs.  You won't keep your stiff upper lip
for long as you watch the entertainment unfold.</P>
