<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>I went with low expectations and thoughts of a hokey Ghost rip-off, but
instead was treated to a stunningly beautiful picture.  Even as I sat
and watched it, I cringed and waited for the bottom to fall out, but it
didn't happen (at least until the last ten minutes).  There was no
`pottery-wheel' type scene, no cheesy promises about eternal love and
not one crappy Righteous Brothers warble.  Thank fucking Christ.</P>
<P>Since City of Angels is about a tall dark seraph (Nicolas Cage) that
falls in love with an attractive cardiovascular surgeon (Meg Ryan), you
can't really blame a guy for being weary of suffering through Ghost II.
What elevated Angels above the filth I expected was not only terrific
acting performances from the entire cast, but also top-notch technical
work as well.</P>
<P>Cage (ConAir) plays Seth, a worker angel responsible for helping the
newly departed move on to bigger and better places.  Like his
co-workers, Seth dresses in a long black coat (ala Face/Off's Caster
Troy), hangs out at the library (which oddly resembles the building
where Troy hides his Doomsday machine) and watches the sun rise and set
while standing on the beach.</P>
<P>After watching over a dying young girl in the County Hospital, Seth
finds his next assignment under the knife of the lovely Doctor Maggie
Smith (Ryan, Addicted to Love).  As the guy dies, the invisible Seth
stares deep into Maggie's pretty blue eyes (to match her O.R. scrubs)
and is shocked when she stares back and announces that she's not ready
for her patient to be taken yet.  Seth isn't sure if she really saw him,
but he is sure that Maggie is definitely worth a return visit.  Or two.
Hey, the guy does a lot of hospital work.</P>
<P>While Maggie wallows in self- doubt after losing the patient, Seth falls
head over heels.  He eventually makes himself visible to Maggie and the
two seemed headed toward everlasting bliss.  But, Seth is still an angel
– lacking in senses and incapable of emotion.  D'OH!</P>
<P>Seth struggles to decide whether to cast aside his eternal life to
become a real boy.  He gets help and advice from co-worker Cassiel
(Andre Braugher, Homicide) and another heart patient named Nathan
Messinger (Dennis Franz, NYPD Blue).  Meanwhile, Maggie tries to decide
which boy to chase – the mysterious unblinking Seth, or her live-in
doctor boyfriend.  A typical film would have made the boyfriend a
drunken lout, but this guy's only bad traits are being both boring and a
smoker.</P>
<P>Things proceed predictably toward the last reel, when Angels transforms
from a great film to a B movie.  The ending is so awfully written that
it's hard to actually feel anything for the characters.  Earlier scenes
were more successful in playing with my emotions.  In fact, there were
about three decent `cry' spots in the first fifteen minutes, but the
ending just made me want to get up and leave.  It wasn't fair to stick
it on the end of an otherwise flawless picture.</P>
<P>Ryan transcends her pixie-ish cuteness with one of her best performance
ever and Cage is perfectly cast as the confused angel.  Braugher seems
under used in his supporting role, while Franz shines as a spunky
scene-stealer.  Director Brad Silberling (Casper) has made an incredible
transformation from his previous effort and is undoubtedly aided by The
English Patient's Oscar winning team of Cinematographer John Seale and
Composer Gabriel Yared, as well was Production Designer Lilly Kilvert
(Strange Days).  Angels has a strikingly rich and stylish look and, like
most films today, vaunts a hip modern rock soundtrack.  But you should
still see it.  Did I mention that there was a vomiting scene?  Jesus,
what are you waiting for?</P>
