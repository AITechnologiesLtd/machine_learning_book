<P>There's a big difference between knowing the "how" of a situation and
the "why," which is the case in Stir of Echoes, which begins as somewhat
of a ghost story and wraps as a murder mystery. As with an unrelated
earlier flick of this past summer, once again there is a kidlet who
talks to ghosts. A more intriguing bit of background about the boy's
talents seems to have been left in the original novel by Richard
Matheson. It's hinted at in writer/director David Koepp's screenplay,
but those hints are left tantalizingly dangling and, as always, we don't
compare to the Source Material. But we're pretty well intrigued . . .</P>
<P>Stir of Echoes drops us smack in the middle of a nice, law abiding blue
collar Chicago neighborhood. It is the story of PhoneCo. lineman Tom
Witsky (Kevin Bacon), his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and 7 year old son,
Jake (Zachary David Cope). Also in the picture is Maggie's sister Lisa
(Illeana Douglas), whom Tom, to put it kindly, tolerates. One night at a
party, Tom allows Lisa to hypnotize him knowing that he'll probably be
made to prance around like a chicken. That may have been the case but,
when all is done, Tom comes away a different person. He is tormented at
random by dreadful and horrible images -- there's no slice n dice in
this flick but a pair of gruesome fast cuts will make you reel in shock
-- and becomes prescient, sensing things as they are happening or are
about to happen. While these blasts of images seem to foretell the
future, they don't provide enough information to clue him in on what he
can do about it. Net result? Tom goes, to all intents and appearances,
crackers.</P>
<P>They should have seen it coming -- it runs in the family.</P>
<P>The grownups thought kidlet Jake had an "imaginary" friend named
Samantha. But she passes information to Jake that no one could know.
That leads to some very hairy moments when it turns out that Samantha
was real, a neighborhood kid who disappeared some months before. Jake's
got some other abilities, too. He seems to be "connected," seemingly at
random, to strangers. He is on a first name basis with people he has
never met and one of them, one of Chicago's finest, clues Maggie in to
an entire world of "openers," people with connections to the "other
side". Jake is one. So, now, is Tom. And damn if Cranky didn't want to
know more about this aspect of the story, but that is not to be.
The main story of this movie is the total crackup of this lineman for
the county and his link to the girl who disappeared months before. How
it affects his life and threatens his family. David Koepp's script
dangles enough clues in front of you that, with minor effort, you'll see
most of the solution to the mystery coming a ways off. As I wrote
earlier, knowing the how doesn't mean you'll know the why. Stir of
Echoes has enough depth that you'll still be interested in discovering
the details that you haven't copped to earlier. Kevin Bacon's Tom cracks
up beautifully, but Cranky found himself aware that there was just too
much of it, almost as if the story stopped so we could watch the actor
act. Luckily, Kathryn Erbe's Maggie keeps everything on an even keel as
we watch how her loving wife deals with the collapse of everything she's
known.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Stir of Echoes, he would have
paid...</P>
<PRE>$4.50</PRE>
<P>A little less than dateflick level. Overall, Cranky liked Stir of
Echoes, enough to reco a theater ticket though you won't feel cheated if
you wait for pay per view.</P>
