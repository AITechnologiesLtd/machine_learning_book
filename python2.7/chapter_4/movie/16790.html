<PRE>Holy Man</PRE>
<PRE>Starring Eddie Murphy and Jeff Goldblum
Directed By Stephen Herek
Running Time: 1 hour 54 minutes.</PRE>
<PRE>(Touchstone Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Eddie Murphys success continues to baffle. The vulgar and crass The Nutty
Professor (1996) managed to pull in a fortune. The vulgar and desperately
unfunny Doctor Dolittle (1998) again pulled in a huge gross. But Holy Man is
a departure from these films, containing an actual plot and not one fart
joke in sight. Sadly, though, it's not a complete success. Jeff Goldblum is
Ricky Hayman, who tries to sell products through the Good Buy shopping
network, and is failing miserably. Teamed up with Kate Newall (Kelly
Preston) he has to get 8% rise in sales otherwise he's out of the job. At
this time of woe, 'G'  (Murphy) enters his life a religious man who slowly
gets more and more into Ricky's life. Ricky eventually decides that G should
host his own show on the network, and G's religious rantings make an impact
on America saving both the network and Ricky. However, Ricky soon has to
make some moral decisions later on in the film.</P>
<P>I very much doubt writer Tom Schulman was intending an laugh out loud
comedy, but I hope he was going for a below average meandering tale. While
Holy Man has an interesting plot idea, it's badly executed and far too wrung
out. The films ideas run out long before the film itself does. Although
there are some light jabs at existing home shopping networks, and Eddie gets
some good lines, there's something missing to make this amusing. Stephen
Herek is almost lazy with the direction, which doesn't really help. And I
found it difficult to believe that G's talks would get the American public
to buy goods. Their was just no logical explanation for any of it, the
audience is expected to believe that this religious nut would become an
American hero. Still, that's the Wacky World® of Hollywood.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy delivers a nice performance as G, and it's nice to see a calmer
side to Axel Foley. Sadly, he's a bit too calm, and is almost significant in
the movie. Kelly Preston seems to exist as eye candy, with a hopelessly
underwritten role which she gives a far too good performance for. Robert
Loggia turns up as the flustered network boss, and is quite good fun.
There's also celebrity cameos from James Brown and Morgan Fairchild, amongst
others.</P>
<P>But there's one redeeming feature of the whole film, a feature that makes it
impossible to give this movie less than a 2 1/2 star rating. And that
feature is....</P>
<PRE>Jeff Goldblum.</PRE>
<P>Jeff delivers an incredible performance in this movie, heartfelt and very
human. He's natural, witty and just really, really good. Every line he says
has perfect delivery, and his comical face is great. He really deserves the
starring credit in this feature, as he carries the whole film along. In
fact, while my seat was being kicked by impatient 12 year olds who were
expecting another Eddie Murphy fart fest and talking about boys who 'fancy
them' very loudly, I began thinking of films Jeff should of starred in. Just
imagine...</P>
<P>Jeff in The Truman Show (1998): "And, er...if...if..I don't _see_ you, good
afternoon, good..er..evening, and...er..uh-huh.....good...._night._"</P>
<P>Jeff in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981): "Chewy...there's...there's a _snake_
in here. I..er..I hate..snakes."</P>
<PRE>But I digress.</PRE>
<P>Holy Man is only really worth watching if (a) you're hopelessly bored or (b)
you're a BIG Eddie Murphy or Jeff Goldblum fan. Other than that, there's
little to recommend about this film, which misses the mark.</P>
