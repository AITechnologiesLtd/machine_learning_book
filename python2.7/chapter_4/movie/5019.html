<PRE>                          FLIRTING WITH DISASTER
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1996 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: FLIRTING WITH DISASTER is more a
          chain of quirky scenes than a single cohesive film.
          Ben Stiller plays a man, adopted as a child, who
          takes a trip to meet his biological parents.  He
          takes his wife, his baby, and a psychologist intent
          on studying the meeting.  Along the way the
          entourage grows and goes from one grotesque
          situation to the next.  The quirky humor is hit-
          or-miss and generally not quite good enough to make
          up for the off-center feeling of the style.
          Rating: low +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Most novels and most scripts are written first with an overall
plan of what the story is that is going to be told and where is it
going to go.  FLIRTING WITH DISASTER seems to have been written instead
one scene at a time in the faith that when the time comes to write the
next scene that the inspiration will come as to what to put into that
scene and how it should unfold.  To the film's credit, a story did
result without writer (and director) David O. Russell writing himself
into a corner.  And this style of writing has the advantage of keeping
the viewer guessing what is going to happen next, since the author may
very well not know either.  But after the film is over it also leaves
the audience with the uneasy feeling that they do not know where they
have been.  When all is said and done we have seen eggshell-thin
portrayals of a lot of different kinds of characters from many
different walks of life, but nothing to touch the audience and no
reason to care about any of the characters, making a film that is just
vaguely dissatisfying.</P>
<P>     Mel Coplin (played by Ben Stiller) is off on an odyssey to find
his real parents.  Like the original Odyssey it seems at the start like
it should be an easy trip, but Mel finds that it is more arduous than
he expects.  And along the way he travels through whole worlds he never
expected to see close up.  Along on the trip is his fleshy wife Nancy
(Patricia Arquette) and his new-born son, whom Mel hopes to be able to
name after a member of his real family.  Also along is Tina Kalb, a
willowy psychologist (Tea Leoni) sent by the adoption agency  to record
and study the experience.  The first problem: Mel's parents (Mary Tyler
Moore and George Segal) are dead-set against him making the trip and
try every manipulative trick in the parent book to get Mel to give up
the idea.  The traveling companions soon find relations strained with a
temperamental Nancy jealous of the attention that Mel and Tina give
each other.  Relations are further strained when the trip goes weirdly
awry.  The company get to see a lot more of the country than they
bargained for and as more people join the party there are even stranger
relationships to be strained.</P>
<P>     This is the kind of story that Albert Brooks does extremely well.
In fact there are parts of this film that are strongly reminiscent of
Brooks's REAL LIFE and LOST IN AMERICA.  Unfortunately, Russell has a
long way to go before he can match Brooks's wit and his
characterizations.  It is in the characterizations, in fact, that
Russell fails the worst.  Brooks can make his characters likable at the
same time that they are strange and there is often a feeling of
recognition in his people.  Russell has real problems humanizing his
characters.  His people are just a little bit too bizarre and
exaggerated; his humor is just too leaden-handed.  For example, Brooks
would not be likely to have a character rip open her blouse to try to
show her family the benefits of a support bra.  Under Russell's
direction none of the characters has any real human appeal.  They seem
more like dolls getting into funny situations.  The editing by
Christopher Tellefsen is often confusing or just crude, like in an
amateur film.  There also seems to be a very noticeable continuity
error involving a wheel of brie.</P>
<P>     In spite of many bits that were funny, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER just
does not hang together as a film and, in spite of positive critical
comment it has received, rates a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
