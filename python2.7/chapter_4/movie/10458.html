<P>     Of all the reasons I was pleasantly surprised by GOOD WILL HUNTING --
and there were several -- the easiest to identify was its subversive
awareness of its own genre.  The story of a troubled genius named Will
Hunting (Matt Damon) forced to work with emotionally wounded psychiatrist
Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) was ripe for the sort of cathartic
therapeutic hokum which has passed for emotional honesty in films like
ORDINARY PEOPLE or the recent BLISS.  I called long ago for a moratorium
on physician-heal-thyself psychiatrists as a cinematic type; therapy
sessions as revelatory contrivance seemed just as ready for mothballs.</P>
<P>     GOOD WILL HUNTING can't possibly steer clear of every pitfall
associated with therapy-centered drama, but it's conscious enough of those
pitfalls to provide a goofy sense of originality.  The script, by Damon
and his co-star and real-life buddy Affleck, keeps the dialogue between
Will and Sean generally smart and smart-alecky (particularly sharp was a
pastoral scene which Will describes as a "Taster's Choice moment between
the guys").  The arc of their relationship is convincing and patiently
developed, with Williams and Damon sharing an impressive chemistry.  In
fact, chemistry defines the cast from top to bottom -- Will's friendships
with his working-class chums, his romance with a British Harvard student
(Minnie Driver), and even Sean's contentious friendship with the MIT
professor (Stellan Skarsgaard) who envies Will's gift.  The performances
are consistently strong enough (even Robin Williams in his "bearded, ergo
serious" mode) to carry GOOD WILL HUNTING through its inevitable dips into
confrontation, as well as a running time which could have used a judicious
twenty minutes of trimming.</P>
<P>     Strongest of all is Damon himself in a dazzlingly charismatic piece
of screen acting.  Both believably brilliant and convincingly rough around
the edges, Damon avoids the too-common actor's trap of white-washing his
character's dark side.  That dubious distinction, unfortunately, goes to
director Gus Van Sant, who turns Will's primary surge of violence into a
slow-motion ballet, undercutting the character's pent-up rage.  It's too
conventional an instinct for a director who has rarely done anything the
conventional way, offering Damon a protection he simply doesn't need.  As
both actor and writer, Matt Damon gives GOOD WILL HUNTING energy, soul and
a welcome desire to avoid trite situations.  It's a rare drama which
satisfies without pandering, a feel-good, heal-good session which gives
you just a little hope that every trip to the couch doesn't have to be a
trip into Cliche-Land.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Hunting trips:  7.</PRE>
