<PRE>                                    HAMLET
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Lavish production made by the
          numbers.  The film has major actors, is beautifully
          filmed, but in spite of a great swashbuckling
          sword-fight at the end fails to breathe life into
          its play the way MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING did.  Its
          biggest attraction is that it covers the entire
          play.  There are serious logic problems implicit in
          Branagh's choice of setting.  Rating: low +2 (-4 to
          +4)  This review contains minor spoilers for those
          unfamiliar with the play.  I suppose there must be
          somebody out there.
          New York Critics: 3 positive, 0 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     Kenneth Branagh has now directed his third Shakespeare film.  His
HENRY V surprised all by being a vivid and powerful adaptation that
transcended the frequent language barrier that some feel seeing
Shakespeare's plays.  Branagh managed this by putting more modern
intonation into the words and by just plain good acting.  His MUCH ADO
ABOUT NOTHING proved to be a joyful romp that was even more
approachable than HENRY V.  It demonstrated that Shakespeare comedies
could really be made as enjoyable and even as funny as most modern
comedies being produced.  For his third Shakespeare adaptation Branagh
decided to make his most ambitious film to date, an unabridged HAMLET.
Until now his Shakespeare films have been abridged to fit the standard
screentime of two hours or less.  And while HENRY V had the exciting
Battle of Agincourt and MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING was a light and frothy
comedy, HAMLET is much more weighty and cerebral.  The producers asked
would audiences accept sitting through a four-hour film adaptation of a
tragedy?  Well, they would not have to.  Two versions would be
released: a limited full-length version for the few who would be
willing sit through the whole thing and a faster-moving version edited
down to two and a half hours.  What happened must have startled the
film distributors and undermined the old truism that nobody every went
broke underestimating the intelligence of the public.  What was
discovered was there was almost no market for the peppier abridged
version.  Had the shorter version been the only film made the public
would likely have flocked to it, but just about anybody erudite enough
to want to see the short version actually preferred to see the full
play performed.  After nearly a century of cutting down Shakespeare
plays to make versions the public would want to see--Shakespeare films
go back as least as far as the 1899 KING JOHN--it turned out that the
public really did not want their Shakespeare cut down for them.  This
discovery may affect many Shakespeare film productions to come.  So
even before its release HAMLET had broken new ground.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, that new ground is among the precious little
innovation this new version of HAMLET gives us.  Not that it is not an
estimable film, but unfortunately it is not so much ingenious as just
highly competent.  Branagh has assembled a terrific cast, particularly
considering the cameo roles, and created a lavish and beautiful
production that is at the same time just a bit dull and safe.  This is
a surprisingly unsurprising adaptation particularly since it is coming
from the innovative Kenneth Branagh.  The only major creative touch--
beyond telling the whole story--is to move the setting to the late 19th
Century.  A year earlier when Ian McKellan moved RICHARD III to Britain
in the 1930s, he chose a time which many of us could actually picture
and for which we had rich associations.  He chose a time when similar
events could have almost taken place in Britain and were actually
taking place in Germany.  But Branagh's change of setting is
comparatively pointless.  The public has few associations with his
chosen setting beyond perhaps the plays of Strindberg and Ibsen in
other parts of Scandinavia.  Branagh's recreation of this time and
place is a time impressive and perhaps a bit exaggerated and overdone.
A major setting is a huge mirrored palace ballroom equipped to drop a
blizzard of white confetti to celebrate the first, rather prosaic,
pronouncements of the new king.  This may be spectacle, but it is
unnecessary and overdone.  The film, set in the harsh Danish winter, is
being distributed at the height of a particularly harsh American winter
when the viewer may well ask himself, "Isn't there enough ice and cold
in the world without having to pay to see it on the screen?"  For
visual effect Branagh has moved the story to the Danish winter in spite
of the play having Ophelia find fresh flowers and unfrozen water late
in the story.  Also the setting calls for an unstrung Ophelia to be
committed to an oppressive asylum, but without comment from any of the
characters she seems to be able to escape it not unlike DRACULA's
Renfield.  Is this what Shakespeare intended?  But then, frequently the
visuals contradict the play.  A character who supposedly has found "a
muddy death" is found floating in clear water.  A scene in which the
ghost is said to turn in a start shows no such action from the ghost.</P>
<P>     Branagh's great talent for use of modern inflection to make
Shakespeare understandable is somehow missing here from his
performance.  This is never more clear than in an exchange with that
great Shakespearean, Billy Crystal, playing the gravedigger.  It is
surprising how much easier it is to follow Crystal's end of the
conversation.  Crystal seems a little out place, but less so than
Michael Keaton was in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and his diction is
plainer and easier to understand than Branagh's by far.  At times
Branagh races through his speeches as if his goal is to get to the
other side.  While we are on the subject of famous comedians in smaller
roles, Robin Williams who discusses Shakespearean acting in DEAD POETS
SOCIETY gets a chance to do some as Osiric.  For once he is reasonably
restrained and while his fans may be disappointed he really should not
be the focus in his scenes and he shows commendable control.  Derek
Jacobi plays the new king with quiet dignity and few strong emotions
though why the queen should prefer him to his brother Old Hamlet (Brian
Blessed) is never convincingly clarified.  Julie Christie begins with
the same quiet dignity, but of course her role improves as the story
progresses and as an actress she takes full advantage.  Other small
roles go to the likes of Charleton Heston, Jack Lemmon, and Gerard
Depardieu to no strong effect.</P>
<P>     Branagh has a taste for the visually over-dramatic particularly on
scenes that feature him.  He holds the intermission until the end of
Act 4, Scene 4, very late in the play, so that he can bring the break
with what comes the closest to the usually-vacillating Hamlet giving
something approaching a stirring speech.  Trying to recapture some of
the fire of Henry V doing the St. Crispin's Day speech, he has Hamlet
giving the soliloquy on a field of ice and stone to a camera tracking
back and back from him.  Hot dang, that's dramatic!  Later he self-
indulgently has himself carried from the floor of the palace in a
Christ-like pose.  Once again Patrick Doyle provides the music, though
rarely with the effect of the pre-intermission sequence.  His music is
used to a much lesser degree than in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, perhaps
because of the more thoughtful nature of the themes.  Sadly the score
is not particularly original or exciting and like Branagh his newer
efforts are strongly reminiscent of his earlier work.</P>
<P>     By its very completeness, Kenneth Branagh's HAMLET will probably
be the definitive version for our generation and beyond.  It stands
head and shoulders above the 1990 Franco Zefferelli version that
starred Mel Gibson.  It probably even outshines the Laurence Olivier
version.  But this was Branagh's opportunity to make what is probably
the most celebrated play of the most celebrated playwright.  As such it
is something of a disappointment and is certainly the least artful and
most overdone of the three Branagh- directed Shakespeare films.  It is
a flawed adaptation, but still probably the best cinematic theatrical
release of Shakespeare's HAMLET.  I rate it a low +2  on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
