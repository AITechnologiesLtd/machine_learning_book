<PRE>HOUSE OF GAMES (1987)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: David Mamet
Writer: David Mamet (story by Mamet and Jonathan Katz)
Starring: Lindsay Crouse, Joe Mantegna, Mike Nussbaum, Lilia Skala, Ricky
Jay, J. T. Walsh, Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Meshach Taylor, William
H. Macy</P>
<P>"House of Games" recognizes a distinct human weakness that we all suffer
from: the need to feel like you're smarter than everyone else.  I remember
not too long ago being in a chinese restaurant with a friend, and she told
me she was going to steal the ash tray at our table when the cooks weren't
looking.  I asked her why she wanted to that; she didn't even smoke.  She
just gave me a bad look and shoved the thing in her bag, and then cooly
left the building.  Hmm...</P>
<P>This film deals with people who do this kind of stuff for a living, and on
a much more dramatic scale.  The main characters in this film are the
infamous people known as confidence men, who are all flawless actors who
fool people out of something, whether it be money or just their wits.  The
writer and director of this film, David Mamet, one of the world's great
playwrights, is himself a magician, another form of the confidence man, who
just loves to play with people, and here has made a downright fascinating
magic trick that cons the audience perfectly with such an incredible
illusion that it soon opens the film up to even more incredible depths that
few suspense films have ever tread upon.</P>
<P>"House of Games" deals with a psychiatrist, Margaret Ford (Mamet's
then-wife, Lindsay Crouse), who deals primarily with compulsions, and has
just had a book published when she discovers that one of her patients, a
compulsive gambler, has just gotten himself in a big trap: he owes 25 grand
to a man who says that if he doesn't pay by the next day, he will murder
him.  Margaret journeys across town to the place where the man hangs out,
called "The House of Games," where she meets this man, Mike (a brilliant
Joe Mantegna), and sees if she can get him to help her friend out.</P>
<P>Mike, who has never heard something like this, decides to cut her a deal:
she helps him find the "tell" on a man he is playing poker with in the next
room, and if he wins, her friend's marker is torn up.  From here on out, it
would be totally unfair to reveal anymore of what happens plot-wise, but
let's just say she gets sucked into the world of conning and deceiving,
where the whole idea is that you con someone out of their money in the most
elaborate way possible so that they have little or no doubt that they were
duped.  After all, what use is stealing money from someone if they know
they were tricked?</P>
<P>Basically, this film is one big con from start to finish because nothing
that it shows us is real and it knows it.  It leads us through what seems
to be high drama, then pulls the rug out from under us and shows us that we
were totally duped, which shouldn't be a real shock to anyone who's seen
his latest film, "The Spanish Prisoner," and has yet to see this film
(which was me up to a couple of hours ago).  Both films feature elaborate
con games that fool the protagonist with twist upon twist upon twist, and
in turn, probably also fool the audience as well.</P>
<P>Yet this film is still remarkably intelligent and fresh and a whole lot
better than most films that try to do what this film does.  Why is it so
intelligent and fresh?  Well, it's intelligent because it never takes us
for morons, and instead sets up such a lavish ploy that anyone of any kind
of intelligence can be easily duped by it.  Everything we see seems totally
real and there's really no proof of fraud until you see everything for what
it really is.  That's why it's such a smart movie.</P>
<P>And it's fresh because it's not just always thinking about what it will do
next and stays two steps ahead of the audience, but also because it's
remarkably deep for any film.  Basically, "House of Games" is about
watching movies, making this a subtlely self-reflexive film.  There's a
scene towards the end that has to be one of the most kafkaesque scenes I
have witnessed (later sorta copied for a later scene in "The Game," another
ingenius con game), and is basically saying that this is all an act we are
watching, and none of this is real, which sets it up for the finale which
could be seen as cheap if it weren't so intelligent and deep.  It's pretty
much one of the reactions someone could have to this film, basically
because it can be seen as manipulative.</P>
<P>"House of Games" is brilliant, though, because it can easily and almost
effortlessly con the viewers into thinking like the psychiatrist
protagonist, and because it's practically a tragedy of two types of people
in the world.  The chief con man of the film, Mike, is one of the saddest
characters to ever populate a movie because he's all an illusion and he has
no delusions about what he is (or isn't).  And the second tragic figure is
Margaret, the woman who tries to delude herself about a simple human folly,
and tries to make herself out to be something better than everyone else is,
even in the final frame of the film.  "House of Games" is electrifying
because it's so refreshingly smart, and so enigmatically deep about
humanity.  And what a con.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ****</PRE>
