<PRE>                               JACOB'S LADDER
                       A film review by N. P. Rousseau
                        Copyright 1990 N. P. Rousseau</PRE>
<P>(The following is probably only for people seriously obsessed with
JACOB'S LADDER, and definitely only for people who have seen the
movie.)</P>
<P>     "If you're afraid of dying, and you're holdin' on, you'll see
devils tearin' your life away.  But if you've made your peace, then the
devils are really angels, freein' you from the world.  It all depends on
how you look at it."  For me, these words spoken by Louie (Danny
Aiello), and paraphrasing Meister Eckhart are at the heart of the movie.</P>
<P>     Bruce Joel Rubin (writer and associate producer) sets up the story
in such a way that we need only accept two relatively tame ideas in
order to accept the movie as a whole.  First, dreams can seem real
enough to be confused with reality, and second, very long dream time can
take place in very short real time.  Though this may give Rubin and
Adrian Lyne (director) a Teflon shovel, by allowing them to simply
attribute any inconsistency to the inconsistent nature of dreams, I'd
argue that they don't include anything in the film unworthy of serious
consideration and analysis.</P>
<P>     Most reviews I've read throw out references to "An Occurrence at
Owl Creek Bridge," as if to say Rubin's idea is unoriginal.  Many
Shakespearean plays involve a confusion of dreams and reality (A
MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, for example) and since Shakespeare stole almost
all his plots, maybe originality shouldn't be the issue.  Good artists
borrow, great artists steal.  Rubin, like Shakespeare may simply be
taking an idea that "oft was thought, But n'er so well expressed."</P>
<P>     While flashbacks have long been standard fare in literature and
film, the one aspect of "Owl Creek" that might be considered original is
its use of flash-forward.  William Golding (Nobel Prize in Literature,
1983) uses a similar technique in his novel FREE FALL.  The main
character in Golding's novel is only alive for a few minutes, during an
unsuccessful parachute jump.  From the moment he realizes his chute
won't open, the book becomes a flash-forward in the mind of the
protagonist, similar to "Owl Creek."  Suffice it to say that these ideas
have been around, and the question remains, what do Rubin and Lyne do
with them?</P>
<P>     In the book of Genesis, Jacob, the younger son of Isaac has a
vision of a ladder between heaven and earth, on which angels ascend and
descend.  With a single biblical phrase, Rubin sets up the major premise
of the movie.  We're stuck on earth, we won't be here forever, where do
we go next, and how do we get there?  Again, Rubin's not the first to
use this metaphor, but since Calvin's references to Jacob's Ladder
seldom involve LSD, this could be a new angle on an old symbol.</P>
<P>     The Ladder may just be our ticket from here to eternity, but to
eternal what?  The hippie chemist's ladder takes us straight down to the
primal fear, the base anger, while Gabe's staircase at the end of the
movie seems to have a brighter destination.  With this dichotomy in
place, the trick seems to be to be able to tell the difference between
up and down, or heaven and hell, since as Louie tells us, the devils
might really be angels, or vice-versa, depending on how you look at it.
Since Meister Eckhart and Woody Allen haven't solved this problem, we're
likely to be sympathetic with Jacob's (Tim Robbins) predicament.</P>
<P>     Jacob's son Gabe, with a name reminiscent of Gabriel, the messenger
angel seems to wear a white hat (after all, he's the only son with light
hair, and the only one without a spherical, bloated, demonic face).  He
asks Jacob to tuck him in, tells him not to go back to bed with Sarah,
and has Jacob leave the door open, a little more.</P>
<P>     Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena) pretty much wears only black, as we might
picture her biblical namesake.  She's a "heathen," who doesn't go much
for church names, and tells us that Jacob is with her because he sold
his soul for a good lay.  Faust sells his soul for knowledge, while
Jacob seems to sell his to be spared knowledge, with its pain and
responsibility.  Jezzie is often kind and comforting to Jacob, but also
seems to have a dark side.  Following the "Who *are* you?!" scene, she
tells Jacob he can rot, and she's present in the hospital in hell scene,
even preparing the syringe for his forehead.  In her last scene with
Jacob, she pleads with him not to go to talk with the hippie chemist,
the act which finally allows Jacob to "make his peace, freeing him from
the earth."</P>
<P>     Louie wears white, has a bright, circular light over his shoulder,
and looks like an overgrown cherub.  In fact, he looks like an angel, as
Jacob tells him every time he sees him.  Louie is the only source of
stability and sanity in Jacob's jump-cut life.  He goes to Louie when
things are out of alignment, and Louie straightens them out.  Louie's a
life saver, and he knows it.  He even rescues Jacob from the hospital in
hell.  So why is he named for the very first angel to descend the Ladder
from heaven to hell?  Just coincidence, I guess.  (You could never
convince me that a single name in this script was not considered and
reconsidered ad nauseum, so that while possible, coincidences are rather
unlikely, as are other chronological and logistical inconsistencies).</P>
<P>     We're willing to believe that Jacob, on his deathbed, and with the
possible assistance of the chemically isolated dark side of LSD (BZ, if
you prefer) could invent a believable, post-Vietnam life for himself.
In dream-time, it could last six years, or the time between leaving
Vietnam, and getting a call from Paul Grunigan, his similarly-spooked
battalion buddy.</P>
<P>     What helps me buy post-Vietnam life with Jezzie, and working at the
Post Office is that he might have started working there and met Jezzie
before going to Vietnam.  We know that he spent six years studying for
his Ph.D., and then went to work for the Post Office, thereby angering
his wife Sarah enough to throw him out.  ("What can I tell ya, Louie?
After Nam I just didn't want to think.")  Jacob might have invented
Jezzie and the Post Office out of thin air, or possibly they were based
only on the knowledge that he was having marital trouble with his wife,
and that when he got back from Vietnam, he wanted to find a job where he
didn't have to think.</P>
<P>     But if he knew something about working at a Post Office, and had at
least met Jezzie before Vietnam, then his elaboration on these two items
into the post-Vietnam life he envisions, seems more plausible.  Could he
have worked in a Post Office part-time, to earn a little extra money as
a graduate student, met Jezzie, and then while in Vietnam, reflected on
the blissful mindlessness of the Post Office?  The scene in bed with
Sarah would then take on the quality of a memory, rather than a
dream--while living with Sarah, and working at the Post Office before
Vietnam he had had a dream about living with Jezzie (or cheated on Sarah
in his mind, as she puts it--a nightmare, burning with ice and guilty
thoughts).  Later on, during his dying moments in Vietnam, he
elaborates on his memory of this dream and comes up with the whole
post-Vietnam dream.</P>
<P>     I admit that this Post-Office-before-Vietnam theory is not wholly
satisfying (for one thing it takes some of the punch out of that line
about not wanting to think after Nam, if he'd worked at the Post Office
before Vietnam, presumably for different reasons).  What I like about
this theory, though, is that it sets up a consistent formula where
things from the real world--facts, events, people--are used as
springboards for Jacob's elaborated dream world.  For instance, sometime
before the battle, Jacob has considered getting a mindless job after he
returns, leaving his wife, going to see a chiropractor about his back
pain, and as a philosopher, thought about heaven, hell, and the
afterlife.  These real world thoughts are the fuel for his dream world.</P>
<P>     Even after the battle, and Jacob's stabbing, elements from the real
world enter his dream world.  Lying on his back, staring up at faces
from the dance floor of a Brooklyn apartment is like lying on the jungle
floor, looking up at the faces of his rescuers.  The disco light shining
in his eyes from the apartment ceiling is like the sun in his eyes as
he's waiting for, and ultimately hoisted up to, the helicopter.  Having
a 106 degree fever, and going into shock in the bathtub is like the
shock and fever he'd be likely to experience with an abdominal bayonet
wound.  Being jostled around and beaten up in the car with the D.O.D.
goons is like the helicopter ride to the mobile army surgical hospital.
And finally, the circular lamp over the couch in Louie's office is like
the surgical lamp over the operating table, in the final death scene
(also like the lamp over the operating table in the hospital in hell
scene).</P>
<P>     We're less willing to believe that facts, events, and people in
Jacob's elaborated dream world in 1971 match up with real world facts
after 1971.  For instance, that a real song from circa 1975 (Voulez-vous
coucher avec moi), or a real baseball card from circa 1973 (Rich
Gossage) could be part of Jacob's deathbed dream in 1971.  Other
chronology problems include Gabe writing a letter to Jacob in Vietnam
(the one Jacob takes out of the cigar box), when Jezzie reveals to us
that Gabe died before Jacob went to Vietnam.  The last problem could be
explained by something like Jacob shipping off to boot camp, receiving
the letter from Gabe, Gabe dying, and Jacob shipping off to Vietnam,
depending on how far you're willing to stretch things.</P>
<P>     Logistical problems include why was he drafted at all, at roughly
twenty-eight (twenty-two after college, plus six years of graduate
school), with a wife and two (or three) kids?  Why was he only a Private
First Class with all his education (although the degree in the cigar box
was only for a Masters, not a Ph.D.--maybe he never finished his Ph.D.)?
How come the D.O.D. goons who were hassling Jacob and his battalion
buddies hadn't hassled or even killed the hippie chemist, who knew the
whole story and obviously had the most damaging evidence against the
army?  Since the last problem occurs only in the dream world, you could
argue that it doesn't need to make real world sense.</P>
<P>     The entire scene with the hippie chemist is a little hard to take,
all at once.  It's reminiscent of the scene in ANGEL HEART around the
boiling cauldron of gumbo, where Mickey Rourke is forced to confront
similarly painful facts about his past.  In the ANGEL HEART scene, lines
like "elaborate incantations in Latin and Greek" just don't ring true,
and similarly in JACOB'S LADDER, lines like "it was starting to get ugly
in the States.  Hell, you remember" and "a bad trip, and believe me,
I've had my share, could not compare to the fury of the ladder" don't
live up to the consistently good dialogue throughout the rest of the
movie, and tend to sound written, rather than spoken.</P>
<P>     The hippie chemist scene was a tough one.  We had to empathize with
the chemist and Jacob, and process a lot of information and chronology,
all in about three minutes.  Rubin set himself up a monumental task, and
the degree to which he succeeded is arguable.  The scenes that follow
this one, however are even more challenging, and here Rubin seems in his
element.  The cab ride ("Where's your home?"), Sam the doorman ("Dr.
Singer.  It's been a long time."), the empty apartment, teeming with
life (protractor, compass, apple pie, and television snow), the thunder
storm, the "Sonny Boy" melody drifting in from the music box in the
hallway, and THE SOUND OF SOLAR WINDS all lead up to Jacob's discovery
of Gabe at the foot of the stairs.  Rubin, Lyne, and Maurice Jarre
(music) all collaborate to create a moment at this reunion of father and
son that either crystallizes or shatters everything that came before it.
As the spiral of Gabe's staircase becomes the spiral of the fluorescent
surgical lamp, we are either prepared for the final revelation, or we're
not.  It worked for me, but I can see where some might be lost on the
ascent.  The lights are bright, the solar winds loud, and the height is
dizzying.</P>
