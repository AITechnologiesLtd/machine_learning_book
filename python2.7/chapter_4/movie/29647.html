<P>PLOT:
Derek Zoolander is a male model. He is also very dumb and impressionable. For
that reason, he is secretly hired and trained (so secret, that even he doesn't
know about it) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime
minister of Malaysia, who wants to abolish child labor in his country. Will
Zoolander fulfill the dirty deed? Will Zoolander ever grace the world his new
"look"? Is this a funny movie? Find out below...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
There's a place in our world for "stupid comedies". Films which don't pretend to
take themselves seriously, are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb
jokes. There's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult
period of our history, might be an ideal circumstance during which to "relax" by
watching something so completely frivolous. Well, if you're in the mood for some
seriously mindless entertainment, Ben Stiller and his cast of many have
assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time. Of course,
comedies as such are usually very subjective and I could see how some will see
this film simply as stupid and unfunny, while others will grant them the
"stupid", but consider it funny instead. I personally enjoyed it for the most
part, cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the
Derek Zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the
fashion industry. Snap! It was also nice to see several real-life models with
small roles in the movie, not taking themselves too seriously. And if you're the
type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films, well, don't look any further
because dozens of famous faces show up here including Vince Vaughn, Billy Zane,
Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, David Duchovny, Natalie Portman and many, many
others. I especially liked Andy Dick's complete make-over as the masseuse.
Hi-larious!</P>
<P>But with all films of this type, there is bound to be some stuff that simply
doesn't work. A few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the
bulimia and "orgy" sequence with Christine Taylor, the break-dance fighting, and
I also never get why they use real countries in plots like this (why not just
"make up" a country, instead of zeroing in on a certain people?). I also could
have done with less of the Taylor character in general, since she wasn't all
that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then (more
Zoolander, dude!). But those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the
more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me! I almost pissed myself
during the "gas station" disaster, absolutely adored the "walk-off" contest
(with David Bowie as the judge, no less) and appreciated many of Zoolander's
moronic one-liners ("I was a Merman...a Merman!!"). And I dare you to get his
"monkey" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ("You're a monkey,
Derek...a monkey!") I also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film,
both of which zipped and zagged, and established a nice rhythm to it all. Again,
it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone, but my guess is that
if you laughed at the trailer, you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the
actual picture as well. If you thought the trailer was dumb, skip this dodo bird
and go rent AUSTIN POWERS again or something, a film from which there is an
obvious influence here. Blue Steel, baby...yeah!!!</P>
