<P>*Note: FRAT HOUSE will appear on HBO in the spring as a presentation of
"HBO Undercover"</P>
<P>     I've known many men and women over the years who were members of
Greek organizations in college.  I have heard their decisions to pledge
defended with terms like "service," "networking," or "fellowship."
However, the most brutally honest explanation I've ever heard comes from
one unnamed student in the Sundance Grand Prize winning documentary FRAT
HOUSE:  "It's about finding the people you enjoy getting f*****d up with
most."</P>
<P>     FRAT HOUSE doesn't spend much time on the question of why peole join
fraternities and sororities, perhaps limited by a television-restricted
running time.  It aroused my interest enough that I was disappointed to
find that issue unexplored, but ultimately Todd Phillips and Andrew
Gurland's goal was to show _what_ people join when they join fraternities
and sororities.  However, though their footage of hazing, strippers,
binge-drinking and humiliation has "expose'" written all over it, I'd be
lying if I said I was surprised by anything I saw in FRAT HOUSE.  The film
depicts college-age males in all their testosterone-fuelled glory,
reveling in their ability to dominate others in the name of "brotherhood,"
homophobic epithet-slinging and the pursuit of women (though the fairer
gender is more frequently referred to with a five-letter anatomical slang
synonymous with "feline").  I saw enough in my own college days to reach
the point where nothing a drunken, misogynistic 19-year-old does or says
will shock me.</P>
<P>     What _is_ shocking and surprising is the fact that Phillips and
Gurland were able to capture this behavior on film.  The notoriously
secretive nature of Greek initiation was laid bare thanks to an East
Carolina University fraternity member, lovingly known as Blossom.  A
thick-headed ogre of a human being, Blossom tells all and shows all to the
film-makers with the arrogant disregard of someone whose worldview
revolves around the complete absence of consequences.  Only when it
becomes clear that his brethren have gotten cold feet does Blossom
summarily (and psychotically) dismiss Phillips and Gurland, with a slap in
the face for good measure.</P>
<P>     While FRAT HOUSE is certainly a testemonial to male bonding at its
ugliest, it may be even more effective as a testemonial to the
determination of the film-makers.  After losing their "in" at ECU,
Phillips and Gurland managed to find another fraternity willing to open
its doors on condition of anonymity.  There was one other condition as
well:  the film-makers themselves would be obliged to go through
everything the pledges went through.  Thus began a nightmarish six weeks
during which the two directors would be subjected to verbal abuse, sleep
deprivation, punishing and pointless boot camp-style exercise, open
flames, and several activities which suggest the brothers were spending
_far_ more time dreaming up creative tortures than they were on academia.
Never has the pain of creating a film gelled as smoothly with the subject
of the film itself.</P>
<P>     It doesn't do justice to the quality of FRAT HOUSE as a piece of
film-making to focus entirely on the hard work of Phillips and Gurland.
Their instincts for making their subject entertaining are impressive,
notably in a hilarious juxtaposition of one sorority's "Hell Night"
(composed primarily of sobbing through a lyrically-amended version of
"Through the Years") with the fraternal equivalent.  FRAT HOUSE is worth
watching not just because the subject matter is sensational, though that
may draw some concerned parents.  Its real achievement is creating a
record of the kind of ridiculous, frightening and grimly hysterical 
behavior everyone already knows goes on college campuses across the
country; it's the realest "Real World" episode you'll ever see.  Credit
Phillips and Gurland with going the extra mile to show that reality to the
world.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 brothers in harm:  9.</PRE>
