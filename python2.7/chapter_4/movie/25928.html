<PRE>WOMAN ON TOP
A film review by Robert Strohmeyer
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>Once in a very great while a motion picture comes along to captivate the
minds and spirits of audiences everywhere, magically suspending
disbelief in all who witness it. And, though it tries earnestly, Woman
on Top is not that picture.</P>
<P>I love movies. In particular, I hunger for films that invite me into a
world beyond the limits of mundane, material, daily existence. While
Woman on Top deserves some credit for its fresh, innocent effort to make
this invitation, it is disappointingly infantile once we all get to the
party.</P>
<P>It's not for lack of a talented cast, or good screenwriting, or even
smart directing, that this movie fails to charm. All the ingredients for
wonderment are here, they're just poorly blended.</P>
<P>Isabella (Penelope Cruz) is a vibrant young Brazilian woman with a
talent for cooking. (Note: the film is in English.) After marriage, she
and her good-timing husband, Toninho (Murilo Benício), open a restaurant
in Bahia, where Toninho basks in the glory created by Isabella's unseen
labors in the kitchen. Otherwise, apparently, he's quite charming. But
Isabella can't be stifled, she can't be put down. She is, after all, a
woman on top, which is just how she likes it.</P>
<P>Alas, however, poor Toninho is too manly to be on the bottom every time,
even if it does take less work. To satisfy his need for the dominant
position, among other things, he climbs out the bedroom window in the
still of night and into the bed of his next-door neighbor.</P>
<P>Naturally, Isabella wakes up minutes later and, finding her husband
missing, does what any sensible woman would do: walks right over to the
neighbor's apartment, lets herself in, and catches that cheating bastard
red, er, handed. Then dear Isabella does some little Santeria
prayer-thingie and jets off to San Francisco, where there is only one
cab driver and she is a lesbian Rastafarian who works all hours and will
let you drive yourself around for a hundred bucks. (Which is good
because Isabella is such a sociopathic control freak that she not only
needs to be on top every time she makes the lovin', she also can't ride
as a passenger in any vehicle without spraying orange salsa puke all
over the street--which, by the way, happens repeatedly in this film.)</P>
<P>"Okay," I say to myself, quietly so as not to disturb the other people
in the theater, "This is a fantasy film. It's a magical romance, full of
whimsy and my God! How did they manage to drive down Lombard Street at
45 miles an hour without waiting in that 30 minute line first?" But I
accepted this, went with the flow so to speak, and shut my mouth.</P>
<P>Once she arrives at her destination, she is informed by an old man that
her friend Monica (Harold Perrineau, Jr., from HBO's Oz), the fabulous
drag queen who invited her in the first place, is "detained." By which
he means incarcerated. They don't say why, but I like to assume that
she's a twenty-dollar Tenderloin streetwalker. Again, though, the
fantastic bubble bursts when Monica steps out the door of the prison to
find Isabella waiting for her in front of historic Fort Mason! The
Golden Gate stands majestically in the background as they hug
enthusiastically and here begins the continuous downhill slide of this
brazenly idiotic attempt at magical realism.</P>
<P>Now, I can already hear about a hundred of you out there clacking away
at your keyboards to write me hate spam and accuse me of having no
heart, or whatever it is critics are supposed to have but don't. So let
me reiterate: I love movies. In particular, I love magical realism. But
if you want to see a finely crafted work of this sort, go rent Like
Water for Chocolate or even A Pyromaniac's Love Story and see how the
grown-ups do it.</P>
<P>In fairness, many of you who don't live in San Francisco probably won't
notice the tremendous liberties taken with the city's geography. But it
doesn't stop there. Woman on Top takes liberties with everything. There
is no foundation, no realism to work magic on. The characters are hollow
and daft. They fall in and out of love like children. They're well
acted, but poorly sustained by the material, though the script isn't
terrible; it's often incredibly funny. What really seems to be missing
here is the maturity to create continuity within the fantasy-something
even Saturday cartoons try to do.</P>
<P>Okay, so back when Isabella was stifled away in the kitchen of Toninho's
restaurant in Bahia, master chefs the world over had stopped in, dined,
recognized her talent, and offered her jobs. Now, in San Francisco,
she's calling them on their offers. But alas, they don't remember her
and she's out of luck. She can't even land a job at a fish and chips
place because she insists on making the butter spicy. She is, after all,
a hot Latin lady.</P>
<P>So she gets a job teaching at a culinary school, performs some more
Santeria rituals to fall out of love with her husband, and makes herself
some coffee, the scent of which is so delectably powerful that her
neighbor across the street, a local television producer, falls madly in
love with her and follows her to work. It must have been some potent
java, because by the time she actually arrives at the cooking school she
is being trailed by a hundred men.</P>
<P>Cliff, the TV producer (Mark Feuerstein), is so smitten that sets her up
with her own prime time cooking show, which becomes the talk of the
town. Toninho flies to San Francisco, where the only cabbie in town
picks him up and drives him around in search of his love. Madcap
craziness ensues, and they all live happily ever after.</P>
<P>Warning: viewing this film may be hazardous to your intelligence.</P>
