<P>Ambitious, ingenious and visually breathtaking, "Pleasantville" is a 
rarity in contemporary filmmaking; a fully-realized vision that succeeds 
on multiple levels. Writer and director Gary Ross has crafted a wondrous 
experience that satisfies as a comedy, a fantasy, a drama and a parable. 
Movies don't get much better than this.</P>
<P>Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play disaffected '90s teenagers 
magically whisked into "Pleasantville," a black and white '50s TV sitcom 
reminiscent of "Father Knows Best." Like Connecticut Yankees in Robert 
Young's Court, their presence has drastic effects on this safe, sanitized 
community, where books are blank, toilets don't exist and even married 
couples sleep in separate beds. </P>
<P>As the citizens of Pleasantville discover art, sex and the concept of 
nonconformity, bursts of color appear in their monochromatic world. In 
short order, color begins to spread like a virus through the town, and 
while many are enthralled by the changes, others are angered by what they 
perceive as a threat to their way of life. Soon, the patriarchal power 
structure organizes, determined to rid Pleasantville of the curse of 
color.</P>
<P>First-time director Gary Ross, who wrote "Big" and "Dave," handles this 
challenging material with a sure, steady hand. Easing into the story with 
reassuring comedy, he maintains a gentle tone even as the film graduates 
into drama, addressing serious issues without ever becoming ponderous. 
Legendary director Frank Capra would surely be delighted to see the proud 
tradition of "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" 
carried on in a film of this caliber. </P>
<P>"Pleasantville" is a deeply humane, spiritual film with an uplifting 
message that couldn't have come at a better time. These are dark days for 
our society. Recently, we've seen a man dragged behind a truck because of 
the color of his skin and a college student savagely beaten and left on a 
fence to die because of his sexual orientation. Conservative groups 
brandish the Bible like a weapon, using the mask of "family values" in a 
vain attempt to disguise their message of hate.</P>
<P>The more fearful citizens of Pleasantville exhibit the same behavior. As 
an increasing percentage of the populace changes from black and white to 
color, the result of embracing freedom and diversity to realize their 
potential, conservatives put signs in their windows reading "No Coloreds 
Allowed." When housewife Joan Allen embraces her sexuality and sees her 
pallid skin change to rich color, she panics. Fearing the wrath of her 
family and community, she tries to go "back in the closet" by covering 
her skin with monochrome makeup. Thankfully, she learns that once you've 
realized your God-given nature, it's wrong to live a lie. </P>
<P>The symbolism and messages in "Pleasantville" aren't subtle: Ross chose 
not to work that way. "This movie is about the fact that personal 
repression gives rise to larger political oppression," he said in an 
interview. "That when we're afraid of certain things in ourselves or 
we're afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a 
lot of very ugly social situations can develop."</P>
<P>If this all sounds awfully heavy, rest assured that the film is far from 
a two hour exercise in tubthumbing. Ross imbues the film with a lilting, 
lyrical feel, many humorous and touching moments, and absolutely 
remarkable visuals. From the image of a single red rose set against a 
black and white background to the visage of a gray-scale youth gazing at 
a gloriously colored city park, "Pleasantville" is flat-out dazzling to 
behold.   </P>
<P>The cast is wonderful as well. Tobey Maguire anchors the film as a 
detached, ironic contemporary youth who initially tries to preserve the 
integrity of Pleasantville, only to learn that nostalgia is not all it's 
cracked up to be. Reese Witherspoon is strong as his sister, a young 
woman whose attempts to build a life out of fashion, sexual encounters 
and glib nihilism leave her yearning for self-esteem and genuine 
emotional contact. </P>
<P>Playing the citizens of Pleasantville, J.T. Walsh (in his final 
performance) and William H. Macy are strong as men traumatized by the 
changes to their well-ordered lives, and Jeff Daniels stands out as a 
gentle soul with the spirit of an artist buried beneath his passive 
demeanor. Out of all the actors, Joan Allen is perhaps the most memorable 
in a deliciously nuanced turn as the archetypal homemaker who blossoms 
into passionate individuality. </P>
<P>Beyond its stunning visuals and important messages, "Pleasantville" 
shines as a work of sheer joy, without a hint of the cynicism that 
plagues modern films and our world in general. Gary Ross clearly believes 
that humanity can grow past its fears to become a truly multi-colored 
society where diversity is embraced and individuality can flourish. As I 
watch the grim forces determined to impose their fascistic, black and 
white "family values" agenda onto our culture, I pray that he is right.</P>
