                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>** (out of 4 = fair)
1969, R, 113 minutes [1 hour, 53 minutes]
[drama]
starring: Jon Voight (Joe Buck), Dustin Hoffman (Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo),
produced by Jerome Hellman, written by Waldo Salt, directed by John
Schlesinger, based on the novel by James Leo Herlihy.</P>
<P>"Midnight Cowboy" is a story of a strange attempt at the American Dream gone
wrong, which is exactly how the film works. It could have been a great
character study, and/or a detailed depiction of  the cruelness of reality,
but it tells its story in such a bizarre manner it's difficult to follow,
much less be moved by.</P>
<P>The film starts off seemingly normal as we meet Joe Buck (Voight), a young,
handsome cowboy who is on his way to New York City to make it big. But Joe is
arrogant fellow, he fantasizes about women and convinces himself he's every
woman's dream. However, the fantasy sequences are inter-cut with strange
flashbacks, and they work well to portray the surrealism of the mind. These
scenes are scattered throughout the film, but eventually start to become
redundant and lose their impact.</P>
<P>Joe arrives in NYC and checks into a hotel and then hits the streets and
tries to pick up women. But he's a tall cowboy roaming the streets of New
York, and we get typical fish-out-of-water scenes that are supposed to show
how cruel people can be, but instead seem more like quick comic relief. When
Joe meets a woman and seduces her, we finally learn his reason for coming to
New York: to become a "hustler" to rich women. Unfortunately, he doesn't know
what he's doing and his plan seems to fail.</P>
<P>Right away, the film's biggest flaw is obvious - why would Joe leave home to
pursue such an unattainable goal? Also, how could he have seduced a woman so
fast? I found myself asking questions like these throughout the film, and
thus became distracted because they were never answered.</P>
<P>One day Joe meets Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo (Hoffman), a small time con man,
thief, and all around unsuccessful criminal. Ratso learns of Joe's plan and
tries to hook him up with a "pimp," but that plan falls through. Joe becomes
furious with Ratso, but when he bumps into him again he doesn't take revenge.
Instead, the two move in together in an abandoned building!</P>
<P>Although many events take place throughout the first half, virtually nothing
happens in terms of story and plot. Most of the second half is a series of
extremely strange events that are only mildly interesting and not nearly as
thematic as they intend to be. Up until the encounter with the strange old
pimp the film had been relatively normal. From that point on it becomes very
strange with scenes that make little or no sense and an overall feeling of
vertigo.</P>
<P>For example, Joe, who is the epitome of staunch heterosexuality, has a
homosexual encounter with a young man who does not pay him afterwards, yet he
hardly seems to mind. Why this happens is beyond me. Does he do it just for
the money, or is he possibly bi-sexual? Perhaps the flashbacks were subtle,
Freudian hints, but the story is told so choppy nothing makes sense.</P>
<P>The final act starts to become a modernized version of "Of Mice And Men" as
we learn the two plan to move to Florida to escape the New York winter
because Ratso is dying from it. But unlike Lenny and George, where one was
stupid and the other smart but both cared for each other, these men are both
stupid and neither seems to care for the other, and why would they? They have
nothing in common, Voight and Hoffman have no chemistry, and the atmosphere
is too gritty to be believed. The two are self-made victims - it's hard to
feel sorry for them.</P>
<P>There is a scene at a psychedelic party where the film itself becomes an
acid trip where reality is there, it's just not realistic. This is symbolic
of "Midnight Cowboy" - there is reality to it, but because it's bizarre it
cannot be taken seriously</P>
