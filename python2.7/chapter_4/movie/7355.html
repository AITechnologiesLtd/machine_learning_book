<P>        In short, Twister is a perfect summer flick.  It's acting is adequate,
it's character are 1/2 dimensional, it's sub-plots are silly, but boy,
oh boy is it FUN!!!!</P>
<P>        The Plot:  Tornado chasers Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton duel with mother
nature while trying to rekindle their marriage and fend off a rival
chaser(Cary Elwes).</P>
<P>         The film starts out with a truly chilling bang.  Beginning in 1969,
the film starts with a family of three(four, if you count a dog that,
probably not coincidentally, looks a lot like Toto, from Wizard of Oz)
running from their home to an underground shelter, after a surprise
storm hits the town.  The little child, having never seen a tornado
before, is amazed at its power and can hardly believe her eyes when it
blows the shelter door to pieces and takes her father with it.  
        This scene is frighteningly effective in the same way that the opening
scene of Cliffhanger was(and is probably the only reason, why you would
question taking a young child to this film).  It builds tension by
delaying the inevitable, because we know what will happen, but hope that
it doesn't.
        Of course, the special effects are truly eye-popping(I gave them top
billing; they are the REAL stars of this flick).  There tornadoes are
frighteningly convincing, and so is the damage that it does.  All
through the movie, we wonder: what will we see in midair next(my
personal favorite are the flying cows, which bellow out a frightened
"MOO" as they fly through the air).
         As said before, the film is fun.  Aside, from the scary opening scene,
the film's "scares" are more of the "ooh, Ahh, oh no" variety as opposed
to truly horrific scenes of destruction(it helps that the body count is
kept to a bare minimum).
        OK, I wasn't exactly expecting the level of quality that went into the
characters of Jaws(the movie to which all other revenge of
nature/science  movies will be measured against, and rightly so). 
Still, director Jan De Bont did get great performances out of Keanu
Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and(especially) Dennis Hopper in Speed.  Of
course, Hopper and Co. actually had distinct personalities to play off
of.  Hunt, Paxton, and Ewles are given very little.  Hunt plays the
tough chick, Paxton plays the ex-husband, and Elwes plays the other
tornado chaser.  
        I feel particularly bad for Ewles.  He is a great actor.  Yet, he can't
seem to get respect.  Let's see, in The Princess Bride, he was great,
but was overshadowed by Mandy Patankin.   In Glory(the greatest film
ever made about an American war), he was great, but was overshadowed by
Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington.  In Robin
Hood: Men in Tights, he was great but was overshadowed by the fact that
the movie sucked.  In Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, he was great
but was overshadowed by Jason Scott Lee, and all the lions and tigers
and bears(oh, my!).        
        Michael Crichton(who wrote the screenplay) is known for injecting much
scientific knowledge in his(great) books.  In Twister, we get many
scenes of people in "weather watch"-like stations, with lots of fancy
looking, computer animated programs for tracking the weather.  Yet, no
one bothers to explain what any of the screens mean, or explain the
scientific dialogue that goes along with it.  Gee, and we could have
learned something too...
        OK, now, that all is said and done. 
As said before, it's silly, occasionally stupid, and it's characters are
ill-defined.  But, it's a great time at the movies.  If you want
quality, wait till fall.  If you just want a good time, then summer is
the season.  Twister is a summer movie.                        "B+"</P>
