                     REVIEW: GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997)
                review by Chris Webb       copyright 1998
                   to appear in Amherst Student 2/4/98</PRE>
<P>CAST: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben Affleck, Minnie 
      Driver, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser  
      Directed by Gus Van Sant</P>
<P>        "Good Will Hunting" is one film that had caused me to reevaluate 
where my life is going and how I am doing it.  Perhaps because I have 
friends and conversations like these back home, and I have dealt with a 
similar struggle between picking my future and holding onto what is 
comfortable.  For whatever reason, I could relate to this film.  While 
many will sympathize with the characters and enjoy the story, young guys 
who have not had the world handed to them will benefit from seeing "Good 
Will Hunting."</P>
<P>        Twenty-year-old genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), lives in South 
Boston working construction and as a janitor at MIT.  He solves the 
problems left on a hallway chalkboard by professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan 
Skarsgaard), an internationally acclaimed mathematician.  Will does this 
anonymously, not wanting any part of the world of academia.  He would 
rather spend time with his friend, bar-hopping and driving aimlessly, 
running up an unbelievable rap sheet.  Lambeau takes time to seek Will 
out, only to discover him in jail for hitting a police officer.  Will can 
be free if he agrees to work with Lambeau in higher math and to undergo 
therapy.  The film hits full speed once Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) 
agrees to take on Will as a patient.</P>
<P>        Themes that run through "Good Will Hunting" are layered. The 
nature of genius, class conflict, and the complexities of love and trust 
are all explored, not focusing solely on Will.  Maguire and Lambeau old 
roommates took different paths after MIT.  Maguire will not attend 
reunions, looked on as a sellout for leaving the upper echelon of the 
academy to teach in a Boston community college, finding his true love in 
the process.  Lambeau, all awards and success, with little personal 
fulfillment, resents that Maguire was "smarter than me then, and smarter 
than me now."  They argue about whether Will should follow his heart or 
his brain, while Will himself becomes lost in their bickering.</P>
<P>        The screenplay was written by Damon and best friend Ben Affleck, 
who plays best friend Chuckie.  They have deservedly won a Golden Globe 
for best screenplay and have jumped to the A-list of actors, after seeing 
smaller roles in the past.  Affleck was found in this year's "Chasing 
Amy," for better or worse, and Damon has charged out with simultaneous 
roles in this and "The Rainmaker."  He opened eyes in 1996's "Courage 
Under Fire" as a Gulf War vet turned heroin addict.</P>
<P>        Robin Williams, gifted comedian, but better onscreen in dramas, 
has pulled himself out of purgatory after the disastrous "Fathers' Day" 
and "Flubber."  With a character most akin to his teacher in "Dead 
Poet's Society," he serves as the mentor for Will in a cynical world.   </P>
<P>        Skarsgaard, a Swede recently landing English-speaking roles with 
this and 1996's "Breaking the Waves" is excellent as the professor who 
all-too-keenly recognizes his limitations.  Minnie Driver performs well 
as a sheltered, wealthy college girl who turns into an emotional wreck as 
her relationship with Will becomes deeper.</P>
<P>        Before attending "Good Will Hunting" the first time (three times 
total), my father pointed out that this was the film that reduced most 
guys to tears.  A late scene between Damon and Williams will tug at you 
emotionally, and is reminiscent of an exchange between Judd Hirsch and 
Timothy Hutton in "Ordinary People."  Both received Oscar nominations, 
with hutton winning as a supporting actor.  "Good Will Hunting" is 
expected to garner its own slew of nominations, while the principals 
should get one.  This could be Williams' year, as this character is the 
deepest one he has portrayed to date.</P>
<P>        "Good Will Hunting" deeply affected me, for while I could not 
identify with all the struggles, I have had my share of run-ins with 
people.  Freshman year I was told by a student here to ignore my friends 
from home if I wanted to make it.  When Will is reminded by a 
pseudo-intellectual Harvard student that he will be serving his kids 
burgers, he responds, "That may be so, but at least I won't be 
unoriginal."  Neither is this movie.  It does not get caught up within 
itself the way most against-the-odds films do, and that is why this film 
will be one of the most fulfilling experiences you could have.</P>
