<PRE>Poop or Get Off the Pot
The Bachelor</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Wild Mustangs rage free across an open field providing visual symbolism of
the bachelor's yearning for independence and variety of grasslands upon
which to graze. Crude as it may be, the analogy charges on. By the end of
the film, the steeds become brides chasing down one lone bachelor as he
darts like a terrified doe from a pride of hungry lions.</P>
<P>The pictorially spectacular intro and conclusion form an elegantly
impressive ring box which unfortunately contains a less than precious
romantic comedy, that at times is not comedic and even less often romantic.</P>
<P>Chris O'Donnell is TV perfect, but big screen short. Renée Zellweger does a
better job of fitting the bill. While Brook Shields blows them both out of
the water with her short cameo.</P>
<P>A stampeding horse, the film leaps strongly from the gate, yet the downtimes
between the admittedly strong laughs steadily increase as the reels
progress. Two weak supporting actors also contribute to mid-movie drag. This
could have been due to talent direction as few potent acting moments make it
to the screen.</P>
<P>Cutting to the chase, long time bachelor (O'Donnell) falls in love with
equally independent Zellweger; however as the relationship nears "poop or
get off the pot," the bachelor just isn't ready to ... well ... poop. Still
funny at this point, O'Donnell's flawed proposals are truly humorous. Then a
flagrantly contrived 100 million dollar inheritance (which will be lost if
he doesn't marry in 27 hours) leads to a less than compelling series of
finance inspired proposals to his dwindling list of past lovers.</P>
<P>Ultimately light and cute, the middle had me checking my watch.</P>
