<P>YO BOB GOES TO THE MOVIES<HR>Blade: ** 1/2<HR></P>
<P>This week’s question: how is it possible for a film to be both
tongue-in-cheek _and_ completely devoid of irony?</P>
<P>I didn’t mean to see _Blade_.  I’d heard the basic
elements--Wesley Snipes, vampires--and wasn’t especially intrigued.
Snipes hasn’t been particularly watchable since _Jungle Fever_
(okay, it took chutzpah to do _To Wong Foo..._, but any connoisseur of
drag queen road movies will tell you what an inferior product that
was), and I doubted another superhero flick would reverse the downhill
trend.  Earlier that day I’d finally gotten around to watching
Robert Altman’s great film _Short Cuts_ on video, and when my
friends Josh and Paul suggested going to see _54_, it sounded like a
suitable follow-up.  At the theater, unfortunately, we discovered that
_54_ wasn’t starting until the next day.  Wesley won out over Drew
Barrymore and _Air Bud 2_.</P>
<P>_Blade_ is the polar opposite of _Short Cuts_.  The latter is an
intelligent, original film, hilarious and sad and subtle, one of
Altman’s clear triumphs.  It is also rife with irony.  _Blade_
shares none of these qualities, except perhaps hilarity.  I did laugh,
but I’m still not sure how much of that was intended by the
filmmakers.</P>
<P>Two of the two-and-a-half stars I give this movie belong to the first
five minutes of screentime, a knockout opening sequence that ranks
with the best filmed imagery of vampires I’ve ever seen.  Two of
the two-and-a-half stars I _didn’t_ give were out of pique at the
movie’s failure to live up to its promise.  It just isn’t fair
for a sequence that strong to give way to such an unrelenting
schlockfest.</P>
<P>It must be said that none of the principal actors are onscreen in the
first five minutes.  Night in the city: a girl leads a guy through a
meat locker into an underground techno club that turns out to be
chock-full of raving bloodsuckers.  They turn on him.  I was surprised
to feel real fear when it happened--surprised because, like most good
consumers of pop culture, I’ve been saturated with vampire
clichés courtesy of Brad Pitt, Gary Oldman (note: Coppola’s
_Dracula_ remains the worst of the genre) and Sarah Michelle Gellar.
It’s rare these days that a horror film possesses the ability,
nevermind the courage, to actually horrify.  But _Blade_ does, for a
few titillating moments.</P>
<P>And then, dammit, Wesley Snipes shows up lookin’ all chocolate
cheesecake, wearing complicated latex and wielding a sword that turns
vampires into sizzling yellow skeletons.  He’s Blade, he’s one
bad mother (shutcho mouth!) and no one understands him but Whistler, a
shaggy, squinty-eyed redneck played by Kris Kristofferson.  Together
they battle the undead establishment with garlic-filled silver bullets
and UV flashlights.  When an attractive doctor gets bitten, Blade
takes her to their bunker and injects her with liquid garlic to save
her, because, well, she’s an attractive doctor.  Not that he has
time for so much as a peck on the cheek between slaughtering his
mortal enemies.</P>
<P>In other words, _Blade_ becomes another superhero flick, a crashing,
blaring assault designed for maximum appeal to its target demographic.
No MTV-approved trend is left unfondled.  The music is cold
electronica, the violence is close-up gore, and every opportunity to
substitute cheesy computer graphics for live action is exploited.
While no one actually has sex, the movie’s approach to the concept
of evil is positively pornographic: that is to say, blunt, obvious,
manipulative and shallow.</P>
<P>So much about _Blade_ is ridiculously contrived that _The Shadow_
seems Altmanesque in comparison.  Why is the librarian vampire an
enormous, Hutt-like slug creature?  How does the attractive doctor
survive being tossed from one skyscraper to the roof of another,
several stories below, with nary a scratch?  Why does the serum...</P>
<P>Okay, nevermind.  It’s supposed to be over-the-top fun, not a
homework assignment.  And it doesn’t take extraordinary
intelligence to see that a lot of _Blade_ is played for laughs, not
chills.  But interspersed with moments of ghoulish humor (especially a
scene where the doctor is confronted by the shambling, rotting zombie
of her ex-boyfriend, who groans “Do you ever think about getting
back together?”) are scenes too gruesome to snicker at, too stupid
to take seriously.  I would have swallowed this nonsense as simple
lowbrow comedy if I hadn’t caught Snipes and Stephen Dorff (a fine
actor, here slumming as the arch-vamp) trying to squeeze actual
emotion from the rubber duckies of their roles.  This movie has no
clue where to go, and further insults us by spreading its legs for a
sequel.  If _Blade II_ ever sees production, pray for us all.</P>
<P>You want a good vampire movie?  See _Near Dark_ or _The Addiction_. </P>
<P>You want a supernatural comedy that works?  Watch _Ghostbusters_ or
_Army of Darkness_ again.</P>
<P>Just don’t subject yourself to this miserable exercise in hara-kiri.</P>
