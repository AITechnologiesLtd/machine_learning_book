Unbreakable
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Written and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan
Starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, and Spencer 
Treat Clark
Grade: C</PRE>
<P>Last year, writer/director Night Shyamalan rocketed from obscurity to the 
A-list with "The Sixth Sense," which won both critical and popular acclaim.  
This year, he hopes that lightning will strike twice by serving up another 
supernatural drama, "Unbreakable."  Bruce Willis is back, and there's a 
little boy and a twist ending, too.  However, the current pic just doesn't 
work.</P>
<P>You wouldn't know it from the trailers, but "Unbreakable" is a superhero 
movie.  It begins with a set of stats about comic-book collecting.  (It turns 
out that the average collector will devote an entire year of his life to 
reading comics; I wonder what he wasted the other sixty-nine years on.)  
Comics come up in the movie in the person of Elijah Price (Samuel L. 
Jackson), who suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease that causes him 
to have brittle bones.  Because he's spent most of his life recuperating from 
injuries, Elijah had a lot of time to read comics.  He owns an art gallery 
devoted to original art by comic-book artists and has an unusual theory:  
superheroes live and work among us.  Elijah figures that if he can have a 
disease that makes his body easily broken, then there must be others who are 
unbreakable.  </P>
<P>Security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is unbreakable.  At the beginning of 
the movie, David is the sole survivor of a terrible train wreck.  Over a 
hundred people are killed, but David walks away without a scratch.  Based on 
this, Elijah believes that David is the fulfillment of his theory.  David has 
problems of his own; he's breaking up with his wife Megan (Robin Wright Penn) 
and trying to maintain a relationship with his son Jeremy (Spencer Treat 
Clark).  So, David resists the idea that he's Superman, until he discovers 
unusual abilities he never knew he had.</P>
<P>Everyone tries very hard to make this movie fly.  Shyamalan pervades every 
scene with the same subtle creepiness that enriched "The Sixth Sense."  His 
direction shows the same meticulous attention to color, and his script endows 
the fragile premise with as much realism as he can muster.  Willis gives his 
best performance in awhile.  While I found him unconvincing as a shrink in 
"Sixth Sense," Willis shines as dull-witted characters who are out of their 
depth (as in "12 Monkeys" and "Pulp Fiction").  David is such a character.  
(When Elijah inquires if David has ever been sick, David has to ask his boss 
and his wife to find out that he hasn't.)   Jackson is slick and charismatic 
with an undercurrent of menace.  Penn is down-to-earth and genuine.  Clark is 
sweet and likeable.</P>
<P>However, despite the admirable efforts of the director and his cast, 
"Unbreakable" just can't make its plot work.  A major part of the problem is 
the somber attitude with which Shyamalan approaches his subject.  Superheroes 
can be a lot of fun, but a sober tone robs the concept of its joy and wonder. 
 The movie's website includes a lot of information on real-life unbreakable 
people, so I assume that Shyamalan shares the theory he puts in Elijah's 
mouth.  Willis recently said that "Unbreakable" was the first chapter in a 
trilogy.  Hope the next two have a sense of humor.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  Unbreakable performances, brittle premise.</P>
