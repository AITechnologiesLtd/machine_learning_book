<PRE>                           SPACE COWBOYS
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In a something-for-everyone
          adventure-comedy, four Air Force pilots, would-
          be astronauts from the Sixties, now in their
          seventies, get a chance to fly in space on what
          turns out to be an important space mission.
          This is a warm family comedy with more emphasis
          on characters' personalities than on special
          effects that transcends its Over-the-Hill-Gang-
          in-Space high concept.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low
          +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     THE RIGHT STUFF told how U.S. Air Force test pilots who had the
so-called "right stuff" were nevertheless washed out of the space
program by the government bureaucracy.  That film was almost
certainly the inspiration for SPACE COWBOYS in which four of those
pilots, now in their seventies fly an important shuttle mission for
NASA.  The film opens with the four young test pilots, guys with the
smarts and the guts it takes to save themselves in an emergency,
being frustrated in their dreams to fly in space.  Locked out are
Frank Corvin, Tank Sullivan, Jerry O'Neil, and Hawk Hawkins, all
commanded by the marginally competent Bob Gerson.</P>
<P>     Flash forward to the present.  The Russian communications
satellite Ikon, dating back to the cold war era, is in a decaying
orbit.  For reasons not being clearly explained by anyone it is very
important that the satellite be placed back into a healthy orbit.
High people in both the American and Russian governments are anxious
that it not be allowed to simply re-enter the atmosphere as its
current course will take it.  A NASA mission is being headed by Sara
Holland (Marcia Gay Harden) under the management of program veteran
Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) to repair the guidance system and put
the satellite back in orbit.  Retired pilot Frank Corvin (Clint
Eastwood), previously washed out of the space program, designed a
guidance system in the Sixties and it is the one that was used
aboard the Ikon.  He is asked to come out of retirement and help
repair the Ikon's guidance system.  Frank asks the obvious question:
what is his guidance system doing aboard a Soviet satellite sent up
during the Cold War?  He does not get an answer.  Corvin's deal for
NASA: They can have his help only if his 1960s team of four pilots
get to fly the mission.  Gerson's response: they can go if they can
get through training.</P>
<P>     Corvin collects the other three members.  There is Tank
Sullivan (James Garner), now a Baptist minister.  Jerry O'Neil
(Donald Sutherland) now engineers roller-coasters, and Hawk Hawkins
(Tommy Lee Jones) flies biplanes.  Corvin reassembles the somewhat
startled and bemused team and they begin their training.  When it is
clear that they cannot possibly get through the training through
fair means, they resort to foul.  Somewhat irksome is the unlikely
device that the nearly blind Jerry O'Neil is able to bluff his way
so that nobody suspects.  The training is a major part of the movie.
The actual mission does not begin until about ninety minutes into
the film.  All the while the mystery of this enigmatic Soviet
satellite deepens as the questions begin to pile up.</P>
<P>     At the center of the story is Eastwood, not the world's most
emotive actor, and Tommy Lee Jones.  Donald Sutherland as an aging
Lothario who bluffs his way around his near-blindness.  Garner's
trademark is his low-key quietly amused performances.  Here he it
works against him as he frequently melts into the scenery in the
presence of the other major actors.  Marsha Gay Harden is a good
choice for the mission planner.  Many actresses would look a little
too glamorous in the role and she gives the impression of being more
an intelligent, no-nonsense sort of person.  William Devane, who in
other films frequently shows little more characterization than a
funny way of talking, for once has a role that he can sink his teeth
into as the gum-chewing Mission Control.</P>
<P>     Nicely handled is the prologue set in the 1960s.  It would be
impossible to make the cast look so many decades younger.  The
characters are played by look-alike actors with the real actors
voices processed to sound younger.  The sequence does not entirely
work to convince the audience these are the same people, but it is
close enough for the viewer to go with it.  The younger version of
Eastwood (Toby Stephens) looks close enough to Eastwood that there
may have been some digital processing going on.  In general the
space special effects are kept conservative and inexpensive.  Stock
footage seems to be used where possible.  But this film is not an
effects extravaganza.  You probably do not go to a film like this
dazzling effect, for excitement, or even believability in the
adventure.  You want to see the interplay of four elder stars, each
with proven comic flair from earlier films.  As expected they
deliver.</P>
<P>     SPACE COWBOYS will probably be classified by most people as a
science fiction film, though there is not much in it to make it
science fiction any more.  But it is a well-crafted film with an
accent on characters.  I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
