<PRE>THE X-FILES
(20TH CENTURY FOX)</PRE>
<P>RUNNING TIME: 2 HOURS 1 MINUTE
STARRING DAVID DUCHOVNY AND GILLIAN ANDERSON
DIRECTED BY ROB BOWMAN
(Nearly) everyone's favourite Sci-fi program make's it big screen debut.
Surprisingly, the movie is quite good, and can hold itself onscreen. Agents
Mulder and Scully (Duchovny and Anderson) are back in another case of
strange going on's. This time, it's about a strange black liquid that the
government want to use as a biological weapon. And, they find out about a
sinister alien plot involving aliens who want to take over the earth. Can
they stop both these things? The truth is in the movie...
The X-Files is enjoyable sci-fi hokum, with excellent special effects, good
performances and an intriguing plot. Duchovny and Anderson are fine
on-screen, although they don't attempt to do anything different from what
they're doing on television. The same goes for the whole cast, and the
writing, and the directing. In fact, the entire movie is like watching an
didn't need to be made. It could of easily had been a 45 minute or feature
length episode on television. However, what is done is done is the usual
over-indulgent (the movie starts in 35,000 B.C!) the plot is good. Although
there are a few stupid bits, it's generally O.K, and at least makes sense to
people who don't watch t.v show. (I stopped watching about 2 years ago.)
However, it does help if you have some background knowledge of the
characters, because although Mulder and Scully give background of
themselves, the rest of the characters are a bit faceless (and some are
nameless, such as "Cigarette Smoking Man.")</P>
<P>The direction is actually quite good, and the set-pieces are done stylishly,
and some parts are even quite scary, and heavy in tension. The 'look' of the
film is good aswell, and the music (by Mark Snow, who composes for the T.V
series) helps convey the atmosphere. Also, the special effects are
excellent, even with the movie's relatively low budget.</P>
<P>Overall, The X-Files is both entertaining for X-Files fans and novices.
There's enough references to the show to keep buffs happy, while nothing
closely related to the T.V show happens in the movie that would alienate
and it never really ties up all it's lose ends, and it is overlong, and the
ending is too ambiguous (that's all the gripes!) it is fun. The best summer
movie so far.</P>
<PRE>OVERALL RATING=***1/2 OUT OF *****</PRE>
