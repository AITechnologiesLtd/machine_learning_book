<PRE>Naked Lunch (1991)
A film review by Liz Rizzo
Copyright 1999 by Liz Rizzo</PRE>
<P>Starring Peter Weller, Judy Davis, Julian Sands and Roy Scheider.
Written by William S. Burroughs (novel) and David Cronenberg.  Directed
by David Cronenberg.</P>
<P>There are some films that do more than tell us a story.  They create a
world so vivid, so lovingly created, that we feel transported.  We feel
that we have entered an incredible moving painting: a true motion
picture.  Two films that come to mind:  The Fifth Element and Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil.  In each of these very different films,
including Naked Lunch, there is a story.  But it is secondary to the
visual world created and the experience of being in it.</P>
<P>Naked Lunch is loosely the tale of William Lee, or should we say author
William S. Burroughs, and is loosely based on his novel of the same
name.  Our ill-fated protagonist is played to dry perfection by Peter
Weller and is joined by a superior cast of drug addicts, writers,
mysterious strangers and bugs.  Yes, homoerotic bugs play a large part
in this film, and if you can't handle it, you'd better get out now while
you can.</P>
<P>As I watched this film, I couldn't help but think about `normal' authors
- those who have loving families and regular writing schedules.  Those
for whom writing is a joy, to whatever extent that is possible.  But
then, who wants to watch a film about them when tormented, drugged-up,
hallucinating writers give invitations like this?  For as William Lee
falls deeper into his bug powder drug habit, he enters a dark world
called Interzone, and the trippy fun really begins.</P>
<P>This is not a film for everyone.  Much more palatable fare has been
rejected by the average audience for whom watching this film would
probably qualify as cruel and unusual punishment.  But surely every
writer can find a little corner in Interzone, a land where typewriters
become large, roach-like bugs that literally talk out of their ass and
`reports' are always due.  Surely every filmmaker can find something to
admire in this visual triumph.  And if erotic symbolism is your thing,
consider this your trick-or-treat bag after a long night of knocking on
doors.</P>
<P>An invitation to Interzone is an invitation to one author's private hell
and haven.  It is a strange and often uncomfortable place that draws you
in even as it repels you.  For as William Lee tells us, `the Zone takes
care of it's own.'   Care to visit?</P>
