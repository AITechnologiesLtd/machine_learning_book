Nelson, Phil Knight</PRE>
<P>   What would Michael Moore say about the New York Times
article of 2/10/98, which questions the usual
(liberal) view of downsizing?  Says America's most prestigious
daily newspaper, "Month after month the Labor Department
reports the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 
358,000 were added in January....well-paid middle
managers and other upper-level office workers are being
hired in big numbers....The study challenges views about the
work force.  One is that corporate downsizing has decimated
middle-level management...but hiring has outpaced the
layoffs...Corporate America is starved for people highly skilled
in technology."</P>
<P>   No problem for Moore.  The workers with whom he
sympathizes and emphathizes do not have the options of the
mroe mobile and educated unemployed.  One of the few
filmmakers who can make a hilarious documentary about a
serious subject, Moore is firmly on the side of Middle
Americans who have lived all their lives in their towns, areas
like Flint, Cincinnati, and Centralia.  They take pride in their
generally routine jobs, and have been despondent since
receiving pink slips through no fault of their own.  These are
the real Americans, those with firm roots in their abodes, who
are not the sorts who can simply pick up and travel halfway
around the country to where the jobs are.  Why have they
been fired or, as the current expression would have it,
downsized?  Simply because their companies wanted to make
more profit by locating their plants in underdeveloped
countries like Mexico and Indonesia.  What's wrong with trying
to maximize profit in this way?  Nothing, if you're a high
corporate executive who believes that this is your sole
purpose.  Plenty if you're Michael Moore, who believes that if
a company is MAKING HUGE PROFITS, it has a
RESPONSIBILITY to share some of this wealth with its
American employees.</P>
<P>   Michael Moore is well known among movie buffs as the
writer-director of one of the most celebrated documentaries,
"Roger and Me," a droll tale of his crusade to meet with
Roger Smith, Chairman of General Motors, to discuss with
him the decision to close the GM factories in Moore's home
town of Flint, Michigan.  As shown by that film and his current
one, Moore's talent extends beyond his ability to write a
whimsical script and even his talent at the helm of his films. 
Most important he is a stand-up comic of the first order, one
who wears his heart on his sleeve and whose sincerity is
obvious to any sensitive person watching him at work in his
favorite role of gadfly to the Establishment.  </P>
<P>   The title of his current movie, "The Big One" refers not to
President Clinton (or any aspect of the chief executive) but to
the country as a whole.  Among his many opinions is that the
name "The United States of America" is a dull one, certainly
when compared to, say, "The United Kingdom" or "Great
Britain," and that our nation should more accurately be called
"The Big One."  His focus is the downsizing trend which has
become stylish in corporate America, and, in fact he even
wrote the number one best-seller "Downsize This!"  He puts
across his views in the most entertaining way imaginable,
traveling about the mid-west interviewing workers and
executive alike, performing stand-up comedy to appreciative
crowds everywhere, and throwing in asides when the mood
strikes. The result is a kaleidoscopic look at a national
affliction: the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of loyal
employees simply because the big bosses can get the jobs
done outside the country at one-tenth the labor costs.</P>
<P>   Among the asides which can disarm even the grouchiest of
audiences, he describes to an appreciative crowd of college
youngsters that during the presidential campaign of '96 he
conducted an experiment to test the greed of the candidates. 
He set up some dummy corporations which issued small
checks to the aspirants, in one case mailing $100 to Pat
Buchanan's campaign from "Abortionists for Buchanan."  The
right-wing journalist cashed the check.  When Moore's book
"Downsize This!" came out, Random House, his publisher,
sent him on a marketing tour which the documentary
filmmaker turned into this splendid, heartfelt and very funny
documentary about the effects of the policy of downsizing.</P>
<P>   Thrown out by security guards and publicists for some
major corporations for entering their buildings with his small
army of camera people, he is enthusiastically received by
downsized workers everywhere.  At a Payday factory in
Centralia Illinois, he commiserates with packers who have
spent five, ten, twenty years with the company and are now
tossed out because they were too productive!  The plants
relocated to Mexico. Once, whenever a company
spokesperson cited for the umpteenth time the need to
maximize profits, Moore retorts, "Then why doesn't General
Motors sell crack?"  Moore explores one situation in which
prison labor is used by TWA to book reservations, because
the incarcerated could be paid just two dollars an hour.  His
most intriguing interview is with Phil Knight, the hip-looking
CEO of Nike corporation, which makes America's most
popular and profited athletic shoes.  The trouble is that none
of these shoes (save one) are made in the U.S.  The
assemblers are workers as young as fourteen in Indonesia,
whose laborers cannot even afford shoes for themselves and
where they are paid twenty cents an hour.  (Michael Jordan
receives $20 million annually from the corporation, more than
the entire 30,000 strong labor force in Indonesia.) 
Remarkably, Knight wants Moore to believe that "Americans
do not want to make shoes."  When Moore proves the chief
executive wrong by showing him documentary footage, the
latter retorts that the unemployed are desperate and will say
anything--but cannot be trusted to stick to the job for long.</P>
<P>   Technically, the movie is messy, which is understandable
given the need to transport cameras to various locations in a
flash and, in some cases to hide them from the people being
filmed.  It's difficult to leave this work without feeling a strong
support for unions, for labor in general.  Moore certainly
realizes that to put across points most efficiently, you've got to
keep the audience laughing.  "The Big One" should be
required viewing for members of the working class who
blithely cross picket lines, lines of people who, like them, are
struggling on $5, $6 or $8 an hour.  The movie is an
education in class-consciousness which can be enjoyed even
by those without a political thought in their heads. Not rated. 
Running time: 96 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten 1998</P>
