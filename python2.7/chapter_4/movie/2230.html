<PRE>                                CARLITO'S WAY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller.
Screenplay:  David Koepp.
Director:  Brian DePalma.</PRE>
<P>     Brian DePalma needs a hit *really* badly.  Since scoring big with
THE UNTOUCHABLES in 1987, DePalma has seen CASUALTIES OF WAR, RAISING
CAIN and particularly the disastrous BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES go down in
flames.  Consequently, it would be easy enough to consider CARLITO'S
WAY a shrewd commercial choice for DePalma, reteaming with Al Pacino
(SCARFACE) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his
two greatest box office successes.  It doesn't hurt any that he has
latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from
Pacino and Sean Penn.  CARLITO'S WAY, while hampered by DePalma's
characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism, is a truly tense and
engrossing drama.</P>
<P>     Carlito Brigante (Pacino) is a life-long criminal who finds
himself unexpectedly given a second chance.  In 1975, Carlito is
released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year
sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality.  He
declares himself reformed, tired of life on the streets and determined
to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the
Bahamas.  Among those who find this conversion hard to believe are
David Kleinfeld (Penn), Carlito's crooked attorney and childhood
friend, and bodyguard Pachanga (Luis Guzman).  Carlito rediscovers old
flame Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), and seems ready to retire in peace.
Old ways die hard, though, and old associates pull Carlito step by step
back into a life he can't seem to shake.</P>
<P>     CARLITO'S WAY will probably make the strongest impression with the
two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film.  In the first,
Carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have
anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat; the film closes with an
equally thrilling chase through the New York subway and Grand Central
Station.  Both highlight DePalma's gift for choreographed mayhem, and
these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely.
Yet for all the viscera, I found the character study even more
compelling.  Carlito Brigante has a lot of Michael Corleone in him, an
aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit.  But where the
culmination of the GODFATHER saga played like opera, there's more of an
immediacy to CARLITO'S WAY, an ever-present sense of doom launched by
the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion.  You sense
that there's no way, after so many years, that Carlito can stay out of
trouble.  Indeed, he observes that his attempt at the straight life is
more a function of time than a change of heart:  "You don't get
reformed; you just run out of wind."  Pacino captures Carlito's dilemma
with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of
experience watching every corner for an enemy.  Sean Penn is even
better, turning in his best performance to date as Kleinfeld.  A Jew in
the world of Puerto Rican and Italian wiseguys, Kleinfeld is an
outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder.  He could have been simply
pathetic, a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys
way out of his league, but Penn invests Kleinfeld with tremendous
nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct.  He shows a man
moving steadily towards the brink, making the moment he goes over quite
jolting.</P>
<P>     As compelling as the narrative is, viewers may experience a
profound sense of deja vu.  DePalma continues to steal shamelessly from
other directors, this time adding Scorsese to his repertoire with a
point of view tracking shot and a Copacabana scene with more than
passing resemblances to GOODFELLAS.  He even recycles some of his own
previous plagiarisms, like a 360 degree swing around a kiss (VERTIGO
via BODY DOUBLE) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as
far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from THE
UNTOUCHABLES.  From a story standpoint, there's an obligatory love
story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character.  Penelope
Ann Miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with
the role, and eventually she becomes just a distraction, never
integrated fully enough into the story.</P>
<P>     Still, it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the
backbone is so solid.  The two principle characters held an iron grip
on my attention, one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't
break.  CARLITO'S WAY plays like a tragic novel:  deliberate, confident
and powerful.  Those willing to grant DePalma his tendencies towards
the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 wiseguys:  7.</PRE>
