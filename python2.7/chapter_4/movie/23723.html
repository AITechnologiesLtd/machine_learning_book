<PRE>BOYS DON'T CRY (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: B+</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Kimberly Pierce</PRE>
<P>Screenplay: Kimberly Pierce, Andy Bienen</P>
<P>Starring: Hilary Swank, Chloe Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton III,
Allison Folland, Alicia Goranson</P>
<P>The story of Teena Brandon is more than just that, it's the story of Mathew
Shepard, possibly even the story of Howard Beach. Shepard was killed for being
gay and Beach was killed for being black. Both were killed out of intolerance,
possibly fear as well. Teena was killed for being a girl who wanted to be a
boy. She changed her appearance (taped her breasts, cut her hair, developed a
swagger), and her name (took the Brandon and put it before the Teena) all to
become male. Shocking? Not really. When you strip away all the religious
propaganda and idiotic moralizing we've had stuffed down our throats since
tots, you'll find that this story is really a modernist fairly tale, like the
pauper who wanted to be a prince, it is the girl who wanted to be a boy. Though
unlike the homogenized fairy tales we're force fed as kids, this one doesn't
end happily.</P>
<P>I recall the first time I became aware of Brandon's story. It 'twas the night
before finals, a night filled with the worst kind of pre-performance anxiety
(well, maybe the second worse kind), but I was covered; I had studied with such
abandon (into the wee hours of morning) that my head was overflowing with
useless crap I would surely forget by the next week. Before heading to bed I
switched on Cinemax hoping for some soft-core porn, as is the usual programming
at 2:00 a.m. Instead I found THE BRANDON TEENA STORY, a horribly made, but
nonetheless gripping documentary about the brief life and sudden death of Teena
Brandon. It was a maddening story, viewing it was tantaumont to being privy to
an injustice that could have easily been countered. Maddening because of the
stupidity and ignorance of nearly everyone involved. And maddening because of
how this innocent was savagely beaten, raped and killed all for her desire to
be something she wasn't. And who among us doesn't at least fleetingly have that
desire? Is her wish to be a man all that hard to take in these supposedly
enlightened times? ("Enlightened" today means we all carry around the same old
prejudices, only now they're kept tightly underwraps only to surface in the
heat of the moment as DO THE RIGHT THING, Spike Lee's audacious film about
intolerance, showed us). After all, we don't think harshly of those who get
nose jobs, liposuction, breast implants, all the surgeries designed to make you
someone else; the person you want to be.
When Brandon is confronted about her switch (during a rape query no less) she's
practically forced into saying "I have a sexual identity crisis" when she
really doesn't, she's simply more comfortable as a man.</P>
<P>That damn documentary kept me up till 4:00 am, but it was well worth it. Teena
Brandon's story is more insightful than anything I picked up in the gargantuan
Psychology textbook I had been slogging through the very same night.</P>
<P>In BOYS DON'T CRY, Brandon is played by Hilary Swank in a performance that goes
well beyond simple macho posturing. With her close-cropped hair, thin frame,
and wide grin, Swank has the appearance of an extremely gawky Matt Damon. But
look closer at that smile, the earnestness in her demeanor, the good-natured
chivalrousness and she becomes loveable as a man. It's easy to see why a bitter
southern townie would fall for her. She has something the other males lack; an
aw shucks kindness. She comes with flowers while the others come with beer and
condoms.</P>
<P>As the film opens Teena leaves her hometown of Lincoln for Falls City, a
trailer park haven. Through a bar fight she becomes acquainted with two loutish
rednecks (both extremely well played by Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton
III), and their "girls". One of whom catches Teena's eye. She is Lana (well
played by Chloe Sevigny) a bitter townie, who like all bitter townies dreams of
escaping the confines of her town. Brandon is in a similar situation; she
dreams of escaping the confines of femininity. Teena woos her with sweetness,
something the men of this particular town seem to know nothing about (yes a
generalization, but a surprisingly appropriate one judging from the
documentary). Their relationship is the heart of the film, and it certainly
works to counter the almost clinical manner of its brutal, unflinching
conclusion. That heart makes the violence much harder to take; we've grown to
care about this character and the unrelenting cruelty towards her hurts, as it
should.</P>
<P>Kimberly Pierce (the co-writer\director, and certainly a talent to watch) ups
the lyrical undertones with in-between-scene segues filmed as heady rushes of
prairie life speeded up to the point where all we see are rapid lights blinking
with urgency. The film itself gradually becomes more urgent, and a bit more
difficult to watch. Pierce doesn't hide much from us. We see the murders, the
beatings, and the rape, but here it serves a purpose whereas in a major
Hollywood production like THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER it did not. In that movie the
rape was filmed by commercial director Simon West as a masochistic gang bang
fantasy. West used flashy camera moves and stylishly dank cinematography to
make, what looked like, a slick commercial for rape. Pierce hardly moves her
camera; she simply presents us with the facts. BOY'S DON'T CRY doesn't preach,
or moralize its characters, it chronicles events that did occur. And it gives
them life and meaning by taking us into a strangely touching romance that looks
to be so simple on the surface. It is simple in all its ROMEO AND JULIET tragic
romanticism, but complex because of the one major addition.</P>
<P>Pierce's film is uncompromising in its content. I can just imagine if it had
been made as a mainstream film (as was proposed). The movie features the kind
of raw intensity, taboo exploration, and emotional truths that used to be
(pre-Tarantino) the hallmark of independent film. Now amidst the rotting
corpses of irony laden "hipster" indies, BOYS DON'T CRY stands out as a
sobering experience.</P>
