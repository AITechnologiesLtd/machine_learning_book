<PRE>                     MIGHTY PEKING MAN (Hong Kong)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: A wild jungle woman and an 11-story gorilla are
discovered in Tibet and taken to Hong Kong where the gorilla escapes
and causes havoc.  This is a laughable 1977 rip off of KING KONG
(1976), itself a rip-off.  Production values are low and audiences seem
to like the film mostly for derisive laughter.  Rating: 2 (0 to 10),
high -2 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Ho Meng-Hua.
   - This film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the
     festival.
   - An earthquake uncovers an 11-story tall gorilla in the Himalayas.
     A hunter, chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at
     loose ends, gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female
     Tarzan who controls the ape.
   - Evelyne Kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is
     pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of.
   - Gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible.
     Nice miniature effects, however.
   - Has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with
     animals like Chi-chi the leopard.
   - Several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if
     there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened
     in the interim.
   - Actual location shooting in Mysore.  Ape shown badly matted behind
     temple.
   - Combining of images usually pretty bad.  Incompetent matching of
     film stocks.
   - Stock footage frequently used.
   - Gorilla brought to Hong Kong by greedy entrepreneur who really
     abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good.</P>
