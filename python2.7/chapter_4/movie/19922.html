A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Brad Bird</PRE>
<P>Written by Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies, based on a Ted Hughes book</P>
<P>Starring: The voices of Eli Marienthal, Jennifer Aniston, Vin Diesel, Harry
Connick, Jr., and Christopher McDonald</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this animated feature a giant, destructive alien robot (voice of Vin
Diesel) lands on Earth and suffers amnesia. The killing machine is
befriended by a young boy named Hogarth (Eli Marienthal) who along with his
beatnik acquaintance Dean (Harry Connick, Jr.) teaches the iron behemoth
about friendship and human free will. Unfortunately for Hogarth and his new
metal friend it is the height of the Cold War period in US history, so the
US Army and a gung ho government agent are bent on tracking down and
destroying the giant.</P>
<P>Opinion:
Great casting. FRIENDS waitress Jennifer Aniston is back in the familiar
costume, only this time she's a waitress who's also a 1950s single mother.
Crooner Harry Connick, Jr. is digging the beat again, but not as a
musician. In THE IRON GIANT Connick, Jr. plays a Beat generation artist.
Both Aniston and Connick slide into their roles and improvise effortlessly.
The artwork's pretty interesting, too. It's late 50s style, and if you went
back in time and showed the cartoon at a 1960s elementary school assembly
it wouldn't look a bit out of place.  </P>
<P>THE IRON GIANT plays low key on the emotions, yet it's a solid story
because of timeless ingredients that anyone can appreciate: friendship,
moral choices, action and the big showdown. Bring the family. </P>
