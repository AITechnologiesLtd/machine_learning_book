<P>In 1998, the police buddy-movie "Rush Hour" clicked with audiences due
to the inspired pairing of lovable action star Jackie Chan and
motormouth comic Chris Tucker. My review of the original stated "Tucker
slightly tones down his hyperactive, helium-voiced, in-your-face
chatter, making his character humorously abrasive rather than
insufferable. He's actually quite fun to watch as he talks his way in
and out of trouble, periodically breaking into a bizarre urban-Egyptian
form of dance and using leering effeminate movements to challenge other
males. I have no idea how Tucker developed his alien-on-amphetamines
shtick, but he's certainly one of a kind."</P>
<P>The bad news about "Rush Hour 2" is that Tucker doesn't tone down
anything this time around. The good news is that Jackie Chan's
performance is so strong that he makes up for the excesses of his
partner. To be fair, I should note that Tucker does have some effective
scenes. My favorite (SPOILER ALERT: The rest of this paragraph reveals
two jokes) takes place at a Las Vegas casino, where he attempts to draw
the attention of security by breaking into a strident rant accusing the
facility of racism. During his tirade, he announces that black people
have suffered the abuse of whites "for 362 years," which I believe marks
the first time anyone has ever pinned it down so precisely. Seconds
later, when a defensive white official denies that the casino is racist,
citing the fact that Lionel Richie is playing there, Tucker's character
shouts, "Lionel Richie? Lionel Richie hasn't been black since he left
the Commodores!"</P>
<P>If only the rest of his work was so consistently funny. There were times
when I wanted to climb into the screen, slap Tucker silly and force-feed
him Ritalin. Thank Goodness for the soothing presence of Jackie Chan,
who gets more charming with each passing year. His athletic abilities
are as strong as ever and his skill as an actor keeps improving, as does
his command of English.</P>
<P>The sequel opens in Hong Kong, where LAPD detective Carter (Tucker) is
vacationing with Chief Inspector Lee (Chan). Carter just wants to visit
with his friend and sample the exotic pleasures of the city, especially
the women. But the guys soon get caught up in a huge case. An explosion
at the American Embassy kills two U.S. Customs agents that had been
investigating smugglers trafficking in "superbills," extremely
high-grade counterfeit American $100 bills.</P>
<P>The main suspect in the bombing is Ricky Tan (John Lone), the suave
leader of the deadliest gang in China. Lee approaches the case with a
fervor, because Tan was once a Hong Kong police officer partnered with
Lee's father and was directly involved in his death. Lee and Carter's
pursuit of Tan leads them through a variety of colorful locations,
including a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a yacht party on the
waters of Victoria Harbor. The massage parlor visit, by the way,
features a beautifully choreographed fight scene that ends with the
lawmen unceremoniously thrown bare-assed onto a busy city street.</P>
<P>The duo also must deal with Tan's right hand woman, Hu Li (Zhang Ziyi
from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), mega-rich hotel and casino owner
Steven Reign (comedian Alan King) and Isabella Molina (Roselyn Sanchez),
who is either an undercover U.S. agent or a turncoat aligned with Tan.
The chase takes Lee and Carter back to Los Angeles briefly and then on
to Las Vegas for the climax of the film, set on the Strip at the opening
of the Red Dragon Hotel and Casino.</P>
<P>At one point in the proceedings, I jotted "too much plot" in my
notebook, but the rousing finale suitably deals with all the elements
and characters raised in the story. And while Jackie Chan tosses off
lots of one-liners, he plays Lee's relationship with the man that killed
his father completely serious, which makes the plot seem like more than
just an excuse for jokes and stunts.</P>
<P>As with the vast majority of sequels, "Rush Hour 2" isn't as good as the
original, but it offers more than enough entertainment to warrant your
time and money (the riotous outtakes that run over the closing credits
are funnier than most of the films passing as comedies this summer). If
the series continues, and it certainly appears on track to do so, I hope
future installments focus more on the camaraderie between the leads and
less on their bickering. There are plenty of bureaucrats and bad guys
ripe for them to belittle, let the boys play nice with each other. Other
suggestions: Write stories that get both Lee and Carter emotionally
involved in the case, keep the jokes and imaginative fight scenes coming
and, for Pete's Sake, tone down Chris Tucker. Jackie Chan has proven his
ability to be humorous and serious in the same film, give Tucker the
opportunity to do the same.</P>
