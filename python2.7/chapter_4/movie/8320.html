She's The One
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1996, R, 97 minutes [1 hour, 37 minutes]
[romantic comedy]
starring: Edward Burns (Mickey Fitzpatrick), Mike McGlone (Francis
Fitzpatrick), Maxine Bahns (Hope), John Mahoney (Mr. Fitzpatrick), produced
by Edward Burns, Ted Hope, James Schamus, written and directed by Edward
Burns.</P>
<P>        If I had known "She's The One" is about a love triangle between two brothers
and their [estranged] lovers I probably would have seen it as just another
soap opera disguised as a movie. But then again, that's probably why I found
the film to be enjoyable. It knows it's essentially a soap opera but because
it's told realistically with a fair amount of charm and humor it works.</P>
<P>        This is the second film by GenXer Edward Burns who also writes, produces,
and stars here the same as his first feature "The Brothers McMullen." In the
spirit of "Brothers," this film works in the same manner by starting out
simple but gradually becoming more complex by developing characters and
multiple, overlapping storylines which all make for interesting, offbeat
themes. </P>
<P>        First we meet the brothers (and father) Fitzpatrick. Mickey (Burns) is the
older brother who drives a cab for a living but doesn't care about his income
because he's happy. Francis (McGlone) is the younger brother who makes lots
of money but isn't exactly happy because he's cheating on his wife and
doesn't know what to do. Mr. Fitzpatrick (Mahoney) is the old Irish dad who
tells his sons to do whatever makes them happy but make sure they stay close
to the family. Basically, these guys make up a "close-knit" movie family. </P>
<P>        One day Mickey picks up a woman named Hope (Bahns) in his cab. She has to
take a plane from New York City to New Orleans but she's afraid of flying and
asks if Mickey would drive her instead. Now this is your generic Meet Cute
scene, but there isn't much chemistry between Burns and Bahns, which is
surprising since the two are a couple in reality. A few scenes later we find
they were married on the road (kind of a crash-course version of "Before
Sunrise" I guess).</P>
<P>        Meanwhile, we've gotten to know Francis who's a real Scrooge-like character.
He's having an affair with a sexy blonde named Heather (Cameron Diaz), who,
not coincidentally, used to be engaged to Mickey (and who is also fooling
around with others besides Francis and has a torrid past). Back home,
Francis's wife Carol (Jennifer Aniston) complains about their lack of a sex
life, and threatens to use alternative measures for pleasure (in one of the
funniest, wittiest discussions about masturbation I've ever seen).</P>
<P>        Most of the film is a rather complicated story of romance between all the
characters, both past and present. Certain things happened in the past that
eventually affect the continuing plot, and it's interesting to watch the
manner in which Burns is able to make everything stay in synch and seem so
breezy. We get subplots of secrets and lies of affairs and passion between
just a few characters, but you never doubt the plausibility of it all. </P>
<P>        Maybe the instant romance between Mickey and Hope was hard to swallow, but
at least we get some good scenes of interaction and believable dialogue which
in turn push the plot along. Unlike other independent filmmakers like Kevin
Smith and Richard Linklater, Burns is not a master of dialogue, but his
character never talk and act like movie characters. The film doesn't try to
become an overly dramatic love story either, it just puts very down-to-Earth
characters in situations you'd only see in the movies. Sometimes it seems
strange but that's pretty much the point.</P>
<P>        In retrospect, I realize "She's The One" doesn't have the charm of "The
Brothers McMullen," but it does deliver a good theme about how serious and
important modern relationships (especially marriage) really are. It works for
me because it manages to be at least entertaining despite all the things it
has going against it.</P>
