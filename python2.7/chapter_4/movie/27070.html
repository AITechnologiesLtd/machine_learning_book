QUILLS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"It's not even a proper novel," Father Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) 
complains to the Marquis de Sade (Geoffrey Rush) about his book, 
"Justine."  "It's an encyclopedia of perversion!"  The priest is the 
head of the mental institution in which the Marquis is incarcerated in a 
rather sumptuously furnished cell.  "Justine" was written and smuggled 
out against Father Coulmier's express orders.</P>
<P>In Philip Kaufman's QUILLS, which is fascinating and repelling at the 
same time, Kate Winslet plays Madeleine, the washer woman who smuggles 
out the Marquis's scandalous prose.  At the price of one kiss per page, 
she gets to read the words, which are so hot that they almost burn the 
page.  (Actually, yesterday's perversions are likely to seem silly, tame 
and obtuse today, as it relies on cute euphemisms like "Venus mound.")  
In the movie, people profess shock but read his works as fast as they 
can.  "That's terrible, too, too terrible," Madeleine's blind mother 
claims as she is read the bawdy text.  But when her daughter pauses, the 
mother exclaims, "Well, go on!"</P>
<P>The real sadist of the story isn't the infamous Marquis, but his new 
doctor, Royer-Collard (Michael Caine), whom the emperor sends to oversee 
Father Coulmier.  The doctor believes that it is possible to torture 
patients to sanity.  There is nothing like being strapped into a chair 
and held upside down under water to restore one's senses.  The good 
doctor has a new, young wife, Simone (Amelia Warner), whom he keeps 
caged like a bird.  With bars on her windows and locks on the outside of 
her bedroom door, she is kept ready to be ravished at will by her 
husband without any worry that she will escape.  Or at least that's the 
theory.</P>
<P>The subject of the story, which takes many unexpected approaches, is 
about obsessions.  The doctor's number one desire turns out to be 
control.  More surprising is that what truly turns on the Marquis isn't 
so much sex or violence, but the act of writing.  Of course, all he 
wants to write about is sex and violence.  In a telling scene after his 
writing quills and ink have been confiscated, he slices up his fingers 
and uses fingernails and blood as substitutes.  A man who knows no 
bounds, he turns to his own feces as an ink substitute when that's all 
he has left.</P>
<P>Father Coulmier, who tries to understand and help the seriously deranged 
but brilliant Marquis, argues with the doctor that the Marquis's 
writings are "a purgative for the toxins in his mind."  Needless to say, 
the doctor doesn't buy this theory, although he sees no problem in 
personally profiting from his prisoner's pen.</P>
<P>"How can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?" Madeleine asks 
Father Coulmier, who replies, "We can't."  QUILLS illustrates this 
vividly.  No matter how much the Marquis repulses us, we find ourselves 
drawn to him when those more wicked than he abuse him.  Rush makes him 
such an eminently likeable rogue that we can't help but find ourselves 
secretly rooting for him no matter how despicable he becomes.  QUILLS is 
a fascinating and sometimes bizarre motion picture.  Perhaps its biggest 
surprise, however, is how relatively tame it is.  Think of it as a 
ribald ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST with a script that it is 
correctly rated R and not NC-17. An intriguing movie, it leaves you with 
a lot to ponder.</P>
<P>QUILLS runs 2:03.  It is rated R for strong sexual content including 
dialogue, violence and language and would be acceptable for older 
teenagers.</P>
