<P>Coming-of-age stories are almost always about men and there's a good 
reason for that. Despite all the hype about how far men have evolved from 
the old days, the truth is that most of us haven't. We've read about how 
contemporary men express their emotions instead of bottling everything up,
 but we don't quite know how to do that. So we still try to be tough, yet 
accessible; stoic and cool. We strive to live up to some vague male ideal 
that probably never existed, and we feel like frauds. Coming-of-age films 
are invaluable because they give us a chance to vicariously grow up all 
over again. </P>
<P>Which brings us to "Good Will Hunting," a rich, rewarding coming-of-age 
tale starring Will Damon and Robin Williams. The screenplay, written by 
Damon and his co-star and boyhood friend Ben Affleck ("Chasing Amy," 
"Going All The Way",) is reminiscent of other male-bonding films, notably 
"Ordinary People" and "Dead Poets Society," but quite emotionally 
satisfying in its own right. Their portrait of a lost young man whose 
unresolved pain triggers explosive outbursts, and the two father figures 
who battle over his soul, hits all the right notes. Under the assured 
hand of director Gus Van Sant ("My Own Private Idaho," "Drugstore 
Cowboys") even the maudlin parts of the story retain an emotional clarity.
 Like "Hoosiers," "Good Will Hunting" takes a well-worn theme and makes 
it seem fresh, thanks to exceptional acting and solid, three-dimensional 
storytelling.  </P>
<P>Will Hunting (Damon) is a scrappy young tough from South Boston's Irish 
ghetto who works as a janitor at a prestigious university. A mathematical 
genius with a photographic memory, Hunting has no direction, spending his 
time pounding beer and exchanging mock insults with his buddies, 
particularly his best friend Chuckie (Affleck.) When MIT Professor 
Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard from "Breaking The Waves") spots the boy 
casually solving an advanced math problem, he pursues Hunting, only to 
find him jailed for assaulting a police officer. Lambeau arranges to take 
the troubled kid under his wing, with two conditions. Hunting must do 
math work with the professor and agree to participate in therapy for his 
antisocial behaviors. Following several disastrous attempts to match the 
boy with a therapist, Lambeau finally turns to Sean McGuire (Williams,) a 
psychology professor at a small community college. McGuire, who grew up 
in the same neighborhood as Hunting, tries to help the boy confront his 
inner demons, only to find his own painful memories stirred up as well. 
Further complicating matters is Hunting's awkward courtship of Skylar 
(Minnie Driver,) a wealthy Harvard senior preparing for medical school.</P>
<P>For men seeking to vicariously relive their adolescence, Will Hunting is 
the perfect flawed hero. Rakishly handsome and as fast with his tongue as 
he is with his fists, Hunting has limitless potential, if he can only 
break through his own emotional barriers. To make the wish-fulfillment 
scenario complete, he is surrounded by a support system most people only 
dream of; a group of loving, encouraging pals, a smart, charming 
girlfriend, and two, count 'em, two father figures trying to help the kid 
better himself. In lesser hands, this material could have been unbearably 
mawkish, but thankfully, Damon and Affleck's script balances the angst 
with loads of earthy humor to keep the proceedings grounded. That, 
coupled with Van Sant's confident direction and some powerhouse acting, 
helps "Good Will Hunting" to pay off in grand fashion. </P>
<P>Matt Damon, who made quite an impression in "The Rainmaker," gives a 
breakthrough performance here. Possessed with tousled good looks and a 
killer smile, the charismatic actor is utterly convincing as a super-
intellect, while maintaining the character's working-class sensibilities. 
He's really quite remarkable here. Robin Williams does admirable work as 
well, showing what a fine actor he can be when he restrains himself. As 
the wounded professor, Williams projects great strength and defiance, 
tempered by a gentle, caring nature. The chemistry that slowly builds 
between him and Damon is electrifying.</P>
<P>As Skylar, Minnie Driver has an earthy charm that comes from her 
willingness to completely let down her guard. Whether telling a dirty 
joke to the guys at a bar, or breaking into tears in the darkness, she 
possesses a bracing sense of honesty. It's easy to understand why Hunting 
is drawn to her.</P>
<P>Also good are Skarsgard as the driven math professor and Affleck as 
Hunting's closest friend. In fact, there isn't a bad performance to be 
found in the film. The strong acting, along with Van Sant's ability to 
make the South Boston setting feel authentic, allows "Good Will Hunting" 
to triumph over its occasional moments of excess sentimentality. Cynics 
may dismiss the film as an overly effusive festival of male-bonding, but 
for the rest of us, this is just the catharsis we need.</P>
