<P>     One of the great things about movies is the depth of emotion they 
are capable of conveying.  In THE SWEET HEREAFTER, we feel the wrenching 
loss of a town stripped of its children.  In BLUE, we suffer alongside a 
woman on a quest to assuage her grief.  In UN COEUR EN HIVER and THE 
REMAINS OF THE DAY, we are suffused by the frustration that comes from 
emotional paralysis.  As unforgettable as these and countless other 
films are, there's a flip-side to this kind of power, and it's most 
evident when a picture tries unsuccessfully to tap into our emotions.  
POST COITUM (the full title, truncated for American release, is POST 
COITUM, ANIMAL TRISTE, or, literally translated, AFTER SEX, ANIMAL 
SADNESS) is such a movie -- weak, superficial, and unconvincing, it 
turns what could have been a searing experience into a trite, 
overwrought melodrama.</P>
<P>     The problems begin at the outset, with a quartet of scenes 
seemingly designed to baffle even the most astute viewer.  The first is 
of a cat meowing and sensuously stretching as it rolls across a floor.  
Then we see a half-naked woman, who turns out to be protagonist Diane 
Clovier (Brigitte Rouan), writhing in agony on her bed.  Cut to an 
elderly couple preparing to eat dinner -- suddenly, the woman, Madame 
Lepluche (Francoise Arnoul), stabs her husband in the throat with a 
fork, killing him.  Next, Diane, no longer in the throes of emotional 
turmoil, but in complete possession of herself and dressed smartly, 
enters a darkened apartment and proceeds to wake up a man named Francois 
(Nils Tavernier), his girlfriend, and his room mate, Emilio (Boris 
Terral).</P>
<P>     Eventually, it becomes clear what's going on.  The bulk of the 
movie, which centers on the May-December affair between the young, 
virile Emilio (a twenty-something hydraulic engineer), and the mature, 
married Diane (a forty-something book publisher), is presented in 
flashback from the perspective of the woman, who is unable to cope with 
the end of this relationship.  At the same time, we are told the story 
of Madame Lepluche, a client of Diane's lawyer husband, Philippe 
(Patrick Chesnais), who, after 43 years of marriage, killed her spouse 
rather than letting him divorce her.  These disparate plot elements, 
which begin widely-separated in time, tone, and intent, eventually 
converge as the film moves through a sometimes-tedious final half-hour 
towards an awkward conclusion.  </P>
<P>     Director Brigitte Rouan, who also plays the lead role, fails in two 
key areas:  she never creates believable, three-dimensional characters 
and she doesn't delve sufficiently deeply beneath the surface of a 
shallow plot.  We are supposed to feel Diane's joy and exuberance at re-
discovering her lost youth and sexuality when the affair begins, then 
join her on a descent into near-madness and alcoholism after Emilio 
dumps her.  Unfortunately, Diane isn't a credible character -- she is 
sketchily developed, and this led to a profound lack of interest on my 
part about her fate once she switched into the self-destructive mode.  
Approached differently, this story could have been devastating, but 
Rouan elects to keep everything surface-deep rather than exploring the 
murky wellspring of emotional pain that drives Diane.  As a result, 
instead of reaching into the territory inhabited by the likes of LEAVING 
LAS VEGAS, POST COITUM comes across as nothing more compelling than a 
97-minute soap opera.  It's heavy-handed, obvious, and not the least bit 
moving.  </P>
<P>     The acting can best be described as uneven.  Rouan gives a raw, 
courageous performance, showing Diane in modes that range from unchecked 
lust to rampant self-pity, but the strength of the actress' passion does 
not guarantee consistently effective work, and she has a tendency to go 
over-the-top (especially in those awful scenes that bookend and 
punctuate the flashbacks).  As Emilio, Boris Terral is bland.  Aside 
from his good looks, he doesn't bring much to the part -- it's difficult 
to see this character as anything more than a function of the plot.  
Rouan needs someone for Diane to have the fling with, but she never 
develops him into something more substantial than a generic younger 
lover.  More impressive than the two leads are the primary supporting 
characters.  Patrick Chesnais creates the film's only sympathetic and 
original individual -- as Diane's husband, he's torn between anger at 
his wife's betrayal, jealousy that she comes alive for another man, and 
impotence that he can do nothing to assuage the consuming pain she feels 
when her lover leaves her.  Finally, as Francois, the writer who relies 
upon Diane for his artistic inspiration, Nils Tavernier gives a solid 
performance in an underwritten part.</P>
<P>     Rouan's intentions are obvious -- she wanted this film to be an 
autopsy of both sides of an unexpected, all-consuming passion:  
exhilaration and devastation.  However, the script betrays her, and POST 
COITUM wallows in half-baked melodrama with a character who seems to be 
hugely overreacting to the end of a short affair (it's Rouan's duty to 
convey why Diane's collapse is well-motivated, but she never does this -
- instead, she relies on the real-life experiences of her viewers to 
fill in the blanks).  POST COITUM almost seems like some kind of 
cinematic shorthand for a more ambitious project.  We see what Rouan is 
striving for, but, at the same time, recognize that she hasn't achieved 
it.  So, like all shorthand, this has more meaning to the author than to 
anyone else.</P>
