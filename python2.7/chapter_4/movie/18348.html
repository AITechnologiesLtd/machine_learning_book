<PRE>TWIN DRAGONS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>In his latest rerelease, Jackie Chan uses a gimmick that Jean Claude
VanDamme aficionados know well.  It's a gimmick that goes something like
this: if one Jackie Chan is good, two must be better!  Unfortunately,
Twin Dragons proves that not to be the case.</P>
<P>Jackie plays a pair of twins, separated at birth.  One, John Ma, under
the guidance of his true parents, becomes a concert pianist,known the
world over.  The other, Boomer, is a mechanic and part time con artist,
with an instinctive knack for martial arts(wouldn't you know).</P>
<P>Raised on opposite corners of the globe, the twins are blissfully
unaware of each other's existence.  That is until fate places them both
in Hong Kong at the same time.  John Ma is there for a concert,but
spends most of his time avoiding the advances of a marriage-minded
woman, Tammy (Nina Li Chi).</P>
<P>Boomer, on the other hand, is in trouble.  An attempt to help his
diminutive friend Tyson (Teddy Robyn) win the love of a singer, Barbara
(Maggie Cheung), earns him the wrath of a local gangster.  But when the
gangsters mistake John Ma for Boomer, hilarity ensues...well, sort of.</P>
<P>Twin Dragons relies even more on comedy than the typical Jackie Chan
film. The mistaken identity gags wear out their welcome almost
immediately, yet the film just keeps them coming.  As is the case with
most of Jackie's rereleased films, Twin Dragons suffers from a horrible
dub, and the resulting sound mix certainly doesn't help the humor any.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan's films have never been praised for their complex plots.
The spectacular fight sequences are what draw the fans.  There's one
good one in Twin Dragons, a climactic battle in an automotive testing
factory. Yet, by the time it finally rolls around, it's a case of too
little, too late. And to top things off, the film doesn't even include
any of Jackie's trademark outtakes over the end credits.  This is a
rerelease sure to disappoint his fans.</P>
<P>Originally released in 1992, Twin Dragons' special effects already seem
cheap and dated.  Twin effects have been around for a very long time,
yet when Jackie and Jackie appear together onscreen it seems like a bad
episode of The Patty Duke Show.  The picture gets grainy, out of focus
in spots, and the dividing line between the actor and himself is so
visible, it's distracting.</P>
<P>If you're looking for a good Jackie Chan film, go rent a subtitled
version of Drunken Master II.   Twin Dragons was a waste of Jackie's
time...twice over.</P>
