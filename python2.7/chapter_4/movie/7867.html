<PRE>                                GET SHORTY
                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Barry Sonnenfeld
Writer: Scott Frank (from the novel by Elmore Leonard) 
Starring: John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo, Danny DeVito, Delroy 
Lindo, Dennis Farina, David Paymer, James Gandolfini, Martin Fererro, 
Miguel Sandoval, Linda Hart, Big Daddy Wayne, Bette Midler, Penny 
Marshall, and the immortal Harvey Keitel</P>
<P>>From the 30-some films based on best-selling pulp writer Elmore 
Leonard's books, this (and probably Quenitn's up-coming "Jackie Brown" 
based on Leonard's "Rum Punch") is probably the only Leonard book to 
ever actually be brilliant.  Most just play out his complex plots and 
get some pulp out of it (like the recent un-spectacular "Pronto," which 
was too TV-movie-esque, even for a TV movie) or make nonsense out of 
them (Burt Reynolds in "Stick" - ???).  But "Get Shorty" finally finds 
that nerve that Leonard has and even goes the next level with it - by 
making satire out of it.  </P>
<P>"Get Shorty" compares Hollywood and the crime business in a flawless 
satire which gets more fun and intriguing every time one watches it (so 
it's one of my faves of all time - this review ISN'T biased - swear to 
God).  John Travolta perfectly inhabits the character of Chili Palmer, 
an ultra-confident Shylock from Miami Beach who loves movies.  He can 
name "Rio Bravo" after hearing Dean Martin utter one line.  He can mouth 
the ending to Orson Welles' "Touch of Evil."  He can even quote lines 
from grade triple Z horror films.  He's basically the man, in my 
opinion.  I mean, even I can't mouth the words to the end of "Touch of 
Evil."</P>
<P>The story starts when Chili gets in trouble with a guy from another 
Miami mob - Ray "Bones" Barboni (the also flawless and highly underrated 
Dennis Farina) - who steals his $399 Serpico-esque black jacket in the 
beginning causing Chili to break his nose and later on shoot some of his 
scalp off.  Ray can't touch him because he's from another mob but 
Chili's mob boss dies from a stroke (or something) from a surprise 
party.  Now Chili is Ray's man and he sends him to fix a blank in his 
book having to do with a stupid dry-cleaner (David Paymer) who got lucky 
and missed a flight that blew up but everyone thinks he was on it and 
has taken his insurance money from his poor wife (who hates him anyway) 
and gone to Vegas (smart idea, let me tell you).  Chili goes out to get 
him but also has to pick up money from a grade triple Z "film" director, 
Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman).  Thus starts Chili's life in L.A, the 
Hollywood/Mafia satire and just the beginning of a typically complex 
Elmore Leonard plot (this is just the first 10 minutes, hang in there!).</P>
<P>Chili decides to stay out there and make movies with Harry Zimm, but 
quality movies.  Chili has pitched his story to Harry and he likes it a 
lot but he wants to make another one, a quality flick called "Mr. 
Lovejoy."  But all his money comes from a crooked Limo-service owner, Bo 
Catlett (the yet again, flawless and underrated Delroy Lindo), who gets 
sucked into the movie business after reading the "Mr. Lovejoy" 
screenplay but gets pushed away from Chili who just wants him to give 
the money and keep his nose in its on place.  Meanwhile, they're trying 
to get huge (yet short) movie star, Martin Weir (the flaw...hell, 
everybody's flawless - Danny DeVito) to be in it so they can get 
financing, and the only way to do it is to have Chili talk with him 
("I'm gonna put a gun to his head, say 'Sign the papers, Martin, or 
you're dead,' and that's it.") but also talk with Martin's ex, a grade 
triple Z movie actress, Karen Flores (Rene Russ - you know it...) whom 
Chili can quote from her crap flicks...and who he has a relationship 
with later on.</P>
<P>All these diverse characters come together in a character clash and by 
the end, people are dead and even crooks have switched from the mafia to 
making movies.  One of the great things the film shows is how easily 
crooks can be influenced by movies and movie actors can be influenced by 
crooks.  For one thing, Chili is a walking film encylcopedia who's every 
move has been influenced by a cornucopia of movies.  His jacket's from 
"Serpico," his slicked-back hair is from Michael Douglas in "Wall 
Street" (proving I read the book too), etc.  Yet when he goes to 
Hollywood, it is Hollywood that is influenced by him.  Immeadiately, 
Harry begins acting tough and saying Chili's trademark "Look at me" 
line...of course, he says it to the wrong person.  And after meeting 
him, Martin Weir is dressing like him and giving a pseudo-Chili look to 
everyone...even driving a replica of Chili's rented mini-van which was 
ironically a mistake.</P>
<P>But this satire would be dull if it didn't have a great screenplay, and 
this one actually quotes from the meister of criminal-lingo, Elmore 
Leonard (come on, you know Quentin was totally influenced by him).  
Travolta said in an interview that the screenplay took out all of his 
dialogue and shortened it.  For example, when Chili finds out his coat 
has been stolen, the script read "Where's my coat?  It cost me $400!" or 
something to that forte.  But Travolta claims he had them put it back to 
the long one of something like "Where's my long-sleeved, black lapel, 
with pockets and everything black jacket that looks like Al Pacino's in 
'Serpico?' 'Cause if you can't find it, you owe me $379!"  Again, I 
don't know the actual quotes, but you get the point that Elmore writes 
great dialogue.  His characters are well-defined and well portrayed by a 
wide assortment of character actors.  Even Gene Hackman plays a totally 
different character - a wannabe toughguy yet a wimp.  </P>
<P>Barry Sonnenfeld, who started out as a Coen Bros. cinematographer and 
later directed the two Addams Family Movies (the first one was okay, but 
the second one was classic) and the upcoming cool-movie-of-the-summer 
"Men in Black" - which looks so cool, it's orgasmic - well, he does an 
awesome job with the film, giving it that right pulp kick as well as 
showing a knack for creating priceless comic moments - from the big 
"Stuntman Fall in the fancy restaurant" to the very subtle stupid limo 
driver who shows a guy from Miami Beach the L.A. ocean.  He's a great 
director and should have gotten much more notice than he did for this 
film.</P>
<P>The best acting job from "Get Shorty" really goes to Travolta, who 
stands out at the top of a great cast (with cameos from Bette Midler 
and, as I said, the immortal Harvey Keitel).  He won the Golden Globe 
for Best Comedic Actor but really should have had a chance at the Oscar 
for his priceless work on this film.  He inhabits every quirk of his 
character and presents a character so likable and so utterly cool (that 
it hurts), that he just makes you applaud him at the end.  This film was 
the deciding factor in whether or not Travolta has actually "come back" 
even after stunning everyone in the world with "Pulp Fiction."  They 
couldn't have chosen a better film to show that he has come back - 
everyone went to see it for the man Travolta and even if they didn't 
like the complex plot and/or appreciate the brilliant black comedy or 
satire, they at least could see Travolta giving a commanding performance 
as one of a character so goddam cool he HAD to be named "Chili."</P>
<P>But the best part of it is all fo it.  It works so great as a whole that 
it is entertaining while it is intelligent.  Imagine that.  "Get Shorty" 
was arguably the best film to come out of 1995.  Thank God someone could 
make a perfect film that year.</P>
