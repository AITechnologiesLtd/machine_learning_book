<PRE>                                   I.Q.
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: I.Q. is both better and worse than
          expectation.  Its playful look at some of the
          greatest minds of the century is not too
          unbelievable.  But the script and the filming show
          real signs of sloppiness.  Tim Robbins never
          manages to be much of a romantic lead.  Rating: 0
          (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     If you enjoyed seeing a Tyrannosaurus Rex turned into a big purple
plush toy named Barney, you have what it takes to appreciate seeing
another giant of bygone science, Albert Einstein, turned into a big,
lovable, avuncular pushover in I.Q.  In fact, you will see not just
Einstein, but Godel and Podolsky as lovable old gentlemen who play
Cupid for Einstein's mathematician niece Catherine Boyd (played by Meg
Ryan) and an auto mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins).  Ed is the last
side in a love triangle.  Boyd is already planning to marry James
Morland (Stephen Fry, who currently plays Jeeves on PBS).  Morland isa
psychologist who performs sadistic experiments on animal and human
subjects and his lab is rarely without the sound of some moaning
subject of his experimentation.  I think the viewer is not supposed to
like Morland.  Walters falls in love with Boyd in a chance meeting with
her.  He begins courting her, and as an experiment, Einstein and some
of his cronies decide to help him.  They decide they have to make an
expert in auto mechanics seem on a par with the experts in quantum
mechanics.</P>
<P>     The first step is to convince Boyd that Walters is more
intelligent than your average auto repairman.  This goes disastrously
awry and it is not long before Walters is presenting papers on "cold
fusion" and interstellar drives to the Princeton Institute of Advanced
Studies.  Soon the joke has taken on national political significance.</P>
<P>     Ryan was an interesting choice to play a mathematician and
Einstein's niece.  While she does not look Jewish as presumably
Einstein's niece would, her quirky acting style, somewhat toned down in
this performance, could easily be attributable to a sort of nervous
energy that someone of high intelligence might have.  Robbins, on the
other hand, always seems a little snide and at the best of times is
never particularly likable in his films.  He and Ryan just do not play
well off of each other.  Surprisingly, Walter Matthau is not too
unbelievable as Albert Einstein.  Some of his dialogue could be more
believable, but the real Einstein apparently did have a child-like,
fun-loving nature as exemplified by famous photos of him riding a small
bicycle and of him sticking his tongue out to make faces for news
cameras.  Walter Matthau's brand of sly humor is not an unreasonable
depiction.</P>
<P>     The real problem with I.Q. is that the script was not ready to
film.  Particularly late in the story, the storytelling becomes a
little cryptic.  Ryan's character makes a deduction that is supposedly
explained by a comment she makes, but it is not clear how.  There are
notable anachronisms.  The film supposedly takes place prior to
Einstein's death, making it April 1955 at the latest, yet the dialogue
uses terms like "mind-meld," "cold fusion," and "space race" that were
not coined while Einstein was alive.  In one sequence we see Walters
and Boyd looking at a perfectly clear sky full of stars, yet less than
three minutes later the script calls for a pouring rain that lasts the
rest of the evening.  A sequence at the very end of the film is
incredibly contrived.  These are all very amateurish script problems
that seem to indicate a rush job.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, where one would expect the script to most fall
down--its depiction of scientists talking shop--is not as bad as it
might have been.  It is not easy for a non-genius to write dialogue
supposedly spoken by a genius.  It could be better here, but some of
the dialogue does deal with the right sorts of issues.  Godel gives an
argument that time does not exist that is easily countered and unworthy
of the real Godel.  But generally the issues discussed are not too
unrealistic.</P>
<P>     I.Q. is directed by Australian Fred Schepisi, who most recently
directed SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION.  The film has a nice look with the
camera work by Ian Baker, but not a look that bears close examination.
Princeton in late March and early April seems unseasonably pleasant.
Meg Ryan wears mostly sun dresses at a time of year when most of the
rest of us in New Jersey would still be dressing warmly.  The cars on
the road seem mostly large and with prominent fins.  Even if the film
is set as late as 1955 this seems unlikely.  (As a side note, Fred
Schepisi apparently always uses Baker for cinematography.  This is
their eleventh film together of the eleven that Schepisi has directed
and the twelve that Baker has filmed.)</P>
<P>     In short, this is a film with some pretty sloppy filmmaking, a
romance with little chemistry, and a few pieces of reasonable humor.
Mostly it is on the level of a TV situation comedy.  I rate it a flat 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
