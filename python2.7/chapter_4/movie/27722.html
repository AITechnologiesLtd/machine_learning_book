DOWN TO EARTH
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In DOWN TO EARTH, Chris Rock plays a struggling standup comic, Lance 
Barton, whose jokes -- "I know this gal so ugly she had to wear makeup 
on the radio" -- have been dying.  As he tries to get ready for his 
life's dream, a slot at the amateur night in the last show at the famous 
Apollo theater, he ends up even deader than his material.  Not one to 
let a technicality like a heavenly address get in his way, he negotiates 
with the heavenly powers (Chazz Palminteri and Eugene Levy) to insert 
him into another earthly body so he can play his big gig.  For the 
record, the hereafter looks like a big blue nightclub.</P>
<P>If this plot sounds familiar, it should.  DOWN TO EARTH is a remake of 
the 1978 film HEAVEN CAN WAIT, starring Warren Beatty.  That film, 
confusingly, was itself a remake, not of the 1943 film HEAVEN CAN WAIT, 
but of the 1941 picture HERE COMES MR. JORDAN.  Now that we've gotten 
that straightened out, we can proceed.</P>
<P>Young, black, slender and poor Lance ends up in the body of Charles 
Wellington, a pudgy, white billionaire who is supposed to be 53 but 
looks a decade older.  Once in his new skins, Lance finds that he sees 
himself, but everyone else still sees Charles's body.  The audience sees 
Lance, except for a few scenes when Charles is rapping or joking with 
black humor, as blacks stare at him in disbelief and dismay.  At those 
times, the audience sees this old white guy disconcertingly trying to 
act black.</P>
<P>Lance transforms Charles from vicious capitalist into kind 
philanthropist.  It isn't quite as magnanimous as it sounds, since Lance 
starts his giving as a way to impress Suntee (Regina King), a community 
activist who opposes Charles's plans for Brooklyn Community Hospital.  
Charles, the 15th richest man in the world, wants his hospital to boost 
profits by turning away people without insurance.  In a dazzling 
performance for the cameras at the hospital's board meeting, Lance, as 
Charles, declares, "Shot in the head, you get a bed."  No one notices 
that Charles's lingo suddenly sounds downscale.  "Drive home safely, tip 
your waitresses," he tells his board when he leaves. "I gotst to go."</P>
<P>It's a good natured story, and Rock radiates a sweet likeableness 
throughout.  But, the bottom line is that the movie is basically one 
long Chris Rock comedy routine.  If you like his shtick, you'll probably 
like the movie.  For my taste, some of his jokes are cute, but most 
don't quite click.  Not a bad movie.  Think of it as a near miss.</P>
<P>DOWN TO EARTH runs 1:27.  It is rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor 
and some drug references and would be fine for kids around 9 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, almost 12, gave the movie ** 1/2, saying that some of 
the jokes were funny but many weren't.  He mentioned several structural 
problems he had with the script, especially the way the last act and the 
ending were handled.</P>
