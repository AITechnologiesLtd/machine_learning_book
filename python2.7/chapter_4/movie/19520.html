<PRE>The Big Lebowski</PRE>
<P>Starring - Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, etc.
Running time - close to two hours.</P>
<P>The Big Lebowski starts off with narration, like so many other movies do. 
However this narration doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  We are introduced to
the movies main character "the dude" (Jeff Bridges) and before you can think
about anything the movie gets off to a start.  I'm not here to explain the plot
of the movie. You can watch the movie to see that plot, I'm here to explain the
importance of this movie in modern day filmmaking.</P>
<P>I may be biased on the topic of this movie but the Big Lebowski is like no
other movie.  It's flow of scenes is a relief to movies with a formula scene
structure.  It's characters are so deep and different that while watching the
movie you feel like they actually exist.  The acting is also well done as each
actor/actress ( there aren't too many females in this movie ) plays their role
well and keeps the characters interesting.  The first time you watch this movie
it definately holds your attention.  I've watched this movie with a lot of
people, some liked it, some loved it and some didn't care for it.  But all of
them admitted it was an interesting movie.</P>
<P>I'm not someone giving this movie a plug so everyone will go out and rent it. 
I'm just a fan of movies and particulary this movie.  The Big Lebowski is
exactly the kind of movie to watch when you need a movie that can make you
think into it.  While watching this movie you almost become part of it.  Few
movies have that power anymore. The Big Lebowski is a gem among modern movies.</P>
