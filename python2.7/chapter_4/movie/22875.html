<P>THREE KINGS (M).

Running time: 114 minutes.</P>
<P>In the 1970 war film Kelly's Heroes, Clint Eastwood led a
ragtag bunch of soldiers who looted Nazi gold as they made their way
across occupied Europe as part of the allied invasion.  David O
Russell's smart action thriller takes a similar premise, but sets it
against the background of the Gulf War of the early 1990's and imbues
it with a healthy dose of cynicism.</P>
<P>In 1991 the Gulf War conflict was winding to a close, as
President Bush and Saddam Hussein negotiated a peace treaty.  However,
for four disenchanted soldiers, another war was just beginning.</P>
<P>Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze, the
director of Being John Malkovich making his acting debut) are bored
with the lack of action they have seen.  When they find a map
supposedly leading to Saddam's bunkers laden with the spoils of war,
they set out to plunder some gold bullion and set themselves up for
life.  Along for the trip is the deeply religious Chief Elgin (Ice
Cube) and veteran soldier Archie Gates (George Clooney), who is on the
verge of resigning his commission anyway.</P>
<P>Unlike Kelly's Heroes, which was purely a caper film, Three
Kings is a war film with a conscience and a political message, and
Russell actually pushes the material in a markedly different
direction.  Somewhere along the way these flawed heroes get caught up
in the aftermath of the war as they end up trying to lead a group of
refugees through dangerous territory to the border and freedom.  They
cannot stand by idly and watch as Saddam's army takes out its
vengeance on these refugees and dispossessed nationals.</P>
<P>Clooney is good as the laconic Gates and gives probably his
best screen performance to date, while Wahlberg is also dynamic as the
brash Barlow.</P>
<P>A cynical exploration of America's involvement in the war,
Three Kings is the Iraqi/Gulf War equivalent of Platoon.  Written by
John Ridley (U-Turn, etc) and Russell, the film questions America's
involvement in the Gulf conflict, as well as the role played by the
media in sensationalising the war.  The film examines the cynical way
in President Bush abandoned the Iraqi people to their fate once the
Kuwaiti oil was safe guarded.  This politically contentious and
controversial sub-text gives Three Kings far more depth, substance and
intelligence than the average Hollywood action flick.  The film marks
something of a change of pace for Russell, better known for the low
budget independent films Spanking The Monkey and Flirting With
Disaster.  However, he also brings a quirky sensibility and stylish
visual quality to the material that sets it apart from most genre
films.  Russell suffuses the action with lots of graphic violence,
slow motion action, stylish camera work, a streak of black humour, and
an inventiveness that is rare in mainstream movies.</P>
