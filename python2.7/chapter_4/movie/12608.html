                   FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS</PRE>
<P>This is a film you will either loathe (The title tells it all) or
love.   Put me down for the former.  Despite being based on Hunter
S. Thompson's very popular 1970s book that swept through all the
colleges, Terry Gilliam erred in trying to make it into a movie. The
results are disastrous.</P>
<P>In the 1970s, bad things were happening all over our country;  our
students were in a turmoil.    Drugs were in.  Even respectable
professors told their students that LSD was harmless and would broaden
their lives, give inspiration to artists.  So it was that many got
stoned and stayed that way for years with dropping out of school
becoming a frequent occurrence.</P>
<P>This film is about that era and about two who lived through that period.
The film's problem is that every scene is nothing more than a
duplicate of what went before: drugs taken to excess, the effects
never allowed to wear off, disgusting uninhibited behavior by both
principal characters.    To indicate that would have been fine; to
show every moment of their miserable lives, in detail, becomes too
obnoxiously boring.</P>
<P>I have been an admirer of Johnny Depp as an actor since first seeing
him in the wonderful "WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE" (the same film that
had Leonardo di Caprio in a great performance as a retarded young
man).   Here Depp is Raoul Duke, a sportswriter.   Depp is outlandishly
terrific as the stoned writer but after an hour of the same, the
excitement he engendered began to pall.  There is a limit to how much
one can take of repetitive acting with only changes in the scenery,
the location.</P>
<P>Duke rides to Las Vegas with his fat-bellied attorney, Dr. Gonzo,
(Benicio del Toro) to Las Vegas.   Again, what starts out as weirdly
funny soon slows to a halt.  Is Dr. Gonzo, belly protruding through
his open shirt while he lies clothed in a water-filled bathtub, funny?
I think not.</P>
<P>Director Terry Gilliam has made some very entertaining films (Time
Bandits, The Adventures of the Baron Munchausen, The Fisher King, 12
Monkeys . . . and more) but Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is not one
of them.</P>
