HEARTBREAKERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In David Mirkin's HEARTBREAKERS, a sweet comedy which plays like a 
lighthearted version of THE GRIFTERS, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love 
Hewitt are a mother/daughter pair of con artists.  Although they scam 
for everything from food to gas, their specialty is marriage 
settlements.  </P>
<P>When we first meet our connivers, Max (Weaver) is marrying Dean Cumanno 
(Ray Liotta), a respectable New Jersey chop shop owner.  When his new 
secretary, Page (Hewitt), entices him into a little oral sex, his wife 
of 18 hours arrives to catch them in the act.  "Honey, it isn't what it 
looks like here," Dean tries to explain to Max.  "Her hair got stuck in 
my zipper."  Cut to the lawyers office in which Max leaves with a chunk 
of cash and one of Dean's freshly built Mercedes.  </P>
<P>Although they look like Mutt and Jeff with their dramatic height 
difference, Weaver and Hewitt are a convincing and funny choice as 
relatives and rivals.  The rebellious Page thinks that Max treats her 
like a little kid, and Max thinks that Page isn't ready to go solo like 
she plans.  Their confidence games are quite believable.  Max looks like 
someone who would sweep you off your feet into an early marriage 
proposal.  And Page, with her lovely legs, micro skirts and ERIN 
BROCKOVICH-type bras that push her generous breasts skyward, looks like 
someone who might tempt even the most married of married men.  In short, 
the deliciously caustic chemistry between Weaver and Hewitt is the best 
part of the movie.  </P>
<P>The weakest link, other than the excessive running time, is the 
supporting cast.  Although Liotta is impressive, most of the others are 
either underutilized or miscast.  Anne Bancroft delivers a wooden 
performance as an IRS agent who forces the two crooks into their most 
ambitious scam ever.  Jason Lee (ALMOST FAMOUS), who isn't given much to 
do as the only guy with whom Page ever falls in love, phones in his 
performance.</P>
<P>As a cliché of a rich old geezer with yellow teeth, Gene Hackman coughs 
his way through his part as William B. Tensy, a tobacco company CEO with 
millions to burn.  If he will just live long enough to tie the knot with 
Max, she and her daughter will be able to pay their back taxes and live 
on easy street for the rest of their lives.  But Page hates the whole 
idea.  "I'm not dating the walking dead," she bitterly informs her 
mother, who replies, "we better work fast."</P>
<P>In Tensy's most memorable line, he reveals the secret of what really 
turns on a tobacco millionaire -- "smoke billowing out of a woman's hot, 
red nostrils."  The image almost makes the unflappable, non-smoking Max 
gag.  Gag isn't something you will do while watching this brightly 
written comedy.  HEARTBREAKERS isn't any laugh riot, but it is 
entertaining fun.  It's the sort of picture that will leave you with a 
smile on your face and a feeling that you got your money's worth.</P>
<P>HEARTBREAKERS runs needlessly long at 2:03.  It is officially rated 
PG-13 for sex-related content including dialogue, and with scenes of 
oral sex and bondage, this is certainly a film unsuitable for those 
under 13.</P>
