<P>At first, things did not look good for Frank McCourt. The eldest of six 
children in a poor Irish family, born in America before his parents made the 
fatal decision to go back to the old country looking for work, he witnessed 
three of his siblings die before he was old enough to take his first 
communion. His family, living in Limerick in the '30s and '40s, had to put up 
with a flooded house next to a communal lavatory, a city plagued by 
tuberculosis and a man of the house with a fondness for the drink. Malachy 
McCourt didn't often have a job, but when he did, the wages were spent on 
Guinness.</P>
<P>And yet Frank did endure, and prevail. He coped with a no-good father, 
lunatic teachers and bouts of conjunctivitis and diptheria; then returned to 
America, got a degree, became a teacher and wrote a pair of best-selling 
autobiographies, "Angela's Ashes" and "'Tis". The movie rights to Frank's 
memoirs were quickly snapped up -- unsurprising, as tales of hardship, 
poverty, misery and escape are just what studios need for their Oscar season 
prestige releases.</P>
<P>The film of "Angela's Ashes" has been directed by Alan Parker, whose credits 
make him seem ideal: "The Commitments" was an Irish film, "Bugsy Malone" was 
filled with wonderful child performances and few big movies are as harsh as 
"Midnight Express" or "Mississippi Burning". Here, however, he doesn't have 
so much as a basic grasp on the material -- this should not be the story of 
Frank McCourt's suffering, but that of his survival, and what should be 
emphasised is the way he maintained his sanity by using gallows humour and 
ambitious dreaming. Instead, the movie shows us a series of miserable 
vignettes, which end with Frank suddenly hopping onto a boat to get away from 
everything.</P>
<P>There is never any rhythm established; Parker has just filmed all the moments 
of the book that took place in Limerick and edited them together in a way 
that keeps jumping ahead but still takes two-and-a-half hours to end. He and 
his co-writer, Laura Jones, should have taken a look at Steven Spielberg's 
brilliant adaptation of "The Color Purple", another rambling, episodic novel 
about growing up in brutal surroundings. It makes clear the main character's 
wish to reunite with her sister, and uses that ever-present desire as the 
backbone of the film, to give some significance to everything else that goes 
on. Here, the scenes in America are over before the opening credits, and 
we're left with no indication that Frank even remembers the place, let alone 
that he yearns to go back there more than anything.</P>
<P>The film stars Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle, but even the acting is off. 
People who are unfamiliar with the source material will still be able to 
detect which lines are direct quotes -- the performers seem to say them in 
respectful inverted commas, after solemn dramatic pauses. There is no life 
here, especially not in the narrator, Andrew Bennett, whose flat, forced, 
monotonous delivery kills every bit of irony and truth the script assigns him.</P>
<P>"Angela's Ashes" is a terrific production, with realistic period detail and 
atmospheric photography. But it bewilders me that this is the film Parker, 
one of the best of all working directors, has been so publicly exerting 
himself over for the past two years. Perhaps he put so much effort into 
worrying about getting it right that he forgot to actually do so. Is it a 
dull waste of time, talent and toil? 'Tis.</P>
