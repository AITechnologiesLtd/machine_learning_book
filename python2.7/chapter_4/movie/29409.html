<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A minor film noir directed with verve by Anthony Mann, about a part-time private
letter carrier who steals money from a lawyer's office and gets involved in a
murder rap. The crime caper was too absurd and trite to carry the film, but the
fast-pace and the finale featuring an exciting car chase through the deserted
streets of Lower Manhattan gave the film some oomph. </P>
<P>Joe Norson (Farley Granger) is someone who feels he let his pregnant wife down
by not earning enough money to give her the finer things in life, and he thinks
his wife should have a private room when she goes to the hospital for their
expected baby. Temptation comes his way when he delivers the office mail to
Victor Backett (Ryan) and sees $200 on the floor being placed in a filing
cabinet. He returns to break-in and steal $30,000 in that cabinet, a sum that
startles him as he panics at the thought of so much money in his possession. He
doesn't realize that the money is from a blackmail scheme run by Backett's
girlfriend, "Lucky" Colner (Jergens), on an elderly married man (Harvey).
Backett, not wanting to take chances of anyone squealing, has his ex-con former
client whom he got out on parole, the 'Big Fellow,' Georgie Garsell (Craig),
strangle Lucky and dump her body in the East River. </P>
<P>This murder brings about a full-scale murder investigation, led by Captain
Anderson 
(Kelly) and Detective Stanley Simon (Charles McGraw). Meanwhile Joe goes into a
panic about what he did and has no clear plan about what to do, as he takes some
money for immediate use and wraps the rest in a package and asks the bartender
Nick Drummon (Max) to hold it for him. He tells his wife that he got a job
Upstate and will be gone a few days. But, while staying in a cheap hotel in
town, after thinking over what he did, he foolishly walks into Backett's office
and tells him he took the money from him. But Backett pretends he doesn't know
what he's saying, as he stalls to check out the story. The gangsters then force
him to give him the money, but the bartender ran away with the real package and
left him a phony one. After being worked over by them and thrown out of their
car, he tracks down the bartender. But he's too late, as the gangsters got their
first and took the money and killed the bartender. </P>
<P>This leads Joe through the dark spots in NYC where he finds George's nightclub
singer girlfriend, Harriet (Hagen), who steers him to the gangsters, Vic,
George, and the cab driver Larry (Bellaver). The gang kills Harriet rather than
take a chance on the cops nabbing her and then they decide to kill Joe by the
East River, as at gunpoint they force him to walk down to the taxi. On there way
to the East River, at the Washington Square Market, the police pick up their
trail and a high-speed chase ensues, with the criminals killed and Joe severly
hurt in the car crash as he is carried out in a stretcher. He's reunited with
his forgiving wife and is forgiven by the cops, as this bleak film ends on a
happy note. </P>
<P>It was a taut suspense film, catching the despair of the protagonist who because
of his human failings had a momentary lapse in good judgment and went through a
hellish experience to atone for his misdeed. The strength in the film lies in
the oppressive atmosphere set by seeing how the tall buildings and narrow
streets of the city play against him reacting as a wounded animal trying to
survive, scared and feeling too weak to help himself as his American Dream is
crumbling right before him. Both Granger and O'Donnell are borrowed from MGM and
Samuel Goldwyn respectively, as this studio hoped they could duplicate the
success they both had while starring in Ray's RKO thriller They Live By Night.
But they just couldn't get any romance going in this film to make the story seem
more palpable, as it works mainly for its action sequences. </P>
