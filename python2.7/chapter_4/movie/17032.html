 Director:  Ulu Grosbard

 Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Treat Williams, Jonathan Jackson,
John Kapelos, Ryan Merriman, Whoopi Goldberg</P>
<P>   They say that blood is thicker than water and that biology
is destiny.  This means that no matter what friends you make
and what business acquaintances you bond with, you can
ultimately trust only your own family.</P>
<P>   They also say that no one should profit from the outcomes
of a criminal act.  If you innocently buy a Rolex watch which
is later found to have been stolen by the seller, you are
required to return the watch to its rightful owner.</P>
<P>   These homilies underscore Ulu Grosbard's "The Deep End
of the Ocean," adapted by Stephen Schiff from the best-
selling novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard.  The story centers on a
boy not quite three years of age who suddenly disappears
from a hotel lobby when his mother briefly turns her back. 
When he is found nine years later remembering nothing
about his true parents, he is taken from his adoptive father's
home and placed back with his real mom and dad.  If blood is
thicker than water, he should quickly acclimate to the new
surroundings, content to be with his natural parents.  The
judicial system also considers that a boy who is kidnapped by
a woman, later adopted by a man who is innocent of the
crime. must return him in the same manner that we he would
have to give up a stolen Rolex that he may have blamelessly
purchased.</P>
<P>   Though the seventy-year-old Ulu Grosbard has worked only
sporadically in the film industry, he appears a wise choice to
direct a movie of this genre.  Thirty years ago he helmed a
film adaptation of Frank Gilroy's play "The Subject Was
Roses," about a young veteran's strained relationship with his
parents, though three years later he proved inept in dealing
with comedy when he directed Dustin Hoffman in "Who is
Harry Kellerman and Why is He Saying Those Terrible Things
About Me?"  "The Deep End of the Ocean," like "Roses," is
about strained relationships between a twelve-year-old kid,
Ben, and his parents; between Ben and his older brother
Vincent; and between Ben's adoptive father and the boy's
natural parents.  Anguish, tensions, and hostilities fill the
screen, leaving little time even for Whoopi Goldberg's comic
touches in a melodrama that goes clear over the border into
the realm of TV soap opera.</P>
<P>   The title of the film comes from a quote in Jacqueline
Mitchard's 1996 book, a novel which proves only that the
public's taste for conventional, tear-jerking family stories is
insatiable.  "Are we at the deep end, Mom?" wonders little
Ben, to which the mother replies, "This is the ocean, Ben. 
There is no deep end of the ocean."  "It looks too deep,"
counters the kid.  "Don't be afraid," Mom reassures him. 
"Mama would never let the ocean snatch you away."</P>
<P>   Despite this promise made by Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer) to
her child, Ben (Michael McElroy), she leaves the boy briefly
in the care of his seven-year-old brother, Vincent (Cory Buck)
as she straightens out hotel reservations at a high-school
reunion in Chicago.  The kid vanishes.  Though half the
Chicago police force search frantically for the lad, he does
not turn up--for nine years.  When the 12-year-old Ben (Ryan
Merriman) does turn up in a coincidence far too improbable
to believe, he is ordered to return to his natural folks against
his will.  Given a similar situation, wouldn't you rebel against
leaving a man who has loved and sheltered you for nine
years only to be put into a strange home of people you do
not remember and with whom you spent only one-third of that
time?  The question that pervades the film is: Will the kid do the
right thing and return to the man who has shown him kindness and
affection for nine years?  Or will he follow his genes back to his
"natural" home?</P>
<P>   The dialogue is filled with fatuous daytime-TV dialogue. 
Pat Cappadora (Treat Williams), the boy's father, appeals to
his distraught wife Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer), "All I want is for us
to be a family again."  In another situation, Beth's friend
declares, "I would never do a thing to hurt you."  Ben's
adoptive father George (John Kapelos) looks with pity on his
boy's sorrowful appearance and angrily informs his real
parents, "He's never had a sad day in his life....today he's the
saddest boy in the world." Even the attempts at comedy by
Whoopi Goldberg as police detective Candy Bliss are feeble. 
When Beth tries to hug the sympathetic detective, she pulls
back reflexively, excusing herself by stating that she's gay,
she's black, and "the eyes of Texas are on me."  </P>
<P>   Michelle Pfeiffer does what she can with a banal script to
evoke sympathy from the movie audience while Treat
Williams is underutilized as the demanding father.  The best
performances are from young Ryan Merriman as the
bewildered but highly intelligent and articulate Ben, who is as
good at throwing baskets on the family court as he is in
expressing his feelings without even a single use of words
such as "like," "you know what I'm saying," and "totally." 
Jonathan Jackson is fine as the typical teenager who has to
deal with the sibling envy that led him to lose his brother nine
years back and which even now compels him to persuade the
boy to run away from home.</P>
<P>   Though the film is superior to the hopelessly cloying
"Message in a Bottle," "The Deep End of the Ocean" drowns
in its own mawkishness after feeble attempts now and then to
come up for air.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 106 minutes.  (C) 1999
