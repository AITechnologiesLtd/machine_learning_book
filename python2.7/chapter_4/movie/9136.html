<PRE>                                       
                                Cop Land (1997)</PRE>
<P>  Seen on 20 September 1997 at the Cineplex Baronet Coronet for free.</P>
<P>   What has an ensemble cast, pointless flashbacks, a love of policemen,
   90 minutes to bore an audience to death, has only two funny moments,
   one overblown dramatic moment, and stinks? No, it's not Mayor
   Giuliani's campaign. It's Cop Land. A lot of people were leaving the
   theatre within the first half hour. Of course, it was free to anyone
   who was there for the preview. I would have left, but I rarely leave a
   theatre, and besides, I had to see if this would be the worst movie I
   have seen since Excess Baggage.</P>
<P>   Cop Land would probably read better than it films. The high-concept
   premise here is that Garrison, NJ (not it's real name) is a town of
   1280 people, mostly police (all of whom are white) and their families
   and embroiled in a deep cover up. Already, the prospect of watching
   corrupt straight white men is unappealing; I could just watch the news
   every night and review that.</P>
<P>   Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) is the "law" in
   Garrison, and he has a childlike trust in those who have empowered him
   to guard the American Dream. The worst thing that happens to him is
   bumping his nose on the steering wheel while swerving to miss a deer
   caught in his headlights. But the American Dream, in this case, is
   built an a lie. Oooooo. How shocking. Corrupt cops (Harvey Keitel, Ray
   Liotta, Peter Berg, etc.) work in New York City, which they hate, and
   come home to be above the law to a town across the George Washington
   Bridge, which, oh so ironically, overlooks New York.</P>
<P>   The plot thickens when hero cop "Superboy" (Michael Rappoport) screws
   up and is forced fake his own death after killing two delinquent,
   reckless, but ultimately harmless black youth. Lots of subplots and
   "buddy boy" nonsense ensues. The film takes its sweet time and when
   Freddy finally figures out he is living in a gangster movie, it is too
   late to care. That he is deaf in one ear, the result of saving the
   love of his teen years, who married some other putz, keeps him off the
   NYPD he reveres, and out of our sympathies.</P>
<P>   Ultimately, Cop Land is something that would have been a great book,
   but is in fact, a dreadful movie. There are simply too many characters
   and subplots to keep track of or care about. I watch soap operas and
   read 19th Century Russian novels, but this was too much of a
   challenge. There are so many other ways to watch stories like these,
   and one springs to mind. NYPD Blue. Tuesday nights on ABC, 10 Eastern,
   9 Central. Slow and steady builds audience interest. Throwing dressed
   up pigs (no pun intended) in the form of an All-Star cast into this
   mishmash was a real waste. The only actor missing from this mix was
   Steve Buscemi.</P>
<P>   One of Three Woman Shown in the Cast: Cathy Moriarity, who is often
   seen holding a drink or looking like she ought to be.</P>
<P>   Most Annoyed Actor with a Bad Haircut: Robert De Niro as the very
   exasperated Internal Affairs officer with a very very very bad
   haircut.</P>
<P>   Smartest Actor: Janeane Garofolo, as the Sheriff's Deputy who does the
   only logical thing in the movie; she leaves town.</P>
<P>   Best Ironic Line: Ray Liotta tells Stallone that there are two kinds
   of people in this world: Video game players and pinball players. I
   guess those were the intended audience members.</P>
