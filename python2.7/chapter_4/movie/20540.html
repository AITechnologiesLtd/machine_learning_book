<P>_Best_Laid_Plans_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>I have much to say about _Best_Laid_Plans_, but I'm afraid that I can't
really say much of anything about it.  To go into detail is to ruin the
biggest pleasure the film has to offer--and if I did that, I'm afraid
there's not too much else left to enjoy in director Mike Barker's
interesting but ultimately underwhelming film.</P>
<P>The film opens with two old college buddies, Nick (Alessandro Nivola)
and Bryce (Josh Brolin), talking over drinks at a bar in their small
hometown of Tropico.  With the entrance of a fetching young blonde (Reese
Witherspoon), the film fades out, and when it fades back in, a few hours
have passed, and Bryce finds himself in a predicament that he feels only
Nick can bail him out of--Bryce had sex with the girl, who, as it turns
out, is underage, and in a panic, he tied her up and is holding her
hostage in the basement.</P>
<P>The rest of _Best_Laid_Plans_ should be left a mystery; needless to say,
as the title implies, there are some plans involved, and, in turn, the
implication that comes with calling them "best laid"--as in those of mice
and men, and, consequently, as in them going awry.  These plans, however,
are not what one would expect, and the series of twists upon twists that
writer Ted Griffin devises does keep one interested in what happens next.</P>
<P>The problem, however, is what appears to be the trademark of Griffin,
whose only other effort was the satirical cannibalism movie
_Ravenous_--that is, the blending of elements that aren't normally mixed.
 Grisly subject matter (with the bloody gore to match) and sometimes
broad satire were paired fairly uneasily in _Ravenous_, and here the odd
combo is that of a dark, mean-spirited thriller with straightforward
romantic elements.  It would take very skilled jugglers in the writing
and directing departments to mix these opposite ends of the emotional
spectrum without appearing to exhibit a split personality, which, I'm
afraid, is how _Best_Laid_Plans_ comes off; the most telling moment is
the film's resolution, which adds a lethally unnatural flavor of sugar to
the film's black bile.</P>
<P>The actors, for the most part, fare well under the circumstances; Nivola
is convincing (if unspectacular), and Witherspoon, who has never given a
bad performance, doesn't break her streak here.  The weakest link is
Brolin's annoying Bryce, but in his defense, a lot of that is the fault
of the writing; Bryce displays very few, if any, redeeming qualities,
making one wonder why Nick would keep him as a friend--and thus removing
any resonance from the whole "betrayal of friendship" theme.</P>
<P>Which brings us back to the title.  Barker and Griffin had some
interesting ingredients in place for this noirish thriller, and obviously
had an intriguingly twisty course clearly mapped out for themselves. 
Alas, much like those mice and men...</P>
