<P>`The Hurricane', the true story of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin
`Hurricane' Carter, is obviously a burden of love on behalf on the
filmmakers. In particular, the commendable effort of Canadian director
Norman Jewison speaks nothing but painstaking dedication. Jewison has
extracted every possible ounce of compelling drama out of Carter's
inspirational battle for justice, and channeled it into a stunningly
powerful biography. The man with center-stage, however, is Denzel
Washington.</P>
<P>Washington's commanding, heartfelt performance as the title character
only further justifies the fact that he could be the best actor working
in Hollywood today. His seductive puppy-dog eyes and polished speech
mannerisms entrance the viewer, and from there, the effortless nuance
and understated power of character take over. Washington's deeply
affecting portrayal of The Hurricane is just another impressive file to
add into the great performance cabinet of 1999, but there is something
that makes this one stand out. Perhaps it's because his characterization
is based upon that of an actual individual, and that Carter's story is
already compelling and touching before being formatted to a theatrical
biography. But it's Denzel who goes that extra yard to identify with the
racial injustice that Carter dealt with, and all the while remaining
loyal and true to his story. It's almost unfortunate that bits and
pieces of `The Hurricane' are too conventional, and that dramatic
authority is lacking during a few crucial moments.</P>
<P>The Hurricane's story begins in the boxing ring, just as Carter has
upset the favored defender and become the new Welter Weight Champion.
But there is one determined obstacle in his journey to fame: racism.
Carter is wrongly accused for a multiple-homicide by a racist police
officer (Dan Hedaya) who has hounded him since he was 11-years old. Of
course, the ruling tips in favor of his guilt, and in 1966 Carter is
sentenced to prison for the remainder of his natural life. At this
point, Jewison has more than persuaded the audience that the world is a
cruel and unjust place. But there is a faint light of hope at the end of
The Hurricane's tunnel, and that hope lies within a small group of
Canadians who would rally to set him free. Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon
Shannon), a Brooklyn youth being tutored in Toronto by three Canadian
adults, manages to find a copy of The Hurricane's autobiography, `The
Sixteenth Round'. Lesra is deeply moved by the story, and feels
compelled to meet Carter in person and somehow bring his case to a
Federal court.</P>
<P>`The Hurricane' is powerful stuff. Mind you, it's also a constant uphill
battle to establish some of the essential dramatic details. Jewison
crafts a beautiful story with a potent emotional backbone, only fumbling
the ball on a few childhood flashbacks, which are brief and rather
unconvincing. All of the performances are stellar. Although they are
never granted more than a peripheral outlook, Liev Schreiber, Deborah
Kara Unger and John Hannah are excellent in their roles as the
courageous Canadian trio who fight valiantly for Hurricane's freedom.
Dan Hedaya succeeds in making us want to put his character through a
meat grinder. The remainder of supporting cast includes David Paymer and
Rod Steiger, both playing small but equally pivotal roles. The
screenplay in `The Hurricane' borders on cliché too often, including an
excessive good cop-bad cop scenario, but the performances and steadfast
direction never taper off course.</P>
<P>Washington's performance is a great one in a semi-great movie. Another
component that is thankfully added is the believable and ultimately
heartfelt relationship between Rubin and Lesra. There is a sense of
discovery with their interaction together. It's a great feeling, just as
it must have been for the real Hurricane upon his first meeting with
this young Brooklyn lad who had identified with his novel. This
feel-good message adds fuel to the powerful fire of `The Hurricane', and
helps it overcome the conventional flaws that simmer within it's
screenplay. Of course, it all boils down to the Canadians gathering
information and connecting the dots of various witness statements to
find the proper documents for the courts to release Hurricane from
prison. Even though the finale is slightly melodramatic and easy to
anticipate, the message of `The Hurricane' radiates throughout this
inspirational biography.</P>
<P>`Hate put me in prison. Love's gonna bust me out'. As soon as Washington
speaks these words, we realize our journey has been worthwhile. Just as
justice does for Mr. Rubin Carter, `The Hurricane' prevails in the end.</P>
