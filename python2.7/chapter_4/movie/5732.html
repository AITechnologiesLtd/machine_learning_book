<PRE>                               TRAINSPOTTING
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's the most heavily-hyped and anticipated indie film I have ever seen.</P>
<P>     It's a foul and grotesque exercise in nausea, yet completely
engrossing from the start.</P>
<P>     It's the most experimental film to gain a large release in America
since SLACKER.</P>
<P>     Its subject matter is something eschewed by almost everybody -- heroin
addiction.</P>
<P>     Its unique structure, built around metaphor and over-the-top imagery,
will make the film inaccessible to most audiences, as if the thick Scottish
accents that make most of the dialogue indecipherable don't already.</P>
<PRE>     It's TRAINSPOTTING, and it's great.</PRE>
<P>     Making an independent movie about drug addiction isn't the easiest
thing in the world.  Gus Van Sant tried it awhile back, in DRUGSTORE
COWBOY, with fair success.  This time it's director Danny Boyle (who helmed
last year's Movie Emporium #1 Film of the Year, SHALLOW GRAVE), with a few
familiar faces from the aforementioned masterpiece (led by GRAVE's Ewan
McGregor, as our narrator Renton) and a lot of Boyle's signature
avant-garde direction.</P>
<P>     The story is based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel of the same name, as
TRAINSPOTTING tracks the downward -- and upward -- spirals of a group of
heroin-addicted friends in Scotland.  The title comes from a popular
pastime in Britain, where people apparently sit by the tracks and record
every possible detail of the passing trains -- sometimes for days at a
time.  The futility of this task is yet another metaphor in a
metaphor-bloated picture, where nothing on the screen is exactly what it
seems.</P>
<P>     The film truly defies description, and even a full 12 months of hype
couldn't adequately prepare me for what I eventually saw.  Suffice it to
say that this horribly nasty and raw expose of how unglamorous the junkie
life really is manages to overpower anything else I've seen on film in a
long while.  Beyond that, you'll just have to see for yourself.  But *be
prepared* to be shocked, disgusted, and at the same time, enthralled.</P>
<P>     I could talk about the bothersome aspects of TRAINSPOTTING:  an
annoying techno soundtrack, a dragging middle section, and rapid-fire,
heavily-accented dialogue that went in my ears and never quite reached my
brain.  Or I could talk about how, after leaving the theater, I wanted to
immediately see the film again.  But, as TRAINSPOTTING's Renton puts it,
why would I want to do a thing like that?</P>
