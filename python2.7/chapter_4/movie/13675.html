<PRE>Review: The Negotiator</PRE>
<P>Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, David Morse, Ron Rifkin, J.T.
Walsh, Paul Giamatti, John Spencer</P>
<PRE>Directed by F. Gary Gray
Approx running time 130 min</PRE>
<P>The Negotiator opens with a tense hostage situation that is extremely
well-directed. A man is pressing a shotgun to the head of a little girl
as Danny Roman (Jackson) attempts to talk him down, risking his own
life. At the end of the ten minute scene, the audience lets out their
breath. You'd think they'd been holding it the whole time. After that
scene, we get the obligitory set up for the focus of the film. That calm
sequence lasts another ten minutes. Then hold on to your wigs and keys,
folks, because the next hour and fifty minutes takes you on one hell of
a ride.</P>
<P>Danny Roman is a top-notch hostage negotiator who has been accused of
killing his partner and embezzling funds from the department. In a last
resort attempt to clear his name, he takes hostages on the 20th floor of
the Chicago Federal Building. His demands are that in eight hours, the
informant be found, the muderer be found, and he be let off the hook.
The catch is that Chris Sabean (Spacey), a prime negotiator from
Chicago's west side, must act as the mediator. Roman knows the man's
strengths, and believes that since his friends have turned on him, that
only a stranger (one of equal mind) can be trusted.</P>
<P>F. Gary Gray, a student of the MTV style of movie directing, does a much
better job than most of his peers. Though The Negotiator occasionally
feels like a spinoff of The Rock, Gray does some fantastic work. His
greatest achievement is keeping the audience on the edge of their seats
for nearly two hours. Once the film gets going, it doesn't let up. There
is a constantly moving camera (which adds tension to any film), but it
is very subtle and takes small slow movements to build up tension.</P>
<P>Some of The Negotiator's best moments come from the dichotomy created
from having a major negotiator dealing with his contemporaries. One
scene early on is extremely funny, and it breaks the ice between
characters. In a sequence reminiscent of Jules' "What does Marsellus
Wallace look like?!!" interrogation from Pulp Fiction, Roman educates an
inexperienced cop on what NOT to say during negotiations.</P>
<P>Paul Giamatti, a two bit crook in the wrong place in the wrong time,
provides excellent comic relief as well. He has the film's best lines by
far. The two leads provide nothing less than their best as the two
strangers who know each other well. Jackson runs the gamut of emotions
and does them all well. Spacey, who seems to pinball back and forth
between psycho and good guy in his career, manages another fine turn as
a take-charge smart cop. J.T. Walsh, who died shortly after the film
wrapped, ends his filmography with another perfect scumbag. But he never
broke from that pattern, and he too turns in a fine performance. Who
better to play the loathesome heavy?</P>
<P>Though the ending is a bit anti-climactic, The Negotiator is as good as
any in its genre. It equals Die Hard and Lethal Weapon in it's strength
and originality. (Though there is a fair share of "borrowing" from
previous films.) And there is no doubt that we could use another
Spacey/Jackson pairing real soon.</P>
