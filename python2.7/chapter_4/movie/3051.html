<PRE>                               I LIKE IT LIKE THAT
                       A film review by Michael John Legeros
                        Copyright 1994 Michael John Legeros</PRE>
<PRE>Written 
 & Directed by  Darnell Martin
Cast            Lauren Velez, Jon Seda Rita Moreno, Jesse Borrego,
                Tomas Melly, Lisa Vidal, and Griffin Dunne (!)
MPAA Rating     "R" (presumably for sex and language)
Running Time    Approx. 110 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>===</PRE>
<P>     The first major motion picture made by an African=American woman
(as if that matters), I LIKE IT LIKE THAT is one of the best romantic
comedies you'll see on screen this year.</P>
<P>     The story is about the emotional, sexual, and economic pressures
faced by a lower-income Latino couple; two young people trying to raise
their kids in an aggressive Bronx neighborhood.  "Street life" is
tough, but Lisette and Chino (Velez and Seda) have stayed together for
ten years.  That is, until a citywide blackout changes their lives
forever.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Darnell Martin does the impossible here,
maintaining a breezy, easy tone while incorporating the grim realities
of urban living.  She keeps her film funny-- sometimes *too* funny--
and never turns away the more sensitive subjects. Watch how smoothly
she handles Chino's eleventh-hour encounter with a neighborhood drug
dealer.</P>
<P>     Her film is also very sexual, though neither offensive nor
pornographic (in case you live in North Carolina and happen to be
consuming alcohol at the time of viewing).  The opening sequence, for
example, centers on Chico's, ahem, "staying power."</P>
<PRE>     Mainstream movies should be so frank.</PRE>
