<PRE>Twilight (R) *
Starring Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon
Directed by Robert Benton
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>"Doesn't it bother you that people like Catherine Hayward and Jack Ames can
prance right through life with everyone else, guys like you and me left to pick
up the pieces?" Asks Raymond Hope (James Garner) to Harry Ross. (Newman) They
are discussing Susan Sarandon and Gene Hackman and the sudden disappearance of
Susan's former husband in Twilight, a supposed nostalgic piece of the old 40s
crime dramas. Yes it bothers me! Especially since the audience is asked to pick
up the pieces of this horrible modernized detective story.</P>
<P>Harry is being interviewed about his past in a jail cell, he begins to tell the
tale of how we got involved with the Ames family. He was referred by Raymond
just after his alcoholism destroyed his life. This begins is a mindless chase
over a $10,000 payment of something that happened in Mexico that's full of
stereotypical characters and bad acting to reach a final conclusion. The actual
parts of the film that lead to the finale (if you can even call it that) take
no more than ten or fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>So, what else is offered to make this a 96 minute movie you ask. The nostalgia
forties piece gets a modern dose of sex and violence. For instance, Stockard
Channing is the only female character, whose breasts, we do not see! James
Garner is the only one not having sex. And Gene Hackman is the only person who
hasn't shot anyone! If this sounds like a piece of filth, it is. </P>
<P>The use of Gloria as a subplot is also a very weak excuse to pile on the
violence. Even when she clubs him over the head, puts a gun to his face, and
later tries to demand more money and kill him again. A couple of minutes before
she dies (yes I'm giving away the plot, but trust me, you won't care anyway)
she is suddenly made into a complex character with feelings that we are all
supposed to grieve for.</P>
<P>This isn't to mention the fact over overwhelming cheese. Whereas in Dead Men
Don't Wear Plaid (yes that was a comedy but I'm on a roll here) the cheese was
used effectively and the actors were aware of it, this is supposed to come on
as real drama. </P>
<P>Let me make this review shorter for you: If you enjoy inflicting pain on
yourself, over and over again while constantly swearing and making crude sexual
comments while baring your chest, than this is the film for you. If not, don't
see Twilight, the film gets my * star.</P>
