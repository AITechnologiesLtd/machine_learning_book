<PRE>                             LITTLE VOICE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A woman's over-powering personality
          ruins her own life and the life of her talented
          daughter.  Brenda Blethyn and Jane Horrocks give
          strong performances in a downbeat look at English
          lower-middle class life.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high
          +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     A big personality can push out of the way all personalities around
it.  Mari Hoff (played by Brenda Blethyn) is a woman with a big
personality and a big voice.  When she enters a room she squeezes out
just about everybody else.  Both her best friend and her daughter are
nearly mute in her overpowering and frequently vulgar presence.  It is
not that she has any intelligence to spread around but she dominates
all about her by verbally overpowering them.  One of the few people who
can get a word in when talking to Mari is Ray Say (Michael Caine).  He
is an entertainment promoter well past his prime, but who denies the
truth even to himself.  He promotes pointless acts that are more
pitiful than entertaining.  Still, Ray has big plans that obviously are
of little value even to Ray.  He is convinced he can still strike it
big if only he can find some great talent right here in his own
neighborhood.</P>
<P>     Mari's daughter Laura (Jane Horrocks), living with Mari, has
almost given up the struggle to talk.  On the rare occasions when she
even bothers to speak it comes out at a squeaky tiny voice that has
earned her the nickname "Little Voice."  Laura has retreated from the
world dominated by her mother and into a world of daydreaming of her
dead father, now nearly elevated to the status of saint in her own
mind.  She listens over and over to his records of Marilyn Monroe,
Shirley Bassey, and especially Judy Garland.  Unknown to anyone while
Laura has almost no voice of her own she can borrow and even sing in
voices of Garland, Monroe, and Bassey in perfect voice impressions.</P>
<P>     One night when Laura is listening to the beloved Judy Garland
records and Ray is visiting Mari the power goes out.  Ray hears the
music stop, but strangely Judy Garland's voice continues to sing.
Suddenly Ray realizes that "Little Voice" may have real talent that he
can exploit to find some real success.  But can he get Laura to come
out of her shell?  And if she does come out, can Mari stand to see
someone else in the family getting attention?</P>
<P>     Jim Herman wrote the screenplay and directs a film based on the
play "The Rise and Fall of Little Voice" by Jim Cartwright.  Blethyn
and Caine each give performances so earthy one almost feels dirty just
watching them.  Each is totally self-absorbed.  Caine at least is aware
enough of how he is perceived that he can control himself.  Blethyn's
character is so self-absorbed that she does not even think of
appearances.  Horrocks is so victimized that she seems to be retreating
into autism.  Ewan McGregor is present as a young telephone installer
who is the first person since the death of Mari's husband who really
cares for Laura.  While reminding the viewer that there are still
normal and decent people in the world, he is a little too good to be
true.  It is never clear what he sees in Laura whose personality
qualifies her for the walking wounded.</P>
<P>     LITTLE VOICE is a downbeat look at English lower-middle class
standards.  The little neighborhood nightclub, Boo's, is seamy and
tawdry, even if there is little that we see that is explicit.  If
LITTLE VOICE really is a comedy, it is a dark one and one full of
people whom one is happy to be rid of at the end of its 100 minutes.
Much of the plotting of LITTLE VOICE is predictable, but the
performances are raw and realistic.  This is a side of England most of
us would rather do without.  I rate the film 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and
a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
