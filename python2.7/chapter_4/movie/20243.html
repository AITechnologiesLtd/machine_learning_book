<PRE>Kicking and Screaming (1995, R)</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Noah Baumbach</P>
<P>Story by Noah Baumbach and Oliver Berkman</P>
<P>Starring Josh Hamilton, Sam Gould, Catherine Kellner, Eric Stoltz, Olivia
d'Abo, Christopher Eigeman, and Parker Posey</P>
<P>As Reviewed by James Brundage (MovieKritic2000)</P>
<P> The question that one is immortally faced with as a critic is one of
personal interpretation.  You see a movie and it could be taken one of two
or more ways, often making the difference between a completely terrible film
and a great literary document.</P>
<P> In a more outlandish example we had 1997's Starship Troopers, a film that
could very well be viewed as an anti-fascist document and a representation
of Nazism.  However, with exuberantly high and seemingly useless body count,
Starship Troopers got a bad review from me on the account that it was your
standard-edition, boring-as-anything, action film.</P>
<P> There were people who took Starship Troopers in just this aspect, said that
it was a great film, and had a points so good that they could not be
logically countered.</P>
<P> Similarly, we are faced with the 1995 film Kicking and Screaming, which was
said to do for college what Dazed and Confused did for high school.  Yes,
it's undeniably funny.  Yes, its dialogue is so razor sharp that it cuts
through any obstacle and right into your funny bone.</P>
<P> But the problem is that, in the method it is done, one would expect a huge
point to come at the end of it.  Sadly, it doesn't.  It is one of those
films that does not end, only stops dead in its tracks.</P>
<P> Were this just any film with just any apparent point of illustration I
would decry the pointlessness of the movie simply stopping and leave it as
just a mildly entertaining movie.  But here's the rub: Kicking and Screaming
is an illustration of the directionless nature of post-college life.</P>
<P> As far as plot goes, that's just about it.  Grover (Josh Hamilton) is
trying to get over Jane (Olivia d'Abo), who went to Prague.  Max
(Christopher Eigeman) is trying to decide where to go in love and life after
a basically useless philosophy degree, but ends up just spending time
sleeping with freshmen.  Chet (Eric Stoltz) is trying to finally work his
way to a degree but is content to merely be a student.</P>
<P> The ending of Kicking and Screaming, which doesn't even have a fade out
(the credits just suddenly start), could be viewed as an illustration of the
lack of direction that the characters have.  However, it could also just be
viewed as a bad ending... an anticlimax.</P>
<P> The movie is able to pull its weight with an incredibly witty repartee
throughout the 96-minute running time, but is unable to go beyond the point
of just jokes.  Were this from the studio world, which is strictly a
business and is more for love of money than trying to do art, I could
understand and write the lack of a good ending on script doctors who are
only good with good lines, but instead this is what is called "an
Independent masterpiece."</P>
<P> To me this spells a slight bit of hypocrisy on behalf of the viewing
public.  If someone were willing to patron and love Kicking and Screaming on
the merit of repartee alone, than, by that argument, great one-liners would
make a great film.  On this same line of logic, a movie with great action
sequences is a great film.</P>
<P> You could subdivide and say that a movie with great dialogue makes a great
independent film, but that would be another cop-out.  Studio films may not
always have great dialogue, but neither do Independents.  In fact, the only
difference I have ever discerned between Studio films and Independents
(budget aside) is that most Independent films could not successfully be
pitched to studios.</P>
<P> Perhaps I am seeing this all wrong.  Perhaps pointlessness being the point
is something that has just flown over my head this time.  But, you know
what, if someone has to wonder if you have a point or are just out for cash,
you didn't do a good job.<HR>MovieKritic2000: Reviews for the Generation of a New Millenium
