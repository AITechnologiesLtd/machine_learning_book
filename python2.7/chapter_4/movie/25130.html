<P>     The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill went public ten days
before the release of ME, MYSELF & IRENE with a protest of the film's
flippant tone towards multiple personality disorders. They were offended,
which is not an uncommon reaction to a Farrelly Brothers movie. In fact,
it was probably a shrewd move on NAMI's part to beat the rush condemning
ME, MYSELF & IRENE. Operating strictly from memory, here's a list of the
groups that could conceivably find something in the film to be offended
by: African-Americans, little people, African-American little people,
lesbians, law enforcement officers, animal rights activists, albinos,
nursing mothers, users of feminine itch remedies ... and, of course,
advocates for the mentally ill.</P>
<P>     Farrelly Brothers movies -- including KINGPIN and THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MARY -- are tasteless, crude and, yes, occasionally offensive. 
They're also funny in the sort of I-can't-believe-I-actually-saw-that way
usually associated with vintage Mel Brooks, or the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker
team. There's nothing remotely ennobling about ME, MYSELF & IRENE, the
story of Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey), a Rhode Island state trooper
with a little problem. After his wife leaves him for another man, Charlie
is left with three growing boys and a need to avoid confrontations. His
repressed id eventually takes the form of an alter-ego named Hank that
appears whenever Charlie is enraged and unmedicated. That little problem
becomes a big problem when Hank is assigned to escort Irene Waters (Renee
Zellweger) back to New York on an arrest warrant, and soon discovers that
Irene is being targeted by a corrupt cop (Chris Cooper) who thinks she
knows something about his activities. Unfortunately, Charlie has forgotten
his medication, meaning Charlie and Hank both have the opportunity to grow
infatuated with Irene while they're on the run.</P>
<P>     Fans of THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY -- and I count myself quite
squarely among them -- may find IRENE a bit disappointing by comparison. 
Carrey and Zellweger aren't nearly the perfect comic odd couple Ben
Stiller and Cameron Diaz were, nor is Carrey the sort of comic performer
whose ordinary guy demeanor works to balance the Farrellys' warped
sensibilities. The story is an unnecessarily convoluted parade of
double-crossing characters involved in a dirty business deal the specific
nature of which I still can't explain. There are a few missed
opportunities, like ignoring genial narrator Rex Allen, Jr. for much of
the film. And like the Farrellys' previous films, it's easily 15 minutes
longer than it needs to be, padded with musical cues that only distract
from the real reason for watching a Farrelly Brothers movie: seeing what
gut-busting affront to good taste they'll come up with next.</P>
<P>     Mere words can't possibly do justice to those affronts. IRENE's
finest moments may not reach the epic heights of MARY's zipper or hair gel
scenes, but they come close. There's a ridiculously funny running gag
involving Charlie's three "sons" from his wife's affair, a trio of immense
black youths with Mensa minds and Richard Pryor mouths. Hank's uninhibited
rampage of vengeance upon his first emergence gets more outrageous by the
moment. Then there's a morning visit to the lavatory that turns into a
battle between Charlie and his own excretory equipment. Sometimes it seems
that it's a long time between laughs in a Farrelly Brothers movie, but
maybe that's a good thing. Often, you still haven't recovered from the
last one five minutes ago by the time the next one rolls around.</P>
<P>     I'm not about to delve into whether or not NAMI was "right" in
criticizing IRENE for its approach to multiple personality disorder,
including repeatedly using "schizo" as a synonym. I do know that ME,
MYSELF & IRENE strikes me as a wildly comic spin on THE INCREDIBLE HULK
more than anything else, with Carrey's contorted transformations a special
effect all by themselves. That's only part of the amazingly adept physical
comedy Carrey pulls off, battling with his own body like Steve Martin in
ALL OF ME ... or, come to think of it, like Carrey himself in LIAR LIAR. 
This time, however, he doesn't have to fight against insipid moralizing. 
ME, MYSELF & IRENE may be uneven and peculiarly violent in its resolution,
but it's pure in its refusal to sentimentalize anything. Everything is
profane and nothing sacred in the Farrelly universe. Maybe that is worth
protesting. Or maybe, when you're laughing so hard that you forget to be
offended, it's worth applauding.</P>
