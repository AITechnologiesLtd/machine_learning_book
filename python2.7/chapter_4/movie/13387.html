<PRE>Nadine (1987)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 68</PRE>
<P>"Nadine" is a surprisingly original and entertaining film.
It is not ambitious, and makes no pretense of greatness.
It is intended as a simple comedy and action picture, but
is a little more than that.  The depiction of Austin, Texas
of 1954 is credible, and the lead actors and their characters
give winning performances.  The action sequences even have
some suspense.</P>
<P>Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger are married, but separated.
Bridges merely needs Basinger's signature to finalize the
divorce, so he can marry his new girlfriend.  Bridges and
Basinger really still do love each other, but have been
too busy squabbling to notice.  (The producer of "Twister"
must have seen this movie).</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Basinger is trying to recover nude pictures from
a slimy photographer.  Her photos are mixed with those depicting
a proposed highway's layout.  The leads to Basinger and
Bridges becoming involved in murder, conspiracy to commit
land fraud, and other lesser crimes.  Worse yet, a group
of ruthless but amusing baddies led by Rip Torn is also
after the highway photos.</P>
<P>There were several things about the film that I liked.
Bridges true love is not for Nadine or new fiancee Glenne
Headly, but for a pathetic nightclub called "The Blue Bonnet",
which has few customers but many unpaid bills.  In one
scene, Bridges makes an escape from the baddies by unleashing
rattlesnakes, perhaps an original concept.  In another
scene, Basinger and Bridges are forced to crawl across
a splintering ladder spanning two high buildings.</P>
<P>Jeff Bridges has my favorite line of the film, "I'll bet
that she's got a husband who's even dumber than she is."
He is unaware that the woman being referred to is his own
wife!</P>
<P>Robert Benton directed and wrote the screenplay.  While
not a household name, he has many good films on his resume,
including "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Kramer vs. Kramer".</P>
