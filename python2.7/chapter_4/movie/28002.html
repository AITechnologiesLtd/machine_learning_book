<PRE>                   THE TASTE OF OTHERS (Le goût des autres)
                         A film review by Julia Levin
                         Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>In The Taste of Others, a wealthy suburban businessman named Castella
gets infatuated with a theatrical actress and becomes a frequent visitor
of her bohemian circle of friends.  The premise might not be very
original but the delicious twist of the story is that it is not so much
about Castella's pursuit as it is about how different social strata are
formed and how they intersect with one another.</P>
<P>Castella (Jean-Pierre Bacri) and his wife have to attend a local stage
production of Bérénice, in which their daughter plays a small part. 
They don't care for the theatre and can't understand the verse, but, to
Castella's own surprise, he finds himself unusually moved by a leading
actress Clara.  The charming point here is that Clara isn't a young
aspiring theatrical diva but an aging, harried, and often unemployed
actress from a small provincial theatre.  Castella, however, doesn't see
her that way: For him, she brings into his dispassionate routine the
whiff of a free-spirited life including cozy, drunken late-night talks
and vibrant gallery gatherings.  Through happenstance, Castella's new
business arrangement requires him to learn English, and Clara (Anne
Alvaro) becomes his teacher.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that Clara's friends are contemptuous of Castella for
his ignorance, plebian tastes, and crass jokes, the businessman shows up
at every reception or theatrical premiere.  His is not a vicious fellow,
not by any stretch, and his homophobic remarks are devoid of malice --
he is simply too unimaginative to go beyond his usual milieu -- and as
long as he is dancing on his toes, Clara is ferociously dismissive of
his courtship.  The film elegantly hints, however, at the fact that even
a small reversal of fortune can bring up a philistine in the most
uncompromising of artists.</P>
<P>The film doesn't shock the viewer in any way, but it is full of
delightful, witty, and keen observations on human behavior, the social
fiber of people's close circles, and those quiet, under-the-breath
moments that capture the essence of people's tastes and choices.  It
also makes a curious observation of the mechanism that brings two people
together and how impossible it is to explain the complexity of
attraction between seemingly incongruent people.</P>
<P>Castella's wife, for example, with the ironic name Angelique (Christiane
Millet), is an easily recognizable type of a rich bored housewife.  An
interior designer by profession, Angelique decorates her house to make
it look like a flower shop, and she herself is always decked out in
unbearably motley dresses.  She is the film's emotional freak, oblivious
to anything but her rabid little dog and a philosophy of the moral
superiority of animals over humans.</P>
<P>The cast's regular bartender Manie (Agnes Jaoui, who also directed the
film) is sleeping with both Castella's bodyguard Moreno (Gerard Lanvin)
and the chauffeur Deschamps (Alain Chabat).  She is accepted among the
artists, for she is uncompromisingly independent and fearless, while
Castella gets laughed at in his face.  An interesting development takes
place when Manie and Moreno discover that they perhaps stumble into a
serious relationship: Moreno's morality doesn't allow him to accept
Manie's selling drugs to supplement her income but does allow for his
own brainless, painfully boring job.</P>
<P>Agnes Jaoui's directorial debut is shot in a plain, well-paced style:
Nothing is rushed or crumpled and, besides following the story, there
are always snippets of other people's life as background, helping you
remember the larger tapestry of life.  Also, the filmmaker uses the
charming device of starting a scene in one place and, nonchalantly,
ending it in another, giving the story a sense of both completeness and
fragmentation at the same time.</P>
<P>The Taste of Others doesn't reach into the deeply-rooted causes of why
people end up having one circle of friends and not another.  It does
show, however, that we tend to be reluctant to accept others into our
established boundaries.  This 112-minute long film has a light yet
precious tinge of the great British writer William Somerset Maugham's
wit and irony, but without his incisive and cynical attitude toward
life.</P>
