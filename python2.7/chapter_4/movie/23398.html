<P>To be perfectly honest (as I usually am), I was not exactly looking forward to
a film about the musical operetta kings Gilbert and Sullivan. Why you might
ask? Because I am not a big fan of musicals in general, and musicals by any
composer, even Stephen Sondheim, are not exactly my cup of tea. On the other
hand, excluding my naivete for a moment, I was deeply enthralled by Mike
Leigh's new film "Topsy-Turvy." This is a wonderfully illuminating look at the
theatre and the backstage lives of the actors involved in making a musical -
the pains, the tears, the heartbreak, the confusion, the need to express
oneself creatively and personally, etc. </P>
<P>The film wisely spends more than an hour detailing the lives of Gilbert and
Sullivan, and the status of their new musical, "Princess Ida," which received
mixed reviews and proclaimed Gilbert as the "king of Topsy-Turvydom." The
highly repressed and laconic librettist William Schwenck Gilbert (Jim
Broadbent) seems to have no idea how to react to such news except that the show
must go on. While writing his music, Gilbert mostly ignores his faithful wife,
his seemingly senile father, and his crotchety bedridden mother.</P>
<P>The sickly, charming, luxurious Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) has no
intention of continuing his collaboration with Gilbert if they persist
producing such lightly frolicking musicals dealing with magic potions. He wants
to do more personal work. This almost sounds like the story of those 70's
Hollywood film directors trying to survive in the soulless 90's of commerce and
box-office. One day, however, Gilbert is inspired to write "The Mikado," and
thus the collaboration with Sullivan is renewed. The musical looks like it
might be a disaster considering that it consists of white British actors
playing Japanese denizens wearing silk robes - one of the actors complains
about the indecency of removing their corsets. How would an audience respond to
such a musical? And is disaster imminent when Gilbert consults real Japanese
women to see how they really behave and act?</P>
<P>The unerring delight in "Topsy-Turvy" is in witnessing how the production of
such a comical musical takes shape, and in seeing how the people involved are
affected by it with their own little vignettes taking place. We have the
comical actor (Martin Savage) with a need for morphine; the lead soprano
(Shirley Henderson) who has fits of drinking and is a single mother; and most
importantly, the portly-shaped actor playing the lead role, Richard Temple as
the Mikado (Timothy Spall, a Leigh regular), who is saddened that Gilbert cut
his leading musical number. And of course, we get a view of Gilbert and
Sullivan's complicated lives, including Gilbert's wife's awareness that her
husband is inattentive to her needs in a heartrending scene. </P>
<P>"Topsy-Turvy" explores every single aspect of theatre you can imagine. There is
the costuming, appropriate line readings at rehearsals, accounting practices,
box-office revenues, heartaches and headaches over casting, makeup sessions
where actors talk about one another, jealousies, etc. Next to Kenneth Branagh's
delectable "A Midwinter's Tale," this is as good as it gets when it comes to
the world of theatre. </P>
<P>My favorite scenes involve rehearsal and actual musical numbers. I love the
extended scene where Gilbert enunciates every single syllable that is erred
during rehearsal down to the most minute detail - the scene is long but
essential in capturing the nightmare of minutiae and detail in rehearsals. I
also love the musical numbers from "The Mikado" which reverberate with momentum
and high energy - it gives you the feeling that you are near the stage at the
Savoy Theatre watching a live performance. </P>
<P>"Topsy-Turvy" ranks with Mike Leigh's best work, including the near-brilliant
"Secrets and Lies." This film is one to admire for many generations, showing
the pains and excesses one must endure to create theatre and the rich rewards
one reaps from all the hard work. When the lights go down, the magic begins as
the audience is transported into another world. The process by which this
happens is at the heart of "Topsy-Turvy."                                      </P>
