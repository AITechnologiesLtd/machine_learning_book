<P>
 It would be pointless for me not to admit at the outset that I have
always held great esteem for Spike Lee and his films. And just in case
I have left anyone in doubt, that means I find it extremely difficult
to provide objective evaluation in this regard. It is some thing I
have proven incapable of time and again, despite good advice on this
subject from Christian Metz.  Nonetheless I am going to try to make a
convincing and unbiased case for He Got Game as one of the best films
of the year. Lee is one fo the more prolific filmmaker's working today
having released virtually a film a year since his first feature.  This
is neither good nor bad, although it might be an indication of a type
of inferiority complex Lee has alluded to regarding the facility white
director's have in marshalling finacing. His trajectory over the years
has had peaks (Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues) and valleys
(Clockers). I am still convinced that keeping faith after being denied
accolades for Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X at various venues (the
two films he considers to be his best) was not an easy task; something
that clearly showed in his filmmaking post-Malcolm X. With He Got
Game, however, Lee truly impresses as he once did.</P>
<P>    It has been implied that an important reference point for He Got
Game is Hoop Dreams. This comparison seems to miss the point. Lee's
film transcends both the situation as well as the shortcomings of the
latter film. (These are well treated in Cineaste Vol.  XXI, No.3) He
Got Game introduces viewers to Jesus Shuttlesworth, the number one
highschool basketball prospect. The film chronicles the decisions he
faces and the contradictions and hypocrisies people begin to contrive
in view of his potentially lucrative situation. The film is an essay
on the dignity and poise needed to go through circumstances such as
the ones Jesus is in. It is clearly not to relate in a realistic or
naturalistic way the pressures Jesus is under, or the cruelty of the
recruiting system. Nor is it as mundane a venture as simply
'fictionalizing Hoop Dreams'. Lee makes this clear from the opening
frames shot in slow motion, alluding to basketball as a heroic almost
spiritual experience. His intentions are reinforced by the scrrenplay
wahich proposes one of the most ludicrous setups in recent
memory. Clearly this is not a setting or situation that is meant to be
taken literally but rather a grotesque carricature designed to provoke
an interrogation by the viewer. For those still unconvinced, consider
the scenes in which Lee overtly undermines the narrative either
through his patented direct address scenes or the roll call
sequence. These scenes reaffirm an intention not to adress the
spectator through the narrative itself but through what this
hyperbolic scenario alludes to.</P>
<P>    The photography colludes perfectly to complement this
intention. Two things are made very clear. the first is that Lee has
gotten very comfortable shooting commercials, the second is that he
has somehow also maitianed his poise as a craftsman. The style of the
basketball scenes with multispeed photography and luminescent colours
presents the TV commercial aesthetic as a parodic device. The players
are a marketing tool before the first contract is even signed or the
first TV camera ever arrives. In shooting the basket ball scenes this
way the associations between what is happening on the court, in the
players minds (projecting themselves as sports celebrities) and in the
viewers' minds is collapsed. There is something almost sinister in
this depiction in marked contrast to those that graced the opening
titles.  Lee mixes styles to deliver such effects several times. The
light on the Milla Jovovich character is rarely motivated and almost
angelic despite some clear shortcomings of the character. The
high-contrast look to the team introduction sequence is yet another
example. There is nothing transparent or understated about the
camerawork, just as there is nothing naturalistic or 'real' about the
screenplay. It is a very apt marriage of style and content to make the
point that it is beneath the situations or events that the real
discussion is happening in this film. It is a very eleagant way to
give the material some weight; a difficult task in films that center
on sports.</P>
<P>    In fact much more than a 'sports film', He Got Game is truly
tragic.  The scenes between Jesus and his Sister, or The Sister and
the Father, ring with a certain intensity that I am not ashamed to
admit had me fighting back tears. This tragedy is woven into the very
texture of the film: In spite of any good fortune that may befall
Jesus Shuttlesworth, the cost at which it has come is truly horrific.
