<PRE>HEARTS IN ATLANTIS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is a sweet, touching and rather usual film that is based on a
Stephen King novel.  No, it's not a horror movie.  But, what is it exactly?  As
the story evolves with quiet power, it is never clear where it is going or what
kind of movie it will become.  A low-key foreboding serves more as part of the
ambiance than as a hint of the future.  If the movie, directed by Scott Hicks
(SHINE) and written by William Goldman (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID),
must be characterized, it might be as STAND BY ME 2.</P>
<P>The well cast film is a character study that revolves around relationships.  The
central character, 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), is a fatherless
kid with a self-centered mother (Hope Davis), who squanders the family's meager
income on her fancy wardrobe.  One day in the early 1960s, his life is
transformed by a boarder, Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), who comes to live in
the apartment above them.  A generous and mysterious man, Ted becomes a father
figure for Bobby.  Something of a scholar, Ted loves quoting famous figures and
sharing his own quotable thoughts with Bobby and his friends.  The most
prophetic of these is, "Sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such
happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have
been.  Then we grow up, and our hearts are broken in two."</P>
<P>Bobby is at a key transitional moment in his life.  His view of the opposite sex
is moving from the "yuck" phase to the time when he would love to kiss a girl
but would never admit it.  Luckily for him, one of his best pals, Carol, just
happens to be female.  Young love has rarely been shot with more honesty and
delicacy.  The late Piotr Sobocinski's cinematography of Bobby and Carol at a
local carnival park is sheer magic.  Sobocinski, a second-generation
cinematographer, is best known for his Oscar nominated work on Krzysztof
Kieslowski's RED.</P>
<P>The scene-stealer in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS is Mika Boorem, who plays Carol.  It is
the sort of performance that will have you scratching your head wondering where
you have seen her before.  The answer is that she was in THE PATRIOT and both
she and Yelchin were in ALONG CAME A SPIDER.  The camera loves her, and she
delivers a dead-on performance.  The more important question is whether
producers will recognize her potential and give her the parts she deserves so
that she becomes the next Meg Ryan and not the next Molly Ringwald. </P>
<P>HEARTS IN ATLANTIS runs 1:41.  It is rated PG-13 for "violence and thematic
elements," and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, September 28, 2001. 
In the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.</P>
