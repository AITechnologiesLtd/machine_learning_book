<PRE>                                  MALLRATS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     With a name like MALLRATS what kind of a dumb movie would you
expect?  That's what I thought, too, until I noted it was written and
directed by Kevin Smith who did the delightfully offbeat CLERKS, and
that while CLERKS was made on that proverbial shoestring, this one had
some money to back it.  It was worth every cent.</P>
<P>     Like the wacky CLERKS, MALLRATS is way out.  It is also full of
surprises that are as raunchy, to use a mild term, as anything you have
ever seen.  Somehow, none of it can be characterized as "porno."    As
an example, one of the young men puts his own feces on his hand, talks
his girlfriend's father (Michael Rooker) into eating it by telling him
its his favorite chocolate-covered cookie, and then shaking hands with
him so that the remainder will stink for days on his hand.   While one
weird occurrence follows another at a rapid pace, the feces one is the
most outrageous (but among the most hilarious). Director Kevin wanted
to go all out and he did.</P>
<P>     The film takes place in a mall where 2 young men who have lost
their girlfriends (little wonder) spend the entire movie trying to win
them back.  On the way they visit a nude psychic (from the waist up)
who, to their surprise, has three nipples.  And on and on as the action
becomes fast and furious but remaining funny.</P>
<P>     Smith reprises his role of Silent Bob (in Clerks).  Others in the
cast are Brandi (Claire Forlani), Ivannah, the psychic (Priscilla
Barnes), a host (Art James) at a game show at the mall, Brian
O'Halloran (who was Dante in CLERKS) as well as Rene (Shannen Doherty)
among others.</P>
<P>     Teenagers will howl with delight but adults, too, should find it
very entertaining and ... different.  Leave the little ones at home.</P>
