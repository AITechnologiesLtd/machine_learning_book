McKean (Principal Potter), Molly Ringwald (Miss Banks), Vivica A. Fox 
(Miss Gold). A Dimension Films release. 93 minutes.PG-13</P>
<P>Kevin Williamson's first feature as director is a fizzle. He has been 
one of the new,  hot  Hollywood screenwriters since 1996, beginning 
with Scream (and later with Scream 2). His popular but puerile I Know 
What You Did Last Summer (1997) deserves what a critic (in, I think, 
Time) wrote about  the 1965 I Saw What You Did. His full review : " 
And I wish to hell I hadn't."</P>
<P>In 1998 Williamson  also created the TV series "Dawson's Creek,  was 
an uncredited writer for Halloween H20, and  scripted The Faculty. 
According to an AP story  "much of his work is based on things that 
really happened to him." In particular, a high school teacher 
described as a true monster crushed all his hopes for becoming a 
writer. The discouragement was repeated in a college writing class. 
Poor Kevin! But at least and at last  his deep traumas found their 
way into his eventual success as a writer, and certainly in his 
creation of the revenge movie Teaching Mrs. Tingle which centers on 
a small town school's history teacher from Hell.</P>
<P>American high school pictures are a genre with hundreds of entries, 
especially following the success of the appealing Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High (1982). Most of them try to be amusing and depict 
students doing anything except studying and learning.  In the light 
as well as in the few "serious" pictures the teachers are the victims 
of their classes. The grandpa of such works may be the famous The 
Blackboard Jungle (1955) whose screening at the Cannes Festival 
brought out protests by Americans because "of the bad name it gave 
U.S. schools."</P>
<P>Teaching Mrs. Tingle turns the tables on most high-school films, as 
Mrs.T., a martinet and a tyrant, is the persecutor of the kids.</P>
<P>The title was originally Killing Mrs. Tingle, but given the 
increasing rash of real-life school killings, it was changed. There 
may be a loss of audience among some amateurs of teacher-murder, but 
since there are no corpses in the film, "Teaching" is a better title 
and has the benefit of catchy alliteration. Yet even then, the name 
Tingle sends the wrong message. It would have been fine if it evoked 
someone who does things to you, such as appeal or titillation.</P>
<P>On the other hand, could this be an attempt at irony, which is 
something that Mrs. T  likes to define, and to dispense nastily and 
sarcastically to all: students, staff, colleagues, administrators 
--and most likely to grocery clerks, waiters, salespeople and 
everybody else. Worse yet, she's a master of put-downs which 
inevitably make all wilt in her presence and all hate her.  She even 
uses her unpleasantness to get her wishes via innuendoes, as when she 
blackmails the principal whose secret (he's in Alcoholics Anonymous) 
she knows.</P>
<P>The story. Graduating Leigh Ann Watson (Katie Holmes) is the top 
candidate for valedictorian. All she needs is another A, which will 
get her a college scholarship - indispensable, since her mother (a 
single) does not have the means to pay tuition.</P>
<P>The girl slaves over a first-rate project for her history class which 
she presents to Mrs.Tingle. Probably jealous of Leigh's looks and 
promising future, and, as later revealed,  frustrated by her own life 
(she was herself a student in that school and had been unable to 
leave that small town), Mrs T deprecates the project and gives Leigh 
a grade of C.</P>
<P>Desperate Leigh and her best friend Marisa (a lively actress 
wannabe), run into classmate Barry, a good-looking slacker on whom 
Marisa has a crush. He has just gotten an illegal copy of the history 
final.  Horrified, Leigh takes it away from him, puts it in her bag. 
In one of the first artificial developments of the movie, Mrs. T 
walks in, somehow spots the exam, and guarantees expulsion for Leigh.</P>
<P>The youngsters, trying vainly to explain Leigh's innocence, have to 
resort to a visit to Mrs. T's home but the teacher, considering them 
as invaders, throws them out.</P>
<P>And here begin a dumb, dull, unreal chain of events that do not 
deserve analysis. Fake semi-climaxes follow one another. The status 
of the kids goes from bad to worse after they tie Mrs. T to her bed. 
For three (I believe, but who cares?) days, during which Mrs. T gets 
fed but never goes to the bathroom. Involved, among other artifacts 
and events are a crossbow (sic), the loss of Leigh's presumed 
virginity, and a visit by  Mrs. T's secret lover, or at least sex 
partner. He goes by the nickname Spanky, which gives you a clue about 
the couple's activities. The man is an awfully  unlikely a choice. I 
will not reveal who plays him except that it 's a waste of an actor 
who has been marvelous on cable TV.</P>
<P>The movie is a waste of the audience's time and of the performers' 
abilities, including Molly Ringwald. She has been relegated to a 
tiny, innocuous part as office help and substitute teacher. Michael 
McKean, that superbly versatile actor of film (Coneheads, etc., etc.) 
and TV (Brian Benben's Aussie boss in HBO's Dream On) has a mere 
cameo, which cries out for expansion. Otherwise, the movie belongs 
entirely to Ms Mirren.</P>
<P>England's  Helen Mirren has been on much TV and many films for 
decades. She is a great actress who, in the USA at least, in spite of 
dozens of movies in which she held main or supporting roles, is far 
from a household name. The reasons? She is a mature woman and not the 
regulation gorgeous chick. Not all of her films have been displayed, 
and if so, insufficiently. Many of the best were specialty  "art" 
items: The Long Good Friday,  Cal, Pascali's Island, The Cook The 
Thief His Wife and her Lover, Some Mother's Son, and others.  She 
eventually acquired some name recognition through  The Madness of 
King George and the several Prime Suspect TV series (as Detective, 
then Superintendent Jane Tennison)</P>
<P>Her Mrs. Tingle showcases her talent. Not only as a demonic teacher, 
but as a diabolical captive who manipulates her captors with speech 
--while tied to her bed. Proud, coaxing, menacing, scheming, 
attempting to disunite the youngsters, and eventually pathetic, she 
does not merely steal the show, she IS the show. But even  Ms Mirren 
cannot save this concoction where  contrived drama and would-be humor 
co-exist without ever hitting their marks.</P>
