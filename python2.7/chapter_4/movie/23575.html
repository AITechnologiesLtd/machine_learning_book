<P>   Starting with the Greeks ("Agamemnon," "Medea,"
"Antigone") and continuing with the Elizabethans ("Hamlet,"
"Othello") on up, portrayals of family dysfunction have been
just about the most popular subject for stage and later movie
productions.  Recent American movies on the subject tend to
be broadly satiric and nasty ("Happiness," "American
Beauty,") or slick comic-then-tragic takes ("The Next Best
Thing").  If you're used to Hollywood versions of domestic
dilemmas and difficulties, you're like to be less than absorbed
by some of the denser, more subtle selections on the subject. 
Look at "Such a Long Journey," for example, directed by the
Iceland-born Sturla Gunnarsson who has lived much of his
life in Canada.  Gunnarsson, an unknown name in the U.S.
except among cinephiles, is no stranger to awards, having
garnered the Prix Ville de Cannes in 1991 for "Diplomatic
Immunity" and for the current film he earned favorable
reviews after its showing at the Toronto Film Festival, where
the director now lives.  </P>
<P>   Gunnarsson has guts to undertake a project of these
dimensions.  Rohinton Mistry's book is freighted with plots
and subplots and descriptive material whose essence had to
be extracted by scripter Sooni Taraporevala--who is, like the
characters he describes, a Parsi.  What comes across in the
relatively brief 110 minutes of screen time is certainly not the
full textual content of the luxuriant novel but enough of each
major aspects to make an imprint on the audience.  Those
considerations include a survey, however light, of the Parsi
community of Bombay (these are the people who have
descended from Persians who, when conquered by Arabs
centuries ago, fled to India where they became favored by
the British government and prospered in business). For more
personal meditations we hone in on one Parsi family rolling in
rupees during the British administration  which somehow lost
its fortune after independence, sending the head of family
into a middle-class bank job in Bombay.</P>
<P>   The film is blessed with the acting of perhaps India's
number one performer, Roshan Seth ("Gandhi," "Passage to
India," "My Beautiful Landrette," "Mississippi") in the role of
Gustad Noble, a perfectly decent, quiet family man whose
world suddenly begins to go to pieces in 1971.  During that
year, rebellions were taking place in East Pakistan, struggles
which were to lead to the formation of the independent state
of Bangladesh on India's northeast, a separation from
Pakistan which was financed in part by the Indian
government and private sources in India.  </P>
<P>   Using a few discreet flashbacks, Gunnarsson shows
Gustad Noble during his happy childhood days in lavish
quarters, and later, as an adult, as a man who is asked by
his estranged friend Jimmy Bilimoria (Naseeruddin Shah) to
be a courier of money to be used to help finance the Bengal
uprising.  While Noble appears apolitical, he is bound by
loyalty to embark on a dangerous mission, employing the
help of his friend and co-worker Dinshawji (Sam Dastor) and
the guidance of Ghulam (Om Puri), who acts a liaison
between Jimmy and Gustad.  When it rains it pours: that very
year, poor Mr. Noble is faced by a rebellion in his own
household, as his son, Sohrab (Vrajesh Hirjee), refuses to go
to a prestigious technical school despite his father's
admonitions and his small daughter, Roshan (Shazneed
Damania) comes down with malaria.</P>
<P>   During frequent breaks from the domestic tumult,
Gunnarsson cuts to the teeming streets of Bombay where his
audience witnesses the shabby condition of the shops, the
severely overcrowded local trains, and a minor revolution
within his own neighborhood as municipal authorities are
determined to tear down a wall filled with religious paintings
to widen the road.  As though these quandaries were not
enough, Gustad's surrogate son, the retarded Tehmul
(Kurush Deboo), has observed Gustad handling large sums
of illegally-gained money and cannot be trusted to keep his
observations a secret.</P>
<P>   India and China hold 40% of the entire world's population
with India in second place.  From the limited sights of the
streets of Bombay, we can feel the pressures of such
overwhelming growth and sense how just about any
annoyance from the arrogance of municipal authorities to the
machinations of central government can lead to widespread
unrest.  By zeroing in on just one group of characters of
India's huge multitudes, Gunnarsson afford us a look writ
small of the turbulence of the Asian subcontinent, with its
street people, its boulevard artists, the burdens felt even by
those lucky enough to hold middle-class jobs, and layer upon
layer of troubles almost without end.  Given the superb acting
talents of Mr. Seth and the subtle, patient direction of Mr.
Gunnarsson, "Such a Long Journey" turns out a trip worth
taking, its audience safely lolling in comfortable theater seats
observing the pollution, the corruption, the degradations, the
humiliations, and even the momentary joys of family life in
Bombay.</P>
