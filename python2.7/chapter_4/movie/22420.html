<P>It's phenomenal how much F/X work has been dedicated to making the title
character of `Stuart Little' a realistic screen presence. Stuart, an
orphaned mouse with an entire wardrobe of CGI clothing, is so convincing
as a walking, talking entity that we tend to forget he's merely an
elaborate special effect. `Stuart Little' is one for the kids, but at a
time like Christmas, it will easily function as agreeable entertainment
for the entire family.</P>
<P>Heading into the Christmas holidays, there are two family features
opening at your local cinema: this live action adaptation of E.B.
White's cherished children's novel, and the Robin Williams android
comedy `Bicentennial Man'. While `Bicentennial Man' offers some thought,
this charming tale has more of the proper ingredients to serve as a
crowd-pleaser for all ages. With director Rob Minkoff (`The Lion King')
behind the wheel, `Stuart Little' is chock-full of talking rodents and
frantic felines, all weaving their way through cute situations that the
kids will be enthralled by. But there is fun for the adult group, too,
in spotting the voice talents of various Hollywood stars. Listen for
Nathan Lane, Steve Zahn, Chazz Palminteri, Jennifer Tilly, and Michael
J. Fox as the little man himself.</P>
<P>Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) have decided to
adopt a younger child into their family. The sight of the undisciplined
hooligans running around and screaming at the orphanage, however, brings
them to an alternate decision: they will adopt a mouse instead. Stuart
is excited to become part of the Little family, but their son George
(Johathan Lipnicki) has trouble accepting a mouse as a younger brother.
This problem is fairly understandable. Meanwhile, Stuart must ward off
the vile and villainous kitty Snowbell (voice of Nathan Lane), who seems
intent on getting rid of the little fella before the next family photo.
For the most part, the human actors play second fiddle to the animal
characters. But I found this move acceptable, particularly given the
performance of Lane, who is wonderfully vibrant as the demure but
dastardly Snowbell.</P>
<P>Michael J. Fox is perfect for the bashful suitings of Stuart, deriving
certain emotions out of the character to a degree that few other actors
could match. The special effects work for the talking cats (which
resembles the F/X from `Babe') is seamless and enjoyable, but the
spotlight here is definitely on the awe-inspiring creation of Stuart
Little himself. The wonderful visual effects go behind the call of duty
with convincing the audience that Stuart is actually just a miniature
actor. The blending of computer animation and live action is
consistently excellent, particularly in a miraculous boat race sequence
that is executed in perfect perspective. And Stuart has his own little
car, of course. Like I say, this is one for the kids.</P>
<P>Not that adults can't laugh along too. The screenplay is, oddly enough,
co-written none other than M. Night Shyamalan - the brilliant mind
behind the huge blockbuster hit `The Sixth Sense'. The story Stuart is
pitted into is nothing special, but there are some clever nuggets of
humor for the parental units as well. I hate to admit it, but I have
never read the novel `Stuart Little', despite it's obvious favor among
the Grade 2 crowd. I know, shame on me. I can see the possibility of
certain fans of the book being disappointed with the film, which
contains a glowing heart but really never elevates itself past the
elementary level of cute talking animals. Nonetheless, kids of all ages
are bound to be taken by the charming story of `Stuart Little', and it's
harmless nature is almost guaranteed to please adults as well.</P>
<P>And that is why I commend this family outing. There is nothing
spectacular about the way it is structured, but `Stuart Little' is
succeeds on the level of innocent entertainment. It's the cream of the
Holiday crop, with a title character who is easily the most welcome
special effect of the entire year.</P>
