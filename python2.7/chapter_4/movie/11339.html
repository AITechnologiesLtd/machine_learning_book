<PRE>SWEPT FROM THE SEA
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Beeban Kidron directs this romantic epic based on Joseph Conrad's short
story, Amy Foster.  But while the film captures the scenery and scope
necessary for an epic romance, it falls short with a stale plot and a
flat romance.</P>
<P>Vincent Perez stars as Yanko, a Ukranian on an emigrant ship to
America.  He is washed overboard during a severe storm, and washes
ashore on the English countryside.  With his ragged appearance and
unknown tongue, the locals take him for a madman.  He soon finds himself
working for a local property owner, Mr. Swaffer (Joss Ackland), who
treats him little better than a slave.</P>
<P>Only two people sense the humanity inside Yanko.  The first is Amy
Foster (Rachel Weisz), a quiet woman, born to a scandalous marriage, who
is as much of an outcast in the community as Yanko.  Amy is unafraid of
the "mad" stranger, and treats him with kindness and love. The second is
James Kennedy (Ian McKellen), the town's doctor, who is as attracted to
the man as Amy, and sets out to teach the stranger English.</P>
<P>The tale is told in flashback by Kennedy to Swaffer's daughter (Kathy
Bates). However, both of them play integral parts in the tale.  It seems
odd that Miss Swaffer pretends as if she doesn't know the details and
that Kennedy would have to explain so much to her.</P>
<P>With its broad themes of ostracism and acceptance, Swept From the Sea
paints the world in black and white.  The film is at its best in its
earliest scenes, such as Yanko's departure for America, or the English
town's handling of a tragedy.  At these times, there are hints of
shading...we don't quite know where the film will take us, but we're
looking forward to the ride.  Then, once all its characters are in
place, the film settles down into a rut, with no surprises and no
excitement.</P>
<P>In another key problem with the film, the lovers, Amy and Yanko, lack
definition. A quiet woman, Amy says very little, and does little more.
Rachel Weisz never manages to convey any sense of Amy's inner life, and
she remains dead to us and the world. Yanko fares a little better.  At
least Vincent Perez gives him a spark of passion. However, when the two
are together, that spark does not ignite.</P>
<P>Luckily, there's a very strong supporting cast.  Ackland, McKellen and
Bates may be playing nearly featureless characters, but they utilize
their crafts to enliven the hollow shells and give them humanity.  Ian
McKellen in particular has a difficult job.  The film hits you over the
head with his character's subtle leanings, but McKellen manages to give
Dr. Kennedy an air of dignity underneath it all.</P>
<P>When the supporting cast isn't onscreen, at least there are some
beautiful vistas of the English countryside to occupy your attention, so
you're never quite bored.  Yet, when going to see an epic romance, you
usually expect a little more romance than what is delivered.</P>
