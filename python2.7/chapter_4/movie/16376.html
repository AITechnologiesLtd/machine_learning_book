<PRE>
Life is Beautiful (1998) 4 stars out of 4</PRE>
<P> Roberto Benigni is a clown in the tradition of Chaplin and Keaton.</P>
<P> This Italian film star, best known in the United States for the poorly
received Son of the Pink Panther, has done the near impossible by creating
a comic fable about the Holocaust.</P>
<P> But Benigni's Life Is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella) is not so much a story
of the Holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a
backdrop to tell a story of familial love, devotion and sacrifice.</P>
<P> The movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with Benigni's Guido
arriving in the small Tuscan town of Arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of
owning a bookstore.</P>
<P> Like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him, most notably the
almost-forgotten  Harry Langdon,  Benigni's Guido has a childlike
innocence. He ignores the growing anti-Semitism of the Fascist government.</P>
<P> Instead, Guido ardently falls in love and persues Dora, a local school
teacher who already is engaged to a local Fascist official.</P>
<P> In Benigni's tightly wound script this is the same Fascist official with
whom Guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter.</P>
<PRE> Guido wins Dora. They marry.</PRE>
<P> Fast forward about five years. Guido, Dora, and their 5-year-old son,
Giosue´ (Giorgio Cantarini)  are a happy family. Guido has finally
fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore.</P>
<P> But racial and anti-Semitic tensions are on the rise in Italy, and Guido
has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities.</P>
<P> The task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a
concentration camp. Here, Guido must use all his skill and imagination not
only to shield his son, but to keep him from being exterminated.</P>
<P> It is at this juncture in Life Is Beautiful may tend to offend those whom
the Holocaust has touched. For the scenes in the concentration camp lack
the horror, the pain, the unimaginable suffering of a Schindler's List.</P>
<P> True, many Italian Jews were not deported until the war was nearly over,
and most were not sent to the death camps, but to work camps where they
were used as slave labor.</P>
<P> Unlike Steven Spielberg, Benigni is not out to tell the story of the
Holocaust. His story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to
protect a child.</P>
<P> For Guido, to save his son, transforms the entire experience into an
elaborate game. Giosue´ must follow the rules without question to amass
1,000 points. The winner takes home a tank.</P>
<P> Therefore, Guido tells him, he must remain hidden in the barracks. He
cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him.</P>
<P> Guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a German guard barks
the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates. Guido, lying that he
understands German and can translate for his fellow prisoners, instead lays
down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive.</P>
<P> Throughout their imprisonment, Guido's quick thinking continually keeps
his son from harm's way.</P>
<P> Ultimately, the allies rescue the camp. In a poignant scene, Giosue´ comes
out of hiding just as an American tank rolls into the compound. The boy
goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight, thinking he has won the game.</P>
<P> The price for his victory is most high.</P>
<P>Benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to
prove that even in hell, a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the
darkness.</P>
<P> Life Is Beautiful is a fantasy, a fable. It is not to be taken as a record
of the Holocaust. Those who object to it are missing its point.</P>
<P> And that is simply where there is hope, where there is life and where
there is love, the spark of humanity will never be extinguished.</P>
