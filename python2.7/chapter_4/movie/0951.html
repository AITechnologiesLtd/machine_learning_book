                  A film review by Thomas E. Billings
                   Copyright 1991 Thomas E. Billings</PRE>
<P>Synopsis:
In 1920s China, an old man, the owner of a dye factory, buys a beautiful
young wife.  He beats her every night because she has not produced 
children, an heir.  Meanwhile, his young wife and his (adopted) son have
an affair, which results in the birth of a child.  A tale of adultery,
revenge, and murder.  Even though it has superb photography and
excellent acting, the story falls flat and the film is primarily a
mediocre melodrama.</P>
<P>China (English subtitles), color, 1990, 94 minutes.
Director:  Zhang Yi-mou</P>
<P>     This film has received considerable publicity recently because the
Chinese government has repressed the film in China (the film is banned
there).  Also, the film has been nominated for a (U.S.) Academy Award
in the "Best Foreign Language Film" category.  The Chinese government
asked that the film be withdrawn from Academy Award consideration on the
grounds that it has not been screened in its country of origin, a point
of considerable controversy.</P>
<P>     The film is set in a dye factory in 1920s China.  The factory is
owned by a cruel old man, whose only laborer is his adopted son.  The
old man buys a beautiful young bride, Ju Dou, his third wife (he beat to
death the first two wives).  The old man is apparently impotent; every
night he savagely beats Ju Dou because she is not yet pregnant.  In one
scene, Ju Dou is tied up while the old man is beating her; he tells her
"when I buy an animal, I treat it as I wish, and you're no better than
an animal".</P>
<P>     Ju Dou and Tian-qing, the adopted son of the mill owner, are
attracted to each other.  One day when the old man is away, the pair
become lovers, with Ju Dou actively seducing Tian-qing.  Soon she is
pregnant with Tian-qing's child.  Shortly thereafter the old-man is 
crippled in an accident, and confined to a crude wheelchair.  The story
continues with the birth of the child, and the two lovers confronting
the social limits on their relationship (adultery being punishable by
death).</P>
<P>     The film is excellent in many respects.  The photography is
beautiful, the set design is very colorful, with shards of dyed cloth
hanging from the rafters of the dye factory.  The acting is generally
excellent, with a superb performance by Li Wei as the cruel, sadistic
factory owner who thinks he can make his wives pregnant by beating them.
The film Direction is good also (Director Zhang Yi-mou's earlier works
include RED SORGHUM).  Some of the writing is very good also.</P>
<P>     However, despite having so much going for it, the film quickly
turns into a predictable melodrama.  Because the story weakens so much
in the second half, the film is not as good as, for example, A GIRL FROM
HUNAN, or the soap-opera-ish THE REINCARNATION OF GOLDEN LOTUS.</P>
<P>     Although it is not as good as some other Chinese films (whether
from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong), the film suggests that the stagnation in
the film industry of China may be ending.  (The events in Tienamen
Square, and the crackdown afterward, seriously disrupted the film 
industry in China.)  I recommend the film to fans of melodrama, and to
anyone that appreciates Chinese films.</P>
<P>Distribution.  In its first U.S. release; currently (3/15) showing in
the San Francisco area (San Francisco: Gateway Cinema).  May be 
available in other areas also, showing primarily in "arthouse" type
theaters.  The U.S. distributor for the film is Miramax Films.</P>
