<P> The Bone Collector (1999) 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Denzel
Washington, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker and Luis Guzman.
Directed by Phillip Noyce.</P>
<P> In "The Bone Collector," the murder mystery is ludicrious, the killer is a
wimp and the finale is preposterous.</P>
<PRE> So, why am I recommending this movie?</PRE>
<P> Simple: Denzel Washington and a strong supporting cast.</P>
<P> Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, a legendary NYPD forensics expert, now
bed-ridden after a near fatal accident that cost him the use of his arms
and legs.</P>
<P> Rhyme is a man afraid. His mind works like a precision timepiece, but his
body is failing him. Seizures are growing more violent and any day one
could put him into a permanent vegetative state.</P>
<P> Rhyme's only wish is to end life on his terms, with dignity.</P>
<P> But then Rhyme's is given a reason to continue. A series of grisly murders
are being perpetrated by an unknown killer who is leaving cryptic clues at
the crime scenes. The only person who can interpret them is Rhyme.</P>
<P> The best sequences of "The Bone Collector", directed by Phillip Noyce
("Patriot Games," "Clear and Present Danger") are those set in Rhyme's
apartment where his former forensics team sets up shop to be his arms and
legs.</P>
<P> Added to this group is Angela Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), a street-smart cop
who comes to Rhyme's attention after she stops a train to prevent it from
rumbling over a crime scene.</P>
<P> Rhyme believes Donaghy has a natural-born gift for forensics and she
becomes his eyes at the various crime scenes.</P>
<P> The interplay between Denzel Washington's Rhyme, Jolie's Donaghy and the
various members of the team, most notably character actor Luis Guzman
("Boogie Nights," HBO's "Oz") and Queen Latifah as Rhyme's compassionate
nurse, is the spine of "The Bone Collector."</P>
<P> Where the movie, based on a best-selling novel by Jeffrey Deaver and
adapted by Jeremy Iacone, is weakest is in dealing with the killings.</P>
<P> In retrospect they are too intricate, too thorough to have been carried
out by the character finally revealed to be the mad killer. His motivations
are implausible and his final confrontation with Rhyme borders on the
improbable.</P>
<P> "The Bone Collector" even falls back on the hoariest of cliches, the
villainous explanation. That is when the bad guy has the hero in his
clutches and all he has to do is shoot him. But, no, the villain gloats and
begins giving a long spiel about how smart he is, how he manipulated the
hero and why our hero is reponsible for our killer's murderous rampage.</P>
<P> Of course, all this does is allow one or more of the hero's compatriots to
arrive on the scene in the nick of time to save him.</P>
<P> You'd think this device had been used in enough films that the villain
would know better.</P>
<P> Another inexcusable cliche is the arrogant, self-important, inept police
superior who thinks he is smarter than the hero. Here, he is played by
Michael Rooker, a fine character actor reduced to a shouting, stomping
stereotype.</P>
<P> Despite these shortcomings, "The Bone Collector" is an enjoyable, albiet
gruesome, excursion. It's a funhouse experience that will offer some goose
bumps.
Washington and Jolie create sparks, and both give potent performances.</P>
<P> Washington, especially, confined to a bed portrays a man who wants to live
- or die - by his own precepts.</P>
<P> Just ignore the flimsy finale and savor the first 100 minutes. "The Bone
Collector" won't disappoint.</P>
