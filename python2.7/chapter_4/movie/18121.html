<P>   If tourism to Egypt drops off during the next month or so,
don't blame the Egyptian Tourist Board.  As Dan Quayle
might say, blame this on the movies, specifically on one that
makes the North African state appear to be a dull place
indeed.  "The Mummy" is the culprit this time: a pot pourri of
special effects that forgot about dialogue, acting and even set
design.  Brendan Fraser does OK in the role of a
self-deprecatory Yankee Zorro who falls for a pyramid
scheme.  He's a muscular enough guy as we noted in his
role as Adam in "Blast from the Past" and has a resonant
voice, proficient in commanding the folks trapped in the
wrong place at the wrong time.  As the object of his affection,
Rachel Weisz was more the three-dimensional human being
as the shy but caring Amy Foster in "Swept From the Sea,"
but looks darn good here as a flapper-librarian as adept at
knocking over bookshelves as she is at thumping Fraser's
heart strings.  But just as technology does not always do
things better than human beings, this "Mummy" does not
match the gauzy characters played by the likes of Boris
Karloff and Christopher Lee in sound movies as far back as
1932.  </P>
<P>   Though modern-day Hamitic people have shifted their
loyalties to more peaceful leaders like Anwar Sadat and
Hosni Mubarek, the vindictive slaveowners three millennia
back were anything but forgiving.  Because of their
malevolence, the title character of writer-director Stephen
Sommers's yarn has good reason to be irked.  For playing
around with Pharaoh's daughter, his judges did not waste
time on impeachment proceedings but rather sentenced him
to a death so horrific that the penalty had not before been
tried.  Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was buried alive, his only
companions a horde of heckling bugs which, not being
exceptionally hungry at the time, dined leisurely on the
miscreant to afford him--and the pests--more time to think of
the pleasures of the flesh.  Needless to say the area of
desert that served as his shrine is called "evil ground," so
that everyone is advised to picnic elsewhere where the bugs
are not so ravenous.  Let sleeping studs lie.</P>
<P>   You'd think that mummies would be happy about being
awakened, cooped up as they've been for some millennia. 
But no, these ungrateful poster boys for Johnson and
Johnson are perpetually  angry.  Hostility is a tradition with
them, since 1932 , when Boris Karloff was revived after
thousands of years in an incarnation that was chills ahead of
its follow-ups, including the "The Mummy's Hand" made eight
years later; the 1944 "Mummy's Curse," the "Mummy's
Ghost" of that same year, the 1959 British "Mummy," and the
1967 bomb "The Mummy's Shroud."  This time around, the
fable has been deconstructed.  No bandages: the little
creatures took care of them, so that all that's left of Imhotep
since he nodded off in 1290 B.C. is a guy who looks like the
product of a seriously botched rhinoplasty.  </P>
<P>   When Sommers jumps to 1923, he focuses on the hulky
Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) who has just been promoted
to commanding officer of his French Foreign Legion troupe. 
He fights off a band of evil-looking men, giving orders in
perfect English, somehow hooks up with a comely,
hieroglyphics-endowed librarian, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and
her nerdy brother Jonathan (John Hannah), and goes off to
find a lost city with its buried treasure.  They wake up the
creature who, after three thousands years does not even take
time to go to the bathroom but who instead enlists the help of
some American tourists and Arabs to supply him with the vital
organs he needs (presumably to go to the bathroom).</P>
<P>   The only way to play yet another "mummy" is to take the
show to camp, but Sommers's script failed to capture much
more than a smile from the huge all-media audience at a
recent New York screening.  The sallies are on the level of
what we hear during the early part of the story, when the
Legion captain runs in fear from the galloping enemy and
Rick O'Connell's right-hand man tells Rick "You've just been
promoted."  The bugs that spring to life are generic horror
creatures that predictably crawl up their victims' bodies from
feet to neck and the mummy--who at first looks like a decent
drawing in Gray's Anatomy--comes off just a bit scarier when
he acquires his organs and looks like a human being.</P>
<P>   If only this title character did not talk so much, we could
have been in for some fun.  In a scene near the movie's
conclusion, he has the lovely Evelyn tethered to a board,
about to sacrifice her so that he can fully revive the princess
he's pined for these three thousand years.  Lifting a knife
ever so slowly, he says to no one in particular that when he
has plunged the dagger into Evelyn's ample bosom he will be
invincible.  This would not be the first time that announcing
plans gives the hero the time he needs to foil the villain's
strategy and to lead to the usual, predictable resolution.</P>
