<PRE>THE BOXER
Rating: *** (out of four)
R, 1997
Director: Jim Sheridan
Screenplay: Jim Sheridan & Terry George
Starring Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Brian Cox, Ken Stott, Gerald
McSorley</PRE>
<P>At its root level, Jim Sheridan's THE BOXER is a commentary on the
political strife that plagues Northern Ireland and a challenge to both
sides to put down the guns. But rather than focusing on the violence
itself, it fashions a political statement by showing us how the "Troubles"
have affected everyday people.</P>
<P>Daniel Day-Lewis stars in the lead as Danny Flynn, a former IRA member who
has just finally finished his 14-year prison sentence for terrorist
activities and no longer wants anything to do with the violent side of the
Republican movement. He and his former girlfriend Maggie (Emiliy Watson)
quickly discover that they are still in love, but she was married to
another prisoner many years ago. Because she is a "prisoner's wife," her
marriage, though she herself no longer believes in it, carries political
significance: if it breaks up, it stands as a sign of disunity among
Republican forces. Day-Lewis and Watson perform admirably, portraying their
relationship with almost no cliche or cheesiness, and I particularly
enjoyed the way they found themselves drifting back together without
consciously trying to do so.</P>
<P>Danny, in the meantime, has teamed up with his friend Ike Weir (Ken Stott)
to start a non-sectarian boxing club in Belfast. He is not without enemies,
most notably Harry (Gerald McSorley), an IRA hard-liner who wants nothing
to do with the emerging peace agreement. Joe Hamill (Brian Cox), Maggie's
father, is a moderate IRA leader who would like to settle for peace, but he
disapproves of his daughter's relationship with Danny because of the
political element.</P>
<P>There is, I suspect, a temptation for filmmakers to take politically
controversial material like that of THE BOXER and fashion an extremely
intense and volatile story around it. Sheridan and co-writer Terry George
take a different approach: the tone of their film is more sad and regretful
than anything else, augmented partly by their decision to shoot most of the
scenes in bluish, hazy cinematography. When a bomb goes off during the
first match at the boxing club and rioting breaks out in the streets,
Sheridan chooses not to stage a pumped-up action sequence and instead gets
his audience to share in the disappointment of Danny and Ike that their
attempt to hold a peaceful gathering between Catholics and Protestants has
failed.</P>
<P>As a matter of fact, one problem that THE BOXER runs into is that it is so
far removed from the mentality of violence that the violent pasts of Danny
and Joe are never quite convincing. Joe, in particular, seems like a nice
family man who just happens to have once ordered quite a few people to be
killed by IRA terrorist attacks. Danny is less of a problem, given that he
left the IRA at a young age, but sometimes he seems too mild-mannered even
for boxing, much less terrorism.</P>
<P>Sheridan also runs into a structural problem in that none of the conflicts
in THE BOXER have easy solutions. (After all, if they did, Northern Ireland
might have had peace years ago.) He and co-writer George accordingly force
a "big confrontation" at the end which basically relies on McSorley's
character turning into a complete loose cannon. It solves the characters'
personal problems, but not the political conflicts that gave rise to them.
I'm not saying that the screenplay should have tried to solve the political
conflicts, as this would have been completely unrealistic, but this ending
just didn't seem to work: it was as if they were trying to fake dramatic
closure instead of simply acknowledging its impossibility.</P>
<P>Films that receive the three-star rating from me generally fall into two
categories: those that are only moderately ambitious in the first place and
just try to entertain for a little while (e.g. THE GAME or AUSTIN POWERS),
and those that have lofty goals and solid underlying ideas but don't quite
cross all the Ts and dot all the Is (e.g. GATTACA or THE END OF VIOLENCE).
THE BOXER is an example of the latter: the execution is sloppy in a few
places, but its heartfelt examination of the "Troubles" is enough to make
it a good film.</P>
