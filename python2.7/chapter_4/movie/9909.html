<PRE>MONEY TALKS
(R)</PRE>
<PRE>Reviewed by E. Benjamin Kelsey</PRE>
<PRE>* 1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>Apparantly money talks . . . and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so!
I've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can
possess, whether in language, violence, sex, or what have you. I find that
this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes
overboard, and MONEY TALKS definitely does! It's not so much that the movie
swore nearly constantly (and I mean constantly!), but it swore SO MUCH that
it seemed overly prominent and way too staged. Perhaps if one character were
foul mouthed, but in this film, EVERYBODY swears nearly every other word.</P>
<P>MONEY TALKS is about a black ticket scalper named Franklin Hatchett (played
less annoyingly than expected by Chris Tucker). Franklin is your typical
con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him. When the plot
finally gets underway, there's no less than three people (or groups) that
want him, dead or alive. The Frenchman who's somewhat responsible for
Franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus, a hoodlum whom Franklin owes
seven grand, and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder.</P>
<P>Franklin's only hope: James Russell (Charlie Sheen), an investigative
reporter for the local news who's out to prove himself a worthy journalist.
James offers to help clear Franklin's name if Franklin will just allow him an
exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week. Both of these
elements are completely lost along the way however, and never do reappear.</P>
<P>As expected, the odd couple of Franklin and James do wind up friends at the
end, which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of
becoming friends at any point along the way. There is just nothing original
or intriguing about this film, and so many developments are either
non-relevant, or just plain forgotten about. MONEY TALKS is a
paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience.
Frivilous dialogue, a predictable, flat storyline, and two-dimensional
characters make MONEY TALKS a reason to save your money.</P>
