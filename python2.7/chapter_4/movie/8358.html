<PRE>Daytrippers, 1996</PRE>
<P>Seen on 26 July 1997 at the Cineplex Odeon Worldwide for $3 by myself.</P>
<P>Just after Thanksgiving, happy couple Louis (Stanley Tucci) and Eliza
(Hope Davis) make love; the following day she discovers what appears to be
a highly literate love note to her husband. How she deals with it and what
ensues is not realistic, but if you let that slide, you will enjoy the
film. What does she do? She immediately discusses the matter with the
whole family, who, since they were going into New York anyway, pile into
the station wagon and head for Louis' office.</P>
<P>The Malone family includes Rita (Anne Meara), Jim (Pat McNamara), younger
daughter Jo (Parker Posey), and her boyfriend Carl (Liev Schreiber). Their
journey is improbable and leads to some other implausible events a la
After Hours. But, the guaranteed overheard dialog is still engaging and
entertaining. First Eliza and Rita invade Louis publishing office. Later,
when tracking Louis down to a Soho apartment, the entire group winds up
invading the home of a young man who is hiding his deadbeat dad from the
authorities. 
And yes, they eventually invade the book party Louis is supposed to be at
later that night. All this in a car without a working heater. </P>
<P>The movie's strengths are the dialogue and the pacing. It is a low-budget
independent feature, and the real-time telling of tales lends itself to
the no-money-for-editing look of the film. There is a drabness and
darkness (literally) that suits it well. A lot of the dialogue gems are in
the side stories and overheards.</P>
<P>The Daytrippers sums up the very American characteristic of spilling ones
guts to anyone and everyone: the publishing assistant recounting his
latest sexcapade; Eliza walks into a party and a guest (Marcia Gay Harden)
latches onto her for dear life. Rita, who is insufferable to everyone in
her family, hold back nothing to Rob and Leon, just after taking over
their kitchen. [Great line from her long-suffering husband: "For the love
of God, don't let her make soup!"]</P>
<P>Early on, true to his student nature, Carl pontificates how the middle
class is concerned with trivialities that keep them from meaningful
interaction. What he, and everyone else, learns is that being on vacation
is enough to make relationships buckle or unravel.</P>
<P>This is writer/director Greg Mottola's first feature-length effort. For
what it is, it succeeds. The casting is good: Anne Meara dominates as the
shrewish Rita; Liev Schreiber is as convincing as the novelist wannabe
college boyfriend as he was as one of the kidnappers in Ransom; Parker
Posey works well as the rebellious, quirky, and annoyed Jo. Campbell Scott
(a co-producer) makes two appearances as a writer.</P>
<P>Also noteworthy is Richard Martinez's music, which makes a ride on the
Long Island Expressway feel like some sort of dream or fairytale (believe
me, it's not). </P>
