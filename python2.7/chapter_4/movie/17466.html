<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:   <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Here's a way to tell if a movie is really bad:  Take a peek at your
watch when the credits start to roll.  If it's exactly 90 minutes from
the time the lights went down, odds are you just suffered through a real
stinker.  Why?  Because the director probably delivered a 120-minute
opus to the studio, who immediately recognized it for the piece of dung
that it was, slapped the director silly and hacked it down to a
viewer-friendly run time.  Another way to tell is if somebody sitting
next to you keeps saying, `My, God.  I wish I was dead!'  That's how the
person sitting next to me was tipped off to the fact that it blew.</P>
<P>Riding the wave of the retro fad, the popular ‘70s television series
bullies its way into theaters with a lethal blend of bad acting,
scripting and directing.  In case you're too young to remember the show,
it was about three teen delinquents who, for some reason, became
undercover cops that fought both crime and fashion ideologies.  There's
Linc (Omar Epps, Higher Learning), a former arsonist that seems more
concerned with his ride than anything else.  There's Julie (Claire
Danes, My So-Called Life), a recovering alcoholic convicted of assault.
And there's Pete (Giovanni Ribisi, The Other Sister), a dimwitted
burglar and spawn of the hostile suburbs.  Three fenceposts could have
been more effective.  Did I mention that they weren't allowed to carry
guns?  That's right – an action movie nearly devoid of delicious
gunplay.  That's sort of like drinking a can of Coke that's been open
for three months.</P>
<P>There are two scenes that I particularly enjoyed.  One occurred when the
three idiots were working undercover in a sex club.  Communicating only
with a series of secret winks and hand gestures, they delve deeply into
their undercover identities, being careful to make sure that nobody
believes either that they're cops or that they know each other.  Then
they all go home in the same car.  In another dazzling display, Linc has
to don a disguise to go incognito when on the run from some crooked
detectives, so he puts on a hat.  A hat.  That's his disguise.</P>
<P>The Mod Squad is sort of like The Brady Bunch movies – everyone else
dresses and acts like they're living in the present day, but the stars
dress like disco is still king.  They use hip lingo like `solid' and
`right on,' and whenever something really exciting happens – and believe
me, these moments are few and far between – the music awkwardly shifts
from ‘90s modern rock to ‘70s deep funk.  You know, Shaft stuff.  The
film has the look of a Levi's button-fly loose-fitting wide-legged
baggy-crotch jeans commercial – all edgy and alternative.  And if you
can't get enough of Giovanni Ribisi playing that semi-retarded role
(like Friends), then this is the picture for you.  The rest of you
should just stay away.</P>
