<P>     It opens with images of a late-night poker game:  cards, chips, 
sweaty palms, concerned faces, and a woman's fingernails.  Then, as 
night turns to day, the camera moves into the streets of New York, and, 
with the first bit of dialogue, we know we've slipped into the world of 
David Mamet.  No one else writes lines quite like him:  profane, 
staccato, and ending when you think there's more coming. This isn't just 
a Mamet-scripted movie, either.  It's a Mamet-scripted movie based on a 
Mamet play.  Like GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS and OLEANNA, it's clear that 
AMERICAN BUFFALO started life on the stage.</P>
<P>     Mamet doesn't write for the ordinary movie-goer, which is why 
AMERICAN BUFFALO has received such limited distribution, irrespective of 
Dustin Hoffman's presence.  The writer is an acquired taste.  Although 
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS won much critical praise, popular opinion was less 
kind.  And views on OLEANNA were so widely divergent that, when the film 
came out, it was difficult to find two people with exactly the same 
impression.  Whether you like him or hate him, though, Mamet usually 
provokes a strong reaction.</P>
<P>     AMERICAN BUFFALO starts out torturously slowly, with lots of 
cryptic dialogue about not confusing business with pleasure, a "broken 
toaster", and some kind of "job" that a couple of down-on-their-luck 
guys are preparing to pull.  Those men are Don (Dennis Franz), the owner 
of a New York junk shop, and Teach (Dustin Hoffman), a '90s version of 
MIDNIGHT COWBOY's Ratso Rizzo.  The third character in the story is a 
teenage boy named Bobby (Sean Nelson) -- a kid without any apparent 
home, who views Don as a father-figure.  He wants to help in the 
upcoming job, but the two adults are reluctant to get him involved.</P>
<P>     It's an understatement to say that the film improves after the 
unpromising opening.  As we become more comfortable with the erratic 
rhythm of Mamet's dialogue, the plot starts to emerge.  Don and Teach 
are planning to rob some rich guy's coin collection (the title, AMERICAN 
BUFFALO, refers to the pre-Jefferson nickel), but they don't have a plan 
or a clear sense of what they're doing.  Fundamentally, they're both 
losers.  Teach, a take-things-as-they-come person, wants to get down to 
the action.  Don, a more careful man, wants everything planned out in 
advance.  This conflict leads to a fascinating scene where the two men, 
sitting in the back of Teach's car, discuss the psychology of home safes 
-- why people have them, what combinations they use for the locks, and 
where they hide the piece of paper they write the combination on.</P>
<P>     Like a well-written musical composition, AMERICAN BUFFALO builds to 
a crescendo.  The climax, which features a three-way confrontation 
between Teach, Don, and Bobby, and raises the specter that one or more 
might be double-dealing and committing a betrayal, is explosive.  The 
sense of paranoid claustrophobia makes the tension almost unbearable.  </P>
<P>    Director Michael Corrente, who debuted with the derivative gangster 
film, FEDERAL HILL, does justice to Mamet's script.  He elects not to 
open up the story, but still manages to remind us that the dying city of 
New York lies just beyond the junk shop's doors.  And, after the 
uncertain first third, Corrente builds a grim, edgy mood that never 
abates.  When the rain and thunder start outside, their fury is nothing 
compared to the storm building around the characters.</P>
<P>     Dustin Hoffman plays Teach with caged energy.  He's all mannerisms 
and nervous tics -- the waiting is unbearable; he wants to act.  He's 
the consummate failure who never gives up hoping for that one big score.  
It should come as no surprise that Al Pacino played the part on stage.  
But, by harkening back to MIDNIGHT COWBOY and resurrecting aspects of 
the long-dormant Ratso Rizzo, Hoffman makes this role his own.   It's 
the kind of towering performance that, if it came in a bigger film, 
would start talk of an Oscar nomination.</P>
<P>     Dennis Franz, an Emmy winner for NYPD BLUE, holds his own opposite 
Hoffman.  His Don is the picture of a man wracked by uncertainty.  
Should he do the job or not?  Should he bring in a third man?  Should he 
trust Bobby?  Should he trust Teach?  Does he need the money badly 
enough to put up with all this aggravation?  Meanwhile, Sean Nelson, who 
first appeared in FRESH, brings an enigmatic mixture of hardness and 
innocence to his portrayal of Bobby, keeping us unsure, until the end, 
of the character's motives.  Unfortunately, he doesn't quite have the 
screen presence to stand toe-to-toe with his experienced co-stars.</P>
<P>     In the final analysis, AMERICAN BUFFALO is an intense, but flawed, 
piece of drama.  The ending winds the tension so tautly that everything 
feels ready to snap, but, to reach that point, it's necessary to plod 
through a murky beginning.  Mamet's play may be twenty years old, but 
the themes of loyalty, betrayal, and ruthlessness are as applicable to 
the current social and economic environment as they were in the '70s.   
And that's a compelling reason why, if you don't mind the initial 
discomfort, it's worth staying for the entire film.</P>
