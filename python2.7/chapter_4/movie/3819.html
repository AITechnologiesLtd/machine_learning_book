<PRE>                                 NINE MONTHS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     NINE MONTHS has all the makings of an incredible disaster.  First,
its star (Hugh Grant) is arrested for lewd conduct.  Second, it's a
remake of a French film (NEUF MOIS), always a huge negative.  Finally,
it's a comedy decidedly for adults which is directed by the infantile
Chris Columbus, the man who brought us the HOME ALONE franchise and
MRS. DOUBTFIRE.</P>
<P>     Imagine my shock; NINE MONTHS is pretty good.  The success of the
film is due *entirely* to the radiant presence of Julianne Moore as
Rebecca, a woman who finds herself unintentionally pregnant and with no
clue as to what to do.  Grant plays Samuel, the world's most neurotic
boyfriend, who has to "grow up" and come to grips with the fact that
his convertible has no room for a baby seat.</P>
<P>     Rounding out the cast are Tom Arnold and Joan Cusack, a pair of
obnoxious breeders that serve as foils for the cathartic Samuel.  Robin
Williams plays a bumbling, Russian obstetrician who seems to be
learning about pregnancy at the same time as Rebecca.  You don't have
to look far beyond the last three actors' names to figure out what goes
on when they're on the screen:  raw, unfiltered, and often
unnecessarily vulgar, comedy.</P>
<P>     NINE MONTHS hits the metaphor pretty hard ... never missing a moment
to tell us just how great the pregnancy-childbirth experience is, and
Samuel is constantly rebuked for his beliefs that the world is
overpopulated and (more importantly) that he will be incapable of being
a good father.  The result is a pretty heavy-handed "message" movie
that will not stop beating its theme into the viewer.</P>
<P>     It drags a bit at times, and the film never becomes really
engrossing, but whenever Moore is on screen, none of that seems to
matter.  The emotion and power she puts into her performance make every
second of the film worth watching, if only to get to Julianne's next
scene.  It might not be the best way to make a film work, but in this
day and age I'll take just about anything.</P>
<P>     NINE MONTHS is a film with a huge identity crisis.  Columbus
obviously couldn't give up slapstick (i.e., HOME ALONE), filling what
could have been a touching romance with antics that are entirely out of
place here.  Again, this is *not* a kids' movie, as the mother of the
child who sat behind me at the screening can attest to (when he asked
what a particularly explicit piece of anatomy was).</P>
<P>     Incidentally, I had the fortune to see this film with a woman who
happens to be currently pregnant.  She loved the film ("double thumbs
up") and was pretty impressed with the realism given to Rebecca's
experience.  As she put it, only the constant puking was missing.</P>
<PRE>     Come to think of it, I'm not sure I needed to see that anyway.</PRE>
