<PRE>                            THE SIXTH SENSE
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This is a slow and deliberate
          psychological horror film about a boy who sees
          visions that terrify him. They are slowly eating
          away at his mind and soul. The script is itself a
          trap to tantalize the viewer and snap shut only in
          the final moments of the film.  And it has one of
          the best performances of the year from any actor.
          But it is particularly amazing that the actor is
          young Donnie Wahlberg.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high
          +2 (-4 to +4).  Spoiler warning: The trailer for
          this film tells the main premise of the plot which
          would not otherwise be obvious until well into the
          film.  This review will reveal no more than the
          trailer does.  I have not seen any reviews that do
          not reveal the premise.</PRE>
<P>     Thematically similar to the current STIR OF ECHOES, THE SIXTH
SENSE is a horror story told so subtly that it is a psychological study
that is told against a backdrop that is almost magical realism.  It is
a mystery told so subtly that the viewer does not even recognize it as
a mystery until at the end the solution is presented.  Then the viewer
may want to see the film a second time just to verify if the script is
consistent and to see how well the mystery was hidden.</P>
<P>     Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis) is a South Philadelphia
child psychologist.  He is so good at what he does he has been given a
citation from the mayor.  Currently he is dealing with a severely
disturbed child, Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg).  Malcolm knows that
the classic treatment and assumptions of treating children with this
syndrome can be wrong.  The last similar patient grew up highly
disturbed and blaming Malcolm.  In revenge he broke into Malcolm's
house, shooting the psychologist.  Malcolm desperately wants to avoid
the same mistakes in treating Vincent.  But from the beginning he is
having serious trouble connecting with Vincent or in truth with anyone.
His bad experience with the previous patient has left him almost
without the emotions to reach out.  What he slowly begins to discover
is that Vincent is trying to adjust in any way he can to something
beyond an emotional problem. His problem is that he sees the dead.  It
is not just that believes he sees the dead--they really are there and
they talk to him.  He will see a dead child, start to talk to him, and
then see the back of the child's head is blown off. He lives with a
thousand unpleasant jolts like this every day.  The resulting shock is
just more than he can handle much of the time.</P>
<P>     Bruce Willis obviously gets top billing for this film being a
veteran of so many high-grossing films.  In fact he turns in one of his
most subdued and best performances here.  But he is playing opposite an
even better actor.  Donnie Wahlberg has some very difficult scenes to
deliver as the haunted--figuratively and literally--child.  Too young
to have gone through the years of training most of today's actors have,
he seems to be a natural actor capable instinctively of giving a
layered performance.  Whether he is remembered at Academy Award time or
not he has given just about the best performance of the year and he has
made a difficult film work.  Certainly some credit must go to writer
and director M. Night Shyamalan who must have known exactly what
haunted feel he wanted from Wahlberg.  Shyamalan keeps the pacing slow
and ominous throughout.  The James Newton Howard score is not one of
his best but adds to the tension.</P>
<P>     This is a film with some clever twists and a really good
performance by a child actor.  This may be the surprise film of the
season.  I give it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
