<P>Full of fun, great animation and fine voice-acting, Walt Disney Pictures' 
THE TIGGER MOVIE is a welcome addition to the bleak theater offerings of 
mid-February.</P>
<P>Taking full advantage of the solid Winnie the Pooh franchise, the producers 
have added new dimensions to many of its characters.  We see the most of 
Tigger, of course, the namesake of the movie;  he is friendly towards all 
the inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood.  What's charming is that this 
treatment creates a close friendship between Tigger and Roo, the tiny son of 
Kanga, and the most child-like character, besides Tigger himself.</P>
<P>The main plot of the film has Tigger yearning for a family of his own:  it's 
no longer the most wonderful thing about Tiggers, that he's the only one!</P>
<P>At first the group of animal friends goes off on little sorties, searching 
for other Tiggers, as though they are convinced of their existence.  Finally 
- and this is perfect - the friends agree to write a letter to Tigger, from 
his family;  the pompous Owl wields the pen, and the letter is co-written, 
one line from each of the major characters.  It's heartfelt advice, stuff 
like "Eat well" (Pooh-bear's contribution), "Stay safe and sound," and other 
sentiments, reveals much about the true and important feeling imparted by 
membership in a family unit.  Soon the letter is on its way, and Tigger is 
indeed convinced that his family is real.  When Tigger readies his 
ramshackle house for a welcoming party, his motley friends end up donning 
Tigger costumes and try to trick their overactive tiger-like pal.  Some of 
the most cinematically stunning effects in any Pooh installment follow 
Tigger's disappointment at discovering he's been hoodwinked by his 
overzealous pals.</P>
<P>The voices are among the most engaging aspects of the movie.  Jim Cummings 
has done Pooh's voice since 1987, emulating well the hoarse mildness of the 
late Sterling Holloway.  Now he has assumed the duties of Tigger as well, 
after Disney's dismissal of the inimitable Paul Winchell.  It is amazing, 
however, how much Cummings sounds like the persona created by Winchell.  The 
inflections, wacky asides and "hoo-hoo" laughter is nearly dead-on.</P>
<P>Nine year-old Nikita Hopkins supplies the voice of Roo, an innocent and 
likable voice that's perfectly cast. Kanga is Kath Soucie, the ever-patient 
and loving mother-figure.</P>
<P>Peter Cullen does a nice job with the pessimistic Eeyore, an amusing droop 
to his voice.  Owl is voiced by Andre Stojka, a nice edge of pretension to 
his depiction.  Tom Attenborough does not get much screen time as 
Christopher Robin, the human owner of the "dolls" that live in the Hundred 
Acre Wood.  And veteran actor John Hurt does a decent turn as the narrator.  
I liked how this incarnation preserves the 1960's narrative technique of 
showing a storybook, letters and words pouring off the page at times.  But 
Hurt is not used enough to exert a strong presence in the story.</P>
<P>The sole carry-over from the old cast (which originated the Disney version 
of A. A. Milne's classic stories with the Academy Award-winning short 
"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day" in 1968) is John Fielder as Piglet, 
whose voice is even more light and humble than Pooh's.  Long experience has 
added a subtle sheen of sympathy to the voice of the friendly little pig.</P>
<P>Another star is the animation.  Much of it was done at Disney's Japan 
animation center, with other parts being shared around the globe.  Featured 
are muted colors - hues that compliment well the simple and heart-warming 
narrative line.  The green pastel trees and stylized backgrounds are 
unmistakably Disney, a quaint throwback mix of the "Disneyfied" and "Classic 
Pooh" styles in some ways.</P>
<P>Music is also excellent.  The original team that has done all the music for 
previous Poohs is back: Richard M. Sherman and brother Robert B. Sherman.  
The pace and lyrics and overall effect of their original songs add a good 
deal to the enjoyment factor.  Kenny Loggins collaborated on the closing 
ballad, while Harry Gregson-Williams capably supplied the rest of the score.</P>
<P>The film is rated G, another rare and welcome element in today's viewing 
culture.  It is very watchable for all ages, as the story moves quickly 
forward, not without a generous sprinkling of wit along the way.  See it now 
with a child or without;  it's one of those films you will never be sorry 
you sat through!</P>
