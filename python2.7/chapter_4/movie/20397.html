Susan Granger's review of "DUDLEY DO-RIGHT" (Universal Pictures)</PRE>
<P>         If there was ever the right actor to bring cartoonist Jay
Ward's brave but clueless Canadian Mountie to life, it's Brendan
Fraser. Like his goofy "George of the Jungle," Fraser embodies the
dim-witted hunk superbly, relishing his obvious mastery of the
physical comedy. The plot - which is designed to appeal to youngsters,
not adults - follows Do-Right as he attempts to foil a scheme
concocted by evil Snidely Whiplash, played broadly by Alfred Molina.
Even as a child, Dudley longed to be a mounted policeman, while his
pal Snidely only wanted to be "a bad guy." Now, Snidely wants to
pollute the town of Semi-Happy Valley by making it the target of a
fake gold rush, setting up a gullible prospector (Eric Idle) who
achieves such fame and fortune that he appears on "Live with Regis and
Kathie Lee." In the meantime, Dudley's in love with Nell - that's "Sex
and the City" girl, Sarah Jessica Parker - but, unfortunately, so is
Snidely. Directed by Hugh Wilson, this cheerful comedy is aimed at
5-10 year-olds, who will thoroughly enjoy it. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Dudley Do-Right" is a downright silly 6. Did you
know there's a Dudley Do-Right Emporium on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood,
where tourists are greeted by a 15-foot statue of Ward's famous
characters Rocky and Bullwinkle, who are set for the big screen next
summer in a live-action film starring Robert DeNiro, Rene Russo, and
Jason Alexander?</P>
