<P>(Dimension Films, "Scream 2"'s distributor, has asked press to say 
extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot. That's 
no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here, but 
I will do my best to be vague (now, there's a first).)</P>
<P>"The first one was [good], but all the rest sucked," said a  
cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's Wes Craven thriller "Scream," 
her statement referring to the films of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" 
series but really putting down franchise overkill in general. The 
comment certainly carries clout: For every truly great sequel, there 
appears to be a couple of duds, making one wonder if writers are better 
off sticking solely with fresh ideas. But like it or not, along comes 
"Scream 2." And believe it or not, it's a doozy -- a slick, sinister, 
madly subversive good time at the movies, as intent on sending up 
Hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher 
conventions. "Scream 2" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a 
follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride. </P>
<P>It's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad 
in Edvard Munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young 
populace of Woodsboro, California. Those surviving the ordeal have 
gotten on with their lives. Plucky heroine Sidney Prescott (Neve 
Campbell) is a drama student at the Midwestern Windsor College; her pop 
culture-whiz pal Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) has tagged along. Trash 
tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a best-seller 
based on their ordeal, the basis of which has been turned into a (very 
bad) movie called "Stab." And Dewey Riley (David Arquette), still 
suffering from wounds inflicted during "Scream," has left his job as a 
police officer for a while. </P>
<P>Life is tranquil ... at least for a while. Several sudden murders bring 
Sidney, Randy, Gale and Dewey together again, but with suspicious eyes 
cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these 
four people learned anything from the past, it's to trust no one. Thus, 
the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet, as well 
as: Derek (Jerry O'Connell), Sidney's new beau; Cici (Sara Michelle 
Gellar), a chatty sorority gal; Joel (Duane Martin), Gale's cameraman 
who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past; Hallie (Elise Neal), 
Sidney's sassy roommate; Debbie (Laurie Metcalf), a local reporter who 
gives Gale some not-too-friendly competition; and Mickey (Timothy 
Olyphant), Randy's good friend and fellow film student. Cotton Weary 
(Liev Schreiber), the man Sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder 
in Scream, also shows up on campus -- but why? </P>
<P>Like the first Scream, Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson 
inaugurate things with a bang. This time, it's an extended sequence that 
finds an African-American couple (Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps) attending 
a sneak preview of "Stab," making sly references about everything from 
Sandra Bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema. 
Before tragedy ensues at the screening, the movie-within-a-movie setup 
allows for plenty of jokey moments, including a scene from "Stab" which 
turns Scream's now-famous Drew Barrymore prologue on its ear. ("B----, 
hang up the phone and Star-69 his a--!" Pinkett yells at the screen.) 
It's funny, creepy stuff (I don't think I'll ever feel safe in a movie 
theater again) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares 
and spoofy laughs down the road. Another flawless example of this is a 
riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on Randy, Dewey and Gale in 
broad daylight; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror 
because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters. 
There are other superb set pieces, but explaining them risks ruining 
their effect. </P>
<P>There are more players this time around as to provide both a higher 
number suspects and a staggering body count. It's something of a 
trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as 
fully-developed as the original "Scream" gang, but this movie packs in 
knowing performances (especially by Kennedy and Cox) and more death for 
your dollar. It can be argued that, while the original might outclass it 
by a tad, Scream 2 is both scarier and funnier. It certainly doesn't 
skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member 
very near and dear to my heart (I actually questioned Craven and 
Williamson's judgment here, considering how much this person has added 
to these films). Sometimes you wish that more could have been done with 
Stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans, 
there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "The Usual Suspects," 
"Aliens" and "The Empire Strikes Back." </P>
<P>Still, "Scream 2" does so many things right, it's petty to quibble. Its 
penchant for parody is irresistible, discussions of the merits of film 
sequels and all. The attractive, solid cast is a definite bonus. And the 
denouement (while not as shocking as "Scream"'s) is priceless; the 
film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film 
prominently referred to in "Scream" with one of the best bad guy motives 
ever put on paper. All this and a "Scream 3" is in the works. Knowing 
the series' tendency for self-reference, perhaps one of its characters 
will again discuss the concept of sequel justice. Mentioning "Scream 
2"'ll help them in their argument. </P>
