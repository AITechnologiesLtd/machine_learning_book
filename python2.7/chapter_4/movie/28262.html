<PRE>MEMENTO
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
May 25th, 2001</PRE>
<P>"I can't make new memories. Everything fades, nothing sticks. By the time we 
finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I 
see you I won't know that I've ever met you before." - Leonard.</P>
<P>Thus, the above quotation says it all for "Memento," one of the most 
electrifying of all postmodern noir thrillers in years. Whereas "Run Lola 
Run" and "Pulp Fiction" revelled in irony, hipness and fractured timelines to 
tell their stories, "Memento" is a more eager return to what makes noir what 
it is - the purely existential. Martin Scorsese dared to go through such 
existential leaps minus the irony in "Bringing Out the Dead" as did Sean Penn 
in the brilliant "The Pledge." "Memento," though, will be remembered as the 
most disorienting and fatalistic of the new century, linking to the most 
frightening ordeal man could ever face, the inability to make new memories. </P>
<P>Such is the case with Leonard (Guy Pearce), a former insurance claims investi
gator who suffers from a rare disorder defined as "anterior grade memory 
loss" (also known as Korsokoff's syndrome). You see Leonard can't make new 
memories and the only way he can remember anything is by writing it down or 
by tatooing his body with written messages. After a few minutes, if he fails 
to write down important information or clues (usually on a handy Polaroid he 
shoots of any person he meets), he will forget as if the incident had never 
occured. </P>
<P>At the beginning of the film, Leonard kills an unarmed man named Teddy (Joe 
Pantoliano). Teddy's murder seems cold-blooded and, like most noir films that 
deal with a central narrator (that being Leonard), we expect flashbacks to 
see what led up to this event. A strange thing happens, though, in "Memento." 
Rather than seeing typical flashbacks in a convential, linear fashion, the 
story is told backwards thus the ending of the film is really the beginning 
and the beginning of the film is really the ending. Now the audience is faced 
with the daunting task of keeping all the facts straight in their minds as 
the events unfold on screen. I did not find it daunting as much as 
challenging and this Harold Pinter approach serves the purpose of the film. </P>
<P>It would not be fair to reveal much of "Memento" because the thrill of the 
film is in its surprise factor. This much can be said about the plot: Leonard 
is investigating the death of his wife by some character named "John G." His 
investigation leads to a sour, sweetly morose barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne 
Moss), who has gone through a similar loss and can help him out of pity. 
Naturally, as the film regresses, we learn Natalie is not quite the sour, 
kind woman we thought she was - your typical femme fatale. Then there's 
Teddy, the smiling cop or drug dealer (depending on your interpretation) who 
may be trying to help Leonard or may be trying to kill him. Add to the mix a 
local drug dealer, Leonard's memory of Sammy Jankis who supposedly suffered 
similar memory loss (and was part of Leonard's insurance claims), and co
nstant betrayals and backstabbing ploys. There is also a motel clerk who is 
nonplussed to learn that Leonard never remembers any conversation they have 
had, and thus tries to jokingly cheat Leonard out of a better motel room. No 
one is ever what they seem in this morally ambiguous universe and by 
structuring the film backwards, we learn the evolution of each character 
through Leonard's point-of-view. This also serves a more finite attraction: 
when we learn new information about a character as the film regresses, we 
realize the character's prior behavior and begin to see that Leonard may have 
the wrong idea or wrong motive for his later actions. This nonlinear 
breakdown of the story will no doubt lead to further viewings just to keep 
the characters straight.</P>
<P>"Memento" has a great, meaty story but if it were not for the beautifully 
restrained performances from the cast, the film would not work the same way. 
Guy Pearce is fierce and alive in every scene he is in. He is vulnerable and 
yet impulsive, no doubt due to his constant memory loss. He is not quite your 
typical hero, more of a disillusioned antihero. In a sense, Pearce undergoes 
a rather strange dilemma - if he does not remember what a person had done to 
him, he can just easily hurt the person who may have tried to help him. The 
Polaroids and the tattoos are messages that could lead to dangerous avenues 
if he is not quick enough to jot down finite details. All he does remember is 
that he has a condition (though that often escapes him as well) and he knows 
his wife was raped and murdered and he is aware of his former job. But as the 
film comes to a surprisingly fatalistic finish, we also sense that Leonard 
may have mixed up certain facts or perhaps he is in denial about his own 
mysterious past. Pearce brings Leonard to life in such an intoxicating manner 
that he becomes something of a human mine - don't step on him or you will 
explode.</P>
<P>Carrie-Anne Moss gives her first truly great performance here as the 
mysterious, duplicitous Natalie, exuding both toughness and sincerity with 
equal aplomb. She has a memorably frightening moment where she takes 
advantage of Leonard's condition and taunts him. Joe Pantoliano (who 
co-starred with Moss in "The Matrix") gives one of his funniest, quixotic 
performances in years as Teddy, and his character remains as much an enigma 
as Leonard does. Teddy may seem trustworthy but could he be using Leonard as 
well? </P>
<P>Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" was a tale of divorce told backwards and probably 
the first to use such a complicated device. There was also the hilarious 
"Seinfeld" episode that was told backwards and succeeded in delivering its 
punchlines with more gusto than usual. But "Memento" uses a gimmicky device 
to its advantage. We, the audience, only know as much information as Leonard 
knows thus his short-term memory loss is accentuated by telling the story 
backwards, especially since he can't make new memories. When Leonard is 
unsure of something, so are we. When he is disoriented, so are we. It is rare 
for a noir tale like this to make us feel the internal anxieties and fears of 
its main character. Watching "Memento" is like enduring an endless nightmare 
where our memory is a constant illusion in search of the truth. In the case 
of Leonard, his search for the truth may be fruitless and all we are left 
with are mementos to remind us of his own journey. </P>
