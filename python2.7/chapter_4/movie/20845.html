<PRE>Filmmakers in purgatory
After Life</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Imagine, right now, where you sit reading this article...you die, pack it
in, kick the bucket, pass on. You immediately arrive in your old (now quite
abandoned) high school building. There, some patient filmmaker explains that
you'll have three days to pick one memory from your life. One memory they'll
film. One memory with which to spend eternity. All other recollections lost.
Which fine moment would you pick? Could you pick?</P>
<P>Shot on 16mm "After Life" already has the film school feel. Add to that
documentary style interviews with a mix of actors and real people trying to
think of that one golden memory worth re-living for the rest of their lives
(post-mortemly speaking). The batch of recently deceased spend the next
three days reminiscing and choosing. A fellow with a poor memory is supplied
71 video tapes (one for each year of his life) with which to review and
ultimately, from which to select an event for recreation. After the third
day, set design begins. Then construction and finally filming. It's a
wonderfully interesting concept with some genuinely charming moments. But it
drags a bit after the initial interviews. The film could easily have been
ten to twenty minutes shorter (more than a few cuts are twice as long as
necessary). At times, I ached for a fast forward button.</P>
<P>Sweetly and gently crafted "After Life" asks a grand question to those newly
dead. Perhaps they could have improved their lot of "special events" had
they been asked while still alive. This may be "After Life's" greatest
gift -- all who view it are still alive (though a few may be sleeping).</P>
