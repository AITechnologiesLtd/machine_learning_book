<PRE>Don't Think ... Feel.
That's the Way I Like It</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Shot in Singapore, "That's the way I like it" is in English (or as they say
.. "Singlish") with no subtitles. We follow Ah Hock as he matures from a
rather selfish young adult into a caring individual with a wider view of the
world.</P>
<P>Still a kid at heart, Ah Hock is in love with Bruce Lee and a Triumph
motorcycle his job at the grocery store could never support. But it's 1977
and "Saturday Night Fever" finally dances into Singapore. Hock grabs
gal-buddy Mai and the two take lessons in hopes of winning a dance contest
so Hock can buy the bike of his dreams.</P>
<P>The movie follows the classic plot line of US golden oldie films: underdog
goes for a dream, gets advice from imaginary friend, is forced to take on
the advisory and ultimately learns a greater lesson for the effort.</P>
<P>Starting out kind of sticky (like a student piece), the film slowly matures
(much like it's primary character). Ultimately schmaltzy, you'll leave the
theater and feel good all night.</P>
