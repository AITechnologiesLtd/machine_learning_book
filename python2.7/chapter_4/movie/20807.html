<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>TV scribe David E. Kelley's second big-screen effort of the year is a
hackneyed adult version of The Mighty Ducks.  Film fans, beware – this
does not mean Slapshot.  In the movie, a small Alaskan town – and its
highly competitive brand of ice hockey - graces the cover of Sports
Illustrated, culminating in a showdown with the New York Rangers.  It's
a typical David-versus-Goliath picture, with the `loser' title affixed
only to the sucker in the audience that plunked down green to watch this
slow-moving abomination.</P>
<P>The first words in Mystery, Alaska are an expletive spoken by a kid too
young to know any better.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be
Kelley's attempt at irony (most of the adults say `jeez' and `for God's
sake' a la another snowy pic, Fargo) or his craving to work `blue' after
years and years of living under the watchful eye of television censors.
Remember Betty White in Kelley's summertime flop Lake Placid?  It's
probably the latter.</P>
<P>As the film opens, Mystery eagerly awaits the new issue of Sports
Illustrated, where a feature piece on the town's beloved `Saturday Game'
is scheduled to appear.  Arriving not long after the magazine is former
resident Charles Danner (Hank Azaria, Mystery Men) an employee of Sports
Illustrated, who arrives bearing great news – the National Hockey
League, impressed with the article, has agreed to fly the New York
Rangers to Mystery for an exhibition game against the locals.</P>
<P>Here is Problem No. 1:  I can look past the fact that the New York
Rangers would never play Mystery, but why would the game take place in
Alaska?  Would it not make more sense to fly the Mystery players to New
York so that the game could be played on a real ice rink?  In a bigger
arena?  Where you wouldn't need to fly a television crew and legions of
media personalities?  Mystery has 32 days to prepare for the game, both
in terms of team preparation and to remedy the fact that they usually
play on a pond in front of about fifty people.  They acquire a Zamboni
while workers quickly build a grandstand and install intricate
lighting.  In one shot, the film shows four cranes building the outdoor
rink.  I don't think there are four cranes in the entire state of
Alaska, let alone Mystery.</P>
<P>And let's talk about the advertising.  Once the game begins, viewers
will see a ton of advertising both on and around the rink.  Locals even
complain about this advertising, which is simply the filmmaker's way of
saying `See, this isn't really product placement.  It's an integral part
of the story.'  Bullshit.  Use make-believe advertisers if you want, but
don't try to legitimize the giant Coca-Cola logo at center ice that
fills the entire screen for the opening face-off.</P>
<P>There are plenty of other things to complain about, like the fact that
Kelley manages to somehow wedge in a legal battle involving the
potential opening of the mega-store Price World and its Mystery-bashing
emissary (Michael McKean).  Or the use of the Winetka brothers (Adam
Beach and Leroy Peltier) lifted right from Slapshot's Hansons.  Or the
cameo from Mike Myers (Mystery director Jay Roach also helmed both
Austin Powers pics), which reveals the actor's unfunny side.  Or The
Daily Show's hysterical Beth Littleford, who appears long enough to be
only a throwaway sexual joke.</P>
<P>None of the above complaints come close to matching the annoying and
time-consuming subplot in which the team coach/town sheriff John Biebe
(Russell Crowe, L.A. Confidential) is dropped from the big game in favor
of a younger, faster player with premature ejaculation.  This,
exacerbated by the arrival of his wife's (Mary McCormack, True Crime)
high school sweetheart (Azaria), leads to rocky times in the Biebe
household, leaving the film filled with the gooey sentiment of the worst
imaginable Hallmark card.</P>
<P>Highlights include town judge/coach Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights), who
resembles another old guy named Burgess Meredith in Rocky, shouting
advice to his team through clenched jaw and…well, that's about it.
