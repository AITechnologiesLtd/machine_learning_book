<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A bittersweet romantic comedy, French style. The one thing this film has
going for it, is Nathalie Baye in the starring role. She's been around
as a star ever since her 1973 role in Truffaut's "Day for Night" and Bob
Swaim's well-received "La Balance" (1982); Godard's 1979 Every Man for
Himself made her an international star. But, she has hardly had American
recognition because most of her over 50-films were not released in the
States. Here she stars as Angèle, an attractive forty-year-old
beautician working in the titled Parisian salon. She has a life history
of one-night stands because she's afraid of looking for love and getting
dumped on, as she once was when she was more trustful of men. This
became a very popular French film winning France's César awards for best
picture, best director, best young actress and best screenplay.</P>
<P>The film opens with Angèle, at a train station café, talking about
future plans with her much younger lover, who seems disinterested. When
she finishes, he insultingly tells her their affair is over because she
has a skinny ass. She's so hurt by this that she makes a public scene,
shouting curses at him and threatening to stalk him. Watching this take
place is a young bearded sculptor, Antoine (Le Bihan), who becomes
fascinated with her and stalks her.</P>
<P>In this romantic comedy, the two destined lovers must overcome all the
emotional barriers that separate them before their romance could be
fully tested. As is the custom in a French film of this kind, love is
the most important thing in the world. The film keys in on the working
class girl, who is concerned about aging and being alone. She has to put
aside her personal troubles and sell beauty to the varied women and few
men clients who open the salon door with the harp sounding chimes and
are inundated by the blue and pink surroundings, and all sorts of beauty
products and services for facials, massages, tanning (a Madame Buisse
(Claire Nebout) comes in without anything on under her trench coat - and
walks around nude before entering the tanning booth), or the various
other cosmetic services offered as 'feel good' treatments. The salon is
used as a metaphor for how women are deceived into thinking they can
change their surface appearances and find happiness through something as
superficial as cosmetics. It's also their one place of relaxing and
living with the lies they tell themselves, as they use this place as a
retreat from their real life problems.</P>
<P>Angèle is a good listener and offers friendly advice to her pampered
clients. She is trusted by the elegant business-oriented salon owner,
Nadine (Ogier), and is even encouraged by her to open up her own salon,
and she forms a workplace friendship with her two other  much younger
workers. The sexually active Samantha (Seigner) is ready to pack it in
and become a nurse, as she keeps falling in and out of love and is not
happy where she's at. While the very young and naive Marie (Tautou-Cesar
winner), is content in her job. She is gently wooed by a lonely, rich
widowed pilot (Hossein). He had a crippling accident which caused him to
have his wife's thigh skin grafted onto him and that is the reason he
comes into the salon daily so as to preserve the skin. He gives her
jewelry gifts and demands nothing in return, but Marie doesn't mind
pleasing him. Angèle is just a little puzzled why he didn't choose her.</P>
<P>At first, we don't know what to make of Antoine, whether he's a psycho
or just a drifter, as his straggly appearance is not appealing to
Angèle. When he catches up with her in a coffee shop after stalking her
at her salon, he comes on so strong that it's either a bit frightening
or weirdly comical. He tells her: "I can't stop thinking of you -- I
love you so much."</P>
<P>His plea for affection is so strong: that he shaves off his beard to
look more presentable for her, treats her to a delicious restaurant meal
and refuses a blow job because she's drunk. He tells her the truth about
breaking up with his beautiful young fiancee, and turns out to be an
intelligent and sensitive person; this makes Angèle rethink her attitude
about avoiding a true love affair.</P>
<P>In her confused state she still clings to her former boyfriend, whom she
doesn't love but  she still needs around to console her, the facially
scarred, so-called loser, Jacques (Bonnaffé). She also shows how she can
waltz into a restaurant alone and pick out the most attractive man,
albeit a married one, sit down with him, talk nonsense and go for a
quick bang shortly afterwards.</P>
<P>The beauty in this film is in the way Baye interprets her character's
many moods and of how she lives with the mental pain that she suffers
from, but still is a lively person who is capable of finding what joy
there is in her life while also maintaining a friendly, non-competitive
relationship with her clients and fellow workers.</P>
<P>It's a sexy French romp into familiar territory, with characters who
don't tell us much about what's inside them. But, "Venus..." is able to
remain pleasantly atmospheric until the nonsensical melodramatic climax,
when its charmed life runs out of charm.</P>
<P>There's nothing new uncovered about relationships here, in fact the main
relationship is more absurd than real. But Nathalie Baye is able to
carry off this fantasy romance story further than it deserved to go, and
for that alone it's worth a look.</P>
