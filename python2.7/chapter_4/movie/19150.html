<P>        Just as you might expect from any movie starring Will Smith and
released the 4th of July weekend, Barry Sonnenfeld's Wild Wild West will
remind you of how much money can be spent on a motion picture.  You can
feel the dollars that went into this movie.  It's one of those
ludicrously expensive films that makes you wonder just how much money
there really is in the world.  It's a massively unrestrained production,
bursting with computer-generated special effects in nearly every scene. 
The film is so obviously overpriced that I couldn't help but consider
the various costs of things, such as how much money it takes to
digitally remove Kenneth Branagh's legs from every scene he's in.  </P>
<P>And boy, I wish I could say I hated every minute of it.  The fact is, I
enjoyed this silly movie for almost every second I sat watching it, even
though the special effects are given more consideration than the
characters, even though it's astonishing to think of the financial
aspects behind the picture.  What makes Wild Wild West a likable
disaster of a summer blockbuster is Sonnenfeld's out-of-whack sense of
humor, and three goofy performances by three fine actors.  It's the
textbook definition of a guilty pleasure -- I hated myself for not
despising it.</P>
<P>The film is the latest chapter in a long line of Hollywood television
series remakes.  Will Smith stars as the gun-toting Jim West, assigned
by president Ulysses Grant to track down and destroy the renegade
General McGrath (Ted Levine).  West is teamed up with Artemus Gordon
(Kevin Kline), a gadget-happy U.S. Marshal who produces machines that
could not possibly have existed at any time in the 1800s.  Further
developments uncover the fact that the true villain is a legless
Suthun'er named Arliss Loveless (Branagh, decked out in a wacky beard
and long, jet-black hair).  Salma Hayek is also on board as the
necessary love interest, the twist being that both heroes are interested
in her love.</P>
<P>Wild Wild West suffers from the typical symptoms of Summer Blockbuster
Syndrome (SBS), including high-energy incoherence, intrusively
overproduced sets and special effects, a distinct lack in true story
development, and cartoonish characterizations.  Barry Sonnenfeld is one
of those directors I can't handle in large doses; he seems to operate in
a self-destructive manner, creating scenes and sequences so over-the-top
that it's easier to laugh at their sheer absurdity than it is to laugh
at the jokes he sprinkles about them.  Consider, for instance, the scene
in which West and Gordon first witness Loveless' giant mechanical
spider.  It's an amazing special effect, and really quite extraordinary
to witness on screen, but it's such an insane image that I could only
wonder what kind of mind would have thought to create it.</P>
<P>If that makes Wild Wild West a bad movie, at least it's an entertaining
bad movie.  Some critics have stated that Smith and Kline have no
chemistry, but I disagree.  Both actors have proven themselves as
effective comedians in previous films, and they don't botch the job
here.  Smith has kind of a dumfounded gaze on his face the whole way
through the film; this may be from a lack of compelling dialogue, or
perhaps he felt despair under the realization that a giant mechanical
spider is ultimately going to be more memorable than his performance. 
Nonetheless, he has an undeniably likable presence.  The same goes for
Kline, who works with Smith smoothly.  Kline is a more experienced comic
actor, and it shows -- he manages to get into his role a little better,
and actually makes Gordon a semi-credible character.</P>
<P>Branagh is absolutely perfect as the villain, and I think he hits the
note that Sonnenfeld was shooting for.  His performance is so absurd, so
far over the edge of sanity, that it's utterly impossible to take him
even the slightest bit seriously (not to mention the fact that your
attention will be focused on how they were able to digitally remove his
legs).  The scenes with Branagh ultimately work the best, and remind us
of the intended tone for the rest of the film.  There is a brain in Wild
Wild West -- it's not a stupid movie -- but it's not a very
well-adjusted picture, and often feels like it belongs in the cinematic
equivalent of a psychiatric ward.</P>
<P>And then there's the money issue, and the idea that not making this
film might have covered food bills for the entire populations of six or
seven third-world countries.  Even though the production design is very
fancy, and even though the special effects have a kind of imposing
realism about them, I couldn't help but feel bad for indulging in a film
as blatantly overpriced as this one.  I mean, we're talking a lot of
bucks here.  Barry Sonnenfeld has created what might go down as the
perfect illustration of a summer blockbuster -- a giant, insane,
two-million-bucks-a-minute extravaganza of tongue-in-cheek nonsense,
starring Will Smith, coming to a theater near you this 4th of July.
