<P>Alejandro Amenábar's new film, The Others, begins with a scream and ends
with the best goosebump-inducing finale since The Sixth Sense.  The shriek
comes from Grace (Nicole Kidman, Moulin Rouge), the mother of two children
living on a giant, fog-shrouded estate on the Isle of Jersey, just off the
coast of England.  The year is 1945, and although World War II has ended,
Grace's husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston, Gone in 60 Seconds) hasn't
returned home, or even sent word regarding his whereabouts.</P>
<P>A missing husband is one thing, but migraine-prone Grace has plenty of other
things to worry about.  Her two kids, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas
(James Bentley), are both allergic to sunlight, and the small group of
servants that used to tend to the house have all mysteriously vanished.
It's no surprise the children make references to a recent nervous breakdown
suffered by their mother.  You try living in a house with no electricity, no
radio and no phone, with sickly kids and each passing day reducing the odds
that your spouse is still alive.</P>
<P>After placing an ad for new help, Grace takes on a group of three servants -
Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan, Waking Ned Devine), Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes)
and the mute Lydia (Elaine Cassidy, Felicia's Journey) - nd instructs them
about the importance of locking every door in the house. "No door is to be
opened before the previous one is closed," Grace tells them, explaining that
the beams of sunlight must be contained to protect her children (like
sunlight could possibly make its way through the thick, choking fog.)</P>
<P>Then the typical horror-movie stuff starts - footsteps, voices and the like.
Anne even swears she's seen other people in the house, but the deeply
religious Grace doesn't believe any of it, pointing an accusatory finger at
Mrs. Mills and her sidekicks, thinking they're trying to run her and her
children out of the mansion.  In a way, The Others is a little like The
Shining, with a family of three trying to contend with complete isolation
and each other.  But, as we learn time and time again, things are never what
they seem in the movies.  There are enough red herrings in The Others to
keep you guessing until the very end.</P>
<P>Mad props must be given to Amenábar (Open Your Eyes), who, in his
English-language debut, serves as writer, director and even provides some
creepy music, to boot (he also scored The Butterfly, which was directed by
Others producer José Luis Cuerda).  Amenábar's manipulation of light (or,
more precisely, the lack thereof) is nothing short of genius, as
demonstrated in the film's opening credits.  He uses the darkness to make
you feel claustrophobic, and with the deliberately slow, tension-building
pace, you begin to grow accustomed to the shadows, just like Grace.  You
don't realize how enveloping it is until a curtain is thrown back, revealing
colors previously blanketed by the gloom.  This is practically a
black-and-white film; it legitimately looks 40 or 50 years old.</P>
<P>Adding to the aged feel of The Others is Kidman, who may give her greatest
performance here (it's easily her best since To Die For).  She's doing her
finest Grace Kelly impression, and she does it wonderfully.  The Others,
which was produced by Kidman's soon-to-be-ex-hubby Tom Cruise (the star of
Cameron Crowe's American adaptation of Amenábar's Open Your Eyes), would
have been the perfect Halloween flick, but, unfortunately, must cut a wide
path around hokey monster movies like the remake of William Castle's 13
Ghosts as well as teen slasher flicks like Jeepers Creepers and the new
Halloween installment.  This isn't the kind of thing you want to see in a
big, heartless chain theatre, where the barely audible whispering on screen
will be lost in the stadium seating and cup holders.  It's an arthouse
summer popcorn flick that will have the misfortune of landing in megaplexes.</P>
<P>1:40 - PG-13 for thematic elements and frightening moments</P>
