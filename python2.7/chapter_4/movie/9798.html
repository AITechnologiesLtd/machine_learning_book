<P>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST- ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS
Featuring the voices of Angela Lansbury and Tim Curry</P>
<P>I was rather surprised when Disney decided to recently release a 
direct-to-video sequel to the animated feature they made in the early 1990's 
called BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The Disney animated features have gone down-hill 
since THE LION KING (1994).  However this direct-to-video release surprised 
me- it is quite good.</P>
<P>The thing that surprised me the most at first was how they kept the animation 
quality to a high standard.  Computer graphics are used in spots, but look 
best when they animate the evil church organ Forte (voiced by Tim Curry, who 
was Dr. Frank N Furter in ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and was the Butler in the 
movie CLUE).  The animation isn't cheap looking, as it was in RETURN TO JAFAR 
for example...  I haven't seen the third ALADDIN sequel yet, so I can't 
comment on its animation.  Anyhow, this movie has great animation quality and 
uses a wide variety of camera shots.</P>
<P>Also the plot is not a  re-hash of the original film.  The plot involves Belle 
wanting to celebrate Christmas, even though she knows from her silverware and 
furniture friends (among which are Mrs. Potts, voiced by Angela Lansbury 
(star in MURDER SHE WROTE tv series, among many other things) that the Beast 
despises the holiday.  Meanwhile the evil organ Forte "helps" the Beast by 
releasing his dark side, sort of like what the Emperor attempts to do to Luke 
Skywalker in RETURN OF THE JEDI (1984).  Tim Curry does a marvelous job as the 
villain.  The script is rather good, with some cheesy lines you would expect 
from a movie like AIRPLANE! (such as the line 'Don't whine glasses...'.  get 
the pun? :) ).</P>
<P>The songs are very good, unlike songs from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and 
HERCULES.  While the animated features I just mentioned contain maybe one song 
I like from each of them, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST- ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS contains 
songs that are at least hummable and enjoyable all throughout.  I noticed the 
person who composed the music and wrote the lyrics was the same person, but 
not the standard Disney Menken/Rice team.  She should move up to doing songs 
for feature films!!  The plot is darker, which I liked.  Watch this film.  It 
has a high production quality while using the same voices from the original 
movie, as well as new ones.  It is a little bit over an hour long, a bit 
short, but still is quite good.  I give BEAUTY AND THE BEAST- ENCHANTED 
CHRISTMAS ***1/2 out of ****.  Little kids might not like the dark aspects to 
it.</P>
