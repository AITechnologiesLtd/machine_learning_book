<P>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  (1998)  118m.</P>
<P>There are always a few posers to consider when reviewing a 
long-in-coming film adaptation of a well-known book.  Should the film be 
judged without reference to its source material?  Should you read the 
book first and then view the film as its visual interpretation?  What 
about reading the book afterwards?  Should you read it at all?  
Shouldn't a film be its own peculiar entity, irrespective of its 
ancestry?</P>
<P>I didn't have a problem with Terry Gilliam's film of Hunter S. 
Thompson's book, but I imagine several others will.  To begin with, it's 
one of those books that are tagged 'unfilmable'.  I was in the fortunate 
position of having read 'Fear and Loathing' several years ago in high 
school, so by the time of the film version I had forgotten nearly 
everything that had happened in the book (so, I suspect, had Thompson).  
But I did remember the overall 'nothingness' of the story, which was 
enough to prepare me for the movie.  The one-sentence plot can be 
summarized thus: Two men go to Las Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs 
and spend the whole trip off their heads.  It's pointless, plotless, and 
indulgent.  It was also the birth of what became known as 'gonzo 
journalism', a sort of stream-of-consciousness reportage where the 
journo drops all pretense of trying to say anything important and 
becomes his own story.</P>
<P>If Hunter's book is gonzo journalism then Gilliam's film is gonzo 
cinema.  It's gleefully self-destructive.  It is Gilliam fastening his 
lance to a Chevrolet convertible and charging at the windmills with his 
foot to the floor.  But where he really nails down the film with one 
solid thwack is the way that everyone involved with the project doesn't 
seem to care about the risk they are taking.  Nothing about it is 
subtle.  The acting and directing are uninhibited to the point of being 
sophomoric.  And nobody is going to apologize.  If FEAR AND LOATHING is 
trying to simulate Thompson's similarly reckless state of mind (as it 
was in 1971) then it has to succeed on that score at least.  It 
recreates the sensation that many of its prospective audience will 
undoubtedly relate to - that when you're stoned anything and everything 
can be funny.  The opening five minutes is hysterical, but it's another 
thing to keep repeating those five minutes ad nauseum to the same 
effect.  Gilliam tries to make it as attractive as possible 
nevertheless, at least to cinema-goers, and those most interested in 
FEAR AND LOATHING will be the ones going to see its heightened pop 
colors, drunken angles, and crystal-clear depth of field on the big 
screen.  Those who are less interested will grab it off the video shelf 
and sit through forty minutes before hitting the fast-forward button.  
This film isn't made for video.  It is not meant to be controlled by the 
viewer.  It's a film that controls the viewer.  It wants to be the rush, 
and you the user.  It's what I like most about Gilliam's project; 
there's an admirable folly in making a big-budget film supposedly for 
mainstream audiences and then telling them that they're going to have to 
learn to watch films differently if we ever want to get out of the 
Hollywood rut.  David Cronenberg has been pushing this element into 
commercial cinema for years now.  When he or Gilliam get around to 
making something out of a Thomas Pynchon novel, I know we'll have 
arrived.</P>
<P>And in the middle of this paranoid, hallucinogenic buzz sits Johnny 
Depp, adding to his collection of oddball characters, who is left to 
provide some sort of anchor to all the disorganization around him.  
Except Depp is just as flaky as everything else in the film, so even 
that idea gets torpedoed.  If you hate Depp's bewildered performance - 
like Groucho Marx after shock treatment - then you'll be one of the 
people that walks out early, something I'm confident happens in nearly 
every screening this film has.  Maybe they didn't read the book.  Or 
maybe they did.  Or maybe they just wanted to perpetuate the concept of 
gonzo-filmgoing by buying tickets for a movie they didn't want to watch. </P>
