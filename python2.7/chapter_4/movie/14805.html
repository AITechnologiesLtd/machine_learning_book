<P>The intent of the much anticipated "Beloved" is for viewers to leave the 
theater mesmerized, reflecting on the horror of slavery and its 
nightmarish aftereffects on the human soul. Jonathan Demme's film version 
of the Pulitzer Prize winning Toni Morrison novel achieves those goals to 
a degree, but the effect is somewhat muted by static central characters, 
several notable stylistic and structural problems and the production's 
often glacial pacing. It's been said that truly great films never feel 
too long. At two hours and fifty two minutes, "Beloved" does.</P>
<P>Like many classic chamber dramas, the film is presented "onion-style." 
Following the introduction of the central characters, layer after layer 
of the onion is peeled away, gradually revealing the emotional core of 
the characters. This is a ghost story, both figuratively and literally, 
and Demme opens the film with a lengthy, effective set-up. In 1873, 
former slave Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) and her daughter Denver (Kimberly 
Elise) live a reclusive existence inside a rural home near Cincinnati. 
The house is haunted and the rest of the family has abandoned Sethe long 
ago, yet she refuses to leave. Demme presents the haunting graphically 
with images that echo "Poltergeist"; floorboards and tables rattle, 
objects fly through the air, a dog's eye pops out of its socket. </P>
<P>Enter Paul D (Danny Glover), who knew Sethe when they were both slaves in 
Kentucky. He encounters the spirit, believed by the women to be the ghost 
of one of Sethe's children, and his strength of will appears to subdue 
the presence. Paul D moves into the house after becoming Sethe's lover 
and, for a brief period, it appears that the three might be able to forge 
a traditional family life. That all changes when Sethe and Denver return 
from a carnival and encounter Beloved (Thandie Newton).</P>
<P>We first see the wild child as she raises from a swampy muck, covered 
with insects, and drags herself to Sethe's front yard. The women take in 
the exhausted near-mute, restoring her to health and attempting to teach 
the drooling, growling creature how to be a proper young adult. While 
Sethe and Denver embrace Beloved, Paul D remains leery, suspecting 
there's more to this feral adolescent than meets the eye. He's right. </P>
<P>Between Sethe's encounters with Beloved and a series of flashbacks, the 
onion layers begin to peel away. We learn about Sethe's past; the 
horrific treatment she endured as a slave, how she received the criss-
crossed ''tree'' of scars on her back, her delivery of a child while 
traversing the river to Ohio following her escape from Kentucky. We also 
witness the night where, in a desperate attempt to spare her children 
from a life of slavery, Sethe made a decision that hurled her into a 
perpetual nightmare.</P>
<P>''Silence of the Lambs'' director Jonathan Demme employs color 
manipulation, a variety of unusual camera movements and extreme close-ups 
for the powerful imagery required by ''Beloved.'' Sometimes it works, but 
often it does not. It's hard to appreciate a simple front porch 
conversation when Demme's camera is either swooping around the yard or 
flipping between full-screen face shots of whichever character is 
speaking. And while some of the shocking scenes, like Beloved's initial 
appearance, are appropriate, did we really need a close-up of Sethe 
squatting and unleashing a massive stream of urine? </P>
<P>1873 Cincinnati is beautifully realized, and a carnival scene is both 
charming and wonderfully detailed, but most of the film takes place in 
Sethe's dilapidated home. The flashback sequences are effective, but we 
don't get enough of them, resulting in a portrayal of Sethe's past that 
is unnecessarily sketchy. Demme's insistence on keeping his camera 
focused on Oprah Winfrey, who optioned the book and brought it to the 
screen, eventually gives the film the vague whiff of a vanity project.</P>
<P>''Beloved'' features many exceptional supporting performances, 
particularly from Beah Richards as Denver's grandmother, home-spun 
preacher Baby Suggs. Winfrey and Glover do fine, nuanced work, although 
the static nature of their characters limits their range. Kimberly Elise, 
on the other hand, is allowed to grow and change as young Denver 
graduates from childhood naïveté to become a self-realized woman. Elise 
shines in the role.</P>
<P>The film's most striking performance comes from Thandie Newton as Beloved.
 The lovely actor disappears completely into the part, and is 
appropriately frightening and tragic at first, but as the film drags on, 
her limp-headed, jerky characterization becomes cartoonish, reminding me 
of Gilda Radner's dim-witted rag doll character from the old ''Saturday 
Night Live.'' </P>
<P>By the time ''Beloved'' finally reaches its conclusion, Demme's 
directorial excesses leave the viewer more exhausted than enlightened. 
Faithful to a fault to the source novel, ''Beloved'' suffers from too 
much exposition without enough details, too many camera games, too few 
flashbacks, too little pay-off at the end and too much Oprah. Within 
''Beloved'' lies a great movie with a powerful message, but its impact is 
muffled due to the filmmakers' indulgence and lack of restraint.</P>
