<PRE>AUSTIN POWERS:  THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  **1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>When AUSTIN POWERS:  INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY made its debut in
1997, it was an idea whose time had come.  Mixing dead-on spoof with
hilarious conventional comedy, the film was a continuous, unrelenting
laugh-fest that poked fun at the 1960's secret agent movie genre.
It's sequel, AUSTIN POWERS:  THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, attempts to carry
on in the same tradition, but unfortunately fails to entertain as well
as it's predecessor.</P>
<P>Mike Myers returns as British super spy Austin Powers, frozen in the
60's and thawed out in the 90's to combat his arch nemesis Dr. Evil
(also played by Myers).  At the end of the previous film, Dr. Evil
escaped capture by sending himself into space in a giant Bob's Big Boy
statue.  The beginning of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME features the evil Dr.
Evil returning from the cold reaches of Earth orbit, bent upon
destroying Austin Powers by traveling back in time to 1967, when
Powers was still frozen, and stealing the life force that makes him a
successful international operative:  His "mojo."  Dr. Evil is
convinced that once the constantly randy Powers is robbed of his
libido, his ability to thwart the plans of the world's dark forces
will be sapped for good (or bad, as the case may be).  Powers must
therefore pursue Dr. Evil into the past in order to save the world and
his ability to shag.</P>
<P>As I mentioned earlier, THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME attempts to capitalize
upon what worked so well for the first film.  This means there is
still a lot of parody of movies like DR. NO and OUR MAN FLINT, and
even the Patrick Magoohan television series "The Prisoner."  In many
cases, this works very effectively, such as when Dr. Evil builds his
secret hideout in the middle of an active volcano on a secluded
island, or whenever Powers gets into an automobile and the background
immediately looks like pre-filmed scenery.  However, many of the jokes
we get in THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME are also just retreads from the last
film without sufficiently new angles to make them as funny the second
time around, such as when one of Dr. Evil's henchmen just won't die,
or when Powers goes romping naked through a hotel lobby.  Both jokes
were brilliantly executed in 1997, but this time they are by nature
less inspired and fall relatively flat.</P>
<P>Undeveloped jokes are actually a serious problem in this film, a
result of screenwriting lapses and poor directorial choices.  For
example, the Evil empire invested heavily in Starbucks, and now the
Evil headquarters is located in the Seattle Space Needle.  As Dr.
Evil's right hand man Number Two (Robert Wagner) explains, it was a
great investment because Starbucks offers "premium coffee at
affordable prices."  The utter ridiculousness of this proposition,
along with the plausibility of the empire association (Amazon.com
could have been another good choice), presents many opportunities for
further comedic exploitation throughout the film.  Picture Frappucino
machines lifting themselves off of their mounts and walking down the
street wreaking havoc.  It's too bad the possibilities weren't pursued
further.  Additionally, there are instances where a character will say
something which seems to be a lead into a punchline, but the dialog
immediately moves on to something else, leaving the audience hanging
and confused.  A good director would have recognized this and
rectified the situation on the set or in the editing room.</P>
<P>The saving grace for this movie is that when the jokes do hit the
mark, they hit solidly.  Most of the time, the Dr. Evil character
steals the show, but one of Dr. Evil's henchmen, Fat Bastard (also
played by Myers) may be the most outrageous.  Drooling and inflated
with the notion that he's a sexy man, he also once ate a baby.  Myers
has played over-the-top Scotsmen on Saturday Night Live and in SO I
MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER, and Fat Bastard seems to be the next logical
step in the progression.</P>
<P>The other actors in the film are pretty much window dressing, although
they do what they can.  Robert Wagner only has a small role as Number
Two before the film moves to 1969, and a younger Number Two is played
by Rob Lowe, who does a great Wagner impression.  Seth Green as Dr.
Evil's son, Scott Evil, is under-used and has a lot less screen time
than he did in the last movie.  Mindy Sterling returns as henchwoman
Frau Farbissina, and Elizabeth Hurley has a short performance as
Secret Service agent Vanessa Kensington.  Powers' new love interest
and action partner is portrayed by Heather Graham as CIA agent
Felicity Shagwell, but she doesn't live up to the better performance
by Hurley the last film.  I realize THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is a
comedy, but Graham just doesn't hold up in the scenes which require
more than a pretty face.  Disappointing, considering her wonderful
acting in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and I have a feeling the direction had more
to do with this than anything else.</P>
<P>One of the new characters in this film is a one-eighth sized clone of
Dr. Evil, which he dubs Mini Me (Verne Troyer).  I was impressed by
the fact that the film got a lot of mileage out of this diminutive
character who has no spoken lines, but actually helps the plot along
in addition to providing a lot of laughs.  In the end, however, Mini
Me is somewhat of a metaphor for this follow up to AUSTIN POWERS:
INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.  It comes from the same stock as the
original, but it's a lot less.</P>
