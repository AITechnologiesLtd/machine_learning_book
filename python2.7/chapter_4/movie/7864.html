<PRE>                        MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>The story, an original screenplay by Ronald Bass, is plausible
enough;  the acting by the principals in this romantic farce is so
good the film does not appear to be contrived.   Julianne (Julia
Roberts at her best) split with her lover Michael (Dermot Mulroney,
handsome and sincere) some nine years ago but remained "best
friends" . . . something I have never been able to believe likely in
relationships.  Once you are lovers, you cannot go back to being
just "friends."   At least in my non-professional opinion.</P>
<P>That is not the point, though, is it?   In this film, that is what
happened, at least in the beginning.   Now, Julia hears that Michael
has found himself someone he loves, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) and that he
is about to get married. Julia,  very disturbed by that news because suddenly in danger of losing him she realizes she is still in love with him.    What is a girl to do but fly to Chicago,    a few days before the wedding,  to the scheduled nuptials and
UNschedule it. No doubt in Julia's mind that turning on some of her
seductiveness which never before has failed her will make Michael
realize what he will be missing if he were to marry this new person.</P>
<P>Arriving in the city she gets in touch with Michael, ready to turn
on all her charm.  He introduces her to Kimmy . . . and Julia is
quickly made aware that this will not be as easy as she thought.
Kimmy is very pretty, very warm and friendly, and educated.  Only
some dirty work by Julia can possibly derail the impending marriage.
It is at this point the film begins to lose some of its impetus and
believability.    it also becomes pretty obvious whom Michael will
end up marrying.</P>
<P>Supporting actors include Rupert Everett, Philip Bosco, Rachel
Griffiths, M Emmet Walsh, Carrie Preston and Susan Sullivan.</P>
