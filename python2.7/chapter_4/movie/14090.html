<PRE>                        THE OPPOSITE OF SEX 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    1 :-) for the opposite of no sex</PRE>
<P>Cast: Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Lyle Lovett, Ivan
Sergei, Johnny Galecki
Director: Don Roos
Producers: Michael Besman, David Kirkpatrick
Screenplay: Don Roos</P>
<P>What is the opposite of sex, no sex? The truth is this movie is filled
with sexual issues, and no one's getting more action than a 16 y.o.
delinquent, Dedee Truit (Christina Ricci). This girl is voracious and
not easily satisfied. She manages to seduce Bill's (her half-brother)
young, hunky, gay lover, Matt (Ivan Sergei). This must be a play on some
woman's fantasy about accomplishing the seemingly impossible feat –
unless they were bisexual to begin with. Ricci's Dedee, is brash, bold
and very in your face. A tart if you must label her and showing the
characteristic signs of a vamp. Sad to see one so young and able, so
very wasted on wantonness.</P>
<P>In contrast, Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) the sister of Bill's (Martin Donovan)
dead lover is the exact opposite of everything Dedee stands for. Lucia
is cold, prim and proper and hasn't had any sex at all. A pen-ultimate
virgin if you must label her something and very bitter. Her charming
younger brother landed the man she had always wanted – Bill, and then
died of AIDS. This is a unique performance from Lisa Kudrow, that is a
welcome breath of fresh air from her usual, ditzy FRIENDS persona.</P>
<P>In general this movie is all about sex, the ins and outs, the good the
bad and different sorts. There's promiscuous teen sex, a middle aged gay
man seeking companionship and a stable relationship, the younger gay man
that is swept away with having a good time and good looks. A very
lonely, middle-aged, single woman that is always looking and never
getting any. The police officer (Lyle Lovett) with a sick wife, that
isn't getting any either. Teen pregnancy, murder, fraud, theft,
blackmail and what you have for yourself is something of a PULP FICTION,
where the adrenaline has been switched with sex hormones.</P>
