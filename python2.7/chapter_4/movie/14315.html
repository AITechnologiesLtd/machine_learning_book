<P>John Dahl crafts a poker tale based on a script by first time writers
David Levien and Brian Kopelman. Dahl has previously managed to create
three moody mystery films, including one of my all-time favourites, RED
ROCK WEST (8/10), along with THE LAST SEDUCTION (7.5/10) and
UNFORGETTABLE (7/10).</P>
<P>PLOT:
Poker junkie Mike (Damon) finally goes straight after losing $30,000 in
a life-changing poker match. Soon thereafter, he concentrates on law
school with his straight-as-an-arrow girlfriend, and tries to avoid all
card-game temptations. That is, until his good friend Worm (Norton)
gets out of prison, runs into some major gambling debts, and morally
challenges Mike into returning to his good old days of "rounding".</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Entertaining, believable, if slightly repetitive, behind the scenes
look at the high-stakes game of New York underground poker through the
eyes of one fresh-faced kid with a dream (surprise, it's Matt Damon!),
and his brother-like friend, Worm, whose integrity for the game is
essentially non-existent. This movie was never boring for me, was
filmed in just the right amount of time, and did maintain an extreme
air of authenticity throughout. Then again, I'm no card shark, so I
would have no idea if even half the jargon used in the film was real
anyway ("We might have to raise the juice on those rounders". Huh?)</P>
<P>The acting was uneven with Norton delivering another great performance
with his sleazy rendition of the morally-bankrupt Worm, while Damon,
well, played Matt Damon pretty well. John Turtorro's character seemed
highly underdeveloped (seems like some scenes with him might've been
cut out), as well as Gretchen Mol's standard girlfriend repartee (no
"Standing by your man" for this woman!), which didn't add much to the
story. John Malkovich also went over the top and came back, with his
highly carucaturized rendition of a Russian card player. The mood and
soundtrack of the film was nicely set by Dahl, while the obligatory
girlfriend sub-plot line just reminded me of the sour romance plot-line
in DONNIE BRASCO (8/10) from 1997 (in which Gretchen Mol also appeared
as Sonny's (Michael Madsen) girlfriend.)</P>
<P>Having said that, the film did manage to show us everything you ever
wanted to know about the game of poker and more (I don't remember
seeing a better poker movie in my life, but then again, I don't
remember seeing many poker movies in my life.), and a greater insight
into the mind of an addict (Any type of addict, if you really think
about it.) and the price one could pay for extreme loyalty. I would
recommend this film to all those who love the game of poker, and are
interested in exploring the life themes of addiction and loyalty. Other
than that, the film offers little else in the romance and/or suspense
factors, so if that's what you're interested in, forget this puppy and
go rent yourself another great Dahl movie: THE LAST SEDUCTION with an
Oscar-worthy performance by Linda Fiorentino as the cold, manipulative
sex-pot with a plan. Either way, you're going to have an interesting
evening.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Matt Damon's full name is Matthew Paige Damon. Matt's first film role
was a one-line part in 1988's MYSTIC PIZZA. Matt co-wrote the
screenplay for 1997's GOOD WILL HUNTING (7.5/10) with best friend,
buddy-boy Ben Affleck, for which the duo received an Academy Award for
Best Original Screenplay. Matt dropped 40 pounds for his role in
COURAGE UNDER FIRE, and received the sum of US$600,000 for his role in
ROUNDERS.
Screenwriter Koppelman came up with the idea for the script when he
heard about a friend of a friend who made more money as a "rounder" - a
poker hustler - than from his day job on Wall Street. He met the guy on
a street corner in Manhattan, they went down to one of the clubs, where
Koppelman, a former artist-and-repertoire scout for a record company,
was immediately hooked by the exotic environment. When he got home at
2:30 in the morning, he called old friend Levien and told him about
this great movie idea. Hence, the screenplay to ROUNDERS.
Both stars Damon and Norton are born in the state of Massachusetts, and
attended Ivy League colleges (Harvard for Damon, Yale for Norton.)
Director John Dahl co-wrote the screenplay to RED ROCK WEST with his
brother Rick Dahl. </P>
