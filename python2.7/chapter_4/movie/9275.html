                            L.A. CONFIDENTIAL
                      A film review by Andrew Hicks
                       Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) **** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        As of today, October 6, 1997, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is the 
best film I've seen in a theater this year. By far. I've gotten so used to 
formula hash like EXCESS BAGGAGE and SPEED 2 that when an 
intelligent, suspenseful, absorbing action drama like this comes along, 
I feel privileged. So often when I take the time and money to go to a 
theater, I lose IQ points on the drivel that is tossed at me. That's not to 
say there isn't highly entertaining drivel out there; it's just much better 
to see something original and unpredictable that makes you think but 
never bores you.</P>
<P>        L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, a noirish film adapted from the James 
Ellroy novel, is one of those movies it seems impossible not to like. 
>From its very opening, it sucks you in and never cuts corners. Set in 
the 1950s, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL paints a portrait of a corrupt police 
department (nice to know LAPD has been corrupt for _decades_, isn't 
it?) whose sense of brotherhood and greed overrides any real sense of 
justice, although all the lies and evidence planting are done in the 
name of justice. The police captain (James Cromwell) explains this to 
an ambitious sergeant (Guy Pearce) just before he is faced with the 
decision of whether to rat on some of his fellow officers.</P>
<P>        On Christmas Eve, a few Mexican immigrants are hauled into 
the station. Some officers, buzzing from the spiked eggnog, decide to 
whip the hell out of them. (This always occurs on the eleventh day of 
Christmas, by the way.) Pearce is the only objector and the only one 
willing to testify, the only officer in the entire precinct who wants to be 
an honest cop. Russell Crowe plays his polar opposite, an all-muscle-
and-no-brain cop who loves to administer brutal justice to wife beaters. 
Crowe turns down Cromwell's request to testify against his partner, 
who is to be used as the fall guy for the Yuletide Immigrant Bashing 
party.</P>
<P>        The partner gets suspended, then he gets killed. Bad day. 
Pearce gets to the scene of the crime first and is put on the 
investigation, while Crowe begins to orchestrate an extracurricular 
revenge investigation. Pearce arrests three black men who were seen in 
the area with the guns, but it's obvious the case doesn't end there (and, 
again, it's nice to know LAPD has framed black men for _decades_). 
It involves a few of the movie's colorful non-police characters.</P>
<P>        There's a millionaire (David Strathairn) who makes some of 
his profit pimping hookers who have been surgically altered to 
resemble Hollywood starlets. Kim Basinger plays the Veronica Lake 
look-alike (the Lake-alike, you might call her) whom Crowe falls for, 
and Danny DeVito takes his weasel persona to new heights as the 
publisher of Hush-Hush, a rag that prints lurid crime stories. DeVito 
is tipped off to these crime exclusives by one of the officers (Kevin 
Spacey).</P>
<P>        To reveal anything more would spoil some of the fun, since 
at least half of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL's appeal lies in the intricacies of 
the crime story. The direction, from Curtis Hanson (taking a break 
from his "MMMBop" world tour), is stylish and colorful, in grand '50s 
style, and the acting is wonderful from all sides. The people you know 
will be great -- Spacey, Basinger, DeVito -- are, but the movie belongs 
to the two complicated cops, played by Pearce and Russell. I loved 
everything about this movie.</P>
