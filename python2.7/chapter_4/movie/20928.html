<P>Wars simply don't make godly sense. Hype and political propaganda aside,
the Persian Gulf war was no exception.  THREE KINGS, in using Operation
Desert Storm as its setting, pulls no punches when depicting the
confusion, political duplicity, and moral dilemmas engendered by that
conflict.</P>
<P>Writer/director David O. Russell (FLIRTING WITH DISASTER) researched
heavily before embarking upon this project and his preliminary efforts
have paid off handsomely.  He has crafted the most irreverent war story
since M*A*S*H hit the silver screen in the 1970's.  The opening scene also
had definite traces of CATCH-22 influence.</P>
<P>Archie Gates (George Clooney, OUT OF SIGHT) is a Special Forces captain
who has been relegated to the sidelines during this high tech,
computerized engagement.  His current assignment involves nothing more
than baby-sitting the media faces who are swarming the area looking for
stories, all of which have long been done and overdone.</P>
<P>With the discovery of a map secreted in a captured Iraqi soldier's anal
cavity, (said hiding place serving as the butt for many a joke), Archie
gives himself a new "assignment."   The map indicates the position of
Iraqi bunkers where it is rumored Sadaam Hussein has hidden an obscene
amount of gold bullion stolen from Kuwait.</P>
<P>With the war now over, Archie and a small band of American GI's decide to
liberate the gold from Sadaam's forces.  Of course, their intentions are
purely self-serving.  But as they travel deeper into Iraq to collect their
spoils of war, they begin to witness firsthand what American policy has
done for and to the people of Iraq.</P>
<P>The film slowly takes a serious turn, pointing an accusative finger at
the Bush Administration which was allegedly responsible for the lies and
false hopes that were fed to the Iraqi people.  Encouraged to rise up
against Sadaam Hussein with promised support from the American government,
the Iraqi people were left "twisting in the wind" as Sadaam's army
brutally put down the internal rebellion with no interference from the US
forces who stood idly by.  Seeing this, Archie and the others are forced
to question their own principles and character.</P>
<P>Mr. Russell continues to shift the story from seriously comic to
comically serious, the emphasis changing as frequently as the political
winds of favor.</P>
<P>Mr. Clooney again displays the sardonic humor we've seen from him in the
past.  His Archie is a grizzled combat veteran who doesn't have the
faintest idea why he is in the midst of a barren and desolate desert with
a bunch of know-nothing volunteer reservists, but as long as he is, he
figures he might as well profit from the experience.</P>
<P>Mark Wahlberg (BOOGIE NIGHTS) is surprisingly effective as Sgt. Troy
Barlow, new father and genuinely decent guy.  In perhaps the most riveting
sequence, Troy is tortuously interrogated by an Iraqi soldier.  During the
experience they learn how closely their lives parallel.</P>
<P>The film has a distinctive stylized look about it.  Alternating between a
realistic look, a bleached-out, "shaky-cam" documentary look, and a
jazzed-up, special FX look, the visual style of THREE KINGS is just
disconcerting enough to keep us on edge.</P>
<P>The film does include some scenes of which the easily squeamish should be
aware.  After all, this is a war setting.  In war, bullets are fired.
This movie, more than most, shows in graphic detail the devastating damage
a bullet can do to a human body.</P>
<P>The salient point of the movie is that even in the midst of a devilish,
hellish environment, it is available to maintain one's morality and
compassion.  As individuals, we always have a choice.  As believers, our
view of right or wrong is based upon a standard that is unmovable.  As we
commit ourselves to the upholding of that standard, our actions and
decisions will reflect the goodness of the One Who created it.</P>
<P>Archie claims that the most important thing in life is necessity.  That
is only true if we define "need" properly.  The greatest need that any of
us have is a knowledge of truth.  Armed with a knowledge of truth and the
conviction to act upon that truth, our decisions become sound and our
lives have impact and meaning.</P>
