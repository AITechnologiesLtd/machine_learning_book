<P>   The song that permeates the sound track of this
groundbreaking film goes "Gonna find my happiness,/ Gonna
find my happiness/ ...Happiness where are you,/ You just
can't stay so far away."  Ask ten people what they want most
in life.  Nine out of ten won't say "a million dollars," "a trip
around the world," "a Beamer" or even "a great job." 
"Happiness" is, and always will be, the ultimate reward, a
concept that eludes perhaps most people whether rich or
poor, with a distinguished career or a menial task to perform. 
Todd Solondz's innovative film "Welcome to the Doll House"
hit the screens in 1996 and dealt with the pain of puberty
unflinchingly portrayed by a suburban family. Now the writer-
director has taken away the International Critic's Prize at the
1998 Cannes Film Festival and also the Metro Media Award
at the 1998 Toronto Festival with his two-and one-half million
dollar production, "Happiness."  Inspired by a tabloid story of
a Russian serial killer of children who surprisingly enough had
a stable marriage and a couple of kids, the story intertwines
vignettes from the lives of the members of a New Jersey
family as they interact with one another, their friends, and
their neighbors.  When the parent company of October Films
denied the once independent house permission to release the
film, the job was taken up by Good Machine, whose superb
rendering of a tale that balances humor with pathos is a
winner in every respect.</P>
<P>   Director Solondz capably ignores the usual code of
moviemaking, which mandates that dialogue move
unhesitatingly forward lest the audience become distracted by
uncomfortable periods of silence.  With clever colloquy
featuring pauses that would put a big smile on Harold Pinter's
face, Solondz cuts his narrative into slices of life often flat-out
hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time, skillfully
weaving the yarn into a gloriously textured fabric.</P>
<P>   The transcendent opening of the film is the short version of
what is meant by combining comedy with commiseration as
thirty-year-old Joy Jordan is on a date with the nerdy,
unattractive, inarticulate Andy Kornbluth (Jon Lovitz).  Their
conversation is hesitant, more like discharges of energy
followed by discomfiting intervals, as Andy presents an
expensive ash tray to his date, then abruptly and fiercely
takes it back explaining in no uncertain terms why Joy does
not deserve either the valuable trinket or him.  Joy's almost
comic bemusement and Andy sudden, unpredictable
savagery will serve as a model for the balance of the film.</P>
<P>   Mr. Solondz comes back from time to time to pick up on
Joy's love life, highlighting an amusing chance meeting she
has with a Russian student at a school for refugees and
selects others in the family in haphazard order to hone in on 
how they deal with their fundamental aloneness.  As head of
household Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker) responds when one
member of his family complains of loneliness, "We are all
alone."  Surprisingly, perhaps, the ways we deal with this
existential fact has both comic and pitiful resonance: each
person in turn finds occasional moments of joy followed by
periods of dismal melancholy in dealing with the malady.</P>
<P>   While it would be difficult to choose which pairs of
relationships are most moving--that's how together this film
really is--those involving Dr. Bill Maplewood and his son, and
Allen's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) links to his neighbor
Kristina (Camryn Manheim) are most trenchant.  Allen is an
overweight, unhappy, 30-something fellow who acts hale-
fellow on the job but turns into a debauched creature in his
time off.  He combs the phone book at random for women
with whom he can have phone sex.  When he inadvertently
buzzes his next-door neighbor Helen Jordan (Lara Flynn
Boyle), he is surprised to hear her invite him to her place
where, of course, he is utterly unable to connect.  But he
does enjoy a momentary alliance with a homely neighbor,
Kristina, who seeks him out and, gaining his trust, relates a
bizarre story of rape and murder.  </P>
<P>   As a performer, Mr. Hoffman stands out as the comic hub
of the story, but it is Dylan Baker who, as Dr. Bill Maplewood,
proffers the most surprises.  Bill is an apparently successful
professional man who supplies his wife Trish (Cynthia
Stevenson) with a comfortable, bourgeois suburban home
with two lovely boys and a dog.  His love for eleven-year-old
Billy (Rufus Read) is touching.  He's the sort of dad we all
wish we'd had, one who listens attentively and honestly and
matter-of-factly answers the most amusing birds-and-the-bees
questions which the lad trusts him to resolve.  Billy is
envious: every boy in his class is able to "come" so, he asks
innocently and wide-eyed, "Why can't I?"  "Don't worry, you
will," replies the good doctor as though he were counseling
his son on how to dribble a ball down the court.  The coming
shock is foreshadowed as Dr. Maplewood relates a dream to
HIS psychiatrist, one in which he marches down a hilly plot
with an automatic weapon mowing down every man, women,
and child in sight.  (Perhaps it's true what they say about
shrinks; that they're all crazy...after all, why would someone
become interested in the profession in the first place?)</P>
<P>   That much can be absorbed by an audience.  But what
horrifies us is how this gentle, apparently stable and
successful professional man becomes attracted to his son's
11-year-old sleepover classmate, drugs him, and brutally
rapes the boy while he is sleeping.  This boggles the mind
and has made the film a cause celebre.  </P>
<P>   In a press conference following a critics' screening at the
NY Film Festival, Todd Solondz fields questions.  "Why,"
asks one member of the audience, "do you make Kristina a
killer?"  Replies the director, "It's easy to make someone
likable.  What I wanted to do is to show people whom you'd
want to embrace even with all their foibles.  You're still able
to embrace such a person. This makes a richer character."  </P>
<P>   "Happiness," a movie whose budget remained low because
Solondz refused to compromise and cast bankable actors, is
a richer movie.  No one could have done a more capable job
than Dylan Baker in portraying a father, a professional man,
who despite his broad knowledge of how the mind is
nonetheless unable to control his depraved passion for young
boys.  Solondz has splashed the screen with an array of
persons, each with a distinct makeup, all feeling alone and
organizing his or her life in an effort to dispel the feeling of
utter isolation.  When Oscar time rolls around, "Happiness"
may well be swallowed up by "Saving Private Ryan"--which
makes us regret that a separate Academy award is not
offered for the best film of each genre.  For the oxymoronic
category of comedy-tragedy, "Happiness" would walk away
with the gold.</P>
