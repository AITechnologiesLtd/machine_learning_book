<P>     Call CAMERA BUFF a case of art imitating life.  Although director 
Krzysztof Kieslowski admitted that this film doesn't tell his own story 
("I made films because that was my profession, and I was too lazy or too 
stupid or both to change..."), it will undoubtedly strike a responsive 
chord with many amateur and professional film makers.  Yet, while the 
movie is about the love of a craft, this isn't a nostalgia-drenched 
account of that appreciation.  Kieslowski developed CAMERA BUFF's 
deceptively complex script so that it addressed weightier themes:  
obsession, censorship, and the battle between artistic integrity and 
personal sacrifice.</P>
<P>     Before making CAMERA BUFF in 1979, Kieslowski was an unknown 
outside of his native Poland.  And, although he had been making movies 
since 1966, the Lodz Film School graduate had only released one 
previous, full-length theatrical feature (THE SCAR).  CAMERA BUFF, which 
exposed Kieslowski to the world, changed the man's artistic direction.  
After this, his attention was increasingly focused on fictional films, 
as opposed to the documentaries for which he was (at the time) better 
recognized. CAMERA BUFF was the movie that set Kieslowski's feet on the 
path that would eventually lead to NO END (1984), DECALOGUE (1988), and 
the three colors of BLUE, WHITE, and RED (1993-4).</P>
<P>     Fans of Kieslowski's later style (which began to emerge in NO END) 
may find CAMERA BUFF's light, occasionally playful tone disconcerting.  
Although the film deals with serious themes, Kieslowski never allows the 
proceedings to grow maudlin or overly-introspective.  The script is 
peppered with serio-comic incidents that leaven what could have been a 
staid, sober story.  Nevertheless, the manner in which the plot unfolds 
and the interconnected issues are confronted announces CAMERA BUFF as a 
picture of considerable substance.</P>
<P>     The main character, Filip Mosz, is played by Jerzy Stuhr, an actor 
whose collaboration with Kieslowski lasted for more than twenty years, 
from THE SCAR to WHITE.  In anticipation of his new baby's birth, Filip 
spends two months' pay on an 8 mm camera to record of his child's first 
few years.  But, from the moment he looks through the lens, Filip is 
hooked.  He begins filming almost anything that moves, including family, 
friends, neighbors, and strangers.  His boss at the factory (Stefan 
Czyzewski) appoints Filip as the establishment's official chronicler.  
At first, the manager is pleased with the films, and, with the exception 
of a few editorial "suggestions", he allows Filip to proceed as he sees 
best.  But, when the films begin to attract attention, winning amateur 
prizes and appearing on TV shows, the manager attempts to restrict 
Filip's work.  Heedless of the personal cost (his wife leaves him) and 
risking his job, Filip pushes forward, only to stumble into a trap set 
for him by the factory's management.  In the end, he faces a painful 
choice:  destroy his own work or allow it to be used for a purpose he 
cannot condone.</P>
<P>     All the dilemmas in CAMERA BUFF center on Filip.  He becomes so 
obsessed with film making that he neglects his family, eventually losing 
not only his wife, but his young daughter and unborn child.  When his 
wife demands to know why he's ruining his life, just when he has 
everything he wants, he replies, "I need more than peace and quiet.  
[Shooting films means] more than a home and family."  But facing an 
empty apartment at night isn't the most painful consequence of Filip's 
newfound passion.  He also confronts censorship when his manager demands 
that scenes be edited out to make a film more complimentary to the 
factory.  Eventually, when his employers attempt to suppress an entire 
movie and determine the content of another, Filip faces a crisis of 
conscience.  Why does he make films?  And do they mean anything if they 
are reduced to propaganda pieces instead of genuine depictions of the 
world as he sees it?  When his immediate boss is fired because of a 
film's content, Filip finally sees how serious his "harmless" hobby has 
become.</P>
<P>     This all sounds rather grim, but, perhaps surprisingly, CAMERA BUFF 
may be the funniest of Kieslowski's features (although both DECALOGUE 10 
and WHITE have their moments).  None of the humor is excessive or 
intrusive, but there are moments of the absurd that maintain a relaxed 
tone, and Filip's enthusiasm is infectious.  Kieslowski isn't attempting 
to bludgeon us with preachy morality lessons; his intent is to explore 
certain issues in an entertaining manner.  And, while CAMERA BUFF lacks 
some of the artistry evident in the director's later projects, it's 
worth seeing not only as an example of Kieslowski's early work, but as 
an important film in its own right.</P>
