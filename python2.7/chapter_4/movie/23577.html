Grade:  C+</PRE>
<P>Welcome to the tiny hamlet of Verplank, NY, where everyone drives a Yugo with
vanity plates.  (If you drove a Yugo, would you want to advertise the fact?) 
The most hated woman in town, Mona Dearly (Bette Midler), just took a fatal
plunge into the lake.  The cause:  cut brake lines.  Suspects?  There's her
husband Phil (William Fichtner) who's having an affair with waitress Rona Mace
(Jamie Lee Curtis).  Or her dimwitted son Jeff (or Jeph, it's spelled one way
on his vanity plates and another on his key chain) (Marcus Thomas) who lost his
right hand to Mona's anger.  How about Jeff's partner Bobby Calzone (Casey
Affleck)?  Jeff and Mona were destroying his landscaping business.  Don't
forget Bobby's fiancee Ellen Rash (Neve Campbell); if Bobby's business sinks,
so does her future.  Sorting it all out is Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny
DeVito), Ellen's father.</P>
<P>That seems like a promising set-up for a murder mystery, but the clues are
painfully obvious to interpret.  However, the inscrutable Chief Rash seems slow
to see the connections.  Screenwriter Peter Steinfeld rejects suspense in his
quest for quirky humor.  Sometimes he hits the target, more often he misses. 
Steinfeld also sacrifices the believability of characters.  He seems to plot
the movie by asking at each juncture "What's the goofiest plot twist I can
throw in here?" rather than "What would this character do here?"</P>
<P>The cast works hard to make the deliberately odd script work.  Neve Campbell
was especially good.  She seems to have been invigorated by being a character
actor rather than the lead.  William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas are funny as
the survivors of the dysfunctional Dearly family.  In the numerous flashbacks,
Bette Midler plays a bitch-on-wheels with verve.  The weak link is Casey
Affleck, whose character is more or less the protagonist in this ensemble.  I
couldn't decide whether Affleck was a really bad actor or just giving a good
performance as the timid and awkward Bobby.  Either way he was painful to
watch, and I kept hoping he'd drown.</P>
<P>Bottom line:  "Drowning Mona" really wants to be "Fargo," but it never comes
close.  However, despite the one glaring exception, the stellar cast makes a
superb effort and manages to wring some laughs out of it.</P>
