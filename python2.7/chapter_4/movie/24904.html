<PRE>Love's Labour's Lost
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Film musicals are a tough sell these days.  It's either the annual
Disney animation vehicle or it's Edward Norton dancing to swing music.
I could probably count the last five years worth of decent musicals on
my left hand.  The juxtaposition of dialogue with song and dance always
seems to remind me of the tragedies of my high school drama days.  Those
damn tights.  The bad pancake makeup.</P>
<P>Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespearean opus, Love's Labour's Lost, falls
into the category of an ingenious experiment gone horrible wrong.  Like
a bartender with one too many vodka-tonics on his breath, Branagh mixes
one of Shakespeare's lesser-known comedies with the music of Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin and places everything in 1939 France.  Think the Rat
Pack in some bad 1960s film.</P>
<P>Tell me if this doesn't seem a bit strange to you:  The King of Navarre
and his three best friends decide to put down their swords and seclude
themselves from the world in order to study philosophy and fast from
food and comfort for three years.  No women are allowed in the court,
and all of them can do great Fred Astaire impressions.  Ummm... sounds a
bit kooky to me.  The arrival of the Princess of France and her three
maidens sends the boys into a crazed frenzy.  Each of the guys decides
to lay down his oath of seclusion and romantically pursue one special
maiden of his choice.  War erupts and all four boys must leave their
newfound loves to fight for France's freedom.  Toss in a couple of
supporting characters full of enough shtick to shake a stick at (my lame
attempt at iambic pentameter), comical deception, and bake at 300
degrees for thirty minutes or until the cheesy top turns a golden brown.</P>
<P>The scariest thing about this film is the decision to cast Alicia
Silverstone as the lead role of the Princess of France.  Has Branagh
been doing drugs to suppress the memory of his role in last year's
cinematic opus Wild Wild West?  When Silverstone appears in the film and
starts spouting Shakespearean dialogue, all I could see was her
character Cher from Clueless performing a really, really bad
Shakespearean oral report for her English final.  It's a bit jarring at
first to watch the actors move from the complicated dialogue of the play
to the memorable songs of Gershwin, Porter, and Berlin: Sinatra and Dino
are probably calling Branagh the `biggest palooka from Endsville' from
the great beyond right now.  Branagh also pulls the same mistake as
Woody Allen did in his attempt at a musical by hiring actors that
could't even sing and dance for change on the street.</P>
<P>It's also a damn shame that this film doesn't work on the whole.
Branagh's directing is crisp and original.  The inclusion of
newsreel-style footage about the King's exploits makes for smart scene
changes.  The entire cast, with the strong exception of the Batgirl,
runs the difficult dialogue with great ease.  The costumes, makeup, and
set design are amazing.</P>
<P>The most problematic thing about the film is that it would have been a
success if only Branagh had stuck to the actual text of the play without
the distractions of the music.</P>
<P>One thing's for sure... Branagh ain't no song and dance man.</P>
