<PRE>Psycho
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Anthony Perkins; Vera Miles; John Gavin; Martin Balsam & John
McIntire</P>
<P>Psycho is the Alfred Hitchcock film considered by many to be a masterpiece.
When it was released in 1960 it was probably one of the scariest movies ever
made. By today's standards it has a couple of shocking moments, but it
certainly wouldn't be what I'd consider to be a real scary film. Since I'm
judging Psycho by today's standards, it is for that reason that I wouldn't
really recommend Psycho to someone who was looking for a real good scare.
They won't find it in Psycho. Even the famous shower scene has lost its
shock value. When Psycho was first released it had the virtue of never
having been done before. Today there are very few people out there who
haven't at least heard about the shower scene. As a result, when it happens,
it isn't a real big surprise to anyone watching. As soon as Janet Leigh
turns on the water in the bathroom, you know exactly what is coming next.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
The afore mentioned Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane. Marion steals a large
sum of money from her employer and hops into her car and leaves town. She
decides to spend the night in a lonely motel out in the middle on nowhere.
It's the very deserted Bat's Motel run by the very odd Norman Bates (Anthony
Perkins) and his mother. To be brief, Marion decides to go in for a shower
after she settles into her room. Once she goes in, she never comes out again
alive. The rest of the movie centers on Marion's sister, boyfriend and a
private investigator hired by her employer, trying to track down Marion, who
has seemingly disappeared off the face of the Earth. And none of them get
any help from Bates, although they all suspect that he knows a little more
than he is willing to let on.</P>
<P>While I wouldn't recommend Psycho for its shock value, I would recommend it
on the basis that it is brilliantly made. Even though I'm not a big fan of
black and white movies, visually it works very well. Add to that some of the
best music found in a horror film, and you have a decidedly creepy, if not
scary movie. The final reason, and the main one for recommending Psycho is
the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. It was probably the
performance of his career. With the exception of Anthony Hopkins in Silence
Of The Lambs, you will never find a more eerie personality on screen than
Bates. Almost as soon as Perkins appears on screen, the audience knows that
something just isn't right about this guy and he is bound to be trouble. For
the sake of those 2 or 3 people that are just waking from a coma that
they've been in since the early sixties, I won't go into any more detail
about why good old Norm is as frightening as he is, let's just say his
problems seem to run in the family.</P>
<P>Psycho is a classic, and like many classics, I've found it to be just a
little disappointing when compared to current films. The only reason to
watch Psycho is for the haunting performance of Perkins, which is more than
ample reason to plunk down a few bucks at the video store. As a personal
note, the original is a far better way to spend your time and money on that
the 1998 remake starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.</P>
<P>7/10 -- Most of that due to Perkins' performance and Hitchcock's direction.</P>
