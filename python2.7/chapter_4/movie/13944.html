<P>Plot: Grace Cuthberston, a homeless and unemployed teen, meets the 
mysterious Gerald Hutchinson at a Wellington welfare office. He keeps 
following her and she cautiously accepts his invitation to come and stay 
and the two become friends and eventually lovers. But then he makes the 
claim that he is Jesus Christ. She has difficulty deciding whether he is 
simply crazy or whether his claim and apparent manifestation of miracles 
are genuine.</P>
<P>Costa Botes will be known to many New Zealanders as film critic at 
Wellington's morning newspaper The Dominion. Botes, of course, made his 
directorial debut as co-director (with Peter Jackson) of the hilarious 
mockumentary `Forgotten Silver' that had half the nation swallowing its 
story in 1995.</P>
<P>`Saving Grace' is Botes's first solo feature. Here Botes adapts Duncan 
Sarkies' two-person play. Behind the play and film lurks the intriguing 
question "What would happen if Jesus Christ returned today ?" 
Unfortunately it is a question that the film readily lacks a answer for 
and the idea heads off instead into a drama about belief and doubt. 
Certainly `Saving Grace' is not a poor film. Botes does a fine job of 
expanding the two-person play out beyond the confines of the stage while 
still retaining it as a drama that uses only two actors. It is well 
edited and very nicely photographed, particularly during the end scenes. 
And the two actors, Kirsty Hamilton and Jim Moriarty, both, despite the 
habits of Kiwi accents to sound somewhat flat on screen at times, both 
work off one another well and give good performances.</P>
<P>It's just that when it comes to issues of theology the film seems stuck 
not much above the Sunday School level. Every time Moriarty launches 
into talking about being Jesus or taking Grace to meet his Father and so 
forth you feel like having to stifle giggles at the silliness of it - 
his opening line of dialogue is a flat deadpan "The meek shall inherit 
the Earth" which really makes you wonder whether you are meant to take 
it seriously or laugh. Both Botes and Sarkies are admitted atheists 
(something which shouldn't necessarily be a problem for the film) but 
their grand mistake is to try and make a film about Jesus Christ with 
only a vague idea of what Christianity is about. Jesus of The Bible 
appears as someone with a very certain mission - he had charisma, he was 
a rabble-rouser, someone who challenged authority and cut through 
hypocrisy; whereas The Christ in the film is infected with a case of 
postmodern angst and seems to have as many clues as to what he is meant 
to on about as anyone else does. This Jesus does miracles, walks on 
water, raises the dead (and a new one that isn't in The Bible - he 
tosses coins so they land on their edge) and so on but they just seem 
magic tricks that come without any sense of purpose. And even though 
this Christ says he doesn't do tricks they seem to be the only things he 
has up his sleeve - there should be more to a film about Jesus Christ 
than it having to be `Portrait of Jesus as Amateur Magician'. Similarly 
the Christ in the film is nailed to a cross but again it seems simply 
because that is what is meant to happen to Jesus. The script seems to 
lack any greater understanding of the symbolic meaning of what 
crucifixion represents for Christians - about redeeming the world 
through sacrifice and so on.</P>
<P>The film seems to miss its dramatic cues. In the most vivid scene during 
a screaming match over Gerald's claims, Grace slashes her wrists and 
Gerald (the Christ character) heals her. But the scene tapers off. It 
should have been a fundamental character breakthrough for Grace but 
there is no accompanying sense of dramatic realization. A far more 
worthwhile script would have then had Gerald turn to her and say 
something like "You see, you do believe. You must have believed to know 
that I would heal you." There are occasional moments when the film 
interpolates the idea of a Christ for modern times with amusement - 
Grace opening cupboards and the fridge to find them filled with loaves 
and fishes; Christ trying to spread his message on radio talkback and by 
setting up an website. Admittedly the film vies (although with stumbling 
uncertainty) between asking us to believe that Gerald is really Christ 
or whether this is all inside Grace's imagination - and there is a 
reasonable ending that leaves the whole issue hanging ambiguously for 
the audience to decide. But for all that it matters to the film that 
Gerald is Jesus Christ, it could be that we are being asked to believe 
that he is an alien, a pixie or a magician. A story about Christianity 
should be a tale about salvation and moral redemption, but instead all 
we have is a film that sits on a fence and plays the old is it real or 
is it in her mind game. A far better ambiguous messiah film is 1987's 
`Man Facing Southeast', a film which juggled all of these themes with 
considerable intelligence and flair. </P>
