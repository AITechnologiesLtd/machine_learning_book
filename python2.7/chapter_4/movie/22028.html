<P>     If I could be sure what THE LEGEND OF 19900 is supposeed to be about
-- or have any sympathy for what I suspect it's about -- I might actually
have enjoyed it. There are certainly some appealing technical elements in
Giuseppe Tornatore's "fable" about a strange character named Nineteen
Hundred (Tim Roth). Born on an ocean liner called the Virginian in the
year that becomes his name and abandoned in a lemon crate, Nineteen
Hundred is raised by one of the ship's coal stokers (Bill Nunn). He also
never leaves the ship, becoming a pianist for the Virginian's jazz band
when his prodigious musical talents emerge. A trumpet player named Max
(Pruitt Taylor Vince) befriends Nineteen Hundred, and becomes convinced
that the piano virtuoso could become a musical legend out in the world. 
Yet Nineteen Hundred continues to struggle with the idea of leaving the
ship, even when he becomes infatuated with a beautiful passenger (Melanie
Thierry).</P>
<P>     For a while, the gilded romanticism of THE LEGEND OF 1900 makes it
easy on the eyes and ears. Cinematographer Lajos Koltai burnishes every
frame with a mysterious light, filling the film with a sense of epic
nostalgia. The music is frequently captivating as well, with Ennio
Morricone's haunting themes building interest in the eccentric Nineteen
Hundred. Music also anchors the film's best sequence, in which jazz legend
Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III) comes to the Virginian to
challenge Nineteen Hundred to a piano "duel." It's all quite fanciful,
given an undercurrent of consequence by Pruitt Taylor Vince's performance
of thousand-yard stares, flashing back to the friendship that changed
Max's life.</P>
<P>     In retrospect, Vince deserves immense praise for his work, since he
manages to convey the idea that this story has something profound to say.
It's actually quite a preposterous piece of work, as it turns out, and not
because of its protagonist's unique life. Tornatore just doesn't give us
any sense of who Nineteen Hundred is or what he's all about. At times he's
a dreamer who spins elaborate descriptions of places he's never been; at
times he's a hard-nosed competitor who delights in showing up the famous
Jelly Roll and shouting an epithet after him as he leaves the ship. He
isn't so much a character as he is a deliberate enigma -- not becuase he's
complex, but because Tornatore wants to make him an all-purpose archetype.
Tim Roth gamely tries to give Nineteen Hundred a human face, but in this
"fable" he's not really playing a human. He's just a metaphor for
something or other.</P>
<P>     If forced to guess what he's a metaphor for, I'd have to say it ties
in with early themes in the film about immigrants coming to America. 
Nineteen Hundred's fears of leaving the Virginian may represent those who
stayed behind while others dared to leave for the New World -- the idea of
finding his fortune "out there" isn't as compelling as staying where
things are known and comfortable. THE LEGEND OF 1900 might have worked as
a sympathetic, affectionate acknowledgement of those whose fears held them
back. Unfortunately, Tornatore elevates a phobia to sage philosophy,
having Max nod knowingly as Nineteen Hundred gives a lengthy speech about
the dangers of an "infinite" world. There's something vaguely pathetic
about his paean to boundaries; it's even more pathetic if we're expected
to find him somehow noble in his obsessive fear. The theme also appears
far too late in the story, leaving you to wonder about all the preceding
filler that simply confuses the question of what this character is all
about. Eventually, the film implodes under the weight of the importance
placed on Nineteen Hundred's life. It turns out we've been suckered into
caring about the fate of a vague symbol, and maybe a vague symbol for
something foolish and sad.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 turns of the century:  4.</PRE>
