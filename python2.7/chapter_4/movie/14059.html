Mini Review: "The Avengers"
Director:    Jeremiah S. Chechik
Cast:        Ralph Fiennes   (John Steed)
             Uma Thurman     (Emma Peel)
             Sean Connery    (Sir August de Wynter)
             Patrick Macnee  (Invisible Jones)
             and others</PRE>
<P>We saw this movie on a pre-release screening at the Open Air Cinema
Cinelac in Geneva in the original version with french and german
subtitles.</P>
<P>For any who might not know, the movie builds on a rather succesful 
British TV series of the 60's. While I have a few fond memories of 
watching the series years later on German TV, I do not remember it
well enough to state how close the movie is to the tone and style of
the original series.</P>
<P>All in all we enjoyed the movie quite a bit, laughing often at some
of the purposely over-the-top scenes and dialogue. Thinking too much
about the movie later is prone to lead to some disappointment though
as you realize the many possibilities to improve it.</P>
<PRE>Likes:                               Dislikes:
------------------------------       -------------------------------
* Style                              * Wasted actor talent, the 
* Tongue-in-cheek presentation         characters are mostly paperthin
* Interplay between lead couple      * Bad plot holes and contrivances
* Casting Sean Connery as bad guy    * Weak storytelling, esp. at the end</PRE>
<P>I've read several bad reviews in the press and tend to think that they
are caused by overly high expectations. With its stellar cast, The Avengers
*could* have become a very good movie, but it isn't. On the other hand
in my book it is still a fair movie, quite up to par in enjoyment value
with many of the action flics one sees as mind candy from time to time.</P>
<P>Overall rating: +1 (Mark Leeper scale) for enjoyment, 0+ all in all.</P>
