<PRE>                            THE TRUMAN SHOW
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A man lives his life not realizing
          that he is on television and an audience of
          millions watches his every move.  But the game is
          starting to slip and Truman is beginning to guess
          that reality is not what he thinks it is.  Jim
          Carrey stars in an old science fiction idea that is
          new to films.  After several years Peter Weir
          returns to the weird.  Rating: 9 (0 to 10), +3 (-4
          to +4)  SPOILER WARNING: The premise of THE TRUMAN
          SHOW is told in all of the trailers, but it is not
          fully revealed until well into the film.  This
          review does discuss that premise.</PRE>
<P>     There was a time when Australian Peter Weir made strange and
quirky films like THE CARS THAT ATE PARIS, THE PLUMBER, and THE LAST
WAVE.  But Weir lost that level of creativity at some point. His films
were more professional and perhaps more polished, but they were closer
to Hollywood fare.  At most they had just a small whiff of the strange
his earlier films had.  It has been a long time since Weir made a film
as enthralling philosophically as THE TRUMAN SHOW.  Weir looks at the
media and what it is doing to both the viewer and the person under
media scrutiny.  The film also takes a playful look at the relationship
between humanity and God.</P>
<P>     Truman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) is now thirty and through
his whole life he has been off-camera only in his most private moments.
In some unspecified number of years, in the future people all over the
world tune in to watch THE TRUMAN SHOW and track how his life is
progressing.  As sort of a cross between AN AMERICAN FAMILY and CANDID
CAMERA, "The Truman Show" follows one character through his every day
and even his every move.  Truman has no idea that he is being watched.
If he knew it would spoil the entire project.  And a phenomenal
investment has been put into creating the huge domed studio the size of
a town with cameras everywhere to relay to the world everything that
happens to Truman.</P>
<P>     The whole project is the brainchild of the godlike producer
Christof (Ed Harris).  No effort has been spared to build the
unbelievable domed studio or to ingrain phobias into Truman so that he
is afraid to stray too far from his home.  As part of the latter effort
we see a visit to a travel agent who has decorated her office with
marvelous anti-travel posters.  Christof has programmed nearly
everything that has ever happened to Truman.  Christof has cast the
important people in Truman's life including his supposed parents and
his wife Meryl (Laura Linney of TALES OF THE CITY).  Meryl's
responsibilities include keeping Truman in line and unsuspecting,
delivering charming commercials for sponsors' products placed into
Truman's world, and above all to keep smiling.  But things are getting
a little difficult for Meryl as Christof's production staff gets a
little sloppy: lights fall from a clear sky and supposedly dead
characters from Truman's past find their way back onto the show set.
Truman is starting to get suspicious that there is something not right
about his reality.</P>
<P>     Does Jim Carrey do a good job of playing Truman Burbank?  That is
a very difficult question to answer.  At first brush it would seem not.
Carrey is his usual weird and does his trademarked brand of clowning
around.  Is this the way someone raised on camera with scripted
experience would behave?  Probably not, but it is unclear how he would
behave.  He almost certainly would lean to some form of weird.  Whether
this is one way he could be weird is hard to tell.  The constantly
smiling Laura Linney is at first charming and quickly becomes grating,
but again these are unusual circumstances.  She would not behave like
an actress because this is like almost no acting job has ever been.
She would have to be constantly improvising and be onstage 16 to 24
hours a day, year in and year out.  Her role would have to be her
primary life. Perhaps her little Stepford wife is precisely what would
result.  Rounding out the major characters is Ed Harris as the de facto
god of Truman's world.  Harris takes his role in a quiet understated
manner and does a fine job.</P>
<P>     I would have loved to have seen THE TRUMAN SHOW cold, having no
idea what the film was about. Unfortunately the ads give much too much
away.  There is a slow build to where the viewer is told the
information in the trailer.  Much of the mystery of Andrew Niccol's
script (as complex as his script for GATTACA) is lost.  One of the big
holes, however, is that this is a much less believable story if taken
literally rather than as allegory.  One must believe that there are
thousands of actors in Truman's world who are just waiting months or
years to be cued.  There are probably parts of Truman's town that he
never visits, but the actors have to be prepared if he does.  Fantastic
preparedness must be arranged for contingencies that probably will
never occur.  In addition, the number of cameras needed to produce THE
TRUMAN SHOW must be literally phenomenal.  At one point Christof
estimates that 5000 cameras are used to cover all the places that
Truman might possibly go.  A little back of the envelope calculation
will show that figure has got to be orders of magnitude low without a
fair risk of losing Truman.  The town as shown must be about nine
square miles and then Truman goes off into the woods in the course of
the film.  The logistics of setting up and running this pseudo-town
seem more and more complex the more one thinks about them.  But again,
this is more a religious allegory than a science fiction story to be
taken literally.  Niccol has a lot of fun playing with the various
features of the artificial sky as a recurrent theme in the film, but
also giving the film a sort of medieval cosmology.</P>
<P>     Music is by Burkhart (von) Dallwitz and seems to consist mostly of
easy listening and classical music on a sort of celestial, New Age
theme.  The idea for THE TRUMAN SHOW is one that has been done in
science fiction several times previously.  Then there are ideas
borrowed from other sources like the 60s TV show THE PRISONER.  I would
rate THE TRUMAN SHOW an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4
to +4 scale.  This is Weir's best film since THE LAST WAVE by a wide
margin.</P>
