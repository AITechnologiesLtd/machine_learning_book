<PRE>POLLOCK
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
May 25th, 2001</PRE>
<P>The most innovative of the Abstract Expressionists was Jackson Pollock whose 
surrealist paintings gave way to "action paintings," the idea that paint 
could be dripped onto the canvas and create vivid splashes of color. Pollock 
created the drip technique and thus, a sense of freedom within the canvas was 
born where space became largely ambiguous. Pollock is world reknown, so much 
that American film directors like Martin Scorsese or Oliver Stone are often 
referred to as the "Jackson Pollocks of cinema" for their often seemingly 
free form styles. Such an innovator is given a fairly conventional though 
often harrowing treatment by Ed Harris in his directorial debut. </P>
<P>Naturally, Ed Harris plays the tortured, neurotic, manic-depressive Jackson 
Pollock. The film begins in New York City in the postwar era of the 1940's 
where Pollock is still an unknown. He meets with another painter, Lee Krasner 
(Marcia Gay Harden), who hears of Pollock through word-of-mouth and becomes 
interested in his work. After all, if you are a painter in New York who is 
talked about in circles, you must make your appearance through the proper 
channels. Lee Krasner knows the proper channels. She is acquainted with Peggy 
Guggenheim (Judith Ivey), the owner of the Art of This Century Gallery, who 
is ticked off when climbing five flight of stairs to find Pollock is not 
home. Nevertheless, she sees his work and commissions it to be show in her 
gallery. </P>
<P>Pollock also finds a willing romantic partner in Lee Krasner who knows of the 
man's faults and still decides to be with him. Pollock is an alcoholic and 
usually finds himself sleeping outside tenements. His solution is to get away 
from the city, and so Krasner offers him an option - get married and move or 
she walks. They move to the Hamptons near the beach for tranquility. This is 
also beneficial for Pollock who can find himself locked in his work rather 
than in alcohol. As time goes on, Pollock eventually discovers his drip 
technique and becomes a sensation in New York and around the world. And when 
does Pollock know that his work is finished? "How do you know you are 
finished when you are making love," asks Pollock when interviewed by Life 
magazine. </P>
<P>"Pollock" occasionally finds the painter at work in his studio but the film's 
screenplay devotes more time to his turbulent relationship with Lee Krasner. 
Lee puts up with Pollock through his affairs and endless drinking bouts 
because she wants him to be the great painter that he is. It is clear that 
Lee is devoted to him and tries to help him, thus putting her own career on 
hold for his sake. They frequently have their arguments, some more harsh than 
others, but they still manage to stay together for several years. </P>
<P>By the 1950's, Pollock grows into a bearded, fat, obnoxious, unlikable man. 
He retreats from his "drip" style to his original abstract paintings. He also 
has an affair with a luscious art groupie (Jennifer Connelly) and largely 
detaches himself from Lee. The brief romance is mostly dull as compared to 
his emotional bond with Lee, and the film meanders a bit whenever Connelly 
shows up, whom I do admire as an actress overall. </P>
<P>My complaints of the film are largely relegated to the depiction of Pollock's 
own status in the art world. The recent "Before Night Falls" did not dwell on 
why the famous writer, Reinaldo Arenas, became a writer, it only showed his 
surroundings and how they affected him. But Pollock is a more complex, 
larger-than-life character. He seems to lack communication with his mother 
(Sada Thompson - the matriarch from the 70's TV show "Family") or his brother 
and his family - they attend his gallery shows but they never speak to each 
other, particularly at the dining table. Pollock's family life is given so 
little shred of introspection that we never understand why they ever visit 
him in the first place - consider that almost every scene with his family 
ends in a violent disruption. Does Pollock's temperamental personality and 
his seclusion in his work cause his family to be silent or are they unhappy 
with his artistic life? Whatever lack of communication exists may hint at 
Pollock's own troubled nature but the film never makes that connection. </P>
<P>The two fantastic lead performances rescue whatever character limitations 
exist. Ed Harris is powerful and harrowing as the troubled Pollock - he even 
looks like the painter judging by recent photographs I have looked at. Marcia 
Gay Harden is the strong, sympathetic, tough and direct Lee Krasner (she 
deservedly won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work here). They 
have several great scenes together but my favorite is when he asks her if 
"they can make a baby." She says no, claiming that fulfilling his needs is 
enough and all she ever wanted. It is indeed. </P>
<P>If "Pollock" had dwelled on the artist's personal, familial side and if the 
fleeting world of Abstract Expressionists had been developed, the film might 
have been a stunning masterpiece. As it is, it is a hellish, demanding work 
with two ball-of-fire performances that will rattle your nerves, shake up 
your senses, and largely disorient you. Just like Jackson Pollock did. </P>
