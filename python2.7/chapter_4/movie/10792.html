<P>   "Hurricane Streets" is much closer in genre to Truffaut's
"400 Blows" than it is to the Hughes Brothers' "Dead
Presidents."  Written and directed by Morgan J. Freeman--
who has moved Truffaut's Parisian ambiance to New York's
Lower East Side--the picture deals with a group of high-school
kids who are dabbling in petty crime, presumably hurt by the
absence of parental authority.  They're at the crossroads that
can take them more deeply into a life of misconduct or can
see them straighten out: In fact we can predict that the fellows
who make the big move to armed robbery are the ones who
are being manipulated by older, more hardened criminals who
appear to be mentoring them into the big stuff.</P>
<P>   This picture, which played at the 1997 Sundance Festival,
claims to be the first dramatic entry every to win a triple prize:
the Audience Award, the prize for inaugural Dramatic
Directing, and the honor for Cinematography.  For a while you
wonder why.  But director Freeman carefully adds texture to
his tale of youthful anomie and, with a sound track that builds
up and underscores the wonderful disco beat of "Being Alive,"
"Hurricane Streets" has enough suspense and complexity to
appeal to its targeted youthful audience and to cross over to
an adult constituency as well.</P>
<P>   Opening with a black-and-white scene which foreshadows a
climactic point in the drama, "Hurricane Streets" focuses on
the 15-year-old Marcus (Brendan Sexton, Jr.), a kid whose
budding career as a petty thief belies his open-faced
vulnerability and general naivete.  The de facto leader of a
racially- and ethnically-mixed group of young people who
hang out in an underground club house, Marcus has troubles
which can be traced to an absentee mother who is serving a
prison sentence for killing his abusive father.  Living with his
grandmother, who owns a neighborhood bar, Marcus awaits
an air ticket from his uncle in New Mexico, a sunny state
which the young man treats as a Shangri-La where he has
space to breathe and where he can get away from the mean
streets of his New York ghetto.  The romantic interest is
almost laughingly innocent when you consider the pregnancy
rate of young women living in poor neighborhood: when
Marcus meets fourteen-year-old Melena (Isidra Vega), he
begins to hang out with her and while they meet daily, they
content themselves with a couple of chaste kisses.</P>
<P>   Moreover with one exception the guys who chill out in the
clubhouse to play darts, one-up each other with remarkably
guileless braggadocio, and plan an incremental increase in
their blooming careers in crime, are flat-out cute.  Marcus,
Benny, Harold and the others are more like the Bowery Boys
than Anthony Curtis and his band from "Dead Presidents."
They seem even unfamiliar with popular slang: when one of
the boys suggests stealing a car, he estimates that they could
fence it for "1,000 big ones."  (Since when is a buck a big
one?)</P>
<P>   The coy courtship of Marcus and Melena is tender and
believable, courtesy of sharp acting from Sexton--who gained
national recognition from his role in the remarkable "Welcome
to the Dollhouse"--and a film debut from 18-year-old Isidra
Vega.  Cinematographer Enrique Chediak shines particularly
in his lensing of Marcus riding his bike feverishly through the
streets of New York and, all in all, "Hurricane Streets" profiles
for us a group of teens who are not cookie-cutter gang
members.  Rather, they are individuals with a fair degree of
guilt feelings for the lives they are leading and who can be
helped to follow the straight and narrow if they can only be
sequestered from the more hardened adults who are tutoring
them.  Rated R.  Running time: 88 minutes.  (C) Harvey
