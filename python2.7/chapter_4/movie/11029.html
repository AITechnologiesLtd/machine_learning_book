                            THE POSTMAN 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon

<P>I don't understand Kevin Costner's fetish for legendary, bigger than
life heroes. We look at his work DANCES WITH WOLVES where ordinary
soldier becomes legendary Indian liaison officer. In PRINCE OF THIEVES
he is a legendary social worker. In WYATT EARP, a legendary police
officer and WATERWORLD is no exception with a legendary mutant. So it's
not surprising that a picture titled THE POSTMAN starring Kevin Costner,
will be about a legendary postman. Sorry Kevin, but I'm getting tired of
all this legendary stuff. I just like my mail delivered without much ado
legendary fuss.</P>
<P>Costner who directs this movie, has tried to recreate an epic as big as
the American Civil War in the future. He fails miserably especially when
he tries to draw on that all American patriotic spirit, by burning a
couple of US flags and getting one of his kids to sing the national
anthem. This doesn't draw much of an emotional response, especially if
you're foreign and carry little American sentiment. Still it is
difficult to believe that in the year 2012, 14 years from now, one will
be faced with a post-apocalyptic way of life. Chaos runs amuck. The
survivors of this 3rd WW holocaust now live in small towns isolated from
each other. Evil shows itself in the form of a Hitler like General with
an organised army of mercenaries. A man rises against the General's
totalitarian rule, the legendary POSTMAN.</P>
<P>The problem seems to arise from overcrowding the story with too many
events. This results in a patchy story line with garish errors. An
example is what I call the re-instillation of the ten commandments
scene. Rule number 1: ‘No more killing', the postman yells aloud, and
this is followed by Rule number 8: ‘Live and Let live'. Hello, but isn't
rule number 1 the same as rule number 8 and what about rules 2 to 7? The
middle of the movie is filled with the recreation of ‘The Pony Express',
before a North meets South ending where the geriatric/adolescent army
confronts the mercenaries. There is no great finale, just a fist fight
showing who is the better man. If I wanted a history lesson I could have
gone to the public library, and if this is the way that legends are
made, I'd rather not.</P>
<P>My final comments are severe. THE POSTMAN is unoriginal, poorly written
and unimaginative. An over all waste of precious time and money.</P>
