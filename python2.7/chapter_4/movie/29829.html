<PRE>DIAMOND MEN
-----------</PRE>
<P>Eddie Miller (Robert Forster, "Jackie Brown"), a man in his fifties, suddenly
finds his livelihood threatened when a mild heart attack renders
him uninsurable.  He's a fine jewelry salesman who travels throughout
Pennsylvania with a million dollars worth of inventory.  Clinging to the only
job he knows, Eddie agrees to train his replacement, the young, brash
Bobby Walker (Donnie Wahlberg, "The Sixth Sense") in writer/director 
Dan Cohen's "Diamond Men."</P>
<P>Bobby arrives in a flashy sports car ('I can't sit in that seat - my prostrate
will be up in my throat,' harrumphs Eddie) full of bravado.  When Eddie
worries
about 'protecting the line' by remaining inconspicuous, Bobby retorts that
it's insured and begins to score chicks in each remote hamlet.  He's late
in the morning, uses profanity in front of customers and can't handle
jeweler's equipment.  Eddie is beside himself, but one day they have a
breakthrough when Bobby appreciates Eddie explaining the difference between 
two diamonds to a shopper.  'What's the magic word?' he asks Eddie afterwards,</P>
<P>referring to Eddie's ability to make sale after sale while he strikes out.  
'They're not saying no, they're saying give me a reason to say yes,' replies 
Eddie.  </P>
<P>Now that the young man has asked for his help, Eddie softens and they open
up to each other.  Bobby scored well on a test, but he admits a friend 
actually filled it out and his only experience on the road has been filling
vending machines.  Eddie, meanwhile, has recently lost his beloved wife to
cancer and the long illness just about wiped him out financially.  Eddie 
becomes more encouraging and patient training Bobby while Bobby becomes
committed to finding a female companion for Eddie.  When none of his small
town conquests are interested in the older man, Bobby brings him to his
friend Tina (Jasmine Guy, TV's "A Different World"), who runs The Altoona
Riding Club, a backwoods brothel.  It's here that Eddie's nightmares and
unimagined dreams will both come true.</P>
<P>Cohen has not one, but two triumphs with his small, independent feature.
Firstly, he captures completely the world of a salesman's small town route
where routine and out of the way motels and restaurants are comfortingly
familiar and customers are treated like old friends.  Secondly, he's elicited
strong and natural performances from his two costars, with Forster's 
being one of the best male leads of the year.</P>
<P>Forster's Eddie is an exceedingly decent and competent man, trying to roll 
with the extremely bad hand he's been dealt.  While he's initially (and
justifiably) exasperated with Bobby's behavior, he always keeps his cool, 
like the mellow jazz he likes to listen to.  Wahlberg is hilariously obnoxious
at first, hoping his flashy loudness will be misinterpreted as confidence.
Bess Armstrong is good, if a bit too clinical as Katie, the woman Eddie
meets at Tina's and George Coe is fine as Tip, one of Eddie's oldest
customers.</P>
<P>The film begins to lose its momentum in its final act, but finds its
way back again by delivering a satisfying and unexpected punchline.
"Diamond Men" sparkles most, however, when examining the moments so many
would find dull.</P>
