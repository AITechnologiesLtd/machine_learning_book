<P>     Directed by Paul Verhoeven. Written by Joe Eszterhas. Starring Michael
Douglas and Sharon Stone, with George Dzundza and Jeanne Tripplehorn. 1992, 130
min., R (available also in an unrated director's cut), see below for details.</P>
<P>    When "Basic Instinct" came out in 1992, audiences either loved it or
loathed it. Critics were much the same. Actually, most praised it if only done
at face value, for Joe Eszterhas' script is as full of holes as a piece of
Swiss cheese. Eszterhas was propelled to stardom, becoming Hollywood's highest
paid screenwriter, for this lackluster effort. Yes, the same Eszterhas who will
be best remembered for "Showgirls," for which he was unofficially inducted into
the screenwriter's hall of infamy and public laughingstock-hood. (Though I
don't believe it harmed the size of his paychecks.) There has been speculation
that he only turned in a rough draft of the script, but it is so terrible that
he doesn't really have a defense. In spite of this severe flaw, the film became
a box-office success. Sleek sets and steamy sex aren't enough to make this the
seriously suspenseful film it could have been, though it's potential is evident
and we are luckily given glimpses of what a good thriller should be.</P>
<P>     Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) and his partner Gus (George
Dzundza) are investigating the murder of a "civic" minded ex rock star that was
stabbed to death with an ice pick while in the throes of sexual passion. His
casual lover of the past year and a half, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone)
becomes the main suspect, and with good reason. After the boating death of her
parents, she inherited around one hundred-ten million dollars, and now, at the
age of thirty, after earning college degrees in both literature and psychology,
she is living the good life with girlfriend Roxy (Leilani Sarelle) and writing
books under the pseudonym Catherine Woolf. Her last novel is suspiciously exact
in its depiction of the ice pick stabbing of a thrill-seeking, aging rocker.</P>
<P>     Nick has a shady past. He had a cocaine problem, was an alcoholic, has
shot four people, two who were innocent bystanders, and it is suggested that
his behavior led to the suicide of his wife. Catherine's sob story is
elaborated, but it is still hard to think of her as anything but a brilliant
seductress. Both Nick and Catherine are desperately dysfunctional, but Nick
can't hide his tendencies the way Catherine can. Given these two main
characters, who are hard to feel anything for, it is poetic justice that the
murderous (past?) drug user, and all around despicable…wait, that applies to
both. Ah, all the more perfect. This is one of the major downfalls of the
script, but it is also why it is believable on the surface. It is shoved down
our throats that these are tragic and doomed characters, and an underlying
tension is provided in the various edits of the film (material was excised for
television that places Nick in an even more unfavorable light), by Nick and
Catherine to similar degrees. Of course, either way he is constant danger of
being seduced by Catherine. (If only he had paid more attention when she told
him that her next book was going to be about a police detective who winds up
dead.)</P>
<P>     The US version was submitted several times to the ratings board to get an
R instead of an NC-17, the television edit was prepared by Verhoeven, and many
of the scenes were drastically altered, in turn causing the viewer's perception
of Nick to possibly be changed. The unrated director's cut was screened in
Europe, and is available on laserdisc, video, and DVD in the United States. In
addition to the problems with ratings, gay rights activists who thought that
the lesbianism and bisexuality was handled irresponsibly picketed "Basic
Instinct." I disagree with their qualms.</P>
<P>     Roxy was not likable, although it was easy to feel sorry for her. Most
people in the movie were unlikable. And there is no disputing that Catherine
was cold and calculating and used sex to get whatever she wanted. Does that
defame bisexuals? No more than Nick disparages heterosexual men.  Did anyone
complain about that? He wasn't nearly as smart as Catherine, and it is quite
apparent that he is sleeping with her only because he has to do something, and
he certainly can't compete with her in the intelligence/mind game departments.
The most telling scene in the film, and one illustrating that the film is not
homophobic, is the one that angered so many.</P>
<P>     Following one of Nick and Catherine's soft-porn, exhausting sex
diversions, Nick goes into the bathroom, where he encounters Roxy, who tells
him that if he doesn't leave Catherine alone she will kill him. Nick asks Roxy
to talk to him "man to man." But the scene is more visually representative of a
statement against Nick, or in a broader sense, men, as he is naked and Roxy is
clothed, thus putting her in the position of power. And Nick was smug, and
thought that Roxy was jealously watching him do something with Catherine that
she couldn't. Of course, the tables are turned when it is revealed that
Catherine knows about the watching and encourages it. Now it is Roxy's turn to
be smug.</P>
<P>     Okay, enough of that. Director Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Total Recall) gets
to shoot a lot of nudity and sex. This will attract some, well, probably most
viewers. I found myself detached from the movie enough that I saw the sex
scenes as ploys to maintain interest. The more liberal critical viewpoint would
be that the graphic sex and violence contained in "Basic Instinct" is necessary
to understand the story, and, more importantly, character (mainly Catherine)
motivation. The famous interrogation sequence, however, is the scene best
surmising her (though it can still be considered gratuitous, either reinforcing
or downsizing the concept).</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas is right for the role of self-assured Nick. "Fatal
Attraction" will be compared to this picture, and the parallels are there, but
"Basic Instinct" is stylized, unabashed smut, while the former aspired to a bit
more. Douglas more than pulls off Nick, who was written in a way that would
have proved troublesome for other, less versatile actors. He manages to be
edgy, threatening, and disbelieving while at the same time being vulnerable,
naïve, and the resulting gullible; all done realistically. Douglas adds the
depth that makes one wonder if Nick knows his fate and just doesn't care.</P>
<P>     Sharon Stone has the most complex role, at least on paper. She has managed
to rise above the material presented and convincingly portrays this diabolical
and wounded character. Recently, I saw her interviewed on the program "Inside
the Actor's Studio." When asked by host James Lipton if, in her opinion,
Catherine ends up killing Nick, she automatically said yes and when prompted to
elaborate, said, "He had to die," going on to explain that in the mind of
Catherine, it was either or her or him, because someone had to go. And right
she is.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast makes the predictable story a bit easier to watch.
Jeanne Tripplehorn poses an intriguing figure as a police psychologist, past
girlfriend (of more than one character) and all around hard to decipher
onlooker and potential participant. Dorothy Malone is back in a nice, if brief
role as a friend of Catherine's with a murderous history. Wayne Knight
("Jurassic Park" and seen weekly as Officer Don on "Third Rock From the Sun")
is amusing as a lawyer, and Leilani Sarelle is a standout as Roxy, the oddly
sympathetic character, and George Dzundza seems well cast but has little to do
as Nick's ill-fated partner, Gus.  (Did any other viewers of "Law & Order" find
themselves envisioning the movie as an episode instead? That way, at least,
Dzundza would have had a partner that was better suited him, and even if Chris
Noth's Detective Mike Logan didn't triumph over Catherine, we would at least
have had someone to grieve for.)</P>
<P>     Overall, the film comes across as a skin flick with a good cast. Attentive
viewers may have noticed the numerous Hitchcock rip-offs (there were too many
for them to be considered references or homage), beginning with the opening
crane shot. Almost all of the San Francisco shots, most noticeably the ones of
the Golden Gate Bridge, looked like they had been lifted straight from
"Vertigo." When Catherine's hair is pulled into a bun, she bears a striking
resemblance to Kim Novak (in "Vertigo"). Another idea that was stolen is a
slight variation on the lengthy talking and lips brushing scene that Ingrid
Bergman and Cary Grant made history with in "Notorious." Sampling may be
artistic licensing in the music world, but in movies it seems more like
plagiarism. The film's score, composed by Jerry Goldsmith (LA Confidential)
sounds Bernard Hermann-ish. It is the best attempt at imitation in the movie.</P>
<P>     "Basic Instinct" is a typical potboiler that fails to hold up under
dissection. Verhoeven has done better, nothing extraordinary is expected from
or delivered by Eszterhas, but Douglas is dependable as usual. His similarly
unsympathetic turn in "A Perfect Murder," and his strong title role in "The
American President" have led me to believe that he is one of the most
underrated actors currently working. And Stone is nothing short of a
revelation. After a decade of admittedly weak work, she made a strong and
lasting impression, and has since established herself as a respected actress.
(Later winning a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination for Martin
Scorsese's hit "Casino," and garnering more critical acclaim for her role in
1998s "The Mighty.")</P>
<P>     Notes: Rated R for nudity, sex, violence, and profanity.  The unrated
version has more explicit scenes of sex and violence.  </P>
<P>     DVD Details: Widescreen, production notes, theatrical trailer(s). 
Currently, the DVD is only available as the R-rated theatrical cut.  A DVD with
the same features as the Special Edition director's cut laserdisc is reportedly
in the works.  </P>
<P>     The Verdict: "Basic Instinct" falls flat.  So unless you're into bad
scripts that strong performances can't salvage, skip it in favor of "Vertigo." 
If you're looking for a bravura Stone performance, check out "Casino."</P>
