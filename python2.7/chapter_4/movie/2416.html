<P>     One thing is for certain--the tag lines for this man's movies
aren't difficult to remember.  "Steven Seagal is ABOVE THE LAW."
"Steven Seagal is MARKED FOR DEATH."  "Steven Seagal is HARD TO KILL."
"Steven Seagal is OUT FOR JUSTICE."  "Steven Seagal is UNDER SIEGE."
"Steven Seagal is ON DEADLY GROUND."  How about this for his next
film: "Steven Seagal is UNABLE TO ACT."</P>
<P>     Forrest Taft (Steven Seagal) is an ex-government operative who has
signed on as a troubleshooter and firefighter for Aegis Oil, operated
by the vicious and ruthless Michael Jennings (Michael Caine).  While
Taft is willing to go along to a point with Jennings' unethical and
environmentally-destructive business practices, he eventually arrives
at the inevitable decision that he can no longer continue to work for
Aegis.  So Jennings decides to have him killed, putting his top
"problem solver" (John C. McGinley) on the job.  The hit is botched,
however, and Taft survives to become the local natives' champion in
their fight against the oil company.</P>
<P>     I suppose I should give Mr. Seagal credit for trying to tie the
important theme of environmental rape into ON DEADLY GROUND.
Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, the attempt really doesn't
work.  Generally, the best way to promote a message, no matter what
sort of medium it's being filtered through, is through subtlety.  This
film has clue about such methods, and pushes across its agenda in an
alarmingly-obvious and intrusive manner.  Taft's five-minute lecture at
the end about the evils of poisoning the planet's natural resources
belongs in a public service announcement, not an action film.  This
overdose of political correctness becomes nauseating.</P>
<P>     Oddly, no matter how proper the movie is on the issue of the
environment, it has nothing to say about the flagrant and excessive use
of guns.  The body count in ON DEADLY GROUND is exceptionally high.
This isn't really unexpected, but amidst all the preaching, it seems a
trifle hypocritical.</P>
<P>     Themes and messages aside, ON DEADLY GROUND is moderately
successful in the action department.  The second half, with its
spectacular pyrotechnics and energetic shoot-outs, helps make up for a
sluggish first portion, which features a lengthy sequence delving into
Eskimo mysticism.  The thunderous, pulsing score by Basil Poledouris is
just right.</P>
<P>     One of the problems that I have with Mr. Seagal's movies is that
the main character never seems to be in serious jeopardy.  In part,
that's the difference between a film like ON DEADLY GROUND and DIE
HARD.  Bruce Willis' John McLaine gets beaten and bloodied, but no one
ever lays a hand on Forrest Taft.  The only time he gets injured is
when a massive explosion peppers his back with metallic fragments.
Invincible heroes like this reduce a film's tension to unappealing
levels.</P>
<P>     While Seagal the actor may be ON DEADLY GROUND's greatest problem,
Seagal the director shows a surprisingly deft hand.  I wouldn't want
him in control of a drama, or even a dramatic scene, but he has a flair
with action sequences.</P>
<P>     Sometimes a reasonably-serious actor can take on an over-the-top
villain's role and do a fabulous job with it (Tommy Lee Jones in UNDER
SIEGE, Alan Rickman in DIE HARD).  However, while Michael Caine chews
on the scenery and spits out every line with relish, he's more loud
than menacing.  In the end, he's too unworthy an adversary, much like
John C. McGinley's whiny character.  Mike Starr's barroom bully
radiates more pure nastiness.</P>
<P>     The less said about Joan Chen, the better.  To say that her
talents are wasted is to understate the matter.</P>
<P>     Review or no review, it isn't difficult to identify those who will
and won't like this film.  There's plenty of violence, lots of fights
and explosions, and the miniatures special effects work is impressive.
A sizable portion of the "Seagal crowd" will likely be annoyed by the
environmental message and the Eskimo religious practices because they
interfere with ON DEADLY GROUND's pacing.  In the end, however, there's
probably enough "bang" to overcome these flaws--for Mr. Seagal's fans,
if not everyone else.</P>
