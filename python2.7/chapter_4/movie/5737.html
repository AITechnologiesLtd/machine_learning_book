<PRE>                              THE PRODUCERS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>***</PRE>
<P>        THE PRODUCERS is the movie that reminds us that one 
time, long ago, Mel Brooks used to make good movies. With this 
and his 70's hits like BLAZING SADDLES and YOUNG FRANKEN-
STEIN, it must have seemed like he would be a formidable comedic 
force to be reckoned with. But as time wore on and his output 
extended to movies like DRACULA... DEAD AND LOVING IT and 
LIFE STINKS, it was obvious Brooks burned out. The message 
here is to stick with 60's and 70's Brooks and stay away from 
everything from the past two decades.</P>
<P>        To be sure, even his good movies had plenty of strained 
moments where the comedy just wasn't working, especially in THE 
PRODUCERS, which has annoying scenes of loud silliness that 
make you want to throw the TV out the window. From the early 
scenes, it seems like a bad, plotless movie, especially the scene 
where Gene Wilder gets hysterical (translation: ultra-whiny) for a 
minute and a half because Zero Mostel has taken his "blue blanket" 
away.</P>
<P>        Even a normally likeable performer like Wilder can get on 
one's nerves with bad comedic material (Remember his Man-
Smitten-With-Sheep scene from Everything You Always 
Wanted to Know About Sex?), and Lord knows there are 
places here where you wish someone would shove an Everlasting 
Gobstopper in his mouth to shut him up.</P>
<P>        Wilder is an accountant who has come to balance 
Broadway producer Mostel's books and soon becomes partners 
with him in a scheme to produce a play that will be a surefire flop 
and pocket the investors' money. First he needs some investors, 
whom he culls from his usual bevy of blue-haired old ladies who 
invest in exchange for sex with Mostel, the oldest and fattest gigolo 
alive. His sex appeal is less than his first name, but to an arthritic 
old lady, I guess it doesn't matter.</P>
<P>        The rest of THE PRODUCERS continues on an episodic 
scale, with scenes where Mostel and Wilder have to find the worst 
play ever written ("Springtime For Hitler: A Gay Romp With Adolph 
and Eva"), track down the author (a crazed Nazi), find a director 
("the worst director to ever live," who also wears a dress... I thought 
Ed Wood was dead.), audition some actors (including a hyperactive 
hippie Hitler who acts like Robin Williams) and finally put on the 
play itself.</P>
<P>        Most of the best moments in THE PRODUCERS come 
from the performance of "Springtime For Hitler" and its opening 
song-and-dance number, complete with a chorus line of German 
babes who form a moving swastika with their bodies. Tasteless 
(but not as tasteless as the man-smitten-with-sheep scene -- 
remember that?) but incredibly funny, unlike the rest of the movie, 
which is brainless and marginally funny. As a whole, though, 
THE PRODUCERS is a classic of 60's comedy and one of the 
few Mel Brooks successes.</P>
