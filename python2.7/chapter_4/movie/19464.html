<PRE>" Eyes Wide Shut "  * * * *</PRE>
<P>     I must admit to being completely distracted a good ten or twelve
minutes into EYES WIDE SHUT, the film that took forever and a day to
complete.  There¹s been such a great mystique about it, and so much written
and gossiped and hypothesized, for so damn long ­ the film was practically
created on the internet ­ that to be seeing the finished
product, finally, was something of an event.  And, in a word:  wow.</P>
<P>The very first image, of Nicole Kidman gradually and teasingly exposing
her full figure from the back, is at once voyeuristic, kinky and poignant.
Which kind of describes up the picture, as a whole.  The couple, Bill (Tom
Cruise) and Alice (a vulnerable, esoteric Kidman) prepare casually for a
Christmas party in Manhattan; she asks his opinion of her
looks, from the toilet seat, and he tells her she is beautiful, "always
beautiful", without actually looking.  It¹s a nice, efficient set-up,
explaining in little time the state of a nine-year marriage.  Bill doesn¹t
have to question or doubt his wife¹s loyalty, nor her beauty; she, and it,
have always been there.  Over the course of the party, husband and wife
go their separate ways, and both are approached by individuals with more on
their minds than small talk.  Alice, buzzed from champagne, dances with an
older man who suggests it would be only natural for her to cheat, because
that is to be expected in a marriage.  Advice acknowledged, she cordially
declines his offer; she doesn¹t give in to advances, drunk or otherwise, but
she almost seems willing to, nevertheless, in spite of herself.  Bill seems
readier to stray, arm in arm with two pretty models,
but also doesn¹t, though for reasons which have nothing to do with
faithfulness.  Duty calls, instead, with a naked girl upstairs who has had
"a bad reaction" to narcotics and booze.</P>
<P>Back home, later, the couple gets stoned ­ she much more than he ­ and
have an open, intimate discussion about sexual possibilities and diversions;
mostly pertaining to people outside their marriage.  As a gorgeous, deep
blue emanates from the bathroom (evocative to the mood of the dialogue)
against Kidman in her underwear, the conversation quickly becomes heated and
defensive.  It is here, and in other places, too, that all those reported
multiple takes truly pays off.  The couple¹s revealing talk sounds raw and
genuine and true; it has a valid, middle of
the night feel, when you¹ve been talking for hours and all that¹s left is
the heart of the matter.  Alice - and this is where Kidman (lovely, and sad)
shines ­ recounts a chance encounter from the past, involving herself and a
young officer of the Navy.  Nothing happened, but it could¹ve, and she would
have given everything in her life that she knows or holds dear
to not have let that moment pass.  So, what holds/held her back?  The
obvious answer would be family and marriage, but watch Kidman¹s face all
through her character¹s confession, and you sense it¹s something much deeper
than that.  Much deeper than what Bill accepts as general fact.  Alice would
not betray him, that one time, but now it seems more likely.</P>
<P>The idea pisses him off; that a single, solitary fleeting glance had
the potential to forever alter the course of their relationship is scary.
They are conveniently interrupted by a phone call from a patient of Bill¹s,
whose father has just died, and he leaves to console the woman.  And, during
the remainder of the long late night, he imagines his wife in the arms of
another.  We see his perception change, his cool demeanor slowly dissolve,
with each of the people he will come in to contact with.</P>
<P>Everything, every interaction, appears to revolve around sex.  The
woman who called is distraught, when Bill meets her, and she channels her
grief through sexual desire and a false declaration of love; the scene, on
the very bed of the deceased man, is funny and morose.  A hooker (an
alluring Vanessa Shaw) invites Bill to her place for sex, but the two share
nothing more than a soft kiss (and it¹s, by the way, one of the best
looking close-ups I¹ve seen).  An old friend from med school (played by Todd
Field), who dropped out and is now a pianist working various gigs, tells of
a covert meeting place for men and women who wear cloaks and masks and
participate in acts like nothing he¹s ever seen before.  Intrigued, and
against his friend¹s better advice, Bill picks up a costume
to wear to the gathering, at a store run by an odd man, who first rebukes
the activities of his underage daughter, but will later extend an indirect
proposition to Bill for some of the same.</P>
<P>There is a distinct air of artificiality to the lives of these
strangers, this environment, somehow making Alice¹s earlier admission all
the more profound; grounded.  And, as Bill¹s own marital devotion is called
into question and tested, time and again ­ culminating with the film¹s most
controversial sequence, at a strange, ritualistic orgy ­ EYES WIDE SHUT
develops into a rather shattering and mature meditation on whether or not we
really know our partner ­ ourselves, for that matter ­ and how much.</P>
<P>Speaking of the orgy sequence, I would like to¹ve seen the unabridged
version, because those much-debated 65 seconds, or so, carry the promise of
total erotic mischievousness.  The point is that Bill is witnessing things
he shouldn¹t, or would be better off not seeing (like the pedophilia, that
has come before), and even one of the masked women at the party seems to
know it, though they remain completely anonymous to one another.  How
fitting is it, then, that this faceless person saves Bill from dire
consequences of his unauthorized visit.  From himself:  what is he doing?
Is he at this place because it turns him on to be, or is
being there a means of not dealing with newfound jealousy, and confusion?
Or, both?  He has come to Alice¹s moment in time, and is rescued against his
will.  Which leads a tender moment between husband and wife, late in the
film, when the tables are turned and it is he who confesses to near sexual
indiscretion.</P>
<P>The orgy has since been remodeled, adding meticulously placed digital
figures, to escape the dreaded NC-17 rating, but I can¹t for the life of me
see why the filmmakers felt it necessary to do so.  The film is head-to-toe
thoroughly adult; censoring even a tiny portion doesn¹t make sense,
besides securing a wider audience.  EWS is strictly for the 17 and older age
range; Tom Cruise is a huge box office draw:  distribute the film in its
original, intended form, and people would still go.  Even still, I like what
was done; the orgy sequence does not seem real, anyway.  It¹s a fevered
daydream of libidinous imagery and flesh, screwing for the sake of screwing,
and feels kind of otherworldly.  We get just enough of a view of what is
being done, to figure out what¹s going on, and that¹s fine.  The censorship
- ugly word, but that¹s what it is ­ in no way detracts from the tone EWS
has worked so competently to establish by that point.</P>
<P>This is one of the best films of the year, provocative and intelligent.
It has been impeccably lit, be it the numerous arrays of bright yellows that
accompany the opening Christmas party and within Bill and Alice¹s upscale
apartment, or the lush reds and neon greens along the streets Bill roams
aimlessly.  EYES WIDE SHUT is beautiful to look at.  The cast is solid,
most notably Vanessa Shaw, and Sydney Pollack as the enigmatic confidant who
sets the record straight on a few crucial events for Bill (or, does he?).</P>
<P>But, it¹s Kidman, I think, who holds the movie together.  Her screen
time is nothing compared to that of Cruise, but she plays all of it with
nuance and precision.  Her pot-induced "millions of years of evolution"
monologue is a perfect example of timing and subtlety; Alice is altogether
happy and dissatisfied with her life ­ who isn¹t ­ and struggling to figure
out why.  Or, maybe I was struggling to.  The performance is a revelation
for Kidman, last seen in the awful PRACTICAL MAGIC, and worthy of Oscar
consideration.</P>
<P>Some scenes seem a bit out of place, like the skin-bare tryst set to a
Chris Isaak song.  And, the flirtation between Cruise and the female
roommate of a prostitute who has been diagnosed HIV positive.  But they,
alike all others here, compound what is, for all the waiting and hype, an
elegant and mesmeric motion picture.</P>
<PRE>     Best line:  "Don¹t you want to go where the rainbow ends?" </PRE>
