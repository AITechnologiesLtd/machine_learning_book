<PRE>                                  MAN'S BEST FRIEND
                       A film review by Robert Leon Bernstein
                        Copyright 1993 Robert Leon Bernstein</PRE>
<P>     It's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the
theater.  And unfortunately with MAN'S BEST FRIEND, we'll be waiting a
while longer.  The film stars Ally Sheedy and Lance Henrikson in a tale
of bio-genetics gone wrong.  Sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need
for a "good" story provokes her to snoop inside of EMAX, a poorly
guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly
intruding.  The result: she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named
MAX, a German Shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to
swallow like a snake, camouflage like a chameleon, climb trees like a
leopard, and attack with the strength of tiger.  MAX takes a liking to
Sheedy, and she finds herself  protecting the animal from the cruel
technological realm of EMAX, owned by Henrikson.  Well, it doesn't take
long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon
the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers MAX juicy leg of
mailman, etc...</P>
<P>     Sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen, tripping through
the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director (I apologize
for a lack of credits. I suppose I was eager to leave the theater, and
in my rush, forgot to take note of the director, writer, producer,
etc...).  Henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration
of the script, giving his character as much development as he could
considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film.  The movie depends
upon it's ability to impress the audience with animal special effects,
but all it presents is a dog that can growl, open door handles with his
paw, sit, roll over, play dead, and sick.  The rest of the special
effects were so poor, I found them offensive.</P>
<P>     The film attains sub-mediocrity, an unambitious film at best.
Horror fans might find that CUJO offers a better bite.</P>
