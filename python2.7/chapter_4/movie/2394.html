<P>     Even though it takes place in the 90s, the atmosphere is pure
40s.  The dialogue by Hilary Henkin could have been lifted from any
dime store detective story, and it's almost a surprise to see Gary
Oldman sauntering around instead of, say, Humphrey Bogart.  But ROMEO
IS BLEEDING isn't just an homage to the genre, it's a satire as well.
Unfortunately, it has a tendency to take itself too seriously, which
greatly limits its effectiveness.</P>
<P>     Jack Grimaldi (Gary Oldman) is a crooked cop.  Because his yearly
salary is only "Forty-two and change", he has decided to enrich himself
through several profitable deals with the local mob boss, Don Falcone
(Roy Scheider).  However, when one of those deals goes bad, he finds
himself caught in an underworld power struggle between Falcone and a
Russian assassin, Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin).  It's not long before the
shooting starts and Grimaldi finds himself and his wife (Anabella
Sciorra) trapped in a no-man's land.</P>
<P>     ROMEO IS BLEEDING certainly has all the elements:  the cop who
can't keep on the right side of the law, the cocktail waitress
girlfriend, seedy hotel rooms, the long-suffering wife, the high body
count, and the femme fatale.  Then there's the dialogue, which includes
some of the following "classic" lines:  "Can I tell you what makes love
frightening?   It's that you don't own it; it owns you", "Whoever you
shoot, you might as well marry, because you're tied together with them
until the end of life.  To the end of either their life, or yours", and
"A life's a life--moral distinctions can paralyze you."</P>
<P>     The atmosphere is black-and-white, even though the movie is in
color.  Dariusz Wolski's camerawork is evocative, as is the Angelo
Badalamenti-like score by Mark Isham.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the production runs into problems almost from the
outset.  While Gary Oldman is an excellent actor, either he's not right
for this part, or he's not playing it the way it was meant to be
played.  His portrayal is unrelentingly grim, which effectively
nullifies much of the satirical bent of ROMEO IS BLEEDING.  Not only is
Jack Grimaldi unlikable, but he's boring, and certainly not a match for
the villainess.</P>
<P>     Lena Olin gets the kind of over-the-top, totally nasty role that
is normally given to a male actor.  Her Mona Demarkov makes Sharon
Stone's Basic Instinct character look like a girl scout.  She's the
kind of woman that will laugh while garroting you, take a chainsaw to
her own arm, then ask if you want to make love with the prosthesis on
or off.  Ms. Olin steals every scene that she's in, although that isn't
difficult considering how easily Mr. Oldman blends into the
background.</P>
<P>     Juliette Lewis is, plainly put, annoying in what is thankfully a
small role.  She whines her way through her lines, and her attempts to
look and act sexy come across as ridiculous.  Anabella Sciorra fares
much better as the wife whom Grimaldi professes to still love.</P>
<P>     The voice-over is another problem.  It's certainly hardboiled,
which is in keeping with the overall tone, but it's also incredibly
long-winded and intrusive.  Whatever can be said in ten words is
dragged out to twenty or thirty.  It doesn't take long before the
viewer begins to wish Mr. Oldman would just shut up and let the story
get moving on its own.</P>
<P>     Comparisons with Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS and TRUE
ROMANCE are inevitable, but ROMEO IS BLEEDING comes across as an
inferior product.  Tarantino may operate in the same genre, and with
equally bloody scripts, but his characters have greater depth and his
stories are more energetic and powerful.</P>
<P>     Without Lena Olin's performance, ROMEO IS BLEEDING could have been
an ordinary, or even sub-par, film noir.  However, with a villainess as
fun as Mona Demarkov, it's impossible not to find some enjoyment amidst
Gary Oldman's dreadful seriousness and all the bloody corpses.  There
are some plot twists, and a few unexpected happenings, but in the end,
it's Ms.  Olin's character that keeps the audience in their seats.</P>
