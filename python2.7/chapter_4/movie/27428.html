                        A film review by Jonathan Curiel

<P>Please, please, please, please, please read the book that formed the
basis of the movie Pollock.  Jackson Pollock: An American Saga won the
Pulitzer Prize for a good reason: It's a 934-page masterpiece that gets
into the guts of the artist now being celebrated on celluloid by Ed
Harris.  Published in 1989 and written by Steven Naifeh and Gregory
White Smith, the tome contains everything about Pollock that was left
out of Harris' up-and-down movie -- and, unfortunately, that means 99
percent of the demons, doubters, friends, and forces that inspired
Pollock to drink, paint, drink, and paint again.</P>
<P>A good example: Pollock was suicidal, maniacal and violent throughout
his 44-year life.  The first sentence of Naifeh's and Smith's book --
the very first sentence -- is this quote from Pollock: "I'm going to
kill myself."  Explains a lot, but for some odd reason, Harris only
hints at Pollock's suicidal tendencies in his long-anticipated film.</P>
<P>What Harris does best is show us Pollock painting.  Over and over, we
see Harris dripping paint on large canvases and throwing around the oils
like they were enemies that need to be splattered dead.  Reds, yellows,
blues, and grays come alive in Pollock, letting viewers exhilarate in
the glory of creating great abstract art.  For people not familiar with
Pollock's paintings, Harris' movie will be a revelation.  Much of the
movie was filmed on Pollock's former Long Island estate, where he did
his most celebrated work.  Harris, who directed himself, deserves praise
for effectively recreating Pollock's last years and for learning to
actually paint like Pollock.  Harris isn't faking it when he hunches
over a blank canvas and splashes paint everywhere.</P>
<P>Harris is also good at capturing some of Pollock's notorious rages. 
It's chilling when Harris starts yelling at a pushy filmmaker and
practically stalks him to the family dinner table, telling him, "I'm not
the phony!  You're the phony!  I'm not the phony!  You're the phony!" 
There is genuine fear in that scene, and it was fear that followed
Pollock from his birth in 1912 to his death in 1956.</P>
<P>In the role of Lee Krasner, Pollock's wife, Marcia Gay Harden is
perfect.  With her thick, New York accent and controlling tendencies,
Harden's Krasner helps drive Pollock's artistic career at a crucial
period.  Unfortunately, there is no context.  Krasner wasn't the only
one who propped up Pollock.  Though patron Peggy Guggenheim, brother
Sande Pollock, and art critic Clement Greenberg are portrayed in
Pollock, missing are the long line of backers that date back to
Pollock's early years.  Where are artists Thomas Hart Benton and John
Graham, whose influence on Pollock is well-chronicled in Naifeh's and
Smith's book?  And where are the legions of therapists and doctors who
worked with Pollock for so many years -- therapists and doctors who
tried getting Pollock to open up about his sexual confusion, his
love-hate relationship with his mother and his lifelong abuse of
alcohol?</P>
<P>None of that is in the movie, which begins in 1941, when Pollock is 29
and starting to make a name for himself.  Pollock ends with a written
note about Pollock's and Krasner's life, but -- at the very least -- the
film should have started with a written note about Pollock's early
years, when his dysfunctional family formed his sense of self.  Too
bad.  Harris had a good chance to flush out the real Jackson Pollock. 
Instead, we get an interesting glimpse of the man who became "America's
first art star."</P>
<P>A final note: Over the years, many people apparently told Harris that he
looks like Pollock, and he does.  The physical resemblance may be one
reason Harris was so devoted to making this film.  (It took 10 years to
bring Pollock's life to the big screen.)  So obsessed was Harris that he
put on 30 pounds to accurately portray Pollock's heavyset last year of
life.  Like Elvis and other artists, Pollock's weight gain was a portent
of a greater physical breakdown.</P>
