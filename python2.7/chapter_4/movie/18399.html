<P>JAWBREAKER
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: ** (out of ****)
TriStar / 1:27 / 1999 / R (language, violence, sexuality)
Cast: Rose McGowan; Rebecca Gayheart; Julie Benz; Judy Greer; Chad 
Christ; Ethan Erickson; Charlotte Roldan; Pam Grier; Carol Kane 
Director: Darren Stein 
Screenplay: Darren Stein<HR>A clique of self-absorbed teen gals rules the hallways of a sunny 
California high school in "Jawbreaker." They accessorize, they 
socialize, and thanks to a prank gone horribly wrong, they pulverize one 
of their own by accident. You're on the right track if you're thinking 
"Heathers," a landmark 1989 black comedy that "Jawbreaker" was intended 
to pay hilarious homage to, but instead plays like a pale imitation of. 
Ten years after its release, "Heathers" still boasts a rabid cult 
following; judging from the looks of things, this slick, stylish, silly 
wannabe will be hidden under several layers of dust in the Blockbuster 
bargain bin long before 2009 rolls around. </P>
<P>To further the comparison quotient, sections of the movie also veer 
dangerously close to "Clueless" and "Very Bad Things," which is ironic 
because it _is_ clueless and chock full of very bad things. Said 
deplorable act opens the film, as three members (Rose McGowan, Rebecca 
Gayheart and Julie Benz) of the afore-mentioned popular quartet surprise 
the fourth (Charlotte Roldan) on the morning of her birthday: they don 
disguises, jostle her from bed, stuff the titular candy in her mouth to 
keep her quiet, and toss her in the trunk of a car. Their intent is to 
take her out for a celebratory pancake breakfast, but the confection 
melts, and she's DOA at the IHOP. Like, whoops. </P>
<P>McGowan's fearless, nasty group leader Courtney, described by somebody 
as "Satan in heels," decides to make the crime scene resemble an assault 
by a male rapist, but their cover is promptly blown by class nerd Fern 
(Judy Evans Greer). What's a psychopathic senior sexpot to do? Why, 
welcome her to the "family," of course. Courtney allows Fern to take the 
unintentional victim's place in their posse in exchange for her silence, 
and the dull meek-into-monstrous makeover subplot that follows isn't the 
slightest bit interesting. Nor is the time devoted to the defection of 
Gayheart's conflicted Julie. She turns out to have a conscience. Not 
good. </P>
<P>Given "Jawbreaker"'s visual flair and deliciously mordant set-up, this 
material could have been steered into flashy, funny "I Know What You Did 
Last Marking Period" territory. But after a satisfyingly loopy first 
quarter, it's clear that this "Jawbreaker"'s center is purely sour. Once 
the body is discovered, Pam Grier shows up as a detective determined to 
crack the case, and the movie discards any humorous sensibilities it 
might have maintained up until that point for unbelievable plot holes 
and unacceptable plot twists. But if Grier seems to have come from 
another film, McGowan deserves one. Her dynamite performance as a cold, 
calculating rhymes-with-witch keeps this mess watchable. </P>
<P>Much of the problem seems to stem from director Darren Stein's sloppy 
screenplay. The rules for successful dark humor state to either ground 
it in disturbing reality or drench it with cartoony meanness. It's 
immensely difficult to cater to both extremes, and that's precisely what 
"Jawbreaker" tries - and fails - to do. Take, for example, the final 
sequence, which is set at the big prom and contains obvious allusions to 
"Carrie." Are we supposed to laugh at what happens? If so, that violates 
the movie's more authentic elements and lets several characters off the 
hook just to finalize things on a cutesy, fantasy-oriented note. No 
wonder "Jawbreaker" ends up being hard to swallow.<HR>© 1999 Jamie Peck

"It presents as comedy things that are not amusing. If you think this 
movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know."
