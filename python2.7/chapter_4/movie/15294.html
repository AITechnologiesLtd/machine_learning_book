<P>If you don't watch Happiness closely, you might think that
writer/director Todd Solondz hates his characters.  It's possible to
dismiss this as a dark, cynical look at a group of morally depraved
nutcases, but Solondz is nicer than that.  In Happiness, he draws an
intricate network of characters who are all messed up in their own ways;
what makes the picture work is the way it draws us in and forces us to
sympathize with people who would typically undergo societal bludgeoning
based on cultural standards.  It's a harsh, shocking film, but it's also
touching and often funny.  In short, it's one of the boldest films of
1998.</P>
<P>Like many independent films, Happiness doesn't center around one
character or storyline, but cuts frequently among a group of people who
are all related in some way.  One of the most prominent characters is
Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), a neo-hippie who can't hold a steady job or a
steady boyfriend.  She's an incredibly nice woman, and very pretty, and
really just wants to make a living by playing the guitar and singing. 
She has two sisters:  Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) and Helen (Lara Flynn
Boyle). </P>
<P>Trish is married to Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), and has two sons,
Timmy (Justin Elvin) and Billy (Rufus Read).  Bill is a psychiatrist,
but he's also deeply disturbed:  aside from having fantasies about
killing innocent people in a park, he's a pederast who masturbates with
the aid of teen magazines.  One of Bill's disturbed patients is Allen
(Philip Seymour Hoffman), a pathetic man who describes himself only as
"boring"; he gathers sexual enjoyment by calling up random women and
verbally raping them.  </P>
<P>If this sounds like a colorful band of hateful people, then my
descriptions aren't doing them justice.  Indeed, they are all people
with severe problems, but Solondz observes his characters with
sympathy.  Take Joy, for example:  she's such a nice woman.  She may be
a little naive, but I never wanted anything bad to happen to her.  But
bad things keep happening to her -- she gets used by a Russian taxi
driver, an ex-boyfriend commits suicide because of her, her family
thinks of her as a failure (just to name a few things).  Every time
something bad happened to her, I wanted to give her a hug.  Adams is so
perfect for this role -- she has a kind, sweet face, and demure
mannerisms.  And she hangs in there, even when everything goes wrong.</P>
<P>But Joy is one of the easier characters to take.  It's harder to find
sympathy in Allen, because the prank calls he makes are so malicious. 
Hoffman is a superb, versatile actor -- you might not even recognize him
from some of his previous films (including Twister, The Big Lebowski,
and Next Stop Wonderland); his portrayal of Allen, with that gravelly,
fluctuating voice and squinting eyes, is simultaneously grating and
endearing.  Through Hoffman's subtleties, we are able to understand
Allen.  One of Solondz' greatest moments is halfway through the film: 
just when we think Allen is as pathetic is they come, he introduces us
to a large woman (Camryn Manheim) who falls for him.</P>
<P>In fact, all of the performances are first-rate, even in the smaller
roles.  Ben Gazzara and Louise Lasser, as the sisters' parents, convince
us perfectly of a couple who have been married forty years.  Lara Flynn
Boyle is wonderful as the pretentious artistic sister, and Stevenson is
also dead-on as the wife who thinks she has everything.  The most
important performance in the film, however, comes from Dylan Baker.  I
was deeply moved by his performance as Bill Maplewood:  here is a man
that, by society's standards, is nothing but a monster -- he rapes young
boys.  This is all most people need to hear in order to hate someone.  </P>
<P>But Solondz, while observing the act as a sickness, doesn't exploit it
by making Bill a monster.  He loves his son, and cares about his
family.  But he can't help himself, and while we don't excuse him for
that, we forgive him.  Ironically, that's where the controversy over
Happiness is coming from -- the picture makes us uncomfortable by
affirming the humanity of a man who does horrible things.  Baker's
performance is perfect -- he hints at his problem without making it
obvious to his family, but we always know that it's right there, fueling
everything he does.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Happiness escapes greatness in the last ten minutes. 
Inevitably, Bill Maplewood is caught and disgraced.  But Solondz shows
us a scene in which Bill explains his crime to his son; this scene is
deeply affecting, but in the wrong way -- it reveals things about both
characters that I don't find believable, and it requires a conversation
to take place that doesn't seem realistic.  In fact, the entire
storyline is hindered by this scene.  Then, in an epilogue that feels
tacked-on, we are exposed to some gratuitously low humor that seems like
it belongs in There's Something About Mary.  But most of the film is so
good and insightful that any complaints I make seem largely
insignificant.  Todd Solondz' Happiness admits that real people have
severe problems, and by making us like his characters despite their
failings, he shows us in a very subtle way how nice it would be if were
were all more tolerant of one another.</P>
