<P>Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens (1979) 93m</P>
<P>If this manic, lurid, plotless sex romp had been the only thing ever made by 
writer-director-producer-editor Russ Meyer, it would no doubt have become an 
instant classic.  It still has, as far as its fans are concerned.  It turned 
out to be my introduction to Meyer, double-billed with SUPERVIXENS (talk 
about being thrown off the deep end) so I was able to enjoy it more than 
Meyer devotees who had already seen better films like MUDHONEY and FASTER, 
PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL!  Here's the story: a narrator (Stuart Lancaster) 
introduces us to diverse characters populating Small Town, USA, who spend 
the next hour and a half jumping into bed (and rivers, and bathtubs, et al) 
with each other.  Most of the 'action' revolves around sexually frustrated 
Ken Kerr and unsatisfied wife Kitten Natividad (Meyer's girlfriend at the 
time) getting it on with a variety of partners.</P>
<P>What makes Meyer's films unique among other skin flicks is his dexterity as 
a film-maker, most notably his energetic editing which inserts 
flash-forwards and cross-cutting to humorous effect.  His characters are 
larger than life - oversexed, fervent, bitchy, and (if they're female) 
astonishingly proportioned.  He fills his frame with hicks and white trash 
and then films them at tilted angles against bright cartoony colors.  When 
Meyer first attracted a following, movie buffs figured that he was too smart 
a talent to be involved with grindhouse material.  However when he strayed 
from the independent scene and worked on the studio projects FANNY HILL, THE 
SEVEN MINUTES and BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, the results fell short of 
expectations.  Meyer returned to indie adult fare, eventually calling it a 
day with BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRA VIXENS (even though a further 
'Vixens' episode was promised in the final credits).  To compare ULTRA 
VIXENS with a much earlier Meyer film, WILD GALS OF THE NAKED WEST, is to 
see a lack of stylistic development despite the gulf of years and 
experience.  Both are a series of lewd, comic vignettes filmed in the 
trademark Meyer fashion - the main difference is that ULTRA VIXENS is a lot 
more graphic.  Not only does Meyer up the ante on the sexual couplings but 
the breasts of the heroines are even bigger than in his previous films.  In 
his early days, Meyer was spoofing the genre; in ULTRA VIXENS he is spoofing 
himself (he even dubs in his own flatulence for the sex scenes!).  It's an 
amplification of everything that has gone before, but at least this time 
Meyer backs off from the rape and violence that was beginning to infuse his 
work (in BLACKSNAKE it had become so over-the-top it was more ludicrous than 
offensive).  In ULTRA-VIXENS the hot-tempered characters still have 
fistfights, but instead of blood they spill brightly colored paint.</P>
<P>Is ULTRA VIXENS worth seeing?  Yes: it is deliciously crude and well-made 
cinema.  But it's probably a good thing that Meyer quit when he did.  
There's a telling moment when he appears at the film's end, toting his 
camera about and wondering where his crew has gotten to.  Perhaps he knew he 
couldn't really top ULTRA VIXENS without descending straight into porn, 
which was fast becoming big business with the advent of home video 
technology.  Or maybe there's an even more insidious reason - with the 
proliferation of breast implants, every actress was becoming a potential 
Meyer performer, and the 'King of the Nudies' no doubt had too much of an 
eye for natural beauty to accept substitutes (the talents on display in the 
opening scene are highly suspect!).  In the meantime stacked women appeared 
in everything from teen comedies to music videos.  It wasn't censorship or 
economics that killed Russ Meyer.  It was silicone.</P>
