<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A potbellied, 54-year-old noted architect from Chicago, Stourley
Kracklite (Brian Dennehy), and his much younger wife, Louisa (Chloe
Webb), come to Rome by train, where he makes his grand entrance by
having sex with her as they arrive in Italy. He will be the director of
an art exhibition that is being planned on the obscure 18th-century
French architect Etienne-Louis Boullee.</P>
<P>The couple are feted with toasts and a sugar cake replica of one of
Boullee's buildings by their hosts, the father of a family financing the
exhibition -- and a brother and sister -- Flavia (Stefania Casini) and
Caspasian (Lambert Wilson). Boullee has been the most influential
architect in the life of Kracklite, and he has spent the last ten years
preparing for this exhibition to honor him, while the Italians see this
exhibit as a chance for them to gain world recognition and for that they
need a prestigious American architect like Kracklite to sell the project
to the art patrons.</P>
<P>During the course of his stay in Rome, Kracklite will be undergoing a
series of psychological and physical mishaps. His stay will be for nine
months, the time it takes for Louisa to give birth and for Kracklite to
end his life, as he eventually finds out that he is dying from stomach
cancer. At first, he will develop stomach problems and blame this on his
wife, whom he thinks is trying to poison him. He will also become
extremely jealous of the attention the serpentine, youthfully handsome,
thin waist lined architect, Caspasian, is paying to his wife. He will
eventually, after the couple is there for three months, push his wife
into having an affair with Caspasian as he becomes impossible to live
with, developing an obsession about his belly and his mortality.
Caspasian will notice that she is pregnant before her husband does, a
pregnancy which came about on the train coming into Rome. Her husband
doesn't notice she is pregnant until she tells him, as he does not look
at her stomach, being that he is so preoccupied with his.</P>
<P>Sacha Vierny, as cinematographer, supplies the film with striking
visuals, every scene is beautiful to behold. The technicolors of favor
for the film are the different shades of brown resembling the marvelous
architecture in Rome and the pure shades of white, which tend to
introduce the characters in their best light, before it becomes apparent
that they are all obnoxious to a certain degree and not as pure as they
first might have seemed.</P>
<P>Peter Greenaway (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover/The Pillow
Book/Prospero's Books) made use in this film of many diverse
metaphorical themes: while giving us a lesson about architecture and
deriding how money from patrons is what drives the arts. He also tells
about Isaac Newton's influence to the world, about Augustus and his wife
Livia who poisoned him, Kracklite's stomach problems, and the artist as
an egotist. The hero of the story is in the middle of a mid-life crises,
where it seems everything is rapidly going down the tubes for him. His
feelings are wounded, his sufferings are gargantuan, and he is about to
lose his wife and control of the exhibit to his architect rival
Caspasian, and eventually he will tragically lose his life. He resembles
Boullee, in that they are both known for producing few works and not
finishing what they start, and that they were both hypochondriacs.</P>
<P>This film like all Greenaway productions, is a splendid visual film to
behold. Brian Dennehy comes up with a big performance, towering over
others even in his downfall. The most emotional scene, has him looking
through a keyhole and watching his wife screw Caspasian. The film might
not add up to much in weight, but the sum of its parts were like an
apple hitting Newton on his noggin. It had one mesmorizing visual scene
after another, and gave one enough fodder to think about all the
spiritual and corporeal themes it just spread before your eyes without
going further into them. Greenaway, as always, is an acquired taste.</P>
