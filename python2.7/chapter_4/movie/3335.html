<PRE>                             ONCE WERE WARRIORS
                       A film review by Krishin Asnani
                        Copyright 1995 Krishin Asnani</PRE>
<P>     "Sharp Edged" were the words that floated through my mind when I
saw the film from New Zealand called ONCE WERE WARRIORS last night
at the chi-chi Paris theater that is adjacent to the very elegantly
arching Grace building outside of which are trees with very pretty
yellow flickering lights.  As I walked back to the car after the film
in the freezing night with my hands firmly planted in the pockets of my
jacket, none of this beatific scenery outside helped me escape the film
which remained lodged in my mind long after it was over.</P>
<P>     The opening shot of the film is a picture-perfect postcard view of
New Zealand's pristine mountains.  We quickly realize this is a
billboard poster as the camera pans away from it to reveal a highway
and the dilapidated neighbourhood under it which forms the stark canvas
of this film.  The attention grabbing opening credits with the hip-hop
music juxtaposed with very short bluesy guitar riffs set up the brutal
tone for the film.</P>
<P>     We are in the home of the Heke family who are descendents of the
Maori tribe.  This tribe has urbanized itself but the members of the
family still have varying degrees of ties to the tribe and its
rituals.  Jake is the brutal-looking and very muscular father who wears
small tattoos on his neck and like every member of the member wears
leather paraphernalia-all characters in this film look like they belong
to a motorcycle gang; Beth is the mother whose face has many
similarities to Jeane Moreau though her mouth is not pointed downward
like Moreau's and therefore Beth's smile is quite sensuous. (Janet
Maslin at the Times actually sees the connection between Beth and
Moreau).  Her broad forehead, silky golden hair, and a very angular and
high cheekboned face convey a sense of congeniality and are pointers to
her Maori roots.</P>
<P>     Jake and Beth have five children who occupy two rooms.  One night
the boozy and recently unemployed Jake brings home his huge party of
drunkard friends who also belong to the Maori tribe who don the same
type of costume as the Hekes; they have a grand time sitting around the
living room, drinking and crooning melodious tunes-there is one by Jake
and Beth that is really quite affecting.  The children sleeping in the
next room remark that alcohol brings out the true feelings of love.
Beth's bliss is very short-lived, a fight breaks out between Jake and
Beth and this is probably the scene that will rattle you and make you
recoil-the vividness of Jake's brutal and vicious violence is so acute
that you just can't look at the screen but before you know it its
over-your eyes have no chance to bolt.  The exquisite and the
expressive face of Beth is battered.  And the "true feelings of love"
are very scarce at that point.  Not to sound too cold but the editing
of this scene is remarkable.</P>
<P>     This has been going on for most of the sixteen years of their
marriage; Beth endures the husband for the sake of the children.  Jake
can be a real charmer and that makes Beth forgive him.  His charm is
phony and there was never a doubt in my mind that Jake is a very two
dimensional man, all his impulses are excessive: his violence, his
eating and drinking, and his love-making.  There is absolutely no sense
of balance let alone self-doubt to him.  After this first flare-up, his
physical menace is always at the back of our minds.  Besides Beth, some
of the patrons at a local bar become his punching bags too.  The
nihilistic onlookers display very little alarm.  The man who plays Jake
(Temeura Morrison) actually plays a very well-likable doctor in a New
Zealand soap opera.  What a transformation this man must have gone
through to play the role of Jake.</P>
<P>     Beth's face has had such a workout that she is unable to go to
court next day to prevent her younger son from being taken into a state
welfare institution.  This son, by the end of the film, achieves some
measure of identity--thanks to the teacher at the institute who is able
to channelize the son's energy into learning Maori rituals.  These
rituals performed by the disaffected yet trying to reform youth are a
form of martial-arts dance that is accompanied by their beautiful
chanting.  The direction of these scenes is handled with panache,
stylization and theatrics that only an experienced director would be
capable of.  Surprisingly, this is director Lee Tamahori's debut film.</P>
<P>     An older son takes refuge in a gang that has strong ties to the
Maori tribe: the members wear very creative tattoos on their faces and
their entire body and their uniform is all leather and chains.  The
initiation rites are brutal but are exquisitely well photographed.
Grace, the 13 year daughter in the family is the only sane child with a
very innocent face that exudes equanimity in this violent home.  Her
best friend is a soulful, chain-smoking, dreadlock-wearing homeless boy
who lives inside a junked car under a highway.</P>
<P>     The relationship between Beth and Grace is well explored in a
scene which occurs few days after the violence and Jake has apologized
to Beth.  The family takes a trip in their new car to see their younger
son in the institution.  On their way, they stop at a picnic spot to
revel in nostalgia of their former lives as tribe members.  These
scenes are magical in their lyricism, the scenery of the picnic spot is
breathtaking.  They get back in the car and Jake and Beth sing along to
a pop song blaring out from their car radio.</P>
<P>     Again, this bliss is transitory: on their way to the institution,
Jake stops at a bar for one beer only (he promises) while the family
waits for him in the car.  After half an hour, when Beth goes in to get
him, he shouts at her in a way that will make anyone tremble to stop
interrupting him from watching the horse races on the tele.  At this
point Beth is convinced that she has to dig herself out of this
dysfunctional marriage.</P>
<P>     After yet another heartfelt tragedy that will go unmentioned here,
Beth lectures Jake on the greatness of her tribe and how its
characteristics are different from Jake's.  The speech is didactic, and
it is delivered with great passion: the only face on the screen is
Beth's, the wind makes her hair sway back revealing the steely
determination of her clear blue eyes in a broad face that deserves a
lot better fate.</P>
<P>     The film is supposed to be an exercise that explores the
rootlessness of this tribe, the politics of how they deal with the
present society that knows very little about them and the past that
they have little connection to.  It has become the most popular film in
the history of New Zealand and deserves to be be in the Top 10 lists of
US critics at the end of 1995.  The director is very talented, has
found an interesting topic to explore and has many talented friends in
the sound, editing, music and cinematography departments and all pitch
in to give this the film a raw, industrial, and a very professional
look.</P>
<P>     For me, the personal was far more engaging than the political.</P>
