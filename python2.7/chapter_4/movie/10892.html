<P>    Woody Allen's new comedy is funny, thank goodness, 'cause it ain't
moving, charming, or even particularly believable.  For starters, he's
miscast himself.  Allen lacks the... gravity to effectively portray
Harry Block, a pill-poppin', booze-swillin', whore-frequenting, thrice-
married bestselling author to whom the following is happening:  (a.)
he's suffering from writer's block, (b.) he's enduring the wraith of
friends and family members who take offense to his habit of basing his
work on his life, and (c.) he's now being visited by those semi-fiction-
al creations.  (Initially, Allen cuts between scenes from Block's life
and scenes from Block's stories.  Later, he begins blending both.)
Smaller roles are filled by a dozen other stars, the spotting of which
is as distracting as the fact that they rarely come alive in their
roles.  (Too often, the film feels like a stage play, with actors
hurling monologues-- or, Allen's case, one-liners-- at each other.)</P>
<P>    The anxious, almost frantic pace is also a challenge, as is trying
to keep track of which ex-wife, ex-girlfriend, or other love interest is
being referenced in a given scene.  (And really, Woody, isn't it about
time to start casting *older* actresses for these parts?) Admittedly,
the movie *is* side-splitting.  (My faves:  gags on Death, Hell, and
Darth Vader.)  And it's profane!  (How many blowjob jokes did you
count?) Too bad it's so empty.  Do you know what a black hole is?  One
question:  why is Billy Crystal the only actor who plays both his char-
acter and the fictional take on his character?  He gives a devilishly
good performance, though...</P>
