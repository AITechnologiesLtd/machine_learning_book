<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A comedy flavored by hippie nostalgia for the '60s. It has its moments
of reliving the past before it turns into a silly and unimportant film,
which could only say things that are clichés. The film is enjoyable for
Dennis Hopper's comic performance as Huey Walker, a nonstop talker and
once famous protest movement jester, who 20 years ago pulled a prank on
Vice President Spiro Agnew, of disconnecting his train car while he was
on a political whistle-stop speaking tour in the Northwest, stopping off
at Spokane, Washington. This earned the publicity seeking protester a
picture of himself on the cover of Life dressed as a clown, but as the
years rolled by, he became a forgotten figure by the public. He is now
being held as an escaped felon, as an anonymous call tells the FBI where
to arrest him in San Francisco. John Buckner is the twenty-six-year-old
uptight, duty-bound, yuppie, reactionary FBI agent who is asked by the
his boss, Mr. Stark (Dooley), to bring him by train to Spokane for a
court date.</P>
<P>Before the film looses its grip on its subject matter and becomes too
contrived and lightweight, as the opposing parties wind up on the same
side -- it had some sparkling scenes with the hippie conversing with the
stone-faced FBI man. When Huey asks John what's so good about President
Reagan's administration, he is told that he straightened out the
economy, to which Huey replies: "Yeah, he created two classes, the truly
greedy and the truly needy."</P>
<P>While cuffed on the train and playing chess with John, Huey tells him
that he slipped LSD into his mineral water. John becomes panic stricken
and asks the conductor to get him a doctor. He comes back with nurse
Sparkle (York), but she's really a hooker, whom Huey gives money to have
sex with the agent, who is now drunk from drinking tequila as a cure-all
Huey recommends for coming down from a trip. Huey shaves his beard, cuts
his long hair, dons the agent's dark blue suit, flashes his badge at the
train stop in Marsden, Oregon, where he meets Sheriff (Hightower),
posing with his disheveled and incapacitated prisoner. This is a
scheduled stop arranged by the FBI in order to place the prisoner in the
local jail while the agent grabs two hours sleep before getting back on
the train.</P>
<P>Sheriff Hightower proceeds to beat the prisoner while he is in his
custody, angered that this weirdo shows him no respect, while Huey still
dressed as an FBI agent, goes into a local bar and meets two middle-aged
men who tell him they were once hippies and admired Huey Walker. This
briefly encourages Huey, because he is feeling down that no one
remembers him anymore, disgusted that the hippies are a forgotten
culture in the 1980s. He also called his book agent to see if he could
get his book published, since it was Huey himself who called the FBI,
arranging for the arrest as a publicity stunt for the book he wrote
while on the run. Huey is told by the agent that there is still not
enough publicity, he'll have to die before a book gets published.</P>
<P>The sympathetic men to Huey at the bar are now members of the
Establishment, Barry (Masur) and Hal (McKean). They get irritated that
Huey, still posing as the FBI agent, is bragging he got Huey in his
custody. To show they still have some rebel in their makeup, they kidnap
the FBI agent, calling the sheriff to tell him they want to exchange the
FBI man for Huey. At this point the film breaks down into the absurd and
the comedy comes in dribbles instead of gushes, as the running gag over
mistaken identity comes to a brutal end.</P>
<P>The corrupt sheriff, who is running to be a congressman, is told by the
boiling mad John Buckner, at the bridge, where Huey is unwittingly
returned to him, that he is going to bring him up on charges of police
brutality. The sheriff decides he better frame the FBI agent for
abetting the prisoner in the escape, or else he is a doomed candidate.
Buckner recognizes how capable of even murder the sheriff is and escapes
with Huey into the woods.</P>
<P>The story keeps getting sillier and sillier by the minute, as it turns
out John Buckner is not his real name (his real name is Free) and that
his parents were hippies living in a nearby commune, where the agent
takes Huey (If he grew up in a commune, how could he have been faked out
to think that Huey dropped acid into his drink???). They are met there
by the last remaining hippie at the commune, Maggie (Kane), a friend of
Free's parents. The film turns into a nostalgia museum piece of how the
hippies lived back then and Buckner explains how he wanted to grow up
drinking Coca-Cola instead of carrot juice, that he wanted to be the
opposite of his parents, so he fabricated a middle-class upbringing and
joined the FBI.</P>
<P>By this time I was forgetting how much I enjoyed Hopper's manic but
egotistical performance and wanted the film to end before it lost all
its appeal for those who were hippies back then. There's lots of '60s
music in the background to remember the past, such as, Dylan songs,
Hendrix and Grace Slick singing, and there is enough hippie memorabilia
crammed into the story to give an aging hippie a temporary high. But the
film itself, it was irrelevant.</P>
