<PRE>THREE FACES OF BRUCE</PRE>
<PRE>DISNEY'S THE KID</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Jon Turtletaub</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay by Audrey Wells</PRE>
<PRE>With Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin</PRE>
<PRE>UA North    PG    101 min</PRE>
<P>     Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is an overbearing, insulting, obnoxious 
PR consultant.  When he's called a jerk four times in one scene, he asks 
his assistant Amy (Emily Mortimer) if that makes it true.  "No," she 
says, "four times is a pattern.  It takes five times to be a fact."  
Shortly thereafter she calls him a jerk, and that was good enough for 
me.</P>
<P>     The premise of this comedy is that Russ needs serious help from his 
inner child to overcome his personality impediment, and through the 
magic of Disney, that help incarnates as his 8-year-old self, Rusty 
(Spencer Breslin).   Nobody seems to have much trouble accepting this 
curious phenomenon, and there's precious little explanation of how it 
happened, but Rusty looks as if he may have climbed out of a Campbell's 
Soup can. </P>
<P>     Of all the under-explained phenomena in the movie, the 
undermost-explained is why people like Russ so much.  On the one hand 
we're shown what an obnoxious prick he is, and on the other we see 
people beaming at him and falling in love with him.  Maybe it's because 
he looks like Bruce Willis.  Amy admits that every time she's ready to 
leave, she gets a glimpse of the kid in him, and she just melts.</P>
<P>     Russ has spent his adult life overcoming the dweeb he was as a kid, 
and little Rusty is no more pleased to see how he turns out ("A dogless, 
chickless guy with a tick!")  The challenge is for each to change the 
other, and this movie has no conscience about that old "never mess with 
the past" caveat.  There's a surprise guest appearance by yet a third 
Russ character to round things off.</P>
<P>      Willis, who seems to have partitioned his career into the action 
Bruce Willis and the sensitive Bruce Willis here again shows his sweet, 
child-loving side, and Breslin overcomes some inept early scenes (but 
heck, he's only 8) to do an ingratiating job.  Best are Lily Tomlin as 
Russ's wry secretary ("How's Mini-you?"), and Jean Smart (Guinevere) as 
an understanding client.  A witty screenplay by Audrey Wells (Guinevere) 
helps carry this movie safely into the "fun for the family" zone.  But 
it's not recommended for diabetics.</P>
