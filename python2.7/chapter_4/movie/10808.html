College (1927)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"College" is a silent film starring Buster Keaton.  It is
loaded with slapstick gags, most of which succeed.  Two Keaton
trademarks are missing here: there are no stunts to speak of,
and the plot does not center on transportation (no boats,
trains or automobiles star in this picture).</P>
<P>Keaton plays a nerdy Valedictorian graduate at high school.
He wants to win "the most popular girl in school", but she
prefers athletes.  Now at college, Keaton tries out for the
baseball and track teams in order to impress her.  Keaton,
of course, is a spectacular failure at every athletic event
he attempts.  More slapstick occurs as Keaton works at 
part-time jobs.</P>
<P>In this, as in other Keaton silent films, his character makes 
a sudden (and unlikely) transition from klutz to hero.
In the climax, Keaton executes flawlessly all the track and field
events that he was such a flop at earlier in the picture.</P>
<P>"College" was made the same year as "The General".  However,
it is not nearly as compelling.  Perhaps this is because
James Horne and not Keaton is credited as Director.  Perhaps
the shorter length puts the focus on a series of gags rather
than developing character or broadening the plot.  But
"College" simply isn't very ambitious: it succeeds as a
comedy, but the lack of drama limits the film.</P>
