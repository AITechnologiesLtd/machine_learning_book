<P>     If we learned anything during those lazy Saturday afternoon sci-fi
film festivals of our youth, it's that there's nothing more fun than
watching the end of the world.  WAR OF THE WORLDS ... INVASION OF THE
BODY SNATCHERS ... THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE ... great disaster flicks
from an era when our fears were fueled by the space race and the arms
race.  Decades later, those fears are still there. Only now we've
traded our space suits for bio suits.</P>
<P>     In the super-creepy OUTBREAK--which has nothing to do with the
Richard Preston bestseller CRISIS IN THE HOT ZONE--the threat is the
deadly Motaba virus, which has spread from the African jungle to the
sleepy California community Cedar Creek.  The disease is 100%
contagious and 100% fatal.  The victims bleed from the inside out.</P>
<P>     Only one scientist (Dustin Hoffman) knows how bad the situation
really is, and, of course, he's the lone voice of logic against every
possible cliche, from the ex-wife colleague (Rene Russo) to the
skeptical military commander (Morgan Freeman).  He even has a
wet-behind-the-ears sidekick!</P>
<P>     Director Wolfgang Petersen turns the screws very effectly, even if
he paces the film like a sequel to SPEED.  The are very few pauses in
the first ninety minutes, so some scenes seem rushed.  No problem,
There's still *plenty* of paranoia to go around.  The sight of soliders
barricading a quarantined town is something to see.  As is a
single-take tour of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for
Infectious Diseases.  The best, by far, is a sequence showing airborne
microbes spewing from a coughing patron in a movie theater!</P>
<PRE>     Tissue, anyone?</PRE>
<P>     The whole thing works very well until the final reel, at which
point the film falls apart.  Credit a pair of tacked-on helicopter
chases and a completely unnecessary confrontation between Morgan
Freeman and Donald Sutherland (as a goofy general).  The added action
is pretty stupid, and it almost causes an important plot point to get
glossed over.  But who am I to argue with audience testers?</P>
<PRE>CAMEO NOTE:  Watch for an unbilled appearance by J. T. Walsh, who wanders
             through a single scene at the White House.  Is there a rule
             that requires him to appear in *every* thriller involving a
             conspiracy?</PRE>
<P>BOTTOM LINE:  Contagious fun with a lousy ending.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B-</PRE>
