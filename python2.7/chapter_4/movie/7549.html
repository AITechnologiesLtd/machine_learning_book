<P>'FATHERS' DAY' IS A PLEASANT ENOUGH FORMULA FOR WILLIAMS AND CRYSTAL</P>

<P>Film buffs have waited for quite sometime to see the teaming of two of
Hollywood's funniest men.  Robin Wiliams and Billy Crystal have finally
pulled it off with hilarious results in 'Father's Day'.  This film reportedly
took about thirteen agents between the two stars to close the deal and their
names appear on screen at the same time during the opening credits and while
Robin Williams' career seems to be sagging a little bit lately, it's Crystal
who needs a hit.</P>
<P>Crystal plays a high powered California lawyer while Williams plays a failed
writer on the verge of suicide.  They don't know each other until each one of
them is contacted by a former girlfriend (Nastassja Kinski) who tells them
separately that they are each the father of her sixteen year old son.  The
meet under bizarre circumstances while searching for the boy and they soon
work together in trying to find him.  </P>
<P>The screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel ('Splash', 'Gung Ho',
'Parenthood', 'City Slickers', 'Greedy') contains enough of their jokes which
some find offensive but others find their humour squirmingly funny.  Director
Ivan Reitman ('Stripes', 'Ghostbusters', 'Twins') finds a formula good enough
to make this comic escapade work as he relies on allowing the two leads to
improvise many scenes which make them such brilliant comedians.  </P>
<P>Seventy per cent of the movie's laughs come from Robin Williams but I'm sure
if you ask him about the film's success he'll tell you that the success of a
lot of comedy films depends largely on the straight man which Crystal plays
in a professional manner almost without blinking.  </P>
<P>A word of caution.  You may never use an outhose again after seeing this
movie and look quickly for an almost unrecognizable Mel Gibson!</P>
