<P>     For the life of me, I don't know why any film-maker would take on the
thankless task of literary adaptation. If he takes too many liberties
(see: Roland Joffe's THE SCARLET LETTER), he risks derision. If he is too
scrupulously faithful (see: ANGELA'S ASHES), he risks creating a narrative
without its own identity as a film. You don't want to infuriate fans of
the source material (Paul Verhoeven's STARSHIP TROOPERS), and you don't
want to sacrifice a unique artistic perspective just to get every detail
right (THE GREEN MILE). Guaranteed name recognition comes with a price. 
It is, simultaneously, a can't-miss and a can't-win proposition.</P>
<P>     If Anthony Minghella feels that pressure, he sure doesn't show it. He
squeezed and compacted THE ENGLISH PATIENT's complex narrative, and came
up with a beautiful old-fashioned romantic drama. Now, in taking on
Patricia Highsmith's THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, he has completely re-made
the story's titular morally-ambiguous protagonist. The result may give
purists fits, but it's a strangely invigorating piece of psychological
suspense. Matt Damon plays Tom Ripley, a young New Yorker living just
close enough to lives of privilege to understand he doesn't live one
himself. A unique opportunity arises when shipbuilding magnate Herbert
Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) offers to send Tom to Italy, believing Tom to be
a college classmate of his son Dickie (Jude Law). Greenleaf wants the
free-living Dickie to return home, and hopes his "friend" Tom can persuade
him. Tom, however, finds Dickie's life of expatriate revelry  far too
fascinating to be concerned with much besides ingratiating himself into it
-- by any means necessary.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with Highsmith's novel will remember Ripley as a con
artist (he uses his address and IRS letterhead to collect "underpaid
taxes" from naive self-employed artists) who coolly considers murdering
Dickie. Minghella is more interested in the Tom who initially sees his
trip to Europe as a fresh start, and whose actions snowball into something
he can no longer control.  Minghella's RIPLEY turns Tom into something far
more than an admittedly fascinating portrait of amorality. He's a man
obsessed with fitting in who ultimately has no chance of fitting in -- a
twisted knot of self-loathing, self-justification, fear, exhilaration and
calculation. Those who would knock Matt Damon's unconventionally creepy
performance as too bright-eyed aren't looking at Tom Ripley the way I
think Minghella wants us to look at him: as a fellow unable to stop
himself from performing his entire life in search of acceptance for
something he's not.</P>
<P>     Minghella combines this twisty characterization with direction that
occasionally leans too heavily on visual metaphor. When Dickie discovers
Tom playing dress-up with his clothes, Tom hides behind a mirror, his head
appearing above a reflection of Dickie; when Dickie's fiancee Marge
(Gwyneth Paltrow) confronts Tom with suspicions of his duplicity, he
stands before her (literally) exposed. The cues can feel a bit 
heavy-handed, but Minghella can also stage scenes where tension appears in
unexpected ways -- a shouted confession unheard, a lingering moment caught
in the space between two lies. It's one thing to direct actors well, which
Minghella certainly does here (Philip Seymour Hoffman is particularly fine
as an icily condescending ugly American). It's rarer to find someone who
can find all the right notes in character interaction, from the turn of a
phrase to the placement of an uncomfortable silence.</P>
<P>     Many viewers are likely to be put off by THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY's
less-than-tidy conclusion, which serves as a bookend to the film's
arresting opening shot. Of course, that's just one of the many ways that
Anthony Minghella risks losing his audience. He interrupts a relationship
drama with a bloody confrontation; he changes some characters from the
novel radically, and introduces new ones. His interpretation of THE
TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is undeniably a departure from Highsmith, but it's a
departure that works the way any thoughtful re-interpretation can work. 
The talented Mr. Minghella has fashioned a seductive, sad portrait of a
man helplessly watching the loss of his own soul. It may be fitting that
Tom Ripley, master chameleon, has taken on yet another new shape for this
version of his story.</P>
