<PRE>                              TITANIC 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
              3 :-) :-) :-)  for James and the sinking ship</PRE>
<P>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Frances Fisher, Kathy
Bates, David Warner, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart. Screenplay: James
Cameron. Director: James Cameron.</P>
<P>This movie will be remembered as James Cameron's ultimate labour of
love. With nothing denied the unborn child from conception to delivery.
Described as both meticulous and a perfectionist, Cameron the doting
father, has doted, doted, and doted 200 million away. Now the big fat
Turkey is ready for Thanksgiving. Slaughter it and serve it with lush
sauce and amaze those who are the most ready to applaud or shun the big,
fat juicy bird. Fortunately, the critics and the public are pleased with
the offering, and TITANIC is on its way to scooping a big mouthful of
titillating praise and a big handful of golden awards. Cameron seems to
have played his hand just right.  Delaying the monster's release from
mid-year to end-year, away from the other monster child releases ready
to take away attention from his spoilt offspring.</P>
<P>The December winter can only be as cold as the sinking water's of the
TITANIC. This will only warm the hearts of audiences as they watch
enough tragic love erupt on screen to melt ice caps. Throw in fine young
actors like Leornado Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who both know how to
deliver a thoughtful script and whose undeniable screen presence,
transforms this otherwise ordinary disaster movie into the biggest love
story of the decade. The story is central, and without it TITANIC would
have been that sinking disaster SPEED 2 was. These young lovers engage
us with their hopeful tale of love, which transcends social class and
breeches cultural differences in order to find each other. As their love
blossoms, they are faced with challenges uncommon to young couples in
love. Shot, chained, trapped beneath flooded decks, only the icy waters
of death itself can separate these two young lovers. Cameron knows that
these characters are vital to this movie's survival, and wisely brings
them to the forefront of the picture before breathtakingly sinking the
big ship. That way we actually care about what happens, and in many ways
separates this adaptation from the other 101 TITANIC versions of the
same over told story.</P>
<P>There is also much else to compliment besides saying that the baby is a
joy to watch. Namely, the soundtrack the vital thread of heartbeat
sewing pieces of an epic together, carries with it the same breath of
emotion ready to sweep you away with tears of sorrow and mirth. The
costumes and sets have been lifted straight from the pages of late
nineteenth century living, and neither can be faulted or criticised for
the time period believability factor. Cameron has spared no expense in
this department, as has exerted himself to bring the TITANIC back from
the grave as realistically and gloriously as it was first envisioned.
The ‘Ship of Dreams' it was called, and Cameron has had to work damned
hard to make this dream come true.</P>
<P>My final comments are well done James. There is little to fault about
this movie except that it is a long sit, and if this is my only
complaint about this carefully crafted masterpiece, then I have only
myself to blame for being a overtly impatient person.</P>
