Reviewed by Dustin Putman, April 4, 2001.</P>
<P>For someone who has directed a blood-drenched $5,000 indie about a mariachi 
with a gun disguised as a guitar holder (1993's "El Mariachi"), a ghastly, 
foul-mouthed vampire epic (1996's "From Dusk Till Dawn"), and a high 
school-set horror movie about alien teachers (1998's "The Faculty"), it would 
seem like an odd choice for director Robert Rodriguez to next choose a family 
film, but that is what he has done. Then again, as he has proven thus far in 
his career, Rodriguez is completely disinterested in following a conventional 
filmmaking pattern, instead making any given movie in any genre that he feels 
like.</P>
<P>"Spy Kids" is a fun-filled, if slight, children's variation on James Bond, 
with two child protagonists, lots of action, spiffy special effects, and an 
overabundance of neat gadgets. There are no life-threateniong weapons to be 
found here, nor is there any graphic violence, proving that it is possible to 
make a quality action movie that the entire family will be able to enjoy 
equally.</P>
<P>Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) are siblings who live in peace 
and happiness with their parents, Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid 
Cortez (Carla Gugino). As Ingrid spins fascinating bedtime stories night 
after night about star-crossed lovers who originally were international spies 
on opposing sides, until they married and settled down, Carmen and Juni have 
no idea that the tales are actually about their own mother and father. 
Gregorio and Ingrid love their children, but after years of downtime, they 
thirst for their old jobs as spies, and quickly go off on an assignment. Not 
being as quick-witted as they once were, they are quickly captured by Fegan 
Floop (Alan Cumming), a dastardly children's show host who is planning to 
take over the world by creating robotic replicas of every child in existence. 
When Fegan's evil henchmen, including two played by Teri Hatcher (1996's "2 
Days in the Valley") and Robert Patrick ("The Faculty"), come looking for the 
Cortez offsprings, it is up to Juni and Carmen to go on the run, all the 
while setting off to rescue their parents.</P>
<P>While far from perfect, "Spy Kids" is an intermittently dynamite 
entertainment that, sure enough, manages to be exciting, with hair-raising 
stunts and plenty of non-violent fight scenes that have no danger of 
offending anyone. The visual effects are creative and mostly believable, 
particularly for the picture's relatively low $30-million budget, as they 
include underwater and aerial chases, a place called the Virtual Room that 
puts the characters into different settings that only appear to be there, and 
floors that drop out like jigsaw puzzles.</P>
<P>In transporting a James Bond thriller into a family movie, the screenplay, 
also by Robert Rodriguez, is imaginative and light-hearted, as he also throws 
in a few odes to his previous movies, including a very funny slow-motion shot 
of Carmen and Juni coolly walking down the aisle of a department store, 
equipped with sunglasses and long, draping clothing. I could have most 
definitely done without, however, some of the throwaway puns and jokey 
dialogue that are supposed to be clever and humorous, but come off as overly 
juvenile, even for a film targeted at the kiddies. These moments of corniness 
are thankfully brief and not abundant in number, so it is easy to ignore them 
and move your mind towards the next scene.</P>
<P>Directing children has to be a challenge for any director, especially if they 
are aiming for realism, and Alexa Vega (1999's "The Deep End of the Ocean") 
and newcomer Daryl Sabara are up to the challenge. Both succeed at dodging 
the ever-dreaded unctuous-factor, and interact like true siblings--ones who 
love each other, help each other out when things get rough, but are also apt 
to argue and feud. Pure performance-wise, Vega is a step above Sabara, as she 
is a really talented find, while Sabara still has a large amount to learn 
regarding subtlety. </P>
<P>The adults play second banana throughout to the kids, with Carla Gugino 
(1998's "Snake Eyes") and Antonio Banderas (1999's "Play It to the Bone") 
underused, but effective, as the kidnapped parents, and Alan Cumming (2000's 
"Get Carter") a standout as the allegedly villainous Fegan Floop, who may or 
may not be slowly growing a conscious heart. Added amusement comes from a 
surprise cameo in the final scene featuring a big, "A"-list actor who has 
worked with Rodriguez in the past.</P>
<P>At a blink-and-you'll-miss-it 86 minutes, "Spy Kids" is needlessly brief, and 
could have benefitted from a little more development and a stronger third 
act, which comes off as anticlimactic. The fact that the movie is so 
fast-paced, no doubt, also contributes to the feeling that it is about twenty 
minutes too short. Flawed or not, "Spy Kids" is one of those rare breeds--a 
live-action family film that relies on intelligence and adventure to tell its 
story, rather than flatulence and doggy-do-do jokes.</P>
