<P>Plot: The Hong Kong mobster Ah Kau is plunged into trouble after the 
gang run their boss down during an armed raid on a bathhouse. Kau and 
the rest of the gang complete a delivery of stolen cars to Mainland 
China for the money only to see them confiscated for owed money and then 
agree to help the boss's wife rob a rival gang - only to have her die 
during sex and the armed raid go wrong. In another reality Kau makes a 
different set of choices and there is persuaded to help a friend make an 
assassination hit in Taiwan - only to get too drunk to remember who they 
are hitting and finding the two of them have been hired by rival 
brothers to shoot the other.</P>
<P>This Hong Kong crime film is a rather funny take on the whole modishly 
cool criminal operation subgenre created by `Reservoir Dogs' and copied 
by the likes of `The Usual Suspects', `Things to Do in Denver When 
You're Dead' et al. Here the band of stylish, hard-talking crims which 
has become a staple of the subgenre since `Reservoir Dogs' are replaced 
by a group of bumbling wannabes who have more in common with Abbott and 
Costello than Tarantino. The exercise is shot through with a sense of 
Terry Gilliam-esque black irony wherein everything that can go wrong 
inevitably will. The gang's boss is accidentally run over - they brick 
him up only to find they have entombed his ringing pager with him; one 
of the hoods keeps trying to get his senile grandmother to give him the 
contact name of the person he is to hit over the phone; the hoods wake 
up after a night's heavy drinking to find they have agreed to a hit and 
then that each has been hired by two mobster brothers to rub out the 
other brother; they mug a woman only to find that the woman has been 
left brain-damaged and is a triad boss's wife and that they have now 
been hired to find and kill themselves. The whole exercise is more a 
dog-legging series of ironic twists than it is any real plot but it is 
conducted with an immense degree of energy. And it is as much notable 
for the energy of the exercise as it is for the eccentricity of the 
camera-work - a fight is filmed with the camera upside down; another 
with it swinging from side to side as though on a pendulum; or fluid 
camera shots with the camera snaking through the aftermath of shootouts 
or action melee scenes to take in everything that is happening at once.</P>
<P>The film also has a unique narrative structure. It tells one story then 
backtracks to the beginning of events to retell an alternate story based 
on what might happen if a different central choice was made by the hero. 
This may well have been inspired by the elliptical story-telling 
structure of `Pulp Fiction', as some have pointed out, but really is a 
device of sufficient uniqueness and originality to stand on its own. Of 
course the basic idea of telling two alternate storylines based on 
different choices was then stolen in the following year's `Sliding 
Doors'.</P>
