<P>Viskningar och Rop (Cries and Whispers)
Directed by Ingmar Bergman
Starring Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Liv Ullman
Rated R (strong adult themes)</P>
<P>Cries and Whispers is a very painful movie to endure: a film that numbs
you with its blood-red images, then works its
semi-surrealistic/semi-realistic voodoo.  It is at the forefront of
critics' favorites of Ingmar Bergman's female explorations.  It is
shocking, difficult, and frightening.  It is eminent and luminous.</P>
<P>Here we have four women living in a castle draped in a harsh scarlet
color, three of whom are sisters.  Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is dying of
cancer and her two unstable sisters come to aid her and walk her into
the next world: Maria (Liv Ullman) and Karin (Ingrid Thulin.)  The
servant Anna (Kari Sylwan) waits in the wings to give emotional
uplifting to Agnes.  Such is the basic premise of Cries and Whispers, an
intensely haunting experience that is both memorable and shaking.  Made
in 1972, it was one of Bergman's last great films before he exited the
cinema world altogether with his last hoorah Fanny and Alexander in
1982.  Years before making Cries and Whispers, Bergman had directed one
of my all-time favorite films Persona, which also starred Ullman.  Like
that film, Cries and Whispers shows Bergman trying to blend dream-like
images and visions with true-to-life, earthly feelings and topics.
Persona was a film that explored the day-in-day-out masquerade of life;
this film explores the effects of death- the fear that results and the
realizations and truth that unfolds.  With a backdrop of red curtains,
walls, and wine (Bergman pictured red as the color of the soul's
interior), master Ingmar Bergman evokes dreadful emotions through the
faces of his four principle actresses.</P>
<P>Agnes, a pure, chaste character, is, we soon discover, the only sister
of the threesome capable of love.  There are scenes in which she reaches
out to her sisters, only for them to turn their backs on her.  Agnes'
death infuriates them because they now realize the emptiness of their
own existence, their own pettiness, and the lack of love they have for
her, others, and themselves.  Karin is masochistic and suicidal, a woman
in a rotting marriage to an as unfeeling man.  Maria is a philanderer, a
flirtascious, feline temptress who has captured Agnes' doctor (Erland
Josephsan) for her prey.  There is a perfect sequence in which we learn
that both sisters have lost the knowledge of touching- the feeling of
flesh on flesh.  This has resulted from years of coldness, insipidness,
indifference.  In this legendary scene, the two touch each other's
faces, hands, and hair as if it were the first time they had ever
touched someone before.  No words are needed so Bach and Tchaikovsky
take over.</P>
<P>Anna is silent and subservient, ready to supply the love and affection
Agnes so desires and needs that she cannot get from her heartless
sisters.  Anna and Agnes are very similar- both are gentle and seem to
have few needs- only the need for love. Karin and Maria explore touching
and feeling because they don't know anything about love, only
sexuality.  Their innocence has been lost, they have become stone
figures.  The passionate red that cloaks the mansion is a very present
color that opposes the lack and loss of passion in Karin and Maria, and
signifies the yearning for that same passion in Agnes and Anna.</P>
<P>There isn't any important dialogue in the film- the bulk of its meaning
and importance lies in the poetic, fiery pictorial strength that Bergman
and all-mighty cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Bergman's collaborator for
30 years, have created.  Silence is most certainly golden here, in a
film that is about death, life, touching, skin, love, and its absence.
The images remind me of the lustrous sights in Bernardo Bertolucci
films, but while Bertolucci's images are more liquid and flowing and
beautiful, Bergman's images are static and free of the heavy use of
details.  The whole film is told through facial expression- Agnes' face
is pale, dying, yet most lively; Anna's is calm, tired, yet passionate;
Maria's is flirtatious and naïve; and Karin's is sinister and stagnant.
When Karin yells "Don't touch me!", it almost seems like her drama is
all just a play- it's been made evident that she finds pleasure in
misery and self-destruction.  Her face wrinkles up in pain, but I could
almost detect a nuance of gratification in her face.  When Maria denies
to help her husband who has just stabbed himself with a knife, we know
she is stone-cold.  When she smiles at Agnes' doctor in the mirror, he
dissects her face, telling her about her "wrinkles of indifference" and
"chin of indulgence."  On the landscape of Agnes' face, we see her
longing: she is dying but because of her charity and love, she is more
alive than any of the sisters.</P>
<P>One may be surprised to know that the characters are rather one-sided.
Agnes is the virtuous, in-white puritan; Anna is the obeying, caring
maid; Maria is the slinky two-timer; and Karin is the dark, deathly
rock.  None of the characters go beyond that.  This is no flaw though,
because Cries and Whispers is not character-driven, but idea and
image-driven.</P>
<P>Heaven knows I couldn't sleep after watching this film.  It makes your
muscles stiff from start to finish, and you become a part of this
surrealistic Bergman vision that you don't exit from even after the film
ends.  At the end of Cries and Whispers, Maria and Karin are no better
off than they were when the film started- they deny their touching
escapade and move on with their flat lives; after Agnes' funeral, they
don't discuss how much they miss her, they only thank God it wasn't too
gloomy.</P>
