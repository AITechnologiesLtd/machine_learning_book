<P>[WARNING: The following review contains elements that may be considered
plot spoilers. Those who wish to see the film without any knowledge of
plot developments beyond those contained in its trailers should not read
this review.]</P>
<P>     M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE easily qualifies as the strangest,
most subdued and most unconventional super-hero movie ever made. It will
probably be considered something of a plot spoiler simply to make such a
declaration, since Shyamalan and Touchstone Pictures have made such a
concerted effort to build a mystery around what exactly UNBREAKABLE is
about. But there you have it: It's a super-hero movie. A moody,
character-driven super-hero movie. With no costumes or action figures. No
explosions. And no crash-cut editing. It's a super-hero movie as directed
by M. Night Shyamalan, the anti-Joel Shumacher.</P>
<P>     This much you probably already know from trailers and commercials:
Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a Philadelphia security guard who is the
only survivor of a catastrophic train wreck. Not only is he the only
survivor, he emerges from the crash without a single scratch or broken
bone. Ah, but there's more: Soon David is contacted by Elijah Price
(Samuel L. Jackson), an art dealer with a fascination for comic books and
a congenital disease resulting in extremely fragile bones. Elijah believes
that David may be something more than extremely lucky to have survived the
train crash. David may be impervious to physical harm; he may be destined
to use his physical gifts to protect others. In short, he may be a
super-hero. David, of course, thinks Elijah is crazy ... until evidence
begins building that he's not.</P>
<P>     In many ways, UNBREAKABLE's story is the quintessential modern
super-hero story. David is an Everyman Superman, reluctant to believe in
his destiny; Elijah is the mentor who tries to convince him to harness his
abilities. What Shyamalan does is wrap the archetypal mythology in
psychology and family drama. We quickly discover that David is unhappily
married to his wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn), and has difficulty
connecting with his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). He harbors
long-suppressed unhappiness over the life he may have given up for his
family, unhappiness Willis generally conveys through the raspy whisper he
uses in his Serious Dramatic Actor mode. Willis, Jackson, Penn and Clark
all play fully-developed characters, which makes UNBREAKABLE a rare enough
film in that it's genuinely concerned not just with situations, but with
people responding to situations.</P>
<P>     And yet it's still indisputably, undeniably a super-hero movie,
though unlike any super-hero movie you've ever seen before. Shyamalan's
style is unusal for a director in any genre, one that favors long,
unbroken takes over quick cuts and reversals. That style contributed
greatly to the powerful aura of mystery in Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE,
and it contributes here to a sense of greater consequence than you'd
expect from a tale of a super-powered man learning how to fight evil. The
moment in which David and Joseph jointly discover David's unusual strength
is played with a light sense of humor and a truly under-stated sense of
awe; David's climactic encounter with a villain is shot in a way that
makes heroic triumph surprisingly ugly. As visually gifted as Shyamalan is
as a filmmaker -- perhaps even showy in his way -- UNBREAKABLE never lets
a special effect or a camera trick take over this narrative.</P>
<P>     UNBREAKABLE takes a couple of unfortunate wrong turns during its
third act. One involves David's initial adversary, a fairly garden-variety
nameless psycho. The other involves a late plot development that's not
nearly as organic to the story as THE SIXTH SENSE's already-legendary
twist. It feels almost obligatory, as though Shyamalan were under the
impression that it's what the audience expects from him now. That seems an
unlikely prospect, though, considering how blithely he goes about blowing
up every expectation you've ever had about a super-hero movie. UNBREAKABLE
is a compelling, fundamentally sound story that feels more and more daring
until its late stumbles. It's too bad that the final moments are so weak,
because it might leave viewers doubting its other impressive
accomplishments. This is a film that emerges from its own internal
conflicts ultimately triumphant -- just like a strange, subdued,
unconventional super-hero movie should.</P>
