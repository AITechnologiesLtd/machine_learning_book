<PRE>                                 RESTORATION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Robert Downey's schizophrenic personality has finally found a home in
RESTORATION.  This sweeping film, set in 1660 England during the reign of
the flamboyant Charles II (Sam Neill), tells the story of Merivel
(Downey), who rides a rollercoaster from volunteer surgeon to King's
veterinarian, to his fall from grace and his eventual rebirth.</P>
<P>     Merivel, the kind of guy who pawns his medical instruments to buy
time with prostitutes, starts out as a pretty loathsome chap.  However,
he's also a pretty talented (and daring) physician, and after healing the
King's beloved spaniel, he is brought into the fold of nobility.  But the
story then takes an inexplicable turn as Merivel is given a knighthood and
coerced to marry the King's mistress, Celia (Polly Walker), and then
promptly falls in love with her.</P>
<P>     And just when you get used to this, he is discovered and cast out,
penniless.  Merivel returns to caring for the poor with his old friend
Pearce (David Thewlis), and falls in love with one of his insane patients,
Katherine (Meg Ryan, cast as an Irish mental patient, if you can imagine
that).  And then there's the plague and the big fire that burned down
London, and Merivel somehow comes out of this a hero and a changed man to
boot.</P>
<P>     A downright silly script is the fundamental flaw in RESTORATION. 
What starts out as a funny, genuine character-driven drama quickly
degenerates into a couple of bland love stories that don't even fit
together.  There's a lot of good acting here (with the notable exception
of Ryan), but the parts don't give the stars a lot of room to work. 
Neill's King Charles is a true standout, pulling off the dichotomy between
royal grace and bawdy humor with ease.</P>
<P>     RESTORATION is also one of the most exquisitely rendered period
pieces I've ever seen, replete with fully-laden palaces and disgustingly
realistic plague victims.  But details do not a movie make, and
all-in-all, RESTORATION comes across as a film in which the sum of the
parts is much greater than the picture as a whole.</P>
