<P>     As evidence of my exodus from the Land of Hip, I offer the confession
that it's been about three years since I've seen an episode of "Saturday
Night Live."  I gave up on producer Lorne Michaels 'round about the time
he was turning "SNL" sketches into hideous excuses for feature films, from
THE CONEHEADS (shudder) to STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY (shudder shudder) to
IT'S PAT (full grand mal seizure).  The show that used to be cutting edge
had turned into a pop culture butter knife:  dull and pointless.</P>
<P>     If A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY is any indication, I haven't missed much
from "SNL" other than an attempt to recapture past glory by regurgitating
old premises.  Steve (Will Ferrell) and Doug Butabi (Chris Kattan), the
socially intept, utterly oblivious night-clubbing L.A. siblings whose
attempts to "score" from one of the film's plot lines, are pretty familiar
creations.  The Butabis are basically a post-disco gloss on the
Czechoslovakian brothers played by Dan Aykroyd and Steve Martin twenty
years ago, they of the wide-open shirt collars and "wild and crazy guys"
finger-pointing.  Only the lingo appears to have changed.  You say tomato,
I say tomahto; you say "foxes," I say "babes."</P>
<P>     I'm not suggesting that a film based on the Czechoslovakian brothers
necessarily would have been funnier than this one.  It's almost axiomatic
at this point that trying to turn a five minute sketch into a full-length
feature is a very, very bad idea (particularly when those five minute
sketches are only funny for the first two).  The fact is, it's briefly
amusing watching the Butabis' synchronized head-swaying to the beat, or
listening to them spew out decrepit pick-up lines.  But the rest of A
NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY demonstrates exactly what kills sketch-to-feature
concepts:  once the sketch material is exhausted, you've got to humanize
characters that are much funnier as broad caricatures.  Doug and Steve,
even though they still live at home with their parents (Dan Hedaya and
Loni Anderson), are really guys with a dream to create their own nightclub
with the help of Roxbury owner Mr. Zadir (an uncredited Chazz Palminteri).
Do you think the Czechoslovakian brothers would be hysterical as earnest
immigrants who decide to clean up their act and improve their English
skills?</P>
<P>     When A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY isn't just plain boring, it's actually
kinda sad.  In case the taut visage of Loni Anderson wasn't frightening
enough, the film wheels out Richard Grieco as himself, doughy and
mascara-covered.  The idea that Grieco still carries enough clout to get
our loser protagonists into the ultra-exclusive Roxbury is one of the 
film's best jokes; Dana Carvey would have dismissed him in an old "SNL"
sketch with an admonition to "wait at the bar."  It's nearly as sad
watching other "SNL" cast members (Molly Shannon, Colin Quinn, Mark
McKinney) turn up as though they were in need of Lorne Michaels' charity.
And it's saddest of all being a member of the audience watching the script
scramble in search of a concept on which to hang something vaguely
humorous, and watching director John Fortenberry's clunky comic pacing.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, there are about five decent laughs and another handful
of chuckles in A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY, and I was counting those in the
stony audience around me, not my own.  I'll give Ferrell and Kattan credit
for a clever combo-poke at SAY ANYTHING... and THE GRADUATE, and I'll give
major credit to the music supervisor for coming up with great song cues
for a number of scenes.  Otherwise, A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY continues two
noteworthy "Saturday Night Live" traditions:  loser brothers infatuated
with trendy night-spots, and generally unwatchable feature films.  Looks
like I could pick up right where I left off.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Rox-burieds:  3.</PRE>
