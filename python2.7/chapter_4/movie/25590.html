<P>I have always admired writer-director Nora Ephron's efforts, as mild
as some were, such as "Heartburn" and "This is my Life." "Sleepless in
Seattle" is one of her best, a sophisticated romantic comedy with
allusions to old movie classics such as "An Affair to Remember" and
"The Wild Bunch." It had the innate, likable pairing of Meg Ryan and
Tom Hanks and some delightful zingers courtesy of Rosie O'Donnell. The
surprise is that "You've Got Mail" is even better - as romantically
pure and cleverly funny as you can imagine, and Hanks and Ryan are
back in roles they were born to play.</P>
<P>Hanks stars as the aggressive Joe Fox, the owner of a Borders-type
bookstore called "Fox Books" where they serve cappuccinos and
thousands of books for discount prices. His business is the type to
put any real literary bookstore out of business, including "The Shop
Around the Corner" - a children's bookstore run by Kathleen Kelly (Meg
Ryan). Kathleen holds this precious commodity dearly to her heart, and
it is practically around the corner from Fox Books. Distracting her
from her business is her laptop computer, which she regularly uses to
talk to an anonymous male friend through the wonders of e-mail. She
has a regular rapport with this friend, and patiently waits for her
beloved, a writer for The New York Observer (Greg Kinnear), to leave
for work before she rattles around her computer. Only, she's not aware
that her e-mail buddy is her competitor Joe Fox!</P>
<P>Of course, Joe is unaware of this himself, and regularly waits to go
online until his girlfriend, a book editor (Parker Posey), leaves for
work. The e-mails mount as they both write to each other, seeking help
about their business prospects. And never shall the twain meet, though
we constantly hope that they do.</P>
<P>Nora Ephron is the perfect writer for such lightweight nonsense, but I
was surprised how sophisticated and clever the dialogue was. Joe's
double entendres hit a 10 on the laughometer - the best scene is when
he visits Kathleen's bookstore and tries to prevent his kids from
saying "F-O-X". There are also the witticisms of supporting
characters, such as Joe's philandering father (Dabney Coleman) and his
philandering grandfather (John Randolph), who describes women as being
"enchanting"; his loose, Chris Tucker-ish executive pal (Dave
Chappelle); and Kathleen's old bookkeeper friend (Jean Stapleton), who
remarks that her last boyfriend "ran Spain". These characters are so
joyous and entertaining to watch that they are partly responsible for
making "You've Got Mail" such a success.</P>
<P>Ephron has less success with Joe and Kathleen's better halves. Parker
Posey, one of the ubiquitous queens of independent film, is given
little to do and is too boring and insipid to inspire much interest -
no wonder Joe is less than enthralled by her presence. This is partly
true of Greg Kinnear's character, though he is given a little more
leverage by Ephron and is allowed some sparkling zingers at a cocktail
party scene with Posey.</P>
<P>Another mild flaw in "You've Got Mail" is the relentless number of
oldies playing on the soundtrack - how many times do we need to hear
"Rockin' Robin"? The only reason so many immaterial songs appear on
the soundtrack is so that they can make more sales at record
stores. Only the inclusion of Harry Nilsson's "Over the Rainbow" feels
justified.</P>
<P>The center of "You've Got Mail" is the movie star combo of Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan, and they are as delightful and adorable a pairing as
James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were, or Cary Grant and Rosalind
Russell. Hanks is surefooted as he switches subtly from being charming
and likable to mean and comically furious. Ryan is, for once, not too
bubbly or cute and handles her comedic scenes with flair and good
timing. Her last scene, where her eyes fill with understanding, hope
and regret, is stunning to watch. Combine that with Ephron's crisp,
often hilarious dialogue, and "You've Got Mail" makes for one of the
best romantic comedies since "When Harry Met Sally."</P>
