<P>     When THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT was released, many knowledgeable movie-
goers commented how the sentimentality of its "feel good" storyline 
recalled the work of director Frank Capra.  Now, with MR. HOLLAND'S 
OPUS, another Capra-esque motion picture has reached today's theaters.  
Similar in theme and content to DEAD POETS' SOCIETY and IT'S A WONDERFUL 
LIFE, this movie persuades its audience that no life spent in a worthy 
pursuit is ever wasted.  Unlike THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, however, it 
doesn't stoop to heavy-handed proselytizing.  And, while no one will 
accuse MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS of getting its message across subtly, it's a 
more dramatically secure picture than Rob Reiner's -- when it 
manipulates, it does so skillfully.</P>
<P>     MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS spans thirty-one years in the life of a high 
school music teacher.  When Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) first comes 
to the newly-dedicated JFK High School in 1964, he has a dream of 
spending a few years teaching to accumulate a nest egg, then returning 
to his true passion:  composing.  His loving wife, Iris (Glenne Headly) 
is completely supportive -- until she becomes pregnant.  After that 
unexpected event, teaching is no longer just Glenn's "fall back 
position".  It has become his means to provide for his family.</P>
<P>     Yet Glenn finds that instructing students in music appreciation has 
its rewards.  When lectures and text assignments don't fire his pupils' 
passion for the subject, Glenn tries unique ways of encouraging an 
understanding that "playing music is supposed to be fun -- it's about 
heart... not notes on a page."  Repeatedly during his three decades of
teaching, Glenn chooses boys and girls with special skills to nurture 
and encourage.  In the process, he creates a deep loyalty among JFK's 
student body while straining the harmony of his home life.  His wife and 
son wonder if Glenn cares more about his pupils than about them.</P>
<P>     The musical metaphors in MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS are rather obvious, and 
the soundtrack is an effective mix of pop tunes, classical compositions, 
and Michael Kamen's score.  While no film this decade has equaled the 
accomplishment of Krzysztof Kieslowski and Zbigniew Preisner in wedding 
music and visuals for 1993's BLUE, MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS has moments when 
it comes close.</P>
<P>     Like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, this movie is about appreciating the 
value of every person's effort to better the lives of others 
irrespective of the individual cost.  DEAD POETS' SOCIETY told a similar 
story in a similar setting with similar themes, but MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS 
has enough singular material to preserve its unique identity.  Those who 
prize the message and tone of those other pictures, however, will almost 
certainly enjoy this one.</P>
<P>     Most of the time, when Hollywood wants to show changes to a 
character over a significant span of time, a relatively young actor is 
used, and the aging process is accomplished via (usually fake-looking) 
makeup.  For MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS, the film makers tried the opposite, 
choosing a performer whose actual age closely matches the final age of 
the main character, then using makeup to rejuvenate him for the film's 
early sequences.  Surprisingly, the result doesn't excessively stretch 
credibility, although Richard Dreyfuss never looks thirty (possibly 
forty).  As always, the actor turns in a strong performance, regardless 
of how old Mr. Holland is supposed to be.  Supporting players like 
Glenne Headly, Jay Thomas (as one of Glenn's teaching buddies), Olympia 
Dukakis (as a crusty principal), Alicia Witt (as Glenn's first 
"project"), and Jean Louisa Kelly (as a student with a crush on her 
music teacher) keep MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS in tune.</P>
<P>     In recent years, it has become common practice for movie studios to 
release at least one emotionally stirring drama around the holiday 
season.  In 1992, it was SCENT OF A WOMAN.  In 1993, SHADOWLANDS.  Last 
year, NOBODY'S FOOL.  Flaws aside, one common element in these films is 
that each focuses on the triumph of the human spirit, using a story that 
seeks to touch the heart.  MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS deserves a place in their 
ranks.  It's a symphony of solid storytelling and good feeling that pays 
tribute to Hollywood's rarely-seen, gentler side.</P>
