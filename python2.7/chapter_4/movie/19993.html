<P>Like "White Balloon", it focuses on the lives of ordinary children.
Unlike "White Balloon" which stretches over one incident in realtime,
"Children...." involves a string of events and problems encountered by
them. It was very interesting to see how they go about solving it.
These solutions, funny or ineffective they might be, exude innocence,
which is the very soul of this masterpiece.That untainted innocence is
unattainable by conventional city dwellers, both young and old. Like
almost all Iranian productions, everything was done in the most
authentic way, more real than dramatic.It would have easily taken the
dramatic turn by exploiting the hard lives the kids are having to gain
sympathy. Fortunately, that fact was downplayed so as not to get in the
way of storytelling or perhaps, what I perceived as hardships might be
a common sight in Iran ( I hope not).</P>
<P>Iranian productions like to end on a pondering note but that does not
always mean open ended endings. I guess with all  the loose ends tied
up there's no need to go any further by including a most probably corny
conclusion.   So they left the obvious to imagination and fired off a
last burst of lingering creativity, then subtly the curtain fell.</P>
<P>If you have not seen any Iranian films and wonder what's the big fuss
about? This will be a very good one to start with because of its
accessibility, in other words, it's of relatively high entertainment
value for an arthouse fare. But if you adore Iranian films, then this
one could be a little less intriguing. Nonetheless, it's still as
endearingly heartfelt.</P>
