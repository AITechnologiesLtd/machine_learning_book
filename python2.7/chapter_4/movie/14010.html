<P>        On the Coeur d'Alene indian reservation in Idaho, life floats by
like a slow breeze.  K-REZ, the low-watt radio station which serves the
indian community, broadcasts the same basic traffic report every morning:
"A big truck is passing by."  A pause.  "Now it's gone."  Another pause.
"Ain't no traffic, really."  The meteorological report is just as laconic:
"One of those clouds looks kinda like a horse."  It's the sort of place
where people still prefer to barter for their goods, and if you can't
afford to have the "forward" gear of your car fixed, then hey, you simply
drive around in reverse.  But life here only looks slow and dreamy if you
happen to live somewhere else.  The residents of this community have
their own fair share of joy, desire, catastrophe and discontent, all
carefully buried behind the idyllic facade they put up for the benefit of
the tourists.</P>
<P>        It's a rare film indeed which is able to bring together
sentimentality, wistfulness, and absolution in such a way that it feels
fresh and new, rather than old and reheated.  "Smoke Signals" is such a
film.  Not only does it allow us a peek into the highly personal lives of
its characters, but it paints them with such a deft touch that we are
completely drawn into their world, experiencing all the pain and triumph
of these fascinating people.  This is a film where, when the end credits
begin to roll, you simply stay in your seat and think about what you've
just seen while simultaneously wishing the experience wasn't over.</P>
<P>        The story opens on July 4, 1976, the American bi-centennial.  On
the reservation, indians celebrate "the white man's day of freedom" by
shooting off fireworks and drinking beer.  The festivities are quickly
disrupted, however, when a fire breaks out in a nearby house.  The young
couple inside finds themselves trapped in the burning building, and fling
their newborn baby from a third-story window in a desperate attempt to
save it from the inferno.  A quick-thinking neighbor, Arnold Joseph (Gary
Farmer), manages to catch the child, but all he and the other onlookers
can do is watch and listen as the parents burn.</P>
<P>        The infant that Arnold saves is Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan
Adams).  Raised by his grandmother after being saved from the flames,
Thomas grows into an intelligent, amiable young man, full of stories and
laughter.  Sadly, Thomas is also a bit of a nerd, and is therefore shunned
by the other indians.  Cruelest of all is Arnold's son Victor (Adam Evans),
who later accuses Thomas of having learned everything he knows about their
heritage by watching "Dances with Wolves" over and over.</P>
<P>        Victor has demons of his own, however.  His father, despite the
brief moment of heroism in which he saved Thomas, is an alcoholic who's
just as likely to communicate with his fists as with words.  In his
young life, Victor has seen his mother physically abused by Arnold many
times.  Under the tutelage of his father, Victor is also taught to hate all
white people.  When Arnold storms out after a fight with his wife and
moves to Arizona, never to return, Victor learns an important lesson:
one must never love, for love leads to pain.  The lesson is heeded, though
Victor never forgives his father for deserting him.</P>
<P>        Flash forward to present day, as word of Arnold's death filters
back to the reservation.  As his only son, Victor knows what he must do:
travel to Arizona, pick up his father's ashes, and bring them back to the
reservation as indian tradition demands.  There's a problem, however:
Victor has no money, no car, and precious little experience dealing with
the great big world outside the reservation's boundaries.  Thomas, hearing
of Victor's plight, offers to buy Victor a bus ticket on one condition:
he, Thomas, must be allowed to come along and pay his respects to the man
who saved his life so long ago.  Victor grudgingly agrees, and the two men
head off on a journey which will change both of them forever.</P>
<P>        The film borders on heavy at times, but the witty script from
Sherman Alexie knows when to lighten the mood with humor.  The interplay
between Thomas and Victor, an indian "Odd Couple," is priceless.  Thomas,
who has even less experience being off the reservation than Victor, is
constantly fascinated by the smallest details.  "I went to Denny's once,"
he tells Victor wonderingly.  "Even though it was after twelve, they still
let me order the Grand Slam Breakfast!"  In another scene, Victor tries to
get Thomas to act more like an indian.  "You smile too much.  Indians don't
smile, Thomas.  Get stoic!"  This is a wonderful moment, as is another
in which Thomas and Victor sing a lengthy song about John Wayne's false
teeth... to the great annoyance of the other passengers.</P>
<P>        Along the way, we watch Victor come to terms with the death of
his father, who he has always considered a loser and a deserter.  Thomas,
who knows Arnold only as the man who saved his life, disagrees with this
assessment.  As more of Arnold's personality is revealed to us via
flashbacks, we learn that neither Victor or Thomas have the complete
picture.  Mercifully, the film does not try to make Arnold into a "good"
man, only a real one.  Victor will learn that his father was not quite
the monster he'd always believed, just as Thomas will discover that no
man, including the late Arnold Joseph, is a saint.  It's a revelation
that makes both men rethink their philosophies.</P>
<P>        As one would expect of any mismatched pair, there is an incredible
amount of friction between our two main characters.  When the friendly
Thomas befriends a white woman on the bus, Victor insults her and drives
her away.  Thomas's chatterbox dialogue grates on Victor's ears, and they
have differing opinions on just about everything.  But through it all, a
special bond forms between them.  Due to the skillful way in which the
film depicts their growing fondness, we never doubt either man's sincerity.</P>
<P>        By the end of the movie, Victor and Thomas have each inherited
a smattering of the other's personality, and both are better people for it.
Their final parting scene, in which Thomas receives a special gift from
his new friend, is so unselfish and "real" that I was honestly touched by
it.  The fact that such a powerful response could be generated by such a
short scene says a great deal about the skill of the actors, director,
and screenwriter.  These characters stay with us long after the film is
over, as does the haunting climatic voice-over, solemnly delivered by
Thomas.</P>
<P>        "Smoke Signals" isn't perfect, but it comes awfully close.  Only
once does it stumble, and even this is not neccessarily a flaw, depending
on your point-of-view:</P>
<P>        I understand that the film is interested in conveying the Native
American viewpoint.  That's fine-- it does so extremely well, and it's
a big part of the movie's charm.  However, the film does seem to go out
of its way to make a GREAT STATEMENT about racism, which quite honestly
feels forced.  Case in point: there are four white men with speaking parts
in this movie, and ALL OF THEM are racist scumbags.  Indeed, one scene
with a redneck sheriff could be dispensed with altogether, since it seems
to be included for no other reason than to introduce yet another white
antagonist.</P>
<P>        But this relatively minor criticism in no way detracts from the
story's power.  This is an incredible debut from first-time director
Chris Eyre, full of warmth, humor, and most of all, life.  Be sure to
catch it.  Without a doubt, it's one of the year's best.</P>
