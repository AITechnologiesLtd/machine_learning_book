<P>THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
A film by Martin Scorsese
Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Michelle Pfeiffer
Written by Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese
Based on the novel by Edith Wharton</P>
<P>    Martin Scorsese's triumphant adaptation of Edith Wharton's THE AGE 
OF INNOCENCE is a stunning film for the quintessential New York 
filmmaker, the man who brought the streets of TAXI DRIVER and MEAN 
STREETS to life.  It seems like an odd choice for Scorsese to do a 
period piece in the early 1900's, but the fact that he pulls it off so 
brilliantly is a wonder, and a testament to the greatness of Scorsese as 
a filmmaker.  This is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of 
Scorsese's finest.</P>
<P>Newland Archer (Day-Lewis) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to 
May Welland (Ryder), a somewhat empty and shallow New Yorker, who 
belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful.  The marriage is 
one which will unite two very prestigious families, in a society where 
nothing is more important than the opinions of others.  On the day that 
Archer is to announce his engagement to May, Countess Ellen Olenska 
(Pfeiffer), cousin of May, walks into Archer's life.  Archer is 
immediately captivated, and finds himself in love with Ellen.  Archer is 
also bound by the limits of New York society, which is an intrusive as 
any other in the world.  Archer finds himself having a secret love 
affair in his mind with Countess Olenska, attempting to keep her in his 
mind while trying not to lose his social status. </P>
<P>The film's subject matter may seem alien to Scorsese, but the theme 
is definitely not.  It is a theme of forbidden romance, guilty 
pleasures, and the consequences causes because of those actions.  There 
is a painstakingly flawed hero, and his choice between the life he 
wants, and the life he is destined for.  In truth, it is a film about a 
society the audience doesn't know about, but wants to find out more, 
much like the society of GOODFELLAS or even KUNDUN. </P>
<P>The performances are absolutely breathtaking.  Day-Lewis portrays 
more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take.  
Pfeiffer is marvelous as Countess Olenska, a mix of passion and beauty 
that the audience would die for as well.  Ryder is probably the gem of 
the group, for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot, and 
slowly pushes Day-Lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending.  The 
supporting cast is also wonderful, with several characters so singular 
that they are indelible in one's memory.</P>
<P>Scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking.  His lavish and 
sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of New York is a wondrous 
sight.  He literally transports the viewer to another world with 
incredible imagery.  His script is also excellent, slow in buildup, with 
a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be 
believed.  It is difficult to make a period piece gripping: Scorsese, 
however, does it beautifully.  The famous cameras of the legendary 
director are also everywhere.  He is patient, but he films everything 
and anything remotely important.  The cameras sweep, pan, track, and do 
more than they've ever done, but they are so subtle, one doesn't realize 
he's watching all the Scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing.  The 
central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the 
famous GOODFELLAS shot, but the viewer doesn't notice it, because we 
want to see more of this gorgeous world.  There are a few deft touches 
of filmmaking that are simply outstanding, and Joanne Woodward' 
narration is exquisite.  Not a fast film like GOODFELLAS, this shares 
more in common with KUNDUN than anything else.  And like KUNDUN, this is 
a slow-starting film that truly shines, when given the chance to fully 
breathe and bloom in the end.  A beautiful film by a director continuing 
to challenge himself year after year. </P>
