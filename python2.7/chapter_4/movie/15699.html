<P>ORGAZMO (1997)  1/2 * Written, directed, edited by Trey Parker. Produced by
Fran Rubel Kuzui, Jason McHugh, Matt Stone. Photography,  Kenny Gioseffi.
Cast: Trey Parker (the Elder Joe Young), Matt Stone (the other Elder), Dian
Bachar (Choda-Boy), Michael Dean Jacobs (Maxxx Orbison), Robyn Raab (Lisa),
Ron Jeremy (Clark), Masao ``Maki'' San (G-Fresh), et al. An October
Pictures release. 90 minutes. Rated NC-17 (sex, language)</P>
<P>Whenever a multiplex schedules a 90-minute feature for just two shows a
day, it means that the film is either "art" that does not draw mainstream
audiences, or "dreck" that cannot even find an infantile public. Orgazmo is
the latter.</P>
<P>Comedy is the hardest genre to make. Within comedy, the subgenre of
parodies is even harder. Within that subgenre, spoofing films that are
themselves parodies, intentionally or not, is a lost cause. This applies to
a host of films, including pornographic, and especially cheap pornos.
Orgazmo's intent  to parody cheap porno-flicks falls pancake-flat, though
not cheesecake-flat.</P>
<P>Two young, clean-cut Mormon Elders are trying to spread the good word in
Los Angeles.
When they chance on the mansion-cum-studio of porn-maker Maxxx Orbison
(note the xxx) the reception is rough. One Elder flees, the other, Joe
Young, highly proficient in martial arts, fights Maxxx's goons. The
sequence, meant to be funny, is not. Nor is it choreographed a la Hong
Kong.</P>
<P>Maxxx, impressed by Joe, immediately offers him the title role in the
picture he is shooting, the part of Orgazmo, a superstud and superfighter
who has a diminutive side-kick, Choda-Boy. (A parody of Batman and Robin).
For two days' work in his quickie, Maxx goes from his usual fee of $300 to
$20,000. Joe refuses but then everyone has his price. He finally accepts
because he and his fiancee Lisa dream of a wedding in the pricey Salt Lake
City's Mormon Tabernacle. Joe's main stipulation is that there will be a
stand-in actor (or phallus) for the sex acts.</P>
<P>Joe's name is, of course, a reference to the King-Kongish ape in the film
"Mighty Joe Young." Maxxx rebaptizes him Joe Hung. Ain't all that funny?</P>
<P>The rest of the film is an aimless bore, clearly improvised from scene to
scene. The flick is a mega-hit  that Maxx wants to make sequel after
sequel. There's a kind of sub-plot about other henchmen of Maxxx's (he's a
kind of Mafioso on the side) who take over by force a sushi-bar;  a bit
more relevant is the relation of Joe and Lisa who regularly speak on the
phone starting with "Jesus love you and I love you."</P>
<P>Joe, who majored in theater from Brigham Young University ,sinfully lies to
Lisa by pretending he is extending his stay in L.A. to be in Death of a
Salesman. Naive Lisa eventually comes to visit and...and...</P>
<P>I knew nothing about filmmaker Troy Parker but  finally found out that he
is about 28, has been variously active in movies and is the co-maker of
TV's series South Park. Since, on TV, I mostly watch PBS, the History
Channel, old films and the better ones I have missed, I was unaware that
South Park was an animation about little kids who use vulgar language, and
that the shows have made Parker famous in some quarters.</P>
<P>Orgazmo does have a small sprinkling of jokes (the "best " ones verbal
rather than graphic) which could bring on some chuckles depending on the
viewer's standards for humor. But as an entity, this flick is plain Dumb
and Dumber, part II of which, yet unreleased, was written by, guess
who?....Trey Parker.</P>
<P>I suppose that the unusual rating of NC-17 was welcomed by Mr. Parker. It
promises raunchy audiovisual excitement to potential adult audiences and to
underage kids who'll sneak in. But in fact, the movie's sex scenes show no
real sex acts and are so broad and un-detailed that they are as inoffensive
as The Three Stooges, which the film does feel like.  The use of a
toy-like, orgasm-producing ray gun invented by Choda-Boy (he has two
scientific Ph.D. degrees from M.I.T.!) is also inoffensively shown. Nudity
exists minimally, mostly as the sight of men's hairy behinds.</P>
<P>The bottom (no pun meant) line is that the NC-17 must be the result of the
film's steady mockery of the Mormons. Otherwise, you can see infinitely
more sexually explicit films on cable, including Cinemaxxx.</P>
