<PRE>                                    JFK
                       A film review by Ed Nilges
                        Copyright 1991 Ed Nilges</PRE>
<PRE>I want in this review to address:</PRE>
<PRE>     * The consumerist question (eg., "should I spend money on this?
       is it entertaining?")</PRE>
<PRE>     * The art question ("is this good art?")</PRE>
<P>     * The political question ("is Stone right about the assassination?")</P>
<PRE>THE CONSUMERIST QUESTION</PRE>
<P>     Yes, you *will* be entertained by this movie unless you are
braindead.  Folks old enough to remember the terrible weekend of 1963 (I
was a high school freshman) will relive the pity and terror as Costner
sits in Napoleon's (a N'Awlins bar) watching the news reports, including
Walter Cronkite breaking down as Cronkite is passed the news of
Kennedy's death.  </P>
<P>     Folks too young will get a history lesson in the fact that the
Sixties were not all sex/drugs/rock and roll...they were also an
expression of cynicism in a system in which it at least appeared that a
President with a demonstrated commitment to peace (as evinced by his
test ban treaty and by his honorable handling of Bay of Pigs) was
replaced by a President who (while committed to civil rights) did not
share Kennedy's commitment to peace.  It at least appeared to us
antiwar protesters that Johnson was, to a greater degree than JFK, a
creature of the defense establishment.  This history lesson is made
effectively, using a combination of newsreel footage and reenacted
incidents the pacing of which keeps the attention of the MTV set.</P>
<P>     Should you wait for the video?  I think not.  You may not be able
to follow the important scenes that demand you close-read the grainy 8MM
footage of Abraham Zapruder's film.</P>
<PRE>THE ART QUESTION</PRE>
<P>     ...can be dispensed of quickly.  Yes, Oliver Stone knows how to
make a good film.  In particular, I liked the pacing in Costner's
summation at the end of the trial, for it treated the audience as mature
adults able to sit still for far, far more than a sound bite.</P>
<PRE>THE POLITICAL QUESTION</PRE>
<P>     This is the hot potato.  Having seen the film, I believe that JFK
was killed in a "silent coup" by elements of the defense establishment.
It is true, as an article on page 1 of the NEW YORK TIMES indicates
today, that Stone could be faulted for combining "real" footage
including the Zapruder film with "fictional" footage such as an
imaginary recreation of the autopsy.  I'd say that given the fact that
the government won't release documents on the assassination until 2029,
Citizen Stone is perfectly justified in reconstructing incidents, for he
does not have access to the facts.  That is, secrecy creates a poetic
license.  </P>
<P>     Readers should note that the assassination of JFK and possible
dealings in October 1980 between the Reagan reelection team and Iran
mean that essentially the same elements *may* be responsible for not one
but two silent coups.  On the other hand, when Costner (speaking
obviously for Stone) speaks of "fascism" I did reflect that it is an odd
sort of Fascism in which the film JFK can be shown.  Perhaps I speak too
soon; perhaps there still will be a violent reaction to the film, with
attempts to keep it from being seen, if the snotty and condescending
tone of the New York Times article I mention earlier fails to convince
people that it is unhip to believe Stone.  </P>
<P>       Noam Chomsky describes ways of Manufacturing Consent which are far
more sophisticated than merely preventing a movie from being shown.  For
example, one troubling question raised by the movie is the fact that the
day of the assassination marked the creation of a modern urban legend,
that of the crazed, murderous loner.  If Stone is right, Oswald was a
schmoe, caught up in nut politics; but he was a fall guy, not a
murderer.  It is a troubling thought that almost every assassination and
almost every mass murder since the JFK assassination (a sort of Ur event)
has been given the following spin by the press: "folks, something
terrible has just happened.  A popular leader (or many people) has/have
just been tragically murdered.  The guy who dunnit, however, is a crazed
loner or (at best) a cult leader ... not one of us or our leaders."
Such is the power of the "crazed loner" theory that almost any American
male is at risk for being associated with the outcast group of "crazed
loners" unless he is careful to lead a circumscribed and above all
married existence.  Any intellectual interest outside of careerism puts
one at risk for association with this outgroup.  Perhaps, however, our
murderers are *not* crazed loners (just as, statistically, our child
abusers are upstanding married men).  Perhaps our murderers are our
kindly father figures like Stormin' Norman.  Perhaps are murderers are
the Texas schoolchildren who cheered when Kennedy's death was announced,
who grew up to be upstanding members of the community (not crazed
loners).  Perhaps our murderers is us.</P>

      it was you and me!"</PRE>
