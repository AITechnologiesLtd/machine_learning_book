<P>Review by Lars Lindahl (<A HREF="mailto:larsattacks@mail.com">larsattacks@mail.com</A>)</P>
<PRE>"The Patriot" (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Roland Emmerich
Written by Robert Rodat</PRE>
<P>Starring Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Jason Isaacs, Joely
Richardson, Tcheky Karyo, Chris Cooper and Tom
Wilkinson</P>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<P>As a revolutionary war hero in The Patriot, Mel Gibson
provides another macho man performance for Hollywood
audiences. You know the type: his shirt is always
shredded, his face always scarred, he has a soft spot
for his loved ones and a "to kill" list for his
enemies. Oscar-hungry director/executive producer
Roland Emmerich did not intend to, but he made the
stereotypical action hero for the 18th century. As
Gibson delivers lines like, "Before this war is over,
I am going to kill you," Schwarzenegger in Commando or
Stallone in Cobra immediately come to mind. Oddly
enough, The Patriot is as much an epic
three-hour-tear-fest like Gladiator, as it is a
ninety-minute guilty pleasure. At times absorbing, at
others enjoyably insipid, this is good, bloody Summer
fun. </P>
<P>I probably would have despised this film had it not
been released over the July 4th weekend. Some of the
images are so zealously Americanized (the flag is used
as a lifesaving weapon for example), that Independence
Day seems the only appropriate time of year to
wholeheartedly accept it. Like Emmerich's ID4, this is
obvious propaganda where the Americans are the hapless
underdogs motivated by freedom for all. Sure it's
predictable and melodramatic, but for a moment after
leaving the theater, I was dumbfounded with
patriotism. And isn't that the point of The Patriot? </P>
<P>Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, the lionized French and
Indian War veteran, who, at the beginning of the film,
is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed
away. He is left to father seven children at his South
Carolina estate along with black servants (not
slaves!). As the Revolutionary War rumbles miles away,
Martin swears to keep his family close and away from
the battlefields. But when the oldest son enlists
anyway and another is murdered by a wicked Redcoat
colonel (Jason Isaacs), Martin quickly decides to save
the day (or save the fate of America as presented by
Emmerich). Forming a band of aggressive farmers and
using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of
war, Martin becomes the number one target of the
British Army. </P>
<P>The best parts of The Patriot are the scenes in which
Martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the British
armies left and right. Every time the farmers attacked
the unsuspecting enemy, to see the disbelief on
British General Cornwallis' (Tom Wilkinson) face was
priceless entertainment. And as the tension gradually
formulates with the running time, a final battle is
inevitable. </P>
<P>As for the numerous battle scenes, they are expertly
done. Clearer and more realistic than those of
Gladiator, the gruesome images are what give this film
an R rating. You really get a sense of how warfare was
performed during that time period. Everything is
performed in an orderly (but still quite gory) fashion
- one side shoots, then the other side, then the
remaining soldiers charge. It's organized, strategic
and, according to Martin, ineffective. There is a very
interesting contrast between the traditional battle
style and Martin's take-no-prisoners method. </P>
<P>What drives Martin to these supposedly unfair actions,
are the originally brutal tactics of Colonel
Tavington. Played wonderfully by Jason Isaacs,
Tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his
horse at civilians, who nervously avoid eye contact.
This character is viciously evil; he kills women and
children and then laughs about it on the way home;
even his eyes are evil. His portrayal has sparked some
controversy in Britain, some claim that he falsely
represents his countrymen as "cowardly" and
"sadistic." I disagree with this accusation. Tavington
does not represent his country; his unnecessary
executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his
General. Besides Tavington, the Redcoats remain stick
figures that are neither glorified nor patronized. And
stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds
of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the
bad guys? Heck, why not spend the entire film glossing
up the good guys?</P>
<P>The Patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks.
With an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book
villain ready to take him down, it's a Lethal Weapon
for the colonial times. God Bless America! And God
Bless The Patriot!</P>
