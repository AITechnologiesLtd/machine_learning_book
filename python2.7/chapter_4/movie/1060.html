<PRE>                          ROBIN HOOD, PRINCE OF THIEVES
                       A film review by Scott T. Eggimann
                        Copyright 1991 Scott T. Eggimann</PRE>
<P>          Capsule Review:  An exciting, captivating adventure film about
     the classic story of Robin Hood and his quest to fight evil and
     return justice to the poor people of England.  Rating: +3 (-4 to +4);
     Worth the full admission price.</P>
<P>     Many years have passed since I first read the story of Robin Hood
and his band of merry men.  Since then, the closest I've come to the
story has been through Walt Disney's animated version.  The story I
remember is a childhood fantasy depicting the epic battle of good versus
evil and the current movie holds onto that theme.  This movie is not
getting good reviews, and I'm not sure why.</P>
<P>     Having a small background in European history during the Crusades
certainly enhances the numerous references to that period, but it is not
necessary for understanding and enjoyment.</P>
<P>     Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) certainly follows all the steps
of the classic hero.  He goes off to fight with King Richard in his
quest to convert the barbarians to Christianity.  His decent to the
underworld is where we first see him.  Robin is a prisoner in a Turkish
prison.  His successful escape brings with him the Moor Azeem (Morgan
Freedman) -- a little irony here, his enemy in the Crusades.</P>
<P>     In the first ten minutes of the film, Robin is firmly established
as a hero (in the literary sense).  With this type of introduction, I
was prepared for either a big let down or a continuation of this
theme.  I was not let down, Robin actually makes several symbolic trips
to the underworld to turn this movie into an exciting adventure story.</P>
<P>     The relationship between Robin and Azeem is a perfect union.  Robin
is a representative of the allegedly "civilized" English people and
Azeem is a representative of the so called "barbarians."  Ironically it
is Azeem who shows the barbaric nature of the English people during King
Richard's reign.  Their relationship shows that two enemies can combine
to fight a common foe; once in Turkey and again in England.  The two
learn from each other and provide the spark to lead other men to a cause
greater than anything either of them had faced before.</P>
<P>     Beautiful breathtaking scenes permeate this movie.  One image is of
Robin's father exiting his castle dressed in his black battle armor on
top his black steed preparing to battle the overwhelming mob in front of
him (reminiscent of the suicide scene in the beginning of DANCES WITH
WOLVES, that Costner had just completed filming).</P>
<P>     Humor is rampant through the movie.  I was not prepared for the
Sheriff of Nottingham.  He is actually a very funny person, his facial
expressions and comments are very comical.  Once you accept that he can
be a funny person and laugh at his humor, he becomes a much more
enjoyable character.  The Sheriff is a complex character who you can
never quite figure out.</P>
<P>     Leave your expectations at home about some of the more memorable
stories of Robin Hood:  I don't quite remember the whole story I read,
but I don't remember any mentions of the Crusades, and I definitely
don't remember the Moor Azeem.  Robin says he's robbing from the rich
and giving to the poor, but you don't really get to seem him giving away
all that much.   I guess the story had to be updated for a new
generation.  If this is the case, then I liked the updating.</P>
<P>     One more thing...  How come Robin did not have an English accent
while everybody else did?  I suppose an English actor or a language
instructor for Costner would have made the small details of this movie
more entertaining.</P>
<P>     I left the theater wondering if the situation were reversed, if
Robin would have followed Akeem to Azeem's homeland for saving his life.
I think he would have.  The successful relationship of the two is so
strong that I could accept the reversal of situations.  This isn't a
one sided relationship, both friends learn from each other.  Since these
two play such an important role in the success of the movie, we must be
able to believe they are sincere.</P>
