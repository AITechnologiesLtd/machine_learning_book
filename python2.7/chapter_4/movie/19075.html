<PRE>Cruel Intentions</PRE>
<P>Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon.
Directed By Roger Kumble
Running Time: 1 hour 35 minutes.</P>
<PRE>(Columbia Pictures)</PRE>
<P>The new brat packers continue to hit the screens with his updating of
Dangerous Liasons, which was last seen on the screen starring Jeremy Irons
and Glenn Close. Now we get Geller and Phillippe in the starring roles,
which is certainly 'different,' and not entirely successful. Geller plays
Kathryn, who makes a bet with her Sebastian (Phillippe) that he won't be
able to bed virgin Annette (Witherspoon,) who wishes to wait until marriage.
If Kathryn wins, she gets Phillippe's car, if not, Phillippe gets Kathryn.
Unfortunately for Sebastian, he starts getting feelings for Annette, and
isn't sure he can carry on with the bet. And Kathryn has another agenda of
her own, involving Cecile (Selma Blair) and her mother, played by Christine
Baranski.</P>
<P>Cruel Intentions is a well executed experiment that provides plenty of
entertainment for your money. Gellar is on the ball as the bitchy Kathryn,
she's acts like all the bitchy girls you knew at school, only worse. The way
she goes from her false, happy outlook to the disgust inside is nothing
original, but well played by Gellar. It is sometimes difficult to believe
this is the same character who plays the sweeter than sweet Buffy on the
popular television series, and is a rewarding performance. Witherspoon has a
low key role, but gives a nice performance, if a little underwhelming. She
gets the job done, though, and the audience feels for her as she gets played
as a stooge by Gellar and Phillippe. Phillippe, sadly, is less successful,
his acting a little stiff. He is rather evil, but his performance could have
been stronger. The real surprise in this film is the outstanding Selma Blair
as a little girl discovering sex, her performance is very well performed,
and all of her scenes work.</P>
<P>Apart from the above average acting, there's little else in Cruel Intentions
that distinguishes it from other brat pack movies. There's the usual
selection of rock music making up the soundtrack, and some 'hip' incidental
music. The film goes at a cracking pace to make sure no attention is lost
from the largely teenage audience, and the film is over blidingly fast. This
is a shame, because with a little more time the characters could have been
more rounded. Instead, we're just expected to believe that Gellar is a bitch
and nothing else. Phillippe, near the end of the film, gets some development
to his character, but by then it's too late. Again, only Selma Blair gets
any character development during the film.</P>
<P>The direction by Kumble is largely straight forward, but the pace is quick
and interest is maintained. Kumble also adapted the script, and the Gen-Xer
script isn't nearly as embarrassing as it could have been, and is
surprisingly adult and sensible, if a little two dimensional. Unfortunately,
a Dawsons Creek cast member pops up as Sebastians gay friend, but thankfully
he's not in the film for long.</P>
<P>Overall, Cruel Intentions is a nice film with some good laughs and fun
twists. There's nothing original here, and the story has been done many
times before. And when leaving the cinema, the film will probably leave your
mind after a couple of minutes. But while it's lasting, Cruel Intentions is
a fun ride.</P>
