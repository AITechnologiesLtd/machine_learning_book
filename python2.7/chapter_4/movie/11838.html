<PRE>BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Barney, that heartthrob of the preschool set, finally has his own
movie.  Entitled BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE, the picture, about following
a magical egg, keeps its plot to a minimum.  Marketed sometimes as
BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE: THE MOVIE, it would more aptly have been
labeled BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE: THE SING-ALONG.  The little ones, who
would be happy to watch Barney sing the phone book, will probably like
the movie, which delivers large doses of their favorite overstuffed
dinosaur.  Those hoping for more than just a long, outdoor version of
Barney's TV show, they will likely be disappointed.</P>
<P>     The story opens with a cynical youngster named Cody (Trevor
Morgan) going to visit his grandparents, played by George Hearn and
Shirley Douglas, on their farm.  Along with Cody are his sister Abby
(Diana Rice) and her friend Marcella (Kyla Pratt).  For a film aimed at
the 2-7 year old set, the decision to cast child actors all around
10-years-old seems surprising and inappropriate.  There is a
one-year-old who has a few scenes, but most of the movie features these
three older kids and Barney.</P>
<P>     "You don't need cable TV to look at on a farm," Cody tells himself
sarcastically as he looks out from his window onto a group of pigs.
"You'll have scenery to look at."</P>
<P>     Thanks to a little water, the girls' toy Barney turns into a
real-life one, who sings and dances various short numbers.  Cody thinks
he's way too cool for Barney, but - surprise - by the end of the movie,
he will be hugging him and singing-along too.</P>
<P>     Even allowing for the lack of a real script, the actors
demonstrate very little acting talent.  With the humans getting more
screen time than Barney, their weakness drags down the movie
considerably.  And then there's the overall look of the picture.  As
filmed by Sandi Sissel, normally a television cinematographer, the
multicolored sets look flat and dull.  Only in the magical scene of the
host of hot-air balloons does Sissel rise above the drab.</P>
<P>     The movie does have its silly, little delights.  Baby Bop keeps
appearing out of nowhere to search for her missing yellow "blankee."
She asks the audience where it is, and sure enough, someone moves it
just before Baby Bop can find it.</P>
<P>     BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE runs just 1:15.  It is rated G and is
appropriate for all ages.</P>
<P>     My son Jeffrey, almost 9, said that at his age he "kind of liked"
the movie, but that he suspected younger kids would like it.  Jeffrey's
biggest complaint was that there were way too many songs.</P>
