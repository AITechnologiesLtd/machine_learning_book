<P>   The men of Stepford, Connecticut (remember?) are
delighted with their new, subservient wives in Bryan Forbes's
dynamite sci-fi picture, "The Stepford Wives."  What's more
the wives themselves are ccstatic.  That sounded like a
win-win situation until Ross and Prentiss deciphered a
dastardly conspiracy. .  </P>
<P>   When 43-year-old Peggy Sue goes back to her high-school
class in Francis Coppola's "Peggy Sue Got Married," she is
disgusted that her classmates are such goody-goodies that
they would not even accept a note she tries to pass to them. </P>
<P>   What's so bad about being nice, even perfect?  Director
David Nutter explains in "Disturbing Behavior," a sci-fi film
which, like "Stepford" and "Peggy Sue" sends up conformity
and suburban bliss and champions individualism and, by
implication, urban living.</P>
<P>    While "Disturbing Behavior" is demographically directed to
a high-school and college market, the parents of teenagers
are the ones who should see it.  So should doctors who
prescribe Ritalin and even Prozac for kids who are diagnosed
as depressives but who really cannot--and perhaps should
not--fit in with others who are intolerant of those who are not
already members of their clique or, in the case of this picture,
their cult.</P>
<P>   To make his point about the harmful effects of mindless
conformity, first-time feature film director David Nutter--
previously known for TV episodes like "The Commish,"
"Booker," "21 Jump Street" and "ER"-- promotes a witty,
sharp-talking student named Gavin (Nick Stahl), a kid who
does not fit into any group in school and stands outside all as
a kind of Greek chorus commenting on the social structure of
the institution situated in the small town of Cradle Bay. 
Honing in on the new kid in town who also appears unwilling
to make new friends, he deconstructs the lunchroom by
pointing out the social design in the movie's keenest speech. 
He points to the "motorheads" on one side of the room whose
drug of choice is beer; the nerds, who turn on to Apple PCs
and whose drug of choice is Saturday night Jasmine tea;the
skaters who imbibe ecstasy; and the elite Blue Ribbons, a
clean-living lot whose excitement comes from donating car
wash services and arranging cake sales.  Now these Blue
Ribbons appear the ideal teens except for a couple of
difficulties: they cannot tolerate, much less socialize with,
those who are beneath them (in one scene one of their
number kicks over the janitor's pail and calls the custodian a
retard); and when certain forbidden, all-too-human desires
(read: lust) struggle to rise to the surface, they go ballistic. 
One guy gives in to his passion and kills the girl who excites
him.  Nor are the young women exempt: one such lovely in
the throes of lust bangs her head against the mirror and
bloodies herself up real good.</P>
<P>   Like the characters in Eugene Ionesco's "Rhinocerus," all
but one of whom eventually turns into a beast, a single lad in
this picture struggles to keep his individuality.  Steve (James
Marsden), whose parents unwisely moved him and his sister
out of Chicago into the sticks of Cradle Bay after the suicide
death of their brother, is determined to get to the bottom of
the mystery of the adaptive youth. Together with another rebel
Rachel (Katie Holmes), he discovers the conspiracy to
tame rebellious kids and suppress their natural, adolescent
aches.  Scripter Scott Rosenberg is no Ionesco, however.       </P>
<P>   Some of the scenes are gripping, particularly those
involving chases and a visit to an institution for psychotic
children who apparently failed to turn into Blue Ribbons.  The
film, however, takes quite a bit of time to get to the core of
the town's condition, instead hitting us with a series of choppy
vignettes that are simply confusing.  One scene involving
surgical implants is remarkably uninvolving and, given the
factor that this sort of business has been done quite a bit
before, "Disturbing Behavior" fails to do an original take on
the theme of compulsive compliance with group norms. 
Perhaps, though, its young audience will not have been
through the mill with stories of this nature, especially if they
never got to pore over what was once required reading,
"Catcher in the Rye."  For such an audience, there are
valuable lessons, and there are guides as well for the moms
and dads.  If you're a kid and your folks say time and again
"We want only what's best for you," watch out: they may really
mean that they want what's best for them.</P>
