<P>     I suppose it was inevitable given the confluence of trends.  The
surprising success of THE ENGLISH PATIENT, culminating in its sweep of the
1997 Academy Awards, proved that there is an audience for sweeping period
romance with a political dimension; the phenomenal success of the STAR
WARS re-release demonstrated that there was an audience for re-worked
versions of classic films.  Warner Bros. claimed that this "definitive"
version of the legendary 1942 film CASABLANCA has been in the works for a
while to coincide with its 55th anniversary, but the timing seems a bit
too convenient.  Whatever the reasons and however the suits at Warners
might be trying to spin it, this re-release probably strikes fear into the
hearts of movie lovers everywhere, yet it need not do so.  Under the
supervision of the Warner Bros. marketing department, CASABLANCA has been
updated with intriguing results, and may find a new, younger audience it
never had before.</P>
<P>     The story, of course, finds American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey
Bogart) operating a nightclub in Casablanca during the Second World War
with friend and piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson).  Rick is content to let
the swirling political events go on without his interference, but that is
before, out of all the gin joints in the world, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman)
walks into his.  Ilsa is an old flame, the one that got away, now married
to resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) after leaving Rick at a
train station in Paris.  Laszlo is wanted by Nazi authorities, and the
letters of transit obtained by Rick are just the ticket to get Laszlo out
of the country.  Rick must choose between honor, love and
self-preservation as the much-desired letters of transit become the most
wanted items in Casablanca.</P>
<P>     The familiar story of CASABLANCA is quite enough to warrant another
trip to the big screen, but the elements added in this new version make it
perhaps even more compelling.  Max Steiner's glorious score has been
digitally re-mastered, providing a lush background for the film.  New
sequences include an additional exchange between Rick and rival club owner
Ferrari (Sidney Greenstreet) which did not make it into the original
version due to technical limitations.  Greestreet has been
computer-generated for this sequence, and the character provides an
amusing reaction shot when Rick steps on his tail while moving around him.
Dooley Wilson's famous rendering of "As Time Goes By" has also been jazzed
up, given a more up-tempo arrangement and the addition of more background
dancers.  Most impressive is the final scene at the airport, where
Laszlo's plane takes off and soon explodes with a spectacular corona
effect.</P>
<P>     A dozen well-known screenwriters have also contributed to this effort
by providing additional dialogue and sub-plots which flesh out the story
and characters.  Joe Eszterhas gives Ilsa a new dimension by making her a
predatory bisexual, fascinated by the innocent young girl whom Rick saves
from the clutches of Renault (Claude Rains).  Quentin Tarantino adds a few
choice expletives to Rick's conversations with Renault and Ferrari,
including an exchange regarding the racial politics of contemporary radio
programs, while Carrie Fisher (who also makes a cameo appearance in a
bronze bikini) gives Ilsa a few barbed comebacks to Rick's hard-edged
reactions.  The least effective additions may be those provided by Woody
Allen, who makes Rick considerably less decisive when he consults a
therapist before deciding what to do with the letters of transit.</P>
<P>     Undoubtedly there will be film purists who consider the mere idea of
such supplementary material to be a travesty, but there is a danger to
such knee-jerk, reactionary opposition to the opportunities modern
technology can provide.  Perhaps the nay-sayers would have denied us the
chance to see Fred Astaire tap-dancing with a vacuum cleaner, or Marilyn
Monroe hawking Chanel No. 5.  This is not your father's CASABLANCA; indeed
it is something more.  Sacrifice is for suckers in the 1990s, and this
version acknowledges that reality when Ilsa slips out through the cargo
hold after planting the bomb which sends Laszlo to the only place where
resistance genuinely is futile.  CASABLANCA: SPECIAL EDITION will only be
available in major markets to begin with, which is a true shame.  Perhaps
intense support in cities will allow others the chance to see the problems
of two people amounting to a hill of beans, and a pile of money.</P>
