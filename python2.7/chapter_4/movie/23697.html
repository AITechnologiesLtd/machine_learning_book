<P>Here on Earth (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starrng Chris Klein, Leelee
Sobieski, Josh Hartnett, Michael Rooker, Annette O'Toole, Annie Corley
and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Mark Piznarski</P>
<P> For young filmgoers - the audience for which it is targeted - "Here on
Earth" may be a new experience.</P>
<P> These days, most relationship stories dealing with young men and women
center around how quickly he (she) can connive to get her (him) into
bed.</P>
<P> Not so with "Here on Earth." This is an old-fashioned love story. It's
flawed, a bit saccharine and at times plays like a Hallmark movie of the
week, but it just drips with sincerity and stars three very attractive
young performers.</P>
<P> The three protagonists in "Here on Earth" are stock archetypes: The
arrogant, snobbish, rich boy humanized by love; the young girl wiser
than her years; and the best friend who's a bit rough around the edges
but ultimately displays an understanding and kind heart.</P>
<P> That these characters are played by Chris Klein, Leelee Sobieski and
Josh Hartnett make the clichés palatable.</P>
<P> The plot: Klein's Kelley Morse - rich, Boston-bred, private school
educated - is put on probation and sentenced to spend the summer in
small-town Putnam, Mass., helping to rebuild a diner that was destroyed
because of a drag race in which he and townie Jasper Arnold (Hartnett)
were the perpetrators.</P>
<P> Sobieski is Samantha. Of course, everyone calls her Sam, and she is
Jasper's girl until ..</P>
<P> Aw, you can figure out the rest without me.</P>
<P> During the course of "Here on Earth's" approximate 105-minute running
time we learn that Kelley's haughtiness hides a sensitive soul. How do
we know? Because he can quote Robert Frost.</P>
<P> We also learn that Sam has a dark secret, and that Jasper's tough
veneer also is a masquerade.</P>
<P> Prodded on by a sappy score by Andrea Morricone, son of legendary
composer Ennio Morricone, "Here on Earth" leisurely flows from one scene
to the next.
The movie is slow, but never dull.</P>
<P> A fine supporting cast of adults, including Annie Corley, Michael
Rooker, Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood, keep the younger performers
on their toes.</P>
<P> The trio of young people are well lit and perform admirably. Sobieski,
especially, looks eerily like a young Helen Hunt, and her acting ability
improves with each role.</P>
<P> Klein who was most enjoyable in "Election," here seems buffed and
bronzed. He appears to strain trying to play the bad kid, but relaxes
when his good qualities are allowed to break through.</P>
<P> Hartnett is touching in the `other guy' role and holds his own with his
contemporaries.</P>
<PRE> "Here on Earth" is not a great movie, nor is it a bad one.</PRE>
<P> It's kind of refreshing to see a movie in which young people are not
sex-crazed adolescents with only one thing on their minds.</P>
<P> Who knows. "Here on Earth" may ignite a romantic spark in you.</P>
