<P>Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson</P>
<P>Visually interesting but emotionally vacuous, Sam Miller's Among Giants
stars Pete Postlethwaite as a painter who falls in love with a tomboy
(Rachel Griffiths).  Postlethwaite and Griffiths are both good, but the
love story is too inconsequential to gather any kind of momentum (and
the film is far too short to develop the characters adequately). 
There's also an extended scene in the middle that features gratuitous
frontal nudity of both characters, and it's more likely to elicit laughs
than anything else.  But Among Giants is still very pretty to look at,
thanks to Miller's majestic direction, and the colorful group of
supporting characters is at least marginally interesting.  </P>
