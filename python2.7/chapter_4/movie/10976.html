<P>"Deep Rising" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively: Not 
only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the 
middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace, but the unfolding story is artificial, 
silly and almost completely derivative of countless other (and, for the most part, 
better) films. While dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- 
take, for example, the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's "Anaconda" -- "Deep 
Rising" has no tongue to put in its cheek. Folks, we're only a month into the new 
year, and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases. </P>
<P>Most of the action takes place on the Argonautica, a luxury liner in the middle of 
its maiden voyage (uh-oh -- if these people had seen "Titanic," then maybe they'd 
have known to stay home) when it's attacked by a giant, tentacled sea creature . The
only survivors are slinky jewel thief Trilian (Famke Janssen), Argonautica owner 
Canton (Anthony Heald) and a few other crew members. A mercenary team, lead by 
resourceful captain John Finnegan (Treat Williams), board the Argonautica looking 
for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby. But what their search of the 
ship uncovers is something blood-soaked, hungry and not very helpful. </P>
<P>The main problem with "Deep Rising" is its overt familiarity; the movie makes 
absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in 
recent memory. The concept is "Leviathan" meets "Titanic," with a dash of "Speed 2" 
thrown in for good (or is that bad?) measure. This monster is equal parts "20,000 
Leagues Under the Sea" and "The Relic," knows how to open doors like the Raptors 
from "Jurassic Park" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim (a neat effect, 
admittedly) a la the giant snake in "Anaconda." Some of the attack sequences are 
straight out of "Jaws" and "Alien." A scene where the remaining survivors have to 
travel under water to escape death is right out of "Alien Resurrection." There's 
even a jet ski chase like "Hard Rain." And the list goes on. </P>
<P>Watching "Deep Rising"'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself, because 
none of them have well-developed characters, nor do they seem to project even the 
slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy. Williams is affable enough, but his 
Finnegan just isn't believable. An interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted; 
pretty Famke Janssen, best known as "GoldenEye"'s killer thighs, is trapped in a 
forced romantic interest with Williams, while Kevin J. O'Connor, as Finnegan's 
mechanic, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast. 
Djimon Honsou, who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in December's 
"Amistad," pops up in a brief part. He needs to stay away from the water. </P>
<P>The movie's final shot is a groaner, as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot 
involving an on-ship saboteur. As if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't 
bad enough (when you taunt the monster, you're really asking for it), "Deep Rising" 
is a slow, stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot. And since we 
all know that the higher the casualty rate is, the closer we are to the end of the 
movie, rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the 
question. </P>
