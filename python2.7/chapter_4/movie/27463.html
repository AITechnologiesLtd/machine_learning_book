<PRE>                           STATE AND MAIN
                  A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: David Mamet has written a very
          funny and very telling film about the making and
          unmaking of a film.  Like a madcap DAY FOR
          NIGHT, the story has many of the film crew and
          actors work out their lives while the director
          will go to any lengths, legal or illegal, to get
          some film made, whether it is the original story
          or not.  This is probably David Mamet's most
          enjoyable film to date.  Alternately wacky and
          endearing.  Rating: 8 (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     David Mamet originally came to the public's attention by
writing stories of hucksters and con men and corporate crime.  He
wrote stories like his mysterious play "The Water Engine," HOUSE OF
GAMES, and the Runyonesque THINGS CHANGE.  The man is a writer and a
director, and he wrote about crime as a personal interest.  Now he
has written a film about con men he really knows.  His STATE AND
MAIN in a large part about a con man a director and a nearly honest
and innocent writer coming to conflict over an adaptation of the
writer's play.  Mamet has sprinkled in a number of other characters
from film-making but he has written about things close to his own
experience.  The result is a sort of madcap comedy in which Mamet
the director gets to argue with Mamet the writer in the middle of
the chaos of making a film.</P>
<P>     Mamet gives us a view of the film-making process as being one
large, crazy circus.  The film the film company has come to town to
shoot is THE OLD MILL.  They had already been ready to film it in
New Hampshire and had a great mill set they actually built, but
something happened and, well, now they are filming in Waterford,
Vermont, instead.  Waterford was chosen because of its classic old
mill.  Unfortunately, they are not going to be able to use the mill
because, well, something else happened.  Now they are madly trying
to make things fit.</P>
<P>     At the center of the chaos, and few films make the film-making
process such a storm of chaos, is Walt Price (played by William H.
Macy) the Machiavellian director who will do absolutely whatever is
necessary to have a film all shot when the storm dies down.  Part
con man, part genius he jumps from one crisis to the next in
seconds, frequently changing his personality to fit the
circumstance.  The writer, Joseph Turner White (at last a starring
role for Philip Seymour Hoffman), would like to have Price's film be
at least reminiscent of the script he had written for it and the
play it was based on.  Meanwhile White finds himself attracted to
Ann Black (Mamet regular Rebecca Pidgeon), a townie who had read his
play and actually seems to understand it better than he does
himself.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile in the background the other cast and crew members are
adding to the confusion.  Adding to the confusion is a lead actress
(Sarah Jessica Parker) who has found religion and refuses to shoot
her nude scene and a heartthrob lead actor (Alec Baldwin) with a
predilection for strong drink and under-age girls.  Add to the mix a
totally unscrupulous producer (David Paymer) with a goal to save
money wherever he can and nearly as clever at getting what he wants
as Price is.  But the film has a large cast and several stories are
working themselves out at the same time.</P>
<P>     As is frequently the case, Mamet has carefully crafted a script
with a plethora of clever touches.  The film being made is based on
a play of pretentious claptrap, yet most of the themes of that play
are exemplified, and probably better, in the film STATE AND MAIN
itself.  The issues that the play is about are also the issues that
the filmmakers have to face.  Several of the decisions about the
film being made seem to be mirrored in the outer film.  Mamet
demonstrates a flair for one-liners that few of his previous films
have demonstrated.  The film is a treasure chest of running gags and
self-referential jokes.  Mamet's dialog is well-delivered if not
entirely realistic and believable.</P>
<P>     STATE AND MAIN covers territory previously covered by films
about shooting films like DAY FOR NIGHT and LIVING IN OBLIVION and
to a lessor extent films about the industry like THE BIG PICTURE and
THE PLAYER.  Still the script is one of the better ones of the pack.
I rate it 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4
scale.  And trust me on this one: you want to stay through the end
credits.</P>
<P>     Now I have done it.  I am going to get a bunch of people
writing me saying they walked out on the credits and asking what
they missed.  Do not read the following until you have seen the
film.  Here are jokes in the credits rotated 13 letters (rot13):</P>
