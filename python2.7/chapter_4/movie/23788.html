<PRE>                               THE SKULLS
                    A film review by Christopher Null
                      Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com

<P>     A secret society so powerful it can get away with murder.  A secret
society so exclusive it firebrands everyone who joins with its mark.  A
secret society so secret... it has a big logo up on top of the
building!?</P>
<P>     You know something is rotten with THE SKULLS right from the
get-go.  I mean, what self-respecting prep school-Ivy League snob would
join an organization with a name as stupid as "The Skulls"?  Well, Luke
(Joshua Jackson) would be, for one.  Only he's no preppie.  He's a
"townie" with no money, but even though he's of the Lower Classes, since
he's such a good rower (yes, "the skulls," I get it), he's a shoo-in for
the secret society.  A mysterious invitation arrives, and Luke is
whisked into a world of power and money, where men in red robes usher in
beautiful women for the taking at tuxedoed parties.  Before you can
utter "Fidelio," Luke has become One of Them.</P>
<P>     Luke is soon partnered with a "soul mate" (not making that up),
Caleb Mandrake (MEET THE DEEDLES' Paul Walker) with whom he is supposed
to keep no secrets.  But uh-oh! when Luke's roommate gets jealous and
threatens to expose the entire society when he steals Caleb's key to the
secret chambers (remember, that big skull on the roof points the way
in).</P>
<P>     A cover-up ensues and Luke romances "Popular" star Leslie Bibb, and
then come a grand series of plot twists so asinine you'll want to join
in with the laughter and mockery of the audience if only doing so didn't
make this movie even worse.  Its desperate earnestness makes it even
more laughable (with none other than Craig T. "Coach" Nelson lording
over it all), and by the time 45 minutes are up, you'll probably be
ready to leave.  I know I was.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, teens don't read movie reviews, so this critique
will likely be lost on anyone who cares.  Would that they would put
their collective foot down.  The last thing we need is another bad movie
that simply serves as an excuse to sell a soundtrack.</P>
