<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Imagine that you talk your three best friends into giving you their life
savings for you to wager in a can't-miss high-stakes poker game.
Imagine that, despite your remarkable card-playing skills, you somehow
lose everything and even end up in debt to a fellow named `Hatchet'
Harry, a local crime boss and porn king that once beat a man to death
with a gigantic black rubber marital aid.  Imagine Harry tells you that
if you don't cough up his cash within a week, he'll send his henchman,
Barry the Baptist, to start chopping off the digits of you and your
friends.</P>
<P>That's the basic plot of Guy Ritchie's exhilarating big-screen debut,
which was a critical and box office hit in England and the darling of
this year's Sundance Film Festival.  Ritchie's inspired directing
technique, especially during the aforementioned card game (where it
almost feels like you were actually punched in the stomach), is actually
one-upped by his splendid script, which also includes a drug kingpin, a
group of degenerates led by a guy named `Dog,' a stoned group of pot
growers, two idiot hitmen, a father-and-son debt-collecting team, a pair
of antique shotguns and a bartender played by Sting.</P>
<P>Sound confusing?  It is for a while, but Ritchie ties everything up so
deliciously in the last ten minutes that you can't help grin as the cast
is hilariously thinned out by a series of misunderstandings and bad
timing.  What starts out as a hodgepodge of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting
and Reservoir Dogs slowly becomes as enjoyable and visually stylish as
the films from which Lock, Stock draws its comparisons.  For fans from
across the pond, look for notorious soccer bad-boy Vinnie Jones as the
debt-collector Big Chris and the late bare-knuckle fighting champ P.H.
Moriarty as Barry the Baptist, a man who earned his name for his
drowning interrogation style.  The film also has a great soundtrack
featuring The Stooges, The Stone Roses and James Brown.  Produced by
Trudie Styler (aka Mrs. Sting).  (R – 1:05 extreme violence, adult
language and brief nudity)</P>
<P>JON'S INTERVIEW WITH LOCK, STOCK STAR VINNIE JONES</P>
<PRE>`It's been emotional.'</PRE>
<P>That was the final line delivered by Big Chris, a vicious debt collector
in the new, highly stylish British import Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels.  The funny thing is that he utters it with as much vigor and
emotion as a Stallone or a Van Damme.</P>
<P>But the actor playing Big Chris isn't a `big' action hero – he's Vinnie
Jones, a major star in English soccer making his film debut in Lock,
Stock.  Describing his thuggish role, Jones says, `He's very tough and
he's got a lot of respect on the street.'  Jones adds `He takes his boy
with him, Little Chris, and he's teaching him the ropes, but he's also
trying to teach him manners.'</P>
<P>The scenes featuring Big and Little Chris are some of the most
entertaining in the film.  And the irony isn't lost on Jones, who has
been known to strike fear into the hearts of opponents on the soccer
pitch.  `When I'm on the football field, I've got like a Jekyl and Hyde
character; I know that,' Jones continues, `But I'm just going out there
and I want to win, and sometimes that gets you into a lot of trouble.'</P>
<P>Trouble, indeed – Jones has been ejected from ten matches in his career,
but that kind of passion might be what caught the eyes of casting
directors.  The 33-year-old Welsh star might sound like somewhat of a
British Dennis Rodman – he made a few cameo appearances on British TV
and even hosted his own award-winning television talk show.  `It was a
lads' show really,' Jones notes, `It was based in a pub and we had a
live audience sort of thing.  I'd invite guests into the pub, three or
four at a time, to talk about football and women and magazines.'</P>
<P>And that's not the only acting experience on Jones' resume – he also
grappled with Stone Cold Steve Austin when the World Wrestling
Federation made a stop in London last December.  `I got in and knocked
him out and I had a couple of fights with The Bossman,' beams Jones,
also noting that there isn't much difference between acting in the WWF
and acting in feature film.</P>
<P>`My energy is going to be toward movies now,' Jones remarks, `If I get a
big enough part, I shall just hang the ol' boots up, I think.'  He has
played for such prestigious English clubs as Chelsea, Leeds, Sheffield
United and Wimbledon, the team he first signed with in 1986, giving up
his less glamorous job as a brick carrier.  He hasn't played since
November, when he was passed over for a coaching job at his last club,
Queens Park.  `I think the football part of my life is drawn to an end
and this (film) is another challenge I want to get on with.'</P>
<P>Jones couldn't have picked a better film for his debut; Lock, Stock was
a monster hit in England, earning the princely sum of $19.3 million on a
paltry $1.6 million budget.  Describing the reactions at screenings
during the Sundance Film Festival, Jones says the audience reaction `was
brilliant – it's been getting standing ovations.'  The film, best
described as a cross between Reservoir Dogs and Trainspotting, was the
only film that generated widespread excitement at Sundance.</P>
<P>Up next for Jones is writer/director Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock
follow-up, The Diamonds.  But the London Sunday Times reports that Jones
is in negotiations to play a British spy in the upcoming Tom Cruise
vehicle, Mission Impossible II.  `I haven't received any phone calls
about it, but you never know,' muses Jones. `I'm just an apprentice in
this business at the moment.  I just don't know how things work or
anything like that.  It's flattering to be even mentioned in that
context.'  Ironically, the same newspaper also reported that Cruise
plans to shoot an American version of Lock, Stock.</P>
<P>After The Diamonds, Jones says, `I don't really have any plans.  I'm
just going to see how this movie goes out here and see if we get any
offers of any other bigger movies.'  He reflects on his career by
stating, `It's fantastic.  I suppose it's any lad's dream to be a big
football player and then try the chance of being in movies.  I've done
this very much for a challenge, just for a change of direction and it's
all snowballed.'</P>
<P>We should all be so lucky in our careers.</P>
