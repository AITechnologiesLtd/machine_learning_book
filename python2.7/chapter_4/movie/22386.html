<P>Starring Rob Schneider, Oded Fehr, Eddie Griffin, William Forsythe, Chi
Chi La Rue. Directed by Mike Mitchell. Rated R.</P>
<P>Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo is so much better than most
of the crap the similarly idiotic, infinitely higher-profile Adam
Sandler has made (with the possible exceptions of The Wedding Singer
and Happy Gilmore) that it's almost tempting to recommend it. And had
the movie been more of a knee-slapper, I might have done just that;
unfortunately, this eminently likeable movie is only mildly amusing.
First-time feature director Mike Mitchell made a decent frame of a
movie -- including a main character that actually develops -- but he
forgets to suffuse his goofball, gross-out comedy with laughs.</P>
<P>The title character (Schneider) is actually a fish-tank cleaner by
trade. One day he gets himself a gig cleaning the expensive fish tank
of the enigmatic and very European Antoine. Deuce soon finds out just
what Antoine does for a living, and nobody describes the occupation
than Antoine himself: "women pay me to give them pleasure." Deuce
responds "I'm gonna kill my guidance counselor!"</P>
<P>Well, Antoine has to go away to Switzerland for six weeks and he
entrusts Deuce with his house and his fishtank (not forgetting the
ominous "you mess up anything and I'll kill you!"). Needless to say, on
his first day on the job, fishtank goes bye-bye thanks to Deuce's
overwhelming curiosity about Antoine's fancy exercise equipment. This
leaves Deuce with six weeks to obtain enough money to replace the tank
and clean up the mondo mess he made. No prizes for guessing Deuce's
cash flow sourse of choice.</P>
<P>Yes -- Deuce gets himself a pimp, played by Eddie Griffin. He hooks
Deuce up with various colorful dates. One is named "Jabba the Slut,"
weighing in at some 600 pounds. Another has Tourette's syndrome and
spouts random obscenities at innocent passers-by. Yet another is
grotesquely tall, with a suspiciously manly voice. We never see the
latter's face. Aside from these freaks of nature -- pleasuring whom is
repulsive but very lucrative -- there is one normal girl, the one Deuce
inevitably falls in love with. Her little secret I dare not reveal,
though you can probably guess it from the trailers.</P>
<P>To my surprise, I really warmed up to Deuce Bigalow the person. Unlike
some of Sandler's subjects, who tend to be meanies, retards or
similarly unlikeable types, Schneider's misbegotten Gigolo has a warm
heart and is not an utter moron. What's more, his character actually
goes someplace, rather than just being used as a tool to elicit cheap
laughs (though there are plenty of those). It's nothing groundbreaking -
- I don't want to over-analyze this feather-light fare or give it more
credit than it deserves -- but by the end of the movie I felt like
Deuce Bigalow was a happier person and I actually cared.</P>
<P>While Deuce Bigalow fulfills the daunting task of inserting likeable
characters into the script, it doesn't quite do it when it comes to
laughs. Aside from a couple hilarious The Matrix parody sequences,
there just isn't much here to incite the kind of fall-off-your-chair
belly laughs the ads seem to promise. I won't say that all the gags
fall flat but none of them are memorable. I laughed or chuckled
intermittently but the movie just wasn't as funny as I was hoping.</P>
<P>After watching Deuce Bigalow, I'm not convinced that Rob Schneider is a
bankable leading man. He's successful here, but before this movie, he
was only known as "the delivery guy in Big Daddy" or "the guy who
shouts 'You can dooooo it!' in The Waterboy". This will streamline his
career, but it is hardly a star-making turn. Schneider is a talented
actor, but he needs something more challenging (sophisticated?) than
this. Adam Sandler (who, by the way, executive produced this) proved
that he wasn't a hack in the sweet, romantic, smart The Wedding Singer.
If Schneider doesn't want to be remembered as "that gigolo" for the
rest of his career, he needs a more significant comedic role.</P>
<P>This is an entertaining diversion, nothing more, nothing less. It's not
exactly riotous but it's more than watchable. Deuce Bigalow is probably
more hit than miss, though not quite a bullseye.</P>
