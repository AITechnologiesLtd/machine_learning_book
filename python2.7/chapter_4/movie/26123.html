<PRE>_The_Watcher_ (R) 1/2* (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        There is a germ of an interesting idea buried in _The_Watcher_,
but any chance of that idea developing into the basis of an intelligent
thriller was completely obliterated when the thought of stunt casting
entered the picture.  So instead of an engrossing psychological chiller,
we get a fairly pro forma serial killer pursuit pic where the madman is
played by... Keanu Reeves.  Any wonder why not a single scare nor
suspenseful moment is to be experienced in this amazingly anemic film?</P>
<P>        The potentially interesting idea lost in the muck is the
exploration of the strange symbiotic relationship between a killer and
his pursuer.  In _The_Watcher_, the killer is Reeves' David Allen
Griffin, who stalks his young female prey before strangling them with a
piano wire; the pursuer is Joel Campbell (James Spader), an FBI profiler
who worked on the Griffin case during his initial killing spree in Los
Angeles.  Burned out after working that case--without ever capturing
Griffin--Campbell has since left the bureau and the City of Angels,
living a layabout life in Chicago that is perked up only by non-stop
intake of prescription drugs and frequent visits to his shrink, Polly
(Marisa Tomei, struggling to get back on the studio A-list in a thankless
role).  But it isn't long before Griffin turns up in the Windy City,
prodding Campbell into a cat-and-mouse game that brings him back to the
Fed fold.</P>
<P>        I get the impression that the story as originally conceived by
Darcy Meyers and David Elliot was less about catching the killer--which
is what the finished _The_Watcher_ ostensibly is, a routine genre
exercise--than about something more interesting: that being how lawmen
become defined by the perps they track, and vice versa.  But any probing
psychological dimension to this story is drowned out by Joe Charbanic's
overdirection.  Heavy on the quick edits and stylized visuals, it comes
as no surprise that Charbanic is another music video vet making the big
leap to the feature film world.  While flashiness has its place on the
big screen, the seems strangely out of place in a film whose content
suggests something darker and grittier (further exemplified by Spader and
Tomei's sullenly earnest performances); the gloss makes the film that
much more difficult to believe.</P>
<P>        Ultimately nudging _The_Watcher_ from "difficult to believe" to
"impossible to believe" is the ruinous presence of Reeves.  Charbanic
directed videos for Reeves' band Dogstar, and I'd like to think it's that
connection--and studio execs' taste for stunt casting--is what led to
this stunning example of miscasting.  It is inconceivable that anyone
could sincerely believe that he of the affectless voice, erratic speech
rhythms, blank face, and bobbing head could convincingly convey any sense
of evil or menace, and Reeves' performance just confirms how limited his
range is.  His Griffin is serial killer as laid-back surfer dude, and
never once do we believe someone this incredibly goofy could have evaded
the authorities this long.  Whenever Reeves shows up, any level of
believability that the film has managed to generate (mostly courtesy of
Spader) goes rocketing out the window.</P>
<P>        And, unfortunately, Reeves shows up quite frequently in
_The_Watcher_, and Charbanic and the rest of the crew fail to compensate
with the pedestrian, suspenseless plot twists, which lumber toward a most
unsatisfying climax.  As such, the only fright likely to be experienced
by moviegoers is the fact that they spent hard-earned money on such a
turkey.</P>
