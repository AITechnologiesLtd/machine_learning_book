<P>You gotta hand it to the Coen brothers. Even with the great success of FARGO
a few years back, they have still managed to maintain their integrity, their
quirky filmmaking nature and their innate ability NOT to sell out. This film
is yet another example of the original work that these guys have been
putting up on the screens for close to 20 years now, with an obvious passion
for their projects and very little priority placed on commercial success.
Don't get me wrong, their films surely pay back their investment and then
some, but much like Woody Allen and his successful streak of films year
after year, the Coen brothers seem to make movies primarily because they've
got a boatload of characters to share with the world, and quirky stories to
divulge. Blockbusters are not what these brothers are about.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Set in the South during the 1930s, three men have just escaped a chain gang
in order to retrieve the treasure which one of them buried before his
capture. On the way to their final destination, the bumbling threesome run
across various colorful characters including a fast-talking one-eyed bible
salesman, a black man who just sold his soul to the devil in return for
musical talent, a trio of sexy sirens, the KKK and many other quirky members
of the Deep South personnel.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Another original piece set forth by the Coen bros, who continue to charm us
with their unique knack for poetic dialogue, quirky characters, musical
melodies and eerily authentic looks at the days of old. And despite this
film being a little slow at times, a little too long for its own good and a
little weak in the "romance" end of the story, it still managed to keep me
entertained for most its outing with plenty of peppered one-liners, a great
chemistry between the three leads, catchy tunes and a rock-solid performance
by George Clooney. Now when the heck did he suddenly become a movie star and
an actor?!? Wow. Here Clooney shines as the leader of this pack of con men,
with a twangy accent in tow, a great delivery of his overly literate
dialogue and a hilarious running gag about his hair. I just could not take
my eyes off this guy when he was on the screen. A great turn for Mr. Clooney
(and a nice Clark Gable-ish 'stache to boot). The other two scoundrels also
follow suit with top-notch performances of their own offbeat personalities
as do the rest of the cast, with plenty of fun and engaging moments of their
own. There was however at least one character for whom I didn't care much.
And seeing as the film did run a little too long, I think it would have been
a tighter flick with a little snip here and there.</P>
<P>But ultimately, much like any other Coen film, you either like it or you
don't. I did and despite many of its characters obviously having graduated
from the RAISING ARIZONA school of highly tuned dialogue (just not as
flat-out funny), I got into it and would recommend it to anyone looking for
something different. This film will doubtfully be a commercial hit because
it simply doesn't have much to say and doesn't entertain on a "general
audience" type of level. Its story isn't a grand one and its over-emphasis
on the use of musical ditties is unlikely to appeal to the masses, but the
film certainly will not disappoint Coen fans and/or anyone looking for a
little variety in their cinematic diet. I for one enjoyed the film on the
whole, thought it could've used a little more structure and one or two less
characters, but appreciated its overall creative outlook. I also can't seem
to get that darn hit song from the movie out of my head, so I guess that's
always a good sign. Love 'em or hate 'em, they're the Coen bros and they're
here to stay.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars: (taken from the IMDb)
The title of this movie is taken from the title of the film the director
wants to make in Preston Sturgess' Sullivan's Travels. Homage is paid to
that film via a scene in which a lot of chain-gang members are brought to
watch a movie in a theater.
This film is based on Homer's "The Odyssey" and several references can be
found throughout: The names of George Clooney and Holly Hunter's characters
(Ulysses & Penelope), the one-eyed Big Dan as the Cyclops, the three girls
by the river as the Sirens and the old-man disguises at the end of the film.
Stephen Root, who plays the radio station owner in this film, also played a
radio station owner in the TV show "Newsradio".
The character of Tommy Johnson is based on famed blues guitarist Robert
Johnson who, according to folk legend, sold his soul to the Devil at the
crossroads for his legendary talent.</P>
