<P>     There seem to be two ways in which films typically handle serial
killer storylines.  Either they create messy exploitation flicks with
lots of blood and gore, little plot, and even less characterization
(the FRIDAY THE 13TH series, for example); or they give a blunt,
hard-hitting view of the subject (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER,
MAN BITES DOG).  As with any generalization, there are exceptions, but
probably no more than I can count on my fingers.  Curiously enough, the
latest mass murderer motion picture, called KALIFORNIA, falls somewhere
in between the two extremes, and may end up leaving viewers from both
camps somewhat dissatisfied.</P>
<P>     In the name of research for a book he's writing on serial killers,
Brian Kessler (David Duchovny) decides to take his girlfriend Carrie
(Michelle Forbes) on a cross-country car trip with stop-offs at famous
murder locations.  Hoping to find someone to split the costs with (his
car gets only eight miles per gallon), Brian advertises on a local
college bulletin board.  Only one couple answers the ad:  Early Grayce
(Brad Pitt) and Adele Corners (Juliette Lewis).  They look flat broke,
but Brian still invites them to get in the car, hoping that they can
come up with the cash.  During the first stages of the journey, Brian
gets along with the newcomers, but Carrie is wary, and for good
reason--Early is a murderer, and as the distance to California lessens,
the body count piles up.</P>
<P>     If you can get beyond the huge coincidence that sets up this
motion picture, you're in for a chilling ride.  Sure, it's a little
hard to swallow that a guy writing a book about serial killers should
happen to have one in his car, but this is one of only a few instances
where an obvious plot device is used.  There are other occasions when
formulas come into play (such as the ending), but they are not greatly
in evidence, and not every situation is resolved in the expected
manner.</P>
<P>     KALIFORNIA is a partially-successful tale about conscience and
cold-blooded murder.  The film takes the time to develop (with varying
degrees of success) all four characters, so that when the truth comes
out, events gain a resonance they wouldn't have with the lifeless stock
personalities inhabiting the average thriller.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that all the characters are likeable, or even
fully fleshed out.  By the end of the movie, Early Grace is still
something of an enigma, although certain elements of his brutal,
psychopathic behavior have been made clear.  Adele seems too naive to
be real, and at times her childlike whining becomes annoying.  Brian
and Carrie are the easiest to identify with, probably because they're
the most "normal".</P>
<P>     This is no HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.  The impact is far
less wrenching, but some similarities run deeper than on the most
superficial levels.  Like HENRY, KALIFORNIA doesn't glamorize its
killings, opting more for the visceral than the grotesque.  There's
also quite a bit of intellectual speculation about what motivates
serial killers.  While some of that is out-of-place, it keeps the
audience constantly questioning why Early sometimes reacts as he does.</P>
<P>     Of the four principal actors, Brad Pitt gives the least impressive
performance, probably because of the nature of his character.  Early is
all rage and self-righteousness.  He's never likeable, and Pitt doesn't
put a whole lot of effort into showing any humanity.  There are times
when Early comes perilously close to a caricature.</P>
<P>     Juliette Lewis is a little better, but great range isn't required
for Adele, either.  She's pretty much a simpleminded character who
refuses to believe the awful truth about her boyfriend.  She shows all
the classic symptoms of a victim, some of which are displayed a little
too obviously.</P>
<P>     David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes give the strongest
performances, and since they're the ones we're supposed to identify
with, the realism invested in Brian and Carrie lends added depth to
KALIFORNIA.  These two are fascinated by killers, but that fascination
quickly turns to horror when they realize what they have with them in
the back seat.</P>
<P>     KALIFORNIA is disturbing, and while it doesn't overdo the blood,
neither is the violence understated.  The basic premise should be
enough to keep the meek away--if you have no desire to see a film that
follows a serial killer, stay away from KALIFORNIA.  Those who don't
mind their movies sprinkled with moments of discomfort will find that
this picture packs a little more punch than a traditional Hollywood
slasher flick.</P>
