                       A film review by Randy Parker

<P>        With LETHAL WEAPON 2, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and director
Richard Donner have created a Hollywood rarity: a worthwhile sequel.
Although the movie doesn't quite live up to part one, it does succeed in
recreating the slick mix of humor, action, and character that made the
original a superior crime thriller and a $70 million hit at the box office.
Gibson and Glover are still teamed together as partners, bickering and
teasing one another like a long married husband and wife.  Gibson has
remained wild, daring, and cool under pressure, and Glover, as always,
finds himself reluctantly agreeing to his partner's crazy plans.  However,
since the first film, Gibson has become more stable; we no longer question
his will to live or fear that he's on the verge of exploding.  The
charismatic performances by Gibson and Glover help distinguish LETHAL
WEAPON 2 from other cop films.</P>
<P>        The movie finds the two detectives chasing down vicious drug
dealers while at the same time protecting the man whose testimony is
crucial to the investigation.  The plot is pedestrian and full of holes,
but who cares when we're having so much fun?  As the key witness in the
investigation, Joe Pesci delivers an inspired comic performance with his
grating personality and nasal-voice.  Between Pesci's constant whining and
Gibson and Glover's playful rapport, the movie has plenty of laughs.</P>
<P>        The two leads play off each other especially well when Gibson
discovers that Glover has spent the night sitting on the toilet ... and for
good reason.  The villains have boobytrapped it with explosives.  Glover
dare not stand up, let alone flush.  In another clever scene, Glover
creates a diversion for Gibson at the South African Consulate by pretending
he wants to emigrate to South Africa.  "But you're BLACK!" responds the
horrified immigration official.  "I want to join my brothers in their
struggle against oppression!" Glover snaps back as he starts a big
commotion to distract the security guards.  Equally amusing is Gibson
returning home to his messy trailer and discovering (much to his dismay)
Pesci vacuuming and neatening up.</P>
<P>        LETHAL WEAPON 2 has one car chase too many, but otherwise it's an
exhilarating roller coaster ride of action and suspense.  The movie
maintains a high level of intensity from beginning to end.  The brutal
violence doesn't always mesh with the humor, but for the most part they
exist harmoniously side by side.  LETHAL WEAPON 2 has a large body count,
but it pushes all the right buttons to make us accept, and even root for,
the violence.</P>
<P>        Screenwriters Shane Black and Jeffrey Boam have blessed the movie
with despicable villains who are worthy of a James Bond film.  Joss Ackland
plays the Minister of the South African Consulate--a cold, murderous
criminal who hides behind his diplomatic immunity.  As his right-hand man,
Derrick O'Connor is equally deplorable, a heartless killer in his own
right.  These villains need not have been South Africans (in fact, the
movie could have done without its underdeveloped political undertones), but
their politics makes them all the more creepy.</P>
<P>        The only area where Donner and his cast come up short is in their
attempts to give the movie some substance and the characters some depth.
The film tries to develop Gibson's character, but its efforts are
superficial.  For example, to show that he has regained his ability to
love, the film throws in a superfluous affair between Gibson and Patsy
Kensit.  Their encounter is just window dressing, a feeble attempt at
character development.  Glover fares no better; his character development
is limited to one small plot strand about his daughter appearing in a
condom commercial.  The filmmakers should have known better than to worry
about making the characters complex; the movie is already overflowing with
big laughs and rousing action.</P>
