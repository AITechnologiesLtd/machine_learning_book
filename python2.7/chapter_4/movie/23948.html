<P>THE WHOLE NINE YARDS (M).  
(Warner Bros/Village Roadshow)
Director: Jonathan Lynn
Stars: Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Natasha Henstridge, Rosanna Arquette, 
Amanda Peet, Kevin Pollak, Michael Clarke Duncan, Harland Williams
Running time: 98 minutes.</P>
<P>Murder, marital discord, hit men and mercenary killers combine
to produce some unexpected belly laughs in this curiously appealing
black comedy, filmed largely in Montreal.</P>
<P>Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky (Friends star Matthew Perry) is an
uptight dentist increasingly stressed out by the demands of his money
hungry wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette, with a funny accent) and his
equally mercenary mother-in-law.  The answer to their various dilemmas
arrives in the form of Jimmy Tudeski (Bruce Willis), a former mob
hitman turned informer, who moves in next door.  Learning that Jimmy
is wanted by Chicago gang boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), Sophie
persuades Oz to go to Chicago and collect the reward money for turning
him in to the mob.  Then she informs Jimmy of her husband's actions in
the hope that he will kill him.</P>
<P>Events get wildly out of control when Oz meets Jimmy's
estranged wife (Natasha Henstridge, from Species, etc), and quickly
falls for her.  Meanwhile, Oz's pretty young receptionist (Amanda
Peet) turns out to be an aspiring assassin herself with a fan-like
adoration for Jimmy's past work.  With $10,000,000 at stake for the
survivors of the final confrontation, loyalty amongst killers is thin
on the ground.  While audiences may occasionally become confused with
the details of who is double crossing whom along the way, everything
is resolved neatly by the end.</P>
<P>The cast seem to have had a good time while making this film,
and their enjoyment is reflected in their enthusiastic performances.
Perry seems more comfortable with his role here, and turns in his best
screen performance to date.  He seems to have an affinity for the
slapstick nature of his role, and suffers the brunt of the movie's
pratfalls, walking into doors and falling off chairs, whilst
maintaining some dignity.  Willis seems to enjoy sending up his
taciturn, laconic tough screen image with this broadly comic turn as a
sensitive hit man with a complex set of moral values.  Pollak provides
some fine humour as the crude gangster whose biggest crime is his
relentless mangling of the English language.  Michael Clarke Duncan
(recently seen in the superb The Green Mile) lends his formidable
presence to the role of Frankie Figs, the hitman whose loyalties are
uncertain.</P>
<P>Written by first time screen writer Mitchell Kapner, The Whole
Nine Yards is the latest screen outing for British director Jonathan
Lynn (best known for his work on the classic tv sitcom Yes Minister,
and films such as My Cousin Vinny, etc).  Lynn has a good eye for
clever visual gags and he maintains a reasonably cracking pace
throughout the convoluted turns and twists.  Unfortunately, Kapner's
sense of invention does not quite last the distance, and he seems to
run out of fresh ideas before the final showdown.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, The Whole Nine Yards is an entertaining mix of
black comedy and broad slapstick humour that works a treat, and is one
of the funniest films to hit our screens so far this year.</P>
