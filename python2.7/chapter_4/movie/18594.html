<P>The old saying is that you "shouldn't judge a book by its cover." 
Perhaps that is true in the field of fictional literature, and perhaps 
it is not. But it certainly doesn't hold true in Hollywood. Notting 
Hill, the first major motion picture from director Roger Michell, may 
not be overtly obvious from its title, but you needn't look much farther 
to discover what the production really is. The movie is a combination of 
the oldest, most proven plot in cinema, a love story; premium character 
humor; and top quality acting from two household names. This combination 
brings forth a brilliantly fun and beguiling film, that ranks among the 
best date films of the 90's. However, to quote the work itself, Notting 
Hill is "no Jane Austin." </P>
<P>Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is an American actress at the top of her 
field. She is considered to be one of the movie business' top leading 
ladies, and is even on the cover of Newsweek. With all of her fame has 
come financial success as well. For her latest film she was compensated 
$15 million. But Anna is forlorn. Much as Woody Allen demonstrated in 
Celebrity, fame has certain aspects that are not so glorious. And as a 
sexual icon, Anna experiences them all. The tabloids prey on her like an 
eagle on its dinner, and privacy is the rarest of things. She even 
resorts to checking into hotels under cartoon characters' names. </P>
<P>William Thacker (Hugh Grant) is a prosaic British man. He lives in 
Notting Hill, England, where his largest claim to fame is probably his 
blue house. He has the absolutely mundane job of running a travel book 
store so small that for a celebrity to enter would be an extraordinary, 
unprecedented event.</P>
<P>Keeping with the tradition of nearly every romance in the history of 
cinema, the two protagonists meet via an unusual set of circumstances 
and fall madly in love. In this case, the events include spilled orange 
juice, a poorly written travel book, and a shoplifter who uses his 
trousers for assistance. However, unlike most films of this genre, the 
great obstacle standing between William and Anna for the two hours that 
the film occupies, is not someone else, or something else, but 
themselves. Notting Hill is the story of opposites attracting, then 
being forced to deal with the opposites and still create a nirvanic 
state. In this sense the production goes one step further than, and 
actually deals with the realities that follow. </P>
<P>Aside from being a wonderful romance, Notting Hill is a hilarious film. 
The humor is largely based on character traits, not punch line jokes, 
although some do find their way into the script. A good example is 
William's house maid, Spike (Rhys Ifans). His scraggly appearance mixed 
with the character's lack of responsibility make for a light, enjoyable 
moment every time he is on screen.</P>
<P>In order for a film of this nature to be successful, the acting must be 
stellar. Roberts and Grant make for an absolutely enchanting on screen 
duo. The two are different actors, one sporting an English accent and 
the other a perfect typecast for the pretty-girl-in-bad-industry role, 
as she displayed in Pretty Woman. The contrast makes their job of being 
opposites very simple. Everything from the looks they exchange before 
kissing to their use of the English language works perfectly for their 
roles. Although they have both done better work before, the two actors 
certainly don't slouch here.</P>
<P>A love story is a love story. Whether it be Bogart and Bergman, Grant 
and Roberts or the leads in a 3rd grade play, the plot is always the 
same. But with the finite amount of variance allowed, Notting Hill does 
stand out. Between the characters, the acting and the man-meet-woman 
plot, this film is a solid work. I promise Jane Austin is nowhere to be 
found here, and this is one that you can judge by its cover.</P>
