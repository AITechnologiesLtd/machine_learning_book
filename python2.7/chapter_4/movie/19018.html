Danny DeVito - Sid Hudgeons</PRE>
<P>When this wonderful film was released, two things killed it at the box office.
The fact that it had very little advertising, and that it was overshadowed by
the lumbering monstrosity that was "Titanic". When masterpieces like this are
so completely defeated, it shows the rather sad state of affairs Hollywood is
in today.</P>
<P>The labyrinth plot is mainly about three cops. Ed Exley, who is a golden boy of
the LA police; Bud White, who is a maverick cop, playing by his own rules to
get justice; and Jack Vincennes, the celebrity cop who works with Sid Hudgeons
from the tabloid "Hush Hush" to get callers that will put his picture on the
front page. The three very different men are brought together by a shooting at
an all night coffee shop which claims the lives of over a dozen people. Soon
however, they are dragged through a maze of crimes ranging from prostitution to
heroin running, which reach through all levels of power in LA. </P>
<P>This film has it all. An incredible script, wonderful music, perfect and sets
and lighting effects, and some of the best acting I've seen in a long time. The
script is truly amazing, managing to take what should be a messy, convoluted
story and turning it into storytelling at its finest. Easy to follow, despite
the many subplots and characters. The characters are all real people that are
developed and defined to the point where the audience truly believes these were
real people. The music, by Jerry Goldsmith is perfect for the film.
Highlighting every scene and giving a great impression that this is really 50's
