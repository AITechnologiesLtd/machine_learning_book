<P>     The idea of parodying the Western, while certainly not a new
notion, hasn't been done in a while.  LIGHTNING JACK may be a perfect
example of why.  BLAZING SADDLES this definitely isn't.</P>
<P>     Riding into Junction City come the legendary Younger Gang, ready
to rob the bank.  Counted among the nefarious group is the Aussie
gunslinger Crocodile Dundee...er, that would be Lightning Jack Kane
(Paul Hogan).  The robbery goes bad, with Kane as the lone survivor.
At his next destination, South Fork, his attempted bank holdup turns
into a comedy of errors, the most grievous of which gets Jack saddled
with a hostage (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who wants to join up with him and
become an outlaw.</P>
<P>     LIGHTNING JACK is a well-meaning but completely lifeless comedy
that is short on humor and long on boredom.  There are numerous
examples of movies without a plot or a point, but few are as dull and
meandering as this one.  The laughs--which are supposed to be the
payoff--are occasionally amusing, but there's far too much dead air in
between.  Besides that, anyone having seen the theatrical trailer has
seen nearly every moment worth seeing.</P>
<P>     Scenes that have some comic potential turn out strangely sterile,
like the botched bank robbery and the attempts at turning Cuba Gooding
Jr.'s Ben Doyle into a dreaded outlaw.  The only ongoing gag that works
at all is Jack's obsession with his own image--he's insulted at the
thought that the reward for him might only be $200, then mollified
somewhat when it turns out to be higher.  This is not, however, the
stuff that great humor is made of, and that comes across
all-too-clearly in LIGHTNING JACK.</P>
<P>     Paul Hogan plays Jack Kane like his most famous creation,
Crocodile Dundee, thrown into a time warp.  While the actor is pleasant
enough to watch, this film is in desperate need of something beyond
"pleasant." With his name in the slots of co-producer, writer, and
star, Mr. Hogan can hardly be absolved from this travesty.  If he was
hoping to resuscitate an image battered by a pair of awful films
(DUNDEE II and ALMOST AN ANGEL), LIGHTNING JACK isn't likely to do it.</P>
<P>     It's a little embarrassing to watch Cuba Gooding Jr. perform the
pantomime-like antics of his mute character.  Mr. Gooding, whose career
started out at such a high level with BOYZ 'N THE HOOD, has shown up in
some poor pictures of late, including JUDGMENT NIGHT and HBO's
DAYBREAK.  The script treats Beverly D'Angelo worse than him, however,
relegating her to the role of the "token woman."</P>
<P>     It appears that Paul Hogan had one story to tell, and once
CROCODILE DUNDEE was made, the wellspring ran dry.  Trying to plumb it
once too often has resulted in a series of poorly-written,
mostly-unfunny motion pictures that the viewing public as a whole does
not deserve to be subjected to.  For now, Mr. Hogan should hang up his
spurs until a truly original impulse comes along.</P>
