<PRE>Being John Malkovich (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>review</PRE>
<P>1999 has been a good year for the movie industry. We've seen some new
techniques (The Matrix, Fight Club), new style (Blair Witch Project),
virtual stories (The 13th Floor), even indie movies (Go). But only one film
is a real mixture of everything new and the surprises of 1999, Being John
Malkovich.</P>
<P>Directed by well-known music video director Spike Jonze (he directed
Weezer's Buddy Holly, one of my favorite clips) and written by Charlie
Kauffman, this movie goes deep into the question of identity from the eyes
of a real (and I mean real as in non-fictional) identity without losing the
humor and without being too educational.</P>
<P>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer. He likes being a puppeteer,
because he likes the idea of being somebody else, of controling something
else. But like any other puppeteer he doesn't have a job, because "who would
want a puppeteer in this wintry economy?". He lives with his wife, Lotte
(Cameron Diaz in baggy pants, oversized sweaters, and ugly hairdo) who works
in a pet store and has too many pets at home, including a chimp that can
experience flashbacks subtitled in English.</P>
<P>To support his family, Craig finds a job at Lestercorp, located at the 7 1/2
floor of Mertin-Flemming building. Low overhead means lower cost. There he
meets attractive Maxine.</P>
<P>One day at his job, Craig found a portal leading to the brain of John
Malkovich for 15 minutes, and then coming out on the New Jersey Turnpike.
Craig was fascinated with this experience of being someone else, especially
a celebrity, because in modern day society, everybody wants to be a famous
celebrity. He tells this to Maxine and Lotte. Maxine wants to sell it for
$200 per person, while Lotte went straight in it and became addicted. She
even felt transsexual after her experience, questioning the whole idea of
sexual identity.</P>
<P>The three are tangled in a bizzare love triangle, with John Malkovich being
the host. John Malkovich himself finally found out about this portal, but
Craig could manage to be longer than 15 minutes inside John Malkovich. As
Craig takes over John Malkovich, he and Maxine take the opportunity to
become famous. And as the end comes near, we see that being a celebrity
becomes a bit boring after a while.</P>
<P>The whole concept of being somebody else in this movie is so very well
portrayed, including shots from John Malkovich' eyeview. The choice of John
Malkovich as the celebrity to enter is perfect. He is famous, but not as
highlighted as other big stars such as Brad Pitt or Pamela Anderson.
Everybody knows him, but not at first sight.</P>
<P>A wonderful movie, this one will be remembered as a breakthrough movie. And
we can sure expect more from Spike Jonze.</P>
