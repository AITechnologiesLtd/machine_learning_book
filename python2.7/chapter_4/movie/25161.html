<P>Martin Scorsese's "The Age of Innocence" did not sweep at the Oscars
back in 1994 as I had expected. "Schindler's List" and "The Piano"
stole some of its thunder, not to mention the similar tale of
repression, "The Remains of the Day." This film was also a major
departure for Scorsese, who is known mostly for the whirling intensity
of "Mean Streets" and "GoodFellas." What the hell is this raging bull
doing making a film about the social class structure of the 1870's by
way of Edith Wharton? Good question, yet Scorsese has proven to be
diverse in the past, from filming concert footage of the Band to
dealing with a feminist heroine like Alice from "Alice Doesn't Live
Here Anymore." "The Age of Innocence" is ironically among Scorsese's
greatest films, a sumptuous, delicate tale of repression and repressed
emotional violence.</P>
<P>Daniel Day-Lewis stars as a New York lawyer, Newland Archer, who
romantically yearns for the sexy, open-hearted Countess Olenska
(Michelle Pfeiffer) despite his plans to marry her cousin, the
childlike, innocent May Welland (Winona Ryder). But problems arise
such as Olenska's unsettled scandalous divorce, and Newland's
inability to cope with his deep feelings because of the strict class
order of practically all of New York. People seem to repress their
feelings because of fear of being ousted from family and friends -
Olenska comes dangerously close to being one of these people. As a
tearful Olenska says in one scene, "Does nobody want to hear the truth
Mr. Archer? Everyone asks you to pretend." She then follows that line
with: "Does nobody cry in New York? I suppose there is no need to."</P>
<P>I wasn't sure how Scorsese would direct this tale, or why he wanted to
do it. This is a director who seems to deal with characters that let
go of their emotions rather than keeping them bottled up. A tale of
this kind is often handled by the Merchant Ivory production team or
David Lean. I think it is finally the elements of tragic love,
repressed feelings, and internal emotional violence that attracted
Scorsese to the project, and he fuses these elements flawlessly. There
are the minute, carefully chosen details such as the three-course
dinners, manners of etiquette, and paintings that illustrate the
bravado of certain characters, such as Beaufort (Stuart Wilson), a
playboy that shames the family - his selection of nude paintings
directly reflects his character. Not to mention the grandly
ostentatious gossip-mongerer Mrs. Mingott (Miriam Margoyles), and her
plethora of paintings of dogs and a savage "Last of the Mohicans"
painting.</P>
<P>Scorsese brings this world alive as he did with the world of gangsters
in "GoodFellas" - you almost feel as if you went back in time to a
more innocent era. The cinematography by Michael Ballahaus captures
every single nuance and is particularly attentive to subtle details,
even in human behavior. There are throwaway moments that capture
glimpses of character, such as May Welland making a quick glance at
Newland when he says his goodbyes to Countess Olenska at
Mrs. Mingott's house. There is also the tender, touching, underplayed
scene where Newland is told by his son that May knew all along about
his love for the Countess. Any other director might have played up the
symphonic score or used distracting close-ups, but instead Scorsese
films it in one long take and as a two-shot. Less is definitely more
in terms of finding the right visual cues for this story.</P>
<P>The actors are all perfect and understated, probably more than they
ever will be. Daniel Day-Lewis astutely captures Newland's longing and
growing sense of desperation for what he cannot have. Michelle
Pfeiffer is both sensual and far more pragmatic than at the onset -
she magnificently captures Olenska's frail side and her need to be
accepted, though her behavior is unconventional. But the biggest
surprise is Winona Ryder, capturing the innocence of the title - the
seemingly naive May Welland who provides the emotional center. Her
frozen smile of recognition is haunting in the film, suggesting that
she is far more knowledgeable of her surroundings than she lets
on. There are also colorful supporting turns by the aforementioned
Miriam Margoyles, Richard E. Grant as the sarcastic Larry Lefferts,
Alec McGowen as the expert on gossip regarding all the families, and
Michael Gough as the important head of the van der Luyden family, who
orchestrate a formal dinner to matriculate Ole!  nska into society.</P>
<P>There is so much to love and take in from this film that you have to
see it more than once. See it once for the beautiful settings and the
extraordinary camerawork, and the second time for the finely tuned
acting and the emotions that threaten to explode in every one of the
characters. A brilliant tragedy in the style of Orson Welles's "The
Magnificent Ambersons," "Age of Innocence" will sweep you off your
feet and it will stay with you.</P>
