<PRE>                             THE LAST SEDUCTION
                       A film review by Phil Herring
                        Copyright 1994 Phil Herring</PRE>
<PRE>Written by Steve Barancik
Directed by John Dahl
Actors: Linda Fiorentino, Bill Pullman, Peter Berg</PRE>
<P>     Late last year I saw a quirky, stylish film called RED ROCK WEST
by the then little-known director John Dahl.  It had some of the
elements of a road movie (including, I might add somewhat facetiously,
Dennis Hopper), but was at its heart a thriller, with shades of film
noir (for example, the bad woman who leads a basically good man astray
with her womanly wiles).  It was solidly paced, with well-written
characters and an original plot, and I liked it.  In Australia, though,
it was released quite some time after it was made, and only saw a
limited release in a few art-house cinemas.</P>
<P>     So it was with some optimism that I approached THE LAST
SEDUCTION.  I wasn't disappointed (and neither was the appreciative
full house at Sydney's Dendy Cinema, which in general shuns the output
from the Hollywood factories in favour of more innovative product).
Dahl didn't write this film (script credit goes to Steve Barancik), but
it still bears a strong resemblance to his previous work.  It's dark,
and it features a rather naive young man being led astray by a smarter
and less scrupulous woman, who is seeking the removal of a troublesome
husband.  If you saw RED ROCK WEST, this much will be familiar,
especially when you find out that the film is set in a small town.  (I
might also somewhat cynically add that the main plot difference lies in
the woman being the drifter, and the man the local.)</P>
<P>     Such resemblances aside, the film is very different in mood and
pacing.  The action is set in a small town in upstate New York, a town
that seem to go out of its way to be boring.  The evil woman in this
film is Bridget, wife a bent doctor, who robs her husband of a large
sum of money gained from a one-off drug deal.  She's forced to hide out
in the tiny town of Benton, where she meets Mike, a local bored with
the small town after trying his luck in the bright lights of Buffalo,
N.Y., but back in his hometown after a failed marriage.</P>
<P>     Unlike Nicholas Cage's drifter character in the previous film,
however, Bridget (played by Linda Fiorentino) is no dummy--she's a
hard, manipulating bitch.  It's poor Mike (played by Peter Berg) who
gets sucked into a relationship that is, from the outset,
manipulative.  Watching Mike get used and abused by Bridget is the main
driving force in the film.  It will make you squirm.</P>
<P>     Bridget also has all the best lines.  Her opportunism and
objectivist ethos is so transparent that you just have to laugh at her
one-liners, showing as they do the sheer balls of the woman.  She's a
smart character, there's no doubt about that, and her plotting is a
times obvious and at others, utterly opaque.  Either way there's plenty
of suspense and action, mixed with laughs along the way--and although
the film doesn't take itself all that seriously (as indeed it
shouldn't), it's a brilliant piece of film-making, and well worth the
price of admission.</P>
<P>     The roles of the characters raise some interesting side issues,
however.  One element that I had to consider was the role of the
corrupting woman in this film, and by implication, in the genre of film
noir.  Although I really doubt that this film falls into the latter
category, it shares many elements with it, and even at moments invokes
DOUBLE INDEMNITY, the film that gave rise to the genre.  The waitress
in the Dendy's restaurant (which, incidentally, serves very good food)
expressed a *very* positive attitude towards the character of Bridget,
despite admitting that she is, essentially, a conniving bitch you'd
really rather not know personally.  While I fully admit that feminism
is about giving women choices (including the choice to be conniving
bitches), I'm not entirely sure that this film has shaken itself free
of the older ideas about the woman-as-corrupter.  This element was
important in the 1940s as an expression of the puritanism and misogyny
of the cinema of the day, but what does it suggest to the audiences of
1994? Mind you, THE LAST SEDUCTION doesn't insist on the same moral
ending as a film of the 1940's would, so maybe I'm leading myself up
the garden path here.</P>
<P>     What I *am* sure of, though, is the continued stereotyping of drug
dealers in Hollywood films.  It seems that every bad guy in a film
these days is a drug dealer.  There used to be some variety on this
score (note that THE GETAWAY breaks this pattern, but is a remake of
a much older film), but today it has become a cliche.  It's a sign of
the strength of this film, though, that neither of these particular
cliches get in the way of what is, essentially, a very fun film to
watch.</P>
