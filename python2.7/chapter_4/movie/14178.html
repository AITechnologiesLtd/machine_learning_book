<PRE>They Live (1988) 93m.</PRE>
<P>At last, a movie for those of us who wanted those X-Ray glasses we saw 
advertised in comics when we were kids.  Forgotten by all but John 
Carpenter devotees, this SF-horror flick is worth checking out.  
Ex-wrestler 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper plays a drifter who hooks up with a 
bunch of shanty-town dwellers.  Inadvertently he becomes aware of an 
alien conspiracy which has been in effect on Earth for years.  Produced 
while Carpenter's career seemed to be in a lull, this is nevertheless 
one of his most enjoyable outings; a snappy-paced romp that stays 
offbeat until its closing frames.  What's probably most appealing about 
THEY LIVE is that it confines its global-conspiracy storyline to a 
radius of a few miles and a timespan of a few days.  Carpenter, taking a 
cue from his own favorite SF films of the 50s, realizes that he doesn't 
need to play it big - further proof that his best work is with 
restricted budgets.  Consequently, the most memorable moments are the 
simplest: Piper taking a slow walk down the block, newly aware that it 
is replete with aliens; Piper and work buddy Keith David stubbornly 
duking it out in an alley; Piper being struck by a woman he has taken 
hostage.  </P>
<P>Film is based on a (very) short story by Ray Nelson but also borrows 
from the Devourers in Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar stories, positing aliens 
not as intergalactic warlords or rapacious monsters, but as the ultimate 
force in asset stripping and insider trading.  In this scenario, Earth 
will be destroyed economically.  The twist is that most of the 
population are unknowingly contributing to its downfall.  Carpenter 
throws in references to various forms of mass inculcation: subliminal 
persuasion, Communism (which the human rebels are branded in order to 
turn the public against them), propaganda, evangelism (the rebels 
broadcast from a church, and one of them is a street preacher), and most 
pointedly, consumerism.  With this in mind, the invaders are credited as 
ghouls in the end titles - those who would feed off the dead.  It points 
the direction of the film's satire: that media-induced conformity has 
left us so drained of individuality/vitality that we have let ourselves 
become ripe for the harvesting (Since Carpenter has already worked with 
aliens, vampires, and ghosts, THEY LIVE could be seen as his 'zombie' 
picture). </P>
<P>As with all Carpenter's films, this one is great to look at - he prefers 
to take his horror out of the shadows and into the hyper-real with 
sharp, clear photography and sparkling color.  Again, Carpenter 
contributes a businesslike, pulsating score (a touch bluesy this time 
around), and tosses in a minor trademark by having the characters 
watching an old horror movie on television.  Film has some shocks and 
violence but is mostly great fun - it's no coincidence that Carpenter 
counts it among his own favorites.</P>
