<P>The release date listed for RETURN TO PARADISE might be interpreted as a
typo, considering the fact that it's in release at the same time as
multimillion dollar blockbusters made for the masses. Certainly, this
deep and engaging drama might be more at home in late fall or early
winter, when films of this quality see limited but noteworthy release
and usually catch our attention several months later at Oscar time.
There is no doubt that this movie will be pulled under against more
glamorous products, but as was the case with earlier-this-year's
TWILIGHT and last year's NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN, sometimes there are
diamonds in the rough. </P>
<P>Strictly speaking, RETURN TO PARADISE (directed by Money Train helmer
Joseph Ruben) is not at the peak of its genre. It's a typical drama in
most ways: believable characters thrown into a plot with at least one
heart-wrenching or tearjerking event. But in other ways, it's atypical
in its subtle workings of these elements. Scenes do not scream of plot
development, and characters are larger than they originally appear to
be. Though Ruben cannot be credited with this - his delightfully
star-free cast is the power behind that plus - he manages to weave
everything together into a sturdy mold that does not fall apart upon
inspection. Simple and to the point, with a running time of less than
two hours, PARADISE is an enjoyable drama. </P>
<P>Most of the premise is laid out in the first thirty minutes, which tends
to make the last eighty minutes not as fun as they could be. Three
friends spend a summer in Malaysia, accumulating during their stay 104
grams of hashish. At the end of the summer, two of the group - Sheriff
(Vince Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad) fly back to the US with promises
to keep in touch. The other friend, Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix), will stay
at their condo a few days before moving on to Borneo to help a wildlife
preservation program. Before he can do that, however, police officers
find him and the hash. Lew, in possession of over a hundred grams, is
tried and convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death by
Malaysia's strict justice code. </P>
<P>Back in the States, two years later, a young lawyer named Beth Eastern
(Anne Heche) approaches Sheriff and Tony and informs them of the
situation. Lew is set to be executed in eight days, but if the two of
them go back and accept their share of the responsibility, the
government will grant Lew clemency. There will still be prison time
involved, but not without compensation, Beth promises. Then,
predictably, for the greater part of the rest of the movie, both Sheriff
and Tony turn their options over in their heads. Though somewhat slow,
this middle section builds to a final twenty minutes that is some of the
most powerful drama in recent memory. RETURN TO PARADISE is not always
on the mark, but it hits more than it misses and you're sure to find it
worthwhile, at the very least.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "RETURN TO PARADISE": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
