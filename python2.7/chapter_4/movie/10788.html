<PRE>                           ARGUING THE WORLD
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: The American socialist movement is
          traced following the trajectories of four Jewish
          intellectuals who were friends at CCNY in 1937.
          Each went in a different direction after leaving
          school, but each continued the tradition of
          argument.  This is not so much a contrasting of
          opinions as four different biographies showing how
          different events let them to different political
          conclusions.  The biographies are mixed with
          archive films covering half a century.  The film is
          good at what it does, but it really should have
          given us a better idea of what constituted each
          man's philosophy and why he believed what he did.
          ARGUING THE WORLD barely gets beyond the
          superficial.  The film is strong on its explanation
          of history but weak on philosophy.  Rating: 6 (0 to
          10), 1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>               New York Critics: 5 positive, 0 negative, 2
          mixed</PRE>
<P>     ARGUING THE WORLD is a chronicle of political thought in the
United States from the late 1930s though the 1980s.  More precisely it
is a study of four 20th Century political philosophers--Daniel Bell,
Nathan Glazer, Irving Howe, and Irving Kristol--who began their careers
in political philosophy as friends at CCNY, the City College of New
York, in 1937.  They all came from similar backgrounds.  They lived in
New York City where the sidewalks were often decorated with political
street speakers, and even before college each was immersed in political
thought.  One tells how his sister would take him to see Clifford Odets
plays, another how in front of his home were two buildings, the
synagogue and the Young People's Socialist League.  Born into poverty,
all four turned to Marxism as the hope for the poor of the world.  This
was a time when the revolution in Russia was fresh and new.  Many
Americans, from a distance of thousands of miles, thought that
Communism was in the process of saving the Soviet Union.  Take four
young radical thinkers, already drunk with politics, and send them to
CCNY and what develops is just what one would expect.  CCNY was then
one of the radical campuses of the day.  It was boiling over with
excited political debate.  As writer/director Joseph Dorman seems to
imply, the teachers were mediocre, but the best education was to be had
in the cafeteria where there were constant agitated debates.  The room
had a series of alcoves and different groups chose specific alcoves as
their turf.  Alcove One was where the pro-Trotsky students congregated.
Alcove Two was where the pro-Stalin students gathered.  (One wonders
what became of them.)  Another alcove would be the ROTC candidates.
These four Jewish intellectuals were Alcove One regulars.</P>
<P>     ARGUING THE WORLD traces the four through the war years with two
going into the military.  With the conquest of Nazism it seemed that
the world was ready for the Socialist ideal.  However, their view of
Stalin and of Communism changed with the Moscow trials and the purges
and executions of military leaders.  They started founding and/or
writing for magazines like "The Partisan Review" and "Commentary."
Irving Kristol started having a significantly different view from the
others during the McCarthy anti-Communist Movement.  While he did not
think much of Joseph McCarthy as a person, he defended McCarthyism.</P>
<P>     What has been a minor irritation with the film to this point
becomes more obvious and at the same time more serious.  One would not
write a biography of Charles Darwin without a detailed explanation of
evolution.  Dorman does not seem prepared to actually present the
beliefs of his four subjects in any great detail.  While the four
substantially agreed, it would have been useful to be told the
substance of their beliefs, but it was not important to understanding
their history.  But at this point, when they start to diverge in
opinion it becomes frustrating just to be told that Kristol agreed with
McCarthy's goals and Howe did not. These are deep and complex men with
complex ways of thinking, and to reduce their thought to so superficial
a level is a disappointment for the viewer.  Dorman wants to tell us
about the four men but not bother to tell us really who they are.  We
want to know Kristol's reasoning that led to his agreement with
McCarthy.  We want to know the reasoning the others had for their
different viewpoints.</P>
<P>     There is a further dividing of the ways in the 60s protest
movements and particularly in the relationship with the Students for a
Democratic Society.  The SDS was the self-styled successor of the
previous generation's intellectual movement.  But the four saw the SDS
as naive and utopian.  Instead of endorsing the SDS, each found himself
disagreeing with the SDS and Tom Hayden, the leader of the SDS,
attributed this to stodginess and de facto conservatism.</P>
<P>     There was further divergence of opinion based on experience of the
late 60s student protest movements. Nathan Glazer by this point was a
professor at Berkeley where the students were able very much to disrupt
the academic environment with impunity.  Glazer was called upon to
negotiate and in the process lost most of his respect for the
protesters.  His views became more conservative as a result, though not
so far to the right as Kristol's.  Daniel Bell was at Columbia where
the protests were put down with more force by the police and came out
of the experience more left-wing than before.</P>
<P>     Dorman recreates the period with archival footage showing New York
and California at the time of the events, but what is on the screen
frequently is just a scene without much obvious relevance to what is
being said.  There are also interviews with various political figures
who interacted with the four political thinkers. The film is
entertaining and enlightening, but it leaves one wanting to be in on a
discussion among the men to find out what the real differences in their
opinions and reasoning styles were.  Without that there is something
dramatically missing from the film.  I rate ARGUING THE WORLD a 6 on
the 0 to 10 scale and a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
