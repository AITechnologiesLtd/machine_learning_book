<P>     David Schwimmer (from the television series "Friends") stars as a
sensitive (and slightly neurotic) single guy who gets more than he
expected from the grieving mother (Barbara Hershey) of a classmate he
can't remember.  Hello Mrs. Robinson!  Though quite cute as a romantic
comedy, THE PALLBEARER is paced like a funeral march.  The characters
act, react, and interact at half-speed, making for one *excruciatingly*
long sit.  (And what's with the dreary lighting?) Co-writer/director
Matt Reeves brings some snap to the story's midsection; the film briefly
comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for
*another* classmate (a very appealing Gwyneth Paltrow).  By this time,
though, most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep.  Those
tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy-eyed Schwimmer, a
hound dog with a head cold, who can go for over an hour without ever
changing his expression.</P>
