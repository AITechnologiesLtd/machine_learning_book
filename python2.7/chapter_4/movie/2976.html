<PRE>                             IMAGINARY CRIMES
                       A film review by Eric Mankin
                        Copyright 1994 Eric Mankin</PRE>
<P>     Here's an unusual cinema event: a chance to watch Harvey Keitel
portray a seedy loser.  The latest one's named Ray Weiler, a low rent
deadbeat/con man and widower father of two in Kennedy administration
Portland, Oregon. "An opportunity like this comes once in a blue moon,"
we see him telling a mark, as his daughter Sonya (Fairuza Balk) cringes
in shame and embarrassment.  Haven't we seen this movie before?</P>
<P>     The details are different.  It's anchored in 1962, Sonya's senior
year in the private school that Ray has managed to talk her into.  She
is writing reminiscences of her earlier life, giving the film an
opportunity to dip into the past and follow Ray through the shipwreck
of a hundred inventions that don't quite work and mining claims that
don't quite pan out, through the death of Sonya's mother (Kelly Lynch)
and the illness of her sister Greta.  Sonya's writing talent brings her
to the attention of a kindly English teacher, and a chance at college,
as Ray's lies build to critical mass.</P>
<P>     Anthony Drazen (Zebrahead) directed the adaptation (by Kristine
Johns and Davia Nelson) of Sheila Ballantyne's coming of age memoir.
The acting is faultless.  Keitel could play this character in his sleep
from inside an iron lung; but he gets effective help from Lynch, Chris
Penn (as a disgruntled investor); and Balk, last seen in GAS, FOOD,
LODGING.  The scene and costume design is predictably perfect, down to
the pastel Melmac dinnerware and the harlequin revival eyeglass frames;
the music (by Stephen Endelman) is effective.  All that's missing is
any raising of the stakes beyond the most familiar strong-child-takes-
on-bad-parent interaction--in short, any surprise at all.</P>
