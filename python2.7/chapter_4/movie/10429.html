The Navigator (1924)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 67</PRE>
<P>"The Navigator" is a silent film starring Buster Keaton.
Keaton, as usual, plays an ordinary man who must learn
to perform extraordinary feats in order to win his love
interest.</P>
<P>Keaton plans his honeymoon, buying tickets for an ocean
cruise.  However, the plans are spoiled when his girlfriend
refuses to marry him.  Keaton goes on the cruise anyway.
A plot contrivance has Keaton and his girlfriend alone on
the ship, which has been set adrift by foreign agents.
Keaton must perform various heroic actions, especially to 
save the ship from a cannibal tribe.</P>
<P>Keaton has a flair for slapstick.  There is a scene
where he attempts to cook breakfast.  He does everything
wrong, with comic results.  Keaton dons a scuba suit
to repair the ship.  The resulting underwater photography
must have been innovative at the time.  </P>
<P>With the emphasis on slapstick, the stunts that are so 
spectacular in subsequent Keaton films such as 
"Sherlock, Jr." and "The General" are largely absent here.  
The battle with the cannibals is impressive, however,
with good panning shots of the island, the ship, and
the cannibals rowing towards it.</P>
<P>I have a few minor complaints about the film.  Keaton's
character makes an unlikely change from klutz to hero.
The word "formula" also comes to mind, as so many Keaton
films have him playing a clueless man trying to win a 
love interest.  Only the setting is different from 
"College", "Seven Chances", or "Sherlock, Jr."</P>
