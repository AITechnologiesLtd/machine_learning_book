<P>         When it was first published in 1985, John Irving's "The Cider
House Rules" aroused a fair amount of controversy because of its
staunchly pro-abortion stance. In adapting his book to the screen,
Irving has softened up its politics a bit and given a slightly
sentimental gloss to his extremely Dickensian tale of orphan Homer Wells
(Tobey Maguire) and his adventures in and outside the St. Cloud's
Orphanage. Even so, "Cider House" the movie is unlikely to win any
endorsements from the pro-life coalition.</P>
<P> Nor, for that matter, is it certain to enchant fans of the
novel, since Irving has pared his almost 600-page work down to its
essentials, cutting numerous characters and deleting scores of colorful
incidents along the way.</P>
<P> A couple of years ago, actor Tom Hulce won rave reviews for his
staging of "The Cider House Rules" as an epic two-part play at a Los
Angeles theater, and seeing the film might convince you Hulce knew the
material better than its author. The two-hour cinematic version of
"Cider" comes off as a piece of carefully written, warmly played
exposition leading up to a dramatic payoff that never materializes.
Bathed in an autumnal New England glow and tenderly scored by Rachel
Portman, this is an extremely pretty movie to look at and listen to, but
although Irving's basic plot remains, the richness of his prose hasn't
truly transferred to the screen.</P>
<P> The picture is directed by Swedish-born Lasse Hallstrom, who,
in the years since his breakthrough feature "My Life As A Dog," has
specialized in chronicling unorthodox and dysfunctional families ("Once
Around," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?", "Something to Talk About"). In
"Cider," the patriarch of the story is Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine),
who risks his career offering abortions to unhappily pregnant women in
WWII era Maine instead of dispatching them to back-alley butchers.
Homer, his assistant, has more qualms about providing such services,
until he meets first a beautiful orchard worker in the family way named
Candy (Charlize Theron), then the tragic Rose Rose (singer Erykah Badu,
doing impressive work in a difficult role) who carries both an unwanted
baby and a ghastly secret.</P>
<P> The title refers to a typewritten list of restrictions posted
in the bunkhouse where Homer, Rose and some of the other migrant workers
live. Everyone ignores the decrees, perhaps because as several
characters note, "sometimes you have to break the rules to set things
straight." Picking apples in and of itself certainly calls to mind the
Garden of Eden, and that's scarcely the most daring behavior these
characters indulge in.</P>
<P> Maguire brings an immediate likability to Homer -- he looks
almost like a young Dick Van Dyke -- and provides a solid anchor for the
saga. Caine is also fine, as are Theron and the charismatic Paul Rudd as
the young lovers who help introduce Homer to the world outside St.
Cloud's. Still, the movie stubbornly refuses to take off. Exactly what's
holding it back is unclear, but it could have something to do with the
way Irving and Hallstrom have tried to subvert a sprawling, occasionally
shocking epic of a book into a mellow, conventional mainstream film.
Somewhere along the way, "The Cider House Rules" turned into something
almost as safe as milk. James Sanford</P>
