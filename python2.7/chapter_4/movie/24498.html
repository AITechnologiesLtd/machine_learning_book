<P>         The geeky astronomer enters figures into a computer and
blanches when he sees the result. Surely it must be serious since it
causes him to toss the pizza slice he's eating back into the box, an
event underscored by a burst of menacing music.</P>
<P>  Heavens above, it turns out we poor earthlings are about to
be squished by a comet the size of New York!</P>
<P>  Does President Beck (Morgan Freeman) have a plan?</P>
<PRE>  Will anyone survive?</PRE>
<P>  And, most importantly, will struggling reporter Jenny Lerner
(Tea Leoni) get to be the MSNBC anchor person during Armageddon?</P>
<P>  These and many other burning questions arise during the
course of ``Deep Impact,'' an end-of-the-world scenario that is
alternately silly, sensational and soapy. But it's rarely moving,
although the screenplay by Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin does
everything but dice onions in an attempt to jerk tears. Somehow
though, when the curtain is coming down on life as we know it, it's
hard to fret about whether or not Jenny will make peace with her
frosty father (Maximillian Schell) or what will become of teen
star-gazer Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend Sarah
(Leelee Sobieski).  Not helping matters is the fact that Leo comes off
as irritatingly earnest, partially due to the script requirements,
mostly because of Wood's one-note performance.</P>
<P>  Leoni's intrepid newscaster looks practically paralyzed once
she gets on the air, reading bulletins in a thin, wavering voice that
would inspire millions to reach for their remotes.</P>
<P>  Obviously inspired by the 1951 sci-fi classic ``When Worlds
Collide'' - with elements of ``On The Beach'' thrown in - ``Deep
Impact'' takes a thought-provoking premise and submerges it in suds.</P>
<P>  While President Beck sputters sanctimony (``You will still
pay your bills,'' he warns), a crew of astronauts led by veteran
rocket-jockey Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall) takes off on a mission
to blow up the threatening comet. Everyone involved in this endeavor
has his or her own family troubles to contend with, and, added to
Jenny and Leo's woes, these subplots send the film's syrup content to
toxic levels.</P>
<P>  Disaster movies by nature are overwrought, but they
shouldn't be as consistently absurd as this. For example, Sarah's
doomed mom hands off her newborn to Sarah, who hops on a motorcycle
with the infant, leaving without a single diaper or bottle of formula.</P>
<P>  Somehow, no one in the Capitol seems to know about the
billions of dollars being secretly diverted into the construction of
the world's largest spaceship. And though everyone seems to know weeks
beforehand that the comet's impact will create a tidal wave that will
drown the East Coast, it appears there's no evacuation plan proposed.</P>
<P>  Director Mimi Leder seems clueless when it comes to staging
sentimental scenes, but she does have the proper touch for the movie's
few suspenseful patches, such as the truly scary sequences with Ron
Eldard and company racing against time to plant nuclear ``moles'' on
the comet's surface.</P>
<P>The scenes of cataclysmic catastrophe in the last 10 minutes
also are impressive and sometimes even imaginative. The image of the
head of the Statue of Liberty floating through the flooded streets of
Manhattan is particularly eerie.</P>
<P>  If only the filmmakers had stripped away the saccharine and
the self-importance of ``Deep Impact'' they might have found the kind
of haunting epic they're trying so hard to create. Instead they've
cooked up a crockful of hard-to-swallow melodrama, full of urgent
weddings and quickie family reunions. It would have been much more fun
to drop in on the folks who elected to party like it's never gonna be
1999.</P>
