<P>Prior to the showing of "Toy Story 2", a Pixar short from 1986 appears on the
big screen as an extra for coming to the theater. It is a very simple, basic
clip of two lamps playing with, and eventually popping, a plastic ball. The
short displays the origins of this outstanding computer generated genre and it
shows, after viewing "Toy Story 2", how far Pixar has progressed nearly 15
years later. The short is very satisfying even though it is a very ordinary
premise and because it was made the way it was made, it gives the feeling that
it was an experiment for something big in the future; A test to see if this
kind of animation is possible and is lasting. The viewing of the latest Pixar
flick proves that it is certainly lasting and, with the film's outstanding box
office success, it is certainly dominating.</P>
<P>"Toy Story 2" is a visual masterpiece. Every scene is wonderfully detailed from
a young boy's room, to an airport, to a vast toy store. The remarkable
detailing makes the film fun to watch and it gives the overwhelmingly
satisfying feeling that you must explore every image to really appreciate how
much hard work was put into it. What makes this sequel even more outstanding of
an accomplishment is that it remains as enjoyable as the original even though
the basic plot outline is exactly identical. Both films follow one character as
they struggle to identify who they are and where they belong. Also both films
follow a group of toys trying to rescue this troubled character from danger.
The overall message from this incredible series is that friendship lasts
forever, no matter how badly it is endangered. "Toy Story 2" starts out very
fast and from this point keeps you interested and vigilant. The opening scene
gives the adventures of Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) when he must face off, in a
pretend video game, against the evil Zurg, his arch nemesis. The action
presented here is very similar to the classic beginnings of "Raiders of the
Lost Arc" and, even more recently, "The Matrix" which leave a lasting
impression on the viewer throughout the whole movie. The opening scene of "Toy
Story 2" is definitely pleasing but it does not leave a lasting impression
because the action never stops after the video game. Immediately after, there
are a number of toys searching for Woody's (Tom Hanks) cowboy hat in a very
upbeat mood. The action never dies down, it just keeps coming at you from all
different directions. The animation helps this interminable action because it
creates a limitless atmosphere where anything can happen. </P>
<P>"Toy Story 2" tells one story in the wild adventures of being a toy. Woody,
Andy's favorite toy, is stolen by a greedy toy store owner (Wayne Knight)
because Woody is supposedly a valuable antique during the pre-Sputnik days. It
is up to Buzz Lightyear and company to try to help Woody return safely home.
Every actor providing their unique voices in "Toy Story 2" seem to be having
fun. This is a good thing because "Toy Story 2" is trying to be a fun movie and
only a fun movie. Every character from the original reprises their role here
with the same playful animosity as before. The new characters added, such as
Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack) and The Prospector (Kelsey Grammar) from
Woody's past, fit right in with the original cast. The most notable newcomers,
however, are two "Seinfeld" veterans, Estelle Harris and Wayne Knight. Both
fantastically bring their loud obnoxious characteristics into their
intentionally obnoxious roles. </P>
<P>The only dull moment in "Toy Story 2" is an unnecessary musical number about
Jessie's past. It just seemed out of place from the quickly paced format of the
rest of the movie. However, this song was only a couple minutes long so it did
not hold the film back for too long. Another small irritation was the title of
the film. "Toy Story 2" is the easy way out of titling a sequel. I find it hard
to believe these imaginative geniuses could not think of a replacement title.
These are small complaints against a big movie. "Toy Story 2" is a great amount
of fun for all ages. Multiple viewings do not hurt the enjoyment of this movie
because you will discover new tributes to other movies such as "Star Wars",
"Jurassic Park", and the other Disney/Pixar film "A Bug's Life". This one
should not be missed. </P>
