<PRE>                           NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     NBK opens in a cafe cum gas station in an isolated part of a
desert.  While Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson) is sitting at the counter
ordering, his girl friend, Mickey, (Juliette Lewis) turns on the juke
box.  Dressed in a tiny bra top and sexy tight-fitting clothes she does
a little dance by herself.  When three locals come in, one of them
starts dancing with her but when he thinks he is going to make headway
with her she suddenly kicks him in the groin and the whole place turns
into a mass shootout.  And that's just the first scene.</P>
<P>     During the film we meet Mickey's father (Rodney Dangerfield) an
abuser of his daughter; Robert Downey, Jr., as the host of a TV show,
"American Maniacs" who will do anything for a story for his program;
Tommy Lee Jones as a tough prison warden.</P>
<P>     The pace of the movie is frantic.  Frequently you cannot hear the
dialogue ... everyone is shouting at once and the music is blaring ...
but the "feel" of the film comes through.  The idea is that the media
hypes killers into notoriety and that there are enough idiots in this
world who look up to the killers as if they were heroes.</P>
<P>     All through the film there are quick flashes of predators such as
a wolf, a polar bear, snakes: natural born killers.</P>
<P>     Despite the total violence, none of it is for the sake of showing
blood.  It is an innate part of the story of killers without
conscience.  Except for the last scene which I found unreal, the movie
is a spellbinder.  Remember how enthralled everyone was watching TV
while O. J. Simpson rode down the freeway with the police cars following
and the helicopters overhead?  Stone is not exaggerating and therein
lies the strength of the film.</P>
<P>     Exceptional acting by Juliette Lewis and Robert Downey, Jr.
Harrelson is good, too, but Tommy Lee Jones got a little too hopped up
in his role.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Oliver Stone.</PRE>
