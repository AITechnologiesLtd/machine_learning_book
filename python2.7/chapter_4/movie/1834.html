                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Living together in one house are Beth (Lisa Harrow), her French
husband Jean-Pierre (Bruno Ganz), her younger sister Vicki (Kerry Fox),
her daughter Annie (Miranda Otto), and a boarder named Tim (Kiri
Paramore).  It's a strange family whose relationships with each other
are, to say the least, unusual.  All passion between Beth and
Jean-Pierre is dead, Vicki is depressed over an abortion she feels she
was pressured into, Annie and Tim are engaged is some
seemingly-innocent flirting, and Beth is obsessed about making peace
with her father (Bill Hunter) before he dies.</P>
<P>     Even character dramas/slice-of-life pictures should have a point.
Unfortunately, THE LAST DAYS OF CHEZ NOUS is sorely lacking in this
department.  What the viewer gets out of this film may not be worth the
investment of one hour and thirty-six minutes.  Certainly, there are
moments of power and emotion contained within, but the overall
production is not only lacking in focus, but doesn't seem to know where
it's going or when it's gotten there.</P>
<P>     There is a long, dreary sequence in the middle of the film where
Beth and her father go on a cross-country trek to mend their fractured
relationship.  While what happens on and because of this trip is
central to THE LAST DAYS OF CHEZ NOUS, the film drags during its
course.  The relationship between father and daughter is not
sufficiently developed for this journey of discovery to have more than
incidental meaning.  It is, frankly, uninteresting.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem is that the Beth, the central character of the
story, is too bland.  I managed to find some degree of empathy for
almost everyone in the film except her.  Lisa Harrow's acting isn't to
blame - Beth is exceptionally poorly-written.  The most powerful
moments of the movie are designed to revolve around her but, because
the character is so weakly presented, these scenes have little or no
impact.</P>
<P>     The bright spot of CHEZ NOUS is Kerry Fox.  The young Australian
actress is full of life and energy, and it comes through on screen,
often obscuring problems with her character's motivation.  Fox seems
equally capable of doing lighthearted moments and deeper drama, since
the role of Vicki requires both.  In scenes with both of the sisters,
Vicki's zest makes Beth look all-the-more lifeless.</P>
<P>     The ending, while a letdown, occurs at a good place to break the
story.  Like the rest of THE LAST DAYS OF CHEZ NOUS, there is something
fundamentally unsatisfying about it.  The film skims the surface of the
disintegration of a family, but rarely gets deep enough into the
characters and situations to create a forceful motion picture.  We
occasionally get glimpses of what CHEZ NOUS could have been had the
script been better realized, but there are not enough of those moments
to make this any better than a run-of-the-mill story of a dysfunctional
family.</P>
<PRE>                        Rating: 7.0 (B-, **1/2)</PRE>
