<PRE>                               THE LIMEY
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: But for a little bit of fancy
          editing, this could be a TV movie from the 1960s.
          Steven Soderbergh gives us fairly straightforward
          crime film packed nicely into about 90 minutes.  A
          woman who had been living with a Hollywood music
          executive has died mysteriously.  Her career
          criminal father comes from London looking for
          vengeance.  Nothing extraordinary, but short and
          entertaining.  Rating: (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
          +4)</PRE>
<P>     Steven Soderbergh is probably best-known for his SEX, LIES, AND
VIDEOTAPE of a just a decade ago.  That was an unconventional film.
His KING OF THE HILL was certainly a fine effort though of late he has
been doing more conventional work, albeit well.  OUT OF SIGHT, in spite
of some violence, was an amiable film.  With the exception of a little
strange editing, his latest could almost be a good 1960s TV movie.  It
is a plain, straightforward crime film whose only surprise is that
there are no real surprises.  It has a bad guy and an avenger who
implacably draws ever closer to his prey.  We watch fascinated like we
would a fly caught in a spider's web as the spider moves in for the
kill.</P>
<P>     Valentine (played by Peter Fonda) is a successful Hollywood music
producer with a nice-looking house and a string of better-looking young
women living with him.  One of the young women was Jenny Wilson
(Melissa George).  She got drunk one night and was killed in a car
accident never completely explained.  Jenny was a women who always had
self control and her father (Terrence Stamp), an English career
criminal, knows there is something very wrong with the official story
about the accident.  Just having been released from a 9-year sentence
in prison he finds his daughter is dead and he comes to the US to find
out the truth.  The Americans who stand in his way continually
underestimate Wilson and his determination to get revenge.  Wilson had
been alerted to the questionable circumstances of his daughter's death
by a letter from a man named Ed (Luis Guzman).  Now he recruits Ed to
help him track down some answers.  His entourage is completed by a
friend of his daughter Elaine (Lesley Ann Warren).  Wilson might almost
be some sort of alien killing machine, which indeed he is.</P>
<P>     Subtle humor is generated by Wilson's use of impenetrable English
rhyming slang that Ed cannot understand.  In one of the films two most
memorable scenes makes a long speech to a DEA official who listens
patiently without understanding a single word.  The other memorable
scene is Wilson's assault on some uncooperative characters involved in
Jenny's death.  Set in a warehouse the sequence establishes Wilson as
an implacable enemy.  Wilson is in this country so alien to him because
he has a job to do.  And he does it in a straightforward and
businesslike manner.  Adding to the 1960s feel of this film is the fact
that it has given us three 1960s stars, Stamp, Warren, and Fonda.
Stamp and Warren act very well together generating some chemistry in
spite of the very different backgrounds.</P>
<P>     Soderbergh tries a number of stylistic touches, most of which
work.  The primary exception is the intentionally confusing visual
editing.  The sound will be what one expects but visually he will be
rapidly cutting scenes showing the Wilson's memories, his thoughts, and
the present.  Occasionally the conversation seems to be going on
between the two characters at two different locations at once.
Probably the effect is to show the rapid flitting of Wilson's mind, but
it leaves the viewer bewildered.</P>
<P>     Another of the stylistic touches that is getting positive comment
is that footage for flashback sequences is taken from Ken Loach's 1967
film POOR COW which featured Stamp 32 years younger.  Certainly this is
more effective than trying to make up Stamp to look a lot younger or
casting another actor.  It is a clever touch, but it is not as new as
people seem to think.  1962's WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? used
clips of early 1930s films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as films
that the characters played by Davis and Crawford had made early in
their lives.</P>
<P>     This is a fairly violent film, but its use of gore is fairly
reserved, certainly by 1990s film standards.  This is an enjoyable
tribute to the 1960s crime film, more entertaining than one might
expect.  I rate it a 6 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +1 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
