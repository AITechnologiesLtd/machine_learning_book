<PRE>                            BOYS ON THE SIDE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule:  This is a road picture that runs out
          of gas toward the middle, then takes a turn toward
          familiar territory.  Three very different women
          have an interrupted journey together across country
          and learn to love each other as they bond.  The
          film often seems artificial, but it does have some
          good comic touches and some expected moments of
          warmth.  Rating: low 1 (-4 to +4) [Minor spoilers.]</PRE>
<P>     In SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, the characters talk about "chicks'
films."  There they mean romance, but there is something else that is
much more a chick's film.  There is a whole sub-genre of films like
RICH AND FAMOUS, BEACHES, STEEL MAGNOLIAS, and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.
They are bittersweet explorations of women bonding with each other
through good times and bad, often to the beautiful and lush strains of
a score by Georges Delerue.  [His title theme for RICH AND FAMOUS is
one of the most beautiful film themes I know.]  Delerue died in 1992,
sadly, but the kind of films he scored go on with the latest entry
being BOYS ON THE SIDE.</P>
<P>     Actually BOYS ON THE SIDE begins atypically for a women's picture
with two very different women sharing a cross-country ride.  Jane
(Whoopi Goldberg) is a crude club singer who makes racist comments and
tells cab drivers to go back to Pakistan.  Robin (Mary-Louise Parker)
appears to be a slightly ditzy real estate broker with a penchant for
banal Carpenters songs.  Along the way they pick up Holly (Drew
Barrymore), the girlfriend-victim of an extremely obnoxious drug-dealer
and junkie.  While there is an initial tension between Jane and Robin,
of course women of goodwill always learn to respect each other
eventually.</P>
<P>     Curiously, near the middle  the film seems to run out of steam and
its apparent whole reason to be.  Suddenly it is no longer a road film
and the plot, after a short section of aimlessness, goes off in another
direction.  In an almost artificial manner the major women, and even
some of the minor, get to show both positive and negative traits.  It
is better than painting them as saints, but it appears to be just a bit
too deliberate.  Overall, however, the film plays it safe, pushing the
right buttons and espousing the right causes.  Director Herbert Ross
knows his audience a little too well.</P>
<P>     Whoopi Goldberg is obviously winning as an actress, but her acting
range has always seemed to me to be very limited.  She has a more
restrained performance in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," and Steven
Spielberg definitely got her to act in THE COLOR PURPLE, but she and
most of her directors are content to let her play the same character
time after time.  In BOYS ON THE SIDE she is playing a woman with a
personality almost identical to the one in JUMPING JACK FLASH or SISTER
ACT.  This is a film in which she could have shown some real dramatic
range, if nothing else as an investment in her own career.  The
meatiest part in the film actually is Mary-Louise Parker's and while
her role is not as flamboyant as is Goldberg's--in fact it appears very
unpromising at the beginning of the film--she makes much better use of
opportunities the story affords her.  We see more different facets of
her personality and even of Barrymores's than of Goldberg's.</P>
<P>     After a promising start this film gives us little besides a few
nuances in Parker's character that we have not seen better elsewhere.
Rating: low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
