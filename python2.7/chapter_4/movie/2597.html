<PRE>Rating: Scale 1-10 (10 = highest) 9</PRE>
<P>     A starkly simple and engaging tale, of the escalation of violence
and ascension of dictatorship in 1960's Haiti seen through the eyes of
a young girl.  Soft pastel images and idyllic landscape are punctuated
by blood and violence, mostly done thankfully from a distance.</P>
<P>     The film's greatest accomplishment is showing the horror of
repression through mundane, everyday events (e.g., the wife of the local
military ruler deciding she can return a pair of well-worn shoes,
demanding a full refund) escalates to disastrous consequences.  The
film is sparse on dialogue and is very non-linear; some scenes and
sequences repeat.  The film is deliberately edited to reflect the
jumbled memories of childhood.</P>
<P>     Due to this, and the camera's occasional over-lingering embrace of
household objects, a heavy dose of patience is required in the second
and third reel.  But it's worth the wait.  The memories come together
with tremendous clarity in the final thirty-five minutes of the film.</P>
<P>     THE MAN BY THE SHORE is also refreshing in that there is only one
Euro/White face in the entire film.  For American audiences, it is an
exhilarating experience to see blacks honestly portrayed, completely
free of stereotypes.  I can't remember the last film I've seen with a
large black cast that didn't involve drugs or prostitution.  The dusky
skin tones are beautifully illumined in a variety of lighting
situations, the acting subtle and elegant.  Portraying repressed,
silenced characters, the actors have to make much out of little
dialogue.  There is a scene in church, where the local warload sits
serenely amidst a sea of faces, faces of the survivors of his victims.
The image conveys far more than words or music could.</P>
<P>     Well worth seeing.  Better on a big screen than it would be on
video.  Due to subtitles, don't expect this one on PBS.</P>
