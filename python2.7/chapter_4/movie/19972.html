<PRE>The Thomas Crown Affair
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is a caper movie - the kind of
light crime drama where sophisticated, clever thieves try to pull off
the perfect crime. As capers go, it's smart and well-oiled. The crime
story works wonderfully. The movie only fails when the plot wanders, and
unfortunately, at the end.</P>
<P>This remake of the 1968 movie stars Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown:
billionaire, hard-core businessman and art-lover. Rene Russo plays
Catherine, an insurance investigator hired to look into the theft of a
Monet painting from a New York art museum. Catherine quickly deduces
that Crown is the thief. Now she just needs some evidence.</P>
<P>Crown knows how to keep clean during the investigation, which draws it
out longer. Each time they meet, they fall deeper in love. The
protracted investigation becomes a coy game of power, sex, trust,
leverage and love.</P>
<P>Catherine collaborates with Michael (Denis Leary), the NYPD detective
assigned to the case. Michael's law-abiding infatuation throws
Catherine's options into clear contrast. She can choose a rich,
handsome, mature crook or a poor, plain, childish cop.</P>
<P>Catherine and Thomas do make love, and their scenes are pretty steamy.
Both leads are good-looking, mature adults. It was nice to see two
well-matched minds going at each other with their bodies. It draws
attention to how adolescent and male-centric movie sex tends to be.</P>
<P>But good looks and chemistry aside, neither Brosnan nor Russo gives an
outstanding performance. Brosnan manages to be different from 007 only
in subtle ways. Russo was better, but she played her part a little too
broadly.</P>
<P>For most of the movie, the remake improves on the original. The capers
are more elaborate and more smoothly portrayed. The temptations of
wealth are more real. Even the song WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND is integrated
better. The whole picture just seems to work better than the first
movie.</P>
<PRE>Until the end.</PRE>
<P>I won't give it away, but if you're not sure, skip the next paragraph.</P>
<P>The first movie ended in a certain way. It could have just as easily
ended one other way. The new version of the film finds a third way which
is a little too pat. It doesn't entirely compromise the characters'
integrity or the plot's believability, but it does stretch them both too
far.</P>
<P>But those problems aren't all that big and shouldn't detract from
enjoying the film. The interactions between the main characters are
well-thought-out and the intricate set-ups for the crimes, following the
tradition of all good caper movies, are fun to watch. </P>
