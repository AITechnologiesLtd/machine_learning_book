<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>     The character drama, I think I can safely say, is dead as far as studio
films are concerned.  Yes, in 1997, we had Gattaca, the interesting tale of
a futuristic society in which everyone is genetically engineered, but I
haven't seen anything since then.  If I racked my mind, I might be able to
come up with a few examples of studio films with good characters, but not
studio films that are good character dramas.  They're long gone.</P>
<P>     Whenever a genre dies in studio films, there is a period of time where
we experience throwbacks from that genre… films that are attempting to
salvage a dying movement in the celluloid medium.  With few exceptions,
these fail.  A prime example: The Mummy, which was an attempt to bring back
the adventure style film of the Indiana Jones trilogy.  Instinct is yet
another throwback.</P>
<P>     Instinct -- a movie that comes across as The Shawshank Redemption meets
One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest meets Gorillas in the Mist meets Silence of
the Lambs -- spends its time trying to be something it can't possibly be:
good.  Sure, it may be entertaining and, considering the attention span of
the average person, it may bring tears to your eyes, but as far as quality
goes, Instinct falters.</P>
<P>     Instinct follows the intersection of a psychotic killer (Dr. Ethan
Powell, played by Anthony Hopkins) playing a game of cat and mouse with a
student of psychology (Theo Caulder, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  Have we
not seen this before?  Let's change that around a little bit by adding that
Powell doesn't eat people… he beats them to death with a club and hangs out
with gorillas.  Again, we have seen this before.  To make it a little less
original, we'll throw in a bit about a brutal prison and a brutal insane
asylum.  Been there, done that.</P>
<P>     Instinct, a film that, as near as I can tell, is meant to pose a
question about the values of a materialistic society, poses another question
for us: have films reached the same level as matter: all engineered parts
built on basic units that we understand?</P>
<P> There is nothing new to Instinct and, although I have had four years of
this to tell me otherwise, I still hope deep down that originality should be
part of my rubric for grading a film.  So I am an idealist.  It duplicates
each one of the aforementioned movies practically shot by shot (i.e. Cuba
Gooding, Jr. with his arms outstretched, enjoying the rain and bringing up
memories of Tim Robbins' similar performance in The Shawshank Redemption).</P>
<P>     Before you start sinking in your seat, please remember that, although
the character drama is dead, Instinct did not kill it.  Instinct is a
character drama.  The characters are stock, the situations are hackneyed,
and the general impression you get is that the writer was half asleep when
he wrote it.  Still, Instinct remains moderately enjoyable.</P>
<P>     It is funny that I call it this because, this afternoon, I was having a
talk with a friend about the people who truly control your tear ducts at a
film: the cinematographers and the music composers.  With Danny Elfman, an
uneducated but highly skilled man behind the keyboard and Philippe
Rousselot, cinematographer of A River Runs Through it and Interview with the
Vampire behind the camera, you can understand how they play the audience
like a fiddle.</P>
<PRE>     They make it as good as it gets, which isn't very good at all.</PRE>
<P>     Sure, the actors doing a top-notch job with bottom-rung roles helps a
lot, but were it not for the clean cut score and the pretty images, I may
very well have angrily stormed out of the theatre… or tried to incite a riot
to rush the screen.  But I didn't.  It wasn't quite that bad.</P>
