<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The title is taken from the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson describing
the life of a traveler as 'Anywhere but here.' There isn't one thing
about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest. It
relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter
what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional
lives, as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves. If
the film looks familiar, that is because "The Slums of Beverly Hills
(98)" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and
perceptive due to Alan Arkin and Natasha Lyonne performances, in which
they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with. Alvin
Sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral. Wayne Wang's ("The
Joy Luck Club") inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his
inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating
what the action couldn't convey.</P>
<P>Pushy mother Adele August (Susan Sarandon) forces her 14-year-old
daughter Ann (Natalie Portman) to leave a small Midwestern burg to go
cross-country with her to Beverly Hills. The daughter resents her twice
divorced, unstable but exotic, schoolteacher mother, bullying her to be
an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum  life. The daqughter doesn't
even like the used gold Mercedes mother buys to drive to LaLa land in
and can't stand the Beach Boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car
radio. So it becomes a question of who knows best, as the ladies fight
it out between them, until the  predictable sweet ending comes in this
yawner.</P>
<P>Adele's dream of greener pastures in Beverly Hills soon doesn't look
that good, as she lands a job in a slum school, has her precious car
scratched by the unruly kids, and settles into a job she hates in order
to financially survive. Daughter pines for small town Wisconsin and her
friends there. During one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom,
they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed, she runs away,
only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop (Michael Milhoan), who
offers her wise counsel. With the cop's Zen wisdom passed onto the
daughter, she will survive living in many different addresses in Beverly
Hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by
using her good grades to go to Brown University instead of UCLA.</P>
<P>During their stay in Beverly Hills, she grows from feeling awkward in
Beverly Hills High to immediately having many high school girlfriends
and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a T.S. Eliot (Corbin Allred)
reader. But the transition of her life into Beverly Hills had no feel of
reality, as everything seemed staged and unemotional. When she learns
her cousin Benny (Shawn Hatosy), who happens to be her best friend dies
in a traffic accident back in Wisconsin, she returns for the funeral and
in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay
there, and for that matter, it was never made clear why the mother wants
to leave so badly. The film is one big battle of wills between mother
and daughter over their dreams. I guess what the filmmaker is trying to
say, is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one,
able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need
of parenting herself.</P>
<P>Mother has a series of setbacks, like being dumped by her dream-boat
dentist (Bochner) she met on the beach, and witnessing her daughter
mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part.
But mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and
that she has to stop living her life through her. She learns this when
the same wise cop who told Ann what to do, is about to ticket her and
this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do. This of
course results in the corny ending, showing that mom's heart was always
in the right place, only she went about it in the wrong way. This was
just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater
where this film is showing.</P>
