<P>   Atom Egoyan's lyrical approach to the troubles afflicting a
remote town in British Columbia has virtually all the attributes
an intelligent moviegoer looks for in a film.  By eschewing the
special effects that stamp a film as either Hollywood-kitsch or
pretentious nonsense, he afford exceptional import to a single
visual image which can devastate his audience.  "The Sweet
Hereafter" employs the superb acting talent of Ian Holm in the
role of a lawyer, whose amoral interference in a community's
severe tragedy underscores the grief of its citizenry.  Perhaps
the film's most striking merit is Egoyan's juxtaposition of
Robert Browning's poem, "The Pied Piper of Hamelin," with
the direction taken by anguish-stricken families in the
aftermath of a disaster.  And Egoyan cleverly likens the
attorney's personal heartache with the suffering of the people
he is to represent in a class-action lawsuit.</P>
<P>  Adapting a novel by Russell Banks which is a fragmented as
the film, Egoyan lends his personal touch to a moral tale,
exploring the ways in which the sudden death of fourteen
children in a school-bus accident changes the isolated village.
To their credit, neither novelist Banks nor filmmaker Egoyan
attempts to simplify matters by contrasting a happy, solid,
truly bonded and joyous population with a numbingly sad and
changed people.  Dark elements existed previous to the
tragedy, though the accident does provide a an opportunity
for its female lead--Sarah Polley in the role of a young woman
who is crippled by the mishap--to cleanse herself and to some
degree the entire surroundings.</P>
<P>   The incident which changes the face of the tiny rural area
of Sam Dent, British Columbia, is the skidding of a school bus
from an icy road and its subsequent sinking into the icy
waters of a frozen lake below, killing fourteen of its youthful
riders and maiming several others--including its guilt-ridden
driver, Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose).  The event itself is
portrayed almost as an anti-climax, occurring well into the
movie, a choice which emphasizes the director's major
intention.  As the film opens Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) is
stuck in a car-wash, frustrated not so much by the almost
farcical situation he is in as by a phone call he has received
from his daughter, Zoe (Caerthan Banks), a desperate young
woman who is a drug addict and repeatedly contacts her
father for money.  We soon gather that the anguished
Stephens has set himself upon the Sam Dent community not
primarily to enrich himself by the one-third cut he would
receive as his fee for prosecuting a successful civil suit.  He
uses the circumstance to elude his own psychic pain at the
"loss" of his daughter, plunging compulsively into his work to
forget his own misery.  His seriousness and apparent sincerity
win over the folks of the town who have suffered the loss of
their children, and most of the aggrieved sign on to the class-
action suit, trusting him in much the way the children of the
village of Hamelin followed the Pied Piper.  The one major
holdout, a widower (Bruce Greenwood)  who was accustomed
to following the school bus each morning in his own car,
threatens the lawyer with physical harm, insisting that the
people do not care about the money but desire simply to be
left alone in their grief.  By contrast, Sam (Tom McCamus),
the youthful father of crippled teenager Nicole (Sarah Polley),
arouses the suspicions of his daughter by being greedily
drawn to the lawyer's promise of big bucks beyond what the
school's insurance has already paid to the injured families.</P>
<P>   Egoyan highlights sordid relationships which, in the hands
of a hack, could have been the grist for the soap-opera mills. 
Billy Ansell (Greenwood) is carrying on an affair with the
unhappy Risa Walker (Alberta Watson), and even worse,
Sam, who relates to his daughter as would flower children to
one another during the Woodstock era, is regularly committing
incest with his not unwilling teenager.  </P>
<P>   Despite the unhappiness of so many in the community even
before the accident, "The Sweet Hereafter" shows graphically
and yet in an understated, lyric tone, the ways in which the
disaster has permanently changed the face of the backwater
burg.  Egoyan has filmed his work in a style whose
fragmentation adds much to its inflections, switching with
uncanny expertise from 1995 to 1997 and back, while
periodically crowding several incidents into a single scene as
when he focuses on a family argument involving Wendell
(Maury Chaykin) and his unhappy wife Risa while allowing us
to eavesdrop on a telephone conversation between the lawyer
and his woebegone daughter.</P>
<P>   Ian Holm centers the entire piece in his extraordinary
performance as a pained and prosperous professional who
has difficulty coming to grips with the loss of his own
daughter, Zoe, to drugs and who is ultimately to accept defeat
at the hands of a girl who is younger and wiser than the
narcissistic Zoe.  "The Sweet Hereafter" is bleak, but offers a
tragic air that pays heed to the ultimate dignity of an
aggrieved people.  Not Rated.  Running Time: 110 minutes.
