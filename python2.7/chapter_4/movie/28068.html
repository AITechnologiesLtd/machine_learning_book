<P>Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura might have a hell of a time being
released in theaters today.  His trilogy of films starring the beautiful
actress Monica Vitti (expanded into a quartet if you include Red Desert)
contemplate the experience of a bored, frustrated woman in a heavily
industrialized society ruled by false ideals of consumerism and power. 
The end of the world was not an apocalyptic fire, but a deadening
malaise waking up in the dawn of the dead.  There's no exit, whittling
away the days with the distraction of fast food and shopping malls.</P>
<P>In 1960, L'Avventura was a box office smash despite its harsh critical
reception at Cannes, where frustrated critics misunderstood its
open-ended message for pure emptiness.  What they lacked the ability to
see was that very emptiness becoming the core message.  This can also be
said for Zack Winestine's challenging new film, States of Control, which
picks up right where Antonioni left off.  The times have changed, and
this heroine, Lisa (brilliantly played by Jennifer van Dyck, Series 7)
is not content to live a life of passive alienatation.  She's gonna blow
her superficial life apart and create something authentic and new, no
matter what the cost.</P>
<P>Lisa has fallen into routines, measuring out her days in teaspoons.  A
self-proclaimed failed novelist, she's stuck in a sheltered Manhattan
life coordinating mundane secretarial chores at an Off-Off-Broadway
Theater.  Her husband Abel (Stephen Bogardus, Love! Valour! Compassion!)
is an impotent bore who fails to challenge her sexually or
intellectually.  This is most notably felt in a funny-sad scene when he
attempts to tell an amusing anecdote about the "Great Chinese
Trombonists."  The gag falls flat, not achieving the desired response. 
The more they try to hold on to each other, the closer they come to
drowning.</P>
<P>Things quickly liven up.  Inspired by the anarchic musings of a jaded
theatre director (John Cunningham), Lisa performs a series of
experiments, some comical and others disturbing, to break through the
web of artificiality.  Her training consists of sleep deprivation,
sexual deviance, sampling pornography, smashing open a locked door with
her bare fist, and determining how long she can hold her finger in an
open light socket.  By pushing her body to the limit, she hopes to
achieve the ultimate transformation, whatever that is.</P>
<P>The coda of States of Control places Lisa on her own as the extraneous
parts of her life fade away, including her principles, her friends, even
her language.  Played entirely without dialogue, the climax is a
razor-edged adventure as Lisa embarks upon the final, explosive stage of
her growth.  Comparisons to the Unabomber abound, but Lisa's philosophy
comes closer to David Cronenberg's unsettling Videodrome mantra, "Long
live the New Flesh."</P>
<P>There's something borderline fascistic about Lisa's regime, made latent
in the fiercely dramatic sturm und drang of Richard Termini's classical
score, or the beautiful and startling images of clouds parting in the
sky.  Those mystical images of nature bring to mind Triumph of the Will
director Leni Reifenstahl, visually referenced throughout States of
Control.  Susan Starr's austere cinematography (in collaboration with
Winestine, an experienced director of photography himself) produces an
appropriately clinical God's Eye View, in the hollow valleys of New York
City skyscrapers or the cramped apartment space Lisa shares with Abel. 
Discomfort is the order of the day.</P>
<P>Anchored by a strong central performance by van Dyck, States of Control
is a hard, mercurial polemic that gets under the skin.  Winestine's
politically charged agenda sometimes gets the best of him in scenes that
seem more conceptual than dramatic.  Despite the occasionally academic
tone, there's no denying that Lisa's extremities cast an eerie spell.</P>
<P>Zack Winestine's formidable States of Control will not be for everyone,
but those who rise to the challenge can prepare themselves for a movie
rich with ideas in today's increasingly conservative marketplace. 
There's also a bleak humor in the lengths to which Lisa goes to achieve
her vision -- I mean, who wouldn't laugh at the notion of blowing shit
up and spending the rest of your life living in a cave?  Yeah, it's all
funny games until the rationality kicks in: something just broke.</P>
