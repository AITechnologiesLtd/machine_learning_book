<P>   "The Green Mile" has come out at an opportune time when
the Supreme Court is again considering whether capital
punishment constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. 
Motivated by two botched executions in Florida, the court has
agreed once again to research whether the legal taking of life
squares with the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.  </P>
<P>   And what an argument the movie presents!  Without
polemically coming out for or against capital punishment,
Frank Darabont's script, based closely on Stephen King's
once-serialized set of six novellas, takes on universal
meaning while implicitly condemning the legal taking of live
by the state.  The world is populated with bad people. 
Always was and always will be.  But there are good guys out
there to to meliorate--if not cancel out--the evil.  This is the
overall communication of King's page-turner, a book
whose prose is hardly lyrical, whose story is less than
original, but which is nonetheless a compelling piece of
fiction.  Because this concept is graphically dramatized by
King, the book makes for a solid choice for a screen adaption
and, given the top-notch ensemble acting and effective--if
generally conventional--cinematography under Frank
Darabont's direction, the three hours slide by effortlessly as
the audience takes in the pathos and the humor of a
remarkable story.</P>
<P>   Given Stephen King's penchant for horror and the
supernatural, you'd expect the usual suspects of kiddieland
shivers: shaking rooms, characters turning vampiric, ghouls
emerging from nooks and crannies: but happily "The Green
Mile" treats the transcendental with a light touch, discreetly
displaying occult occurrences more as metaphor than
materiality. Framing the tale by opening and closing it in the
present day--which gives the picture the mood of Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List"--Darabont opens the drama on
the 108-year-old Paul Edgecomb (played at that stage by
Dabbs Greer) who chats with his best friend in a nursing
home about his experiences during the 1930s when he was
just 44 years old.   Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), the supervising
guard in the Louisiana death house, oversees a handful of
prisoners scheduled to die in the Cold Spring Penitentiary
electric chair.  We get the impression from the current crew
who are behind bars that some have been quiet and
repentant while others are off-the-wall guilt-free blackguards
with no compunctions about what they had done.  Edgecomb
runs the ward together with Brutus Howell (David Morse),
Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey
DeMunn) and Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), the last
being a well-connected sadist who never lets a moment pass
by without doing his worst to the prisoners.  Life changes
dramatically when a huge convict, John Coffey (Michael
Clarke Duncan) is brought in, found guilty of brutally raping
and murdering two young girls--found by a posse with the
victims still bloodied in his arms.  Illiterate, retarded, and
menacing, Coffey is nonetheless a man of a sweet disposition
that belies his alleged crime--a murder which even his lawyer
(Gary Sinise) believes he committed.  You become aware of
Stephen King's hand only when some wondrous events
occur, circumstances that convince the guards that this
enormous man is a miracle of God.  One involves the way
John Coffey helps Edgecomb with a particularly gruesome
problem--a urinary tract infection that forces him to urinate
"razor blades" and puts a damper on his marriage.  The
other, shown in a remarkably touching scene, is the
technique he uses to aid a little mouse who has become the
pet of one of the convicts, Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter),
a Cajun who is despised by guard Percy.</P>
<P>   Most of the considerable running time of the picture is
spent on the daily routines, the drama coming from the
contrast between two evil fellows and the decent people who
must deal with them.  One convict, known as Wild Bill
Wharton (Sam Rockwell) is so off-the-wall heinous that we
wonder how he was ever judged competent to stand trial. 
Similarly Percy Wetmore demonstrates that people on the
other side of the bars can be almost as abhorrent, and given
the power vested in them by the state are capable of inflicting
great damage.  By contrast, the other guards are men of
conscience who do their best to keep things quiet on the wing
by acting diplomatically with the doomed prisoners.</P>
<P>   The title of the story comes from the green linoleum that
lines the floor of the death chamber, a floor that each
condemned man must eventually walk down on the way to
"Old Sparky."  In what is conceivably authentic historically,
when a condemned man is executed, he is not walled off
from the dozen or so witnesses but "rides the lightning" just a
few feet away from the observers in the first row.  We can
only speculate as to the reason director Darabont--known for
his "Shawshank Redemption" several years back--chose
graphically to stage executions thrice, in one case graphically
displaying the result of a botched job in which the prisoner
was literally burned alive.  (Such an event actually occurred
not just once in Florida's electric chair, the last causing the
Supreme Court to reconsider the justice of the death penalty
once again.)</P>
<P>   Though many will predictably say that the film could be
tightened and cut to two hours, the decency of all but one of
the guards, the compelling performance by Michael Duncan
as a man able to perform astonishing feats, and the skillful
manner by which the men, good and evil are contrasted,
provide solid justification for its unusual length.  Terence
Marsh's production design is adept enough that the movie
avoids the closed-in feeling that could have given the indoor
scenes the appearance of a photographed play.  This picture
is, like the cigarette of the old-time commercials, worth
walking a mile for.</P>
