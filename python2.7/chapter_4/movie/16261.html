<P>'At First Sight' is written by Steve Levitt, Irwin Winkler and Rob Cowan
and is based on the story 'To See and Not See' by Oliver Sacks.  Irwin
Winkler also lends his talents as director to the film.  You may
remember another Oliver Sacks story turned into a movie in 1990 entitled
'Awakenings'.  That film chronicled the experimental tests that led to
the temporary success of a doctor treating patients for a deadly form of
sleeping sickness.  Robin Williams was the doctor and Robert De Niro the
patient.  Two powerhouse actors that brought their consummate
craftsmanship to a very human subject.  The extremely subtle and
wonderfully crafted story of 'At First Sight' is no classic but takes
the idea of human sight, and how we all (whether we want to admit it or
not) take it for granted and how painful it would be to adjust to a
world of darkness.  Just turn the tables and try to imagine the story of
a blind man, sightless since the age of three because of severe
cataracts, and how painful it is to adjust to a world of sight where
you're used to years of adapting to the dark and not understanding the
three dimensional concept of perfect vision.</P>
<P>You wouldn't think that someone would feel more comfortable being blind
after being given the opportunity to see but truth is stranger than
fiction and that's exactly what happens in this film which is one of
1999's most pleasant early surprises.  The story has some of the names
changed and this is a mystery to me because the characters are so
inspirational that they should be proud to have their names displayed as
the real ones in this movie.  Val Kilmer portrays Virgil Adamson, the
individual in question who, until the age of 8, had his eyes worked on
by the medical community almost to the point of torture and his sister
(Kelly McGillis) is reluctant to have him go through the procedure again
as a fully grown adult.  He meets the love of his life, Amy Benic (Mira
Sorvino) who is more open to the idea of him seeing than he is.  Her
heart is in the right place but she realizes later that Virgil has his
own decision to make.  After meeting the leading eye doctor on the east
coast of the U.S. (Bruce Davison), Virgil agrees to the procedure and
the medical institute, using his case for their own experimental ends,
agree to pick up the tab.</P>
<P>The highlight of the film comes after the operation and while sitting in
his wheelchair surrounded by his love ones, the bandages are taken off
Virgil's eyes and he slowly begins to adjust to a world of sight.  Val
Kilmer is stunning in this film.  It's obvious that Kilmer has always
struggled to be an intense method actor.  He virtually threw himself
into radical research for the role of Jim Morrison for 1991's 'The
Doors' and was terrific in it.  He has had his misses like everyone
else, but he brings a sublime and memorable portrayal of a blind
individual to the screen with a likable persona but his character never
goes awry to making this a disease of the week movie with weepy
sentimentality.  Mira Sorvino's performance as the lady in his life is
wonderful.  She's every guy's dream girlfriend.  Considerate, tolerant,
patient and most of all understanding.  Their chemistry is convincing
and totally memorable.  Rather underwritten and not used properly in the
film is a therapist (Nathan Lane) who helps Virgil adapt to his new
world.  For his small part in this film, Lane is quite good at drama.</P>
<P>This film's strongest asset is its attention to detail.  It focuses on
the little parts of Virgil Adamson's therapy after receiving surgery to
correct his eyesight.  And while he never fully adjusts to a world of
sight, his brief journey into that world is one that should be cherished
by everyone who's ever thought seriously about any handicap -- whether
it's physical or mental.</P>
