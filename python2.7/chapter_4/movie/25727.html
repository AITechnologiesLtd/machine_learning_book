<PRE>THE CELL
--------</PRE>
<P>A serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, "Men in Black") who likes to watch 
his victims drown in his special chamber falls into a coma while his 
latest capture still awaits her fate.  Psychotherapist Catherine Deane 
(Jennifer Lopez, "Out of Sight") attempts to enter his twisted mind in a 
race against time to discover the location of "The Cell."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"The Cell" is the feature directing debut of noted visualist Tarsem Singh,
whose commercials and videos are held in the permanent collection of the
Museum of Modern Art.  Is "The Cell" art?  It's magnificent to look at,
but at the half way mark the visuals get so far out they cease to serve
the sketchy story.  </P>
<P>Mark Protosevich's script is standard stuff which takes one concept
already explored in "Manhunter" (the original Hannibal Lecter movie) a
bit further - instead of a serial killer hunter thinking like his prey,
here people can hook themselves up to a Neurological Cartography and
Synaptic Transfer System, which, along with psychotropic drugs, allow
them to truly enter the mind of another (or allow another into their mind).
Otherwise, the story is simply plotted like "The Bone Collector," where
several people try to put together clues in order to save a victim within
a designated time period.</P>
<P>We're introduced to the device (where people hang suspended in musculature 
suits looking like the patients in "Coma"), as Catherine attempts to
interact with Edward, the seven year old son of a billionaire (Patrick Bauchau, 
"Twin Falls Idaho") who's threatening her boss, Dr. Miriam Kent (Marianne 
Jean-Baptiste, "Secrets and Lies"), with pulling funding if he doesn't get
tangible results soon.  Unbeknownst to us, we're already in Edward's
mind as the title credits roll - a land of red sand dunes against a 
brilliant blue sky where Catherine, in a white feathered gown, rides to
him on a black horse.  The African location cinematography by longtime
Tarsem collaborater Paul Laufer is stunning.</P>
<P>Then we meet Carl Stargher as he drives his black pickup out
to two lone silos in the middle of a wheat field.  Beneath the ground is
his cell, a small glass chamber (not unlike Lecter's cell in "The Silence of
the Lambs") where a woman floats, dead.  Carl takes the body home where
he 'processes' it before enacting his ritual, which involves suspending
his body from the ceiling by the steel rings pierced through his back (shades
of "Hellraiser").</P>
<P>FBI agents Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn, "Psycho") and Gordon Ramsey
(Jake Weber, "U-571") track down Stargher via clues left with his last
victim (albino dog hairs and vehicle identification) and raid his home,
only to find the schizophrenic killer has lapsed into a coma on his
kitchen floor.  A medical specialist hooks them up with the dream team at the
Campbell Center and Catherine agrees to attempt to make contact.</P>
<P>"The Cell" is creepily suspenseful right through Catherine's first mind
trip, where she makes contact with a young Carl (Jake Thomas) in subterranean
murk with Lynch-like horror tableaus of vibrating dogs, bloody bathtubs,
garishly posed bleached victims and a horse which gets cross-sectioned
before her eyes.  A second trip also features some creeps, but the script's
weak stab at serial killer profiling begins to strain (Carl was an abused
child, but what's up with his white fixation?).  When Vince Vaughn
joins the fun to 'save' a non-responding Catherine, logic is thrown to the
wind and things begin to get ludicrous - just why would a serial killer's
mind be full of Oriental art, harem imagery and sea creatures (the water
imagery from his past involves a river, not the ocean).  Things go further
downhill when Novak takes off from Stargher's mind on a sudden hunch and 
Catherine rashly goes back to save Carl's inner child.</P>
<P>Technically, "The Cell" is of the highest order.  Production design by
Tom Foden ("Psycho"), art direction by Guy Dyas and Michael Manson, costume
design by Eiko Ishioka and makeup by Heather Plott and James Ryder show
collaberation of imaginative artisans.  Original music by Howard Shore
("The Game") features discordant horns with an Arabic tinge.</P>
<P>If "The Cell" was stripped of all pretensions of storytelling it could
play as an intriguing experimental art film (the sectioned horse was ripped
off from artist Damien Hurst's cow, after all).  It hasn't, though, 
and the mind-bending visuals only take us so far.  It would be interesting
to see Tarsem collaborate with Lynch, a man with a little method behind
his madness.</P>
<PRE>C</PRE>
<PRE>ROBIN:</PRE>
<P>Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) is a talented child psychotherapist who is a
member of a research team that has developed an experimental technique for
entering the inner depths of the mind of a patient. A psycho killer is captured
by the FBI, but only after the madman kidnapped a new victim and has her
stashed away. The killer falls into a coma and FBI agent Pete Novak (Vince 
Vaughn) seeks Catherine's help to delve into the killer's mind to save the 
girl before time runs out in "The Cell."</P>
<P>Award winning music video director Tarsem Singh makes his feature film debut
with a psychological, science fiction drama that, quite literally, digs into
the human mind. Working with a script from another newcomer, Mark Protosevich, 
the director utilizes high-powered visuals, special F/X and flashy set design 
and costume to propel us into the psyche of a serial killer. The killer, Carl
Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) has the modus operandi of sealing his victims in a
glassed-in room, slowly flooding it while videotaping the poor woman's panic,
suffering and, finally, death.</P>
<P>The FBI, under the leadership of Novak, has been dogging the trail of Carl for
some time, collecting data and, slowly, closing in on the killer. Carl made a
boo-boo at his last killing and left some dog hairs, from his albino German
Shepherd Valentine, at the scene where the body was found. Accurate forensics
and quick legwork allows Pete and his team to get the drop on Stargher and
arrest him - but not before he drops into a coma. They learn of yet another
kidnapping and, knowing Carl's MO, realize that the latest victim has less than
40 hours to live with no way to find out where Carl's lair is located.</P>
<P>Enter Catherine and here research team who have developed a "neurological
synaptic transfer system" that allows a therapist to get into a patient's head
and, in theory, help cure that patient of whatever mental demons are tormenting
them. With so little time left to save Carl's latest victim, Catherine decides
to forego protocol and try the transfer system to get into Carl's mind and find
out where the girl, Julia Hickson (Tara Subkoff), is hidden. The
psychotherapist, necessarily, casts caution to the wind and enters the mind of
the murderer and is able to begin to bring out the troubled boy inside Carl's
head, but not the location of Julia.</P>
<P>Pete Novak, who has studied the killer and his methods from the very first
murder, thinks he can get the required info and both he and Catherine enter
Carl's sick mind. Revelations take place and Pete, with his newfound insight,
knows he can save the day. Catherine, the penultimate psychotherapist, throws
personal safety aside in order to save the scared, troubled little boy in the
near demonic Carl's megalomaniac mind.</P>
<P>Performances, as we see time and again with F/X extravaganzas, take a back seat
to the visual effects and the eye candy that the technicians on the film have
crafted so nicely. Jennifer Lopez is OK in her acting as the dedicated
Catherine, but stands out more when impressively costumed and coifed in her
journey into the killer's head. She's more object than character as things play
out and the actress's striking looks and physique help center the visual tone
of the elaborate production.</P>
<P>Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio are interchangeable actors who could have
been selected for their respective roles by a draw of straws. As such, neither
gives much character to their roles as the dedicated cop and the sick psycho
loony. Supporting cast is uniformly wasted. Dylan Baker ("Happiness") and
Marianne Jean-Baptiste ("Secrets & Lies"), as research scientists Henry West
and Dr. Miriam Kent, are left the task of pushing buttons and watching the 
inert, futuristically clad bodies of their patients (the action is in the mind)
without much involvement. At one point, it looked like the story was going to 
take a twist and Jean-Baptiste was going to get an expanded role. She didn't 
and the writer went for the routine hero-heroine story. Jake Webber ("U-571") 
playing Pete's partner, FBI agent Gordon Ramsey, doesn't fare much better as 
his character is left in the wake of Novak's single-handed bravery.</P>
<P>Of course, if you've seen the trailer, you can readily see that the special F/X
and surreal quality of the film are the draw to get you to see it. Despite the
flaws and inconsistencies in the story and the lack of depth to the principle
characters, the visual acuity of "The Cell" is enough to recommend it. It is
reminiscent of "Coma" and is the first film to delve so deeply into the human
mind since Ken Russell's 1980 film, "Altered States." The film is stunning to
look at and tech credits are superior. Photography, by Paul Laufer ("Frankie
Starlight"), is slick, sometimes beautiful, and is a major credit to the movie.
Production design, by Tom Foden (Gus Van Sant's "Psycho"), costuming, at
different times by April Napier ("Your Friends and Neighbors") and Eiko Ishioka
(Academy Award for "Bram Stoker's Dracula"), and make-up, by two-time Academy
Award winner Michele Burke ("Quest for Fire," "Bram Stoker's Dracula"), all
work to make this a superior looking flick. The F/X team, led by Clay Pinney
("Independence Day") and Kevin Tod Haug ("The Game"), are excellent.</P>
<P>One point the script makes in the midst of all the psycho babble that permeates
the film is that the FBI solves crimes and saves people by their understanding
of forensics and their doggedness in following clues, even insignificant ones,
to get their man. The story does not downplay the hard work of America's
crime-fighters in doing their difficult jobs.</P>
<P>There is more to a movie than just F/X and flash and good looks. A carefully
constructed story and three-dimensional characters are needed, too, to make a
film great. "The Cell" makes it part way and I give it a B-.</P>
