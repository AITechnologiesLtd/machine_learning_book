<P>It took 'em three sequels, but they finally accomplished it: A $100
million Batman movie that's as cheesy as the old TV series. Audiences
have supposedly been begging for a lighter tone in these movies (though
you wouldn't guess it from the grosses). But when Batman and Robin shows
the duo skiing through the skies on makeshift surfboards, and you
actually hear the line "Today Gotham, tomorrow the world!", Adam West
starts to look downright Shakespearean.</P>
<P>Since a plot summary of a Batman movie would be superfluous at this
point, let's cover the main topics.</P>
<P>* Villains - The movie is 50-50 on this point. Arnold Schwarzenegger is
near-perfection as Mr. Freeze, but the movie's chief liability is Uma
Thurman as Poison Ivy. When Thurman swings her teeny hips and tries for
Mae West double-entendres, she recalls some of Ginger's lesser
seductions of Gilligan. (Scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman must be a big
"Gilligan's Island" fan, because darned if the antidote to Ivy's lethal
kiss isn't lifted directly from a "Gilligan" episode. I'm embarrassed to
admit I know that, but it's true.)</P>
<P>* Central Miscasting - With her baby-fat cheeks and monotone delivery,
Alicia Silverstone is a zero as Batgirl. She has the same problem as Meg
Ryan in Addicted to Love: Ms. All-American trying to come off like
Madonna. And why is supermodel Elle Macpherson, who ably proved her
acting chops in Sirens, reduced to practically a walk-on as Batman's
latest love interest? I'd have believed her as Poison Ivy in a
heartbeat.</P>
<P>* The New Batman - Many have compalined about how enigmatic Batman has
been in these movies, but I thought was part of his point (and his
appeal). George Clooney's effort to "humanize" Batman consists mainly of
smiling a lot.</P>
<P>* The Unsung Hero of the Batman Movies - Once again, Michael Gough as
butler Alfred acts everyone else off the screen just by underplaying.
Director Joel Schumacher seems to have forgotten that the human element
needs to be found amidst the special-effects chaos. Forget Batgirl--I'm
ready for Alfred to join the Batcrew!</P>
<P>Batman and Robin is rated PG-13 for intense situations and violence.</P>
