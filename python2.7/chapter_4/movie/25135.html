<P>The Entertainment Weekly magazine movie critic who reviewed this film called
THE ROCK ("big and half dumb"), CON AIR ("huge and moronic"), and ARMAGEDDON
("colossal and brain-dead"). Now those three films combined to gross a
little less than half a billion dollars domestically, so my guess is that
there were actually a few people out there who did appreciate the films on a
certain level. This has always been my main complaint about so-called real
"movie critics". Why review films which obviously don't appeal to your
sensibilities? Get another critic who appreciates certain aspects of that
genre to check it out instead. Phew! Okay...rant over. And oh yeah, the
critic in question gave this film a "D". Duh! Didn't see that one comin'.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A retired car thief is blackmailed back into stealing cool cars when his
little brother's life is threatened by a mean, ol' car thief ring operator.
The older brother basically has 24 hours to steal 50 specific high-priced
automobiles or his little brother bites the dust. Simple enough?</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A below-par Bruckheimer film which does satisfy with a couple of cool chase
scenes, a semi-interesting tale and car-stealing scenarios, but ultimately
doesn't blow you away with anything. I enjoyed this film because it looked
cool, the people in it were acting cool and all of the cars in it screamed
cool, but I can't honestly say that it was a good movie. I was never bored
during the film, but other than the last 30 minutes or so, I kept wondering
where all the action was. Just like every other Bruckheimer machismo guy
flick, there is always the prerequisite situation (I like to call it the
"A-Team scene") featuring the rounding up of a certain motley crew of
gruffy, down-and-out and badass MoFos, and the mobilization of the master
plan. Generally, this part only lasts a few minutes and we move on to a
whole lot of wham-bang-and-thank-you-ma'ams, but this film decided to spend
a lot more time on the set-up. Perhaps it was supposed to develop the
characters somehow, but despite the story being absorbing to a certain
extent, I did keep wondering when all the action was gonna take place,
especially when the holes started showing up in the plot.</P>
<P>And when they finally did begin stealing the cars, I was doubly surprised at
how little resistance (read action/fun blow 'em ups) there was as well. I
don't know, maybe I just expected too much popcorn for my buck, but despite
the film coming through as a whole, it did disappoint as an all-out nacho
flick. Cage was Cage once more, the staple hip, tough guy with a heart,
while the rest of the crew was a well-rounded bunch this time around. Lindo
was cool, Duvall is always fun to watch, Vinnie Jones is just waiting to be
discovered as the next action-hero superstar and Ribisi, well, I'll admit
that he's finally starting to get on my nerves with his down-and-out
character portrayals. I was also a little disappointed with the one-liners
in this film, which seemed a little weak this time around. But overall, the
film is a slick one to watch, offering a couple of rockin' action scenes,
some fun characters, and despite its plot holes (the cops know about their
entire plan the whole time, but they decide to send two incompetents after
them?), a somewhat interesting tale. And oh yeah...Angelina Jolie is barely
in it!</P>
<P>At this point, I think everyone knows what a "Bruckheimer movie" is, so
please don't go into this movie expecting anything more than that. With that
in mind, you might just enjoy yourself.</P>
