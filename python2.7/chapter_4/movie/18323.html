<PRE>VARSITY BLUES
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>The high pressure world of high school football is the subject of
Varsity Blues, a comedy with the ambition to be a drama, but without the
necessary substance.</P>
<P>The story takes place in the small town of West Canaan, Texas, where
high school football is the local religion.  No one in town is more
revered than Coach Kilmer (Jon Voight), who has brought home 22 Division
Championships, and 2 State Championships.  This season, he'll stop at
nothing to get his hands on yet another one.</P>
<P>His star this year is Quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker), who just
might collect that championship title singlehandedly. In Lance's shadow
is the academic-minded second-string QB, Jonathan "Mox" Moxon (James Van
Der Beek).  Though equally as talented as Lance, Mox is perfectly
willing to let his friend take all the glory (after all, he's dating
Lance's sister (Amy Smart)).</P>
<P>Mox loves the game, but senses that something just isn't right.  The
parents of the players are more interested in the games than their
children's lives.  Players are encouraged (and even expected) to play
hurt. Even the dangerous exploits of players are laughed off by the
townsfolk and local authorities.  Mox realizes that everyone's
priorities are out of whack, but he's willing to simply coast along and
enjoy the ride.</P>
<P>The tone of Varsity Blues is severely disjointed.  There are several
moments throughout the film that feel realistic, as if we are being
treated to an expose of the dark side of high school athletics.  These
scenes are clumsily mixed with the wildly implausible antics of the
players and townsfolk of West Canaan.</P>
<P>Simultaneously condemning yet celebrating the culture of high school
football, Varsity Blues tries to have it both ways.  In the end, any
statement the film may have been trying to make is lost in its overall
phoniness of the movie.  It is also difficult to merely enjoy the movie
as a comedy, since the film's constant references to the dramatic
elements is like a thorn in the side.</P>
<P>Jon Voight delivers yet another hammy over-the-top villain in the rabid
Coach Kilmer.  He might have been a more interesting antagonist if he
wasn't so one-dimensional.  James Van Der Beek is sympathetic as the kid
who's not only physically talented, but smart and wise to boot. Most of
the other characters (such as Ron Lester's Billy Bob, or Scott Caan's
Tweeder) are played purely for laughs.</P>
<P>Still, though it is flawed, Varsity Blues makes a strong case that a
very good movie could be made about high school football.  Varsity Blues
is just not that movie.</P>
