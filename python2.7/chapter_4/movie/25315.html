                              SCARY MOVIE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     A cynic would say any filmmaker is looking for trouble by trying to
make a spoof out of another spoof.</P>
<P>     Scary Movie is just that spoof, a Wayans brothers special that's a
flat-out parody of Scream -- both of which ironically were produced by
Dimension Films.  Studio spoofs itself -- now that's comedy!</P>
<P>     Oddly, I have very little to say about this picture at all. 
There's not much point to discussing the plot of Scary Movie (mercifully
renamed from Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween).  If you've
seen Scream (and Scream 2), I Know What You Did Last Summer (and its
sequel), The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, and, delving into
more curious spoof choices like The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, and the
Budweiser "Whassup" commercials -- then you'll "get" Scary Movie.</P>
<P>     Not that there's much to it to "get."  As usual with this genre,
there's no story; the Wayanses simply pummel the audience with gag after
gag.  My humor-o-meter pegs the success rate of these jokes at about one
in three, including (at best count) three fart jokes, two penis jokes,
one testicle joke, and at least three jokes about Scary Movie not being
real, but, you know, actually being a movie instead.  And that's not to
mention countless gay jokes, sex jokes, and gay sex jokes.  Yeah, one in
three is about right.</P>
<P>     Ironically, Scary Movie spoofs the teen horror genre but is so
raunchy it's shocking it isn't rated NC-17.  I guess the old
phallus-through-the-head gag is a-ok these days.</P>
<P>     While this is the best film Keenan Ivory Wayans has been involved
with since his first film, 1987's Hollywood Shuffle, that isn't saying
much (did you see The Glimmer Man?).  Still, if you're looking for a
little gross-out raunchiness and you've already seen Me, Myself & Irene,
Scary Movie may be the perfect late-night fix.  Just consider yourself
warned.</P>
