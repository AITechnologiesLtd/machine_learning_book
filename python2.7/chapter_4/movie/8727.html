<PRE>            AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1997 Timothy Voon
               2 :-) :-) for the absurd and the ridiculous</PRE>
<P>Cast: Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner.
Screenplay: Mike Myers. Producers: Suzanne Todd, Demi Moore, Jennifer
Todd, Mike Myers. Director: Jay Roach.</P>
<PRE>Shag, baby, shag.</PRE>
<P>In the 1960's Austin Powers (Mike Myers) International man of mystery is
as groovy as gravy, baby. Accompanied by Mrs Kensington (Mimi Rogers
ex-Cruise babe), one intense Bimbette who drapes leather well and knows
a judo chop or two (reminiscent of Ms Emma Peel of ‘The Avengers'). This
Shagadellic pair chase the evil villain Dr Evil (Myers again), who has
done 6 years of medical school and is a personification of all Bond
baddies. Before Powers and Kensington can bag the evil Dr, he escapes
into the future with his furry feline in a cryogenic time capsule of a
‘Big Boy'.</P>
<PRE>Shake, baby, shake.</PRE>
<P>In the 1990's Dr Evil re-emerges from his ‘Big Boy' and so does ‘Danger
is my middle name' Powers, whose personal effects include the handy
penis enlarger (an exotic weapon). Mrs Kensington now retired, is
succeeded by daughter Miss Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), who like her
mother knows a judo chop or two. They now battle Evil's new evils - the
pyschedellic Fembotic babes with bullet, booby-trapped breasts (out of
Dr Strangelove's books); Miss Alotta Fagina (who gives Pussy Galore a
run for her money), Number 2 (Robert ‘business man' Wagner), and Evil's
very own IVF test tube son, with whom he shares a ‘love me, hate you'
relationship.</P>
<PRE> Swing, baby, swing.</PRE>
<P>So swing, shake and shag the years away - from sixties to nineties in
this absurd facade of the ridiculous. Myers is our for simple laughs and
sight gags. Of note is the ‘fruit-covering-bodily-sexual-organ' scenes
which is quite cleverly done. So if you don't mind putting your brain in
your back pocket for let's say 87 minutes, you will probably enjoy this
brainless excursion into the mysterious world of Austin Powers, and his
international group of clowns.</P>
<PRE>Yeah, baby, yeah.</PRE>
