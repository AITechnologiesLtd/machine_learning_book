<P>     Somewhere, sometime, someone is going to present an intelligent, 
suspenseful look into the role of the ninja in modern day Japan.  
However, if THE HUNTED is an indication, the filmmaker to do it won't be 
J. F. Lawton.  This gratuitously gory tale of clashing ninja warlords is 
so poorly written that it makes another Lawton script, PRETTY WOMAN, seem 
like GREAT EXPECTATIONS in comparison.</P>
<P>     I won't claim there's nothing worthwhile about THE HUNTED.  This 
isn't one of those "so-bad-you-want-to-hide-your-face-as-you-emerge" 
motion pictures.  Here and there, it's possible to distinguish a few good 
points.  Unfortunately, it takes a less discriminating eye to pick out 
flaws.  Not only are they more obvious, but they're in greater abundance.  </P>
<P>     First of all, you'd have to be almost brain-dead to miss the huge 
gaps in plot logic.  When the nasty, totally ruthless, never-before-been-
beaten Kinjo (John Lone) shows up to kill call girl Karina (Joan Chen), 
he pointedly instructs her that she's the only one ever to see his face.  
Then, who should walk in on the tableau but Paul Racine (Christopher 
Lambert), Karina's latest lover, who just happens to have left his keys 
behind in her rooms.  The first thing he witnesses is Karina getting 
decapitated.  Then he becomes the second person in one night to see 
Kinjo's face.  Funny thing, though, is that he survives.  Sure, he gets 
cut up a little, but none of the ninjas bother to finish him off.  </P>
<P>     Racine, a U.S. businessman on a trip to Japan, is played by the 
distinctly un-American sounding Christopher Lambert, who displays the 
same lack of ability in this role that he brought to Tarzan and the 
Highlander.  After hooking up with another top-flight ninja master 
(Yoshio Harada), Racine gets to observe a couple of brutal massacres 
before finally getting to the inevitable duel-to-the-death with Kinjo.  
This grand finale is so absurd that it's laughable.  Among other things, 
it asks the age-old question of how many times you can stick a man with a 
sword, collapse a building on top of him, and smash his head in with a 
stone before he finally stops trying to kill you.</P>
<P>     Once, Joan Chen was a respected actress.  However, after taking one 
too many "meal ticket"-type roles, her career got derailed, and now she 
seems relegated to thankless roles like the one here.  John Lone, another 
slumming actor who has seen better roles, brings some gusto to his 
portrayal of Kinjo.  He's not a great villain, but he's the best example 
of acting THE HUNTED offers.</P>
<P>     As a travelogue of Japan, this film isn't half-bad.  It depicts a 
variety of city and rural scenery, and is nicely photographed (including 
an artsy black-and-white dream sequence).  The lively score (by Motofumi 
Yamaguchi) heightens the picture's visual merits.  Curiously, however, 
considering the action-oriented audience the movie is aimed at, THE 
HUNTED comes complete with a heavy does of subtitles.  For the most part, 
the Japanese characters in this film actually speak Japanese.</P>
<P>     There are many degrees of "bad" movies, from the unwatchable to the 
almost-enjoyable.  Dubious though its entertainment value may be, THE 
HUNTED nevertheless belongs in the latter category.  It's far too 
energetic to be boring, and the endless bloodbaths and swordfights 
maintain a certain level of audience involvement.  In many ways, it's 
like a finely-polished, glossy bauble--pleasant to look at, but only in 
a superficial way, because scratching the surface reveals the tarnish 
underneath.</P>
