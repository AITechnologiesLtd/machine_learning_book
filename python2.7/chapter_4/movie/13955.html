<PRE>Parent Trap</PRE>
<PRE>A review</PRE>
<PRE>by Jeremiah Rickert</PRE>
<P>Starring: Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Lindsay Lohan
Directed by: Nancy Meyers</P>
<P>     Disney's remake department must be working overtime, trying to
ressurect their "wonderful" "hits" of the past.  We've seen remakes of
such "classics" as "The Shaggy Dog," "The Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes"
"The Absent Minded Professor," and now "The Parent Trap."  Most of these
have been rather horrid attempts at injecting the 90s into concepts that
were borne of the 60s.  However, "The Parent Trap" outclasses all of these
others in several respects.</P>
<P>     Our story, as in the original, concerns a set of identical twins
living with single parents. Annie James and Hallie Parker are the twins
(played convincingly by newcomer Lindsay Lohan) who meet at summer camp.
They discover that their parents (Dennis Quaid and Tony award winner
Natasha Richardson) separated soon after they were born, each taking one
of the twins with them.  The girls were then raised without knowledge of
each other.  However, they both end up attending the same Summer Camp one
year and after at first becoming rivals at the camp, they then realize
they are twins with the same parents.  They concoct a plan to switch
places with each other, so they can meet the parent they never knew, and
then force their parents to meet again when they're unswitched.  After
switching and enjoying time with their "new" parent, it is discovered that
their father plans to remarry to a 20-something gold-digger who is only
after his money (played with slime by Elaine Hendrix).  The race is on to
get everyone in once place again and convince their father that it's their
mother he should marry.</P>
<P>     The parents are Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) and Elizabeth James
(played by Tony winner Natasha Richardson).  Parker runs a winery, and
is an outdoorsey type, while James is a London Wedding Dress designer,
with a growing reputation.  Each of them seems to have done well without
the other.  </P>
<P>     There is some fantastic comic relief provided by each parents' hired
help.  Lisa Ann Walter (Eddie) plays Chessy, the crass, down-to-earth
housekeepr for Nick, and Simon Kunz (Goldeneye, 4 Weddings and a Funeral)
plays Martin, Elizabeth's bulter.  Each of them cares for the girls almost
as much as their parents and each gives a hand in straightening things
out.  </P>
<P>     The film kept me interested throughout its entirety, something that a
lot of recent big-budget films have failed to do.  The jokes range from
the very obvious to the very subtle.  In other words, there's stuff for
the young kids to laugh at, as well as the adults in the audience.  The
acting is all more than adequate, except for perhaps Quaid.  Having seen
the original, I always saw Nick Parker as a little rougher than Quaid's
portrayal.  The late Brian Keith, in the original version, was a man who
had some money, but didn't know what to do with it, was befuddled when it
came to things like dressing up and acting refined in front of a woman,
Quaid was a little too adjusted to these things, which doesn't ruin the
movie, but it takes away an element that could have made it better.  They
don't really explore the conflict between the two worlds that the new
parents live in.  Farm life is a far cry from a London design house.</P>
<P>     Meyers direction does the job just fine, she also had a hand in the
screenplay.  I have to give her a bravo for the long fencing duel fought
by the two twins.  Besides being rather hilarious, it had a lot of homages
to the classic duels of the past, with lots of posing, strutting, and
general braggadacio.</P>
<P>     Overall I was entertained by this "little" film.  It's by far the
best of the recent Disney remakes, and was more entertaining than most of
the summer blockbusters.  </P>
<P>Of the $6.75 that I paid for my ticket, it was worth every penny.</P>
