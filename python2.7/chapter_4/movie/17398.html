<P>DARK CITY (director: Alex Proyas; cast: Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland,
Jennifer Connelly, Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson, William Hurt  1998)</P>
<P>DARK CITY is a sci - fi/noir thriller, that portends to deliver a
message relating to the powers of the mind and the meaning of identity.
Everything attempted here has been done before, but that still doesn't
take away from the film's feeling of looking like it is an original.
Credit must go to the creative use of special effects and the
outstanding set designs used for its bedimmed city.</P>
<P>The film opens with the protagonist (Sewell) waking up in a tub in a
hotel room with a murdered prostitute. He is suspected of being the
serial killer who is plaguing the city. And since he is not sure if he
did it or not, he has a dazed look on his puss, like he will have
throughout the entire film. Just then, he receives a call from
Sutherland, who displays the crazed mannerisms of a Nazi - type of a
doctor, those more concerned about their inhuman experiments than the
treatment of their patients. Sewell is warned to get out of there
immediately, and sure enough there are strange creatures, who are called
Strangers, coming after him. The police are also in pursuit, they
suspect Sewell of being the serial killer they are looking for. Hurt is
the deadpan, hard - nosed type of movie cop you would see in a 40s noir
film, leading the investigation.</P>
<P>The Strangers we are told in the voice - over that begins the film, are
human-like aliens from another planet, who have altered the memories of
everyone in this city and have changed everyone's identity, so that no
one really knows who is who. They just assume the identity that is
secretly given to them. The Strangers have forced Sutherland, who is not
a Stranger, into working for them to inject a serum into those whose
identities are being changed. The city remains dark at all times, and at
midnight everyone becomes unconscious. Somehow Sewell slipped through
the cracks of the Strangers, and even though he has no idea of who he
is, he knows he can't be a murderer. He will become from now on the
source of our information about what the Strangers are all about. He
will be on the run for the remainder of the film, innocent though he may
be, just like a protagonist in earlier noir films, questioning authority
and trying to pull himself together, unsure of whom to trust. His visit
to the Automat brought back pleasant memories of my childhood in NYC,
but this Automat was cheerless and cold, only its bright lights served
as a sharp contrast to the dark eeriness of this city.</P>
<P>Sewell fingers a postcard with a serene picture of Shell Beach on it,
that he has found in his pocket. Shell Beach seems important to him, but
he doesn't know why. He sees it advertised on billboards all over town,
but when he asks directions to go there, no one can tell him how to get
there. Through Sewell's interminable questioning of everything, he
begins to unravel what is going on. He finds out that the Strangers have
telekinetic powers, enabling them to put people to sleep by focusing on
them, they can also fly and go through walls, and do mind - control
tricks. He also finds out that they came to Earth because they were
slowly dying out, they have no individuality, they only live
unconsciously. What they want to find on Earth is how humans live as
individuals, what makes them think, and what is a soul. They came to do
experiments on humans, using them as if they were guinea pigs. Sewell
was made to be a murderer and studied to see how a murderer acts before
he got away from their clutches.</P>
<P>Sewell has trouble decifering what is real. He questions his wife
(Jennifer), whom he does not even know, and she tells him that she had
an affair with someone else. He falls in love with her anyway, and the
message of the film becomes only too clear, it is in the heart that the
individual is born, and the heart can't be dissected and  experimented
with like a science blinded by technology and ignorant of the
imagination.</P>
<P>Proyas has created a visually challenging movie, that is backed - up by
some thoughtful ideas. It is the kind of film that UFO'ers and alien
watchers will tell ya', see, I told you there was life out there in
space. But to others, this is still only pedestrian stuff, it is not the
real deal. And the flat acting did not add anything positive to the
story. I enjoyed the film for its ambience and for the creative mood it
set. But what diminished its positives, was how the main purpose of the
actors seemed to be, to spout robotic messages for the characters they
were portraying. I wished that Proyas had enough confidence to allow his
visions to do the talking.</P>
