LEON
(THE PROFESSIONAL)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>Few examples seem as appropriate for the phrase "style over
substance" as the career of French filmmaker Luc Besson. His
films earned great deal of popularity simply by looking
"cool" and flooding the audience with impressive sounds and
images, while seriously lacking coherent plot and character
development in the same time. Besson managed to solve at
least some of those problems in his 1990 film LE FEMME
NIKITA. However, it seems that Besson thought that at least
some characters of that film weren't sufficiently explored,
namely The Cleaner, played by Jean Reno. Four years later,
the variation of that character became the protagonist of
THE PROFESSIONAL, action film that is now mostly associated
with the career of Natalie Portman.</P>
<P>In this film Jean Reno plays L‚on, man whose job description
might very well be summed up in the phrase "cleaner". He is
one of the deadliest hitmen in New York underworld, able to
complete even the most complicated and difficult tasks with
incredible efficiency and all that without trace. L‚on's
professional success is in sharp contrast with the quiet and
utterly ascetic private life he mostly spends in his small
apartment. His 12-year old neighbour Mathilda (played by
Natalie Portman), on the other hand, has a lot of problems
with drug-dealing father (played by Michael Badaluco) and
the rest of her dysfunctional family. Things get even worse
when the family gets a visit from the group of corrupt DEA
agents, led by psychopathic Norman Stansfield (played by
Gary Oldman). Mathilda is the only survivor of the massacre
and she seeks the refuge behind her neighbour's door. L‚on
takes her in and reluctantly agrees to shelter her until
things cool down. Mathilda is, on the other hand, quite
impressed when she finds about her protector's true
profession so she wants to use his talents in order to
avenge the death of her 4-year old brother. First she wants
to hire him, then she wants him to teach her skills of
"cleaner", while L‚on, utterly inexperienced in personal
relationships, unsuccessfully tries to keep both of them
from trouble. However, presence of the girl begins to affect
L‚on and he becomes to sees the previous emptiness of his
life. Stansfield in the meantime becomes aware that he left
the eyewitness during the massacre so the extremely violent
conflict between him and L‚on becomes inevitable.</P>
<P>Besson again remains faithful to his reputation by filling
THE PROFESSIONAL with many visually impressive scenes and
very atmospheric and memorable music by his long-time
collaborator Eric Serra. Besson's talent is most visible in
action scenes, especially the final showdown, which is
probably one of the best-choreographed gun battles in the
past decade. However, old-fashioned phrase "style over
substance" still hurts this film and whenever Besson decides
to pay much attention to the plot and character development,
the lack of those particular talents becomes quite apparent.
Large amount of implausabilties in the Besson's screenplay
(it is really hard to imagine ultra-efficient yet illiterate
hitman in modern-day New York or said low- profile hitman
choosing to live next door to drug dealers) is the only part
of the problem. Greatest flaw of this film is Besson's
inability to decide how to handle the relationship between
12-year old girl and the hitman three times her age. Various
avenues - ordinary friendship, substitute parenting and even
Lolita-like relationship - are hinted, but never
sufficiently explored, so after the few scenes in the
beginning film meanders until violent finale brings some
sort of conclusion. However, the acting in this film superb,
especially in the case of Reno who seems as the perfect
choice for this role. Although young Natalie Portman shows a
lot of talent in her first feature film role, sometimes that
performance slips into overacting. Gary Oldman, on the other
hand, does his trademark psycho routine very well, while
Danny Aiello provides good contrast with his minimalist
approach to the role of L‚on's mob contact Tony. Taking
everything into consideration, THE PROFESSIONAL seems to be
one of the most overrated films of the past decade, but
Besson's skills of action director are enough to guarantee
entertainment to those who like "artsy" approach to that
particular genre.</P>
