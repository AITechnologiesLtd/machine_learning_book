<P>     I envy Forest Whitaker, because he's one man who doesn't have to hear
that accusation most men hear when it comes to "women's films":  that he
"just doesn't get it."  Black women seemed to think he got it when he made
the surprise hit WAITING TO EXHALE, and Whitaker himself seemed to think
he could continue getting it when he chose HOPE FLOATS as his follow-up
project.  Women and men, mothers and daughters, girls and their
girlfriends...yep, Whitaker has thrown his y chromosome into the fray with
a blissful disregard for the conventional wisdom that men can't do justice
to the trials of women.</P>
<P>     I'm sure someone somewhere will accuse me of "just not getting" HOPE
FLOATS.  What I really didn't get was how Whitaker could take a fairly
simple story and make it so ragged and unfocused.  It opens promisingly
enough, with a clever sequence in which a devastated Birdee Pruitt (Sandra
Bullock) learns on a nationally televised daytime talk show that her
husband Bill (Michael Pare) is having an affair with her best friend (an
unbilled Rosanna Arquette).  Birdee promptly packs up her things and her
young daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman) and drives from Chicago back to her
hometown of Smithville, Texas where her mother (Gena Rowlands) still lives
and where all her high school classmates still remember her as the
cheerleader and homecoming queen who seemed to have it all.</P>
<P>     HOPE FLOATS might have worked if it had explored its unique premise
for all its dramatic and comedic possibilities.  Surrounding an
emotionally wounded housewife with people who knew her as a teen beauty
queen -- and who most likely harbor a secret delight at her failure --
would be a fascinating way to to watch her grow up and come to terms with
the unreasonable expectations of her youth.  Instead, HOPE FLOATS
relegates that context to a few isolates snippets, opting instead to focus
on plastic relationship dynamics.  Harry Connick Jr. plays the role of the
nice guy with such obvious puppy dog likeabilty that there's never a
moment's tension in the romance between him and Bullock.  The
mother-daughter relationship between Bullock and Rowlands is similarly
tepid, despite a pleasant performance by Rowlands in the role of
conspicuous eccentric (she practices home taxidermy).  The film never
feels like anyone knows exactly where it should go, what we should be
learning about Birdee, and why her story should matter to us at all.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem -- perhaps a very large part -- is the casting of
Bullock in the lead role.  Bullock is a charming actress with a killer
smile, but she doesn't appear to have the faintest idea how to play this
character.  So what she does is smile, and smile constantly, in every
possible context to display every possible emotion.  She smiles radiantly
while dancing with Connick; she smiles pleasantly while accepting the
barbs of her former classmates; she smiles ruefully when she turns down
Connick's request for a date; she smiles drunkenly at a bar.  It makes
a certain sense that the one-time Miss Congeniality would be an inveterate
smiler, but her smile is used as substitute for characterization, as
though it won't matter that we don't understand her at all as long as we
find her so darned nice.</P>
<P>     This generally scattered approach to the material carries through
Whitaker's direction -- in cross-cutting which blunts emotional impact, in 
abrupt changes of focus, in an over-dependence on Caleb Deschanel's silky
cinematography.  The best result of his lack of focus is the amount of
time spent following Bernice and her cousin Travis (LEAVE IT TO BEAVER's
Cameron Finley), the nearly-abandoned son of Birdee's flighty would-be
actress sister.  Both young actors are wonderful, Whitman coping with
taunting classmates and the absence of her father, Travis living in a
perpetual fantasy world dressed up as a frog or a cowboy or a dog.  Their
story -- the story of how absentee parents affect children's lives -- is
infinitely more involving than Birdee's rather mundane and inevitable trip
to "finding herself" (i.e. hooking up with a nice guy).  Sure there are
a few sniffles and chuckles along the way, but nothing nearly as potent as
Bernice howling in pain as her father leaves her behind.  Maybe Forest
Whitaker will end up demonstrating a knack for "getting" the stories of
children.  As for whether he "gets" women's stories...well, maybe he'll
have to face that accusation after all.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dashed HOPEs:  4.</PRE>
