<PRE>                          DO THE RIGHT THING</PRE>
<P>        Written, directed and produced by Spike Lee, this story of a
few days in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn is riveting.
There's no question that Lee is very talented and knows how to make
films.  The cast, in addition to Lee, includes Danny Aiello as the
owner of a pizza parlor in a black neighborhood.  He is terrific in
that role.</P>
<P>        There's Ossie Davis, who does a masterful job as the neighborhood
souse.  There's Ruby Dee.  There's the character who walks around with
his "ghettoblaster" radio, the three men who just sit on chairs and
argue and philosophize, wondering how the Korean across the way, who
has been in the U.S. only one year, owns a grocery store while they
own nothing. . . each with his own explanation.   And there's Lee as the
pizza delivery man, and there are the pizza parlor owner's 2 sons.
Every character is delineated perfectly.</P>
<P>        Something, however, was missing.  Despite everything in the
film ringing true, what was omitted (perhaps because no answer is
possible) was that Lee attempted no solutions to the story, to the
riot, to the killing, to despite many humorous moments, the utter
monotony of most of the lives.</P>
<P>        An epilog contains a quotation from a Martin Luther King, Jr
speech in which he condemns violence, followed by an excerpt from
one by Malcolm X in which he says he is against violence, except in
self defense, and the only way to overcome the oppression is in self
defense.</P>
<PRE>        Certainly a powerful film by a talented moviemaker.</PRE>
<PRE>                       Directed by Spike Lee.</PRE>
