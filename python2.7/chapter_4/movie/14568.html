* 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        I'm not sure if Silvio Horta wrote URBAN LEGEND before or after
the success of SCREAM, but I'm guessing after just because it seems he
may not have had time to write a second draft. Seriously, this idea--a
psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one
and I wish it could have been pulled off. The first sign of trouble comes
with the painfully insipid dialogue. An example: "That [car crash] must've
been awful...for everyone involved." You can tell that the writer intended
that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said,  just no
one figured out what.</P>
<P>I know in slasher movies there isn't supposed to be a lot of great
characterization and I myself don't mind cardboard cutouts, but please
don't let the cutouts be so damn bland. One reason movies like SCREAM,
STAR WARS and DIVA have become so treasured is because they feature
charismatic actors playing interesting characters. Aside from Jared Leto
and Joshua Jackson (who aren't on the screen long enough) no one in URBAN
LEGEND makes the grade. Alicia Witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she
displayed on CYBILL, Rebecca Gayheart actually looks unattractive (not to
mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film) and Robert Englund just
cruises on auto pilot.</P>
<P>Good thing Brad Dourif is here, but wait...he's only in the movie
for five minutes _and_ he's just redoing his good-natured
stuttering character from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. Which brings me
to another aspect of URBAN LEGEND: it's unoriginality. The film most
blatantly ripped off is SCREAM (another reason that makes me think Silvio
Horta wrote this after Craven's and Williamson's great success). URBAN
LEGEND tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way SCREAM
deconstructed slasher films, but it doesn't quite succeed. It's best
stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at "that girl in the Noxzeema ad"
(ie, Rebecca Gayheart) We also have another
killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in URBAN LEGEND and quick,
what movie is this exchange of dialogue from:</P>
<PRE>Female Protagonist: Why?</PRE>
<P>Villain: Why? WHY?!?
Congratulations to those of you who answered SCREAM and/or URBAN LEGEND.</P>
<P>Like I said, this movie could've been great. If only Silvio had
worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script. Still,at
least URBAN LEGEND had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat
realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than 
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.</P>
