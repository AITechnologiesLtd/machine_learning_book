<PRE>                               EXTREME MEASURES
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     It's an old question of what's right and what's wrong:  if you
could cure a disease by killing one person, would you do it?  That's
basically the premise which starts up EXTREME MEASURES, an ultra-creepy
little medical thriller by prolific filmmaker Michael Apted.</P>
<P>     If you can deal with the notion of Hugh Grant as a doctor, you've
probably suspended disbelief enough to buy the whole production.  Dr.
Guy Luthan (Grant) finds a mystery patient in his trauma room at
Gramercy Hospital.  When the patient dies from a bizarre collection of
symptoms, no one seems to care except for the dashing British doc.</P>
<P>     Guy's investigation leads him into a conspiratorial cover-up in the
hospital system, an underground dwelling of human moles, and a cryptic
research lab where groundbreaking medicine is practiced -- on human
subjects.  What's more is that the head of the research lab is none
other than Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), one of the country's most
respected physicians.</P>
<P>     Blending the right amount of "medical" with just enough "thriller,"
EXTREME MEASURES succeeds in giving the audience the willies from its
opening scenes.  Danny Elfman's creepiest score to date does a lot to
help out, too, and Hackman is always good at getting you squirming in
your seat.  Lots of blood, surgical scars, and seizures are even more
effective, giving cause to wonder, where was David Lynch when this movie
was being made?</P>
<P>     Performances are fair to good, with the exception of supporting
player Sarah Jessica Parker, who really isn't at home playing an
unglamorous nurse.  The 2-hour film moves along quite well, too, never
getting too caught up in boring exposition while keeping the viewer
informed with just enough backstory.  On the other hand, there's not a
whole lot of "thrill" to the picture, just background discomfort that's
scarier than any horror flick.</P>
<P>     Overall an above average movie, but EXTREME MEASURES gets bonus
points for exposing the harsh truth about physicians and confirming my
worst fears:  they really are all evil.</P>
