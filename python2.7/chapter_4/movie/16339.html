<P>What provides 'Elizabeth' with a good deal of tension? As a viewer, it 
is not being sure that the woman who lends her name to the period will 
survive.  </P>
<P>We know she flourished, of course, but the early days of her reign were 
assailed by divers types of intrigues:  social, political, even sexual.  
And it is always fascinating to follow a figure when failure is not yet 
an impossibility.</P>
<P>We are quickly introduced to the religious persecution that went on in 
Great Britain in the 1550's.  Three Protestants are brutally shaved and 
tied to a mammoth stake, the square filled with onlookers.  A bishop of 
the Roman Church presides at the spectacle, and his very words, directed 
to the victims of the impending auto-de-fe, show the terrible results of 
politics mixing with religion.</P>
<P>Princess Elizabeth appears first outdoors, dancing with her ladies in 
waiting.  But she soon suffers the wrath of her half sister, Mary Tudor, 
the ailing Queen.  Imprisoned and then released, Elizabeth is warned not 
to consort with anyone perceived as dangerous to the Crown.  Various 
factions form, a Catholic one led by the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher 
Eccleston), a Protestant one led by Sir William Cecil (Sir Richard 
Attenborough) and Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush).  There are 
other players in the political intrigue, such as Mary of Guise (Fanny 
Ardant), and various ambassadors and underlings. After Elizabeth ascends 
the throne, she continues her affair of the heart with Sir Robert Dudley 
(Joseph Fiennes), but the reality of ruling sobers her attitude 
considerably.  The realm's coffers are depleted, its army and navy 
ineffectual.  France and Spain are enemies waiting for a chance to 
consume the entire island.  Does she have it in her to transform her 
callow and impish demeanor?  She is the daughter of Henry VIII, after 
all.</P>
<P>Already the recipient of a Best Actress Award from the Online Film 
Critics Society (OFCS), Cate Blanchett is riveting in the role of the 
Virgin Queen (the film's slightly sarcastic subtitle).  Blanchett's 
Elizabeth is vibrant and principled, spirited and sharp, beautiful and 
bitter.  In a very demanding role, Blanchett is able to assume an air of 
originality, a quiet determination to find or create the inspiration she 
will need to preserve the traditions and power of the monarchy.  Look 
for Blanchett's face on the big screen for years to come, and her name 
on many nomination lists.</P>
<P>Geoffrey Rush is just as strong.  As Francis Walsingham, a man returning 
to court after a period of exile, Rush depicts consummate dedication to 
Queen Elizabeth I.  Walsingham is charged with protecting the Queen, and 
he immerses himself in the arduous task of security.  There's a slight 
resemblance between Walsingham and Inspector Javert, whom Rush played in 
the recent remake of 'Les Miserables.'  Javert is nearly psychotic in 
his pursuit of the quasi-saint, Jean Valjean;  Walsingham's hunting of 
those disloyal to the Crown is almost as obsessive.  Much is implied by 
the script, perhaps a weak point:  perhaps we could have seen more of 
this early Renaissance knight commanding his forces.  We see him only 
once giving orders to a spy.  Still, Rush assists in a steady building 
of plot, until the film resonates with the overtones of power and 
ambition and love of country.</P>
<P>As Sir Robert Dudley, Joseph Fiennes gives a sturdy performance.  His 
part demands him to be first a sincere lover and later a treasonous 
outcast.  Fiennes plays the range well, except that at times he seems 
too arch, his chin beard and cocked brow the harbingers of cliché.  He 
is good here, but better as the Bard of Stratford in 'Shakespeare in 
Love', a fortuitous companion piece whose humor compliments the 
historical tone of 'Elizabeth'.</P>
<P>'Sumptuous' is an apt word for the costumes and cinematography.  They 
function in tandem to create a visual banquet of images.  The few 
peasants we see are appropriately scruffy.  More noticeably, the 
noblemen who are the focus of 'Elizabeth' are outfitted expertly.  The 
retinues of Queens Mary and Elizabeth are stunningly coordinated, and 
all the accoutrements worn by Blanchett are painstaking in their detail.  
My only criticism is the black leather look of the traitors, 
particularly the garb of the main villain, Norfolk.  But the look of the 
film is memorable, to say the least.  Like the momentum of the plot, the 
beauty of the photography causes the viewer a degree of awe;  toward the 
end there is a retrospective montage, almost a collage of greatest 
visual hits, that summarizes the rise and, more importantly, the growth 
of Elizabeth into a mature head of state.</P>
<P>Shekhar Kapur has accomplished a remarkable feat for a director with 
only a few films behind him.  The scenes are well shot, especially ones 
that exploit the mood of such a period piece - bishops held in a dingy 
cell, Walsingham looking down on them from a low-angle vantage.  And at 
the end, as Elizabeth assumes the aspect of born-again virgin, she 
becomes an icon of power and pallor, her servants applying the lead and 
arsenic to her skin.  As the undisputed ruler she crosses a roomful of 
admiring subjects, and for an instant she gets almost too close to the 
camera.  For an instant we are too close to this monarch.  Then we cut 
away to see the young but stern Elizabeth more distantly, and we glimpse 
the bright future of the British Empire.</P>
