<P>     It's a terrible habit of mine that I often find myself watching
non-English language films throught he lens of "how would Hollywood screw
this up." Aside from the implied inherent superiority of all things
sub-titled, there's the strange problem of comparing a film I'm watching
to a film that hasn't even been made, but which in my head is a dire
experience indeed. A film can't help but seem glorious under such
conditions, though it doesn't help the discussion of the film on its own
merits. I was doing a pretty good job of avoiding the hypothetical
comparison in Zhang Yimou's NOT ONE LESS, until a curious thing happened: 
In its final fifteen minutes, it started to turn into its own Hollywood
incarnation. Thank heaven it's so good for so long that the strange twist
can't spoil the experience.</P>
<P>     Using actors whose own names become the names of his characters,
Zhang tells the story of the rural Chinese village of Shuixian and its
unique educational problems. Shuixian's only teacher, Gao Enman, is
leaving on a month-long sabbatical to care for his ill mother, obliging
mayor Tian Zhenda to bring in a substitute from a neighboring village. 
The new teacher is Wei Minzhi, a 13-year-old who's the only person willing
to take the job. Wei is only in it for the 50 yuan she's been promised,
and is eager for the 10 yuan bonus Gao promises her if he returns to find
the same 28 students in his rapidly dwindling class. Then class
troublemaker Zhang Huike leaves for Beijing to help his family pay off its
debts, sending Wei on her own quest to bring Huike back to the village.</P>
<P>     The impressive thing about both Zhang's direction and Shi
Xiangsheng's script (based on his account of his experience as a rural
teacher) is how gradually and unobtrusively Wei's character develops.
She's pretty unsympathetic at the outset -- utterly unqualified for her
post, effective primarily at playing goalkeeper at the schoolroom door, 
but not at all troubled about demanding her money. When Huike leaves,
she's so single-minded about getting him back to guarantee her bonus that
she takes her class on a field trip that essentially amounts to slave
labor, moving bricks to earn the money for bus fare. The cleverly handled
scenes of Wei leading the class in math problems with very real-world
implications make for a solid foundation, but it's only when Wei heads
into the city that her quest becomes more selfless. The amount of time she
devotes to ensuring the welfare of one student -- although initially for
selfish reasons -- turns her into a real teacher.</P>
<P>     Wei's quest and the growing she does along the way make for a
thoroughly compelling narrative, but Zhang has socio-political fish to fry
as well. As NOT ONE LESS draws to a close, the story becomes a statement
about the plight of China's rural poor, including the deteriorating
conditions of schools and the flight of students to help support their
families. There's a funny bit in which a thoroughly terrified Wei goes on
television to help the search for Huike, but it leads to a sentimentalized
ending in which the troubles of the Shuixian school become a media 
sensation. A film crew rolls into town, accompanied by plenty of donated
school supplies, and the children end up gathered around Wei in an 
uplifting "to her, with love" climax while a scrolling message dutifully
informs us about the real-life conditions in rural Chinese schools. It's
still a satisfying resolution, but it's excessively underlined. It's the
way Hollywood films too often try to convince an audience they've not just
watched an enjoyable film, but also become more compassionate,
better-informed citizens of the world.</P>
<P>     The frustrating part is that it's so unnecessary. Virtually from the
outset, the financial conditions of the school become an effective part of
the drama; you'd never expect a film to wring such tension from a student
stepping on the school's more-precious-than-gold chalk supply. The rookie
actors are raw, but do a more than serviceable job of performing their own
lives. In short, NOT ONE LESS does everything a film needs to do to draw
you into its world, and into the characters inhabiting that world. When it
resorts to a message-heavy happy ending, it suddenly feels like another
sort of film entirely. For a thankfully brief moment, I saw a glimpse of
the mass-market crowd-pleaser that might have been. It's a reminder of how
much more pleasing a film can be when it sticks to simpler truths.</P>
