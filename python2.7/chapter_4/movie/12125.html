<PRE>LOST HIGHWAY
***1/2 of **** grade is B+</PRE>
<P>David Lynch is a great director, his films include Eraserhead and Blue
Velvet.  Lynch continues to push the limit with Lost Highway, a film
that dares to be different and definatly does.  This is the kind of film
that Lynch fans will eat up and others will be frustated to tears.  This
film doesn't follow the truths of hollywood film and will piss of most
audiences expecting it to.</P>
<P>This film is also a powerful peice of atmosphere and mood setting.  We
get the setup of a troubled couple getting videotapes on their steps
that become unpersonable (a few seconds of their house) to a later tape
with them sleeping.  The first twenty minutes are the best as the mood
of tension and horror are powerful.  Then the movie changes gears to a
plot involving a mob bos's mole (Patricia Arquete), who was also he wife
of the first troubled couple.  Is this the same lady? What is going on
here?</P>
<P>The more the film goes on the more credibility it throws to the wind. 
After a while the film looks like it may never reach a satisfactor
ending - and it doesn't even try.  </P>
<P>The direction is very good, and so is the acting.  The actors are forced
to reach levels of emotions or logical blandness that they handle it
quite well.  It seems like Lynch can direct anyone to give great
performance, remember Hopper's tour de force in Blue Velvet.</P>
<P>It you are not disturbed by the films lack of satisfing normal standards
you may be by certain S&M scenes that are reminiscent of Rossilini in
Blue Velvet.  Instead of Rossilini's forced public nakedness, we have
Arquete being forced to strip by Robert Loggia as the mob guy.  She ends
up with noting but bikini panties and a very humiliated look on her
face.  I wonder if Lynch has something against women.  Does he find
humiliation sexy or is it a way of establishing power.</P>
<P>You may get the answer to that tough question in the film, Pretty as a
Picture: The Art of David Lynch.  In that film we get an inside look at
Lynch, Lynch's relationship to the cast and crew, and a breif interview
with Arquete.  She says that one of the reasons she chose the film was
because she had a huge phobia of nudity, and she thought the nude scenes
in Lost Highway may help her to get over it.  More importantly, in that
film, you will find a look inside Lynch's art.  He loves dark images and
is fascinated by decay and pushing the limit.  I am highly recomeding
Lost Highway because it pushes that limit and I will not befall the same
ambuitity as other critics.  Often critics call for originality and
imagination but when the get something too new and fresh they dismiss
it, I won't!</P>
