<PRE>The USS Maggie Leaves Quite a Wake [of Grooms]
Runaway Bride</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Galloping onto the screen, a bride in full gown rides horseback through a
field of tall grass accompanied by U2's "Still haven't found what I'm
looking for." "Runaway Bride" puts a strong hoof forward and never looks
back. It's a film full of solid, polished dialogue with a great premise, a
clinch cast and veteran director. It won't leave you sobbing at the altar.</P>
<P>New York columnist Ike Graham, infamous for his commentaries on the female
of the species, writes a shoddy article on small towner Maggie Carpenter
(Roberts) who has a knack for standing up grooms. Unlikely as it may seem,
Graham doesn't check up on the story, jumbles facts and uses her actual name
in the column. Carpenter writes back to the editor and Graham is canned.
Seeking vengeance, he heads to Hale, Maryland to get the real story as
Maggie makes her fourth attempt at the altar.</P>
<P>In my favorite scene, Gere shadows Roberts into a bakery where she is
choosing bride/groom figures for the cake. Gere picks up the three inch
bride whacking the little groom over the head with it, "Bam Bam Bam! Yeah,
this one's Maggie all right."</P>
<P>Like Robert's recent "Notting Hill," it's a sure bet.</P>
<P>Starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts.
Directed by Garry Marshall.
Screenplay by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott.
Produced by Ted Field and Tom Rosenberg at Touchstone/Paramount.
Rated PG.</P>
<P>Grade..........................A</P>
