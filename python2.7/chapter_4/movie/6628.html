<PRE>                            BREAKING THE WAVES
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: In a small village on the north coast
          of Scotland a paralyzed man asks his childlike wife
          to make love to other men in order to have the life
          he can no longer give her.  This is a powerful and
          moving film. The photography is wildly uneven and
          the last scene misgauged, but the story is
          spellbinding.  Rating: low +3 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 27 positive, 1 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     BREAKING THE WAVES is an unusual and extremely compelling film set
in the remote north of Scotland.  It is set in a town long closed to
outsiders where life is ruled by a tight little group of church elders,
all male.  As the film progresses we find that stern Calvinist values
suffuse everyday life.  One of the loyal daughters of the church is
Bess (played by Emily Watson in an Oscar-worthy performance).  Bess is
a childlike woman with a strong abiding faith in God.  But her feelings
go beyond simple faith.  She has conversations with God, voicing both
parts and has formed God in the mold of the cold an unforgiving clique
who run the church.  Hers is a demanding and unforgiving God in this
world with all rewards postponed until the next.  But as the film
opens, God has made a rare exception to give His Bess something
wonderful.  A man has fallen in love with Bess.  True, Jan (played by
Stellan Skarsgard) is an outsider and the elders do not trust
outsiders.  Still, something has opened up in the quiet, mousy Bess and
she can pour out her love on a man.  Jan is a rough North Sea oil
driller, but Bess loves him with a fierceness that startles the people
of the village. But her happiness cannot last and after a week of
marriage, Jan must return to the rig.  To Bess any separation is
tragedy.  After missing Jan unbearably she makes a deal with God to
take whatever consequences to get Jan back.  Then as an apparent
fulfillment, Jan has a violent injury and is paralyzed and perhaps even
dying.  He is back to the village but unable to be with Bess in any but
the most superficial way.  Jan does not want to see Bess waste herself
devoted to a dying man.  He wants her to taste life and asks her to go
and make love to men and come back to tell him about it.  This request
sets in motion a series of unfortunate events and a storm of
conflicting emotions.</P>
<P>     This is the fifth feature film of Danish director Lars Von Trier,
best known in this country for ZENTROPA. That was a good film; this is
a better one.  The one thing that has not improved and, in fact, has
gone considerably downhill, is the look of the film.  For reasons best
known to Von Trier, much of this film was apparently shot with a hand-
held camera.  What is more it is a camera that seems to be forever
fidgeting, jumping from one person to the next.  The scenes that the
camera shoots, except for the chapter titles--the story is split into
chapters, are almost all in subdued color.  Some of the chapter titles
are so beautiful they seem to be more paintings than actual scenes.
The narrative is clean and well-told up until the final half hour.
Then the telling becomes a little muddled.  The final image of the film
does things to the plot that I personally did not care for, but up
until that point the story was extremely good.  It is not easy to make
a character as simple and straightforward as Bess as likable as she is,
but the script written by Von Trier makes the viewer really feel for
Bess.</P>
<P>     Emily Watson turns in a beautiful performance, at times genuinely
heartbreaking.  She plays a woman who is simple--not to say dim-
witted--and so totally consumed by the love of her man that nothing
else has any meaning in her life.  Even her love of God is superseded
by her love for this gift.  Hers is a degree of devotion the screen
usually reserves for dogs' love of their masters.  Watson is a stage
actress new to the screen but whose acting instincts seem rarely short
of perfect in a difficult role.  Stellan Skarsgard is stolid as Jan,
but his role is not one of much complexity.  For much of the film he is
in a horsecollar lying in bed, paralyzed from the neck down.  A
somewhat more interesting role goes to Katrin Cartlidge whose looks are
reminiscent of Amanda Plummer.  She is Bess's sister-in-law who ends up
Jan's nurse.  She is hostile to Jan, suspicious at first of his love of
the simple Bess.  Eventually she realizes the degree that he loves
Bess, but then does not approve of his methods to give Bess a life
independent of himself.</P>
<P>     BREAKING THE WAVES is a powerful and a moving drama, one of the
best of the year.  It does not seem to be getting a lot of play, but it
is worth looking for.  I give it a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
