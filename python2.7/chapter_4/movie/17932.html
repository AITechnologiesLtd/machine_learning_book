A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>1993 was the year that lacked thought-provoking Hollywood
films. One of the exceptions was GROUNDHOG DAY, fantasy
comedy by Harold Ramis. Its concept - protagonist caught in
a same day for all eternity - was later used in some popular
TV shows like XENA or THE X-FILES. The concept, however,
wasn't original. It was first used in a short story by
science fiction author Richard A. Lupoff. The same story was
used in 1990 film by Jonathan Heap. Three years later,
television remake was filmed, this time directed by Jack
Sholder and written by Philip Morton.</P>
<P>The movie protagonist is Barry Thomas (Jonathan Silverman),
office worker who meets beautiful scientist Lisa Fredericks
(Helen Slater) and falls in love with her. But, before he
could meet her, she falls victim to uknown assassins.
Depressed, Barry goes to bar and gets drunk. Next morning,
he is surprised to see his colleagues use exactly the same
lines and doing exactly the same movements like yesterday.
When he sees Lisa alive and well, he figures that something
is very wrong. Next morning, exactly the same thing happens,
and Barry realises that he is trapped inside the time loop.
Finally, he discovers the facts that could serve as an
explanation - secret nuclear physics experiments that may
have disrupted the time-space continuum and caused the loop.</P>
<P>Compared with GROUNDHOG DAY, this film is disappointment. On
its own, it is more than passable piece of TV entertainment.
The story has its own internal logic (although the
pseudoscientific explanation is rather lame). Jack Sholder,
director whose best film so far is 1986 SF thriller HIDDEN,
is handling this television production quite well. The
characters and situations are interesting, providing a lot
of humour. The actors are capable in their roles, although
they lack charisma (especially Jonathan Silverman). Martin
Landau, on the other hand, wasted his own in the role of
rather conventional project leader. All in all, good film
for the viewers who watch movies without too much
expectations.</P>
