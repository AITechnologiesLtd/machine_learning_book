<P>"The scent of green papaya is a personal childhood memory.  Everyone [in 
Vietnam] knew the gestures associated with the preparation of the papaya 
and, since the houses weren't soundproofed, you often heard it being 
prepared in the house next door.  You knew the sound because the papaya 
is hollow and when you hit it (with a knife), it makes a very 
characteristic noise.  The papaya was really a part of everyday 
Vietnamese life.  Since the green papaya was a vegetable prepared by 
women, it immediately becomes a symbol of women's work."
              - Writer/director Tran Anh Hung</P>
<P>     Most films rely on plot, character, and action to tell their
story, but there are rare exceptions, one of which is THE SCENT OF
GREEN PAPAYA, the deceptively simple tale of two periods in the life of
a Vietnamese girl named Mui (Lu Man San at age ten; Tran Nu Yen-Khe at
age twenty).  Relying more on tone and feel, THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA
manages to engross an audience because of its scrupulous attention to
detail and its ability to effectively capture the essence of life's
subtle, individual moments.</P>
<P>     To say that THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA has no plot would be to
grossly misrepresent it.  The movie is divided into two sections.  The
first, which takes place in 1951, details Mui's arrival as a young girl
at the house where she will spend the next ten years of her life
working as a servant.  Midway through the film, the time frame shifts
ahead a decade.  Now Mui is working for Khuyen (Vuong Hoa Hoi), a music
composer, and this portion of the story focuses on what transpires
during this portion of Mui's life.</P>
<P>     THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA succeeds because writer/director Tran
Anh Hung has an almost-perfect sense of what is necessary to make a
simple story work.  There are no grand revelations or surprising plot
twists, but the film is compelling nevertheless, precisely because of
its sense of reality.  What other recent film has made the act of
giving a cooking lesson such a potentially-intriguing activity?</P>
<P>     The effectiveness of THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA is surprising
considering its visual limits.  Filmed on France sound stages rather
than on-location in Vietnam, there is none of the expected lush
vegetation one has come to expect from a film set in this country.
Even the papaya trees are dead husks with real fruit and leaves glued
to them (although it's not possible to tell this from watching the
movie).  On the other hand, the use of sound effects is excellent, from
the chirping of a cricket to the roar of a plane overhead.  In a film
with so little dialogue (there is a space of thirty minutes where only
several lines are uttered), music and sound effects become critical
contributors.</P>
<P>     The acting is adequate--no more and no less, but because THE SCENT
OF GREEN PAPAYA focuses more on moments than characters, this isn't a
serious detriment.  Lu Man San, as Mui at ten years old, is cute and
impish, with a commendable variety of facial expressions.  Her
successor, Tran Nu Yen-Khe (the director's real-life fiancee) isn't as
impressive.  She smiles too much and possesses an almost-sinuously
graceful body language that seems inappropriate to the circumstances.</P>
<P>     What THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA does so well is to show the
everyday life of a culture that has been bombed into history.  This is
the kind of motion picture that could easily become tedious and boring,
because so little happens.  To manage what Tran Anh Hung has by telling
his story and holding the interest of the audience, deserves notice and
credit.  THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA is an enjoyable experience made all
the more enchanting by its simplicity.</P>
