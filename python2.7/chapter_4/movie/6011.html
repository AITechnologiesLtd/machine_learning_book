<PRE>                            AMERICAN BUFFALO
                       A film review by Steve Rybin
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rybin</PRE>
<P>Directed by Michael Corrente.  Starring Dustin Hoffman, Dennis Franz, 
Sean Nelson.  Rated R.</P>
<P>"I'm not here to smother you in theory," says Dustin Hoffman's character 
in "American Buffalo".  Don't believe a word of it.  Teach, played well 
by Hoffman, does nothing but theorize.  Dennis Franz plays Teach's friend,
 an owner of a part-junk, part-antique store who has been scammed out of 
some money in the sale of a rare buffalo nickel.  Don wants the nickel 
back, and maybe something else on the side; a kid named Bobby 
(resourcefully played by Nelson) often hangs around his shop, asking for 
money, and he wants part of the plan too.  Teach wants to cut Bobby out 
of the plan.  In fact, Teach seems to want to run the whole show.  Why?  
Maybe because he has nothing better to do.</P>
<P>"American Buffalo", written by David Mamet (based on his stageplay), is 
well-directed by Michael Corrente, but what's most noticeable is the 
three strong performances in the film.  Hoffman, Franz, and Nelson work 
well together.  The role of Teach was one many actors in Hollywood wanted 
- simply because it provides them with a LOT of dialogue - and colorful 
dialogue at that.  The "F" word is used quite frequently throughout, and 
it's used mostly as a defensive tool for the characters.  Their 
volcabularly is not large.  They use profanity as a crutch.  Technically, 
these people are lowlifes; men who once had dreams, but who must now 
settle for simpler goals.  Overall, this is an interesting character 
study, although it probably plays better on stage than on film.</P>
