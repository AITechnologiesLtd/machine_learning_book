<PRE>Family Feuding
Say It Isn't So</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Like "The Mexican," "Say It Isn't So" tries its hand at genre gender 
blending. In this case, the "American Pie" no-joke-is-too-low, 
male-oriented comedy is injected with a dose of good old-fashioned 
female-oriented love story (about 2 parts the former with one part the 
latter). Even the title chimes like a Freddie Prinze Jr. flick. And like 
"The Mexican," though not rock solid, this film finds a way to 
entertain. </P>
<P>The picture starts out with a bang. When dog-catcher Gilly (Chris Klein) 
joins his boss for a dysfunctional family dinner, insults are passed 
around the table like appetizers, while topics from sex to 
nipple-piercing comprise the main course of irreverency. You'll probably 
embarrass yourself by laughing at such lowbrow humor. After a strong 
first act in which Gilly falls in love with a lovely, though incompetent 
hairdresser, things simmer to nearly a lull after we learn a family 
secret that makes their love impossible. The enjoyment factor later 
elevates in time for the climax. Will Jo marry the wrong guy in Beaver, 
Oregon? Or will Gilly with the steadfast assistance of loyal friend 
"Dig," find a way to set things right? </P>
<P>Shameless, the picture finds its humor anywhere it can - often in 
genital areas. In fact, I suspect, one spot too hairy for the censors 
was yanked from the final version. Still, don't let the physical comedy 
eclipse the clever-er one-liners. </P>
<P>Here are a couple of lines that resonate the funny bone via the skull... </P>
<P>After Gilly's awkward dining experience with the boss' psycho family he 
suggests, "Maybe you should hire a professional..." The boss responds 
without missing a beat and stone cold serious, "You mean ... hitman?" </P>
<P>Then after Jo accidentally lops off a chunk of Gill's gill (ear), she 
invites him to dinner, "What are you doing tonight?" </P>
<P>"Healing mostly." Gill shyly replies. </P>
<P>There's more where those came from, some too obscene to mention here. </P>
<P>Though easily missed because of its genre, the picture and lighting 
quality are very very sweet. </P>
<P>Some gags drop like dead flies, while others are laugh-out-loud 
uproarious. In the end, an above average night at the movies. </P>
