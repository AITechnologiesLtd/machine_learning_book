<P>In one of the most politically correct Disney movies to date, we have a
female saving China in an era when male chauvinistic pigs dominated the
continent – and they still do! This is the tale of a legendary Chinese
heroine, Mulan, a folk tale of courage and honour handed down by mouth
over centuries. It is the time when China stands on the brink of
disaster, and the threat isn't the Japanese. The Huns of Mongols are
about to invade China from the north, and not even The Great Wall can
keep these big, hairy barbarians out.</P>
<P>A royal decree is issued by the Emperor, summoning a male from every
family to stand and defend the country against the Huns. Mulan's father
is crippled in the last war and like any strong-willed, progressive
thinking, independent female, Mulan decides she can take her father's
place by acting the man - and she does a great job! In fact Mulan looks
outright ugly as a girl, but when she cuts her hair and throws on the
manly garb - she blossoms into one of the spunkiest looking young studs
this side of the divide. Don't get the wrong idea, this isn't just a
story about cross-dressing - there's ALSO romance. The love interest is
none other that the general's son, Captain Shang who has been ordered to
train the recruits. Shang has an annoying tendency to bear his muscles
every opportunity he gets in front of a very flat chested Mulan. This
actually generates a buried sexual tension that erupts in the end when
Mulan not only saves China, but also the hunky Shang. When she is
wounded the secret is out, but how does a man brought up on the
traditionalist views of a male domineering society take to being saved
by a woman?</P>
<P>Hearing Donny Osmond sing, will bring tears to your eyes - and it's not
because he can sing. Lea Salonga is the leading Asian girl of Broadway,
and would have easily snared the singing part of Mulan with little
difficulty, if not due to lack of competition. As for the speaking
voices, Ming-Na Wen of THE JOY LUCK CLUB and THE SINGLE GUY, is ideal as
the spirited Mulan. Eddie Murphy generates a lot of the laughs as Mushu
the family dragon – somehow hearing him is easier than watching him.</P>
<P>If this movie doesn't make a father proud of his daughter, I'm not sure
what will. If only the boys of this day and age had more of the
character and initiative shown by MULAN, the world would be a better
place. Great family viewing.</P>
