<P>     John Schlesinger, of all people, directs this hilarious BBC and
Thames Television-produced comedy about a tidy society girl (Kate
Beckinsale) who moves to the country, to stay with relatives at a
ramshackle family farm.  Recently orphaned, Miss Flora Poste has chosen
Cold Comfort Farm as the place to begin collecting "life experiences"
for use in a novel that she hopes to write.  ("One as good as
'Persuasion'," she notes.) And, much like another Austen heroine, Ms.
Poste is soon imposing upon her backwoods brethren the standards of
style, manners, and hygiene.  (In a letter to London, she pleads "Send
fashion magazines!")</P>
<P>     Though, at times, it tries too hard to be funny-- Eileen Atkins'
Cousin Judith glares as if she were starring in a sequel to YOUNG
FRANKENSTEIN-- this haughtier episode of "The Beverly Hillbillies"
ultimately warms from within.  We're drawn into the characters and are
soon laughing with them, as well as *at* them.  And laugh you will.  A
scruffy Ian McKellan (RICHARD III) preaching fire-and- brimstone to a
quivering country congregation is alone worth the price of admission.
Also good is a GONE WITH THE WIND reference that happens later in the
film. </P>
