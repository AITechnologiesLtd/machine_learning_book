<PRE>A KNIGHT'S TALE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>One week, in DRIVEN, we have a bunch of pretty boys competing in fast 
cars, and a few weeks later, in A KNIGHT'S TALE, we retreat to the 
middle ages so a different set of good looking guys can joust together.  
This time, however, it is not just any heartthrob, but none other than 
cover boy Heath Ledger (10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU and THE PATRIOT) who 
plays the lead, William Thatcher.   Since peasants, like William, were 
unable to join in the fun on horseback, he takes on a pseudonym and 
pretends to be a knight.</P>
<P>As the evil and undefeated Count Adhemar, Rufus Sewell plays his usual 
hissable villain who will stoop to anything to win.  That he and William 
are destined to end up fighting for the world championship -- bet you 
didn't know they had them back then -- is obvious from the start.  Just 
as easy to guess is the story's big "twist."  </P>
<P>Shannyn Sossamon, as Jocelyn, plays the woman that both William and the 
Count want.  Jocelyn is a fickle female who likes to devise strange 
tests of a man's love.  Sossamon provides a nice smile but little else.</P>
<P>William's ace in the hole is one Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) -- 
"Chaucer's the name; writing's the game" -- who serves as William's 
personal rabble rousing announcer and poet-in-residence.  A wonderfully 
comic Bettany, acting like a boisterous frat house president at an Ivy 
League school, steals every scene he's in.  Although my female friends 
will probably disagree with me, Bettany's performance provides a much 
more convincing reason to see the movie than Ledger's looks.</P>
<P>The movie is at its the best when it's the most over the top, which, 
regretfully, isn't nearly often enough.  The first match, for example, 
has the medieval crowd singing and clapping, "We Will, We Will, Rock 
You!"  It's an exhilarating moment that literally rocks the house.  
While the knights are trying to knock each other off their mounts, the 
vendors work the assembled peasants and nobility, selling hot wine and 
other popular beverages.</P>
<P>The dialog is mainly modern, but writer Brian Helgeland, who also 
directs, throws in a few more authentic sounding lines as when William 
declares, "Love has given me wings so I must fly."</P>
<P>Between lively musical numbers from "The Boys Are Back In Town" and 
"Takin' Care Of Business," the movie features one jousting match after 
another until you begin to think that they completely forgot to edit the 
movie at all.  It just goes on and on, turning what should be an 
energetic tale into an endurance contest.  There's even a needless side 
story about William's blind father.  It all adds up to 40 minutes of 
bloat in a film that should have been released in a fighting trim.</P>
<P>A KNIGHT'S TALE runs a long 2:12.  It is rated PG-13 for action 
violence, some nudity and brief sex-related dialogue and would be 
acceptable for kids about 7 and up.  </P>
