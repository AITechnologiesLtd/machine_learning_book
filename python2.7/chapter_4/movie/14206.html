<P>There are many that feel that this is one of France's greatest novels of the
century.  Even if it is not, it certainly has been made into  a film that is
without a doubt, an excellent example of the quality of films that the
equivalent of the Academie Francaise, is coming up with.  Although the
themes may come off a bit political, still this novel is as much an attack
on the system as it is on the views that people undertake, in order to get
something done.  In the process, many things may happen which no one
desired.</P>
<P>It is the turn of the century and things in France are not well, with the
industrial revolution.  France was slow moving into the new world, and it is
paying a tough price.  Their workers do not produce enough, and their
ability to enter the international market, has caused the upper class many
problems.  Still, they survive on both fronts.</P>
<P>But the pressures that the lower classes in the mines are facing seem to get
tougher, instead of better.  No one can earn a living, except the well to
do, whose antics do not go by unnoticed in this film.</P>
<P>In due time, with the advent of outsiders coming around, the working
population gets aroused into a strike, and a revolution.  And with this they
hope that they could get better wages, and get the upper class to pay them
better wages and cut down the punishments they face.</P>
<P>But the strike does not get resolved, and turns ugly.  The upper class bring
in replacement workers from Belgium, and continue with their work, however
meager it may be.  And the striking workers, lacking unity and cohesiveness
of any kind, can not do much, except get angry. Their anger turns into a
revolution and they begin tearing apart the mines that once provided them
with jobs.  Some of the owners are, however, honest.  One neighboring mine
owner explains that he has no stock brokers, and no outside support and is
on his own, and his workers seem to be reasonably happy. But the main mine
in question is being run by a ruthless man intent on showing his inferiors
that they do not have what it takes to get the job done.  And his family's
main worry is the mother's desire to maintain her affair with the  ruthless
man, who is being courted to marry her own daughter so she  can also get to
him.</P>
<P>Amidst all this, are many ideals which tempt the working groups. A man who
has some inner strength, Ettiene, becomes a reluctant leader, and since he
is an outsider, he is a perfect man to speak up.  The locals do not lose.
And a socialist monger, expouses the ideals which would take away the
excesses of the upper class, whose style is grotesque, and class-less.  On
an eventual day, the socialist gets to one of the mines and undoes a water
duct, so it will eventually flood the mine and bust it.  This unfortunate
deed, ends up killing several miners, and placing many others in danger.
And in the process, of trying to save the ones that might be alive several
others are killed as well.  The end result, is that the family that owns
this particular mine leaves, and the mine is restarted. And the workers have
returned to their pits.</P>
<P>It ends with one of the miner's wives, who has lost her whole family in the
trenches, going to work, but forgiving Ettiene for having roused them.  The
people, the workers, have accepted their humility and returned to their
meager ways.  Nothing has
changed, but this time, one is sure that they will not strike again, for
quite some time.</P>
<P>Of special note is Maheu, with whom Etienne stays for some time, and who
becomes a strong figure when the strike gets going.  But, in an unfortunate
face off with the French police, he is shot, and many innocents lose their
life.  The French upper class will have
to pay for this one.  But it never happens.  The workers eventually need
some food for their families and there is nothing else that can be done for
work.</P>
<P>Emile Zola wrote a great novel, with the hope of creating some awareness in
the situation.  He never blamed anyone, directly, although the socialist
seems to be the one that causes the most harm, something that many a
political force in France never has liked.  But, even though, the socialist
ideal may have been right for this moment, the way it went about it was
totally wrong. The French, still are today, very much a people's nation, but
it is ( like everyone else ) hopelessly attached to romantic notions about
anything.  The grass is always greener in the other side.  Maheu's wife's
pardon of Etienne in the end, is a sad moment, but never a victory for
anyone.  The workers are
still trapped.  they have been beaten down, by the destruction. The upper
class moves on, and never faces its due.</P>
<P>Extraordinary performances all around, specially Gerard Depardieu as Maheu
and Renaud as Etienne.  As is typical of any Claude Berri directed film, his
characters are solid, and what could be a slow film, always proves to be
dynamic in some sort of way.  Some outstanding design in the cinematography
helps as well.  The film is quite claustrophobic when it needs to be, and is
almost always trapped in an over crowded space, be it Maheu's house or
elsewhere.</P>
<P>Outstanding music adds to this sad, but so very well done film.  If not for
a great novel, in lesser hands, this film would have come off preachy.
Instead, it comes out as a great story, beautifully told, by a master film
maker.</P>
<PRE>Should see it.</PRE>
