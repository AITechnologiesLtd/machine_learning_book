<PRE>_Next_Friday_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Released in 1995, the low-budget comedy _Friday_ was obviously meant  to
be a big showcase for its co-writer/star/executive producer, Ice Cube. 
However, it was Cube's co-star, a then-unknown stand-up comedian by the 
name of Chris Tucker, who was ultimately credited for the film's modest 
but solid box office returns and even greater popularity in video stores
(where it is still a rental and sales hit). With such a profitable
investment-to-return ratio, a follow-up is inevitable, so now we get to
see what happens _Next_Friday_. But with Tucker having long graduated
into bigger-budget starring roles, one wishes that Cube and New Line
Cinema had left well enough alone.</P>
<P>        Although it prominently featured the now-famous hyper comic stylings of
Tucker, the original _Friday_ was distinguished by its decidedly laid
back tone and execution. Sort of a lighthearted tonic against the
traditionally dour and violent cinematic portrayals of South Central Los
Angeles, the film followed one especially eventful 24 hours in the lives
of a close knit South Central neighborhood, and director F. Gary Gray
(who himself has moved on to higher-profile and -budget projects) and
writers Cube and DJ Pooh perfectly captured the often-lumbering rhythms
of everyday life: moments of eventful activity padded by stretches of
inactivity that is interesting in its own way. The film presented the 
'hood as a typical community, populated by people all with their own
little quirks, some more eccentric than others. As such, _Friday_ was, if
not exactly groundbreaking cinema, a likable film--not to mention at
times one that was quite funny, thanks to Tucker and his memorable
pothead character, the aptly named Smokey. </P>
<P>        For _Next_Friday_, Cube (now writing solo) and director Steve Carr
decide to compensate for Tucker's absence (for the record, Smokey is
mentioned as being in drug rehab) by creating some manic energy of their
own in the script department. _Next_Friday_'s more quickly paced story
transplants Cube's rather blah Craig Jones from the 'hood to the home of
his uncle Elroy (Don "DC" Curry) and wisecracking cousin Day-Day (Mike
Epps), who--after winning the lottery--live in a fairly upscale
neighborhood in the suburban haven of Rancho Cucamonga. Craig is sent
there by his dog catcher father (John Witherspoon, the only other major
returnee) to stay out of trouble--which, of course, is not far behind: it
turns out the stereotypically boorish Latino drug dealers across the
street have a beef with Day-Day; and Deebo (Tommy "Tiny" Lister, Jr.),
the bully whom Craig had beaten at the end of the previous film, has
escaped from prison and is out for revenge. </P>
<P>        Plot details such as these, however, take a back seat to individual
gags.  Where the first film was fairly grounded in reality, _Next_Friday_
is all about outrageousness. Craig's father spends most of the movie
wearing a uniform stained with dog excrement. Uncle Elroy indulges in
wild sex with his girlfriend Suga (Kym E. Whitley), who, in turn, would
like to "keep it in the family" and get down and dirty with Craig. 
Across the street, the drug dealers get down and dirty themselves with a
few "bitches" (which shows how well women are portrayed in this
installment). Craig gets into a knock-down, drag-out fight with the
flamboyant owner of the record store where Day-Day works. And, since it
wouldn't be a _Friday_ without it, there's a lot of marijuana, which is
given an even more prominent role. These bits may sound funny here in
print, but in execution--and when added to a number of other jokes
attempting the same shocking effect--it's all a bit too much.</P>
<P>        That could not be said of the original, whose easy-going way took its 
time to endear itself to the audience. _Next_Friday_ is always in your
face, and in laying on all the outrageousness, Cube sacrifices a key
element to _Friday_'s appeal: a surprising amount of heart. Not only does
_Next_Friday_ not have any, it also lacks any soul.</P>
