U.K./USA 1995</PRE>
<P>        Near the beginning of ANGELS & INSECTS, our romantic protagonist
courts the object of his very sexual affections in odd fashion. That
scene, which involves a veritable swarm of butterflies and moths crawling
across the woman's clothing and skin, is a good indicator of the film's
ambitions. Putting a Victorian estate under the microscope, ANGELS &
INSECTS postulates that this family unit, with sons, daughters and
servants all tending slavishly to the needs of a bloated matriarch, is
something less sophisticated and more distasteful than your average
backyard ant farm. </P>
<P>        William Adamson (Mark Rylance) is an outsider among the
blueblooded Alabasters, the family whose patriarch, Sir Harald (Jeremy
Kemp), rescued the young naturalist from a disastrous shipwreck. He is
allowed to live with the Alabasters as Harald's assistant, and swiftly
falls under the spell of the oldest daughter, Eugenia (Patsy Kensit). 
This courtship among the insects is the film's most direct metaphor, and
its most satisfying conceit. As William confesses his love to Eugenia, he
looses upon her what first seem to be the world's loveliest butterflies.
But soon, Eugenia is beset by the unsightly male counterparts to the
beautiful females, which crawl across her body, drawn by female
pheromones. </P>
<P>        The trauma of that experience isn't enough to derail the romance,
which unfolds to the chagrin of Eugenia's brother, Edgar (Douglas
Henshall), who considers William an unfit suitor.  Edgar's sneering
insults grow more and more provocative, but William resists his verbal
exhortations to physical battle and marries Eugenia. His assimilation into
the family is thus made literal, and Harald seems rather fond of the young
man -- but Edgar won't let up, spouting continually about how little
William knows of the world, and the significance of his improper breeding. </P>
<P>        This socio-scientific Darwinism is as much a key to ANGELS &
INSECTS as are the butterfly and ant-farm metaphors (when Eugenia proves
herself to be less than an ideal lover, William bides his time with a
detailed study of an ant colony on the estate). For the first hour or so,
I was sitting on the edge of my seat, gamely tracking all of the asides,
double entendres, and allegorical declamations. Philip Haas's screenplay
tries to cram all the thematic concerns of its source material (the
novella MORPHO EUGENIA, by retroVictorian scribe A.S. Byatt) into the
two-hour space of a feature film, but it's a little much. </P>
<P>        Those concerns spill over from the story and dialogue into the
film's visual grammar, as well. While the overall production design is
sumptuous and striking, the movie's infatuation with its own color sceme
grows tiring. For instance, when Kensit turns up in one of her
show-stopping gowns, an unlikely peacock blue fringed in blood red, the
effect is an imperfect distillation of the Peter Greenaway Effect-decidely
garish in appearance, but relatively graceless in execution.  More
effective for my money is the less specific sense of dread that infuses
the proceedings, especially in the scenes leading up to the marriage of
the unlikely lovers. </P>
<P>        So maybe it's because the film wore me out in its first section
that I found the second half fairly tedious. It's mostly a waiting game.
We know that Kristin Scott Thomas (she plays Matty Crampton, the family
tutor) gets billing above Kensit, so her role will soon become prominent.
The ad campaign has assured us that there's a "startling"  revelation in
the final reels, but the punch is telegraphed across most of the movie.
And, of course, we know that something's got to give -- and it does. </P>
<P>        That having been said, the movie does have its tremendous
pleasures. The performances are decidedly less mannered than we've come to
expect from costume drama, and Rylance and Henshall make deliciously
credible intellectual adversaries. I'll even go out on a limb for Kensit,
whose vaguely unsettling concupiscent charms have never before been put to
such perfect use. The cinematography is lush and surprising, and the
atmosphere is boldly creepy. </P>
<P>        The opening credits sequence, which flash back to Adamson and a
troupe of Amazonian dancers frolicking in the firelight, is more honestly
sexual than anything that follows, and we get the sense that he was never
happier than he was among the natives (as if to underscore the point, the
titular letters spelling out "Angels" cross the screen in front of the
dancers). This sequence, beautifully edited by the director's wife,
Belinda Haas, helps us understand the libidinous freedom that Adamson
craves, even as he takes a luscious wife in an ostensible paradise. While
the inhabitants of a less seething Victorian tableaux might negotiate
apparently charmed paths to a satisfying but unlikely happy ending, we are
made to grow more and more certain that the only resolution to the
Victorian dilemma postulated by ANGELS & INSECTS is escape. </P>
