<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   On December 20, 1996, amidst all the year-end Oscar bait releases
   from the major studios, Miramax's genre label Dimension Films quietly
   released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled SCREAM.  Although
   the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent
   years, the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently
   high box office returns, eventually topping $100 million domestic and
   becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history,
   while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing
   slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard
   cliches associated with the genre.  The sleeper success of SCREAM
   sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly, everybody was
   looking for hip, inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap
   similar fortunes.  The strategy of casting young TV stars to draw the
   youth demographic was given a boost.  SCREAM director Wes Craven,
   previously best known as the creator of New Line's A NIGHTMARE ON
   ELM STREET film series, was thrust back into the limelight.  And
   SCREAM's rookie scribe, Kevin Williamson, burst onto the film scene
   in stunning fashion.</P>
<P>   It's hard to understate this last point.  Mr. Williamson has, based
   upon his produced screenplays as of this writing (SCREAM, I KNOW WHAT
   YOU DID LAST SUMMER from October 1997, and now SCREAM 2), enjoyed a
   meteoric rise to fame, quickly become the most well-known
   screenwriter amongst the Entertainment Weekly-reading, box office
   figure-watching youth culture since -- well, since that Quentin
   Tarantino guy (whom, it is said, has also achieved some renown as a
   director).  Indeed, in a singularly freakish oddity, it is the
   screenwriter, Mr. Williamson, and not the director that has been
   receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of SCREAM, and
   the print advertisements for SCREAM 2's theatrical release are
   similarly indicative of his increasing prominence: while the
   traditional "A FILM BY WES CRAVEN" drapes the film's title in the
   ads, right below it (in equal sized font, yet) reads "WRITTEN BY
   KEVIN WILLIAMSON", an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution
   to the project which may be unprecedented.  (I can envision the board
   of WGA, licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until
   their goal of "A FILM BY <director and screenwriter>" is attained.)
   And, much like Mr. Tarantino's screenwriting, Mr. Williamson's work
   is vaguely unconventional, incorporating both contemporary pop
   culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of
   his characters.  In SCREAM, they satirically discussed other horror
   films; here in the sequel, the characters discuss the relative merits
   of film sequels.</P>
<P>   SCREAM was written in 1995 during the infamous Bob Dole rampage
   against Hollywood, and Mr. Williamson's rejection of this tirade
   clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel.
   While the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of SCREAM
   2 was included when Mr. Williamson sold the screenplay for SCREAM --
   the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving
   characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived, and
   it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging.</P>
<P>   Like its predecessor, SCREAM 2 opens with a splashy, eye-grabbing
   prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative;
   this time around, we're following the exploits of a young couple
   (Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps) attending a riotously gleeful sneak
   preview screening of STAB (a running film-within-a-film gag where the
   "true life" events behind the first film has been turned into a
   movie).  However, although it tries hard and has some good ideas --
   the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded
   me of the one I was sharing the theatre with, and I was certainly
   thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away
   myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale
   imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with Drew
   Barrymore (where her performance not only convinced me that she
   *could* act, but was so good that it would rank among the best
   performances in a horror film that I've ever seen).  There are too
   many knowing, hip pop-culture references crammed into the SCREAM 2
   sequence, and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as
   SCREAM's; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a
   final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying, the payoff here is
   almost campily theatrical.</P>
<P>   Flash to the campus of a smalltown Ohio college, where returning
   characters Sidney (Neve Campbell) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) have
   relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the
   events in the first film.  The murders which open this film result in
   reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid TV reporter Gale
   Weathers (Courteney Cox) roars into town to cover the breaking story,
   while ever-awkward former deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) flies
   in to protectively guard over Sidney.  They're joined by Cotton Weary
   (Liev Schreiber), who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo
   appearance during the first film; his role here is significantly
   expanded.  The film incidentally provides surprisingly little
   backstory, although I suppose a good case can be made that it really
   isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first
   installment, but because this is, after all, a sequel to a slasher
   film: what do you *think* happened to these characters in the prior
   movie?</P>
<P>   There's a lot of new faces on the scene too: Sidney's new boyfriend,
   Derek (Jerry O'Connell) and her new roommate Hallie (Elise Neal),
   Randy's fellow film student Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), Gale's
   newly-assigned nervous cameraman Joel (Duane Martin), omnipresent
   local journalist Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf), co-ed Cici Cooper (Ms.
   Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar), and a pair of simpering
   sorority sisters (Rebecca Gayheart and SIRENS' Portia Di Rossi).  Any
   of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter, could
   be the next victim.</P>
<P>   As is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a Kevin Williamson
   screenplay, the narrative is once again framed around the
   increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit.  One problem that SCREAM
   didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer.
   Here (and to some extent in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER), Mr.
   Williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the
   identity of the killer into a mystery.  The film occasionally becomes
   so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at
   the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense
   of its thriller elements.  (It doesn't help matters any that the
   killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go.)</P>
<P>   Indeed, the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally
   unmasked, frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes.  This is one of
   those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about
   their machinations, scheming, and motivation, that you actually get
   bored listening and just want them all to get on with it.</P>
<P>   While the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived,
   the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in
   its suspense sequences.  They're staged much more imaginatively here
   (save for the first post-prologue murder, which is handled in such a
   mediocre, conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly
   from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film
   satirized), and are much more fun to watch.  It's hard to hold back a
   smile during a giddy scene where Sidney and her companion have to
   climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car
   wreck, and a cat-and-mouse chase involving Gale and Dewey in a campus
   sound lab is very nicely staged, although its ultimate resolution is
   hilariously overblown.</P>
<P>   In terms of its characters, the strong part of the film is the
   interesting relationship between Gale and Dewey (who ambles onto the
   screen accompanied by his very own theme music).  Their verbal
   sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where
   Dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency
   is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about
   their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed.</P>
<P>   On the other hand, Sidney is pretty dull here.  She doesn't have any
   compelling presence, and there's nothing particularly interesting
   about her this time around to make us care about her other than that
   she's the returning heroine.  Given this, and the fact that there's
   no strong second banana character for Sidney (Elise Neal's role isn't
   nearly substantive enough to adequately fill Rose McGowan's shoes),
   it's no wonder why the roles for Gale and Dewey have been
   significantly augmented for this installment of the film.</P>
<P>   What surprises me the most about SCREAM 2 is its zealousness in
   decimating its cast.  The film's mounting body count bears out the
   fact that *no* character is safe (well, *almost*); while in principal
   I applaud this bold policy, at some point you've got to be wondering
   about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel.  (I
   was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in
   particular, whose casting for the next installment of the series
   would've seemed obvious.)  But hey, as Rose McGowan's character said
   in the first film: "No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface -- I want
   to be in the sequel!"  Look what that got her.</P>
