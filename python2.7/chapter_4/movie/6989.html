<PRE>                           WAITING FOR GUFFMAN
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: This mockumentary is of a small town
          celebrating its 150th anniversary by putting on a
          show in complete ignorance of the fact that nobody
          in town has any talent.  The film invites
          comparison to the classic comedy SMILE, but that
          film at the same time was far more serious and more
          funny than this one.  While this film has its
          moments and the occasional funny bit, it never
          really takes off as well as it might have.  Rating:
          +1 (-4 to +4)
          New York Critics: 9 positive, 1 negative, 4 mixed</PRE>
<P>     The town of Blaine, Missouri, was a mistake from the very
beginning when pioneer Blaine Fabin overestimated the distance he had
brought his party and assumed they had reached California.  The
residents of this town appear to have over-estimated their
accomplishments ever since.  The town, famous for its footstools has
dubbed itself the Stool Capital of America.  As the town approaches its
sesquicentennial it is planning for a celebration large by Blaine
standards, capped by a play telling of major events of the history of
Blaine in a musical pageant called "Red, White, and Blaine."  The
production is to be put in the hands of the multi-untalented auteur
Corky St. Claire (played by Christopher Guest who also co-authored,
directed, and wrote some of the music for the film).  The stars of the
show are the town's myopic dentist (Eugene Levy), the town's two travel
agents (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), the cute waitress from the
Dairy Queen (Parker Posey), and the town hunk (Matt Keeslar).  Corky is
temperamental and has the same over-estimation of his own abilities
that seems nearly universal in Blaine.  The only person in town who
seems to have any taste at all is the tightly wound music teacher who
leads the band in too small a part for Bob Balaban.  The film has
repeated gags on the ego and vulgarity of the town residents, but for
the most part the characters are more caricatures than believable
people.  WAITING FOR GUFFMAN might be more impressive if it was not so
similar in approach to the wonderfully-observed SMILE, directed by
Dennis Ritchie.  In that film, which tells the behind-the-scenes story
of a California town's hosting of a teenage beauty pageant, the
characters seem considerably more real and are at the same time a lot
more funny with often-caustic humor.</P>
<P>     Christopher Guest has written the meatiest role for himself as the
fey director and only at times has the talent to carry the film.  Guest
previously co-wrote THIS IS SPINAL TAP, but his most creative film was
THE BIG PICTURE, a particularly insightful lampoon of the Hollywood
film-making process.  Perhaps this film's most memorable image is
Guest's odd little improvisational stomach dance, done wearing his
pants backwards.  When the Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers proposed
making the film AIRPLANE!, the studio wanted to cast the film with
well-known comic actors in the major roles.  The filmmakers very
intelligently held out to get a set of actors not associated with
comedy and the film was all the more funny as a result.  Guest would
have been well-advised to follow a similar policy since one has already
seen over- the-top comedy performances by Levy, Willard, and O'Hara.
Their characters needed an air of authenticity and credibility that
these actors simply lack.</P>
<P>     WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is certainly worth a viewing for the parts
that do work, but afterwards, for a real treat, rent SMILE and see what
can really be done with a lampoon of a small town and its icons.  In
this film there certainly are at least three good laughs and no slow
portions, so WAITING FOR GUFFMAN does work as a comedy but it never
works well.  I rate it a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
