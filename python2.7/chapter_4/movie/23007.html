A film review by Steve Rhodes

RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"Executions 'R Us" could read the business card of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.,
the engrossing subject of Errol Morris's latest documentary, MR. DEATH:
THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A.  LEUCHTER JR.</P>
<P>Morris (FAST, CHEAP, AND OUT OF CONTROL) has an incredible gift for
finding unusual subjects that is exceeded only by his talent for
mesmerizing filmmaking.  His camerawork choices are both beautiful and
insightful.  And he manages to find humor without ever resorting to
cheap shots and to make the potentially repugnant absolutely riveting.</P>
<P>In a film with two distinct but seamless parts, Morris presents us with
the life of engineer Leuchter.  Since his father worked at a prison, the
young Leuchter visited him at work and became friends with the inmates.
Through this he developed an interest in prisons, specifically
executions.  "I was very concerned about the humanitarian aspects of
death by torture," Leuchter explains.</P>
<P>Before Leuchter came along, electric chairs were generally built by
inmates or electricians, not based on any blueprint or design but on
seeing a picture of some other state's old electric chair.  This led to
some pretty horrific executions when the chair did not serve its
intended purpose of putting a person to death as quickly and as
painlessly as possible.</P>
<P>"I am a proponent of capital punishment," Leuchter tell us.  "I am not a
proponent of capital torture." A weird guy, described as "a mouse of a
man," he drinks 40 cups of coffee and smokes 6 packs of cigarettes every
day.  He is as sincere as he is delusional about the limits of his
expertise.</P>
<P>With his big geeky glasses with thick lenses, he'd fit right in as a
Silicon Valley engineer, the type who thinks he knows everything since
he's had success in one area.  After becoming well known for his high
quality electric chairs, other states start asking him to build their
death machines, even if they involve poison gas, hanging or lethal
injection -- all areas about which Leuchter knows almost nothing, which
he initially finds amusing.  The fame quickly goes to his head, and he
gets a deluded sense of his scientific abilities</P>
<P>The second half of the picture concerns his downfall, when he is asked
to testify at a Canadian trial of a Holocaust denier.  During a
surreptitious visit to Auschwitz, he makes a few ill-conceived
experiments and declares that no one died there from poison gas.  The
movie is at it's most convincing when it easily disproves Leuchter's
disproof of the annihilation of the Jews.</P>
<P>Going from very modest fame and fortune to oblivion, he is not able to
get his reputation back.  His descent proves more rapid than his ascent.
"He wasn't putting his name on the line because he had no name," one man
explains about Leuchter's trial testimony.  "He came from nowhere and he
went back to nowhere."</P>
<P>Morris's gripping film tells a fascinating story of a little man who let
his accomplishments inflate his ego until it burst.</P>
<P>MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER JR. runs a fast 1:31.
It is rated PG-13 for mature themes and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
