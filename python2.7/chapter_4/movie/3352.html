<P>     Winner of four 1994 Cesar awards (best picture, best director, best 
screenplay, and best female newcomer), WILD REEDS beat out such big-name, 
high-budget productions as QUEEN MARGOT.  Originally commissioned by 
French television, but first released theatrically, this story of four 
youths struggling with the pressures of becoming adults in 1962 France 
presents an honest look at all the angst and uncertainty of finding 
oneself. </P>
<P>     If WILD REEDS was just another coming-of-age story, it wouldn't be 
worth more than a cursory glance.  However, Andre Techine's semi-
autobiographical look back at his final year in boarding school possesses 
more depth and realism than many similar films.  Nostalgia does not tint 
this narrative with its warm sepia tones.  Essentially a character study 
of the four corners of a romantic quadrangle, WILD REEDS examines 
adolescence from the point-of-view of those who feel themselves to be 
"outsiders," and shows that while the political and social climate may 
affect a person's development, other factors--such as friendship and 
love--are often more dominant. </P>
<P>     WILD REEDS takes place around the time that the Evian Agreements 
ratified the independence of the Algerian people.  The Algerian war, as 
devastating to France as Vietnam was to the United States, has ended, and 
the nation is facing a time of national reflection and identity 
rebuilding.   </P>
<P>     Maite (Elodie Bouchez) is the only girl in the group of four.  
Descended from a Spanish family (her last name is Alvarez), she's the 
daughter of the school's French teacher.  She is also a devout Communist, 
at a time when Communism is in vogue.  Fiercely loyal to her beliefs and 
hopelessly in love with the intellectual Francois (Gael Morel), Maite is 
nevertheless frightened of a sexual relationship.  Not that one is likely 
with Francois in any case, since he's in the process of recognizing and 
coping with his homosexuality.  An experimental relationship with Serge 
(Stephane Rideau) confirms Francois' beliefs, but Serge views their 
coupling as a moment of experimentation best forgotten.  Francois, 
however, is unwilling to give up his newfound friend/lover, but Serge is 
more interested in pursuing Maite. </P>
<P>     Into this mix comes Henri (Frederic Gorny), a twenty-one year old, 
intellectual French national expelled from Algeria.  Branded a fascist by 
Maite, Henri arrives steeped in bitterness and anger at just about 
everyone and everything.  Gradually, through patience and effort, 
Francois breaks through Henri's facade.  But it is the tempestuous 
relationship that develops between Henri and Maite that leads to one of 
the film's defining moments. </P>
<P>     WILD REEDS is one of those movies that tells a story about simple 
events in the lives of normal people.  Nothing spectacular happens here.  
The pace is quite deliberate and occasionally a little slow.  Director 
Techine simply will not be hurried.  Little details and character 
interaction make this film worth viewing.  These are the kinds of people 
you get to understand and care about over the course of one-hundred ten 
minutes. </P>
<P>     Emotions often seem richer and more intense in character-based 
dramas, and that's the case in WILD REEDS.  There's a sense of immediacy 
about every new sensation and feeling.  Credit for this should be divided 
equally among script, direction, and performances--all four of which 
are turned in by relative newcomers.  Elodie Bouchez, winner of the best 
female newcomer Cesar, deserves special mention for bringing an extra 
measure of life to Maite. </P>
<P>     Ultimately, WILD REEDS works because it remains steadfastly true to 
itself.  This may sound trite, but consider how many movies go for facile 
resolutions to satisfy the so-called "masses."  All the relationships in 
this film, no matter how deeply-felt, are ephemeral, and presented as 
such.  This is a slice of life with an imperfect beginning and 
conclusion, but what transpires between those two endpoints is strong 
enough to leave an impression on anyone with the patience to commit to a 
movie of such unhurried temperament. </P>
