<PRE>Fretless in Vienna
The Red Violin</PRE>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"The Red Violin" is really a composition in five movements. Although the
primary theme (the violin) ties all the segments together, it is but a thin
string.</P>
<P>The violin has a history five centuries long, and five separate tales of
it's existence are shown. Starting in Italy, but roaming (no pun) to several
other countries. Each story is savory and delicately filmed. But they don't
sing in harmony with one another, nor do they build for a crashing
crescendo.</P>
<P>Still, it's a curious piece that held my interest and stirred my heart with
beautiful music.</P>
<P>Starring Jason Flemyng, Greta Scacchi, Don McKellar and Samuel L. Jackson.
Directed by Francois Girard. Produced at Lions Gate/Red Violin/Sidecar/TV
Srl/Mikado.</P>
<P>Grade ......................................... B+</P>
