<P>*SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!*
The following review contains many spoilers to the movie, if you have not
seen this movie (what are you waiting for?) and do plan to see  it in the
future, please stop here.  </P>
<P>Early 1950s, Los Angeles, a setting that repeatedly draws writers' and
filmmakers' fascination since the days of film noir.  The story of "L.A.
Confidential" is centered around three police officers, however, is not
really a noir, contrary to the claim of many critics.  It is not about a
simple twist of fate turning an ordinary man into a criminal, or a femme
fatale plotting an evil scheme.  It's a crime drama with a lot of brain
and blood, filled with suspense and surprise -- the result, a wonderfully
crafted piece of work.  </P>
<P>Lieutenant Edmund Jennings Exley (played by Guy Pearce) joined the police
force to follow his father, a highly decorated policeman killed in the
line of duty.  He quickly gains everyone's despise for snitching on his
fellow officers about "The Bloody Christmas" incidence -- a bunch of
drunken policemen beating up Mexican prisoners.  Among his haters is
Detective Wendell "Bud" White (played by Russell Crowe), a well-known
strongarmed man who is feared by all wife-beaters in the city.  The third
protagonist is Sergant Jack Vincennes (played by the always lovable Kevin
Spacey), a celebrity cop on the narcotic division who likes to bust
drug-sniffing actors and actresses and works as a "technical advisor" on
the police TV show "Badge of Honor."  He loves the spotlight and being on
the cover of "Hush-Hush" magazine, a gossip tabloid run by Sid Hudgens
(played by Danny DeVito).  </P>
<P>The central mistery is "The Nite Owl Massecre" in which 6 people are
slaughtered, including Bud White's partner Dick Stansland and a girl who
look like Rita Haworth.  Exley, White and Spacey start on different
tracks, all become somhow involved into this case and form an unlikely
alliance to solve it.  In the process, we have a handful of puzzling and
messy clues including 3 black young man and a gang rape, some pornographic
pcitures, call girls who are cut like movie stars and entertain the rich
and powerful of "the city of fallen angles" and a suave businessman who
run this ring of prostitution, Pierce Patchett (played by David
Strathairn), plus a romance between Bud White and a prostitute Lynn
Bracken who looks like Veronica Lake.  In the middle of all this is the
riddling Captain Dudley Smith (played by James Cromwell) who favors
violence as the basic means of solving crimes and is constantly trying to
recruit White into his "extracurricular activities" often set in Victory
Motel.  </P>
<P>The spirit of this film is deeply cynical, with conspiracy upon
conspiracy, and corruption of city officials closely knit with organized
criminals and Hollywood showbiz and tabloid journalism.  Police brutality
is encouraged in LAPD and coverups are routine.  It is the same city of
sins as that in Darshiell Hammet and Raymond Chandler's novels --
glamorous, filthy, decadent, corrupt and fascinating, with plenty of
shadowed spots hiding the evil. </P>
<P>The original James Ellroy's novel of the same title is an incredibly
complex mass of murders, conspiracies, crimes and the darkest secrets of
human minds.  It is virtually impossible to adapt it straight from the
book, so writer Helgeland and Hanson come up with their own story line
that is equally complex and make perfect sense, but more effective and
comprehensible in a 2-hour movie, while saving all the goodies from the
book -- blocks of intense scenes, tasty dialogues, brutal actions and,
most of all, complicated, shady characters.  They also create several
twists of their own that rival the novel, eg. the amusing Lana Turner
scene and the good-cop-badd-cop interrogation of D.A. Ellis Lowe, and the
extremely original treatment of the death of Jack Vincennes that is
more clever than the book. </P>
<P>Although the plot of "L.A. Confidential" is satisfyingly complex as any
good mystery/crime thriller with plenty of twists and surprises, the best
thing about it is no doubt the characters and the acting performances.  It
is mind-boggling how they picked the two young Australian actors -- Crowe
and Pearce to play the leads and fit in with such perfection.  Sporting a
squeaky-clean American accent, they are exactly how White and Exley should
look and act like and feel like.  In the mean time, the writers should be
credited for being so fearless to maintain the serious flaws in the
characters, flaws that are not decorative and easily forgivable as they
often are in the usual heroes in most police/crime dramas.  The flaws do
not function to juice up the characters, but to present truly ambiguous
and fascinating ones. </P>
<P>Russell Crowe's Bud White seems to be just another tough cop who does not
hesitate to use a bit force to rough up criminals and bad guys.  His
violent tendency is hard for us to overlook and deeply troubling.
Gradually we learn of the origin of this problem and his hatred for men
who abuse women.  He is a man carrying an emnormous emotional baggage that
he's lucky for maintaining his sanity (although sometimes he doesn't look
that sane really).  Crowe's rugged good look and uninhibited tenderness at
times make White irresistable, especially to female viewers, despite the
dark side of him.  It is a passionate performance that's radient with
intense physical and emotional appeal.  </P>
<P>Ed Exley appears to be the straight arrow in the beginning, but the first
30 minutes of the film quickly reveals to us that he is not the
by-the-book college boy type we anticipate as a contrast to the explosive
Bud White.  He is intelligent, calculating and ruthless, ready to squash
anyone that gets in the way of his advancement.  With the cold eyes behind
the rimless spectacles and the occasional sly half-smile, Guy Pearce hits
the role with the precision that Exley would be proud of.  It is difficult
to like Exley as a character, which makes his transformation even more
interesting.  What drives his transformation is the undying conscience
that urges him to put aside his ambition and pursue the true justice.  </P>
<P>Conscience is also the key factor to change Jack Vincennes, who is corrupt
and sleazy at first.  This is the character most detached from the novel,
given a different personality and aura, perfected by the marvelous Kevin
Spacey.  He presents this celebrity cop with his cat-like grace,
irresistable smile and sheer confidence, and a couple of priceless moments
in which he shows internal conflict by nothing but the look on his face.
It is impossile for me not to adore him as an actor.  </P>
<P>Two scenes have been considered out of characters -- Exley jumping Lynn
Bracken and White beating her for sleeping with Exley.  However, it made
perfect sense to me from the first viewing and seems evern more logical
the second time.  It is not immediately obvious but definately within
charaters.  Exley and White form an nice symmetrical image.  They are not
the exact opposite as "Lethal Weapon", but the balanced harmoneous
contrast that remind me of the symmetry in Chinese poetry.  Exley is not
the straight arrow when he kills 3 suspects, and White is not the
brainless thug when he does his own investigation on Nite Owl case and
manages to always stay one step ahead of Exley who considers himself
vastly superior and smarter than White.</P>
<P>The characters are the stongest elements of the film, and also the
weakness.  It would work better if the writer sacrefice a little time of
the plot and invest it into digging the characters.  We know Bud White's
motivation, but what is Exley and Vincennes's personal baggage?  I wish
the filmmakers explore it a little more than a quick explanation like
"Rolo Temasi".  As interesting and complicated as the plot is, it still
goes the conventional way to tell a crime-solving story and is not
terribly profound or deep other than the characters.  </P>
<P>The supporting cast are well above average, James Cromwell as Cptn. Dudley
Smith, Kim Basinger as the weathered prostitute, Danny DeVito as the
sleazy Sid Hudgens.  All adaquate and wonderful.  But the winners are the
three leading men, nailing their roles perfectly.  There could be no
better interpretation of Ellroy's shady and unlikely heroes. </P>
<P>The cinematography, art design and style are quite authentic, I suppose,
to the period of 1950s, but pale in comparison to Carl Franklin's smooth
"Devil in a Blue Dress".  Director Curtis Hanson delivers numerous tightly
paced and well executed scenes: eg. the 3-way interrogation  of the Nite
Owl suspects, White beating the woman he loves, naturalistic and
emotionless violence scenes.  And the final shootout at Victory Motel.
The grim anticipation of the two partners out-numbered by the villains,
the way they pump slugs into attackers' bellies, the bad guy surrending to
the approaching police and Exley shooting him in the back, all feel so
strongly like the finale of John Woo's "The Killer" minus the passion and
slo-mo.  </P>
<P>The first time I saw this film, the ending seems like a cop-out, pulling a
"Lethal Weapon 2" on the audience, as many other feel the same way.  It
may look better in the book, but not so convincing on screen.  The second
time really feels much better, much sadder, and more more grim as the look
on Exley's face as he look on with the lone burden on his conscience.  </P>
<P>I am a sucker for this genre movies as well as novels, but an even bigger
sucker for well-written and well-performed characters.  "L.A.
Confidential" satisfies both aspects of my appetite.  It is still the
unmatched best of 1997, a weak year in good movies.  I give it A-, the
only A in 97 films. </P>
