<P>     Deception -- how we are deceived by others and how we deceive
ourselves -- is the theme of "Eyes Wide Shut," a perplexing, chilling
and often surprisingly comic movie that could only have come from the
mind of the late Stanley Kubrick, a director who was always more
interested in challenging his audience than in pandering to it.</P>
<P>Though it casts Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a well-to-do couple
who've been married for nine years (which Cruise and Kidman in fact
are), this is neither a love story nor a docudrama about the private
lives of its stars. In fact, despite the advance hype, "Eyes" features
surprisingly little carnal contact between the two. That would have been
giving viewers something predictable; instead, "Eyes" confounds
expectations again and again.</P>
<P>So much of the movie is about the everyday illusions we create
and/or buy into that when its moments of truth arrive they're as bracing
as if you'd stepped out of a steaming shower straight into a winter
storm. The shocks go straight to the heart.</P>
<P>Set at Christmastime, a season in which presents and trees are
dressed up to conceal what they really are, "Eyes" follows Dr. Bill
Harford (Cruise) and his unemployed wife Alice (Kidman) through a couple
of tumultuous days and nights. Though they live a seemingly comfortable
life in a glorious apartment on New York's Central Park West, we can
sense from the very first scene a storm is about to rattle their little
paradise.</P>
<P>Bill and Alice have begun taking each other for granted -- instead
of looking he blandly tells her "you always look beautiful" when she
asks him what he thinks of her hair. At a party thrown by Bill's patient
Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack), a quietly troubled Alice pounds glasses
of champagne and teases a Eurotrashy type into spending much of the
evening on the dancefloor. Bill is almost picked up by a pair of
striking young women who promise to show him "what's at the end of the
rainbow."</P>
<P>Back at home, Alice ups the tension when she rolls a joint (she
tellingly keeps her stash inside a Band-Aid cannister) and tries to
knock down the invisible wall between them. What follows is a quirky
corkscrew of a conversation about human nature that ends with a
disturbing confession intended both to hurt and to haunt Bill, which it
does.</P>
<P>It's a powerhouse of a scene, played to absolute perfection by
Kidman, who has the smaller but far showier part in the story. Cruise,
in contrast, is in practically every scene of the movie but more often
as a low-key observer than as a participant. Though Bill is always
around, he's not often accessible.</P>
<P>Loneliness is the other undercurrent running through "Eyes." Bill
is forced to go off on his own to deal with his shattered ideals; a
woman (Marie Richardson) sits desperately by herself at the bedside of
her dead father; a hotel desk clerk (Alan Cumming) flirts with Bill in
the hopes of getting something started; a pianist (Todd Field) talks
about having left his family behind in Seattle.</P>
<P>Even when people do get together in Kubrick's sullen and dreary
world, it's not a happy sight, since it almost always involves some sort
of passionless, impersonal sex. A storeowner (Rade Sherbedgia) offers to
rent out his young daughter (Leelee Sobieski) as if she were part of his
inventory; a hooker (Vinessa Shaw) ropes in a client; costumed
participants in an elaborate ritual pair up for silent, anonymous
trysts. As Bill makes his way through New York, it becomes clear that
while cheap thrills are everywhere, fulfillment is hard to find.</P>
<P>Doubtless many viewers will be left dissatisfied by "Eyes" as well.
Like Martin Scorsese's "After Hours," another creepy and darkly funny
tale of a solitary man adrift in the Big Apple, this is not a movie
about likable, easily understood characters or conventional situations.
Instead Kubrick and co-screenwriter Frederic Raphael (sp?) have designed
"Eyes" as a tour of an emotionally barren Wonderland where people have
chic-sounding names like Nightingale and Domino, where first impressions
are almost always wrong and unpleasant realities are tucked away inside
glittering facades.
 Anyone who knows Kubrick's work will tell you the man was not in the
business of making crowd-pleasers, and "Eyes" is no exception to that
rule. But regardless of how you feel about it immediately afterward,
there's no denying the movie gets under the skin. In the same way a
feverish one-night-stand can leave you feeling confused, angry and still
strangely gratified, "Eyes" is a film with an impact that lingers long
after its finale. James Sanford</P>
