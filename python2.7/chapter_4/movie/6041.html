<PRE>                                GLORY DAZE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>     "Ever wonder whatever happens to the pampered rich kids the
liberal arts colleges turn out year after year?"  GLORY DAZE opens with
that question, but the answer they give is less than satisfying.  Rich
kids it seems are so enamored with their pointless partying and hanging
out, that they don't want to leave.  You, on the other hand, may want
to make a fast exit if you accidentally find yourself watching this
assemblage of cardboard characters.  This movie gives a new meaning to
the word boredom.</P>
<P>     Set in the lovely seaside college town of Santa Cruz, we have a
group of college seniors (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Vinnie DeRamus, Vien
Hong, and French Stewart) who live together in a rented house.
Actually Slosh (Vien Hong) has long since given up on college, but the
others are preparing to leave town after graduation until they decide
that they can not give up their male camaraderie.  They take an
unconvincing vow to stay together for another year.  Jack (Affleck)
says, "Let's rage at the dying of the light a little bit."  Continuing
in this stream of insightful thinking, he later tells us that, "People
say nothing is forever.  I say how do you explain herpes or The
Grateful Dead?"</P>
<P>     Decorating the guy's world are a group of women (Alyssa Milano,
Megan Ward, and others).  The guys are stick figures, but the women's
roles are worse - visual wallpaper.</P>
<P>     The writer of THE JERKY BOYS, Rich Wilkes, takes his first stab at
directing with this film, and he also wrote the script.  The film is so
bad that it borders on self-parody.  Some of the dialog is kind of cute
in the abstract but is leaden in this low energy and never believable
film.  Think of it as ANIMAL HOUSE ON VALIUM.</P>
<P>     As they line up for their graduation materials, the smart aleck
kid handing them out ridicules each student with individualized jokes.
"Psychology major right?  I love my mother, but not as much as you guys
think I do."</P>
<P>     Although the kids in the film spend time in class on such artistic
creations as a golden hand holding a CD, their professor seems to be
even more unbelievable.  Art Professor Luther (John Rhys-Davies who was
Sallah in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK) alternates between trying to seduce
his minions and providing cheap philosophy including: "It is poetry
that will save the world, not commerce," and "Art isn't just the
vomiting up of adolescent angst."</P>
<P>     Nothing, I repeat nothing, happens in the movie.  The picture
tries sometimes to be mildly offense by using gratuitous bad language
and constant drinking.  Their parties feature a guy with a funnel so he
can drink himself to death at a record pace.  Actually, the show is so
lame that it is not even effective at being offensive since these
scenes are all so false.</P>
<P>     In my least favorite sequence, the fascinating monologist and fair
actor Spalding Gray (MONSTER IN A BOX) plays Jack's father.  Jack's
parents are visiting the college to ridicule their son Jack for not
being on the fast track in life like them.  Jack rebels, "Mom, dad, you
both screwed up your lives.  Now back off and give me a chance to screw
up mine."  His dad tells him his liberal arts education is worthless
and to, "send me a postcard from skid row."</P>
<P>     The only character with any charisma is the shy cartoonist and
student Mickey (DeRamus), but his lines are pathetic.  When he finally
gets his putative girlfriend to his room, his come on line is, "I like
you - the kind of like you where I get to see you naked.  No more of
this palsie walsie stuff."</P>
<P>     At the end the movie attempts to come alive with a few shocks.
Dennis (Stewart) calls their actions, "Preservation through
destruction."  Like the rest of the picture it is predictable and an
unmitigated disaster.</P>
<P>     GLORY DAZE runs about an hour and a half, but will feel like an
eternity.  It was not yet rated when I saw it, but I suspect it will
get a PG-13 or an R.  There is no violence or sex, but there is a
little nudity and a fair amount of bad language.  The film should would
be acceptable for most teenagers although I am not fond of the message
it gives, but I strongly recommend that this miserable piece of film
making be avoided by all ages.  Only because it was more boring than
painful, do I give it 1/2 of a star.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
