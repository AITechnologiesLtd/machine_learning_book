<P>   Does America produce too much wealth, and do too many
Americans make too much money?  Of course not. 
Production and accumulation of wealth are not the problems. 
The issue is consumption--what we do to get that wealth and
what we do with the money we make.  Left-leaning critics of
the American way point to the manner the powerful U.S.
arrogates to itself the right to make decisions for other
countries (the Vietnam War as the principal example), to what
the country must do to continue extracting abundance from
both the land and its people (pollute the land, create ugly
malls, inundate the air waves with moronic commercials), to
the selfish attitude that prevents the world's mightiest nation
from considering the inequities of the income produced both
at home and abroad.</P>
<P>   A good deal of this reproach was reflected in the literature,
theater and movies of the 1970s, at the time that Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr. wrote "Breakfast of Champions" (1973) to
append his convictions to the political climate.  Antonioni's
"Zabriskie Point," which hit the screens in 1970, is a
foreigner's take on the aggressive, materialistic style of living,
a film written partly by Sam Shepard.  Stuart Hagmann's "The
Strawberry Statement," which came out as well that year,
treats the Columbia University riots, the sometimes violent
demonstrations by privileged kids against the allegedly racist
nature of the school's administration.</P>
<P>   The corruption that has accompanied American prosperity
has not gone away, though serious attempts have been tried
to make the distribution of income more equitable and to cut
back the destruction of the air, land and water.  Despite all
the shots we've taken, the air waves are still desecrated by
mindless commercials for inconsequential products, the span
between the higher earners and the poor is the greatest in
the industrialized world, and large corporations are drowning
small stores while downsizing workers and homogenizing the
cities and suburbs with tasteless malls.  Pointing out these
evils, "Breakfast of Champions," a novel considered by some
to be impossible to film, has been captured for the screen by
Alan Rudolph--a director noted for experimentation with indie
films like "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle," "Afterglow,"
and "Welcome to L.A."  Considering the absolutely non-
commercial nature of his "Breakfast with Champions," we can
imagine that its all-star cast must have taken far less than
their usual compensation for doing the movie, one which
comes across as so off-the-wall zany and surreal that its
targeted audience would have to be a small one indeed.  </P>
<P>   Aside from the difficulties you can expect from the
nonlinear narrative, aiming at targets not as a sharpshooter
would but as would a farmer firing a shotgun full of buckshot
flying hither and thither, "Breakfast" ridicules profanities too
familiar to be shocking in our own time as they were when
the novel was published.  Filmed by Elliot Davis as though
the genre were a Merry Melodies cartoon shot by John
Waters and not a genuine dispatch by live actors, "Breakfast
of Champions" centers on the bespectacled and toupeed
Dwayne Hoover (Bruce Willis), the principal celebrity of the
town of Midland City (filmed in Twin Falls, Idaho) by virtue of
his near monopoly of local TV commercials for his car
dealership.  "You can trust Dwayne Hoover," is his motto, an
obvious giveaway to a knowing movie audience for his
probable debauchery.  He is in the midst of a nervous
breakdown, wondering "who am I?" and about to eat his gun,
when he is called to the table by the maid for his breakfast of
champions--a large plate of fried eggs, bacon, pancakes,
potatoes and toast.  (Later in the film, the titled breakfast of
champions would become a martini.)  </P>
<P>   Because of his total attention to his dealership, he has
distanced himself from his depressed and suicidal wife, Celia
(Barbara Hershey) but is to be powerfully affected later on by
an aging, sardonic writer of sci-fi novels, Kilgore Trout (Albert
Finney--who is in some ways a stand-in for Mr. Vonnegut),
who travels to Midland City to receive an award during the
town's first arts festival.</P>
<P>   Every character in Alan Rudolph's land of plastic, polyester
and all-around schlock is nuts, and Rudolph must have had a
grand time characterizing Harry Le Sabre (Nick Nolte),
secretly a transvestite who dresses like a mortician during the
day to cover up his problem; Francine (Glenne Headly), who
works as Hoover's receptionist and pliable girl friend; and
Wayne Hoobler (Omar Epps), an ex-convict who looks up to
the materially successful Hoover as though the salesman
were the creator of the universe.  When the cranky Kilgore
Trout looks about him at the pretentiousness, the phoniness,
the polluted waters, the very sterility of the place, we do not
wonder that he envisions an alternate world, a tropical
paradise free from capitalism's messes, where he can
become young and innocent again.</P>
<P>   Rudolph certainly means well, having the grit to make this
movie from a novel whose criticisms of society are still valid
but whose shape is old-hat.  And the first-rate cast including
Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte, Glenne Headley, and Barbara
Hershey are to be honored for contributing to the effort at a
presumably lower pay scale that they would customarily
require.  But "Breakfast of Champions" is so chaotic that after
twenty minutes you can easily lose patience for its
scattershot arrangement and redundant reproaches.  For a
more sober approach to the issue, go back to the classics
and open Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt" (1922), about a man from
the twenties who likewise lived in a town of standardized
architecture and interior decorations who, for a time, was
reborn during a trip to Maine but who later fell back to his
habitually reactionary and insular ways.</P>
