<P>   Everyone knows the expression "Rich or poor, it's nice to
have money."  Now, "The Next Step" advances our
knowledge of life thusly: "Youthful or ancient, it's nice to be
young."  And, sad to say, maybe kids are right when they
think of a guy who has passed his 35th birthday as an old
man--but only if you have a career as a professional
basketball player or dancer.  "The Next Step" tells the tale of
a hoofer who leads quite a good life, at least while he has a
glamorous job.  He's making enough money to splurge at a
yuppie restaurant for Perrier champagne and best of all he
has his pick of great-looking women with whom he works. 
He's that rare specimen: a heterosexual male who faces little
competition for the heterosexual females in his particular
profession.</P>
<P>   "The Next Step" is a movie with an apt title about Nick
Mendez (Rick Negron) who has a live-in girl friend, Amy
(Kristin Moreu), a hormone-crazed woman-on-the-side, Heidi
(Denise Faye) and, later on, a lovely French Miss, Michelle
(Michelle Pertier) to add to his collection.  Amy, a former
dancer who now enjoys a career as a physical therapist,
seems clueless about her boy friend's peregrinations, but he's
taking flak from Heidi, who scornfully refers to Amy as Nick's
wife and pressures him to split and move in with her.  Nick's
world changes suddenly when his current gig in a Broadway
show closes and his agent, later his choreographer, shy away
from him: a man who, in his mid-thirties, is washed up.  But
Nick loves his job and is determined to gain a principal role in
a new musical about youthful gangs.  To cover himself
meanwhile he takes a restaurant job while anticipating a
series of auditions for the big musical, where he will pit his
experience against a more youthful group of aspirants.</P>
<P>   A large number in the cast of this picture are themselves
professional dancers and, in fact, the "aging" Rick Negron is
currently in the chorus of the big Broadway musical
"Ragtime."  As such, many performers do better on the dance
floor than in the acting department, but writer Aaron Reed has
peppered the movie with enough sharp dialogue and
humorous situations to keep this high-energy indie absorbing. 
Older members of the movie's audience will identify with the
geriatric couple who wander into a restaurant without realizing
that the place seems to have targeted the under-35 crowd. 
Asking for fish and salad and a well-done baked potato--no
oil, no anchovies, light on the spices--they provide a touch of
humor in a finely honed vignette, returning the undercooked
fish because they "didn't come here for sushi."  When Amy,
Nick's live-in companion, wants her man to move with her to
Fairfield, Heidi warns, "You go out to Connecticut, you're
gonna die a slow and painful death."  In another pithy slice of
life, Nick takes a job in an all-male strip bar and, when told by
fellow waiters that the real money is made after hours, he
encounters a disastrous situation with a middle-aged woman
who is shocked when asked for money.</P>
<P>   Donald Byrd provides the choreography in a movie that
recalls "A Chorus Line" and "All That Jazz," and Christian
Faber's direction is particularly impressive in two quick scenes
which involve Nick's imagination.</P>
<P>   "The Next Step" is a sexy comedy-drama about a man's
refusal to come to grips with reality, the penalty he pays for
compulsive womanizing, and his ultimate redemption.  When
Box Office, an online journal, reviewed the movie, its critic
held that the work "never leaps above 'All That Jazz'/ 'A
Chorus Line' cliches."  Now, "A Chorus Line" you can keep,
but "All that Jazz" was one terrific picture.  A reviewer can do
worse than to compare Faber's offering to Bob Fosse's 1979
show-stopper.  "The Next Step" focuses intensely on its lead
character, who turns in a sympathetic performance as a man
who faces what all of us must come to terms with some day.
Not Rated.  Running time: 96 minutes.  (C) Harvey Karten
