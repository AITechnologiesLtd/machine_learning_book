<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a lame coming-of-age film, yet Michael Corrente directs it with
great sympathy for the characters, taking a lighthearted approach to
some mild rebellion going on in the mid '70s, contrasting the lifestyles
of both working-class and upper-class students. It comes to the
'startling' conclusion that rich kids might do the same bad things
working-class kids do, but get away with it because their money gives
them privileges.</P>
<P>The film plays as if it's a slogan for "stupid pride." A self-satisfied
morality play about bigotry and personal ethics seems to be where it is
going, as a pot-smoking teen, Tim Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), from a
blue-collar environment in Pawtucket, which is just outside Providence,
gets into trouble with the law after his car smashes into a parked
police car while he is high and it is arranged with a mobster friend of
his dad's, to get the help of the judge trying his case, so that he goes
to the elite Cornwall prep school in Connecticut instead of to jail.</P>
<P>To emphasize how dumb the kid is, when asked in the prep school class
who his favorite author is, he says Hamlet. He sticks out in this snooty
environment like a sore thumb, wearing a dungaree jacket with an
American flag on his back instead of the  traditional blazer, and
instead of luggage, he arrives with a garbage bag full of his clothes.</P>
<P>Old man Dunphy (Alec Baldwin), a bellicose single parent of two boys,
plays poker with his reactionary lowbrow friends as they rail against
the Jews and homosexuals while boozing it up, they even try to figure
out if Rock Hudson is queer. Meanwhile, right under his nose, his son
hangs out with a bunch of slackers, with the irrepressible Drugs Delaney
(Jon Abrahams) doing an imitation of how a stoned-out freak talks and
acts. Tim's younger brother Jackie (Tommy Bone) is wheelchair-bound, who
is used as a prop for some flippant one-liners by his family and
friends, as he is cut no slack for his physical condition. He enjoys
hanging out with his older brother's druggie friends and listening to
them sound each other out, and is supposedly being taught a valuable
lesson in life: not to have self-pity. To show that the family is really
a caring one, the family pet is a three-legged mutt, who sports an
eyepatch.</P>
<P>At the school, he meets all the stock characters you would expect in
such a formulaic film. There is the rich, pretty, popular,
down-to-earth, smart girl who has poise and class, Jane Weston (Amy
Smart). She will smoke pot and have a sweet non-sexual relationship with
him, become accepted to Brown University and help persuade the
disinterested student to study hard enough so that he could at least
graduate and go to a junior college. There is, of course, the film's
ogre, who is the school disciplinarian, Mr. Funderberk (Crowe), who will
pick on all of Dunph's friends (he's called that by his friends, his
father affectionately calls him Dildo).</P>
<P>School life for Dunph falls into the routine of smoking weed, playing
hockey, getting into minor trouble, and then trying to get out of
trouble.</P>
<P>The students were all predictable one-dimensional characters: there is
the nerd Irving (Ferver), who is looking for respect. Wheeler (Gabriel
Mann) is the sneaky student who rats out his friends to get the dean's
recommendation to Yale. The other students Dunph hangs out with are all
the ones who smoke pot like his friends back home, but do it in a more
sophisticated way. Better bongs.</P>
<P>There are two events in this story that have an impact on Dunph: his
mother committed suicide and his father never told him why, as he
eventually bonds with his gruff father after he graduates and learns in
a heart-to-heart talk that his father loves him very much in his own
way. He also learns that his mother was mentally ill. In the second
event, Dunph invites Jane to his dorm room, and he's caught smoking pot
there by Funderberk. The dull scene that follows plays like typical
sitcom trauma, as the innocent Jane is expelled and thereby Brown
University declines to accept her. In the silliness that goes for either
comedy or dramatics, which wasn't funny or enlightening, just stupid and
incredible, Dunph goes to the Brown University dean and pleads for Jane
to be taken back, supposedly proving that he learned something about
personal responsibility at the prep school.</P>
<P>The poker players also ease up in their bigotry and let a gay card
player (George Wendt) back in the game (this phony story contrivance was
just absurd). The problem with all these resolutions were that all the
characters were clichés, no one's character was fleshed out, and this
film based loosely on Peter Farrelly's life, never got untracked. The
story might have been a heartfelt one for the author, who is the
co-director with his brother Bobby of  "There's Something About Mary,"
but it had little impact on film and was very much underwritten. There
was just no story to get into which was worth getting into, nor were any
of the characters in the least bit interesting. Everything and everybody
was trivialized with the purpose to force some comedy out of their
characters, but the comedy never came about naturally. It all seemed
like a futile effort to catch something about class status that had
already been caught in a better light by recent films like "Rushmore "
and "Slums of Beverly Hills."</P>
