<P>"Something... something happened, didn't it?"</P>
<P>So suggests Ruth Barron at the end of "Holy Smoke", and she's right -- 
something has happened. I'm just not sure what. Here is a movie that promises 
to be a drama about two passionate people waging intellectual war on each 
other, but disintegrates into a bizarre mixture of "Ticket to Heaven", "Last 
Tango in Paris", "Klute" and "Coneheads".</P>
<P>The early scenes glimpse Ruth (Kate Winslet), a young Australian woman, 
vacationing in India. Back home her parents are informed that she has joined 
some sort of religious cult. They go beserk; this is not a sophisticated or 
open-minded family. Their house is in worse shape than their caravan. The 
patriarch, Gilbert (Tim Robertson), flaunts a hairpiece, fake tan and bulging 
belly. Mother Miriam (Julie Hamilton) has weird mood swings and runs around 
wincing. The grown-up kids burp, fart, groan and attend tacky theme nights at 
pubs.</P>
<P>Given that she's grown up around these boors, it's hardly surprising Ruth 
wants to escape into an alternative lifestyle. So the family lure her back to 
Oz with cruel lies about dying relatives, and then arrange for her to meet 
with an American "exit counsellor", P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel). The guy has 
a great track record, having convinced almost two hundred people to leave 
clandestine sects.</P>
<P>P.J. takes Ruth to an isolated shack. It is agreed that they will talk for 
three days. "You're never gonna break me," Ruth insists. "You're right," 
responds P.J. "Your own reason should break you." There is real tension 
onscreen at this point, because Winslet and Keitel are intelligent actors who 
don't avoid each other's gazes. Even when their characters are refusing to 
talk, we see them seething, and trust that when they finally do argue their 
conversations will set the screen ablaze.</P>
<P>Unfortunately there never really is much opening up about the issues at hand, 
or reasons for the characters' beliefs. Ruth does not even tell us what she 
thinks she's learned in India, so we can never judge whether she has been 
taken in by a sinister cult or simply found solace in a peaceful commune. 
"Holy Smoke" therefore lacks context -- is Ruth's indignation to P.J. 
something we're supposed to cheer or pity?</P>
<P>I haven't even hinted at the film's more bizarre reaches. One is the 
portrayal of Ruth's family, which goes so over the top it undermines the 
drama, by painting its members as a bunch of giggling, snorting animals who 
express their feelings through twitching and raised voices. Then there's Ruth 
and P.J.'s fourth day in the hut, in which both characters lose their reserve 
in favour of violence, sex and mind games. "Holy Smoke" begins with important 
discussion, follows it by poking fun at rural lifestyles and ends with Harvey 
Keitel wearing a dress and trying to break people's noses. What's going on? 
Answers on a postcard please.</P>
