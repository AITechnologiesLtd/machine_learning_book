<P>   When writers satirize people and institutions, they do not
necessarily despise what they are sending up.  Though Ben
Jonson took serious jabs at humanity in "Volpone" calling
human beings jackals and worse, some parodists can barely
hide their affection for their targets.  Take David Mamet for
example.  In 1989 he had his "Speed-the-Plow" staged on
Broadway starring Joe Mantegna, Ron Silver and Madonna in
what looked like a devasting skewer of Hollywood, but the
hilarity of the script gave away his fondness for things L.A.  In
"State and Main," a milder sendup of the movie business,
Mamet mellows in Preston Sturges territory, lampooning
politics, the advertising business, sex and
hero-worship--particularly the ways that the movie industry
manipulates the objects of his barely hidden affection.</P>
<P>   Preston Sturges's "The Great McGinty" and "Sullivan's
Travels" which propelled that writer-director into a meteoric, if
brief, success, might be the very films that inspired Mamet
this time around.  "The Great McGinty," released in 1940,
deals with a bum who is manipulated into the governor's chair
by a crooked political machine but who blows it all when he
decides to become honest.  "Sullivan's Travels," released a
year later, deals with a "fluff" director who decides to do a
serious film by researching the subject in the real world. </P>
<P>   In "State and Main" by comparison, Walt Price (played by
Mamet regular William H. Macy), is intent on directing a
serious piece by photographing on location in small-town
America, only to find that the company affects the residents
of the sleepy village more than the burg impacts on the
filmmaker.  Sending up both Hollywood and hamlet, "State
and Main" gains its unusually quiet and lovable humor by
focussing on oddball relationships between bizarre members
of his crew and idiosyncratic denizens of Waterford, Vermont
(actually Manchester, Massachusetts).  Handsome leading
man Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) gets into hot water yet
again by his penchant for 14-year-olds (in this case for Carla
Taylor, played by Julia Stiles). The leading lady, Claire
Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker), decides at the last moment
that she will not bare her breasts despite her contractual
agreement to do so.  Producer Marty Rosen (David Paymer)
is pitted against an avaricious politician, Doug MacKenzie
(Clark Gregg).  Best of all, a stuttering scripter, Joseph
Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) enjoys an eccentric
romance with a whimsical bookstore owner, Ann (Rebecca
Pidgeon).</P>
<P>   Virtually missing this time around is David Mamet's bent for
clipped speech, which he utilized to our great pleasure in
"House of Games" and even more powerfully in his best
work, "Glengarry Glen Ross."  Also bypassed is the writer-
director's typical harshness, putting "State and Main" more in
line with the ambiance of Mamet's Chekhov adaptation,
"Vanya on 42nd St" than with the rueful attack on political
correctness, "Olenna."  But the prolific 53-year-old writer's
current offering is a welcome respite from his usual cynicism. 
When he tempts a grasping, anti-Semitic politician with a
bribe, or invites an odd couple (the writer and the bookseller)
to enjoy a spontaneous romance; when he displays the ways
that a whole town can be amiably corrupted by the allure of
celebrities; and when in a Capra-esque homage, he gives a
man the choice of being honest at the risk of his career or
bearing false witness with the hope of a blockbuster calling--
he allows us to explore human folly with grins and chuckles
instead of knives and cudgels.  </P>
<P>   The remarkable Philip Seymour Hoffman is the show
stealer, giving a nuanced impersonation of a man whose
difficulty with spontaneous communication belies his genius
with a typewriter.  His liaison with the town's amateur
theatrics director (played with lovable technique by Ms.
Pidgeon) is a romance of the authentic sort we do not often
get to see on the screen.  The one line that draws belly
laughs from the audience--a jab at the American electoral
process--is so current, so precisely out of today's headlines
about the Gore-Bush battles--that we could swear that Mamet
had just injected that dialogue into this congenial film.</P>
