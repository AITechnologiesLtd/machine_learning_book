<P>     Perhaps Disney should take a lesson from writer/director Dale 
Rosenbloom regarding how to make a family film.  SHILOH, Rosenbloom's 
first foray into the field of family entertainment, easily outclasses 
any live-action movie the Mouseketeers have released in the last three 
or four years.  Here are some Disney staples that SHILOH has managed to 
avoid:  plastic characters, ogre-like adults afflicted with terminal 
stupidity, moronic humor, pointless action sequences, and a nauseating 
overdose of cuteness.</P>
<P>     Rosenbloom has remembered something that Disney has forgotten:  the 
key to fashioning good family entertainment is to make the movie 
enjoyable to everyone in the family, not just the five and six-year 
olds.  Any adult who has suffered through the likes of 101 DALMATIANS 
(live action), JUNGLE 2 JUNGLE, and THAT DARN CAT! will appreciate what 
Rosenbloom has wrought with this low-key, thoughtful motion picture.  He 
takes the time and effort to develop real, imperfect characters rather 
than recycling familiar types.  </P>
<P>     I have never been a big fan of "animal in danger" tales, but SHILOH 
is far better than most.  Not only does it show the animal, a one-year 
old beagle, being abused (although not graphically), but it doesn't turn 
the dog into some sort of living cartoon character.  Likewise, the young 
protagonist, 11 year old Marty Preston (Blake Heron), doesn't have all 
the answers and isn't constantly outsmarting his parents.  And the 
film's villain, Judd Travers (Scott Wilson), isn't just inherently evil 
-- there's a legitimate reason why he's so nasty, as Marty comes to find 
out during the movie's second half.</P>
<P>     SHILOH takes place in the tiny town of Friendly, West Virginia.  
It's a lazy summer and Marty is wandering around town looking for odd 
jobs to earn a little cash.  On his way home one day, he encounters a 
beagle with a cut over its eye.  It follows him, and Marty, a loner by 
nature, develops an immediate attachment to the injured animal.  He even 
gives it a name -- Shiloh -- after the bridge where he encountered it.  
His father (Michael Moriarty) recognizes Shiloh as the new hunting dog 
of the reclusive Judd Travers, and Marty reluctantly agrees to return 
it, even though he suspects Judd of mistreating the animal.  Several 
days later, Shiloh again runs away from Judd, and this time, when the 
dog seeks him out, Marty decides not to tell his parents.  So, with the 
help of his friend Samantha (J. Madison Wright), he hides the beagle in 
a fort and sneaks food to it every night.  But it's only a matter of 
time before someone else learns his secret.</P>
<P>     The strength of SHILOH is that it approaches its subject matter 
intelligently.  There are no easy answers to Marty's dilemma -- the Law 
is on Judd's side, but the boy believes his position is morally 
defensible.  At one point, when his father accuses him of not doing the 
right thing, Marty's response is a simple question:  "What's right?"  
Later, the kindhearted town doctor (played by Rod Steiger) tells him 
that if he wants to keep Shiloh, he may be forced to fight for the dog.</P>
<P>     The adults in SHILOH are not one-dimensional.  Marty's dad, despite 
being somewhat domineering and old-fashioned, understands his son's 
affection for Shiloh, and, to a degree, is willing to support him.  
Likewise, Mrs. Preston (Ann Dowd) is developed into more than a 
sympathetic maternal figure lurking in the background.  Everyone, from a 
veteran like Rod Steiger to a newcomer like Blake Heron, gives a 
heartfelt and believable performance.</P>
<P>     SHILOH, which is adapted from a Newberry Award winning book, fits 
nicely into the class of better animal-related family films, joining the 
ranks of LASSIE and BLACK BEAUTY.  And, while the primary target 
audience is undeniably children, few adults who sit through this motion 
picture will wish they had done otherwise.  SHILOH represents something 
that's all too rare at theaters these days:  a pleasant surprise.</P>
