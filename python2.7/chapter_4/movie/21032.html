<PRE>The Limey
Directed by:  Steven Soderbergh
Starring: Terence Stamp, Lesley Ann Warren, Luis Guzman,
Barry Newman, Peter Fonda
Running time:  90 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ****</PRE>
<P>Wilson (Stamp) is a career criminal who learns his
daughter Jenny has died while he was in prison.  He goes to
Los Angeles to learn the details of her death.  He contacts
the man who wrote to him (Guzman in a great supporting role),
a woman who befriended her (Warren) and finds her lover
Terry Valentine (Fonda).  He suspects Valentine was involved
in the car accident that killed Jenny.  Valentine is a music
producer with a bodyguard (Newman) who seems to know a lot
of lowlifes.  Valentine does not want to meet Wilson.  Wilson
is not the kind of man who takes rejection well.</P>
<P>What follows is a revenge drama with Wilson working his way
through a series of obstacles until he can have his highnoon
style showdown with Valentine.  There is lots of violence and
a little humour.  Stamp gives a restrained performance that some
might see as too laid back.  Fonda has a surprisingly small
role that he performs well in.  The supporting cast is strong.
The directorial technique of constant flashbacks and flashforwards
and fantasy scenes gets boring quickly.</P>
<P>Soderbergh made Sex, Lies and Videotape, Kafka, and Out of Sight.
That list should make it clear he is not a director trapped
in a formula.  I made the mistake of expecting this film
to be similar to Out of Sight.  It's not.  The emotional
intensity of that film is completely lacking here.  No one
steams up the screen in The Limey the way Clooney and Lopez
did.  But that's not what Soderbergh is going for here.  I
won't call this film an unqualified success - you never
make an emotional connection to any of the characters - but it
does work and is worth seeing.</P>
