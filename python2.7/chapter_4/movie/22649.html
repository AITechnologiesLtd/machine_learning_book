<P>Director Ron Shelton apparently likes the sports. He started off strong with
the baseball angle in BULL DURHAM (7.5/10). Followed that one up with an ode
to basketball and buddies in WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP (7/10). And recently
re-teamed with the star of his first film, Kevin Costner, in the golf
romance TIN CUP (6.5/10). Do you see a ratings pattern here, folks? His most
recent effort, which has to do with boxing, might finally give Mr. Shelton
the blow to the head that he needs to try another genre of filmmaking.
8-9-10...Knockout!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Two washed-up boxing buddies get the chance of a lifetime when a crooked,
obnoxious fight promoter offers them $50,000 apiece to haul ass down to
Vegas in 24 hours and fight each another. The duo accept but only if their
contract stipulates that the winner of the fight will get a real title shot
afterwards.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
"Something was missing" was the first thing that crossed my mind as I
ushered my way out of the movie theatre after seeing this movie. Some
elements were there, like the decent buddy-to-buddy repartee, the manly
humor, the woman caught between two men who love her, the ever-present
soundtrack, and yes, even some boxing, but "something" was simply amiss. I
didn't care too much for the characters, I didn't laugh too much at their
jokes, I didn't even care so much as to who ended up with the girl or who
won the boxing match for that matter. In the end, all I was left with was
essentially a "road film" with a little bit of boxing tossed in at the end.
The actors were all good, with Harrelson and Banderas providing some decent
chemistry, Lucy Liu sexing it all up, and Dadidovich, well, okay, I guess
they could have cast someone a little better for her role. She just looked
their mom in some scenes! Oh well. All in all, the film swooped by at an
even pace with just enough interest for me to stay tuned for the big fight.
Unfortunately, the actual moment of truth fizzled in my eyes and the
conclusion of the film just left me feeling indifferent at best.</P>
<P>I don't remember director Shelton ever pulling a symbolic ending over on us
before, but this film, and especially the, what kind only be described as,
"strange" boxing match, left much to be desired. I was looking forward to a
fun, hard-fought, exciting scrap between the two friends, but instead I was
left tickling my brain petals trying to figure out what some of the weird
imagery meant. Also, the fight itself was too repetitive, and way over the
top in respect to one particular aspect (I don't like to ruin actual details
of a film in my reviews, but hopefully you'll get my drift if you see the
movie). Overall, I would most likely recommend this movie as a rental for
sure, but if you are planning to see it on the big screen, I would suggest
it only to those who are huge fans of any of its stars. All boxing fans
should immediately drop their smelling salts and remain seated cause this is
definitely not the big boxing movie that you've all been waiting for.
Seventy percent of the film actually takes place on the road, and the boxing
scenes are just bizarre and monotonous. In the end, the movie made me laugh
hard a couple of times, smile once here and there, and shrug my shoulders
when it was all said and done. And save for one particularly cool movie star
cameo during the final boxing match, even the other celebrity appearances
were simply ho-hum. Rod Stewart?!? C'mon!!</P>
<P>Love it or leave it, the one good thing that we do come away with from this
movie is the realization that one of these two men clearly stands above the
other in at least one respect. And yes, hands down, the shower scene finally
confirms the fact that Woody Harrelson's ass can beat Antonio's any day!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Tom Sizemore credits actor Robert DeNiro with turning his life around during
the filming of the 1998 TV program "Witness to the Mob", in which he
portrayed mobster John Gotti (DeNiro executive produced the project). DeNiro
apparently showed up on his doorstep with Tom's mother and told him to
either enter rehabilitation in an Arizona center or he was going to have him
arrested for heroin usage.
Antonia Banderas' full name is José Antonio Domínguez Banderas.
Woody Harrelson's full name is Woodrow Tracy Harrelson. Woody provides the
narration voice on the 1999 documentary entitled GRASS. He recently married
his longtime girlfriend, and former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has
two daughters. Woody also spends his spare time as the lead singer of the
band Manly Moondog and the Three Kool Hats. He was once married to
playwright Neil Simon's daughter Nancy for one year.
I guess director Ron Shelton must have a "thing" for Lolita Davidovich,
since other than this film and the previously mentioned "sports movies", Ron
has directed two other flicks, BLAZE and COBB, both of which also star
Davidovich. Lolita originally hails from Toronto, Canada.
This film is actually Ron Shelton's second attempt at the "boxing film", the
first that he directed. In 1996, he was co-writer on the film THE GREAT
WHITE HYPE starring Sam Jackson and Peter Berg.
This film was originally titled PLAY IT.</P>
