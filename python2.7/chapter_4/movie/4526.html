<PRE>               A film review by Marie Niemec</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Marie Niemec</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:  Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Madeleine Stowe
DIRECTOR: Terry Gilliam
Rating: 2 stars out of 5</PRE>
<P>     If you've seen the trailers or commercials, it's rather difficult to
really figure out what this movie has in store.  Well, it's hard to tell
after watching the movie as well.  </P>
<P>Bruce Willis is a resident of the future, and it is a rather bleak
future.  The world's population had disintigrated into a mere 200,000 and
is no longer ruled by humans but animals.  The reason?  In 1995, an
organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with
a pure virus, thus wiping out practically the world's population in a mere
month.  Bruce Willis' character is one of the surviving few, but is
enslaved by scientists, as are most of last living humans.  They barter his
freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate
task: Go into the past, find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys, and
kill him.</P>
<P>Well, this explanation didn't come easy.  Although the movie is very
thought provoking of us as a people, our future and the evilo in the world,
as a story it is very confusing.  And dragging.  I know a movie isn''t
keeping my interest when I fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my
watch only to find that it's only been an hour passed.  Terry Gilliam has a
certain style that I realize many appreciate, and I haven't watched his
previous work Brazil, but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and
yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure
out, you wish it were more complex, and not to mention that the movie is
depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me.  </P>
