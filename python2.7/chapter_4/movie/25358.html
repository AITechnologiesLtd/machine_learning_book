<PRE>                                 LOSER
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     If you're a cynic, you might wonder when Amy Heckerling (director
of the utterly vapid Clueless) lost touch with the youth of America. 
I'm inclined to believe it was in 1982, right after the release of Fast
Times at Ridgemont High, her only good movie, which she made when she
was only 28.</P>
<P>     Now in her mid-40's, it's rather depressing to see Heckerling using
the same jokes that worked almost two decades ago.  And for a movie that
uses "Dare to be different" as its tagline, it's almost pathetic that
this story is lifted virtually verbatim from Fast Times, with the Mark
Ratner-Stacy Hamilton romance going awry once again.  Brian Backer, who
starred as Ratner, is even back in a small role.</P>
<P>     With American Pie alums Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari, Loser spins a
story of a vaguely Midwestern, er, loser named Paul, who moves to New
York to attend a vaguely NYU-like school on full scholarship.  Instantly
loathed for not being a philistine, Paul finds himself attracted to a
nice yet vaguely Goth girl named Dora that sits next to him in English
Lit.  The only catch is that she's having an affair with the professor
(Greg Kinnear).</P>
<P>     Ultimately, Loser is your standard love triangle movie, tweaked to
try and appeal to the coveted teen audience.  This is half-successful,
and Biggs and Suvari carry enough innate charm to make you laugh
plenty.  A boatload of comedian cameos from Steven Wright to Taylor
Negron livens things up as well.</P>
<P>     But the story -- and the comedy -- falls flat on the whole.  There
is no doubt from the second the characters are introduced how things are
going to end, right down to the "What happens to..." text that tells you
how miserable all the bad guys end up and how happy our heroes are.  See
also Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  On top of this, the movie is just
plain sloppy.  Direction and editing are lackluster at best, and the
film feels like it was tossed together in a week.  Kinnear deserves
special acclaim for managing to undo years of turning himself into a
respectable actor with movies like As Good As It Gets, diving back into
sitcom stereotypes with his overbearing professor role.</P>
<P>     Amazingly, Loser is one of very few recent movies that draws power
from its soundtrack, chock full of mid-to-late 1990's hits (examples:
"No Myth," "Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)") that Heckerling must have
gotten in an MTV compilation disc.  Good tunes, all of them.  Which
means: if you find yourself bored between jokes on the screen, you can
close your eyes and listen to the music.</P>
