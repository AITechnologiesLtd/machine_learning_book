<PRE>                                     CONGO
                           A film review by Brian Lehr
                            Copyright 1995 Brian Lehr</PRE>
<P>     Um ... what? Being the sucker for Michael Crichton that I am, I
rushed out to see this on the opening weekend, much as did with BATMAN
FOREVER the following week.  Unfortunately, this film isn't even in the
same league with the Caped Crusader.</P>
<P>     As the movie starts off with a guy finding his friend's eyeball
and then getting killed hinself, the "predictable" suspense just keeps
on coming.  People turn around slowly in fright and then scream so many
times it gets laughable (or in the least, downright boring.  If the
fake gorrila suits don't turn you off, the fake actors should.  I
understand using "nobodys" (except for Tim Curry; love the accent), I
mean ... it worked with JURASSIC PARK.  But as with BATMAN, JURASSIC
PARK towers above this ... not in plot structure or deeper meaning, but
in basic entertainment of the audience.  Frankly put, I didn't enjoy
this movie, no matter how hard I tried, and I have been known to enjoy
many a film despite its lack of plot, etc. (take ACE VENTURA, PET
DETECTIVE).  But you'd think for what is supposed to be a big-money
film they could have gotten better sets than something you might see at
Disneyland.  The cinematography is good, with great shots of the
jungle.  But when we land back on earth for more bad acting and cheesy
lines, you can tell we're in a set again.</P>
<P>     CONGO sacrifices any point and goes for the quick kill, hoping the
scary apes will freak the doubts out of us.  With most of us, that
shouldn't work ... I never found myself truly concerned or frightened
by this movie.  A little startled, perhaps, like you are when a car
backfires, but nothing that stays with you like velociraptors jumping
in your face.  And after a while, even that ran out, as the @*%^#ing
annoying mechanical voice of the main ape's mechanical arm got to me.
She (the ape) looked bored too, not even trying to do sign language,
just hitting her chest in the same way every time, perhaps thinking
"Duh!  This movie is insulting even my intelligence!  Duh!"</P>
<P>     For those of you who have read the book, and just *have* to see
the movie, go ahead; it's your money.  But let me also forewarn you
that CONGO goes on a no-holds-barred charge full speed backward from
the book.  Characters are changed and plots are lost.  But as movie
makers grab hold of certain authors, and then their books, we must be
prepared for stinkers such as CONGO.  And the public doesn't help,
considering the amount of $ CONGO grabbed at the first-weekend box
office because fools like Yours Truly went and saw it before I looked
at the reviews.  In fact, by now we should probably expect them.</P>
<P>     This movie squeezed a reluctant 1.5 (*1/2) apes out of me, mostly
because of a good scene with Ernie Hudson in an airport (one of the
*few* good scenes). "Run man, run!"  Do that when you see this movie.</P>
