<P>        Groupies, take heed: Marrying a musician may ultimately
benefit your lawyer more than it will you. That's the message of ``Why
Do Fools Fall In Love?''  about the three-way battle for the estate of
singer Frankie Lymon, who died at the age of 25 in 1968 from a heroin
overdose.</P>
<P>  In his wake, Lymon left behind a trio of women all claiming
to be his legitimate widow: Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), a singer with
the Platters; Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox), a good girl gone
wrong; and Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon), a strait-laced schoolteacher
from Georgia. Certainly, considering what each lady had to put up with
while being around the former teen idol, each was entitled to some
kind of monetary compensation.</P>
<P>  The picture ``Fools'' paints of Lymon is woefully incomplete
- writer Tina Andrews can't seem to put her finger on exactly what led
to Lymon's heroin addiction, for instance - but what's shown is
unflattering and sad.  An overnight success with his racially mixed
group The Teenagers in the late 1950s, the sweet-voiced Lymon fell out
of favor with the public almost as quickly, thanks to his forbidden
dance with a white girl on national TV and his ill-fated attempt to go
solo. Like many teen idols, he was effectively washed-up before age
20.</P>
<P>  In what can only be read as an attempt to spice up his
otherwise dreary life, Lymon first romanced Taylor, then married
Waters before setting his sights on wholesome Eagle. All were won over
by Lymon's charm and attentiveness. Taylor and Waters would later
suffer greatly for their association with him. While Lymon once sang
``I'm Not A Juvenile Delinquent,'' offstage he was a junkie, a thief
and a user.</P>
<P>  Berry, Rochon and Fox are all far more believable as young
women than they are in the sequences set in the mid-1980s in which
director Gregory Nava allows each to ham it up disconcertingly. As
Lymon, Larenz Tate capably handles a difficult character whose
behavior ranges from beguiling to bizarre, but the true highlight of
the cast is the incomparable Little Richard, playing himself with
panache.</P>
<P>  ``Fools'' turns up the occasional insight into how this
irresponsible man wormed his way into the hearts of three very
different women, but more often than not Andrews' screenplay can't
decide if it's a cautionary tale about the perils of marrying a
has-been or a rowdy ``you go, girl'' celebration of sisterhood. The
movie's timeline is pitifully tangled from the very start, when Waters
hears Diana Ross' ``new'' cover of the Lymon-penned ``Why Do Fools
Fall In Love?'' in 1985 - four years after the record went gold. In a
scene set in 1964, Waters and Lymon listen to Otis Redding's ``Try A
Little Tenderness'' on the radio; an astonishing feat considering the
song wasn't recorded until 1966.</P>
<P>  When it comes to recreating the Alan Freed rock-n-roll shows
of the 1950s and the deliciously tacky go-go look of TV's
``Hullabaloo,'' the movie scores. But the courtroom battle that forms
the dramatic centerpiece of the film is not exactly a nail-biter; it's
a clear case of ``Smart-Mouthed Women, Foolish Choices.''</P>
