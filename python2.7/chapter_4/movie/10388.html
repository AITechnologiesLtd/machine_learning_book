<PRE>                                  AMISTAD</PRE>
<P>Steven Spielberg knows how to tell a story that is at once gripping
and enlightening.  Here he turns his attention to the year 1839 when
the Amistad uprising took place on the high seas.   A Spanish ship
is taking slaves from a Havana slave market to somewhere else in
Cuba.  Conditions below deck where the prisoners are held are
unbelievably horrible.  When the captors discover they have
insufficient food for all their slaves, they tie some of the
most ill and debilitated  to the anchor cable and drop it overboard
where all attached to the cable drown.</P>
<P>The movie tells us many strange things of which we may have been
unaware. We know that the God-fearing people of the South saw
nothing wrong with enslaving other humans, ripping their families
apart and destroying their culture. It was just that point that made
me wonder at Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), the leader of the fateful
uprising, who did not remark when shown in a Bible pictures of
Jesus,  including the walking on the water, "Where was He when my
people were being drowned?"   How could he say that while the slaves
were treated badly, "others" had apparently suffered worse.    As I
do not recall that in the book on which the film was based, I wonder
why that was inserted in the film?</P>
<P>The film is filled with heartbreaking emotion.  The anchor incident
mentioned is one of them.   The scene of Cinque's wife and family
back in Africa; the capture and enslavement by other black Africans
is fearful viewing.</P>
<P>Attempting to help the slaves who are on trial for murder of some of
their captives is Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) who, at first
approaches the trial (with 7 of the judges slave-holders!)  as a
trial of humanity, only to discover that he can win only if it is
shown as a matter of property.   Were the captors legally justified
in shipping someone else's property?    He is aided by a couple of
abolitionists: Joadson, a former slave himself (Morgan Freeman in a
comparatively small role) and Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard), an
immigrant.</P>
<P>Prominent in the film is Martin Van Buren as a weasel who would sell
his soul to get re-elected.   At the opposite end is  the most
powerful performance  given by Anthony Hopkins in the role of  John
Quincy Adams addressing the court for some dozen spellbinding
minutes.    Now, THERE is an actor!</P>
