<P>Es tu, Arny? What the heck happened to these guys after the late 80s, early
90s? Remember when Sly, Arny and Bruce ruled the box-office? Well, Bruce is
actually still kickin' some mighty tail, but Arny has gone "soft" and
doesn't want to be seen blowing away a zillion guys with one machine gun
anymore. Of course, his newfound morality is commendable, but it doesn't
appear as though he has completely made up his mind just yet. Both END OF
DAYS and this film seem to be hinting at this so-called "new" Arnold, but in
the end, they just give us the same "old" Arnold, but with much less
fire-power and oomph. The result? Well, in the case of both of these
films...pretty lackluster.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Set sometime in the near future, this film features a world in which cloning
your dead pets minutes after they pass on is considered normal. Human
cloning, on the other hand, is forbidden, but do you think that will stop
the rich evil guy and the unethical doctor from having some fun of their
own? Not a chance! Unfortunately for them, one of the dudes on whom they
decide to test their brand of fun is named Arnold Schwarzenegger (in real
life, that is). And yup, you guessed it...Arny is not happy about having
another "man" take over his life.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A really great premise, some cool futuristic doodads in the first half hour
and a surprisingly strong humor element don't make up for this film's cheesy
production value, stereotypical bad guys, weak score and lack of energy in
the second half. Not exactly sure what went wrong here but I was really
enjoying this movie during its first thirty minutes or so. There were plenty
of cool technological gadgeteries presented, a nice setup for the whole
cloning scenario and one of the creepiest "dolls" to ever see the day of
light (her name is Sim-Pal Suzie and trust me...you won't ever forget her).
Even Arnold seemed to be back to his old self. Delivering goofy lines, being
that burly nice guy husband we all love so much and setting us up for some
good ol' fashioned cloning fun. But the bottom seemed to drop out of this
film at around the halfway point. It's as if they didn't have enough budget
and decided to place everyone in one building and have them run around
playing laser tag. And how annoying were those laser guns and repetitive
scene transitions? Plenty, but not as bad at the obvious blue screen used in
some of the later helicopter stunts. I mean, c'mon people, is this a
Hollywood movie or a phony baloney TV production set to the big screen? Not
enough gloss, not enough punch, not enough of much.</P>
<P>And I'm really kinda pissed about it all because the film did actually seem
to have quite a bit of potential. It's a great subject for a movie, one that
actually manages to spark several cool moments throughout, but too much
talking and not enough interesting developments in the story ultimately
stunt the film's growth. Arny was pretty good as his character(s) but the
film never really seemed to emit any sense of impending doom. Maybe it was
because the characters weren't that well developed. Maybe it was because the
bad guys were so cheesy (red and blue hair, people...c'mon...get with the
program!), or maybe it was because the film didn't look that believable
after its gratifying start. Whatever it was, it certainly didn't prevent me
from enjoying enough of the film to recommend it just slightly, especially
to Arny fans. But there is no revolutionary sci-fi flick in here, folks.
Just another dud to add to the long list of sub-mediocre sci-fi movies
plaguing the industry this year. But I did enjoy this film's many funny
lines (and yes, Arny even says "I might be back" at some point), its cool
techno fun stuff early on and its intriguing proposition. Sadly, it is in
its execution that this film ultimately fails. Video fodder for sure, but
nothing more than that. I do however look forward to a real good cloning
movie in the future. In the meantime, I'm gonna go out and rent TOTAL RECALL
again. Now there's a great sci-fi flick!</P>
<P>Oh yeah, and if you're looking for an "action" movie, this one doesn't fit
that bill either. Unless of course, you consider laser tag gun games
"action". And where was this clone fight between Arnold and himself that I
had heard so much about? Hmmmm...wasn't in our copy.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Director Roger Spottiswoode is probably best known for directing James Bond
in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Which made people forget about him directing STOP OR
MY MOM WILL SHOOT! and TURNER AND HOOCH. He used to be married to actor Jack
Palance's daughter, but they divorced in 1997.
Screenwriters Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley are man and wife.
This film was originally titled ON THE SIXTH DAY.</P>
