<P>  I've heard said that young people don't give much of a fig
for stories anymore. What they want to see on the screen is
special effects along with their explosions and car crashes--
which accounts for box office takes  for "The Cell," "Vertical
Limit," and "Proof of Life."  If they can't get special effects or
explosions, then give the principal target audience lots of
visuals, actions galore to keep their minds distracted from the
fact that the movie has no plot worth thinking about. 
"Snatch," written and directed by Guy Ritchie--who gave us
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" but does not
consider this a sequel--is mayhem posing as hip; motion
aspiring to chic.  While this bit of convuluted,
disconnected mayhem may simply be the sort of thing I just
don't "get," I suspect that "Snatch" is the picture that will be
praised by people who are eager to patronize the lovers of
story lines--the folks they consider plain too old-fashioned to
go for postmodern gibberish.</P>
<P>   While we may be tempted to think that the title is a double
entendre, "Snatch" seems to refer exclusively to the aim of
some London and NY underworld characters to seize an 83-
carat diamond, but this is no "Topkapi" by a long shot.  The
diamond caper takes a backseat to some almost
incomprehensible activities executed by a cast doing
uninteresting things with the one exception of a pit bull which
is instrumental to the yarn--and that dog doesn't even get a
credit.  </P>
<P>   The commotion begins when a quartet of diamond bandits
disguised as Hasidim including Franky Four Fingers (Benicio
Del Toro) rip off a wholesale jeweler to deliver the 83 carat
diamond to Franky's employer, Avi (Dennis Farina).  Franky,
a compulsive gambler, bets with the Russian Boris The Blade
(Rade Serbedjija) on an illegal boxing bout, unaware that he
is being set up for a robbery at the hands of Vinny (Robbie
Gee), Sol (Lennie James), and Tyrone (Ade).  (Ade, the
getaway driver, is so fat that he can barely get out of the
getaway car...that's the level of humor you'll find in various
parts of the movie.)  Turkish (Jason Statham) hooks up with
top criminal and pig farm owner (the pigs are used to eat
bodies, thereby disposing of evidence) Brick Top (Alan Ford)
to fix a fight, but Mikey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), an Irish gypsy who
speaks an almost impenetrable language, refuses to take a
fall and knocks out all opponents.</P>
<P>   The one catchy visual in this picture can be missed if you
blink and will remind cineastes of a similar run-through of
sorts in "Requiem for a Dream."  Avi, the only attractive and
interesting human being in the movie, catches a Concorde to
London: Ritchie shows the entire booking, the flight and the
movement through British passport control in four seconds.</P>
<P>  Though the violence is largely an illusion, instances of solid
editing by Jon Harris, the suggestion is as brutal as that
found in "Fight Club," including the mostly off-screen poking
of a caged pit bull and the sending of a couple of killer dogs
after a frightened rabbit for sport.  The film is about a
succession of double crosses, indicating that there really is
no honesty among thieves and rascals, but to get back to my
theory, I think the film will be used by the chic set to look
down on fuddy-duddies who prefer movies to have a point.</P>
