<PRE>                                GRIDLOCK'D
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     GRIDLOCK'D is a seemingly low budget film that covers the same
ground as TRAINSPOTTING, but not as imaginatively.  Both films are
comedies about heroin addicts.  Almost all critics, but not this one,
loved TRAINSPOTTING.  The main claim to fame for GRIDLOCK'D is that it
stars the murdered rap singer Tupac Shakur.  The picture is the
directorial and screenwriting debut of the actor Vondie Curtis-Hall
(Captain Prince in the recent ROMEO AND JULIET), who also plays the
part of the major bad guy, D-Reper.</P>
<P>     After Cookie (played by Thandie Newton who was the star of
FLIRTING) has a drug overdose and appears on the verge of death, Spoon
(Shakur) decides to give up drugs.  He even coerces his friend Stretch
(Tim Roth) to give up drugs too.</P>
<P>     The premise of the show is a Kafkaesque tale of their inability to
fight through the bureaucracy to get on Medicaid so they can get into a
drug detox center.  After they sell a non-existent camcorder to
D-Reper, the parallel plot in the show has D-Reper and his henchman
(Tom Towles) trying to kill Spoon and Stretch.</P>
<P>     As they have trouble getting their Medicaid cards, they enjoy many
a pleasurable moment shooting heroin up their arms.  The show never
made me believe for a minute that these guys had any intention of
giving up something that sent them into such ecstasy.  Spoon, for
example, talks in glowing terms about "his first time" -- to shoot up
that is.  "It was like going back to the womb," he dreamily describes
it.  "It was peace."</P>
<P>     I did believe that they were finding the government rules to be an
infinite maze and government workers to be lazy and uncaring.  Of
course, that Stretch would scream and cuss them out probably did not
motivate the clerks whose help they needed.  My favorite scene in the
entire film has one clerk using their own language back at them to tell
them off.</P>
<P>     Although highly derivative, many of the scenes are funny.  One
features a blind Vietnam vet (Howard Hesseman) with a dog named Nixon.
He trashes a social services office and accidentally provides the cover
for our protagonists to make a fast exit from the law.</P>
<P>     Too much of the film is one long chase scene.  At least we do get
the great director and sometime actor John Sayles in a cameo role as
"Cop # 1."</P>
<PRE>     I liked the film better than I thought I would, but still it is
not much of movie.</PRE>
<P>     GRIDLOCK'D runs 1:31.  It is rated R for frequent hard drug usage
of various forms, for violence, for lots of profanity and for nudity.
I do not think the picture is appropriate for teenagers.  Personally,
I would have rated the film NC-17.  I laughed some, but can not
recommend the movie.  I give it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
