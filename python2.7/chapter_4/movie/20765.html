<PRE>American Beauty
(Review By Pat Canavan)</PRE>
<P>    It's the tenth month of the year,  and one has to be wondering when a 
film worthy to be nominated for best picture will be released.  It wasn't 
like this last year,  when "Saving Private Ryan" had been released in the 
summer,  and set the standard for the Oscar rush pics of November and 
December to live up to.  A truly exceptional drama had not been released 
until now,  and like "Ryan," "American Beauty" is the film that others will 
have to overcome in order to become the new favorite for best picture.</P>
<P>Although the film boasts several unique and absorbing characters,  it is 
essentially driven by Kevin Spacey's smooth portrayal of Lester Burnham,  a 
42-year-old suburbanite going through a severe mid-life crisis.  He is 
saddened at what his life has become,  but conveys his unhappiness with a 
cool sardonic tone that is echoed throughout the film.  We first see him in 
the shower masturbating.  "This is the high-point of my day," he tells us.  
"It's a downward spiral from this point on."</P>
<P>A similarly sharp Annette Benning plays Lester's wife Carolyn,  an overly 
ambitious workaholic,  whom Lester believes has forgotten who she once was,  
and has now become a phony.  "See the way the handle on those pruning shears 
matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident," Lester scathingly 
remarks.  </P>
<P>Among the many things disturbing is the relationship the two have with 
their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch,  who plays a role very similar to 
that of Christina Ricci in "The Ice Storm," and even looks like her).  Their 
everyday dialogue has deteriorated into hi's and hello's,  and when Jane 
catches her dad leering at her friend,  her disgust and antipathy towards him 
begins to ferment.  She can't stop talking about what a loser she thinks he 
is,  and even speaks of how she could do without his pathetic existence.  </P>
<P>It is obvious that both parents hardly spend enough of their attention on 
Jane.  Carolyn becomes interested in a rival real estate salesman,  whom she 
idealizes for his success,  and seems to represent the same way Carolyn has 
lost her genuineness when he tells he that the key to success is always 
reflecting an image of success.  Lester turns his attention to Jane's 
self-absorbed best friend,  whom he can easily picture himself sexually 
involved with.</P>
<P>Jane tries to turn her attention away from her parents,  and she begins 
to focus on her new next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) whom she 
discovers videotaping her every move.  "I'm not obsessing,  just curious," he 
explains to her,  who is somewhat annoyed but relishes in the attention.  The 
Fitts family is even more of a paragon of dysfunction than the Burnham 
family.  Allison Janney is Ricky's vapid mom,  who barely communicates a 
change in facial expression to either Ricky,  or his authoritarian father (an 
excellently hard Chris Cooper).</P>
<P>The feel closely resembles Ang Lee's 1997 critical success and commercial 
failure "The Ice Storm," (even the score is similar) although this plot is 
much thicker and the Alan Ball's screenplay is much more comical.  First time 
director Sam Mendes,  who brought the same sexual charge to his production of 
"The Blue Room," could be in line for an Oscar,  and wouldn't it be a 
surprise if a DreamWorks director other than Speilberg won the award.  In 
fact,  there is only one thing standing in the way of a deserved sweep at the 
Oscars,  and isn't it ironic that it is the same thing that led to "The Ice 
Storm" getting snubbed: the controversial themes (especially homosexuality 
and sex amongst teenagers) are hardly looked highly upon by the conservative 
Academy.</P>
<P>It doesn't matter though,  how many awards the film racks up,  or its 
rank among the best films of the nineties.  In a year where the best made 
films seem to be teenage comedies ("Election," "American Pie," "Go"),  a 
drama so phenomenal as "American Beauty," is well worth the wait.</P>
