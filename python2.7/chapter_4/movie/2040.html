<PRE>                                RISING SUN
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<P>     RISING SUN does for Japanese businessmen what THE FIRM did for
American lawyers.  However, it didn't do much for me.  I mean, it's not
a *bad* film or anything--it's sufficiently stylish and the
performances are decent, kinda like THE FIRM in that respect (another
film based on a best-selling novel).  But there's nothing particularly
*special* about it.  And when all is said and done, it goes on way too
long.</P>
<P>     What it *does* have going for it is bullet-proof casting,
especially of its two leads, Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes.</P>
<P>     LAPD special services liaison Web Smith (Snipes) is called in to
investigate a homicide at the grand opening of the Nakamoto
Corporation's multi-million dollar skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles.
Connery plays Detective John Connor, a mysterious figure knowledgeable
in Japanese relations, who's lured out of semi-retirement to assist
him.  Snipes plays reluctant *kohai* (junior partner) to Connery's
*sempai* (guide), and the two of them hit the ground running, forming a
congenial on-screen rapport.</P>
<P>     Hampered by negative attitudes towards the Japanese on all sides,
Connor and Smith become embroiled in a murder investigation where the
sale of advanced technology to one of the United States' biggest
competitors becomes a central theme.  There's plenty of
finger-pointing--at an easily-influenced U.S. senator, a yuppie
facilitator, and a smooth, winsome playboy to name but a few--but by
the end of RISING SUN, it's not totally clear whodunit.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem with RISING SUN is that we never get to know
the woman who's body is found on the boardroom table--she's bumped off
pretty early on.  Okay, so she's just a pawn, a call girl, but the film
could have been more interesting had we known
something--anything--about her.</P>
<P>     "Get this body out of here before it starts smelling like sushi!"
yells insensitive police officer Tom Graham (Harvey Keitel).  It's one
of many dumb sushi jokes, and another lather-rinse-repeat performance
from Keitel. Here he's cast as a bigoted bad lieutenant with a penchant
for a little Japan-bashing of his own.  He's played this kind of role a
hundred times before but if he hadn't, he wouldn't be so good at it.
Anyone who can steal a scene from Connery *and* Snipes can't be too
shabby.  On a rant about racism, Graham rails "Whatever happened to
good and evil?  Whatever happened to '*He* did it'?"  This guy's
xenophobic blusterings are laughable, and Keitel's performance is one
of the few pleasures of RISING SUN.</P>
<P>     Tia Carrere (WAYNE'S WORLD) plays Jingo Asakuma, a genius hacker
who helps unravel the mystery on her computer.  Although she looks
great in all that black spandex, the scenes of her manipulating videoed
images of the murder are repetitive and not particularly enlightening.
There are hints that her character is more interesting than her late
night, desktop activities would imply, but these are never developed.</P>
<P>     The film is badly in need of an editor.  There are too many scenes
that go nowhere and one, in which Connor and Smith are chased into the
'hood, is superfluous (and as an attempt at role-reversal humor,
embarrassing beyond belief).  And everything culminates in an awkward
final scene between Smith and Asakuma that makes you wanna scream
"Cut!"</P>
<P>     Director Philip Kaufman (THE RIGHT STUFF, THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS
OF BEING) has taken Michael Crichton's politically-charged novel about
corporate and cultural intrigue within the Japanese-American business
world and de-sensitized it, turning it into a slick yet pedestrian
thriller.  RISING SUN has been called a cautionary tale by many, but
Kaufman's overly diplomatic approach to this material is itself too
cautious, robbing the volatile story of its fire and passion.  His
intent may have been to downplay the tensions between two world super
powers, but RISING SUN is a long way from cultural detente.</P>
