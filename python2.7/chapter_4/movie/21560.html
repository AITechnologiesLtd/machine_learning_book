<P>"What was broken up here doesn't get put back together again."</P>
<P>This is Al Pacino speaking as "60 Minutes" segment producer Lowell Bergman 
in Michael Mann's new "The Insider."  What he's talking about is the serious 
consequences that go down when politics and greed assault integrity.  What 
we see is a well-paced portrait of investigative journalists, and of the 
effects of decisions:  some of them easy and some of them wrenching.</P>
<P>The content here doesn't fit the mold of the American suspense movie.  There 
are no serial killers or occult goings-on.  There are not even any car 
chases.  But in a similar way that "All the President's Men" functioned as 
an expose of Washington politics surrounding the 1972 election, "The 
Insider" functions as an eye-opener to mid-1990's capitalistic depravity.  
Mann has chosen much different fare here than he covered in his superior 
period drama "The Last of the Mohicans";  his success, though, is every bit 
as certain.</P>
<P>Lowell Bergman is a top-of-the-line producer.  The film's opening sequences 
take place in a country very much like Iran, where Bergman and a crew member 
are blindfolded and driven to meet with a Hezbollah leader.  Will the sheik 
trust the reputation of "60 Minutes" and, specifically, of its 78 year-old 
icon, Mike Wallace?  Yes.  We watch as the interview is staged a couple of 
days later, and Wallace gets in the face of a ranting disciple of the 
sheik's.  Wallace's first question is "Are you a terrorist?  No beating 
around the bush with Wallace, of course, and Bergman is one of the main 
preservers of this dogged honesty.</P>
<P>Enter Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, a scientist formerly employed by health companies 
like Johnson and Johnson, but who until recently made a lot of money by 
selling his services to a major tobacco company.  It seems Wigand has been 
terminated rather suddenly.  That he doesn't tell his wife immediately about 
losing his job displays his emotional unevenness, a behavioral pattern that 
surfaces several times.   Wigand's wife seems most concerned with losing the 
money for the house payments and the for health benefits that assist with 
their elder daughter's asthma.</P>
<P>So how does Wigand meet up with Bergman?  As a corporate executive and 
respected scientist, Wigand is called upon to interpret some dirt about the 
Phillip Morris Company that someone dropped in Bergman's lap.  Although this 
piece work does not surface again, we are introduced to some real dirt, a 
crisis of Wigand's conscience that affects all of American public health.  
Simply said, Wigand cannot make up his mind to reveal or keep confidential 
the fact that cigarettes are a delivery device for nicotine.  Worse, tobacco 
companies are enhancing the power of the nicotine by adding chemicals that 
enable the addictive substance to pass more easily from the lungs to the 
brain.  Wigand's big problem is that part of his severance package is 
signing an addendum to his confidentiality agreement.  Because of this, he 
cannot communicate any information about his research, as this research is 
owned by the company.</P>
<P>Circumstances happen that push Wigand to fess up.  It seems he is being 
followed and even harrassed at his home - at the modest rancher he and his 
wife and young daughters occupied after moving out of their mansion.  
Bergman gets Wigand a role in a lawsuit being brought by the state of 
Mississippi again the tobacco industry;  the reasoning is that a deposition 
under oath will make the information public record and let Wigand sidestep 
his confidentiality pact.  The complications surrounding this dilemma are 
what Mann concerns himself with exploring.</P>
<P>>From the start we sense an edgy tone, the camera catching odd venues, the 
shot slowing down while the score goes to discordant jazz.  Mann has a knack 
akin to a good fiction writer's for keeping a narrative engaging, almost 
jumpy.  Again, considering the premise for the film does not carry with it 
the possibility for much physical action, Mann does an amazing job with 
editing and pacing.  The result is a story with several dimensions.  There's 
the story of Wigand's degeneration, tracing his separation from his family 
and his struggle to start a new career as a teacher of high school chemistry 
and Japanese.  Will he defy a Kentucky court order and offer his damning 
deposition?  What's equally riveting is the conflict among the makers of "60 
Minutes," the legal arm of CBS, and various other media - such as the "New 
York Times" - about whether Wigand's words and face should be aired.</P>
<P>As Jeffrey Wigand, Russell Crowe is masterful.  He carries about him a hint 
of quiet impotence, a rage against all the players of the game, Big Tobacco, 
the FBI, "60 Minutes" and Lowell Bergman himself.  Apparently Crow gained 
some weight for the role, and the result is a meaty middle-aged man who 
wants desperately to be a good father and husband, a man of science who let 
himself be drawn just a little too deeply into the financial and moral 
morass stirred up by the marketing culture of cigarette peddlers.  For 
Crowe, look for a nomination for best actor in a supporting role.</P>
<P>As Mike Wallace, Christopher Plummer is perfect.  His is an American accent 
and an American aggressiveness.  Smart and compassionate, he is nevertheless 
ruthless when it comes to getting a story.  In every scene he's in, Plummer 
shows his experience and wisdom about the subtlest of actions.</P>
<P>Viewers should make no mistake:  this is Al Pacino's movie.  It opens and 
closes with him in our sights, and enables him to display his intense 
talents in almost every scene.  The best part of his performance has him 
depicting moral ambivalence.  He takes it personally when he's accused of 
betraying sources, and does all he can to expose the tactics taken by the 
tobacco company to smear Dr. Wigand.  Surprisingly, he's not even about to 
kowtow to the great and powerful Wallace.  In role after role, Pacino takes 
his task seriously; here he helps to bring out the dramatic aspects in this 
important, factual narrative.</P>
<P>One weakness lies in the story's failure to put faces behind the people 
harassing Wigand.  We see a muscular man in a business suit, hitting golf 
balls and pausing to watch the scientist.  And there are the boot prints in 
the tomato patch that was worked by Wigand and his girls.  Okay, we know 
it's important to include the threats Wigand experienced, but the most 
compelling ones come from identifiable perpetrators.  Further, what is this 
habit of Wigand's of talking with Bergman over a pay phone in the crowded 
halls of the high school in which he is trying to establish himself as a 
teacher?</P>
<P>"The Insider" will probably bring in a decent box office, but not an 
outstanding one.  The reason?  It's a thinking-person's movie, a 
behind-the-scenes look at a call for social reform, a story too true to be 
sensational.  It's also a darn good effort by a veteran of both television 
and film.  Its acting is solid, its plot engaging.  I'd recommend it for 
anyone 14 and up; the only reason for the R rating is too many appearances 
of a single, vulgar adjective.</P>
