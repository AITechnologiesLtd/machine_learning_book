<PRE>            THE MAN WITH RAIN IN HIS SHOES (United Kingdom)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: The woman Victor loves is marrying another guy and his
job is going down the tubes.  Then two magical junkmen give Victor a
chance to relive the last eight months again and he tries to avoid the
same mistakes.  The characters are tiresome and familiar.  Rating: 4 (0
to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>   - First feature film by Maria Ripoll.
   - Plot concept similar to GROUNDHOG DAY or upcoming TV series SEVEN
     DAYS.  Victor (Douglas Henshall) has really screwed up the last
     eight months of his life.  But he has been given another chance
     not to lose Sylvia (Lena Headey) the woman he loves.  He finds
     things harder than he expected and requiring more than just good
     intentions.
   - Two mysterious Spanish junk men have the ability to send him back
     in time and allow Vic to relive the past eight months and not to
     hurt Sylvia.
   - Elizabeth McGovern in a small role as a bartender whose wisdom
     inspires Vic.
   - All these young romantic films seem to have some nudity to keep
     the audience titillated.  It is unnecessary for this story, but
     expected.
   - Vic is not very smart in how he uses his memories of the first
     time around.  He says things that would make no sense to anyone
     but himself and the audience, convincing people that he is not all
     there.
   - This film makes London look really, really ugly.  The capper is
     walls with signs saying "Please do not piss here."
   - Title chosen to be intriguing, but has to be forced into the film.
   - Interesting in what can be changed and what cannot.
   - Vic is not very likeable.  He slashes tires and in general is just
     not very appealing.  It makes the audience not care if he gets the
     woman he wants or not.</P>
