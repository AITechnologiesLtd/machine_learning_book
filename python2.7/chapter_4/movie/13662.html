<P>   When I was seven years old I was certain that doctors
never got sick.  The thought that a doctor could be treated by
another physician simply did not enter my mind.  After all:
teachers knew everything.  Would a teacher have to continue
reading books and taking courses?  F. Gary Gray's police
drama "The Negotiator" raises a similar issue.  What happens
when a hostage mediator takes a hostage himself?  Would he
dicker with himself over the terms of surrender?  That's silly. 
But since he knows all the tricks of the trade, would any other
arbitrator be able to put one over on him?  Not likely.  Unless,
we see, the negotiator is Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), the
guy hand-picked by Lt. Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson) to
be his go-between.  Since Roman has now become the
victor-victim with a handful of hostages in tow, he can't be
fooled by the usual maneuvers like being "talked down."  This
means that Sabian must improvise for the first time in his life
to bring an end to an unbearably tense situation.  How he
does this--and how Roman deals with his new status--are the
concerns of the melodrama, scripted by James DeMonaco
and Kevin Fox.</P>
<P>   Though "The Negotiator" fits seamlessly into the season of
formulaic summer spectacles, two particulars lift it above the
commonplace.  One is DeMonaco and Fox's series of twists
and turns. Some of the guys you'd swear are bad turn out to
be just doing their job, while at least one of the angels is not
what he seems.  The other is the tension-riddled performance
of Samuel L. Jackson, who creates a believably taut role as a
super cop now suspected of murder and, together with the
wonderful Kevin Spacey as his adversary and friend light up
the screen with verbal histrionics and sizzling action.  </P>
<P>  The story opens as do many others of the genre with an
action unrelated to the central theme.  Roman is negotiating
with a crazed man who is holding a small girl hostage,
demanding to see his estranged wife.  The perp, unfamiliar
with the tricks of the trade, falls prey to Roman's banter
allowing the girl to escape unharmed.  Soon after this,
Roman's partner (played by Paul Guilfoyle) is murdered in his
car and Roman is charged with the crime.  We are thrust into
a sometimes convoluted plot involving the theft of two million
dollars from a policemen's disability fund with evidence
pointing to Roman's guilt.  Refusing to be taken into custody
(he could not tolerate being away from his beloved wife
Karen, played by Regina Taylor), Roman takes Inspector
Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) hostage in the latter's office together
with the local snitch (Nestor Serrano) and Niebaum's
secretary.  After making the negotiator on hand look like a
stuttering dimwit, he insists on speaking only with master
haggler Sabian.  The central part of the movie is occupied
with the badinage between the two brothers-in-arms, Roman
insisting on his innocence while Sabian torments the
frightened game almost mercilessly.</P>
<P>   The on-and-off exposes of bad cops by the press add
resonance to the tale of larceny and murder as we try to
figure out which of the cops was in on the embezzlement and
the murder.  Is the guilty party Commander Frost (Ron Rifkin),
known as Frosty, who is himself a hostage of Roman?  Could
it be Commander Beck (David Morse), the humorless officer
who is so insistent on shooting Roman that we wonder what
he is himself covering up? Or possibly the sinisted Inspector
Niebaum, who sits smirking in his chair, insisting on his
innocence but made suspect in our eyes because, well, J.T.
Walsh is not often known as the good guy.  Or could is be the
snitch, who supplies most of the story's comic relief?</P>
<P>   Shot on location in the streets of Chicago, "The Negotiator"
unfortunately regresses into the usual high-explosive category
when it would have been served better had it focused strictly
on the verbal chess game between the two principals.  For a
look at how the movie could have been a true blockbuster
rather than one which forces volatilility through chemical
explosives, take in the video of "Glengarry Glen Ross," also
highlighting the talent of Kevin Spacey, or just as well "The
Spanish Prisoner," an intricate, wholly involving story of a
scam which forbears  smoke-filled scenarios.  </P>
