<PRE>True Crime
A Film Review by Michael Redman
Copyright 1999 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>*** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>We'd like for our heroes to be saints. In the complexity of our world, it
would be wonderful if something were simple. We want the good guys to gallop
up, wear white hats, rescue fair damsels, always tell the truth and fight for
truth, justice and the American way. The ability to leap tall buildings in a
single bound is a bonus we expect.</P>
<P>Of course it's not always like that. In truth, it's probably never like that.
Bill Clinton is demonized because he had an affair with a younger woman.
Picasso often wasn't a pleasant person. John Lennon was criticized after a
drunken night in a bar. Kurt Vonnegut can be a grouch.</P>
<P>Obsession sometimes leads to excellent work, but it doesn't necessarily lead
to "nice."</P>
<P>"Oakland Tribune" editor-in-chief Alan Mann (James Woods) puts it best when he
describes Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood) as an [expletive deleted] but a great
reporter. Everett isn't an admirable guy. He keeps getting kicked off of
newspapers for sleeping with the editors' wives and daughters. He doesn't have
much time for his family. He's an alcoholic, just two months sober. He ignores
his boss's orders. Worst of all, he smokes in the office.</P>
<P>When a woman assigned to write a human interest article about an execution is
killed in a car wreck, Everett's editor Bob Findley (Denis Leary) phones his
own wife to locate him. Luckily he was there, next to her.</P>
<P>Everett is known for going overboard on his stories and Findley warns him that
they just want a puff piece. A couple of minutes after receiving the
assignment, the reporter decides that something is wrong and he's going to
find out what it is.</P>
<P>Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington) is scheduled to be put to death in 12 hours
so Everett doesn't have much time.</P>
<P>Although the film resorts to a number of time-worn devices, it's done with
style. There's a clock counting down the minutes, but fortunately it not a red
digital one superimposed in the corner of the screen. It's fairly obvious that
Beachum is innocent. The action is intense in the last few minutes. These are
formulaic but the audience is on the edge of their seats despite it all.</P>
<P>The reporter and the convict have a lot in common but they are completely
different. Everett's estranged relationship with his wife and daughter is
directly contrasted with the warmth exhibited when Beachum's wife and daughter
visit the condemned man.</P>
<P>Eastwood has become known for taking chances during recent years. He doesn't
shoot anyone here, but he's not a kinder gentler Dirty Harry. Everett is a
jerk, but he's our hero. Eastwood isn't afraid to display his character or his
own weaknesses. Although he's in good shape, a nude scene for a man in his
sixties shows courage.</P>
<P>Some of the best bits are between Eastwood and Woods. The characters are
buddies, both with respect for a good story. When Mann is chewing Everett out
for sleeping with Findley's wife, he asks several times how she was. During a
showdown between the three newspaper men, Mann dismisses the rules-and-regs
Findley and sides with the rogue.</P>
<P>Early in the film when Everett is told of the female reporter's death, he says
the right words: "I was just with her yesterday." "That's too bad." But
there's no hint of feeling behind them. What at first appears to be poor
acting is actually an insight into his personality. There appears to be no
emotion because there is no emotion.</P>
<P>He's a hard man. Everett explains to Beachum that all he has is his nose for
news. Without that he is nothing. He has given up his personal life for his obsession.</P>
<P>Like a number of films, the major problem is the last five minutes. Eastwood
had me in the palm of his hand with the well-constructed film until he decided
to put a bow around it. The film could end just before Everett goes toy
shopping. If Eastwood had abandoned the feel-good finish, it would have been a
much more powerful experience.</P>
