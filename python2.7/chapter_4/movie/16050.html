<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>The problem with sequels is that they try too much to be like the original.
Sure, there are a few exceptions. I can't think of any right off the top of
my head, but rule #665 in The Critic's Bible: there are exceptions to every
rule. Babe, by all accounts, was an intelligent, thought out movie. Babe II:
Pig in the City, tries and tries but can't quiet do it.</P>
<P>Sure, the humor is moderately intelligent and the narration includes things
like a mention of the chaos theory, but when it boils down to it, Babe II
was just like every other sequel: an attempt to carbon copy the original.
But, friends, the great copy machine known as Hollywood is broken, and has
never gotten a repairman, so we are doomed to watch screwed up attempts at
copying, remakes gone wrong, and things screwed up.</P>
<P>Babe II disappoints. It disappoints so much that I'll give you the plot
summary and then leave you be because talking about it makes my relive the
relative boredom of sitting in front of the screen with talking animals on
it.</P>
<P>Babe comes back from winning the sheep-herding contest he won last movie
and, when the farmer is injured and the farm goes into debt, Babe has to go
to the city. Of course he's separated from his human and of course he saves
the day for man and animal alike. There's really nothing that's anything but
simplistic about it. It's a movie void with laughs.
Now I promised I'd shut up so I will, but if you see Babe II, don't come to
me complaining about it.</P>
