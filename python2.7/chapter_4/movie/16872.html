<P>        Joel Schumacher's "8mm" is film noir of a grand tradition, a
chilling descent into the seedy underworld of the pornographic
industry.
Filmed almost entirely in shadow, the movie allows us a merciless
glimpse into a culture comprised of darkness, money, violence, and the
unquenchable thirst for sex which drives mankind.  There's
authenticity
to the presentation, and "8mm" makes us squirm uncomfortably in our
seats, simultaneously appalled and intrigued.</P>
<P>        Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is a private investigator who
operates discretely, a trait which allows him to work with many
high-profile clients.  ("I've been privilaged to provide services for
people I admire," he allows.)  When the widow of a much loved bank
president asks him to investigate a strange item found in her late
husband's vault, Welles agrees... not knowing that the case will come
to consume his every thought.</P>
<P>        The item in question is a short reel of Super 8 film, which
appears at first glance to be nothing more than a typical home movie.
But upon screening the footage, Welles is aghast at what he sees: a
teenage girl being raped and brutally murdered-- a so-called "snuff
film."  The confused widow wants to know what this hideous item
is doing in her husband's possession, as she knew him as a kind,
sweet man.  Welles, horrified, vows to uncover the origin of the film.</P>
<P>        Welles gets assistance in his investigation from a friendly
porn
dealer named Max (Joaquin Phoenix), who hides Truman Captoe novels
behind phony porn dustjackets, so he can read "real" books at work
without raising his customers' eyebrows.  This tells us a good deal
about Max, a bright young man who hates the way he makes his living,
but doesn't know any other way to survive.  The interplay between
Welles and his sidekick punctuates the landscape of "8mm" with
surprising warmth and humor-- quite a feat considering the subject
matter we're dealing with.</P>
<P>        The photography of "8mm" is flat, drab, and almost completely
devoid of color; it seems to be an intentional attempt to recreate the
underlit feel so common in Super 8 movies, as well as the shadowy
intrigue of past film noirs.  The musical score seems to stalk the
audience, and is as drenched in shadow and mystery as the photo-
graphy itself.  It adds a great deal of atmosphere to a movie already
overflowing with it.</P>
<P>        "8mm" is clever in the way it handles its pornographic
elements,
opting to tease us with the images from the snuff film rather than
shoving them in our faces.  It wisely leaves most of the action and
violence off-screen.  This is the correct approach to take-- as Max
himself points out, this type of imagery gets in one's head.  ("Once
you
see some of this stuff, you can't unsee it.")</P>
<P>        1997's "Batman and Robin," also helmed by Schumacher, proved
that the director knew how to construct pretty pictures of a city in
turmoil, even if the story repeatedly fell flat on its face.  (Earlier
this year, British comic book fans named it the worst movie ever
made about a comic book character.)  But "8mm" proves what I have
long since suspected: "Batman and Robin's" problems stemmed not
from Schumacher's inability to make a compelling film, but from
Akiva Goldsman's insultingly bad script.  Schumacher has a more
talented scribe this time around: Andrew Kevin Walker, the author
of "Seven," one of the finest thrillers of the past decade.  "8mm"
is an impressive rebound for Schumacher, and a fine continuation of
a strong track record for Walker.</P>
<P>        That doesn't mean they've achieved perfection, however.  The
story runs a tad too long, a small flaw which could have been fixed
with a little more attention to editing and pacing.  And Catherine
Keener is basically wasted in her role as Welles's wife, Amy; she
does little but whine, seemingly unconcerned with the case her
husband is working on.  I bristled nearly every time she came on
the screen.</P>
<P>        Much more interesting is the character of Janet
Matthews, the mother of the girl in the movie, who becomes
Welles's unwitting ally in the quest for the snuff film's origin.
In a lesser film, a romantic interest would develop between
these two characters, who have numerous scenes alone together.
"8mm" is smarter than that, however, and keeps their relation-
ship on a professional level, although Welles clearly grows fond
of her.  He is able to draw strength from Janet's love for her
daughter in one chilling climactic scene, the exact details of
which I won't spoil.</P>
<P>        This is a work of remarkable vision.  "8mm," like
"Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs," is eerie, dark, and
disturbing.  If you dislike films of this genre, you probably
won't have a great time.  But for those who enjoy a good
thriller, I recommend this particular walk on the wild side.</P>
