<PRE>Cats & Dogs (2001)

<PRE>"Son of my mom!"</PRE>
<P>Featuring the voice talents of Tobey Maguire, Alec
Baldwin, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon, Joe Pantoliano,
Michael Clarke Duncan, and starring Jeff Goldblum,
Elizabeth Perkins, Alexander Pollock and Miriam
Margolyes. Directed by Lawrence Guterman. Rated PG.</P>
<P>While other films have had it as a subplot, Cats &
Dogs is probably the first film to focus on the
eon-old rivalry between the two titular species. You'd
think, though, that said rivalry would be domestic in
nature, consisting of kitchen hijinks, running up
trees and other varied kinds of Tom & Jerry-style
ephemera. But, since all American movies must take
their subjects to their logical conclusions, the cats
and dogs here have their own secret societies,
complete with elaborate plans for world domination.</P>
<P>There are human characters as well, namely Professor
Brody (Jeff Goldblum), his wife (Elizabeth Perkins)
and his pre-teen son Scott (Alexander Pollock).
Professor Brody is working on a formula to eliminate
dog allergies in humans. This formula is very
important to the dog underworld, of course, since
their world still revolves around humans despite
having technology that's just as advanced. To the
cats, led by the nefarious Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes),
the formula spells (smells?) disaster, and they want
to steal it. Meanwhile, in their own labs, they work
on a way to reverse the formula to make all humans
allergic to dogs.</P>
<P>After the canine agent in charge of protecting the
Brody formula is dognapped, headquarters sends in a
new agent, a young recruit straight out of the
Academy. He never gets there. Instead, the Brodys get
a clueless young beagle pup named Lou (Tobey Maguire),
who wouldn't know a walkie-talkie if it rammed him on
the head. It's up to him, then, with support by a
next-door veteran agent (Alec Baldwin) to protect the
formula against Russian spy cats, ninja cats and other
feline schemes.</P>
<P>Cats & Dogs' script is completely commercial and
conventional, likely written and rewritten until an
executive thought it was in the best form to please
the most people. That the film still works is the
result of seamless special effects, solid performances
by reliable stars and those flashes of imagination
that were still left over. I like the way that the
doggie underworld was depicted; it's always good to
see a movie that isn't afraid to look a little silly.
I like, too, that the film made the cats villains.
I've always thought there was something sinister about
those creatures and Cats & Dogs confirms my
suspicions. Actually, I'm just allergic to them and
I'm venting my anger. Don't mind me.</P>
<P>There are some clever one-liners, such as the
painfully obvious but still funny exclamation "Son of
my mom!" given to one of the lead canines. Others are
just painfully obvious, such as a stray dog calling
herself "domestically challenged." And Will and
Grace's Sean Hayes is consistently a hoot as Mr.
Tinkles; I don't know where the hell he came from all
of a sudden, but I want to see more of him in
big-screen comedy.</P>
<P>What disappointed me most was the film's decision to
turn into a sugary (more like lumpy) boy-and-his-dog
tale. Since all eyes are on the special effects and
the central inter-species rivalry, nobody in the
audience cares whether or not little Scott likes his
puppy or not, and neither do the filmmakers. The
resulting subplot works best if you ignore it.</P>
<P>You get the idea. The movie is hit-and-miss. But the
90 minutes go by fast, and this is adequate family
entertainment. </P>
