<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 stars</P>
<P>It appears as though everybody and their dog wanted to contribute
something to Stepmom.  What other reason could explain the seven
scriptwriters (one not credited) and eleven producers involved in the
production?  It is ironical, then, that the greatest fault in this film
lies in its screenplay.  Despite solid efforts from an ensemble cast,
there is only so much that actors can do.  Julia Roberts and Susan
Sarandon tried desperately to make Stepmom work, only to find themselves
with too much screen time, and too little to say.  Blunder blockbuster
Armageddon suffered from a similar problem, with nine writers and no
hint of a coherent storyboard.  At least this time, director Chris
Colombus occasionally builds some worthwhile dramatic moments.</P>
<P>With Stepmom Colombus departures from his trend of lightheaded movies;
the best known being Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Nine Months (that's
why this "serious" film didn't have "by the director of Home Alone" on
its posters).  When Stepmom drifts into drama and confrontations, you
get the sense that Colombus is unsure as to how to handle his material.
Many moments go way too long and are emphasized over sufficiently, and
much of the dialogue could have been said in far fewer words.
Consequently, Stepmom loses interest in scenes that could have been
edited into something tighter and more structured.  With so much speech,
a good half-hour could have been slashed from its 124 minute running
time.</P>
<P>Isabel (Julia Roberts), a professional photographer, is the girlfriend
of workaholic lawyer Luke (Ed Harris), a divorced father of two
children.  She regularly takes care of Anna (Jena Malone), who has just
started dating, and Ben (Liam Aiken), a little kid with an aspiration to
be a magician.  Luke's ex-wife Jackie (Susan Sarandon) dislikes Isobelle
and sees her as a threat to the family, so naturally she is quick to
find fault in every mistake Isabel makes.  But Jackie is soon forced to
reevaluate her views on life and love upon the news that she has cancer,
and not long to live.  The two women form an unlikely friendship and
respect for each other whilst Luke fades into the background, presumably
working on an important case.</P>
<P>Allow me to stress that Luke - the most important male character (with
the possible exception of Ben) - performs an annoying disappearing act.
Lead female roles in film are not easy to find nowadays (though we've
had some good ones lately with My Best Friend's Wedding and There's
Something About Mary), but the novelty of having Julia Roberts and Susan
Sarandon dominate the screen is quickly worn off.  The always-reliable
Ed Harris is given enough ground to make a solid performance, but not
enough screen time to make a memorable one.  As Harris performs his
disappearing act, something even greater than a gifted actor vanishes -
the film's father figure is also missed.  Whilst it's great to see a
couple of talented women star in movie that is primarily theirs, it is
foolish to ignore a male actor when one is desperately needed
(especially one of the caliber of Ed Harris).</P>
<P>For everything that it is not, Stepmom at least provides realism and
maturity.  The seven scriptwriters take a good shot at looking into
sensitive family themes, which consist primarily of divorce and
re-marriage.  The film is most painful when it looks through the eyes of
the children, although some of their pain is a little exaggerated -
yelling and crying is one thing, subtly examining their desire for love
and acceptance is another.  I guess this is something that one writer
could do better than seven, twenty or a hundred. Chalk that down as a
message to the makers of Stepmom: hire fewer people and do a better job.</P>
