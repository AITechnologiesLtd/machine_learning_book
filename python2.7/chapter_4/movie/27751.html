<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is the movie not the perfume. A slow moving, stylish psychological
thriller in imitation of Hitchcock's Vertigo. It is adapted from an
original story by Brian De Palma and Paul Schrader, and is directed by
De Palma and scripted by Schrader. Set in New Orleans, 1959, it shows
the wealthy Michael Courtland (Cliff Robertson) sitting on top of the
world, celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his
mansion, as his lovely wife Elizabeth (Geneviève Bujold) and young
daughter Amy (Blackman), both look up to him beaming with joy. His
real-estate development partner Bob La Salle (John Lithgow) proposes a
toast to him and to their prosperous business, while his high society
friends give him their best wishes.</P>
<P>Upon retiring for the night, his daughter and wife are kidnapped in
their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500,000
tomorrow or they will be killed. Inspector Brie (Stanley Reyes) comes up
with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase
exchange, as that will lead them to the kidnappers. But the kidnappers
burst out of the house surrounded by the police, taking the two victims
with them and in the pursuing police chase, the kidnapper's car explodes
and goes over the bridge, where none of the bodies were found. Grieving
the loss of his wife and child, the guilt-ridden Michael builds them a
tomb on the expensive land they were to develop.</P>
<P>Sixteen years later he goes with his partner Bob on a vacation and he
revisits Florence, Italy, where he met his wife. When he goes to the
church where they met, he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his
wife. Her name is Sandra Portinari (Geneviève Bujold) and she's working
there restoring art that is decaying. He falls instantly in love with
her and doesn't heed Bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and
decides to take her back to New Orleans and marry her. Sandra becomes
his second chance to prove his love, as he thinks he can finally put the
past behind him.</P>
<P>The surprises to come weren't really all that surprising, as the beauty
in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by
the soul stricken Cliff Robertson, the emotionally impactful performance
by Geneviève Bujold, and the competent acting of John Lithgow. It plays
too much like a rehash of the Master's work, to break any new ground,
yet it is still thrilling in its own way.</P>
