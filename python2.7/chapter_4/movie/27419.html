<PRE>SAVE THE LAST DANCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Wanting badly to be another ethnic dance movie in the spirit of SATURDAY 
NIGHT FEVER, SAVE THE LAST DANCE never rises above SATURDAY NIGHT COLD.</P>
<P>Starring two badly miscast leads, the film features Julia Stiles as 
would-be Julliard ballerina Sara Johnson and Sean Patrick Thomas as 
inner city black high school student and would-be future doctor Derek 
Reynolds.  Stiles (10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU) just does not have the 
body of a ballerina.  Would you cast Danny DeVito to try out for the 
NBA?  And Thomas (CRUEL INTENTIONS) has upper middle-class prep school 
written all over him.  Don't get me wrong, the only good part of the 
movie is their relationship together.  The problem is that they don't 
fit the script, and even if they did, this is not a movie worth making.  
Between its lame dance sequences is more dead air time than a radio 
station during a long power blackout.</P>
<P>The movie, directed by Thomas Carter and written by Duane Adler and 
Cheryl Edwards, never can decide what kind of movie it wants to be.  
Sometimes it's a sappy melodrama.  Sometimes it tries to be a hard 
hitting drama about jealousy among the races over interracial dating.   
Derek's sister Chenille (Kerry Washington) complains to Sara about her 
taking "one of the few decent men we have left after jail, drugs and 
drive-bys."  Sometimes it is about male bonding ("Blood is thicker than 
blondes.")  And sometimes, finally, we get around to dancing, but the 
choreography is so awkward and the editing so choppy that you probably 
won't care.</P>
<P>It all starts when Sara's mom is killed while rushing to Sara's Julliard 
audition.  Cue the harps.  Off Sara goes next to live with the man whom 
she calls Roy (Terry Kinney) but who once was her father.  Cue the 
violins.  He has all of the personality of the torn wallpaper that 
decorates the flea-bitten apartment where he lives.  This makes Sara 
almost the only white face in her new high school.</P>
<P>At this point, Sara refuses to dance anymore or even talk about it.  Of 
course, after she meets and falls for Derek, it's quickly Julliard or 
bust.</P>
<P>Along the way we are taught many dubious moral lessons.  Derek's sister, 
still in high school, has a son, but she shows more interest in her 
wardrobe than her son, whom she has palmed off on her mother like a 
batch of dirty laundry.  Needless to say, the boy's father is even less 
interested in his own offspring.  The kids all get fake ids and drink 
illegally in a fancy nightclub in elegant clothes.  Where does all this 
money come from since no one seems to work?</P>
<P>And then there's the issue of violence.   Malakai (Fredro Starr), with 
whom Derek unconvincingly claims to have once knocked over a liquor 
store, wants to go shoot up another gang's neighborhood in retaliation 
for a previous raid.  Yes, this whole script is lifted from lots of 
other films and plays, most notably WEST SIDE STORY.  But in those, the 
actions have some amount of credibility.  Here people are shot, but the 
dreamy background music makes it seem downright romantic and not 
especially painful.</P>
<P>I kept wanting to stop the movie, clear off the set except for the two 
leads, and begin anew with a completely different script and director.  
I like Stiles and Thomas together.  I did not like the movie in which 
they found themselves stuck.</P>
<P>SAVE THE LAST DANCE runs 1:53.  It is rated PG-13 for violence, sexual 
content, language and brief drug references and would be acceptable for 
teenagers.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, gave the picture just **.  He thought it was too 
slow, the whole Malakai character was unnecessary, and he didn't like 
Sara's relationship with her parents.  He did comment favorably on the 
two leads.</P>
