<P>THE GREEN MILE, starring Tom Hanks, Doug Hutchison, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt,
Michael Duncan, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper,
Patricia Clarkson, Graham Greene, Jeffrey DeMunn, Dabbs Greer and Harry Dean
Stanton.  Directed by Frank Darabont.  1999.</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by John Carroll</PRE>
<P>   After witnessing a film like The Shawshank Redemption, you have to wonder
about two things: first, why the heck does Stephen King write a lot of horror
junk when he has such tremendous ability to write about other subjects, like
The Shawshank Redemption, and second, when are Darabont and King gonna team up
again?  Well, to anyone looking for these answers, take a walk down The Green
Mile, the latest collaborative prison-setting effort from the Darabont-King
team.</P>
<P>   The Green Mile is a prison drama based on Stephen King's six-part serial
novel.  As it goes with most book adaptations, the book is indeed better. 
However, Darabont does such an immense job converting the book to the silver
screen, he stays faithful to King's novel while giving it an entertaining
aspect on the big screen.  While the original book focused on the whole aspect
of prison life and the interaction between the inmates and the guards, the
movie tries to follow that same footing, but also divulges deeper into the
relationship between guard Paul Edgecomb and John Coffey, an immense man
convicted of raping and murdering two little girls.</P>
<P>   Tom Hanks stars in the film, and plays the role solidly.  His performance is
not like the Oscar-nominated roles of the past, but considering the immense
talent of this ensamble, he does not need to be.  Hanks plays the younger
Edgecomb, while Dabbs Greer plays the older Edgecomb.  The older Edgecomb
bookends the film, reflecting on the year of 1935, and as he describes it, the
year of his terrible urinary infection and also the year of John Coffey.  While
this bookending may seem pretty pretentious, considering two of the most
popular films of the 90s, Saving Private Ryan and Titanic, used this method,
The Green Mile, written by Stephen King, follows this method.  And considering
The Green Mile was brainstormed and written before Titanic and Saving Private
Ryan, The Green Mile just sticks to the novel, and is not trying to follow the
rest of the pack.</P>
<P>   With Tom Hanks in the film, The Green Mile automatically was tagged as the
film to beat for the Academy Awards.  And while Hanks's performance may not be
above and beyond this year's competition, The Green Mile will definitely be a
contender this March, if justice is served.  Ironically though, Hanks does not
carry The Green Mile towards near-perfection.  In fact, no member of the cast
truly lead the film, it was definitely an ensemble performance, and a major
success at that.</P>
<P>   The ensemble definitely leads this film, but there are a few breakout
performances that are worthy of note.  First of all, Doug Hutchison is yet
another young actor who should be garnering more leading roles as the Millenium
approaches.  His performance as the evil and cowardly Percy Wetmore is
impeccable, and undoubtedly the best of the film.  He contributes perfectly to
the group, while still making a name of himself.  His Percy is dead on with the
character of King's novel.  Secondly, Michael Duncan, whose only previous major
roles came in Armageddon and A Night at the Roxbury, breaks out of his shell as
the enormous, yet spiritually powerful, John Coffey.  Be sure to note his
initials, because Darabont makes many religious references to Coffey's powers,
which both support and detract from The Green Mile.  And finally, the
impeccable Mr. Jingles.  Heavy advertising has taken place in the past month
for Stuart Little, but if you are looking for real mousey entertainment, The
Green Mile's mascot, Mr. Jingles, is the mouse to see this winter.</P>
<P>   The rest of the ensemble blends in with the rest, and until viewing the
credits, you never notice how many major roles are displayed in The Green Mile.
 Each character, from Tom Hanks's Paul Edgecomb to Gary Sinise's defense
attorney who spends all of three minutes on screen, play a tremendous role
towards advancing The Green Mile to its ultimate destination.</P>
<P>   Is there anything wrong with The Green Mile?  Yes, as minor as they may be,
there are one or two minor flaws, but nothing major.  The first thing that
comes to everyone's mind is the film's running time, but all things considered,
The Green Mile stays entertaining for pretty much all of its three hours.  When
trash like The Haunting has problems even filling up two hours, The Green Mile
is a fresh of breath air as its character interaction and unique entertainment
and sentiment keep everyone interested for the three hour marathon.</P>
<P>   Now onto the flaws.  I, for one, have read the book.  While some may see
that as a disadvantage, because it would prevent me from reviewing the film
fairly, it is actually an extreme advantage in the case of The Green Mile. 
While the film is very good, when it ventures into John Coffey's supernatural
powers, a lot of viewers who have not read the novel will be left in the dark. 
In the end, mostof the loose ends of the fiml are tied together, but it is
fairly vague to some people what is going on, which may lead to their
dismissing Coffey's acts as pure pretentiousness.  However, Darabont tries his
best, and The Green Mile does eventually make sense, just be sure to pay
attention.</P>
<P>   Those flaws may be nitpicking, but in the end, that is all The Green Mile
actualls fails at doing.  It has true sentiment and despite its few lapses into
unbelievability, The Green Mile keeps you entertained for the full three hours
with an unbelievable ensemble cast and a wonderful plot.  As Paul Edgecomb
says, the Green Mile can be "oh so long," but in the eyes of this critic, it is
also 'oh so beautiful.'</P>
<PRE>    Final Verdict: A</PRE>
