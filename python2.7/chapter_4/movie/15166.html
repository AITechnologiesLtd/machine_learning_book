A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Richard LaGravenese</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Richard LaGravenese</PRE>
<P>Starring: Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, Queen Latifah</P>
<P>Ingredients: Recently divorced woman, friendship, fantasy</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
The movie opens with the main character, a nurse named Judith (Holly
Hunter), learning from her husband that he has been having an affair
with a younger woman (Tamlyn Tomita). Cut to after the divorce. From
then on, LIVING OUT LOUD is mostly about the crazy little thoughts and
actions that Judith goes through in order to steady her life after the
divorce. Luckily she meets two new friends to help keep her mind off
things. Pat (Danny DeVito) is the gamble-holic divorced elevator man at
Judith's high rise. Liz Bailey (Queen Latifah) is a world-weary jazz
singer at a local club. Will Judith be able to weather life's storms?</P>
<P>Opinion: 
LIVING OUT LOUD is one of those quirky, meandering, interesting,
slice-of-life films. The whole idea is to map out how Judith comes to
grips with her emotions through smaller actions. Holly Hunter, Danny
DeVito, and Queen Latifah all give bravura performances, playing
complicated but thoroughly human characters who form temporary
alliances/friendships with each other for their own personal reasons.
There is no tight plot or easy, satisfying resolution to LIVING OUT LOUD
since it is more of an art house character portrayal (like a quick dab
of the paintbrush on the canvas of human relationships) than a big
screen exaggeration. I would love to see LIVING OUT LOUD adapted to
stage, where it would no doubt achieve immediate and resounding success.</P>
