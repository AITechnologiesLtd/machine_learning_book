                 The Ghost And The Darkness (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          Michael Douglas, who with Steven Reuther, is one of the
producers of the film, said: "It's an incredible thriller based on
events that actually took place.  It recounts the struggle of a man
attempting to control the environment and the dangers of a culture
trying to impose itself on another.  In many ways it is a reflection
of what is going on today."</P>
<P>          East Africa, about 1886.  The British are trying to build a
bridge to carry their rains.  The product they and other countries are
trying to get is ivory.  Putting a large crimp in their plans are two
seemingly uncanny lions who attack the workers wherever they may be
and despite the traps that are laid to catch them.  To the natives it
seems very strange that the lions seem to know the plans of those who
would kill them and they strike different areas.  This is why the
workers have dubbed the lions "The Ghost" and The Darkness."</P>
<P>          The film's best asset is that it sticks as much as possible
to what really happened back in 1886,  Knowing this is a true account
adds greatly to the enjoyment of the film as we watch bridge- builder
engineer John Patterson (Val Kilmer) and wild game hunter, Remington
(Michael Douglas) set out to kill the lions and get on with the job of
building the bridge.</P>
<P>          Here we have an exciting story with the kings of the animal
world vs. Man, set in Africa with one hair-raising scene after
another.  Nothing like those two eerie lions has happened before or
since according to writer William Goldman.   Samuel, (John Kani, who
is an actor, director and playwright) is the African contact who
assists  Patterson and Remington as they try to seek out the lions and
destroy them.</P>
<P>         The film is well-acted, the music (Jerry Goldsmith), is
excellent and the scenes of the wildlife of Africa are beautiful.</P>
