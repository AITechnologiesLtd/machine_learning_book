<PRE>"3000 Miles to Graceland"</PRE>
<P>International Elvis Week in Las Vegas draws a flood of King wannabes in
sequined jumpsuits and mutton chop sideburns. But, five copycats that enter
the Riviera Hotel and Casino have plans of their own - armed robbery with
really big guns. This is just the beginning of a tale of betrayal, murder
and revenge, starring Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner, in "3000 Miles to
Graceland."</P>
<P>It has been a while since we've had a crime caper movie on a visual par
with such films as "Con Air" or "True Romance," and it looked like "3000
Miles to Graceland" would fit the bill. We do get a pair of high-powered,
heavy-ordinance shootouts, one early on and the other the dramatic finale,
that provide the requisite thrills to grab the viewer's attention. But,
these action bits are bridged with a cat-and-mouse chase as the two key
figures, Michael (Kurt Russell) and Murphy (Kevin Costner), vie to take
possession of the $3.2 million stolen from the casino.</P>
<P>Things start off amiably enough when Michael parks his vintage, candy-apple
red, 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville convertible at the Last Chance Motel near
Vegas. A local kid, Jessie Waingrow (David Kaye), steals the fancy valve
caps off of the classic car and, to get them back, Michael meets the boy's
mom, Cybil (Courtney Cox). Sparks fly between the lonely ex-con and the
equally lonely Cybil and they have a romantic interlude. Then arrives
Murphy and his three partners - Hanson (Christian Slater), Franklin (Bokeem
Woodbine) and Gus (David Arquette).</P>
<P>Murphy, Michael and the rest, it turns out, are headed to Las Vegas for
International Elvis Week, where thousands of the King's impersonators are
gathering to honor their muse. The plan is, with all of the confusion in
town, to hit one of the big casinos for a fortune. The heavily armed
Elvises pull off the heist but are intercepted by security guards, ending
in a violent shootout right in the middle of the casino. As the guys blast
their way out, one of their number, Franklin, is hit and soon dies. When
the remaining four thieves get together to split the booty, a conflict
arises over Franklin's share. Hanson goes toe-to-toe with Murphy and loses,
making it a team of three. When they head out to get rid of the body in an
isolated place, Murphy tries to make their number just one - him.</P>
<P>Only Michael survives Murphy's attack and he tries to head off the killer
from getting the loot. He teams up with Cybil and Jessie to get the cash
laundered, all the while being relentlessly pursued by Murphy in a chase
that ends with a major confrontation with the law.</P>
<P>I was a little disappointed, part way into the film, when the Elvises in
Las Vegas bit falls by the wayside following the heist. It takes on a more
personal note as Michael, Cybil and Jesse hit the road with Murphy in
pursuit. Murphy has no trouble with killing and a string of bodies is left
along the way as they all head for the Canadian border and freedom. But,
this odd road movie takes on unusual proportions as greed kicks in and, for
awhile, it's every man (or woman) for himself. At one point, Michael and
Jessie are teamed as they chase Cybil who took the money and ran.</P>
<P>My complaint about "3000 Miles to Graceland" is the extended middle where
double cross is met by double cross. While the personality dynamics is
interesting, sometimes violent and sometimes amusing, it meanders along at
times, making me wish for some judicious editing. The bookend violence of
the story is shocking in its brutality and slick in its, no pun intended,
execution. As the heist and subsequent shootout takes place, with fast,
stylish inter-cutting between the violence and scenes from the dance floor
where Elvis clones and beautiful showgirls sing and dance, unaware of the
mayhem that is happening near by. The climactic finale is a Hollywood
example of more bullets is better as Murphy goes out in a blaze of glory
reminiscent of Jimmy Cagney in "White Heat."</P>
<P>Production credits are solid as we are brought into the fantasy world of
Las Vegas and its International Elvis Week. There are Elvises in all shapes
and sizes (there is even a dwarf Elvis who gets it during the heist) and
this has some amusing turns with impersonators who look decidedly unlike
the King. The gonzo gun duels are handled with fast camera work, faster
editing and well choreographed violence. Videomaker Demian Lichenstein
utilizes his music vid chops to infuse a hyperkinetic energy into the big
shootouts.</P>
<P>The perfs are relegated to the four principles once the heist is over and
Murphy thins the herd of contenders for the loot. Slater, Woodbine and
Arquette get some mileage as the other members of the gang and, as they are
offed, you wish there was more of them. But, the cast that's left does OK.
Costner is surprisingly good as the taciturn and murderous Murphy. It is
against his usual good guy persona and reflects one of his better
performances of late. The likable Kurt Russell is the good guy among the
bad and he gets to wear his shining armor to the end. Surprisingly,
Courtney Cox delivers one of her better perfs as the sexy and human Cybil.
Young David Kaye gives a good intro performance as the tough,
self-sufficient Jessie.</P>
<P>"3000 Miles to Graceland" is not just a heist flick as the trailers
reflect. It is that, but there is a larger story of greed, murder, betrayal
and revenge that hones itself to a sharp point before the explosive ending.
The two-hour run time could have been cut for a better film, but I still
give it a B-.</P>
