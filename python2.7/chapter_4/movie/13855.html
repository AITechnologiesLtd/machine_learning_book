<PRE>Pi</PRE>
<P>How the heck can I describe the visceral experience that is "Pi"?  It is
a film I thoroughly enjoyed, but I recognize it contains too many
elements that will intimidate those used to, say, more traditional fare.
I can only hope that a movement will begin, whereas individuals will
resist the temptation of the bland, assembly-line studio product, and
try for something totally unique and delectable.</P>
<PRE>Who am I kidding?</PRE>
<P>The Greek letter "Pi" equals the ratio between the circumfrence of a
circle to its diameter.  Since this is something learned by
tenth-graders, and most movies are made on a fourth-grade level, it
should be expected that its core audience is limited.  But even for the
mathematically deficient, Pi is less about mathematics as it is a study
in obsession, a visual representation of madness.  It is "Eraserhead"
meeting "Taxi Driver" with some "Wall Street" and "Yentl" thrown in for
good measure.</P>
<P>It's protagonist, Maximillian Cohen, believes that mathematics is the
true language of nature, and that every action in the world, no matter
how random, is intricately ordered and patterned.  Given this thesis,
why not use this knowledge to try to predict the stock market?  Such
research draws attention from some shady investment banker types.</P>
<P>Although Max is an agnostic Jew, his faith more accurately reflects that
of an "atheistic Calvinism".  Even so, he draws the attention of Lenny
Meyer, a Kaballah Jew, who explains that the Hebraic language is numeric
and replete with symbolism, perhaps with the key to the meaning of life.
Curiously, Max joins their sect, only to find that even they have
ulterior motives.</P>
<P>Still with me?  There's more.  Max's computer, which occupies most of
his apartment, crashes, leaving behind a printout of random numbers.  Or
are they?</P>
<P>And Max suffers from chronic headaches.  And hallucinations.  And drugs.
And nosebleeds.  And he spends far too much time isolated in his
apartment.  And I'm still not sure what he does for a living.  And he
may be going a little... mad.</P>
<P>Hello?  Still there?  Try this. The film was made for an astonishing low
budget ($60,000), in a glaringly strong black and white.  And is
pulverized by a hypnotic, techno-soundtrack.  This film screams, "Cult
movie!"</P>
<P>Rarely does the majority of the moviegoing public go to a movie to,
gasp, learn something. This audience may be intimidated by the apparent
dryness in _Pi_'s plot.  It's anything but.  First timer Darren
Aranofsky gets a lot of mileage out of his limitations.  The picture is
one of the most mesmerizing claustrophobic creations ever put to
celluloid.  The cinematography is stunning, the editing is superior, and
there are fantastic close up images that we take for granted: a
trembling thumb, an ant on a microchip, a dismembered brain.  He
deservedly won the director's prize at Sundance this year.</P>
<P>It's not impossible to make a good film based on mathematics (Good Will
Hunting, The Spanish Prisoner, heck, even Jurassic Park).  But rarely
has a film been so engrossed in its own world, that you feel immersed in
an entirely new reality.  There's a lot of interesting ideas in _Pi_,
coupled with some of the most breathtaking imagery and editing I've seen
in a long time.  Sean Gullette, playing Max, has a strong, eerie
presence, and Ben Shenkman adds wonderful color as Lenny.</P>
<P>I have two problems with the film.  There is this glaring gaffe where
Max walks down a subway platform, where he is initially at the 50th
Street station, and winds up at the exit for Prospect Park (only New
Yorkers will catch that).  And, oh yeah, the ending is a tiny cop-out.</P>
<P>But these issues are microscopic in comparison to the greatness of this
movie.  Search it out.  Now.  Go to the latest showing. Please.  Trust
me.   I double-dog dare you.</P>
<P>Nick Scale:   9 (if you're interested in mathematics, theology, stocks,
board games, New Yorkers, philosophy, and non-conventional film-making).
        7 (if not).</P>
