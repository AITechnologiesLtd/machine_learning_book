<P>ALADDIN is a very spectacular and thrilling adventure in the Arabian
nights.  The young and handsome thief Aladdin meets with the Sultan's
run-away daughter, and falls in love with her. At the same time, the
Sultan's evil vizir, Jafar, and his amusing side-kick, Iago, are in
search of a magic lamp containing a Genie who can grant the owner's
every wish. But only one person may enter the cave where the lamp is
hidden, and fetch it, and Jafar discoveres that it's the one and only,
Aladdin.  Aladdin is tricked into helping Jafar, and finds the magic
lamp. But when Jafar betrays him, Aladdin disappears with the
lamp. Then Aladdin releases the Genie and is granted his most desired
wish: to be a prince, so that he can marry the Sultan's daughter, whom
he loves. Everything goes according to plan, but Aladdin is beginning
to understand that he cannot pretend to be someone that he is
not. Jafar realizes that the prince is the boy whom he hired to get
the lamp, and soon everything is set for a masterfully depicted
struggle between good and evil.</P>
<P>ALADDIN's best aspects are the stunning animation, background scenes,
voice talents and music. (Are there more aspects to talk of?) Although
one of the first scenes, where a thief is mercylessly destroyed by
a certain cave, is a little too dramatic for small children, the rest
of the movie runs at a generally low violence level. There is evil,
but it's far more cartoonish and "harmless" than in THE LION KING or
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Where Scar and Judge Frollo were sincerely
cruel, Jafar is more of a comedian attempting to look bad (although he
gets tougher in the end). Iago is a very fun character, and his position
as Jafar's talking parrot is extremely enjoyable. His imitations of
others are hard to avoid laughing of. The Genie (Robin Williams' voice 
is perfect for him) has a lot of impressive imitations of real people 
and brilliant fast-talk all the way. He certainly steals the show.</P>
<P>All in all, Disney has managed to create a spectactular and very
humorous animated feature that is one of the most light-hearted of
them all.  Romance, enchantment, magic, a little violence, some pretty
innocent cruelty, and a good deal of humor mixed together makes
ALADDIN a wonderful movie for everyone.</P>
