<P>Plot: A team of scientists are brought to the middle of the Pacific 
where they are informed they have been selected as first contact 
specialists to investigate a crashed UFO that has been discovered on the 
ocean floor. Entering the craft they discover it is really a ship from 
Earth's future that has been thrown back in time through a black hole. 
At the heart of the ship is a mysterious sphere. After one of the team 
recklessly enters the sphere, they find themselves in contact with an 
alien entity and their habitat under attack by jellyfish and giant 
squids which appear to have been manifested from out of their worst 
fears.</P>
<P>Nobody, with the exception of John Travolta, has quite made a career 
comeback in recent years like Michael Crichton has. In the 1970s 
Crichton had big hits with the film adaption of his novel `The Andromeda 
Strain' in 1971 and further successes as a director with the likes of 
`Westworld' (1973), `Coma' (1978) and `The Great Train Robbery' (1979). 
But after that point Crichton's star began to wane - the film adaption 
of his best-selling novel `The Terminal Man' in 1974 was barely seen, 
and his other directorial efforts - `Looker' (1981), `Runaway' (1984) 
and `Physical Evidence' (1989) - were ignored by all and sundry. 
Crichton's appeal was always founded in the post-`2001' view of the 
future as a soullessly sterile, antisceptic world where we have come to 
be crowded out by our technology or where our technology is in imminent 
danger of going out of control. But after `Star Wars' in 1977 the vision 
of a cold, sterile future was suddenly replaced by a gee-whiz enthusiasm 
for all things wondrous and Crichton's technological alarmism became 
outmoded.</P>
<P>In `The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction' (1992), Peter Nicholls accuses 
Crichton's novels of reading like potential film scripts. Nicholls' 
slightly cynical tone notwithstanding, there is some truth to the 
comment in that both Crichton's novels of `Sphere' (1987) and `Jurassic 
Park' (1990) were originally designed as film scripts. It is a measure 
of just how far Crichton was out of grace at the time in that none of 
these attracted any attention. Crichton also had the further ignominy of 
seeing a substantial part of `Sphere' stolen by James Cameron in `The 
Abyss' (1989).</P>
<P>`Jurassic Park' was however a best-seller and attracted the eyes of 
Steven Spielberg and the rest, as they say, is history. Crichton's 
middle name has suddenly become "author of `Jurassic Park'" and he has 
found himself in the midst of a major career revival even bigger than 
the success he had had in the 1970s. Although Crichton has yet to 
reoccupy the director's chair, there have been major film adaptions of 
all his books - `Rising Sun' (1993), `Disclosure' (1994), `Congo' 
(1995), `The Lost World: Jurassic Park' (1997) - and he has provided the 
original screenplays for `Twister' (1996) and created the hit tv series 
`ER' (1994- ). The `Jurassic Park' credit alone has been enough to 
propel him from has-been film-maker to one of the most cinematically 
popular contemporary novelists, rivalled possibly only by John Grisham. 
(As of this writing with `The Thirteenth Warrior', adapted from 
Crichton's `Eaters of the Dead' (1976), awaiting release later this year 
that makes only one Crichton novel - `Airframe' - that has not been 
filmed and that is being planned for next year).</P>
<P>Certainly `Sphere' is probably Crichton's weakest book. In it Crichton 
seemed undecided whether he was telling an alien contact story or a 
monsters from the id drama, and the ending where the protagonists simply 
wished the problem away was so absurd I threw the book across the room. 
Crichton's novels are fine for the scientific extrapolation and the 
depth of research Crichton places into them but when it came to 
characters, Crichton is utterly flat. To return to Nicholls' comment 
above, it is not hard to see why one might think that as Crichton's 
novels tend to make better films than books - film allows Crichton's 
nondescript characters to be fleshed out with actors. `Jurassic Park' is 
an enjoyable page-turner but what really made it as a film and 
phenomenon was seeing the dinosaurs in all their ferocious, 
living-breathing CGI glory.</P>
<P>`Sphere' comes directed by Barry Levinson, of `Diner', `Toys' and `Wag 
the Dog' fame, as well as director of Crichton's `Disclosure'. The 
script adaption is from Paul Attanasio, creator with Levinson of the 
finest series on tv at the moment, `Homicide: Life on the Streets', and 
who also adapted (and improved) Crichton's `Disclosure' for Levinson. 
And `Sphere' is really quite an impressively well-made film - the 
unfolding of the alien contact scenes and the revelation of the alien's 
identity are eerie and suspenseful. There is perhaps a little too much 
running around between ships, but the science and underwater scenes are 
conducted with an impeccable and impressive realism. There is also an 
excellent score. Levinson and photographer Adam Greenberg invest the 
story with an increasingly dark, claustrophobic tone that quite begins 
to grip the imagination. And the combined efforts of all allow a story 
that seemed fairly naff on the page to gain considerable credibility on 
screen. Levinson and Attanasio even manage to tone down and make the 
ending quite believable.</P>
<P>But oddly `Sphere' has been the only Crichton film so far to have been a 
relative box-office disappointment. It is puzzling as to why `Sphere' 
died a box-office death as it is really quite a good film. One suspects 
the reason for such is that it eschews big-budget special effects which 
are synonymous with sf these days in favour of cerebral, psychological 
drama. There are no show-stopping scenes of mass destruction and the 
monsters that do appear are psychological not physical. </P>
<P>Crichton is an oddly divided writer. On one hand he has a fascination 
with technology - all his books come accompanied with graphs and 
diagrams - yet he is deeply sceptical of all this technology getting out 
of control. Underneath all of Crichton's work runs a single strand of 
pessimism. Crichton fears that human nature or simple human error will 
invariably cause things to go awry - be it a single strand of jammed 
computer tape nearly causing an entire viral containment facility to 
self-destruct in `The Andromeda Strain'; a epileptic becoming addicted 
to the electric shocks that are supposed to control him in `The Terminal 
Man'; or human greed causing unforeseen system foul-ups in both 
`Disclosure' and `Jurassic Park'; and machine error in `Westworld'. In 
`Jurassic Park' Crichton even manages to turn chaos theory - which is 
simply a mathematical paradigm for the impossibility of predicting 
behaviour in complex systems - into a kind of Murphy's Law where things 
will invariably go out of control. And in `Sphere' Crichton's themes are 
writ at their most visible. One film that makes interesting comparison 
here to `Sphere' is `Contact'. Both are films about alien contact and 
human prejudice. But where `Contact' says that alien contact can offer 
the possibility of a consciousness-expanding entry into a wider universe 
but that to accept it we must overcome small-mindedness; `Sphere', writ 
through with Crichton's usual doubts about human nature, is utterly 
pessimistic - holding the end view that humanity, given the miraculous 
ability to wish anything into being, will only manifest its deepest 
darkest fears and that we are better off without such a gift.</P>
<P>People have rushed to make comparisons between `Sphere' and other past 
sf films. There are undeniable comparisons that can be made to 
`Forbidden Planet' (1956) which involved a similar alien device which 
conjured forth repressed psychological fears, and `Solaris' (1972) with 
scientists aboard a space station being driven crazy by a sentient 
planet's manifesting forms from their unconscious in an attempt to 
communicate with them. A further point of comparative interest might 
also be last year's `Event Horizon' which inside its thorough muddle of 
ideas really wanted to be what `Sphere' emerges as. Of course the one 
film that most rushed to compare `Sphere' to was `The Abyss', being 
unaware that `Sphere' the novel predated `The Abyss'. But `Sphere' and 
`The Abyss' do make for interesting comparison. It may be heretical in 
light of the public disfavour given to `Sphere' to suggest that it 
actually works better as a story than `The Abyss' does but it is a case 
I am willing to argue. `The Abyss' had some grippingly intensive moments 
of human drama but the alien contact angle seemed awkwardly jammed onto 
the end, and the final scene (in both the original cinematic release and 
the 1992 `Special Edition') of the alien ship rising to the surface was 
a big anti-climax. `Sphere' works to a far more dramatically satisfying 
conclusion and certainly gives its alien contact theme a far more 
rigorous workout than `The Abyss' with its bunch of glowing, ethereal 
Spielberg castoffs who have come merely to wave nuclear disarmament 
flags does. Possibly this a film whose merit will undergo reevaluation 
in a few years time.</P>
