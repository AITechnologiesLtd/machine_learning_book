<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Arnold Schwarzenegger's new action vehicle End of Days seemed like it
went on for days.  The mindless thriller - Arnie's first in two years -
takes place during the final four days of the upcoming millennium and
feels like it was shot in real-time.  The premise is that Satan needs to
impregnate a `chosen' female before the clock strikes 12 in order to be
released from his prison.  They didn't specifically say it, but I think
the prison may be Joliet.</P>
<P>The opening credits utilize every bad religious cliché they could dig up
– fire, snakes, spooky singing and Arabic text.  The film kicks off in
1979 Vatican City, Rome, where an astrological event known as `The Eye
of God' is seen by an underling of the Pope.  The presence of the `Eye'
means that somewhere in the world, a girl is to be born that will, in
twenty years' time, be impregnated by Satan.  The Pontiff dispatches men
to find the girl (yeah, right) and keep her from evil for a couple of
decades.  Sounds reasonable, right?  Six hours later, the `chosen'
infant girl is born in New York City, the evilest place in the world in
1979.</P>
<P>Flash to present-day (December 28, 1999, to be exact) where Satan
returns to Earth, taking over the body of a Wall Street banker (Gabriel
Byrne, who just played a priest in Stigmata) in the men's room of a posh
NYC eatery.  Despite his new form (and his invincibility), Satan still
feels the need to hire protection services to venture around the Big
Apple.  Enter Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, Batman & Robin) a drunk
ex-cop (isn't Bruce Willis supposed to get these roles?) with a funny
sidekick called Chicago (Kevin Pollak, She's All That).  They both have
great names, but each pales in comparison to Satan.</P>
<P>The `chosen' girl (Robin Tunney, Niagara, Niagara), now twenty, doesn't
show up until thirty minutes into the film.  Her name is Christine York
(get it – Christ-ine?).  Both of her parents are dead and she's been
having strange visions for most of her life and, as a result, pops pills
and sees a shrink (Udo Kier, Blade).  As a side note, if your therapist
looks like Udo Kier – run for your life.  One of the visions involves a
creepy cross-eyed subway freak that tells her, `He's coming, and he's
going to f--- you!' before shattering like a frozen Robert Patrick in
T2.  Why this person has not yet been cast in a Harmony Korine film is
beyond me.</P>
<P>One of the catches in Satan's plan is that he has to conceive between
11:00 PM and 12:00 AM on New Year's Eve.  What are the odds that she is
even ovulating at that time?  Arnie even gets off a great line,
rhetorically asking if Satan's plot is designed around Eastern Standard
Time.  The writers laugh it off with some quick blurb about Gregorian
calendars being created for this very reason.  Plus, you've gotta figure
that Satan really needs to start working on the girl at around 11:40 at
the latest.  He seems like the kind of guy who likes to sweet-talk the
ladies.  I figure ten minutes of foreplay, five for the actual `act,'
and then five minutes of cuddle-time.</P>
<P>End of Days does have a few cool visuals (from special effects wiz Stan
Winston) and one legitimately scary scene, but that was lifted from
Se7en (and Kevin Spacey was a much scarier villain than the Devil,
anyway).  Speaking of Spacey, they also lifted his `Satan's greatest
trick was convincing the world he didn't exist' line from The Usual
Suspects.  Satan's giant head of fire (an effect ruined by the trailer)
is cool, but we've already seen it in The Mummy (and it wasn't that
great to begin with).  Also disappointing was Satan's non-human form
which, when revealed at the end, seemed a lot like Buffy's principal in
the season finale last season.  The pre-sold `modern rock' soundtrack
was all but missing from the film.</P>
<P>Directed by Peter Hyams (The Relic) and written by Andrew W. Marlowe
(Air Force One), Days features an incredibly hammy performance by
Schwarzenegger, who, in one scene, even gets to cry when he thinks about
Jericho's dead wife and kid.  Tunney, who was so good in Niagara,
Niagara, seems both badly lost and miscast.  Going from indie pics like
Niagara and Julian Po to a Schwarzenegger film doesn't seem like a
logical jump at all.  Plus, she has one of the most unnecessary nude
scenes in recent memory – goodbye, credibility!  Byrne chews the scenery
as the Horned One, who, we learn, is able to piss gasoline.  Rod Steiger
(Crazy in Alabama) plays a puffy priest that would rather rely on faith
to save Christine, while some of his churchie cohorts would just as soon
kill her to put an end to the whole saga.</P>
<P>But, seriously, how much faith can you put into a film that doesn't
reveal the name of its main character until ninety minutes in?
(Christine says his name at this point, which is the first time we hear
it.)  And speaking of faith, where the Christ is the good guy in all of
this?  Yeah, I'm talking about the big `G.'  Can't we rely on him to
give us a hand when Satan plans on turning our sphere into Hell on
Earth?  He was a no-show.  A non-factor.  You can kiss your tithe
goodbye, Ms. Morrissette.</P>
<P>2:00 - R for intense violence and gore, a strong sex scene, nudity and
adult language</P>
