<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>When I was in high school, I was a math nerd.  I wasn't as bad as the
real Math Nerds, but I was close enough.  I sat quietly in calculus and
got As (though only once did I earn the highest score on an exam).  I
really liked math, and I was good at it.  I thought of things in terms
of math, in terms of equations and numbers, and my thought process was
logical and straightforward.  I was also a pretty boring person back
then.  I am, however, overstating the importance of math in my life,
because now, in my third year of college, I'm an English major. </P>
<P>But I still gaze upon math with a certain level of affectionate
remembrance.  Perhaps that is why I greatly admire Pi, Darren
Aronofsky's visually masterful tribute to math nerds.  This is an
engaging, profound film -- it strings us along in a whirl of
mathematical madness, and then concludes with a fascinating hypothesis
about the nature of the universe around us.  It's a film that feels new
and original, a thriller that doesn't have gun shots or car chases, and
a suspense piece that never regresses into inanity or stupidity.  </P>
<P>The main character is an odd, introverted math nerd named Max Cohen
(Sean Gullette).  He works on finding patterns in the stock market. 
Over time, however, the numbers get to him, and he becomes obsessed with
finding a pattern that connects all the contents of the universe.  His
journey begins one night when his computer spits out a 216-digit number,
and then crashes.  Max, distraught from losing all of his work, falls
into depression, and periodically goes into seizures during which he has
to take pills and give himself injections.</P>
<P>It turns out that there are many people after this 216-digit number,
and they're all trying to get Max to give it to them.  A group of Jews
(led by a numerologist played by Ben Shenkman) need to find a word for
God that is 216 letters longs.  And a crazy lady (Pamela Hart) wants the
number to understand the stock market more clearly.  Max needs to
confide in his former math professor (Mark Margolis), but his professor
just tries to deter him from his path because he knows what lies at the
end of it.  </P>
<P>There's not a moment in Pi that isn't fascinating in its bizarre,
surreal way.  Aronofsky's visual style is shockingly straightforward;
the film was shot in grainy black and white, with blaring contrasts, and
the result is a stark picture that always drips with desperation. The
sets are small and claustrophobic, and often too dark to see clearly. 
This is not a flaw, but an appropriate stylistic choice -- Aronofsky
succeeds in making Max's world unique and horrifying, and he does this
to prove his point.  </P>
<P>The story is fantastic and original; I've never seen a film about math,
and it's not likely that I will see another one any time soon. 
Aronofsky takes the story in the right direction, by searching for the
connection between math and nature.  He also does his story a great
service by developing the main character, and by finding an actor as
capable as Sean Gullette.  Gullette makes up for inexperience with
determination and energy, and delivers one of the most inspired
performances I've seen this year.  It can't be easy to play a character
so detached from what we all know is reality.</P>
<P>Pi revolves around mathematical concepts, but don't let that keep you
from seeing the film.  It doesn't pander to math nerds -- it makes its
points clearly without going overboard with terms and concepts.  </P>
<P>The film was made with just $60,000, but it never seems low-budget.  In
fact, by comparing it to a $115 million creatively bankrupt film like
Godzilla, Pi proves that a good script should cost a lot more than
special effects.  Perhaps, with a larger budget, Pi would not have been
as good -- I can see how this story could have been ruined by special
effects.  Instead, we have an idea-driven science fiction film, one that
is both unique and well-developed.  I shouldn't tell you why the film is
so satisfying at the end, but I will say one thing:  understanding
Aronofsky's theme takes nothing more than a brief shot of our heroic
math nerd calmly looking into the clear sky.   </P>
