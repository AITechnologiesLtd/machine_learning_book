<PRE>Ready To Rumble</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Man oh man, this movie had me laughing so hard, tears were running down the
creases of my smile-swollen cheeks. I was just one big baby balling my eyes
out. Now I'm not saying it was one-hunderd-precent, whoop-*ss,
neck-breaking, knee-slapping fun - but a swift kick to the gonads leaves a
lasting impression.</P>
<P>In the spirit of "Dumb and Dumber" (mock me if you will, but I loved that
film!) and more recently "Waterboy," "Ready to Rumble" brings back lovable
idiots to the screen. Stocky sparkplug Scott Caan, who played the charming
beer-minded jock in "Varsity Blues" is given more room to show his acting,
wrestling and funnyboner finesse. ("Blues" was a fine flick as a matter of
fact, though not especially funny.) David Arquette is Scott's "Dumber" in
this silly, innocently heart-warming mockery of a sport that is a mockery
already. (A spoof of a spoof - is that a double negative?)</P>
<P>Scott and David worship wrestling czar Jimmy King (Oliver Platt), and come
to his rescue after he looses his title as well as his self-respect.
Immediately following a few wince-able opening seconds, a surreal wrestling
rumble erupts in a small town convenient store, bringing the first of many
shouts of laughter from this cheering crowd. The sequence as with the other
wrestling scenes are filmed aptly, every power hit will leave you gasping.
Martin Landau even makes an appearance as body-flipping wrestling guru.</P>
<P>But the plot is broader than just rasslin'. David's dad is a hard guy cop
who pistol whips his wussy son into obedience. His reply to David's wimpy
desire to follow his dream, "Charles Manson followed his dream, Joseph
Stalin, Michael Bolton..." There were many other hard hitting punch lines
that I scribbled down, but admittedly they lie rather limp on canvas when
not brought to life by these talented actors and filmmakers. (Makes you
wonder how this script got sold.) In fact, the scene where King returns to
make peace with his estranged wife and kid, had me down for the count in
uncontrollable laughter. After that, it didn't matter that the ending went
more silly than funny or that a fistful of other punch lines failed to set
the teeth a-chattering.</P>
<P>"Rumble" is as funny as a van full of nuns singing Van Halen's "Running with
the Devil." If you love this kind of thing, this is just the kind of thing
you'll love.</P>
