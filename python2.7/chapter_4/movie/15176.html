<P>Apt Pupil: Brad Renfro, Ian McKellen, David Schwimmer, Elias Koteas</P>
<P>   The opening scene of "Apt Pupil" is set in a high school at the end of
   a week of studying the Holocaust in history class. The teacher reminds
   the students that if they want to know more, they can always turn to
   the library.</P>
<P>   Instead, Brad Renfro turns to experiential learning, leading to some
   frightening conclusions.</P>
<P>   Renfro is Todd Bowden, a bright, bored high-school student. Using
   leaps of logic that would impress even the Scooby Doo crew, he deduces
   that neighborhood recluse Arthur Denker (Ian McKellan) is in fact Kurt
   Dussander, who ran one of the Nazi concentration camps during the war
   and is still wanted by the Israeli government.</P>
<P>   For some reason, instead of turning Dussander over to the police, Todd
   blackmails him - firsthand information about the death camps in
   exchange for his silence. "Tell me what the schools are afraid to," he
   pleads.</P>
<P>   As Dussander's tales grow ever more glorious and graphic, Todd grows
   more and more unraveled - having gas chamber hallucinations in the
   shower, doodling swastikas in his notebook, falling behind in school.
   Then he grows truly disturbed, killing birds and the occasional
   homeless man.</P>
<P>   Based on a novella by Stephen King and directed by Bryan Singer (who
   helmed the Oscar-winning "The Usual Suspects"), "Apt Pupil" clearly
   had a lot of potential. King's story, and thus the screenplay, is
   sufficiently spooky if you can wade through the mounds of mediocrity -
   it doesn't get truly suspenseful until the second hour.</P>
<P>   McKellan, winner of multiple film awards, turns in an acceptable
   performance as the despicable Dussander, right down to the faux German
   accent. And the supporting cast, from David Schwimmer to Elias Koteas,
   is right on target as well.</P>
<P>   Renfro, however, is a disappointment. His character seems disturbed
   even at the start of the film, so his descent into depravity has
   little effect on the viewer. This lapse is inexcusable in the key
   character in the film. We should be mourning for his shrinking
   humanity, not for the movie.</P>
<P>   Few would argue that the Second World War and the Holocaust were among
   the greatest atrocities in history. Last weekend though, a new
   atrocity was unleashed upon the world - the mediocre, eminently
   forgettable "Apt Pupil."</P>
