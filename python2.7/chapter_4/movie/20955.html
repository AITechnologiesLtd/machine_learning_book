<PRE>The Hunch is Back
True Crime</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Clint is at it again. Imperfect reporter (i.e.: ex-drunk, current womanizer,
unable to feel compassion) has nose for the truth. When the newswoman
assigned to a "human interest" death row case dies before the convict --
Clint and his hunch are given less than 24 hours to pick up the pieces and
free the wrongly accused man (Isaiah Washington). Can it be done?</P>
<P>This is the old gritty Clint -- the "Do you feel lucky punk?" Clint. Extra
camera time is given to cigarette lighting and snuffing to remind you that
this is the tough Eastwood of yesteryear.</P>
<P>I was liking it, then it was getting boring, then it got exciting and
interesting and even got me all choked up. Then, in a last minute ditch
effort to save a life, a completely inebriated Eastwood walks his red nose
into the bar door on his way out, drives as fast as he can on a rainy night
(with an innocent passenger), pulls his emergency brake on a particularly
dangerous piece of road in order to set two trailing squad cars spinning
(Dukes-of-Hazard style). I mean, I'm there routing for him to save the death
row guy -- but come on, not at the expense of whacking a couple of officers,
and a jogger in his drunken stupor.</P>
<P>Other than that, some text book foreshadowing in the form of a green crayon
and crying child could have used some toning down.</P>
<P>Oh, and James Woods is absolutely wonderful as Eastwood's Chief Editor. He
plays the same hardball, yet light-hearted, lovable character that he played
in "Hercules" the animated feature.</P>
<P>Starring Isaiah Washington, Clint Eastwood and James Woods.
Directed by Clint Eastwood.
Produced by Richard & Lili Zanuck at Zanuck/Malpaso and Warner Brothers.
Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B-</P>
