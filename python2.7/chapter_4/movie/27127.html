<PRE>"Family Man" – Not a Wonderful Life
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>In the romantic comedy, "Family Man," Jack (Nicolas
Cage) is blessed with a second chance to see how his
life would have turned out if he'd gone ahead and
married his college sweetheart, Kate (Tea Leoni).  He
actually left Kate long ago, putting his career ahead
of love.  And now, he has become a
master-of-his-own-universe, investment banker.  But
thanks to a chance encounter with a mysterious angel
(Don Cheadle), he is offered a glimpse into this other
life where he is her devoted husband, father of two,
and the proud owner of a sorely-in-need-of-a-tune-up
minivan.  </P>
<P>With this setup, a few burning questions arise.  Are
there any lessons that Jack can learn about himself? 
Did he make the right choice leaving Kate all those
years ago?  Most importantly, will his outlook be
changed in such a way that it will make him a better
man?  These are the answers that I had wanted to know
because the premise of the film follows in the vein of
"It's a Wonderful Life" and "A Christmas Carole."  But
in this uninspired screenplay, neither path that Jack
chooses really provides him with the fulfillment that
he personally seeks.  As a result, the movie doesn't
provide the sentimental charge that it seems to want
to deliver, and what we're left with is a lackluster
story whose title should have been called: "Either
Life is OK".</P>
<P>Needed to create the required impact is to see that
Jack is actually better off with Kate.  But is he?  In
real life, Jack is a high finance wizard who is the
midst of orchestrating a gigantic merger.  With his
business savvy and charisma, his company as well as a
slew of women revere him.  Yes, he's a slave to his
work and he even toils on Christmas Day.  Yet, having
a walk-in closet filled with $2000 suits and an exotic
car doesn't seem all that bad.  Meanwhile, his 'dream'
existence puts him into the lifestyle of a
middle-class, blue-collar salesman at a tire store
where the highlights of his week are shopping at the
Burlington Coat Factory, bowling with the guys, and
eating funnel cakes.</P>
<P>This isn't really anybody's idea of a better life, is
it?  But, it is made all the more tolerable thanks to
Kate, his adoring wife.  Tea Leoni gives a robust
performance in what may be the only bright spot to
this film.  She's affable and having the chance to get
back together with her would be hard to pass up.  </P>
<P>But this speaks to another shortcoming, which is the
lack of chemistry between Cage and Leoni.  They give
good individual performances but we don't buy into
their romance.  Even as Jack develops his first-time
sense of belonging and sharing, as a couple, they
don't seem to connect.   There's a lack of tenderness.
 It's missing the spark that is needed to emotionally
draw in the audience.</P>
<P>The most appealing aspect is the film's
lightheartedness, which mostly focuses on the fact
that Jack WAS a person that had everything, but is now
a blue-collar, child rearing, 'have-not.'  Watching
him report to work as a mag wheel salesman for Big
Ed's Tires is a hoot.  Yet, for the film to have risen
above an otherwise humdrum romantic comedy, Jack's
catharsis needed to be more remarkable.  Is he truly
better off as a family man?  I'm still wondering.</P>
