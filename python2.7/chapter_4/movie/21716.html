<P>     Barry Levinson can safely be called "the master of Baltimore
cinema". He has done exceptional work in the past focusing on this city, from
"Tin Men" to "Avalon" to "Diner". And he has also been able to bring this sixth
sense to the small screen with the mesmerizing "Homicide: Life on the Streets".
It's no wonder Levinson has written and directed yet another film to his
recognized collection. 
"Liberty Heights" follows two generations of an average Jewish family living in
Liberty Heights, Baltimore in the 1950's. The family faces racism and rejection
at the local swimming pool, in the court house, and by the police. The
nostalgia presented is a terrifying look at how are society was function less
than half a century ago. The film contains some hilarious and some heart
wrenching scenes but over length seriously hurts the mood and nothing big
happens to keep the audience truly entertained and attentive. It plays like an
episode of a dramedy television show-however it is like the episode before the
finale, where everything is built up very specifically but nothing huge comes
out of it because it will be shown in the finale next week. However, this is a
movie. There are no episodes and therefore the plot must not only be developed
but something must come out of this development. In "Liberty Heights" there is
no distinct climax.  </P>
<P> The film is broken up into three sections, following three members of
the family. The father, Nate, (Joe Mantegna) runs a strip joint which is not
drawing profits from its desired range of customers. In order to change the
gloomy future of his failing business, Nate decides to add gambling for his
customers to enjoy. This plan, however, backfires when an unemployed man wins
five hundred thousand dollars and Nate is unable to pay. This section of the
movie was the least developed and seemed out of place from the other teen
romance subplots. If Levinson was trying to make the film about the Jewish
family as a whole, then why did he leave out a section focusing on the mother
(Bebe Neuwirth) and her interaction with society? Instead Neuwirth is an
automaton who's only purpose in the film is to comfort or scold the male family
members when they are misbehaving or troubled. 
The oldest son, played by Adrien Brody, is seriously in love with a girl he is
not supposed to go near. After he and his friends sneak into a non-Jewish
party, Brody is swept away by a mysterious girl who he soon after cannot stop
thinking of. This story, at first starts out very vibrant and vivacious, but as
it drags on there are no surprises to maintain interest. Brody is excellent in
another wonderful performance, but the supporting cast is very cliched and
dull. </P>
<P>        Ben Foster plays the youngest son fittingly named Ben. This is
the most interesting of the three stories because it is funny, tragic, and
romantic without one of these elements dominating the others. Ben is a curious
boy who wonders what the world is like outside of the Jewish community. This
curiosity leads to a forbidden friendship with an African American girl played
superbly by Rebekah Johnson. Together they learn more about each other and
about themselves. Racism plays an important role in this subplot as the
characters must fight against it in order to remain bonded. A powerful message
is given by Levinson stating that the youngest generation is the most open-
minded and the most mature. One obvious problem is that Levinson, out of
nowhere, adds a completely unnecessary scene containing, you guessed it, bodily
fluids. Is this a requirement now for films in the 90's? You know there is a
serious problem when a film trying to explain the seriousness of discrimination
adds a scene which can be directly compared to a scene in "There's Something
About Mary."</P>
<P>  Levinson's most recent film contains many superb performances and an
important story line which educates the audience. There were just too many
scenes with no importance and too many characters with no importance. If
Levinson had cut some of these scenes and characters out and had focused more
on creating a better ending, then "Liberty Heights" would have been an
interesting, entertaining, educating movie.</P>
