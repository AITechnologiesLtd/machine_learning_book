Year Released: 1999
A Video Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Those looking for a nice, cute, and funny romantic comedy can stop right here.
Mickey Blue Eyes is another movie that examines the Mafia with a comic flair,
the first film of these kind being Analyze This. Since this film is PG-13, we
miss out on a lot of the things that made Analyze This a great movie. (Heavy
use of the f-word, shootings, etc.)  Not to mention that this film centers
itself on being a romance rather than just a funny comedy.</P>
<P>Michael Felgate (Grant doing his usual bumbling English thing that has served
him so well in the past) is an auctioneer who thinks that he’s finally found
the love of his life. He’s known Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn) only three
months, but plans to pop the question to her at dinner. He does, and she’s
horrified, she says that he can’t marry her, even though she loves him. She
runs away. Michael goes searching after her for a reason.</P>
<P>It turns out that Gina’s father is Frank Vitale (Caan) who is the head of a
local crime family. Gina says that no matter how you resist, they will somehow
get you to join their crew, and she doesn’t want that to happen to him. But
sooner or later it does. Michael is forced to auction off a terrifying painting
created by one of the Mafia men, only to have it bought back by the same men of
organized crime. This money laundering scheme is just the beginning. Soon
Michael is disposing of dead bodies, auctioning off even more interesting
paintings, and is posing as a thug from Kansas City named Mickey Blue Eyes
(hence the film’s title).</P>
<P>Everyone in the film plays well off one another. James Caan goes throughout the
entire picture looking as if he’s slightly lost, but still does a good job in
the movie. Jeanne Tripplehorn has a throw away role as the woman who will still
forgive Michael after all he’s done. But Hugh Grant (who was in Notting Hill
with Julia Roberts and other English productions) is the star of the show, and
his antics (surprisingly) can carry an entire picture. Joe Viterelli (who
appeared in a very similar role in Analyze This) also has a great supporting
performance.</P>
<P>This is a very simple film that takes it’s premise and twists it every
possible way that it can. For this reason, I think that it can never get more
than a B+, but I still enjoyed it. Much of the humor just keeps getting crazier
and crazier, and while we’ve seen most of the stuff here before, (the film is
nowhere near groundbreaking), the movie is still a whole lot of fun. Rent
Mickey Blue Eyes tonight, and enjoy a couple of laughs.</P>
<P>Overall Grade: B                 Rated PG-13 for brief strong language, some
violence and sensuality.
The Young-Uns: This film contains two f-words and some other language. There is
also a heavy focus on lying and shooting people. There are also  some shooting
scenes, but they won’t be hard for anyone to handle. Good Age: 12 and up</P>
