<P>PLOT:
Parody film of mob movies, this picture basically laces the GODFATHER
storyline with that of Martin Scorsese's CASINO. A son of a big-time mobster
must take over his father's "business" after his dad's untimely death. He
does the right thing, and then whisks off to Vegas to handle the casino
business.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Hit-and-miss comedy, scores some chuckles on certain parodies done well, but
falls flat on most of its sight gags, lame jokes and uninspired story line.
This is one of those "stupid comedies" like AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN
series, in which everything and everyone is used as a target for a gag or a
crack. I generally love those kinds of flicks, but this one just didn't
muster enough laughs for it to deserve a solid recommendation. And that's
besides the fact that it failed to recognize plenty of other mafia films
which could have made this movie all that more enjoyable to a wider audience
(Leaving GOODFELLAS out is just a sin). As it stands, this film might prove
itself worthy as a weak video night rental for fans of the genre, just to
enjoy a few lazy grins alongside a six-pack of beer (Another plus: It's only
83 minutes long). For everyone else, go out and rent either AIRPLANE I or
II, and prepare to double-over in idiotic laughter.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This film is dedicated to actor Lloyd Bridges, who died shortly after
shooting this movie.
Originally titled JANE AUSTIN'S MAFIA!
Director Jim Abrahams also directed such stupid comedies as AIRPLANE!, TOP
SECRET! and HOT SHOTS! And HOT SHOTS! Part Deux.</P>
