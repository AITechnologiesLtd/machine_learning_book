<PRE>EVOLUTION
---------</PRE>
<P>Glen Canyon Community College's biology students are thrilled to be getting A's
from their disillusioned professor, Dr. Ira Kane (David Duchovny).  
(Unbeknownst to all, Kane's a former Army scientist, fired and disgraced over 
an experimental anthrax vaccine he administered to troops with dire results.)
When Kane's friend and colleague, geology professor and women's volleyball coach
Harry Block (Orlando Jones, "The Replacements") gets called to investigate a
meteor crash site, Kane goes along for the ride.  Kane begins to smell a 
nobel when he finds ooze coming from the meteor.  Twenty-four hours later,
though, what they have on their hands is a serious case of extraterrestrial
"Evolution."</P>
<P>Three writers (David Diamond & David Weissman and Don Jakoby) are creditted
with coming up with this unfunny, totally unoriginal piece of screen fodder
which creates a danger that pits the military against our inept heroes
in their efforts to overcome it.  The special effects team, led by Phil
Tippett ("Jurassic Park," "Starship Troopers"), provide a bunch of creatures
ripped right out of director Reitman's overrated "Ghostbusters."</P>
<P>"Evolution" is made almost tolerable by the easy chemistry between stars
Duchovny and Jones, a terrific pairing offunny guys with very different
styles in search of a funny script.  Julianne Moore, however, should be ashamed 
of herself for playing a character who's supposed to be funny because she falls 
down and walks into doors a lot.  Seann William Scott ("Road Trip") is a third
wheel aspiring fireman dumbell who exists to be made fun of.  Ethan Suplee,
so fine in the recent "Blow," does stupid fat schtick as one of Kane's 
students.</P>
<P>Director Reitman, creditted by star Jones as "one of the great comedy directors
of all time" in the press notes, has made exactly one good movie ("Dave")
and a few semi-amusing ones ("Stripes," "Meatballs," "Ghostbusters") largely
due to the talents of the likes of Kevin Kline and Bill Murray.  "Evolution" 
bottom feeds with his "Legal Eagles," "Twins" and "Junior" oeuvre.</P>
<P>The film's insulting climax features our mismatched team of misfits underneath
what looks like a painted dropcloth (it's supposed to be the underbelly of an
alien) to insert a product placement enema via firehose.  Enough said.</P>
