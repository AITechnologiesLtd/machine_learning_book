<P>MISSION TO MARS (M).  
(Hollywood Pictures/Buena Vista International)
Director: Brian De Palma
stars: Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Jerry O'Connell, Connie Nielsen, Don 
Cheadle, Armin Mueller-Stahl (uncredited)
running time: 113 minutes.</P>
<P>A poor man's 2001?  Despite having a larger budget than
Stanley Kubrick and access to more modern technology, Brian De Palma's
sci-fi thriller about the first manned space mission to Mars seems
disappointingly second rate.</P>
<P>In the year 2020, NASA sends the first manned space mission to
explore the surface of Mars.  But when an inexplicable disaster wipes
out the crew, a hastily assembled rescue mission is launched.
Astronauts Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins and Jerry O'Connell (from Sliders,
etc) lead the mission under the watchful eye of an uncredited Armin
Mueller-Stahl.  Even their mission does not proceed smoothly as a
variety of disasters befall them before they uncover the secret of
what happened to the first landing crew.  They also encounter
intelligent alien life and learn the secret of life on earth.
Something of a cross between Chariots Of the Gods, Close Encounters Of
The Third Kind and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Mission To Mars aims to be
more of a serious sci-fi adventure exploring grand themes rather than
the typical action film with spectacular space battles and exploding
death stars.  This leads to some rather boring moments throughout that
will test the patience of many within the audience.</P>
<P>The script, from Jim and John Thomas (Predator, etc) and
Graham Yost (Speed, etc), occasionally becomes laden with excessive
jingoism and schmaltz.  The special effects are sometimes quite
impressive, and the visual effects from the ILM team are stunning. It
is obvious that De Palma and his production crew have studied
Kubrick's classic, as some elements here (such as the revolving
spaceships) echo 2001.  They get the nuts and bolts and intricate
technical details of space travel right.  But the brilliant visuals
are small compensation for the overall lack of pace and excitement.
De Palma's direction here lacks his usual intensity, and it seems as
if he is uncomfortable with the demands of a special effects driven
film.  Even normally strong performers of the calibre of Sinise and
Robbins seem confused and ultimately defeated by the demands of the
film and the cluttered narrative.</P>
<P>Mission To Mars explores questions regarding the origins of
life on earth, but somehow it lacks the vision, complexity, cinematic
style and sense of extraordinary wonder of Kubrick's seminal classic.</P>
