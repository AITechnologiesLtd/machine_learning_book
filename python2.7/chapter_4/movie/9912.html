<PRE>Seen on 15 October 1997 with Linda at the Cineplex Odeon Metro for
$6.50</PRE>
<P>The theme of a special persn who keeps a fractious family together is
certainly nothing new; nor is the theme of the loving Grandmother.  *Soul
Food* is able to make these tried and true ideas seem fresh and special.
Narrated by young Ahmad (Brandon Hammond), he comments that "Big Mama"
(Irma P. Hall) had a way to let you know you were her favorite. He also
realizes that she was able to make everyone feel that way. He also tells
us she had no enemies; if she did, she would just invite them over for
Sunday Dinner and the enmity would be buried under heaping helpings of
collard greens and egg pie (to name but a few).</P>
<P>The Sunday dinners, the family house, and the effort Big Mama puts into
maintaining both help keep her three daughters from continuous fighting. 
Teri (Vanessa Williams) is a driven attorney married to another attorney
(Miles, played by Michael Beach of ER) who wants to quit and become a
musician. Teri never misses an opportunity to remind Maxine (Viveca Fox,
playing Ahmad's mother) how much money she contributes toward their
mother. However, Maxine is recognized as "the strong one." Bird (Nia
Peeples) is married to an ex-con (Lem, played by Mekhi Phifer), and is
running her own beauty salon with help from Teri.</P>
<P>Rounding out the family are mysterious and unseen Uncle Pete, the hermit
upstairs who takes his meals upstairs, and the ironically named Faith
(Gina Ravera--who gets to show more of her talent here than in Kiss the
Girls), Big Mama's screw-up niece who is a stripper turned serious dancer,
and whose arrival means trouble for a few people.</P>
<P>Without giving away too much of the plot, I can say that a crisis spurs a
variety of problems to devolve horribly--problems that probably would have
been avoided if people just spoke to each other. </P>
<P>Along the way, a lot of issues are explored: unemployment, male-female
relations, the importance of family and role models, and having dreams,
however simple they might be. The movie tempers its dramatic moments with
a lot of humor, and even stops twice to provide some musical moments. A
real lump-in-the-throat moment was shattered when Linda leaned over and
said, "Here's where you lose it, right?" (She was right.) There really is
something for everyone in *Soul Food*.</P>
<P>*Soul Food* earned a respectable number-two spot at the box office its
first weekend at theatres. This is especially respectable when you
consider how much profit was made compared to the special effects fiesta
that was in the number-one slot: The Peacemaker. While it obviously grew a
large black audience, it has also drew large audiences in general. The
theme of having a special relationship with a loving Grandmother and
Matriarch is a winner, and when it is done without heavy-handedness like
it was in *Soul Food*, a good time will be had by all. </P>
<P>There is also a nice little Soul Food Website at
