 Warner Bros./Morgan Creek 
 Director: Hugh Johnson
 Writer:   Drew Gitlin & Mike Cheda
 Cast: Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Peter Firth, David
Paymer</PRE>
<P>   "Chill Factor" rips off the basic premise of Jan De Bont's
1994 nonstop action picture "Speed."  In that eye-popping
spectacle, Keanu Reeves plays an elite SWAT-team cop who
is targeted by a psycho mastermind (Dennis Hopper), and led
onto a city bus triggered to explode if its speed descends
below 50 miles per hour.  Similarly in Hugh Johnson's thriller
"Chill Factor," menacingly blue crystals to be used for
chemical warfare must be kept on ice as they are
programmed to detonate when their temperature climbs to 50
degree Fahrenheit.  The plot focuses on a terrorist who is
determined to make off with a single canister of the powerful
device--which, if set off, could literally melt down every
inhabitant in a large city and then some--and to auction the
crystals off to the country with the highest bid beginning at
$100 million.</P>
<P>   Dazzling stunts, nick-of-time heroics, and big stakes come
with the territory of action-adventure movies.  Any big-studio
director can stage a few good vehicle crashes (though some,
like John Frankenheimer for "Ronin," could set new standards
for the cliche).  Any qualified stunt person can scale rocks,
turn acrobatic somersaults and leap through fire.  What
makes an action movie stand out are characters who make
sense, villains with clever dialogue, and plots ("Breakdown"
for example) that deviate from the routine.  "Chill Factor" has
the eye-popping stuntwork and some dazzling Utah scenery,
but the dialogue is particularly clunky, the heroic team lacking
in chemistry and credibility, and most of all the story is hitched to 
that same ol' paint-by-the-numbers race against the clock.  Hugh
Johnson, making his debut as a feature-film director,
unashamedly throws in one of the hoariest of cliches, the
villains who lose out because they talk too much while they
have the potential heroes facing the barrels of their guns.</P>
<P>   Let's assume that the powers who today hold onto some of
the most devastating weapons of war are all reasonable
people, at least smart enough to know that using their
arsenal of major firepower would be suicidal. We still must
confront the possibility that madmen could seize some of the
nasty stuff from their keepers.  In "Chill Factor," a half-crazed
army major who is thrown into Ft. Leavenworth prison for ten
years for an incident he did not trigger is determined to get
revenge on his country by purloining a weapon so lethal that
a simple canister could painfully end millions of lives.
The story opens on the Pacific territory of Horn Island
where the U.S. army is engaged in covert operations, testing
an agent of chemical warfare designed to cremate people for
miles.  Though the test is supposed to cover a very limited
area, an error by scientist Dr. Richard Long (David Paymer)
unleashes all the fury of the device known as Elvis,
destroying the entire island and killing eighteen servicemen. 
Major Andrew Brynner (Peter Firth) takes the rap and is
sentenced to Ft. Leavenworth prison for ten years while Dr.
Long, whom the major considers too valuable a person to
incarcerate, is free to continue his research.  When Brynner
is released at the end of his sentence, he sets out with
accomplices to steal the weapon and to sell it to the country
that bids the most, but is repeatedly frustrated by the efforts
of two average fellas, ice cream truck driver Arlo (Cuba
Gooding, Jr.) and drifter/hamburger-flipper Tim Mason (Skeet
Ulrich).  As the crazed Brynner chases Arlo and Mason
across a good deal of Montana (actually filmed in some of
the country's most scenic areas in Utah), the two heroes in
the ice cream truck bond as they face the usual obstacles:
dumb redneck-issue sheriff and his silly accomplice; vicious
dog; failing motor; dangerous cliffside roads; villains with
bazooka and determination.</P>
<P>   Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives a manic performance which
presumably was thought to be comical but is actually an
embarrassment.  His character, Arlo, issues such manifestos
while under the stress of the chase as, "I shoulda let that dog
bite me...I coulda got rabies and I coulda went to the hospital
and had a pretty nurse."  As Tim Mason, Skeet Ulrich has
that determined look of a man who is doing a wonderful
service for his country as he plans to foil the villains using the
home-spun philosophic advice taught to him while fishing with
his mentor.   Dr. Long, his fishing companion, warned him:
"Power without caution is death--turn the power of the hunter
against him," while scheming to catch the trout with some
specially designed bait.</P>
<P>   Like so many of its predecessors, "Chill Factor" features a
race against time.  A Fahrenheit thermometer is attached to
the chemical bomb to warn its keepers to keep the canister
chilled below 50 degrees.  This bomb is so smart that it
knows to detonate at exactly that temperature. When the dial
says 49.9 degree (as you knew it would), the bomb behaves.
How is this weapon so intelligent that it would inevitably
discharge in just one more tenth of a degree?  Fortunately for
it and for the 3 million people in Seattle who owe their lives to
two average guys, the weapon is smarter than those
responsible for this derivative, uninspired film.</P>
