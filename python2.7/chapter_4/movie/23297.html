<P>        For every thriller like "The Usual Suspects" or "The Sixth
Sense" that can pull off a spectacular surprise ending, there are half a
dozen like "Reindeer Games" that work themselves into a sweat trying to
cram in twist after twist. After "Suspects" or "Sense" wrap up, you can
replay the movie in your mind and put all the pieces together, but when
"Reindeer Games" runs its course, you'll probably be wondering why you
bothered sitting through the film in the first place.</P>
<P> You know you've wandered into a bad movie when the finale
begins with the bad guys preparing to do away with the hero, then
stopping just long enough to engage him in a long-winded conversation in
which the villains carefully explain every step they took in setting up
their wicked scheme. All this blather, of course, gives the hero several
minutes in which to figure out how he's going to escape and kill his
captors. In "Reindeer Games," Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) has what seems
like a week to get away from the nefarious Gabriel (Gary Sinise) and his
partners; suffice to say, theirs was an extraordinarily complicated
plan.</P>
<P> The film was written by Ehren Kruger, who did a swell job of
ruining "Scream 3" by packing the last reel with absurd action and
ridiculous last-minute revelations. In "Games," the denouement involves
more double-crosses, false identities and dirty secrets than you'd find
in an entire library of Raymond Chandler novels, and you can bet no one
is going to mistake this mess for "The Big Sleep" or "Farewell, My
Lovely."</P>
<P> Rudy, the closest thing to a real person in Kruger's world, is
fresh from prison and anxious to hook up with some hot chocolate and
pecan pie before going home to his family. Instead, he connects with
Ashley (Charlize Theron), the former pen pal of his now-deceased cell
mate. Aside from her mile-long false eyelashes and ugly coats, Ashley
also brings with her a vicious brother named Gabriel, who wants Rudy's
help in robbing an Indian casino.</P>
<P> On its way to the big heist, "Games" wobbles uncertainly
between suspense and spoof, mixing harsh violence with awkwardly
inserted comedy. If director John Frankenheimer was hoping his film
might be mistaken for a Quentin Tarantino opus, he was sorely mistaken.
Tarantino's screenplays have a good deal more depth and color than
anything Kruger can whip up.</P>
<P> Although Affleck and Sinise are reliably solid and Theron does
everything in her power to make the best of an unplayable role, no one
should have bothered wasting their energy. These "Games" were not worth
playing in the first place. James Sanford</P>
