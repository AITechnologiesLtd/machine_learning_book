<PRE>AMERICAN PIE</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Paul Weitz
Written by: Adam Herz</PRE>
<P>Think back to the year 1981, when one of the raunchiest comedies of
all time hit theaters. That comedy was, of course, Bob Clark's now
infamous "Porky's". I'd actually recommend that anyone who loved
"American Pie" go back and catch "Porky's" to see how a comedy like
this can be made even more amusing. I suppose the biggest difference
between these two sex comedies is that "American Pie" is basically a
safe film. It may not seem this way at first glance, but relative
newcomer Paul Weitz does not make his film as raunchy as it could have
been. He even tries to stick some moral messages in near the end of
the movie. Bob Clark, on the other hand, took no prisoners with his
film. "Porky's" is as obscene as possible with an R rating. By playing
it safe, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz have managed to sap a lot of
potential humor out of their film.</P>
<P>Four high school friends have just made a pact to lose their virginity
before graduation. Jim (Jason Biggs) is willing to try just about
anything, with any girl, to fulfill his obligation. His latest plan is
to bed the exchange student, Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). If that plan
fails, his backup is the school's nerdy band member, Michelle (Alyson
Hannigan). Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) is trying to get his long time
girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), to finally sleep with him. However,
this will involve him saying the three most dreaded words he can think
of. Oz (Chris Klein), a rugby player, has decided to take the
sensitive approach by joining the school choir to gain the affections
of Heather (Mena Suvari). Last we have Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas),
who is so stuck up that he won't even go to the bathroom in the
school's facilities. His plan is to start rumors about how great he is
in bed so that every girl in the school will be crawling all over
him. The friends' put their plans into motion, but time is running
out, and it looks like everything is going to come down to prom night.</P>
<P>Despite what you may have heard, "American Pie" is not a very
offensive movie. I'm not saying it doesn't have its cringe worthy
moments (like a scene where something which shouldn't be drunk is
placed in a cup of beer), but the movie is far too good natured to
seriously offend anyone. This is too bad because "American Pie" had
the potential to be one of the funniest movies of the past few
years. For example, a scene in which Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan
get together starts off uproariously funny, but it is cut short before
reaching its full comic capacity. This happens in an unfortunate
number of scenes. The big laughs are promised, and are nearly brought
to the screen, before Weitz chickens out and alters the course of the
film towards safer ground.</P>
<P>"American Pie" is the sort of movie used to showcase young
talent. Half the cast members will never move on to greater things,
while the other half will be in important, dramatic films a few years
from now. Mena Suvari has obviously already begun her transition by
appearing in the excellent "American Beauty". Even with a script as
shallow as this one, Suvari already displays some amazing emotional
range considering her age and experience.  Alyson Hannigan, who is
already famous for playing the cutsey Willow on television's "Buffy:
The Vampire Slayer", gives a hilarious performance in what is really a
very small part. While the remaining cast members give adequate
performances, the only other standouts are newcomer Jason Biggs and
Eugene Levy ("Multiplicity"), as Jim's dad. Levy's character is one of
the few who grants us some real belly laughs by awkwardly trying to
help his son understand the birds and the bees - so to speak.</P>
<P>Actually, the lack of any big laughs is one of my biggest problems
with "American Pie". There are some movies which contain very few big
laughs, but cause you to chuckle the whole way through, like 1998's
sadly underrated "Rushmore". "American Pie" may have a few chuckles
but not enough to sustain the movie through its 95 minute running
time. I'm sure "American Pie" will be a huge hit with teenagers who
are too young to remember "Porky's" and too old to settle for typical
teen fare. I know, it has an R rating, but I'm not naive enough to
believe that every highschool student in America isn't going to see
this movie. I'd recommend "American Pie" to those desperate for a new,
raunchy comedy since Hollywood hasn't put one out in quite some
time. I give the movie three out of five stars.</P>
