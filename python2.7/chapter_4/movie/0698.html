                               by Hal Render
                        Copyright 1990 Hal Render</PRE>
<P>     I thought I'd post brief reviews of some good films I've seen recently on
video.  (The release dates I've given are approximate, by the way.)</P>
<PRE>Scale:  ***** Buy it.
         **** Rent it more than once.
          *** Rent it once. 
           ** Rent it on special (maybe).
            * Back off, man, this one might go off.</PRE>
<P>HOUSEKEEPING (1989) ****
  A Bill Forsyth film, this is a touching, amusing story of two orphaned girls 
  who come under the supervision of their eccentric Aunt.  Beautiful
  cinematography and great performances by the leads, esp. Christine Lahti.</P>
<P>THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY (1979) ****
  Gripping, complex British gangster movie, with great work by Bob Hoskins 
  and Helen Mirren in the leads.  Warning: those who have trouble understanding
  heavy accents (particularly Cockney) may want to avoid this film.</P>
<P>MIRACLE MILE (1989) ****
  A sleeper from last year, this story mixes romance, suspense and the threat
  of nuclear war in a very different, very engrossing film.  (To tell more
  would spoil too much of the plot.)  Stars Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham.</P>
<P>MR. NORTH (1989) ***
  One of the last films produced by John Huston, this is the film version
  of a Thornton Wilder story (if I remember right).  It tells the story of
  Mr. T. Theophilus North, an engaging young man with some unconventional 
  ideas and a peculiar physical ability to store static electricity.  Despite 
  the good performances and an interesting setting (ritzy Rhode Island during 
  the 20's or 30's), the story on this one never really drew me in.  I can only
  recommend it to fans of the period and the people involved.  Stars Anthony 
  Edwards, Robert Mitchum, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, Anjelica Huston, 
  Harry Dean Stanton and others.</P>
<P>HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING (1989) ****
  A very weird, very funny comedy about the tribulations of a British Ad
  exec who just can't figure out how to sell a new acne cream.  The stress
  gives him a problem that makes the average case of pimples seem desirable.
  Wonderful performances by the leads none of whom I knew except for Rachel
  Ward who has quite overcome her early typecasting.</P>
<P>THE LION IN WINTER (1967) *****
  A classic that tells the story of "family ups and downs" on Christmas 
  day 1183 in the household of King Henry II of Britain.  An enthralling 
  character study, this film has incredible performances by Peter O'Toole 
  and Katharine Hepburn, with solid support from Anthony Hopkins, Timothy 
  Dalton and others.  This film has probably the overall best dialogue of 
  any movie I have every seen, so good that I watched it twice in a row just 
  to try to remember some of it.  Hepburn deservedly won an Oscar for her 
  performance.  If you haven't seen this film, by all means try to do so.</P>
<P>PRICK UP YOUR EARS (1988) ****
  A solid British drama, this film describes the tragic relationship between 
  playwright Joe Orton and his lover, Kenneth Halliwell.  The film
  covers Orton's rise to success and the emotional struggles of Halliwell 
  to adjust from his early start as Orton's mentor to his later role as 
  Orton's "personal assistant."  Very well acted by Gary Oldman, Alfred
  Molina and Vanessa Redgrave.  (Note: the film may bother those who have 
  a problem with an open depiction of homosexual relationships.)</P>
<P>PASCALI'S ISLAND (1989) ****
  Set just before WWI, this film tells the story of Basil Pascali, a "local 
  character" on a Turkish-governed Greek island.  Basil makes a meager living 
  on the island as an interpreter and government intermediary for residents 
  and tourists.  Basil is also a "career informer" for the Turkish Imperial 
  government, and has been sending secret reports for the last 20 years.  The
  film details a sequence of events that may either expose Basil or allow him 
  to leave a life that has lost meaning for him.  Ben Kingsley (one of my 
  favorite actors) is excellent as Basil, Charles Dance does a fine job as the 
  archaeologist, and Helen Mirren is very good as Basil's best friend.  </P>
