<P>`Thomas Crown' – An Affair to Remember</P>
<P>The summer is getting crueler everyday.  As temperatures and humidity
rise, it becomes tougher to find relief from the hot weather.  Perhaps,
our only salvation may be the local Cineplex where we can recline in a
nice chair in a comfortably air conditioned theatre.  But what is there
to see?  I don't want to be mesmerized by swirling special effects.  I
don't want to be sitting on the edge of my seat as fear courses through
my body.  I don't want to watch a comedy.  Just give me an
old-fashioned story that's clever and stylish.  Just give me a film
where the strength of the characters is what carries the film.  Just
give me a film that satisfies from beginning to end.  Just give me `The
Thomas Crown Affair.'</P>
<P>Cool, slick and fun to watch are how I would characterize this remake
of the 1968 classic (then-starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway). 
Here, we see the ever-suave Pierce Brosnan playing the
millionaire/thief and the formidable Renee Russo as his adversary. 
Thomas Crown has got to be every woman's (and probably a lot of men's)
fantasy.  He's rich, handsome, and put the ‘class' in classic. 
Impeccably dressed and a shrewd businessman, he knows what he wants and
has the means to get it.  What can his money not buy?  The answer is a
priceless Monet painting that he so adores, which hangs at the heavily
guarded museum.  An elaborately engineered and extremely clever heist
is pulled.  The improbable theft brings Catherine Banning (Russo) to
town.  She works for the agency that insures the irreplaceable art
piece.  And if she can locate it, she'll be rewarded with a $5 million
finder's fee.  It doesn't take too long before she is convinced that
Crown is her man.</P>
<P>Crown is no wimp.  He teases her, charms her, and practically dares her
to find the painting.  Banning is up to the task.  She receives some
help from the local police detective (a surprisingly terrific Dennis
Leary), but for the most part, she employs her own brand of sex appeal
and smarts to get the job done.  Banning makes it very evident that she
is quite confident in her abilities (and not just her investigative
abilities).  You'll see her at a formal party dancing in a sheer black
dress that shows that she doesn't favor any sort of undergarments.  And
she'll sunbathe in the nude without even thinking twice.  Indeed,
Banning is sexy, smart, and strong.  It's refreshing to see such a
strong female character.</P>
<P>The screenwriters do a fine job of creating two wonderfully competitive
characters, both of whom do what they can to stay one step of the other
person.  Both Brosnan and Russo have amazing screen presence.  The
balance of power swings back and forth like a pendulum, but the movie
hums along as both Crown and Banning take immense satisfaction in the
chase.  An attraction develops and both find themselves faced with the
ultimate challenge.  Both want the Monet.  Both want to keep each
other.  But you can't win one without losing the other.  Handsome to
look at and fun to watch, `The Thomas Crown Affair' is the perfect
summer escape.</P>
