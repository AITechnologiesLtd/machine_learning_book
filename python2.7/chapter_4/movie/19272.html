<P>Early in "Arlington Road," terrorism expert Michael Faraday (Jeff 
Bridges) shows his college class a series of horrific images 
reminiscent of the Oklahoma City massacre, then discusses the 
public's willingness to accept the notion that one man could be 
responsible for such atrocities. "We don't want others," he explains. 
"We want one name and we want it fast, because it gives us our 
security back." That's a genuinely disturbing idea and a great way to 
start a movie. "Arlington Road" also boasts a corker of a closing 
scene that is both shocking and thought provoking. If only the parts 
in-between were as good.  </P>
<P>Writer Ehren Kruger's script is the main offender, lobbing an absurd 
number of coincidences at the audience. While most thrillers demand a 
certain suspension of disbelief, Kruger asks viewers to completely 
disengage anything even faintly related to logic. His contrived plot 
stretches credulity further than those amorphous thrillers that pay-
cable channels run in the wee hours of the night. Director Mark 
Pellington doesn't help matters much. Determined to create a 
nightmare-in-suburbia feel, he throws in so much gimmicky lighting 
and skewed camera angles that major portions of the film play like a 
parody of "The Twilight Zone." </P>
<P>Remember "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," the "there's a monster on the 
wing of our airplane!" horror tale featured in both the TV and movie 
versions of "The Twilight Zone?" In their respective takes on the 
lead role, William Shatner and John Lithgow stammered, twitched, 
jerked and shrieked in deliciously over-the-top performances that 
nicely complimented the outrageous story. Unfortunately, Pellington 
directs Jeff Bridges in the same way here, with embarrassing results. 
Bridges, normally an outstanding actor, must escalate from grieving 
husband to hysterical loon under Pellington's leering camera. 
Bridges' performance is not a pretty sight.  </P>
<P>Set in a upscale suburb in Northern Virginia, the film centers around 
Professor Faraday, who tries to carry on a normal life with his young 
son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark) and girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), 
while still grieving the loss of his wife, an FBI agent killed during 
a botched raid. After rescuing an injured neighbor boy (Mason Gamble),
 Faraday becomes friends with the boy's parents, Oliver and Cheryl 
Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack). On the surface, the Langs seem 
like a typical all-American family, but Faraday begins noticing 
peculiarities in their wholesome appearance. Suspecting they may be 
part of some extremist group, he begins examining Oliver's background,
 seeking help from Brooke, as well his wife's former partner, Whit 
Carver (Robert Gossett). They both have strong misgivings about his 
mission and counsel Faraday to drop the investigation. After all, 
what are the chances that a terrorism expert, who lost his wife in a 
terrorism-related raid, would end up with terrorists living across 
the street from him? </P>
<P>Good question. While the film flirts with the notion that Faraday may 
simply be paranoid, it's obvious where things are going, thanks to 
Pellington's ham-handed direction. Oliver and Cheryl Lang peer 
ominously from windows and half-opened doors. They make cryptic 
remarks, clumsily try to block Faraday from looking at blueprints, 
etc., etc. Hell, the monster on the wing of the plane in the 
"Twilight Zone" story was more subtle than these two.</P>
<P>Mark Pellington is a talented man. He took big chances with his first 
film, "Going All the Way," and turned out an extremely dark, faithful 
adaptation of Dan Wakefield's caustic coming-of-age novel. But he 
shows no finesse here, devoting too much time to arty shots of 
shadows and light when he should have been adjusting the screenplay 
to make the plot seem more credible. Instead, we get people popping 
up on the lead characters at just the right time to startle them and 
the audience, regardless of how improbable their arrival might be, 
and we get an incredibly elaborate plan that could not succeed unless 
the conspirators had a psychic awareness of upcoming totally random 
actions on the part of several key individuals. </P>
<P>Despite such fundamental problems, "Arlington Road" does contain some 
rewards. Tim Robbins gives a good performance and his personal code 
of honor is one of the film's most fascinating elements. Joan Cusack 
and Hope Davis do what they can with their characters, but the women 
are given short-shrift by the screenplay. </P>
<P>Faraday's early statement to his students is a powerful one, 
reinforced by the surprising twist at the end of "Arlington Road." As 
such, even with its ludicrous screenplay and overwrought lead 
performance, the film still manages to pack a punch. Had the script 
been rewritten with an eye toward making the plot mechanics more 
plausible (even in light of the closing revelations, the Lang's 
behavior and many crucial elements of the grand conspiracy remain 
patently unbelievable), and had Pellington and Bridges worked 
together on toning down Faraday's histrionics, this could have been 
much more than just another popcorn thriller.</P>
