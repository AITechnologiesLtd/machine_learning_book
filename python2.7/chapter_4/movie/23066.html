<P>In criticising the failures of contemporary Chinese society,
director Zhang Yimou (Raise The Red Lantern, etc) prefers to use an
iron fist enclosed in a velvet glove.</P>
<P>Although his films have been widely acclaimed internationally,
they have been less than favourably received at home by his political
masters, who have banned them in China.  His latest film is also bound
to earn the wrath of Chinese authorities, wary of any overt criticism
or hint of failure of their great social revolution.</P>
<P>Based on a true story, Not One Less depicts the very real
problems facing China's education system.  Much of the film is set in
the primary school of the rural village of Shuiguan.  The school
itself is run down and under-resourced, and the teacher is badly paid.
The teacher even has to carefully ration chalk and other supplies to
make them last.  Thirty students are crammed into one dilapidated
classroom.  Alarming statistics tell us that 1.5 million Chinese
children are forced to leave school every year, many at a young age,
to find work to help their parents pay off their mounting debts.</P>
<P>When the school's regular teacher Gao has to go to the city to
visit his sick mother, the mayor appoints thirteen year old Wei Minzhi
as his replacement.  Because of declining class sizes, Gao promises
her a bonus if no student leaves the school during his absence.
Barely older than her charges, and lacking a university education
herself, Wei has little idea of what to do, and seems unconcerned with
whether the students actually learn anything or not.</P>
<P>Then Zhang Huike, one of her students, is forced to head off
to the city to find work to support his desperately impoverished
family.  Wei heads off to the city to find him and bring him home.
But in the harsh, unfamiliar environment of the sprawling city, Wei's
task is not an easy one.  Initially it is unclear whether Wei is
acting out of genuine concern for the welfare of her charge or out of
personal self interest.</P>
<P>Yimou beautifully draws a sharp contrast between the
prosperity of the modern cities and the abject poverty rife throughout
much of rural China.  Although young Zhang is impressed by the beauty
and prosperity of the city, his most indelible memory is that he had
to beg for food.</P>
<P>This is a simple story, elegantly and beautifully told.  Not
One Less lacks the histrionics of most American films depicting the
decline of the education system (187, The Principal, The Substitute,
etc) and painting American schools as some sort of urban battle zone
in which there are few winners.  Yimou's sense of restraint and
understatement is evident in the deceptively gentle pace and rhythm of
the film.  The film also looks gorgeous, thanks to the cinematography
of Hou Yong.</P>
<P>Yimou deliberately uses non professional actors here, with
many of the performers virtually playing themselves, which adds to the
overall sense of realism.  The young Huike has a natural, appealing
screen presence, while Wei captures the petulance, naivete and
desperation of her character beautifully.  There is often a telling
self consciousness about some of the performances, while others seem
remarkably relaxed, unrehearsed and natural.</P>
