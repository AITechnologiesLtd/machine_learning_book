<PRE>Mimic
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Mira Sorvino; Jeremy Northam; Alexander Goodwin; Giancarlo Giannini
& Charles Dutton</P>
<P>Mira Sorvino stars as a bug expert in this science fiction horror film. A
deadly plague, spread by cockroaches, breaks out and is wiping out the
children of New York City. Bug-friendly Mira develops a new strain of bug
using genetic engineering to wipe out the roaches and stop the spread of the
deadly disease. When the killer bugs have done their job they are supposed
to die out, and apparently that is just what happens. Except, a few years
later it seems as though they hadn't all died, and those that survived have
evolved into something big and nasty and have multiplied quite rapidly. Now
they are living down in the sewers and old subway tunnels under New York,
and emerging when they get hungry to prey on the human population above
ground. To make matters worse, these overgrown insects have developed a
unique kind of camouflage which enables them to pass themselves off as
humans long enough to easily lure their prey into being a human happy meal.
It then is left up to Mira, her boyfriend and a New York transit cop to stop
the insects.</P>
<P>Nothing about Mimic really makes it any different from any other monster
film that I have ever seen. The special effects are pretty good in terms of
the big bugs, but they certainly don't reach out and grab you (pardon the
pun). They are nowhere near the groundbreaking quality of the original
Alien. I will give the film points for the nifty concept of the bugs
developing the camouflage to pass for human. That alone is one of the more
original ideas that I have seen in a film of this nature. It makes it stand
out just a bit more in a genre that sadly lacks a whole lot of original
ideas. I'll also give Mimic points for a showdown between Sorvino and
friends against the bugs, which takes place in abandoned subway tunnels
under the city. It is one of the better sequences that I have seen in a
while in a horror flick.</P>
<P>Sorvino also deserves some praise as the heroine of this movie. While she
doesn't quite compare to Sigorney Weaver in the Alien films, she does manage
to hold her own while doing battle with her mutated creations. And, on a
purely sexist male note, she looks damn good doing it. The rest of the cast
is competent, but no one really distinguishes himself or herself. With the
possible exception of Charles Dutton, playing the subway cop who becomes a
less than eager tour guide to the bug busters as they make their way through
the subways.</P>
<P>Mimic is the type of movie that you rent on a Saturday night for some light
entertainment. Just don't rent it with real high expectations. It's far
better than most of what you are likely to find on the shelves of the horror
section of your local video store, just don't expect it to become a classic
any time in the near future.</P>
