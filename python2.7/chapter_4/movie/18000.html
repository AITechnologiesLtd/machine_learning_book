<P>You wouldn't think that a Canadian production combining elements of
science fiction, horror, gore, and mathematics
would come together into an entertaining film.  But in Cube, it does.</P>
<P>The premise of Cube is very similar to an episode of "Star Trek:The Next
Generation," but without the predictable
TV series ending.  Six strangers find themselves trapped inside of a
giant cube filled with smaller cube-shaped
rooms.  Certain rooms are trapped however, so it's not so easy to find
an exit.  To counter this, each person
seemingly possesses certain skills to help proceed through the maze and
find their way out.  But then to counter
that, each person also seems to be able to hold the group back.  So why
are they there?  Who's there to help and
who's there to hinder?  Will they be able to escape?</P>
<P>Normally I don't like movies that don't explain themselves, but
sometimes vagueness can be done well (for example,
nothing in the movie Tremors was explained, but it was still
entertaining).  The same goes for Cube.  Nothing is ever
explained.  You won't ever know what's going on, but yet it's still
entertaining to watch.  It's fun to watch the
characters try and figure out the situation that they are in (and you
have to admit, being trapped in a giant cube is
pretty original).  Some of the character's motivations towards the end
started to bug me a little bit (one character
in particular seems to overreact to the situation much more than
expected), but it all ultimately blends together
nicely into a vague yet compelling experience.  [R]</P>
