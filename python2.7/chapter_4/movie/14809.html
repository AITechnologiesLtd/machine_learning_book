<P>     BELOVED doesn't feel like a typical Oscar-hyped fall "prestige
release," full of cathartic emotion and earnest dignity.  Its opening
minutes portend something quite different:  two silent exterior shots, one
tracking through a graveyard and the other establishing a rural Ohio home,
shift to a scene of sheer supernatural terror.  Inside the home, a woman
named Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) and her three children cringe in fear as the
family dog spins through the air, an eye torn out and a leg broken by an
anguished spirit.  We learn that the entity is the ghost of another
daughter, who has haunted the house long enough for the latest event to
drive the two boys away from home.  So much for earnest dignity; this is a
prestige release as American gothic horror film.</P>
<P>     That shouldn't be terribly surprising coming from director Jonathan
Demme, who turned 1991's THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS into an Oscar-winning
prestige release.  Yet this is no more a conventional thriller than it is
a conventional epic drama, though it incorporates elements of both.  The
bulk of the film takes place eight years after that prologue sequence,
when the arrival of two strangers shake up the isolated lives of Sethe and
her remaining daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise).  Paul D (Danny Glover), a
former slave with Sethe on the Sweet Home plantation, provides a
companionship Sethe hasn't known for years.  The other arrival is more
mysterious, a child-like woman calling herself Beloved (Thandie Newton).
Their interaction, interwoven with selected flashbacks, turns BELOVED into
a complex ghost story in which the ghosts take on many forms, attacking
both from without and from within.</P>
<P>     It's what BELOVED does with the idea of a ghost story that made Toni
Morrison's novel so powerful, and makes Demme's film so gripping.  The
true horror in the story is Sethe's past, the painful and humiliating past
of all slaves which involved so many horrifying events.  Most film-makers
would have taken those events and shown them off with sincere indignation.
The images created by Demme and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto are jittery
and chilling, designed more to invade the sub-conscious than to inspire
tight-lipped head-shaking.  Beloved appears initially as a sort of
earth-spirit, covered with insects; the bright ribbons of a family
celebration become a lingering symbol of decayed hopes.  With Oprah
Winfrey effectively conveying Sethe's hollow-eyed resignation, BELOVED
shows how a tormented past can corrupt the present to the point that it
feels perpetually haunted, holding meaning only as a constant reminder of
unforgettable evils.</P>
<P>     If BELOVED had intended merely to shock and dismay, it would have
been a very shallow and disspiriting experience.  Instead, it becomes a
call to the living to dare existing in the present, conveyed through two
supporting characters marvelously performed.  Kimberly Elise takes Denver
on a journey from trying to re-capture her own past -- treating Beloved
both as her own child and as the sister she never knew -- to shaking
herself and Sethe into a desire for survival.  Stronger still is the
bright angel of the deceased Baby Suggs (Beah Richards), Denver's paternal
grandmother and the spiritual leader of her community.  Her glorious
sermons, which call all around to celebrate their bodies even as they
acknowledge sorrow, provide stirring punctuation for this tale.  As
counterpoint to Sethe's inability to forgive herself, Baby Suggs enjoins
her listeners to "kiss your hands; love your heart."</P>
<P>     BELOVED is such a side-ranging story that it's bound to feel slightly
disjointed at times.  The flashback to Sethe's escape from Sweet Home
feels particularly drawn out, slowing down a nearly three-hour film.  It's
impressive, however, that three different screenwriters could create so
cohesive an adaptation.  Demme infuses BELOVED with the feverish intensity
of a recurring nightmare, then leaves us with hope of awakening to a new
day.  There is emotion, yes, and dignity; there is also evil, and even
horror.  I can only think of one way to categorize a film like BELOVED:
it may be the most uplifting horror film you'll ever see.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 immortal beloveds:  9.</PRE>
