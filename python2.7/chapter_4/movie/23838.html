<P>   "I Dreamed of Africa" is based on the autobiography of
Kuki Gallmann, a privileged white woman who left her home
in Italy to travel with her new husband to his ranch in rural
Kenya.  The central thrust of the story is that the world does
not really possess a garden of Eden.  When you travel, you =</P>
<P>have yourself with all your hangups as a companion: the
literature of psychology is loaded with texts about how you
cannot escape from yourself.  Furthermore in Kuki
Gallmann's case, the very dangers of Africa were to cause
great hardship and tragedy to her family, perhaps beyond any
misadventure she would have experienced had she continued
to inhabit her privileged life in Europe.</P>
<P>   The author, who still lives on that ranch and who set up a
foundation dedicated to the conservation of the continent's
resources, is the subject of a film directed by Hugh Hudson
which appears a sincere attempt to remain true to Gallmann's
actual life and adventures on the continent.  Unfortunately
that earnestness is the problem with the movie.  As we watch
Kim Basinger inhabit the role of the resourceful Kuki, dealing
with both her joy in being able to change her life and her
spirit in coping with family disaster, we are privy to virtually
no real adventure.  A situation involving the calamity brought
about by a large, poisonous snake which her son had cruelly
kept in captivity along with other, non-venomous reptiles, is
such a variation from the languid, National Geographic-like
tone, that we are startled for the only time during the course
of the 113-minute, virtually humorless drama.</P>
<P>   Contrast this film with one that inevitably comes to mind for
comparison, "Out of Africa."  That 1985 film directed by
Sydney Pollack and featuring the superior acting of Meryl
Streep as Baroness Karen Blixen--a Danish woman who
marries her lover's brother--is chock full of the intensity
missing in Henry Hudson's staid adaptation of Kuki
Gallmann's book.  To borrow the opening paragraph of
Robert Ebert's "Out of Africa" review: "....there was a moment
when a lioness seemed about to attack, but did not....Now
the lioness seemed about to charge, when behind her a calm
voice advised the baroness not to move one inch.  'She'll go
away," the voice said, and indeed the lioness did skulk away
after satisfying its curiosity."  This bit of luck does not last for
long, however.  At another point, a lion charges from another
direction and the baroness must drop the big cat with one
shot that must not miss."</P>
<P>   Since none of these confrontations ever occurs on the
ranch owned by Gallmann's husband, we're left with simply a
sedate and sober travelogue with stilted dialogue (husband
and wife talk to each other as though they were composing
Hallmark cards) and confrontations which are set up but
never executed.</P>
<P>   "Out of Africa" takes place when East African countries
were attracting European settlers who were bored with their
lives in Europe in the years around World War I, where they
flocked to the highlands of Kenya with cool air and the
possibility of raising cattle.  "I Dreamed of Africa" gathers its
momentum some time after that.  In the story, Kuki Gallmann,
an attractive, widowed woman of some wealth, is almost
killed in an auto accident on an Italian road.  At that point, the
poor little rich girl decides that she "has stopped growing"
and, having married Paolo (Vincent Perez), she takes leave
of her frightened mother Franca (Eva Marie Saint), gathers
up her adorable little boy Emanuele (Liam Aiken) and heads
to Paolo's Kenyan ranch to start a new life.  =</P>
<P>   Though Kuki ultimately sets up a foundation for
conservation, we see no other evidence of the "growth" she
seeks, but we must trust her own words when she says that
she continues to find great joy in her move from her urban,
cultured civilization to a place in which her dog is killed by a
lion roaming just meters outside her home, her husband is
badly hurt in a hunting accident and later mugged and
beaten, she is left alone for several days at a time as her
macho man heads out with his pals into the jungles with their
rifles, and a terrible fate befalls her only son.  =</P>
<P>   If we did not know any better, we might suspect that this
film--shot largely in South Africa but also in parts of Kenya
and in Italian towns like Asolo and Vicenza--was made as a
propaganda piece in favor of white supremacy on the dark
continent.  The two principal servants of the household look
up to the owners as though they were gods; private planes fly
them at their will, in some cases to transport their growing
boy to a British-style prep school, in others to access help
during emergencies.  In one case, Paolo gives some swift
kicks to one or two men who have been captured by the
Kenyan police for poaching, a gesture which--while showing
us that poaching is a vicious crime--could make us wince at
the racial implications.  Kenya is, after all, not the land of the
white man.</P>
<P>   Kim Basinger is freighted with labored dialogue and
appears in virtually scenes as though she had just emerged
from a four-hour session at Revlon's in New York.  "I
Dreamed of Africa," which to Kuki is on balance a wet one, is
a nightmare that could cause many a potential tourist to
cancel his safari reservations.  We must simply trust Ms.
Gallmann, who at one point relates by e-mail to readers of
her book, (<A HREF="mailto:gmfkenya@africaonline.co.ke">gmfkenya@africaonline.co.ke</A>), "Africa is healing,
because it still has what most of the world has lost, and in its
ancient beauty and wisdom, in the mystery of its nature and
extraordinary people, one can find a purpose."  When she
talks to her husband or to her son, she sounds like this, too.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 2000
