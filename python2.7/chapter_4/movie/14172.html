<PRE>Paths of Glory (1957)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 82</PRE>
<P>"Paths of Glory" is an excellent anti-war film
that dramatizes the enormous gap between the
enlisted men who do the fighting and the officers
who take the credit.  "Paths of Glory" was banned
in France for many years, but the story, based on
a true incident, is timeless and can apply to any
military or political situation.</P>
<P>The setting is France in 1916.  World War I
has dragged on for two years, and become a
stalement of fortified trenches and heavy
casualties.  Commander Broulard (Adolphe Menjou)
asks General Mireau (George Macready) to
have his decimated division take the "Ant Hill",
an impregnable fortress, promising Mireau
a promotion if he succeeds.</P>
<P>Mireau orders Lieutenant Dax (Kirk Douglas) to
carry out the mission, which is a complete failure
with heavy casualties.  To place blame elsewhere,
Mireau then orders the court martial for cowardice
(under penalty of execution) of three arbitrarily
chosen soldiers (Ralph Meeker, Joseph Turkel and
Timothy Carey).</P>
<P>Douglas is perfectly cast for the role.  He
seethes with indignation throughout.  Emile Meyer
gives an excellent performance as a priest.
Macready, whose character is a pompous jerk,
is also excellent.  There are only a few battle
scenes, but they are well done.</P>
<P>"Paths of Glory" isn't perfect.  Bert Freed's
alcoholic sergeant character is a bit muddled.
The three unlucky soldiers show extreme
cowardness and bitterness prior to their
execution, especially pathetically sobbing
Carey.  And perhaps the depiction of military
brass as cynical, ambitious and self-serving
is a little overdone.</P>
<P>Directed by Stanley Kubrick, "Paths of Glory" was not
a box office success, and was not nominated for any
Academy Awards.  Kubrick and Douglas teamed up again
three years later for "Spartacus", an inferior but
much more successful film.  Kubrick would make
another anti-war film, "Full Metal Jacket", thirty
years later.</P>
