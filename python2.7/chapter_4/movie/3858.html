                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1995 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Larry Clark
Written by Harmony Korine</PRE>
<P>     With his debut feature, Larry Clark has made an unpleasant film
about a few repulsive characters who lead a fairly irredeemable
existence.  Premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, it
provoked a hailstorm of accolades from critics who latched onto its
uncompromising style and raw vision of (mostly) white urban American
youth.  Even the film's rating created a ruckus, with Disney subsidiary
Miramax first appealing the obviously unavoidable NC-17 and then
creating a new company (Shining Excalibur) to release it unrated.  The
hype machine has turned the movie's release into something of an event,
daring audiences to come stare into the abyss that is young America.
Unfortunately, while the flick itself lives up to its billing, it
doesn't deliver much else.</P>
<P>     The story is pretty thin.  Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) is an obnoxious
kid who brags about his knack for seducing virgins (we see him having
sex with one in the movie's very first scene).  Casper (Justin Pierce)
is his pal, slightly more sympathetic because he's something of a
straight man to Telly's obscene vocal meanderings.  Jennie (Chloe
Sevigny) is one of the girls Telly has deflowered, and when she tests
HIV-positive, she sets off across New York City on a quest to catch
Telly--the only sexual partner she's ever had--before he screws again.</P>
<P>     Not that we're given the impression that Telly would stop having
sex, or even start wearing a condom, if he knew he had the AIDS virus.
At one point, he remarks in voice-over that sex means everything to
him, and his worldview is so nihilistic that concern for someone else's
life is probably beyond him.  In fact, KIDS reminded me of another
relentlessly despairing New York cult film, LIQUID SKY.  In that movie,
a character is bemused and pleased by her ability to kill people by
having sex with them, and it follows that Telly might get a similar
macho thrill out of having a secret weapon at his disposal.</P>
<P>     Another movie KIDS bears a passing resemblance to is A
CLOCKWORK ORANGE, where Alex and his "droogs" get hopped up at the
Korova milk bar and then go out looking for a fight.  That movie
shocked audiences with jubilant scenes of violence and then posed
questions about whether or not Alex could be reformed by the state.
But there is no state in KIDS.  The police aren't a concern, and the
parents are absent or ineffectual.  This state of mind regenerates
itself in a tight cycle, as we see the younger counterparts of these
kids hanging out at the same parties, experimenting with drugs and
trying their best to talk tough.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of KIDS is a scene in Washington Square park,
where a rowdy gang of skateboarders, including Telly and Casper, taunt
first a gay couple and then a man whom they proceed to beat within an
inch of his life.  That's the moment where the characters lose our
sympathy completely, and we realize how much damage stands to be done
by these loser kids.  And then there's a great scene right after it
where the kids strip down and go swimming in the middle of the night,
showing themselves off to each other (a pair of girls along for the
ride kiss just to make the boys crazy).  It's the closest thing to an
innocent good time these characters have, even though Telly is scheming
on his next conquest through it all.</P>
<P>     As a realistic portrait of those bleak teenage years, I guess
KIDS should get high marks.  The music is just right.  The actors, who
aren't professionally trained, do a great job inhabiting their roles,
and Harmony Korine's screenplay goes a long way toward creating this
film's naturalistic feel.  KIDS is mostly well-directed, even though
some shots go on forever, striving for realism but instead dulling the
senses with pseudo-documentary stylistics.  Jennie is the closest thing
we have to a sympathetic character, and even she is violated in the
neat-but-predictable denouement.</P>
<P>     Critical reaction to the film has been almost worshipful, and
as best I can figure out, that's for two reasons.  One is that the film
is supposedly a "wake-up call," and I guess it serves that purpose for
folks who haven't yet figured out that this world is populated more and
more by selfish, disenfranchised youth who get their kicks from drugs,
sex, and casual cruelty.  The other is that the film is a contemporary
tragedy, telling the story of young people with no direction, no
family, and nothing to look forward to.  It's admirable that the film
avoids moralizing, and that it is frank, brutal, and honest.  I'd like
to see it spur serious debate about the plight of young people in our
society.  But KIDS remains more satisfying as an event than as a
movie.  We barely feel for these kids, and that's a big part of why
this movie seems nearly as empty as the lives it depicts.  That might
be exactly the intention here, but I'd argue that makes for
questionable drama, and mediocre movies.</P>
