<PRE>                   A REVIEW OF "AFFLICTION"
                        by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>You should be open-minded when you walk into movie theatres.
It's not fair to pre-judge films and remain closed to the
possibility that you actually might like it. For instance, I
thought that when I finally saw the hyped-up Oscar-winner, "The
English Patient", I would hate it, but it was excellent and
enjoyable. So, yes, preconceived notions can hinder a reviewer
and make the review seem much less credible. Having said all of
that, I strolled into the theatre to see "Affliction" and winced
when Paul Schrader's name appeared as the director. Sorry, but
the ol' mind was a little closed here. The screenwriter of "Taxi
Driver" and "Raging Bull", Schrader seems to have a fixation on
showing every form of the sordid side of society. I think "Taxi
Driver" is highly overrated and the violence is gratuitous. I
hold Schrader responsible.
        Well, if that film is about urban paranoia, "Affliction"
must be about rural paranoia. This is a typical Schrader story of
the seamy underbelly of human life. It probes the emotions and
feelings of its characters very well until the rather abrupt
finale that leaves something to be desired. There's no subtlety
to the conclusion and the film is not as poetic as it tries to
be. It's actually too obvious what they're trying to say with the
metaphors of alcoholism and dealing with pain. However, I hate to
give a poor recommendation to a film that could win two acting
Oscars. So I won't. This is a film worth seeing, if only for Nick
Nolte and James Coburn, who could each win their first trophy
(Nolte for lead actor and Coburn for supporting). The
performances are great, but the movie is unsatisfying.
        The story features Wade Whitehouse (Nolte) a bitterly
divorced father of a little girl and the small town's spineless
cop. He also works as a snow-removal guy. His life is an absolute
mess. His daughter says she loves him, but can't handle being
around him. His girlfriend, Margie (Sissy Spacek), is
sympathetic, but she is unable to positively affect his life.
Willem Dafoe, who narrates and plays his brother, Rolfe, has left
the small Maine town to make a life for himself and forget about
the bad childhood memories he left behind. And that leads us to a
man (James Coburn) who is a cinch to walk up the steps on Oscar
night for his cruelly outstanding supporting performance as
Wade's father, Glen Whitehouse. For this unrepentant role of a
selfish old drunk, and for his lengthy (yet unrewarded career),
Coburn is due.
        When Wade and Rolfe were young, their father verbally abused
them and even resorted to violence. This contemptable man grows
old, not caring that he has scarred Wade inside more than his
punches ever could. Wade tries his best not to be a bad man, but
he is failing. He is a loser and the only thing preventing him
from becoming just his drunken father in the first half of the
film is a desperate attempt to cling to his sanity.
        After an inexperienced hunter is found shot while out with
Wade's friend and co-worker, Jack Hewitt (Jim True), Wade
suspects that the death was a murder conspiracy with several key
players--including his own boss. He sets out to prove it, making
wild accusations, losing his job, and alienating his girlfriend
and daughter. Meanwhile, to add to Wade's troubles, his mother
dies because of his father's uncaring negligence, causing Wade to
move back in and take care of the old bastard.
        This is supposed to be a character study and it certainly is
that. For a little while, it actually looks like a serious
"Fargo". But, towards the end, it takes a hard turn and Wade
collapses into such despair and desperation that he clearly
becomes his father. He fights that transition, but in such a weak
script it's inevitable. I can't say more because that would
reveal too much, but I have one suggestion (which is obviously
months too late!)--the very last image in the film should be of
Nolte's defeated face. After all, he's the thrust of this
slow-moving tale.
        Nolte could take home the golden prize on Oscar Night,
Coburn probably WILL for his years of fine work, and they both
deserve to win. These are definitely characters we care about, no
matter what horrible things they do or say. We want to see what
will happen to them. However, this film is neither enjoyable nor
as intelligent as it wants to be. A better director would have
found a better hook to make the story as unforgettable as its
subjects.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Paul Schrader also directed "American Gigolo". If
I ever review that piece of trash, it will get one of the very
rare 0/10 ratings I'll EVER give. There is NO reason for people
to see that film (and I usually give at least SLIGHT
recommendations!).</P>
<PRE>This film gets a 6/10.</PRE>
<PRE>THE RYAN RATING SYSTEM SAYS...
10/10--absolutely outstanding
 9/10--excellent
 8/10--pretty darn good
 7/10--sure, go on and give it a peek
 6/10--so-so; ye ol' recommendation point
 5/10--not quite worth the dollars
 4/10--only if you have a free pass
 3/10--don't go, PLEASE don't go
 2/10--avoid even if you DO have a free pass
 1/10--"Showgirls" territory; truly crappy
 0/10--bang your head off a wall instead</PRE>
