<P>In the late seventies, when (or shortly before) Margaret
Thatcher took office in her first term as Prime Minister, the
British government embarked upon an apparently harder line
toward the IRA and its imprisoned volunteers than had 
previously been adhered to.  In the words of the film, the
government adopted a three-pronged policy of "isolation,
criminalization, and demoralization."  "Isolation" referred
to a policy of geographical containment under which the
British set up a system of road blocks and closures to
hamper the movement of the IRA throughout Northern
Ireland.  "Criminalization" referred to a policy under which
IRA prisoners were denied previously held "special category"
status as political prisoners and, instead, were treated by the
criminal justice system as criminal terrorists.  "Demoralization"
referred to a policy of breaking the will and the morale of
imprisoned individual IRA volunteers and of the organization
as a whole.</P>
<P>SOME MOTHER'S SON, a docudrama, focusses on the
criminalization and demoralization prongs of that policy,
although the story is set in motion by the isolation prong.
As such, the film telescopes into the time frame of its story
various events that actually occurred in Belfast in response
to the British hard line.  These events culminated, as the film
culminates, in a prisoners' hunger strike in the Maze prison
between March 1 and October 2, 1981.</P>
<P>Twenty-one prisoners went on the strike, and ten of them died.
Of the ten, only one was sentenced to a life term.  (Terry George
states on the film's web site that, had they lived, all of the nine
non-lifers would have been released by 1987.)  Among the dead
was Bobby Sands, beautifully played in the film by John Lynch.
Sands was a prominent IRA member and a leader, within the
prison, of the hunger strike.  During his prison term, he was
elected to Parliament.  He was a member of Parliament when
he died.</P>
<P>The strike didn't end until the mothers of the remaining striking
prisoners exercised their powers as their sons' legal guardians
and authorized medical intervention to save their sons' lives.
By doing so, these women effectively took their sons off the
hunger strike.  Of course, the dilemma faced by each of these
women was horrendous:  By saving their sons' lives, they
betrayed their sons' convictions and destroyed the cause for
which their sons had fought so long and hard in the first place.</P>
<P>Thus, the film centers on the common dilemma of two mothers
whose imprisoned sons have joined the hunger strike.  On the
one hand, there is Annie Higgins, played by Fionnula Flanagan.
Annie is a farmer's wife and dedicated IRA supporter.  By the
time the film opens, one of her sons has already been killed by
the British and her remaining son Frank, played by David O'Hara,
is an IRA fugitive from justice.  Her third child is her fabulous
smart-mouthed, quick-tempered, red-headed daughter named 
Theresa who takes after Annie.  On the other hand, there is
Kathleen Quigley, played by Helen Mirren.  Kathleen is a teacher
in a Catholic girls' school.  She is politically uninvolved to the point
of naivete, but she hates the IRA for the violence for which it stands.
Like Annie, she has three children, two sons and a daughter.
Unbeknownst to her, her elder son Gerard, played by Aidan Gillen,
is an IRA volunteer.  Her younger son, as shown by a brief but
illuminating moment in the film, may or may not grow up to
emulate his older brother.  Her older daughter, played by
Geraldine O'Rawe, has her hands full just coping.  Both mothers
are the mainstays of their families:  Annie's husband is quite
elderly and physically unable to work.  Kathleen is a widow.</P>
<P>The film follows the gradual leftward politicization of Kathleen
after her son Gerard's arrest, trial, and conviction on a charge
of attempted murder.  Annie's son Frank, tried jointly with Gerard,
is also convicted.  Both young men are sent to the Maze to serve
their sentences.  The courtroom scene in which these events take
place is highly sensational and quite moving in its brutal brevity.</P>
<P>When Gerard immediately joins the series of small ongoing protests
conducted by all the IRA prisoners in his cell block, Mirren portrays
Kathleen as having no choice but to resort to political action to pro-
tect and ensure his welfare in prison once the authorities begin
retaliating against the prisoners.  In effect, his cause becomes
her cause, and she takes it up lovingly and ungrudgingly.  The
film realistically charts her progressive politicization in a way 
that smoothly and efficiently advances the story.  Along the way
she engages in her own small rebellion against her Catholic school
employer and its principal, the formidable and implacable Sister
Bernardina (the nightmare nun of everybody's Catholic school
education in the fifties and early sixties).</P>
<P>Concurrently with Kathleen's political progress, and equally real-
istically, the film charts the progress of the budding friendship
between Kathleen and Annie.  The two women begin as openly
hostile to one another.  They then gradually warm up to each
other, bond very closely, and then gradually come a bit apart
again.  This progression features, among other things, a hilarious
car ride along a beach that is meant to be funny, despite the fact
that it stands for more than it is.  Structurally, these personal
developments are woven into Kathleen's political development,
because it is Annie, whose political convictions and activism
are in place by the time the film begins, who involves Kathleen
in specific political activities.</P>
<P>Eventually, the series of protests at the prison lead to the hunger
strike, which both Kathleen's and Annie's sons join.  From this
moment forward, both women move into the center of a mael-
strom of the competing interests of the three major players in
these events:  The IRA, the British government, and the Catholic
Church.  The IRA is represented by Danny Boyle, the head of
Sinn Fein in Belfast.  Well and strongly played by Ciaran Hinds,
Boyle is a fictional composite character, not the least part of
which is probably Gerry Adams.  Boyle stubbornly and aggres-
sively supports the prisoners' cause and serves as their repre-
sentative in the outside world.  The British government is
represented by a ruthless counter-terrorism law enforcement
official (whose scenes are often intercut with newsclips of
Thatcher advocating her government's line), who is determined
to break the backs of the prisoners and who, to that end,
pursues a zero-tolerance policy and a stance of non-negotiation.
Steering a middle ground between these extreme factions, yet
supportive of the prisoners, is the Catholic Church.  Initially,
the Church is represented by the head of the Catholic Church
in Ireland, the cardinal who comes to the Maze to say Mass
for the prisoners.  Horrified at the conditions he witnesses there,
he immediately holds a press conference, to the extreme
embarrassment and consternation of the government.  However,
more often, more prosaically, and less dramatically, the Church
is represented by Father Daly, the local parish priest, who has
the heart-breaking tasks of giving the last sacrament to dying
hunger strikers and presiding at their funeral Masses.</P>
<P>Ultimately, each mother, Kathleen and Annie, holds the life
of her son in her hands and must make the decision to let
him live or watch him die.</P>
<P>All of the performances in the film are strong, accurate, and
(with a few exceptions) beautifully understated.  Mirren is
fabulous.  Her Kathleen has a touching diffidence, a surprising
naivete, and great quiet courage.  She also has flashes of humor
that are a tribute not only to Mirren's acting, but also to George's
direction and Sheridan's and George's writing.  Flanagan, whose
character undergoes no political changes throughout the film, has
ostensibly less to work with.  However, because the depth of her
character's personal changes is arguably greater than that of
Kathleen's, she alternates brilliantly between hardened political
ideologue and blooming, softening private person.  In a fabulous
piece of acting, her physical appearance reflects these develop-
ments by actually changing from within in front of the camera.
Hinds, whose strong, quiet presence defined the character of
Frederick Wentworth in PERSUASION, is an incredibly compelling
screen presence here.  His Danny Boyle also radiates strength,
but of a steely, threatening, potentially explosive kind.  As such,
his character is as implacable as that of his British anti-terrorist
counterpart -- and that of Sister Bernardina's, to boot.  His char-
acter is, unfortunately, rather underwritten, especially since it
appears that at least one of the real-life characters of which his
is a composite had a greater hand in the prison protests than
the film conveys.  Finally, the actors -- Aidan Gillen, John O'Hara,
and John Lynch -- who portray the prisoners display a stunning
talent that we rarely see in American actors of the same age.
Furthermore, they all have strong film credits.  Gillen was in
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS, O'Hara was in BRAVEHEART, and
Lynch was in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER.  In prison, with
their uncut hair and unshaven beards, these young men have
Christlike appearances.  This imagery is further reinforced by
background shots of anti-British posters depicting a young man
crucified on the Union Jack.</P>
<P>Bill Whelan's folk-based Irish music is a strong and palpable
presence in the film.  Whelan, a record producer and theatre
and television composer, is probably best known as the composer
-- in its entirety -- of RIVERDANCE THE STAGE SHOW.</P>
<P>The film itself is extremely well thought out and therefore very well 
made.  Like Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING, the filmmakers
and the actors know what they're talking about.  Just as DO THE
RIGHT THING conveyed a deadly accurate anatomy of a race riot,
SOME MOTHER'S SON conveys a deadly accurate anatomy of a
political hunger strike in which the lives of twenty-one young men
turn on things like the interpretation of words such as "right" and 
"privilege" regarding what clothes to wear.</P>
<P>Almost nothing is wasted in this film.  Therefore, the smallest
occurrences and visuals, such as an apple swiped from a lunch
or a member of Parliament smoking a cigarette, take on signifi-
cance.  The film opens and closes with a view of the Irish Sea.
In between, and throughout the film, shots of feet on firm 
ground, such as marchers' feet in a candlelight vigil, are
everywhere.  The film also makes sparing but effective use
of slow motion.  Additionally, some of the editing, such as the
intercutting of a portable missile attack with a close-up of girls'
feet doing an Irish hard-shoe dance, is stunningly effective.
Finally, the two principal crowd scenes -- the candlelight vigil
for Bobby Sands and Sands' funeral -- are outstandingly well
done.  (The funeral alone comprised an entire second unit.)
These scenes were not only exceptionally well-choreographed;
they were also extraordinarily moving in a way that crowd 
scenes just usually are not.</P>
<P>Even though the film is essentially a work of fiction, all of the
major events it depicts actually took place.  These include the
hunger strike itself, the various prison protests -- including the
infamous "dirty protest" -- leading up to the strike, the cardinal's
visit to the prison, the election of Sands to Pariliament, the vigils,
the deaths, the funerals, and the secret deals, talks, and negotia-
tions surrounding the hunger strike.  Furthermore, while the
characters in the film, with the exception of Sands and a member
of Parliament, are fictitious, they are all composite characters
based on real people.  It appears that Belfast viewers may be
able to recognize and identify the people on whom the characters
are based.</P>
<P>The film was shot on location in Skerries, a small village north of
Dublin.  Skerries stood in for Belfast, where the principal events of
the film take place.  The Maze, together with its H-blocks where the
prisoners were housed, was recreated in some Dublin warehouses.</P>
<P>The bottom line of this film is the interplay between the personal
and the political in the lives of its characters.  Sometimes the two
are inseparable, sometimes they are in sync with each other,
and sometimes they are at odds with each other.  There is no
question that this film has an explicit republican bias.  However,
there is also no question that the issues raised in the film are
ultimately resolved on personal grounds.</P>
