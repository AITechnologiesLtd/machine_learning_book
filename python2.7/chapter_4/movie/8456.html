<P>Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1997, PG-13, 87 minutes [1 hour, 27 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Mike Meyers (Austin Powers, Dr. Evil), Elizabeth Hurley (Vanessa
Kensington), Robert Wagner (Number Two), Fabiano Udenio (Alotta Fagina),
produced by Demi Moore, Mike Meyers, Jennifer and Suzanne Todd, written by
Mike Meyers, directed by M. Jay Roach.</P>
<P>It's hard to make a good spoof movie these days, probably because anything
can only be parodied once, if at all. Is it any surprise films like "Spy
Hard," and "High School High" have bombed? "Austin Powers" isn't just a bunch
of cliche parodies, but a strange, funny outlook and offbeat comedic style of
its writer and star Mike Meyers.</P>
<P>The film starts out in the campy tradition of any spoof movie by setting up
its premise quickly but doing so in a satirical manner. The setting is 1967
London where we meet Austin Powers (Meyers), an English spy who is just as
popular as the Beatles but seems more like Benny Hill. As women chase him he
starts to dance and everyone joins in, then he runs away while everyone else
must finish the song (once a crowd of people start to dance in synch they
can't stop - that would be against the rules of a musical!). At the same time
we meet Powers' arch nemesis Dr. Evil (Meyers again). Evil is your typical
cartoony villain: he sits at a round table with his cat and associates whom
he gets rid of just because he can. The fact his name is Dr. Evil shows you
how blatant the film is in its satirical nature. To cut to the chase, Evil
escapes by freezing and hiding himself to return 30 years later.</P>
<P>Okay, it's obvious the basic premise of the film is going to be a cartoony
60s-style spy movie set in the present day and therefore all the jokes will
be simply fish-out-of-water right? Technically, this is true, but the film
uses its typical elements an exploitative manner. We get the verbal and sight
gags you'd expect from a film like this, but what's different here is the
fact they don't just exist to make for quick, convenient jokes, instead, they
often become integral parts of scenes, dialogue, and even the general plot. </P>
<P>Many things in movies like this exist only to provide for one joke, for
example, Dr. Evil's number two man is named Number Two (Wagner), but what's
so clever here is the use of this gag doesn't stop there, nor does it repeat
itself. The film makes full use of every possible gag, such as a hilarious
scene in a restroom which I cannot describe, but I will say one of Powers'
lines is, "Who does Number Two work for!?"</P>
<P>Of course what's a comedy and a spy movie without a standoffish female
sidekick who will later fall for the hero? Elizabeth Hurley co-stars as
Vanessa Kensington, Powers' partner who epitomizes that character. Between
scenes in which Austin tries to seduce Vanessa (always failing but always
making for jokes), the two try to find Dr. Evil as he holds the world
hostage.</P>
<P>There's so much comedy and so many jokes in this film it really would be an
injustice to list only a few examples. It's difficult to describe how all the
jokes connect and why they do so. There are times when certain gags start to
wear thin (the carefully choreographed nude scenes for example), but what
keeps them and the entire film from becoming a lowest-common-denominator/live
action cartoon is the witty layer of satire throughout. </P>
<P>What gives "Austin Powers" its edge, originality and enjoyability is Meyers'
witty screenplay. It's nice to watch a comedy and not feel like you're being
pandered to.</P>
