<P>     And it goes something like this:  rednecks rape a little girl; her
black father (Samuel L. Jackson) guns them down in a courtroom; a young
white lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) refuses to budge from the center of a
high-profile, small-town trial; a local chapter of the Klan is formed;
the NAACP comes to town; crosses are burned; riots erupt; tourism to
rural Mississippi plummets to an all-time low; a visiting law student
(Sandra Bullock) flirts; an ambitious District Attorney (Kevin Spacey)
schemes; a crusty judge (Patrick McGoohan) cautions everyone against
grandstanding, which of course they do, while glistening in sheets of
sweat as they attempt to work their high-paid tongues around what must
be a dozen different variations on the traditional Southern accent.  All
that's missing is a cameo from Gregory Peck, y'all.</P>
<P>     As adapted from the John Grisham best seller, A TIME TO KILL is as
shamelessly string-pulling as INDEPENDENCE DAY.  There isn't an ounce of
depth-of-feeling to the characters, but you can project in all you care
to.  (Especially during the racial confrontations, which may be the most
gratuitous depictions that we've seen since MISSISSIPPI BURNING.)  Blame
an over-ambitious story.  The movie runs for about two-and-a-half hours
and it's still too short.  Director Joel Schumacher (working from a
script by his BATMAN FOREVER and CLIENT collaborator Akiva Goldsman)
paints in broad-but-succinct strokes.  The plot merrily churns away and
most people probably won't notice that they are reacting more to the
dramatic devices than to the characters.  No problem.  A TIME TO KILL is
easily the most entertaining of the Grisham films.  The plot makes
sense, the acting is superb, and there's even a minor message delivered
at the very end.  Not bad for a summer movie.</P>
