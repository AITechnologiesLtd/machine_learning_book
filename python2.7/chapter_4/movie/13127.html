<P>   In Franis Coppola's 1986 movie "Peggie Sue Got Married"
Kathleen Turner is transported to her past.  With a knowing
air she notifies her algebra teacher that she found his subject
to be useless, just as she had predicted.  Darren Aronofsky
has another idea.  In the bold, Kafkaesque film "Pi," his
nerdish hero not only finds abstract mathematics relevant: it
dominates his life to such a degree that only a lobotomy could
free his mind from this obsession.  As a renegade
mathematician, Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) has worked for
ten years to prove his epic hypothesis that there is a pattern
to everything which can be reduced to numbers.  More
specifically, he has been trying to outfox the stock market by
documenting its configuration and by doing so to be able
to predict any stock's price on a given day.  His research
draws the attention of two groups as diverse as New York's
Hasidic community and of high-level stockbrokers, equally
intent on gaining access to the code (which they are certain
he has broken) and willing to use bribery and violence to
secure the concealed information.</P>
<P>   Using reverse-image black-and-white film to give the entire
drama a nightmare ambiance, photographer Matthew
Libatique almost literally gets right inside the distressed head
of this mathematician, Max Cohen (Sean Gullette), who
dominates the entire brief movie with his geek-like demeanor. 
Calling himself a private person but in reality a hermit who
simply does not want to talk to anyone but his old
teacher Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), Max has holed himself
up in an ant-infested flat in Chinatown and has turned away
almost all human support.  Not even the seductive neighbor
Devi (Samia Shoalb) can get through his triple-locked door:
she must content herself with leaving the samosas she
regularly prepares for his meals outside. </P>
<P>   "Pi" is so claustrophobic and obscure that its very indistinct
nature is its greatest strength.  Any computer geek who
knows how swiftly time passes when wrapped up in a game,
a calculation, an attempt at creative writing, can relate to
Max's more extreme predicament.  Max is tormented on the
one hand by a Hasidic Kabbalah scholar, Lenny Meyer (Ben
Shenkman), who believes that Max has uncovered nothing
less than the 216-letter name of The Divinity Himself; and on
the other hand by an aggressive Wall Street executive, Marcy
Dawson (Pamela Hart) who is satisfied that Max's
216-number code will divine the prices of stocks for decades
to come.  His only recreation is the game of Go, which he
plays with his equally cryptic old friend, Sol Robeson (Mark
Margolis), who cites Archimedes and can do not better than to
advise Max to "take a bath."</P>
<P>   Following two other movies with strongly Jewish themes to
open this year--Boaz Yakin's "A Price Above Rubies" and
Sandra Goldbacher's "The Governess"--writer-director Dareen
Aronofsky's "Pi" creates a vivid and humorous portrayal of a
streetwide Hasidic Jew, a sham pal who invites Max to
"c'mon, we'll hang out" while determined to pump his fellow
tribe member for information that would hasten the
appearance of the Messiah.  While laying tefillin on the
secular man who is "not interested in religion," he explains
poignantly that the practice brings us closer to God, and to his
credit he will use Max's intelligence for a more noble purpose
than Max's other counterfeit compatriot, who wants only to
makes gobs of money.  </P>
<P>   Aronofksy's frenetic pacing is well served by Oren Sach's
rapid editing and Clint Mansell's rap music, which keep the
film moving along at breakneck speed, a cerebral movie
which paradoxically generates visceral suspense.  We wonder
how the drama will end, whether Wall Street or Williamsburg
will ultimately receive Pi's golden apple.  Most of all we get to
care about poor Max who, after a decade of fruitless research
is driven to hallucinatory insanity just as victory is within his
reach.  You hope that this mad mathematician will learn one
of the great lessons of pop song: "Oh, it's fine to be a genius
of course,/ But keep that old horse before the cart./ First
you've gotta have heart."</P>
<P>   Eureka!  This movie is the ultimate portrayal of the numbers
racket--a slice of pi that as sci-fi fantasy really does cut it and
makes us hunger fort desserts in store as a sequel to this
promising debut by Mr. Aronofsky.</P>
