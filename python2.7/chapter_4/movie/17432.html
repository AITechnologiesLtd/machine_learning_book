YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS (director: Neil LaBute; cast: Aaron Eckhart,
Amy Brenneman, Ben Stiller, Catherine Keener, Jason Patric, Nastassja
Kinski 1998)</P>
<P>LaBute's film is tough to watch, it seems to be more suitable for the
stage, and it is not written for wide audience appeal. It is a story of
the "me only" generation, who inhabit a stylishly fashionable world. The
characters are self-absorbed, greedy, and uncaring. They are consumed by
sex; sex as a power tool for their self-gratification and esteem. The
dialogue is trivial, these characters have little to say, even about
what is consuming them, even though they talk about sex every chance
they get, whether exercising, eating in a trendy restaurant, or in bed.
These 90s characters vaguely remind me of the protaganists in earlier
films, such  as BOB,CAROL, TED, AND ALICE and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA
WOOLF, though these characters are not as amusing or witty. Their
coldness is disturbing, and the framed shots and dialogue of the film is
so successful in capturing this mood, that the film becomes wearisome
and is not a particularly appetizing one. It is safe to say, that this
is not recommended as a date movie!</P>
<P>Aaron is the financially successful corporate man who is sexually
unsatisfied by his attractive wife (Amy). He says masturbation is his
best form of sex. Amy is cast as the sexual object, who attracts all of
Aaron's friends, as she tries to work out her sexual problems. Ben is
the thespian/professor, living with his girlfriend, the dykish
Catherine, who only enjoys sex when there is no talking, she is only
interested in her self-gratification. Ben is the one who has lost track
of his integrity, and appears to be pompous and untrustworthy.</P>
<P>Kinski is the museum worker who becomes Catherine's lover. She is a
tough fit in this story line, since her character is undeveloped. In any
case, she meets all the characters in the story through her job in the
museum, and might even be considered the "nice one," but I think that is
a bit of a stretch, no one is really nice in this film.</P>
<P>There are all sorts of  sexual triangles going on among the couples, as
each one plays out his hang-ups. For one, sex is a means of practicing
his proficiency as a macho man, like it was a game; for another, sex is
a means of finding self-worth.</P>
<P>It is tough to critique this film fairly, mainly because it is not meant
to be an entertaining film, as much as its aim is to be an in-your-face
type of drama. But what it lacks, is the necessary depth it would need
to qualify it as a penetrating drama. Nevertheless, it must be commended
for its rawness and honesty to subject matter. Therefore, viewer beware,
what you see is not pleasant, and what it means to you depends on
whether or not you find that this bitter portrayal of relationships, is
one you agree with, or one that is so one-sided in its perverse view,
that you might feel intellectually compromised by it.</P>
<P>If you see this film on a date, then it might be a good idea to go for
few drinks afterward to talk about it and, hopefully, you don't have the
same bitterness to your partner that these characters do.</P>
<P>It might be of interest to note that LaBute is, of all things, a
Morman... uhmmmm!</P>
