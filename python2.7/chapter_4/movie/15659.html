<P>Let's get the basics out of the way. "The Prince of Egypt" is a well-
acted, great-looking movie. While the animators' attempts to fully 
integrate computer-generated images with traditional drawings are not 
always successful, the story of Moses is still visually sumptuous, aided 
immeasurably by impressive cinematography worthy of a live-action film. 
The sunbaked desert vistas are quite handsome and a few scenes, notably 
the parting of the Red Sea and a raucous chariot race, are dazzling. That 
said, "The Prince of Egypt" is not quite the awe-inspiring epic it wants 
to be.</P>
<P>The film opens with a disclaimer informing viewers that what they are 
about to see is true to the "essence and values" of its Biblical source. 
While preparing the lavish DreamWorks feature, hundreds of religious 
leaders were consulted to avoid stepping on anyone's toes. At the same 
time, the producers tried to avoid excessively pious displays that might 
alienate mainstream audiences. The result is a movie too careful for its 
own good. The filmmakers strive for dramatic grandeur while walking on 
eggshells, and their caution shows up onscreen. </P>
<P>Put simply, "The Prince of Egypt" doesn't know what to do with God. In 
contemporary Western culture, most people try to lead spiritual lives, 
but are vague about religious specifics. We view God in fuzzy terms at 
best, as some benign omnipotent parent, the personification of love. 
Aside from a noisy fundamentalist minority, most people tend to embrace 
the gentle "do unto others" philosophy of the New Testament over the fire 
and brimstone violence of the Old Testament. </P>
<P>All of this left DreamWorks with a dilemma; how to stay relatively true 
to the Moses saga from the Book of Exodus without putting off audiences 
uncomfortable with a wrathful God given to extremely vicious outbursts 
towards those who offend him. Their solution was to put the emphasis 
firmly on the human elements of the story. While the relationship between 
Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses is involving, and the Hebrews' 
quest for freedom stirring, the sheer majesty of a people moving closer 
to the Almighty is muted by the film's cautious approach. During most of 
the story, God plays like a special effect instead of a deity. </P>
<P>The burning bush scene is surprisingly tepid, feeling more like a 
conversation between Luke Skywalker and Yoda than one between Moses and 
God. In one confrontation between the brothers, Moses' walking stick 
turns into a snake and, instead of being awestruck, his brother simply 
has his minions call on their deities to do some stunts of their own. The 
exhibition of dueling magic tricks is too ordinary, just a bit of 
"Fantasia" sorcery with Biblical trappings. Overall, the story comes off 
like a lush animated historical tale of people escaping slavery, 
augmented by nifty special effects, rather than a supernatural encounter 
with an all-powerful presence. Come to think of it, the climax of 
"Raiders of the Lost Ark" had more of a "Holy Cow, we're actually 
witnessing the power of God!" feel than most of this movie. </P>
<P>The extended sequence displaying the parting of the Red Sea is the one 
section of the film that fully realizes its potential as an old-fashioned 
religious spectacular. The great upwards rush of water, an image of a 
whale swimming near the Hebrews and the physical detailing of the ocean 
floor combine for a scene that genuinely looks like a miracle. </P>
<P>If only the rest of the film worked as well. Even the story's other 
visual high point, an exhilarating chariot race, suffers from the awkward 
inclusion of a computer-generated nose falling from a huge statue that 
looks like it was superimposed over the rest of the scene. Throughout the 
feature, contrasting styles of drawing tend to clash. While the humans 
are have a nicely stylized, semi-realistic appearance, many of the 
animals are drawn in the classic Disney fashion. Thankfully, none of them 
talk, although they look as if they could. </P>
<P>For the most part, the film's show-tunes are dull and intrusive. The 
orchestral score incorporates some musical elements indigenous to the 
setting, but the bulk of the music is standard fare. As for the acting, 
an all-star cast delivers uniformly good performances, lending 
credibility to the often-stilted dialogue. Stand-outs include Val Kilmer 
as Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Rameses and Patrick Stewart, using his 
magnificent voice to give appropriate thunder to the imperious Pharaoh.</P>
<P>DreamWorks is promoting "The Prince of Egypt" as a landmark in animation 
and a transcendent experience. I would caution you to lower your 
expectations. The acting, cinematography, and most of the animation more 
than make up for the cheesy songs and occasionally anachronistic dialogue.
 Had the filmmakers made fewer concessions to contemporary sensibilities, 
this could have been a real barn-burner. But they forgot the crucial fact 
that to create a religious epic, God has to make more than a cameo 
appearance.</P>
