<PRE>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</PRE>
<P>A film review by Aileo Weinmann - Copyright © 2000 filmcritic.com</P>
<P>How the Grinch Stole Christmas (a film which should otherwise need no
introduction whatsoever) reminds me of that strange Christmas feeling
that hits about five minutes after all of the presents have been
opened.  It's that indescribable longing for more, even if nothing's
really missing.  There's so much expectation, so much buildup, that
somehow even though you're satisfied, it's not quite enough.</P>
<P>Jim Carrey is fabulous as the titular Grinch, that much is sure.  His
trademark physical antics fit "the mean one" perfectly, without stealing
the heart from one of Dr. Seuss' most notorious characters.  He proves
that he's up to the tall order of balancing two larger-than-life
personalities: himself and the Grinch.  The delicate mix that Carrey
strikes -- giving just enough of himself to the role without
obliterating the creature in the process -- is really the beauty of his
performance.</P>
<P>Overall, the film stays true to the message of Dr. Seuss' original 1957
story and the 1966 animated version, although there's a good deal of
stretching required to make it feature-length.  In this version, from
high atop Mt. Crumpit, the original killjoy is positively disgusted with
all the Whos in Whoville and their happy buzzing in preparation for
Christmas.  So he decides to go incognito to town, in an attempt to
muddle things up a bit, where he runs into Cindy Lou Who (Taylor
Momsen), who's struggling with her own doubts over the true meaning of
Christmas.  Intrigued by this chance encounter, Cindy Lou embarks on a
mission to discover The Grinch's past, interviewing all the Whos who've
known him and filling in a childhood that Dr. Seuss left up to our
imaginations.</P>
<P>At this point, the film rejoins the familiar tale, albeit dressed
spectacularly in computer animation and with the minimum number of
mature references to keep parents entertained.  With wonderful costumes
and sets made of pure fantasy, The Grinch should leave most viewers
feeling warm and fuzzy.  The only thing you shouldn't expect is to be
surprised, which I must admit I was kind of hoping for.</P>
