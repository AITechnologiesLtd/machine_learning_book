THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>In former Yugoslavia, generally speaking, the best or the
most popular television shows were produced by Serbian state
television. However, there were shows produced by other
republics' studios that successfully competed with Belgrade
television. SMOGOVCI, children's show about Zagreb family,
produced by Croatian television, was one of such examples,
which turned into the most popular and longest running
television series in these areas. Secret of its success,
together with good script and acting, was clever use of pop
culture references. Among them, the most obvious one was
musical theme used in the show's opening credits -
"borrowed" by Elmer Bernstein. The theme, which is now
always associated with the genre of western thanks to
Marlborough commercials, was written for THE MAGNIFICENT
SEVEN, 1960 film by John Sturges and one of the most popular
westerns of all time.</P>
<P>The plot of the film isn't original, since THE MAGNIFICENT
SEVEN happens to be the remake of SEVEN SAMURAI, 1954
classic by great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. The
characters and situations are mostly the same, but the
setting is different. First we are introduced to a Mexican
village, populated by simple but hard-working farmers.
Fruits of their labour are, however, always being taken away
by the large group of bandits led by Calvera (played by Eli
Wallach) which comes every year. After the latest visit, the
villagers had enough and desperately want to get rid of such
menace. But, since they lack weapons and skills to resist
the bandits, village leaders ask the Old Man (played by
Vladimir Sokoloff) for an advice. He tells them to gather
the every coin and other precious belongings they still have
in the village and head across US border in order to hire
gunslingers. They follow his advice and stumble upon a man
who fits their criteria - Chris Adams (played by Yul
Brynner), efficient gunslinger who is noble enough to accept
their job offer. He quickly begins assembling his team,
whose members agree to follow him for reasons different than
money, since the pay is low. Chico (played by Horst
Buchholz), the youngest of them, is not gunfighter at all,
and wants to follow the group only to learn their deadly
trade. The group - now numbering seven - arrives in the
village and starts preparing for the inevitable showdown.</P>
<P>Remaking the indisputable classics like SEVEN SAMURAI is
always rather thankless job for the filmmakers. However,
four decades ago Hollywood was still able to produce at
least decent remakes. In this case, John Sturges, very
experienced director of classic westerns, didn't bother to
add anything significantly new to Kurosawa's plot and the
script by William Roberts and William Bernstein is very
faithful to original when it comes to characters and
situations. Those who had watched Kurosawa's version would
experience a lot of deja vus when they watch THE MAGNIFICENT
SEVEN, but Sturges found a way to compensate the lack of
originality by using resources Kurosawa had not. First of
all, Sturges is using colour photography, as well as exotic
Mexican locations with impressive scenery and local
folklore. Then, there is aforementioned music by Elmer
Bernstein. Finally, length of the film is drastically
trimmed (two hours compared to 200 minutes in Kurosawa's
original cut) and the cast is more acceptable to the average
Western audience.</P>
<P>The ensemble cast of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN didn't look very
stellar in its time, but the actors who played the seven
gunmen later became legends, mostly thanks to the big break
in this film. Yul Brynner, the nominal lead, was perfect for
the role of Chris Adams with his commanding presence, and
the black clothes (including the hat) he wore in this film
would later became one of his iconic trademarks - ironically
used by the same actor in 1973 sci-fi thriller WESTWORLD.
The other six members of his crew were young unknowns at the
time, but each of them was memorable; the characters they
played were unique, either because different motives or
different character traits. Some of those actors became
action legends, like Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. Some
never became top stars but instead earned reputation of
respected character actors, like James Coburn and Robert
Vaughn (the latter one actually reprised his role in BATTLE
BEYOND THE STARS, 1980 science fiction remake). Some never
used this big break, like Brad Dexter who would later sink
into obscurity. Buchholz, who had the hardest job by playing
role already immortalised by Toshiro Mifune, actually did
his part well, and although he didn't become big Hollywood
star, this moment in his career foreshadowed his future
successes in Europe. Eli Wallach as Mexican bandit did his
part also well, but his character wasn't fleshed out enough
in the script; on the other hand, his performance
foreshadows the immortal role of Tuco in Leone's THE GOOD,
THE BAD AND THE UGLY.</P>
<P>The performances in this film are very good, and shootouts
and action scenes were also exciting and well directed. But,
on the other hand, film still lacks texture and at times
seems too preachy compared with Kurosawa's original. Some of
the situations are even melodramatic and somewhat
predictable. Sturges did his job very well, but he still
couldn't escape the shadow of Kurosawa. But, on the other
hand, remaking SEVEN SAMURAI was justified, and three more
versions, as well as popular TV show, are the proof this
plot's universality. And, despite the flaws, THE MAGNIFICENT
SEVEN earned its reputation of the essential western
classic.</P>
