<PRE>
 Arlington Road (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Jeff Bridges, Tim 
Robbins and Joan Cusack.</PRE>
<P> Arlington Road is a most uneven thriller, made more uneven by the nearly 
embarrassing performance of Jeff Bridges, who is forced to act so 
overwrought and paranoid that his character becomes nearly cartoonish.</P>
<P> The story revolves around an issue that strikes close to home  domestic 
terrorism.</P>
<P> Bridges plays Michael Faraday, who teaches a course on terrorism at 
George Washington University. A few years earlier, his wife, an FBI 
agent, was killed during a botched raid on a supposed right-wing 
enclave.</P>
<P> Faraday is still in mourning. He is a man consumed with pain and rage. 
He also has trouble trying to reconnect with his 9-year-old son.</P>
<P> His new neighbors, the Langs, who recently moved in across the street, 
become friendly with Faraday. The Langs have a young son, and he and 
Faraday's boy become the best of friends.</P>
<P> But eventually Faraday begins to suspect that Oliver Lang is not who he 
says he is. His investigation, consumed by paranoia, leads him down a 
dangerous and deadly path.</P>
<P> As directed by Mark Pellington, a veteran of music videos, Arlington 
Road is a frustrating endeavor. Pellington seems more content to play 
with his camera  using whatever odd angles he can devise  to create 
Faraday's nightmarish world.</P>
<P> It becomes more of a distraction than a dramatic device.</P>
<P> And Pellington fails to rein in Bridges' over-the-top reading. Bridges 
is one of our best actors, usually able to get under the skin of a 
character. He is best at portraying the average man caught in 
extraordinary situations, such as in Fearless.</P>
<P> But in Arlington Road, he is all motion  bug-eyed, sweaty and rumpled. 
He seems too unstable, too out of control to be a disciplined college 
professor.</P>
<P> In contrast, Tim Robbins as Oliver Lang and Joan Cusack and his wife, 
Cheryl, behave normally and underplay their respective roles as the 
couple with a secret.</P>
<P> Robbins also shows a streak of decency and honor as he protects 
Faraday's son because the professor had saved the life of Lang's son 
after a fireworks accident.</P>
<P> Cusack is almost June Cleaverish, but with a dark streak that she subtly 
reveals throughout the movie.</P>
<P> Overall, Arlington Road has some fine sequences, but as a whole, the 
movie is an aggravating experience. The film falls very short of its 
potential.
