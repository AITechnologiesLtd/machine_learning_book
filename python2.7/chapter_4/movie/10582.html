<PRE>Amistad
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>**1/2 (out of 4) Steven Spielberg is like Alfred Hitchcock. </P>
<P>A professor of mine once raised the question of whether Alfred Hitchcock
was a genius or merely a carnival ride operator. </P>
<P>On the one hand, most of his films are exceptional pieces of work.
Suspense, intellect, and morality weave through his films, giving them
first-time enjoyment and multiple-viewing substance. </P>
<P>On the other hand, most of his movies are so easily analyzed, and were
created with such calculated intent, that it's almost as if he never
created anything original, other than the PROCESS by which he made
movies. Once the process was in place, it only took a minimal effort to
create a new movie each time. </P>
<P>Spielberg's AMISTAD has those qualities of Hitchcock's. On the one hand
most of my observations were favorable; Spielberg and his long-time
editor Michael Kahn packed many clever insights into the movie. On the
other hand, many of these insights seem mathematically calculated. They
are intellectual, and smooth, not evocative or mood-setting. </P>
<P>Because the story is so moving, a more emotional approach from a more
intuitive (and less analytical) director would have worked better. </P>
<P>The movie opens on a close-up of the harshly lit, animalistic face of an
African man wincing in pain and determination. This man is Cinque
(pronounced "SING-kay," played by Djimon Hounsou) and he is extracting a
spike from a post using only his fingernails and his willpower. He is
able to free himself and others, and together, they take over the slave
ship they are on, ironically named La Amistad (The Friendship, in
Spanish). </P>
<P>None of the Africans know how to sail so they keep the ship's captain
and a skeleton crew alive. They demand to be sailed back home. Instead
of heading for Africa, the ship's captain sails to Boston where the
Africans are recaptured. </P>
<P>Several interested parties claim ownership of the Africans. A black
freeman and abolitionist, Joadson (Morgan Freeman), hires a young
lawyer, Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey, showing his limited range), to
file a claim for the captured Africans' freedom. </P>
<P>The trial goes rather quickly and favorably for the Africans, but just
as it looks like the abolitionist's case will win, President Martin Van
Buren (Nigel "King George" Hawthorne), up for re-election, appoints a
new, less sympathetic judge to the case. The case is so airtight that
the Africans are "freed," in spite of the new judge, but the case is
appealed over and over, all the way to the Supreme Court. Along the way,
Baldwin and Joadson convince John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins, superb
as always) to help them out. </P>
<P>AMISTAD is at its best when Cinque gets to tell his story. The scenes of
his capture, enslavement, and sale are the most moving parts of the
film. Sadly, they take very little screen time. Instead, a lot of time
is spent in the courtroom or in the prison. These aspects of the story
are interesting in their own right, but it's not where I would have
focused my attention. </P>
<P>Spielberg placed the rhetorical fights of the courtroom over the
emotional battles on-board. Like many of Hitchcock's stories,
Spielberg's is calculated rather than evocative. Here are some examples
from AMISTAD that reveal an insightful movie, more created than born: </P>
<P>• Still on the Amistad, at night and through the fog, the Africans first
hear chamber music in the distance, then drift past another ship. It is
a ship full of rich white Americans out on a pleasure cruise. They are
in the same place at the same time, yet their situations are so
obviously different. </P>
<P>• The scene of the Africans' initial imprisonment ends with Cinque
starting to cry. Kahn cuts from his face to the face of a shiny white
porcelain doll that we see belongs to the prepubescent Queen Isabella II
of Spain. From a man in pain and powerless to help himself, to a spoiled
brat who will never know pain with more power than she knows how to
handle. </P>
<P> • When it first appears that Baldwin and Joadson have won their case, a
new judge is appointed and it appears likely that he will overturn their
decision. Their world is turned upside-down. Literally. Spielberg shows
us the new judge posing for a picture through a camera lens that inverts
the image. </P>
<P>• One of the slaves is given a Bible. He can't understands the words,
but he spends lots of time thinking about the pictures. He explains the
story of Jesus to Cinque as best as he can by interpreting the pictures.
They compare their own plight in America to the trials of Jesus. Right
after they see the picture of the three crosses on Calvary hill, a ship
sails by with three masts in the same configuration as the crosses,
linking their martyrdom to his. </P>
<P>• Former supreme court justice Harry Blackmun, and not a professional
actor, reads the final Supreme Court verdict. (He calls the ship the
"Armistead.") </P>
<P>Each of these examples works very well, but they seem too perfect to be
natural. In each example Spielberg adds depth by comparing and
contrasting Cinque's situation with some other. But the examples don't
arise from the characters or the story; they are clearly introduced by a
godlike author. The effect is that you notice the author's winks rather
than getting emotionally involved. And since the story of a slave revolt
is such a rich mine for emotion, the direction of the film ends up
working against the story. </P>
<P>I do think that Spielberg is a good director. He is very good at what he
does. But his technique doesn't work for every story. His cold
calculation doesn't work well with the hot injustice of slavery. AMISTAD
would have been a better film from someone less thoughtful and more
emotional, and Spielberg should stick to operating carnival rides.</P>
