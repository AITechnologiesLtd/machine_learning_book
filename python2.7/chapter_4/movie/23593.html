<P> "I'm never going to die!" yells one character at a memorial for 39
fellow French-class students who died in a plane crash that, by all
rights, he should have died on too.  As incredibly laughable as this
line is, it provides the big flaw in the basic premise behind Final
Destination… making a horror movie about people cheating death does not
have much potential.  Since you can't kill Death, destroy Death, or send
Death screaming back to its home planet, you have a no-win scenario in
front of you.  No matter what is said or done, everyone ends up getting
it.</P>
<P> This is not to give you a spoiler and to say that everyone gets it in
the movie.  This is simply to point out the fact that no matter which
way they go, they're screwed.  Death is a no-win scenario.  If you're
going to make a movie about escaping death, make it a la Fearless, where
we focus on the human element.  But since it's a horror film the ball is
in the court of Director James Wong to provide us with something that
will keep us interested for an hour and forty minutes of inevitability.</P>
<P> The film actually does a halfway-decent job of this, but only by going
so far pass the realm of the believable to enter into the land of the
ludicrous.  How so?  Well, virtually everyone who bites it in the movie
does so by the means of a Rube Goldberg contraption.</P>
<P> Rube Goldberg, for those not familiar with his work, was drew comic
which often depicted a scientist trying to find the most complicated way
to do the most simple job.  A classic example of this is the machine in
which a cord is snapped, a mallet unlocks a cage, an anteater crawls out
from the cage and licks the ants on stamps, thus preparing said stamps
to be mailed.  Final Destination features several of Rube Goldberg's
guillotines… forms of death that end up being so drawn out that, about
five minutes into the elaborate trap, you utter a groan and yell at the
movie to get on with it.</P>
<P> The result is a movie that is only good for the target audience: the
young college student who is looking for an excuse to have his
girlfriend become utterly frightened and leap into his arms.  Do not
think in this film… you'll find plot holes.  Do not pay attention to the
dialogue in this film… you'll hate it.  Do not expect this film to be up
to par with half of the episodes of "The X-Files" that Wong has worked
on… you'll be severely disappointed.</P>
<P> Final Destination is good for a horror film.  This means that the
acting is terrible, the script was probably written by monkeys, and
somehow you find yourself enjoying the film anyway.  So sit back, relax,
and watch it… but only if you like cheese.</P>
<PRE>2.5 stars</PRE>
