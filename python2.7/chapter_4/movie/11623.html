Review: **** (out of ****)</P>
<P>When "RoboCop" first premiered in 1987, it looked like just another
gimmicky sci-fi thriller quickly thrown together to make a couple of
bucks before hitting the video shelves and falling into obscurity. It
was directed by Paul Verhoeven, then an unknown director who had made a
few art films in his native Holland. "RoboCop" looked cheesy all over,
from the poster design, to the tag line ("Part man. Part machine. All
cop"), to the goofy title.</P>
<P>However, when audiences went to see it, they were surprised to find an
extremely well-made, often humorous comic book revenge fantasy with an
underlying subtext of constant satirical jabs at American corporate
domination and capitalism in general. A hybrid of B-movies, video games,
and societal satire, "RoboCop" was much more than it appeared on the
surface. It has only been through the passage of time and subsequent
viewings that all its subtleties have fully emerged.</P>
<P>"RoboCop" takes place some time in the near future in Detroit, the city
whose massive steel mills once stood for the grand possibilities of
American manufacturing power. However, when the film opens, Detroit is
sagging. Riddled by crime and lagging in industrial output, the city has
become so pathetic that it has turned to a private corporation, Omni
Consumer Products (OCP), to manage the police departments.</P>
<P>OCP, run by a serious old businessman referred to only as The Old Man
(Dan O'Herlihy), is in the midst of its own struggles. Here, "RoboCop"
take a pointed look at the battlefield that is American business by
focusing on the intensifying battle between Dick Jones (Ronny Cox), an
older vice president who is losing his edge, and Richard Morton (Miguel
Ferrer), the hotshot young executive who wants to take his place at any
cost.</P>
<P>Jones' solution to Detroit's crime problem is a massive militaristic
robot, ED-209, which is brought to life with stunning stop-motion
animation by Phil Tippett ("Return of the Jedi," "Jurassic Park").
Unfortunately, in one the movie's funniest and goriest scenes, ED-209
goes berserk in the boardroom during a demonstration in disarming
technique, and turns a volunteering executive into Swiss cheese. Morton
doesn't waste a moment, jumping right into the fray and offering up his
RoboCop contingency program. "I'm sure we can have prototype ready in 90
days," he declares.</P>
<P>The man who eventually becomes that first RoboCop prototype is a
policeman named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a good-hearted family man
who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He and his
partner, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), attempt to foil a robbery heist
masterminded by evil crime lord and gleeful cop killer Clarence
Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith). Murphy and Lewis track Boddicker and his
gang back to an abandoned steel mill, and although Lewis escapes alive,
Murphy is captured by the sadistic gang of thugs. After a prolonged
torture in which his hand is blown off and he is shot repeatedly with
shotguns, Murphy is killed with a bullet to the head.</P>
<P>This entire sequence is filmed in bloody, graphic violence, and it is a
major turning point that defies all expectations and puts the audience
on edge for the remainder of the film. Until this moment, the tone of
"RoboCop" had been fairly light-hearted and downright comical at times,
especially during its satires of commercial television. Verhoeven said
he intentionally filmed Murphy's death in such graphic detail for two
reasons. First, he wanted the audience to sympathize with Murphy,
because he dies only thirty minutes into the film after being into only
a few previous scenes, hardly enough for the audience to understand his
character. Secondly, Verhoeven wanted the murder to serve as a kind of
Christ-like crucifixion, with Murphy then resurrected as RoboCop.
(Verhoeven is very intent on the Christ allegorical aspect of the film,
but I feel it's a bit of stretch).</P>
<P>When Murphy is pronounced dead at the hospital, his body is given over
to OCP to become the first RoboCop prototype. By combining the remains
of his body with a massive, technological suit of body armor and
computer chips, Murphy is transformed into a bullet-proof cyborg law
enforcement officer. The only problem is that OCP didn't manage to erase
his mind completely, and he is left with trace memories of his now lost
family and, even more importantly, the vile gangsters that murdered him
in his previous life.</P>
<P>In this way, "RoboCop" becomes a film about identity. Murphy is now part
man and part machine; but he is fully neither, and therein lies the
tragedy. He is caught between two worlds-- the flesh and the iron.
Indeed, he is caught in the crux of other vexing situations as well,
including the dilemma between enforcing the law while existing as the
creation of a corrupt private company that has vested interest in his
not doing his job.</P>
<P>"RoboCop" is a hard movie to pin down simply because it is so many
things. It is intensely violent (over two minutes of footage had to be
cut to avoid an "X" rating), but it is also quite funny. The humor is
sometimes elevated and satirical, and can't be completely grasped on the
first viewing. But other times it is bawdy, cheap humor, such as a
commercial advertising a board game called "Nuke 'Em" (much of the humor
is directed specifically at 80's social problems).</P>
<P>The movie is greatly aided by fine performance by all the actors. It is
easy to overlook Peter Weller as the title character because he spends
most of the film encased in a metal suit. But, like the great silent
performances, his is mostly body language. When, at the end of the film,
his helmet is removed and we see his face again, he makes it a great
melodramatic moment with his sad, dour eyes. When we finally get to see
the two halves -- Murphy and RoboCop -- coming together, it has a
disarming, mystical quality about it.</P>
<P>Like many crime films, "RoboCop" relies a great deal on its villains,
and Kurtwood Smith is simply great as the maniacal Boddicker. With his
receding hairline, intellectual glasses, and sneering grin, he is evil
personified in an ambitious street hoodlum. In every scene he occupies,
Smith chews the scenery with psychotic glee, and many of his lines were
improvised during filming. His character is frightening simply because
he always seems to be in such command of everything around him. He is
the ringleader in the gruesome killing of Murphy, so when RoboCop gets
to throw him through a number of plate-glass windows and reduce him to a
sobbing wimp, it's a guilty pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>Of course, the other star of the film is director Paul Verhoeven, who
quickly rose in the ranks after "RoboCop." He solidified his position
three years later with the Arnold Schwarzegger vehicle "Total Recall,"
and then entered American film lore forever with his two sexy
sleazefests "Basic Instinct" and "Showgirls."</P>
<P>However one feels about his later output, it's hard to deny that
Verhoeven's talents are on full display here. He never allows the
audience to get fully settled because the tone switches so easily from
humor to melodrama to adventure to gruesome violence. And, despite these
drastically varying elements, Verhoeven manages to keep it all rolled up
into one slick package that constantly plunges ahead.</P>
