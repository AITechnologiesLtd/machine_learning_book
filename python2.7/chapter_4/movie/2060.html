<PRE>                 JASON GOES TO HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY
                     A review by Steve Baumgarten
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     Anyone who goes to see a FRIDAY THE 13TH film at this point is
either a hopeless fan or a hopeless idiot; either way, he deserves
exactly what he gets.  I've enjoyed the FT13 concept--if not always
the execution, so to speak--since the first installment over a decade
ago (13 years ago, to be precise); so I like to consider myself a
hopeless fan.  But truth be told, most of the rest of the Times Square
audience with which I saw JGTH last Friday night did their best to
qualify for the other category.  Participatory audiences are fine with
me--in fact, most horror films are so lousy that they're only
improved by a constant stream of catcalls, smart-aleck remarks, and
general wising off until it's time for the next killing.  But this
audience was a little much; needless to say, I now know what 500 people
thinking out loud sounds like.  Listening to 90 minutes of "she's going
to get killed" and "yeah, she's going to take it off" was enough to
make me think that I'd reached *my* final Friday, and that I was now
paying for my life of movie-going sins (like slinking off to FT13 PART
V when I really should have been seeing THE COLOR PURPLE).</P>
<P>     Making things worse was the film itself, which seems to have been
assembled from a jumble of pages from the scripts of other, better
horror films.  It's a little beyond me: why on earth would anyone mess
with success at this late date?  Here we'd all just been relieved of
$7.50, supposedly so that we could see Jason go to Hell--or at least
kill a few scantily-clad teenagers and then retire to Miami Beach,
where he could reminisce about the good old days, back in the early
eighties when the horror film was king and direct-to-video hadn't yet
been invented.  And all we wanted to see was Jason--not an
unreasonable expectation, considering that his billing is even higher
than the day of the week this time around.  But instead we got a very
strange plot, filled with an unpleasant bounty hunter, an unpleasant
tabloid TV personality, an unpleasant yuppie, an unpleasant proprietor
of an unpleasant roadside diner, and an unpleasantly confused idea:
that Jason isn't really beyond explanation, that in fact he's just been
possessed all these years by the spirit of ALIEN.  Sort of.</P>
<P>     I'd like to say that this premise is so lame-brained that the
audience was left speechless, even momentarily.  But alas, they
weren't, although my feeling is that for 90 minutes we were all
subjected to Confuse-A-Cat therapy.  And the sad part of it is
that--briefly, oh so briefly--JGTH looked like it was actually going to
be a rather clever finale to the FT13 series.  I was especially
heartened to see two very witty visuals early on--but two was
apparently the limit for the filmmakers, who after about 10 minutes
managed to drag the film and our expectations--if not Jason
himself--straight down to Hell.  So I'll give away the two visuals,
just to give you a taste of what might have been.  The first came very
early on, when a Standard Issue Beautiful Teenage Girl appeared to be
moving into an abandoned cabin in the beautiful Camp Crystal Lake area,
known the world over for its relaxing atmosphere and plentiful
gardening implements, ever at hand.  As she enters, the light
immediately burns out, and she finds she has to go to an even darker
woodshed to find a replacement.  She does, in fact, find one: an
economy bulb in a package marked "Twice the Life."  I liked that.  I
also liked the insignia on the shoulder of one of Crystal Lake's police
officers: it indicated that they were all in Cunningham County--an
insider smile for those of us who remember the name of Jason's
cinematic godfather, Sean S.  Cunningham, who has made a small fortune
on the character he helped create in the very first FT13 and has since
gone on to make one lousy exploitation film after another.  Including
this one, which he produced.</P>
<P>     The very first scene, is in fact, terrific, as it sends up all the
horror cliches that the FT13 series helped spawn.  And yet they
remained quite effective, even as the S.I.B.T.G. stripped and stepped
into the shower.  Unfortunately, nothing much comes of all this, as the
filmmakers quickly toss aside any thoughts of making a conventional
(read: intelligible, sensible, entertaining) horror film.  Instead we
find that Jason is finally, once and for all, killed, dismembered, cut
up, and generally, well, sent to Hell.  (Pay no attention to the
spoilsport behind the curtain who in a loud and obnoxious voice points
out that Jason dissolved at the end of the last installment in the FT13
series: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN.  On the other hand, that was actually a
very decent film, one of the best in the series, and by the time JGTH
had ended, it had gone up another notch or two on my personal
Respect-O-Meter.  At least it knew what it wanted to do and did it,
which is more than I can say of JGTH.)</P>
<P>     What happens here is very disheartening.  Jason's dismembered
corpse is taken to a hospital morgue and placed on a table so that we
can look at it for a while.  It's in pretty bad shape, all right, but
we have confidence that he'll be able to pull himself together and get
on with it.  You know: JASON TAKES ON AN HMO--something that would
really get the audience into it.  Wonder of wonders, his heart starts
beating, and just as we're all set for the fireworks, the unexpected
happens.  The unwanted, in fact, but what happens is very central to
film's incredibly lame plot.  What happens is that the coroner takes a
big bite out of Jason's heart.  Yum!  And, naturally, becomes Jason in
some undefined way.  In fact, in one of the very few cool scenes in the
film, he passes in front of a full-length mirror, and lo and behold,
there's Jason, in all his hockey-masked glory.  But in real life, all
we have is a wimpy-looking coroner on the rampage.  Hoo ha.</P>
<P>     This was a big mistake.  However, there's nothing anyone can do
about it FOR THE NEXT 75 GOSH-DARN MINUTES!  Instead of Jason, what we
get is a succession of wimpy-looking characters, each of whom seems to
be on the wrong end of a game of tag that requires the poor soul who's
"it" to transfer a slimy-looking thing that looks like it came straight
off the set of PARASITE (which, by the way, is an excellent rip-off of
ALIEN, made in 1982 in audience-pleasing 3-D, and one of many films
that Demi Moore is none too proud of) into someone else's mouth.  That
part seems to have been stolen from LIFEFORCE, an even worse film, but
one which at least had the saving grace of featuring incredibly goofy
dialogue and Naked Female Space Vampires.</P>
<P>     The dialogue in JGTH is just as lame as the plot, which gets more
and more convoluted as we rush headlong toward the promised Final
Friday.  (Actually, I have no idea what day all this was happening
on--shows you just how sloppy the filmmakers were--but to be honest
the whole thing felt like Monday morning.)  And there are no Naked
Female Space Vampires--just coroners, policemen, and tabloid
television journalists on various murderous rampages.  And this
ALIEN-like thing, which really doesn't make any sense, but it's in
there anyway.  Especially as we reach the tail end of the film, when
all is revealed whether we want it to be or not.  By this time we've
heard from the bounty hunter (who doesn't really get to hunt anything,
though he does get to break the yuppie's fingers in a puzzlingly cruel
and rather sour scene) and discovered that Jason wants to be reborn,
but that this can only happen if he manages to transfer the slimy
ALIEN-like thing to his sister or her daughter.  And the sister--who,
to be honest, I wasn't aware of until this installment and who here
seems to be a refugee from Plot Convenience Playhouse--used to be the
wife of the yuppie.  And her daughter doesn't do anything at all in
this film, though in one scene she looks very cute and the whole
audience goes "Awwww!"</P>
<P>     Have I left anything out?  Mind you, this film is exactly 88
minutes long, and if it seems that there's already enough plot for
three lousy horror films--or, more to the point, three much better
horror films that have already been made--you may be shocked to learn
that there is still quite a bit more plot that I haven't even bothered
to mention.  Late in the game we get a smattering of EVIL DEAD ("Wrong
movie!" came the cry from the by now quite actively involved audience)
and a magic letter opener which is the only thing able to permanently
kill Jason once and for all.  Permanently, like.  Forever, this time.
Not ever to return again.  Honest.</P>
<P>     Just to ease your minds and relieve the unbearable tension this
review has no doubt created, Jason does, in fact, get sent to Hell; at
least he gets buried in the backyard by a lot of hands that spring up,
CARRIE-style, though in fact we never do get to see the low-budget Hell
to which he's been consigned.  So you can't sue anyone for false
advertising: after all, this is JGTH, not "Someone Finally Makes A
Great Jason Movie Instead Of Completely Wasting One Of The Best Horror
Movie Characters Of All Time Yet Again."  Whether he'll remain there is
another question, one that I certainly hope no one bothers to answer.
But the signs are bleak: stick around for the surprise finale to see
just how low New Line can sink now that they aren't making mega-bucks
off the Turtles anymore.  Clever horror fans might guess, if they
remember what other properties New Line owns; as for the audience
Friday night, well, they were pleased as punch and looking forward to
the next installment of, well, something.  Anything, really.  We're not
a choosy bunch.  As apparently Mr. Cunningham and New Line have
realized.</P>
