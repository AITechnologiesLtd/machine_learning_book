Re - #6 "The Grapes of Wrath"</P>
<P>Continuing with the "movie list," here is number six of the ten 
films that most shaped my life. These are not my favorite films. 
They are the movies I've seen that have had the greatest 
influence on my thinking, my character, my life. Some are 
favorites that I enjoy watching over and over again, which you 
can tell as you read each entry. Try to think of your own 
experiences with films and how they influenced the course of 
your life. It makes life more interesting to be aware, as you 
live it, to know how things such as books and films and magazine 
articles alter your path in significant ways. Sometime last year 
the Sunday NYTimes "Arts and Leisure" section had a piece on how 
difficult it is to think of a movie that may have changed 
history. The only movie they could think of was a silent film by 
D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the 
KuKluxKlan that the author believes changed national thinking 
about the KKK. How silly. Each of the ten films listed here 
changed my history, and if I had not seen them, I would not have 
helped change history in the ways that I have. Films don't move 
masses. They move individuals who move masses.</P>
<P>6. "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940) I was only four when this Henry 
Fonda flick hit the silver screen, and I rather doubt I saw it 
then, but did see it the first of many times before I was 10. 
Fonda was my maternal grandmother's favorite actor, not least 
because he almost always played a fellow who tried to help the 
poor folks and bravely confronted social injustice. (Note he 
also stars in Movie #1 on my list, "The Ox-Bow Incident."  
"Grapes of Wrath" is a Great Depression story, about 
down-and-out Okies leaving the dustbowl in search of the 
land-of-milk-and-honey in California in a rickety truck. They 
encounter ups and downs along the way and find the going rough 
even when they get to California. The scene that hit me hardest, 
as a little kid, takes place in a highway diner where they stop 
to buy half a loaf of bread, as I recall. One of the little 
Okie kids asks a waitress for a penny candy, because that's all 
he has. She looks at the ragamuffin and sells him a candy, while 
two husky truckdrivers look on waiting to pay their bill. They 
tip her a dollar, with one telling the waitress that he knows 
the candy she gave the kid cost a nickel. As the men walk out, 
she shakes her head and smiles: "Truckdrivers!" From that 
moment,it's a film moment that still occasionally inspires me to 
sudden impulses of generosity and a definite bias toward the 
Teamsters Union. </P>
