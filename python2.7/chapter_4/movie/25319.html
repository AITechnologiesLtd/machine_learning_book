<P>        So far, this summer's supposed blockbusters could have used a free
course on filmmaking from Robert Zemeckis.</P>
<P>Lesson number one: Take time to acclimate the audience to the
characters.  Unlike The Perfect Storm, What Lies Beneath completely
absorbs the main character's personalities into the dramatic mix-
frailties and all, through an intense look into their psyche,
practically forcing the audience to become emotionally attached.  This
is not an original concept in cinema, but after watching Clooney and
Wahlberg jump on that fishing boat and mournfully pronounce their
goodbyes as if they already knew the ominous storm was on its way, you
can't help but root for the ship to capsize.</P>
<P>Lesson number two: The film should have a pace that at least feels
natural.  The Patriot is a story about revenge, yet I couldn't shake the
dreadful notion of an overly contrived plot, and I could practically
smell the "sap" in those birch trees as Mel wreaked havoc.  In contrast,
the plot in What Lies Beneath is clever throughout, filled with suspense
and surprises, each scene linked in perfect transition with the next.</P>
<P>Lesson number three: Less is more!  We've seen Braveheart, and now
Gladiator and The Patriot in the same summer?  Both films were
successful, but movie moguls seem to have forgotten that the most
exciting and thrilling effects can be found in the main characters'
performances.  By keeping special effects subtle, What Lies Beneath
proves that you can still create a supernatural film that is downright
chilling, without all the grandeur.</P>
<P>        From his grave, Hitchcock would have given this picture two decrepit
thumbs up.  Zememckis pulls one straight from the Master of Suspense's
hat by casting legends Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in an eerie
and isolated setting, which really allows their performances to resonate
throughout.</P>
<P>Set in affluent and rural Vermont, Ford plays Dr. Norman Spencer, a
geneticist and professor from Harvard who is on the verge of a
breakthrough with a nerve manipulation drug.  His wife, Claire (Michelle
Pfieffer) has been the pillar of strength in her husband's quest for
academic glory, and has even sacrificed her promising music career. 
Their marriage appears perfect, but ever since a terrible car accident
one year earlier, Claire has been facing emotional problems, which makes
her the perfect victim to be haunted by an unsettled entity from
beyond.  Frightened out of her wits by strange phenomena around the
house along with the disappearance of a new neighbor's wife, Claire
decides to confront what she believes is a ghost haunting the house. 
What she unearths could cost her her life and that of her husband, as
the will for revenge seems able to conquer death.</P>
<P>        Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is dazzling.  There's something
mysterious about the glow of her blue eyes that mesmerizes.  Half the
time you don't know whether she's possessed, depressed, or just
completely loony.  Plus, her disconcerting appearance suits the Quixotic
setting so perfectly that I found myself truly sympathizing with her
plight.  Harrison Ford also shows that his judgment in scripts is not
permanently kaput after Air Force One and the awful Random Hearts.  This
role will put him back in my good graces just in time to start more
rumors about the next Indiana Jones movie.  In addition, screenwriter
Clark Gregg deserves credit for putting together a script that is
frightening and somehow totally believable.</P>
<P>        I have a feeling that What Lies Beneath will be compared to the remake
of Cape Fear several years ago.  What Lies Beneath is absolutely precise
in its production.  But it's the puzzling and original plot that will
have fans of movies like The Sixth Sense in for another giddy shocker.</P>
