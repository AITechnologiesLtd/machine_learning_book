<PRE>                               VALENTINE
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>Well, here's something that will make you wish you'd stayed home to
watch Survivor instead of shelling out money at the movies.  Hell,
Valentine, another entry into the yearly, winter horror crapfest, even
makes Temptation Island look good.</P>
<P>What we've got here is your standard grade horror flick in the vein of
Scream and Urban Legend, revolving around a mysterious killer devising a
supposed revenge plot -- a geeky kid who got a Carrie pulled on him in
6th grade.  My how the tables have turned!  The bunch of girls who
refused to dance with him are now getting killed, 13 years later.  Has
this nobody returned from obscurity to exact his revenge for having
punch poured on him?</P>
<P>We'll have one med school coed get pinched during a midnight autopsy. 
And of course she will hide in a body bag in a futile attempt to escape
the man in the Cupid mask -- who's naturally doing his marauding on
Valentine's Day.  We'll see all manner of stabbings, shootings,
beheadings, boilings, and whatnot -- until 90 minutes later the killer
is unmasked.</P>
<P>The film presents us an oh-so-clever puzzler -- is it the 6th grader
come back to haunt the girls?  Is it one of their dates?  Another man
from the past?  The cop?  Or maybe it's the fisherman they ran over and
left for dead on a winding road.  The possibilities are as endless as
they are random.</P>
<P>Valentine is headlined by actresses Denise Richards and Marley Shelton
(who, with this and Sugar & Spice, appears to be on the Molly Ringwald
road to career suicide), plus a gaggle of totally unknown supporting
actresses whose only requirement for appearance appears to have been
having very large breasts.  (And despite this there's no nudity in the
film at all!)</P>
<P>David Boreanaz joins the ladies in a truly pathetic role, stumbling
through his lines like he has a hangover.  No surprise: His character is
a recovering alcoholic.</P>
<P>Prefaced by stern and multiple verbal warnings that Valentine is "very
scary and very intense," sadly, we find the only very that applies to
this film is very stupid.  Simply, thrills are utterly lacking in the
film.  The murders are fully expected, unoriginal, and lacking in even
the most basic sense of horror.  And Cupid makes for a stalker about as
frightening as Mary Poppins.</P>
<P>Maybe the only thing dumber than the film itself is the way it is
credited: four screenwriters appear to have fought over the writing
credit, but the director refused to put his name on the film (Jamie
Blanks is an alias).  Now that's horror.</P>
