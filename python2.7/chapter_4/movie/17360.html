<PRE>OFFICE SPACE (1999)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: Mike Judge
Starring: Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Ajay Naidu, David Herman,
Gary Cole, Stephen Root, Richard Riehle, Diedrich Bader, John C.
McGinley, Paul Wilson, Todd Duffey</P>
<P>Of course I agree and like everything that 'Office Space' stands for.  I
have a job, and while it may not be a desk job like the one in this
movie, it's still a station for purgatory on earth.  And I fear the day
when I have to give up my dreams of whatever it is I dream of and settle
for a boring, spirit crushing desk job, like the one the characters in
this film have.  They work every day, sometimes even weekends, at a
computer plant and their job is to prepare for Y2K.  As written and
directed by Mike Judge ('Beevis and Butthead,' 'King of the Hill'), it's
a cartoonish hellhole of orwellian and kafkaesque proportions.  The lead
character (Ron Livingston, from 'Swingers') is basically a mutation of
the Job character from the bible, complaining to a hypnotherapist that,
'Since I started working, every single day has been worse than the day
before, so that every day you see me is the worst day of my life.'</P>
<P>On his way to work, he gets stuck in a mind-blowing traffic jam, and
every time he successfully gets into the moving lane, the lane stops
moving, and the lane he was just in starts moving miraculously.  He
glances out of his blind spot and notices the old man with a walker,
moving at a snail's pace, is making more locational progress than he
is.  When he gets to work, people notice he's gloomy and say he's 'come
down with a case of the "Mondays."'  Then his main boss (Gary Cole)
shows up at his cubicle and mentions that he didn't put the cover sheet
on his latest TPS report.  A couple seconds later, another boss comes up
to him and says the same thing.  Then again.  Then again.  Meanwhile, a
high-pitched receptionist's voice repeats the same annoying mantra to
caller after caller after caller.  Work is hell; a desk job is worse.</P>
<P>There are many hilarious things about 'Office Space,' and all of them
have to do with the hellishness of work and the way they make the
characters feel.  And it only helps that Judge, in his own right, is an
exceptional satirist, not only in terms of the lowest-of-the-low-ness he
brought to 'Beevis and Butthead,' but also to his 'Milton' shorts that
were shown on 'Saturday Night Live' way back when.  'Office Space' is
basically the live-action materialization of those shorts, complete with
the materialization of the Milton character (played brilliantly by
Stephen Root).  Milton, an overweight, perpetually sweating lisper works
in a tiny cubicle, with his radio and stapler as his only refuges, and
is always either being told to relocate his cubicle or to allow more and
more cardboard boxes to be stored there, crowding him in.  Just about
anything Milton does in this film is just about laugh-out-loud
hilarious, not the least being the scene where the boss has his birthday
party and is passing out cake while Milton is furiously worrying if
there's enough pieces or not.</P>
<P>In fact, there's so much potential comedy here that it's a damn shame
that it had to succumb to the silliest of Hollywood Movie Standards and
give itself an actual plot, and then succumb to the second silliest
Standard and give itself a go-nowhere romantic subplot involving the
main character and a 'Friends' cast member.  See, a movie these days,
especially one that's main strong point is its satire, doesn't feel like
it can get by on just it's on random comic insights, and the result is
that a film like this often becomes subject to a balancing beam of
judgment, concerning the ratio of great, funny moments to the thinness
and annoyance of the plot that it felt it had to add.  In fact, for a
lot of this film, I was in mild suspense, wondering how this film would
turn out in regard to that; it has a ton of funny,
tell-your-friends-and-family moments, but on the other hand, it has that
distracting plot that, self-depricative or not, still gets in the way of
potential jokes.  The actual storyline concerns our hero, Peter, and his
two office buds, Samir (Ajay Naidu, from 'SubUrbia') and Michael Bolton
(David Herman)...and no, not that Michael Bolton, as we're told (at
least it leads up to one really funny joke, involving John C. McGinley),
and their decision to try and rip off the company over the course of a
couple years by using a program designed by Bolton that was in fact
ripped off of a job pulled off unsuccessfully in the 70s (and, as they
note, in 'Superman III').</P>
<P>There's another plot going on at the same time, though, featuring how
Peter goes to a hypnotherapist who puts him in a positive trance and
then dies before he can bring him out of it.  Pretty soon, Peter is
sleeping in for days on end, ignoring his boss, knocking down part of
his cubicle so he can see outside the window, and even gutting fish at
his desk.  And he's also becoming acquainted with an attractive waitress
(Jennifer Aniston) at the local T.G.I. Fridays-esque establishment near
his office, who is stressed out by her own job, which requires her to
wear a minimum of 15 'flairs.'  She does, but her boss wants more
personality out of her, and points out that Brian, another waiter has 37
'flairs,' and a heck of a smile to boot.  Basically, this film has lots
of really superb moments, and a great philosophy about work that would
make for an otherwise recommendable film.  Alas, it's not to be.  The
main plot, about the virus, and the romance interfere too much with and
seem to detract from the overall orwellian/kafkaesque feel that this
film nails in its opening ten minutes.  Sure, Stephen Root is a
guaranteed riot, and Gary Cole (who with this and 'A Simple Plan' is
becoming a favorite supporting player of mine) is a hoot as the tiresome
boss, who opens every single sentence with a prolonged
'Yeeeaaaahhhh...." only to ignore anything anyone else says.</P>
<P>But the rest of it is hit-and-miss.  Livingston is likable in the lead,
but he never pushes the envelope far enough (he basically needs more
material to work with), and the same goes for Naidu and Herman, who both
do the best with what they're given.  As usual, it's the supporting guys
who have to work the hardest, to cover up for the amount of laughs the
plot and subplots take away from the overall effect of the film.  But
even they aren't given a whole lot to work with, and the entire feel I
had coming out of the film was of dire unsatisfaction.  I knew there
were lots and lots of great moments that I was still giggling about, but
there are too many missed opportunities and the main plot just ain't
funny enough.  What I did like, though, was the change in Peter from
'this blows' to 'who cares?' and what it gets him into.  Basically, the
office is being visited by efficiency experts (McGinley and Paul
Williams), a disguised word for those who give the bosses more money by
trimming the fat off the office.  Going through interviews, most people
kiss up, but nonchalant Peter tells them he actually does work for a
mere 15 minutes a week, and when questioned about the amount of work
he's missed, he gleefully states 'Well, I wouldn't say I've been missing
it.'  They like his attitude, and instead of firing him, as his boss
suggests, they state he should be promoted so he can have a challenge.
Okay, good idea.  This is stuff comedy, cartoonish as this is, is made
for.  But even when it gets to Peter's promotion, it still falls back on
the dreaded virus plot, which is more of an excuse-for-a-plot than an
actual plot.</P>
<P>Suggestions for the film: 1) drop the Aniston romance or at least modify
so it either goes somewhere or is the least bit interesting, because as
such, it isn't; 2) drop the virus stuff altogether - just not that
funny; 3) maybe, just maybe, go with the stuff about the promotion, and
make it more satirical and even funnier - expand expand expand; 4) up
the orwellian and kafkaesque tones <i>a lot</i> - apart from the
beginning stuff and a couple spots throughout, there's just not enough
of it; and 5) maybe just ditch any sense of a plot and make it an
episodic, plotless look into office life, exposing the horrors and thus
the humor in a more productive and satisfying manner.  Number 5 is the
most feared of all because not only does this mean the screenwriter(s)
has/have to come up with more jokes, it means snobbish critics will pan
it for not having a plot.  Let me state this loud and clear: you do not
need a plot to make a good film.  I just saw a Truffaut film called
'Small Change,' which is just a great flick, that dealt with the lives
of children in school and out.  It was plotless, save for a bit at the
end about a maltreated boy, but its lack of a plot allowed it to be more
open to insight, and to be able to concentrate more on mannerisms and
create individual sequences which together made up a complete portrait.
Now, I'm not suggesting in any way that a film like 'Office Space'
should be like a 70s French art house film; I'm merely implying that
this kind of structure would actually benefit a film like this.
Because, as such, it's just not at all satisfying, even if it does have
its head in the right place and comes with a powerhouse of great jokes.
Just not amusing enough.</P>
