<PRE>                                  DISCLOSURE
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     Barry Levinson's big-budget, star-studded film adaptation of
Michael Crichton's novel DISCLOSURE has been promoted as a social drama
that turns the issue of sexual harassment on its side through the use
of a gender reversal.  In reality, the harassment issue really is just
a plot point in a glossy, high-tech thriller about corporate politics.
The resulting film is somewhat short on meaningful social commentary,
but it is still a fast-paced and extremely entertaining crowd pleaser.</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas stars as Tom Sanders, the head of manufacturing
for a fictional computer company called Digicorp.  Sanders is up for a
major promotion but is passed up in favor of Meredith Johnson (Demi
Moore), who coincidentally used to live with Sanders (who is now
happily married with children).  When Sanders turns down Johnson's
attempt at seduction during an after-hours meeting, each accuses the
other of sexual harassment.  The stakes are raised by the high amounts
of money that both Sanders and Johnson stand  to make from a planned
merger between Digicorp and another company.  The merger is in danger
of being derailed if Sanders cannot find a reason for major
manufacturing problems with Digicorp's new high speed computer CD-ROM,
a product that is the major selling point in the merger.</P>
<P>     Of course, the big hook in this story is the gender switch of
having a man being sexually harassed by a female boss.  Even more than
in Crichton's novel, screenwriter Paul Attanasio leaves little
ambiguity about the harassment scene.  The dialog explicitly reminds us
that sexual harassment is really about power instead of about sex and
it is made very clear that Sanders never had any power over Johnson.
The majority of the film is told directly from Sanders' point-of-view
which serves to further underscore the audience's view of him as a
victim.  This lack of ambiguity hammers home the belief that sexual
harassment is likely to originate with either gender, but it doesn't
really explore that view with much depth.</P>
<P>     As with Crichton's novel, this idea is likely going to surround
the film with some controversy.  Some may call the film sexist based
primarily on the negative portrayal of a female executive and on the
simple suggestion that a woman could sexually harass a man.  An attempt
is made to alleviate these accusations by including several strong,
sympathetic women in supporting roles.  As in the novel, Sanders hires
a female attorney (Roma Maffia of the TV series "Chicago Hope") to
represent him in his sexual harassment claim. The film also beefs up
the role of Sanders' wife (Caroline Goodall), keeping her actively
involved in more of the story.  The film also includes a few strong
scenes with other female executives at Digicorp, including one
particularly effective sequence in which one of Sanders' peers asks him
to think about why she wasn't even *considered* as a likely candidate
for the promotion.</P>
<P>     The sexual harassment case is actually dispensed with surprisingly
early in the film, revealing that is was just a small component in a
more complicated story of corporate politics.  The latter half of the
film essentially turns into a high-tech detective story as Sanders
struggles to learn Johnson's true motivations in order to hang on to
his job.  This is actually the most interesting aspect of the film.
Director Barry Levinson keeps this part of the film moving at a very
rapid pace and most of the plot details are revealed in a logical and
believable manner.</P>
<P>     Michael Douglas is good in the role of Tom Sanders, although he
isn't really required to stretch much as an actor.  This role is
essentially another variation on the characters that he played in FATAL
ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT.  Crichton has a bit of a tendency in his
novels to seemingly describe the actor that he is thinking of for the
lead roles.  Reading the novel, it is *very* easy to picture Douglas as
Tom Sanders.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, Demi Moore is probably *not* the first person
that most people would imagine in the role of Meredith Johnson.  Her
past roles have never really showed the ruthless edge that the
character calls for.  Moore shows some surprising versatility in this
role and manages to play the role quite convincingly.  Unfortunately,
Attanasio's script draws the character somewhat two-dimensionally.  In
an effort to streamline the story, the film eliminates a couple
subplots from the novel that served to make Johnson's motivations
clearer.  In the film, she ends up seeming more incompetent while in
the book she seemed much more in control.  The fact that the character
works at all is very much due to the strength of Moore's acting.</P>
<P>     The streamlining of the script also reduces the significance of
Bob Garvin (Donald Sutherland), Digicorp's CEO.  The film constantly
keeps the audience in the dark about his motivations and about how much
he is aware of what is going on.  Sutherland does the best he can, but
the role turns out to be rather thankless.  Some of the other
supporting roles are more interesting.  Particularly strong
performances are given by Roma Maffia as the lawyer, Caroline Goodall
as Sanders' wife, Dennis Miller (in a semi-serious role) and Nicholas
Sadler as techies on Sanders' staff.</P>
<P>     As is usually the case in Michael Crichton's stories, technology
ends up playing a major role in DISCLOSURE.  Characters are constantly
using computers to communicate or gather information.  Electronic mail
and computer-based video conferencing are major forms of communication
in Digicorp.  One of the film's highlights is a big climactic scene
involving a virtual-reality based filing system. This sequence features
some very impressive computer graphics effects created by Industrial
Light and Magic.  While some of the technology is a bit futuristic
(particularly the Virtual Reality sequence) to be commonplace in
today's business, nothing is shown that is entirely beyond the
capabilities of today.  The various computer interfaces shown do tend
to be more photogenic than practical.</P>
<P>     While Attanasio's screenplay does muddy some of the motivations
behind the story, it is still a generally effective adaptation.  He
streamlined Crichton's story by eliminating a few unnecessary
characters and subplots.  He also managed to introduce some appreciated
touches of humor which were absent from Crichton's generally humorless
novel.  The writing isn't quite as intelligent as Attanasio's earlier
script for QUIZ SHOW, but it still does manage to inject some moments
of insight.</P>
<P>     After seriously misfiring with TOYS and JIMMY HOLLYWOOD, Levinson
is essentially working as a hired hand on this film.  The direction is
very slick and confident, though, and the film moves along at a very
rapid pace.  In a departure for a Barry Levinson film, this one is shot
in Panavision (by Tony Pierce-Roberts) and the widescreen frame is well
used to highlight the impressive sets created for the Digicorp offices
as well as some of the high- tech special effects.  Ennio Morricone's
score is unmemorable but not intrusive.</P>
<P>     DISCLOSURE doesn't really succeed as the controversial morality
play that is promised in the advertising, but it does work as a very
entertaining corporate thriller.  The movie isn't nearly as deep as it
would like to be, but it does manage to be a lot of fun.</P>
