<P>Well, who would have thunk it? After an endless stream of mostly 
predictable and cliched movies set in high school in the last year, one 
has finally come along that is amazingly so precise, so hilarious, so 
biting, so smart, so perfect, in every one of its minute details that it 
comes as a sort of godsend. Its name is "Election," it's directed by 
Alexander Payne (1996's "Citizen Ruth"), and it, no doubt, will go down 
as one of the very best films of 1999.</P>
<P>Set at Omaha's Carver High School during the election for student 
council, the film imaginatively is narrated by all four of the main 
characters so that we can learn and understand the innerworkings of 
their minds, even when they are saying the opposite of the actions they 
are making. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, coming full circle from 
his role in 1986's classic "Ferris Bueller's Day Off") is the school's 
most popular teacher, a guy who has won the Best Teacher Award for three 
years running and who shows up at school nice and early each day. 
Friendly to (almost) all of his pupils, the one student who manages to 
get under his skin so much that he can't stand her is overachieving 
senior Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon), currently running unopposed for 
school president. If you're old enough to have experienced high school, 
you've definately run into someone like Tracey. She's the "perfect" 
student, a person who seems friendly to everyone even though you can see 
through their thin facade; a person who constantly raises their hand in 
class and knows every answer to every question; and a person who you 
know, no matter what, is going to achieve everything that he or she 
strives for in life. It's just Mr. McAllister's luck, then, that he 
happens to also run the student elections and, determined to cause 
Tracey to lose just one thing in her life, he convinces naively cheerful 
football jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who has recently broken his 
leg in a skiing accident, to run against her for president. Altough at 
first hesitant, Paul quickly grows eager to join the race, causing 
Tracey to grow outraged. For her, this means war. But that's not all; in 
a plot twist whose particulars should be discovered on your own, Paul's 
younger, rebellious sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a sophomore, also 
enters into the race, causing a three-way tug-of-war between Tammy, who 
poses to the students that she doesn't even care if she wins the 
election, and as president, won't do anything; Paul, who is joyous just 
to be in the running; and dear, dear Tracey, who will go to any length 
possible to ensure her ultimate defeat.</P>
<P>Reading the premise, "Election" may sound like "just another teen 
flick," but it isn't by a long shot, and is in its masterful treatment 
that it succeeds so highly. I can assure you there is no climax set at 
the prom, and the story doesn't cowardly degenerate into a romance 
concerning which guy gets the girl. No, what "Election" is is a 
brilliantly articulated satire, a "high school" movie that is probably 
targeted more towards adults, but that all thoughtful teens will greatly 
appreciate as a much-needed diversion from all of those sugar-coated 
teen fantasies that have assaulted the multiplex in recent months. </P>
<P>Although "about" a high school election, it gradually grows clear that 
telling such a simple, clear-cut story isn't director Payne's 
intentions. Not only is there a heavy dosage of narration by the four 
principle characters, but the film also isn't always told 
chronologically, as each plot thread is carefully and delightfully torn 
away to not only create a more meaningful motion picture, but also one 
that has something to say about loneliness. Through the big, sly laughs 
that the film creates, it is revealed that each of the characters are 
lonely, in their own certain way, and we are taken into each one of 
their lives to learn just why they are the way they are.</P>
<P>For example, we eventually find that Jim McAllister is obviously 
unhappily married (even though he says during narration that his wife is 
"his source of strength"). When his buddy and a fellow teacher, Dave 
Novotny (Mark Harelik), is fired for having a sexual relationship with 
one of his students, Jim grows closer to Dave's solemn wife, spending 
more and more time with her and convincing himself that he loves her, 
not realizing that it isn't love that draws them together, but 
desperation. Jim's life is a monotonous and dull routine, as he goes to 
school, teaches the same things over day after day, and then goes home 
to the same woman that he has been married to for nine years. Certainly 
a lot of people have this sort of life, but Jim needs more. Matthew 
Broderick, who has fallen on hard times in recent years (1997's 
"Addicted to Love," 1998's "Godzilla"), has revitalized his career with 
"Election," and has, indeed, given his strongest, most gratifying 
performance since "Ferris Bueller" thirteen years ago. We don't just see 
his sadness, we feel it.</P>
<P>Matching Broderick in every way is Reese Witherspoon, maybe the most 
talented actress under 25 working today, who has never been better. It 
would be criminal to see her flawless, nuanced, and hilarious 
performance get snubbed of an Oscar nomination come next year. 
Witherspoon transforms herself so completely into the heart, soul, and 
body of Tracey that it will be difficult from now on to distinguish the 
two personalities, although she is so wonderful in every film that she 
should have no trouble doing just that. In the character of Tracey 
Flick, we have also been given one of the most distinguished and 
memorable characters I've probably ever seen in my years of 
film-watching. She is the type of girl who you really shouldn't like at 
all. She's perky, she's unblemished, she's successful, but she is also 
so desperate and determined to be a winner that you can't help but feel 
genuinely sorry for her when things don't go her way. Like Jim 
McAllister, no matter what feats Tracey seems to triumph over she 
remains a lonely person without any actual friends. In a couple brief 
scenes involving her paralegal mother (Colleen Camp), we get a few hints 
as to what made Tracey the way she is. Although loving, her mother 
strives for the same exact great success as Tracey.</P>
<P>Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell, two film newcomers, also fit neatly 
into their respective roles. Klein is probably the most completely 
likable character in the film, as his Paul comes off as always innocent, 
even after we see him doing several arguably negative things, because he 
is so unintelligible and dense that he never really comprehends the 
things he's doing. There's no denying, however, that Paul has a big 
heart, and he cares about others. Jessica Campbell turns in a touching 
performance as the outsider, Tammy, who is torn apart when the girl she 
loves breaks up with her. "I'm not really a lesbian, though," Tammy 
reassures. "It just so happens that so far all of the people I have been 
attracted to have been girls."</P>
<P>If "She's All That" is "'Pygmalion' set in a high school" and "10 Things 
I Hate About You" is "'The Taming of the Shrew' set in a high school," 
"Election" is "'Fargo' set in a high school," and out of the three the 
latter is definately the highest honor. We don't necessarily watch 
"Election" as much as we absorb every single second of its constant 
entertainment and pleasures, excited to find out where it will lead us. 
Of technical note, the music score by Rolfe Tent is distinct and often 
even gains laughs because of its frightening perfection, sort of like 
Tracey herself. Writers Payne and Jim Taylor have fashioned one of the 
most fresh and original screenplays to come along in some time, as it 
never condescends to any of its potential audience members, whether it 
be adults or teens. "Election" is a dazzling dark comedy, clear in both 
tone and substance, and has the ability to be rib-tickling one moment 
and poignant the next, all the while never losing sight of its 
truthfulness and courage. In a week when "The Mummy" will unfairly be 
the #1 movie in America, making tens of millions of dollars, "Election" 
is the real deal, and now that it is in wide release, make it an effort 
to go out and see this sure-to-be classic as soon as humanly possible.</P>
