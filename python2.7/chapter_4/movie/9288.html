<P>I think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop Jim
Carrey from making another movie. He's changing the cinema as we know
it--and for the worst. I would willingly rewatch Batman And Robin rather
then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic
moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. The premise: A lawyer can't lie for a
day. Ho, ho. Normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr.
Carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. I laughed once--and I was laughing
at the sight of everyone else laughing. Grinding doesn't begin to describe.
It pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a
normal person, you leave feeling sick. When it's not trying to be funny,
it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy.
At best. This movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted
best picture of all time by Sight And Sound. But, it fails on every
possible level. It fails to be funny. It fails to be insightful. It fails
to be suspensful. It fails to be fun. They should pay people to see it.</P>
<P>It suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and
start thanking Orson Welles, for having lived. </P>
<P>If you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that
you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will
go insane. Yes, literally insane. Stark, raving mad. It is boring, stupid,
melodramatic and in the end ugly. I reccemond it strongly. To Ed Wood.</P>
