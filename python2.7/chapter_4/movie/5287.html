<PRE>                                    TWISTER
                       A film review by Alex Christensen
                        Copyright 1996 Alex Christensen</PRE>
<P>_Jurassic Park_, but like, it doesn't suck</P>
<P>4 of 4 stars; only the stuffy would complain
The pitch: "It'll be like _Jurassic_Park_ meets Speed!"</P>
<P>        I did not go into _Twister_ with unreasonable expectations. I 
just wanted to be entertained. Then the picture came up on the screen, 
the wind blew me back in my seat, and I embarked on the greatest 
thrill-ride of a movie since _Speed_ or _Natural_Born_Killers_. 
_Twister_ is so real and powerful and, above all, entertaining, that to 
complain that the story is a little hokey or the characters said cliched 
lines is a fundamental misunderstanding of the film. It's tornadoes, man!
        Comparing _Twister_ to _Jurassic_Park_ is very valid. Michael 
Crichton wrote both films, and they both feature "stars" who were 
completely computer-generated. Steven Spielberg produced both films, as 
well. There was a lot which disappointed me about _Jurassic_Park_, 
however. For one thing, all of the characters were so annoying that I 
kept wishing for them all to die. Also, and I know this is a completely 
nonsensical thing to say, but I just could not appreciate the effects 
much at all. Sure, they were impressive, but I mean, so is a Van Gogh; I 
do not want to spend two hours sitting in front of a movie screen with a 
Van Gogh on it. There has to be an emotional involvement and an 
effective visual use of effects to really impress. For instance, I 
thought the most effective use of effects in _Jurassic_Park_ was when the 
cow is lowered into the cage and is ripped apart offscreen. The noises 
were great. They conveyed everything that needed to be conveyed. Another 
good scene was when Wayne Knight's character, attempting to smuggle DNA 
off the island, was killed by the poison-shooting dinosaur. I think that 
was an animatronic dinosaur, though. So why was I watching a movie? I 
could have been home on my couch listening to the radio or watching 
"Muppets Tonight!" I wished I was home on my couch listening to the 
radio or watching "Muppets Tonight!" Maybe tonight I will stay home on 
my couch and listen to the radio or watch "Muppets Tonight!"
        Or maybe I will go see _Twister_ again. Because, brother, does Jan 
de Bont, the director who brought us _Speed_, and the cinematographer who 
brought us _Cujo_, _Die_Hard_, and _The_Hunt_for_Red_October_, know how to 
make a movie that is exciting, gripping, and roundhouse-punch 
scary. When I saw _Speed_ for the first time, I was actually dodging and 
jumping in my seat and swearing out loud. (This can be very annoying to 
those seated around you. Be forwarned. _Twister_ is such a panic-inducing 
movie.)
        Jack N. Green, _Twister_'s cinematographer and Clint Eastwood's 
for the gorgeous _Unforgiven_ and _Bridges_of_Madison County_, pulls off 
some truly amazing helicopter shots and shots that require expert 
timing. He also photographs nature with such an unerring eye that you 
see the movie as a landscape of plains which intersects in an eerily 
beautiful way with the deadly power of nature as manifested by the 
tornadoes. You always feel that what is happening on screen is moving 
toward you, like your feet are on the ground with the characters, as well.
        I guess I will give a brief plot summary. The plot does not 
really matter. The plot is just an excuse for a bunch of tornadoes and 
destruction. This is a good thing. I do not want to be bothered with 
emotional baggage or following the intricacies of some loser's backstory. 
I want to see something get knocked over. de Bont comes through for me. 
So anyway, there are these storm-chasers, see, they want to find out how 
a tornado works, because nobody really knows, so they design "Dorothy" a 
machine that enters the eye of a tornado (they have to place it the 
tornado's path, of course) and releases hundreds of tiny sensors, which 
then record and transmit detailed information back to the scientists' 
computers. Bill (Bill Paxton) designed Dorothy, but he has left the 
project, and his wife Jo (Helen Hunt) for a new job as a weatherman and a 
new life with his fiancee, Melissa (Jami Gertz). Of course, on a trek out 
to get Jo to sign the divorce papers, Bill gets sucked back in with the 
old crew. Yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah. Then there is this evil 
corporate storm-chaser, Jonas (Cary Elwes), who has stolen the design of 
Dorothy and is looking to get his findings completed before the other 
group. A rare storm configuration has presented some unique opportunities 
for study, so the race is on between the two groups to place and operate 
their machine first. Sound stupid? It is. Don't think about it too much. 
Unlike in _Jurassic_Park_, de Bont has the good sense to treat the human 
characters like what they are: bit players. There is almost no 
manipulative crap to try and get you to care while you are just waiting 
for the next cool effect.
        Who can think anyway with a big tornado barreling toward you, 
swirling and roiling with debris and dust and who knows? hellfire and a 
kind of cruel intelligent mindlessness that Spielberg wishes his dippy 
velociraptors had had for one second? Who needs to? Probably some idiot 
movie critic. But if you are looking for a movie that is a movie in every 
full, complete sense of the word, the kind of movie you can watch with 
popcorn on Saturday afternoon, _Twister_ is it. It is a four-star action 
picture, a four-star disaster picture, and that adds up to a four-star 
picture.</P>
