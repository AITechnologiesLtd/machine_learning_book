<PRE>                                    OTHELLO
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Seldomly have I been so outright disappointed by a film.  OTHELLO's
problems are numerous, and given the outstanding cast put together for the
film (and an admitted masterpiece to work with), it's amazing that this
film comes off as being so downright bad.</P>
<P>     The story's been around for 400 years.  Othello (Lawrence Fishburne)
is a Moorish general in the Italian army, and he is the victim of constant
prejudice.  Desdemona (Irene Jacob) is his Italian lover, and when the
pair secretly marry, Othello finds himself the victim of a fiendish plot
by his servant Iago (Kenneth Branagh).  Iago's motives are also magnified
by the presence of young Cassio (Nathaniel Parker), who serves as
Othello's right-hand man despite Iago's longer term of service.</P>
<P>     And as with any Shakespearean tragedy, there are a number of
misunderstandings and, as a result, *everybody* dies.</P>
<P>     The prime difficulty with OTHELLO is the language.  Dripping with
archaic English, anyone unfamiliar with Shakespeare's original play is
going to have a really tough time following the barest facts of the
story.  The truly sad thing is that the archaisms are largely not
Shakespeare's.  Rather, first-time writer/director Oliver Parker changed
70 percent of the play during his adaptation, in order to, I guess, make
it much more confusing than it really is.</P>
<P>     Other problems abound.  Iago's motivation (in the film) is never
clear at all, Branagh's acting here is pathetic, the very French actress
Jacob is woefully miscast as an Italian speaking in English, and while the
last 20 minutes of the film are pretty good, they don't make up for the
first 100, which are just dreadfully boring.  By the time the end finally
rolls around, I was *hoping* they'd all die, and soon.</P>
<P>     The few good points?  OTHELLO's thinly-veiled message about racism is
worthwhile, if a bit obvious, and Fishburne does turn in a great Moor.  If
he'd had more to work with here, we'd probably have the definitive version
of the play.  As it is now, it's just a lot of death in Venice.</P>
