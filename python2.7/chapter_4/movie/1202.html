<PRE>                                    BUGSY
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     BUGSY is a film by Barry Levinson.  It was written by James Toback.
It stars Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Harvey Keitel, Ben Kingsley,
Elliott Gould, Joe Mantegna.  Rated R for language and violence.</P>
<P>     BUGSY is the film biography of Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, a Jewish
gangster, a psychopathic killer, and the "inventor" of Las Vegas.
Siegel has been recently portrayed in THE MARRYING MAN and MOBSTERS and,
perhaps as Hollywood's resident mobster in the Forties, exercises a
powerful charm of the movie makers of today.  Certainly, James Toback's
funny, alarming, and insightful script loves Siegel, makes us want to
love him, even while fully informing us from time to time, lest we
forget, that he really was totally bugsy, out of his mind, a very scary
guy.  Maybe, it's only because Siegel's been dead for almost 35 years
that it's safe to see him as an American dreamer and visionary.</P>
<P>     First and foremost, the screen belongs to Warren Beatty, who has
seemed to me to be a mostly underappreciated treasure by the movie-going
public.  Instead of focusing on his famous romances, the public could
spend the time more instructively studying his subtle mastery in movies
like McCABE AND MRS. MILLER, SHAMPOO, and BONNIE AND CLYDE, as well as
his behind-the-camera talents in the wonderful REDS, inter alia.  And
here Beatty gives the fullest, most unreserved demonstration of his
formidable powers the camera has ever recorded.</P>
<P>     And Annette Bening as Virginia Hill, the starlet and gun moll
Siegel fell madly in love with, may be the only female actor of her
generation who could hold her own against Beatty's Siegel, as indeed
Hill was the only one who could defy the gangster.  Some critics are
comparing her to Barbara Stanwyck as the very type of the
tough-Forties-sexy dame; maybe, but I think Bening head and shoulders
above anything Stanwyck ever did.  She's every bit as volcanic and
unpredictable as her lover, proud, inpatient, no-bull-shit, and
glamorous, in way movie women seldom are these days.</P>
<P>     BUGSY is overflowing in excellent character performances, too.
Harvey Keitel as Mickey Cohen and Joe Mantegna as George Raft are
Siegel's friends, allies, and go-fers, supporters who can't stop their
friend's inevitable burn-out.  Ben Kingsley is the syndicate boss Meyer
Lansky, cold and concerned.  The late rock promoter Bill Graham is
unexpectedly good as Lucky Luciano.  And Elliott Gould, looking
positively fat, is the slow-witted stool pigeon Harry Greenberg.  This
is a rich diet for any movie.</P>
<P>     And it is all served served up so handsomely.  Lyndol, who loves
the Forties cars, was agog at the Continentals and 4-door Cadillac
convertible, the Packards and Lincolns.  Production designer Dennis
Gassner, costume designer Albert Wolsky, and cinematographer Allen
Daviau (E.T., AVALON) were used by Barry Levinson to create a Forties
Hollywood that looks new, deco-ish, slightly raw, glaring, color-soaked
exteriors and dark domestic interiors.</P>
<P>     Levinson himself deserves high praise for the way he's handled all
the disparate elements of his film to create a complex portrait of a man
who would easy to dismiss as a mere monster.  We see Siegel's darkness
(without understanding it), but we also see his romantic obsessions, his
attractiveness to men and women, a gangster and murderer, who stop in
the middle of a vicious beating to correct his ruffled appearance, who
was addicted to facials and cucumber-slices-on-the-eyes, who was more
interested in love and creation than in money.  His partners and
superiors in the Organization dismiss him as Bugsy, but never to his
face.</P>
<P>     You know, I think you ought to see BUGSY and the cost be hanged.
This is a great motion picture.</P>
