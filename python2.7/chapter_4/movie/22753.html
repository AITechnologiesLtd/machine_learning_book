<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Bosnian-born writer/director Emir Kusturica (Time of the Gypsies,
Underground) has come up with a robust (lively music and characters with
plenty of energy) but excessive screwball comedy with Felliniesque
touches here and there, and before the film literally goes in the shit,
it was able to show some warm romantic moments and garner many laughs
from its odd-looking and strangely-acting characters. The film is a
relentless slapstick comedy depicting the Gypsy community in Slovenia on
the banks of the Danube. It revolves around two friendly patriarchal
families and a feud with a third Gypsy patriarch, who is disdainfully
called a `businessman patriot.' All the patriarchs are thieves, set in
their own ways and customs, with each trying to either control who their
children marry or are obsessed in making sure that they do get married.</P>
<P>Grga Pitic (Sabri Sulejman) is the old-wily patriarch enamored with the
ending to the "Casablanca" film, which he often watches on his video (it
could be said, that one of the film's themes could be about a beautiful
friendship formed by a seemingly odd pair). His son, Grga Veliki (Jasar
Destani), is the one who wants to marry for love, but his father just
wants him to marry anyone before he dies. The other families' patriarch
is Zarije (Zabit), who is the elderly father of the slimy screw-up
swindler Matko (Bajram). His son is Zare (Florijan), a clean-cut Gypsy
boy, who has fallen madly in love with a waitress, a real spit-fire, Ida
(Branka), but can't have her because his father owes money to the third
patriarch, Dadan (Srdan), who wants Zarije's son to marry his sister,
Afrodita (Salija). She is known by the disdainful name of "Ladybird,"
and is viewed as a midget. She courageously stands up to her brutal
brother by saying that she will marry for love only. Dadan is a
cocaine-sniffing womanizer and vulgar disco lover (singing out when high
on drugs, I'm a "pitbull"), who plays his part with manic energy.</P>
<P>Grga Pitic, garbage dump owner, and Zarije, cement works owner, are old
friends, though they haven't seen each other in 25 years (these Gypsies
move around). When Matko thinks up a heist of a train carrying diesel
fuel, he needs money to finance this hijacking; and, he goes to Grga for
help instead of his father. But Matko is double-crossed by his ruthless
partner in this venture, Dadan, and subsequently the reason for the
forced wedding between Zare and Ladybird to pay off the debt or get
killed by Dadan.</P>
<P>The heart of the film is the farcical wedding and the problems that
occur there, which include forcing the bride and groom together, hiding
the death of the patriarchs in mounds of ice, and having the bride run
away from the ceremony, disguised as a tree stump, and to watch her fall
in love there with the man she dreamed of. The film comes replete with a
happy ending, as noted onscreen by the ending saying just that.</P>
<P>The two cats appear as the title and are seen constantly crawling in and
out of scenes, sometimes contributing in a comical way to what is
happening onscreen. The film is sometimes a "Keystone Kops" comedy, like
those old Mack Sennett films. But the comedy keeps getting more and more
absurd as the story gets out-of-hand, going from hand-grenades blowing
up parts of a house, dead men reviving themselves after being packed in
ice, and finally dissolves into complete chaos. The film just ran too
long, close to two hours, for a story that shouldn't have been longer
than 90- minutes.</P>
<P>The group of Gypsies were mostly nonprofessional actors, colorful
characters, with their mouths filled with gold teeth, and a screen
presence that was absurd and defying in logic. Their mannerisms offered
a strange and earthy blend of venality. This original film offered
something different to see, for a viewer who usually doesn't get to see
real Gypsies onscreen.</P>
<P>It's a noisy comedy, with a loud brass band coming in at any time during
the film. It takes suspension of belief on the part of the viewer to
stick with this one for its complete romp across Gypsy land, plus the
skits become too labored to sustain the frenetic pace of the film.</P>
<P>The characters make this film enjoyable. The Gypsies are real
humdingers; they are always grinning; and, while acting grotesque, they
seem to be cruel, and ridiculous. The warm moment in the film, is the
romance between Branka and Florijan, vanishing in a field of sunflowers.
She's a live-wire, and when onscreen was a commanding presence.</P>
