<PRE>                           SWEET AND LOWDOWN
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Take a 95-minute movie.  Deduct time
          for several musical numbers.  Film three endings
          for a sub-story (none of them very good).  What you
          have left is just not enough time to tell anything
          more than a superficial morality plot.
          Surprisingly popular with the critics, this is a
          shallow tale of a fictional legendary jazz
          guitarist who ruins his life being totally selfish
          and self-obsessed.  Allen short-changes us on
          character development by taking long timeouts for
          musical sequences in an already short film.  The
          jokes are often weak, the characters mostly one-
          dimensional, and only the jazz is up to snuff.
          Rating: 4 (0 to 10), low 0 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Woody Allen seems to be as popular as ever with the public and
with the critics, but I have to say that these days he and I seem to be
on very different wavelengths.  His last few films seem to me to be
superficially written without any real characters.  His humor is
contrived and weak, and his ideas lack ginger.  Allen could have phoned
in the script for SWEET AND LOWDOWN.  It is little more than an excuse
to tie together the musical interludes.  In a film already short at 95
minutes, he puts several musical sequences.  Then he takes what could
have been one of his patented silly situations and works it out three
different ways, not one of them amusing.  After he wastes that much
time he has less plot and character development than a typical hour of
television.  And what is his theme?  If you are not a nice person you
might end up cheating yourself.  Where is the filmmaker who made LOVE
AND DEATH and the intelligent CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS?</P>
<P>     Emmet Ray (Sean Penn), as the film opens, is a pimp and a totally
selfish personality.  Favorite hobbies are watching trains and shooting
rats.  He happens to be the second best jazz guitarist in the world,
second to the great Django Reinhardt.  His fictional story is told, in
the style REDS, by a combination of dramatizations and by witness
interviews by experts on jazz, one of whom is Allen himself.</P>
<P>     As if having been given a monstrous talent was not enough Ray is
given a perfect girlfriend, Hattie (Samantha Morton).  She just sort of
falls into his lap as he meets her on the Atlantic City boardwalk.
Hattie is a mute laundress and she is beautiful.  Hattie is utterly in
love with him and transformed by his music.  Ray is too selfish and
stupid to bring himself to treat her at all well, cheating on her when
the opportunity arises and worse insulting her to her face.  After
living with her about a year he walks out on her in what should be a
key scene, but one that Allen seemingly did not bother to film.
Instead we learn about it from the witnesses.  He has left her for
Blanche (Uma Thurman), a writer with a majestic look and an affected
mode of speaking.  But eventually there is a reckoning.</P>
<P>     Allen has cameos for a number of celebrities, some as jazz experts
playing themselves, or as with the case of John Waters, just as a
character.  Penn seems to do Emmet Ray as effortlessly as Ray does jazz
guitar.  His guitar picking somehow looks right, though he is not
credited with any of the music.  Much more notable is Samantha Morton
as Blanche.  Her acting keeps ones eyes focussed on the screen.  Screen
actors convey most of the plot through their voices.  In the vast
majority of films, audiences get most of the plot listening to the
soundtrack.  If one is given the choice of hearing but not seeing or
seeing but not hearing a familiar film, one quickly finds that for most
films, the former is the more satisfying experience.  Silent acting has
a different sort of dynamic and really grabs the audience's attention.
The result is that Hattie is by orders of magnitude the most compelling
character in the film.  Morton brings to the role virtues that might
have been mundane in the silent era, but which seem memorable in a
sound film.</P>
<P>     As Allen gets older he seems more and more to be writing about
flawed people who have really ruined their personal lives.  It would be
easy to interpret his characters as any given time as being a
commentary on his own behavior.  Clint Eastwood does the same sort of
thing, but at least his film plots seem to be better developed.  SWEET
AND LOWDOWN is a superficial morality play that needed considerably
more work.  I rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to
+4 scale.</P>
