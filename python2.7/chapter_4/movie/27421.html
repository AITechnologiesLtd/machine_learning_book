Traffic
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Steven Soderbergh
Written by Stephen Gaghan (based on the miniseries by Simon Moore)
Starring Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro, Erika Christensen, 
Luis Guzman, and Catherine Zeta-Jones
Grade:  C+</PRE>
<P>"Traffic" has the good fortune of going into wide release after receiving 
Golden Globe nominations and numerous critical top-ten list postings.  
Without much competition, it will probably do well at the Oscars, but despite 
good intentions and some impressive moments, "Traffic" fails to achieve its 
goals.</P>
<P>Rather than centering on a central protagonist, "Traffic" weaves together 
three major storylines:  a) Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) becomes 
the new drug czar while his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) becomes a 
drug addict; b) Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) 
pursues the Tijuana drug cartel and becomes allied with General Arturo 
Salazar (Tomas Milian), who seeks the same goal for his own reasons; and c) 
DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) watch 
Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) after arresting her drug-dealing husband 
(Steven Bauer).  Director Steven Soderbergh lacks the grace of Robert Altman, 
but he manages to keep all three storylines running simultaneously without 
losing the audience.</P>
<P>The primary reason "Traffic" doesn't fully succeed is that it wants to be 
several different movies:  a thought-provoking indictment of the failed "war 
on drugs," a portrait of addiction, and a gripping crime drama.  Perhaps a 
more talented director than Soderbergh might have been able to pull off this 
triple threat, but "Traffic" only manages to partially fulfill its goals.  
The critique of the methods and ideology of the drug war is spotty and often 
awkward (particularly when minor characters suddenly launch into speeches on 
subjects like the effect of NAFTA on drug traffic).  There's only one drug 
addict in the movie, which seems odd for an issue-driven film on the Drug 
Problem, and that one is unsympathetic.  Caroline Wakefield comes off as a 
spoiled brat, and her descent from prep school honor student to junkie whore 
doesn't elicit the pathos it should.  Erika Christensen does nothing to 
humanize her character.</P>
<P>Its strongest area is the crime drama vein with the parallel stories of 
Mexican and American cops who pursue the same cartel from different ends of 
the supply chain.  Especially compelling is Javier's plight.  An honest cop 
working within a corrupt system, Javier walks a winding and dangerous road 
paved with compromises.  Benicio Del Toro gives a remarkable performance.  A 
film like this tests the ability of an actor to develop his character with 
limited screen time.  Del Toro communicates more with a pensive look than 
most actors can with a soliloquy.</P>
<P>Also passing with high marks:  Don Cheadle and Michael Douglas.  I'm pleased 
that after so many wonderful supporting performances, Cheadle has gotten 
name-above-the-title recognition with this film.  He has great chemistry with 
Guzman (who deserves some recognition of his own).  I expected Robert 
Wakefield to be a heavy, but Douglas makes us feel the concern Robert has for 
his daughter.  </P>
<P>In contrast, the challenge of her first substantial role proves that 
Catherine Zeta-Jones has no acting ability whatsoever.  Her character has to 
go from being a high society wife whose world is overturned to a cop-killing 
drug dealer.  However, Zeta-Jones' performance shows no internal conflict or 
transformation.  She could be one of the worst actors in Hollywood.</P>
<P>In case you haven't guessed, I'm not a Soderbergh fan.  Ever since he came on 
the scene with "sex, lies, and videotape" in 1989, I've dismissed him as 
pretentious hack.  He's the valedictorian of the "Look at me, I'm an auteur" 
school of filmmaking.  (His classmates include Spike Lee and Oliver Stone).  
This style is characterized by an oppressive directorial presence that often 
undercuts the effectiveness of the film.  In "Traffic," Soderbergh joins the 
current trend toward monochromatic tints.  Douglas' scenes often have a blue 
tint while Del Toro's are yellow and grainy.  Luckily the power of those 
actors performances is not impeded by the distraction, but the heavily 
stylized approach seems a poor choice for a film that aspires to realism.</P>
<P>For those who like to play It's Ol' What's His Name, the supporting cast 
includes Dennis Quaid, Miguel Ferrer, Topher Grace (from "That 70's Show"), 
Amy Irving. Peter Riegert, Benjamin Bratt, Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, James 
Brolin, and several real-life senators (including Orrin Hatch, who does not 
read from "The Exorcist").</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  Doesn't deserve most of the Oscars it will win</P>
