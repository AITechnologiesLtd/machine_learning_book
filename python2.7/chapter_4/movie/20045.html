<P>Mystery Men is a movie about super-heroes who use garden tools, cutlery
and flatulence to fight evil. They dress up in threatening, homemade
costumes and try to rid the city of crime. This sounds like it would
make a terrific Saturday Night Live skit, but a 2-hour summer movie
is... perhaps pushing it. Despite it's sporadic enjoyment and visual
flare, Mystery Men simply can't hold together as a whole.</P>
<P>The premise is certainly creative. In futuristic Champion City, the
local super-hero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) controls crime and rules
the streets. Sporting more product-placement ads than Tiger Woods,
Amazing is a sponsor for companies like Pepsi, Penzoil and Mighty Whitey
Toothpaste. But lately, it seems, the crime rate in Champion City has
been experiencing a serious decline. Losing the spotlight and hoping to
regain his stature, Amazing springs super-villain Casanova Frankenstein
(Geoffrey Rush) from a mental institution so he can make headlines
again. But alas, the plan backfires, as Amazing is kidnapped by Casanova
to leave the city in destruction and peril.</P>
<P>Enter a squad of second-rate heroes who want to also clean up the city,
and rescue Captain Amazing in the process. Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) is
a leather-clad `ticking time-bomb of fury', The Shoveler (William H.
Macy) has incredible skill with gardening tools, The Blue Raja (Hank
Azaria) tosses kitchen utensils with precise accuracy, The Spleen (Paul
Reubens) uses the deadly art of passing gas to ward off villains, The
Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) wields a bowling ball containing her late
father's skull, and Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) has the ability to
disappear when no one is looking. The fate of the city is in their
hands. I know, it doesn't look good.</P>
<P>While Mystery Men certainly has it's moments, the foundation is lost
with all the frantic special effects and missed opportunities. Too many
gags fall flat as a result of botched humor and imperfect comic timing.
Everything becomes caught in a whirlwind of expensive sets and visuals,
and the movie begins to see the jokes as a second priority.
Still, there are bits and pieces of sheer delight. Wes Studi plays The
Sphinx, a (supposedly) wise and mysterious super-hero who offers the
group some philosophical views on fighting crime. His pointless lessons
include `If you doubt your powers, you add power to your doubts' and
`When you care what is outside, what is inside cares for you.' Studi,
best known for his role in The Last of the Mohicans, has never been
better.</P>
<P>Most of the cast fares exceptionally well. Stiller is believably angry,
but he adds an unexpected sensitive side to his character that was nice
to see. Macy is wonderful (as always), but given limitations. Azaria
does a remarkable job with a cheesy British accent, Garofalo is fun to
watch, and Reubens is appropriately disgusting. Geoffrey Rush is
somewhat irritating as the long-nailed, disco lovin' super-villain, but
his performance seems perfectly on target. All of the actors, despite
some unfunny material, never display a hint of desperation.</P>
<P>There are amusing one-liners everywhere. Debating whether businessman
Lance Ardon and Captain Amazing are the same person, Macy argues: `Lance
wears glasses. Captain Amazing doesn't.' Hmmm... perhaps a little (wink,
wink) reference to Superman and his alter-ego. But even with clever
zingers such as this, the film can't settle on a stable conglomeration
of comedy and action, as the scale never fixates on a confident center.
Laughs are absent from certain scenes where they could have been
plentiful, and minor when they should have been huge. I certainly won't
argue if Mystery Men is funny; it is. But with more skillful material,
the proceedings could have multiplied in comedic value.</P>
<P>For most, this will be entertaining. But take a look at the cast list
and the enormous potential that it carried, and perhaps you'll agree: it
could have been more.</P>
