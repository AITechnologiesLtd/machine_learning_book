<PRE>                 AFTER LIFE (Japanese with subtitles)
         A review by Mark R. Leeper in bullet-list form
           from the Toronto Internation Film Festival</PRE>
<P>     CAPSULE: The recently dead must each choose the most memorable
moment of their lives to have them filmed.  Once this process is
complete they can continue on to heaven.  The film combines documentary
footage with interviews with dramatic storytelling.  A little slow at
times, but worthwhile over all.  Rating: 6 (0 to 10), high +1 (-4 to
+4)</P>
<P>   - Directed by Hirokazu Kore-Eda.
   - When one dies, according to the premise of this film, each person
     must choose the best moment of his life to have it recreated on
     film, then to live it for eternity.  One gets a week complete with
     advisors to get this accomplished.  This is the story of one week
     in this odd purgatory.
   - The building used for this purpose seems to be some sort of old
     school building.  It is one much in needing of a repainting.
     There is a staff of advisors, many with their own problems, trying
     to help the dead in their task by counseling them on what moment
     to choose and then helping them to get it filmed.
   - Much of the film is real documentary footage of people choosing
     and talking about the most significant moment in their lives.
     Actors hired for the film and when possible they talked about
     moments from their lives.  Only the actors who had scripted key
     moments were those who were needed for the story.  This use of
     interview material reminiscent of some Aardman animated films.
   - Not clear why the moments chosen by the dead had to be filmed by
     them except that the director had the facilities.  Only one or two
     moments are seen being filmed.</P>
