<PRE>                                BENNY & JOON
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1993 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Can one schizophrenic find love with
     another?  BENNY & JOON says yes if the world of normal people
     does not tear them apart.  This is a film that will click
     with you or it won't.  I did not click for me.  Rating: 0 (-4
     to +4).</PRE>
<P>     There is a sort of film that works really well for a very narrow
audience and will leave almost everybody else wondering, "What was that all
about?"  It is a film with a narrow band of powerful appeal.  One of the
films that I thought really spoke to me was HAROLD AND MAUDE (1972).  Other
were JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN (1971) and KNIGHTRIDERS (1981).  One that missed me
entirely was BIRDY (1984).  I think I can see what others like about BIRDY,
but the film does not work very well for me.  Another film that just does
not do it for me is BENNY & JOON.</P>
<P>     Benny (played by Aidan Quinn) has no time for a life of his own.
Benny's life is split between his auto repair business and taking care of
his sister Joon (played by Mary Stuart Masterson).  Joon is ... well, Joon
is somewhat different.  Perhaps writer Barry Berman intended Joon to be
schizophrenic, though it is never actually said that is the case.  Whatever
her problem is, she spends her table passionately painting, setting things
on fire, placing emergency calls to Benny to pick up peanut butter,
directing traffic with ping-pong paddles and snorkel--that sort of thing.</P>
<P>     Then Joon loses a poker game and for Benny to pay off, he has to take
in a second person whose mental processes are different from the norm, Sam,
the cousin of a friend.  Sam (played by Johnny Depp) is barely literate but
has patterned himself on Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.  He dresses like
Keaton and can even mimic Keaton's inventive style of seeing unconventional
uses for everyday objects.  The tension of the story comes from Joon's
doctor wanting to institutionalize Joon, Benny wanting to keep Joon around,
Joon wanting to keep Sam around, and Benny wanting to be rid of Sam.</P>
<P>     Where the story does not work for me is on the contrivance and in the
view of mental illness.  With the exception of short bouts of panic, Joon
appears to be on a perpetual high.  Sam's illness appears to make him a
comic genius--though most, and for all I know, all, of his routines are
borrowed from silent films.  Sam's illness increases his creativity and the
film arranges for the right props to be at the right place and time to be
used.  The film says that mental illness has its positive side and that like
in MANHUNTER and THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, only the mentally ill can
understand the mentally ill.  The film is an interesting attempt but I rate
it only a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
