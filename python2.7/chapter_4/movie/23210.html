<P>Towards the end of The Cider House Rules, a dying character informs protagonist
Homer (Tobey Maguire) of the most important lesson in life: "Sometimes you
gotta break the rules to put it straight." The quote sums up the moral of the
entire film. Individuals are so unique that they must create their own rules to
survive and never become enslaved by what someone else thinks is suitable.
Tagging along and depending on another person for an enjoyable existence can
only make you blind to the rest of the world, you can only see through their
eyes, you see what they want to see and don't want to see. Homer at first is
blind to the rest of the world. Working in an orphanage performing illegal
abortions with his kind mentor Dr Larch (Michael Caine), the bright ingenuous
Homer has never seen a city or the ocean or anything at all outside of the
small town in Maine where he was born and raised. Even though Homer knows his
life contains nothing but joy in which younger orphans lionize him and nurses
respect him, he inexplicably yearns for more in life. From the books he has
read or from the only film he has ever seen (King Kong), he knows there is much
more out there to explore and cherish. When a young couple seeking an abortion
visit the orphanage, Homer decides that leaving town with them is the best
chance he'll have to answer his curiosity. </P>
<P>The message of the story is very clear, that this boy wants to discover what
the world is like by himself, without having to lean on another for assistance.
However, throughout the movie, in my opinion, Homer never actually completes
his true goal. There are very few times in which he is actually by himself
discovering and learning something different from before. It seemed like he
left the orphanage to avoid Dr. Larch's protectiveness, yet when he is on his
trip, he is always around someone else, as if this other person is a valid
replacement for the doctor. Homer hangs around co-workers during work time and
at night, around the beautiful and confused Candy (the ubiquitous Charlize
Theron) at other times, and around Candy's WWII pilot boyfriend Wally (Paul
Rudd) when he is in town. Wasn't the whole point of Homer's travels to discover
who he actually his as an individual? Or to make some decisions without asking
another person's opinion first? There were a some moments in which Homer takes
control but certainly not enough. Another irritating section of the story is
that Homer does not even leave the state of Maine in his journey for
self-clarification. It doesn't seem like much of an effort if you barely travel
a day's worth of time. Supposedly an attempt to "see what the world is really
like," Homer doesn't even change time zones. With such a short distance of
travelling, it is really hard to believe that Homer has really changed. </P>
<P>These unsatisfactory elements of the plot fortunately have no harm on the
fantastic acting from the splendid cast. Delroy Lindo and Michael Caine were
particularly superb as completely different men teaching Homer completely
different lessons. Tobey Maguire, who understandably is starting to get the
same roles in his films, is also perfectly naïve as the main character. The
only problem with the acting was that there were so many characters that some
talented actors, including Jane Alexander and Kate Nelligan, were underused. </P>
<P>John Irving, adapting his own novel of the same name, writes a fine script,
which contains a number of examples of characters breaking the traditional
rules to become happier in life. At times the message is a little too obviously
thrown in to conversations  but at other times it is perfectly subtle and
thought provoking. Lasse Hallstrom (My Life As a Dog, What's Eating Gilbert
Grape) adds his talented directorial skills to the picture. The New England
scenery is beautifully detailed and colorfully attractive to the eye. </P>
<P>Some unbelievably realistic acting, directing, and screenwriting make The Cider
House Rules fun to watch, but afterwards when trying to identify the true moral
of the story, some of the details are downright disappointing. </P>
<PRE>Grade: *** (out of four)</PRE>
