<P>Put out a movie with a talking parrot and my ass will be at the theater
in no time.  What kind of entertainment can top that?  While you stumble
about for a response, let me unleash the powerful story of Paulie.</P>
<P>Mind you, my friend Misha, a Russian immigrant janitor at the
university, passed on this tale to me.  He found Paulie locked up in the
dingy dark basement of the school and was amazed when he heard the bird
talk and sing like a human.  Now, when I see a bird that can talk and
sing like a human, I get a look on my face like that guy who dug up the
singing frog on the old Bugs Bunny cartoon.  But, my friend Misha is a
little bit naïve when it comes to exploitation, so I digress.</P>
<P>It turns out that Paulie has had one hell of a journey.  He started out
as a gift to a little girl named Marie.  They were the best of friends,
until her overbearing father came home from the war and got all nutso
when he found out that Marie had a stuttering problem.  The next thing
you know, the stupid kid takes a dive off of the roof like Michael
Douglas in The Game and Paulie is sent packing.</P>
<P>He finds his next home in a pawnshop run by Artie (Buddy Hackett…isn't
he dead?) and frequented by a two-bit hoodlum named Benny (Jay Mohr,
Jerry Maguire and the voice of Paulie).  Apparently, this is where he
picks up his tough Jersey accent and insulting demeanor.</P>
<P>Paulie is bought by a lonely widow named Ivy (Gena Rowlands, Unhook the
Stars) and the two decide to make their way across the country to find
Marie.  But, in a strange twist, Ivy is suddenly rendered blind and
Paulie is forced to continue on his own.  This is an important message
to all the kids out there – help a bird find his owner and lose the
power of sight.</P>
<P>His next stop is in East Los Angeles, where Paulie finds work at a taco
stand run by Igancio (Cheech Marin).  He falls in love with another
parrot named Lupe, but is again forced to move on.</P>
<P>A bit too heady, Paulie may turn kids off with little action and a lot
of talking.  But screw them, I liked it.</P>
