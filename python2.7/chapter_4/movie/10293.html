<P>THE WINGS OF THE DOVE is a tragic romance and a powerful film about the
painful personal prices that are sometimes paid for passion. I highly
recommend this movie as one of the most entertaining and emotionally
satisfying films of the year. A lavish costume drama with exquisite
production values, this moving story of friendship, love, and betrayal is
set in the early 20th century in the glamorous and cinematically lush world
of London drawing rooms and Venetian palazzos. The story centers around a
complex young woman named Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter) and her doomed
love for Merton Densher (Linus Roache). The acting in the film is superb in
general, and in particular, Bonham Carter's performance is extraordinary
and seems likely to win her an Oscar nomination.</P>
<P>The film is loosely based on Henry James' novel, but admirers of that great
writer should be warned that the sensibilities of the movie are not
entirely faithful to those of the book--for example, the film shows that
Kate and Densher have a steamy extramarital sexual relationship. And in
many other ways the characters in the movie seem strikingly modern compared
with those in the novel. Such liberties are partially justified by setting
the film around 1910, which is about ten years later than the time frame of
the book. Also, the film adaptation streamlines James' story to fit the
confines of the leaner form of the screenplay, making the movie less
cerebral and complex than the novel, while shifting the story's focus to
its emotional aspects. But the screen adaptation succeeds brilliantly in
finding those elements of the book that translate well to the visually
aggressive and emotionally immediate medium of film. The result is a
compelling and accessible movie that is not just for Henry James fans or
for the costume drama crowd--it's a movie for anyone who enjoys getting
caught up in the sweep of a passionate drama.</P>
<P>Bonham Carter imbues the story's main character Kate Croy with a spectrum
of emotions that makes her almost impossible to completely figure out. At
times Kate is almost as coolly cynical and selfishly scheming as a
film-noir heroine. But although Kate makes cynical decisions, it is not
clear whether she is a selfish monster or a victim who has been corrupted
by the cynicism of the society that surrounds her. She is a character who
at first inspires sympathy which later becomes mixed with disdain. I think
this adds resonance to her character, and as is often the case with
fictional characters who have substantial psychological depth, much of the
fascination lies in the fact that she is neither completely bad nor
completely good.</P>
<P>When the story opens, Kate's mother has died recently and her
opium-addicted father is living in poverty. Kate has been taken in by her
wealthy socialite aunt who is intent on matching her with a suitable
husband of appropriate wealth and social standing. The aunt forbids Kate to
see her father, fearing his negative influence on her will hurt her chances
for a good marriage. To complicate matters further, Kate is passionately in
love with Merton Densher, a young journalist who can barely support
himself. Kate's aunt also forbids her to see Densher, forcing her to meet
him secretly in such unlikely places as an elevator in the London
Underground. Kate is in the nearly impossible situation of being torn
between her love for Densher and her fear of being cut off financially by
her aunt. To make matters worse, her father is also being supported by her
aunt in return for his staying away from Kate. Thus, it is more than
destitution that Kate fears--she is afraid her aunt's wrath will hurt her
father. </P>
<P>Kate's dream of being able to openly be with the man she loves seems all
but impossible. But things change when Millie Theale (Alison Elliott), a
wealthy American heiress, enters the glittering social scene. Kate soon
learns that Millie harbors a tragic secret: The heiress suffers from a
fatal disease and is not expected to live much longer. Based on this
information, Kate devises a desperate scheme that she hopes will allow her
to end her financial dependence on her aunt and marry Densher. Since I
don't want to spoil the story for those not familiar with it, I'll say no
more about how all this plays out, but I will say that things come out
quite a bit differently from what I think most people will expect. </P>
<P>In my opinion, Bonham Carter's performance steals the show, but there are
also other strong performances. As Kate's aunt, Charlotte Rampling has just
the right touch of icily patrician villainy. Linus Roache takes on a
difficult role with Merton Densher--he plays a man weak enough to be putty
in the hands of a manipulative woman, yet he manages to project enough
masculine appeal to make it credible that women like Kate and Millie would
be in love with him. And although Alison Elliot does not have the kind of
patrician looks that would make her perfect for the part of Millie Theale,
she brings to the role the kind of luminosity and innocence that makes her
portrayal come to life.</P>
<P>The gorgeous cinematography--which includes stunning location shooting in
Venice, Italy--heightens the film's impact while adding additional layers
of subtle meaning. I interpreted the seductive appeal of the visual
opulence of some of the imagery as a metaphor paralleling the hedonistic
influences that helped to shape the actions of Kate, Densher, and Millie. I
thought that the cinematography's lushness was the perfect way to
illustrate luxury's sensual lure. Especially effective was the scene in
which Millie and Kate walk through an exhibition hall where the works of
the Viennese artist Gustav Klimt are being exhibited. Klimt's paintings
brilliantly foreshadow the sensual richness and passionate sexuality of
much of what is about to unfold in the film. I was also particularly
impressed by the lyrical, innovative, and silkily smooth visual transitions
between the scenes; they reminded me of the facile, poetic complexity of
Henry James' prose style.</P>
<P>One thing the film did that struck me as incredibly powerful was to show
just how much Kate has to lose by contrasting the world of wealth and
privilege with the world that she is likely to descend to if she does not
obey her aunt's wishes. In one stunning scene, Kate sneaks out to slip her
father an expensive piece of jewelry her aunt had presented her as a gift.
Kate gives the necklace to a woman standing at the door of an opium den
that her father patronizes. The camera then provides a glimpse of the den's
dark and ominous interior, which is tinged with a nightmare's horror. Much
later, near the end of the film, comes another powerful scene, similar in
its feeling of heartbreak, when Kate makes love with Densher in his small,
stark London apartment. The treatment of this scene is anything but
romantic; it is a scene of desperation and tragedy. Both Bonham Carter and
Roache are unforgettable here as two people whose love for each other has
been poisoned by what they have done and the kind of people they have
become.</P>
<P>The psychological and intellectual depth of Henry James' stories have
proven irresistible to filmmakers during the past couple of years, and THE
WINGS OF THE DOVE is the third recent major movie to have been adapted from
the great writer's novels, the other two being THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY and
WASHINGTON SQUARE. While all three are films of high quality, it seems
probable that general contemporary audiences will like THE WINGS OF THE
DOVE better than the other two, although some Henry James devotees will
never be able to get past the fact that great liberties were taken in
adapting this classic work to the screen. </P>
