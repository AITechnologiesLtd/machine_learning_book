<PRE>THE MATCHMAKER
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Janeane Garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea 
a couple years ago with THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS but is almost 
excruciating in THE MATCHMAKER. This is a by-the-books movie that 
plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few 
laughs. It also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon 
and manages to fall flat there, too.</P>
<P>        Garofalo plays a campaign aide to a Massacusetts senator (Jay 
O. Sanders) running for reelection. Denis Leary plays the stereotypical 
Strategist With No Ethics who decides the only way for the scandal-
plagued senator to win is to play up his Irish roots and cash in on that 
Boston Roman Catholic Democrat contingent that's made the Kennedy 
family so popular. So Leary orders Garofalo to go to Ireland and dig 
up some relatives to exploit.</P>
<P>        She soon learns why "Easier said than done" is the mantra of 
movies like this. THE MATCHMAKER falls for every cliche of things that 
can go wrong -- Garofalo has to take a tiny plane to Ireland, almost 
misses the bus to town, can't get a hotel room, ends up in the smallest, 
trashiest one around, has a dog piss on her luggage, and so on.</P>
<P>        Then comes what Roger Ebert calls the "Meet Cute." It 
happens in every romance: the man and woman have to meet each 
other for the first time in some unconventional, cinematic way. In THE 
MATCHMAKER, it happens when Garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom 
and finds a nude Sean (David O'Hara) in the bathtub, his dog sitting at 
his side. No points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water 
on her luggage.</P>
<P>        Also no points for guessing Garofalo hates O'Hara on sight. 
That's how it works in movies like these. I know from the instant I saw 
that Irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile, then 
succumb to his charms, live happily for a reel or so before allowing 
some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil, after 
which they'd reconcile in time for a happy Irish tune to play over the 
end credits.</P>
<P>        I haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet. Garofalo comes to 
the small Ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival, 
during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future 
of bliss. Milo O'Shea (who looks like an Irish Tom Snyder) is the 
matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of 
wisdom and bring lonely souls together. Rest assured he'll do all he 
can to match up Garofalo and O'Hara. Oh, and in keeping with THE 
MATCHMAKER's utter predictability, he dies toward the end.</P>
<P>        What the message here? Sometimes even the most respectable 
person of comedic distinction, like Garofalo, will sell out with a weak 
script. I was excited to see Garofalo and Leary in the same movie, but 
they actually only have two or three scenes together. Leary stays 
stateside, for the most part, yelling at Garofalo over the phone and 
generally being an asshole. He even undoes himself with the old 
Microphone's Still On After He's Done Giving The Speech cliche. 
Both of them should have known better.</P>
