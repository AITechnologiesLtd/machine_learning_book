<PRE>US Marshals</PRE>
<PRE>A Review by Fred M. Hung</PRE>
<P>I should have known what to expect when I saw the director, Stuart
Baird, whose last work was Executive Decision, a mildly entertaining but
mostly formulaic and uneven Die Hard in air.  In US Marshals, Sam Gerard
is again on the hunt for Sheridan, a former Marine, Special Forces. 
Robert Downey, Jr., DSS Special Agent John Royce, is a new addition to
the team.  </P>
<P>The first Fugitive was a remake of the old TV series, and no one had
more doubts than I about its effectiveness.  Yet the sheer unrelenting
pace and amazingly strong characters made the film so much more than the
sum of its parts.  Tommy Lee Jones was riveting, full of energy resolve,
and professionalism.  Many will complain that US Marshals suffers
because it lacks Harrison Ford, but Ford's performance, though solid,
was not particularly out of his narrow range.  In fact, you can supplant
Ford's President from Air Force One with Dr. Richard Kimble and one
could scarcely tell the difference.  What made Fugitive truly great was
the combination of Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard, a noble Wyatt Earp who,
though chasing our hero Harrison Ford, is difficult to dismiss, and
impossible to hate.  </P>
<P>US Marshals is disappointing, but not in the material, in the editing. 
In a film class I took back in college, we were taught that editing
creates continuity, and thus makes the story of the film.  The blame,
therefore, must fall on Baird.  In fact, all the elements of a good film
are present in US Marshals, action, plots and subplots, bad guys, and
noble good guys.  Unfortunately, nothing successfully gels these
components.  Even Jerry Goldsmith, whose musical scores are usually
quite engrossing, produces a nondescript and absolutely nonemotive
effort.  At times I even wondered whether they had forgotten to add a
score.  </P>
<P>Like Executive Decision, US Marshals suffers from moments of intensity,
to great lulls in rhythm.  The plane crash where Snipe's Sheridan
escapes is preceded by a very tepid formal where Gerard's superior
orders him to take vacation.   In addition, The supporting cast blends
too easily in the background to be noticeable.  The chemistry between
Sam Gerard and his men in the Fugitive created levity in the moments
when they interacted.  In the US Marshals Baird attempts to mimic these
moments, but they too seem forced. </P>
<P>While certainly disappointing, US Marshals is not a horrible film, but
audience expectation is so much greater.  I can think about a dozen
directors, namely Michael Bay, Tony Scott, John McTiernan, and certainly
Andrew Davis (although Chain Reaction was pretty lackluster) that could
have made more of this solid cast.  What a waste of talent.</P>
