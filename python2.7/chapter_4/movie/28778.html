<PRE>SECRETS OF SILICON VALLEY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Deborah Kaufman and Alan Snitow's SECRETS OF SILICON VALLEY tries 
without much luck to be a hard-hitting exposé of the plight of low 
income workers in the Silicon Valley.  A frustrating film, it is more 
memorable for its unasked questions than for the answers it receives.    </P>
<P>Typical of the unchallenged assertions is the one that the reason that 
unions have had almost no success in the Silicon Valley is that the 
unions are afraid of the big corporations.  General Motors is no 
mom-and-pop operation, and the union has had tremendous success 
organizing its workers in Michigan.  Could it be instead that assembly 
line workers here in the Silicon Valley generally like their jobs and 
are happy to have them?  (I have a close relative who works on a high 
tech assembly line.  She likes her job and is only frustrated on the 
days when there isn't enough to do.)</P>
<P>The documentary, which is told without narration, interviews two main 
subjects, Magda Escobar and Raj Jayadev.  Escobar runs a non-profit 
computer training center in East Palo Alto.  Although she worries about 
the digital divide between the rich and poor, the filmmakers concentrate 
much of the time on her thoughts on the changes in the poor town of East 
Palo Alto, where new stores from Home Depot to McDonalds are changing 
the business landscape.  The savviest thing that Escobar does is to 
create a giant mural outside her group's new facility.  When President 
Clinton wants just the right photo op, his team picks it for one of his 
pop-in-and-pop-out visits.  Jessie Jackson shows up too, so that he can 
be part of the group which seems to be more media than public.</P>
<P>In the more controversial part, Jayadev, an employee of Manpower who 
works on temporary assignment at HP, talks about alleged health and 
safety issues on the printer packaging assembly line.  After circulating 
a petition among his fellow workers, he is let go by Manpower, a 
dismissal which he claims was because of his safety issues complaints.  
Whether any of his assertions have merit, we have little idea since he 
is the only one interviewed about them.</P>
<P>Interspersed with the interviews of these two principals, the 
documentary shows footage of the famous Sand Hill Challenge, a soap box 
derby of sorts for venture capital firms and high tech companies.  
Escobar's company partners with a VC firm on one of the cars.  Also 
included is stock television news footage of various technology leaders 
like Carly Fiorina, HP's CEO.  "This is a growth industry, and there is 
no end to the growth in sight," she tells the camera.  Well, no end, but 
lots of hiccups along the way as we have so recently been reminded as 
the economy as gone into a stall.</P>
<P>A documentary should teach or provoke, preferably both.  It is hard to 
figure out what SECRETS OF SILICON VALLEY has to say to us that we 
didn't already know.  Jayadev does rile us up some, but mainly because 
the filmmakers don't challenge him more or ask some pointed question to 
those he is accusing.</P>
<P>SECRETS OF SILICON VALLEY runs 1:00.  It is not rated but would be a G 
and acceptable for all ages.</P>
