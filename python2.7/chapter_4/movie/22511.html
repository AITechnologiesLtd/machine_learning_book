<P>"Man on the Moon" -- Andy Kaufman in a Wrestling Match
- yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah</P>
<P>To me, Andy Kaufman was some semi-talented actor who
spent a few years on a show called Taxi.  I never
really watched the show, except when I was channel
surfing and happened to catch it for a minute or two. 
I couldn't even tell you any of the characters on the
show - that is, except for Latka, played by Andy
Kaufman.  He stood out.  He was a shy-looking,
diminutive actor who spoke like he had just inhaled
dangerous amounts of helium.  And I always asked
myself, 'what's the deal with this guy?'</P>
<P>"Man on the Moon" doesn't try to answer this question.
 It doesn't try to be a detailed biography of Kaufman.
 Rather, it is more like a visual diary that
illustrates a few of the more unique chapters in this
performer's life.  And unique is a very good word. 
Kaufman's oeuvre of wacky performances include a
wicked transformation into Elvis; an affable foreign
mechanic named Latka; a crass lounge singing alter
ego, and a trash talking wrestler who proclaimed
himself to be the Inter-Gender champion because no
woman could beat him.  Kaufman was considered
brilliant by a few and enigmatic by some, and
eventually scorned by many.</P>
<P>But his brand of humor was not even supposed to be
humor at all.  Instead, Kaufman would say that they
were experiments in behavior.  He was sometimes funny,
sometimes mean-spirited, sometimes edgy, and sometimes
tasteless.  But despite his many facades, he was
always sincere at trying to give the public something
unexpected.  He wanted to shock the audience and to
elicit genuine emotion.  His philosophy was not about
making people laugh.  It was about making people
react.  The result was that some would roll in the
aisle with laughter while the person seated next to
him would be scratching his head in wonderment.  </P>
<P>"MOTM" stars Jim Carrey, who is showing moviegoers
that he's becoming much more than a 2-dimensional
comedian who relies on squeezing his butt cheeks and
molding his rubbery face.  Carrey ably transforms
himself into the Kaufman persona.  Though Kaufman has
great schemes that he wants to set in motion, he is
not always the sole architect.  Helping him are is
long-time friend, Bob (Paul Giamatti), an agent (Danny
DeVito), and an extremely patient girlfriend (Courtney
Love).  Yet, Andy is always engaging in his own
machinations, frequently even catching his closest
friends and family members off guard.  It gets to the
point that even the National Enquirer ignores rumors
about him because they've 'been burned too many times
before.'</P>
<P>In some ways, Kaufman was an immature boy trapped in a
man's body.  In other ways, he may have been
considered a visionary performer.  But I think that if
he lived in the 1990s, he would have been considered a
very capable performance artist.  This film gave me a
new sense of respect for him.  He was definitely
fighting an uphill battle, but perhaps opened the door
for people like Howard Stern and helped to make
'Professional' wrestling more mainstream.  In Kaufman,
there is an undeniable sweetness to him, despite his
need to shock and to stay one step ahead of the
audience.</P>
<P>I am recommending the film for two reasons.  The first
is because Jim Carrey delivers an Oscar-worthy
performance, who not only does a hauntingly real
imitation of the late Kaufman but also shows unusual
dramatic depth.  It's difficult to be a serious clown,
but Carrey shows great restraint.  Also, credit
Director Milos Foreman for being able to present a
film whose tone accurately mimics Kaufman's
unpredictability and for giving us a thoughtful look
into why Kaufman probably deserved more credit than he
received.  </P>
<PRE>Grade:         B+ if you like Andy Kaufman or Jim Carrey.
B   for everyone else.</PRE>
