<P>There's just something about John Cusack, isn't there? His offbeat sense
of humor and quirky idiosyncrasies have been meticulously evident
throughout the actor's career. From `Say Anything' to `Grosse Point
Blank', everything is intact, and to such an extent that I'm sure
certain individuals believe he's always played the same character. `High
Fidelity' does little else but continue the curious trend, with Cusack
doing strict Cusack, but progression is attained nonetheless. How does
he manage it? It always helps to have a fresh and limber screenplay in
which the comedic whimsy is worthy of Cusack's eccentric charm. `High
Fidelity' is, in turn, more than worthy.</P>
<P>Ever since a brief liaison under the football bleachers in grade 7, Rob
Gordon (Cusack) has been cursed with a romantic hex. All of his
relationships seem to hinge on some essential bond of devotion or love,
and every time, Rob blows it. Now, he owns a record store called
Championship Vinyl, and toils over his current possible break-up with
Laura (Iben Hjejle), who -- *gasp* -- may be the one he's been searching
for all along. The early structure of `High Fidelity' is built around
presenting Rob's ‘Top Five Break-ups', which we see in amusing
chronological flashbacks. The casting in these scenarios ensures some
fun and potential surprise for audience members. Catherine Zeta-Jones
appears, sporting a deck of snobbish qualities, as a controlling
romantic interest who spews dialogue in rapid-fire bursts. And then
there's Lili Taylor, returning to comfortable ground after `The
Haunting', playing a timid partner who seems like a perfect match for
Rob.</P>
<P>`High Fidelity' spins a surprisingly affectionate romantic yarn that
simmers quietly under the surface without ever boiling over. This
eventually generates a sense of observant charm, which is so slight and
unanticipated that it may catch you off-guard. In addition, the cast is
populated with well-realized characters whom every actor seems perfectly
tailored for. Some of the most seasoned comedy is derived from Rob's two
employees: Barry (Jack Black), a rash and egotistical jerk who grills
any customer who wishes to buy a crummy record, and Dick (Todd Louiso),
a bashful but friendly music fanatic who seems hesitant to do anything.
Both actors are perfect in their respective roles, but Black goes
directly to town as Barry, lighting up the silver screen in a bombastic
showcase of astonishing energy that jacks up the entertainment level a
good two or three notches. John's sister, Joan Cusack, appears welcomely
as a mutual friend of Rob and Laura's. Rounding out the supporting cast
is the ceaselessly wonderful Tim Robbins, hilarious as an aging
spiritual hipster who becomes romantically entangled with Laura. A
confrontation with he and Rob, in which three alternate `Scooby Doo'
situations are presented, is manic and inspired.</P>
<P>`High Fidelity', based on the novel by Nick Hornby, only stumbles over a
few thematic elements. In the screen translation, Rob's character seems
to be confined at times, and lacking the edge and prickly cynicism that
his romantically-challenged character would probably envelop. Director
Stephen Frears (`The Grifters') uses the continual device of Rob talking
directly into the camera to explain his various predicaments. Thanks to
Cusack's spontaneity and distinguished range, this usually works, but
Rob's chats with the audience occasionally grow tiresome because they
lack a certain dimension of character. But no bother. Cusack, even with
the sporadic instance of jarred emotions, manages to excel in presenting
an offbeat character.... as he always does. It is pretty standard
terrain, but Frears hits the nail of relationships on the head, and
everyone seems to evolve to the liking of the viewer. Take Cusack's
effortless chemistry with `Cosby' girl Lisa Bonet, playing a beautiful
young singing talent, and you get the basic gist of the balmy approach
that `High Fidelity' is gunning for.</P>
<P>I was surprised at how efficiently `High Fidelity' achieved some
decisive romantic truth. It's a sweet, enjoyable motion picture,
peppered with observant chuckles and immensely likable performances.
It's familiar turf for Cusack, but `High Fidelity' sheds some gentle
light on the awkward state of dating and relationships, and gets inside
the head of your average single male. Yes, that's one small step for
John Cusack, one giant leap for mankind.</P>
