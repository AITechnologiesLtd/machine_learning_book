GOOD WILL HUNTING
A film by Gus Van Sant
Starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, and 
Stellan Skaarsgard
Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck</PRE>
<P>    One of the most stunning pictures of 1997, "GOOD WILL HUNTING"
emerged from winter season as one of the best films of the year, and a
blockbuster hit for Miramax.  Featuring a hip, young cast, and a
wonderful role by Robin Williams, "GWH" was rewarded with 2 Oscar
victories, including Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting
Actor, for Williams.</P>
<P>The plot is relatively simple and straightforward.  Will Hunting
(Damon) is the classic definition of a rebel.  Born and raised in
South Boston by foster parents, Will is a fighter, a kid of the
streets, who gets into fights without being asked, who bums around
bars with his friends, having a few drinks between jobs.  Will is also
a genius.  His mind is brilliant, and he has the education of a
Harvard student, without the degree.</P>
<P>His secret is discovered when one day, he is caught by Professor
Gerald Lambeau (Skaarsgard) while working on a complex Fourier system
Lambeau had put up on a blackboard as a challenge to his students.
Lambeau immediately "rescues" the boy from an impeding jail term, and
takes him to a number of therapists to heal his mind.  Finally, he
asks college roommate Sean McGuire (Williams), himself a Southie as
well, to help the boy.  What follows is a journey for Will and Sean,
as both grow closer during the sessions.  The story also deals with
Will's development, his love for Skylar (Driver), and his complicated
friendship with Chuckie (Affleck).</P>
<P>The screenplay is riddled with old movie cliches, and is as
predictable as any other.  What sets "GOOD WILL HUNTING" apart,
however, is the direction of Gus Van Sant, as well as the acting of
the principal roles.  Van Sant uses all sorts of angles and lighting
to acheive brilliant technical shots while drawing the audience into
the story.  While the story may be flawed, the dialogue certainly
isn't.  Damon and Affleck wrote an endearing script, one which rewards
excellent performances with great pieces of dialogue, and fantastic
set pieces.</P>
<P>The performances are nothing short of exquisite.  Damon and
Affleck are wonderful, absolutely wonderful.  Driver is sweet and
touching, and Skaarsgard is as good as ever.  But the film belongs to
Williams' tortured performance as McGuire.  It is his story that is
told as well, his change from sorrow to relief.  The script tracks a
parallel story in Sean McGuire's, and Williams pours more into this
performance than any other in recent memory.  Damon is nothing short
of outstanding in his lead role, but Williams just steals every shot
he has.  With a wonderful score and a gorgeous ending, this film is
certainly one of the finest of 1997, and a stunning debut for
screenwriters Damon and Affleck.</P>
