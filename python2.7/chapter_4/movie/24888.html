<P>"Well this is not Mission: Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission:
Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you." 
  ---Agent Swanbeck (Sir Anthony Hopkins), the series' new Agent Phelps,
takes Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) down a notch. </P>
<P>A Russian scientist (Rade Serbedzija) has created a new virus (and its
antidote) called Chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of
injection.  A rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), wants to
use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into
selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company (he knows it
will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the
virus he is going to cause).  Posing as Ethan Hunt, Ambrose gains the
confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure, not
realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to
prevent exactly what Ambrose was trying to do.  </P>
<P>The real Ethan Hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful
thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to assist the IMF team in
retrieving the stolen goods.  Ethan and Nyah fall quickly in love, but
Ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new
love has only been hired because she was a former lover of Ambrose's. 
Reluctantly, he sets up Nyah to be rescued from prison by Ambrose so she
can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team. 
Ethan must race against time to keep Ambrose from obtaining and
spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to Nyah. </P>
<P>Although the first Mission:Impossible film was a moderate box office
success, audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too
confusing and there wasn't much action (although being a fan of the
series both old and new, I thought the movie was pretty decent and
especially gutsy to make Phelps a bad guy).  That problem has been
rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible (courtesy of
one of the writers of the previous entry, Robert Towne) and by turning
the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of
action film guru John Woo.  The end result is one of the most
entertaining (yet simple) action films made in a long while. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow,
dwelling mainly on Ethan and Nyah's quickly blossoming romance and
seeming more in place in a James Bond film than with the less glamorous
Mission:Impossible TV series.  Ethan's conflict is a compelling one, but
it seems very rushed (and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck
that Ethan himself causes!).  John Woo handles all of this with an
artistic flair that seems out of place, featuring a great deal of slow
fades and dramatically framed close-ups.  The surreal nature of these
sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film. </P>
<P>Thankfully though, at the point Ambrose discovers Nyah's deception,
Mission:Impossible II becomes very entertaining and action-packed. 
Robert Towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the
first film and parodies them during a sequence where Ethan must break
into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the
virus.  After that, the action scenes just begin to build in intensity,
as is the case with many of Woo's previous high-octane films.  The final
half hour is an all out assault of action (a good deal of which is
ruined by the trailer, unfortunately).  </P>
<P>As far as summer entertainment goes, Mission:Impossible II is
serviceable fare.  Anyone looking for hardcore action won't be
disappointed (except for during the first half of the film, perhaps). 
Even if you weren't a fan of the first film, this entry deserves some
checking out.  [PG-13]</P>
