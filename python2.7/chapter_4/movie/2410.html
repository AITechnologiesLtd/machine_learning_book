<PRE>                                     THE TRIAL
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     It goes without saying that no one walks into a film adaptation of
a Kafka novel expecting something created for general consumption.  THE
TRIAL, however, takes this a step further, as significant portions of
the narrative are impossible to comprehend without an intimate
knowledge of the author and his works.  The book is strange; the movie,
even stranger.</P>
<P>     One morning, Josef K (Kyle MacLachlan) wakes up to find that he's
been arrested for no apparent reason.  There are no charges or, if
there are, no one is willing to tell him what they are, and his
"hearing" turns into a kangaroo court where a couple tumbles around on
the floor in the throes of sexual abandon while Josef is trying to give
an impassioned speech in his defense.  Later, still trying to figure
out what has gone wrong with the justice system, he seeks advice from
various sources, including a painter (Alfred Molina), a lawyer (Jason
Robards), and a priest (Anthony Hopkins).</P>
<P>     THE TRIAL is a visually impressive motion picture, with many
beautifully framed, gothic-like shots of Prague, where it was filmed.
Equally noteworthy are a number of supporting performances, including
those by Michael Kitchen (the king from TO PLAY THE KING and the owner
of the villa in ENCHANTED APRIL), Polly Walker (also from ENCHANTED
APRIL), Jason Robards, David Thewlis (NAKED), Alfred Molina, and (of
course) Anthony Hopkins.</P>
<P>     Kyle MacLachlan plays the part of Josef K with an icy detachment
that makes the character seem all too like another MacLachlan
personality--that of TWIN PEAKS' agent Cooper (odd how the actor seems
to gravitate to bizarre projects).  Unfortunately, Cooper and Josef
aren't anything alike, and Mr. MacLachlan's aloofness creates a schism
between the audience and Josef--it's difficult, if not impossible, to
identify with THE TRIAL's protagonist.  And what in the world is that
on-and-off accent supposed to be?</P>
<P>     Certain minor themes of the film are easily recognizable--those
of the corruption of justice and the dehumanization of society--but
the overall message of THE TRIAL remains murky.  In a key scene near
the end, Anthony Hopkins delivers a lengthy parable that is supposed to
clear things up, but this sequence is so cryptic that it can easily
leave the viewer even more confused than before.</P>
<P>     Fundamentally, THE TRIAL is unsatisfying.  High production values
and good acting aren't everything.  The film lacks energy, and comes
across as a pedantic, obtuse, two-hour nightmare.  Since the intentions
of this film (and the novel from which it was adapted) do not come
across clearly, "what's the point?" becomes a fair question to ask.
Kafka aficionados will likely find a great deal to chew over, but most
everyone else will be baffled and perhaps even a little annoyed.</P>
