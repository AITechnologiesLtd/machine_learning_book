<P>The hardest part about 3BC having been more or less down for two weeks,
is coming back to review new movies that I really didn't want to watch.
AMERICAN PIE 2?  Ewww.  THE OTHERS?  Not my speed.  SPY KIDS, The
Director's Cut?  Fat chance.  And as queasy as I am, the thought of
watching the grossout humor of OSMOSIS JONES just wasn't twisting my
throttle.  But a Chick's gotta review *something*, I reckon; and there
is the matter of one Laurence Fishburne, with a little David Hyde
Pierce, being part of the action.  In the end, Fishburne and Pierce they
almost cancelled out the Farrelly Brothers' influence.  Well, almost.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**)
Frank Pepperidge is, in a word, filthy - inside and out.  A
misunderstood widower, only his daughter Shane (Elena Franklin) seems to
be trying to help Frank find a clue again; Shane constantly fights a
losing battle to get Frank to eat healthy, exercise, and generally live
right, but not even a stint in the Army can help Fr...oops, wrong movie.
Uh...Frank's equally nasty bud Bob (Chris Elliott) is as codependent as
they come; and after Frank...loosed himself on Shane's teacher Mrs. Boyd
(Molly Shannon), Frank's gettin' no love from that side of the aisle,
either.</P>
<P>But Frank has a whole crew waiting in the wings to help him.  Actually,
they're waiting inside Frank's body: fighting off colds, allergies,
Twinkies, and the occasional monkey-handled egg, are a team of
hard-working antibodies and white-blood cells, the most strident of
which is Officer Osmosis Jones (voice of Chris Rock).  Due to a bad
history old Ozzie has with his Police Chief (Joel Silver), Oz is
initially banished to patrolling the boring mouth sector of The City Of
Frank; but when Cold Tablet Drixoral (David Hyde Pierce) is dispatched
to fight off what the Chief, Mayor Phlegmming (William Shatner), and
Brand...I mean, the Mayor's assistant, Leah (Brandy) think is merely a
cold virus, Ozzie is assigned to help Drix relieve Frank's symptoms.
What begins as a routine cleanup of the sewer that is Frank, though,
soon turns into Something Else, when Ozzie discovers that a SuperVirus
named Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) is out to terminate Frank.</P>
<P>[Man, does that look weird typed-out.]</P>
<P>The Upshot:
I can describe OSMOSIS JONES in three words: "punny", "nasty", and "PG".
That last bit - that is, the film's PG rating - holds the key to its
lack of success, I think; and, keeping my disdain for the Farrellys'
previous effort, ME, MYSELF & IRENE in mind, my acknowledgement of that
rating's shortcomings is also the source of some discomfort for me.</P>
<P>You see, I opine that with that rein-in-the-madcap PG rating acting as
an albatross hanging around its neck, OSMOSIS JONES didn't, *couldn't*,
go far enough in making itself funnier to adult viewers.  In our
abbreviated audience (the empty seats, no doubt, were due to the throngs
who rushed to see Pie Deux), you could hear a pin drop as pun after pun
fell on deaf ears: the adults who thought the humor was merely "cute",
and the kidlets who'd forgotten everything they knew about the "science"
of OSMOSIS JONES well before summer break began.</P>
<P>That's too bad, too; I really wanted OJ [sorry] to succeed.  Certainly,
the cast should have been up for it; with its collection of comics,
humorists, and damn fine actors, one would think OJ's success was
written in the stars.  To be sure, Fishburne tore it up as Thrax, the
baddest mutha of a germ this side of ebola - though I couldn't help but
think about the inherent problems with trying to make a seemingly
AIDS-like virus, *funny*; that Sir Laurence succeeded, and playfully so,
is a testament to just how great an actor he is, even with this type of
material.  Pierce, an equally great comic actor in his own right (if
you've never seen this modern-day Buster Keaton as "Niles" from
FRASIERR, you don't know what you've been missing), made a wonderful
Drix, though I was reminded of his similar voice acting in A BUG'S LIFE;
the comparison is favorable, but still, too similar.</P>
<P>Bill Murray reinvented his CADDYSHACK character, though besides the icky
subject matter itself, Murray's character was the other primary reason I
hesitated on going to see OSMOSIS JONES in the first place; I had hoped
Murray would've gotten past all of that by now.  Watching Murray Go
There Again was distressing, much the same as if, for instance, Steve
Martin suddenly picked up his Wild And Crazy Guy schtick again...ewww.
Still, a slovenly Frank was necessary for OJ to work - and my
reservations aside, I can think of no better actor to have played this
slob than Murray.  As for the balance of the cast, I had to be reminded
that William "KHAAAAN!" Shatner voiced The Mayor Of Frank, so my Issues
weren't really with him, nor was it with Ron "Opie" Howard's brief punny
bit as Tom Colonic, the Mayor's chief rival, or singer Brandy as The
Mayor's headstrong assistant, Leah.  Even Chris Rock, who normally gets
on my nerves in too large a dose, was quite tame as OSMOSIS JONES.</P>
<P>Aye, there's the rub.  Rock was tame; *too* tame, methinks.  He tried
hard, but even with the likes of Fishburne and Pierce helping to class
up the joint, he couldn't seem to elevate OSMOSIS JONES beyond the its
punny nature, saddled with the limitations of its diluted grossout
humor.  Look for a few chuckles here and there, a couple of good lines
(Fishburne has the best one late in the movie), and a cute riff on
Fishburne's THE MATRIX - but don't expect too much here.  Like I said,
too bad.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
Surely, there must be a compromise between the all-out illness of an
R-rated "Irene" and the cute but PG-weakened punnyness of an OSMOSIS
JONES, some middle ground where adults can get their laugh groove on
without having our intelligence insulted, isn't there?  I'm still
looking for that middle ground - though you'll notice I'm not holding my
breath.</P>
<P>OSMOSIS JONES (rating: flashing yellowlight):
     Diagnosis: too much Farrelly, not enough funny.</P>
