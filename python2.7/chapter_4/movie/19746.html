<PRE>`Runaway Bride' – Lighter than Air, Fluffier than a Cloud
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>Some studio executive must have been comfortably reclining back in his
office chair with his feet planted on his desk thinking about what the
next great movie project will be.  This executive is probably a
last-minute doer.  And just before the deadline hits, he snaps his
finger and says ‘aha', as if an idea so clever entered his mind that he
rushes forth convinced that he has a winner.  This idea was to reunite
the winning team that brought us the wonderful 1990 fairy tale, Pretty
Woman.  With Director Gary Marshall again at the helm, Julia Robert's
radiant smile, and Richard Gere's good looks, how can this miss?  Well…</P>
<P>Gere plays Ike Graham, a columnist for USA Today who seems to approach
his job much like the aforementioned studio executive.  With a deadline
fast approaching, he sips his drink at the local watering hole trying
to come up with his latest article.  Graham's column is accused of
being laced with bitter diatribes of the opposite sex, and is the
target of many a hate mail from his female readers.  Even little old
ladies come up to him and hit him with rolled up newspapers.  At the
bar, he meets a person who tells him of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts), a
serial fiancée who seems to live for nothing other than pulling the
heartstrings of men and then leaving them at the altar.  Like the
studio executive, Ike is so convinced that this idea is a winner that
he rushes forth with this article without even checking the facts. 
Maggie writes a bitter note to Ike's editor (Rita Wilson), and he is
subsequently fired.  Ike's best friend (Hector Elizondo) tells him to
go do some personal research on the matter to get his job and his
reputation back.  Is she really as bad as they say?</P>
<P>So, now he's off to picturesque Hale, MD to determine the truth of
Maggie Carpenter.  Maggie is completely flustered by his presence,
especially in light of her impending fourth upcoming wedding attempt to
Coach Bob (Christopher Meloni).  She does his best to brush him off,
but Ike is not so easily dissuaded.  And before you know it, he's
making friends with Maggie's sottish but likeable dad, her spirited
grandma, and her best friend, played by Joan Cusack.  Despite their
initial dislike for one another, they seem to have an understanding for
one another.  After questioning her former jilted fiancés, he realizes
that it's not because she's a mean-spirited person.  Rather, it's
because she just doesn't know what she wants and fears that she'll
never find true love if she marries first.  Ike, to no surprise, has
similar problems. Their commonalties and ongoing bickering eventually
evolves into attraction for one another.  This is the kind of story
where the audience knows what will happen way before Ike and Maggie do.
 Sure, there's a minor crisis here, and the revelation that accompanies
it, but the story is as predictable as the steps of the Macarena.</P>
<P>I guess that I so moved by Pretty Woman because it was a movie that was
so 
Cinderella-esque.  How could anything like that happen in real life? 
It was implausible, but I loved it.  And to that point, I also have
greater praise for Robert's earlier summer release, Notting Hill for
that same reason.  This movie fails to generate the magic and warmth
that it promised to be.  Yes, Roberts and Gere have good chemistry, and
they are both good to look at.  But without their star power, the
studio moguls when deciding to make this picture probably wouldn't have
said ‘I do.'</P>
