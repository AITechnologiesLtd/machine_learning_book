<PRE>In Love with `Shakespeare'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>Romeo, oh Romeo...wherefore art thou, Romeo?  Oddly, he might have
been shipwrecked on some deserted island and the butt of a hundred
jokes unless the struggling but well-respected literary mind of
William Shakespeare (Joeseph Fiennes) can somehow overcome a bout of
writer's block.  But as it stands, nothing is igniting his creative
flame for prose and his newest play is a half-baked comedy currently
entitled `Romeo and Ethel - A Pirate's Daughter.'  Alas, what's a
playwright to do?</P>
<P>`Shakespeare in Love' is an immensely satisfying story that follows
the distraught Bard through his period of uncertainty, discovery and
glory.  His spark is provided by the lovely Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a
charming and radiant woman who has a passion for plays and a fondness
for works previously written by Shakespeare.  There love for one
another is intense, passionate, and romantic in every sense of the
word.  Her presence and strength allows him to begin retooling his
comedy into what will eventually become `Romeo and Juliet.'  But his
goal of creating his greatest work to date is fraught with setbacks. 
Competition wants to derail his troupe of actors; Viola has already
been pre-arranged to marry a jealous suitor; and other factors develop
that threatens Shakespeare's work.  But through it all, he tries to
remain focused on his task at hand.  But creating timeless work
requires some help.   Rich supporting performances come from the likes
of Judi Dench as the sardonic Queen Elizabeth; Geoffrey Rush as the
investor who prays that the play will make money; and Ben Affleck as a
glory-seeking actor that is relegated to only a small role.  Each
added tremendously to the wit and dimension of this film.</P>
<P>I remember when I learned about Shakespeare in middle school, and it
was like learning a second language.  To this date the meaning of his
words still alludes me.   You can expect to find much of that
Elizabethan tongue present here in this movie, but the dialogue is so
rich and vivid that you can not help but awe at how romantic that
period must have been.  Paltrow and Fiennes are absolutely radiant and
have terrific chemistry together in their Oscar-calibrer performances.
 The story is marvelously contructed and strikes a rewarding balance
of pathos and romance as it presents a terrific story of love that
crosses the barriers of wealth, class and titles.  Doses of great
comedy trickle through the story, but the romance aspect and the
intrigue that accompanies it is satisfyingly unexpected and undeniably
sweet.  After I walked out of the theatre, I really wished that I had
payed closer attention to my Shakespearean lessons.  You won't find
many films that are better than this one this year.</P>
