<PRE>Vampires
Rated R (for extreme violence and language)
Review by Fox Davidson</PRE>
<P>  Wow, the vampires in Vampires are some slick cats!  Not only do that dress
like they just got sucked by one of their mates during a fashion show, but they
can leap great lengths and rip apart a man's abdomen with one hand, in graphic,
gory manner.  Well, I guess if a man's chest is ripped open, it would be
bloody, but, showing it so gratuitously is so unlike John Carpenter.</P>
<P>  That is one of the problems with his new film, Vampires, based on the novel
Vampire$ by, um, some guy.  The new bite-and-suck film is so violent, it takes
away from the stylishness that Carpenter puts on the accent of the film.  </P>
<P>  James Woods stars as Jack Crow, a vampire slayer.  His buddy (played by
Daniel Baldwin) is a sleaze who takes the likings to a hooker who is bitten by
the master (Thomas Ian Griffith).  That hooker is played by Sheryl Lee, and she
is pretty unnecessary throughout the rest of the movie.  She's just there for
some nude scenes, another spot that is unlike Carpenter.</P>
<P>  Vampires is easy on cheap thrills and gore, but, tough on plot and
sensibility.  Too bad.  This could have been a great film.  Halloween is
probably the best horror film around.  I can't believe it is directed by the
same guy!</P>
<P>  Carpenter has made some good film in the `90s.  In The Mouth of Madness was a
scary, intelligent film that was as thought provoking as mind boggling.  </P>
<P>  The DVD of Vampires is very good.  The trailer is awesome (music supplied by
Marilyn Manson) and the sound is dynamic!  Add this to your collection, but,
only for the sound and spectacular picture quality.</P>
