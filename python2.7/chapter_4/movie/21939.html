<P>The Bone Collector  Dir: Phillip Noyce. Starring Denzel Washington, Angelina
Jolie, Queen Latifah, Ed Oâ€™Neill and Michael Rooker.</P>
<P>The pitch: A quadriplegic NYC homicide detective helps his protÃ©gÃ© track
down a brilliant serial killer obsessed with true crime.</P>
<P>After a solid first hour of chilling suspense, this high-concept thriller
unravels completely in the final, disappointing reel. The killerâ€™s identity
may come out of the blue, but the rationale for the killings is so
preposterous, so dependent on nearly impossible coincidences, that we just
donâ€™t believe it.
Washington plays the immobilized detective who feels suicidal four years
after a freak accident left him paralyzed below the neck, save for just
enough movement in his left index finger to allow manipulation of a computer
trackball. His computer, television monitor and telephone are all voice
activated, which is crucial to the climax. Before the accident, Washingtonâ€™s
character was a renowned detective specializing in analysis of forensic
evidence. Confined to a motorized bed, forced to gulp oxygen from a straw
strapped to his headrest, now he only wants to die. The role is daunting â€`
Washington is limited to facial expressions and changes in the tone of his
voice. His nurse, the motherly Latifah, refuses to give up on her patient,
even though he wants â€œto check out of this life.â€?
Jolie is a novice cop who comes upon a grisly crime scene: a
multimillionaire developer buried under tons of gravel near a railroad line.
Only his hands are exposed, fingers frozen with rigor mortis as though
clutching at the air. The dead manâ€™s wife is still missing, a captive of a
serial killer who leaves maddeningly obscure clues as to his whereabouts and
motives.
Washingtonâ€™s friend and fellow detective, Oâ€™Neill, assigns Jolie to the
case, which is a helluva promotion for a street cop. But Oâ€™Neill has his
reasons. Jolie can be Washingtonâ€™s surrogate at the crime scene. And he can
communicate with her via two-way radio as they try to catch the killer. It
gives Washington a reason to live.
The killerâ€™s methods are markedly gruesome. Some victims are flayed to the
bone. One is boiled alive by steam jetting from an exhaust pipe (even in
shadow, these scenes are grisly and graphic). With Washingtonâ€™s deductive
skills, Jolie is able to draw closer to the psychopath, despite the
interference of a territorial police captain (Rooker) â€` one of those
needlessly stupid characters whose purpose is to get in the way of the
heroes just so they can prove him wrong, again and again. Rooker and the
film deserve better than this old screenwriterâ€™s crutch.
Then again, so does the climax, which hinges on a ridiculous number of
circumstances coming together with precision timing. Not in New York City,
baby. The movie backs itself into a corner, since a confrontation between
the immobile Washington and the killer is inevitable. But how to show these
two in a battle of wits, a fight to the death, without stretching
plausibility to the breaking point? Itâ€™s a question the filmmakers should
have answered before shooting the picture and tacking on a coda that even
Frank Capra would have found corny.</P>
<P>Rated R for violence, gruesome murders and language.</P>
