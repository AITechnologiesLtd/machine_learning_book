<P>After bloody clashes and independence won, Lumumba refused to pander to 
the Belgians, who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship 
with the Congo.  Their officers, particularly General Janssens (Rudi Delhem) 
in the Force Publique, the Congo's Army, caused rebellions, undermining 
Lumumba, who was outraged at the rape and murder of Belgian nationals.  With 
unrest building, Moise Tshombe (Pascal Nzonzi) and the province of Katanga, 
which contained 70 percent of the country's resources, proclaimed secession.  
Lumumba replaced Janssens, making Mobutu a colonel, and went on a pacification</P>
<P>tour with Congolese President Joseph Kasa Vubu (Maka Kotto), but it was too 
late.  'When you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies,' prophesies
Lumumba of his own fate.</P>
<P>Peck and Bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a
myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly
regarding Lumumba's private life.  Peck's script illuminates Bantu sayings 
like 'The hand that gives, rules' when Lumumba uses it with the American 
ambassador.  Peck's direction is less assured, with many scenes unfortunately 
playing like standard television fare.  He's served well, though, by his 
casting of Ebouaney in the title role.  Ebouaney is dynamic, radiating his 
character's fierce passion for his people and his country.  Lumumba's 
intelligence and ability to strategize, even as he's cornered by 
insurmountable odds, are given life by Ebouaney.  Peck's subject and lead 
actor elevate his film above its mediocre production.</P>
<P>"Lumumba" is a story that deserves to be told and Ebouaney's performance
makes the tragedy personally felt.</P>
