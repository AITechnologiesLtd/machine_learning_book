<PRE>THE GENERAL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"Robin Hood is it, you scumbag?" Inspector Ned Kenny asks sarcastically
of his prisoner, Martin Cahill, a real-life Irish criminal known by the
sobriquet of "the General."  The General was a modern day folk hero to
Dubliners in the 1980s and early 1990s.  He robbed from the rich, and,
although he didn't give to the poor, he did improve the economic status
of his own large family -- he had two live-in girlfriends, who were
sisters, and had children by both.</P>
<P>THE GENERAL's writer and director John Boorman, Oscar nominee for
DELIVERANCE, creates an astonishing and captivating portrait of an
iconoclastic criminal.  Brendan Gleeson from Braveheart gives a
marvelous and revealing performance as the General.</P>
<P>With thin, stringy hair, a ruddy complexion and a belly that looks like
it never met a pub it didn't love, the General doesn't look like
anybody's idea of a hero.  Fond of wearing self-mocking T-shirts
embossed with pigs and self-effacing slogans, he doesn't appear to take
his fame seriously.  With his girth, he's the least likely guy to sneak
around occupied houses as a cat burglar, but that's exactly what he does
until he eventually moves upscale, robbing expensive jewelry stores.
(One job alone causes 100 working-class stiffs to lose their jobs when
the, presumably uninsured, company goes under.  The morally-challenged
General expresses no remorse.)</P>
<P>The story opens with Martin's murder by the IRA and then cuts back to
the beginning of his life of crime.  Eamonn Owens from THE BUTCHER BOY
has the small part of Martin as a child.</P>
<P>Gleeson's mannerisms for Martin capture perfectly the character's futile
attempts to hide his identity.  Using his meaty hands, Martin spends
most of his time outdoors trying to cover his face, even though his
easily recognizable physique belies this crude cover-up.  Even during
interrogations, he hides his face, letting only his eyes peak out.</P>
<P>Looking like a country bumpkin, Martin, a criminal mastermind,
constantly surprises with intelligent and ingenious ideas for his
larcenous schemes.  When the police finally bring him to trial, his
shenanigans to disrupt and destroy the trial are both simple and clever.
He is the type of crook who is always several steps ahead of the law
with a specialty for devising foolproof alibis.</P>
<P>The supporting cast, including Adrian Dunbar as Martin's right-hand man,
Noel Curley, and Jon Voight as Inspector Kenny, are all well chosen, but
the movie excels on the strength of Boorman's crisp direction and the
complex and likable acting by Gleeson.  That the General was a rogue is
never left to question, but the movie makes it easy to understand how
such people can, nevertheless, earn the public's adulation.  With
several police officers following him in full view wherever he went, the
General still managed to earn a handsome living by stealing other
people's treasures.</P>
<P>Understanding what the director was trying to accomplish can perhaps
best be seen in the medium of the presentation.  Boorman chose to shoot
the movie in black and white.  Why?  Because, according to the press
kit, he felt that color prettifies and romanticizes.  He wanted none of
that.  The result is a fascinating and revealing portrait of a real and
complex character, one whom you'll love even though you know you
shouldn't.  And in the process you get a better appreciation for what
makes people admire the unadmirable.</P>
<P>THE GENERAL runs 2:09.  It is rated R for some violence and profanity
and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
