<PRE>HOMEGROWN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Billy Bob Thornton has shown his dexterity in roles as widely
diverse as the James Carville clone in PRIMARY COLORS and the deadly
simpleton in SLING BLADE.  In HOMEGROWN he gets a part that seems
tailor-made for him.  Playing a Northern California pot farmer named
Jack, he looks so convincing that you can almost smell the weed on his
well-worn jeans.</P>
<P>     Director Stephen Gyllenhaal, who co-authored the script with
Nickolas Kazan, says in the press kit that he did not envision the
story as "a head movie or a toker's paradise." He was inspired by
Westerns, and he sees HOMEGROWN as "sort of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA
MADRE on a marijuana plantation."</P>
<P>     Shot on a pittance but filled with name stars who worked for next
to nothing, the movie is a small treat at times but too often wanders
as aimlessly as Jack's two stoned helpers, Carter (Hank Azaria) and
Harlan (Ryan Phillippe).</P>
<P>     As the story begins, the three men are guarding their freshly
ripened cash crop while awaiting the arrival of their boss, Malcolm,
played in a cameo role by John Lithgow.  Malcolm is killed on arrival
by his helicopter pilot, who then quickly disappears.  The three
farmers and their mutual girlfriend Lucy -- pot farmers are a friendly
lot -- are left to harvest and sell Malcolm's multi-million-dollar
crop.  Lucy is played by Kelly Lynch, last seen in the disastrous MR.
MAGOO.</P>
<P>     Although the story has promise and some good acting, the first two
acts serve mainly to mark time until the picture comes alive with some
much needed twists and turns in the last act.  The director has trouble
keeping much momentum going until a group of "rippers," dressed as
cops, descend on Malcolm's field to steal the plants.  Soon guns are
blazing, and the picture takes off.</P>
<P>     In addition to Billy Bob's acting talents, the picture has other
little delights.  Jamie Lee Curtis, for example, plays a self-righteous
belle at a flag-draped pot growers' ball.  She lectures the marijuana
farmers on the virtues of the area's original pot growers, "who had a
sense of mission." Looking like a flower child from the 60s, she
prances around the dance while bragging that she is now carrying number
three in her tummy.</P>
<P>     "It's complicated," Lucy says of her affair with one of her many
gentlemen friends.  "Sometimes complications are interesting." With its
underdeveloped script, a few more complications would have helped
HOMEGROWN enormously.  But any movie with Billy Bob does have its
rewards.</P>
<P>     HOMEGROWN runs 1:35.  It is rated R for profanity, sex, violence,
nudity and, what else, lots of dope smoking.  It would be fine only for
quite mature and older teenagers.</P>
