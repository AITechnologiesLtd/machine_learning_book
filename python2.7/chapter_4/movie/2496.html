                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Barry Levinson had an idea, and a pretty good one at that:  take
an actor, have him assume the role of a vigilante and, as public
adulation of his assumed personae escalates, blur the line between
being a vigilante and acting the part.  Unfortunately, the idea is all
that Mr. Levinson had, because the final result--JIMMY HOLLYWOOD--is
a somnolent mess.</P>
<P>     Jimmy Alto (Joe Pesci) moved to Hollywood from New Jersey to try
his luck in Tinseltown.  Now, despite a bus stop bench add proclaiming
his abilities as an actor, he's unemployed and barely eking out a
living, resorting to stealing from his girlfriend Lorraine (Victoria
Abril) when he needs money.  Then, one night someone breaks into
Jimmy's car and steals his radio.  Incensed that the police intend to
do nothing about this criminal behavior, he and his friend William
(Christian Slater) spend nights staking out the neighborhood, awaiting
the return of the thief.  When he makes another appearance, Jimmy takes
matters into his own hands, giving birth to the S.O.S. ("Save Our
Streets") organization and its leader, Jericho.</P>
<P>     The problems in JIMMY HOLLYWOOD start with the characters.  They
either aren't very interesting (Pesci's Jimmy), aren't interesting and
are annoying (Slater's William), or aren't interesting and don't have a
purpose (Abril's Lorraine).  The fault is not entirely that of the
script, since none of the principals gives a noteworthy performance.
Mr. Pesci, known for his caged energy, comes across as bland
throughout.  Mr. Slater and Ms. Abril successfully manage to blend
into the scenery.</P>
<P>     For a comedy, this isn't very funny.  There are a few lines here
and there worthy of a chuckle, but most of the jokes fall through, and
some are difficult to recognize as attempts at humor.  The dramatic
elements aren't much more successful, although several intriguing ideas
are proposed--such as the role of vigilantism in our society and what
a media frenzy can drive a person to do.  None of these are original,
but they're worthy of consideration.  Unfortunately, JIMMY HOLLYWOOD
doesn't do that very well, either.</P>
<P>     The film's tone is uneven, with lengthy periods of sluggishness
punctuated by bursts of action.  The ending is dragged out at least
twice as long as it needs to be.</P>
<P>     The best part of JIMMY HOLLYWOOD, and it is very good, is the
sequence over which the end credits are shown.  This minute-long spoof,
featuring an unexpected, uncredited cameo, is almost worth sitting
through the rest of the film for.  Almost, that is, but not quite.  The
other interest- capturing moments are few, far between, and quickly
over.</P>
<P>     Barry Levinson's work in the past has ranged from excellent
(AVALON) to mediocre (BUGSY) to awful (TOYS).  JIMMY HOLLYWOOD falls
far closer to being in the latter category than either of the former
ones.  In this case, let the preview be your guide to the movie--it's
an accurate representation of something that's flat, uninspired, and
desperately trying--and failing--to be witty and clever.</P>
