<PRE>Shaft </PRE>
<P>Samuel L. Jackson stars in this updated version of the classic early-70s 
blaxploitation action/crime movie.
And since it's the 21st century you can just imagine what level the intensity 
is going to be - a lot of violence
and a lot of attitude. </P>
<P>The story is very intricate and involves Shaft's pursuit of a rich, racist 
murderer who can evade justice and
his partnership with a drug dealer to track down the sole eye witness who 
could convict him. In between
Shaft spends a lot of time trying to work within the system to bring all the 
bad guys down but eventually
becomes an all-out mercenary in his pursuit for justice. </P>
<P>The action is vital to the story, and pretty much is the story at some 
points. It's not surprising the
screenplay and editing seem so disjointed according to all the stories of 
production problems on the set of
this thing. Still, it's got a little bit of everything for everyone. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: B </PRE>
