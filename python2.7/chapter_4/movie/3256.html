<PRE>                            MURDER IN THE FIRST
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Kevin Bacon, Christian Slater, Gary Oldman.
Screenplay:  Dan Gordon.
Director:  Marc Rocco.</PRE>
<P>     Honestly, if I never see another courtroom scene in a movie, it
will be too soon.  As soon as I see a witness stand, a couple of
guys in suits, and twelve good persons and true, I know I'm in for
nothing less than a good old-fashioned lecture.  It's Jello drama:
ready instantly, but usually without much texture.  MURDER IN THE
FIRST has an inherently interesting story at its core, but its
makers don't know what to do with it except dress it up in cliches
and impress us with cinematographic gymnastics.  It's not a bad
film; it's just lazy, a classic example of a writer and director
failing to make the most of an idea's potential.</P>
<P>     MURDER IN THE FIRST is loosely based on the true story of Henri
Young (Kevin Bacon) a petty criminal sentenced to the Federal prison
at Alcatraz in the 1930s for stealing $5 from a post office.  After
a failed escape attempt, Henri is placed in solitary confinement for
over three years, routinely beaten and tortured by the prison's
associate warden Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman).  When he is finally
released from solitary, Henri attacks and kills the inmate who blew
the whistle on the escape attempt.  His case is assigned to rookie
public defender James Stamphill (Christian Slater) because everyone
believes that it's an open and shut case that no one could screw up.
But Stamphill decides that Henri does have a defense:  that the
brutality Henri suffered in Alcatraz turned him into a killer that
he wasn't when he entered.</P>
<P>     MURDER IN THE FIRST opens with a risky but effective sequence
which shows Henri's treatment while in the "dungeon."  The sequence
goes on for several minutes, but it is necessary considering how
much Henri's state of mind comes into play.  In fact, director Marc
Rocco doesn't really go far enough.  The torture sequences are too
romanticized, filmed in slow-motion and backlit like an S&M version
of FLASHDANCE, when it would have been more appropriate to play the
scenes straight so that Henri's plight seemed more real.  It is a
lack of restraint typical of Rocco's direction, which looks like he
put cinematographer Fred Murphy in a gyroscope and just set him
spinning.  You get the impression that Rocco thinks this story is
basically about crane shots and funky angles.</P>
<P>     What it should have been about, first and foremost, is the
relationship between Henri and Stamphill, but again Rocco and
screenwriter Dan Gordon don't take advantage of opportunities.  As
the film goes on, we learn about several things the two men have in
common, particularly that both lost their parents at a young age,
but these similarities aren't exploited.  Instead, Rocco just
indulges his camera, doing so to distraction during the first
meeting between Henri and Stamphill where the camear swings around
Henri's cell so noticeably that the actors get lost in the scene.
It's too much a case of the tail wagging the dog, such that by the
end of MURDER IN THE FIRST I didn't feel the friendship between
these two men which should have created its greatest emotional
impact.</P>
<P>     That said, the scenes between Bacon and Slater are the best
thing about MURDER IN THE FIRST.  Though Bacon's performance is
occasionally indulgent, coming off like Renfield with a Midwestern
twang, he is mostly extremely affecting.  It is by far the meatiest
role he has had, and he is effective at maintaining the shred of
humanity behind Henri's glassy stare.  Slater stays right with him
in the less showy role, very much the young go-getter in his early
scenes who only gradually comes to know the person at the heart of
his case.  One scene in particular, in which Slater compares the
punishment he received for stealing five dollars to Henri's, is a
great piece of work because Rocco lets the inherent power of the
moment work.  But then, inevitably, he must return to the courtroom,
and there things become trite and overblown again.  Gary Oldman
turns in another foaming-at-the-mouth performance as the sadistic
(gee, there's a surprise) warden, while R. Lee Ermey as the judge is
so similar to his role as the drill sergeant in FULL METAL JACKET I
thought he was going to call Slater "Private Pyle."  MURDER IN THE
FIRST, which should have been most about a connection between two
very different men, instead becomes a shouting match, and by trying
to make his film Important with a capital "I," Marc Rocco instead
makes it Mediocre with a capital "M."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 days in the Hole:  5.</PRE>
