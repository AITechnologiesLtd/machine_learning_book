                               SUBURBIA
                     A film review by Andrew Hicks
                      Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1997) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        If SUBURBIA leaves no other legacy to American cinema, it 
will be known as the movie where you can see Cory from "My Two 
Dads" fully naked. Yes, TV's "Cory," Giovanni Ribisi and six other 
young talents bring Eric Bogosian's play to life in this Richard 
Linklater film. In SUBURBIA, Linklater successfully combines 
elements of his earlier three films -- the aimlessness of SLACKER, the 
fun of DAZED AND CONFUSED and the thoughtful dialogue of 
BEFORE SUNRISE.</P>
<P>        Ribisi is Jeff, the leader of a group of losers whose days 
consist of unemployment or low-paying jobs and whose nights are 
dominated by drinking beer and loitering in convenience store parking 
lots. There's a whole roster of Generation X angst here, most of them 
with stupid names. Sooze (Amie Carey) is Jeff's girlfriend, a 
performance artist who delivers an anti-testosterone manifesto called 
"Burger, Part I" at the beginning.</P>
<P>        Her friend Bee-Bee (Dina Spybey) is a recovering alcoholic 
and Tim (Nicky Katt) is a discharged Air Force officer on his way to 
becoming one. Then there's Buff (Steve Zahn), whose intellect is 
anything but. He's the token clown of the group, the kind of guy who 
will say or do anything crazy for a laugh. The fact that he's either 
drunk, stoned or both most of the time feeds the lack of inhibition.</P>
<P>        As the group of friends stands outside the convenience store, 
we meet another of SUBURBIA's central characters, Naseer (Ajay 
Naidu). He's the Pakistani night clerk of the c-store, who in the 
beginning is made out to be the Mr. Roper or Gale Gordon-type foil to 
the kids, the guy who will come out and chase them away whenever 
they start to act immature. As the movie goes on, we realize Naseer is 
the voice of responsibility and far closer to the American ideal than 
these five white kids who were born here.</P>
<P>        The movie would be almost plotless without the arrival of 
Pony (Jayce Bartok), the one friend in the bunch who has done 
anything with his life. He's on his way to becoming a rock star (with 
more than 90,000 units sold already!) and incites various responses 
from the friends. Tim is jealous and pissed at the MTV 
commercialization of life, Sooze begins to lust after him and Jeff 
suddenly realizes he's accomplished nothing in life. Pony's sexy 
publicist (Parker Posey, who is now by act of Congress required to be 
in every low-budget indie opus) also incites various unprintable 
responses from Buff.</P>
<P>        SUBURBIA seems like the setup for a typical, party-all-night 
comedy about a bunch of teenagers. Linklater did it well once with 
DAZED AND CONFUSED, but digs deeper here. The Bogosian 
screenplay is dark and ultimately rather depressing, a lot like his 
cynical script for TALK RADIO. Anyone between the ages of 16 and 
30 will realize the characters depicted in SUBURBIA aren't far from 
the truth and neither are the problems they either address or try to 
ignore. I liked it.</P>
