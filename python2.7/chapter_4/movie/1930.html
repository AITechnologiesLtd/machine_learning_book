<P>     65 million years ago, when an asteroid crashed into the Earth and
obliterated the dinosaurs, a parallel dimension was created in which
dinosaurs evolved into the dominant creature.  Now, millennia later,
King Koopa (Dennis Hopper) of Dinohatten wants to fuse the two
dimensions together so that he can expand his domain (and increase the
food supply).  There are two elements necessary to his plan:  a small
chip of the asteroid broken off upon impact and Princess Daisy
(Samantha Mathis), who lives in the other dimension and,
coincidentally, wears the asteroid chip as a necklace.  Koopa sends his
incompetent cousins Iggy (Fisher Stevens) and Spike (Richard Edson)
through the bridge between worlds to capture Daisy, who is in the
process of falling for Luigi Mario (John Leguizamo), an apprentice
plumber.  When, after numerous mistakes, Iggy and Spike finally capture
her and take her back to their dimension, Luigi and his brother Mario
Mario (Bob Hoskins) go to her rescue.</P>
<P>     Describing the story of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is a difficult chore,
considering how little intelligible plot there is.  I suppose it's only
natural to expect this, considering the source material for the movie.
As we all know, arcade-style diversions are not known for strong,
original storylines or well-developed characters.  In that sense, this
film is worthy of its inspiration.</P>
<P>     The fun of playing the video game is that you're involved--you
control what the little figure on the screen does.  With the movie, on
the other hand, you're a bystander, sitting in a seat watching a bunch
of actors run around getting absolutely nothing done and speaking
dialogue that could have been written by a precocious five-year old.
Following an unnecessarily long opening sequence (which is actually the
best part of the movie), SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is ninety-odd minutes of
pointless action sequences which serve little purpose other than to
keep the motion picture faithful to the spirit of the game.  In doing
so, however, they commit the cardinal sin of boring the audience.  With
no genuine sense of danger, there's no excitement.</P>
<P>     Some interesting casting choices were made.  Bob Hoskins, who
suddenly appears willing to lend his respected name to ventures of
dubious quality, gives a solid-if-unspectacular performance as the
older of the Mario brothers.  John Leguizamo, on the other hand, is not
good; earnestness doesn't compensate for lack of ability.  Samantha
Mathis, who has shown her skill in films such as PUMP UP THE VOLUME and
THIS IS MY LIFE, plays an appealing, if somewhat gawky, college-aged
princess.  Dennis Hopper is disappointing.  His role as King Koopa
cries out for an over-the-top performance but, for some inexplicable
reason, Hopper plays him straight, creating a dull and uncharismatic
villain.  This guy is so boring that we find it difficult to root
against him--that is, when we can unravel enough of the murky plot to
figure out why we're not supposed to like him.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, the visual effects are nice, but it's a poor movie
these days that can't have that said about it.  There isn't anything
new or revolutionary here.  Back in 1979, STAR TREK:  THE MOTION
PICTURE proved that special effects alone, no matter how impressive,
cannot sustain the interest of an audience.  What was true then remains
so today.  SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is all glitz and no substance, and
makes for a pretty poor time at the movies.  If you crave excitement
and action, see CLIFFHANGER.</P>
<P>     Kids will probably love this film but, to be frank, most children
aren't that discriminating (apologies to the few who are).  There's
nothing in the film that's reprehensible (although some may find the
concept of a one-hundred-five-minute commercial for a game offensive
in itself), but I find it hard to believe that many adults accompanying
their youngsters will be entertained.</P>
<P>     In general, about the best recommendation I can come up with
regarding this movie is to turn on the Nintendo and play a game
yourself.  You'll have more fun, spend less money, and it will be over
a whole lot faster.</P>
