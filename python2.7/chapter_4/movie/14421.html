<P>     Since time immemorial -- Memorial Day 1996, to be precise -- one
question has plagued movie-goers the world over:  what might MISSION:
IMPOSSIBLE have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in
telling a coherent story?  As answer, I give you RONIN, an international
espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline.  The
comparison to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is almost too easy, especially given the
presence of Jean Reno in both casts, but it's a telling comparison
nonetheless.  RONIN shows how much more effective a film can be when set
pieces are connected by ideas.</P>
<P>     The film opens in Paris, where a man known only as Sam (Robert
DeNiro) joins a multi-national band of mercenaries employed by Irish
nationalist Deirdre (Natascha McElhone).  Vincent (Jean Reno) is the
team's French location expert; Gregor (Stellan Skarsgaard) oversees
electronic surveillance; Spence (Sean Bean) is the weapons specialist;
Larry (Skipp Sudduth) serves as their driver.  Their mission is obtaining
a certain silver case by any means necessary, the contents unknown to the
operatives but obviously much in demand.  As the operation begins,
alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds, no lofty ideal more
important than the exigencies of the moment.</P>
<P>     That notion both drives the film and provides its title.  As
explained in too-literal (especially given a later, more subtle
explanation) on-screen titles, "ronin" is a term for masterless samurai in
feudal Japan, forced to survive as bandits or swords-for-hire without the
honor of serving a worthy lord.  Sam, Vincent and company, all of whom
once served as government agents or soldiers, are now down-sized Cold
Warriors without a patriotic purpose.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE flirted with
the same concept, but it was to turn characters into vengeance-driven
super-villains.  They function in RONIN as free agents, loyal only to
themselves, suspicious and treacherous because everyone around them could
be more suspicious or more treacherous.  The characters are sketched in
only the most basic terms, in keeping with their private natures, yet they
are given presence by actors like DeNiro and Reno bringing mournful weight
to their performances.  Though few words are spoken in the script by J. D.
Zeik and Richard Weisz (a.k.a. David Mamet), the very lack of human
interaction between the characters speaks volumes.</P>
<P>     For a fairly introspective film, RONIN is also a fairly exciting one.
Director John Frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too
often, but those he uses are tense and well-constructed.  The action level
is as high in RONIN as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last
few years, and it's _better_ action, more white-knuckle gripping than
whoop-it-up flashy.  For some viewers, that may be reason enough to spend
two hours at the movies, but it's all the more impressive because the
action serves the story.  Every subsequent violent encounter raises the
stakes in this chaotic world, while it's always clear that the combatants
neither know nor care what they're fighting for.</P>
<P>     RONIN certainly has its share of jagged edges, notably the
aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic sub-plot between
DeNiro and McElhone.  Some may find the characters too remote and
under-developed, and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally
in the story.  I found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what
Ineeded to become emotionally invested; the emptiness of their lives and
actions _is_ the hook.  This isn't earth-shaking profundity we're talking
about, merely the building blocks of effective drama -- the visceral
coupled with the intellectual, actions with consequences.  Consequences
were never really an issue in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, which makes it that
much easier to appreciate what RONIN has to offer.  It's no longer a James
Bond landscape of world domination.  For once, evil in an espionage
thriller isn't what people do, but why they do it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 masterless samurai:  8.</PRE>
