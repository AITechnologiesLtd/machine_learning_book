                       A film review by Chad Polenz
                        Copyright 1997 Chad Polenz</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1994, PG-13, 110 minutes [1 hour, 50 minutes]
[comedy]
starring: Jim Carrey (Lloyd Christmas), Jeff Daniels (Harry Dunn) Lauren
Holly (Mary Swanson), produced by Charles B. Wessler, Brad Krevoy, Steve
Stabler, written by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, Bennett Yellin, directed by
Peter Farrelly.</P>
<P>I've seen some pretty funny movies, but "Dumb And Dumber" is one of the
funniest I've seen in a long time. This is not your typical comedy, it's
almost like a live action cartoon, but it's funny because it's so off the
wall and it works. </P>
<P>Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are perfectly cast as Lloyd Christmas and Harry
Dunn, a pair of bumbling idiots who struggle to survive and are oblivious to
the world around them. Lloyd is a limo driver who falls in love when he
drives the sassy Mary Swanson (Holly) to the airport, and notices that she
left a briefcase in the terminal. </P>
<P>But since this is a commercial comedy there has to be a plotline of sorts,
which involves animal kidnappers to whom Mary was dropping off a ransom. Of
course Lloyd doesn't know this, and grabs the briefcase before the goons can
pick it up. One thing leads to another and eventually our heroes find
themselves being pursued across the country by two criminals, who they
constantly outwit and don't even know it.</P>
<P>The road trip has always been a staple storyline for comedies, which comes
into play here as the idiots travel from Providence, Rhode Island to Aspen,
Colorado. But the plot is really just a backdrop, the film is about these
crazy and hysterical jokes, such as Lloyd selling a dead parakeet to a blind
child, urinating in empty beer bottles (you can just guess where that joke is
going), and being so ridiculously stupid around normal people that it almost
becomes a sociological commentary.</P>
<P>It's difficult to convey the level of stupidity of this film. Usually
all-out idiocy like this doesn't work well, but these aren't recycled jokes,
they are unlike anything I've seen before. This film made me laugh right up
until the end.</P>
<P>Eventually the two make it to Aspen and open the briefcase, which contains a
cool million in cash, and you can just imagine what these guys will buy with
that much money. The balance between the plot and cause of jokes is handled
quite well because it doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and it
doesn't throw away the storylines that had been built up either.</P>
<P>"Dumb And Dumber" is not exactly the most intelligent comedy, but it isn't
bad at all. Just when we think these idiots couldn't be any stupider they
prove us wrong. Still, for all its idiocy I found myself laughing a lot, and
I don't usually find such lowbrow humor to be all that funny. I'll bet we're
all as stupid as Lloyd and Harry, we've just been conditioned by society not
to show it.</P>
