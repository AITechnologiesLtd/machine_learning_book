<PRE>                              LOVE AFFAIR (1939)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1995 Edwin Jahiel
(1939)
By Leo McCarey.</PRE>
<P>     One of Hollywood's best romances.  It created a memorable couple
(Charles Boyer, Irene Dunne) who perform superbly.  Character actress
Maria Ouspenskaya too has one of the top old lady roles ever filmed.</P>
<P>     A shipboard romance later turns into near catastrophe through
misunderstandings and an accident.  Humor and pathos mix, separate,
re-mix, in this smooth but un-slick, carefully crafted but not
artificial, moving but un-hokey gem, enhanced by the beautiful old
French song "Plaisir d'Amour."</P>
<P>     The same director remade his own film in 1957 as "An Affair to
Remember," with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr and a nice, sentimental
song. This version became recently popular again after it was "quoted"
in "Sleepless in Seattle."  It is fine but the earlier movie is
unbeatable. Then came the third edition, the 1994 "Love Affair" with
Warren Beatty and Annette Bening - a fiasco, which, if anything, makes
the original look even better, not that it needs any help.</P>
