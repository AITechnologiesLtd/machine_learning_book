A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Mike Nichols </PRE>
<P>Written by: Elaine May (screenplay), based on the novel by 'anonymous'
(former NEWSWEEK political commentator Joe Klein)</P>
<P>Starring: Adrian Lester, John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Maura Tierney,
Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
Presidential primary elections, Bill Clinton-type candidate,
Hillary-type wife, young idealist</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Is he or isn't he? That is the main question in this documentary-like
portrayal of a 1990s Presidential primary campaign. Is presidential
hopeful Jack Stanton essentially a decent man who must be ambiguous and
ruthless, and play hardball politics because the Presidential race
demands it, or is he an ambiguous and ruthless hardball politician who
is only playing at being a decent man in order to get votes? </P>
<P>This is the main substance of the movie PRIMARY COLORS, and the question
remains unresolved even at the end of the movie. As a vehicle for
getting the audience to ask the question, PRIMARY COLORS follows the
'coming of age' of Henry (Adrian Lester), a young black idealist who
joins the staff of Governor Stanton's presidential campaign. Henry is
similar to real life former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos. Other
campaign staff members in PRIMARY COLORS include strategist Richard
(Billy Bob Thornton), gay Libby (Kathy Bates), and media relations
expert Daisy (Maura Tierney). </P>
<P>At first Henry is enthralled and charmed by Stanton because he believes
he has at last found a decent politician. But as the campaign winds its
way through two sex scandals and mudslinging attacks by political
opponents, Henry learns that Stanton might in fact be a ruthless
pretender. So is he, or isn't he? Henry ponders.</P>
<P>John Travolta plays Presidential hopeful Governor Jack Stanton and Emma
Thompson plays the governor's wife Susan Stanton. They seem to look and
act exactly like Bill and Hillary Clinton (including Bill Clinton's
silvery hair, high pitched voice, and Southern accent). Because the
movie is based on a 1996 'Washington insider' book about Clinton, the
movie dramatizes events that parallel Clinton's first presidential
primary campaign. A large part of their campaign involves dodging a big
sex scandal involving a Gennifer Flowers-type hair salonist named
Cashmere McCleod. </P>
<P>Opinion:
The movie PRIMARY COLORS cannot be separated from the events of real
life. In WAG THE DOG the fictional American President was hit with a sex
scandal and responded by deflecting media attention to a bogus war with
Albania. In real life President Clinton was hit with allegations of
sexual misconduct, and media attention soon turned to an impending
showdown with Iraq. </P>
<P>Today, fresh from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, in which President
Clinton was criticized for deliberately obstructing people from knowing
about his sex life, President Clinton faces more sex allegations from
Kathleen Willey. Similarly, in PRIMARY COLORS, zipper-guy candidate
Stanton faces pressure from accusations that he had sex with a
hairdresser and impregnated a teen baby sitter. And just as the
fictional Stanton beats the scandals, it seems very odd, but Clinton's
approval ratings seem to rise after each new woman.</P>
<P>So what are we to make of PRIMARY COLORS, a movie which concentrates not
on policies or issues, but on whether or not we should trust the lying,
philandering Stanton to be a good President?</P>
<P>In my opinion PRIMARY COLORS is not particularly exciting, and it never
really answers its principle question. It is a well acted movie, and
does an excellent job of depicting complex and relevant people in thinly
disguised real life situations.</P>
