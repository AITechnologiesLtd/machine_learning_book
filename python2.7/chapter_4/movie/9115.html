                REVIEW: GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI (1996)
                by Chris Webb         copyright 1997</PRE>
<P>Cast: Alec Baldwin (Bobby De Laughter), Whoopi Goldberg (Myrlie Evers), 
James Woods (Byron De La Beckwith).
Directed by Rob Reiner</P>
<P>        "Ghosts of Mississippi" begins with a montage akin to very few 
other films.  It is a movie with a purpose: we want Oscars.  So, how to 
start a weak movie with high aspirations than to send up chilling images 
of the civil rights struggle in the United States with a gospel 
soundtrack.  Very chilling, indeed.</P>
<P>        Once you get to the meat of the movie though, it is hard not to 
notice the misguided storyline.  I credit Rob Reiner, who said that he 
would never attempt to approach the story through the eyes of a black 
person, since he cannot portray those emotions as a white man.  So, what 
we wind up with is a mildly entertaining, somewhat powerful, newsmagazine 
account of the trial lawyer who brings Medgar Evers' killer to justice 
after more than thirty years.</P>
<P>        Alec Baldwin portrays Bobby DeLaughter (fresh off his deep 
Southerner in "Heaven's Prisoners") who, as a white man, undertook the 
unpopular task of imprisoning Byron De la Beckwith (James Woods) after he 
went free from numerous mistrials.  We search for his reasoning to do 
this, since he is financially stable as a result of his father-in-law, a 
racist judge.  Is it for poilitical aspirations or because it is the 
decent and right thing to do?</P>
<P>        These are questions that Myrlie Evers (Whoopi Goldberg) seeks to 
have answered, as well.  She doesn't trust Bobby as much as she trusts 
any white man, since those are the people who have let Beckwith run free 
for so long.  Unfortunately, here is where Reiner loses the reins.</P>
<P>        If he cannot make a movie about the black experience, he could at 
least make Myrlie a more central figure.  Scenes between Goldberg and 
Baldwin are surprisingly intense, as we watch the progression from wariness 
to trust.  Instead, the movie chooses to focus on Bobby's home life and 
the fact that his wife is as much of a racist as her father.  She leaves 
him for a while, and Bobby makes a mistake while taking care of the kids 
alone.  Instead of telling him that racism is out-an-out wrongdoing, he 
skirts the issue.  This shows a fear to make a statement.</P>
<P>        Maybe, now, its true, as Beckwith states, that "[y]ou'll never 
get a jury in the state of Mississippi to convict a white man for 
killing" a black man.  Its because no white man, not even our heroes, can 
face up to the idea that racism is bad.  So, Woods prevails in the end, 
even though his character is convicted.  He remains the one memorable 
character in the movie, yet doesn't he always make his scenes great?  His 
nomination was well earned.</P>
<P>        I would have liked "Ghosts of Mississippi" to have been the 
Myrlie Evers story.  It would have been more compelling and hit home much 
harder.</P>
