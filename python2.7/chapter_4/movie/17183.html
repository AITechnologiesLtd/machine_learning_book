<P>Based on the Jacqelyn Mitchard novel, "The Deep End of the Ocean" has 
allegedly experienced a rocky road to the big screen, and it shows. 
Reshoots ensued several months after already wrapping, and although the 
press kit read that the film was 148 minutes, it actually was forty 
minutes shorter. Was that a mistake on the kit, when it should have said 
1:48, or was it really cut by nearly 3/4 of an hour? My guess would be 
the latter, since large chunks of the film seemed to be missing, and 
despite the exemplary performances from the whole cast, the editing is 
admittedly pretty shoddy.</P>
<P>The film begins in 1988 in Madison, Wisconsin, as joyful photographer 
and mother, Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer), leaves her husband, Pat 
(Treat Williams), to go to her high school reunion, bringing along her 
three children, 7-year-old Vincent (Cory Buck), 3-year-old Ben (Michael 
McElroy), and infant daughter, Kerry. While in the hotel lobby where the 
reunion is being held, Beth walks away from a brief moments to check in, 
telling Vincent to hold Ben's hand, but when she returns, Ben is nowhere 
to be found. Immediately thereafter, a highly-publicized search starts 
for Ben, headed by investigator Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), but to no 
avail, and Beth, cloaked in a smothering vail of grief and remorse, 
starts to nearly ignore her other kids, notably Vincent, leaving it up 
to Pat to take on the central parent role. Switching forward nine years, 
the Cappadora family has relocated in the suburbs of Chicago and Beth 
has finally been able to get her life back together. And then the 
unthinkable happens: one summer day, Beth is greeted at the door by 
12-year-old Sam (Ryan Merriman), who lives two blocks away and asks to 
mow her lawn for her. Put into a near frenzy of sudden joy and hope, 
Beth becomes convinced that "Sam" is actually Ben, and her belief is 
reassured when Det. Bliss informs her that the fingerprints match. The 
less said about the further developments in the storyline, the better, 
since there are a few surprises. </P>
<P>"The Deep End of the Ocean" is a rather frustrating drama because, on 
the one hand, it is a realistic and beautifully acted drama with several 
touching moments that come out of the screenplay, instead of taking the 
easy route and plucking at the heartstrings with maudlin melodrama. But 
then, coming away from the film, the flaws gradually began to shine 
through more clearly, not the least of being that nothing is really 
dealt with in a satisfactory manner as it seems to be constantly rushing 
to its conclusion which, by the way, feels tacked-on and unbelievable. </P>
<P>While some characters are given satisfactory screen time and are handled 
well (Pfeiffer, Jackson, Merriman), others remain underdeveloped and 
pushed to the side-lines (John Kapelos, as the man whom Ben thought was 
his father, Williams, and Alexa Vega, as Beth and Pat's youngest child, 
Kerry). Also, several occurrences in the story are treated by only a 
shot of something (for the last half of the film, Pat sleeps on the 
couch, signifying marriage problems), or are brought up and then 
immediately forgotten (the question of who Ben will celebrate 
Thanksgiving with).</P>
<P>As already noted, nothing negative could possibly be said about the fine 
performances. Michelle Pfieffer is always authentic in her wide range of 
emotions, as a mother who is devastated and blames herself for her son's 
disappearance. Treat Williams, a generally underused actor (although put 
to good, chilling use in the 1986 masterpiece, "Smooth Talk"), is 
satisfying as Pat, Beth's husband, even if he could have had more to do. 
And as for the children, the standout performance of the whole cast is 
Ryan Merriman, making his feature film debut, who is truly touching as 
the boy who finds himself torn between the man he has always thought was 
his father, and his biological parents. Merriman is never anything short 
of astounding, and is a new, refreshingly talented find. Jonathan 
Jackson, as the misunderstood and oft-times ignored 16-year-old Vincent, 
shows that he has a lot more going for him, after all, than the soap 
opera he is on, "General Hospital," and if this film is any indication, 
Jackson should get off that show while he still has a chance at a 
prosperous film career. Meanwhile, in a minor role, Whoopi Goldberg is 
effective as the caring Candy Bliss, and has one zinger of a line after 
announcing her name ("I know, it sounds like a Las Vegas stripper"). In 
one peculiar scene, however, Det. Bliss tells Beth, for no apparent 
reason, that she is a lesbian, but what exactly was the point, since 
nothing is made of this revelation after Candy brings it up?</P>
<P>"The Deep End of the Ocean" is a respectable family drama, but is all 
the more disappointing since it is obvious that it could have been so 
much more. There is no doubt in my mind that much of the film's problems 
is due to what ended up lying on the cutting room floor, and I wonder 
exactly why Columbia decided to cut it like they did. I was never bored 
by the film, and if about fifteen to thirty minutes had been added, many 
of my criticisms would probably have vanished, or at least lessened. The 
performances in "The Deep End of the Ocean" are so strong and assured 
that it's too bad the obviously truncated screenplay didn't hold up its 
half of the bargain. </P>
