<PRE>                                  JUNIOR
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule: High concept: Arnold Schwarzenegger is
          pregnant.  In-depth analysis: Arnold Schwarzenegger
          is pregnant.  This gives us a chance to see
          dramatized all the cliches about pregnancy, but
          with Arnold as the central figure.  This film might
          have been amusing as a five-minute comedy sketch.
          Unfortunately, it has another 104 unnecessary
          minutes.   Rating: -1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Ivan Reitman has a spotty background directing comedies.  Films
like MEATBALLS, TWINS, and GHOSTBUSTERS I and II have had good gags but
have been rather thin on story.  DAVE seemed to indicate Reitman was
starting to get a feel for plotting and characters.  It must have been
a fluke, however, since he is back to featherweight comedies with
under-developed characters in JUNIOR.  Once you know that the idea is
to show Schwarzenegger going though the same physical changes that
pregnant women go through, you can probably think of more amusing scene
possibilities than you will actually see in this film.</P>
<P>     Dr. Alexander Hesse is an incredibly well-built scientist with an
Austrian accent and an aversion to babies.  Ironically, he is working
on Expectane, a drug to improve the safety of pregnancies.  When the
FDA decides that the drug needs more testing, Hesse's fast-talking
partner Dr. Larry Arbogast (Danny DeVito), thinks that human testing
will be more convincing.  Arbogast talks Hesse into a surgical
implantation of an egg, but only for the first three months.  Meanwhile
the university has evicted the two scientists from their lab space and
has replaced them with Dr. Diana Reddin (Emma Thompson), a winning but
rather awkward scientist.  Her research unwittingly provides Hesse and
Arbogast with some of the materials they need for their experiment, and
the first male pregnancy is initiated.</P>
<P>     It must have seemed like a comic natural to have the super-
masculine Schwarzenegger in a role with cross-gender implications, but
it is a real mistake.  Gender-crossing films like TOOTSIE and
MRS. DOUBTFIRE have been big successes for other stars, but
Schwarzenegger simply does not project personality the way that a
Dustin Hoffman or a Robin Williams does.  And Reitman intentionally
tones down Schwarzenegger's personality so that later in the film he
can appear to be more "humanized" by the experience.  The problem is
that it takes all of Schwarzenegger's strength to project any
personality at all and later it is hard to work up much interest in the
character even in his unusual predicament.  In TOOTSIE, look how well-
defined a character Hoffman creates even before any of the cross-gender
material.  Besides, Schwarzenegger already bulges oddly and making him
pregnant almost seems redundant.  Actually part of the pleasure of such
a film would be to see how a man struggles with the fatigue of carrying
the additional weight.  This makes an Austrian body-builder perhaps
less appropriate than many other actors would have been.  It is not
clear why Danny DeVito is in this film since he is not at all credible
as a scientist and his comic potential is all but ignored.  It may well
be that the film is trying to play off Reitman's previous success in
TWINS.  Similarly, Frank Langella is around to play a shady university
executive in a story that didn't seem to need a villain.  But he was
good in DAVE so Reitman seems to want to use what has worked before.</P>
<P>     It was obviously assumed that the situation would be so funny that
the writing seems to have been done on autopilot.  This is a film
without any well-developed character in anything but the physical
sense.  It returns again and again to common scenes of pregnancy whose
only humor value is that you are seeing a man going through the
changes.  Once you have seen Arnold complaining that his nipples are
getting sensitive and crying at soap operas, is it still supposed to be
funny to see him eating pickles and ice cream, or is that really justa
variation on the same gag?  I picture writers Kevin Wade and Chris
Conrad just making a checklist of pregnancy cliches and writing a scene
for each.  Time and again opportunities for a funnier and more
believable script are passed up for cheap gags.  At this stage of
development the drug would not have been given a suggestive trade name
like "Expectane,"  it would be called something like "Themoxodil."  To
pick up the pacing, the film throws in slapstick humor, mostly built
around Thompson's clumsiness.  But the slapstick isn't funny and it
sabotages her effort to make her character believable.  Her body
language is the best thing about this film, but the slapstick is
misplaced and even she cannot make it work.</P>
<P>     This is a cookie-cutter formula comedy that drags on what might
have worked as a short skit far too long.  Rate it a -1 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
