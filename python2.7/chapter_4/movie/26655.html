<PRE>"You Can Count On Me"</PRE>
<P>Sammy and Terry Prescott (Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo) were orphaned as
kids when their mother and father were killed in a car accident. Since
then, the siblings have drifted apart. Sammy put down roots in the small,
upstate New York town of Scottsville with her young son Rudy (Rory Culkin).
Terry is a troubled wanderer who ekes out an existence and not much more.
When he abruptly leaves his pregnant girlfriend, he heads for Scottsville
and his sister to borrow some money. Terry's arrival disrupts Sammy's
quiet, stable life in tyro director Kenneth Lonergan's "You Can Count On
Me."</P>
<P>Terry's unexpected arrival in Scottsville coincides with Sammy getting a
new boss at the bank where she works. Brian Everett (Matthew Broderick) is
a martinet, of sorts, whose first actions are to restrict the colors his
employees use on their computer screens and put a halt to Sammy's work day
excursions to pick up Rudy at school and ferry him to his sitter's home.
Sammy protests Brian's decision to no avail. "You'll have to make other
arrangements," he says, or else. With no other option, the distraught
mother calls upon Terry to fill in for her with the daily pickup.</P>
<P>The temporary solution to the problem goes bad from the start when Terry
forgets to pick up Rudy at school one time and takes him to a bar to play
pool another. When Sammy finds out about the pool game from the town
sheriff and confronts Terry with the fact, he immediately blames innocent
Rudy for tattling on him. The relationship between Sammy and Terry begins
to change from that of sister and brother to one of scolding mother and
petulant, troublesome son. Terry and Rudy draw closer together, too, at
this time. As expected, by the end of the movie, everyone loves everyone
and a hopeful finale ensues.</P>
<P>While the brother/sister conflict boils, Sammy and Brian get into an
adversarial battle between the boss man's penchant for bureaucratic BS and
Sammy's desire to have the workplace be happy and cooperative. The fight
soon changes as Sammy and Brian get to know and like each other. His
unhappy marriage and her uncommitted situation drive the pair into each
other's arms and a romance begins. Of course, a boss/worker relationship is
destined to disaster and this one is no exception.</P>
<P>"You Can Count On Me" is straightforward story-telling about what happens
to a brother and sister as they grow older and apart. Laura Linney has not
had the opportunity to get the lead for a movie, until now, and holds up
her end of the bargain pretty well. Mark Ruffalo is OK as the brooding,
selfish, nomadic Terry and shows the most personal change by the film's
end. Unfortunately, Linney and Ruffalo look as much like siblings as Gore
and Bush look like brothers. This is a notable distraction. Matthew
Broderick is fine as the anal retentive bureaucratic boss. Rory Culkin is
nondescript as Sammy's little boy.</P>
<P>Kenneth Lonergan makes a sound debut effort, showing an ability to tell a
story while getting convincing performances out of the principle cast, if
not so the supporting players.
Tech credits, like the directing and writing, get the job done, though
nothing about the film knocks my socks off.</P>
<P>Hollywood doesn't usually make films about brothers and sisters and I can
understand why. Who would want to watch a story about me bickering with my
sister? I wouldn't.</P>
<PRE>I give "You Can Count On Me" a C+.</PRE>
