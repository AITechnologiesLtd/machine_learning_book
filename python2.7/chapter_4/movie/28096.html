<PRE>Have I lost my hipness?  Signs point to yes!</PRE>
<P>Wave Twisters, the brainchild of a foursome of turntable DJ's, is
practically a 45-minute animated music video wherein DJ QBert's spins
and samples are given Technicolor life.  There's a story of sorts inside
the movie -- though the dialogue is, as near as I can tell, all sampled
from TV commercials and old sitcoms.  For those who insist on playing
along, it's a sci-fi-ish tale a la Star Wars, wherein the animated Inner
Space Dental Commander must use his own brand of "force" (aka spinning
records) to wage battle against the villainous DJs (who play themselves
in live footage among the animation, Roger Rabbit style).</P>
<P>Full of pop culture references -- villains with Palm Pilots, Macs that
ask you about alcoholism, robots that need to be reset with a paperclip
-- Wave Twisters is reasonably fun; it's just not what I'd call great
cinema.  Rather, it's something that would probably play better
projected on the wall at a rave instead of in a dark and quiet movie
theater.  (No doubt, most people who see Wave Twisters will do so
standing up.)</P>
<P>Alas, I never got the "All your base are belong to us" payoff I was
hoping for in the movie, but I guess Wave Twisters was created a tad too
early for that craze.  But what do I know?  The film tied for best
"midnight film" at this year's SXSW film festival.  Here's to the hip
kids.</P>
