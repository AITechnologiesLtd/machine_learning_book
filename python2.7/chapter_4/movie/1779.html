<PRE>Comments on TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE,  SPOILERS!!!!</PRE>
<P>     When I think of the predicament of French cinema, I envision a
delicate Columbine doll labeled ART being torn apart by a mastiff
labeled THOUGHT AND REASON.  The tendency towards philosophical
abstraction has been the curse of French film since Renoir, culminating
in the soporific headiness of such master anaesthetists as Bresson and
Rohmer.  My own list of the 12 greatest films contains a single French
entry, Clement's FORBIDDEN GAMES (1951).  That film spoke movingly of
the horrifying effect of war on children; no philosophical meditations
crippled its direct and harrowing message.</P>
<P>     But in French film, such achievements are rare, and seem almost to
have to apologize for their presence.  There was a time when I thought
French film might be rescued from its philosophical diaspora.  I
welcomed Godard's BREATHLESS (1960), and even WEEKEND (1968), but that
director began to descend into bombast and politically trendy rant.
Once in a while a filmmaker such as Cocteau in LES ENFANTS TERRIBLE
(1950) would approach a robust subject, then scurry away in cant and
confusion, leaving an unwatchable film.  The promise of LA FEMME NIKITA
and DELICATESSEN remains to be fulfilled.   </P>
<P>     It is remarkable that French cineasts admire from afar a completely
different approach to filmmaking, the American film noir genre, with its
frenetic sense of doom and its headlong momentum.  I think randomly of
four fairly recent American films, THE GRIFTERS, KILL ME AGAIN,
SHATTERED, ONE FALSE MOVE.  None of these films is free from flaws, but
each grabs the viewer by the scruff of the neck neck at the beginning
and at the end propels him/her out of the theater wondering how 1 1/2
hours could have passed so quickly.  The momentum films in this genre
are capable of building is truly marvelous.  The  noir spirit of these
films is the antithesis of what the French filmmakers themselves usually
achieve.  French filmmakers are like the acnaed high school computer
whiz who fantasizes about the cheerleader he can never have.</P>
<P>     The recent film, TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE (All The Mornings of the
World) is, alas, in the reflective tradition.  The film  details the
relationship between the baroque composers Marin Marais (1656-1728) and
M.  de Sainte Colombe, played by Gerard Depardieu and Jean-Pierre
Marielle, respectively.  Marais is best known, perhaps,  for his
unearthly "Les Sonnerie de Sainte Genevieve du Mont-de-Paris" which is
often played on the classical music stations.  I am uncertain about the
historicity of Marielle's character.  He is certainly obscure, not even
being listed in my Slonimsky.   However, some recordings of his music
have begun to emerge.  In the film Marais is depicted as his protege,
but in reality Marais studied the viola da gamba with Hotterman, and
composition with Lully.  Their relationship is the usual protege
relationship enshrined in filmdom: melodramatic, filled with sullen
abrasiveness, temperament, posturing, and in this case with a seduced,
pining and ultimately suicidal daughter.  </P>
<P>     The film is langorous and atmospheric, and the interplay of the
haunting baroque music with the pastoral scenery is effective.  The
actors handle their duties adroitly, particularly  Marielle, and that
reliable fireplug of an actor, Depardieu.  French actors are, I think,
the best film actors.  Everything comes from the face, and everything is
nuance.  French actors and directors both have obviously studied the
great American film actors of the past.  It is interesting that Stephen
Frears, the director of LIASONS DANGEREUSE, cast that film with
American, rather than French, actors because "American actors are better
with their faces."  I don't think so.  More than once, during the films
JEAN DE LA FLORETTE and MANON OF THE SPRING I burst into spontaneous
applause at the intense subtlety of the performances, particularly those
of Daniel Auteuil and Yves Montand.    When I saw LA FEMME NIKITA, there
was a unified intake of breath from the audience during Jeanne Moreau's
bravura turn as the aging crone.  I could name many other equally
thrilling examples.  Marielle in the present film is so uncanny that one
could easily watch him read a telephone book, or Descartes' "Discourse
on Method," which is an asset, because in this movie that's about what
the viewer gets.</P>
<P>     Yes, unfortunately that age-old succubus of French film, THE IDEA,
is at work.  Seeing the device called  "faction"---  historical figures
in an imagined narrative---in the hands of a French director is ominous,
like a toddler playing with a handgun.  It means the characters can be
anything, in particular, puppets, from whose mouths can me made to issue
maxims, alternatively opaque and sophomoric.  The motivations and
consistency of character in the movie are really non-existent;  Marais'
dialog could be given to Sainte Colombe or vice versa with no
discernible effect.  The characters are pegs on which to hang a series
of ruminations about art and life.  The character of the young Marais,
played by Depardieu's real life son, makes no sense whatsoever.  He
weeps when upbraided by Sainte Colombe and denounces him as a cruel man,
yet, with no hesitation, walks out on his pregnant lover.  "Our bodies
are no longer right for each other."</P>
<P>     There is no historical evidence that Marais liked to dally
destructively.  In fact, he married at the age of 20 and had 19 devoted
children.  More faction, I suppose.</P>
<P>     The film culminates in a ultra-slow-motion Socratic dialog between
St. Colombe and his errant pupil Marais on the nature of art and life.</P>
<P>     "What is music for?"  St. Colombe asks, pensively.  The scene is
filmed in near darkness, the actor's faces fill the screen, an
encyclopedia of facial expressions is exhibited before each word of
dialog emerges.   </P>
<P>     To this question, Marais offers a languid series of abstruse
replies, each of which is countered by a severe "NO!" from St. Colombe.
Finally, the secret is revealed.</P>
<P>     "Music is for before we are born, before we breathe, before we see
the light."</P>
<P>     Watching this philosophical paint dry became excruciating,
unendurable.  I estimated my distance from the exit doors.  I found
myself conjuring up new muffin recipes.  I found myself thinking of
imaginative ways to re-wire my house and reappraising the promises of
that morning's junk mail.  I renewed my promise never to shout "FRENCH
CINEMA!" in a crowded fire station.</P>
