<P>If movies have taught us one thing over the last few years, it's that the
suburbs are a very dark, very screwed-up place.  L.I.E. confirms this
semi-revelation by taking the gritty subject matter of Kids and moving it
about 35 miles east to Dix Hills in Long Island's Suffolk County.  The title
refers to the Long Island Expressway in a not-so-subtle metaphor for the
fate of L.I.E.'s main character, who explains that some of the freeway's
lanes go straight to hell, having claimed the lives of such notables as
singer/songwriter Harry Chapin and director Alan J. Pakula, as well as his
own mother, who bought it on Exit 52.</P>
<P>His name is Howie Blitzer (Paul Franklin Dano) and he's a scrawny
15-year-old with braces and a talent for poetry.  Howie is a good kid who
has fallen in with a bad crowd, no doubt thanks to his mother's death and
his father Marty's (Bruce Altman, Girl Interrupted) refusal to get involved
in his son's life.  The two are clearly haunted by the death of their mother
and wife, with Marty turning to 80-hour workweeks and a live-in bimbo for
comfort, while Howie occasionally pulls a shoebox of his mother's bathroom
effects down from a shelf just so he can smell her perfume.</P>
<P>Part of the aforementioned "wrong crowd" includes Gary Terrio (Billy Kay,
The Guiding Light), a pierced, tattooed young man who gets Howie and two
others involved in a series of home break-ins that usually consist of
raiding the refrigerator (they're just bored, misguided kids, you see).
Gary, who holds somewhat of a sexual spell over Howie, is also a rent boy
who leads Howie to commit a basement burglary of a john upon whom he'd like
to exact a bit of revenge.</P>
<P>Howie knows nothing about Gary's extracurricular activities or that he's
being led into the den of one of the area's biggest pedophiles, "Big John"
Harrigan (Brian Cox, Rushmore), who hears the boys' attempt to rob him,
gives chase and manages to tear the pocket off of Howie's jeans.  The
ex-Marine (his license plate reads "BJ," which refers to both his nickname
and something he claims he can do better than anybody in the western
hemisphere) and pillar of the local community sniffs the pocket like an
animal, which is probably the most disturbing screen inhaling since Dennis
Hopper in Blue Velvet.  Like Velvet, it's a sign of bad things to come...or
so you might think.</P>
<P>A typical film about a child abuser would portray Big John as pure,
unadulterated evil, but here, he's kind and almost loving.  He listens to
Howie, which is something his own father never does.  The relationship
forged between Howie and the 60-something would-be monster is far from
predictable, and the film never judges any of its characters, whether they
diddle young boys or ignore their kids.  With an odd twist on that famous
scene from The Graduate, the film succeeds at getting the audience to
empathize with a pedophile, and for that, L.I.E. is somewhat groundbreaking.</P>
<P>L.I.E. is the debut of writer/director Michael Cuesta, who co-penned the
script with Stephen M. Ryder and Gerald Cuesta.  While the story sometimes
loses its way, the trio does a wonderful job at developing each of these
characters.  The film looks great, too, and is highlighted by a scene in
which Howie and Gary break into each other's homes and ransack each other's
rooms.</P>
<P>Those of you brave and lucky enough to see L.I.E. will be treated to Cox's
terrific performance that - and I can pretty safely guarantee this - nobody
will be talking about at the office water cooler.  No one would blame you
for being scared away by the film's content and its unfair NC-17 rating,
which was affixed by a clearly clueless MPAA.  L.I.E. contains absolutely no
nudity and only implied sexual content.  If anything, it's something parents
should want their kids to see, just so they can understand evil sometimes
comes in surprising disguises.</P>
<P>1:40 - NC-17 for language, graphic sexual dialogue and violence</P>
