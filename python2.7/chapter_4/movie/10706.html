<P>ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH (1996)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix</P>
<PRE>Rating: * (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Written and directed by Albert Pyun
Starring Christopher Lambert, Natasha Henstridge
Rated R (contains violence and profanity)  76 minutes</P>
<P>Synopsis:  A maniac, crazed by virulent microphage, slaughters more than
twenty people, including a street gang and heavily-armed troops, with a
small knife.  Even with a handgun, however, he can't take out the two cops
who are after him, despite having shot one of them a total of seven times.</P>
<P>Comments:  The most notable aspect of ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH is that it
marks a striking career move for Natasha Henstridge.  Not only does she
manage to keep all her clothes on (her trademark in earlier films such as
SPECIES and MAXIMUM RISK was to strip naked as often as possible), but she
actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses.  This will
probably disappoint many Henstridge fans, but I welcome the change because
Henstridge is an attractive, capable actress who deserves less exploitative
roles (though, I admit, it doesn't show in this mess).  Henstridge, just
like every other actor in the film, delivers a wooden performance in this
monumental turkey.  (The cast also includes Christopher Lambert, who has
appeared in the HIGHLANDER and MORTAL KOMBAT films.)  How on Earth this
movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me.</P>
<P>ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH is set in Boston ten years in the future (2007).
Boston has changed dramatically in those ten years.  It is now home to a
bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small
cars with "policia" printed on their doors.  Some guy has a really bad
virus, and he's killing people because of it.  So, the brave good guys
(Lambert and Henstridge) go after him.  That's it.  76 minutes never seemed
so long.  This is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned
buildings turned into an entire movie.  The plot development is nil; we
learn absolutely nothing about Lambert's character and very little about
Henstridge's character.  The dialogue is littered with unnecessary
obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go
down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the
flashlight.</P>
<P>A subplot does exist involving Henstridge's character's illegal attempt to
get her son out of Boston.  In her opening monologue, a monologue which
sounds as though Henstridge was reading from cue cards, we learn that she
has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son.  Twenty
minutes into the film, I wondered if the movie would have been better if it
focused on this plot.  In a defining scene of the movie, however, I changed
my mind.  This fake passport drops to the ground.  Lambert's cop
immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away.  Must not have
been a good fake.  This emphasizes another fault with the film.  Things
just defy common sense.  Lambert's cop, for instance, is shot seven times,
yet he is still able to talk and slide about.</P>
<P>ADRENALIN: FEAR THE RUSH ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even
fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for.  I found myself rather
bored with this film, which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and
fans of Henstridge and Lambert.  Don't fear the rush.  Fear the movie.
Watch something else.</P>
