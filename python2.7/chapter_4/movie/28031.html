<P>ENEMY AT THE GATES
Written (with Alain Godard) and Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud</P>
<PRE>UA North     R      131 min</PRE>
<P>     World War II is back with a vengeance.  On May 25th Pearl Harbor 
will be bombed at a theater near you.  In August, Captain Corelli's 
Mandolin will strike up its tune.  And Santa Fe screens this week 
feature two takes on that war from a Russian perspective.</P>
<P>     Incomparably the better of the two is Elem Klimov's 1985 classic 
Come and See, one of the most harrowing war movies ever made.  Set in 
Byelorussia in 1943, it experiences the horrors of that war through the 
eyes of young Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) who joins the partisan 
resistance against the Nazi invasion.  The Germans conducted a scorched 
earth campaign in Byelorussia, destroying 638 villages and massacring 
their inhabitants.  "Inferior races carry the microbe of communism," 
sneers a German officer.  "Your nation has no right to exist." </P>
<P>     What begins as almost a game for Florya, searching on a beach for 
guns with a friend, evolves into horrors so great that the boy suffers a 
trauma-induced progeria, aging decades in a few months.  "I ended up 
filming a lightened-up version of the truth," Klimov has said.  "Had I 
included everything I knew, even I could not have watched it."  There 
are also scenes of lyrical beauty.  A remarkable montage at the end of 
newsreel footage run in reverse suggests that if we could only go back 
far enough maybe we could discover what went wrong and set it right.</P>
<P>     Jean-Jacques Annaud (Seven Years in Tibet) has reconstructed the 
battle of Stalingrad, winnowing it down to a couple of ace snipers (Jude 
Law for the Russians, Ed Harris for the Boche) duking it out as if their 
respective armies had agreed to let the war's outcome be decided by 
their duel.  Law plays Vassili, a sort of stepped-down Sgt. York, a 
country boy with a sharpshooter's eye.  He's built up, sports 
hero-style, by Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), the army political officer who 
writes pamphlets about him. Both of them fall in love with 
fellow-fighter Tanya (Rachel Weisz), and there is never a moment when we 
care about any of this. The production, with its ruined city and 
wall-to-wall dead bodies, is impressive, but Annaud lacks the breadth of 
visual language that made Spielberg's vision of Armageddon so 
devastating.  The characters and the story never engage the imagination. 
 Annaud shows a weakness for the truly bad scene which casts a pall of 
suspicion over his better moments. </P>
