<PRE>Payback (R) *
Starring Mel Gibson, Lucy Alexis Liu
Directed by Brian Helgeland
A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>There is only so much star power that you can handle. Several films base their
success on their main star, thinking that they will be a big draw whether or
not the film is any good. I think that this must have been what was on the
minds of the people who created Payback, a new Mel Gibson thriller that
doesn’t really thrill. The public seems to trust Mel when it comes to making
good action movies, after this I wonder if anyone will. What starts out as an
ultra-violent revenge movie ends as an ultra-violent revenge movie with not
much difference in between.</P>
<P>Porter (Gibson, who’s right for the role but can’t pull it off) was
betrayed by his partner and his wife when they all stole $135,000. They leave
him for dead in a parking lot. But Porter is alive and (depending on your point
of view) well, he plans to seek them out, retrieve his $70,000, and get some
good old fashioned revenge. But in order to find the guy, who know works for a
drug lord, he’ll have to kill a bunch of people and a bunch of people will
have to seriously hurt him and all of them do it as if their having fun.</P>
<P>Somehow, (I don’t really get this) they must plan the ultimate plan to get
away from the two corrupt cops that are following them and escape from an evil
guy (Kris Kristofferson) who’s son they kidnap. Will Mel Gibson die? Or will
he overcome the bad guys? Seriously, does anyone not know the answer to those
questions?</P>
<P>Payback is an example of what is wrong with out culture. The film is extremely
violent, but the thing that bothered me is that plenty of that violence
didn’t seem to be occurring for a reason. Another depressing factor of the
film was that everything was shot when it was really cloudy or with no light,
there isn’t one scene in the movie that has an lighting at all. Plus Lucy
Liu’s character, a hooker that’s into S&M isn’t interesting even though
there’s several moments where she could be. She’s basically the only woman
in this that kills a lot of people. I also see no reason why the female
characters were in this film at all because they didn’t bare their chests,
which in this type of movie, seems like the only important thing they could do.
The film played to me as kind of an old detective story, you can kind of sense
Gibson doing a Humphrey Bogart thing as he narrates a lot of the story. But
this film is way too much like Twilight, starring Paul Newman, to be any good.
Female Gibson fans will be treated to only a brief glimpse of his chest in the
shower, this is definitely a guy movie. So, if your looking to see a bunch of
people get killed, punched, have their feet hit with hammers and whips,
spanked, and shot, see Payback which gets * star.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Bloody and brutal violence and shooting accompany almost every
scene. S&M sex scenes, heavy smoking, and language also occur. Good Age 17 & Up</P>
