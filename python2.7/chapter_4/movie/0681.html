                              THE LITTLE MERMAID
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  Disney Studios is clearly trying to
     create a classic for multiple re-releases by repeating the
     formula of some of Disney's most successful animated
     features.  They probably have succeeded.  Rating: high +1.</P>
<P>     Walt Disney Studios built their reputation on animation, first with
Mickey Mouse cartoons and later with their full-length animated features.
Even among their feature-length animated films some seem to be more
respected than others.  The real classics are SNOW WHITE, SLEEPING BEAUTY,
and CINDERELLA.  The second-ranked ones are those such as PINOCCHIO, BAMBI,
and PETER PAN.  Then there are the third-ranked ones such as THE JUNGLE
BOOK, THE FOX AND THE HOUND, and THE SWORD IN THE STONE.  The ones best
regarded are adaptations of well-known German and French fairy tales.  They
each seem to pit a young woman representing the forces of innocence and good
against an older woman who represents decadence and evil.  Often the older
woman also represents the forces of witchcraft.</P>
<P>     THE LITTLE MERMAID represents a return not just to the classic
tradition but also to the classic formula.  Disney Studios is faced with the
competition of Don Bluth--who was bred in the Disney Studios and who left to
form his own competitive animation studios (much as Walter Lantz did
previously).  Intentionally or not, in the holiday season of 1989 we are
having the showdown between Disney and Bluth.  I have not seen Bluth's ALL
DOGS GO TO HEAVEN, but general scuttlebutt is that Disney's classic formula
has resulted in a much better film than Bluth's source.</P>
<P>     THE LITTLE MERMAID is the story--very loosely based on the Hans
Christian Andersen fairy-tale--of Ariel, a mermaid who is fascinated by the
huge ship hulls she sees floating overhead.  She also has a large collection
of half-understood human artifacts salvaged from shipwrecks.  Ariel's
fascination with humans is in direct defiance of her father, King Triton,
who wants Ariel to be happy, but entirely within the confines of his
undersea kingdom.  He has no interest in the "fish-eaters" who walk on two
legs.  Ariel is a minor departure from the heroines of previous Disney fairy
tales in that she is strong-willed and intentionally disobedient.  The film
gives her more character than Snow White or Sleeping Beauty.  Present to
tempt Ariel is this film's villainess, the sea-witch Ursula.  As Ariel is
half girl and half fish, so Ursula is an octopus with a corpulent woman
growing out of its head ... one of Disney's oddest-looking creatures.</P>
<P>     The songs are by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who did the music and
lyrics for the musical LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS.  Their style in both works is
more verse-dialogue spoken to music than the usual song poetry.  It is still
perfectly pleasant but it is immediately recognizable as being in the same
style.  What is a slight disappointment is that the artwork in THE LITTLE
MERMAID is noticeably less detailed than in other Disney classics.  (Each
frame of film IS different.  This is unlike Japanese animation which has
very nice artwork but fairly jerky motion with drawings used for three or
four frames each.)  But the sketches have less detail so were more
economical to draw.</P>
<P>     The result of all this is that in some ways THE LITTLE MERMAID is
reminiscent of the best of Disney, in some ways in seems the victim of
cost-cutting.  It represents an investment in the future by Disney and will
probably be released to theaters several times before it is ever sold on
cassette.  This means if it sounds good you should go to see it in a
theater.  That is the only way to see it.  As for rating, I would give THE
LITTLE MERMAID a high +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
