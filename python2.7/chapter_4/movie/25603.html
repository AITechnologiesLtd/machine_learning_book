<PRE>THE IN CROWD</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Mary Lambert
Written by: Mark Gibson, Philip Halprin</PRE>
<P>Adrien Williams (Lori Heuring) has just been released from a mental 
institution after her primary doctor, Henry Thompson (Daniel Hugh Kelly), 
recommended her release. She now has a job working at a country club until 
she gets back on her feet. At the club she meets a group of elite young 
snobs led by Brittany Foster (Susan Ward). Brittany soon takes Adrien under 
her wing for reasons we never fully understand. As Adrien becomes more and 
more immersed in Brittany's world she begins to suspect a conspiracy of 
sorts, dating back a few years, and involving Brittany's sister who left the 
country. Brittany's friend, Kelly (Laurie Fortier), keeps hinting about it 
to Adrien, as though it were eating her up inside. Once Brittany finds out 
that Adrien suspects her of something, she turns all her attentions to 
destroying Adrien's life, and she proves quite adept at doing so.</P>
<P>There's a whole lot more to this plot, mostly involving relationships 
amongst the other members of the in crowd. You know, the sort of soap opera 
like plot twists of so-and-so is seeing so-and-so behind her back, but she 
is actually cheating on him with blah blah blah. My head began to hurt after 
about fifteen minutes of trying to follow this, so I finally gave up and 
wrote "everyone is seeing everyone behind everyone's back". I think the 
primary reason it was so difficult to keep track was because all the members 
of the in crowd looked alike. All the guys were tall with brown hair and 
goofy looking expressions, and all the girls were well-endowed, blonde 
(except Brittany and Kelly; I think so we could keep track of them), and 
constantly clothed in bathing suits. That, by the way, about covers the 
film's good points. The only reason anyone should see this is to watch a 
bunch of beautiful people run around on the beach for over an hour and a 
half.</P>
<P>Because the actors are all interchangeable, there really isn't much point in 
covering their acting skills, but I'm going to give it a try anyway. Susan 
Ward (apparently from "All My Children", imagine that) and Lori Heuring 
("The Newton Boys") are the only two given a chance to display any acting 
skills, and both appear to possess none. Lori Heuring looks half dead 
throughout the film, which I suppose was intentional to show how disturbed 
her character was, but she might have overdone it just a smidge. Susan 
Ward's idea of acting evil seems to be: sitting off to the side, murmering 
false platitudes, conspiring against everyone, and keeping a small, fake 
smile on her face. Oh, I suppose that does sound fairly evil doesn't it? Yet 
somehow Susan Ward botches the attempt so badly, she looks comical rather 
than evil. The only other actor worth mentioning is Nathan Bexton (last seen 
talking to a cat in "Go"), who spends most of the film twitching violently 
in a corner or drinking alcohol by the gallon. Everyone else is either given 
no screen time (Daniel Hugh Kelly) or isn't required to act much beyond 
being a jerk (everyone else).</P>
<P>So how does the script itself fare? Well, you name the teen movie cliche and 
it's probably present. We get the classic mark of all modern teen movies: 
popular music playing all the time, even when it's completely inappropriate 
to the mood of the scene. We get every cliched bit of foreshadowing 
imaginable: from the characters being introduced at the exact spot where you 
know the final conflict is going to take place; to the emphasis on creaking 
stairs that you know are going to be important later on. It also follows 
that grand teen movie tradition of being a touch on the predictable side. By 
that, I mean half the time I could guess what characters were going to say 
before their mouths opened. Last, but not least, we have the two staples of 
all brainless teen films: a three minute exposition explaining the plot at 
the start; and an ending that everyone knew was bound to happen in exactly 
the way it occurs.</P>
<P>To be perfectly honest, I'd never heard of Mary Lambert before seeing this 
movie, and now I see why. Apparently, she was the one responsible for 1989's 
reprehensible Stephen King adaption "Pet Semetary". I must have put a mental 
block over her name without knowing it. Her trademark travesties in "The In 
Crowd" appear to be three fold: first, she sticks in lesbian undertones 
amongst several of the girls for no apparent reason (there is one brief 
explanation of some of this, but doesn't account for it all); two, the 
camera work is horrendous - jumping around from scene to scene with no 
consistency (think Oliver Stone's "technique" doubled and used all the 
time); last, the pacing is nonexistent, speeding way up during scenes that 
could have been vaguely interesting if they had tried, and slowing down at 
points in the movie no one could care less about. I'd recommend "The In 
Crowd" to two groups of people: those who love teen movies (assuming such 
people exist); and those who just want to stare at people in bathing suits 
for over an hour (I know those people exist). The movie runs 100 minutes, 
which is about an hour and a half too long. I give it a sadly generous two 
out of five stars.</P>
