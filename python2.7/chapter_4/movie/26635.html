<PRE>"Bedazzled" - A Devilishly Fun Time
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Reflecting on "Bedazzled," a lively comedy about the
Devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic
loser, one sinful thought remains in my mind.  If Hell
means having to spend an eternity with Elizabeth
Hurley (who portrays the fiery demon), then use that
pitchfork and point me the way.   With her pouty lips,
irresistible British accent, and wild display of haute
couture, Hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills
your mind with temptation.  It's practically
impossible to turn this Beelzu-babe down.</P>
<P>Her next target is Elliot (Brendan Fraser), a tech
support geek who is clumsy, awkward, and just too
eager to please.  To aptly picture him, you would have
to remember a Saturday Night Live skit featuring
"Steve the Copy Guy" who effortlessly irritated his
co-workers with his unpolished social skills.  Eugene,
thus, is loathed and feared by his co-workers, who do
their best to stay out of his way.  Yet, beyond his
annoying mannerisms, he's a lovable oaf.  He wishes
that he could get closer to Allison (Frances
O'Connor), a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but
who has never taken notice of him.  However, the odds
of him getting together with her are about the same as
a snowball's chance in Hell.  "Dear God," he prays. 
"I would give anything to have that girl in my life." 
Guess who then shows up?</P>
<P>She makes an offer that is too hard to refuse.  "Seven
utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul."
 There's even an escape clause.  If Elliot's wish
doesn't go exactly the way he likes, he need only
'beep' her (one guess as to what the three-digit
number is) and he gets to start over.</P>
<P>The remainder of the film consists of Elliot's various
fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have
enormous amounts of wealth, power, fame and Allison's
love.  But when he makes sweeping statements such as
"I want to be very, very powerful and very, very rich
and married to Allison", he'll soon learn that the
Devil is in the details.  For example, (and we've seen
this several times in the trailers), he is granted his
wish, but finds out that he's a Columbian drug lord
and that Allison, while married to him, has her eyes
on someone else.  Apparently, the Devil is just as
eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his
soul.  His other wishes also end up with some strange
but funny twist that short-circuits his new life. 
Soon, Elliot wishes that he had never made that deal.</P>
<P>Given the mischievous nature of the Devil, "Bedazzled"
has many amusing moments.  A lot of the credit goes to
Fraser who turns in a great comic performance.  He
ably assumes various personas.  His funniest segment
is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive
man in the world.   Allison becomes so frustrated with
him that she practically urges him to take advantage
of her.
Hurley also heightens the humor quotient, especially
in the transitional scenes when Fraser waits to start
his next wish after bailing out of the previous one. 
It's clear that she's having a good time with it all. 
Yet, while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny
scenes, they conspicuously avoid developing the
allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that
could have added more heft to this story.  But that
would be playing with fire.  What they've got works,
so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little
comedy that it is.</P>
