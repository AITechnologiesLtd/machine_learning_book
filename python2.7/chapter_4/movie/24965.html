<P>I had an acquaintance who aspired to be a film maker.  He had worked on a
number of low budget Hollywood productions as an associate film editor and
as an extra in others.  He went to film school and understood that mechanics
of film making.  His favourite movie star, actor and film maker was Warren
Beatty.  Upon watching one of William Friedkin's films with him, he quipped
at one point: "Typical William Friedkin direction".  He has a point.
Besides 'The French Connection' and 'The Exorcist', what has this man done
that is really considered landmark film making?  Friedkin's career seemed to
dry up after 'The Exorcist'.  Perhaps it was because of his frightful
reputation for allegedly abusing his cast and crew.  A real life priest
named Reverend William O'Malley, who played Father Dyer in 'The Exorcist',
administers the last rites to father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) at the end
of the film after Karras crashes down a flight of stairs.  If you watch
carefully, O'Malley's hand shakes as he makes the sign of the cross.  This
was NOT acting.  According to various reports, Friedkin slapped him across
the face to get him in character for that tragic scene and it worked
magnificently.  Friedkin is also said to have thrown the original music
score for 'The Exorcist', by Lalo Schifrin, into the studio parking lot in a
fit of rage because he thought it was so bad.  Credit the 25th anniversary
release of 'The Exorcist' on DVD for this information.  Friedkin never even
came close to re-gaining legendary status for any film after 'The Exorcist'
and 'Rules of Engagement' has Friedkin written all over it.  The
semi-documentary style of photography, long tracking shots, and blistering
performances make it a return to the old days for the Oscar-winning
director.</P>
<P>Colonel Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) and Colonel Terry L. Childers (Samuel
L. Jackson) play friends who have put their lives into serving their
country.  Childers has an important mission go awry in the eyes of some and
he has to go on trial for it.  While protecting U.S. Ambassador Mourain (Ben
Kingsley) and his family, including his wife (Anne Archer) in a third world
country, shots are fired at the embassy through a  protest turned violent by
the crowd and the lives of the Americans are clearly threatened.  The order
is given by Childers for his men to return fire and many civilians are
killed.  The entire fiasco is captured on video by the embassy's camera and
Childers is informed by his superior officer back home that he will go on
trial for murder as it is believed that Childers opened fire for for no
apparent reason!  It turns out that the military doesn't want a black eye
and the U.S. National Security Advisor, William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood),
destroys the tape that could clear Childers at trial and wants one man to
take the fall for the entire episode of events.</P>
<P>Childers enlists the aid of Colonel Hayes Hodges (Jones) to defend him at
trial.  Hodges' record is shaky and he tells Childers he needs a better
lawyer to go up against the government's top gun and prosecutor Major Mark
Biggs (Guy Pearce).  Other supporting players in the film such as
performances by Philip Baker Hall as Hodges' father and Blair Underwood as a
loyal and fellow officer side by side with Childers during the battle add
little to the film and this movie has a weird scope of academics about it.</P>
<P>My eyes were glued to the screen during the embassy shoot out and the whole
thing is staged very well.  Another plus to the film is the research put
forward by Hodges as he travels to the scene of the alleged crime by himself
and makes some interesting discoveries.  The court room scenes are also very
compelling but much of the film drags at other times.  The performance by
Guy Pearce as the military prosecutor is comparable to the performance by
Kevin Bacon in 'A Few Good Men' as Capt. Jack Ross, who prosecutes the case
against two young marines accused of murder.  Guy Pearce is best known for
his turn as the straight laced policeman Ed Exley in 'L.A. Confidential'.
He's an actor who is English born but who works the American accent very
well.</P>
<P>'Rules of Engagement' is one of those touchy/feely films that may strike a
nerve too close to government that will make some disregard it and want to
bury it.  Its entire structure is based on distrust of those in government
and the film will have a tough sell on many fronts as many politically
charged films usually do.  It has a believable ending, crisp performances
from its leads and William Friedkin doesn't exactly set any new trends but
his experiences as a calculated film maker save this from being a failure.
It is a watchable piece of entertainment that is somewhat predictable and is
another film since 1998's 'The Negotiator', and 1996's 'A Time to Kill',
that places Samuel L. Jackson's character on trial, whether it be in a
courtroom or in the minds of others.</P>
<PRE>OUT OF 4 > * * *</PRE>
