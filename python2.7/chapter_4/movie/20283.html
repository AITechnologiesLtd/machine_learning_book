<P>         For 20 years, Albert Brooks' movies have been acclaimed as some
of the funniest and smartest comedies around, although the general
public has always been less appreciative of his efforts than the
critics.</P>
<P> Instead of expressing bitterness about his lack of commercial
appeal, however, Brooks has turned the situation into the premise for
"The Muse," in which he plays a screenwriter named Steven Phillips who's
so desperate for a hit, he's willing to spend every dime he has -- and
probably several he doesn't -- for the services of Sarah (Sharon Stone),
a vivacious blonde said to have the power to inspire marketable scripts.
Although she charges no fees upfront, Sarah does require a good deal of
pampering and placating: a $1700-a-night suite at The Four Seasons and
trinkets from Tiffany's are barely enough to hold her interest.</P>
<P> Trekking through some of the same territory covered by
"Bowfinger," "The Muse" lampoons Hollywood's tendency to accept
everything and everyone at face value. No one bothers to question
Sarah's credentials; they just look at her client list.</P>
<P> Similarly, the young studio executives Steven has to contend
with may be brainless and amoral, but they look smart and stylish, which
may mean more to their bosses than possessing any sense of tact or
taste. One, who turns out to be Steven Spielberg's cousin Stan (a
brilliant cameo by Steven Wright), helpfully tells Steven to make his
movie "in color, people love color."</P>
<P> But though "The Muse" is a more consistent satire than
"Bowfinger," it's not a prime example of Brooks' talent. The wild
imagination he demonstrated in the hilarious "Defending Your Life" is
tempered here, and the jokes, while generally clever, don't have the
sting of his writing in "Lost in America" or "Mother." It's almost as if
Brooks shared with Steven the desire to create something that wouldn't
create ripples in the mainstream.</P>
<P> The movie's big accomplishment turns out to be giving Stone an
opportunity to display her previously unseen lighter side, a challenge
the actress eagerly accepts. She's serenely confident as Sarah, who
would be insufferable were it not for her disarming smile and upbeat
attitude. It's easily Stone's sharpest and most impressive work since
her Oscar-nominated turn in "Casino."</P>
<P> As Steven's wife Laura -- who gets a little inspiration of her
own from the muse -- Andie MacDowell is quietly charming, but the scene
stealers here are the directors Brooks coaxed into participating
onscreen. Martin Scorsese's hyperactive rant about his proposed remake
of "Raging Bull" ("with a thin guy, I mean a real thin guy") is funny
enough, but James Cameron's appearance is almost enough to make you
forgive him for that "king of the world" remake at the 1998 Oscars.
