<P>   When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, thereby beating the
U.S. in the Space Race, constipated intellectuals and their
acolytes around the country moaned and groaned that the
reason we lost was that our schools put too much emphasis on
sports.  "I traveled all over Eastern Europe and did not run into a
single cheerleader," sniffed Admiral Hyman Rickover, who
endorsed a study-only policy in the American high schools.</P>
<P>   Well bully for them.  One would think that I, having taught high
school English and Social Studies and in the afternoon coaching
nothing more athletic than the Drama Club would be a big
Rickover fan, but no.  Show me a dispirited city that's all rigid with
study and I'll show you dynamic Pyongyang.  Athletics are what
give a school spirit, not trigonometry.  Athletics are what bring in
healthy parental involvement and get them to pass annual
budgets as they are asked to do in Massillon, OH in this movie. 
Sports are what motivate kids to get by in their classes so that
they will be eligible to continue competing on their teams.  And by
the way, last time I looked at the studies, the kids who turned out
for the school teams generally had higher averages than those
who sat on the benches.</P>
<P>   This brings us to what's so fine about Kenneth A. Carlson's
documentary "Go Tigers!"  Carlson, a native of the town of
Massillon, Ohio (population 33,000 but said to have one of the
country's best football squads), is in love with the sport, with the
school, with the community of steel-town blue-collar workers and
its culture.  Massillon is an integrated municipality.  From what
we see the blacks and whites get along on the team, in the
stands, and in the nabes--though Carlson does not do much
exploring of race relations as, say, a documentarian like Fred
Wiseman ("High School") might have done.  Directing
photographer Curt Apduhan--who uses a pair of Hi Def units
shooting simultaneously (for the techies, that's Arri SR-3 super
16mm film cameras for selected games and Sony's High
definition HDW-700A)--he cuts and dissolves rapidly as though
the team's effervescence were not in itself enough to infect the
audience.  (In fact, this MTV-style photography was my only
objection to the picture, and it's not a minor irritant.)</P>
<P>   "Go Tigers!" jumps from pep rallies featuring an array of
miniskirted girls to quite a large band led by a military-style
leader--who evoke a professional sound, I must say--then cuts to
not just one but a bevy of coaches who harangue the squad
when they're behind (in one season they end up with a 4-6
record and are in the dumps), informing the young men that the
other side have bigger balls than they.  From time to time the
tiger cub is trotted out on the field and in one instance, two
bulldog mascots for the other side, McKinley, are seen humping
while the keeper is lecturing the camera presumably unaware of
the reason that the on-site audience is roaring with laughter.</P>
<P>   Some of the more intimate scenes revolve around individual
players, one of whom was put away for 15 months for a rape
which he insists he did not commit (though he agrees that he
deserved to be incarcerated for selling dope).  And if you think
that there's absolutely no corruption in high-school football, think
again.  Parents have agreed in no small number of cases to keep
their kids behind for a year, maybe more, so that their youngsters
would be bigger and more muscular and thereby able to compete
better against the opponents.  In one case a player was recruited
from a neighboring high school.  (Even I was told several times,
and by the swimming coach for pete's sake, to pass some
sloooooooooooooooooooooow kids in Social Studies so that they
could remain on the team.)</P>
<P>   There's just one shot of the school nerd who says that he can't
wait until he's 18 and then he's outa there..."this is bullcrap."  Just
one guy in the whole school who doesn't go for the football
madness?  Well, I must admit, this school is homogeneous, or if
not, Mr. Carlson sure has a way of editing out dissension.</P>
<P>   "Go Tigers!" is anything but a talking heads doc.  It's loaded
with action, packed with spirit, full of itself, and deserving of the
accolades it won when it appeared at the Sundance Festival.</P>
