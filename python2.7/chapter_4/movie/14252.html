<P>Modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever 
has been before, from teenage sitcoms to NC-17-rated films about 
fetishes. The biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects 
reality or just reflects it. "Your Friends And Neighbors" takes a 
different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around 
sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small 
circle of friends. </P>
<P>One of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and 
analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is 
writer/director Neil LaBute's basic setup and some of the unique methods 
he employs to tell the story. Firstly, and most importantly is the fact 
the script tells a rather complex, detailed story of lust, betrayal, 
arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and just plain stupidity between six 
different characters (three men, three women), without hardly any 
supporting characters, (a few have a line or two), mostly extras. 
Everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately 
come full-circle back to themselves, whether it be positive or negative. </P>
<P>But to just state this is arbitrary, and explaining and criticizing the 
process is difficult. LaBute's ability to tell his story through a few 
characters is a remarkable feat, but what's specifically impressive is 
the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits 
roll. For the sake of this review, I will describe the characters and 
refer to them as their main characteristic. Another interesting 
accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited 
focus. We're always able to tell where the characters are (someone's 
home, the gym, a restaurant, hotel room, etc.), but what the city they 
live in, what year it is, what the society is like, etc. is relatively 
unknown. The film is a complete character study with the tight, intense 
drama of the theater. </P>
<P>No one plot dominates the story, which makes the first act a bit tedious 
for its lack of background. We're simply dropped in on the characters' 
lives and are expected to figure out the rest. The characters are a 
group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they 
do, but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives. </P>
<P>First there's Barry (Eckhart) and Mary (Brenneman), a married couple who 
are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other 
situations who don't know what they're problem is. Barry is kind of a 
dorky businessman who loves his wife, and the sex they have, but doesn't 
have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else. Mary is a writer 
of some sort, but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is 
the meekness character, but ironically, doesn't hesitate to commit 
adultery just to feel something. LaBute's script does a good job in 
characterizing Mary and Barry as individuals, but is very light on 
chemistry and connection between the two. Obviously, this is the theme, 
which is enhanced by the actors' good performances, but at the same time 
seems just a bit hollow. </P>
<P>Another couple is Jerry (Stiller) and Terri (Keener) who live together 
and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time, yet they 
constantly argue over anything and everything. Their sex life is also 
fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it 
throughout their infidelitous relationship. If only one aspect of the 
film could use improvement, it would be this area. It's natural for a 
married couple to become bored with each other, but why would two people 
who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together? 
What did they ever see in the other person to begin with? LaBute never 
really answers, but since the film is more concerned with the payoff 
than the process, it still makes for good drama, tension, and manip
ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating. </P>
<P>Two other characters act as catalysts, Cary (Jason Patric) and Cheri 
(Natassja Kinski). Cary is an arrogant, hostile sex-maniac who defines 
the word "bastard." Somehow he is able to bend women to his will, either 
through charm or just attitude, into getting his way. He's the kind of 
guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly 
perverted, but somehow Barry finds comfort in his company, although 
Jerry is always nervous around him. Patric gives an outstanding 
performance, so much so that we want to know more about him despite how 
intimidating and unlikable he is. Cheri is a character LaBute uses as a 
catalyst to see how the other characters react to her. She works in an 
art museum and at some point throughout the film, each character will 
engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is 
always different, from becoming involved in a relationship with one, to 
brushing it off as small talk with another, to being outright appalled 
by yet another. She's a sweet woman, perhaps the most normal of any of 
the characters, and although her symbolism is obvious, her role as the 
outsider is the most relatable. </P>
<P>I will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is 
specifically affected by the others' action, as that's the hook of the 
film. The first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's 
scenarios, but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it 
and with whom. The result is sometimes surprising, other times 
predictable, but the actual course of actions is always fascinating. For 
a while everyone has their fun, but ultimately each character's guilt, 
attitude, or ignorance will disserve them. </P>
<P>One of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is 
supposed to be. Since the characters only interact with each other there 
isn't much pop culture references, as almost everything has a deeper 
philosophy behind it. Are we to assume that these people are, as the 
title states, our friends and neighbors? I don't know of anyone going 
through the same situations as these people. Often times the film is not 
unlike a network melodrama, other times situations are like those not 
seen outside a porno movie. But what this film does have that the others 
don't is repercussions in the end. Although the film creates its own 
reality, it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal. </P>
<P>In what way "Your Friends And Neighbors" is supposed to work is open to 
interpretation. It definitely has a lot to say about the price that 
comes with infidelity, but it could have been even better had it 
expanded on that theme more specifically. Still, it's an accomplishment 
in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern 
perspective. </P>
