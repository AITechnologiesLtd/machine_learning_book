<P>When was the last time you were scared by a movie? Keep in mind that I'm not
talking about being spooked or startled; I'm talking about being totally and
uttering pierced by the sting of fear. The Exorcist? The Shining, perhaps?
Sure, Hollywood comes out with dozens of cheap thrills each year, and it
doesn't take much speculation to figure out that the true art of horror has
been long since swept under the carpet to make way for a genre of teen
comedies that disguise themselves as slasher flicks. But rest assured; The
Blair Witch Project is the real deal.</P>
<P>But the odd thing is, there is nary one special effect or false scare in the
whole of the film. Shot mostly on video (giving it a gritty, real-life
feeling) for a measly $30,000, Blair Witch embodies all that I love about
filmmaking. Making the audience use a little imagination for once, it really
is a breath of fresh air.</P>
<P>As everyone probably already knows, the films deals with three college
filmmakers who travel into the depths of a Maryland forest to document a
local legend. Though they are never heard from again, the footage they shot
was recovered.</P>
<P>The leader of the pack is Heather, the strong-willed film student making the
documentary based upon the Blair Witch phenomena of the title. If Heather
Donahue isn't at least nominated for an Academy Award for her work here,
then I propose a mass boycott of the Oscars. Blending comedy and pathos
seamlessly, she has created a truly sympathetic and ultimately tragic
figure. The performance of the year, in my opinion, and I will be astounded
if one comes along that is half as effective.</P>
<P>Joining Heather in her venture into the desolate woods are Josh (Joshua
Leonard), the 16mm cameraman, and Mike (Michael C. Williams), acting as
soundman. Though not quite as commanding in their roles as Donahue, I dare
you to spot a single moment where either of them are acting. Of course, this
is no surprise, considering the extremes the actors endured to make their
characters as true-to-life as possible. For 10 days, they pretty much
experienced what is depicted as fiction in the movie. Apparently, the whole
thing was entirely improvised, with notes hidden around the woods to simply
give the actors their motivation for the scene. No one can deny that these
are three courageous performances.</P>
<P>And it all paid off in the end, too. For a micro-budgeted independent film,
set forth amidst a slew of obscenely costly "summer" movies, The Blair Witch
Project has made quite a name for itself. Destined to become the most
successful film of all time (in a cost to profit ratio, that is), Blair
Witch first caused a stir at last year's Sundance film festival and
eventually was sold to an independent studio for a mere $1 million (if the
Louisiana Purchase was the best deal in American history, then this has to
be the second best).</P>
<P>A movie so frightening and completely effective is all too hard to come by.
Set the way-back machine to 1990, when John McNaughten's Henry: Portrait of
a Serial Killer premiered in theaters; audiences and critics alike were
taken back by the honesty of such a film, one that broke all the rules and
pulled absolutely no punches. Anyone who has seen Henry will no doubt recall
the infamous scene where Henry and his partner in crime Otis videotape
themselves invading a suburban home and callously killing the family that
inhabited it. Remember that nauseating terror? Remember that unflinching
honesty?</P>
<P>Blair Witch duplicates that same feeling of inner terror and hammers it home
for no less than 80 minutes. I realize that may seem like an excessively
brisk running time, but I'm not sure I could have taken any more than that.
Blair Witch doesn't simply scare you out of your wits; no, it's far to
clever for that. It drains you of every conceivable emotion, and afterwards
you are left numb.</P>
<P>Which, I suppose, brings us to the film's ending. I will say nothing of it
narrative-wise (ruining it would be a crime against humanity), but suffice
to say that it is the creepiest moment since Norman Bates smiled into the
camera at the end of Psycho. Again, no FX, just a profound feeling of shock
and - are you ready for this? Brace yourself - sadness.</P>
<P>You see, unlike most films of its kind, the characters here function as
people first and plot devices second. Right from the opening title card, we
know that the characters will not come out of their situation alive. This
makes their plight all the more sympathetic.</P>
<P>There have been rumors (I'm not sure if anything has been announced
officially) that a sequel or prequel may be in the works. Words cannot
describe the new level of ineptitude that this notion establishes. What's
next, "Schindler's List: The Babyboomer Years"? Or maybe "Saving Private
Ryan 2: Basic Training"? No, The Blair Witch Project should simply stand
alone and not give way to the system.</P>
