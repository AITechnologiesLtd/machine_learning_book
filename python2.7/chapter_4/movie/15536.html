MEET JOE BLACK
Review by Victory A. Marasigan

<P>Here's how the story goes: Death decides to take a rare vacation on Earth,
using a sunny-blonde out-of-towner (Brad Pitt) as his corporeal vehicle. 
In exchange for a temporary extension on his life, wealthy tycoon William
Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to give Death, a.k.a. Joe Black, a tour
of humanity. The child-like -- and ironically angelic -- Joe eventually
finds himself head-over-heels in love with Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani),
putting the elder Parrish at odds with the daughter for whom he wants
nothing but the best (Imagine Dr. Kevorkian dating _your_ daughter). </P>
<P>A pretty silly idea for a movie, isn't it?  To the contrary, the adult's
fairy tale _Meet Joe Black_ rises above the obvious pitfalls of its
premise to tell a thought-provoking and heart-warming story of deep
universal relevance.  </P>
<P>For once, Pitt is able to use his suave doofus persona to create a likable
character.  He and Forlani make a charged, intense on-screen couple.  More
central to the story is Hopkins' relationship with his daughters, which he
works to resolve before his impending demise.  As cliche as his
character's situation is, Hopkins great performance (one of his best since
_The Silence of the Lambs_) and writers Ron Osborne and Jeff Reno's
eloquent dialogue make all the difference in letting us forget that we've
seen this story many times before. </P>
<P>At three hours, the film does carry a bit of a squirm factor, but
objectively, little could have been excised without changing the film's
impact.  If _Meet Joe Black_ moves at a glacially slow pace, it is because
there is so much to take in in every single shot (a Stanley Kubrick
influence, perhaps?). </P>
<P>With its complicated lessons on family relations and the inevitability of
death, _Meet Joe Black_ resonates on a very personal level.  It is
definitely not a movie to go out and see with "the gang." Ideally, the
film should be viewed in a mostly empty theater, where the movie's
blissful quiet can invigorate you. </P>
