<PRE>                          A THOUSAND ACRES 1997
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
             2 :-) :-) Not quite King Lear, but as poignant</PRE>
<P>Cast: Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jason
Robards, Colin Firth, Keith Carradine, Kevin Anderson
Director: Jocelyn Moorhouse
Producer: Steve Golin
Screenplay: Laura Jones, based on the novel by Jane Smiley</P>
<P>Although this may appear to be another girly, weepy ‘chic flic', and it
is, at least it comes at a reasonably high standard. Jocelyn Moorehouse
(HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT) does not resort to cheap tricks for
tears and the plight of these believable characters, are earnestly
addressed on screen.</P>
<P>A THOUSAND ACRES is based on a novel of the same name, written by Jane
Smiley. She has also cleverly entwined elements of KING LEAR into her
novel. A respectable farmer, a pillar in his community, wishes to leave
his farm to his three daughters. Everything seems perfect on the
outside, but beneath this veneer of a happy family, lies a most horrible
secret.</P>
<P>This is the story of three sisters torn apart by the past, the present
and the future. The youngest daughter, Caroline (Jennifer Jason Leigh),
is also her father's favourite. When she disagrees with his will, she is
unceremoniously disinherited from the family. The two older sisters
Ginny (Jessica Lange) and Rose (Michelle Pfeiffer), agree to his will
and take over the running of the farm. It is here that perfection
becomes to crumble, and the true nature of the family is revealed. As
the father (Jason Robards), becomes rapidly paranoid and believes that
the oldest daughters have stolen the farm from him and are now
mistreating him. This evolves into an ugly family and legal battle,
between the youngest daughter and father and the two older siblings.</P>
<P>Issues like infertility, breast cancer, dementia, incest, death and
dying, loss of a mother, forgiveness, unforgiveness, hate, anger,
resentment, sibling rivalry, unfaithfulness, family discord, husbands
and lovers and lots more tear jerking material are addressed. Although
too numerous for a single movie to handle, the novel is available for a
more comprehensive perspective.</P>
<P>Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are wonderful as the competitive,
and yet close sisters. Michelle is particularly good as an angry,
vindictive bitch who is out to destroy her father for what he did to her
in the past, whilst Jessica Lange shows more compassion and forgiveness.</P>
<P>It is these cornfields of A THOUSAND ACRES which binds them all
together, and which will eventually tear them apart.</P>
