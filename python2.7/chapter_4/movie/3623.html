<P>     Lawrence Kasdan directing Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline in a romantic comedy?
Huh?  The director of WYATT EARP isn't exactly known for the breezy sort
of WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING fare.  He does better with the bittersweet--
films like GRAND CANYON and THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST.  So, despite what
the ads say, it's not much of a surprise to find that FRENCH KISS plays
more serious than silly.</P>
<P>     The setup is this:  Meg Ryan is the French-hating, lactose-intolerant
Kate, who's flying to Paris to "win back" her fiance (Timothy Hutton).
Seated next to her is Luc (Kevin Kline), a swarthy, snide Frenchman who
has her frothing within the first five minutes of conversation.  They
bicker and banter, and later reunite for a picture-postcard adventure
that includes every cliche from a stolen necklace to an unctuous
concierge.</P>
<P>     The resulting humor is surprisingly strong, even if Kasdan's direction
doesn't have enough comic rhythm.  (Too many of the bits feel klunky and
heavier than they should.)  The character detail is impressive, which
helps, but the plot disappoints.  Ryan plays yet another neurotic woman,
who spends most of her screen time looking cute and acting exasperated.</P>
<P>     Kevin Kline has the stronger role.  His character is explored at length,
and undergoes a gradual transformation from obnoxious to sensitive.
It's a great portrayal that carries the film.  What *doesn't* work is
his inevitable romance with Ryan.  It feels forced.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Nothing about FRENCH KISS is as casual as it should be.
              The film is overdone just enough to be bountiful, and a
              little too much to be tasteful.</PRE>
