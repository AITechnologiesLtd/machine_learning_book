<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Woody Allen's (Celebrity) latest is a fictional account of a 1930s jazz
guitarist named Emmett Ray (Sean Penn, The Thin Red Line).  The film is
a sugary homage to the music of that period (a fave of Allen) and
features fantastic performances from an ensemble cast.</P>
<P>The film is shot to look like somewhat of a documentary (so it feels a
bit like Zelig).   Allen skillfully blends accounts of Ray's life with
interviews from a panel of jazz aficionados, including himself, Ben
Duncan, syndicated columnist and author of The Jazz Life Nat Hentoff,
and filmmaker Douglas McGrath (Emma), who also co-wrote Allen's Bullets
Over Broadway.  We learn from these experts that Ray is cocky, abrasive
and brutally honest almost to a fault.  In other words, he thinks he
hung the moon, referring to himself as the world's second greatest jazz
guitar player – second only to Django Rhinehart, whom Ray calls a French
gypsy.  He actually idolizes Rhinehart, passing out the only two times
he laid eyes on the six-string legend.</P>
<P>A gifted instrumentalist with a blistering playing style, Ray works the
white clubs of Chicago with a white band before heading to the other
side of the tracks and jamming with black musicians.  He hangs out with
hobos and loves to watch trains and shoot rats at the dump.  Ray is also
a pimp, a kleptomaniac and a drunk, which, together with his prickly
demeanor, leaves the prodigy in many a pickle both with his career and
love life.</P>
<P>Things change when Ray meets a mute girl named Hattie (Samantha Morton,
Dreaming of Joseph Lees) that he is set up with as part of a double date
with a fellow musician.  Ray immediately dislikes the sweet Hattie and
treats her like a leper, but still he brags about his significance,
constantly reminding her that he is the world's second-best guitar
player, or one of the five best 9-ball players, or one of the top six
poker players ever.  Whatever the situation is (save one), he's the
best.  He begins a relationship with Hattie, but eventually dumps her
for the more glamorous Blanche (Uma Thurman, The Avengers).</P>
<P>Penn is fantastic as Ray – a great role for a great actor – but even he
is overshadowed by Morton's  wonderful, wordless performance as the mute
Hattie.  Allen's regular production team is back here to create yet
another top-notch picture with a lovely score from Dick Hyman.  One
change to the mix is the addition of cinematographer Fei Zhao (Raise the
Red Lantern) who, despite not being able to speak English, was able to
glowingly lense the film.  With this comedic effort, Allen yet again
proves that he is one of the most creative writer/directors in the
world.</P>
<P>1:35 - PG-13 for adult language, sexual content and some alcohol and
substance abuse</P>
