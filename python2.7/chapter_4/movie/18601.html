<P>The final installment of what I'd like to call the "unrelated bookstore 
romance trilogy," director Roger Michell's "Notting Hill" is, for my 
money, easily the best (the other two being "You've Got Mail" and "The 
Love Letter"). It is a sparkling romantic comedy, full of so much 
energy, laughs, and intelligence that it also must go down as one of the 
better films of its genre this decade. Taking the overly familiar 
formula of "boy-gets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-gets-girl-back," Michell 
and screenwriters Richard Curtis and Duncan Kenworthy have put an extra 
spin on the potentially mundane by having a great deal to say about 
fame, and the price celebrities must pay, when most would probably 
rather lead a "normal" life. </P>
<P>Set exclusively in the homely England town of Notting Hill, William 
Thacker (Hugh Grant) is a lonely 35-year-old divorcee who runs a travel 
bookshop and shares a townhouse with the goofy, unsightly Spike (Rhys 
Ifans), a scruffy-looking man who is oddly lovable even when he is 
revolting. One day while at work, William finds his life suddenly change 
before his eyes when Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), the world's most famous 
movie star, walks in to do some book-shopping. After a brief encounter, 
William then experiences a "Meet-Cute" with Anna when he accidentally 
spills orange juice on her while walking along the street. After 
stopping by at his home to clean up, it becomes clear that Anna really 
likes William, and might even want to further the relationship, but 
there are, predicatably, many obstacles in the way. For one, the life of 
a movie star is not easy, as they rarely are able to snatch a moment's 
time for themselves. And two, Anna knows that their budding romance 
might very well lead to life-changing consequences for William and 
herself, particularly when the media inevitably catches on to the story.</P>
<P>Watching "Notting Hill," it is clear to see how easily the film could 
have been of lesser quality. After all, we've seen this story outline 
numerous, practically endless, times before and to mostly ho-hum 
results. It is only after the fame aspect is added in that the film 
proves it is trying something a little different, as the dialogue always 
comes off as nothing less than witty and entertaining. This slyness also 
leads to the heavy dose of humor the film has going for it, and I can't 
even remember when I've laughed so hard at a romantic comedy before. </P>
<P>Aside from the scripting, the supporting characters are all comic 
originals, from Ifans, as William's roomate, Spike, who brightens up 
each scene he is in (even if the scenes are already bright), to Emma 
Chambers, as William's talkative, lovable sister, Honey, who is 
fortunate enough to be given the film's most laugh-inducing line of 
dialogue, when she first meets Anna, the movie star. Also effective in 
minor roles are Tim McInnerny, as William's brother, and Gina McKee, as 
his crippled wife, who share a few nice scenes together, and whose 
relationship is believable and touching as a married couple who love 
each other with all their hearts, no matter what.</P>
<P>And of course at the center of the film are the star attractions, Hugh 
Grant and Julia Roberts. Grant is the character whom we follow 
throughout the film, and he gives a memorable performance that more than 
adequately displays the full round of emotions William feels when it 
looks like his relationship with Anna isn't going to work out after all, 
and then when he finds himself given another chance. The question of 
should he take the chance or not is cause for some debate, and your 
opinion will greatly hinge on if you, like William, have fallen for 
Anna. Since she is played by Julia Roberts, of all people, my prediction 
is that most people will grow to care and understand her character's 
plight, as she has all of the money and success that she could ask for, 
but still is burdened with her extreme popularity, the media, and no 
privacy. It would be the easy way out to say that Roberts is, in 
general, playing herself, but I don't think so. Anna is strictly a 
character, but the reason Roberts is so wonderful and right at home here 
is because she, no doubt, has taken her own experiences with fame and 
put them into the context of this film. Together, Grant and Roberts are 
dynamite, and perhaps they could go on to become the next Tom Hanks/Meg 
Ryan romantic duo.</P>
<P>One of the pleasures to be had in "Notting Hills" is in its dealing with 
Hollywood. One of the best, and most hilarious, on-target, sequences 
comes when William drops by the Ritz hotel to see Anna, and finds 
himself in the midst of press interviews. Saying that he is from "Horses 
& Hounds" magazine, William is forced into a seemingly endless stream of 
interviews with Anna Scott's co-stars in her latest film, the sci-fi 
epic, "Helix." The sheer accuracy of the interview procedure is one of 
the reasons the scene is so successful, and is only aided by William's 
utterly benign questions, such as when he asks Anna, "do you wish that 
you had added more horses into your film?" "Not really," replies Anna, 
"seeing that this particular picture takes place in space." Because of 
her fame, Anna knows that she can never have what most people have, 
which is a regular life, but still feels frustrated by the fact that she 
can't do anything without the media turning it into a major headline 
blitz. The treatment of this character element only enhances the film, 
and Anna, so that when she grows upset at one point late in the picture, 
it is an understandable reaction.</P>
<P>Although not vital to the film's story, one added bonus that should be 
pin-pointed is a magical, liberating sequence in which William walks 
down a Notting Hill street and right in front of your eyes, we see the 
seasons change from summer to rain to snow, and finally, to spring. 
Bravo to director Michell for attempting something so fresh and stylish, 
and performing it to perfection.</P>
<P>How everything ends up at the conclusion of "Notting Hill" can be more 
or less telegraphed before the movie even starts, but getting to that 
predictable moment was an unexpected delight, and for the film to have 
ended any other way would have seemed like a cheat. "Notting Hill" is 
the rare, quintessential Hollywood romance--smart, affectionate, 
realistic, and thoroughly likable.</P>
