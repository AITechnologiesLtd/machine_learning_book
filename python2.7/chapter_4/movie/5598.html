<P>     It's interesting to note that two of the best films I've seen 
theatrically in 1996 weren't made this year.  In fact, they weren't even 
made this decade.  The first, Martin Scorsese's classic, TAXI DRIVER, is 
celebrating its twentieth anniversary.  The second, Rene Clement's 
PURPLE NOON, is now age thirty-six.  Championed by Scorsese, this re-
release was handled by Miramax Films, which has brought back to the 
screen one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever to be filmed.  </P>
<P>     PURPLE NOON is an autopsy of a near-perfect crime, and a compelling 
look at the man who commits it.  Played by a twenty-something Alain 
Delon, Tom Ripley is, at first glance, an unlikely criminal.  Apparently 
insecure, he spends his time bumming around Italy, trailing after 
playboy Phillippe Greenleaf (Maurice Ronet) and his beautiful fiancee, 
Marge (Marie Laforet).  Tom has been commissioned by Phillippe's father 
to bring the wayward son back home to San Francisco.  The fee for the 
job is $5000, but, once Tom becomes involved in Phillippe's life, its 
seductive leisure entices him away from his original goal -- or so it 
seems.</P>
<P>     This is all really setup, because the meat of the story reveals 
that Tom is, in fact, an amoral killer, willing to do just about 
anything to get what he wants.  And, while there's a prize for each 
crime, it's not the money that interests Tom.  Rather, he enjoys toying 
with his victims and the police by seeing just how far he can go without 
being caught.  His schemes become progressively more complex, involving 
switched identities, forged signatures, and more than one body.  Tom is 
without remorse; the only emotion he displays is satisfaction at the 
success of his latest caper.</P>
<P>     The plot, which is a wonderfully twisty affair filled with 
ingenious turns, is a delight to watch as it unfolds.  On more than one 
occasion, Tom intentionally places himself in a precarious situation, 
and one fascination of PURPLE NOON is figuring out how he's going to 
extricate himself.  Nothing about this movie is pedantic or predictable; 
it's two hours of pure suspense that puts many of the recent so-called 
"thrillers" to shame.  It's a masterful effort by director Clement, and, 
considering the nature of the main character, it's not hard to 
understand why Scorsese would lend his name to the re-release (much as 
he did for BELLE DU JOUR).</P>
<P>     One of PURPLE NOON's most obvious assets is Delon's acting.  Tom is 
fascinating because Delon makes him so.  This isn't a run-of-the-mill 
villain; he's a complex character with a well thought-out reason for 
everything he does.  He may be a psychopath, but there's a quality about 
him that engrosses and seduces us even as his actions cause repulsion.  
And, because the movie centers on Tom, there are times when we find 
ourselves hoping that his schemes will work, if only for the pleasure of 
seeing what he will do next.</P>
<P>     In addition to Delon's fine performance, PURPLE NOON is 
characterized by expert camerawork and crisp direction.  Clement 
understands how to sustain tension without drawing it out too far.  The 
film is exactly the right length, as are each of the individual scenes.  
Cinematographer Henri Decae has composed each of his shots carefully, 
including a masterful series of closeups of Delon's eyes that reveal the 
sinister intelligence behind the apparently-guileless exterior.</P>
<P>     With TWISTERs and INDEPENDENCE DAYs packing theaters and grabbing 
headlines, it's easy to bemoan the current state of cinema.  So far, 
1996 has not been a particularly good year for movies.  For evidence, 
consider that this, the most suspenseful entry of the year (to date), 
first hit screens over three decades ago.  But, regardless of its 
history, PURPLE NOON is currently available, albeit only in selected 
venues (and probably not in those multiplexes where INDEPENDENCE DAY has 
captured four screens).  There's nothing so engrossing as watching a 
truly intelligent thriller, and that makes this film a rare treat.</P>
