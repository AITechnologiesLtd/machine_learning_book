<PRE>CRUEL INTENTIONS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * 1/2 out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Coderelos De Laclos' novel Les Liasons Dangereuses has been adapted
several times before, and into better movies than Cruel Intentions.
However, this latest adaptation is perhaps the most inventive, and
certainly holds its own against the current glut of teen-centric films.</P>
<P>Rich teens are apparently jaded at an early age.  Just take a look at
the step-siblings, Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and
Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe). Though still in high school, both
are manipulative sexual predators, each taking a different tack.
Sebastian wears his roguish cruelty like a badge of honor, taking
delight in causing misery to those foolish enough to fall in love with
him.  Kathryn, on the other hand, while equally devoted to causing
misery, hides her schemes behind the veil of being the perfect student
at her ultra-rich private academy.</P>
<P>Sebastian has his sights set on his greatest conquest yet:  to deflower
the new headmaster's daughter, Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon), a
teen with morals (gasp!), who has actually proclaimed her celibacy in a
feature in Seventeen magazine.  Sebastian is so confident that he can
bed her that he engages a wager with his sister:  if he loses, she gets
his classic car...but if he wins, the two siblings get to engage in a
session of wild sex.</P>
<P>Kathryn, however, spends her summer seeking revenge.  Her ex-boyfriend
dumped her for a naive twit, Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair).  Kathryn
decides to seek her revenge by poisoning the mind of Cecile.  It's an
intricate plot involving both Sebastian, and Cecile's overly-friendly
cello teacher, Ronald Clifford (Sean Patrick Thomas).</P>
<P>Though it is never able to surpass its cinematic precursors, Dangerous
Liasons and Valmont, Cruel Intentions survives the transition from a
romantic costume drama to a teen sex film surprisingly intact. Where
else but in the world of teen politics could you find a realm to rival
the cruelties of the French aristocracy?</P>
<P>However, the shadow of the earlier films haunts Cruel Intentions
mercilessly.  Ryan Phillippe, for example, seems to be doing his best to
channel John Malkovich for his role.  It may be a performance worth
emulating, but it hardly wins Phillippe any points for originality. At
least Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't try to emulate Glenn Close. However,
her character is saddled with such over-the-top idiosyncrasies, such as
a coke spoon hidden in a crucifix, that it is difficult to see her as
much more than a comical villain.</P>
<P>Selma Blair seems pathetically out of place as the innocent Cecile, a
fact not helped by her incessant overacting.  She's nearly matched by
the odd histrionics of Sean Patrick Thomas.  However, at least his
forced indignation can be mostly attributed to a faltering script.</P>
<P>But, those imperfections aside, Cruel Intentions has a head start on the
run-of-the-mill teen sex romp:  a good story.  There's actually a plot
at work here!  Sure, at times the complex machinations seem to be far
above the capacities of the teens in the cast, but, if you're willing to
give it a chance, there's a good bet you'll be entertained.</P>
<P>The film stumbles a bit at its conclusion, modified (only a slight bit)
from the book, but in a way that seems jarringly false.  Still, you
could certainly do worse than Cruel Intentions, which, though clumsy at
times, at least is not brain-suckingly vapid.  However, after watching
Cruel Intentions, rent Dangerous Liasons, to see how the story should
really be done.</P>
