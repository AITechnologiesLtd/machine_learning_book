<P>     Any excursion into the mind of Mel Brooks is an occasion for cele-
bration, even when it's a surprisingly slim spoof of Dracula films, old
and new.  Slight, and more than a little bit flat, DRACULA: DEAD AND
LOVING IT is at least an improvement over his last film, ROBIN HOOD:
MEN IN TIGHTS.  The laugh count is still awfully low--there hasn't
been a *funny* Mel Brooks movie since, oh, his 1983 remake of TO BE OR
NOT TO BE--but there are a *few* funny moments.  And at least one
classic scene involving a large quantity of blood.</P>
<P>     Casting is part of the problem.  In better days, Brooks had his
pick from the likes of Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder, Dom DeLuise, and
Cloris Leachmen.  Here, with the exception of Harvey Korman and a few
fleeting old faces, he's working with featherweights.  Such as Steven
Weber (JEFFREY) and Amy Yasbeck (PROBLEM CHILD).  (To be fair, Peter
MacNicol is dead-on funny as the insect-loving Renfield.  He has a
great scene with Korman at a breakfast table.)</P>
<P>     Oddly, the role of Dracula seems miscast.  Leslie Nielsen is a
great bumbler, but far less effective as a suave Transylvanian.  (His
inclusion, I suspect, was more market-driven than anything else.  He's
amusing enough, but would people really have paid to see, say, Frank
Langella spoofing himself?)  Brooks, who appears as the vampire-hunting
Van Helsing, plays things straight; perhaps too straight.  Nobody
breaks into song; nobody appears dressed as a Nazi.</P>
<P>     However good-natured the humor is, DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT is
still flat on all fronts.  This movie is neither scary-funny enough;
nor quick-witted enough; nor authentic-looking enough to be effective.
(If anything begs for some serious spoofing it's those great visual
effects in BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA; effects that Brooks never takes a
hearty stab at.  Too bad.)  The old Mel Brooks shows his face in a few
scenes--an autopsy here, a gynecology line there--but, for the most
part, the man who made YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is still down for the count.</P>
