<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Author John Irving so despised last fall's film adaptation of his short
story A Prayer for Owen Meaney that he yanked his blessing from it,
forcing the producers to call it Simon Birch instead.  So he wrote the
screenplay for his novel The Cider House Rules himself, and the result
is one whopper of a fantastic picture.  It's an unconventional
coming-of-age story that is split into two equally beautiful halves.</P>
<P>The film begins in the 1920s, where we are introduced to young Homer
Wells, a resident of a secluded orphanage in St. Clouds, Maine.  Homer
was actually adopted and returned twice; once because he didn't cry
(orphans quickly learn it does them no good) and once because he
wouldn't stop (a victim of child abuse).  Taken under the wing of the
orphanage's director, Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine, Little Voice),
Homer grows up (becoming Tobey Maguire, Ride with the Devil) in the
institution, watches the other children find homes and comes to accept
the fact that he will likely spend his entire youth there.  Under the
doctor's tutelage, Homer even learns how to deliver babies and perform
abortions, even though the idea of the latter is at odds with his
personal beliefs.</P>
<P>Despite having a warm father figure in Dr. Larch and the job of big
brother to the orphanage's other children, Homer longs for a different
life with firm rules and clearer objectives.  He longs to leave, but
can't even join the armed forces because of a heart defect.  Homer finds
an opportunity when a pregnant young woman named Candy Kendall (Charlize
Theron, Mighty Joe Young) visits the orphanage to have an abortion
performed.  Her fiancé, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd, The Object of My
Affection), is a serviceman on leave to help harvest his family's apple
orchard.  When Candy and Wally depart, Homer goes with them, taking up
residence in the rundown cider house on the Worthingtons' land.</P>
<P>In the cider house, which is chock full of popular R&B artists
(including Heavy D and Erykah Badu), Homer finds exactly what he is
looking for, despite the hard, backbreaking work in the orchards.  He
misses Dr. Larch and the other children, but hey, when you've got a girl
like Candy hanging around, it's easy to forget the things that you used
to hold close to you.  The two develop a relationship once Wally heads
back to war and, let me tell you, there is almost nothing more
disturbing than watching Maguire with the angelic Theron.  But even in
the happiness of his newly found freedom, Homer learns that life isn't
full of straightforward answers, despite having rules to live by for the
first time in his life.</P>
<P>The acting in The Cider House Rules is terrific, especially Caine, who
was robbed of a statue last year for Little Voice.  Well, someone was
robbed – either him or Bill Murray (Rushmore).  As the ether-sniffing
doctor, Caine shows genuine love for every child that he cares for,
taking the time to name each one as they are born, and reading them
stories each night.  The line `Goodnight, you Princes of Maine, you
Kings of New England,' which Larch uses as a sign-off to the children
every evening before bed, still leaves a lump in my throat when I see
the trailer, even though it's been over two months since I've seen the
film.  Delroy Lindo (A Life Less Ordinary) also shines in a supporting
role as Badu's father.</P>
<P>The Cider House Rules is a breathtakingly gorgeous film, with director
Lasse Hallström (What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and cinematographer Oliver
Stapleton (William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream) crafting
both beautiful backgrounds and amazingly lush scenery.  The film is as
beautiful as any you will see this year, save possibly Sleepy Hollow and
Snow Falling on Cedars.  My only complaint is the ending (which I would
spoil by explaining here) and the fact that the credits say `Introducing
Erykah Badu,' despite the fact that she already had a role in Blues
Brothers 2000.  Do they think we could ever forget the train wreck that
was Blues Brothers 2000?  Make another film like The Cider House Rules
and I just might be able to.</P>
<P>2:11 - PG-13 for mature thematic elements, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse and some violence</P>
