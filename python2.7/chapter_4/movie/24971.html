<PRE>The Skulls
1/2 ( (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2000 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<P>There are certain beliefs that our society supposedly holds as
universally true. Being nice to other people is a good thing. Thou shalt
not thisandthat.</P>
<P>Then there are those other convictions we secretly live by.</P>
<P>Some of the best films examine our secret dogma and how it affects our
lives and relationships with ourselves and others. The more successful
movies question the truth versus faith and the complex issues involved.
"The Skulls" just takes cheap shots...and does it badly.</P>
<P>The rich and powerful are morally corrupt. Even saints have to
compromise to get ahead. Ultimately that turns out to be a bad idea.
These simplistic doctrines are at the core of this film. No questions.
No exploration. And not much of a story.</P>
<P>Luke (Joshua Jackson) is a poor boy from the wrong side of the tracks
turned star athlete and scholar at an unnamed university that looks
suspiciously like Yale. He wants to go to law school, but lacks the
funds. Until, that is, he's invited to join the Skulls, a secret society.</P>
<P>The Skulls count judges and senators as their members and are an
organized good ole boy network. They will do anything for their brothers
including providing them with new cars, bank accounts, whores and a
career fast track. Didn't George W. Bush belong to one of these?</P>
<P>When one of Luke's buddies shows up dead, he suspects the Skull's
handiwork and wants out. In this junior version of <I>The Firm<I>, he is
stuck for life unless he can come up with a complex plan to outsmart them.</P>
<P>What goes wrong with this film? What doesn't? The acting is third-rate.
Character development is nonexistent. People do things that don't make
sense and say things that no human being would ever utter. The
cinematography is boring. Luke's plan only works by accident. Even the
obligatory sex scene is tame.</P>
<P>Someone should have done a reality check when they were filming this
thing. Our financially strapped hero lives in a luxurious suite posing
as a dorm room. Remarkably, the plot is somehow improbable <I>and<I> predictable.</P>
<P>The movie features mostly missed opportunities. Luke must turn to his
old skills as a petty criminal and enlist the help of techno-savvy
friends he left behind. At this point, the audience is filled with false
hope that something interesting is going to happen with real people. But
it goes nowhere. The scenes are dull and his old friends just disappear
never to show up again.</P>
<P>The story doesn't even tell us what the Skulls are really about. Why
they hold their rituals in the dungeon of the Rue Morgue. Why everyone
and their brother seem to know everything about this super-secret
organization. Why they brand future senators with the skull logo on
their wrists where everyone can see. Why we should care about anything
that happens in this movie.</P>
<P>There is one truth about "The Skulls" that the filmmakers must hope
remains secret. But I think I've just spilled the beans.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for quite a while and he belongs
to societies so secret that even he doesn't know about them.)</P>
