<P>     The "DIE HARD formula" rears its head several times each year, 
sometimes with great success (SPEED), but more often as a miserable 
failure (UNDER SIEGE 2).  SUDDEN DEATH, a DIE HARD meets BLACK SUNDAY 
action flick with Jean-Claude Van Damme playing the hero, falls squarely 
in the latter category.  Even the weakest entry of Bruce Willis' trilogy 
(this year's DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE) was markedly better than SUDDEN 
DEATH.</P>
<P>     Admittedly, any DIE HARD clone is going to demand a heavy dose of 
the ever-popular "suspension of disbelief".  However, there's a 
significant difference between accepting a few contrived plot devices 
and being asked to swallow a storyline that is utterly preposterous and 
implausible.  Nothing in SUDDEN DEATH makes any sense, and there are 
times when the action is so outlandish that the film moves into the 
realm of self-parody.  About the best thing that can be said about this 
movie is that the action scenes, directed by Peter Hyams (OUTLAND), are 
choreographed with flair.  Unfortunately, the material connecting them 
is worthless.</P>
<P>     Van Damme plays the typical John McLane-type hero:  some down-on-
his-luck guy who gets stuck in the crossfire when a nastier-than-nasty 
bad guy (suavely essayed by Powers Boothe) decides to take some 
hostages.  In this case, our villain chooses game 7 of the Stanley Cup 
Finals at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena to spring his trap.  His hostages -- 
in addition to every man, woman, and child in the stands -- include the 
Vice President and Van Damme's daughter (Whittni Wright).  If a huge sum 
of money isn't transferred into his numbered bank accounts, he's going 
to start killing people -- first one or two, then everybody attending 
the game.</P>
<P>     While trying to stop Boothe's Foss, Van Damme gets to fulfill a 
fantasy:  defend the Penguins' goal at a critical juncture of the game.  
Never mind that no one, including his teammates, recognizes he's not the 
real goalie, or that he's supposed to be finding and defusing bombs 
instead of slapping around a puck on the ice.  If this seems like the 
scene from THE NAKED GUN where Leslie Nielsen impersonates an umpire, 
it's probably just a coincidence, although both films have about the 
same level of believabilty in these instances.</P>
<P>     Hard as it may be to accept, Van Damme has finally found a cast 
that acts on his guttural level.  Powers Boothe looks as if he could 
care less about the role, and appears content to do the absolute minimum 
to cash his check.  He's neither sinister nor menacing, and doesn't 
offer a single biting one-liner.  The young actors playing Van Damme's 
children are awful and Raymond J. Barry's Vice President is a walking, 
talking cliche.  There's nothing interesting about any of these 
characters, and no real reason to care whether they live or die.  For a 
movie trying to build suspense through the dynamics of character 
relationships, that's a fatal flaw.</P>
<P>     Simply put, SUDDEN DEATH is a bad movie.  Although not quite as 
unwatchable as two of this year's similar entries -- MONEY TRAIN and 
UNDER SIEGE 2 -- the film has virtually nothing to recommend it to 
anyone who allows their brain to continue functioning while in the 
audience.  Deriving shallow enjoyment from SUDDEN DEATH's poorly-acted, 
extravagantly absurd series of predictable action sequences demands one 
of three characteristics: an irrational fondness for Van Damme, a love 
of stale, artless films, or an unhealthy tendency towards masochistic 
experiences.  This particular DIE HARD clone comes dead on arrival.</P>
