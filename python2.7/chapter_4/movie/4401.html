<PRE>                               SHANGHAI TRIAD
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     When better films will be made than most of the current crop, when
we look back to see who were the really great directors, the name of
Zhang Yimou will be high on the list.  Lacking the equipment in China
that many countries have, he has nevertheless turned out some fabulous
films.  At age 45, he has already to his credit RED SORGHUM, JU DOU,
RAISE THE RED LANTERN, THE STORY OF QUI JU, TO LIVE and now, SHANGHAI
TRIAD.</P>
<P>     In most of his films his starring actress was Gong Li, beautiful
and a mere thirty years old in 1995.  Films she made with other
directors include FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, among others.</P>
<P>     While the story takes place in the 1930s in Shanghai, with various
war lords running the opium and prostitution rings, the similarity to
present day China has angered the current Chinese government and there
is a question of whether it will be allowed to be released there.  The
Chinese government has recently forbade him to attend the New York Film
Festival's opening night presentation of the film.</P>
<P>     Mr. Tang (Li Boatian) is the equivalent of a Mafia godfather.  By
aiding Chiang Kai-Shek and helped kill many of the Communists who were
anti Chiank Kai-Shek, he awarded the warlord status.  In addition, he
has been permitted the "services" of the beautiful Xiao Jinbao (Gong
Li), a singer and prostitute.</P>
<P>     Mr. Tang trusts no one whose family name is not "Tang."  A
relative allows her fourteen-year-old son to be employed by Mr. Tang.
It is through the eyes of this boy, Tang Shuisheng (Wang Xiao Xiao)
that we, the audience, learn of what is happening.</P>
<P>     As the story unfolds we are surprised at its many twists and turns
which lead to a tragic ending of the film.  For days the film haunted
me; it is that kind of film.</P>
<PRE>In Mandarin with English subtitles.</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Zhang Yimou</PRE>
