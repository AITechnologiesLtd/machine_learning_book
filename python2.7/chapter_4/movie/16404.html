<PRE>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>So what's on your ideal movie checklist?  Let's take a look at director Luis
Mandoki's MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and see how it stacks up.</P>
<P>Beautiful people?  Check.  With Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul
Newman, you've got them in spades.</P>
<P>Gorgeous images?  Thanks to Caleb Deschanel's dazzling cinematography of
glistening ocean waters and warm interior sets, you can put a big checkmark
there.</P>
<P>Believable romantic chemistry?  Another check.  Costner and Penn are
wonderful together and just as awkward as lovers in real life would be.</P>
<P>Now this is where the scoring gets tricky.  How does your personal ranking
system handle intelligent stars stuck in a heavily clichéd drama?  In this
case the whole audience knows what several of the key turning points have to
be, and they're right.</P>
<P>And how many credits do you deduct when a completely ridiculous and
implausible ending comes totally out of left field for the sole purpose of
mass audience manipulation.  Do you feel violated as a viewer?</P>
<P>In a movie that is as inviting and charming as it is annoying and
infuriating, how to evaluate it is a tough call.  Sometimes you're
captivated, and other times you're exasperated.  Will the good outweigh the
bad for you?  Maybe one of those personality tests would help.  If you are
in the hopelessly romantic category, you'll probably like the film's soap
opera predictability and emotional shenanigans.  On the other hand, if you'
re more analytic, well … You get the idea.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around two people with huge voids in their hearts.  As
unassuming newspaper researcher Teresa Osborne, Robin Wright Penn plays
against her usual tough-as-nails type.  Teresa is a divorced single mom, who
was happily married and planning a second kid when one day she saw her
husband with another woman.  Teresa is a beautifully shy sort who bursts
into girlish giggles when she feels unsure of herself.</P>
<P>As Garret Blake, a repairer of broken ships, Kevin Costner plays a man whose
heart bears what he thinks is the irreparable damage of a lost wife.  The
ever-melancholy Costner is well chosen as a man who sees himself as
hopelessly cast adrift in a sea of sadness.  When presented with a glimmer
of happiness, he spends time watching his shoes rather than the person in
front of him.</P>
<P>The setup for their meeting is a bottle containing a beautiful love letter
that Garret wrote some time ago to his wife.  In its confessional passages,
he tries to atone for his sins of omission.  He wasn't the husband he wished
he had been.  When Teresa accidentally discovers the poetic message, she
launches into a quest to locate its author.</P>
<P>Teresa finds Garret early in the story but doesn't tell him about the
message.  The audience waits for the inevitable confrontation scene in which
he discovers the truth and turns on her.  Until this clichéd scene, they
have a romance that's heavy on cuddling.  A gentle and tender lover, Garret
is fond of softly stroking Teresa's neck.</P>
<P>As Garret's father, Dodge, Paul Newman turns in a confident and sassy
performance.  Dodge is strictly a two-beer dad, who is full of carefully
delivered advice for his son.  For one, Dodge claims that his son's coffee
is so terrible he shouldn't foist it off on any potential girlfriends.
Dodge worries that Garret will let Teresa slip through his fingers.  `If I
was about a hundred and fifty years younger, you'd be in trouble young
 lady,' a handsome, smiling Dodge tells Teresa.</P>
<P>After a long romance that is quite sweet but meanders frequently, the movie
comes to its maudlin conclusion.  The result is a mixed bag of a movie –
just right for some viewers but perhaps too clichéd for others.</P>
<P>MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE runs too long at 2:12.  The movie is rated for PG-13 for
sexuality and a little profanity and would be fine for kids 11 and up.</P>
