<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>In recent years, the kingdom of the action film has gone awry.  I'll
admit up front that it's a dubious category to begin with, because, if
you think about it, action films are little more than stylized and
widely-accepted pornography.  I don't look down upon them as a whole,
for there are many that are quite good.  But it seems that most action
films that arise these days are either big, loud, and stupid (The
Avengers), small, timid, and stupid (Mercury Rising), or just plain
stupid (Godzilla).  Here, at last, is a film that doesn't quite fit into
any of these categories.</P>
<P>John Frankenheimer's Ronin (which, despite what the credits say, was
written mostly by David Mamet) is an action film that seems to aspire to
realism and anti-silliness.  It is highly stylized, with some of the
best camera work and car chases I've seen this year, but it's also about
characters and emotions, with Mamet's cynical edge shining through
almost every moment of dialogue.  The film is exciting and always
enjoyable, but it's also thoughtful in a way few action films are (or
even try to be).  Films like this remind me that even pornography can
occasionally pass for art.  </P>
<P>However, the most interesting thing in Ronin is its complete lack of
any story.  It's just about a bunch of international crooks trying to
get their hands on a metal case.  The title of the film refers to a
group of samurai who have lost their master, and roam the countryside
searching for mercenary work; the characters in this film behave much
the same way.  The main character is Sam (Robert De Niro), an American. 
He's a sharp guy, and keeps most of his buddies alive (ah, I love the
jingoistic themes in American action films).  Among his accomplices are
Vincent (Jean Reno), a French guy, Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard) a Russian
guy, and Deirdre (Natascha McElhone), an Irish woman.  </P>
<P>Deirdre, as it turns out, is the one leading the charade, and her boss,
Seamus (Jonathan Pryce), is the one who wants the metal case.  What's in
the case?  Hell if I know.  The metal case is nothing more than a red
herring, and because every single review I've read of Ronin mentions the
fact that we don't get to find out what's in the case, the question
never once surfaced in my mind as I viewed the film.  To be honest, I
don't care what's in the case.  If you think about it, there's probably
nothing in the case, for an empty prop is easier to carry around than
one full of gold or drugs or whatever it could be in the context of the
story.</P>
<P>I've read reviews that discuss Ronin as a "confusing" picture, but
there's no reason to discuss it on a level of coherence or sensibility. 
As I said, the plot is pure McGuffin, and the only thing that will
linger in the memory are the characters and the individual action
scenes.  Frankenheimer is an experienced, skillful director, and Ronin
proves that he hasn't lost anything since he made The Manchurian
Candidate nearly forty years ago.  All the action sequences here -- from
the roaring car chases all the way through the shootouts on
claustrophobic Paris streets -- are fresh and original, and never reek
of derivation or obligatory boredom.  The camerawork in the quiet scenes
is even more noticeably sharp; the best scene in the film has Sam,
wounded with a bullet in the gut, guiding Vincent through the process of
removing the slug with a scalpel and a pair of scissors.  
Frankenheimer's visual style is unique and convincing, so much so that
every scene in the film rises far above the typical perfunctory
execution of most action films.  </P>
<P>On top of all this, Ronin has characters.  Sam is an interesting one,
and De Niro is terrific in the role (though he could play this guy in
his sleep).  What motivates him to do what he does is left largely to
the imagination, but a potent romantic subplot with Deirdre is all we
need for full characterization.  In the female role, the wondrous
McElhone (The Truman Show) is vigorous and engaging.  Reno creates a
pleasant, sympathetic character, while both Skarsgard and Pryce turn in
memorable performances as truly chilling individuals.  What makes all
these people interesting, however, are the dynamics between them -- the
characterization resonates beyond the action film backdrop.</P>
<P>I suppose that real-life action sequences rarely happen in real life. 
Even the ones that I'd call "realistic" are pretty scarce in the real
world.  I've been around twenty years, and I've never seen anything that
might work as a thrilling sequence in an action film.  Ronin, however,
makes itself believable by making the characters shady and interesting,
and by having the action take place in a different country, so the
victims of American pop-culture (such as myself) can observe these
things and say, "Wow, that really can happen in Europe!"  Frankenheimer
and Mamet have created a classic action film here, one that will be
remembered because it's so much less silly than its brethren.  </P>
