<PRE>_Road_Trip_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>The recruited young seatfillers at the press screening audibly ate up
every crass minute of this college road comedy--a scene that I am certain
will be duplicated in many theatres the nation over as the film becomes
one of the summer's sleeper successes.  However, if you don't find gags
such as, say, jumping a car over a downed bridge funny, likely you won't
enjoy the string of equally unoriginal and far raunchier gags that
director/co-writer (with Scot Armstrong) Todd Phillips passes off as
plot.  The antics are set into motion when Josh (Breckin Meyer), who
attends college in Ithaca, NY, accidentally sends his Austin, TX-based
girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) a videotape of his infidelity with
the fetching Beth (Amy Smart).  With only three days until Tiffany
returns to her dorm after a bereavement leave (her grandfather just
passed), Josh and friends E.L. (Seann William Scott), Rubin (Paulo
Costanzo), and Kyle (DJ Qualls) hit the road to intercept the package.</P>
<P>Just how much emphasis does Phillips give individual gags over basic
storytelling practices?  I did not know Scott's character's name until
the last scene, when narrator Barry (Tom Green), who recounts the story
of the film to a campus tour group, tells the characters' fates.  Green
will undoubtedly be the main draw for the young MTV crowd, but not only
is his screen time limited, Phillips and Armstrong don't find a smooth
way to fit him into the film.  The framing device of the tour has a weak
payoff, and Barry's involvement in the main story--he has to feed Rubin's
pet snake while the guys are away--is tangential at best.  Not that the
main story is all that great to begin with: just a series of uninspired
gags, ranging from the gross (a sperm bank interlude) to the insulting
(the white quartet is scared by a room full of black men--how funny and
progressive).  The trip would be more tolerable if this motley crew were
fun to hang out with, but with the exception of Meyer (whom I've grown to
like more with each film), the travelers are annoying.  Scott's E.L. is
basically _American_Pie_'s obnoxious Stifler with more screen time; the
character of Rubin is nondescript and Costanzo personality-free; Qualls
fails to command any sympathy as the token nerd.  If you're tempted to
watch _Road_Trip_ by the raucous trailer, be forewarned: it gives away
nearly all of the film's better jokes.</P>
