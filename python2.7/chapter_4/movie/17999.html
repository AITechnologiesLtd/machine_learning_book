<P>A Bug's Life is the second of 1998's cartoon bug movies, this one from
Disney and Pixar (who made 1995's Toy Story).  It's 180 degrees
different from the year's previous bug film, Dreamworks' Antz.  Where
Antz was more adult in it's tone and more realistic in it's appearance,
A Bug's Life is strictly for the kids.  It's Disney... what did you
expect?</P>
<P>A Bug's Life is about a colony of ants who are terrorized by a group of
grasshoppers, led by the oh-so-cleverly named Hopper (voice of Kevin
Spacey).  Flik (voice of Dave Foley) is an accident prone misfit in the
ant colony who is sent off to find "tough bugs" to help the ants fight
the evil grasshoppers.  He stumbles across a group of bugs in an "insect
bar" who he believes are the answer to his problems, but as it turns out
they are just a group of circus performing bugs.  Flik leads these bugs
back to his colony where comic misadventures occur, as you'd expect.  I
never thought I'd see anyone remake Three Amigos... but Disney has done
it.</P>
<P>The DVD release of A Bug's Life contains both the original widescreen
2.35:1 version of the film, and "a specially
rendered full-screen version which bypassed the usual film-to-video
transfer by going direct from the digital source
to DVD master".  Those of you who care about such technical details
should understand what I just said (and those
of you that don't won't care).  Both sets of "bloopers" from the film's
end credits are also on the disc.</P>
<P>The computer animation is simply fantastic in A Bug's Life.  Yes granted
the bugs have been "Disney-ed up" a great
deal, as the ants are cute blue creatures with more human-like features
than insect ones.  The colors are bright and
vibrant, and the picture is crystal clear.  A visual delight, if you
will.</P>
<P>Also included on the disc is the Pixar short film "Geri's Game," which
won an Oscar.  Other than that there are no
extras whatsoever... certainly nothing to justify the DVD's $35 retail
cost.  The Signature Selection release of
Antz on DVD absolutely destroys this disc in terms of extras.  Fans of
special editions on DVD (myself being one)
deserve more.</P>
<P>Kids should enjoy this one much more than Antz, but parents could go for
either one.  To me, A Bug's Life was
equally as entertaining as Antz... it's rarely laugh out loud funny but
it's never boring either.  It's nice to look at,
and the cast and their voice acting is excellent.  A pleasant way to
spend an hour and a half.  [G]</P>
