<P>Okay, stop me if you've heard this one:  the Coolest Guy in School gets
dumped by his bimbo girlfriend.  His best friend -- the second-coolest
guy in school -- dares him to take the class nerd out on a few dates and
turn her into the prom queen.  The Coolest Guy has a few reservations
about this, because he's also the Nicest Guy in School.  Nontheless, he
convinces the school nerd to go out with him, and, slowly-but-surely, he
realizes that he's in love with her.  We are then treated to a grand
climax at the senior prom, where suspense is generated from wondering
who is going to be crowned queen of the prom.</P>
<P>If you're looking for an original plot, you won't find it in She's All
That.  The problem with the high school comedy/drama is that every
possible scenario was explored by John Hughes in the 80s.  Nowadays,
just about the only thing anyone can do to make a watchable high school
comedy is to make it extremely authentic (Can't Hardly Wait) or so
patently absurd that one simply can't deny its charm.  This is the case
with She's All That:  here is a film bored with its own story, and
manages to give us a lot of laughs and a few interesting characters by
not focusing on the plot too much.  The result is a pleasantly pointless
and satisfyingly surreal teen comedy.</P>
<P>The Coolest Guy to whom I referred earlier is Zach Siler, played by a
surprisingly funny Freddie Prinze Jr.  His best friend (the
second-coolest guy) is played by teen dream Paul Walker (who failed to
show us his stuff in the unwatchable Meet the Deedles).  Laney Boggs is
the school nerd, and is embodied by Rachel Leigh Cook.  Laney is not
actually a nerd by all standards -- she does get good grades, but that's
irrelevant (Zach did, after all, get into Dartmouth).  She's mostly just
a recluse; she works all the time to help out her father (Kevin Pollack)
and brother (Kieran Culkin), and when she's not working, she's painting
abstract art or acting in abstract stage productions.  </P>
<P>The plot and story is certainly just an amalgamation of every high
school farce ever made.  What sets She's All That above most films of
the genre is director Robert Iscove's tonal approach.  The film is
excessive and exaggerated, and paints a truly ludicrous vision of high
school.  It's not unrealistic, it's just cinematic hyperbole.  The film
takes place in Beverly Hills, so all the kids are rich (except for
Laney's father, who is a self-employed pool man).  All these wealthy
characters provide for numerous sets and locations that are huge (my
senior prom did not take place in a three-story hotel lobby) and
well-kept (my high school looked more like a giant bathroom than a
summer retreat on Maui).  </P>
<P>But Iscove, writer Lee Fleming, and the actors all take the perfect
tone to make She's All That a ridiculously fun film.  One of the best
scenes in the film is early on:  Laney is in art class, and a goth queen
(played by the Clea "I'm So Dark" DuVall) approach her and say, "Most
artists of your type are only appreciated posthumously."  Laney looks at
her, confused.  She continues:  "So, we think you should commit
suicide."  This scene isn't totally relevant to the story, but it's
funny and offbeat in the same way much of the film is.  The subplot
involving Zach's ex-girlfriend (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and her new boyfriend
(a super-self-absorbed member of MTV's The Real World, played by Matthew
Lillard) is absolutely hilarious.  Then there are the charming little
details, like the father who watches Jeopardy! only to miss every single
question.</P>
<P>The acting is dead-on from most of the cast; Prize Jr. stands out as a
likable leading guy, and Cook wins our sympathy early on with her
lovable dorkiness.  Walker makes a good one-dimensional villain, and
Kevin Pollack steals his scenes as Laney's father.  </P>
<P>No one expects depth from a movie like this.  In fact, I'd say that
She's All That is about as good as a movie like this can be.  Based on
recent entries into the teen comedy genre, it seems that coming up with
an original idea is basically out of the question.  But She's All That
proves that a few big laughs and a little bit of silliness can revive a
plot even as tired and played as this one.  </P>
