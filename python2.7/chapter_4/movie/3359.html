               A film review by Maoist Internationalist Movement</PRE>
<PRE>-    MIM Notes 98, March 1995    -
by MC17 and MC206</PRE>
<P>     This movie about the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural
Revolution in China was meant to be reactionary and in that context,
it's a pretty good film.  It's a good film not because it portrays the
important advances made in the Cultural Revolution in a way that makes
clear to the uneducated audience why the revolution was such an advance
(it doesn't even try to do this).  It is a good film because it
basically tells the truth.</P>
<P>     The movie focuses on a family that faces a lot of hard times
through the Cultural Revolution.  Out of context, to an Amerikan
audience, these hard times could seem like the fault of a failed
revolution.  This is a big problem with the movie.  When one man dies
of liver trouble, if the audience does not know how much medicine has
advanced during the revolution they would think this is the fault of
backward medical care that came from a failed revolution.  When another
man is going blind due to eye problems, the audience is again left
thinking it is just the failure of medicine under Mao that left the
doctor with only the option of suggesting that he not put too much
stress on his eyes.</P>
<P>     On the positive side, the movie lets all of it's characters
survive the Great Leap Forward with collective kitchens and enough
(though scarce) food.  One of the brothers in the family is clearly a
Rightist by all that he says and does, and he is sent off to a
rectification camp where he seems to learn some things.  The main
character admits that he was a Rightist all along.  The husband of the
main character is also sent off to rectification camp and the movie
does not try to lie and make these camps out to be evil.  The husband
is about to return when he is killed in an accident by a falling tree.
Again, some audiences will take this to mean that the revolution killed
him, but we later learn that the husband did not view the rectification
bitterly and was not angry that people had denounced his liberal
political views.</P>
<P>     Later in the movie the main character marries an older party
member: she says she is doing it to provide some structure for her
son.  As soon as they move in with him the audience is struck with the
size of his house and the amount of his wealth.  Compared to the
situation of the average Chinese, this man is really well off.  After a
while he tells his wife and son that he is being criticized and that he
will be arrested soon.  As he tells them this we see him burning
papers.  The thinking viewer of this movie should take this as an
example of correct criticism during the Cultural Revolution.  This man
had used his position in the party to gain wealth and a bourgeois
life.  He even used his wife as a servant, contrary to the situation
she had enjoyed in her previous marriages to poorer men.</P>
<P>     There are examples in this movie of the Cultural Revolution going
too far.  In fact, Mao criticized the ultraleftists in the Cultural
Revolution for their line of "criticize all, overthrow all."  He said
that they went too far and were too violent when struggle should have
been carried out without violence and when people should have been
rectified rather than punished.  There were clearly people who were
wrongly criticized, but there was only one example of serious
punishment for a non- existent crime.</P>
<P>     One revolutionary young woman quits her job in the army because of
what is hinted at as gender discrimination.  She is later put in prison
during the Hundred Flowers campaign of 1957.  This is probably a
realistic example of one of the errors of the revolution.  Some people
who were not politically enemies were punished because of appearances
of their actions or because of overzealous cadre.  She is released
during the Cultural Revolution.  And the prisons were not portrayed as
evil institutions of torture.  Again a mark in favor of the movie.</P>
<P>     The movie also tries to portray an atmosphere of fear in which
people had to watch every word they spoke for fear that they would be
punished.  The reality of this is that incorrect ideas should be
criticized whenever and wherever they are found.  It is a good example
of liberalism that the main characters of the movie let friends and
relatives slip by saying reactionary things without struggling with
them over these things.  Of course the movie did not try to explain why
it is that people would want to struggle against incorrect ideas
because that was not it's purpose.  Wait until MIM produces some
films.</P>
<P>     This movie is good for Maoists to see.  It is important that
people realize that the Cultural Revolution was not perfect, but that
it did a lot to advance the struggle against liberalism.  In the
context of study about Chinese history and what really happened, this
film could be informative.  But if you have not studied up on the
Cultural Revolution and do not yet know why the people were encouraged
to criticize their leaders, you would be better off sending $8 to MIM
for a copy of Jean Daubier's book, THE HISTORY OF THE CHINESE CULTURAL
REVOLUTION, rather than seeing this misleading movie.</P>
