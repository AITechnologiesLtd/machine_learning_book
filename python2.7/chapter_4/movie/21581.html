<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Luc Besson's (The Fifth Element) well-intentioned but severely uneven
story of the Maid of Orleans brazenly portrays its heroine as more of a
delusional schizophrenic teen than a saint.  But who's to say that she
wasn't really mental?  Maybe we're just used to seeing Joan portrayed as
a dignified, righteous woman that will do anything for her King and for
her God.  Crazy or not, The Messenger is still a major disappointment
from a director as accomplished as Besson.</P>
<P>The story takes place during the Hundred Years' War in fifteenth century
France, where the young Joan is an illiterate peasant girl that
occasionally hears the voice of God.  She constantly seeks the
confessional at her church with such ferocity she seems like an early
sufferer of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  On her way back from
confession one day, she finds a sword while rolling around in a field of
flowers and believes it to be a gift from the heavens.  Joan arrives
home to find English soldiers burning her village to the ground and
looks on in horror as a soldier kills and rapes (in that order) her
older sister.</P>
<P>Years later, seventeen-year-old Joan (Milla Jovovich, He Got Game) is
received by The Dauphin (John Malkovich, Being John Malkovich), the man
who would be King if the country weren't being controlled by the
English.  In one of the film's better scenes, Joan must find The Dauphin
in a room full of people despite not knowing what he looks like.  When
she passes this test, The Dauphin agrees to give Joan an army to fight
the English, who here are portrayed as obscene barbarians with bad
teeth.  Remember, Besson is a Frenchie.</P>
<P>While the graphic battle scenes are cool, you can't help thinking how
they pale in comparison to Braveheart, especially every time you see
blood splashed on the camera.  On her white horse, Joan's voice seems
too squeaky to command an army, yelling horribly clichéd lines to incite
her troops to battle.  Despite her foolish and hasty lack of war
tactics, Joan manages to win huge battles in both Orleans and Loire.
She even earns a victory in one battle just by telling the English to go
home.</P>
<P>About ninety minutes into the film, The Dauphin is crowned King Charles
VII and, having attained his lifelong goal, loses interest in Joan's
pursuit of a free France.  A little over one year later, Joan is
captured in Compiegne by the Burgundians and later sold to the English,
where they try her as a witch and a heretic in an attempt to discredit
Charles VII.  Joan's incarceration causes her to become delusional, even
dreaming up a big-nosed conscience (Dustin Hoffman, Wag the Dog) that
tells her, "You didn't see what was; you saw what you wanted to see."
This is when the film starts to get interesting, but it's way too late.</P>
<P>Say what you will about Jovovich's clumsy performance, she is pretty
believable as an insanely fervent girl.  An established actress would
have been too distracting, especially when crazy Joan hacks off her long
tresses to fit in with her male soldier counterparts.  The result is the
second Matt Damon-esque haircut on an actress this month (see Hilary
Swank in Boys Don't Cry for the other).  Even though Jovovich seems all
wrong, try thinking of a better actress that could pass for a teenager.
And LeeLee Sobieski doesn't count.</P>
<P>As The Dauphin/Charles VII, Malkovich once again shows that he has
become a parody of himself, while Faye Dunaway's (The Thomas Crown
Affair) performance as Yolande D'Aragon is devalued by a distracting
purple vein that runs down the middle of her forehead.  Besson's visual,
MTV-style direction certainly makes the earlier parts of the film more
watchable, but the usually reliable director (La Femme Nikita, The
Professional, The Fifth Element) falls flat here.  All of the really
stylistic images are given away in the trailer.  But give him credit for
trying to represent Saint Joan's religious visions as a figment of her
imagination.  Maybe those wacky Dogma protestors are picketing the wrong
film.</P>
<P>2:35 - R for extremely graphic violence, intense battle scenes, rape and
adult language.  Oh, and the whole burning at the stake thing, too.</P>
