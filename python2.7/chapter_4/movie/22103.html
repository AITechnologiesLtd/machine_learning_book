<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Much like Oliver Stone can't quite seem to get his head out of the ‘60s,
director Barry Levinson (Wag the Dog) keeps returning to 1950s
Baltimore.  This city and period of time has already served as the
setting for three of his films - Diner, Tin Men and Avalon – not to
mention Levinson's television drama Homicide, although that was set in
present-day Baltimore.  What would make a person focus that much
attention on one specific era?  Who cares?  Between the two directors,
almost a dozen films in as many years that focus on either ‘50s
Baltimore or the turbulent ‘60s have been made.  And for the most part,
these movies have been spectacular, combining to win seven Oscars out of
the thirty-two nominations they have received.</P>
<P>While Stone hit a stumbling block with 1993's Heaven & Earth, he
rebounded the following year with Natural Born Killers, perhaps
realizing that it was time for a change.  But not Levinson.  With last
year's debacle Sphere under his belt, he returns to ‘50s Baltimore for
yet another touching, semi-autobiographical tale of a middle-class
Jewish family.  Oy vey!  Granted, Liberty Heights isn't anywhere near as
malodorous as Sphere, but the film sure ain't no Avalon.</P>
<P>Set in 1954, Heights' central focus is on the Kurtzman family.  They
live in the northwest section of the city, known as Liberty Heights, in
a time marred by both McCarthyism and racism.  The main character is Ben
(Ben Foster), a high school senior who also narrates the film.  He
explains at the film's beginning that his entire neighborhood consisted
of Jews and, as a result, he always assumed as a young boy that the
whole world was Jewish.  His first experience of `the other kind' (as
his mother referred to gentiles) was at a friend's house during an
awkward lunch that consisted of white bread and luncheon meats, both
mysterious foods to the lad.</P>
<P>Heights basically consists of three stories.  The first follows Ben's
blossoming friendship with a black girl named Sylvia (Rebekah Johnson)
in his homeroom class at his recently segregated school.  Both kids know
that a potential romantic relationship would be damned by both of their
families, not to mention society, but they continue to secretly see each
other.</P>
<P>The second story involves Ben's father Nate (Joe Mantegna, The Rat
Pack), who runs numbers as well as a failing burlesque theater
downtown.  Nate is forced to deal with the threat of a state lottery,
which would kill his racketeering business.  He also is forced to do
some creative financing after an up-and-coming dope pusher named Little
Melvin (Orlando Jones, Mad TV) hits his number on a $50 bet.</P>
<P>Heights' third and most unnecessary story concerns Ben's older brother
Van (Adrien Brody, Summer of Sam) as he tries to fit in with the gentile
crowd to win the affections of an icy WASP princess (model Carolyn
Murphy) during a Halloween party.  The girl, Dubbie, already has a
smarmy beau with a penchant for drinking and driving, but Van doesn't
know this until later on in the film.  Levinson makes every gentile seem
just as evil as the English were portrayed in Luc Besson's The
Messenger.</P>
<P>The trials and tribulations of Ben and Nate eventually intertwine toward
the end of the film, which makes Van's seem really pointless.  It also
makes you wonder why the mom didn't have her own storyline.  Since the
film is supposed to be about a Jewish family, it seems weird to exclude
the matriarch.  Instead, she is reduced to yelling at her kids while
bent over at the waist.  The ending, while intended to be an emotional
heart-tugger, is instead a bit empty.</P>
<P>If you take away the linear script (which Levinson also wrote), the rest
of the film is actually quite lovely.  The acting is solid all around.
The music is phenomenal, using equal parts Frank Sinatra, James Brown
and Tom Waits.  The cinematography (Christopher Doyle, Happy Together)
helps to lend a dark, colorful feel to the film, while long-time
Levinson editor Stu Linder expertly chops up Levinson's gorgeous shots
in all of the right places.</P>
<P>2:07 – R for adult language, mild violence and some sexual references</P>
