<P>"Erin Brockovich," whose nonfictional roots are made markedly clear even 
before the first frame of film, is the sort of vibrantly acted, feel-good 
legal drama that will inevitably leave many viewers enthusiastically raving 
about its qualities while exiting the movie theater. After all, the film 
didn't score a 98 out of 100 on Cinemascore, an almost unheard-of average 
grade from the general public whose seen it, for nothing. Superior to the 
usual movie whose newspaper and television blurbs read such things as, "It 
will make you stand up and cheer!," and absent of the majority of possible 
corniness, and tiresome courtroom scenes, that may very well have seeped into 
the proceedings with a lesser director at the helm, "Erin Brockovich," 
nonetheless, has its own problems.</P>
<P>Directed by Steven Soderbergh, a largely independent filmmaker (1989's 
stirring "sex, lies, and videotape") whose last studio picture was the 
undernourished, overrated 1998 George Clooney-Jennifer Lopez starrer, "Out of 
Sight," his latest excursion into the world of feature films has acquired the 
same sparkling performances that "Out of Sight" possessed, but remains just 
as unsatisfying in the long run. With a plot hook that was almost identically 
seen in 1998's "A Civil Action," yet focuses more on the central character 
than the former did on John Travolta, "Erin Brockovich," for all of its 
attributes, lacks urgency. As the developments in the case (a toxic level of 
chromium is found within the water supply in the small desert town of 
Hinkley, Calif., causing the residents to grow seriously ill) play out in the 
nearly two-and-a-quarter-hour running time, there is a complete insufficiency 
of suspense or rooting interest because it is clear, every step of the way, 
how the plot is going to evolve. </P>
<P>Julia Roberts, Hollywood's most popular leading lady, is unlike many of 
today's top stars because she actually has proven time and time again that 
she is a remarkably good actress. Unfairly labeled a performer who only makes 
romantic comedies, Roberts has made so many pictures in that genre because 
she is simply a charmer, and has the ability to win any viewer over, no 
matter what. That is not all she is about, however, as proven with "Erin 
Brockovich," which hands her one of the most memorable roles of her career, 
and she runs with it. As the self-titled character, a dirt-poor, 
twice-divorced mother of three who cares deeply for her children and 
desperately needs a job to get some cash, Roberts invigorates added life into 
a character that has been so freshly written to begin with. </P>
<P>After an automobile accident that leaves her with a case of whiplash and a 
court loss when her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), fails to convince the 
jury that it was the fault of the other driver, a doctor, Erin, who brashly, 
yet honestly, has a way of telling people like it is, walks right into the 
law firm of Masry and Vitito one day and demands that Ed give her a job. "I'm 
smart, I'm hard-working, I will work without benefits. Please don't make me 
beg," Erin heartfeltly tells him. While filing the real estate paperwork for 
the purchase of homes in Hinkley by PG&E (Pacific Gas and Electric), Erin 
stumbles upon the distressingly bleak medical files of the Hinkley residents 
peculiarly placed with the real estate information. After Ed allows her to 
research the files more, and following her initial meetings with several of 
the townspeople, Erin grows deeply involved in their story, firmly believing 
that they have a case after discovering the chromium within the water. </P>
<P>"Erin Brockovich" may be "based on a true story," but it is the sort of film 
that, if fictional, would be no less predictable. Following an intriguing 
opening half-hour as we meet and get to sympathize with Erin, who may dress 
in revealing clothing and not have a college degree, but who undeniably has 
an intelligent brain in her head and a caring heart in her chest, the film is 
bogged down in a narrative that is about as fresh as a loaf of one-month-old 
bread. Without a quick pace, something that almost any cliched movie needs in 
order to be successful, the film too often just lies there, immobile. Even 
the music score, by Thomas Newman, is basically a carbon copy of the one he 
composed for the infinitely better "American Beauty."</P>
<P>Thank goodness, then, for Roberts and the other top-flight actors, as well as 
some of the snappy dialogue within Susannah Grant's otherwise unworthy 
screenplay. Roberts, a naturally likable screen presence, single-handedly 
steals the film, but is ably supported by Albert Finney, who, with his own 
aptitude for humor and realism, makes a surprisingly great partner for 
Robert. Aaron Eckhart, playing a kind Harley Davidson-loving biker who falls 
for Erin and agrees to watch her kids while at work, tries his mightiest, but 
is so underwritten, and the subplot so shoddily penned, that the film might 
have benefitted from it being either edited out or rewritten. Finally, Marg 
Helgenberger, as the understanding housewife in Hinkley whom Erin first 
meets, is first-rate, and her character warmly and powerfully handled in only 
a few key scenes.</P>
<P>While it may be a wise career move for director Soderbergh to alternate 
between more risky, independent-minded projects and big-budget pictures, with 
"Erin Brockovich," he has made something so conventional and cinematically 
bland that it seems like the perfect example of the type of film Soderbergh 
has so valiantly fought against in the last decade of being a filmmaker.</P>
