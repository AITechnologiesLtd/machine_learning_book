<P>Bound
Chad'z rating: *** (out of 4 = good)
1996, R, 108 minutes [1 hour, 48 minutes]
[crime]
starring: Jennifer Tilly (Violet), Joe Pantoliano (Caeser), Gina Gershon
(Corky), John P. Ryan (Mickey), produced by Stuart Boros, Andrew Lazar,
written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski.</P>
<P>        I think all crime movies have one thing in common: things never go according
to plan. Some crime films use this to create for satire, others use it to
enhance the drama and suspense, but "Bound" is different because it does both
at the same time without contradicting itself.</P>
<P>        The film starts off with a real "crime movie" atmosphere - the type that
could only be created by lovers of the pulp books and cult favorites of the
genre. The setting is present day Chicago where we meet Corky (Gershon), a
lesbian ex-con who is fixing up an empty upscale apartment. When she meets
the next door neighbor Violet (Tilly) there is a clear, but unspoken
attraction between them. It's the kind you'd see in porno movies, so I'm not
sure if it really fits for such a mainstream film and its audience. We get
about 20 minutes of relatively plausible character development and flirting
between Corky and Violet, plus some very erotic sex scenes (at least to a
heterosexual male), but after a while it seems a bit gratuitous. </P>
<P>        Violet's live-in partner, Caeser (Pantoliano), is your standard "Family
Man," especially the way Pantoliano depicts him - Brooklyn accent, curse
words galore, violent mood swings, etc. Caeser has just recovered $2 million
in cash that belongs to "The Business." But Violet doesn't like Caeser much,
so she and Corky hatch a plan to steal the money, frame Caeser, and screw
over the entire mob in the process.</P>
<P>        It's difficult to describe the scheme the women concoct without describing
it in full detail or giving away the entire film. It's not a complicated plan
really, just a clever one and it's interesting to watch how the events unfold
because just when you think everything is going to work out, something
unexpected happens and the characters must think quickly. There are scenes of
razor-sharp suspense, the kind you wouldn't expect in a film like this.</P>
<P>        The actual events themselves are portrayed just as seriously as Scorsese's
"GoodFellas," with lots of detail. But the offbeat dialogue and the specific
elements that move the plot make for a wholly original, yet satirical
atmosphere not unlike Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction." For example, the money
Violet and Corky try to steal from Caeser was originally covered in blood due
to something that could only happen in a crime movie like this. Nevertheless,
Caeser proceeds to wash, dry, and iron every single $100 bill as if they were
his favorite pair of pants.</P>
<P>        There isn't much else to say about "Bound." It's just another crime film at
the core, but it's told in an original, interesting manner and there's
nothing wrong with that.</P>
