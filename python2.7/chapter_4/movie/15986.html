<P>"I can appreciate the theatrical value of several dead kids," muses 
personal injury lawyer Jan Schlictmann (John Travolta) early in the legal 
thriller, "A Civil Action." To its credit, the film, based on Jonathan 
Harr's nonfiction bestseller, carefully avoids exploiting the death of 
those children. In fact, the production successfully navigates around 
most of the rampant emotional manipulation and storytelling clichés that 
fuel so many courtroom dramas. Unfortunately, in their determination to 
recount a complicated series of events accurately and without emotional 
button-pushing, the filmmakers undercut the inherent drama of their own 
story. "A Civil Action" is admirable and quite interesting, but not 
nearly as compelling as it should be.</P>
<P>Set in the '80s in Woburn, Massachusetts, the case revolves around eight 
families who lost children to leukemia. Believing that chemical dumping 
by two local factories tainted the town's water supply and led to the 
deaths, Anne Anderson (Kathleen Quinlan), mother of one of the children, 
approaches Schlichtmann on behalf of the parents. She is adamant that the 
families are not interested in wealth - - they simply want an apology 
from the responsible parties. </P>
<P>With well-rehearsed compassionate tones, Schlichtmann explains that, 
while he feels her pain, his firm is small enough that they cannot afford 
to lose a case. As a courtesy, he makes a cursory investigation of the 
site, only to discover that the factories in question are owned by two 
giant corporations, W.R. Grace & Co. and Beatrice Foods. With dollar 
signs in his eyes, Schlichtmann does an about-face and convinces his 
partners to devote their full resources to the case, leading him to face 
off against William Cheeseman (Bruce Norris), W.R. Grace's self-important,
 boobish head lawyer, and Beatrice attorney Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall),
 a much craftier, formidable foe.</P>
<P>Writer/director Steven Zaillian does a nice job of compressing a very 
complex true story into a manageable package. A series of well-staged 
deposition scenes lay out the particulars of the case, while voice-overs 
and sharp editing effectively detail the legal tactics. Early on, we 
learn that in the world of personal injury law, settling out of court 
means everything. Only 1.5% of the cases ever reach a verdict, and, out 
of those, the result is two to one against the plaintiff. </P>
<P>For the most part, "A Civil Action" minimizes the human factor of the 
tragedy, focusing instead on the high-stakes pissing war between the 
lawyers. Schlichtmann becomes obsessed on extracting as much money from 
the corporations as possible, turning down huge proposed settlements 
because the figures were offered too easily. His primary motive may be 
greed exacerbated by wounded pride, or he might be honestly trying to 
serve the families, recognizing that a soulless corporation understands 
only money, and a severe financial penalty is the closest thing to an 
apology his clients will ever receive.</P>
<P>What's actually going on in Schlichtmann's head is anybody's guess, 
because the film provides scant insight into the man. As always, John 
Travolta is a commanding presence, but he doesn't seem to have a handle 
on the character. One thing is clear - - Schlichtmann's skills do not 
match his zeal. The further he gets into the case, the more clumsy he 
becomes. One of the film's most striking passages shows Facher telling a 
law class about tactical mistakes often made in the courtroom, while the 
camera cuts to images of Schlichtmann making those very errors. </P>
<P>As Facher, the amazing Robert Duvall is ornery and assured, although his 
overabundant display of colorful eccentricities borders on showboating. 
He sticks out even more in comparison to the rest of the central players, 
a numbing group of one-note characters. Only a few supporting cast 
members manage to flesh out their roles. James Gandolfini is excellent as 
a Grace employee giving his deposition under the watchful eyes of the 
corporate attorneys, using subtle changes in expression to efficiently 
convey the sense of a man of conscience who has selected this moment to 
rebel against a lifetime of silent intimidation. </P>
<P>And while Kathleen Quinlan's character serves only as a symbol of 
parental grief, David Thornton does wonders with his few onscreen moments,
 displaying restraint and quiet dignity as he relates his desperate 
failed attempts to revive his son, who stopped breathing during the drive 
to the hospital. There is no bathos in the scene; just unadorned, 
heartbreaking human grief.</P>
<P>A little more humanity would have done wonders for this film. The 
lawyers' posturing, planning and maneuvering is fascinating, but with the 
human factor pushed so far into the background, the production turns into 
a clinical, ultimately anticlimactic exercise. Fair to a fault, "A Civil 
Action" is too civil to leave a lasting impression.</P>
