<P>     The villain of SPECIES -- a new science fiction/action/thriller/
gorefest from director Roger Donaldson -- is a sexy young alien named 
Sil (Natasha Henstridge).  For most of the film, her primary problem is 
a massive case of sexual frustration.  Every time she starts to get 
intimate with a man, there's some sort of interruption -- like 
someone showing up shooting off a gun or threatening to kick in 
the door.  There's only so much of this anyone can take.  No wonder 
she's in a bad mood.  As for the men she chooses... well, let's just say 
that Sil bears a remarkable resemblance to the Praying Mantis. </P>
<P>     Sil's need to mate is fueled by maternal instincts, but it's bad 
news for humanity if she carries a child to term.  Given the fast growth 
cycle of her race, it wouldn't take long before the indigenous 
populations of this planet topped the endangered species list.  Sil is 
actually an alien/human hybrid.  In 1971, Earth sent a message into 
space, hoping for an answer; when, some twenty years later, a response 
arrived that gave a recipe for "enhancing" human DNA, the scientists 
involved in the project didn't know that by acting on it, they were 
possibly engineering their own extinction. </P>
<P>     Now, Sil has escaped her protective cage in Utah and is on her way 
to the City of Angels, where she's likely to blend in with all the other 
weirdos -- at least when she retains her alluring human shape.  Her 
alternative form, a monstrosity straight out of the imagination of ALIEN 
creator H.R. Giger, would likely provoke at least a few stares.  Hot on 
her trail is a small team of specialists put together by government 
scientist Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley):  an empath (Forrest Whitaker) who 
acts like Counselor Troi from STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION; a pair of 
scientists (Alfred Molina and Marg Helgenberger) with all the answers, 
and a hunter (Michael Madsen) whose specialty is killing.  Their job is 
clear:  destroy Sil, regardless of the cost in dollars and lives. </P>
<P>     There are two ways to look at this motion picture.  If you compare 
it to a sci-fi action thriller like ALIENS, it comes up short.  James 
Cameron's picture was masterful at building tension and suspense before 
bringing everything together in a satisfying climax.  SPECIES sticks 
with basic scare tactics -- things jumping out of the shadows to the 
accompaniment of a surge of music.  There are moments of high energy, 
but the pace is basically one of ebb and flow, and there's not much 
atmosphere to speak of. </P>
<P>     On the other hand, as a tongue-in-cheek homage to body snatching 
pictures, it isn't half bad.  As long as you don't stop to think about 
what's going on, SPECIES is capable of offering its share of cheap 
thrills, with a laugh or two thrown in as well.  The plot is patently 
ridiculous, but that's where a temporary suspension of disbelief is 
mandatory.  Don't bring logic into the mix.  As a high-tech, campy 
action movie, this one beats JUDGE DREDD, hands down. </P>
<P>     The characters are all types, but this is intentional.  There's the 
strong, silent Preston, played by a laconic Michael Madsen.  Marg 
Helgenberger is the self-assured woman who falls for him, Alfred Molina 
is the smart guy who strikes out with the women, and Forest Whitaker 
plays a truly annoying psychic who is constantly whining that things 
don't "feel right."  Cast somewhat against type, Ben Kingsley is a 
sleazy scientist with no concept of ethics but a great love of 
procedure.   </P>
<P>     Director Roger Donaldson has a lot of fun with his premise.  The 
top-notch special effects, which use a lot of seamless computer 
animation, make the climax look very nice.  The rest of the film is 
essentially one long chase sequence with a couple of nude scenes and 
maulings added to liven up the proceedings.  No matter what genre you 
identify SPECIES as, it's not top of the line, but there's also quite a 
bit of room beneath it. </P>
