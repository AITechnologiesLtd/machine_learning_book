<PRE>THE CONTENDER (2000) / ***</PRE>
<P>Directed by Rod Lurie, from his screenplay. Starring Joan Allen, Gary
Oldman, Jeff Bridges. Running time: 125 minutes. Rated AA for coarse
language by the MFCB. Reviewed on October 28th, 2000.</P>
<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>One of the most pertinent issues to arise out of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal was the question of what information the public has the right to
know about its elected officials. Some argue that personal dealings
reflect strongly on one's ability to serve their office, while others
maintain that public figures should be evaluated solely on the basis of
public performance.</P>
<P>Given the hot-button nature of the subject, it was inevitable that it
would make the transition to Hollywood and the big screen. The first such
film out of the gate is "The Contender", written and directed by Ron
Lurie. Although it is by no means an exact parallel of the Lewinsky
affair, raising some different concerns and ignoring others (would Clinton
have come under such scrutiny if Lewinsky had not been an intern in his
employ, for example?), "The Contender" follows it in broad strokes by
putting a public official on both public and political trial because of
alleged sexual improprieties in her past.</P>
<P>When his vice-president dies midway through his term of office, United
States President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) finds himself in the
position of having to choose a successor. Jack Hathaway (William L
Petersen) seems the obvious choice, having recently been labelled a hero
by the media for his (failed) effort to save a drowning woman.
Furthermore, Hathaway is a good friend of Evans' Republican nemesis,
Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), who will chair the House committee charged
with approving Evans' choice. But Evans, determined to put a woman into
the second-most powerful position in the government, opts instead for
Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen), a former Republican now sitting for the
Democrats.</P>
<P>But Hanson's candidacy is threatened when Runyon's investigators uncover
photographs and witnesses suggesting that Hanson was at the center of a
sex orgy while still in college. When Runyon confronts Hanson about the
story during her televised hearings, Hanson refuses to confirm or deny its
veracity, averring that it is none of the committee's -- or the public's
-- business. It soon appears that Evans may have no choice but to bow to
Runyon's wishes by dismissing Hanson and appointing a new
vice-presidential candidate.</P>
<P>The first three-quarters of "The Contender" comprises a terrific political
drama. Lurie puts into play several absorbing issues, from the obvious
questions of whether Hanson's past indiscretions should have any bearing
on her becoming vice-president, to the very role of women in politics. 
Although Lurie's Democratic leanings are hard to overlook, he maintains a
reasonably even hand throughout.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, there has been some controversy in the press that Lurie
edited "The Contender" to demonise Oldman's character. This simply is not
borne out by the movie itself. Shelly Runyon is not a nice man, to be sure
-- he is aggressive, manipulative and, it transpires, something of a
hypocrite. But he is also a man with strong principles, and it appears
that, by and large, he does in fact have the interests of the country at
heart, or at least the interests of the way he believes the United States
should be. In these days when there seems to be a perpetual fire sale on
political belief, as elected officials waver back and forth over the
issues for reasons that have nothing to do with their own opinions (if
they even possess them), it is gratifying to encounter a man who is
willing to stick to his views, even if those views are not necessarily
ones we agree with. Oldman's vision of Runyon as the movie's "one true
patriot" is not merely rhetoric.</P>
<P>Oldman paints such a vivid character in Runyon, though, that he largely
overshadows his fellow castmembers. Despite the complexity of the issues
surrounding them, neither Laine Hanson nor Jackson Evans are particularly
well-conceived individuals, and neither Allen nor Bridges succeed in
overcoming this flaw. Indeed, both characters suffer from the fact that
they are defined by the issues, and the issues alone. They do not seem to
exist in any sort of greater context.</P>
<P>We are never really convinced, for example, that Hanson really is suitable
vice-presidential material. We are told she is, but where is the
proof? Laine is on the defensive almost the entire movie, her
characterisation revealed only in the way she reacts to others. Her
moments of strength are reduced to sound bites. The result is that Allen's
performance feels vague and half-formed. It is good on the surface, but
lacks real depth. Bridges, meanwhile, never finds his stride as President
Evans. He is sometimes buffoonish, sometimes deviously intelligent, and
Bridges never manages to merge these aspects into a consistent
portrayal. Instead of appearing multi-faceted, Evans seems to suffer from
split personalities.</P>
<P>This weakness of character is indicative of the real problem with "The
Contender", which becomes plain in its closing moments. This is a movie
which is happy to raise issues, but shies away from making any real
statements about them beyond the very obvious. After an engrossing ninety
minutes of political intrigue, "The Contender" veers suddenly into prosaic
speechifying and, worse, an inappropriate deux ex machina ending which
sorely undercuts the integrity of the film. True, this plot device allows
Lurie to lend a nice sense of closure to the movie. But it is entirely
artificial; it eschews the powerful themes set up earlier in the film in
favour of a tidy ending.</P>
<P>That said, it is difficult to ignore the potency of "The Contender" as a
whole. I have been harsh on the movie, I admit, because I felt the ending
was such a disappointing kowtow to cinematic convention. But even despite
the mediocre characterisation of some of the leads, "The Contender", for
the vast majority of its running time, makes for engrossing viewing. If a
movie like this gives its audience pause to reconsider their own attitudes
toward their political leaders, that can only be a good thing.</P>
