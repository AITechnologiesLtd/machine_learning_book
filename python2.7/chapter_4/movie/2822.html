<PRE>                            WHAT HAPPENED WAS...
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This is a strong two-person play
     filmed for the screen.  Two nervous people have a date
     and the dialog reveals a the inner turmoil in each of
     their lives.  This film has won awards, but it covers
     territory that has been done before.  Rating: high +1
     (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     This is a film that already has rally stripes.  Tom Noonan wrote,
directed and starred in this film which he made for only $300,000 and
took only eleven days to shoot it.  They finished editing the film just
hours short of the deadline for entering it in the Sundance Film
Festival.  But the effort to get the film done in time was repaid.  At
Sundance it won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award and Grand Jury
prize.  Samuel Goldwyn snapped it up for an immediate profit.  Noonan's
face may be familiar to filmgoers for other films in which he has
acted.  He has played psychopathic killers in films like MANHUNTER (the
earlier of the two "Hannibal Lector films") and THE LAST ACTION HERO.
It is good to see him in a more normal role.</P>
<P>     WHAT HAPPENED WAS... is basically a one-act play for two people
produced as a film.  But for a few scenes at the beginning, the film is
all one scene taking place as it happens in front of the camera.  This,
however, is not to imply the film was made in a single take but it does
give the film a certain immediacy.  A woman has invited a co-worker to
her Manhattan apartment for dinner.  Both work in a legal office,
Jackie as a secretary, Michael as a paralegal.  She has been impressed
by his sense of humor and is intrigued by his apparent working on some
secret project of his own.  She has invited him to a candlelight dinner
at her apartment.  The evening begins very awkwardly.  Each has a
talent for choosing just the wrong thing to say to the other.  The date
appears not to be working out at all.  But on and off the wine seems to
be loosening each other up.  They begin trading confidences and
dropping defenses.  Eventually each will know more about the other than
either of them really want.</P>
<P>     Tom Noonan's Michael is controlled and systematic.  Karen Sillas's
Jackie lives with emotional tides that Michael has been able to
suppress in himself.  He is mechanical and she is disturbed.  Noonan's
script gives hints as to how each has gotten that way, but in the end
much is left to conjecture.  Both performances have impressive
authenticity.  My one complaint would be that film is not really the
proper medium for this script.  More appropriate would be the live
stage.  Noonan's direction intentionally makes little use of the
advantages that cinema has over the live stage while it certainly could
benefit from the additional intensity and immediacy that live
performances would have given it.  Making the film more cinematic would
probably have further sacrificed the immediacy.  Noonan at least does
not repeat Hitchcock's error in ROPE of trying to create immediacy by
simulating a single take.  In ROPE Hitchcock apparently realized the
technique became a distraction and he did not repeat his error in DIAL
M FOR MURDER.  Occasionally Noonan misjudges the pacing of his
material, but his direction was usually on-target.</P>
<P>     In spite of the critical acclaim this film is getting, it is not
nearly as original as the rumor mill would have it.  It was reminiscent
of other dramatic works and very similar to a play produced on PBS in
the 60s called, if memory serves, "Birdbath."  While falling short of
my expectations for the film, I would still give it a respectable high
+1 on the -4 to +4 scale.  You won't see much else like it in the
theaters soon.</P>
