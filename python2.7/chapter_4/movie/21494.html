<P>  You don't have to see Eugene O'Neill's "The Iceman
Cometh" to perceive that no one is more fanatical than a
fellow who has just vanquished a bad habit.  Find a person
who has just given up smoking or alcohol or adultery or a life
of crime and you have located a guy who will relentlessly
climb the world's soapboxes to insist that you too can
become as pristine as a newborn pup. Marie Brenner's
investigative article in a "Vanity Fair" magazine article entitled
"The Man Who Knew Too Much" portrays such a man,
Jeffrey Wigand, an ex-smoker who was a top executive with
the tobacco firm of B&W until he had an epiphany.  Tobacco
is not a nice product, he realized some years after the rest of
us knew this, and what's more the executives that make their
living from selling this foul substance have noses longer than
Pinocchio's.  At a congressional hearing one day, all seven
CEO's of the big tobacco corporations stated under oath that-
-get this--nicotine is not addictive.  When B&W's vice
president in charge of scientific research heard that,
something snapped.  Never mind that he was making
$300,000 a year, had quite a nice home, a trophy wife and
two lovely kids.  As a man of science and a man of integrity
he had had enough.</P>
<P>   "The Insider" is the story of this man and of another who
became the most important person in his life.  Done in a
docu-drama style but with a number of highly melodramatic
scenes that give the movie the ambiance of a thriller, Michael
Mann's inspiring tale focuses on scientist and whistle blower
Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) and on an excitable producer
of the famed TV news show, 60 Minutes, Lowell Bergman (Al
Pacino).  Director Mann ("Heat"), together with Eric Roth,
adapted the narrative from an article that appeared in "Vanity
Fair" magazine, "The Man Who Knew Too Much," by Marie
Brenner.  The outrageous lies given to the public by the
tobacco industry as delineated in her text are not surprising
since, after all, big corporations are not run by the likes of
Mother Theresa.  The core of the film, however, is not on
Wigand and his decision to go public against these
prevaricators, but on the sorry actions of CBS.  Motivated by
greed just play gutlessness, the corporate side of the network
AND Mike Wallace himself resolved not to air an interview
which would have exposed the tobacco executives for the
liars they are.</P>
<P>   Director Mann is obviously concerned with a careful
development of the principal characters in his story, so that
while the movie is swiftly paced with some dramatic slo-mo
photography and effective use of hand-held cameras, "The
Insider" clocks in as one of the five longest movies of the
year.  The two hours and thirty-eight minutes are used well. 
Mann divides the story into two chapters: the first focuses on
Jeffrey Wigand, the hero whistleblower, and his struggle with
his conscience; the second part concentrates on the goings-
on within CBS as first the corporate executives and then Mike
Wallace (Christopher Plummer) himself, turn against producer
Bergman and opt to trash the already taped interview with
Wigand.</P>
<P>   In March 1993 Wigand was fired from his $300,000-a-year
job as vice president in charge of research for the B&W
tobacco company.  He had expressed reservations about the
company's policy of using cigarettes as mere delivery devices
for nicotine and for the industry's use of chemicals to
enhance the addictive power of the nicotine.  When Bergman,
a producer on the staff of the TV program 60 Minutes, asks
Wigand simply to explain some scientific jargon in an industry
report, Bergman senses that the chemist knows something
about his company that could be explosive material for the
popular news show.  Since Wigand is contractually bound to
reveal nothing lest he lose his severance package and the
health insurance he needs so badly (his little girl has
asthma), he at first refuses to talk.  But convinced that
Bergman would not abandon him but would allow him to air
his ethical concerns to a worldwide audience, he reluctantly
agrees to be interviewed by Mike Wallace and to testify in a
Mississippi court despite a restraining order slapped on him
by the state of Kentucky.</P>
<P>   If you try to wade through Marie Brenner's report in "Vanity
Fair," you might well throw up your hands when faced with
the complexity of the drama she unfolds.  Hers is a piece of
investigative journalism that goes overboard in detail,
throwing in an enormous cast of characters without sufficient
concern for intelligibility and structure.  But Mann and Roth,
who wrote the screenplay, have shown that film can indeed
be not only an acceptable substitute for the printed page in
getting across facts but a breath of clarifying air that siphons
off the excess verbiage of print text without destroying its
truths.  Who in the audience--smoker and nonsmoker alike--
can walk away from this film without a deeply felt sympathy
for its hero, Jeffrey Wigand?  This soft-spoken scientist who
gave up his wife, his daughters, his comfortable salary, his
spacious home in the service of truth only to be abandoned
as well by the TV people who seduced him, has merited his
place in the pantheon of American idols.  The 35-year-old
Russell Crowe, a charismatic New Zealander, is himself
somewhat of a hero, having gained fifty pounds for the role
and now turns in a more nuanced, more sensitive
performance than he rendered in "L.A. Confidential," "The
Sum of Us," and "The Crossing."  Never raising his voice and
yet communicating his agony by his dropped head, his three-
day growth of beard, his pained expression, Crowe steals
from the show from the more flamboyant Al Pacino who, in
his characteristic way, rants and raves throughout the film to
communicate his own passions.  Who could not feel disgust
for Wigand's wife (played by Diane Venora), a woman who,
like Mike Wallace himself, abandons the man at the very
point that he needs her most?  Liane Wigand, living in luxury
thanks to her husband's income, loses our sympathy by
immediately condemning the man for being fired and is
concerned foremost with the future of their mortgage and
their car payments.  </P>
<P>   How extraordinary that Mann is able to tackle the
intricacies of the plot--the testimony before Mississippi court,
the in-fighting among CBS bigwigs, the domestic dilemma
facing Wigand, the congressional testimony of the so-called 7
dwarfs who blatantly thumb their noses at the American
public with their lies about the poison they dispense.</P>
<P>   We're left hanging in the end, though.  If CBS were fearful
of a huge lawsuit by tobacco that would threaten a favorable
buy-out by the Westinghouse corporation, why do we hear
nothing about such an action after the interview was actually
scheduled?  After all, if the lawsuit did not take place, nothing
was at stake in the first place.  I would be curious to know as
well why Wigand took a job teaching the unusual combination
of chemistry and Japanese in a high school rather than in
college or a graduate institution.  A man with a Ph.D. and a
westerner with fluent Japanese would surely be interested in
a place of higher learning where, in fact, he would not have
to go through the bureaucracy of state licensing required for
teaching in the lower grades.  I'd be curious as well to know
the proportion of heavy smokers who attend the film.  Can
they sympathize with the right people while at the same time
continuing to puff away?  (By the way, this is one of the few
movies I've seen in which no one smokes.)  If so, are they
even angrier than the abstainers with the tobacco people for
getting them hooked, probably when they were under the age
of valid consent?</P>
