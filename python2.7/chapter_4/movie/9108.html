<P>
I've never read Jane Smiley's "A Thousand Acres," nor have I read
Shakespeare's "King Lear," which is what the new movie "A Thousand Acres" is
supposed to be based off of.  After reading the press kit and browsing the
internet for awhile, I knew what the main plot for both of them were supposed
to be: A wealthy, respected man divides his kingdom among his daughters
and they squabble over the land. In the middle of that, there is incest,
division among the family (especially the sisters), and a whole lot of
dying.  </P>
<P>A story like that sounds like it should be entertaining, but the film
version of "A Thousand Acres" is pretty far from entertainment.  It's a lot
like sitting around your house on a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do. 
You turn on the TV and watch without caring if it's good or bad - it's
just on.  That's what "A Thousand Acres" is - it's just on.  It's not at all
good, but then, it's not that bad. You just sit, drifting off into space
asking, "Well, what else am I going to do?"</P>
<P>I liked a few things about the movie: Jessica Lange turns in a good
performance (as always), and the cinematography is beautiful (I wish they would
have shown more of it).  But all of the characters are written and
portrayed as one-dimensional, stereotyped people.  The director, Jocelyn
Moorhouse, doesn't give the audience any sense of who we should like. The movie
is confused, and there is no sense of consistency in the story or with the
characters.         </P>
<P>For example, at the beginning of the movie, I got a real sense that the
daughters truly loved their father, ten minutes later, they profess no
loyalty to him, proclaiming him as the biggest jerk that has ever walked the
land. Why? We're not given a reason. </P>
<P>Then there's Michelle Pfeiffer, who was out of place in this movie.  She
plays an emotionless character in a role that demands emotion.  Jason
Robards, who has won two academy awards in the past, is reduced to grunting
out a stereotyped performance.  "I'm an old man! And things just aren't as
good as they used to be!"  </P>
<P>Of course, all the men in the film have to be villains.  There's a scene
in a Thousand Acres where Jessica Lange starts an affair with Jess (played
by Colin Firth). During the scene, the director wants us to be happy that
Lange is having this affair; as they kiss, sweet, romantic music starts
up and the photography gives us a sense of joy and passion.  But, there was
no reason for our sympathies to be with her.  Her husband (played by
Keith Carradine) didn't seem to be a bad guy - certainly not bad enough so
that she had to go out and have an affair on him.  </P>
<P>What's most disappointing about the movie is that you're left with
nothing afterwards.  A friend remarked, "For a movie that's supposed to make you
feel something, bring out emotions in you and make you feel sad, it just
didn't."  I think that sums it up - it's not that it was an awful movie,
it's just that it didn't make you feel anything.  Watching something like
that is always a let down. </P>
<P>If you're in the mood to watch a good movie about the trials and
successes of Midwestern farmers, I highly recommend "Troublesome Creek: A
Midwestern", which is out on video right now. 
"A Thousand Acres"  (* and a half out of four).  Directed by Jocelyn
Moorhouse.  Starring Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfieffer, Jennifer Jason Lee, and
Jason Robards.  </P>
