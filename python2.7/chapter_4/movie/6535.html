<PRE>                             MY FELLOW AMERICANS
                       A film review by Michael Redman
                        Copyright 1996 Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>After watching this film, I can't get the phrase "The Odd Grumpier Old
Presidential Couple" out of my head. Jack Lemon and James Garner make an
engaging pair in this latest incarnation of quarreling buddies on the
run films. =</P>
<P>The film features more US presidents than you can shake a stick at.
Garner is former Democratic president Matt Douglas, a charming ladies
man who desperately wants another run at the office. Lemon plays former
Republican president Russell Kramer who keeps in the public eye by
writing cookbooks  and making appearances at the drop of a hat. Their
nemesis is current president and Kramer=92s former VP William Haney (Dan
Aykroyd). Haney's second in command and presidential heir apparent Ted
Matthews (John Heard) is a dim bulb that you know couldn't spell potato.</P>
<P>Douglas is promised his party's backing if he can get the goods on a
kickback charge against Kramer. He's disappointed when it turns out that
Kramer is being set up by Haney and then investigation takes a nasty
turn when government agents kill his only witness. =</P>
<P>Their luck deteriorates when the helicopter in which the former chief
executives are traveling explodes out of the sky. Lost in the wilds of
North Carolina, the two are hiding out from the killer G-men as they try
to prove their case.</P>
<P>There aren't many better actors around than Lemon and about the only
more likable screen presence in existence than Garner is Wilfred Brimley
(who has a small part as Demo party chairman). When the two are on the
screen together the movie sings. But when anyone else intrudes into the
scenes, the song turns sour.</P>
<P>Although the film pokes fun at both parties, what passes for political
satire is far too mild. The possibilities are passed by. Especially
tedious is an extended episode where they are given a ride by "ordinary
Americans" who proceed to demonstrate how out of touch politicians are
with the people. Heavy hitting stuff here.</P>
<P>The two hitch a ride on a train full of sports fans which is as
unhumorous as it sounds. Of course there's the obligatory car chase as
they bang into things and knock down even bigger things. All road films
lend themselves to short episodes in various locales. Here they go from
bad to worse.</P>
<P>As good as Lemon and Garner are together, Aykroyd is a stiff. His career
was on fire during his stints at "Saturday Night Live" and as a Blues
Brother, but recently his movie roles have lacked any life. Almost
anyone could have been casted here and been better.</P>
<P>The two stars demonstrate some chemistry together and do the best they
can with a script that could have used some extensive work. This is a
prime example that there are some works of literature so lame that
nothing can make them shine.</P>
