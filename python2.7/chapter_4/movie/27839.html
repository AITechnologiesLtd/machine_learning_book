<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Zhang Yang's bittersweet dramatic comedy, "Shower," is meant to be a
crowd pleaser. Its manipulative and sugary story is set in modern
Beijing. When Da Ming (Pu Cun Xin) received a postcard from his retarded
younger brother Er Ming (Jiang Wu) of a picture of his elderly father
lying on his bed, he assumed that his father passed away and decided to
leave his business duties in southern China's region of Shenzhen to see
for himself. Why he didn't phone is a mystery to me, since he doesn't
seem to go anywhere without his cell phone. The only reason I can think
of him making the journey home, is that since he had no contact with his
father, Master Li (Zhu Xu), for a long period of time, maybe he thought
he would use this as an excuse to see how everything is going at home.</P>
<P>Before he visits his father, he takes an ultra-modern shower, one which
squirts water at him from all directions, like in a car wash. When he
enters his father's bathhouse, he enters an old-fashioned world, one in
which he doesn't care for. When he's spotted, he's warmly greeted by Er
Ming. But his father greets him apprehensively, wondering why he came.
Master Li has run a popular bathhouse in the old part of town for a
longtime and Er Ming is happy being his assistant, happiest when
greeting the customers at the front desk. Da Ming could never see
himself fitting into this lifestyle and left his widowed father to
achieve material success and a new life far away from him. When he takes
a long look at the place he can't forget, all those memories come
flashing back to him, and he decides to stay for the evening and return
to his wife the next day. The conversation between the two is guarded,
as the only penetrating question the father asks is, Are the noodles as
good in the south?</P>
<P>For Master Li, the place is not just a bathhouse where his customers get
a massage and a shave, and sit in the warm steam bath pools slowly
passing the time conversing and laughing, getting things off their chest
while they are in a relaxed state of mind, but is a magical place where
the old man knows he's really good at what he does and feels proud that
he could serve his community in this manner. It is his whole life. He
also has a great love for Er Ming, taking special care of the childlike
adult and playing childish games with him, like racing around the block
and having matches to see who can hold his breath the longest
underwater, while Er Ming reciprocates this love like a dog does to his
master.</P>
<P>The steambath customers are a varied lot of mostly lovable characters,
ranging from the elderly to an overweight teenage boy who wants to sing
"O Sole Mio" at a neighborhood cultural event, but freezes in public and
can only sing in the shower. There is a man who raises crickets and
arranges for bets on cricket fights at the bathhouse. Another man has
big business plans but none of them turn out right, as creditors come
into the bathhouse to collect from him. One of Master Li's better
customers is having problems staying home as his irate wife is beating
and nagging him, and in a moment of complete trust he tells the Master
it is because I have become impotent. Master Li has time to listen to
all these problems and give them his proper attention, as he is
everything to his customers, from physical therapist-to sexual
therapist-to sage.</P>
<P>The film's more serious message, is of the family's estranged
relationship.The story also looks into the family's roots in northern
China, seen through flashbacks the father has, where water was scarce
and was viewed as the most precious resource there is, a healer of all
life's ills. The film also questions the modern world and its constant
strivings for progress, which result in ripping up traditional
neighborhoods and families.</P>
<P>As tragedy suddenly hits home for the serious-minded son, he is now
viewed as someone who in his short stay has begun to absorb his father's
kindly wisdom for the first time and recognizes the need for a family to
be held together by love. There is a real change that has happened to
him inside, as he begins to look at what values things really have
instead of looking at things only as a materialist.</P>
<P>Director Zhang Yang has created a graceful, masculine film (all the main
characters are male and the story is told from their view), avoiding for
the most part the sentimentality that could have sunk the film, if
handled by a lesser director.</P>
<P>This mainstream, middle-brow, foreign film was the winner of audience
awards at festivals at Rotterdam and all over Europe and Asia, which
means it clicked with varous audiences because of its universal appeal.
Though, I thought, to make his point about the old and new China, he
pulled out too many old contrived tricks out of the hat, from the
bathhouse being torn down and replaced by a shopping mall, to a retarded
brother stealing the film with his comical and good-natured appeal. Yet
what I found to be outright fascinating, was the strong relationship
between the wonderfully benevolent Zhu Xu (The King of Masks), an actor
who has a certain magical screen presence, and the gifted actor who
played his retarded son, Jiang Wu, and the equally gifted actor Pu Cun
Xin who as the older son, was used by the director to signify how well
the transition was going in China from the old to the new. But what
interested me most about Shower, is that it gave me a chance to observe
everyday life in a country that has been closed to the West, and the
film has done it in a most endearing way. Other than that, I still found
the story too sweet for my taste.</P>
