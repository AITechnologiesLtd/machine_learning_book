<PRE>                         MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                       A film review by Cat Stanton
                        Copyright 1997 Cat Stanton</PRE>
<P>P.J. Hogan, the director of MURIEL'S WEDDING, gives us yet another
forced and somewhat embarrassing flick, but this time it has some big
names behind it.  MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is definitely a top
contender for the Puff Pastry award of summer movies.</P>
<P>This movie would have been much more enjoyable without all of the
bad, painfully staged singing numbers the audience is forced to
endure from the opening credits to the ending scene.  I've never
almost walked out on a movie before the opening credits stopped 
rolling, but because of a strong aversion to Pepto Bismol pink
sets and bad lip-synching, I nearly did in this movie.  I'm glad I
stayed. Well, sort of.</P>
<P>>From the nonsensical opening number, the movie jarringly cuts to
the chase, setting up the premise for the entire story with only
a dozen sentences.  Don't get in line for popcorn early, lest you
miss the whole background story.  But don't be fooled by the quick
setup, the movie comes to a standstill... right about the time you
get to the karaoke bar scene.</P>
<P>The premise is simple.  Julianne (Julia Roberts) is the slim
size 6 food critic.  How does she stay size six?  Well apparently
she does so by taking a single bite of her meal, reciting two words
to the server about what she's going to say about it in her write
up, and then recounting her neuroses to her editor instead of eating
the rest of her dinner.  Her career is merely a convenient set up
and isn't very believable.  Switch her creme brulee/jell-o metaphor
towards the end of the movie for Fifi the pedigreed poodle and
Benji the lovable mutt, and she could have been a dog trainer.</P>
<P>But I digress.  Julianne the food critic has spent the last nine
years in troublesome relationships after breaking up with Michael
(Dermot Mulroney), who has become her best friend since their
romance.  Long ago in Arizona they made a pact that they would
marry each other if they were still alone at 28.  When Michael
calls her, she's certain he wants to marry her finally, right up
until she finds out he's going to marry another woman in four days.</P>
<P>Julianne drops everything, flies to Chicago, and hilarity ensues.
Well, that's what we'd hoped for.  More accurately, a mild undercurrent
of amusement peppered with some painfully embarrassing scenes
ensues.</P>
<P>In Chicago, we meet Michael's fiancee Kimmy (Cameron Diaz).  Kimmy
is "annoyingly perfect" (as Julianne often says in the film).  In
short, Kimmy is an astonishingly beautiful, although sometimes
slightly psychotic looking, rich doormat with bad driving habits.</P>
<P>>From the start, Julianne sets out to destroy the relationship.  In
doing so, however, I found her character became confused and muddled.
She wasn't exactly likeable, yet she wasn't the woman you'd love
to hate either.  She was the most ineffectual protagonist I've seen
in a long time. She didn't seem to have any chemistry with Michael
either, so I wasn't really rooting for her cause.</P>
<P>In one telltale scene, she tries to convince Kimmy that Michael's
job isn't what's best for the marriage, since it requires he move
around constantly and Kimmy will have to give up a college degree and
a stable career to follow him.  She was all but telling Kimmy flat
out, "Hey you shouldn't cater to his every whim, have him think of
your life once in awhile" but when Kimmy politely brought up having
him work for her father, his outburst was immediate and hurtful.</P>
<P>Michael's character was lukewarm and Mulroney's scenes consisted
mostly of dumb stares with his mouth half open.  Admittedly, these
were usually during the singing portions of the movie, where most of us
were staring dumbfounded at the screen waiting for the plot to
start back up.  But how can you care who gets the guy when in fact,
you're hoping neither of them ends up with a loser like him?  A
love triangle does not work when the crux of the triangle is dull
and unlikeable.</P>
<P>There were some bright spots in this film, believe it or not.
First and foremost, we got to see another side to Julia Roberts.
She does an excellent job inserting physical humor into the story
as the slightly klutzy Julianne.  Her timing really hit the mark
and her best chemistry was with the gay character in the film, her
"local" best friend and editor, George (Rupert Everett).</P>
<P>George was my favorite character, by far.  It's a shame he shows
up all too rarely in the film.  Sympathetic, classy and honest, he
actually upstaged most of the top-billed actors.  His friendship
with Julianne is evident and the only believable relationship in
the movie.  Everett did an excellent job with his script and
mannerisms.</P>
<P>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING has a lot more misses than hits, and while
it was labelled a "chick flick" by my boyfriend, I found it quite
painful and dull to watch myself.</P>
