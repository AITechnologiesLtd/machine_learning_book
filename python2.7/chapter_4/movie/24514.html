<PRE>BY EDWIN JAHIEL</PRE>
<P>NOT ONE LESS ( Yi ge dou bu neng  shao) ( China, 1999) *** Directed 
by Zhang Yimou. Written  by Shi Xiangsheng, from his novel. 
Photography, Hou Yong. Editing, Zhai Ru. Art director, Cao Jiuping.
Music, San Bao. Cast: Wei Minzhi (Herself), Zhang Huike (Himself), 
Tian Zhenda (Mayor Tian), Gao Enman (Teacher Gao), Sun Zhimei (Sun 
Zhimei), Feng Yuying (Television Station Receptionist), Li Fanfan 
(Television Host). Produced by Zhao Yu. A Sony Pictures Classics 
release. In Mandarin (with English subtitles).  106 minutes.</P>
<P>The American director Joseph Von Sternberg (1894-1969) comes to mind 
as I think of the Chinese director Zhang Yimou (b.1951). Sternberg 
"created" Marlene Dietrich in the "Blue Angel" and six additional 
films (1930-35), the high point of his career. Their relationship 
went beyond cinema. Zhang Yimou's feature debut "Red Sorghum"  was 
also that of actress Gong Li. The two were an "item" for about 8 
years as he directed her in the highly successful, "Ju Dou," " Raise 
the Red Lantern,"
"The Story of Qiu Ju," and "To Live" for a total of 7, including the 
unfamiliar (to me) "Codename Cougar." Their last collaboration, 
"ShanghaiTriad" (Yao a yao yao dao wai pei qiao) had mixed reviews. 
Zhang-ites hope that now Pygmalion minus Galatea will not, as in 
Sternberg's case, result in declining popularity.</P>
<P>"Not One Less" may put those fears to rest, although Zhang changed 
style and content so radically that comparisons are not valid. His 
early career was as a cinematographer. All his films until now have 
powerful, creative visuals. But  here, the customary, delicate 
bravura (not an oxymoron) of  often saturated colors, their 
orchestrated, eye-arresting scenes, give way  to utter simplicity. 
Made almost like a documentary, the pictures is  a cousin of 
cinema-verite and Italian neorealism.</P>
<P>The village of Shuiquan seems to be in the middle of nowhere, but as 
it turns out, is 3-4 hours by bus from Beijing. What makes one think 
"boondocks," is generalized poverty and the fact that we see very 
little of the place. The images are predominantly of a run-down, 
one-classroom, one-teacher schoolhouse and of dusty dirt roads around 
it.</P>
<P>Teacher Gao is leaving for a month to attend his ailing mother. Wei, 
age 13, an elementary school graduate, has been hired as substitute 
teacher. She's not much older than her pupils. And she does not know 
much more than they do. The idea is to band-aid the emergency.. Wei 
will receive 50 yuan at some point (which keeps eluding her) for a 
month's work. It's essentially a kind of baby-sitting, just keep the 
kids in class.</P>
<P>According to today's exchange rates, one yuan equals 12 US cents. At 
the village, once can of Coca-Cola is either one or two yuans. Wei's 
50 yuans come to $6.</P>
<P>Given the dire shape of the place, students who need to work for 
their families or elsewhere drop school alarmingly fast --from 40 to 
28 since the school year began. This menaces the subsidies to the 
school (such as they are!). Teacher Gao warns Wei to hold the line. 
He sweetens this by promising a bonus (10 yuan) if all 28 kids 
remain. "Not One Less!"</P>
<P>The conditions at the school, and, surely, in the village, are 
dismal. Wei and some kids (who is not clear) sleep in a horrid room. 
Where their food comes from is also unclear. Chalk is rationed: one 
per day. When some chalk trampled on , it is a catastrophe. There are 
no books. Wei copies the lessons on the blackboard. She admonishes a 
child  not to write too large or press too much since it uses up too 
much chalk.</P>
<P>In Part Two of the film, a 10-year old boy, Zhang Huike, smart, 
lively and prone to trouble-making (pitifully mild by American 
standards) stops coming to school. His widowed mother is in debt. 
Zhang went to the big, unnamed city to find work. Through 
brick-moving the class collects   minuscule sum for Wei to go to the 
city and search for the boy. It is unclear whether she does it to 
keep the students at the 28 level, or to get her bonus --For a Few 
Yuan More.</P>
<P>Her small adventures follow, there is a rather unlikely happy ending. 
As Wei reaches the end of her rope, she is told to take her case to 
almighty TV. The stumbling block is an autocratic, 
bureaucratic-to-the-letter receptionist. But a manager ex machina 
saves the day. Wei goes on a telecast, with a typically chatty, 
elegant anchorwoman. The newness of it all literally dumbfounds Wei. 
She freezes, says nothing.</P>
<P>The boy is found, he returns to the village with Wei and a camera 
crew. But TV micro-celebrity and a gift of tons of chalks solve 
nothing. End-titles tell us that a million children a year drop 
school for work. It's a false figure. Reality is ten times higher. 
But since this is a criticism of China's system, and since director 
Zhang Yimou has often had troubles with the government and censors, 
he lowered the figure to what authorities would deem acceptable.</P>
<P>In Italian neorealism the movies did not hesitate to show or denounce 
evils by individuals as well as the state. Matters are much more 
careful and balanced here, a bit as in old Soviet movies. The TV 
station bureaucrat receptionist is scolded, and it another bureaucrat 
who is helpful. The kindness of strangers gets some credit as a 
restaurant helps hungry Zhan, although this is done primarily to 
avoid his bothering the customers. You may glimpse a chic woman or 
two but contrasts are kept down. No discotheques, no pricey stores. 
You sense the movie's political prudence.</P>
<P>What's new and interesting is that almost all the characters are 
non-actors who use their real names ands who do in real life what 
they do on the screen --starting with Wei who was chosen from an 
enormous field of candidates. What is most successful is how well, 
starting again with Wei, all those non-professionals fit their roles 
and situations. Were that the movie could give a big boost to the 
casting of amateurs. If this escalates the multi-million-dollar 
salaries of stars could go the way of the walls of Jericho. Fat 
chance.</P>
