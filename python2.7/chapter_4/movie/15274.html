<P>When you see "The End" appear onscreen at the conclusion of "A Bug's Life,
" stay in your seat, because the show isn't over quite yet. The 
filmmakers have added a very clever little treat to the closing credits. 
The rollicking "A Bug's Life" is that kind of movie; so bright, clever 
and eager to please that it does everything but walk you out to your car. 
The computer-animated feature, from the makers of "Toy Story," deftly 
combines comedy, action and razzle-dazzle visuals to produce 94 minutes 
of pure fun.</P>
<P>Flik ("NewsRadio's" Dave Foley, in a spirited performance) is an ant with 
a vision. Eschewing the conformity of the colony, he works on various 
inventions, even as his colleagues roll their eyes at his fanciful 
notions. They're far more concerned with collecting food for the seasonal 
payoff to the grasshoppers; thugs who threaten violence if the ants fail 
to present a sufficient "offering." When Flik accidentally knocks over 
the bounty, invader boss Hopper (Kevin Spacey) delivers a blistering 
edict: if the ants don't collect a double-offering, the grasshoppers will 
wipe out the entire colony. </P>
<P>Anxious to atone, Flik sets out, in "Seven Samurai" fashion, to gather a 
group of warrior insects to protect the community. He finds what appears 
to be a formidable assemblage of bugs and convinces them to accompany him 
home. Unfortunately, there's been a major miscommunication: the 
"warriors" are in fact a hapless band of circus insects who believe they 
have been hired to put on a show. When the truth comes out, things look 
disastrous for the colony, but wait... Flik has another plan!</P>
<P>"A Bug's Life" earns bonus points for its knock-out supporting characters.
 While the early portion of the film is charming and visually stunning, 
things really don't kick into high gear until the wonderfully eccentric 
members of P.T. Flea's Circus make their appearance. The ants are a sweet,
 but bland, bunch, with only Flik, the Queen (Phyllis Diller), Princess 
Atta (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and young Dot (Hayden Panettiere) really 
displaying any individual sparks. Even they pale in comparison with the 
motley band of circus insects. The group includes a glamorous spider 
(Bonnie Hunt), Hungarian acrobat bugs Tuck and Roll (Michael McShane), a 
grumpy, misunderstood ladybug (Denis Leary) and prickly walking-stick 
insect Slim (a hilarious David Hyde-Pierce). </P>
<P>Best of all is Manny, an aging, narcissistic praying mantis with regal 
pretensions, played to perfection by Jonathan Harris. When Harris, the 
villainous Dr. Smith from the old "Lost In Space" TV series, was offered 
a cameo in this year's big-screen adaptation of the show, he turned it 
down, sniffing "I don't do bit parts." At the time, I dismissed his words 
as mere prattling from a egocentric has-been. Who knew that the old ham 
had a gig this good up his sleeve?</P>
<P>Without minimizing the pleasures of the similarly-themed "Antz," "A Bug's 
Life" is a much more satisfying film. The production mixes radiant colors,
 a score that echoes epic westerns, and extraordinary imagination in 
creating its miniature landscapes. A visit to an insect city is 
wonderfully realized, with discarded food containers from the human world 
serving as buildings (and, in marked contrast to "Antz," there is nary a 
product placement in sight). Following a riotous circus performance, we 
get a tour of Bugville, complete with a beggar insect sitting on the 
sidewalk with a sign reading "Kid pulled off wings."</P>
<P>The visuals from the computer graphic wizards at Pixar are nothing less 
than breathtaking. A scene depicting Flik taking flight, parasailing on a 
single sprig of a dandelion blossom, is both lyrical and stunning. The 
detail work in the shot shows just how far computer graphics have come in 
the three short years since "Toy Story."</P>
<P>Of course, an adventure film can't succeed without a good villain, and 
Kevin Spacey does terrific work as Hopper, malevolent leader of the 
menacing grasshoppers, playing the character like a swaggering biker from 
"The Wild Ones." Listen closely as the grasshoppers prepare to take off 
and you'll notice that the audio effect boys incorporate the sounds of 
motorcycles revving up into the background noise. Nice touch.</P>
<P>"A Bug's Life" isn't perfect. The secondary ants are unnecessarily bland 
and some of the action scenes are too boisterous for their own good, but 
these are small quibbles. Warm, funny and thrilling, "A Bug's Life" 
represents a powerful stride for computer animated films, as well as yet 
another triumph for the alliance between Disney and Pixar Studios. Get 
ready for one of the best films of the year and don't forget to stay for 
the closing credits.  </P>
<P>Incidentally, "A Bug's Life" is preceded by "Geri's Game," a delightful 
Pixar comic short about an elderly gent's tricks during a chess game in 
the park. Sunny, ingenious and very funny, the feature showcases the best 
computer rendering of the human form to date.</P>
