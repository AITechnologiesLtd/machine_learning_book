<PRE>Waking Ned Devine</PRE>
<PRE>[2.5/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Tullymore is a quiet little Irish country village. When two old friends,
Jackie and Michael, discover that the latest lottery was won by one of the
village's residents, they hatch a plan to find out who the winner is (which
should not be hard since they know everyone in town), befriend them, and
share in the winnings. Then they discover that the winner was kind old Ned
Devine, who had immediately died upon the shock of his win. Since Ned has no
family, his winning would be going back to the lottery, so Jackie and
Michael decide it would be best if someone else pretended to be Ned, claimed
the prize, and shared the winnings. It will not be easy since they will need
the cooperation of the whole village and not all may go along.</P>
<P>Like most of the characters in it, this film is quite cute. It presents the
Irish coastal countryside as almost a character by itself, with beauty and
charm. The rough cliffs, lush woods, and enchanting streams reflect a
simplicity and purity to the slow, rustic life. However, many of the
characters presented were not given much depth, and the subplots of the pig
farmer's romance with a single mother, and the small boy who seems wiser
than the substitute priest seemed extraneous. There is a similarity in the
narrative to A Simple Plan, but this film has an altogether different tone
than that one. The need to neatly wrap up the subplots at the close of the
main narrative felt jarring in its superfluousness. The film has a pleasant
lightness of tone and provides a good share of well-paced laughs, and the
cuteness of its main characters (particularly Michael) is quite endearing.
The storyline closes at what would appear to be the beginning point of the
more interesting story, but it goes far enough as a showcase of the charm of
rural Ireland.</P>
<P>Moderately Recommended. This film does not contain anything exceptional, but
is certainly charming and enjoyable. It does not strive to do very much, but
does accomplish what it sets out to do.</P>
