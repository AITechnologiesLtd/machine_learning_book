<PRE>                                    FEARLESS
                       A film review by David Wong Shee
                        Copyright 1994 David Wong Shee</PRE>
<P>CREDITS  
Director: Peter Weir (PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, GREENCARD)
Screenwriter: Rafael Yglesias (author of the novel).
Composer: Maurice Jarre.
Actors: Jeff Bridges (THE FISHER KING), Rosie Perez, Isabella Rossellini,
        John Turturro (BARTON FINK), Tom Hulce.</P>
<PRE>SYNOPSIS  </PRE>
<P>     A domestic American airliner crash lands after a complete
hydraulic failure.  Most of the passengers and crew are killed but
miraculously about a score of people survive.  One of them is Max (Jeff
Bridges) who experiences the complete disappearance of fear several
minutes before the crash.  Following his survival he is filled with
messianic feelings of exaltation and invulnerability.  These are
further reinforced by the fact that many of the other survivors
attribute their survival to him, and he is acclaimed as a hero in the
popular media.  He returns home to his wife and son changed in some
profound but incommunicable way.  This produces enormous strain on his
relationship with his family which is compounded by a special bond he
develops with another survivor, Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), who is
stricken by the loss her infant son in the accident.  The story follows
his journey back to the world of ordinary mortals.</P>
<PRE>COMMENTS  </PRE>
<P>     I am not sure whether this is a film to be assiduously avoided by
those phobic about air travel, or paradoxically whether it is an ideal
thriller for such people.  There is no accounting for taste, I guess.</P>
<P>     From a psychological point of view Max seems to enter an altered
state of consciousness in the face of extreme stress.  The examples of
traumatic bereavement and cathartic resolution were, I thought, well
executed being both convincing and affecting.  The portrayal of the
psychiatrist Dr Perlman (John Turturro) employed by the airline to
assist the survivors was also a balanced and overall sympathetic one.
At one point Max clips the Dr Perlman across the chin in retaliation
for an invasion of his personal space.</P>
<P>     As a follow-on to this, I spent the rest of the film hoping he
would punch the lawyer, Brillstein (Tom Hulce) who admirably filled the
role of the villain of the piece.  Brillstein was one of those lawyers
who display the phenomenal proclivity of American's for litigation in
its worst possible light.  He pressures the potential litigants to
perjure themselves for financial gain out of some sense of entitlement
and blame on someone else for tragic misfortune.  It is fortunate, or
perhaps unfortunate, depending upon your outlook, that God cannot be
sued for such things.</P>
<P>     From a spiritual perspective there are certainly mystical aspects
to the film.  As in Weir's earlier PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, disaster is
accompanied by some unaccountable event.  In PICNIC there is the eerie
unexplained disappearance of several schoolgirls, while in FEARLESS,
Max undergoes some strange transformation at, or near the point of
death.  He has a "near near death" experience, so to speak.  These
mystical elements are effectively enhanced by Maurice Jarre's
soundtrack which fosters a transcendent atmosphere throughout.</P>
<PRE>     Peter Weir has definitely not lost his touch.</PRE>
