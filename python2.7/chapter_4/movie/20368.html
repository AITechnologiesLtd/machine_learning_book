<P>Ever hear ssomeone tell supposedly amusing tales of their childhood and
adolescence that seem only to hold the slightest bit of interest to the
person telling the story?  That's the sense I felt while watching
_Outside_Providence_, based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Peter
Farrelly.  Yes, that's Peter as in Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the warped
minds behind the likes of _Kingpin_ and _There's_Something_About_Mary_. 
But anyone looking for their brand of grossout humor will be disappointed
by the wistful _Providence_, scripted by the brothers and director
Michael Corrente.  Then again, anything looking for humor, period, will
be disappointed, for the film is strangely devoid of laughs.</P>
<P>_Providence_ is set in 1974, when teen Tim Dunphy's (Shawn Hatosy)
aimless, pot-fueled antics leads his father (Alec Baldwin) to ship him
from their home of Pawtucket, New Jersey, to Cornwall Academy, a stuffy
prep school in Connecticut.  A fish-out-of-water scenario where all
manner of hilarity should ensue, but what unfolds is bizarrely lifeless
and often simply boring, with Tim regularly running afoul of an uptight
headmaster (Tim Crowe) when not running after Jane (Amy Smart), a
fetching student at the girls' school.  Every so often Corrente cuts to a
scene back in Pawtucket, usually with Old Man Dunphy playing poker with
pals.  It's as exciting as it sounds.</P>
<P>The actors playing the only two recognizable characters are the only
thing that holds interest in the film, aside from Corrente's keen eye for
period detail.  Baldwin does an admirable job of disappearing into his
character, obviously wearing a few (to say the least) more pounds than
usual and speaking in a very convincing Jersey accent.  But there's more
to his performance than a mere physical transformation; Baldwin infuses
the macho blowhard with a palpable warmth.  Not as showy is the work of
Hatosy, who has a natural, understated ease about him that makes slacker
Tim more likable than he otherwise would be (as played by another actor,
he probably wouldn't be at all).</P>
<P>A more compelling semi-autobiographical tale of adolescence can be found
in _West_Beirut_, written and directed by Ziad Doueiri.  The film indeed
is set in Lebanon in the late '70s to early '80s, when civil war divided
the country and split the city of Beirut into a Christian-run East and a
Muslim-run West; against this backdrop, we see the development of young
Tarek (Rami Doueiri), Omar (Mohamad Chamas), and their Christian friend
May (Rola Al Amin), as well as the effects the unrest has on Tarek's
parents (Carmen Lebbos and Joseph Bou Nassar).  Despite more than a few
serious turns of events, there are plenty of moments of humor as the
teens simply go about their business of having fun, learning about life,
and growing up as any others would in any corner of the globe.  Paying no
mind to the setting and situational differences, _West_Beirut_ is more
effective a film semi-memoir than _Outside_Providence_ for one simple
reason--it actually feels like a story worth telling.</P>
