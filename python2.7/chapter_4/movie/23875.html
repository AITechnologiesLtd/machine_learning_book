<PRE>Night Moves (1975)
Rating: 2.5 stars out of 5.0 stars</PRE>
<P>Cast: Gene Hackman, Susan Clark, Jennifer Warren, Harris Yulin, Kenneth
Mars, James Woods, Melanie Griffith, Dennis Dugan 
Written by: Alan Sharp

Running Time: 75 minutes </P>
<P>Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) is an ex-football star turned private
detective.  After taking a case to find the daughter of a former
actress, he learns that his wife (Susan Clark) is having an affair, and
the film then tries (slightly unsuccessfully) to juggle both
storylines.  Unfortunately, the film derails midway through and has a
difficult time getting back on track.  Things do come together well at
the end, but becomes taxing getting to that point.  </P>
<P>The title seems to be a reference to chess, as Harry discusses several
"knight moves" while reenacting a famous chess match from years past. 
However, since this film is called "Night Moves" and not "Knight Moves"
then the title seems to denote some sort of double meaning.  Much of the
movie does take place at night however, so maybe that's what it's
referring to.  Aside from all that, the film is most notable for the
debut of Melanie Griffith, who plays the subject of Hackman's
investigation. </P>
<P>I'd like to include some information directly from the film's original
VHS release box because I doubt it'll ever be seen again.  It's one of
those very old Warner clamshell boxes that has a lot of text on the back
of it pertaining to the film (two or three times that of one of today's
releases would have).  There's a quote from an interview with Gene
Hackman that states "Arthur Penn is a great director because he sees the
special human moment in a scene, outside the dialogue, outside the
scenery; he sees the human animal, he sees the life of the scene.  He's
especially good with people who have never made a picture before.  Both
Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Warren are making their first film with
him and he is really turning them on to the way film works."  The box
later states that "Harry isn't stupid - he's just a little slow". 
That's a odd statement to make, since it's not as if all this
information is presented to Harry and he just doesn't catch on.  He
catches on whenever any information is given to him.  [R]</P>
