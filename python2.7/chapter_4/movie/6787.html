<PRE>                        JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Heavy on action, light on thought,
          this is a film that easily matches the stunts of a
          James Bond film but delivers little else.  The plot
          is mostly an excuse for action scenes and is a
          contrivance to which the script gives only cursory
          attention.  Chan has the personality to make much
          more engaging films.  Still, only he can do stunts
          like this without a stand-in.  Rating: high 0 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The Hong-Kong-based Jackie Chan has been making a rather free-form
series of crime films which are best known as his POLICE STORY films.
Depending on how you count them, FIRST STRIKE is either the fourth or
fifth film in this series.  It is probably the fourth, but another
film, PROJECT S, was released as if it were part of the POLICE STORY
series and called by alternate titles that include POLICE STORY 4 and
SUPERCOP 2.  That almost makes sense because SUPERCOP was an alternate
title of POLICE STORY 3. In general, the more titles a film can be
given the more people who will see it a second time not realizing they
have seen it before.  In any case, this time around Chan is departing
from the police motif and making a sort of poor man's James Bond film.
And he has the action scenes down pretty well.  In fact, his film has
better stunts than most Bond films.  The only problem is that at a time
when the James Bond plots are deteriorating, they are still better and
much more complex than a Chan plot.  Chan's film is little more than an
excuse to string together a series of admittedly pretty exciting action
scenes.  One has the distinct feeling that the stunts are planned
first, then a plot is written to connect the stunts.  Not that Chan is
not a wonder to watch.  When Chan gets going he is a marvel of grace
and at times his stunts are difficult to believe.  But while this film
tries to be like a Bond film--not all that ambitious a goal,
particularly of late--FIRST STRIKE is less like a spy film than it is
like a collection of circus acts.</P>
<P>     It would almost be a mistake to say that FIRST STRIKE has a plot.
Basically there is just enough so that Chan can get into a series of
fights.  Jackie (played by Jackie Chan for the first time under
something approaching his own name) has performed well in a mission for
the CIA and they have decided to ask him to go on another mission
almost as a perk.  Jackie is to fly from Hong Kong to Ukraine, just
watching a beautiful woman whom the CIA is following.  Once he gets to
the far end he can have a short vacation at the expense of the CIA.
But at the far end he finds there is more involved in the case than he
expected when he sees what appears to be a kidnapping.  Soon Chan is
chasing through snow pursued by soldiers in white parkas and what looks
like white hockey masks.  Not long after he is fighting muscle-bound
assassins proportioned like TV's The Tick.  There are a few
complications in the plot, a few silly comedy situations, and a few
fights using props at hand.  While the centerpiece of RUMBLE IN THE
BRONX was a fight involving a grocery basket, this time he does
considerably more with a folding ladder.</P>
<P>     What Chan is making are not films in the traditional sense.
Instead he is showing off for the camera, taking risks that probably no
other actor making films today would dare.  And Chan makes no secret of
the fact that a lot of times things go awry as he is filming and he
goes through a lot of physical pain to create the stunts he is showing
us.  More frequently than most other actors would tolerate, things go
very wrong and he comes near to physical injury.  When he jumps off a
cliff and grabs for the skid of a helicopter I think we know that it is
probably not a real cliff, but also that there is a real physical
danger to Chan to even shoot the scene.  We watch him with a
fascination that is almost perverse as he takes one dangerous risk
after another and that is the real soul of his films, knowing we are
seeing real danger.  And so nobody doubts that Chan is taking real
risks, he includes his out-takes collection at the end to prove how
close he really came near to serious injuries.  In what plot there is,
the characters other than Chan become props almost as much as the
inanimate objects around which he flows.  Nobody does much acting in
one of his films and Chan does little but a little mugging for the
camera.  Chan is the only character who has a chance to be a character
and he does not take that acting part of his work seriously.</P>
<P>     FIRST STRIKE--there is no explanation of the title of the film, by
the way--is a lampoon of a Bond film and J. Peter Robinson plays along
at times giving us imitation John Barry music, but something short of
the real thing.  Chan has some comic talent and appears to enjoy living
dangerously.  But most of what it would take to make this film really
tick is still missing.  I rate FIRST STRIKE a high 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.</P>
