Major League: Back to the Minors (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>1989's "Major League" was a delightful surprise.  I didn't expect much of it
when I decided to watch it on cable, but it proved to be fresh and funny. 
However, when the appeal of a movie is its freshness, the sequels are virtually
guaranteed to be stale.  That's certainly true of "Major League II" and the
most recent entry, "Major League:  Back to the Minors."</P>
<P>The title is, of course, a contradiction.  Shouldn't it be "Minor League?" 
That contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director John Warren
has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first
movie.  Original stars Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger (who returned for "Major
League II") are not around, leaving Corbin Bernsen the only original headliner
to make the third movie.  The other veterans who return (Dennis Haysbert as
voodoo-inspired batter Cerrano and Takaaki Ishibashi as Tanaka, who was
introduced in "League II") seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the
enterprise.  The only returning cast member who produces any laughs is Bob
Uecker as radio announcer Harry Doyle, inexplicably broadcasting the games of a
minor league team far from his home turf.</P>
<P>The protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher Gus Cantrell (Scott
Bakula), who is hired by Minnesota Twins owner Roger Dorn (Bernsen) to manage
the Twins' AAA team, the Buzz.  You can write the movie from here:  he finds a
group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to
win.  There's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing (Walton
Goggins), an ex-ballet dancer (Kenneth Johnson), a broken-down old timer (Thom
Barry), twin outfielders both named Juan (the DiFilippo triplets), and a couple
pitchers with throwing problems (Judson Mills and Peter Mackenzie).  Along the
way, Gus picks up Cerrano and Tanaka (Gus is supposedly an old teammate of
theirs, even though he wasn't in either of the preceding films).  Sum total: 
none.  The entire enterprise is artificial, and the cast is not ready for the
Hollywood majors.</P>
<P>Gus' antagonist is Twins manager Leonard Huff (Ted McGinley).  Leonard is a
slimy, sniveling little egotist, and the Twins are lazy, spoiled, and full of
themselves.  (Even watching the first movie I wondered why any real-life team
would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner).  Gus challenges Leonard
to a match, the Buzz vs. the Twins.  (Wanna guess who wins?)</P>
<P>"Back to the Minors" is a movie that has no reason to exist.  There's hardly a
laugh in it, the cast is weak, and the first movie left no room for even one
sequel.  </P>
