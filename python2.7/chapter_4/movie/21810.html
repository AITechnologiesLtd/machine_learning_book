<PRE>                            FELICIA'S JOURNEY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Atom Egoyan is no stranger to the top ten lists of filmcritic.com.
THE ADJUSTER (#7, 1991), CALENDAR (#6, 1993), EXOTICA (#7, 1995), and
THE SWEET HEREAFTER (#3, 1997) attest to some amazing staying power over
our minds.  And while Egoyan's latest effort, FELICIA'S JOURNEY, is
certainly a watchable film, it's likely to be his first of the decade
that doesn't make the cut.</P>
<P>     Why?  While Egoyan is a master at working with cryptic source
material, FELICIA'S JOURNEY lends itself more to its source as a novel
than the big screen.  Basically, this is the story of two people.  First
is Felicia (Cassidy), an Irish lass who's travelled to the U.K. to
search for the father of her unborn child.  Along the way she encounters
Joseph Hilditch (Hoskins), a sweet and friendly `catering director' who
hides a secret that other critics will undoubtedly reveal, but I won't.</P>
<P>     FELICIA'S JOURNEY quickly becomes one of codependency.  Hilditch,
the son of a famous TV cooking show star (Egoyan regular, his wife
Khanjian), needs the woman to dote upon.  Felicia needs him to help
search for her Johnny, and to feed and shelter her.  We do manage to get
inside the heads of both of these characters, particularly interesting
in flashbacks to Hilditch's bizarre life as a child.  But I posit that
the film may have been just as understandable without them.  These
characters just aren't all that deep, especially Felicia, who gets on
your nerves after her prettiness wears off.</P>
<P>     By the end, we realize we've been watching a couple of crazies for
the last two hours.  The resolution arrives exactly as expected, which
is *not* Egoyan's typical M.O.  The movie ends, the theater clears, the
story feels unfinished and trifling.</P>
<P>     Artisan has already begun a campaign to get Hoskins a Best Actor
nomination, and rightfully so.  But aside from his impressive,
slow-burning work along with typical Egoyan cinematic beauty, FELICIA
has little to add to Egoyan's repertoire.  There are moments of
greatness, punctuated by stretches of predictable narrative.
Ultimately, the film just feels too much like something you'd see late
at night on Showtime.  Okay, maybe better than that, but nothing to send
a postcard home about.</P>
<PRE>     Better luck on the next trip, Atom.</PRE>
