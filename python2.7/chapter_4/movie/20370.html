Vampire Hunter D (* out of four). 
Made in 1985.  Directed by Toyoo Ashida</PRE>
<P>There¹s nothing quite like a gory anime. Really, and this is the truth, no
other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said
in the media about it. With anime, a common shot is watching a body getting
quickly cut in two, and the rest of the insides falling out seconds
afterword. This is a standard practice in anime, or at least the half dozen
or so titles that I¹ve seen.</P>
<P>Vampire Hunter D is a gory, gory film. If they ever made a live version of
the film, it would be banned in several countries and given a rating
somewhere below XXX. It¹s not that it¹s gore is unique - it¹s just like
other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the
complexity it¹s story, characters, animation, etc... It really didn¹t. It
was disgusting and gruesome, which overshadowed the story, what little of it
there was.</P>
<P>It seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the
world, because God knows that our local police force just can¹t seem to get
a handle on vampires in the movies. One evening, a blond peasant girl, drawn
to look 17 and innocent (a foreshadow that we will see her naked, I guessed
early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene) is out fighting evil
in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of
a ten thousand year old vampire (insert Strom Thurmand joke here.)  Of
course, he never put a ³no trespassing² sign on his yard, so one can¹t
really blame her, but he¹s upset anyway and demands retribution. She gets
the obligatory bite on the neck (aren¹t there other places to get blood
from? It seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough. If it's good
enough for doctors to draw blood from, then why do vampires stray from that
sight?) To fight the spell, she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall,
dark and handsome vampire hunter (you guessed it, his name is D). The
vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires, being attracted to the 17
year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much. You see,
like all heroes in these kinds of stories, he¹s a brooder, who¹s sole
purpose in life is to remain really, really silent. When he speaks, it¹s in
cliches. Heroes like this are bad when they¹re live, even worse when
animated.</P>
<P>Later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire, who
wants to marry the peasant girl because he¹s bored after 10,000 years of
living (the only clever vampire insight made in the movie), Will Vampire
Hunter D rush to save her in time? Will we see blood and intestines
spattering on every place imaginable? </P>
<P>In it¹s defense, the animation, when focusing on being original rather than
recycling anime slicing, could at times be original. The talking hand was
clever - and I think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo. And
that¹s the best defense I can think of. </P>
<P>I understand that Vampire Hunter D is supposed to be a fave among anime
fans, but I really don¹t see it. It¹s an excuse to watch blood dripping from
teeth, blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks, and most
importantly, like all violent anime, it is an excuse to see animated
breasts. Why? What is the point of that? Maybe I have to understand the
genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny. I¹m not a prude, I just
don¹t think it¹s warranted. It puts itself so far out in front of the movie
that everything else gets lost. Is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old
in the shower? Of course not ‹ it¹s done for shock. It¹s tasteless and
despicable. </P>
