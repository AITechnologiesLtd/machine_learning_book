My Dog Skip
Reviewed by Christian Pyle
Directed by Jay Russell
Written by Gail Gilchriest (based on the book by Willie Morris)
Starring Frankie Muniz, Diane Lane, Luke Wilson, and Kevin Bacon
Grade:  C+</PRE>
<P>"My Dog Skip" is based on the autobiographical tribute of journalist
Willie Morris to his boyhood pet.  Harry Connick Jr. proves the
narrative voice of the elder Morris looking back nostalgically to a
time when he lost his innocence in Yazoo, Mississippi, during World
War II.  Frankie Muniz, the star of TV's "Malcolm in the Middle,"
plays the nine-year-old Willie, a shy, small ch ld who is ostracized
by his peers.  His only friend is his teenage neighbor Dink Jenkins
(Luke Wilson), a high school sports star who's just joined the service
and is about to go overseas.  Realizing that Willie will be lonely
without Dink, Ellen Morris (Diane Lane) buys Willie a dog for his
birthday against the wishes of her husband Jack (Kevin Bacon).  Jack
seems stern and the elder Morris tells us that Jack lost "a piece of
his heart" in the Spanish Civil War along with a leg, but we learn
that Jack resists the dog because it inevitably bring the pain of loss
to Willie.  Willie loves his Jack Russell terrier Skip (Enzo and Moose
of TV's "Frasier") from the start, and Skip soon makes substantial
improvements in Willie's life.</P>
<P>The bullies who torment him become his posse, and the prettiest girl
in chool, Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin Wachs), starts to think he's hot
stuff.  There's a strong "Tom Sawyer" motif in this story.  (Oddly,
though, the director keeps showing us the cover of "Huckleberry
Finn.")  Like Tom, Willie is well-versed in tales of adventure and
leads his friends into mock exploits.  The bullies-turned-friends are
a collective Huck Finn, and Rivers is Becky Thatcher. There are even
some scary bootleggers who stand in for Injun Joe.</P>
<P>The Yazoo of "My Dog Skip" is misted over with the nostalgia common in
memoirs of childhood created after many decades.  (Witness, for
example, Franco Zeffirelli's recreation of his youth in fascist Italy
in "Tea with Musso ini.")  This Yazoo is more realistic than Mayberry
because it allows for the re lities of segregation and war, but it
still rings false.  Even worse, the sappy "Wonder Years"-style
voiceover commentary robs crucial scenes of their sweetness by droning
on and on about the significance of the events.</P>
<P>The saving grace of "Skip" are the performances of Frankie Muniz and
Kevin Bacon.  Muniz does a fine job approximating the accent and
mannerisms of a boy in a small Southern town in the 1940's.  Bacon
gives the best performance of his career.  When the Connick voiceover
introduces Jack Morris, one expects him to be mean and abusive.
However, Jack turns out to be a loving father, and Bacon reveals how
the outward bitterness shields his sensitivity.  He also manages well
with the awkward gait of a one-legged character.  Expect an Oscar
nomination for Bacon.</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  Strong performances keep "Skip" from drowning in its cloying
nostalgia.</P>
