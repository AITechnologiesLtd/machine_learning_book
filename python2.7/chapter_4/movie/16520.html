<P>A review from the Stockholm Film Review 
<A HREF="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/heat/435/">http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/heat/435/</A></P>
<P>Roberto Benigni's "Life is Beautiful" (La vita è bella) is a modern 
fairy tale, as touching and as relevant as the tales collected by the 
Brothers Grimm to entertain, enchant and ,yes, to scare children over 
150 years ago. Like many such tales (such as Snow White) this 
storyteller is not afraid to explore the dark side of humanity in order 
to highlight the power of good. And, in this century, what could be much 
darker than the concentration camps of World War 2, and the attempted 
extermination of entire peoples on the basis of alleged 'impurities' ?</P>
<P>The film begins on a truly whimsical note, with two young men, Guido 
Orifice (Roberto Benigni) and Ferruccio Orefice (Sergio Bini Bustric) 
motoring through picturesque sun-drenched countryside on their way to an 
Italian city to join their uncle and work with him. The car breaks down, 
and while Ferruccio attempts repairs, Guido, a happy-go-lucky but 
intelligent sort, wanders to a nearby farm. There, a beautiful woman, 
Dora, (Nicoletta Braschi) falls out of a hayloft, into Guido's arms. He 
is immediately smitten, though she is merely amused by his antics as he 
tries to impress her.</P>
<P>When the two men reach the city, Guido's plan to open a bookstore are 
scuppered by the inadvertent (though comical) upset he causes to the 
local councillor whose permission is required. However, he meets Dora (a 
schoolteacher) several more times, though each time it is in most 
unexpected manner. He woos her, and she seems interested. Unfortunately, 
she is to be married to the same arrogant councillor whose wrath Guido 
has already incurred. However, in a grand and magical sequence, Guido 
finally wins the hand of his princess, the name he has given her from 
their first meeting.</P>
<P>The challenge of Benigni's work is that it binds two diametrically 
opposed subjects in a balanced and entertaining way. His tale of a 'love 
that was meant to be' is told engagingly and whimsically in the first 
part of the movie. The second part of the movie delves into horror and 
tragedy which test the limits and meaning of such love (indeed any 
love). The second half of the movie is set in a concentration camp, five 
years later. Guido, Dora (now his wife) and their son Joshua have been 
sent there along with their uncle, (Giustino Durano). Dora is separated 
from the others, and Guido tells Joshua that their imprisonment is 
really a game, and that the winner of the game will win a real tank 
(Joshua's unfulfilled birthday wish). Thus, the guards are all part of 
the game, and certain rules must be observed in order to gain enough 
points to win. </P>
<P>The first half of the movie, set in pre-war Italy, sets the tone for the 
events to follow by contrasting the evolving relationship between Guido 
and Dora, with the slow slide of Italy into the Nazis' Final Solution. 
When Guido is working as a waiter (and still trying to win Dora) , he 
encounters a school inspector who will visit her school. Guido turns up 
early, posing as the inspector, only to find out that the inspector was 
to deliver a race superiority lecture to the pupils. Guido invents a 
funny and satirical alternative. Of course, we, the audience, cannot 
fail to see the irony of a bunch of dark-eyed and sallow-skinned five 
year olds receiving a lecture on the superiority of the blue-eyed, blond 
Aryan nation.
When the teachers in the school complain that mathematical problems such 
as "What is the total cost to the state if the cost of each lunatic is 
four crowns and each cripple five, and there are 20, 000 in total" are 
being asked of the pupils, it is not because the questions are sinister 
and tasteless, but because the multiplication is too difficult for five 
year olds. The teachers rue that" it is not too hard for a German five 
year old". </P>
<P>The second half of the movie focuses on the characters rather than the 
horror that confronts them. Guido is forced to work in the ironworks at 
the camp knowing that if he can no longer work, he will die. Even though 
he is weak and dreadfully tired after every day, he keeps a cheery face 
for Joshua so that the facade of the game never drops. This sometimes 
requires him to take extreme risks but Guido never hesitates. His love 
for his son is complete. In the same way, Dora had the option of evading 
the camp but chose to be with her family, albeit remotely. The central 
characters never allows their humanity to be overwhelmed by the events 
and the callous indifference shown to them by their captors. When 
Guido's uncle (Giustino Durano) is being led to the 'showers', a female 
guard stumbles and he helps her. He retains his dignity despite knowing 
his fate.</P>
<P>The movie has been criticised for trivialising the Holocaust; unfairly 
in my opinion. It is true that certain events in the movie are a little 
unrealistic. Perhaps Guido would not have escaped punishment for some of 
his antics in a real camp. But the appalling nature of the camps is 
never denied - merely pointed up in a subtle way. Joshua complains that 
he cannot find any of the other children competing for the prize. Guido 
tells him that they are better at hiding than Joshua, and only the child 
best at hiding will win. Guido knows the real reason for the lack of 
children is because they were all gassed once they arrived.
Guido meets an old friend in the camp - a Dr. Lessing (Horst Buchholz, 
reunited with Benigni from Faraway, So Close) whom Guido used to pit his 
wits against in games of riddles. Now Dr. Lessing decides who is fit to 
work and who must be sent to the 'showers' (fit to die, so to speak). </P>
<P>Begnini's performance is central to the success of the movie, and his 
screen-time with his son Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini) is convincing and 
affectionate. Funnily enough, the weakest part of the story is why Dora 
and Guido get together (Braschi is Benigni's real-life wife). Yes, it is 
meant to be a tribute to the power of serendipity and fate. But, while 
we know that Guido is a good person, all we know of Dora is her beauty 
(which is a prerequisite for a princess in a fairy tale, I suppose), and 
that she hates her fiancée. Buchholz and Durano are also quietly 
effective as the doctor and the uncle respectively, using the slightest 
of expressions and gestures to convey a world of emotion and meaning.</P>
<P>Benigni's (who is director and co-writer of the film) use of a 
concentration camp as a backdrop to his story is a brave and inspired 
move. Though comparisons with Spielberg's Schindler's List are 
understandable, Life is Beautiful is closer to Charlie Chaplin's The 
Great Dictator. Both Chaplin and Benigni use the plight of 'the common 
man' to underline the effects of fascism. However, Chaplin resorted to 
rather obvious sentimentality which he contrasted with a heavy-handed 
satirical portrayal of Hitler. Benigni does not need to put horns or 
tails on his 'bad guys'. Their events and deeds speak of their character 
loud and clear. (To be fair to Chaplin, he did not have the benefit of 
hindsight). At a time when similar atrocities are still taking place in 
an area only a few hours flight from most cities in Europe, it is also a 
timely reminder of the consequences of such madness. This is a truly 
adult fairly tale; triumphant, poignant, timeless and one which will 
linger long in the minds of those who see it, and creating memories that 
one will wish to revisit time and time again.</P>
