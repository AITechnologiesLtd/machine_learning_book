<PRE>The Original Kings of Comedy</PRE>
<P>Stand-up comedy isn't as simple as a comedian standing on a stage with a 
microphone trying to get the audience to laugh. It's now an interactive 
almost physical game with the audience so that their participation can 
overshadow the comedian's material. When you go to see "The Original Kings of 
Comedy" in a cinema your audience will probably act a lot like the one in the 
movie, except that the comedian can't hear them and this will make or break 
the experience for you. </P>
<P>Live comedy now seems to be the outlet for which performers and audiences can 
go to for straight-up blatant jokes about really risque subject matters and 
jokes that can't be delivered in a fictional medium. Comedians today have to 
be as in-your-face and outrageous as possible to work a crowd, especially a 
concert hall crowd. And with black comedians in front of a predominately 
black audience it's bonding experience. It's very emotional and unrestricted 
like a black church is, but here instead of everyone praising God they're 
laughing at themselves via the comedians' hardcore material (it's the 
forbidden fruit of the modern age). The material and the performance isn't 
insulting (at least not intentionally), it's a method that uses humility as a 
character builder. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm sure God has 
a sense of humor but I doubt He would approve of the material here. </P>
<P>The movie is basically a filmed concert of the same title starring four black 
comedians who are rising stars in Hollywood: Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, 
Cedric "The Entertainer" and Bernie Mac. The film opens with some 
behind-the-scenes documentary-style of the four talking about the show and 
themselves and how they relate to each other. There's also little vignettes 
between performers showing the four talking directly to the camera although 
they don't really say much they just kind of ramble. There isn't much point 
to these because they aren't quite that funny, they just seem like 
time-filler. </P>
<P>As for the show itself it's quite funny. Harvey is the opening comedian and 
the emcee of the show and gets the most screen time. He is the most 
interactive with the audience and really gets to the heart of the crowd by 
pointing out some people making jokes about them. At one point he even gets 
the jacket of an audience member and spoofs him after he leaves his seat. 
Harvey's actual material discusses characteristics of being an 
African-American and makes a lot of really funny jokes about topics that 
would be depressing. </P>
<P>D.L. Hughley is next and seems to have the shortest set. His material is 
mostly personal but it's stuff you can relate to, well, sex stuff that is. He 
also works the crowd very well by picking people out and making fun of them. 
He's not being mean because he's so aloof and over-the-top you can't take it 
seriously (although I wouldn't want to be one of the people he points at). </P>
<P>Cedric "The Entertainer" is third and probably has the funniest and most 
lighthearted material ("light" compared to the three others'). Most of his 
set deals with the differences between blacks and whites in America. He's 
successfully able to break down subjects that are pretty serious and make 
them funny such as the subconscious desire for confrontation and hostility 
blacks have and whites don't (his words not mine!). His bit on why black men 
don't play hockey is great although I would have liked more. </P>
<P>Closing the show is Bernie Mac, the most vulgar and outrageous of the four. 
His material is just as funny as the others but a little disturbing. He raps 
about what it's like to be a parent of young black children today and how 
black parents have a tendency to be totally honest and crude with their kids. 
He also talks about how black parents aren't at all afraid to smack their 
kids around when they need discipline ("If you're old enough to talk back 
you're old enough to get hit" is his rationale). Still, it's a bit disturbing 
at how much the audience relates to and laughs along with his bits about 
being mean to kids and other people. There's a whole book worth of 
conservative commentary to write just about Mac's material alone but I'm not 
going to even bother with it. </P>
<P>I guess what it all comes down to is that "The Original Kings of Comedy" is 
clearly aimed at the African-American demographic and makes no apologies for 
it. If you're white (like me), you WON'T be able to relate to the material as 
well and thus not laugh as hard and/or be insulted. But don't take it 
personally, everything here is done in relatively good spirits and isn't 
meant to provoke anyone (if it were the audience would probably boo the 
comedians for every other joke). It's not surprising Spike Lee directed and 
produced this film - it says a lot of the same social commentaries as his 
other films, only this time it's right to your face and there's nothing 
subtle about it.
