<P>     In the movies, the holidays are times when dysfunctional families 
come together, air their differences, then renew their closeness so that 
everyone can go home happy.  It's frequently a melodramatic and cloying 
process, and, even when there are gifted actors involved (such as Holly 
Hunter in the Jodie Foster-directed HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS), watching 
such a film can be a dull, uninvolving process.  With THE MYTH OF 
FINGERPRINTS, however, writer/director Bart Freundlich has scored a 
coup:  he has created a low-key holiday drama that's refreshing not only 
because it lacks the big discovery melodrama of most similar movies but 
because it's entirely believable.</P>
<P>     THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS begins with the familiar process of the 
family re-assembling at Mom and Dad's New England house during 
Thanksgiving week.  The only one who still lives with her parents (who 
are ably portrayed by Roy Scheider and Blythe Danner) is Leigh (Laurel 
Holloman), the sprightly youngest child who has a boundless well of 
enthusiasm and good cheer.  The same cannot be said of most of the 
returning children.  There's Warren (Noah Wyle, from TV's ER), who 
hasn't been home in three years since breaking up with his high-school 
sweetheart (Arija Bareikis).  The perpetually-cranky Mia (Julianne 
Moore, currently in BOOGIE NIGHTS) arrives with her latest significant 
other, therapist Elliot (Brian Kerwin), in tow. Their relationship is 
clearly on the rocks, and Mia's fascination with an old grade school pal 
(James LeGros) doesn't help matters.  Jake (Michael Vartan) shows up 
with his flighty girlfriend, Margaret (Hope Davis), who amuses Jake's 
Mom by insisting that she and her boyfriend share the same bed.</P>
<P>     At its best, THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS is a sensitive, intelligent 
examination of the dynamics of a dysfunctional family (note:  families 
in movies like this must always be dysfunctional, otherwise there 
wouldn't be much of a story).  At its worst, which isn't often, 
Freundlich's feature debut runs into difficulties with cliches:  the 
overbearing father who has left his "fingerprints" on the lives of each 
of his offspring, the search by various couples to rekindle the old 
flame, etc.  One of the most atypical aspects of THE MYTH OF 
FINGERPRINTS is that it isn't loaded with "shocking" revelations – 
everything is pretty much as it seems and the friction between the 
characters is the result of normal causes rather than motion picture 
contrivances.  Plus, in true slice-of-life fashion, hardly anything gets 
wrapped up over the course of the picture.  We see a few small dramas 
play themselves out, but the larger story, which began long before the 
picture's opening credits, is not cleanly closed.</P>
<P>     Freundlich has a good sense of what makes for absorbing drama – a 
quality that consistently applies to THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS.  Through 
strong, well-focused writing and with the help of a uniformly effective 
cast, the director gets us to care about every member of the family in a 
remarkably short span of time.  The dialogue is also thoughtful and 
insightful, rather than trite.  Examples include Warren's explanation 
for why he's going home this year for Thanksgiving:  "It's been long 
enough that I can't quite remember that I shouldn't go," and Mia's 
observation that family members are "the first people you're supposed to 
be hostile to."</P>
<P>     THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS contains a number of noteworthy scenes, 
including some strangely quiet dinners and awkward moments between 
estranged siblings.  But the best sequence occurs early in the film, on 
the night when everyone has finally assembled under one roof.  One-by-
one, the various couples begin to make love, and the concert of moans, 
thumps, and squeaks creates an atmosphere that is both poignant and 
funny, especially as we observe Warren's reaction to all the noise 
around him.</P>
<P>     Nothing much happens during THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS, but that's 
the point.  For 90 minutes, Freundlich opens a window into the lives of 
a few characters, and our perspective is so clear that we feel we get to 
know them.  So, although the material is not especially challenging, the 
results are among the best for an American film of this genre.  For 
those who appreciate this sort of simple drama, THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS 
is worth a trip to the theater.</P>
