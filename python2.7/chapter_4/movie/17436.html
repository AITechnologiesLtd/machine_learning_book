<P>   Patrick Henry once said that it is natural for man to indulge
in illusions.  Our mere attendance at the cinema is proof of
that.  While we know, deep down, that what we are seeing on
the screen is only a movie, we suspend reality and for a
couple of hours we are the great lovers, the heroes that
saved the day, the perfectly proportioned and handsome
celebrities.  Happily we don't need to patronize the theater or
even read a book to enjoy these fantasies.  We can
daydream during those painfully dull parts of the day that find
us engaged in routine work, and conjure up a host of spirits
during our nights of rest.  But what happens when those
gauzy fantasies turn into nightmares: when our comely looks
turn into a gory countenance, our favorite lover turns into a
person we have tried to avoid, and we're sent hurtling into a
Kafkaesque predicament which finds us guilty of crimes we
have no recollection of having committed?  With the special
effects technology now available even to low budget
productions and given the unfettered imagination of an
ambitious director, our screen characters can change
appearance and personality in a moment.  Brad Pitt can turn
into The Phantom of the Opera with the stroke of a computer
key, while Disneyland can be transformed into Dark City in a
flash of directorial inspiration.  </P>
<P>   The Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar eagerly exploits
the medium's protean abilities in "Open Your Eyes."  He
follows up his first feature, "Tesis," with a bizarre tale of one
26-year-old man's nightmarish experience in his home city of
Madrid, one which transforms his life to a greater extent in a
period of weeks than the vast majority of us have
experienced in a lifetime.  The picture is audacious, though
not as original in concept as Amenabar may realize.  What is
particularly noteworthy is that the director, ingeniously casting
a flurry of images on the screen from a script co-written by
Mateo Gil, has successfully transformed genres at breakneck
speed from romance to sci-fi to horror, keeping us guessing
for most of its two-hour duration about the way the enigma
will be resolved.</P>
<P>   The focus remains throughout on the handsome, self-
centered Cesar (Eduardo Noriega), whose amoral character
leads him to betray his best friend when such a deception
suits his needs and whose ego will not permit him to sleep
with the same woman twice.  Obsessively pursued by the
passionate Nuria (Najwa Nimri), he is immediately captivated
by the cooler Sofia (Penelope Cruz), currently dating his best
pal, Pelayo (Fele Martinez).  When Sofia tentatively responds
to his flirtations, the jealous Nuria reacts viciously.  Inviting
Cesar for one last ride in her car, Nuria floors the accelerator
and, deliberately plunging off a cliff, she kills herself and
grossly disfigures Cesar's face.  </P>
<P>   Like Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, Cesar must
hide his face behind a mask, having discovered to no one's
surprise that Sofia no longer bears the same feeling toward
him that she had the first time around.  When plastic
surgeons inform him that a new procedure will allow them to
restore his original good looks, he can scarcely believe his
good fortune.  But shortly after he recovers his comely
features under a dazzling array of futuristic machinery, he
begins to suspect that what he sees is not necessarily what
exists.</P>
<P>   Amenabar delivers spine-tingling tension at select points in
the drama, particularly when the good-looking Cesar looks in
the mirror only to discover that his maimed visage has
returned, and especially in one stark moment of horror when
the woman with whom he is making love turns into the
person he has tried to elude and who is thought to have died
in the crash.  While "Open Your Eyes" deals throughout with
life's dualities--with the gap between appearance and reality
and our inability to grasp thoroughly what goes on in the
minds of others--its principal appeal lies in its enigma.  We
are challenged by the writers and director to figure out
exactly what is going on; to determine who is the real Cesar
and who is the actual Sofia.  In that regard it shares the
stage with the most puzzling movie of David Lynch's output,
his 1997 "Lost Highway," about a jazz musician who believes
his wife is having an affair and suddenly finds himself the
main suspect in a murder he has no recollection of
committing.  While Lynch's plot is as baffling as ever two
years after its initial screening, "Open Your Eyes" seems to
reveal The Answer in the final seconds.  Therein lies its
major flaw.  We in the audience sit upright, perplexed about
the cloudy visions which are tossed before our eyes,
assessing that all will be clarified in the concluding scene. 
When the big payoff does finally arrive, we cannot help
feeling let down by the film's copout.  While Amenabar might
have unravelled the many quandaries of the picture in a more
intriguing and clever manner, he takes the easiest way out.</P>
<P>   Nonetheless "Open Your Eyes" is well acted by a primarily
young cast headed by Eduardo Noriega and possesses
several particularly bold images that take good advantage of
the qualities of the medium.</P>
