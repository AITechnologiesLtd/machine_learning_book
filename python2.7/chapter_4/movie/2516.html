<PRE>                                   SERIAL MOM
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Kathleen Turner, Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew Lillard,
           Mary Jo Catlett.
Screenplay/Director:  John Waters.</P>
<P>     Let's compare the cinematic Bards of Baltimore for a moment.  In
one corner, we have Barry Levinson, who painted the city in nostalgic
sienna tones with DINER, TIN MEN and AVALON.  In the other is John
Waters, with POLYESTER, HAIRSPRAY and now SERIAL MOM.  If I'm guessing,
I'd say that the Chamber of Commerce might lean towards Levinson.
However, when putting their latest films head to head, I think my
choice is obvious.  Levinson's JIMMY HOLLYWOOD was a slapdash attempt
at social commentary; SERIAL MOM is a sly bullseye, hitting every
target in sight with a return to the gloriously grotesque John Waters
of PINK FLAMINGOS fame/infamy.</P>
<P>     Kathleen Turner stars as Beverly Sutphin, a suburban housewife
with everything:  loving husband Eugene (Sam Waterston); feisty son
Chip (Matthew Lillard); sweet daughter Misty (Ricki Lake).  She also
has a little secret:  she kills people.  A lot of people.  Anyone who
crosses her, really, from the teacher who insults her son to the boy
who jilts her daughter.  With the growing body count, Beverly
increasingly becomes the object of suspicion, especially when Eugene
finds correspondence between Beverly and Ted Bundy.  Eventually,
Beverly is brought to trial, a trial which becomes a huge media event
and a potential TV movie starring Suzanne Somers (herself).</P>
<P>     Waters manages to comment on so many different aspects of
contemporary society that it's hard to believe he intended them all.
At the top of his hit list is our fascination with tabloid
sensationalism, and the cult of personality which develops around
anti-social behavior.  Beverly reads _Helter Skelter_ and collects
clippings of mass murder stories; Chip is delighted by the fame Mom's
trial brings.  Even the neighborhood busybodies who are quickest to
condemn Beverly get together to watch talk shows about girlfriends of
serial killers.  Without hand-wringing, Waters points out our
complicity in such crimes through our fascination with them.  But he
doesn't stop there.  Also under his scrutiny are the latent vigilantism
borne of feelings of powerlessness, and the foibles of both
conservatives (Beverly's rigid sense of propriety) and liberals (one
witness against Beverly is discredited because she doesn't recycle).
His one stumble into heavy-handedness comes when Chip's girlfriend
reacts to the difference between real blood and movie blood, but
basically Waters keeps the tone light with his cartoonish style.  This
is "Twin Peaks" as performed by The Three Stooges.</P>
<P>     Social commentary aside, SERIAL MOM is just plain funny.  Waters
goes for the gross-out from the get-go, as his name in the credits
appears under a crushed fly; this leads to Beverly skewering her
daughter's would-be beau, inadvertently removing some viscera, and to a
messy sneeze which leads to anarchy in a church.  There is a gleeful
scene as Beverly clubs a woman to death with a leg of lamb while
singing along to "Tomorrow" from ANNIE, and another at a concert where
Beverly is led away in cuffs to a chant of "Serial Mom!  Serial Mom!"
The highlight, however, is definitely the trial, where Beverly defends
herself in some very creative ways, while her family hawks "Serial Mom"
T-shirts outside the courthouse.  The opening is a bit slow, but SERIAL
MOM finishes with high energy.</P>
<P>     Waters sprinkles SERIAL MOM liberally with kitschy cameos like
Somers, Patricia Hearst (as a juror who becomes the object of Beverly's
ire) and riot girl band L7, but it is Kathleen Turner's performance as
Beverly which sparkles.  Turner has suffered through so many bad films
in recent years that it is a pleasure to see her with something she can
sink her teeth into.  Her smiling amalgam of Donna Reed and Hannibal
Lecter is frequently campy, but always appealing, creating another
level of identification which implicates the audience.  It's true that
the characters in SERIAL MOM are one-dimensional, but that's almost
appropriate given the film's framework as a "true-crime" re-enactment
of the real events.  SERIAL MOM is fun with an edge, and it killed me.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 serial killings:  8.</PRE>
