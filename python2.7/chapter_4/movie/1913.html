<PRE>                                    POSSE
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1993 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     POSSE is a film directed by Mario Van Peebles and written by Sy
Richardson and Dario Scardapane.  The cast includes Mario Van Peebles,
Stephen Baldwin, Charles Lane, and Billy Zane.  Rated R for violence,
sex, and nudity.</P>
<P>     POSSE is an MTV film that poses as a major antidote to the
traditional lack of black people in Western movies.  The story of
blacks in the West, the black cowboys, the black homesteaders, the
black soldiers (called buffalo soldiers by the Indians), and the rest,
remains to be told.  Mario Van Peebles has taken an important, and
mostly unknown, story and trivialized it with an overproduced and
underwritten action film.</P>
<P>     For one thing, POSSE's writers might have bothered doing a little
research.  They misuse the word posse by making it mean "gang" instead
of "an armed band with legal authority."  They have the action begin
with the Spanish-American War (1898).  Then the story takes the
so-called posse beyond the frontier.  Piffle! In one of the landmarks
of U.S. historical study, Frederick Jackson Turner in the 1893 address
"The Significance of the Frontier in American History" established that
the frontier had died twenty years before.  Then once the posse have
gone beyond the frontier, they must take a fearsome shortcut through
Indian territory.  Never mind that Wounded Knee, the last major battle
of the Indian Wars, had taken place in 1890 and virtually all the
Indians were settled on reservations.  All this from a film that
purports to lecture its audience from time to time on the history of
blacks in the American west.</P>
<P>     Furthermore, I seriously question that the best vehicle for
presenting an important look at blacks in the West is an action film,
which is by its very nature a fantasy.  Someone in responding to
Bernadelli's review said that what westerns are, shoot-'em-ups.  To
which I again say, piffle.  Yes, a lot of westerns are just that, but
the best ones are not.  They may include scenes of violence, but that
is not their main thrust, their purpose, their excuse for existing.
And certainly, this film is the merest welter of a lot of other
westerns.  Van Peebles looks as much as he can like Clint Eastwood.  He
has also liberally helped himself to scenes from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,
UNFORGIVEN, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, THE WILD BUNCH,
ONE-EYED JACKS, and the complete oeuvres of John Ford and Sergio
Leone.</P>
<P>     And then there are the narrative and style problems.  Van Peebles
has reduced an important story to a disjointed succession of violent
confrontation between a black character, usually Van Peebles, and one
of two major psychotic white villains or their many, and mostly, white
henchmen.  All this filmed with various, irrelevant "effects" such as a
brown filter that makes it look like he used film stock that was too
old.  Complications in technique and a busy sound track of mostly
inappropriate music cannot disguise, indeed only emphasize, the
unintelligent mess this movie is.</P>
<P>     Despite all this, I have to say I found what enjoyment there was
in some individual actors' performances.  Stephen Baldwin was
interesting as the only white member of the posse.  Billy Zane
obviously was having a lot of fun hamming it up as the psycho colonel.
It was fun seeing Melvin Van Peebles, Mario's dad.  But none of the
actors was able to rise much above the mess of the rest of the film.</P>
<P>     I was also interested in snippets of some silent films with black
cowboys and other western heroes.  I would like to know more about
them.</P>
<P>     I cannot recommend this film to anyone, but if you must go, be
sure you wait for a cheap matinee.</P>
