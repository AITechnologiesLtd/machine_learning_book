<P>
In a weird fit of synchronicity, I'm sitting in this coffee shop, and
they have the Cure on the stereo.  The "Boys Don't Cry" album I think.
The Jungian cosmic coincidence part: I saw the Mike Leigh film last
night, "Career Girls", and, in the flashbacks, the Cure provides aural
texture for many of its scenes.  The movie is about the reunion of two
college roommates, 6 years after they last saw each other.  The time
they were in college was the late 1980s, and I guess Leigh fixed on the
Cure as signature music of that time and place.</P>
<P>Movies that take place in whatever decade uses signature music: the
Fifties with Elvis and Buddy Holly, the Sixties with the Beatles, Beach
Boys, Stones or whatever, the Seventies with disco.  Films that span
decades, like "Grace of My Heart", changed musical style by the scene.
I'm not sure what the music of the Eighties should be.  Early Madonna?
Boy George?  U2 when the filmmaker is trying to convey "earnest?" And
ten years from now I suppose we'll hear Trent Reznor and Garth Brooks
interspersed with images of Alan Greenspan in "Forest Gump III:
Irrational Exuberance".</P>
<P>In any case, Leigh's previous film was the great "Secrets and Lies".
The events of that film unfolded when a young black woman decides to find
her biological mother.  Mom turns out to be a working class white woman.
The latter freaks: she never saw the baby, and put her up for adoption
immediately after birth.  The film also has a second major story,
concerning the mother's brother and his family, and their particular
struggles.  I can't say much more: you'll have to see the movie.  It's a
fantastic film.</P>
<P>"Career Girls" therefore has to follow one of the best films of that
year.  It's not a bad film in its own right, but comes up as
disappointing given its predecessor.  I expected more.</P>
<P>I'm probably following some of the reviews I've read in these comments,
but so be it; many of their points are correct.  The film takes place
in the present, over a weekend reunion.  There are extensive flashbacks
back to their college days, illuminating certain significant events.
In the present, as they go through London, they bump into people who
figure in or trigger these flashbacks.  Note that the flashbacks don't
necessarily happen after they meet someone, but may precede the
encounter.  Synchronicity by example.  It feels forced.</P>
<P>This may be one of the flaws of the film.  Or, rather, it's in contrast
to Leigh's usual style, as someone noted: the past is used to
illuminate the present.  In "Secrets and Lies", the present speaks for
itself:  small gestures, looks and silences describe the characters'
histories and relationships.  In "Secrets", there is nothing so crude
as a handycam traipsing through a messy flat, Robert Smith crooning
"Just Like Heaven" in the background.  These flashbacks, in my opinion,
don't necessarily make it a bad film, but they make it far less subtle
than the other one; it's less than what the director is capable of.</P>
<P>I have more or a problem with the past as it's depicted.  The
characters in their youth are collections of ticks and nervous gestures
verging on neurological trauma.  These characteristics are actually
funny at first, and at second for that matter, but they get tired by
the end.  And it feels like the film is using a collection of
hyperactive spasms in place of more concrete development.</P>
<P>The relationship between past and present is another problem.  As said,
synchronicity abounds.  It closes the events and characters in a tight
circle: very little of what's shown in the past and what happens in the
present are outside of this circle.  I don't necessarily find fault
with this particular structure: one can argue that it's tight story
telling, with these characters existing solely for this particular
tale.  But it's different from depth of character found in the previous
film.  In "Secrets and Lines", there is a background that's not quite
illuminated, a feeling that there's a great deal more than what's shown
on screen, that there's a lifetime of experience off-camera.  In
"Career Girls", the matter is closed; there's nothing more here.</P>
<P>And perhaps this leads to a final point.  The characters' lives are
shown as "empty" in the present.  There is a curious disconnect from
between the past and the present in this regard.  The flashbacks do
little to illuminate their lives just before the film starts.  They
only serve to give background to events during the reunion, and little
else.  It's as if the characters exist only at two points in time:
their years in college and this weekend.  </P>
