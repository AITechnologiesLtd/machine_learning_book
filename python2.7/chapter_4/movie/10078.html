<PRE>.                            ALIEN: RESURRECTION
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1997 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     I'm not entirely sure how to begin a review of the highly-anticipated (at
least for me) fourth installment of the ALIEN series except to say... what a letdown!</P>
<P>     Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley died in ALIEN3, the movie that was
supposed to put the nail in the ALIEN coffin, but thanks to the miracles of
next-millennium cloning, she's back, and full of alien DNA to boot (thus
making her invincible, giving her acid for blood, and generally a pretty
creepy chick).  This new twist has great potential, as Ripley's alien side
gives her a strange kinship with the creatures... creatures that once again
are loosed by idiot scientists trying to tame them.</P>
<P>     But in the end, the desire to spill more Blood! Blood! Blood! (and alien
goo) wins out over plot and thematics.  Instead, the picture progresses like a
sorry rehash of the first three movies.  Two hours later, I left depressed.</P>
<P>     Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who made the masterful DELICATESSEN, has
plenty of fun with creepy set design, creatures galore, clever photography,
and propelled mucous, but other than that, ALIEN 4 has little to recommend. 
Even Winona Ryder as a reluctant comrade is a real disappointment.</P>
<PRE>     In a crowded theater, everyone can hear you groan.</PRE>
