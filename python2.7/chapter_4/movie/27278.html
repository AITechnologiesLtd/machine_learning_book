<P>UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD (1991) - Reviewed by Jerry Saravia</P>
<P>Wim Wenders' "Until the End of the World" is a fascinating, fractured, 
disconnected mess of a movie. Watching it recently for the second time, I 
found it less enthralling than I had initially. It is like watching a trailer 
for a film that is not quite complete. </P>
<P>It is the year 1999 and an Indian nuclear satellite has spun out of control 
causing great alarm around the world. Claire Tourneur (Solveig Dommartin), an 
adventurous partygoer, could care less about a potential nuclear crisis. She 
loves to sleep endlessly and listen to rock and roll music, especially 
Elvis's "Summer Kisses, Winter Tears" (also sung in the film by David Lynch 
regular Julee Cruise). While traveling back home, Claire finds herself 
iadvertently involved with two bank robbers, a traveler wearing a fedora hat 
named Trevor Mcphee (William Hurt), who is being hunted by the government, a 
bounty hunter, and so on. This all takes them to a spiritual habitat in the 
Australian Outback where Farber's father, a crotchety scientist (Max Von 
Sydow), lives with his blind wife (Jeanne Moreau). </P>
<P>I do not wish to reveal much more of the film except to say that the first 
half is brilliant moviemaking, exploring a world inhabited by videophones, 
digital video cameras, headsets that can record images, tracking devices, all 
told in an almost noirish, Godardian landscape (in fact, both Dommartin and 
Hurt seem to be doing variations on the characters in Godard's "Breathless" 
and "Pierrot le Fou.") Most of what the film shows has become a reality today 
in the year 2000, though videophones never took off. The ability to trace 
anyone anywhere is also a real possibility, even on the Internet. </P>
<P>Once the characters settle in Australia, the film loses its urgency and 
potency. Basically, we are left with endless shots of people strapped to 
chairs while enduring dream hypnosis and other sleep-inducing phenomena so 
that a new kind of camera can record and visualize people's dreams. The 
characters in this section of the film become less interesting as well. Why 
the hell does Claire follow the listless Farber all around the world? Does 
she truly love him or does she want the money he stole from her? I think it 
may have been a mistake to show a femme fatale with a compassionate, sweet 
aura - the transition is simply not there and thus not believable. Dommartin 
seems to be playing the same angelic, melancholy character she played in 
Wenders' "Wings of Desire." Characters such as the devious bounty hunter, the 
sloppy government agent, the whimsical bank robbers, and Claire's boring 
boyfriend, an author (Sam Neill, who also narrates the film) all become 
ciphers literally kept in the background. </P>
<P>Every sequence set in Australia feels disconnected and rushed, though the 
soundtrack and the sight of seeing the towering presences of Max Von Sydow 
and Jeanne Moreau keeps one glued as to what happens next. It all sort of 
feels choppy and not edited with smooth transitions from one scene to the 
next. The reason may be that Wim Wenders initially had a longer cut, 
reportedly five hours long and shown briefly at a university in 1996. I wait 
for the day when this cut becomes available and shown in cinema screens. 
Heck, if they did it for "Das Boot" and "The Last Emperor," they can do it 
for Wenders' film. </P>
<P>Despite the flaws and narrative inconsistencies, "Until the End of the World" 
is brave, original, risky, full of ambitious ideas, and often a sight to 
behold (including the innovative use, at the time, of high-definition 
television). It is often compelling and moving enough to make one wish it 
were better. I am sure the longer, director's cut is the great film that this 
truncated version aspires to be. </P>
