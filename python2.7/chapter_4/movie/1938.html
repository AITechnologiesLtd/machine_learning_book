<PRE>                             CLIFFHANGER
                     A review by Steve Baumgarten
                           (<A HREF="mailto:sbb@panix.com">sbb@panix.com</A>)</PRE>
<P>     Although a two-word review would be nearly sufficient for this one
("Climb Hard"), it wouldn't be nearly as much fun to write, and it
would be a tad misleading.  I should say at the outset that if nothing
else, CLIFFHANGER proves how difficult it is to make a top-notch action
film, no matter how much money or how many digital effects you throw at
it.  It also shows quite convincingly why Arnold Schwarzenegger is the
biggest box office draw of his generation, while Sylvester Stallone is
quickly becoming an embarrassing curiosity, someone who apparently
cannot be convinced to settle for his decade worth of fame and fortune
and fade gracefully into the background.  (In fact, Stallone's
performance in CLIFFHANGER does more than that:  it really forces us to
think about which other action/adventure star has done so much to ruin
a film so promising.  None come to mind, though perhaps as I get
further into this review I'll suffer a DOUBLE IMPACT / UNIVERSAL
SOLDIER flashback and decide upon Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Though at
least Van Damme is still cheap.)</P>
<P>     Stallone is not cheap; in fact, nothing about CLIFFHANGER is
cheap.  Unfortunately, nothing about CLIFFHANGER is all that good,
either; as a virtual clone of DIE HARD, it hardly merits a mention in
the same paragraph, though on the surface it's not immediately clear
why.  After all, CLIFFHANGER is chock full of nasty, sneering European
terrorists; high-tech explosions; graphic violence; hundreds of
thousands of dollars that can be accessed only through the use of a
computer code; and a bare-chested, steroidal hero who wreaks havoc on
the terrorists and single-handedly saves the day.  Even the altitude of
the two films is nearly the same; although come to think of it, Bruce
Willis never seemed to be suffering from oxygen deprivation -- and yet
oxygen deprivation is the only thing that could reasonably explain
Stallone's unrelievedly awful dialogue.</P>
<P>     Yes, Stallone wrote the screenplay (or should I say, "rewrote" it,
since however execrable it seems in its current form, it was apparently
even worse before Sly "improved" it).  And CLIFFHANGER's terrible
screenplay is its Achilles heel, for although director Renny Harlin
(who did a respectable job in the similarly implausible DIE HARD 2)
does what he can to keep our minds off of Stallone's dialogue,
inevitably the film slows down and we find ourselves stuck on a ledge
with nothing between us and a perilous fall into unintentional hilarity
but the thin rope of Stallone's wit.  Rope?  Better make that
thread...</P>
<P>     There are also other, more subtle problems with the film.  One
that looms particularly large is the sheer unoriginality of the
screenplay -- as I mentioned, the writer(s) seemed to want to remake
DIE HARD on a mountain instead of inside a skyscraper.  That they did,
though in doing so they missed many of the elements that made DIE HARD
so successful (putting aside clever dialogue and a hero who didn't make
the audience cringe every time he appeared on the screen).  Primarily,
they missed DIE HARD's single-minded, pared-down focus.  We never got a
lot of background or human interest stories in DIE HARD; in fact, one
of its best qualities is that it went from civilized Christmas party to
Bruce Willis running bare-foot through broken glass in an astonishingly
short amount of time.  Yes, much of DIE HARD was silly; much was
entirely implausible; much was downright maudlin.  But because its
pacing was so superb, the filmmakers were able to trick us into
overlooking all its flaws and instead see only the film's central
vision.  At heart, DIE HARD was little more than a high-tech spaghetti
Western, with Bruce Willis as -- quite literally for most of the film
-- The Man With No Name, who against unbelievable odds must save the
town and the woman he loves from death and destruction at the hands of
sinister bad guys.</P>
<P>     But I defy anyone who has seen CLIFFHANGER to tell me what this
film's vision is.  Actually, I'll settle for a conference call with
Harlin, Stallone, and anyone at all at Carolco willing to admit to
paying Stallone what amounts to $2 million for each of his unbroken
string of duds since RAMBO to star in, rewrite, and ruin this one.</P>
<P>     CLIFFHANGER is, in fact, three films, two of which star Mr.
Stallone and only one of which is particularly interesting.  The first
film provides background for Stallone's character, Gabe Walker, who
loses his confidence as a rescue ranger when he lets an inexperienced
climber slip from his grasp and plunge to her digitally enhanced doom.
That Walker could have done little to save her and that in fact he did
nothing at all to put her life in jeopardy is treated by the screenplay
as one of those small, unimportant details that only sticklers for
plausible motivation will care about.  Since the filmmakers assume that
their audience will be comprised, for the most part, of unthinking
dolts, it hardly matters what happens in the scene, as long as Stallone
gives himself a reason to look disheartened and forlorn for the next
half hour.  (Not to give anything away, but in a surprise twist
Stallone ceases looking disheartened and forlorn when he learns that
his best friend is in trouble -- rendering the whole of the film's
first sub-plot entirely pointless.)</P>
<P>     After its breathtaking opening sequence, the film crashes back to
earth for what seems like an eternity as the second of the three
sub-plots is laboriously set up.  Here we are introduced to us the
terrorists, lead by John Lithgow in predictably over-the-top,
sociopathic style, and their own plot to hijack a Treasury plane
transporting three suitcases filled with thousand-dollar bills.  I
won't go into the details of their plan here, as its execution is
surely the high point of the film and provides CLIFFHANGER with a much
needed -- though meager -- dose of originality.  It also keeps Stallone
and his inability to act off the screen for 20 minutes or so, which
certainly doesn't hurt -- though it does make us wonder whether
CLIFFHANGER could have been further improved by eliminating Stallone's
character entirely and allowing Michael Rooker to share in the heroics
with Janine Turner.  Both are accomplished actors, and both are just as
qualified as Stallone to allow stunt doubles and digital compositing to
handle the action part of this action-adventure film.  As for running
around in snow-covered fields waving automatic weapons, well, anyone
can do that.  The real question is whether CLIFFHANGER would have been
as much of a draw without Stallone; I'd argue that it might have been
even more of one without his ham-handed presence both in front of the
camera and behind the scenes.</P>
<P>     As long as the hijacking is in progress, the film seems fresh,
fun, and original.  But once the terrorists crash-land and begin trying
to find the suitcases, things take a decided turn for the worst.  This
happens in two ways: first, although there is a surfeit of running
around, shooting and hiding, there seems a remarkable paucity of
mountain climbing.  Perhaps this is because Stallone looks nothing at
all like a mountain climber (and in fact looks absolutely ridiculous as
he pulls his way up the side of a cliff in one of the rare climbing
scenes); perhaps it's because the filmmakers decided that mountain
climbing -- being a slow and deliberate process that can't be quick-cut
edited into random places in the film -- just wouldn't be exciting
enough for their supposedly jaded audience.  If so, they made a
terrible mistake.  One need only sit with an audience watching the IMAX
film TO THE LIMIT to realize the profound effect real mountain climbing
can have on people who rarely take the stairs at their places of work,
let alone set out to scale the side of a cliff.  Certainly we've all
seen people shooting at each other with automatic weapons; given the
choice between a clever (but relatively bloodless) cat-and-mouse chase
up and across perilous cliffs, and the usual mindless Hollywood
violence, I suspect people would much rather pay to see the former.</P>
<P>     What we get, however, is the latter.  The "running around and
shooting" portion of the film is CLIFFHANGER's third sub-plot, and it
is without a doubt the weakest, if only because it is the least
original and most mean-spirited of the three.  I mentioned above that
once the terrorists crash-land, things take a turn for the worst in two
ways, and as this third sub-plot unfolds, we quickly discover that as
lively and as fresh the first half of the film seemed, the second
becomes just as mean-spirited and vicious.  I thought this incredibly
unfortunate, partly because I'd believed we'd left such inane violence
and cruelty behind us in the films of the late eighties, and partly
because it seems so much at odds with the film's beautiful natural
surroundings.  It's one thing for Bruce Willis to pump dozens of rounds
of automatic weapon fire into a terrorist in a high-tech office
building in 1988; it's another thing to watch this same scene unfold
beneath delicately snow-capped trees and in front of breath-taking
natural vistas.  Nature is not without its own kind of violence and
cruelty, but Wild Kingdom this is not.</P>
<P>     This third sub-plot is also greatly weakened by some of the
sloppiest editing I've seen this year.  To be honest, much of the last
half-hour of the film simply doesn't make sense -- it seemed to me that
CLIFFHANGER had been hacked down to its 118-minute running time from an
original film of much greater length, and given that the screenplay (at
any length) was never a paragon of logic, this editing rendered the end
of the film nearly incomprehensible.  Too many scenes simply exist in a
vacuum -- we often have no feeling for how Stallone or the terrorists
got from one cliff to another, or where any individual location is in
relation to any other.  The film does feature one character who walks
around with an electronic suitcase-finder; too bad he doesn't also have
a continuity-finder, for at times we feel about as lost and abandoned
as those suitcases.</P>
<P>     This lack of continuity reaches its nadir when Stallone attempts
to follow the terrorists across a foot bridge between two cliffs.  The
scene is featured prominently in the film's advertising, and those of
us who saw the ads expect Stallone to make it most of the way, trigger
an explosion, and then leap to safety at the last moment.  At least we
expect a stunt double to do this.  Or $5 million worth of T2-style
computer animation.  Something, anyway.  But in fact what happens is
that Stallone jumps *back* to the cliff whence he came.  While this may
seem marginally more plausible, it does pose a small problem: sans a
telephone booth nearby (into which Stallone might run to don his
Superman outfit so as to fly across the chasm), it's not clear how the
pursuit of the terrorists will continue.</P>
<P>     But continue it does, of course, logic be damned.  That kind of
contempt for an audience's intelligence really bothers me, since it's
so unnecessary.  It's one thing to ask us to believe that Treasury
planes fly around with suitcases full of thousand-dollar bills; perhaps
they do.  But how can we be expected to buy a chase scene set in the
mountains that -- somehow -- never involves any mountain-climbing?
Putting people on a ledge is inherently dramatic; having them run
around shooting each other (or worse, beating each other up in ways
that make the ROCKY films look tame in comparison) is not.</P>
<P>     That said, it's clear that much of the action is diverting and
generally entertaining, especially if you can turn your brain off after
buying your popcorn and soda.  (My feeling is that something like this
happened as soon as Stallone rolled blank paper into his typewriter.)
The scenery upstages everything, even Stallone's lovingly photographed
and scantily clad body.  The special effects are usually very good, but
often they don't look particularly convincing, perhaps because the
two-dimensional characters, awful dialogue, and incoherent plot keep us
from fully suspending disbelief.  Or perhaps because they're just not
consistently good (as the special effects in T2 were).  Scenes that
were shot indoors look like they were shot indoors, especially one in
which Stallone chases the film's plausibility out on to thin ice.
(Hint: only he survives.)  The situation might have been helped had
Stallone himself ever gone near a step ladder, let alone a mountain;
less optical printing and more actual rock climbing might have left
more money for better special effects used less frequently.  As it is,
all of the scenes set on cliffs -- and that were actually filmed
outdoors, rather than simulated on a sound stage -- utilize stunt
doubles, and most are filmed from quite a distance.  A nice close-up or
two of Stallone actually on a cliff might have helped lend some
authenticity to the proceedings.  But as he's afraid of heights, that
wasn't a possibility, so the burden of making a realistic-looking film
was pushed off on to the many special effects houses involved with the
production.</P>
<P>     Rooker and Turner are largely wasted; in fact, it wasn't clear to
me why their characters were written into the screenplay in the first
place.  Remember that John McClane's wife in DIE HARD served no purpose
other than to be taken hostage; yet although Turner plays side-kick to
Stallone throughout much of the film, she's allowed to do little more
than dilute the film's focus.  And when it comes to focus, CLIFFHANGER
seems more than a little astigmatic -- the last thing Stallone needs
are two other "good guys" getting caught up underfoot, doing little
more than showcasing his inability to act.</P>
<P>     CLIFFHANGER opened when it did for a reason: faced with
competition from JURASSIC PARK and LAST ACTION HERO, Tri Star wisely
opted for an otherwise action-adventure-free weekend, at least three
weeks before the two biggest summer draws were scheduled to open.  With
competition coming only from a handful of light spring comedies,
CLIFFHANGER is bound to do well at the box office.  But come August,
when people may well be seeing the best of this summer's blockbusters
for a second and third time, I doubt if anyone but Carolco's bankruptcy
attorneys will remember this strictly-by-the-numbers film.</P>
