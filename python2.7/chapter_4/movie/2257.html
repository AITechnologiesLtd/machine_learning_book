<PRE>                            ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Anjelica Huston, Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Cusack,
           Christina Ricci, Jimmy Workman.
Screenplay:  Paul Rudnick.
Director:  Barry Sonnenfeld.</P>
<P>     There were plenty of things surrounding the first ADDAMS FAMILY
film that I hated more than the film itself: its undeserved status as
blockbuster; the stupendously annoying theme song by Hammer; endless
iterations of the word "ooky" in print.  1991's THE ADDAMS FAMILY was
not a terrible film.  It was high-spirited and gleefully performed.  It
simply exhausted its premise after about fifteen minutes.  ADDAMS
FAMILY VALUES is lots more of the same, which means that its premise is
exhausted before it begins.  Yet it's both worse and better than its
predecessor, the latter the result of Christina Ricci's marvelously
morbid Wednesday.</P>
<P>     ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES opens with Morticia (Anjelica Huston) giving
birth to the newest Addams: baby Pubert, a mustachioed dead ringer for
papa Gomez (Raul Julia).  This development does not sit at all well
with Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman), who
believe that the arrival of a new child means an old one has to go.  To
help manage the children, the Addams Family hires nanny Debbie
Jellinsky (Joan Cusack), who turns out to be a homicidal golddigger out
for Uncle Fester's (Christopher Lloyd) money.  When the kids become
suspicious, Debbie has them sent away to an upscale summer camp,
leaving her to win over Fester and turn him agains the family.</P>
<P>     Like many recent megasequels, ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES meticulously
recreates the original, element for element.  Carol Kane replaces Judy
Malina as Granny, but the rest of the family cast is back in place.
The script is once again largely a collection of black-humored sight
gags and one-liners, and the theme song is again rap (a slightly
altered version of Tag Team's excruciating hit "Whoomp! (There It
Is)").  Even the title design is the same; "no surprises" is clearly
the motto in place.  The only real question is, is it funny, and as in
the case of THE ADDAMS FAMILY the answer is "sometimes."  There aren't
as many laughs as there were in the original, but the laughs that do
come are bigger.  There's a great photo among the shots of Debbie's
previous disguises, and the summer camp play is an anarchic riot.  What
almost never worked for me were the jokes in the "setup ... macabre
retort" format.  I kept wanting to yell out, "All right, they're weird,
I get the point."</P>
<P>     VALUES is broken into three almost entirely unrelated subplots
(not that plot is an issue here).  The Pubert plot is basically an
excuse for a series of elaborate attempts by Wednesday and Pugsley to
do away with the baby, and later for some "normal baby" jokes.  The
Debbie/Uncle Fester plot is extremely sluggish; Joan Cusack tries
gamely, but doesn't quite click as the villainous black widow.  The
biggest surprise may be that Gomez and Morticia play a very small role
in the proceedings.  They get a nice, goofy dance sequence, but for
most of the film Raul Julia only reacts, while Anjelica Huston spends
her time hitting lighting marks so that her eyes and cheekbones appear
translucent.</P>
<P>     The upside of the senior Addams' diminished role is that the
larger part is given to Christina Ricci.  The summer camp subplot is
far and away the best, and Ricci is a demonic delight.  She has a lot
to work with: a nerdy would-be boyfriend; the unbearably
up-with-everything camp counselors; a debutante rival (Mercedes McNab,
who played the Girl Scout in the first film).  Ricci spits out her
lines with comic venom, and provides most of VALUES' highlights.</P>
<P>     The easiest conclusion to reach about ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES is that
it will probably please those it was made to please, the same folks who
brought over $100 million to THE ADDAMS FAMILY.  If you didn't like the
original formula, there's little to inspire a change of heart the
second time around.  Cheers to Christina Ricci, but I hope her contract
doesn't demand another sequel.  She deserves better.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 uses of "ooky": 5.</PRE>
