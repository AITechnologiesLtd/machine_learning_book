<P>PEEPING TOM (director: Michael Powell; cast: Carl Boehm (Mark), Moira
Shearer (stand-in murder victim), Anna Massey (Anna), 1960-GB)</P>
<P>Can you imagine that this innovative, creative film, a groundbreaker
for its time, managed to virtually end the career of its great and
noted director, as the subject's sexual content was too much to take
for so many of the self-righteous critics of that time!  This is a
film about Scoptophilia (voyeurism): the morbid urge to gaze, or as it
is more commonly called, being a peeping Tom.</P>
<P>Mark Lewis (Carl) is a cameraman with a great psychological problem,
he is fixated on taking pictures of females, bringing on a fear in
them by pointing a spear at them, then having them watch themselves in
a mirror as he kills them. His father was a scientist, who
experimented with Mark when he was young, by filming him constantly,
shining lights in his eyes to wake him from sleep, throwing lizards in
his bed, and always testing his young son to see how he reacts to
fear.  When Mark's mother dies, the father (Michael Powell plays this
part in the home movies shown) quickly remarries, upsetting the
youngster, even further. He gives Mark a camera as a gift, and this
starts Mark's obsession with voyeurism.</P>
<P>When his father dies, Mark inherits the house, which he rents out to
an assortment of tenants.  Coming home one evening, a 21st birthday
party is being given for one of the tenants, Helen (Anna), who is
strangely attracted to this very shy, awkward man, who she doesn't
realize is the landlord. She visits him in his apartment and he takes
her into his darkroom and shows her his ghastly home movies. And, even
though, he acts very peculiar, she remains interested in him, and he
shows that he likes her and will not harm her.</P>
<P>Meanwhile there is a murder that occurs in the same style as the
previous one reported in the newspapera, where the victim has died
with a dreaded look of fear, this one takes place in the film studio
where he works as a focuser, which brings in the police to
investigate. On his other job, where he works for a newstand dealer,
he takes pictures of models who pose for him in sexually alluring
ways. He murders one of the models knowing full well that the police
are tailing him. He even films the police as they are closing in to
catch him. He says that this is all part of the documentary he is
shooting.</P>
<P>Mark Lewis is this pathetically gentle psychopath, who has a
compulsion to kill, brought on by his early childhood years, who
cannot even be saved by love, as his compulsion to kill and die is
stronger than anything else. This fascinating film is as intensely
good as any thriller done by Hitchcock or Chabrol. Its intensity and
compelling characterization of Mark, is a landmark in films.</P>
