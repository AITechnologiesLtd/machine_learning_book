<P>     After seeing the 4 hour version of Hamlet, I feel I ve seen something
special. Kenneth Branagh shines when doing Shakespeare ( a shine that s
not so bright for his other films ) and this film is certainly an
accomplishment. To do a Shakespeare play is not something to take lightly.
A Shakespeare film can be either very inspiring or very painful. But
Kenneth Branagh does it well and with understanding, aiding in
understanding, inspiration and humor. </P>
<P>     Kenneth has put to film the other Shakespeare plays Henry V and Much
Ado About Nothing, the later being my favorite except maybe till now. Many
things make this film special, the rich sets, the costumes, the
interracial superb actors, the humor ( of which there is a lot of in
Shakespeare plays including the tragedies ), but most of all the full text
version of Hamlet. It s great to see Fortinbras, and hear Hamlet realize
how insignificant his worries are when these other horrors exist ( this
was an impressive and fantastic way to start the intermission ). To see
what happened after Hamlet died. To see Fortinbras place himself on the
throne, signifying that the tragedy did not end here but extended out to
the whole kingdom. To hear the confirmation from Horatio and Fortinbras
that his story would be told and heard by all including those in power,
England included. ( did these people exist? Was this play based on
history? Was all the text used? It seems to me that some of the text is
missing. <A HREF="mailto:antpage@aol.com">antpage@aol.com</A> )</P>
<P>     Although it s almost the longest movie in history ( Cleopatra still
holds that title ) I feel the time passed by quickly ( I heard people say
this in the theater too ), as a matter of fact, I felt it needed to be
longer. Because through out the film it seems that everyone is running
through the text, some of it expressed well, some not. That s why I feel
this play is best suited for video or mini-series, to give enough time to
express the play the way it deserves. Clearly this was another time, maybe
people loved to hear the words, had longer attention spans. I like to
imagine how they might have done it back in those days, gracefully
expressing their emotion, story, poetry and musings on life, taking there
time unworried about the length. I don t think they had there noses in the
air with too much nobility and flair and strong voices going through an
emotionless play, Branagh included the scene were Hamlet instructs them in
how to give the play, an intriguing and fascinating look into Shakespeare
s mind on how he might have done it back then.  But I thought it was
innovative the way Branagh would show them going through the first part of
the text in one scene and then fade out to another and finish the text
suggesting time had passed between ( the scene with Laertes and Ophelia
before he leaves ). Also the rich location were they shot the film was an
aid, if it got to be to much your eye would dwell on the rich
surroundings, the beautiful furnishings, which would bring you back to the
story. Also the movement of the camera. </P>
<P>     But I feel that Branagh may have catered to much to the general
public, and may not have given the play full justice by running through
the text and not fully expressing all the words and emotions involved in
the text. A good example of someone who took their time was Franco
Zeffirelli, his Hamlet released in 1990. Although he had to cut out quite
a lot of it. If you like Branagh s I highly recommend you see this one
too, available for rent.</P>
<P>     All in all this is a fantastic film. I was surprised Branagh could
play Hamlet with such humor. The location and costumes were an excellent
idea for the play. The acting top notch. The music beautiful, in synch
with the film and unobtrusive. Billy Crystal s scene was one of the most
hilarious scene s in the film. Many scene s brought tears to your eyes if
not streaming down your checks ( like the scene with Hamlet describing his
father to his mother ). A wonderful film I hope it does well. In a rating
of 1 to 5 stars ( 1 being avoid it, 4 being excellent and 5 being all time
classic ) I give this 4 stars.</P>
