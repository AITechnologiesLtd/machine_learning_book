<P>     As movie-goers, we expect different things from big-budget summer=20
blockbusters than we do from "normal" films.  Considerations of theme=20
and character become secondary to action and mind-numbing excitement. =20
The plot is expected to be very basic -- only complex enough to frame=20
the spills and chills.  JURASSIC PARK is a perfect example of this sort=20
of thing, as is last year's DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE.  This year's=20
first entry is the eye-popping, ear-blasting TWISTER, Jan De Bont's=20
violent weather follow-up to SPEED.</P>
<P>     TWISTER, which follows a team of tornado chasers as they track down=20
storms, is exciting, if a little shallow.  This particular disaster=20
movie, which pits man against an implacable, unstoppable enemy, owes as=20
much to GODZILLA and JURASSIC PARK as to THE TOWERING INFERNO and THE=20
POSEIDON ADVENTURE.  It's a perfect motion picture roller coaster --=20
fun, fast, and furious=85 as long as you don't think too hard.</P>
<P>     In real life, violent weather can be both terrifying and=20
exhilarating.  There's nothing quite like standing in the path of a=20
monster storm, even if it earns you the label of having a death wish (in=20
fact, it's the possibility of death that gets the adrenaline pumping). =20
TWISTER tries, with limited success, to capture that sensation.  There=20
are times when the tornado strikes seem a little too "glamorized" by the=20
special effects gurus, but, in general, these ILM-fashioned monsters=20
generate enough awe to make us feel that we're watching the "finger of=20
God."</P>
<P>     In real life, tornado chasing has a higher percentage of misses=20
than sightings, so the fact that every expedition in TWISTER unearths a=20
powerful storm comes across as a too-obvious-to-miss plot contrivance. =20
Not that we really care.  De Bont keeps things moving, and, except for a=20
few feeble character-building scenes, our heroes are on the road=20
speeding after, or away from, spinning devastation.</P>
<P>     TWISTER opens with a short prologue in June 1969.  It's one of the=20
film's most effective sequences, as a family of three flees into a=20
shelter to escape an oncoming storm.  The father is killed, sucked into=20
the vortex while his wife and five-year old daughter, Jo,  watch.  More=20
than twenty-five years later, that little girl has grown up to be a=20
tornado chaser.  Played by Helen Hunt, Jo is obsessed with increasing=20
the pre-storm warning time.  Accompanied by her old partner and soon-to-
be-ex-husband, Bill Harding (Bill Paxton), her usual crew, and Bill's=20
fiancee (Jami Gertz), Jo is about to try out "Dorothy", a specially-
built instrument designed to spit out data from inside the vortex.  So,=20
in the midst of "the biggest series of storms in 12 years", Jo and Bill=20
hit the road, vying with a rival scientist (Cary Elwes) to reach each=20
new storm first.</P>
<P>     Apparently, nature doesn't make a good enough villain, so the=20
writers of TWISTER decided to add some nasty human rivals. =20
Unfortunately, Cary Elwes' character is both unnecessary and irritating;=20
the tornadoes are enough.  Equally superfluous are the romantic=20
complications in the relationship between Jo and Bill.  It's a rather=20
boring subplot, and, if these two had been together from the beginning=20
(they are married, albeit almost divorced), we would have been spared=20
the presence of Jami Gertz'  unappealing character.</P>
<P>     Author Michael Crichton, not relying on one of his ultra-popular=20
bestsellers, dips into his bag of tricks to come up with a completely=20
artificial plot.  Without De Bont's energetic direction, the seams in=20
Crichton's script (which was co-written with his wife, Anne-Marie=20
Martin) would have been more apparent.  Fortunately, the film's fast=20
pace and stunning audio/visual elements camouflage the deficiencies. =20
And it helps that both Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, while not "major"=20
stars, are likable and share a pleasant camaraderie.  They're our guides=20
through tornado territory, and we need their stability with De Bont=20
throwing everything at us -- including the kitchen.</P>
<P>     TWISTER is peppered with bits of information about how to react if=20
a tornado approaches, how dangerous the storms can be, etc.  Despite=20
these snippets of safety-conscious advice, the movie doesn't function as=20
a public service announcement, nor should it.  TWISTER doesn't have any=20
pretensions.  It is what it sets out to be:  an effective piece of big=20
money, early summer entertainment designed to blow viewers away.</P>
