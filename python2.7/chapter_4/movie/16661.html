Fallen Angels (Reviewed on Feb. 11/99)</PRE>
<P>Wong Kar-Wei's "Fallen Angels" is, on a purely visceral level, one of the
most exciting films I've seen in a long while.  Unfortunately, Wong seems
more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible
characters for the audience to root for.</P>
<P>Ordinarily, that alone would be enough to sink a movie, but in the case of
"Fallen Angels", this is not so.  Every shot in this film is exciting just
to *look* at.  Wong does really interesting things with the camera, but he
doesn't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over, as was the case
with last years dismal "Knock Off" (which contained a shot of a foot
entering a shoe.  Ugh.)</P>
<P>The movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some
meaning in their lives.  I can't say much more than that as I didn't
really know what was going on most of the time.  In fact, it wasn't until
about halfway through the movie that I was able to distinguish between
each character.  The constantly moving camera doesn't really allow for
the audience to associate with any one character.  We're always kept at a
distance from these people, I suppose in order to further add to the
feeling of alienation felt by the characters.</P>
<P>"Fallen Angels" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most Hollywood films,
which never bother to try anything different, at least on a visual level. 
In fact, I'd go so far as to say that "Fallen Angels" is more challenging
visually than any mainstream Hollywood film I've ever seen.  Sure, there's
directors like Robert Rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic
orgies of death, but to see a filmmaker like Wong who actually assaults
the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating.  </P>
<P>But if Wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker, he needs to work on
incorporating an actual story into those awesome images.  There were far
too many instances during "Fallen Angels" in which I asked myself, "now
who are these people again?  Is this that first couple or the second
couple?"  It was impossible to keep track.  Perhaps he could let the
audience know right away which character is which, by introducing them to
us with "name cards", as in Scorsese's "Mean Streets".</P>
<P>That's really besides the point, though.  Wong Kar-Wei has proven himself,
through very few films, that's he's a movie-maker to watch.  Let's just
hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies.</P>
