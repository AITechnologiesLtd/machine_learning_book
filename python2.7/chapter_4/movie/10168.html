<P>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997)</P>
<P>Seen on 27 November 1997 with Linda, Sandy and Lynne, and Miriam and
Justin, for $8.50 at Douglaston Movieworld. </P>
<PRE>[Longer review than usual.]</PRE>
<P>What's that old adage again? Ah yes! "The movie is never as good as the
book."  Truer words were never recalled as fiercely as they are for
*Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil*. Director Clint Eastwood was
lucky enough to get ahold of a novel that was on bestsellers lists for
years. It is unfortunate that the deep impression left upon me by the book
leaves me disappointed with this movie, which is longer than two and a
half hours. </P>
<P>John Berendt's novel is written much like a Balzac novel--rich in history,
very much roman a clef, and it is not until all the players and their
stories are firmly in place that the "main action" or crisis for the
characters begins. </P>
<P>In this case, it is the shooting of young Billy Hanson (Jude Law) by
nouveau riche Savannah aristocrat Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). On the eve
of this event arrives *Town and Country* writer John Kelso (John Cusack),
to cover Jim's annual Christmas party, one of the most highly sought-out
invitations in Savannah society.</P>
<P>John becomes enmeshed in a variety of social intrigues and the quirky
Southern characters that propel them. There's Luther Driggers (Geoffrey
Lewis), who ties horseflies to his clothes and threatens to poison the
water supply; carriage-driving Joe Odom (Paul Hipp), who siphons
electricity to light his illegal tours and parties; Minerva (Irma P.
Hall), the local voodoo lady;  and who will ever forget The Lady Chablis
(played by herself)--the transvestite transsexual? </P>
<P>There are also other ancillary quirkies to keep us entertained: the party
guest who blithely waves a pint-sized pistol around; the man who "walks"
an empty leash around the town square; the bulldog mascot that is treated
like royalty. </P>
<P>All of this conspires to give an essence of living in Savannah; Berendt's
book is based on true characters. However, what made the book interesting
is absent in many ways in the movie. A book allows the luxury of depth and
imagination heightens that depth. Movies limit this. </P>
<P>The film spends a lot of time in the courtroom when Jim Williams is
arrested for killing hustler Billy Hanson. It is known that he did kill
him, but the depth of *why* is not really explored from anyone but Jim
William's point of view. Instead of spending time court telling the story,
flashbacks would have been more elaborative--a movie technique ignored for
the most part. A Rashomon style storytelling would have added to the
extent of Billy's despicable nature.</P>
<P>Also rather uninteresting was the filming. Considering how colorful the
characters and the town are, why is there a dull, flat look throughout the
movie? At one point, the courtroom scenes almost look like they relied on
natural lighting. </P>
<P>The Lady Chablis is the standout performance here. Flambuoyant and
buoyant, without her the movie would simply limp its way home. Also
interesting was Jack Thompson (I) as defense attorney Sonny Seiler, the
epitome of Southern gentility and chicanery. Alison Eastwood (Clint's
daughter) plays Mandy Nichols, who seems thrown in to provide a love
interest for John Cusack. She plays one useful purpose in the story, but
is otherwise wasted. She will probably make a good leading lady in her own
right one day, however.</P>
<P>The saddest part of this adaptation is that it is the the possibly the
first book about the South to garner this much attention since *Gone with
the Wind*, and it gets a typical Hollywood treatment that proves the "old
adage" once again. </P>
