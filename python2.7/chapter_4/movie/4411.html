<PRE>                                  JUMANJI
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1995 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: A diabolical board game unleashes a
          world of action, adventure, and horror in a
          surprisingly satisfying family film.  One at a time
          the game releases the threats from a story-book
          African safari into a small New England town.  This
          could have been played for laughs, but a generally
          witty and well-written script turns this film into
          a real action ride.  Rating: +2 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     I was not expecting big things from JUMANJI.  The coming
attractions make it look like taking the basic concept of HELLRAISER--
the plaything that releases a world of horror--and crossing it with
something like THE ZEBRA IN THE KITCHEN, where animals on the loose
cause havoc.  And in the final analysis perhaps that is not too
inaccurate a description.  But there is considerably more wit and a
whole lot more style to this tale.  After an opening scene in the 1860s
with two children trying desperately to rid themselves of a mysterious
box, it is rediscovered in 1969 by Alan Parrish.  Parrish (played by
Adam Hann-Byrd) has problems enough.  He is bullied by his peers and
dominated by a dictatorial father who seems to run much of the town and
cannot relate to a child.  But young Alan does not know trouble until
he plays the game and on his first move is sucked into "the jungle"
where he remains for twenty-six years.  Only it really is a jungle and
twenty-six years really does pass.  The disappearance remains an
unsolved mystery.  And with a whiff of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, much of
the town has degenerated as a result.  Now a new family has moved into
the house, Aunt Nora (Bebe Neuwirth) and the recently orphaned Judy
(Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce).  The two children
unwittingly start the game again and release (among other things) the
missing Alan (now played by Robin Williams).  Unfortunately, each roll
of the dice also releases some safari hazard into the real world.  Most
of these dangers escape the house and into the town.  Like the towns in
GREMLINS or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, it is slowly to coming to realize
that something strange and very dangerous is happening.  And the only
way to save the town is to finish the game so all the horrors can
return to the game board.  Yet with each roll of the dice some new
disaster escapes the game into the real world.  Each might be bad, but
the cumulative effect is startling.</P>
<P>     The visual effects from Industrial Light and Magic are impressive
but not altogether realistic.  The digitized animals are clearly just
that and in addition, the monkeys look more like Curious George than
real monkeys.  They are never totally convincing but as storybook
safari dangers they work just fine.  This is a film in which many
scenes involving the magic of the game have a very nice look.</P>
<P>     The visuals could overwhelm the characters, but the script by
Jonathan Hensleigh, Greg Taylor, and Jim Strain, based on the book by
Chris Van Allsburg, never lets that happen.  After a shaky start with
Robin Williams looking like the castaway from "Monty Python's Flying
Circus," he gives some real humanity to his role and does not indulge
in the usual Williams schtick.  Kirsten Dunst is fairly good but
JUMANJI must be child's play after her meaty performance in INTERVIEW
WITH THE VAMPIRE.  Bebe Neuwirth manages some nice touches as Aunt
Nora.  It is the kind of role that usually goes unnoticed--friendly
adult supervision in a film for children--but someone in the script
department was looking out for her.  Joe Johnston was a good choice for
director with a sense for integrating human performances with visual
effects.  He was the art director for visual effects on THE EMPIRE
STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI.  As director he made HONEY, I
SHRUNK THE KIDS and the underrated ROCKETEER.  He manages very well
here, though his direction was weakened for me by some slapstick late
in the movie.</P>
<P>     Parents should be warned that just the horror touches that will
delight ten-year-olds will be strong stuff for five-year-olds.  Adults
are warned not to not to leave children at the theater or they may miss
out on the fun.  I give this one a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
