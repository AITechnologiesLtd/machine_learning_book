<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P> People will compare it to My Dinner with Andre.  They will inevitably
be wrong.  People will assume that it has something to do with Daylight
Savings Time.  They, too, will be wrong.  People will assume that just
because Michael Stipe executive produced this film, it will end up
seeming like Being John Malkovich.  They, too, will be wrong.  In point
of fact Spring Forward is that rare gem, a film with no brothers or
sisters to deal with, no son to look down upon or father to look up to.
In the family tree of American cinema, the most Spring Forward can have
are a few distant cousins.</P>
<P> So what is Spring Forward?  Simply put, Spring Forward is unique.  It
is not unique in the sense of Being John Malkovich or Spectres of the
Spectrum (a uniqueness tainted with the surreal), but instead unique in
the point of fact that it a movie that has no plot, that has no
centralized point or purpose… that has nothing but characters.  The
characters are Murph (Ned Beatty, switching back into his serious,
pre-Naked Gun days) and Paul (Schreiber), two city parks department
workers in Connecticut who spend one year talking while on the job.</P>
<P> The film starts in Spring, when Paul starts his first job after getting
out of prison.  It ends a year later, when Murph leaves his job for
retirement.  Paul is a bookworm.  Murph has common sense.  Paul is
philosophical.  Murph is practical.  The two characters are in almost
every single way opposed to each other, except for the fact that they
are both incredibly charismatic.  This mutual charisma incites Paul and
Murph to form a sort of paternal bond, and for the rest of the movie,
with sit in quiet contention and complete fascination as we listen to
some of the most brilliant conversation ever captured on screen.</P>
<P>Writer-director Tom Gilroy, an actor himself, created a true actor's
haven.  He unleashed Schreiber and Beatty not only on the audiences, but
on each other, and the result is the kind of completely natural
interaction that you run across in real life.  The dialogue is sharp,
the direction on-target.  But that is not what makes Spring Forward
incredible.</P>
<P> As a film, what makes Spring Forward so absolutely incredible is its
ability to challenge the audience.  As I sit and think about the one
small problem that Spring Forward has, pacing (if the characters are
ever silent, you begin to glance at your watch), I realize that the fate
of Spring Forward is not in it's stars, or its director or producers,
but in ourselves.  Spring Forward is a movie that, having no narrative,
lives entirely in the gray.  When you perceive Spring Forward as slow,
you lose sight of the fact that, in order for a movie to be either slow
or fast, it must be moving in the first place.  Spring Forward does not
move.  Spring Forward does not progress.  Spring Forward simply is.</P>
<P> And, provided you can let go of conventional thought long enough to
enjoy Spring Forward's just being there, Spring Forward simply is worth
every second you spend in the theatre.</P>
<PRE>4.5 stars</PRE>
