<PRE>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A>
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>Somewhere between hardcore and softcore pornography lies … well, Lies, a
bold, button-pushing film from Jang Sun Woo, the reigning bad boy of
Korean cinema.  His latest is about the sadomasochistic relationship
between a high school virgin and her older lover.  The film is based on
Jung-Il Chang's novel (adapted by Jang), which has been banned in Korea.</P>
<P>Lies would have been creepy enough left to its own devices, but Jang
uses a bunch of interesting cinematic techniques to make the film look
and feel like a documentary about defiling a naïve girl.  Both principal
actors are making their screen debuts, and their characters are only
known by their first initials.  Lies contains documentary-style
interviews with both actors, and each provides narration throughout
portions of the film.</P>
<P>Tae Yeon Kim plays Y, an 18-year-old high school virgin who wants to get
laid before her graduation.  Through her best friend Woori (Hye Jin
Jeon), she is introduced to a 38-year-old artist named J (Sang Hyun
Lee).  Woori is in love with J and his art, but she's too embarrassed to
make advances toward the married sculptor.  Instead, Woori makes her
friend call J, and she finds herself living vicariously through the
colorful acts of phone sex that Y has with J.</P>
<P>Y and J eventually agree to meet in person, and the two perform every
carnal act imaginable.  Lies pulls no punches here, showing it all as Y
is violated in every orifice.  Jang even uses some clever title cards to
announce which cavity J is about to fill (`The First Hole,' `The Second
Hole,' and so forth).</P>
<P>The dialogue isn't any less crass than the visuals.  J rudely
announces,  `I'm going in,' before invading one of Y's nooks.  When he's
trying to get her backside to loosen up, he advises her to `think of my
dick as shit – that'll make it easier.'  He also paws at her private
parts like a monkey looking for bugs.</P>
<P>Strangely, Y seems game for everything, cooing, `I like anything that J
does' to the enraptured Woori.  When J introduces beatings to their
sexual routine, she still doesn't freak out, claiming, `My ass is
killing me, but this is great!'  The whippings increase in severity, and
it isn't long before Y's brother (Kwon Taek Han) begins to get
suspicious about her sister's violent older lover.</P>
<P>Lies is disturbing cinema at either its best or worst form, depending on
where you stand on the issue of perversity in modern cinema.  It's great
that Jang was able to produce such an unflinching look at the bizarre
sexual relationship between two obviously unstable people, but other
than raising both eyebrows and trousers, I'm not too sure what his point
was.</P>
<P>1:52 – Not Rated but contains nudity, strong sexual content, violence
and adult language</P>
