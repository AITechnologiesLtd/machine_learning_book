<PRE>Girl, Interrupted (1999, R)</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by James Mangold</PRE>
<P>Written by James Mangold, Lisa Loomer, and Anne Hamilton Phelan</P>
<PRE>Based on the memoir by Susanna Kaysen</PRE>
<P>Starring Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy,
Elizabeth Moss, Whoopi Goldberg, and Vanessa Redgrave</P>
<P> As near as I can tell, the 60s were about being crazy.  Whether it was
being crazy while fighting communists in Vietnam, or being crazy while
burning bras, or being crazy while marching on Washington, the 60s
resounded with insanity.  So what better way to tell the story of the
60s than from within the walls of a mental ward known as Claymoore?
Hence is the promise given to us in the ads of Girl, Interrupted.</P>
<PRE> The reality is a bit different.</PRE>
<P> In the reality, the 60s are little more than a backdrop, an added
boo-hoo to an already lengthy list of depression.  The decade is briefly
touched upon.  It is only mentioned in the sense of the possibility of
someone being drafted for the Vietnam War.</P>
<P> The rest of the movie is basically a One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest in
an all-female ward.</P>
<P> Unlike One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest, which focused very strongly on
patients rights, Girl, Interrupted gets stuck in the same crisis as its
protagonist (Suzanne, played by Winona Ryder): it is unable to decide
what to do with itself.</P>
<P> Stuck inside of Claymoore, we have an all-female cast of characters
that range from the ultra-bizarre to the downright surreal.  We have
Borderline Personality Suzanne, Sociopath Lisa (Angelina Jolie),
Compulsive Liar Georgina (Clea DuVall), Chicken-Fetishist Daisy
(Brittany Murphy), and half-burned Polly (Elizabeth Moss).  Add to this
bit roles by Whoopi Goldberg as a much more fun Nurse Ratchett and
Vanessa Redgrave as a psychiatrist rumored to have same-sex tendencies,
and you have the makings of a great comedy with mild touches of
seriousness.  However, Girl, Interrupted's director James Mangold (Cop
Land) never quite figures that out.  Instead, he vacillates between
making a movie that takes itself too seriously and a movie that doesn't
take itself seriously at all.</P>
<P> Regardless, Mangold is able to pull off the difficult task of making an
insane-asylum movie that does not feel overwhelmingly political.  As a
result of its ability to not meddle in patients rights or politics,
Girl, Interrupted ends up being beyond the highly bearable that it could
have ended up as.  Going out on a limb, I will state that the film is
even moderately enjoyable.</P>
<P> Angelina Jolie works wonders in her role as a sociopath, giving a
performance that makes you absolutely believe in the amorality of her
character.  Winona Ryder, on the other hand, proves that she and Keanu
Reeves would make a great couple, for they both have about the same
amount of thespian ability.  Clea DuVall once again proves to be a
darling up-and-comer.</P>
<P> Despite these mixed performances (a bad main role and a great
supporting cast), Girl, Interrupted still results in being an incredibly
unfocused film.  This may be due to the fact that the film springs from
Suzanne's journal, which she describes as "the litter of her mind."  In
the end of it all, this is what hurts the film the most.  Coming out of
the theatre, you feel like Suzanne coming out of Claymoore: confused,
slightly empty, and mixed up.</P>
<PRE>2.5 stars</PRE>
