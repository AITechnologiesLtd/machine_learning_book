The Sweet Hereafter ****</PRE>
<PRE>Summary:</PRE>
<P>A small Canadian town copes with a terrible tragedy when a school bus
slips off an icy road and plunges into a river killing most of the
children on board. A lawyer, Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) arrives
shortly after to convince the suffering parents that they should sue
for damages. Who exactly they should sue is not a concern for Stephens
yet. He will blame someone.</P>
<P>Stephens interviews the parents and survivors with varied success to
his cause.  Most of the parents, including Delores Driscoll (Gabrielle
Rose) the bus driver who survived the crash, join Stephens in his
lawsuit. Others are not so convinced, including Billy Ansell (Bruce
Greenwood) who lost both of his children and refuses to help, feeling
that the lawsuit will divide the once peaceful community, and Nicole
Burnell (Sarah Polley) a survivor now confined to a wheelchair.</P>
<P>Stephens' case is also hindered by his own personal turmoil. His
daughter Zoe (Caerthan Banks) is a drug abuser who has been through
(and dropped out of) countless rehab centers and clinics. Through
frantic phone calls at inopportune times, Stephens learns that his
daughter is in serious trouble. In effect, Stephens anguish is similar
to that of the parents in his lawsuit. He is dealing with the loss of
a child.</P>
<PRE>Commentary:</PRE>
<P>Atom Egoyan is an impressive director. The Sweet Hereafter is similar
to his previous work - 'Exotica' in many ways. From his non-linear
form of storytelling to his beautiful, long shots of landscapes (The
rugged snowy mountain in this film and the big grassy prairie in
'Exotica' are great examples). Many people (my wife included) felt the
bouncing time line a bit distracting, but I felt that it was effective
and that it enhanced the story.</P>
<P>Dealing with grief and loss is the major issue with this film. Egoyan
skillfully introduces the characters and reveals how they are dealing
with the tragedy.  Very painful, touching and sometimes disturbing
memories unfold, as secrets of the inhabitants in the town are
revealed. Adding to the poignancy of the story is the wonderful
narration of a Robert Browning poem "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" (where
the film gets its title), drawing similarities between Nicole and a
character in the poem.</P>
<P>This is an impressive ensemble cast, even though there are no big name
actors in this film (except Holm). Most noteworthy Sarah Polley (the
Boston Society of Film critics gave her their award for Best
Supporting Actress), who not only portrays the courageous moral center
of the film very well, but also wrote and performed most of the songs
on the soundtrack. She deserves an Academy Award nomination.</P>
<P>The Sweet Hereafter leaves many loose ends and questions unanswered,
most notably the situation with Stephens daughter. It is unlikely that
a film like this could possibly have a happy ending, but a lesser film
could easily have forced some kind of resolution or closure to some
(or even all) of the characters. Egoyan trusts his audience. This is
one of the best films I have seen this year and eagerly await Atom
Egoyans next film.</P>
