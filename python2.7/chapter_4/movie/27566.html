 State and Main (2001).  2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring William H. Macy,
Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David
Paymer, Rebecca Pidgeon, Charles Durning, Patti Lupone and Clark Gregg.
Written and directed by David Mamet. Rated R.</P>
<P> Previously when dealing with the movies, most notably in Hurlyburly,
David Mamet has used his pen as a scalpel to satirically slice the
industry. But in his latest venture, State and Main, the playwright is
content with using his writing instrument as a feather merely to tickle
the industry.</P>
<P> The premise is simplicity itself. A movie company, after losing its New
Hampshire location, settles upon the sleepy little town of Waterford,
Vt., to film The Old Mill. Waterford seems perfect; it has a firehouse
and an old mill ó at least according to a brochure about the town.</P>
<P> Unfortunately, after settling on Waterford and making all the
arrangements needed to film, director Walt Price (William H. Macy) and
his production crew discover that the brochure is a bit out of date ó
the mill was destroyed during a rash of suspicious fires back in 1960.</P>
<P> So, first-time screenwriter Joe White (Philip Seymour Hoffman),  a
promising young playwright, must revamp his script while at the same
time searching for a manual typewriter to replace his, which was lost in
transit from New Hampshire.
How the film company solves its various dilemmas and interacts with the
easy-going New Englanders of Waterford is the gist of Mametís
screenplay.</P>
<P> State and Main, which Mamet also directed, is a gentle comedy. Mametís
jabs at Hollywood are more like love taps. The movie is funny, but not
biting.</P>
<P> But what a cast. Beside Macy and Hoffman, the film stars Alec Baldwin
and Sarah Jessica Parker as Bob Barrenger and Claire Wellesley, the
stars of The Old Mill; David Paymer as the filmís trouble-shooting
producer; Charles Durning as Waterfordís mayor; Patti Lupone as his
snobbish wife; Rebecca Pidgeon as Waterfordís bookstore owner and
community theater director; and Julia Stiles as a teen-age groupie out
to exploit Bobís predilection for young girls.</P>
<P> State and Main just meanders along. And that is the filmís problem.
Itís comic, but not frantic; the laughs are there, but they lack a big
payoff.</P>
<P> Even the satire lacks spark. It's of the obvious type, mostly
consisting of the ìsophisticatedî Hollywood folk not able to comprehend
the rustic style of their hosts.</P>
<P> State and Main has its moments, but you seem to have to wait for them.</P>
<P> The one nice aspect of Mametís story is seeing Hoffman playing a
romantic figure. The love affair that develops between the idealistic
writer and practical community theater director is sweet. Hoffman and
Pidgeon make a lovely couple.</P>
<P> But the others all seem to be playing types: Macy as the profane
director who wonít let anything or anyone stop him from making his
movie; Baldwin as the self-centered leading man; Parker as the airhead
bimbo with artistic aspirations; Paymer as the ruthless money man. They
all are caricatures.</P>
<P> State and Main is a rather tame outing. Itís enjoyable, but nothing
that will make a lasting impression.</P>
