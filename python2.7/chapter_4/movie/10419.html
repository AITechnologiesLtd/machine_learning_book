<PRE>JACKIE BROWN (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Quentin Tarantino
Writer: Quentin Tarantino (based on the novel "Rum Punch" by Elmore
Leonard)
Starring: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert DeNiro,
Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Tom
"Tiny" Lister Jr, Margaret Cho, Denise Crosby, Sid Haig, Aimee Graham,
Chris Tucker</P>
<P>I have a feeling many people will be let-down when seeing Quentin
Tarantino's follow-up to "Pulp Fiction" as it is not a "Pulp Fiction." 
Or a "Reservoir Dogs" for that matter.  It's not a hip, non-linear
morality play, doesn't contain any big speeches on popular culture, and
doesn't have a ton of shoot-outs, blood, or a lot of gore.  "Jackie
Brown" is all about simple pleasures, telling us a simple story
motivated entirely by characters.  It's not a retread of either of his
films, yet still remains amazing in its own right, which means one
thing: That's right, Mr. Tarantino is the Real McCoy.</P>
<P>I've read a couple Elmore Leonard novels, and the great thing about him
is that he creates a world that's so seductive that it's almost a pity
that it has to end.  He tells simple crime stories, filled with
characters who are living breathing people.  They have a vernacular all
their own, and they clash off of eachother, creating the storylines
entirely from them.  None of them are stuck in a crime story, they're
stuck in the crime world.  And instead of Quentin doing his own schtick,
he has adapted one of his novels ("Rum Punch"), and it's about time,
because seeing his others films, you know it's a perfect duo.</P>
<P>"Jackie Brown," which is the name of the protagonist changed a bit to be
an homage to that old Pam Grier classic "Foxy Brown," is a simple story,
made complex by the characters.  It centers a middle-aged flight
attendant, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier, getting a career lift, after all
those years of crap Segal flicks), who has a side-line of running gun
money for a small time arms dealer in Compton: Ordell Robie (Samuel L.
Jackson - who else could have done this role?).  The cops have caught
her, and they give her a choice: either spill the beans, and probably
definitely be killed by Robie...or do some time, which would mean she'd
be screwed for life, since she's 44 and all, and a flight attendant.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, a bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forster, who's
biggest thing other than this was a starring role in that John
Sayles-penned creature feature, "Alligator") who meets Jackie when he
gets her out of jail for Ordell at the beginning, and falls deeply in
love with her.  The two begin helping eachother out and all, and we get
a nice tender love story going on which never feels forced or corny
(thank god).</P>
<P>Also in on the film are two ATF agents (Michael Keaton and Michael
Bowen), who are working with Jackie; a dim-witted ex-prison con named
Louis Gara (scummy-looking Robert DeNiro), who's working with Ordell;
and the beach girl/pot head Melanie (Bridget Fonda), who has a lot of
wit in between her inhalations.  </P>
<P>What's interesting is that all of these characters have intelligence,
and are never restricted by the plot.  These characters do a lot of
talking, and there are some scenes where they're just hanging out that
are just as fascinating if not more than the suspense sequences.  I
loved the scene where Melanie and Louis were talking about a picture,
mainly because it was so excellently written, acted, and subtely
directed.  He pulls us into a world where the characters reign, and lets
us drop in on them just chilling.  That's what's great about Tarantino.</P>
<P>The plot is complex and all, yet simple.  What I liked about it was how
it was never overwhelming, and how it was never in the foreground.  Even
Jackie being caught by the police was justified since one of the
less-intelligent characters gave her away.  Tarantino's characters have
never been as well-defined than in this one, and his dialogue has never
really been as brilliant, in respects to the way he makes the characters
sound like real people.  Sure, there are no big speeches about European
McDonalds, and even no great one-liners like "I'm gonna get medieval on
your ass," but he allows us to get drawn into the characters, and never
overwhelms us with anything else.</P>
<P>The acting from everyone is flawless.  There's not one bad performance
in the movie.  Pam Grier gives the performance of her career, hitting
every single note of her character, and making her seem first and
foremost like a person.  After all, it's kind of a biographical
character.  Here's a woman who's had some good things happen to her (the
whole blaxploitation thing in real life), but is stuck doing a crap
thankless job (flight stewardess in the movie; bad films in real life),
and has a chance to get away rich (the half-a-million in the movie; the
movie in real life).  Watching her in this movie, even I wanted to cast
her in a movie of mine.  She's amazing.</P>
<P>But she doesn't do the best acting job.  That award goes to Robert
Forster, who needed a career face-lift because he's never really had a
big career.  Older than Grier is, he provides the film with heart, and
gives a flawless performance as the older bail bondsman, stuck in a crap
job, and possessing a bit of puppy dog love for Grier.  Watching him act
is one of the true simple joys of watching "Jackie Brown."</P>
<P>Everyone else is great too.  Samuel L. Jackson is predictably brilliant,
shouting out the N-word over and over and over again (last night on
Charlie Rose, Quentin discussed this, and said that's how someone like
Ordell really talks - and also talked about the whole Spike Lee being
pissed off again spiel). DeNiro fits perfectly into the world of
Tarantino (maybe he and Keitel can finally get a film together where
they actually have some good screentime), also hitting every single note
of his character.  Fonda is amazing as the pot headed beach bum who's
motivation it is to get stoned and watch TV - I loved her in every
single scene she had.  And Keaton has a small part, but utilizes it
wonderfully, without every going "Beatlejuice" with it.  Christ Tucker,
who has a very small one-scene role is hilarious without getting too
"Fifth Element"-y (in fact, it seems like he took some well-needed
prozac).</P>
<P>But the best thing about this is Quentin, the man on the marquee (do you
think people are rushing to see this for Pam Grier?).  He's still in
love with every single frame, and it shows.  His style's still in tact,
but it's more subtle this time, to reflect on the state of mind of
Jackie, who's worn out.  This works brilliantly, especially since this
film wouldn't work with anything outrageous.  There's no ear cutting or
male rape; and there are only a few shocking scenes, and even they
aren't really shocking.  There are so many things I loved about this
film that I couldn't even list them since it would go on forever.  </P>
<P>At a running time one minute longer than that of "Pulp Fiction," the
film would seem to go on foerever.  But he directs this leisurely, and
we just chill with the characters.  Quentin directs this like a grown-up
blaxploitation film, starting off with a typical blaxploitation opening
(which hints at the opening of "The Graduate"), with Pam looking all
cool, then shows her just going to work.  This kind of maturity is what
"Jackie Brown" is all about.  This is the film that shows that Quentin
can actually direct.</P>
<P>Along with "Titanic," this is the best film to see right now.  It's a
damn-near flawless little piece of film noir, filled with excellent
characterization, and just the right bit of hipness.  I looked hard but
could not even find one thing wrong with the film.  Every single thing
is in tact with the film.  This is not "Reservoir Dogs" or "Pulp
Fiction."  It's "Jackie Brown": a completely different film.  And that's
what I loved about it.</P>
