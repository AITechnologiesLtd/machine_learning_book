THE CHASE (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>When I first saw THE CHASE, 1994 comedy written and directed
by Adam Rifkin, I was convinced that it was definitely
inspired by the chase on Los Angeles street - most
spectacular episode in the O.J. Simpson case. However, some
time ago I found, to my great surprise, that THE CHASE had
been released in March 1994, some three months before those
events. Thus, this rather insignificant film has the honour
of being one of the most sinister examples of life imitating
art.</P>
<P>Protagonist of this film is Jack Hammond (played by Charlie
Sheen), young man who was sentenced to twenty years of
prison for the crime he didn't commit. He escapes from
prison but he needs quick getaway car in order to cross
Mexican border. So he kidnaps Natalie Voss (played by Kristy
Swanson), steals her car and begins drive to the border,
followed by police. Since Natalie happens to be the daughter
of rich Dalton Voss (played by Ray Wise), media joins the
chase with TV crews boarding cars and helicopters and all
other suitable means of transportation. In the meantime,
Jack and Natalie, oblivious to the media circus around them,
are becoming friends and more than that.</P>
<P>Perhaps Adam Rifkin envisioned this film as bitter satire on
modern media, but in reality THE CHASE turned into typical
one-joke movie which went downhill as soon as protagonists
began their drive. From that point on, film is full of bad
and uninspired jokes (some involving bodily fluids or frozen
corpses), and capable actors like Ray Wise, Kristy Swanson
and Charlie Sheen must fight with lame dialogue (especially
in scenes featuring Henry Rollins in the role of policeman)
and their characters being one- dimensional caricatures.
Before the end credits (which, according to many, feature
the most hillarious scene of the film) the audience must
endure usually predictable plot and some obligatory, but in
the context of this film laughably implausible romantic
scenes. When the end comes after 94 minutes, THE CHASE
nevertheless looks like a complete waste of time.</P>
