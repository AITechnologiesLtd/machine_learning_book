<PRE>                                  CHERRY FALLS
                         A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
                         Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com

<P>By now, the audience for slasher films is perfectly attuned to the
rhythms of Scream and its spawn of imitators, each more formulaic than
the next.  Attractive teenagers flirt with one another, meander around
campus chatting on their cell phones, then abruptly find themselves
isolated in an abandoned library or, God forbid, alone in the house. 
That's when the masked killer attacks.  Cue the shrieks.</P>
<P>Put Cherry Falls a notch above the competition for the audacity of its
wry comic twist.  Yes, there's a creepy, longhaired psychopath, either a
convincing drag queen or a ferociously strong woman, deliberately
seeking out virgins for slicing and dicing.  Virgins.  The resourceful
students of Cherry Falls High School soon realize that they have a
deliciously simple choice: fucking or death.  Which would you choose?</P>
<P>Not even their sensitive "Mr. Nice Guy" teacher (Jay Mohr, Jerry
Maguire) can prevent the hormones kicking into overdrive when an
elaborate bacchanal is planned for Friday night.  Considering the
alternative, randy boys and horny girls seek salvation in each other's
arms.  Yeah, baby, yeah!</P>
<P>The local sheriff (a well-cast Michael Biehn, Aliens) turns a blind eye
to those naughty kids while following the only lead he's got.  Could it
be that ever reliable plot device of a dark secret in the town's past
which can no longer remain hidden?  He's determined to find out.  No
sooner has he told his headstrong young daughter Jody (Brittany Murphy,
Clueless) to mind her curfew than she's sleuthing around herself. 
Daddy's little girl suddenly becomes the slasher's chief target.</P>
<P>You'll have no trouble deducing the killer from the handful of suspects,
though screenwriter Ken Selden's choice of leaving the gender a mystery
certainly helps.  Senden also creates a very well-written
father-daughter chat for Biehn and Murphy where the birds and the bees
are not so easy to categorize.  When he asks whether she could still go
a little further, it's unclear just what he's intending to protect.</P>
<P>For the most part, Cherry Falls sticks to the tried and true formula,
bringing to mind words like adequate or functional.  Geoffrey Wright
(Romper Stomper) deftly handles his directorial chores, maintaining
well-crafted suspense without adding any particularly original new
tricks to the proverbial cinematic bag.</P>
<P>In addition to the clever touch of kids breaking the fundamental rule of
slasher films (where only virginal heroines survive,) Cherry Falls has
one other vital ingredient.  Brittany Murphy has all the makings of a
movie star, a girl with beauty and brains.  On top of that, she's quite
a capable actress, much more believable as an eager high schooler than
scream queen bimbos Neve Campbell or Jennifer Love Hewitt.</P>
<P>If anyone deserves to inherit the mantle of Halloween's Jamie Lee
Curtis, it's Cherry Falls' leading lady.  Her most challenging roles
have been on stage (Arthur Miller's A View From the Bridge) but she
hasn't struck gold onscreen.  With a little luck, who knows?  If the
Jamie Lee comparison is accurate, she could go on to star in the 21st
century's answer to A Fish Called Wanda.  Memo to Hollywood: Give
Brittany Murphy more work!</P>
