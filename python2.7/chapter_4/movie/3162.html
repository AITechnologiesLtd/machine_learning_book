                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Perhaps at present one of the best directors in the world is Zhang
Yimou, mainland China's prolific filmmaker.  In 1988, his RED SORGHUM
caught the attention of the West with the story of village wine makers
warding off the Japanese.  This was followed in 1990 with JU DOU, the
tragedy of illicit love in a society dominated by males.  RAISE THE
RED LANTERN, in 1991, had the intriguing story of a young girl who at
her parents' insistence marries a wealthy man in whose house she
becomes "the Fourth Mistress."  1993 brought us into the current world
of China with THE STORY OF QUI JU, a woman who attempts to fight the
bureaucracy.</P>
<P>     In TO LIVE, we cover some forty-plus years in China that include
Mao's The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, the Red
Guard, and the terrible toll on ordinary people.  Yimou uses one
family's travails as an illustration of what happened to the many
millions who had to live through those years.  As this review is being
written, the film is banned in China even though it includes nothing of
the current turmoil, imprisonments, etc.</P>
<P>     As in most of Yimou's films, his favorite (on and off the screen),
the beautiful actress Gong Li plays the lead.  Here she is a mother
with a young son and daughter, and a husband (Ge You) who, addicted to
gambling, ends up losing their home.  The film covers his career in the
army, his trade, which is that of a puppeteer, (of a kind I have never
before seen), his return to his home after the war to find that things
have changed in many ways, mostly politically.  The extremism of the
Left appears no more gentle than the kind found among the Right in
other countries of the world.</P>
<P>     If anyone knows how to tell a story, to get you involved with "the
big picture" as well as the individuals in it, Zhang Yimou is our man.</P>
