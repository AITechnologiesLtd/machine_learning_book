                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Spike Lee has brought THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY
     OF MALCOLM X to the screen in a film of large virtues and
     large faults.  We get some feel for the sweep of historic
     events and a feel for how Malcolm's views were transformed
     over time, but we get insufficient views of his beliefs at
     any point in time, nor which set of his beliefs the film is
     championing when it champions him.  Rating: +1 (-4 to +4).</PRE>
<P>     Spike Lee's MALCOLM X is a mammoth 201-minute film about the black
Islamic leader that may not always be doing what Lee intended it to do.  The
film does say a lot about Malcolm, both positive and negative, but not
nearly as much as one would expect for a film almost twice the length of
most feature films.  The film tells in approximately equal thirds about 1)
his youth and his drift into crime; 2) his "redemption" and his association
with the Nation of Islam; and 3) his break with the Nation of Islam, their
campaign against him, and his murder, very likely at their hands.  This
should have given the audience a very good understanding of the man, but the
screenplay by Arnold Perl and Spike Lee does not use its time well.  At one
point it stops the action dead for an extended dance production number.  It
also spends far too much time with Malcolm X's great good buddy, Shorty, who
just happens to be played by Spike Lee.  In addition, many of the events
shown in the film are of questionable authenticity.  For example, my
understanding is that Malcolm's mother denies that her husband was murdered,
unlike how it was shown in the film.</P>
<P>     The film opens with Malcolm's youth.  Malcolm (played by Denzel
Washington) begins as a teenager trying to straighten his hair with the help
of Shorty.  The film then jumps around in time, never giving us a really
good feel for what years things are taking place.  We see something of his
earlier youth with his family harassed by the Ku Klux Klan.  Those scenes
include one amazing shot that ironically seems to romanticize the Klan,
riding off into a huge moon on the horizon.  Again it is a sign that Lee is
not fully in control of this film.  Malcolm eventually moves first to
Boston, then New York, then Boston again, embarking on a life of crime cut
short by a prison sentence.</P>
<P>     In prison, Malcolm is recruited by Baines (played by Albert Hall) for
the Nation of Islam.  Malcolm is impressed by Baines's questionable
rhetoric.  (His description of why Muslims eat no pork is a real corker!  As
for his claims that Islam has a great in-built respect for blacks as
people...  am I the only person who remembers there was a huge Arab slave
trade in Africa even well after slavery was abolished in Europe and the
Americas?  In fact, I believe that the reason Swahili is still so widespread
in Africa is that it was the language created from Bantu and Arabic for the
Arab slave trade.  That fact just does not seem to square with a large black
movement to champion Islam.)  Malcolm leaves prison with an abiding belief
in Elijah Muhammad--very well-played by Al Freeman, Jr., who played Malcolm
X in ROOTS II--and in the precept that all whites are devils.</P>
<P>     The film than covers Malcolm's rise to and fall from power in Elijah
Muhammad's Nation of Islam.  Here it becomes unclear exactly what the film's
attitude toward the Nation of Islam is.  While Malcolm appears in some ways
to be doing very positive things, he behaves and presents his viewpoints
very differently in front of blacks than in front of whites.  Lee seems to
be attacking the Nation of Islam for hypocrisy.  Eventually when Malcolm
starts presenting the same vitriolic message to the whites that he was
giving to the blacks, it starts the rift between Malcolm and the Nation of
Islam.  It may be hard for much of the audience to cheer statements like,
"The Earth belongs to us ... the black man," or banners that say, "We must
protect our most valuable property ... our women."  Malcolm also rejects
integration entirely in favor of complete separation between the black and
white races.</P>
<P>     In the final third of the film, Malcolm's views shift entirely.  He is
no longer an advocate of racial separation, but of racial harmony through
Islam.  He is willing to accept that there may be good whites in the world,
as long as they are also good Muslims.  He is no longer willing to follow
Elijah Muhammad and founds his own rival Muslim black sect.  This leads to
the tragic events of which the audience is probably already aware.</P>
<P>     The film concludes by showing documentary footage of the real Malcolm
X.  Often historical films shy away from showing documentary footage of
characters they have portrayed by actors.  Perhaps it is to avoid confusion
about if it is indeed the same person.  Or perhaps showing the footage would
be inviting criticism of how well or badly the actor was made to look like
the actual person.  Lee's use of real footage of Malcolm X shows that
assumption may well be underestimating the audience.  After the footage,
several black celebrities are seen wearing caps bearing the "X," though it
is not clear which set of Malcolm X's sets of beliefs they are claiming to
espouse.</P>
<P>     The performances in MALCOLM X are generally quite good.  Denzel
Washington very quickly becomes Malcolm X for the audience.  Al Freeman,
Jr., is very believable as the founder of a huge movement.  Angela Bassett
and Lonette McKee are both very moving as Malcolm's wife and mother,
respectively.  Only notably out of place is Spike Lee himself playing
basically the same jazzy character he played in SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT, or
comically fainting on hearing his prison sentence.  There is much he could
have cut from the film to actually improve its effectiveness and his own
performance heads the list.</P>
<P>     MALCOLM X teaches some history and presents some ideas, but does
neither well enough to justify its length and hoopla.  Lee's dream project
falls short of some of the films he made preparing for it.  I rate MALCOLM X
a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
