<P>    One of last year's Best Foreign Film nominees is an odd, dour drama
about a movie-studio talent scout (Sergio Castellitto) scouring Sicily
for the Next Big Star.  He travels from village to village in his
vehicle, announcing over megaphone the promises of rags to riches, and
then setting up his lights, camera, and action to anyone willing to pay
the 1,500 lire fee.  (To cover the cost of film and developing, he
says.) The villagers all end up baring their souls to the camera, which
makes for an interesting travelogue of local Sicilian color.  (Early in
the movie, however, he has everyone reciting dialogue from GONE WITH THE
WIND.  In one hilarious sequence, the camera captures the various
butchered readings of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.) Though a very
well- produced and good-looking film, THE STAR MAKER suffers on a number
of a fronts.  The talent scout, for example, isn't exactly the most
likable of characters.  And though his world-- and the film-- is
brightened after he meets a simple convent girl (Tiziana Lodato), she
arrives so late into the story that her presence barely makes a
difference.  Directed by Giuseppe Tornatore (CINEMA PARADISO).</P>
