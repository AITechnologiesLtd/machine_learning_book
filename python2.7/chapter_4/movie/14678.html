<P>Taiwan, 24/12/99.  The millenium approaches.  An incessant downpour 
batters an unnamed city.  Sectors of the city are being sealed, 
quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus.  The virus causes 
people to act like insects: they crawl about on all fours, hide from 
bright lights, huddle in damp corners.  The water supply to the 
quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time.  Residents are 
advised to evacuate the area, ASAP.</P>
<P>This premise--Kafka by way of Cronenberg--is the background for THE 
HOLE, which could have been a great movie, but, sadly, ends up as a 
waste of good ideas.  The quick sketch above suggests a dark, absurd, 
hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century; in 
execution, however, it is nothing like that.</P>
<P> The virus, the evacuation, the visual possiblities of the deluge: 
these are all relegated to the background.  Instead, THE HOLE focuses 
on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man (Lee Kang-Sheng) and 
a woman (Yang Kuei-Mei) who live in the same apartment building, and 
who have no personalities.  The entire movie taks place in settings 
that are uniformly ugly and sterile: the charmless rooms and corridors 
of a post-industrial apartment complex, photographed to look as dim 
and dingy as possible.  It's a vivid setting, but an unappealing one, 
especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of 
drainage pipes in the background.</P>
<P>The man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's.  One day, 
a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of 
the man's living room, opening into the ceiling of the woman's living 
room.  This hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's 
lonely, compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual (and 
mostly non-verbal) ways.</P>
<P>Example: the man, suffering from the onset of the virus (or so I 
assume--everything is obscure in this movie) vomits through the hole.  
The woman, wandering around in the dark, accidentally puts her hand on 
his vomit, and then cleans it up.  This is what passes for meaningful 
communication.  And they say romance is dead.</P>
<P>Much of the film does not even focus on their interactions, such as 
they are.  There is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing 
about these people.  They are ciphers.  Instead, we are treated to 
long takes in which we witness their miserable lives; we watch, for 
instance, as the woman boils some water, pours it onto some noodles, 
then eats the noodles.  (This is as fascinating as it sounds.)</P>
<P>Offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences 
are a series of musical numbers, fantasies in which the woman 
lip-synchs to pop songs by Grace Chan (popular, so I'm told, in 1950s' 
China).  She prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells, 
incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights.  Sometimes, in 
these fantasies, she is joined by the man.  These scenes are 
presumably intended to be bright and fanciful, sharply contrasting the 
dreariness of reality, but they fail.  When the man and the woman 
dance, it seems half-hearted and listless.  Astaire and Rogers this is 
not.  Even in imagination, these people are numb, weary, boring.</P>
<P>THE HOLE is part of the 'Collection 2000' series, a group of films 
commissioned by French TV station La Sept ARTE on the subject of the 
millenium.  Others include Canada's LAST NIGHT, Brazil's MIDNIGHT, and 
American Hal Hartley's THE BOOK OF LIFE.  THE BOOK OF LIFE is the only 
other one that I have seen, and it is infinitely superior to the 
Taiwanese entry.  Witty, energetic, humane, it makes the THE HOLE seem 
(ahem) empty.</P>
<P>American movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of 
content with flashy movements, quick cuts, superficial emotions.  
Foreign movies with nothing to say do what THE HOLE does: they point 
the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long 
periods of time, and call it art.  THE HOLE is self-evidently a film 
about alienation, and perhaps director Tsai Ming-Liang wants the 
audience to share in his characters' alienation.  If so, he succeeds.  
Perhaps it is a challenge: he dares us to enjoy this movie, despite 
his best attempts to ensure that we don't.  If it was a challenge, I 
wasn't up for it.</P>
