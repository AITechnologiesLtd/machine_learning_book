<P>Of all Oscar Wilde's works, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was surely the 
one that most easily accomodated a Hollywood adaption in the 1940s.  
Hollywood, then as now, likes neat conclusions, preferably moral 
ones--and dislikes subversive ironies.  DORIAN GRAY, Wilde's only 
novel, can be taken at face value (and not to its detriment) as an 
exemplary conte morale, with a neatly symmetrical finale.  There are 
subversive ironies distorting the smoothly polished narrative surface, 
but, while they enrich our enjoyment, they are not necessary to it.  
It could make a fine movie, and it did.</P>
<P>The story, for those who came in late, concerns Dorian Gray, a young 
fin-de-siècle Adonis who, looking upon a recently finished portait of 
himself, idly wishes that the painting would age, absorbing by proxy 
time's decay, while he would stay young and beautiful.  And, for 
reasons that are never explained and don't really matter anyway, his 
wish is granted.  No matter what he does, he retains an air of 
youthful innocence that makes it difficult for anyone to believe ill 
of him.  This, in effect, gives him free license to commit all manner 
of debauchery, most of it merely hinted at: he becomes engaged, then 
rather cruelly dismisses his fiancée, prompting her suicide; he 
frequents opium dens; he indulges in scandalous affairs.  But as with 
all granted wishes, there is a catch: no longer subject to the 
indignities of human mortality, Dorian loses touch with the dignity of 
human morality.</P>
<P>Playing a Wilde-scripted role can be tricky: there is more than a 
hint of smugness in his epigrammatic, paradoxical wit, and in the 
wrong hands, it can become self-congratulatory, every line becoming a 
paraphrase of "look, aren't I ever so clever?"  DORIAN GRAY has fewer 
pitfalls than his stage comedies, though, because almost all the 
typically Wildean lines go to Lord Henry Wootton, an aristocrat who 
becomes a kind of mentor to Dorian, schooling him in the ways of 
refined amorality.  (It is his cruelly conceived "test" that prompts 
Dorian's fiancée, Sybil Vane, to commit suicide.)  Lord Henry is 
played by a perfectly cast George Sanders, whose droll and 
oh-so-sophisticatedly world-weary performance seems like a dress 
rehearsal for his later role as Addison de Witt in ALL ABOUT EVE.  He 
anchors the film; he does Wilde proud.</P>
<P> Hurd Hatfield's Dorian is stiff, emotionless, almost robotic.  
Although this is intended to convey Dorian's soullessness, it is 
perhaps too straightforward an interpretation, a minimalist reduction 
of the complex and contradictory impulses that torment the man.  
Angela Lansbury's performance has an altogether different problem.  
Her Sybil Vane is good, sweet, nice, respectable, and exceedingly 
dull: she seems to be acting in a different film entirely.   Lansbury 
can be great in quirky roles (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE COMPANY OF 
WOLVES) but she founders here, playing the femme douce to Dorian's 
heartless roué.</P>
<P>But, if my memory of the novel is correct, this is how Wilde wrote 
her in the first place, and the fault then lies with him.  He believed 
in his bitchy men and catty women more thoroughly than he ever 
believed in an innocent like Sybil Vane.  (No wonder he killed her off 
so early).  Elsewhere, the script likewise remains faithful to the 
text.  The homoeroticism is, of course, carefully elided, but the 
necessary time dilation and plot excisions are well-handled--if 
anything, the story becomes neater, more incisive, pared of the 
novel's occasional longeurs.  Lewin embellishes the original tale with 
some flourishes that echo and elaborate--perhaps a trifle too 
obviously--the motifs of beauty and entrapment: Lord Wootton drowns a 
butterfly in a dish of water; Sybil Vane sings of a bird in a cage of 
gold.</P>
<P>When Dorian's moral free-fall reaches its nadir, he commits murder.  
D.P. Harry Stradling--whose work is masterful throughout--makes this 
the film's most memorable moment: during the struggle, the victim's 
hand dashes an overhead light, which sets to swinging violently, 
sending shadow and light chasing each other throughout the cloistral 
room.  Dorian, expressionless, is momentarily, hallucinatorily, 
backdropped by a blank wall, against which brightness and darkness 
shift restlessly, irreconcilable.  This chiaroscuro image is a 
marvellously apt picture of Dorian Gray, a man whose soul is as 
divided from his self as light is from dark, and emblematic of the 
movie as a whole, which cuts to the quick of Wilde's novel while 
retaining all its wit, its contradictions, its ageless lessons.</P>
