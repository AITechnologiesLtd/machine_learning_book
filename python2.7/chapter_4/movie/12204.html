<PRE>TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME (1992)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: David Lynch
Writers: David Lynch and Robert Engels
Starring: Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Moira Kelly, Chris Isaak, Kiefer
Sutherland, Harry Dean Stanton, Dana Ashbrook, Kyle MacLachlan, Grace
Zubriskie, James Marshall, David Lynch, Mädchen Amick, David Bowie, Miguel
Ferrer, Jürgen Prochnow, Frances Bay, Michael J. Anderson, Heather Graham</P>
<P>I saw the pilot for David Lynch's cult classic TV show, "Twin Peaks," a
couple of months ago, and the greatest thing about it was the first hour. 
In it, the entire town discovered that a young high school girl, Laura
Palmer, was found murdered.  As the hour unfolded, we saw her parents
discover (both at the same time, and over the phone), her schoolmates, and
we saw the effect it had on the town.  It was like the place had to be
closed because of it.</P>
<P>The second hour, though, dipped into weirdo surrealism, like it was afraid
to deal further with what occured in the first hour.  Bobby, Laura's
boyfriend, became especially crazy, attacking one guy, landing in jail, and
in one of the funniest scenes in anything I've ever seen, threatened a
fellow cell mate by woofing at him.  Sure, it's funny, but it's nothing
else.  I've seen other episodes in the series, and none really owed up to
the promise the first hour of the pilot had.  Most of them just like to
shock you with weird scenes, like one where Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle
MacLachlan), the caffeine-addicted guy on the case, has a dream where he's
in a red room with Laura and a dwarf (Michael J. Anderson), who talks
backwards-yet-forwards, and says a bunch of things which make no sense
whatsoever, but are just humorous to listen to.  But do these things hold
any higher purpose?</P>
<P>Well, here's the ill-fated pre-quel to the series, which ended midway
through its second season, and the film tries to make some sense out of the
series, and to reveal the killer of Laura Palmer which we were all
wondering throughout the series (note: I'm not sure whether or not they
revealed who it was on the series).  The reason it's dead-on-arrival is
that the identity of the killer can be anyone in the town.  It's almost
like David Lynch put all the characters names in a hat, picked one, and
said, "okay, there's our killer."  It could've been the freaking Log Lady,
and they could make it work somehow in this film.</P>
<P>The first half hour of the film is almost like a typical episode of the
series: a bunch of really weird scenes tossed together, filled with empty
symbolism, but lots of surreal laughs.  In it, another Special Agent,
Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak - yes, the singer), goes to a town sorta near
Twin Peaks with another agent, Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland), to
investigate the murder of a woman.  They talk to hard-to-get-along-with
local authorities, question a disgruntled motel owner (Harry Dean Stanton),
and then disappear for no reason whatsoever.  This seques to a little bit
with Dale Cooper, who wonders where they went, and then has a bit where
David Bowie walks into the film, and you can see that the film is taking a
wild turn because from this point on, nothing makes sense, least of all the
reason why Bowie is in it.  Or Cooper, for that matter.</P>
<P>Before you can say "Huh?," the film cuts to a "One Year Later" sub-title,
we see the "Twin Peaks" sign, hear the haunting music from the show, and
meet Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), alive, well, and smiling from ear to ear as
she walks to school.  Little do we know, she has another side.  Over the
course of the rest of the film, she sleeps with a bunch of guys, hits on
her best female friend Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle in the show, but eerily
replaced by Moria Kelly in the film), does drugs, goes to a topless bar,
and all sorts of self-destructive acts.</P>
<P>She also finds discomfort at home.  Her father, Leland (Ray Wise), begins
acting all strange, or maybe he did it before, we don't know.  In the first
scene he's in, there's a really humorous scene where Laura and he fight
over the fact that she sat at the dinner table without (*gasp*) washing her
hands.  Her mother (Grace Zubriskie, who played Susan's mother on
"Seinfeld" for awhile) tries to cease the fight between them, but can't do
anything but scream for them to just stop.</P>
<P>Some critic said that this film showed Laura's gradual descent into
madness, and to her eventual murder at the end of the film (I will not
reveal the killer's identity, but I will say that the identity is so
obvious that it's campy).  This is not so.  We first see her looking all
happy, but we then see her doing all the kinds of stuff she does later on
too.  It seems like she's rebelling against something, and that she has
been doing this for awhile.  She starts out this way, and the only gradual
thing is how insane she becomes throughout the film.</P>
<P>Laura becomes plagued by nightmares, weird dreams, and visions.  She begins
seeing things in everyday life, like an old woman (Francis Bay) walking
around with a boy wearing a white mask.  She dreams of the red room from
the TV show, with the dwarf saying empty sentences.  And her death becomes
imminent not just because the TV show revolved around her death, but
because the film unsubtlely hints at it continuously.  Her sins in the film
become greater by the minute, and it seems that Lynch thinks that she needs
some kind of cleansing, that she was murdered because she was so rebellious
and ill-mannered.</P>
<P>Interesting subtexts like these abound, but are just part of the overall
weirdness that Lynch gives the film.  Along with this idea, there's bounds
of things that happen that have no relevance over anything that happens,
like Bowie's appearance, the red room, or the entire first half hour.  What
connects the elements of the film?  Why are we shown characters, like
Madchen Amick's waitress, who show up for a scene or two, are given a bit
of drama, and then are never shown again?  What is the meaning of the ring,
which seems to be the only thing that connects the beginning and rest of
the film?  And why is Laura haunted by a demon named Bob?</P>
<P>Some fans of Lynch say that he's a genius at work, and that everything
means something.  A friend of mine actually thinks that the TV show is
"brilliant," but when I asked him why he thought he was brilliant, all he
did was stutter.  I've come to the conclusion that David Lynch is a genius
at creating atmosphere and mood, and maybe even pretty competent at
bringing up interesting and complex issues about humanity and what not, but
that he has no clue what to do with them.  He knows that talking about
issues like the underbelly of society requires a delicate touch; he's just
afraid to take a wrong step.</P>
<P>This seems to be why he resorts to meaningless surrealistic banter, which
is exactly what everything in this film is.  Lynch is afraid of digging
deep within the story and issues, and instead just tosses empty symbolism
at us, maybe hoping that the whole pretentiousness of it all will make us
watch again and again to get a message, and also that the humor will win us
over.  For some of us, it does.  I laughed at this film.  I laughed at all
the weird things that went on, and that seems to be what Lynch wants.  Why
do you have a dwarf speaking backwards-yet-forwards if you don't want
someone to get a laugh out of it?</P>
<P>What Lynch could do is express something, anything out of this.  I love
surrealism, but only when it works the way it should.  Luis Bunuel was able
to dig deeper into his films by using surrealism, but Lynch uses it as a
cover so he doesn't have to really expose his film for what it is.  What is
"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" even about?  Is it about how
self-destructive behavior will eventually result in death?  Is it about how
underneath a seemingly happy society there's a sick underbelly of perverts
and drug addicts?  What is Lynch trying to convery here?</P>
<P>To put it bluntly, this film is a mess.  It doesn't know what it wants to
do with anything, and it tries to pass off everything in a surrealistic
fashion so that no one can see that underneath, it's just confused about
what it wants to be doing.  Surrealism needs focus to exist, or else it
just meanders off and becomes empty, which is what happens with many of
Lynch's films.  Especially now, Lynch needs to look back at two of his
films: "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet."  "Eraserhead" was a really surreal
film, but what it did by creating surrealism is show a character who is
completely alienated in society.  It was basically a stylish nightmare, but
it was great in how it was able to present its protagonist and the misery
he feels.  "Blue Velvet" was probably his most focused film: a film about
how underneath society is something which is hideous, but which is ignored
for the safety of society.  There, he was able to use the surrealism to his
advantage, and create not only an experience, but something with meaning
and even humanity.</P>
<P>"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" is an experience, in that several scenes
show mood, but none of them have the emotional or intellectual context to
take them further and make them meaningful.  There's a really long scene
where Laura and Donna go to a topless bar, and a band plays so loud that
subtitles have to appear on the bottom of the screen so we know what
everyone's saying.  The mood is great and the scene is atmospheric as hell,
but when it's over, nothing remains but the though that the scene felt
really weird to watch.  Nothing else holds over from it.</P>
<P>The one good thing the film does is create a little bit of sympathy for
Laura, mostly because she's the protagonist and we know that at the end,
she's going to die and there's no way out of it.  It gives it a Sophoclean
subtext, but this is only used as a cheap gimmick so that we feel bad for
her.  Sure, she's self-destructive, but she's going to be murdered
gruesomely, and there's nothing anyone in this film can do about it.</P>
<P>But why was she killed?  And what is this film, or the TV show about?  I
guess what it's saying is that underneath, everyone's weird.  Yeah.</P>
