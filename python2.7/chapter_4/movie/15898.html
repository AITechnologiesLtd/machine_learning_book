<P>"The Thin Red Line" is a fine example of a failure of vision, a rather
rare failing in American film.  Writer/director Terrence Malick
reached too far and tried for too much.  As a result, his film works
in places, but fails as a whole.</P>
<P>The story concerns an Army company assigned to assist in clearing
Japanese troops out of the island of Guadalcanal in World War II.  The
company must land on a possibly fortified beach and seize a key ridge
that commands an important airfield.  Many men will clearly die in the
effort.</P>
<P>This story would normally be told in a rather straightforward way, as
indeed it was in the previous (rather weak) adaptation of the James
Jones novel the film is based on.  Malick uses a different approach,
which has more in common with the literary than with classical film
methods.  Malick's presentation starts with a lengthy pre-invasion
sequence that seems at first to suggest an anthropological
documentary, and then to suggest that a particular character, Pvt.
Witt (Jim Caviezel), will be a focus for the film.  Witt is a natural
rebel who curiously seems to be both completely out of place and
comfortably at home in the Army.  But Malick quickly moves on to
sketch a dozen or so other characters at various levels of detail,
with the deepest treatment reserved for Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin), a
former officer whose love of his wife lead to his resignation and
later drafting; and Battalion commander Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), an
overage officer who seethes with hidden rage at being passed over for
promotion and plans to prove his worth with the upcoming battle.</P>
<P>Malick deploys several of his major cinematic devices early.  We see
many shots of nature, especially the exotic animals and plants of the
South Seas.  These recur throughout the film, occasionally in integral
portions of the story, but more often as side comments on the
proceedings.  Malick also begins the use of voice overs to reveal
characters' internal thoughts.  Many of the film's characters speak to
us in voice over throughout.  Finally, Malick introduces flashbacks to
the earlier lives of a couple of the characters.  The device is used
most heavily for Pvt. Bell.</P>
<P>These devices are central to Malick's presentation, and clearly served
as organizing principles for the entire work.  The other major
elements shaping the work are Malick's intention to present the events
of the film as influences on his characters, rather than as a plot
that the characters move forward; and his desire to incorporate
different perspectives into the film.  Malick clearly intends them to
serve his greater end, which is to investigate how men choose to live
their lives and why those choices so often lead to disaster.  Unlike
so many films, this film's structure, down to fairly fine details, was
clearly well thought out and planned in the mind of a director who saw
in his mind's eye what he wanted.</P>
<P>The vision of the mind's eye is not always as clear as one might hope.
The devices Malick deploys often fail, and they ultimately sink the
film.  The interminable pre-invasion sequence drags the film down.  By
the time Malick has gotten his men on the beach, many viewers will
already have written the film off.  Malick's use of voice over, with
multiple characters thinking deep thoughts, is bold but ineffective.
Too often we are uncertain which of the many characters is sharing his
thoughts with us.  Worse, too often those thoughts are expressed in
pretentious language that seems highly unlikely to inhabit the minds
of the characters.  When they are far more likely to be thinking "how
the hell am I going to get out of this alive," we hear them discussing
fine philosophical points in language more suited to poetry than the
heat of combat.</P>
<P>The flashbacks are similarly distracting, especially those to Pvt.
Bell's marriage.  Malick shows us these scenes incessantly, often at
key moments in the action.  The effect is to convince us that Bell's
obsession with his wife is very, very important, and will be key to
the action, or the theme of the film, or understanding important
character developments.  Ultimately, it proves to be none of these.
Far too little in the film comes of this obsession to justify the time
spent on it, and, worse, the breakup in the continuity of the action.
I presume Malick understood this and did it anyway for some specific
reason, but that reason is unclear to me.</P>
<P>Malick's choice to render Jones' book in fuller complexity than is
typical of adaptations also leads to a shifting focus among the
characters.  It takes quite a while to determine just which of them
are going to be important.  In typical Hollywood films, the shorthand
for handling this problem is to cast famous actors, or at least
familiar faces, in most of the important roles.  But in "The Thin Red
Line," not only do stars play small, trivial roles (George Clooney's
role seems especially pointless), but familiar faces like John Savage
and John C. Reilly crop up in parts that ultimately are of little
consequence.  Nothing says that a director has to use the conventional
methods to sort out confusion, but if he doesn't use those methods, he
needs some other method.  Malick either denies the requirement or his
methods failed.  It takes a long time to determine who is who here,
and some of the characters never really achieve any clear separation
from the others.</P>
<P>These choices harm the film.  And that's a tremendous shame, as the
film has some extremely strong elements.  In addition to the most
obvious (excellent cinematography), several performances are very
strong.  Nolte and Elias Koteas deserve the greatest honors here, as
they manage to convey clear characters and relationships in the face
of the confusions of the rest of the film.  Other actors, like Sean
Penn and Jim Caviezel, do well enough, but it seems like Malick has
left out key scenes or important information that would bring strong
individual moments together into a coherent performance.  There are
clear elements of a strong, important contrast between these two
characters, but the film comes just short of clarifying that contrast.</P>
<P>The center section of the film (in itself, as long as a conventional
film) is powerful.  This section, which has the clearest focus,
concerns an assault on a strongly held ridge and its immediate
aftermath.  Malick stages this section of the film brilliantly,
managing to make clear the complexities of the combat while
simultaneously showing the chaos of its execution.  His use of
locations is particularly strong here.  The hills the troops must
climb are covered with shoulder-high grass, and Malick uses this and
other topographical features to convey the terror of the unknown that
troops must feel when assaulting an enemy position.  You never know
whether, in the next moment, the grass will part to reveal just more
grass, or the enemy about to kill you.  Death strikes from afar, as
unseen machine guns suddenly end lives.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Malick still has more than half an hour's material
after this sequence is completed.  He ultimately has one more climax
he wishes to show, but the dramatic timing used to transition from the
aftermath of the attack to this sequence is stilted.  The film seems
like it's going to end several times, only to go on.</P>
<P>Malick is also to be praised for his fairness in treating his
characters.  The most obvious instance is how the Japanese, initially
little more than deadly ciphers, become extremely human and
sympathetic on closer examination.  But Malick gives the same
treatment to other characters, as well.  Nolte's obsessive Colonel,
who forces assaults that seem suicidal and has too little concern for
the welfare of his men, ultimately is shown to have made the correct
military choices, and, more surprisingly, to have more compassion for
the tragedy of the battle than one would have expected.</P>
<P>Many critics have said that "The Thin Red Line" improves greatly on
second viewing, as the viewer now has a better idea of what to expect.
Perhaps that's true.  However, on first viewing "The Thin Red Line"
plays as an exceedingly ambitious failure with some strong
compensating virtues.  As such, it's definitely worth seeing, but only
for those willing to accept a different approach to film than one
traditionally sees, and those willing to overlook some fairly large
flaws.</P>
