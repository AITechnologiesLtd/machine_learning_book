<P>Back from the immensely successful INDEPENDENCE DAY, director ROLAND =
EMMERICH and producer DEAN DEVLIN (both collaborated in earlier moderate =
hits, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER and STARGATE) are back with yet another =
eye-popping, effect-laced excuse of a movie. GODZILLA has nothing going =
for it other than its CGI effects, which forms nearly 90% of the film! =
And what effects! As yet again, EMMERICH and DEVLIN has opted to go for =
lesser hit-movie actors as in their films pre-dating GODZILLA. The =
teasers for GODZILLA started hitting screens and TV more than a year ago =
and rumours has it that the budget is close to a whopping US$200 =
million.=20</P>
<P>The story brings us to the pacific where the French have been conducting =
nuclear tests, inevitably harming the wild life and setting them off =
from their predestined path of evolution. GODZILLA was thus born, =
standing as tall as the Empire State Building, GODZILLA is no more than =
a gargantuan mix between a Komodo Dragon and a T-Rex. It sets off from =
the pacific, walked across Mexico (without being detected!) and swam its =
way to Manhattan, New York to make it into a nesting place. Sounds more =
like an excuse than a story right? Well, I don't blame you. After all, =
this is Hollywood!</P>
<P>Broderick is the ever-zealous Nick, who leads his field of study in the =
effects of radiation on the evolution of animals. Trailing the creature =
to New York, he bumps into ex-girlfriend, Audrey (Maria Pitillo), an =
aspiring reporter who find herself lacking in the nasty skills required =
in achieving her dream. When the military falsely dismisses Nick from =
their research team with the accusation that he has been leaking =
information to the public, he is picked-up by French secret agent =
Phillippe Roche (Jean Reno). Incidentally, the French has sent a team of =
secret operatives to destroy the creature, an effort to undo what they =
have indirectly done through the nuclear tests. Jean Reno once again =
reprises his role as `The Cleaner' (as in his roles in Luc Besson's LA =
FEMME NIKITA and THE PROFESSIONAL aka LEON), apparent to his words in =
the film, `we are here to clean the mess we have made'. Hank Azaria =
plays Animal, the crazy cameraman who would do anything for a good =
camera shot.</P>
<P>In GODZILLA, the creature takes centrestage. True to the original =
Japanese GODZILLA movies, we get to see gratuitous lack of respect for =
public property as it tramples through landmarks of New York. The CGI =
effects are impressive, imagine JURASSIC PARK with a few thousand =
percent more worth of CG creatures. One cannot help but notice the =
resemblance of this creature to the previous two dinosaur movies and =
though it may not deliver the landmark quality to outshine the realism =
of JURASSIC PARK and THE LOST WORLD, it sure has the magnitude and =
destruction to significantly numb audiences, forcing them to immerse =
into the fast paced action and loud sound effects.=20</P>
<P>EMMERICH's direction flows with unoriginal ideas, regurgitated from =
landmark action sci-fi movies of our time. Each scene an excuse to flex =
yet another muscle of his CGI team. Definitely the special effects movie =
of the year. Not quite memorable stuff, but it was highly entertaining =
while it lasted.=20</P>
