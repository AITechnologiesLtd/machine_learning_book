<P>Jump Tomorrow is cute with a capital C.  Everything about it is cute, from
the story, to the direction, to the sets, to the songs.  If you can't walk
away from this film with a smile on your face, you'd better keep right on
walking to your shrink's office.</P>
<P>Tomorrow focuses on George Abiola (Tunde Adebimpe), a perpetually
uncomfortable-looking Nigerian man who is about to marry a childhood friend.
George, who looks like he came out of his mom wearing a suit, could be a
grown-up Urkel on quaaludes.  And to say he's nervous about his impending
nuptials would be a drastic understatement.</P>
<P>With his traditional Nigerian wedding just a few days away (it's set to take
place in Niagara Falls), George heads to the airport to pick up his fiancée,
who is on her way from Nigeria.  But he comes one day late, and, after
calling his uncle (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), finds out Sophie (Abiola Wendy
Abrams) is already in Niagara Falls.</P>
<P>George meets two strangers at the airport - a Latina beauty named Alicia
(Natalia Verbeke) and a man named Gerard (two-time César Award nominee
Hippolyte Girardot) who was dumped by his fiancée at the airport.  George is
instantly smitten with Alicia, who calls him Jorge and invites him to a
party later that night, and, almost against his will, George becomes
Gerard's co-pilot after he offers to drive the groom-to-be to Niagara Falls.</P>
<P>As chance would have it, Alicia and her smarmy Brit boyfriend Nathan (James
Wilby) are hitching a ride to Canada, and most of Tomorrow shows Gerard
trying to coerce George into following Alicia and winning her affections.
Gerard, who George talks out of jumping off a building (convincing him to
"jump tomorrow"), is kind of like a suicidal Cupid.  Even his license plate
reads "Amour 1."  And then your basic road trip flick stuff ensues.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is a lot like Jim Jarmusch's Stranger Than Paradise in more ways
than just having three main characters and being predominantly set on Lake
Erie. Paradise, like most of Jarmusch's other films, shows complete
strangers of different nationalities, who would ordinarily have nothing to
do with each other, forced into contact with one another for bizarre
reasons.  Granted, there's a lot more going on in Tomorrow than in Paradise,
but the similarities are still there.</P>
<P>Tomorrow is a British film packed full of folks from a bunch of different
countries.  Writer/director Joel Hopkins based Tomorrow on an award-winning
short (called Jorge) that featured Adebimpe playing the same character but
in a different setting.</P>
<P>1:37 - PG for thematic material, mild sensuality and language</P>
