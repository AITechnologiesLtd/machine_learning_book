<P>        It's always painful to witness the degredation of someone you
dearly love... to watch, helpless, as a once strong family member succumbs
to illness or the ravages of old age.  Gradually the strength and
personality traits that you remember so fondly vanish as the person dwindles
away, replaced by a shell of their former self.  They may still breathe, and
perhaps even move around from time to time, but it's obvious that their spark
is gone.  Watching it happen to my grandfather was difficult enough... and
now I get to see the same thing occur to the Batman film series.  Oh joy.
        I was a big fan of the dark vision Tim Burton brought to the first
two Batman outings.  Gotham actually breathed on the silver screen; it was
sinister and full of secrets.  Michael Keaton didn't so much play Batman as
BECOME him.  The cherry on top was the great characterization, far more in
keeping with Bob Kane's original comic books than the campy sixties
television show.  Gone were the WHAPS! and POWS! of Adam West, replaced with
great action sequences and an intense score from composer extrordinaire
Danny Elfman.  I even went so far as to buy one of those goofy t-shirts with
the bat logo boldly emblazoned on it.  (Yes, that's right... I was one of
THOSE guys.)
        Situations beyond my control prevented me from seeing the third
film ("Batman Forever"), helmed by director Joel Shumaucher and starring Val
Kilmer as the caped crusader, but when the fourth installment appeared in
theaters, I was more than game.  Another trip to Gotham, and with the lovely
and talented Uma Thurman to boot?  How could I possibly resist?  Ho boy.
How our naievity mocks us.
        "Batman and Robin" starts off with the obligatory action sequence, in
which Batman (George Clooney) and his increasingly annoying sidekick Robin
(Chris O'Donnell) attempt to foil Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in a
diamond robbery.  In an interesting interpretation of physics, Freeze
launches our heroes high into the atmosphere in some sort of rocket-thingy
whose purpose is never explained.  Batman urgently tells Robin that they must
stop the rocket, because it will soon explode and turn Gotham into a huge
crater.  Then, in an amazingly bold feat of self-contradiction, B&R set the
rocket to self-destruct.  How do they escape?  Simple.  They skateboard back
down through the atmosphere to Gotham.  Yes, you read that right.  Skateboard.
Through the air.  Back down to Gotham.  Read it again so your brain absorbs
the absurdity of the situation.  Then witness how B&R boldly blow up the
rocket mere moments after explaining the importance of not letting it explode.
        Next we're off to the Amazon jungle to enjoy the cliched ramblings of
a Dr. Clayton Forrester look-alike as he attempts to turn a 98-pound weakling
into a sumu wrestler via some sort of venom-juice.  He is of course
successful, and all goes well until Dr. Unattractive (Uma Thurman) uncovers
the secret plot.  The mad scientist isn't happy, and kills her to demonstrate
this.  She rewards him by coming back to life as a sexy super villain and
killing him with a poison kiss.  Lucky guy: not only does he get to smooch
one of the most beautiful women currently working in the movie industry, but
he gets to exit the film very early to boot.
        Back at Wayne Manor, Bruce Wayne's aged butler Alfred gets a lovely
surprise on the doorstep: Alicia Silverstone, who plays his British niece,
has come for an unannounced visit (and apparently left her accent at home).
They fondle each other for a bit in one of the most disturbing (yet not
actually dirty) displays of affection ever captured on film.  Robin becomes
infatuated with her, and follows her one night when she steals a motorcycle
to go racing.  She of course gets in trouble and he saves her, because,
after all, she's only a woman.
        In one of my favorite scenes, Robin and the future Batgirl find
themselves dangling off a bridge.  Robin has somehow managed to wrap his
foot around a metal bar, which assumedly prevents him from falling off the
bridge into the rushing water below.  Visualize with me, now: we have our
wormy hero, hanging off the bridge by one foot.  He is holding on to Alicia
Silverstone.  That's two of them, dangling precariously by one foot.  Then,
we cut to... the two of them safely back at Wayne Manor.  No explanation
whatsoever.  To quote Lenny from the Simpsons: "We won't bore you with the
details of our miraculous escape."
        It gets worse.  In an attempt to assumedly add a comic-book feel to
the film, the director has inserted cartoon sound effects into the fight
scenes.  For example, when one of the evil henchmen falls down a staircase,
we hear a sound similar to Wile E. Coyote falling off a cliff.  Whether this
was supposed to inspire laughter is unknown.  It did get a reaction from me,
though I doubt very much it was the one the director wanted.
        In the most vomitous feel-good ending of the summer, Mr. Freeze helps
Batman cure Alfred of a crippling disease.  It just so happens that Freeze is
the world's leading expert on this particular disease.  That's pushing
believability as it is... but would you believe Freeze just happens to carry
the cure for the disease in his armband?  My, isn't that convenient.
        Next, stir in a lousy soundtrack and lots of people flying around on
wires that are almost invisible during the fight scenes.  Add a dash of some
of the most poorly-handled special effects of the summer, sprinkled in with
some gratingly bad puns courtesy of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.  Is the
bile rising yet?
        Arnold's acting has all the depth and range I've come to expect from
his post-Conan movies, which is to say, none at all.  His films, however, are
more about attitude than acting, and I can't really hold his performance
against him.  In a movie like "The Running Man," where the story is strong
enough to let me ignore his terrible line-reads, it's not a problem... but in
"Batman and Robin," it's simply one more thing to bristle at.  It doesn't
help that most of his dialogue consists of groanably bad puns, either.  And
not bad in a fun kind of way; just really *awful*.
        Alicia Silverstone is fine in her role, but it's so poorly written
that it could do her professional reputation more harm than good.  Her
character alternates between strong and fragile, determined and waffling.
Poor Alicia; I know she tried hard, and I don't fault her.  Same with Uma
and Chris O'Donnell; no problems with them personally, except they should've
had the will-power to turn down a script this bad.
        This movie also attempts to set the Women's Rights movement back
thirty years.  Every woman in this film is portrayed very badly, from the
aforementioned Alicia Silverstone to Bruce Wayne's marriage-hungry girlfriend
(Elle MacPherson).  And Uma?  Well, Batgirl comments on Uma's character:
"People like you give women a bad name!"  True enough.
        If the movie has one good thing, it's George Clooney.  Many folks are
in strong disagreement with me, but I thought his performance as Batman was at
least as strong as Keaton's.  I don't watch TV so I've never seen whatever
show he's on ("ER," maybe?), but I liked him here.  Unfortunately, no matter
how talented Clooney may be as an actor, he can't carry a film when the
script has him doing nothing more than standing around, staring, and
occasionally barking such helpful lines as "Let's go!" and "That was close!"
Despite all that, Clooney was surprisingly likeable... which says quite a
bit about his screen presence.
        One thing the film gets right is the depiction of Gotham itself.
Like Burton, Schumacher knows how to create memorable images of a city
caught in the struggle of good and evil.  Some of the scenes of frozen
city streets (courtesy of Mr. Freeze) are particularly well done.  The
lighting, costumes and sets are all lovely... but a few pretty pictures
aren't enough to save this clunker.
        In conclusion: There are worse movies in existence, but it still
hurts to encounter a film this far off the mark.  With a better script,
this could've been the ultimate Batman extravaganza; instead, one is left
with what could only generously be called a mediocre film.  Better luck next
time, Mr. Schumacher.  We'll be waiting... same bat time, same bat channel.</P>
