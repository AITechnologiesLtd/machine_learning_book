<PRE>DR. DOLITTLE 2
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In DR. DOLITTLE 2, Eddie Murphy repeats his role as the sweet doctor who has the
gift of gab with animals.  With female humans, especially his now dating,
16-year-old daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone), Dr. Dolittle is anything but the
alpha male that he tries to get his animal friends to be.  </P>
<P>A sometimes cute but too often flat tale, this sequel tries to get by with easy
to devise, recycled humor ranging from piles of pigeon poop to a large, gaseous
bear (voiced by Steve Zahn).  Even the music choices lack originality.  How many
movies have featured "I Will Survive" recently?  There are so many that I've
lost count.</P>
<P>Sometimes redoing old themes can be funny.  The best of these is a takeoff on
THE GODFATHER, in which a beaver offers the doctor some fish in return for
future services.  When he refuses to accept the fish, Joey the Raccoon (voiced
by Michael Rapaport) warns him, "Hey, the beaver offers you fish.  You take the
fish!"</P>
<P>Using the canonical kids' movie theme, the story features evil and unscrupulous
big businessmen -- Are there any other kind in kids' shows? -- who are out to
despoil the environment.  Specifically, these guys, played by Jeffrey Jones and
Kevin Pollak, work for a lumber company that is going to cut down trees so that
people can live in houses.  Shocking.</P>
<P>Still, some of the animals are cute.  Pepito (voiced by Jacob Vargas), for
example, is a chameleon with a "broken blender."  No matter how hard he tries to
switch color schemes, he just stays an icky green.  And some of the scenes, like
one involving a dog support group, in which the doctor has the dogs repeat in
unison, "I am somebody's best friend," will bring a smile to your face.  The
result is an innocuous, but far from inspired film.  Wait for video when the
rental price will better reflect the value of the entertainment.</P>
<P>DR. DOLITTLE 2 runs 1:21.  It is rated PG for language and crude humor and would
be acceptable for most kids.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ***, liking the animal humor and the funny
musical numbers.  His cousins, Jacob, age 8, and Matthew, age 5, both gave it
*** as well.  Jacob's favorite part was "the bear going to the bathroom," and
Matthew liked the talking bear parts best.  None of them laughed much during the
movie, but they smiled a lot.</P>
<P>The film is playing now in nationwide release in the United States.  In the
Silicon Valley, it is showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.</P>
