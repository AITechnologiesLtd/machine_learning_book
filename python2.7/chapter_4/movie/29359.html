<PRE>                JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK
                 A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: The running gag pair of characters from all of Kevin
    Smith's films gets their own movie.  The gags are sporadically
    funny.  It is more than occasionally funny for teens who are
    fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes.  The plot is
    weak and  the leads are not a particularly funny comic team.
    The little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and
    particularly at Kevin Smith films are the best features of the
    film.  Sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the
    film worth watching.  This feels like the high school skit that
    that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night.
    (And it turns out he had very good reasons.)  Rating: 4
    (0 to 10), low 0 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>A film needs a plot.  It needs characters for empathy value.  It
needs a story and an emotional center.  If a film is just a chain
of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will
succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are.  Kevin Smith has
now made two satisfying films, CLERKS and CHASING AMY.  With DOGMA
he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a
madcap romp.  Peter Cook and Dudley Moore did that very
successfully with their BEDAZZLED.  But getting the combination to
work is very hard to do right and Kevin Smith's fecal monsters in
DOGMA were not the way to do it.  His remaining two films,
MALLRATS and his new JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK are aimed
squarely at a teenage audience.  JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK is
a compendium of gay jokes, penis jokes, flatulence jokes, film
pastiches, and in-jokes.  How funny the jokes are will be a
subjective call.  For me, the vast majority of the jokes were just
not very funny.  There was not enough cleverness or variety.  It
is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay.
Penis jokes work only so many times.</P>
<P>Showing up as minor characters in every Kevin Smith film Jay and
Silent Bob were a clever pair of human running gags.  They were
sort of the modern equivalents of Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford,
the comic duo who showed up satirizing the English middle class in
several good British post-war films including DEAD OF NIGHT, THE
LADY VANISHES, and PASSPORT TO PIMLICO.  Jay and Silent Bob were
originally supposedly typical Generation X stoners.  As the series
wore on they had larger and larger parts.  In JAY AND SILENT BOB
STRIKE BACK they are the leads.</P>
<P>Jay and Silent Bob (played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) are
chased away from the front of the convenience store where they
were dealing drugs in CLERKS.  This leaves them at loose ends.
They are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives
when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled
on them will be adapted into a movie.  They decide to devote their
lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie
industry cash.  So it is off to Hollywood to shake down the movie
company and having adventures along the way.  The film is mostly
about their adventures on the road and when they get to Hollywood</P>
<P>The problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his
weight to make the film funny.  Silent Bob, being silent, can only
contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive
face of his.  This makes his piece of the comedy even less than a
straight man like a Dean Martin or Bud Abbott would have.  Jay has
to be the comic.  He could carry the load for both if he were
extremely inventive.  The problem is that he is not sufficiently
funny.  He is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do
not show any comic flair.  So Jay and Silent Bob are a long way
from being a successful comic team.  Their starring roles and the
low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for
people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just
minutes before.</P>
<P>Like DOGMA before it, but definitely not like CHASING AMY, this
film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie.
Certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all
involving.  They are excuses for gags, many of which still fall
flat.  It is DOGMA without any of the humorous theological
content.  The film does not offer much to an adult audience.  I
rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
