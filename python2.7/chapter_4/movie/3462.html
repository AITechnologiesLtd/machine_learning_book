<P>     Forget cancer.  That life-stealer, which has fueled tear-jerkers
from TERMS OF ENDEARMENT to MY LIFE, is passe, its position usurped by
AIDS.  Apparently, PHILADELPHIA was just the tip of the iceberg, and,
if THE CURE is any indication, the American movie-going population may
be on the verge of a deluge.  One problem immediately comes to mind,
however--how the grueling ordeal of the victim can be made palatable
for mass market audiences.  THE CURE offers a possibility, and it's not
a pleasant one, for, as presented in this film, the bane of AIDS offers
a noble, sanitized death.  The Hollywood portrait of suffering here is
in stark contrast to the gut-wrenching reality of SILVERLAKE LIFE:  THE
VIEW FROM HERE, Peter Friedman and Tom Joslin's 1993 documentary about
living with and dying from AIDS.</P>
<P>     If you're looking for a watered-down AIDS movie that goes for the
easy way out every time, THE CURE is perfect.  It's the kind of
production that would be at home as a TV after school special.  In the
most pedantic and obvious fashion possible, it ticks off all the
appropriate truths:  people shouldn't be reviled because they have
AIDS, AIDS is not an airborne contagion, you don't have to be gay to
get AIDS, and some gay people are even "nice."  Of course, these are
all valid messages for a motion picture to disseminate to a
largely-ignorant public, but THE CURE presents them in a preachy and
awkward manner.  Good intentions combined with poor execution don't add
up to much.</P>
<P>     The story centers around two neighboring boys:  Erik (Brad Renfro
of THE CLIENT), a loner with a self-absorbed, often-drunk mother (Diana
Scarwid), and Dexter (Joseph Mazzello of JURASSIC PARK and
SHADOWLANDS), an AIDS victim whose only friend is his loving mom
(Anabella Sciorra).  After a few conversations through a fence, Erik
and Dexter meet face-to- face, the former having to overcome a fear of
getting physically close to someone in Dexter's condition.  However,
following this first meeting, it doesn't take long for the two to
become pals, and their growing friendship leads Erik to help Dexter
begin a search for a cure to rid him of the scourge threatening to
claim his life.</P>
<P>     In general, the script, which has a tendency to paint everything
with broad strokes in black and white, is not well-written.  While
there are several scenes that are wonderfully insightful (such as an
incident when Erik and Dexter covertly flip through an issue of
PLAYBOY, then come into contact with two "real" women), these represent
high points in a screenplay that often relies upon coincidence,
contrivance, and manipulation.  The ultimate goal of THE CURE is to
wring a few tears from everyone in the audience, and it tries
everything in pursuit of that aim.</P>
<P>     Character development proceeds along predictable, and not
especially deep, lines.  These aren't real people; they've been lifted
from stock.  Does anyone doubt that Erik and Dexter are destined to be
good friends?  Can anyone not see that Dexter's mom will develop
maternal feelings for her son's only buddy?  Is there any doubt that
Erik's mother, the personification of AIDS-paranoia, homophobia, and
alcoholism all-in-one, is actually a reincarnation of the Wicked
Witch?  In fact, actress Diana Scarwid drips so much meanness that she
comes across as laughably absurd.</P>
<P>     I found one scene in THE CURE somewhat alarming, and possibly a
little irresponsible.  In an instance when Erik and Dexter are menaced
by a knife-wielding bully, the AIDS-infected child calmly slices his
own hand, brandishes the open wound, and intones, "My blood is like
poison." This particular method of fighting back gets the job done--the
man runs away--but it also potentially reinforces several negative
stereotypes about AIDS and AIDS victims.  Is the single camera shot of
cuts on the attacker's arm enough to clue the audience in that
blood-to-blood contact is necessary for a possible transmission?  Or
will the less-enlightened viewer come away thinking that a drop of HIV+
blood is deadly even if it touches only unbroken skin?</P>
<P>     There were plenty of wet eyes at the screening of THE CURE I
attended, which indicates that the movie was accomplishing something.
It does this, however, through shameless and intrusive manipulation
that is less concerned about emotional honesty than pulling strings.
Had the characters been more than thinly-sketched types and had the
story contained a few more of those "special" moments of bonding
between the two children, THE CURE might have been a heartwarming,
heartbreaking tale.  As it is, this film left me longing for another
viewing of SILVERLAKE LIFE or, failing that, PHILADELPHIA.  Both
present the same themes as THE CURE, but in a manner that is both
poignant and effective.</P>
