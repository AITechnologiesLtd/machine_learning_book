<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        I'm not sure of the Negotiator to which the title of this film refers: 
is it Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson), a Negotiator accused of taking
hostages to prove his innocence, or is it Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey),
the Negotiator Roman wants called in to talk to him?  Perhaps it's not
important.  What is important is that Roman has been accused of killing
his partner, and now his friends and colleagues all believe he's is
guilty.  So, he heads up to the Internal Affairs office, where he
suspects Inspector Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) is conspiring against him.  And
he takes everyone hostage.</P>
<P>        The Negotiator is, unfortunately, a professional execution of a very
mediocre script.  I came close to recommending the film with more
enthusiasm, but the problems in the story grew very tiresome by the last
scene.  Like so many thrillers, The Negotiator starts off with an
interesting premise and concludes with sequences that make no sense.  It
should have been all psychological, featuring a showdown between two
terrific actors (Jackson and Spacey).  It has great scenes between the
two, but there's too much contrived plot here to fully enjoy the
chemistry.  By the time the credits rolled, I wondered if I had seen a
masked entry into the Fugitive series.  </P>
<P>        The film was directed by F. Gary Gray, and he is good at what he does. 
Just about every scene here -- even the ridiculous ones at the end --
are sharp and exciting.  Consider, if you've seen the film, the scene in
which men armed with machine guns go in to kill Roman, without Sabian's
consent.  Gray shoots this scene with skill, and it has the kind of
claustrophobic feel that action scenes in small places need to be
successful.  The problem is that the scene is not necessary, nor is it
realistic.  The Negotiator's strongest points are in the electricity of
the dialogue, and scenes like this break my concentration. 
Screenwriters should learn that, more often than not, words are more 
interesting than bullets.</P>
<P>        But there is a lot to like about this film, particularly in the
performances and Gray's observation of them.  Spacey is a miracle of an
actor, and I'm elated that he's not being typecast as a psycho.  The
first scene with him is terrific, showing him in a comical scene with
his family (this scene is also nice because few thrillers even take the
time to show us a little bit about the characters).  Physically, Spacey
is not an imposing man -- he's actually much shorter than most of the
other actors in this film -- but he has a way of delivering dialogue
that demands attention.  He's a magnetic screen presence, and one of the
few of these who can actually act.</P>
<P>        Jackson is equally good, and plays the desperate man well.  Jackson is
one of the more versatile actors working today, proving in film after
film that he's not bound by any limitations as a performer.  He speaks
his lines with conviction and ease, and never lets the audience slip out
of the moment.  The two actors are fascinating together, even when
speaking through a telephone.  One of the best scenes in the film is a
moment in which the two stars and the director are working perfectly in
sync -- just as Sabian arrives on the scene, and he's talking to Roman
for the first time, the two men speak calmly as Sabian is preparing to
negotiate with him.  It's hard to explain the energy in this scene, but
it's all visual, displaying the talent of the actors intertwined with
Gray's swift style.  </P>
<P>        There are also some terrific supporting performances.  Paul Giamatti,
whom I will always remember as Howard Stern's nemesis, Pig Vomit, is in
every movie this summer; here, he's hilarious as one of the hostages. 
David Morse continues with his string of roles that require him to play
bad ass military guys (which he does well).  The late J.T. Walsh is
adequately dark as the mean Internal Affairs bad guy.  And Regina Taylor
gives a good performance as Roman's wife.  None of the characterizations
in this film are particularly strong, but it's one of the few pictures
I've seen in which acting talent actually makes up for the lack of
characters.</P>
<P>        Reader, you can't understand how much I want to like this movie just a
little bit more than I do.  The acting is so good.  The direction is so
good.  But the script is so silly, so profoundly dumb, and so shameless
in its regression from interesting to absurd, that I just can't quite
say that The Negotiator is a good film and live on with my clear
conscience.  Why did we have to have another story about a man clearing
his innocence?  Why did I need to see more silly scenes in which people
hack into computers to find out hidden information (the computer is the
*worst* place to keep incriminating information)?  Why did there have to
be silly shootouts, and machinegun battles in close quarters?  Actors
this talented don't need all this plot -- just contrive a crisis, put
them in a room, and let them do the rest.</P>
