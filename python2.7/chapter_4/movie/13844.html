<PRE>SPY HARD (1996)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Chris Casino</PRE>
<P>** out of **** (fair for cable, but don't go out of your way for it)</P>
<P>Cast: Leslie Nielsen (Dick Steele), Nicholette Sheridan (Veronique
Urinksy), Charles Durning (the Director), Barry Bostwick (Norman
Coleman), Mason Gamble (McCluckey), Andy Griffith (General
Rancor).</P>
<P>Crew: Directed by Rick Friedberg, Written by Rick Friedberg,
Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzner & Dick Chudnow. Produced
by Rick Friedberg, Dick Chudnow, & Leslie Nielsen.</P>
<P>The problem with this mediocre spoof of spy movies
(which should've been much better considering how
good it's star is at this kind of stuff)
is so simple, and that makes me think the person
who gave it the green light must have an I.Q.
lower than Forrest Gump not to realize it.
And I'll get to that in a minute.</P>
<P>Special Agent Dick Steele (Nielsen, who rises above the material,
as he is his usual funny self here) lost his girlfriend
fifteen years ago to his longtime nemesis, General Rancor
(Griffith, who is totally pathetic!) in a parody of CLIFFHANGER,
which caused him to retire. Fifteen years later, Rancor
is still alive and armless. He's preparing to blow up
the world (or something like that, I only saw
this once, give me a break, will you?) with a
prototype bomb invented by special agent 3.14 (Sheridan)'s
father, and Steele is called back into duty.</P>
<P>Anyway, the problem with this movie is, the people
who made the movie are amateurs when it comes to
the parody field (they never even did a film!), and you 
can tell because they try to copy the Zucker Bros. and 
Jim Abrahams and think they can get away with it.
As a result, the occasional misfired joke that
is inevitably found in a Zucker Bros. film every now
and then is all over the place in this movie.</P>
<P>I'm not blaming any of this on Leslie Nielsen,
however. You always have to call him
when you want a parody leading man done
correctly because people like Armand Assante
(FATAL INSTINCT) and Emillo Estevez (LOADED
WEAPON ONE) don't even compare to him.
He's good at this kind of stuff, and he's
always funny. Here is no exception.
In fact, he's the best part of this
movie. If not for him, this movie
might've been worse than FATAL INSTINCT, if that is
at all possible.</P>
<P>Avoid this, please. If you want to see a funny spy movie
spoof, stick to AUSTIN POWERS.</P>
