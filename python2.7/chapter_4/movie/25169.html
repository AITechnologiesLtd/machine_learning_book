<P>I grew up in 1970's Detroit, not very far from Grosse Point--the setting
in both time and place for this movie--but it might as well have been
set in a galaxy far, far away in the year 2525, for all intents and
purposes.  It's like my Grandfather Wolfe used'ta say: "Some things are
universal; but some shit's just Weird."</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Life according to The Virgin Suicides shows that 1970's Grosse Pointe,
Michigan to be a place of superficial calm and temporary beauty; the
beauty would be erased by the cutting-down of numerous dead trees that
lined the neighborhood, and the calm would be shattered by neighborhood
gossips, scavenging reporters, and a strange family for whom the word
"dysfunctional" was probably coined.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) are completely
out-of-touch with their five teenage daughters, 13-year-old Cecilia
(Hanna Hall), 14-year-old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), 15-year-old Bonnie
(Chelse Swain), 16-year-old Mary (A.J. Cook), and 17-year-old Therese
(Leslie Hayman).  The neighborhood boys [their names are listed above;
hellifi could tell you which one was which] are fascinated by the girls,
especially after Cecilia commits suicide--and local stud, Trip Fontaine
(Josh Hartnett), takes a liking to Lux.  Unfortunately, Lux's burgeoning
libido, and Trip's massive brain spasm, combine for disasterous effects
for the four remaining sisters.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
In my review of AMERICAN BEAUTY earlier this year, I disagreed with The
Diva's AB review, on the basis of how she saw the dysfunctions in the
families that were its primary focus; but Diva could've as easily been
writing on-point about the Lisbon family - and more precisely, about the
disconnect I felt with damn near everything about "Virgin".  That last
bit is key: because where I felt that I "knew" good old Lester and
Carolyn and the rest of the gang, I haven't the slightest clue _what_
the Lisbon family's deal was.  And what's more: I just couldn't bring
myself to care.</P>
<P>Maybe it was the sheer number of unexplained - no, make that _undefined_
- characters.  Lux was fairly easy to pick out of a crowd; Kirsten Dunst
is a force to be reckoned with, even when everything around her seems to
be less-than-gelled.  And the Trip Fontaine character, as played by Josh
"Young Tommy Lee Jones" Hartnett, also seemed otherworldy.  Looking at
the movie on terms of these two characters and actors, you get a
*completely* different vibe than what happens when the rest of the
motley crew joins in.</P>
<P>Most of the other characters, and moreso, the actors who played them,
seemed to be in a psychedelic haze, wondering what exactly their
Motivation was supposed to be.  Particularly jarring were James Woods
and Kathleen Turner (who hasn't aged well at all, poor girl) as Ma and
Pa Lisbon; both actors seemed worlds away from what their resumes have
shown they're capable of.  As for their characters, all signs pointed to
their Major Problem being somehow involved (to a detrimental point) with
religion.  I think.  Or maybe it was just the ill-effects of being in a
community full of neighbors as rotten as the rapidly dying trees, who
knows.  Or, cares.  The rest [say it in a B&W Gilliganese fashion -
"...the movie star/and the rest..." - and you'll Feel me] of the
characters - with possibly the exception of Chase (Anthony DeSimone) -
blended into a chorus of sorts, having no real distinguishing marks to
tell one from the other.  The credits for the cast list ironically told
me more about who was who, than anything I saw on-screen. I included the
detailed cast and character list above, just for giggles; it would take
a supreme act to make me want to actually include all of the numerous
undefined players within the body of this review.</P>
<P>To her credit, though, writer/director Sophia Coppola showed some
gutsiness in putting "Virgin" together.  Knowing her primarily as
Francis Ford Coppola's sproggen, and the worst thing about a pretty bad
rendering of GODFATHER 3 (1 and 2 were masterpieces; wha'happen?), I was
prepared to write this one off early on, and probably would not have
gone to see it at all had it not been for favorable buzz about this
project [makes me wonder just what movie those critics saw; but, Strokes
For Folks].  Coppola was a lot more competent than I would've given her
credit for, and though I couldn't catch her groove, I could definitely
see her distinctive style shining through.  Wasn't quite enough to win
me over, but still, I give props where props are due.</P>
<P>Usually, when I see based-on-a-book movies that I don't particularly
like, I have a hankerin' to read the book.  Not so, this time.  One
thing, though: whoever decided that this film was a "dark comedy", was
probably smokin' whatever Trip left behind in his roach clip.  Just Say
No, dude; Just Say No.</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line:
I used to sweat it when I watched an Art Fillum and just didn't see what
everyone was raving about. Bump *that*; I haven't got time for the pain.
Call me uncouth if you wanna - hey, I've been called worse - but I just
couldn't get with this one.  I like my Dysfunctional Families a little
more understandable in their dysfunctions; weird for weird's sake just
goes right past me.  So when's American Beauty coming out on DVD, eh?</P>
<P>THE VIRGIN SUICIDES (rating: yellowlight):
Certainly killed two hours of *my* day.</P>
