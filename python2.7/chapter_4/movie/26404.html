<P>        Imagine Trainspotting without any trace of humor and you're on the
right track.  Picture Pasolini's Salo: 120 Days of Sodom shot by some
MTV music video kid interested in the novelty of his new camera.  Darren
Aronofsky (Pi) stacks one degrading sight atop another without
implicating the viewer, nor providing any framework or reference for his
visual rape of his audience  - all smoke and mirrors disguising a great,
vapid emptiness.</P>
<P>        For starters, I've never seen Coney Island junkies who look as pretty
as Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), who bear a passing
resemblance to the kids from Calvin Klein ads.  They're drug dealers who
have high aspirations, saving their earnings for a better tomorrow. 
Placing all their cash in a locker, they sit under the boardwalk smoking
up and dreaming their grandiose dreams.  Too bad they get high too often
off their own supply.  The good times can't last forever.</P>
<P>        The drug use scenes are done in vivid smash cuts showing dilating
pupils, squeezing needles, the sizzle of white powder cooked in a
spoon.  We never see these kids shoot up -- rather, we see abstract
images.  Every time this technique appears, it's too flashy and aware of
its own experimental filmmaking approach, a purely stylistic flourish.</P>
<P>        Kronos Quartet wrote the driving, thumping, angry, brutal violin score
which drums like a hammer and chain beating you into submission.  Harry,
Tyrone, and their ambitious if drug addled friend Marion (a very good
Jennifer Connelly), who could be a great designer were it not for her
plunge into addiction, eventually become slaves to their own destructive
destinies.  They run out of money, and in the second half of the movie
they move through a bleak winter, suffering the eternal torments of the
damned.</P>
<P>        Each situation is set up so neatly, we're certain where the path will
lead.  Harry sports a nasty welt on his arm which doesn't look so good. 
Tyrone discovers that maybe that trip to Florida to track down some
fresh supply was a bad idea -- since them southern boys don't like
colored folk.  Marion eventually telephones a sadistic pimp (Keith
David) and sells her body for drugs.</P>
<P>        The movie's first scene involves Harry stealing his mom's television
set.  She can always go right down the block in half an hour and buy it
back.  That's their adorable dog and pony show, and poor Sara Goldfarb
(Ellen Burstyn) is too nice, too soft around the edges, so apathetic she
won't do anything about it.  Her husband is dead, Harry is all she's got
left.</P>
<P>        Ellen Burstyn is so good, so unglamorous and believable as a Brighton
Beach Jewish mama, that she shines through Aronofsky's bag of tricks and
delivers a strong, sad, comic performance.  At first, Sara seems to
share the addiction of the film's other characters, endlessly watching
her television, but when she gets a surprise phone call asking her to
appear on a TV show she realizes she's too overweight to fit into the
red dress her husband once admired her in.  She goes on a diet.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately for the audience, midway through we realize that Sara's
in trouble.  She's gone to a quack doctor for some diet pills, which
turn out to be speed.  She's gnashing her teeth in no time, and the
worst is yet to come.</P>
<P>        Sara's refrigerator starts roaring like a lion as the images become
fuzzy and, well, straight out of Terry Gilliam's superior Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas.  In short order, Sara wears the same junkie shoes
as her younger co-stars.  While it's painful to watch a harmless old
woman descend into the circle of hell, she could easily have escaped it
by going to another doctor for a second opinion.</P>
<P>        Some critics are sure to fawn over Requiem.  It goes further than most
films into uncomfortable territory, and the spinning visuals are
technically accomplished.  I'm sure Darren Aronofsky's courage will be
extolled -- yes, it's so bold to show human misery without sympathy or
understanding.</P>
<P>        I'm not against violence or torture onscreen.  The best film to compare
Requiem to is Pasolini's Salo.  Wisely, Pasolini used restraint with his
camera and simply filmed people being sexually abused and beaten without
showy fanfare.  Salo creates a hollow, disturbing feeling of
helplessness.</P>
<P>        Ultimately, Aronofsky lacks that crucial insight when showing the
nature of horror.  His gaze feels inexperienced.  Perhaps young
filmmakers should not attempt to tackle the bleak world before they have
had a chance to go through it themselves.  (Salo was Pasolini's final
film; Mike Leigh's bleak Naked was made when he was middle aged.)</P>
<P>Once we get past the notion that addiction is a horrible thing (which I
don't believe is news to anyone who will watch Requiem for a Dream), the
question remains: What purpose does this film serve?  Let me know if you
figure it out.</P>
