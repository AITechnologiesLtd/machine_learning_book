<PRE>THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS (M).  
(Paramount/UIP) 
Director: Sam Weisman
Stars: Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, John Cleese, Mark McKinney, Joe 
Grifasi, Josh Mostel
Running time: 90 minutes.</PRE>
<P>Neil Simon's 1970 comedy about a married couple from Ohio who
experience a series of comic disasters during their first visit to New
York City gets the '90's treatment in this largely unfunny and
unnecessary remake.</P>
<P>Reunited for the first time since 1992's Housesitter, Steve
Martin and Goldie Hawn work hard to recapture some of the chemistry
and rapport.  Martin brings his usual uptight persona and mannerisms
to his performance as Henry Clarke, an advertising executive who heads
off to New York for a job interview.  At the last minute his bored and
lonely wife Nancy (Hawn) decides to accompany him.  The couple even
run afoul of a supercilious, cross dressing hotel manager (John
Cleese, of course!, whose performance suggests a tired trans-Atlantic
Basil Fawlty).  Through a series of increasingly frenetic disasters,
the pair come to gradually rekindle that spark of adventure and
excitement that has disappeared from their 24 year marriage.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, writer Marc Lawrence (who previously scripted
the banal romantic comedy Forces Of Nature) strips away much of the
neurotic tone from Simon's original script.  He also dispenses with
the sharp writing and the pithy one-liners that are almost trademark
Simon.  Instead, Lawrence opts for a rather formulaic and
disappointing odd couple comedy that liberally draws upon elements of
Planes, Trains And Automobiles and Fawlty Towers, amongst others.  In
fact, Martin even gets to play another car rental scene, albeit a
rather laboured and pale copy of that classic hilarious moment from
Planes, Trains, etc.</P>
<P>Martin gives another variation of his familiar straight laced,
middle class white collar suburban dweller, although a few scenes do
allow him some room for the kind of physical comedy at which he is
adept.  Hawn shines through, and works hard to make some preposterous
material seem better than it actually is.  Only Cleese seems to bring
any energy to the film, and he is not on screen often enough.</P>
<P>There are some good moments throughout, but they are far and
few between.  For much of its duration, The Out-Of-Towners is a tired,
laboured and unfunny comedy.  And everyone involved, including veteran
tv director Sam Weisman (George Of the Jungle, etc), seems to know it.</P>
