<P>Plot: The Clock family are Borrowers, tiny people who live hidden inside 
the walls of a human house and secretly sneak out to borrow objects for 
their own use. Teenage Arrietty is found by and befriends a human boy, 
Pete Lender, just in time to learn the human owners are being evicted 
and the house to be demolished by lawyer Ocious P. Potter. Pete's 
attempt to move them goes wrong and Arrietty and her brother are left 
behind where they witness Potter obtaining the deed that rightfully 
belongs to the Lenders. Grabbing it, they are then frenetically pursued 
by Potter who brings in an exterminator to put them down at all costs.</P>
<P>This is the third adaption of Mary Norton's popular series of children's 
books about the adventures of a family of tiny people who live in the 
wainscotting of a human house. The first book was first published in 
1952 and led to four sequels between then and 1982. The first film 
adaption was a little seen production made in 1973 about which I can 
find next to no information. The second and best was two sets of 
six-part half-hour British-made tv serials which aired in 1993 and 1994 
respectively, adapting the first four books under the umbrella title 
`The Borrowers'. The British serials and this 1997 Anglo-American 
co-production make for interesting comparisons. The tv serials had a 
quiet sense of wondrous adventure that was balanced with a droll 
understatement in a way that was quite sublime. On the other hand this 
film, while retaining the basic idea and the same principal characters, 
has thrown out most other semblances to turn the books into a big-screen 
special effects extravaganza. Case in point being the scene where 
Arrietty befriends the human boy and introduces him to her parents - the 
first serial took several episodes to develop the friendship before it 
was found out by her parents; the film doesn't even bother with the 
scene of taking him to meet her parents but simply cuts from Pod saying 
he will never accept the idea to the boy placing them in a box to be 
moved. Here the books have been reworked to turn them into a take on 
`Home Alone', with John Goodman having been written in as an odious 
lawyer whose sole purpose is to act as a slapstick butt of the ingenuity 
of the little people.</P>
<P>But if one is prepared to take the film on this level, it does such with 
a considerable degree of energy and visual invention. The balance of big 
and small sets and special effects is amazingly good and there are some 
delightful set-pieces with characters trapped on lit lightbulbs; 
pole-vaulting across sinks, skidding along pieces of soap and 
trampolining off appliance handles to get across a kitchen; becoming 
trapped inside the fridge in an attempt to steal ice-cream; and 
enthralling scenes racing to avoid the villain as he smashes a hammer 
through the wall and so forth. But the film is only really constructed 
around these effects set-pieces and, while it entertains a good deal, 
one wishes it had slowed a little to allow the story more time.</P>
<P>There is a rather bizarre design scheme to the whole film which tries to 
create a fantastacized 1950s Midlands industrial city landscape - sort 
of like a combination of `Coronation Street' (if one can imagine 
`Coronation Street''s brick backstreets with airships moored above them) 
and the Gothic industrial nightmare city out of the first `Batman' film 
(but with the lights turned up). And in a gag that has been stolen 
directly from Peter Jackson's `Meet the Feebles' all the vehicles in the 
film are Morris Minors, including the joke of having the villain of the 
piece ride in a black stretch Morris Minor.</P>
