                       A film review by Chad Polenz

<P>*** (out of 4 = good)
1994,, R, 124 minutes [2 hours, 4 minutes]
[satire]
starring: Johnny Depp (Ed Wood), Martin Landou (Bela Lugosi), Sarah Jessica
Parker (Delores Wood), written by Scott Alexander, Larry Karaszewski,
produced by Denise Di Novi, Tim Burton, directed by Tim Burton.</P>
<P>Did you ever wonder who made those bad sci-fi/horror movies they show at 2
a.m. that also end up being ridiculed on "Mystery Science Theater 3000"? Well
Edward D. Wood Jr. is the man responsible for starting an entire industry of
bad movies, unfortunately he never really saw it that way, and "Ed Wood" is a
good satirical portrait of his life.</P>
<P>Ed Wood was a man so in love with the filmmaking process itself he didn't
care if things went wrong, the script was terrible, or the props were fake.
To him, it's not about scrutiny, it's about the joy of the movies and as long
as people are having fun nothing else matters. Johnny Depp is excellent as
the quite neurotic, obsessive, cross-dressing Ed Wood. He starts his
showbusiness career by taking on projects no one else will touch, with
stories so terrible it's a wonder they're even thought up. He writes his own
scripts, does all the casting, and even manages to raise the money to make
the movies himself. </P>
<P>But Ed has a heart, he knows who the respected people in the business are
like Orson Wells, and feels the need to succeed as his role models have done.
One day, he stumbles upon Bela Lugosi (Landou), a symbolic character in films
of these types. He's a morphine addict, and thinks he's still a huge star but
can't accept the fact he's a wash-up. Lugosi is going broke, but much like
Ed, he is so in love with film he'll take any job just to work. It's obvious
we are meant to feel for the pathetic old man, but the attitude of the film
isn't some type of sappy melodrama, it is a satire through and through. </P>
<P>Even Ed's home life is portrayed in a very satirical and funny manner, as a
parody of 50s sit-coms. The dialogue is so over-the-top it's hard to tell
what's scripted and what's improvised.</P>
<P>There is a fair amount of events and actions going on in this movie, yet
there is no specific plot, just the adventures of Ed Wood. We see him pitch
his ideas and not understand how anyone couldn't like anything shown to them
on a screen. He actually believes the audience is scared by his monsters and
aliens, and he is going to win an Oscar for his work. Ed and his crew aren't
even discouraged when they are attacked by an angry mob of frustrated
movie-goers!</P>
<P>Finally Ed embarks on the infamous "Plan 9 From Outer Space," a film so bad
and so stupid it's almost brilliant. One of the final scenes depicts the
opening night of "Plan 9" and we can see the excitement bristling in Ed's
eyes. His face is so lit up with joy he is in ecstasy just watching the
picture... it's both pathetic and funny.</P>
<P>I liked "Ed Wood" even though there wasn't much to it. It has a great sense
of mood and is very clever overall. Why did he make all those bad movies
anyway? The good thing about this film is that it doesn't try to answer that
question (6/4/96) (1/18/97) (6/11/97) [see also: "Barton Fink," also by
Burton: "Batman"]</P>
