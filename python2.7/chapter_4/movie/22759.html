Supernova</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>"Karl Larson, he's the worst nightmare I ever met," a repulsed Angela
Bassett, chief medical expert aboard the Nightingale 229 medical rescue
vessel, warns of an emergency caller from a distant star sector. Robert
Forster (of "Jackie Brown" fame) decides to react without regard for
Angela's caution, risking the ship and crew in a dangerous "plasma warp" in
order to heed Larson's call. Actually, the warp sequence is pretty cool.</P>
<P>Forster is a strong actor; too bad he isn't used much. Co-pilot Spader (who
you might not recognize from his big-haired "Sex, Lies, and Videotapes"
days) picks up the slack. He performs the sharp, soft-spoken, tough-guy role
flawlessly. He and Angela flirt maturely; while crew members Lou Diamond and
Robin Tunny are considerably less subtle. Even less subtle in this respect,
Peter Facinelli (reminiscent of a Tom Cruise) is powerfully menacing,
alluringly buff, and dramatically "as strong as a horse." He's a very good
bad guy.</P>
<P>Seems our distress caller, Peter, has brought a little something special on
board: something erotically enticing and cosmically tragic, something "as
smart as God and a lot less nice." It's a fine core around which to script a
film. However well conceived, the picture ignores this beautiful object's
potential gravity, neglecting it for bad-guy-on-board action that just
happens to be in 22nd century space. For this reason, the title and the film
become somewhat estranged.</P>
<P>Trivial side note: A cool sounding name, "Supernova" refers to the explosion
of a star; but ironically, roughly translated in Spanish means "a big no
go." (Chevy realized this some years back.)</P>
<P>"Supernova" is simple, but well paced. It's graphically clean on the screen
and offers a bit of mindless movie fun. If you can endure a couple of "Leave
me behind and take the patient" kind of silly heroisms, as well as a lack of
real substance, you won't have a bad time.</P>
