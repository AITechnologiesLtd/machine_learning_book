<PRE>THE BABY OF MACON
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        No other filmmaker, living or dead, could have made "The Baby of
Mâcon."  And no other filmmaker would have wanted to.</P>
<P>        Peter Greenaway's controversial and rarely-seen 1993 film saw a
very limited run here in the United States, opening in New York and L.A.
and then disappearing forever.  Its content--your typical Greenaway
excesses of murder, gang rape, disembowelment, dismemberment, full-frontal
nudity, and more philosophical and allegorical allusions than you can shake
a stick at--was judged too offensive, and the film failed to find a U.S.
distributor.</P>
<PRE>        That's unfortunate, because it's one of the director's best.</PRE>
<P>        "The Baby of Mâcon" is staged as a 17th century masque performed
before a live theater audience of Medici noblemen and women.  Unfolding
like a spectacular Renaissance tapestry, the film makes full use of
Greenaway's huge and non-traditional cinematic palette, a
highly-ritualistic style that emphasizes the filmmaker's straight-laced
approach to the film's unsettling themes.  In "The Baby of Mâcon,"
Greenaway employs widescreen, saturated hues (a lot of the time it looks
like it was shot in red and white), extravagant costumes, baroque music
(without the help of regular composer Michael Nyman, alas), and a wildly
witty and literate script that is often times absurd, provocative, and
downright nasty.</P>
<P>        All the descriptions commonly associated with the director's work
apply here: sumptuous, decadent, outrageous, intellectually provocative,
hard-to-stomach.  Greenaway's artistic assessment that the making of his
films is more stimulating than the watching of them will be supported by
those looking for traditional elements of plot and character, but fans of
this unique talent will find much to appreciate in "The Baby of Mâcon,"
even though the film is definitely not one for the squeamish.</P>
<P>        In a world riddled by plague, pestilence, and female sterility, a
beautiful baby is miraculously born to a grotesque old woman.  The baby's
sister (Julia Ormond) claims the child as her own, proclaiming a virgin
birth.  Ralph Fiennes as The Bishop's Son is plainly skeptical that the
child is the new Messiah and takes it upon himself to disprove the
blasphemous contention.  As one might predict from both the subject matter
and the director of the piece, "events build to a shocking and brutal
climax."</P>
<P>        With "The Baby of Mâcon," Peter Greenaway once again proves that he
is unlike any other filmmaker and that makes this film--and his eclectic
body of work in general--well worth seeing.  Unfortunately, after just one
week, Greenaway's latest opus (the less-satisfying "8 1/2 Women") has
already been and gone.</P>
<PRE>        Oh well.  There's always "Mission: Impossible 2," I suppose.</PRE>
