<PRE>BOYS DON'T CRY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>The slightly effeminate Brandon likes doing all those manly things such
as hanging out at bars hitting "on" the gals and "at" the guys.  After
lots of carousing, he's off to try a dangerous sport that's like
water-skiing on land but pulled by a pickup truck.  Brandon's ambitions
are suitably macho, as he envisions himself off fighting big fires.
When he wakes the morning after a fight with a big shiner on his eye and
a cut on his cheek, he couldn't be prouder.</P>
<PRE>And he's a she.</PRE>
<P>Brandon, whose female name is Teena, is played believably by Hilary
Swank.  With her deeply-sunken cheeks, wide toothy smile and lanky look,
Swank appears decidedly male, although not at all like the other guys in
the movie.  The men in the story have long, dirty-looking, shaggy hair
and scraggly beards.  The short-haired Brandon is the only guy on the
screen with a traditional guy's haircut.</P>
<P>BOYS DON'T CRY has little to recommend it other than that it's based on
a true story.  The horrific ending means that Brandon Teena deserves our
sympathy, but it does not follow that the film dramatization based on
her life's story is worthwhile.  (There is also a documentary about her
life entitled THE BRANDON TEENA STORY.)</P>
<P>The first three quarters of the movie has Brandon falling for Lana
(Chloë Sevigny from KIDS), who lives with her large and largely
despicable family.  "I hate my life," Lana says in the story's biggest
understatement.  Lana's family -- the type that used to be called poor
white trash -- seem to spend all their waking hours with a cigarette in
one hand and a beer bottle in the other.</P>
<P>The long first part of the movie has nothing of interest, save watching
how Brandon copes with being a female in men's clothes.  Procuring and
hiding female sanitary products becomes a particularly tricky matter for
her.</P>
<P>The ending, which lasts an almost unbearable half hour, shamelessly
manipulates our emotions.  Director Kimberly Peirce has a toddler run
screaming through the worst of the mayhem, just to make sure we are
completely disgusted with the level of unspeakable violence before us.
If the first part had given Brandon some realistic characters to
interact with, the excessively long ending might have been tolerable
and, possibly, even meaningful.  As it is, the movie just leaves you
with a gut wrenching feeling.  Rather than being moved, you just feel
sick.</P>
<P>BOYS DON'T CRY runs 1:56.  It is rated R but should be NC-17 for gang
rape, strong violence, nudity, language and drug use.  It is not
appropriate for teenagers.</P>
