<P>Plot: In 1967 Vanessa Brooks is brought into a hospital, having been 
fatally bitten by a vampire, and at the same time goes into labour. She 
gives birth to a baby son before expiring. In the present day the child 
is now Blade, who, as a result of the bite, is half-vampire and 
half-human and can walk in the daylight but also has supernatural 
strength. Armed with titanium stakes and garlic and silver-filled 
shotgun shells, Blade conducts a single-handed campaign to slaughter all 
vampires in revenge for the murder of his mother. Blade finds a 
dangerous, new enemy in Deacon Frost, a radical vampire who poses a 
threat to the traditional vampires who own and control most of the city. 
Deacon wants to use the ancient vampire Bible to raise La Magra, the 
blood god, something that requires the spilling of Blade's half-human 
blood</P>
<P>Stephen Norrinton made a striking directorial debut with 1995's 'Death 
Machine', an effort that transcended its low-budget with a striking 
ferocity and energy and marked former effects man Norrington as one of 
the most promising of up and coming genre directors. 'Blade' is 
Norrington's second film and his debut in the American A-budget 
mainstream.</P>
<P>Although 'Blade' is not as intensive an all-out ride as 'Death Machine' 
was, Norrington succeeds in fulfilling his promise, injecting a 
considerable amount of stylistic elan into the film - notably a 
breathlessly intensive sequence with Snipes and vampires chasing one 
another through a subway tunnel alongside speeding trains and a climax 
with Snipes facing Dorff in sword combat with Snipes decapitating 
Dorff's torso and he simply regenerating it.</P>
<P>It is an adaption of the 1970s Marvel comic. The adaption comes from 
David S. Goyer who has been responsible for such darkly driven works as 
'Dark City' (1998) and 'The Crow: City of Angels' (1996). Goyer conducts 
some quite unique twists on vampire legend. If 'The Lost Boys', 'Near 
Dark' et al represent the transformation of the vampire into a kind of 
badass thug relishing the freedom of the modern world, then 'Blade' 
takes it to a logical extreme wherein the vampires are a kind of 
criminal underworld preying on humanity, secretly controlling the city 
and running vampire nightclubs which spray blood through the walls, 
treating would-be converts as a slave underclass even marking them as 
their own property. Indeed the film could almost read as an action film 
wherein Snipes might be a cop taking on a group of drug underlords with 
a considerable outlay of artillery fire. The plot though becomes 
considerably more cliche-driven in the latter quarter when Goyer has 
Dorff conducting cliched Lovecraftian rites to raise elder gods.</P>
<P>The film has been criticized as being a comic-book but the critics doing 
so seem to entirely elude the point that is exactly what it is meant to 
be. Here Norrington and Goyer do quite a decent job at capturing the 
dark nihilistic mood that drives modern screen comic-book adaptions. The 
film never quite resonates with the scintillatingly dark psychology of 
either of the first two 'Batman' films or 'The Crow', but then neither 
does it have the two-dimensional lack of depth of the 'Spawn' film or 
either of Joel Schumacher's 'Batman' abominations.</P>
<P>In an interesting move star Wesley Snipes also produces the film. One 
finds it hard though to understand Snipes' appeal as an actor. The man 
keeps coming across as rather thick every time he appears on screen. 
Whenever he does well in a part - in the likes of 'Jungle Fever' (1990) 
and 'Rising Sun' (1993) - it is because there is a good script on his 
side. Norrington seems to realize the limitations of Snipes' talents and 
works with it, giving him minimalistic dialogue and shooting everything 
he does as a stylized pose. He gives, for example, Snipes a fabulous 
entrance - slowly panning up from his boots to show him impressively 
decked out in shades, gleaming trenchcoat and black body armour. Indeed 
whenever Snipes removes his sunglasses and talks the character seems to 
lose much of its darkly driven mystique - the effectiveness of the 
character is a triumph of style over acting talent. On the other hand 
Stephen Dorff, although he does adequately, seems miscast as Deacon - 
the part requires someone into their thirties at least and Dorff comes 
across as far too youthful. Kristofferson is okay and N'Bushe Wright 
makes a promising debut.</P>
