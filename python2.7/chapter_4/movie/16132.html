<P>A film that is "Based on a true story" is problematic from the get-go: 
real life just isn't as interesting as the movies.  Most of the things
that happen in movies are not things that will ever happen in real
life.  Movies are great because they show us things we haven't seen
before, things we may not have ever considered.  A film that's "based on
a true story" is likely to disappoint simply because the components of
the story are probably too realistic to be cinematic.  </P>
<P>A Civil Action is based on a true story.  It's based on the true story
of Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta), a personal injury lawyer in a firm
with two partners (Tony Shalhoub and Zeljko Ivanek).  Jan is a cynical
man; much of the early scenes are filled with a witty narration in which
he explains the everyday procedures of winning cases and getting the
most possible money from a settlement.  (The first scene, in which a
group of lawyers beg for a two-million dollar settlement after Jan shows
the jury a child in a wheelchair is devilishly funny.)</P>
<P>Jan, however, decides to take a different kind of case:  over a few
years, several kids had died from leukemia in a small town called
Woburn; now, one of the mothers (Kathleen Quinlan) is trying to get a
lawyer to take their case against a local company who may be
accidentally draining toxins into the city's drinking water.  Jan
discovers that the local company is owned by a much larger company, and
so his motives for taking the case begin as a career move.  Later,
though, his morals change, and he sticks with the case, even though it
takes years to discover that the millions of dollars that his firm sinks
into the case are all wasted.</P>
<P>A Civil Action is one of the most frustrating films I've seen in
months:  here is a movie that begins as a funny, entertaining, cynical
look into the way lawyers operate, and concludes as a muddled, partially
sentimental morality tale with no climax and no real ending to speak
of.  It's made perfectly clear in the beginning that the film is based
on a true story, but I think that in the interest of cinema the last
thirty minutes should have been changed completely.  It almost makes me
mad to see a film with so much potential fizzle into a sloppy
resolution.</P>
<P>After all, I usually find John Travolta deeply unlikable, but A Civil
Action shows a side of him that I wouldn't mind seeing more often.  It
also has a fantastic supporting cast, a lot of sharp humor, and a
direct, insightful narration on the practices of one particular personal
injury lawyer.  Director Steven Zaillian also does a good job with
pacing and overall tone, except in the last thirty minutes, which are so
bad that the film as a whole can be considered no better than mediocre. 
It pains me to see this.</P>
<P>Take, for instance, the first scene, which I mentioned above.  This is
a very dry, very funny scene.  It speaks worlds of meaning with just a
little dialogue and a lot of good acting.  The movie has a similar tone
through much of its running time, and the way Zaillian unfolds the
details of the case is skillfully done:  I was always interested to see
what was going to happen, and who would be to blame for the disaster in
Woburn.  There are also some great supporting performances, the best
coming from William H. Macy (as Jan's high-strung accountant), Robert
Duvall (as a quirky defense lawyer), and Kathleen Quinlan (an actress
who needs her own movie).</P>
<P>I was so ready to love this movie, but it takes such an unexpected,
disastrous turn in the last thirty minutes.  It's nearly impossible to
explain in detail without giving away the ending, but I can say that it
requires us to dislike a bunch of people who seemed likable for most of
the movie.  It also has the most aggravating anticlimax of the decade,
whimpering to a close without awarding its audience the least bit of
satisfaction.  I attribute all of these failings to the fact that A
Civil Action has been based on a true story:  Hollywood endings aren't
always good, but at least they wrap stuff up.  This is a story that
didn't have an ending, and someone should have put it on, even if it
meant changing the facts a little.  As I said, cinema is more
interesting than real life; if you're going to make real life into
cinema, it needs to be made cinematic.</P>
