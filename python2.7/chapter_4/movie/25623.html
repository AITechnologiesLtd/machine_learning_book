Coyote Ugly</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A struggling singer-songwriter moving to New York in search of fame finds a
cute Aussie boyfriend and a bar to dance on.</P>
<P>Here's a comment from a theatergoer:
"It was all right. It had a lot of good-looking people. It could have made
it."</P>
<P>Here's a comment from me.
"I made it (through, that is)." Admittedly, this was not a film that I
eagerly awaited screening. Skinny ladies in tube tops two sizes too tiny
spraying an inebriatedly rambunctious bar crowd with various spirits just
didn't catch my eye on the trailers (go figure). But if it caught yours, be
forewarned these are relatively minor segments of the film (likewise, Tyra
Banks' part).</P>
<P>Nor is this a film about four women. Rather, one modest, stage-frightened,
but determined girl from Jersey dominates the production. Can she make it on
her own in the big bad city? Can she keep her young Mel Gibson? Can she
impress her KFC eating father (John Goodman)?</P>
<P>Aside from pretentiously false modesty, Piper Perabo does a smashing job
with this near-cardboard character. Adam Garcia also is endearing, with the
Coyote Queen, Maria Bello, pulling down her hard, but caring role with both
fists. Tyra is fine. (Read in any inflection you prefer).</P>
<P>But the film caricatures the reality of song or beer selling, the
father/daughter relationship and even performance, be it music or buttocks.
Some of the wet bar dancing is fun (never too sexy), but the film really
only captivates when Violet (Perabo) plays her music. Unfortunately, that
only happens twice during which the filmmakers insert a time-passes-by
sequence over the music that moves the picture along with the kind of beat
and heart we've been waiting for. More songs from our leading lady would
have prettied up this coyote. A grittier realism would have also elevated
the tension level - as is, we never really worry about anyone.</P>
<P>FYI, as explained by the bar owner herself, "Coyote Ugly" is the term one
might use for the less than appealing appearance of your one-night-stand
laying in bed with you the morning after. "You'd rather chew off your arm
than risk waking him."</P>
<P>Still, I enjoyed Piper Perabo and would like to see more of her (now, stop,
you know what I mean!) in films to come. Additionally, I did pull out my
dusty six string and bang around on it a while when I got back from the film
... that's worth more than a "C."</P>
