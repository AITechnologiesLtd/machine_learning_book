<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>In this smart and stylish action thriller, the life and meaning of
Carlos "The Jackal" Sanchez is given new depth.  Of the many gratifying
qualities that The Assignment has to offer, none are more dazzling than
the film's editing and direction.  Christian Duguay (Screamers) shapes
its screenplay with appropriate complexity, giving his material more
than just charm and intrigue.  Clash of cultures, moving emotional
elements and investigations of political espionage wrap themselves
around B grade action, making an A grade experience.</P>
<P>For twenty years, CIA operative Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who has
been in a somewhat disturbing amount of films - eighty or so in the last
thirty years) has chased Sanchez, a master terrorist who enjoys
killing/maiming innocent civilians.  After countless failed attempts to
capture the ingenious killer, Shaw and his Israeli counterpart Amos (Ben
Kingsley) stumble across an effective weapon against him - a man who has
nothing in common with Sanchez except a splitting image.  He is Annibal
Ramirez (Adrian Quinn), an honorable American naval officer who is
ultimately used as bait.</P>
<P>There are two main parts of The Assignment.  Part A chronicles an
extensive two month training which Ramirez endures, in order to make
sure that he thinks and reacts like the man he is impersonating.  Shaw
and Amos devise a set of physically and mentally challenging tests,
including drugging Ramirez with LSD and watching his nightmarish trip.
Part B centers on the dangerous environment that Ramirez encounters as
he attempts to imitate one of the world's most hunted criminals.</P>
<P>Much to his credit, Adrian Quinn plays both the Jackal and the story's
hero with realism and morality.  As Ramirez undergoes his training,
Quinn transforms his character subtly and brilliantly.  The distressing
scenarios he encounters reminded me of Michael Douglas' performance in
The Game; both actors make their characters paranoia hit viewers hard.
In most of his movies, Donald Sutherland is often seen but not noticed.
His part in The Assignment is imperative to the story, which is
surprising because Sutherland is rarely powerful - but is thoroughly
engaging and interesting in this role.  Kingsley, as always, is solid.</P>
<P>Fashioned with striking set pieces and gorgeous cinematography, The
Assignment is a joy to watch.  With a film as smart as this one, we are
reassured that good-looking movies are not necessarily dumb ones (for
further evidence consult Enemy of the State or Kundun). Solid
performances and crisp editing compliment The Assignment's firm
direction and beautifully laced screenplay. There are not many films
that work on as many levels as this one does, and even fewer that can
implement charm alongside terror.  Ordinarily this might appear to be a
contradiction of terms, but The Assignment has enough substance and
energy to pull it off with flair.</P>
