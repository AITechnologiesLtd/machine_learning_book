<PRE>                                 BATMAN RETURNS
                             A film review by Kreme
                         Copyright 1992 by Lewis Butler</PRE>
<PRE>Summary:  Batman is back, and some of the style seems to have been
          washed out.  Overall a fun movie with a comic-book plot
          and a wonderfully endearing performance from Michelle
          Pfeiffer and a good, but silly, performance from Danny
          DeVito.  A +1 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The Bat is back, and this time we get to see his nemesis, The
Penguin and the provocative Catwoman.  This movie will disappoint many
people who are hoping to see more of the same movie magic that made
BATMAN so enjoyable.  While the plot has regressed remarkably to a
cartoonish-comic-bookish level, the sexual innuendo/humor has escalated
to a purely adult level.  The movie sends mixed signals throughout and
never fails to miss even the most obvious sexual joke.  Too bad, if the
movie had stayed mostly adult as BATMAN did it would have been much
better; even if it had been purely comic-book it would have been
marginally better.  As it is it tries to straddle the fence between
pleasing the 13 year-olds and pleasing the parents with them.  I think
it misses both.</P>
<P>     Understand me, this is not a *poor* movie.  Not at all, but it is
not BATMAN, and it is not even a particularly worthy successor.  While
BATMAN had a undeniable forcefulness to it and a tightness to the plot
and dialog, this film slowly meanders through an ambling plotline to a
predictable end.  Much of the dialog is spend on jokes, but without the
same humor or strength of BATMAN.  BATMAN RETURNS is trying to show-off.</P>
<P>     Once again the focus of the movie is not Batman himself, but rather
one of the villains.  In this movie it is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman
who steals center stage.  Her performance is wonderfully alive, down to
the soft throaty growl in her voice and the unassuming "Meow."  She is
everything a cat-woman should be, even slightly naughty (though she
tends to sharpen her claws on people instead of furniture).  Selina Kyle
is a perfect foil to Bruce Wayne, and as readers of the Batman comics
have know for years, Catwoman is in many ways Batman's perfect
"villain."</P>
<P>     Danny DeVito is quite good as the Penguin, but I felt that the
screenplay called for a character that was far too much a "freak" and
far too comical.  There is none of the sheer evil of Nicholson's Joker,
just a comical silliness that DeVito never quite manages to shed, even
when he is trying to be the bad guy.  The ridiculous costume hinders him
and reduces the character to a rather uninteresting goon.</P>
<P>     The plot is choppier than BATMAN.  Much of the movie is a bit
confused.  We don't really *know* who the "Red Triangle Gang" is:
children that were stolen or performers from the circus?  There is a
general feeling of slight discontinuity throughout the film.  In short
the editing was not nearly as good as BATMAN.</P>
<P>     But the movie is enjoyable anyway.  The sets are great, though we
never have time to really examine them, and there is no wonderful
architectural focal point like the church in BATMAN.  Instead there is a
Christmas Tree.  Oh well.</P>
<P>     Elfman's score is wonderful and manages to lift the movie during
some of its weaker moments.  The supporting cast is mostly very good,
though I though the actor playing Max's (Christopher Walken) son could
have done better with the three or four lines he had.</P>
<P>     If you are a bat-freak you will see this movie no matter what, and
there are enough bat-freaks out there that this movie will certainly be
successful, though it will play in comparison to the first.  If they
learn from their mistakes in this film and remember the first, the third
should be something wonderful.  (Anyone doubt there will be a third?)</P>
<P>     For the less bat-fixated among you, the movie is worth seeing for
anyone who really liked the first movie and would like to see a great
performance from Michelle Pfeiffer.</P>
<P>     If you disliked the first movie you will probably like this one
even less.</P>
<P>     Oh yes, and one more thing, there is quite a bit more gratuitous
violence and mayhem in BATMAN RETURNS than in BATMAN.</P>
