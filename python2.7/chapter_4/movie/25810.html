<PRE>SPACE COWBOYS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * * 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Clint Eastwood
Written by: Ken Kaufman, Howard Klausner</PRE>
<P>The guidance system on a Russian communications satellite, which has been in 
space for about 14 years, is finally breaking down and sending the satellite 
towards Earth. In about a month and a half it will burn up in the atmosphere 
and the communications break-down may plunge Russia into a civil war. No 
problem, right? We can just send some boys up there to fix it and it'll be 
as good as new. Wrong, you see the guidance system is so old that the only 
person who knows anything about it is the original designer, Frank Corvin 
(Clint Eastwood). Frank was originally supposed to go into space back in the 
fifties, but he and his team were replaced by a monkey. The man responsible 
for destroying Frank's dream of going into space was Bob Gerson (James 
Cromwell), who is still in charge of the space program, and is now in charge 
of trying to find a way to fix the Russian satellite. So Frank makes a deal 
with Gersen, whereby Frank will fix the satellite if, and only if, he and 
his original team members, Hawk, Tank, and Jerry (Tommy Lee Jones, James 
Garner, and Donald Sutherland respectively), are allowed to go into space 
together to do so. They will be accompanied by two young astronauts, Ethan 
(Loren Dean) and Roger (Courtney B. Vance), but all the repairs will be 
performed entirely by Frank and his team. The catch is, in order to qualify 
for this, Frank and his team must undergo all the rigorous training 
astronauts now go through.</P>
<P>Let me catch my breath after that plot summary. I know it sounded long and 
confusing, but the movie's plot is actually remarkably simple; it just can't 
be written down in simple terms (or maybe it's just me, but I must have 
re-written that summary a dozen times). In a summer full of utter 
disappointments, "Space Cowboys" stands out as the one movie that was 
exactly how I expected it to be. In other words, "Space Cowboys" was as 
cliched as it could be, but it was also a lot of fun, very entertaining, and 
it even had a few touching moments. The movie is bound to draw (possibly 
unfair) comparisons to "Armageddon", just as Michael Bay's film drew 
comparisons to "The Right Stuff". Both films feature a group being quickly 
trained for a space mission, having quite a few problems up in space, and 
unfortunately both lose most of their steam once the group actually makes it 
into space. That's right, just like Bay's big loud picture, "Space Cowboys" 
is an absolute blast while it's on the ground, but all the fun gets sapped 
out once the actual mission is underway.</P>
<P>In a movie with a cast like this, the high point is obviously going to be 
the acting. Where else can you see five great old actors get together for 
one last hurrah? As a result, I'm going to devote a lot more of the review 
to each of the actors involved than I normally would. Eastwood does a 
magnificent job playing an aged Dirty Harry like character, getting 
excellent lines like: "Go ahead, I've got medicare, take your best shot." 
For those of you worried about Eastwood taking his shirt off after that 
reportedly horrifying sight in "The Bridges of Madison County", I'm sorry to 
say he does just that. However, it's only for a split second, and he's bent 
over so you really don't see his chest too well. Why am I telling you this? 
Because I'd hate for you to miss an otherwise good movie because you're 
(justifiably) afraid of that sight. The only other actor to play a really 
major part in "Space Cowboys" is Tommy Lee Jones, playing Eastwood's on 
again - off again best friend, Hawk. Jones is clearly one of the best older 
actors working in Hollywood (though he's actually the youngest of the five 
featured in this movie), and he's great here because he's obviously having 
such a good time. Jones has a big goofy smile plastered on his face 
throughout the film, and as a result, we can't help but smile along with 
him.</P>
<P>The other three old-timers aren't given half the screen time Jones and 
Eastwood are, but at least two of them still manage to leave an impression. 
What type of impression does Donald Sutherland ("Outbreak") leave? Why, the 
same kind he always does of course: Eww, creepy (if you've seen Sutherland 
in anything before you should know exactly what I mean). The fact that his 
character is a womanizing old man doesn't help matters any. James Cromwell 
("LA Confidential") is gaining quite a reputation for playing sadistic old 
men, and he continues in that same vein as the hateful Bob Gersen. Does he 
play a hateful old man well? Disturbingly well, actually. The only one of 
the five who leaves no impression is the great James Garner ("Maverick"). 
How can that possibly be, you ask? Well, don't get me wrong, James Garner is 
certainly the man, but even he can't save a role where he's given no more 
than fifteen or twenty minutes of screen time. The only other people given 
enough screen time to leave any sort of mark are Marcia Gay Harden (that's 
right, from the masterpiece "Miller's Crossing") as Tommy Lee Jones's love 
interest, and William Devane (just seen briefly in "Hollow Man") as James 
Cromwell's boss who seems afflicted by a split personality.</P>
<P>Eastwood's skill behind the camera is a little hard to predict. It can be 
outstanding and frankly mesmerizing as it was in "Unforgiven"; or it can be, 
well, "True Crime". His efforts in "Space Cowboys" fall somewhere safely in 
the middle. Most of his scenes work quite well, like a bar- room brawl 
between Eastwood and a young skin head; or the scene where we first meet 
Hawk, who now makes his living teaching young hotshots a thing or two about 
flying in an old, bright red one prop plane. However, a few of the tricks he 
tried just didn't do it for me, like the actors' voices being dubbed over on 
younger actors in the first fifteen minutes. Eastwood's biggest strength in 
"Space Cowboys" is his ability to throw in slap-stick like humor without 
making the film feel campy. His biggest weakness is pacing, which is slow 
and leisurely while the crew is on the ground, but frantic and headache 
inducing while they're in space. I think things would have gone over a bit 
more smoothly if a half hour had been taken out of the script and Eastwood 
had directed the whole film in his trademark, meandering sort of way.</P>
<P>Other than the acting and a lot of really entertaining scenes, there isn't 
much to "Space Cowboys". The special effects are nice, but certainly nothing 
spectacular. The training scenes may run on far too long, but they're sure a 
whole lot of fun. The score from Clint Eastwood's favorite composer, Lennie 
Niehaus, is nice, but after Trevor Rabin's outstanding, rousing score from 
"Armageddon" (I said it was going to draw unfair comparisons), this one just 
doesn't stand up. Despite these factors, "Space Cowboys" is still enjoyable 
enough that it was well on its way to a full four star rating until the last 
half hour hit. In that last half hour every heart string tugging cliche in 
the book was hurled at me till I felt like knocking it down more than just 
one notch. "Space Cowboys" did force me to reconsider a statement I made 
earlier this month. I said that all movies in Hollywood should be restricted 
in length to one hour, because writers seemed to run out of ideas at that 
point. I'm changing that statement to all movies should be written and ready 
to go, and then have the last half hour done away with. Granted, there are 
exceptions, this year's "X-Men" springs to mind, but for the most part I 
think this would benefit Hollywood greatly. "Space Cowboys" runs a long 129 
minutes, and I recommend it to just about any age group, though senior 
citizens will probably get more out of it than kids. I give the move three 
and a half out of five stars.</P>
