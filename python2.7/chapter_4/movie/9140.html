<PRE>Review: The Edge (1997)
A movie review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: 
Lee Tamahori</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: 
David Mamet</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Bart the Bear, Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Elle Macpherson. Harold
Perrineau, L.Q. Jones, Kathleen Wilhoite, and David Lindstedt</P>
<P>Interesting note: David Mamet, the writer of this movie, is a renowned
American playwright who was born in Chicago in 1947. Mamet is best known
for slick macho city guy characters and their egos and posturing. He won
a Pulitzer Prize for Glengarry Glen Ross. His films include ‘The
Verdict,' ‘The Untouchables,' ‘The Postman Always Rings Twice,' and
‘Hoffa.'</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
A bookworm, a sleazeball who covets the bookworm's wife, a plane crash,
lots of Alaskan wilderness, a man-eating bear</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) is a wealthy but socially awkward
bookworm who suspects his beautiful supermodel wife (Elle Macpherson)
might be having an affair with virile morally bankrupt photographer
Robert Green (Alec Baldwin). From this point on, foreshadowing is the
name of the game. While on a plane, Charles happens to be reading a book
called "How to Survive in the Wilderness." And in the first few minutes
of the movie, the dialogue between various characters covers the fact
that birds can cause a plane to crash, and that bears in Alaska
sometimes stalk human victims.  So from the very start, we can guess
what will happen to a tiny bush plane carrying both Charles and Robert
over Alaska for a photo shoot. The trouble is, Charles' wife and Robert
are far from virtuous. Will Robert take the opportunity to kill off
Charles? Will a bear kill them both? Will they kill the bear? All we in
the audience have to do now is sit back, live theater style, and watch
the actors and the bear hash out their differences.</P>
<P>Opinion:
It seems like every word spoken or every action taken in the beginning
of the 'The Edge' - - no matter how insignificant - -  is foreshadowing
for something that occurs before the movie ends. Not a word is wasted.
Even when Charles receives an engraved timepiece it's really just
foreshadowing for the presenting of an engraved timepiece later on in
the story. This "Murphy's Law" quality, as every single word or action
comes back to haunt, makes the movie seem more tongue-in-cheek. Envision
two men on a park bench acting out a dramatic situation concerning a
wife, and then place the men on a log in the middle of the Alaskan
forest instead. Throw in a few homicidal bear attacks and see how they
get out of each dilemma. </P>
