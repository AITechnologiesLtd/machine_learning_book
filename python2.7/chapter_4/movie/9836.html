<PRE>CROOKED HEARTS (1991)
A Film Review by Vince Deehan
Copyright Vince Deehan 1997</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by Michael Bortman.  Based on the novel by Robert Boswell.
Cast:   Peter Berg,  Vincent D'Onofrio, Noah Wyle, Peter Coyote, Cindy 
Pickett, Juliette Lewis, Jennifer Jason Leigh.</P>
<P>As of writing,  Sunday November 16 1997, we are currently in the midst of the 
London Film Festival.   I have been to see four festival films so far and I 
have to say that not one of them was up to my expectations.   I won't say 
what the film were, as that's not my style, but it was with great delight 
that I stumbled upon a late night TV showing of this unknown (to me) film 
that was so good that I couldn't believe that I hadn't heard of it before.   
The film was CROOKED HEARTS and it stands head and shoulders over all the 
films I have so far seen at the 1997 LFF.</P>
<P>CROOKED HEARTS tells the story of a comfortably-off American family, called 
the Warren family.  They live in a typical large house that so typifies 
the usual kind of house we see in US movies - most of us live in much smaller 
houses in the UK !   At the start of the film we see the middle son Tom (Peter 
Berg - COP LAND,  THE LAST SEDUCTION) coming home after dropping out of 
college.   He comes back to the family home, where we find father Edward 
(Peter Coyote), mother Jill (Cindy Pickett) , older brother Charley (Vincent
D'Onofrio - FULL METAL JACKET,  MEN IN BLACK), younger brother Ask  
(Noah Wyle- TV's  "ER",  THE MYTH OF FINGERPRINTS) and kid sister Cassie 
(Juliette Lewis - NATURAL BORN KILLERS).</P>
<PRE>-  It's a mightily impressive cast isn't it ?   My jaw was dropping as their 
names flashed up on the TV screen  !  -</PRE>
<P>Tom's older brother, the 26 year old Charley, is still living at home and 
is constantly locking horns with their father.   Charley is an intelligent 
young man but can't seem to hold down a job and is currently working in a 
warehouse.   His father is clearly exasperated by him and knows that he can 
achieve so much more with his life if he would just apply himself and mature 
a little.  Charley also knows this but seems unable to break out of a perpetual 
adolescence - his behaviour throughout much of the movie would seem more 
appropriate for a 17 year old than a man in his mid twenties.  This fact is 
mentioned in the film by his father when after witnessing Charley trying 
to leave home by driving off in the family's van , he says that his son is 
pulling off a high school stunt.   Charley is a complex character who is 
hard to empathise with but whose behaviour is nonetheless engrossing.  
He talks of the need to be thrown out of the family rather than him just 
leaving, and to this end he does some unpleasant things during the film 
which seriously hurt the whole family, in many ways...</P>
<P>We also see Tom's relationship with his new girlfriend, Marriet, played 
by Jennifer Jason Leigh.  This being  Jennifer Jason Leigh, she plays a 
highly kooky character who is clearly a bit unstable and quite strange !  
When we see Tom and Marriet meeting for the first time, I wanted to shout at 
the screen "No, don't go near her. She's a nutcase".  No offence meant to 
Jason Leigh, but so often she plays these odd young ladies with annoying 
behaviour and strange tics.  As the film goes on her kookiness gets toned 
down a bit, which is just as well as it makes it less hard to see what Tom 
sees in her</P>
<P>Part of Charley's plan in getting thrown out of the family is getting Tom's 
ex-girlfriend pregnant.   This leads to a confrontation between the two 
brothers but fails to get Charley thrown out as planned.  Charley figures 
that something more drastic is called for and something more drastic is 
exactly what he does.   </P>
<P>Ask Warren is Tom's younger brother, he is clearly a young man with a saintly
heart and is one of the most good natured characters I have  ever seen in a 
film.   He is played expertly by Noah Wyle, who in the years before his ER 
fame, shows what a talented actor he is.   Ask has written up a set of rules 
by which he lives his life, which he started writing when he was eight and has 
been revising ever since.   Some of the rules are funny, like "Never use 
water to put out an electrical fire" and "Always keep clean, even in places
that don't show" others are more serious like "Never make a complicated thing
simple, or make a simple thing complicated".   I am aware that as I write 
these, they may sound a bit trite, but after seeing  Noah Wyle's  performance 
as  Ask  Warren  in the film  you won't feel that way.</P>
<P>Juliette Lewis plays the youngest member of the family, Cassie Warren.  She 
tends to fall asleep during key moments of the film, usually when there 
is bit of tension in the air, which led to one reviewer saying that her 
character was a sufferer of narcolepsy - where people apparently become 
sleepy in times of stress.  Kurt Cobain famously fooled a journalist into 
believing he was narcoleptic - a fact which got repeated as a fact thereafter.
If Cassie really is a sufferer in the film, it never gets spelled out and 
thankfully it's use is very subtle.  It becomes a very endearing character 
trait which causes much amusement  in one key scene in the film.   </P>
<P>Vincent D'Onofrio gives a typically compelling performance as the troubled 
Charley.  I can't say I fully understood him, but then no one in the family 
could quite figure him out.  In the last part of the film Charley spells out 
what seems to be holding him back, when he says that he feels that no matter 
what he chose to do his father would never be pleased.   He therefore seems to
be saying that rather than try and get on with his life and fulfil his 
potential he would rather confound his father's expectations than try to meet 
them.   Charley talks of the family as being a drug that they have all become 
addicted to.   He wants to leave but knows that he can't quite make that 
decision for himself and needs to be thrown out.  It's a peculiarly infantile 
way of thinking, but one that Charley is fixed on.  All his father really 
wants, is him to do something with his life, but Charley constantly feels 
compelled to run way and abandon the family.  He can't seem to see that he 
can still be part of the family even if he does move way.  Charley probably 
thinks that the family want him to go, but the fact is they only want him to 
make a life for himself whilst still staying part of the family.   Like I say, 
Charley is a complicated character, but a fascinating one.</P>
<P>The score to CROOKED HEARTS is by Mark Isham and is just wonderful. It perfectly
complements and helps create the mood throughout the film.</P>
<P>CROOKED HEARTS is a powerful and moving film which I can't praise too highly.
I heartily recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a superbly written 
and expertly acted ensemble piece.    It's a joy to find a real gem like this 
and to be able tell other people about it.   I hope other people check out 
this wonderful film.</P>
