<PRE>                               FIELD OF DREAMS
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        FIELD OF DREAMS almost defies description.  Although it's about
baseball, it's not a baseball movie.  Although the film is extremely
spiritual, it's not about religion.  And although FIELD OF DREAMS is
melodramatic, it's not a tearjerker.  To really understand what FIELD OF
DREAMS is all about, you have to see it.</P>
<P>        In the film, Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella, a baseball fan, '60s
Berkeley graduate, and Iowa farmer.  One day as he is standing in the
middle of his expansive corn fields, Ray hears a voice; it tells him: "If
you build it, he will come."  Then Ray has a vision and somehow concludes
that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn, Shoeless Joe
Jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again.  And even though
it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy, Ray
clears away the corn and builds a baseball field, complete with bleachers
and flood lights.  "If you build it, he will come."  And lo and behold,
Shoeless Joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates.</P>
<P>        And then Ray hears The Voice again; it tells him to "ease his
pain."  Ray thinks this means that he must travel to Boston to meet Terence
Mann, an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since
stopped writing and dropped out of society.  With great aplomb, James Earl
Jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with Ray and embarks
with him on a magical and spiritual journey.</P>
<P>        The cast in FIELD OF DREAMS is excellent, especially Kevin Costner
in the lead role.  Costner gives a quiet, subtle, and moving performance as
a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or
spontaneous in his entire life.  Costner gives Ray just the right mix of
enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and
swallow this wondrous fairy tale.</P>
<P>        Amy Madigan gives a fine supporting performance as Ray's feisty and
loving wife, who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy
ideas.  In her most impressive scene, Madigan vehemently argues against
book burning at a P.T.A. meeting, displaying the sincere passion of a '60s
Berkeley radical.  Ray Liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as
the ghost of Shoeless Joe, the legendary batter who was suspended from
baseball for his involvement in the 1919 Chicago "Black Sox" Scandal.  And
finally, Burt Lancaster is memorable in a small, but important, role as a
small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only
one inning.</P>
<P>        FIELD OF DREAMS is a touching fairy tale full of life, wonder,
mystery, spirit, and humor.  It, for the most part, succeeds in capturing
our emotions and suspending our disbelief.  Ray Kinsella's spiritual quest
in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous.  But while
FIELD OF DREAMS generally avoids excessive melodrama, it unfortunately does
at times go overboard, and by the end it gets down-right sappy.  In
general, however, FIELD OF DREAMS is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one
I can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics.</P>
