<P>Last Saturday night (6/12/99) I went to see "Odds Against Tomorrow"
with my friend Paul Buhle. The audience included the screenwriter Abe
Polonsky, who was one of the Hollywood 10, John Lewis, the Modern Jazz
Quartet's pianist who wrote the score, and Harry Belafonte, who
produced the film and was one of the co-stars. They were to speak on a
panel immediately following the film.</P>
<P>Paul's book "Tender Comrades", a series of interviews with
blacklistees conducted by various scholars, is now available in
paperback from St. Martins Press and is a must for anybody interested
in left cultural history. Paul did the Polonsky interview and prefaces
it as follows:</P>
<P>"ABRAHAM LINCOLN POLONSKY, the son of a Jewish pharmacist, grew up in
New York and graduated from City College and the Columbia Law School.
He taught at City College and started writing for radio, scripting
episodes of The Goldbergs, during the mid-1930s. By the end of the
decade he was also writing for Columbia Workshop Theatre and Orson
Welles's Mercury Theatre of the Air. As he continued working on plays
and fiction, he visited Hollywood for the first time in 1937. But
instead of immediately attempting a career there alongside so many
other left-wing writers, he made a political choice. For two crucial
years when the American labor movement was at the apex of both its
influence and its collective idealism, he operated as educational
director and newspaper editor of a regional ClO union north of New
York City.</P>
<P>"Right before world War II, Polonsky had a novel serialized in
Collier's that attracted renewed attention from Hollywood. But
military duty took precedence. After serving with the Office of
Strategic Services, at times behind the lines in France, Polonsky
resumed to Hollywood at last, in 1945. After a disappointing start at
Paramount, he became the leading scenarist for Enterprise, the best of
the new, small production companies. With the hit boxing film Body and
Soul under his belt, Polonsky then wrote and directed Force of Evil,
considered by critics to be one of the best films noirs of the era, an
intensely poetic, radically stylized work that nonetheless managed to
observe the conventions of the crime genre. A script for I Can Get It
for You Wholesale, produced while Polonsky was out of the country,
rounded out his Hollywood life before the blacklist drove him out of
the industry."</P>
<P>Directed by Robert Wise, "Odds Against Tomorrow" is a film of notable
"firsts" and "lasts". Made in 1959, it was the last true 'film noir'
and follows the form's conventions as strictly as Kabuki or Noh
theater follow theirs. Filmed in black-and-white, it is the story of 3
men who set about to rob a bank since fate will permit no other
solution to their collective economic woes. Most scenes are shot at
night and include the mandatory rain-slicked streets, blinking neon
lights observed from second-rate hotel windows, and smoky bars and
nightclubs.</P>
<P>By the same token, it was the first film noir to feature a genuinely
noir actor. The African-American actor and singer Harry Belafonte had
formed his own production company out of frustration with the sort of
roles he had been offered by white Hollywood. Playing Jimmy Ingram, a
jazz musician with gambling debts he has no hope of paying off, he
decides to participate in a bank robbery in upstate NY. He has been
recruited by Dave Burke (Ed Begley), an ex-cop who was drummed off the
force after 30 years because he "wouldn't talk" to the State Crime
Committee. One can surmise that this was a form of rebuttal to Elia
Kazan's "On the Waterfront," which glorified informants. Another first
was John Lewis's score, the first jazz composition written for a film.</P>
<P>Burke has also lined up Earle Slater (Robert Ryan), a WWII veteran who
has been released from prison recently after serving time on a
manslaughter conviction. Slater has simply not been able to integrate
into American society since the war and has failed at one job or
another. Unlike the rosy vision put forward in publicity surrounding
"Saving Private Ryan" and Tom Brokaw's "The Greatest Generation," noir
films often depicted WWII veterans in bleak circumstances. In real
life, Robert Ryan was a principled liberal who had spoken out for
economic and racial justice during the 30s and 40s. Unlike many
others, he had not backed down from McCarthy and defended the civil
liberties of those in the industry--like Polonsky--who were under
attack.</P>
<P>Slater is a diehard racist from Oklahoma, who in the opening scene of
the film set on the sidewalk outside Burke's hotel, tells a young
black girl who he has bumped into, "You lil pickaninny, you goin' to
kill yourself flyin' like that, yes you are." Thusly, his conflict
with Belafonte's character, who will not tolerate racism, creates the
secondary tension that is sustained through the rest of the film. You
watch the film wondering who will kill each other first. The cops and
the robbers, or the robbers themselves.</P>
<P>Ingram has almost no use for white people. Although not political in
any way, he rejects white society's values. In a scene with his
ex-wife who is active on a PTA committee with white members, he
challenges her belief in integration after she has reprimanded him as
an inadequate father to their daughter. While Slater can't integrate
into American society because of character flaws, Ingram won't because
of flaws he perceives in society itself.</P>
<P>RUTH (flaring): "I am trying to make a world fit for Eadie to live in.
It's a cinch you're not going to do it with a deck of cards and a
racing form."</P>
<P>INGRAM: "But you are, huh? You and your big white brothers. Drink
enough tea with 'em and stay out of the watermelon patch and maybe our
little colored girl will grow up to be Miss America, is that it?"</P>
<P>The gang of three proceeds to the town of Melton, about a hundred
miles north of NYC on the Hudson River, where they will rob a bank in
a plan that Burke assures them can not go wrong. Of course, by film
noir conventions, we are prepared to expect the worst. Hudson, NY
provided the locale for the final scenes of the movie. As a tableaux
of honest, hard-working villagers lifted from a Norman Rockwell
painting, it provided a dramatic contrast to the violent, cunning, and
cynical NYC home of the gangsters. </P>
<P>The panel discussion was chaired by John Schultheiss, the editor of
"Odds Against Tomorrow: The Critical Edition" (Cal State, 1999), who
provided valuable historical context for the making of the film.</P>
<P>In a montage of "race understanding" films from the mid 1950s,
Schultheiss explains how unique "Odds Against Tomorrow" was. In prior
films such as "The Defiant Ones," there is a plea for racial tolerance
but the black character is always sacrificed in the process. Chained
to white racist escaped convict Tony Curtis, fellow escapee Sidney
Poitier constantly goes out of his way to show the audience that he
will turn the other cheek, while Curtis keeps slapping it. Belafonte
explained that he wanted to depict a black character who would not
stand for any humiliation. It was also a way to tell Hollywood that he
would not kowtow to their idea of how a black character should behave.</P>
<P>Belafonte had put his own fortune and reputation on the line. Waiving
his fee as an actor, and fronting a quarter-million dollars, he sought
to break new ground cinematically. In Schultheiss's commentary on the
film, Belafonte is quoted, "My own personal desire was to put things
on the screen that reflected the deeper resonance of black life,
things that had never been approached before, even within the United
Artists realm." His partnership with United Artists was a reflection
of the special role of the company in Hollywood, which was to be
obliterated by corporate ownership a decade or so later. Formed by
Charlie Chaplin in the 1920s, United Artists was cooperatively owned
by actors, screenwriters and directors who wanted to make
uncompromising films.</P>
<P>Belafonte made two decisions that reflected his own uncompromising
beliefs. He hired Abraham Polonsky to write the film, who was still
blacklisted. Belafonte's connections to this world was rooted in his
own experience as a blacklistee. What enabled him to break free of
McCarthyite repression was his unique folksinging talent, which
attracted the support of Ed Sullivan who featured Belafonte regularly
on his popular Sunday night television variety show. Buhle told me
that despite this, Sullivan was a run-of-the-mill red-baiter, who had
viciously attacked Polonsky in a newspaper column in the same year
"Odds Against Tomorrow" was being filmed.</P>
<P>Once Belafonte became a powerful show business figure in his own
right, he told his blacklisted friends and acquaintances that he would
do everything he could to piggyback them out of the witch-hunt. Just
jump on his shoulders. Receiving $35,000 for his screenplay, Polonsky
was one of the first. Even the selection of a "front" for Polonsky was
carefully thought through for its political impact. John Oliver
Killens was an important black writer, who was active in the civil
rights movement along with Martin Luther King Jr., Belafonte and
others. (Killens eventually became a black nationalist and a supporter
of Malcom X.)</P>
<P>Schultheiss posed a provocative question to Polonsky. How did his
belief in progressive politics square with his decision to write a
film with criminals as central characters, who had no socially
redeeming qualities? Was it difficult to make what was essentially an
entertainment about hardboiled criminals, when his stated beliefs
revolved around transforming American society? Polonsky, never one to
mince words, practically spit out his reply. He said that American
society itself was criminal and that the film's characters were just
trapped within the system.</P>
<P>This raised for me an interesting line of investigation. It would
appear that film noir would represent for left-wing screenwriters the
same sort of appeal as Nathaniel West's novels. West, a Communist
sympathizer, wrote what were effectively noir novels. In "Miss
Lonelyhearts", a bitter, bleak story about the impossibility of
breaking though economic and personal limitations, West offered no
pat, socialist solutions to the misery of his characters. One would
assume that film noir allowed the film writer the same artistic
latitude.</P>
<P>Belafonte offered his own thoughts on the question of progressive
politics and entertainment, which I found particularly profound. He
said that one of the worst things about conglomerate transformation of
popular culture was the way it cheapened the notion of entertainment.
For Belafonte, entertainment is akin to engagement. A film like "Odds
Against Tomorrow" might disturb you, but it would also captivate you
and make you think. Today's notion of entertainment seems designed to
dull the thought and make one less than fully human. Back when
Belafonte made the film and until the present moment, he had no such
intentions. As he told Schultheiss in a 1998 interview:</P>
<P>"But Hollywood was no more than a reflection of the nation. It was
saying no more and doing no more than America was saying and doing. If
Hollywood was to change, then America had to change. We had to then
change the way America was doing business: to let Hollywood understand
that it had to do business on different terms. The upheaval took place
and the struggle took place, and in that climate Abe and I then saw
the opportunity to put a point of view on the screen that was very
different from any of the others around. This would be Odds Against
Tomorrow." </P>
