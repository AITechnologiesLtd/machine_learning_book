<PRE>The boy cleans of nicely...
Drive Me Crazy</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A "B+" for surprisingly solid acting and dialogue. But since the plot line
is a road we've traveled countless times before, there's no unpredictable
twists to jerk the film out of the clutches of mediocrity.</P>
<P>Teen next door neighbors, Nicole and Chase, feign a loving high school
couple in order to attract the real objects of their hearts affection -- you
know, through jealousy. But the scam may backfire -- could they accidentally
fall for each other? Ya think? Of course the whole thing climaxes (though
that's a strong word) at the Centennial dance (a teen flick prom
substitute).</P>
<P>The most interesting parts of the story get lost: Chase is a sub-culture,
anti-conformist who delights (along with two buds) in making fun of the
preppy crowd. Nicole is deep into the "in" crowd. Their coupling puts Chase
into Dockers and tames his wild head of hair. Says his ex, "Did you fall in
love or just fall into the Gap?" How he reacts to his new "prep" pals is
very interesting. However, only once he brings Nicole into his culture --
her reactions there are rich as well. Unfortunately, all of this gets run
over by the steamroller of a predictable plot. It is only the solid
performances, direction, dialogue and editing that keep the film from
flat-lining.</P>
<P>But I'm an old fart, perhaps the unknowing teen will be waiting on the edge
of her seat to see if Chase and Nicole "really really" work out.</P>
