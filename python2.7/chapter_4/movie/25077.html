<PRE>"Boys and Girls" (2000)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Robert Iscove
Written by The Drews
Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Claire Forlani, Jason
Biggs, Amanda Detmer, and Heather Donahue</P>
<P>When it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy,
I expect negative reviews from critics left and right.
Predictable, unoriginal, and forgettable will most
likely be the three adjectives to haunt the Down to
You's and the Drive Me Crazy's released by the dozens
these last couple of years. What I really look for in
this kind of movie is the entertainment value while
I'm sitting in the theater. Am I enjoying myself? Is
this a comfortable break from my week of finals? This
is why I have given films like Final Destination or
Road Trip high marks; I had a party of a time wasting
my money on something I won't remember next week.</P>
<P>So last week I opened up the New York Times - and, no
surprise, Boys and Girls got a negative review. Daily
News? Negative. Reelviews? Negative. Epinions.com?
Negative. This was nothing new. American Pie, Final
Destination, Road Trip didn't get such hot reviews and
I loved those guilty pleasures. Same goes for She's
All That, a formulaic but enjoyable Pygmalion
adaptation that got unjustly pounded. Since Boys and
Girls reunites She's All That director Robert Iscove
and actor Freddie Prinze Jr., I predicted déjà vu al
over again. But, still curious, I asked around my
school and from the one or two people who had seen it,
the reactions were far from positive. I had made up my
mind; I'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of
years. But, soon after, following a series of
unexpected events (we couldn't get into Shaft because
it is rated R), I found myself watching Boys and
Girls. Whoops. </P>
<P>Boys and Girls is about a "nerdy, smart" boy named
Ryan (Prinze Jr.) and a "popular, flirt" girl named
Jennifer (Claire Forlani). Briefly meeting as
pre-teens and now attending the same college, the two
bump into each other so many times that eventually
they become best friends. But in the movies, a male
and a female cannot be friends without having that
nagging feeling of attraction for each other. With
advice from their roommates (Amanda Detmer, Jason
Biggs), Ryan and Jennifer attempt to discover the true
meaning of their relationship. </P>
<P>The film definitely lives up to the dreaded three
adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to
be found. I could hardly sit through the 93 minute
running time for several reasons. The dialogue is
probably the worst I have ever seen in any movie,
mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring
script and the ridiculous words these characters use
is what Hollywood thinks kids can relate to. It is
almost offensive. An example of an insightful
conversation:</P>
<PRE>"You're dumb. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb."
"No."
(followed by a Mandy Moore-esque tune background)</PRE>
<P>(Well it's not as bad as Wing Commander I guess)</P>
<P>The supporting cast is also painfully useless. Detmer
and Biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to
happen with their own boring, pointless subplots. And
although this is supposed to be from both perspectives
of the human sex, Prinze Jr's Ryan dominates the
screen while Forlani's Jennifer simply acts as a
dilemma for him to work with. We never learn anything
about Jennifer which is a shame too because Forlani is
the only actor to bring any life into her character. 
Teenager or not: you'll hate this movie, I guarantee
it. Maybe I should rent She's All That again. Is it
really as good as I think it is? </P>
