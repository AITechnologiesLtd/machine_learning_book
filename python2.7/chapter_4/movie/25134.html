<P>   While watching this family movie, I couldn't help thinking of
a friend I have--call him Fred.  Fred teaches social studies in
junior high school and hates himself.  Not that teaching
in a public school should be considered demeaning, but this
guy graduated with honors from Columbia University.  A
reunion was coming up back in 1971, so I asked him whether
he was excited.  "I'm not going," he said with a grimace.  "I
can see myself re-introducing myself to my old classmates. 
Two guys are surgeons, one's a Wall Street tycoon, another
is an adviser to the governor."  Yeah, so? I asked.  "So they'll
ask me what I do, and I'll say I teach history at JHS 224 in
Brooklyn.  And do you know what they'll say?  They'll say,
'Hey, Fred, you always were good for a few jokes.  Now tell
us: what do you really do?'"</P>
<P>   Fred was indeed always good for a laugh and he told the
story in a joking way, but I could see underneath his
bonhomie was a sad man indeed.  When he enrolled in this
privileged, Ivy League institution, he wanted to be a doctor
like his father, and take over the old man's Manhattan Beach
(Brooklyn) practice.  But he just couldn't cut the mustard. 
Quite a few of us are like Fred, I'll bet...we dreamed first of
being firemen and cops, but then by the time high school and
college rolled around, we had more lofty ambitions--doctor,
lawyer, pilot, CEO.  Somehow, something didn't turn out right
and by the time we're forty years old we figure, that's it, this
is what I'll be doing until I retire...teacher, middle
management, freelance consultant.</P>
<P>   Jon Turteltaub's "Disney's The Kid" may be made
principally for the little ones but for the big guys who, like
Fred, have tasted life's disappointments, the movie can hit
home--even draw a tear or two in its sentimental patches.  (If
you're not sure they're meant to be sentimental, Marc
Shaiman's soaring music will clue you in when to cry).  Like
"Frequency" in theme--but without Gregory Hoblit's spooky
ambience--"Disney's The Kid" focuses on a 40-year-old who
is not doing what he dreamed of doing.  Eventually, we learn
what happened to him at the age of eight that gave him a
twitch in the eye and led him to become a middle-aged guy
without a wife, with few if any real friends, and worst of all,
without even a dog.  We learn at the same time as this man,
Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis), because a spot of magic has Russ
meet up with himself at eight years of age when he was
called Rusty (Spencer Breslin). Yep: little Rusty appears
without even a clap of thunder or a bolt of lightning, and for
the next week or so they bond and learn.  The kid learns
what will become of him.  The dad finds out where he went
wrong.</P>
<P>   Although Russ surrendered his childhood dream, we may
find it difficult to be sympathetic.  After all the guy has a
spacious home housing a brand-new shiny black Porsche and
is the owner of a public relations firm with himself as "image
maker" with clients like the state's governor, the city's mayor,
various executives looking to improve the way they come
across in public.  He even gives pro bono advice to an
anchorwoman on the eleven o'clock news whom he takes on
briefly while they are seatmates in first class, advising her to
shorten both her hair and her nails.  For those of us ordinary
guys who like to think that money can't buy happiness, this
movie is a godsend because if you buy that premise, you
might think that maybe even Bruce Willis--who made $54.5
million last year to put himself at the numero uno position
among actors--might be a tad unhappy.</P>
<P>   Bruce Willis acts out Audrey Wells's clever, though never
really hilarious script in such a way that we're never
convinced that he was ever a jerk--not now, not thirty-two
years ago.  For that, you'd have to substitute Steve Martin for
Willis. Even pudgy Spencer Breslin in the role of Russ thirty-
two years ago is just too smart, too boisterous to convince us
that the guy was ever a jerk.  Sure, the kid was beaten up at
recess time by a big bully, and sure, the little guy is subject
to a pratfall or two, but a loser?  No way.  Nonetheless as the
well-heeled, well-trimmed Russ (Willis lost quite a bit of
weight for the role) watches himself as a boy, he does realize
that he was always smarter than most and that with some
more confidence and less weight and perhaps a few boxing
lessons from a champ like Kenny (Chi McBride), he would
have grown up to become that pilot and would understand
why his dad often treated him so harshly that he took on a
permanent twitch in his eye.</P>
<P>   Spencer Breslin as the kid is obviously at home as an
actor, having begun his career at age 3 and has since been
in 50 TV commercials.  (He's the guy who would recite the
"two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles,
onions on a sesame seed bun") but after a while his
rambunctiousness and in-your-face assertiveness becomes
grating.  Russ's relationship with Amy (Emily Mortimer)
doesn't look real and in fact the news anchorwoman played
by Jean Smart would be more of the right match for him.  Lily
Tomlin, however, is well cast as Russ's assistant, Janet, the
kid of helper that any boss would love to have--efficient,
funny, able to talk back to the taskmaster as though she were
an equal.  As a whole, the picture is probably over the heads
of the targeted audience who may not really understand what
is at stake here but at the same time has reasonable appeal
for adults who had to give up their own dreams.  Once again,
though, isn't it difficult to sympathize with a guy who has
everything--looks, physique, profession, sports car, a pad that
could cover the pages of Architectural Digest--and who could
easily pick up a dog and a lovely mate for the asking--but
who missed out on becoming a pilot?</P>
<P>Rated PG.  Running time: 104 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
