<P>   We wear clothes not only to keep warm and preserve our
modesty but to make a statement.  For quite a while, young
women in the U.S. wore jeans torn at the kneecaps, presumably
to show their solidarity with the poor; a statement not only
patronizing but downright ridiculous.  Women in Afghanistan
must cover every part of their bodies except their eyes by order
of the Taliban government, a statement not only of modesty but
of religious belief, at least as interpreted by the rulers in Kabul. 
Nowadays some young people pierce their navels, their tongues,
their eyebrows and more, to show...I don't what...but in any case
that's additional evidence that what we wear often has little to do
with our need for warmth or rational expression.  The fashion
industry in America makes sure that styles change frequently,
thus filling the coffers of the corporations, but the most extreme
illustration of pretentiousness involves the clothes worn by
fashion modes, who show off their designers' ego by donning
raiments shown in stores in the most fashionable boutiques.  The
enterprise is ripe for satire.  Director Ben Stiller pushes parody 
in "Zoolander," so called because that is the name of its
principal character, Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller).  </P>
<P>   The movie has quite a few laughs, but at 85 minutes outwears
its welcome with redundancies. "Zoolander" is more a
series of sketches about yet another version of Dumb and
Dumber, played respectively by Owen Wilson in the role of
male model Hansel and Ben Stiller as the title character.  Derek
Zoolander is the country's most famous male model, having won
the distinction three years consecutively, but like many other
models (at least according to Drake Sather, Ben Stiller and John
Hamburg's screenplay), he is an empty vessel.  He is chosen by
a group of conspirators who could have come out of a James
Bond movie to assist, unknowingly, in the assassination of
Malaysia's (uncredited) prime minister, an official who has
promised to raise the wages paid to those who put the clothing
together.  A wage increase would seriously dampen profits of the
clothing industry i America presided over by Mugatu (Will Ferrell,
wearing an absurd hair style and carrying a small white poodle
throughout he story).  As Zoolander takes part in the modeling of
Mugatu's Derelicte" collection--actually a glorification of the
outfits worn by homeless people in urban streets--he is
unwittingly aiding in the political assassination.</P>
<P>   Director Stiller could have used its lampoon to explore the
actual exploitation of people in the Third World, who must resent
the very well-to-do Americans for whom they are making their
clothing.  But the picture, unfortunately, in no way seeks to do
what iconoclastic filmmaker Michael Moore achieved in his faux
documentary, "The Big One," which took aim at the Nike
company for paying starvation wages to the Indonesians who
sew the running shoes together.  (30,000 Indonesia workers put
together make less than one American on the Nike payroll,
Michael Jordan, who makes 20 million or so a year simply for
endorsing the product.)</P>
<P>   Still, "Zoolander" has some laughs to offer, especially beneficial
to those who believe that in these challenging, post-World Trade
Center times we need broad-comedy-hold-the-satire.  Some cute
gags involve the founding of a "Center for Children Who Can't
Read Good" and the action taken with a computer to release
incriminating files.  A father-son dialogue between Ben and Jerry
(Stiller) is effective and a New Jersey joke is not without good
fun.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 85 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
