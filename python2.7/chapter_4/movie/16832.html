<PRE>[2.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Helen's day has been cut short since she has unfortunately been fired.
Something strange happens on her way home. Her reality is separated into two
parallel universes, and the viewer follows her in each of the separate
storylines. In one storyline, she just catches her train and arrives home to
find her boyfriend with another woman. In the other storyline she misses her
train, so by the time she arrives home, the other woman is gone, and she is
none the wiser. The viewer is then presented with the obviously different
consequences of each situation.</P>
<P>The reason for the split into parallel universes is not given, and is not
all that relevant since this is meant to be a romantic film rather than a
science fiction presentation of chaos theory and the butterfly effect. No
meaningful exploration of those issues, or any of the science of the topic,
are in this film. The juggling of the different storylines is handled very
well and the viewer is never confused. However, nothing significant is
presented by having the two "what if" scenarios, and as a result it ends up
as appearing as just a gimmick. Besides the split, this is a standard film.
The protagonists have no flaws and the antagonists have no redeeming values,
and melodrama is routinely injected to keep the story going to its
underwhelming end.</P>
<P>Marginally Recommended. There is nothing exceptional about this film. It
does not take any real chances and does not offer anything new. For those
who like romance films, this will probably be enjoyed.<HR></P>
