<P>When the preview audience for "Knock Off" exited the theater, they were 
more demonstrative than any movie audience I have ever seen. Friends were 
taking turns trying to come up with the rudest possible one-liner to 
describe the movie. One young man held his arms above his head, making 
violent thumbs-down gestures with both hands while shouting, "Sucks! 
Sucks!" over and over. Most of the crowd simply walked out briskly, 
shaking their heads and loudly discussing how amazingly bad the film was. 
These people renewed my faith in humanity.</P>
<P>This piece will be relatively brief, because it seems foolish to spend 
more time writing the review for "Knock Off" than the authors spent 
writing the script. To put it as simply as possible, the film is, honest 
to God, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So bad that it left me 
mesmerized; transfixed in some quasi-hypnotic state of disbelief.</P>
<P>While hyping the film to Entertainment Weekly, Jean-Claude Van Damme told 
interviewers that his cocaine addiction was at its worst during the 
filming of "Knock Off." It shows. While his body remains muscular, Van 
Damme's face looks pallid and his expression dazed. He sweats a lot 
during scenes where he is just standing around talking. He looks like a 
heart-attack waiting to happen. School administrators could radically cut 
down on student drug use simply by forcing the kids to watch this film. 
Of course, that could land the school in court, because making students 
sit through "Knock Off" would probably be ruled as corporal punishment.</P>
<P>Set in Hong Kong just prior to its return to Chinese rule, the story 
involves miniature explosives, cut-rate imitations of designer jeans, CIA 
agents, lots of mobsters chasing each other around and loads of 
explosions. The specifics don't matter - they certainly didn't to the 
filmmakers. "Knock Off" is merely a long series of horribly filmed stunts,
 punctuated by poorly delivered one-liners and incomprehensible plot 
mechanics.</P>
<P>It begins with Van Damme huffing and puffing while pulling Rob Schneider 
in a rickshaw race, while Schneider whips him with a dead eel and shouts 
"move that beautiful ass!" Why? I have no idea. Toy dolls blow up in the 
waters near the harbor. Paul Sorvino and Lela Rochon show up to snarl and 
chase everyone around. A grossly obese mobster spews threats. Cars, boats 
and giant Buddha's explode. Van Damme's stunt double fights dozens of men,
 while Schneider makes a vain attempt at being an action hero and wormy 
smart-ass at the same time. And Van Damme, bless his heart, tries to act 
in a performance so wooden that it makes Ben Stein look animated by 
comparison.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, director Tsui Hark uses a dizzying array of camera tricks to 
try and hide the movie's myriad flaws. He sends the lens zooming up the 
barrel of a gun to focus on the shooter. His cameras swoop, swirl, twist 
and turn, especially during the action scenes. In fact, Hark shoots the 
action scenes using so many close-ups that he actually mutes any impact 
or sense of excitement the scenes might have had. The whole thing plays 
like a substandard episode of the "Power Rangers," except the Rangers are 
better actors.</P>
<P>Here's hoping Jean-Claude Van Damme succeeds in keeping off cocaine. 
Here's hoping Rob Schneider goes back to doing straight comedy. And 
finally, here's hoping you have the common sense to stay as far away from 
"Knock Off" as possible.  </P>
