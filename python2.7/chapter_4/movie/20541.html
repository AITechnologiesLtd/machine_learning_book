<P>It is not so much for that reason that _American_Beauty_ defies
conventional categorization than the manner in which it blends disparate
elements; that is, incredibly seamlessly.  Credit Ball and especially
Mendes, who knows not to simply strike the major note of each given scene
but also touch on the undertones that will take prominence in others. 
Even in the more outrageous, laugh-inducing moments, a darker, more
serious undercurrent can always be felt.  Part of this has to do with an
ominous piece of information that Lester divulges in voiceover in the
film's opening minutes: "In less than a year, I will be dead." </P>
<P>The deft meshing of the comic and the tragic is best exemplified by the
characters.  This group of people is far from the most likable bunch one
can encounter; in fact, often they are flat-out unlikable, and much of
the film's humor is derived from that point.  But for all their comic
value, the characters aren't caricatures; they're painfully human. 
Underneath their frequently selfish actions lies their shared motivation:
a grave emotional desperation.  That deeper dimension comes through in
every one of the actors' performances; even the younger members of the
cast hold an impressively firm grasp of their characters' complexities. 
The most difficult acting job, of course, belongs to Spacey, whose
extraordinary performance not only makes Lester's newly rebellious life
course wickedly hilarious, but heartbreakingly sad as well.</P>
<P>_American_Beauty_ has been described as both a comedy and a drama, but
neither one is the most fitting description.  In retrospect, the term
that springs  to mind is mystery, but not necessarily because of the
questions surrounding Lester's eventual demise, though they do figure
prominently.  The film's central mystery is that of the meaning of its
title.  The answer that is eventually arrived at may not be all that
surprising, and perhaps a bit trite for some.  But what comes as
something of a shock is how profound and exhilarating the experience of
its discovery is--not so much for any of the film's characters, but for
the audience.  (opens September 15)</P>
