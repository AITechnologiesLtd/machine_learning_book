<P>Being John Malkovich: alice in hollywood</P>
<P>The test of a fantastic story is whether or not you can interpret it in such
a way that all the 'fantastic' stuff comes out as projected material--some
character's internal world being presented as external. Think Fisher King.
To look at it another way, if you strip off all the fantastic elements,
there should still be a story there we can somehow relate to, make sense of,
etc. All of which comes down to the big question: are the fantastic elements
really necessary? Could Fisher King have been presented in any other way and
still have been as effective? Unlikely. The same goes for Spike Jonze's
Being John Malkovich, a movie which casually asks us to accept that there
might be 'corridors' you can stumble upon which allow temporary access into
another person's mind.</P>
<P>And, in our hero Craig Schwarz' (John Cusack) case, not just any mind, but
one with a face we all know: John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Craig
discovers this corridor when he hires on as file clerk for a company
stationed on the mythical 7½th floor of a major office building, a floor
which logically shouldn't exist, which is our cue that there's going to be
some serious make-believe going on here. Before Craig even gets to the 7½th
floor, though, we already know that: can a struggling puppeteer whose wife
takes the family chimp to psychotherapy even have an ordinary adventure? Of
course not. So when we see him crouching his way down the diminutive halls
of his new workplace, dodging the 105-year old lecherous boss (Orson Bean),
exchanging banter with the speech-impeded secretary, it's hardly a surprise.
Or, the surprise is that Being John Malkovich is going further than most
comedies, isn't settling for the traditional quirky character in a sane
world (Don Quixote) or vice-versa (Brazil), but is instead creating
characters who are quirky because that's the only sane response to a
fundamentally quirky world.</P>
<P>It's about survival, which, for Craig, is immediately identified with
romancing cold-shouldered co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), which is
another thing Being John Malkovich casually asks us to accept, or rather,
doesn't really bother to explain. But so be it. She is beautiful, and
'other,' and without pets, so maybe that's all a comedy needs in the way of
justification. After all, this is a movie where a chimpanzee has a flashback
with English subtitles; compared to this, any honest character motivations
would appear minor. And in comedy the focus is always on end results,
anyway, not causes. Causes don't make us laugh; results do. They're the
punchlines. And Being John Malkovich has enough to go around, from selling
tickets to John Malkovich's head ($200 for 15 min. of fame) to the highly
inventive love triangle that Craig and Maxine and Lotte (Craig's wife, a
brunette Cameron Diaz) find themselves in, with the body of John Malkovich
in there somewhere too, unwittingly at first, unwillingly as things
progress.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this, too--at the core of the movie--Craig's getting to
live out every puppeteer's primal fantasy: to be inside the skin of someone
else, which of course is inconsiderate enough that it eventualy has to
backfire, give him an opportunity to learn, occasionally despair, etc. But
it's an entertaining ride while it lasts--Faust with the headlights off. And
does it all work if we take this 'corridor' to function as Craig's
projection? Yes. One way of looking at it is simply as the story of two
people drifting inexorably apart, only one of them is actively trying to
slow things down with a (Schehezeradean) story that eventually spools out of
his control, leaving him stranded first on the New Jersey turnpike, next
somewhere even more unexpected. Another way of looking at is as the most
inventive movie in a long while, one of the few that can string together an
extended series of wholly implausible What Ifs into a marginally coherent
narrative.</P>
<P>And if that's not enough, Being John Malkovich also has the bar-none best
cameo ever: Charlie Sheen as Charlie Sheen, talking about lesbian witches
and how the truth is for suckers, a tall drink in his hand the whole time, a
telling smirk on his face that simply won't go away. The only other movie
this year that can possibly compare with Being John Malkovich would have to
be American Beauty, but that's all the way in the suburbs, leaving Being
John Malkovich in a class of its own. There's simply nothing else quite like
it. It's like finding your own little corridor which opens onto a whole new
world of movie-making, where the rules of mainstream don't hold. Stay as
long as you can.</P>
