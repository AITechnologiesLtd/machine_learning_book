<PRE>                               THE GLASS SHIELD
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     At least it *sounded* like a good idea.  Unfortunately, the
execution of the new Miramax film, THE GLASS SHIELD, a drama set in an
L.A. sheriff's station, leaves the viewer with little more than the
perception that he's just seen a movie that could have been something,
but didn't quite make it.</P>
<P>     THE GLASS SHIELD is the tragic tale of J. J. Johnson (Michael
Boatman), a bright-eyed and idealistic black deputy-in-training who is
"chosen" to join an all-white Los Angeles station for his first
assignment.  There, he encounters not-so-subtle racism and persecution
which begins to crack his romanticism of the cop's life.</P>
<P>     Soon after his arrival, J. J. is drawn into a plot to falsify
evidence against a supposed murderer.  Then, a much deeper conspiracy
is uncovered, and J. J. and his sole ally, Deborah (Lori Petty, as the
only female and only Jew in the department), become trapped between the
wheels of the conspirators and the legal system, both of which they are
sworn to serve.</P>
<P>     The trouble with THE GLASS SHIELD is that the storytelling is so
heavy-handed and convoluted that it never becomes the gripping thriller
that it wanted to be.  In fact, television shows like Law and Order and
NYPD Blue tell more enthralling stories in half the time.  Director and
screenwriter Charles Burnett introduces far too many pointless
characters and takes the movie down so many subplot paths that the
moviegoer has no choice but to give up trying to pin names to faces.
And although the lengthy narrative scenes are cut with some nice bits,
like renegade cop Baker (Michael Ironside) jamming a gun into J. J.'s
mouth and threatening to blow his head off in the station building
itself, they don't even look like they belong in a movie that feels
dedicated to droning on and on without really moving the story
forward.</P>
<P>     There are some parts to the film that shine:  Boatman is
absolutely riveting as J. J., and the bad guys couldn't be any badder.
The clever use of sedated color and lighting and some nice camerawork
help the film immensely, also.  But on the other hand, the casting of
Petty is a complete mystery--she's completely lifeless and out of place
here.  After all, I'm not the only one who hasn't forgotten TANK GIRL
(though I'd desperately like to).</P>
<P>     Burnett is a lucky alumnus of the MacArthur "genius" Grant clique
and obviously feels like he can't be second-guessed.  Hopefully his ego
won't be too bruised by the lukewarm reception his film is getting, but
he does need a wake-up call.  THE GLASS SHIELD may have a few bright
spots, but overall, it is definitely not the work of a genius.</P>
