<P>There have been several disappointing and unfulfilling movies both this
year and last that have received the "comic book" label - a heavy blow
from the critical community. The film is then perceived as low-class,
unintelligent, and thoughtless entertainment. There is a dedicated
audience who will see those movies anyway - the ones that actually do
read comic books - but overall the movie founders on rough waters.
BLADE, too, is worthy of such a title. But instead of being among the
bottom-feeders, this movie epitomizes the comic book action subgenre. It
is surely a testament to its source, as well as a welcome achievement
for genre fans. </P>
<P>The movie opens with a young man being led to an underground nightclub
by his newfound date. Intent on getting some action, he doesn't realize
anything's wrong until the techno/hip-hop music climbs to a fever pace
and blood begins to rain down from the ceiling. He's scrambling for his
life, surrounded by vampires, until he runs into the thick black boots
of Blade (Wesley Snipes). Impossibly clean and immaculately tailored in
black leather, Blade is our hero. Nicknamed the Daywalker by the
bloodsucking breed, he is a hybrid vampire-human who kills as many
vampires as he can to avenge his mother's death to the nasties. Aided by
an aging partner named Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and a hemotologist
(N'Bushe Wright), he must stop a young vampire named Frost (Stephen
Dorff) who plans a complete revolution in the ranks. </P>
<P>The opening scenes are almost entirely action and have little to do with
vampire legend or lore. Although vampires are a popular fantasy element,
BLADE ignores this initally and thus resembles something of a more
serious BATMAN. At times, one wonders if this might've been the road
that the Dark Knight features would've taken if they hadn't succumbed to
the goofy direction of Joel Schumacher. As it progresses, though, the
movie turns increasingly to its fantasy roots - there are certain rules
to putting a vampire in his grave, and even when you follow those you
still get a lot of gore. Moments of excessive gore or non-sequitous sex
appeal are mostly unwanted but do not detract from the overall value.
But by the final scene, the movie has left any Earthen setting and
instead prefers a MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE-esque swordfight to decide
all. </P>
<P>The characters are written in an acceptably melodramatic fashion. Like
New Line's other comic book adaptation from last year, SPAWN, this one
is more dark than it is light. Unlike SPAWN, however, BLADE manages to
become more realistic through characters that are more easily accepted
as well as better defined. Snipes gives us an expectedly stoic Blade,
and though not outstanding, he acts consistently for two hours. Dorff's
bad guy Frost is mostly uninspired until the closing half-hour, when
Dorff allows wit to take over. Then he becomes a more lifelike character
rather than a pale, cigarette-smoking upstart. Despite minor setbacks
such as these, it's no wonder that everything in BLADE manages to fall
into place. Topped off with absurdedly Oscar-quality sound and visual
effects, BLADE is a well-spent trip to the theater.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "BLADE": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
