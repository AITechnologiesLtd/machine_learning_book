<PRE>A REVIEW OF "SE7EN"
A RETRO REVIEW, 1995
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>One of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made,
"Se7en" is just a few steps away from brilliance. However, those
few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and
depravity that few people want to discuss. The film received
mixed reviews upon release, but there's an underlying sinister
appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not
notice. At times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be
criticizing, but the script and the ultimate pay-off are
excellent. The shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as
the endings of most films ARE predictable.</P>
<P>This piece of work is 100% intensity. It's uncomfortable to
watch, yet compelling. "I want not to look, yet I cannot turn
away." The story creeps along slowly and deliberately, crafted by
visionary director David Fincher. He has experience in
tantalizing his audience with information and visions, but not
giving away too much too soon. This is the guy who directed the
ominous "Alien 3". "Se7en" is even more ominous because the
threat is real. It's human and, while the script takes some
artistic licence, the way in which the diabolical killer works
here is actually realistic. That is, if a human being could be so
intelligent, patient, wealthy, and disillusioned.</P>
<P>After the most bizarre opening credits I've ever seen
(refreshingly different in editing style and musical
accompaniment), the initial character development takes place.
Morgan Freeman stars as Detective William Somerset, a
knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the
sickness of society. Brad Pitt co-stars as Detective David Mills,
the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full
of fury to catch the bad guys. These two fine actors give the
film its human qualities (along with the appealing Gwyneth
Paltrow, who plays Tracy, Mills' wife). However, none of them
stands out above the material. No disrespect intended, but two
other actors could have played these parts and the film probably
would have been about the same.</P>
<P>An ironic note is that Somerset has only a week (or 7, that's
SEVEN, days) left on the force to train his young protege. The
title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins, as
chronicled by John Milton in "Paradise Lost"--Gluttony, Greed,
Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, & Wrath. Incidentally, I wrote the sins
in order of how each victim was found. It's the last two sins
that are the most intriguing and shocking, but I won't give that
away. As I said, this has a great ending and no one should spoil
it. Anyway, the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to
the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he
makes the "sinners" suffer for it.</P>
<P>The two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese
man. They learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to
death. The killer leaves small clues at this and other murders
and, of course, Somerset and Mills are smart enough to stay with
him all the way. If they didn't, it would be one short movie! The
deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story. We
see a lot of blood, but it's not especially violent. The
suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything
actually shown--like most of the violence in "Pulp Fiction".
"Se7en" is gory, graphic, and disturbing, but all the gore is
post-death. Still, if you tend to get queasy, don't eat food
during this film.</P>
<P>Kevin Spacey plays John Doe, the avenging angel who claims that
he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings.
Like many crazy men, he has some fine ideas, but some sick ways
of expressing himself. Spacey doesn't appear until the final 30
minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits.
However, it's HIS appearance that turns this film upside down and
for that he should have gotten an Oscar nomination. A great
villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled
to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with
him or not. This character is so well written that it's hard to
disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by
everyone. No serial killer has ever been so creative.</P>
<P>"Se7en" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors
of the world and it's often a little too depressing. What it
lacks in those areas, it makes up for with believable dialogue,
top-notch screenwriting, unexpected twists, and realistic
characters. The technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive.
Fincher uses lighting, music, and editing quite well, but his
story is always the thrust of the film. Fortunately, we don't
find out what happens to Mills and Somerset after the closing
credits (which are run backwards UP the screen!). It's better to
imagine what paths they will follow. This is not the kind of film
you turn away from and quickly forget. It's got a sinister
message and John Doe is right about one thing--the evils of the
world aren't going to cure themselves. "Se7en" raises some tough
questions and it's intelligent enough to allow its audience to
answer many of those questions for themselves.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Co-stars in 1995's "Se7en", Brad Pitt and Kevin
Spacey also competed for the 1995 Best Supporting Actor
Oscar--Pitt in "12 Monkeys", Spacey in "The Usual Suspects" (for
which he won).</P>
