                         The Big Night (1996)
                   A film review by John Schuurman
                    Copyright 1996 John Schuurman</PRE>
<P>Co-Directors: CAMPBELL SCOTT and STANLEY TUCCI
Screenplay by: JOSEPH TROPIANO, STANLEY TUCCI</P>
<P>At the end of this fine food film, after all the Italian
passion -- the shouting, the kissing, the fighting, the
yearning -- is over, and defeat is certain for all has been
spent, there is still the cooking of an omelet. </P>
<P>Secundo, the brother whom we think has lost the most, (he
possesses none of the  genius of the food artist Primo), cooks
an omelet as an act of service for his helper and his brother.
This simple three egg omelet is perhaps the last bit of food
that will be given life in this restaurant called "Paradise." </P>
<P>We watch as this omelet is made. We watch the whole thing,
without aid of time lapse photography, words, or music -- only
the clicks of spatula and fork and our melancholia to help us.
We watch the omelet from the idea of it, to the gathering of
material for it, through the cooking, the serving, and at last
the eating of it. And when at the final bite, a hesitant arm
is extended over the great divide --  Secundo to Primo,
business man to artist, pragmatist to idealist -- we know we
have seen something god-like. It is an act full of love and
forgiveness and promise. </P>
<P>It is quite a divide that must be bridged because this is a
culture clash film. It is Old World vs. New World; principle
vs. utility; fine cuisine vs. beer and pizza; the holiness of
genius vs. base and filthy lucre. </P>
<P>Secundo, who cooks the omelet and extends the arm, is not the
cook. He is the business man. He and his brother Primo are
immigrants from Italy who have come to make their fortune in
America. Secundo would like to compromise in matters of taste
for the sake of the business. Primo cannot -- will not -- do
it. "If you sacrifice, then the work dies." </P>
<P>If you know an artist (in the radical sense of that word) for
whom to compromise artistic standards in any way means
pandering to the philistine taste of base people or else
prostituting the artistic soul for mere money or worldly
success, you will be reminded of him or her in this film. </P>
<P>In art the question is always, "Who is art for?" Is art for
the sake of ART or perhaps for the "gods?"  Is the work the
thing? Is the artist's authenticity and integrity ultimate?
Must the artist be true only to himself and the rest be
damned? Or is business the god who must be served? You have
heard the arguments before. "You have to give people what they
want or you won't be able to give them any thing at all." In
this movie the line is, "I am a business man. I am what I need
to be at the time." </P>
<P>So which wins in this movie? Neither. After a final "Big
Night," and an omelet the morning after,  Paradise must close.
Business has lost -- art too. </P>
<P>But as we leave we are hopeful if somewhat melancholy. Hope
arises as Secundo cooks and then places his hesitant hand on
Primo's shoulder. These acts are a bridge across the divide.
They suggest a third and better way: not art for ART, nor art
for money;  not the artist as rare self-indulgent eccentric, nor as
pitiable prostitute who has sold his genius for a mess of the world's
tripe.. Rather art as service, art as love, art as, "let me make
something beautiful for you." </P>
<PRE>=============</PRE>
<P>This movie has an "R" rating because of rough language and a suggested
adulterous sexual situation. </P>
