A Little Romance (1979)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 59</PRE>
<P>While on a field trip with schoolmates to a movie studio in France,
Daniel (Thelonious Bernard) meets Lauren (Dianne Ladd), who has 
been taken there by actress Kay King (Sally Kellerman).  Both 
Bernard and Ladd are barely into their teens, and they have 
something else in common: they're very smart and virtually 
friendless.  They connect, and begin arranging furtive dates behind 
their parents' back.</P>
<P>For Ladd's birthday, a party for her has long been arranged.
But her own mother forgets about this and gives a wrap party for
her latest picture on the same day.  Ladd and her friends,
one of whom is Bernard, are relegated to her room, which is
just as well since they evade parental supervision, drink
champagne, and dance closely.  Leaving her room, Bernard
runs into the jerk director, who makes a public snide remark
about his scoring with Ladd.  Bernard punches the director
in the stomach and demands an apology.  This puts Bernard
on Kellerman's blacklist, and Ladd is told she cannot see
him again.  Which she does anyway.</P>
<P>Kellerman has been married three times.  Current husband
Richard (Arthur Hill) is patient but still frustrated with her 
cavorting with her latest film's director.  Good news (for him) 
comes when his company informs him that he will be transferred 
from France to Houston at the end of the month.  Kellerman isn't
happy about the coming move.  Even less so is Ladd.</P>
<P>While hanging in the park, Bernard accidentally knocks down 
an elderly gentleman (Laurence Olivier).  Bernard and Ladd
help him up and are then treated to lunch, with Olivier
telling lies and tall tales to impress them.  Ladd believes
the stories, but more worldly Bernard is suspicious.</P>
<P>One of Olivier's stories is that lovers who kiss in a gondola
in a Venice under a certain bridge at sunset when church bells
are tolling will love each forever.  Ladd takes this story
to heart and becomes obsessed at fulfulling this destiny
with Bernard.</P>
<P>Tbey need money for the trip, and go to the racetrack with
Olivier to win it.  Bernard's horse loses the race, but
Olivier switches bets and wins big.  (It turns out that
Olivier is a con artist and pickpocket, and he stole the
money).</P>
<P>Olivier, for some reason interested in getting himself and
his new friends in endless trouble for the sake of a first 
crush, helps Bernard and Ladd run away from home, putting
them on a train to Italy.  The kid's parents get wind of the
scheme and go to Italy to retrieve them.  Ladd's pretty
face is in the newspaper as a missing child.  To avoid
capture, Bernard, Ladd and Olivier join a bicycle race,
which appears to be a plot device to have Olivier crash his bike.</P>
<P>Bernard and Ladd after some further difficulty manage to
kiss in a gondola under that bridge at sunset with the church
bells tolling.  Olivier and the lovesick teens are caught
and return to France.  On the day that Ladd must return to the
states, Ladd sees Bernard and Olivier (who curiously is not
in jail) and has a tearjerker parting.</P>
