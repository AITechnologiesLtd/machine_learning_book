<P>8MM is not going to enlighten your day. It's a dark, grimy and
disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive
violence. Not only do you need the stomach to make it through this
bloated mess, you'll require a lot of patience as well.</P>
<P>Nicolas Cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late. He
wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful
Snake Eyes, and here he attempts a performance that can relate to
someone completely losing their grip on reality. Cage plays Private
Investigator Tom Welles, praised for his secrecy and reliability. At
home, Welles is a family man, with a wife (Catherine Keener) and a small
daughter to take care of. His new assignment is a bizarre one: the wife
of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery
regarding a film found  in her husband's safe. The film appears to be
some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked
man, until the girl is brutally murdered. Or so it seems.</P>
<P>Welles, of course, begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the
truth. And the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case, the
more he gets in over his head. He hires an adult book store clerk named
Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) to be his guide through the ugly
underworld of pornography. Max knows what Welles is getting himself
into, and explains, `you dance with the devil, the devil don't change.
The devil changes you.' These turn out to be very wise words.</P>
<P>8MM has a premise that begs for a better execution. The set-up is slick
and well played, as Cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels
to Hollywood to locate her. This is where everything goes awry. Although
director Joel Schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque
portrait of the `real world', he forgot to inject any interest or
excitement to the formula. Everything about the movie becomes dull and
lifeless, repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects.
Although it had enormous potential, the third act of 8MM is a total
bust, leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme
disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control.</P>
<P>Cage is the film's sole flame of energy. His performance is actually
believable, but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on
his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation. Still, you've
got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he
did, for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand.</P>
<P>Welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker (played convincingly
by Peter Stormare) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films
in the industry. This is where Cage goes over the edge into a serial
killer-like phase, in which he must take revenge on all those who
murdered the innocent girl in the film. He tracks down the masked man
responsible for the killing (Chris Bauer), and they have a bloody brawl
in the local cemetery, a fight sequence that would look more at home in
a Schwarzenegger movie. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, 8MM dissipates
into a poor man's Seven, with all the violence but little of the
effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece.
Furthermore, what has become of Joel Schumacher? The director has
recently experienced a major drought, slumming in the depths of dismal
flop after flop (Batman and Robin, anyone?). This putrid thriller is
certainly not going to revive his career, so perhaps Schumacher should
start exploring his lighter side.</P>
