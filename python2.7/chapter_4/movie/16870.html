<P> Spiceworld (1998) 1 star out of 4. Starring the Spice Girls.</P>
<P> Spice World  tries very hard to be A Hard Day's Night. Unfortunately, it
turns out to be "Blandworld," a movie aimed at the female pre-pubescent
fans of the Spice Girls, a British girls group whose members offer more
attitude than talent.</P>
<P> Luckily, it is their attitude that salvages this movie. While the Spice
Girls are by no means actresses, their lack of self-consciousness before
the camera gives the film a naturalistic vibrancy.</P>
<P> As performers the Spice Girls are merely adequate. They strut and pose
rather than dance, and they at least sing on key. Their songs are
unremarkable, and after a while, they all begin to sound alike.</P>
<P> Despite cameos from Elton John and Elvis Costello, among others, most of
the regular performances are embarassingly hammy.</P>
<P> It's a shame to see a wonderful actor such as Richard E. Grant, as the
girls' manager, mug his way through the proceedings. Roger Moore, as the
behind-the-scenes Mr. Big, is a travesty.</P>
<P> More than anything else, Spice World  needs a harder edge. The girls try
too hard to please and to be liked and accepted, unlike the Beatles who, in
A Hard Day's Night, enjoyed thumbing their noses at the establishment.</P>
<P> A little more seasoning added to the Spice World  recipe, could have made
for a tasty treat instead of a safe, unoriginal extended music video.</P>
