<P>Senseless (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)
        Marlon Wayans is a very talented physical comedian, and it is that gift
that brings Senseless moments of life.  Alas, moments are simply that,
moments, which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its
one-joke premise.
        Granted, that one joke is initially amusing.  When Wayans's Darryl
Witherspoon, an economics major at Stratford University, hits some dire
financial straits, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that
heightens all five senses.  After some initial side effects and problems
controlling his superhuman senses, Darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of
his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed
corporate firm.
        At this point, the film sounds more like Senseful than Senseless, but
through some turns of the plot, Darryl finds himself only able to use four
of his five senses at once, essentially leaving him--yes--senseless.  This
sets up some showcase moments for Wayans's gift for physical comedy,
especially when Darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes
completely, hilariously limp.  But these gags, and the gag behind the
entire movie, quickly grows stale.  Once Darryl is shown without the use of
all of the senses, instead of exploring any new comic territory, director
Penelope Spheeris and screenwriters Greg Erb and Craig Mazin take the easy
way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness.  Wayans approaches
each go-round with gusto, but by this point he's simply treading water for
the rest of the film's unfunny duration.
        Senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be
anything more than a comic trifle.  However, the raucous and often raunchy
comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity.  Darryl goes through the
experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family, and this "serious"
angle seems to come from an entirely different movie.  Unlike Wayans's last
starring vehicle, the surprisingly effective (and serious) The 6th Man, the
"emotional" content of Senseless is forced and unconvincing.  Any attempt
at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--Darryl's romance
with Janice (Tamara Taylor), a young woman who yearns for a man who is true
to himself, does not generate sparks of any kind.
        Once his WB television sitcom The Wayans Bros. comes to an end, the
genuinely funny Marlon Wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of
him.  But if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as
Senseless, his film career could go the way of his once-promising older
brother, Damon, who is now set to make his comeback--on television.</P>
