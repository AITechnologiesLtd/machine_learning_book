<PRE>Cold and Stale
Topsy-Turvy</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>I tried, but I couldn't make it all the way through this film. Fifty-five
minutes isn't a respectable enough length of time to do a legitimate review.
Therefore, feel free to call this review illegitimate.</P>
<P>Regrettably, I found this cold clammy presentation nearly as frigid as the
theater in which it was screened. Five layers of clothing, and a scarf
couldn't protect me from either. While the elaborately costumed characters
were cursing the oppressively hot weather in Europe, it seemed to me that if
I were to reach up and touch them, I'd find the temperature of their pale
cheeks similar to that of bathroom tile.</P>
<P>Set in Paris and London, the story opens as an "artistic-type" emotional
Sullivan scored his last composition for the trivial topsy-turvy stories of
the sternly British scrooge-like Gilbert. Sullivan wants to write operas!
Amidst this drama, long excerpts from productions are included, but play
heavily, contributing nothing to the behind-the-scenes story at hand.
Admittedly, I am a lover of the silver screen, not the stage. Visa-versian's
may beg to disagree with this review. To them I say, "No need to beg ... I'm
glad you enjoy stage. In fact, this article may very well be meaningless to
those of you that adore Gilbert and Sullivan productions."</P>
<P>I am a lover of music, mind you. A pianist myself, still, the musical
interludes and interjections fall like concrete (in all fairness, the
theater's sound system was sorely outdated). Nothing inspires, nor warms my
cold heart, though several attempts are made. In one bid at humor, two
topless dancers laughingly touch each other's toplessness; in another
attempt, one fellow in top hat and coat declares, "I played golf this
morning!" The lady gasps, "In this heat?" The gentleman, "Yes, but not in
this attire." (A few people snicker in the audience. Could I be missing
something?)</P>
<P>The vulnerability displayed by a vain Gilbert when the loss of Sullivan's
musical partnership seems imminent caught my attention. I do hope the
writers capitalize on this interesting character trait. Other than that, the
acting itself is fine, the costuming grand, but the over all appeal ...well,
not enough to keep me in my seat.</P>
