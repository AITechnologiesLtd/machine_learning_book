<P>     As life goals, serenity and wisdom are noble and admirable.  As
drama, on the other hand, they leave a _lot_ to be desired.  Martin
Scorsese's KUNDUN, advertised as "the amazing story of the fourteenth
Dalai Lama," is a beautifully filmed and extraordinarily reverent bio-pic.
And it's a strong dose of cinematic NyQuil.  Though it's bound to please
those who admire its subject, other viewers are going to wonder why they
should spend over two hours watching a film with only the faintest whisper
of internal conflict.</P>
<P>     KUNDUN opens in 1937, where a group of Tibetan holy men are on a
quest for a very special child:  the 14th Dalai Lama, the reincarnation of
the Buddha of love and compassion.  In a remote village near the Chinese
border, they find him, an inquisitive two-and-a-half-year-old (Tenzin
Yeshi Paichang) who correctly identifies artifacts from the previous Dalai
Lama.  The boy is brought with his family to the city of Lhasa, where his
instruction begins under Ling Rinpoche (Tenzin Trinley).  Unfortunately,
it is a time of conflict between Tibet and China over Tibetan sovereignty,
forcing the teenage Dalai Lama (Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong) to deal with
delicate matters of state.  Faced with impending Chinese aggression, the
Dalai Lama must decide whether to stay with his people or flee into exile.</P>
<P>     The most frustrating thing about KUNDUN is that it's the kind of
story I've chastised Hollywood for not telling.  Unlike the recent SEVEN
YEARS IN TIBET, it is a story set in Tibet which is actually about
Tibetans, featuring a cast composed entirely of non-professional actors.
That gives KUNDUN a greater sense of integrity, but it does nothing for
the dramatic impact of the story.  Scorsese has brought together a group
of people whose goal is to honor the Dalai Lama with snapshots of his life
and his devotion to the welfare of his people.  We watch the Dalai Lama
learn Buddhist doctrine; we watch him eager to face his responsibilities;
we watch him consult with his advisors and make wise, morally sound
decisions.  What we see scarcely a moment of is the Dalai Lama as an
individual.  Though he sometimes sees terrible visions, this
preternaturally serene teen almost never seems shaken or lacking in
confidence.  The resulting film is completely faithful, but it moves like
a tortoise in need of a laxative.  When the Dalai Lama begins looking
through his telescope as an adolescent, I started hoping he'd spot Brad
Pitt so the production could find some energy.</P>
<P>     Eventually there is a bit more interest generated by the Dalai Lama's
interactions with the Chinese.  The final hour becomes a series of fervent
hopes and broken Chinese promises, periodically broken up by an audience
with Chairman Mao.  Though this ideological battle should provide plenty
of chances for strong dramatic sequences, it rarely does.  The Dalai Lama
is shown in a near-constant state of concern over how his decisions will
affect his people, but we get only token glimpses of those people.
KUNDUN's most potent moment finds a Tibetan villager, asked by the Dalai
Lama how she is doing, collapsing in tears as she mouths a Communist
slogan about how "happy and prosperous" she is.  Even a few more such
moments could have given the suffering of the Tibetan people a face and an
emotional connection.  This is a history of a repressed people which
almost never leaves the confines of the world of politicians.</P>
<P>     Martin Scorsese is too talented a director to put together anything
that is a complete waste of time.  There are a couple of clever moments
like the puzzled reaction of the Dalai Lama's older brother when forced to
bow to him; Scorsese's regular team, including production designer Dante
Ferretti, turns Moroccan locations into a splendid backdrop for the Dalai
Lama's life.  It's what happens in front of that backdrop which may cause
you do drop back in your seat and grab a quick nap.  As important a story
as KUNDUN may be, the film rarely does more than trudge through fifteen
years of Tibetan history, always careful to show the utmost respect for
His Holiness.  Perhaps Scorsese saw this as an opportunity to make up for
his previous attempt at the life story of a revered figure, one which
sparked instant outrage.  No chance of controversy this time around --
think of KUNDUN as THE LACK OF TEMPTATION OF THE DALAI LAMA.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 safe Tibets:  5.</PRE>
