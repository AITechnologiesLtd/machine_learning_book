<P>     THE LITTLE VAMPIRE falls squarely in the center of the "family film" 
continuum -- a place few family films tend to occupy. On one end, we find
those films that appeal to viewers of all ages with imagination and a lack
of pandering (TOY STORY, E.T., BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). On the other end, we
find those films that appeal either to marketing concerns (POKEMON, MIGHTY
MORPHIN POWER RANGERS) or toilet humor (most live-action Disney films of
the last decade). True mediocrity in family filmmaking is quite a rarity,
which makes THE LITTLE VAMPIRE an intriguing pop culture curiosity: It's a
simple and whimsical tale that keeps flirting with inappropriateness.</P>
<P>     One-time JERRY MAGUIRE moppet Jonathan Lipnicki stars as Tony
Thompson, an 8-year-old dragged by his parents (Tommy Hinkley and Pamela
Gidley) from San Diego to Scotland for his dad's assignment designing a
new golf course. As though bullying by his xenophobic schoolmates and
being a Chargers fan were not horrifying enough, Tony discovers that his
new hometown is filthy with vampires. Fortunately, they're a kinder,
gentler vampire family that prefers to dine on bovine blood, and actually
wishes to be rid of its curse. Among them is Rudolph (Rollo Weeks), a
309-year-old in the form of a 9-year-old who becomes Tony's pal. He also
enlists Tony's help to find a lost artifact that can help the vampires
regain their humanity -- provided nasty vampire-hunter Rookery (Jim
Carter) doesn't find it first and use it to destroy them.</P>
<P>     Based on a popular series of children's books, THE LITTLE VAMPIRE
comes complete with many of the standard set-ups of the family classics. 
Like the protagonists in E.T., THE IRON GIANT and A LITTLE PRINCESS, Tony
is an isolated only child looking for a friend who finds that friend in an
unexpected place. There are the expected scenes of Tony and his new
vampire buddy getting back at his tormentors, as well as plenty of shots
of the spiky-haired Lipnicki (who hasn't quite outgrown his cuteness yet) 
yelling "Wow!" and/or "Cool!" while being borne aloft by Rudolph. Jim
Carter, in his Tex Cobb-circa-RAISING ARIZONA wardrobe, makes for a good
nasty-comic villain, and the script (co-written by CHICKEN RUN and JAMES
AND THE GIANT PEACH scribe Karey Kirkpatrick) includes at least a few
clever lines like, "It's not easy for a father to hear, but your son is a
blood-sucking fiend." Much of it is silly, but there's also a dark side
that many of the better children's tales have always had.</P>
<P>     There's also a perplexing dose of questionable content. The entire
concept of vampirism could be troubling enough for some children, but THE
LITTLE VAMPIRE adds to it a strange sub-plot involving Rudolph's younger
sister Anna (Anna Popplewell) and her crush on Tony. You see, Anna is a
307-year-old in a 7-year-old's body, making her advances slightly more
sophisticated than giggles and goo-goo eyes. In fact, in one scene she
sits on Tony's bed and -- in her best Lauren Bacall come-hither tones --
asks Tony, "You know how to whistle, don't you?" Though it's likely to go
right over the heads of the very young, there's something icky about using
a lascivious pre-pubescent as a punch line -- even ickier than the giant
pasture patty dropped from the sky by a flying vampire cow during the
film's "Far Side"-meets-John Hughes climax.</P>
<P>     It's not terribly surprising to find THE LITTLE VAMPIRE straying from
the kid-friendly straight-and-narrow, considering it was directed by Uli
Edel, the man behind such innocent entertainments as LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN
and Madonna's 1993 sex stinker BODY OF EVIDENCE. Edel's pacing is fairly
sluggish for a children's film, and the rest of it is a bit too bland for
parents to get excited about. Yet there's still some fun adventure here,
and it's not all designed to get its viewers to buy action figures. It's
hard to know quite how enthusiastic to be about a family film that's
occasionally pitched at the wrong crowd, but at least isn't stupid or
actively offensive most of the time. And that, unfortunately, is a sad
statement on "family" filmmaking in 2000: Simple mediocrity is starting to
look pretty good.</P>
