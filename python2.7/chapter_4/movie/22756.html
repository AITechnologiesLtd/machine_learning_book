<P>THE HURRICANE (1999) *** Directed by Norman Jewison; written by 
Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, based on "The 16th Round" (1974)

Rosenberg. Music, Christopher Young. Produced by Bernstein, John 
Ketcham and Jewison. Cast: Denzel Washington (Rubin Carter), John

(John Artis), Rod Steiger (Federal Judge Sarokin). A Universal 
release. 146 minutes. R (physical and psychological violence)</P>
<P>Several sources list this movie as 125 minutes long. The theater I 
saw it in says  146, as does the site of its chain. I had intended to 
use my chronometer, but I was engrossed enough to forget doing this.</P>
<P>I am also somewhat baffled by the hullabaloo raised by "The 
Hurricane," about historical inexactitudes and omissions.  The movie 
falls in the genre of biopics. There's no more fanciful type than 
this, barring total fantasies like Hercules fighting the Incas. 
Biopics are notoriously manipulated, falsified, misleading and wrong. 
Think of films from great  (even prize-winning) to junky, about 
figures ranging from Attila to Zola   Napoleon, Zapata, Pasteur, 
Hitler, Lawrence of Arabia, Lord Nelson, Ferdinand de Lesseps, Queen 
Victoria, Buffalo Bill, Juarez, Mata Hari, Al Capone, Bonnie and 
Clyde, Hemingway and so on...</P>
<P>In fact, even with the best, most scholarly and historical 
intentions, the most faithful stories of a life have to have cuts, 
simplifications, amalgamations or condensations when they are turned 
into films.</P>
<P>The fact remains that the story of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter has 
been made into a very good, very moving, very well-acted, very 
well-produced movie. It follows the life of a black boy who is sent 
to reformatory for pulling a knife on a white, influential local who 
is a child molester. The kid spends years in that prison, eventually 
escapes, joins the Army, becomes its lightweight champion abroad, 
returns home, becomes a middleweight contender. Two men enter a New 
Jersey bar and gun down three people (white). Carter, then 29 is 
arrested along with his 21-year old admirer John Artis (black). They 
are falsely accused and sentenced to three consecutive life 
sentences. They spent 19 years in prison.</P>
<P>Claiming his innocence, Carter set to prove it from his cell. As 
played by the extraordinary Denzel Washington, he is a mixture of 
fascinating personalities that complement one another: the rebel, the 
good convict, the man in despair, the man who educates himself, the 
writer of his autobiography "The 16th Round" published in 1974 while 
he was still in jail. It is this book that comes to the attention of 
Lesra, a 15-year old African-American boy whom some Canadian 
activists and commune-dwellers in Toronto had rescued from a bad 
family environment and "adopted" so as to prepare him for high school.</P>
<P>Lesra's fascination for Rubin Carter communicates to his hosts. These 
are Sam, Terry and Lisa, the prettiest chain-smoker in film history. 
They dedicate themselves to proving Rubin innocent, and eventually 
succeed.</P>
<P>The film has superior photography, and acting by Washington and by 
Vicellous Reon Shannon (Lesra) who is already an experienced actor 
and who is in reality far older than what he seems to be. The choice 
of music is one of the best, including the song "Hurricane" by Bob 
Dylan. Dylan was one of the defenders of Rubin's, along with many 
other champions, celebrities and non-celebrities, but it would seem 
that it was only the Canadian friends who showed enough staying power 
to finish the job.</P>
<P>"The Hurricane" is a grab-your-heartstrings, moving motion picture, 
even a two-handkerchief work. Its director, Norman Jewison, is a 
Canadian and an old "liberal" (a nice word that has been made into a 
pox by the Right). His credits include themes of discrimination, "A 
Soldier's Story" (about a black army officer) and "In the Heat of the 
Night"(about a  black Philadelphia policeman in the South). He knows 
his subject.</P>
<P>"The Hurricane" is not without some inventions (over and above the 
omissions), such as a vengeful cop who is Rubin's nemesis the way 
Inspector Javert was to Jean Valjean in "Les Miserables." I will not 
detail them. They are for a good cause. They are also counterbalanced 
by some discreet touches, e.g. a prison guard who likes  Carter, 
probably believes him, yet shows it silently simply through 
photographic angles and close-ups.</P>
<P>I disregard, or at least don't get hot under the collar for,  several 
of the objections to the movie's historicity. But one aspect annoyed 
me: the fact that the three Canadians were unexplored characters. In 
reality there were several more people in the commune, here reduced 
to just three, the pro-Rubin activists. But eliminating the others 
leads to confusion. Are Terry, Lisa and Sam a menage a trois? Can one 
call three cohabitants a commune? What exactly did the micro-commune 
do besides taking in Lesra and fighting for Rubin?  (We are not told, 
either, that eventually Lisa and Rubin married, then divorced --but 
that could be justified as a personal fact that comes after Carter's 
liberation).</P>
<P>Lacunae, some distortions and all, the film is valid, involving and 
anti-racist.. Its flaws of omission and commission are characteristic 
of the arguments of true believers in causes, of  political 
movements, of schools of thought, where the activists draw blanket 
conclusions. Imperfect, but a fact of life.
