<P>     In one sense, the premise for LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! is sheer
brilliance.  Terrence McNally's screenplay (based on his Tony
Award-winning 1994 play) deals with eight friends -- all gay men -- who
gather for three long weekends one summer at a country house owned by
Gregory (Stephen Bogardus).  Arthur (John Benjamin Hickey) and Perry
(Stephen Spinella) are a couple celebrating 14 years together; John (John
Glover) is a misanthropic composer who has brought along his latest flame,
a dancer named Ramon (Randy Becker); Buzz (Jason Alexander) is a
flamboyant lover of show tunes.  The real inspiration comes not with the
characters, however, but with the setting.  By placing these characters in
a world of their own, without a single heterosexual character around to
define them by their "otherness," McNally allows us to focus on the
problems of these people as human beings.  In this place, they're just
ordinary folks.</P>
<P>     The thing about ordinary folks is that they're not always
particularly interesting.  As sensitively written and well-acted as it may
be, LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! is terribly short on conflict.  Whenever
McNally does try to insert some conflict, it feels forced and
inconsequential.  Gregory's partner Bobby (Justin Kirk) cheats on him, but
we never really understand why; there is a quarrel at the dinner table
which is resolved quickly and neatly with a round of apologies.  Some of
LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! is spiced up by the presence of most bare male
flesh ever seen in a movie not starring Harvey Keitel.  The rest of the
time, the characters sit around talking and supporting each other, waxing
philosophical about love, romance, social politics and mortality until the
film starts to feel very much like a gay BIG CHILL.  Whether that
comparison intrigues you or makes you cringe may go a long way toward
predicting your response to this film.</P>
<P>     The most affecting moments in LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! involve the
developing relationship between Buzz and John's twin brother James (also
played by John Glover), the two characters with AIDS.  Both actors give
solid, multi-faceted performances, bringing humor and delight to the
connection between two people who have assumed that it's too late for them
to experience love.  All of the emotion in the film feels genuine,
developed with care by a group of actors who, with the exception of
Alexander, originated the roles on Broadway.  It is a warm and appealing
piece of film-making by first-time feature director Joe Mantello (also an
alum of the stage production), but that warmth is not enough to make it
exceptional.  It's not really a narrative so much as it is an idyll, a
chance to watch normal people living normal lives in a pastoral setting.
Normalcy, however, is a better social goal than a dramatic device.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 idyll chatters:  6.</PRE>
