<P>Lawyers have a saying that goes something like this:  "The most
important thing you can do in a courtroom is show sincerity.  If you can
fake that, you've got it made."</P>
<P>Matt Damon stars in The Rainmaker as Rudy Baylor, a young, sincere,
idealistic lawyer fresh out of Memphis State Law School, entering the
cutthroat world of the legal profession.  He begins his career with a
golden opportunity:  a lawsuit filed by the Black family, who are
struggling with an evil, heartless insurance company for coverage of a
bone-marrow transplant for young Donny Ray Black.  The movie -- minus
some extraneous subplots -- is about how this inexperienced David
battles the mind-numbingly evil Goliath of health insurance.</P>
<P>The Rainmaker, adapted from the John Grisham novel, occupies a
black-and-white moral universe.  On one side, you have the brave family,
let by the gallant Donnie Ray, and represented by the young, sincere,
idealistic Baylor.  On the other side, you have the insurance company,
represented by a cadre of high-powered lawyers (led by Jon Voight).
Both the insurance company and the law firm occupy huge, well-appointed
office buildings, paid for by the poor, neglected policy holders who
spend good money on worthless health insurance.</P>
<P>The problem is that it's all a sham.  I don't care how much you hate
your HMO, but these conditions don't exist in the real world, they just
don't.  The Rainmaker has this problem:  its hero is a plaintiff's trial
attorney.  Attorneys -- especially plaintiff's personal injury lawyers
-- are not your standard heroes, they're much too flawed for that.  But
in order to make the hero likable, to make the audience root for him,
the script gives Damon all of the good moral qualities that there are,
and demonizes the opposition to the point of caricature and beyond.
Damon is good to his elderly landlord, his physically battered and
emotionally scarred girlfriend (Clare Danes), and sympathetic to his
clients.  But he's too good for his own good.</P>
<P>Damon has proven, with Good Will Hunting, that he's a fine actor, full
of passion and intensity.  Here, he's not given any opportunity to
shine:  his character is required to be sincere and polite, and that's
all.  There's no spark of energy in his performance:  he's singularly
listless.  The only clue that we get to what's going on in his head is
the voice-over narration, and even that's flat and dull.  Damon's not
bad in the movie -- he even gets the Southern accent down pat -- but
he's the victim of a one-dimensional screenplay.  I would have liked The
Rainmaker a whole lot better if Damon had been able to cut loose -- to
experiment with being bad and unethical and tempted by the Dark Side of
the law.</P>
<P>The other lawyers aren't much better.  Jon Voight is the lead trial
attorney for the evil insurance company -- which makes its money by
systematically denying every single claim on principle.  Voight is fine
as a sleazy, oily lawyer in the negotiation and discovery sequences, but
when he gets into the courtroom, he's as bad as he can be.  He foolishly
goads one of the jurors (Randy Travis) into attacking him during voir
dire.  He is harsh and angry to the grieving Mrs. Black (Mary Kay
Place).  He blusters and makes bad objections during the course of the
trial.  When the insurance company's CEO (Roy Scheider) makes a damaging
admission, he acts like someone has hit him in the solar plexus with the
butt end of a pool cue.  And finally, he delivers the worst closing
argument in the history of cinema film.  But he's not the worst lawyer
in the film:  Mickey Rourke, as Damon's sleazy employer, is a poorly
drawn cartoon of the worst lawyer stereotypes ever.</P>
<P>What saves The Rainmaker are two fine performances from veteran actor
Danny DeVito and veteran director Francis Ford Coppola.  DeVito supplies
the charming roguishness that Damon isn't allowed in this movie.  He
instructs the shocked Damon in the fine art of ambulance chasing, makes
sure that their battered office is swept for bugs, and generally applies
a counterpoint to the oppresive sense of decency and goodness that Damon
is forced into portraying.  When he spots a little kid with his arm in a
cast on the street, DeVito does the only thing he knows to do:  he hands
him his card just in case there's a possible lawsuit brewing.</P>
<P>Coppola really saves the day, though, by providing a pervasive sense of
presence.  The movie was shot on location in Memphis, and there was a
lot of careful thought that went into the places where the movie was
filmed and the casting of extras.  Rourke's combination law office and
honkytonk is a wonderful visual sight gag.  The down-at-the-heels houses
where Damon and the Black family live look like real people actually
live there.  The casting choices are excellent, too.  Mary Kay Place is
just right as as the beleaguered Dot Black.  Danny Glover has a couple
of nice moments as the trial judge.  The jury looks like a real jury,
the lawyers look like real lawyers, and Memphis looks like something
more than an anonymous concrete canyon.</P>
<P>Even the cars are just right.  There's a beat-up 50's vintage junker in
the back of the Black house where the father (who "ain't right") sits
and drinks.  Damon drives an equally junky hatchback filled with his
worldly possessions (it's a dead ringer for the one that I drove in law
school) -- and then moves up to an elderly blue Volvo.  (The opposition
lawyers drive sleek, German luxury cars -- another sign of their evil.)</P>
<P>The old adage in Hollywood used to be:  If you want to send a message,
call Western Union.  The Rainmaker is a "message movie", plain and
simple.  But if you're going to send a message, it might as well be on a
Hallmark card, right?  The Rainmaker is lucky to have actors like DeVito
and Damon, and especially lucky to have a director like Coppola, who
obviously cares enough to send his very best.  Unfortunately, it's not
quite good enough to save The Rainmaker from itself.</P>
