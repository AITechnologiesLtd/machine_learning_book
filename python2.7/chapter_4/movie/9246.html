<P>The Dalai Lama and his people were driven from their homeland by the 
Chinese more than 50 years ago. Over one million Tibetans were killed and 
6000 monasteries were destroyed.  Decades later, the Dalai Lama continues 
to lead in exile, trying to convince the Chinese government to allow his 
people to return home and live in peace and freedom. The story of these 
noble people deserves to be told, and Hollywood has decided that the best 
way to tell it is, of course, through the eyes of a white male movie star.</P>
<P>"Seven Years In Tibet" is the first of two movies about the Dalai Lama 
due this year. This one is loosely based on the memoirs by Heinrich 
Hammer, whose book proved so popular that it has remained constantly in 
print since its debut in 1953. Brad Pitt plays Hammer, a self-absorbed, 
foul-tempered Austrian who deserts his pregnant wife to go to India and 
climb the Himalayas. Hammer was a Nazi, a fact that is noted, but 
downplayed, in the movie. Conquering the Himalayas was an obsession with 
his people, a point of national pride. While recovering from their first 
failed attempt to scale the mountain, war is officially declared and 
Hammer's group is quickly arrested and tossed into a prison camp. There, 
Hammer receives a "Dear John" letter from his wife, who informs him that 
his son will be taught to view her new husband as his father. Between 
escape attempts, Hammer obsesses about his unseen son, composing letters 
to the child and anticipating a life with him after the war. Eventually, 
Hammer escapes with a group of fellow prisoners, ditches them, and heads 
for Tibet, reluctantly accompanied by Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis), 
a member of his original climbing party. 
Entry into Tibet by foreigners was illegal at the time, but the men bluff 
their way in, and end up entering the forbidden city Lhasa, the home of 
the Dalai Lama. The young leader is a curious child, using a telescope to 
peep at events outside his window. He spies Hammer, summons him to his 
home, and finally, the movie kicks into gear.</P>
<P>The portrait of the Dalai Lama and his people are what "Seven Years In 
Tibet" is really about. While Hammer's story is technically the focal 
point, it is the least interesting part of the film and also the most 
predictable. Think about it. The man is a ruthless, aloof Nazi. When his 
heart finally begins to thaw, he fixates on the son he has lost. Then he 
meets the Dalai Lama, a wide-eyed young boy. Any doubt where Hammer's 
story is headed? </P>
<P>To Brad Pitt's credit, he does all he can with the role. His accent is 
fine, as is his performance. But after the Dalai Lama enters the film, 
Hammer's personal travails fade into the background. His budding 
friendship with the Dalai Lama, however, provides the film's most 
glistening moments. Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk plays the Dalai Lamai for 
most of the film, and he is an exceptional young actor. His eyes light 
with the joy of a child, but when called to address his people, his voice 
resonates with a sense of wisdom that reinforces Tibetan belief that he 
is their reincarnated spiritual leader. There is a great deal of protocol 
involved in dealing with the Dalai Lama, but when the two are alone, 
decorum is discarded as the boy uses Hammer as his window on the world. 
The most engaging parts of the film involve the Dalai Lama's endless 
questions about everything from movies to the legend of Jack The Ripper. 
The interactions between Pitt and Wangchuk are credible and delightful. </P>
<P>When Mao takes power, one of his first acts is to "reunite" China. The 
Tibetans react by declaring their autonomy and, very respectfully, 
evicting all Chinese officials from their land. When war looms on the 
horizon, we witness the sad spectacle of a peace-loving people preparing 
to do battle. The tragic finale underscores the importance of the Tibetan 
people's valiant ongoing struggle.</P>
<P>At well over two hours, "Seven Years In Tibet" is too long. It takes an 
hour just to get Hammer to Lhasa, and the film would have been more 
effective if they had cut to the chase quicker. Regardless of its 
structural problems, however, the film is stately, beautiful to look at, 
and tells an important story. It's a shame that Hollywood felt compelled 
to tell it through the eyes of a white male movie star, but at least they 
told it.</P>
