<P>     Anyone who expects historical accuracy from a Disney animated  
feature should be ashamed of themselves.  Those approaching POCAHONTAS  
in anticipation of seeing a true-to-history account of the early days of  
Jamestown are in for a rude awakening.  In reality, Pocahontas was a 12- 
year old girl who never had a romance with John Smith (she later married  
John Rolfe, the man who brought tobacco to England).  Writers Binder,  
Grant, and LaZebnik have changed those details (and more) in an effort  
to create a story that appeals to both children and adults.  Taking  
advantage of the studio's breathtakingly intricate animation, directors  
Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg have breathed vitality into this, the  
fifth "new wave" Disney animated feature.  </P>
<P>     Despite some obvious similarities -- Menken's music, a heroine who  
doesn't want her father to choose her husband, and a small legion of  
animals -- POCAHONTAS is actually something of a departure from the  
recent batch of releases (A LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,  
ALADDIN, and THE LION KING).  This film isn't quite as cute; deals with  
some reasonably serious, "adult" issues; and contains an element of  
poignancy.  The cartoonish animal sidekicks, which include a raccoon, a  
hummingbird, and a pug, are amusing as ever, but this time around, they  
don't have voices (although Linda Hunt gives speech to the talkative  
Grandmother Willow).  </P>
<P>     Considering the less upbeat nature of the story, POCAHONTAS isn't  
as fun or energetic as its Disney predecessors.  The plot moves somewhat  
slowly, disdaining the frantic pace of THE LION KING.  The  
Menken/Schwartz musical production numbers are lively (and probably  
better than anything since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST), but their on-screen  
time represents less than a third of the movie's "action."    </P>
<P>     POCAHONTAS presents a fictionalized chronicle of the arrival of  
English settlers in Virginia.  Led by a greedy, bombastic governor  
(voiced by BEAUTY AND THE BEAST alum David Ogden Stiers) and Captain  
John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson), the explorers come in search of gold.   
They promptly begin cutting down trees, digging holes, and preparing to  
kill the Indians.  Meanwhile, a young native woman, Pocahontas (speaking  
voice of Irene Bedard, who was also the physical model for the  
character; singing voice of Judy Kuhn), observes the newcomers with a  
mixture of curiosity and trepidation.  Her father (voice of Native  
American activist/actor Russell Means), however, is certain that the  
white mens' landing means war.  The only hope to avert a pitched battle  
comes as a result of the developing romance between Smith and  
Pocahontas.  </P>
<P>     Several recognizable themes suffuse POCAHONTAS: the stupidity of  
wanton destruction, the need for tolerance between those of different  
races and cultures, and the forks in life's road offered by fate.  While  
none is presented with any special subtlety (after all, children are  
supposed to get the message), there is surprisingly little preaching.   
It would have been easy to turn this into a "Native American good/White  
Man bad" film, but positive and negative traits are shown on both sides.   
The governor will not go down in history as one of the great Disney  
villains.  He's more of a loud-mouthed boor than anything else -- not an  
evil-to-the-bone nasty like Jaffar or Ursula.  </P>
<P>     POCAHONTAS is going to make a ton of money, both on its nationwide  
opening weekend and in subsequent weeks.  Children everywhere will flock  
to see it, accompanied by adults who rightfully recognize Disney  
animated films as solid entertainment for the over-ten crowd.  The only  
question about this movie is whether, without the "happily-ever-after"  
ending, it will attract the repeat business of ALADDIN and THE LION  
KING.  Regardless of what the final box office tally says, however,  
Disney has come up with another winner.  </P>
