<P>Thus far, several reviews for "Any Given Sunday," Oliver Stone's fully 
charged ode to professional football, have stated that only those viewers who 
are fans of football will be able to enjoy it. Strange, then, that I think 
the exact opposite. Although I didn't like "Any Given Sunday" and I despise 
football, it is certainly one of the major pictures of its type that has a 
large chance to be enjoyed by several different sections of the adult 
population, whether they care for the sport or not. Stone does not dwell on 
the football-playing scenes and his rapid-fire editing is so quick that what 
is happening on the field is often nearly unintelligible. Taking a look at 
the politics that go on behind the lines, the picture is occasionally savvy 
and perceptive. But where it ultimately fails is in Stone's usual 
"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink" attitude. While this approach sometimes 
works to benefit one of his movies (1994's "Natural Born Killers"), it 
quickly grows tedious here, signaling not originality from the accomplished 
filmmaker, but clear pretentiousness.</P>
<P>A behind-the-scenes expose of a fictional team in the NFL, the Miami Sharks, 
Al Pacino headlines the marvelous, all-star cast as Tony D'Amato, the 
frustrated head coach of the team whose longtime career is beginning to 
crumble around him. For one, he is constantly disagreeing with the team's new 
manager, a determined young woman by the name of Christina Pagniacci (Cameron 
Diaz), who has recently acquired the team from her highly regarded father. 
Things fire up between the two when star quarterback Jack Rooney (Dennis 
Quaid) gets injured, and Christina wants him to be gotten rid of for good, 
and have talented hotshot rookie Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) take over. The 
Sharks are on a dismal losing streak and Christina, new to the profession, 
will stop at nothing to get positive results as the playoffs wind down, 
partially out of trying to please her deceased father, and also because she 
is quickly losing sight of the things that are most important in her life.</P>
<P>The no-holds-barred editing and cinematography, by Salvatore Totino, of "Any 
Given Sunday" wear out their welcome from the very first scene and the camera 
only intermittently stops long enough to capture a full scene. Striking and 
undoubtedly flashy, but also needlessly unnecessary, this style by Stone 
occasionally holds a purpose in his other films, but here, is only used to 
cover up what is basically a highly cliched and predictable sports movie. A 
170-minute epic that could have been 120 minutes, the story is very thin, and 
there are so many characters that are so pointless to the story, they could 
easily have been cut completely out. Then there are other characters that do 
hold some sort of purpose, but screenwriters John Logan and Oliver Stone 
don't even appear to be making any attempt to develop and flesh them out, and 
their subplots are entirely dropped in midstream, not to be brought up again. </P>
<P>Consequently, the climactic big game is just about as conventional as they 
come, albeit with razzle-dazzle editing that makes each quarter of the game 
go by in two minutes each. If anything, those who aren't football fanatics 
can take ease in knowing Stone does not meddle on the actual game, much more 
preferring to center on what goes on after the action on the field is over. 
Entirely predictable from start to conclusion, only the final scene during 
the end credits divulges a surprising plot development.</P>
<P>If severely flawed on many levels (this is one of Oliver Stone's weakest 
films), the performances are the glue that keeps everything from fully 
self-destructing. Al Pacino is superior here than in the role he is currently 
getting more attention for, in Michael Mann's "The Insider," as he isn't 
playing a character quite as much like his usual persona. </P>
<P>Proving why I now firmly believe she is one of the most intelligent and 
talented actresses in their twenties, Cameron Diaz more than holds her own 
with Pacino in several head-on verbal battles with each other. As Christina 
Pagniacci, she is the type of woman who knows what she wants, but is still a 
little naive in her decisions, and it is the one character with an effective 
emotional arc. Diaz could have come off as a one-dimensional witch with a 
capital "B," but unlike the other throwaway roles, her's is the one that is 
most carefully handled.</P>
<P>In two wasted supporting turns, Lela Rochon and Elizabeth Berkley add 
much-needed flare and a human element into the story, as Willie's neglected 
girlfriend and a high-priced hooker that spends a night with Tony, 
respectively. Rochon is so likable and her character so nicely defined (under 
the circumstances) that it is a shame nothing more is done with her. Berkley, 
who has come a long way in her acting skills since her starring role in 
1995's "Showgirls," is wonderfully charismatic and surprisingly involving, 
even in only two scenes. </P>
<P>All other actors are top-notch, as well, but sadly, are not given anything 
notable to do. Aaron Eckhart, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Matthew Modine, 
Lauren Holly, Charlton Heston, even LL Cool J--they are all fine thespians 
who perform their roles just about as well as could possibly be expected, but 
are mostly headscratchers in the writing department. </P>
<P>"Any Given Sunday" is a fast-paced, entertaining drama that, 
little-by-little, grows problematic when you stop to think long enough about 
its specifics. Stone is an innovative director most of the time, but has hit 
a brick wall with his latest picture, trying to cover up its flaws with 
personal technical expertise and forgetting about the substance part of the 
equation. The problem is, the flash-cutting style of a Jerry Bruckheimer 
production (such as 1998's "Armageddon" and 1997's "Con Air") is something I 
have no patience for, and is especially distressing when you realize someone 
as intelligent in his craft as Stone has resorted to such desperate 
gimmickry. </P>
