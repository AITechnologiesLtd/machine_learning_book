<PRE>                           INVENTING THE ABBOTTS
                       A film review by Walter Frith
                        Copyright 1997 Walter Frith</PRE>
<P>A small town in Illinois in 1957 is the setting for the opening of 'Inventing
the Abbotts', a film about relationships that plays out more like a series of
home movies and family photographs rather than as a full length motion
picture.  Three young women from a wealthy family (Liv Tyler, Jennifer
Connelly and Joanna Going) examine their lives and make decisions about life
at home, careers, raising children and examing their own morals. They are
swept up in their tasks by two brothers (Joaquin Phoenix and Billy Crudup)
who desire to escape from their borderline poverty stricken lives to perhaps
marry into the wealthy family while providing love and companionship to their
widowed mother played by Kathy Baker ('Picket Fences').  </P>
<P>Will Patton is the head of the town's wealthy family who is strict in his
convictions about the future of his daughters.  At first one daughter, played
by Going, marries a wealthy young man at the insistence of her parents and
later has a child by him and ends up in an unhappy marriage.  Another
daughter (Connelly) who is the family tramp has a romantic fling with Crudup
while both brothers desire her.  Lastly, the nicest and most down to earth
daughter (Tyler) has a passion for Phoenix and thier relationship is the
centre of the film's focus and conflicts arise on all sides throughout the
course of the film.</P>
<P>"Bland" is the word to describe this slow moving and often lazy film which
has terrible performances from its leads (Tyler and Phoenix) and is a film
which never gets off the ground and offers no twists or surprises in its plot
to take it to another level.  The film spans its way well into the 1960's and
the characters are virtually the same at the end of the movie as they were at
the beginning with a predictable outcome as well.  Director Pat O'Connor has
no zest for filmmaking and his interpretation of boy meets girl, boy loses
girl and boy gets girl back is a tiresome one at best.  'Inventing the
Abbotts' is a disappointing slice of American life from an era in history
that many considered America's finest.  Too bad this movie doesn't live up to
the same expectations. </P>
