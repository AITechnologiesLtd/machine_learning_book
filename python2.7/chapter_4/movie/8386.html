<P>     Watch out for that theme!  George, George, George of the Jungle
will play in your head for a *week* after watching this agreeable
adaptation of Jay Ward's classic 'toon.  Brendan Fraiser (ENCINO MAN,
AIRHEADS) is a dead-on delight as the butt-flapped tree knocker.  I
can't recall a comic performance this...  rich since Eddie Murphy's
nutty professor.  He's backed by a surprisingly spry supporting cast:
Anne Heche lookalike Leslie Mann as that funny-looking fella Ursula
(envisioned here as an heiress on safari), Thomas Haden Church as her
finicky fiancee, Keith Scott as the wisecracking narrator ("Meanwhile,
at a very big and expensive waterfall set"), and John Cleese as the
voice of George's tree house companion, a hyper-intelligent ape named
Ape.  Oh, and Richard Roundtree also appears as an African trail guide,
though I believe even *he* has more screen time than the woefully under-
utilized Cleese.  (Ape *does* get his due in the film's final scene,
however, which may be the wackiest bit in the entire movie.) Director
Sam Weisman (BYE BYE, LOVE, D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS) has the tone down pat,
but his pacing leaves a lot to be desired.  That GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE
isn't frantic through and through is probably a good thing for the
smaller kids in the audience.  And their slower-witted parents.</P>
