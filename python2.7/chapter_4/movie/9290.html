<P>Seen by myself at the Glenwood Movieplex Cinemas in Oneida, NY at 7 p.m., Oct.
7, 1997 for free (free pass).</P>
<P>There's nothing more satisfying than a good, old-fashioned mystery story done
right. The last few years have seen a slew of Hollywood thrillers that are
nice to look at, but don't always stimulate your mind because of their
confusing storylines and plots. "L.A. Confidential" may be just as complex and
confusing as other mass-market thrillers, but what makes this film superior is
the sense of depth it has to all its elements.</P>
<P>All filmmakers should know that a hierarchy exists in storytelling. The most
general elements must be defined in order for specifics (i.e. plot detail,
characterization, etc.) to work. This film starts off well by defining its
setting - early 1950s Los Angeles. As Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito), the editor
for a Hollywood tabloid, narrates, we get a real sense of the time and
location, where Hollywood is  booming  but so is organized crime. This might
seem like a cliche setup, but the storytelling is very intriguing and
authentic. </P>
<P>The story focuses on the men of the L.A.P.D. and their struggle to fight
crime as individuals, but not necessarily as a team. Why there's such a
division in the force we don't know, but it's almost irrelevant because of the
great characterization and how it works with the plot.</P>
<P>First there's Sgt. Bud White (Crowe), a Dirty Harry-like cop who doesn't play
by the rules, but is likable. There's also Lt. Ed Exley (Pearce), who looks
and acts like Clark Kent, and it's no surprise he's the only cop that believes
in following procedure. Then there's Det. Jack Vincennes (Spacey), a primma
dona  who serves as a technical advisor to a "Dragnet"-like TV show and only
likes to handle cases which give him publicity. Finally there's the old Irish
captain, Dudley Smith (Cromwell), who has that stern, wise look and runs his
force with cold authority. All four deliver powerful performances, especially
considering how different the characters are, and still manage to keep
everything in synch.</P>
<P>An incident involving a jailhouse rumble between the cops and inmates causes
the division among the precinct to split further. And just when it seems like
the force will tear itself apart, a multiple homicide involving a recently
discharged officer brings everyone together in their efforts to solve the
case. From this point on, the film becomes a fascinating, multi-layered
mystery and still manages to be a gripping drama between a handful of
characters.</P>
<P>It would be difficult to explain the numerous, overlapping storylines that
occur throughout the picture. In fact, I couldn't follow all of them, yet I
was never frustrated at the confusion. It is the way in which the characters
go about solving the case that is so interesting. Here we get actual, manual
detective work which is fascinating. You don't see these kind of details in
modern police films because everything is done by computer. These characters
are sympathetic, and as they try to put pieces together, it's as if we're
their invisible partners. One step leads to another and just as the case is
solved (or seems to be solved), it's broken wide open.</P>
<P>It's clear the film was based on a novel, but the screenplay adaptation
doesn't have the rigid storytelling a film based on such a complex novel would
usually have. Most Hollywood screenwriters just drop in random clues, facts,
and details, but here you can tell the writers have kept everything relative.
There are so many shortcuts the film could have taken, but it never does and
that's why it works so well.</P>
<P>The only problem with the film is that it becomes slightly melodramatic
regarding the character's personal lives. I also feel there's too many double
crosses, but they do keep with the story. The ending is probably more violent
than necessary but it does give a sense of justice.</P>
<P>I'm not usually a fan of complicated movies, but "L.A. Confidential" has such
a great sense of charm you can't help but get caught up in the excitement and
mystery of it all. The ending is certainly surprising, but it makes complete
sense and proves how intelligent the film is. It's nice to watch a movie
without feeling as if you're being talked down to.</P>
