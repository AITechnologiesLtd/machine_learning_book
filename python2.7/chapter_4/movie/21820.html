<PRE>Sleepy Hollow Review</PRE>
<P>  In the past, Tim Burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed
Batman, and the hilarious Ed Wood, but lately his films just don't cut it.
Sleepy Hollow has some unique features, but the script is a terrible mess.
  For those who remember Disney's fantastic "Adventures Of Ichabod Crane", it
is actually superior to this. Disney's version was at least interesting, while
Burton's film drags on far too long, without any suspense or frights. While the
stories are similar, the new version adds too much to the once likable story,
and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is
now apparently a constable, who was sent to New York to investigate suspicious
murders. The victims are headless, and no traces of evidence were found, until
the murderer reveals himself, hence the headless horseman. Now with the help of
Christina Ricci and an orphaned boy, they must stop the headless horseman from
a killing spree, that could destroy the whole town of Sleepy Hollow.
  Sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character, but the story has so
many holes that even he nor Depp can save this disaster. In the original, the
headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable. No one could stop him, not even
Ichabod. By the end of the film, it had audiences in deep thought. Burton
however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere, and how to make the main
characters heroes. He takes no risk what so ever, and this is where he fails.
  Another pathetic element of the film was the script. Like I said earlier, he
just stuffed too much in at one time, and made it look real sloppy, kind of
like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims. He completely
butchered the story to pieces.
  Thankfully there are a few factors that I particularly liked. The acting by
Depp was quite notable. He took the nerdy character of the cartoon, and simply
acted it out in a better manner. If it wasn't for his quirky one-liners, I
doubt I could have remained awake, because quite frankly I was getting sleepy.
Just when I thought Christina Ricci was getting to be a good actress, she winds
up doing this. It just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big
blockbuster. It's too tempting to let go, even if the script is mush. The
atmosphere too was quite involving. I should have just gazed at the sets, and
the eerie fog, rather than actually pay attention to what was going on. At
least Burton's films are eye candy, even if they are trash.
  The only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads, and the fight
between the horseman, Depp and Casper Van Dien. Other than that, I wish I could
just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film, and just sit back
and stare at the scenery.
  By the end, I can only think back and laugh at how bad Sleepy Hollow
developed. This is the biggest disappointment of the year, especially when such
a talented director like Burton handles a project like this. Don't waste your
time or money, because your head will feel hollow.
