<P>   Although chocolate is a high-calorie food, health honchos
have discovered that it has benefits aside from its heavenly
taste.  Chocolate releases hormones that affect our mood
and our feelings of love--but then we guys who have been
giving boxes of the stuff to our women friends along with the
flowers always knew that.  Chocolate in moderate quantities
has been found not to elevate cholesterol and some
researchers even believe that it has anti-carcinogenic
properties.  No wonder, then, that this enchanted confection
can change the attitudes of an entire town, as we see in a
wonderfully atmospheric, exquisitely paced fable called
"Chocolat."  Though the principal performer is French and all
action takes place in an isolated French village, the dialogue
is English--which should be a selling point for the ninety-nine
percent of American moviegoers who seem to eschew any
film that requires the reading of subtitles.</P>
<P>  As Roger Pratt's camera brings us to another world, the
fictional village of Lansquenet that would be the delight of
tourists but would bore the breeches off any urban traveler in
two days, we wonder whether we are in the year 1363 rather
than the actual time of the setting eighteen years after World
War II.  The cobblestone streets that embrace the shadow of
the town's single church form the pavement for a group of
citizens who appear alike in their beliefs but whose
experiences run the gamut from a crotchety grandmother to
an abused wife to an uptight mayor and a sex-starved
matron.  </P>
<P>   As the entire hamlet pays homage to God on one blustery
Sunday, in walks unwed mother Vianne Rocher (Juliette
Binoche) together with her young daughter, Anouk (Victoire
Thivisol).  She is introduced to us as a wanderer whose
agenda may be more than the mere opening of a chocolate
shop.  Renting a storefront from the grouchy old Armande
Voizin (Judi Dench), she tries to coax the townspeople into
patronage by offering free samples of her wares, but those
not biting include the reactionary mayor, the Comte de
Reynaud (Alfred Molina)--whose ancestor once chased the
"radical" Huguenots out of the town and whose statue frowns
down on the citizenry--and Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin),
who is more interested in shoplifting a small box of goodies
than in honest patronage.</P>
<P>  Though the mayor, allied with the reluctant priest
Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor), urge a boycott of the store since
it has opened during the Lenten season, most of the folks
cannot resist taking in the aromas of the divine food.  Vianne
even wins over the kleptomaniac Josephine, who has been
abused by her boorish husband Serge (Peter Stormare), and
becomes an assistant in the shop regularly turning out Venus
Nipples and an array of confections that would make New
York's Godiva fans drool.  When Vianne--whose refuses to go
to church like the rest of the town--begins hanging out with
the knavish Irish gypsy Roux (Johnny Depp), the lines are
firmly drawn.  Townspeople like up behind their mayor in
favor of ridding the hamlet of both Vianne and the gypsy
band, while others like Josephine and the newly cheerful
grandmother, ally themselves with the newcomer.</P>
<P>   Lasse Hallstrom's film, based on an adaptation of Joanne
Harris's novel by Robert Nelson Jacobs, shares a motif with
Gary Ross's "Pleasantville" (a brother and sister infiltrate a
narrow-minded environs with their cosmopolitan sensibilities),
with "Gabriel Axel's "Babette's Feast" (about people using
religion as a substitute for life who are at least temporarily
converted to worldliness via a gourmet dinner), and with 
Stanley Tucci's "Big Night" (immigrants trying to survive as
restaurateurs against the competition of an established food
emporium).  "Chocolat," which is as light and fluffy as a
bonbon, does not quite support the weight of its message--
that people everywhere must learn to tolerate those who are
different from them--though the picture does most adequately
convey the notion that we should all lighten up.  One movie
buff in effect mentions on an Internet site that the religious
townspeople are made to look like ignorant hillbillies while the
agnostic, nature-worshipping Vianne is the bearer of truth:
that the film condescends, taking sides with the sophisticated
wanderer who seems to need no money (she hands out more
samples than she sells).  This criticism has merit, just as
does the similar point made about "Pleasantville."  On the
whole, "Chocolat" must be accepted as a fairy tale, beckoning
the audience to suspend disbelief and to go with the central
idea that conventional views ought to be challenged, that
change is the nature of things, that life is not a dress
rehearsal.  "Chocolat" is a lovely, atmosphere-rich tale, a
heartfelt, Capra-esque fable well suited to the coming holiday
season.</P>
