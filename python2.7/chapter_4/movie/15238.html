<PRE>The Siege
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1998 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>** (Out of ****)</PRE>
<P>There's a siege mentality in the United States today. The federal government
believes that militia groups are dedicated to bringing it down. The militia is
convinced that Washington is a threat to their lives and freedom. Liberals see
a rapid erosion of the Bill Of Rights under the guise of law and order.</P>
<PRE>They're all probably right.</PRE>
<P>FBI agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) is under attack from all sides.
Terrorists are blowing up New York. Hardened CIA operative Elise Kraft
(Annette Bening) is attempting to take away his case. The US Army is invading
the city. It's not a good day for our hero.</P>
<P>As the film opens, an unidentified US agency abducts Sheik Ahmed Bin Talal,
the suspected head of a Palestinian terrorist organization. Soon bombs start
going off in New York. Hubbard is called in to deal with the situation but
butts heads with Kraft who has a hidden private agenda.</P>
<P>When the situation worsens, the President invokes the War Powers Act, declares
martial law and sends in the Army to occupy Brooklyn. Although General William
Devereaux (Bruce Willis) argues against the decision ("The Army is a
broadsword, not a scalpel. You don't want us in an American city."), when the
tanks roll across the Brooklyn Bridge, he's gung-ho.</P>
<P>All Arab men are rounded up and imprisoned in internment camps much like
Japanese-Americans were during World War II. Military vehicles patrol the city
streets. In order to prevent the terrorists from killing innocent people, the
Army moves in and kills innocent people.</P>
<P>Washington turns in his usual excellent job as the admirable yet all-business
G-Man. Bening's character is enticing but remains something of a mystery
throughout the film. Willis is adequate although his role is a minor one. Tony
Shalhoub as Hubbard's Arab-American partner is a stand-out and provides the
brief touches of humanity and humor in the story.</P>
<P>Based on the previews, you might expect the movie to be either an intelligent
examination of the dangers of military involvement in internal matters or a
Bruce Willis action film. It is neither.</P>
<P>What could be an opportunity to examine the tricky issues of individual
freedoms versus law enforcement is missed when director Edward Zwick ("Glory",
"Courage Under Fire") plays it safe.</P>
<P>Which liberties are worth giving up in order to feel safe? In the real world,
is the Department Of Justice's wish list for new powers as dangerous as it
sounds? (They succeeded in allowing "roving" wiretaps.) Hubbard's assertion
that the terrorists have won if "we throw out the Constitution" is a powerful
statement but the film only gives us easy answers.</P>
<P>There are a few impressive dramatic scenes, but they don't hold the film
together as either a shoot-em-up or a thoughtful suspense tale. The fight
between the CIA, FBI and Army for control shows some promise but doesn't go
much further than the simplistic. The story seems incomplete: there are too
many loose ends unresolved. You'll leave wanting the rest of the story.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for well over 23 years and sometimes
believes that he is under siege by just about everyone. Email your paranoias
