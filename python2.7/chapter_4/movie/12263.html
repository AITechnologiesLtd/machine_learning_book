<P>     Writer/director Spike Lee is known to be a huge basketball fan (to 
be specific, a New York Knicks fan).  Consequently, HE GOT GAME has been 
described as "Lee's basketball film."  Such a label is misleading.  Like 
the 1994 documentary, HOOP DREAMS, the basketball court is only an arena 
for a larger, deeper drama.  HOOSIERS is a basketball movie; HE GOT GAME 
is a story about life, relationships, and the pressures of fame.  Those 
in search of a film that ends with a championship match-up will be 
disappointed -- HE GOT GAME's only court action takes place in 
playgrounds and on the street.</P>
<P>     HE GOT GAME is ambitious in that it tells not one story, but two.  
In addition to exploring the fractured relationship between a father and 
son, Lee examines the ins-and-outs of the recruiting process, whereby 
under-the-table cash handouts and covert offers have become run-of-the-
mill.  In the world of "amateur" sports, the role of the actual game has 
been diminished; it's all about greed and pressure.  The focus in HE GOT 
GAME is on what transpires behind-the-scenes, not in front of the 
television cameras.</P>
<P>     The story opens with Jake Shuttleworth (Denzel Washington) serving 
a lengthy sentence in Attica for killing his wife.  Meanwhile, on the 
outside, his son, Jesus (Ray Allen), has become the top-rated high 
school basketball player in the country, and is being recruited by every 
major college.  In the words of one expert, he's "the best thing to 
happen to the game since the tennis shoe was invented."  The warden of 
Attica (Ned Beatty) comes to Jake with a deal:  convince Jesus to go to 
the governor's alma mater, Big State, and Jake's sentence will be 
reduced or commuted.  To allow Jake to make contact with his son, he is 
given one week of freedom.  There's a problem, though -- Jesus doesn't 
want to have anything to do with his father, and Jake's increasingly 
desperate attempts at a reconciliation run into a brick wall.</P>
<P>     The dynamic between Jake and Jesus is both believable and poignant, 
and it reminded me a little of the relationship at the core of IN THE 
NAME OF THE FATHER, where two emotional strangers come to understand 
each other.  The effectiveness of these scenes is due in large part to 
the always-reliable Denzel Washington, who successfully displays both 
sides of Jake -- the earnest, loving father and the man who ruthlessly 
pushed his son to succeed and accidentally killed his wife.  As Jesus, 
NBA player Ray Allen gives a less-convincing performance.  While he 
arguably does the best acting job of any basketball player to appear in 
a movie, there are times when Allen isn't the equal of the material.  
For example, note his stilted delivery during a conversation between 
Jesus and his sister, Mary (Zelda Harris), early in the film.</P>
<P>     The other aspect of HE GOT GAME is the high-pressure salesmanship 
designed to encourage Jesus to sign a letter of intent with a college or 
to hire an agent and go pro.  While there's something vaguely comical 
about many of these scenes, Lee conveys the strain that highly-touted, 
young athletes are under.  With surreptitious cash payments and all 
sorts of perks so readily available, it's understandable why some high-
schoolers make the choices and mistakes that they do.  In its depiction 
of this side of the sports business, HE GOT GAME makes an effective 
companion piece to HOOP DREAMS and BLUE CHIPS (which explored college 
recruiting from the coach's perspective).</P>
<P>     Beyond Washington and Allen, Lee has populated the film with a 
number of credible supporting performers.  Zelda Harris (the lead in 
CROOKLYN) is delightful as Jesus' little sister.  Rosario Dawson is 
convincing as Lala, Jesus' sexy girlfriend.  Bill Nunn and Hill Harper 
provide comic relief as Jesus' uncle and cousin, respectively.  And 
Milla Jovovich, best known for her work in THE FIFTH ELEMENT, is 
surprisingly sympathetic as a down-on-her-luck prostitute who connects 
with Jake during his week out of prison.  There are cameos from the 
likes of Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, 
John Thompson, and Reggie Miller.</P>
<P>     Stylistically, HE GOT GAME is uneven.  From time-to-time, Lee and 
cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed employ certain camera tricks (much 
as they did in CLOCKERS), including warping the image and switching film 
stocks.  The intention is to draw the viewer deeper into the characters' 
psyches.  However, instead of pulling me in, this approach distanced me 
from the scene, making me aware that I was watching a movie.  I have 
never been overly fond of such "Oliver Stone-type" flourishes.  </P>
<P>     Ultimately, the material that comprises HE GOT GAME, while 
compelling and emotionally-satisfying, is not especially original.  In 
fact, this is essentially a familiar story told with consummate skill.  
While the father/son reunion gives the film its emotional core, the 
basketball recruiting sequences provide a cynical edge.  Narratively, 
however, HE GOT GAME is hurt by a contrived setup and a hokey, overly-
sentimental final scene. It's the stuff in between that makes this a 
worthwhile experience, which it surely is.</P>
