<P>   We all know that Broadway does not produce new musicals
as it used to.  Gone forever are the delights of Rogers and
Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, E.Y. Harburg, Hugh Martin
and Ralph Blane.  Forget the classic dignity of Cole Porter's
caustic wit, the mellifluous tunes of Irving Berlin and the
songs and lyrics of the Gershwin Brothers.  The work of the
latter group is produced mostly in intimate cabaret rather than
on the stage, but now Kenneth Branagh has found a way to
attempt new life and meaning for the songs and to the
dances made famous by Fred Astaire on the ballroom floor
and Busby Berkeley's choreographed water ballets.  The
premise is an intriguing one: fit the music, however
Procrustean one must be, into the compressed stanzas of
one of Shakespeare's lightest and most insipid comedies,
"Love's Labour's Lost."  By doing this, Branagh hopes to
honor some of the greats of the American musical theater
and film while rekindling interest in a Shakespearean
burlesque that's rarely required reading in any college.  </P>
<P>   The exertion is mostly for naught, principally because the
delightful music and dance are contrivances, shoehorned into
the mostly unfunny vaudevillian sketches whenever the
slightest excuse presents itself.  The filmmaker's choice of
"Love's Labour's Lost" is an unfortunate one not because the
caper is one of the Bard's weakest but because the simplistic
rhyme schemes that inhabit songs like "There's No Business
Like Show Business" and "Cheek to Cheek" do not mesh with
the metaphoric convolutions of Shakespeare's rhyming
patterns.  When we hear lyrics from the 1930's, we yearn for
more of the same but are hit with the poetic layout in
Shakespeare's play droned mostly by a crew of American
actors whose voices bear little music, we are frustrated. 
Alicia Silverstone, who shoulders a Sean-Connery-style lisp
which might be attractive to a teen audience for "Clueless"
simply ravages the feeling of magic that Branagh relies on
calling up.</P>
<P>   This is an update to the 1930's of a Shakespearean
comedy of love in which four nobles from Navarre vow to give
up women for three years in order to devote their lives to the
study of philosophy.  To answer online critic Ian Waldron-
Mantgani's query about the purpose of the contract we need
look only at the opening lines of the play: "Our late edict shall
strongly stand in force/ Navarre shall be the wonder of the
world;/  Our court shall be a little Academe,/ Still and
contemplative in living art."  Thus exclaims the King of
Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) to his best pals Biron (Kenneth
Branagh), Longaville (Matthew Lillard) and Dumain (Adrian
Lester) "You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,/ Have
sworn for three years' term to live with me/ My fellow
scholars, and to keep those statutes/ That are recorded in
this schedule here."  </P>
<P>   The oaths are soon forgotten as a quartet of maidens
paddle into town, namely the French princess (Alicia
Silverstone) and her friends Rosaline (Natascha McElhone),
Maria (Carmen Ejogo) and Katherine (Emily Mortimer).  A
good deal of the comedy comes from the manner in which
each gentleman in turn breaks his pact, hoping to get away
with his courtship outside the vision of the others.  In the
movie's most creative scene, which takes place in the
institutions' library, each character in turn joyfully concedes
his bliss unaware that the others are eavsdropping. The
choreographed staging involves Fred Astaire-like climbing on
chairs, tilting them gracefully over by pressing the left leg
against the arm, and emerging without a pratfall on the floor
below.</P>
<P>   The goofy side characters are the most unfortunate
segment on screen, as each tries to out high-camp the other
but succeeds only in embarrassing himself and presumably a
fidgety audience.  Nathan Lane, so adept on the stage of
New York's Manhattan Theatre Club and in films like "The
Bird Cage," looks like little more than a babbling cretin while
the pudgy Timothy Spall is merely obnoxious as the ribbon-
bedecked Spanish nobleman crawling about the floor for no
seeming purpose and bullying his Sancho-Panza-like cohort,
Moth.</P>
<P>   Given better casting, a longer dance rehearsal period than
the three weeks purportedly allotted (only Adrian Lester's
"Dumaine" comports himself credibly as a hoofer), and
perhaps a scrapping of "Love's Labour's Lost" in favor of a
95-minute collage of the songs and dances of the thirties, this
picture might have been saved.  </P>
<P>Rated PG.  Running time: 93 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
