<PRE>                           THE BORROWERS 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon
                    2 :-) :-)  for the little people</PRE>
<P>Cast: John Goodman, Jim Broadbent, Mark Williams, Hugh Laurie, Bradley
Pierce, Celia Imire, Flora Newbigin, Tom Felton, Raymond Pickard
Director: Peter Hewitt
Screenplay: Gavin Scott and John Kamps based on the books by Mary Norton</P>
<P>Having seen the Mary Norton books in the library as a child, I had
always thought they were called ‘The Burrowers' - as in people who
tunnel holes in the ground and not THE BORROWERS - as in I would like to
borrow your pen. So I was pleasantly surprised (forgive my ignorance),
that this movie was more than just about little people living like
rabbits underground, but about little people surviving in a world of
giants (humans).</P>
<P>Numerous comparisons can be made with this movie. One of which would be
MOUSE HUNT, in which there is almost an identical scene of a pest
control freak trying to exterminate, in this instance, tiny children. I
absolutely detested MOUSE HUNT for its mindless, commercialism. However,
I feel that THE BURROWERS has a little more to offer than, ‘This is a
mouse, this is a house, and this is about the level of my IQ.' In this
instance we have more than mere running about, blowing things up and
brainless tomfoolery. Ocious P. Potter (John Goodman) is trying to tear
down the house belonging to the Lenders, in which the Borrower Clock
family live. Unless the family will is found they will be made homeless.</P>
<P>Other comparisons can also be made to THE LAND OF THE GIANTS. There is a
wonderful opening scene, where the Borrowers are exploring the Lender's
kitchen, using tiny mountain climbing equipment made of paper clips,
thread etc. The initial feel of the two shows is much the same, except
the sets and special effects are far superior here and this is a comedy,
not a drama. The final scene is reminiscent of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS. If
you think that these little people can be easily squished under your
boot, then think again when they bring a giant down.</P>
<P>I think this is quite a fun movie for the family. Adults who have read
the Mary Norton books will probably relive memories of their childhood,
whilst a new generation be introduced to THE BORROWERS. However, sadly,
I believe these books are no longer in print.</P>
