<PRE>                              NURSE BETTY
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     Neil LaBute, best known for his ultra-dark comedies In the Company
of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, breaks from his traditional mold
and lightens up a tad with Nurse Betty, which -- again -- isn't going to
win any awards for sensitivity.</P>
<P>     For the first time, LaBute is not directing from his own script,
which might explain why, if I didn't know better, I would have sworn I
was watching a Coen brothers movie.  Who else would put a fantasy
dancing sequence on the edge of the Grand Canyon at night?</P>
<P>     The new Neil LaBute, that's who.  But lest you think you're getting
a kinder, gentler Neil, rest assured that Nurse Betty is really quite
gruesome in its depiction of the human soul as essentially empty. 
There's even a scalping thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>     Nurse Betty, played by Renée Zellweger, is actually a small-town
Kansas waitress trapped in a loveless marriage to the local car dealer
(Aaron Eckhart).  Betty has one passion in life: The soap opera A Reason
to Love, starring George McCord (Greg Kinnear) as famous heart surgeon
Dr. David Ravell.  When Betty's husband gets mixed up in a drug deal
gone wrong, Betty witnesses his gruesome demise and mentally breaks
down.  Poof!  She's convinced David Ravell is a real person, and she is
his long-lost love.</P>
<P>     If this sounds like a premise from a sitcom, that's because it is
-- Brooke Shields played the Betty role against Matt LeBlanc's soap doc
in a recent episode of Friends.  But the similarities end there.  Nurse
Betty quickly becomes an epic farce, with Betty (now convinced she is a
nurse) trekking to L.A. in one of her husband's Buicks... and little
does she know there's a load of heroin in the trunk.</P>
<P>     Undoubtedly the best part of the film is the team of Morgan Freeman
and Chris Rock playing a father-son hit squad out to recover the drugs. 
Freeman plays the straight man to Rock's acerbic son who wants nothing
more than to get their cross-country road trip in search of Betty over
with.  All the while, Freeman owns his scenes by trying to play Columbo
and read Betty's mind while staring at a photograph of her.  These guys
are simply unstoppable when they're on the screen.</P>
<P>     So is Miss Zellweger, after this and My, Myself & Irene, going to
make a living out of playing half-deranged nuts?  With Bridget Jones'
Diary in the works, it certainly looks like it.  Zellweger is in fine
form here, even if Freeman and Rock steal the show.</P>
<P>     Nurse Betty isn't LaBute's masterpiece, but it's definitely a
solid, funny, and unique film, the likes of which you won't see again
this year.  If your tastes run to the truly eccentric, this should tide
you over until the real Coen brothers movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou?,
comes out later this year.</P>
