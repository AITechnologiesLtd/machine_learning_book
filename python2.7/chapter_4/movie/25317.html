<P>Now that the 20th century is finally over, I guess it's time to start
re-interpreting it.  Hopefully, summarizers of the century will follow
the example of Hungarian director Istvan Svabo and honestly face the
truth, no matter how painful.  (Unfortunately, many intellectuals don't
always seem interested in the truth --- especially about subjects like
communism, which many continue to embrace.)</P>
<P>In Sunshine, Svabo looks back through the last 100 years of his
country's history for meaning, and finds some --- enough to fill a
three-hour, soapy epic about the century's chaos.  The film mostly
works, and is a worthy addition to Svabo's art.</P>
<P>Sunshine begins at the end of the 19th century, focusing on three young
people who take Hungarian surnames and abandon the traditions espoused
by their father, a Jewish entrepeneur named Emmanuel Sonnenschein
("Sunshine" in English).  The ambitious son Ignatz (Fiennes, who also
plays Ignatz' son and grandson) rises to power in the Hungarian
government, then goes down with the monarchy.  His silly, free-spirited
cousin Valerie (Jennifer Ehle) deserts him over his conformity and
allegiance to the regime; his brother (James Frain) turns communist.</P>
<P>After WWI, the focus shifts from this triangle to Ignatz's son Adam
(Fiennes again), who becomes an Olympic champion and public hero after
renouncing Judaism, only to find his father's admonishment not to trust
in political power proved true.  When the Nazis ("philistines" as one
character describes them) overrun Hungary, Adam fails to save his family
from being killed or scattered.  Valerie is almost the only survivor. 
She is played in later life by Rosemary Harris (Ehle's real-life
mother), whose luminous performance is easily the film's best.</P>
<P>Adam's son Ivan (Fiennes once again) is scarred by watching his father's
murder at Auschwitz and, after the war, becomes an official in the
equally brutal and philistine Communist Party.  The Communists are also
anti-Semites (because they hate the wealthy classes) and Ivan finds
himself again imprisoned and dehumanized.  At the end of the film, Ivan
and Valerie remember their family and faith, and Ivan changes his name
back to Sonnenschein, though the name is all he has left.  His house has
been confiscated; the furniture, keepsakes, and cultural artifacts that
decorate the movie are thrown onto a garbage truck.</P>
<P>Sunshine clearly cost some bucks to make, and the result is the most
meticulous recreation of a historical period that I've seen on film. 
The screenplay is not as flawless: some characters are sketchy and
others are unappealing (especially Adam's girlfriend, played by Rachel
Wiesz) --- though to be fair, only Valerie and Ivan live long enough to
reach maturity.  There are some superficial moments; some of the sex
scenes are unpleasant and unrealistic.  But ultimately, the film is
redeemed by its religious core and its powerful use of images and
themes, both good (love, freedom, civilization, family) and evil
(politics, power, ambition, envy).  The film starts off slow but gets
better and better as it goes, building to a powerful, thoughtful
conclusion.</P>
<P>In the film, Svabo clearly draws distinctions between good beliefs and
bad beliefs.  Aware that he has lost his faith and followed the false
gods of political ideals, Ivan asks, "If there never was a God, then why
do we miss Him so much?"  Among the film's many characters, it is
perhaps great-grandfather Emmanuel (played by David de Keyser) who comes
off best, because he remains true to sensible beliefs.</P>
<P>On New Year's Day of 1900, Ignatz predicts that the new century will be
a time of "love, justice, and tolerance."  Lots of people probably still
think the 20th century was a time of greater love, justice and tolerance
(along with modern improvements, walking on the moon, etc.) so it's
probably a good thing that the movie brutally underscores the irony of
Ignatz's prediction.  The 20th century was the most murderous and
"philistine" century in history, in which Europe actually became less
civilized.  It was not a century of improvements but of "breaking all
our inheritance" (as one character says) and throwing it onto garbage
trucks.</P>
<P>At the end of the film and the century, Hungary knows freedom for the
first time in almost a century.  But in a world that is becoming ever
more "philistine" (judging from say, Eminem's new CD), less religious,
and less diverse, will the next century be much better?</P>
