<P>Director John Frankenheimer makes us forget about his last disastrous
outing along the fat, old, powder-faced legend of the acting community,
Marlon Brando (THE ISLAND OF DR.MOREAU (5/10)) and hops right into an
old-fashioned espionage/car chase caper starring the always
interesting, Robert DeNiro.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A band of rogue mercenaries are hired by an unknown employer to recover
a mysterious briefcase in France. Unknown to one another, the group
attempt to reach their goal, while constantly keeping an eye on each
other. Lots of car chases through narrow streets, shoot-outs and
double-crossings pepper this lengthy thriller.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Interesting, thrilling, well directed, yet overlong picture features a
couple of excellent car chases, fun shoot-outs, and solid acting. Think
HEAT (8/10) meets THE FRENCH CONNECTION (6/10) in Paris! This film
didn't pack the deepest story line of all time (chase the briefcase
everybody!), but it did manage to keep me entertained through most of
its lengthy sitting, and even sparked some new life into the standard
car chase scenes. I can't truly say that I understood the finale, but
for some reason, it didn't really bother me either. I was quite
entertained by the film, and didn't really mind the semi-puzzling
ending.</P>
<P>DeNiro was cool as a cat, as per his usual method style, and was graced
with some of the hipper lines in this movie (Did you ever kill a guy?
Deniro's response: "No, but I hurt somebody's feelings once.") The rest
of the cast was also pretty solid, with Skarsgård standing out from the
pack. The score of the film also set the right atmosphere, as did the
wonderful cinematography, featuring the wonderful splendor of France.
The only negative points that I recognized in this film could be that
its final resolution was a little ambiguous, and that its run-time was
about twenty minutes too long.</P>
<P>Overall, this film will surely appeal to you if you enjoyed the
previously mentioned HEAT or FRENCH CONNECTION, and will definitely not
disappoint any DeNiro or car chase fans. This year has not been a great
year for thrillers, but RONIN makes sure that it is present when all
names are called. Strap yourself in, learn some French, and get ready
for a bumpy ride!!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Screenwriter Richard Weisz is actually the one and f-kin' only, David
Mamet. Apparently, he is responsible for almost the entire screenplay,
but the Writer's Guild of America decided that he had to share credit
with J.D. Zeik, who originated the story, so Mamet elected to go with
the pseudonym instead.
None of the actors in this film were ever told what was really supposed
to be in the briefcase. The actual contents of the case were really
chocolate bars during the filming of this movie. 
The finished project also left 83 cars "injured" after shooting
wrapped.
Ironically, director Frankenheimer also directed the dismal sequel to
THE FRENCH CONNECTION, called THE FRENCH CONNECTION II. Born in New
York and raised in Queens, John always wanted to become a professional
tennis player.
Robert DeNiro is the son of Robert De Niro Snr, an abstract
expressionist, and Virginia Admiral, a painter. He studied acting at
the Actors Studio with Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg. In his 1980
Oscar acceptance speech, Bobby thanked Joey LaMotta, who was at the
time suing United Artists for RAGING BULL's (7.5/10), portrayal of him.
In 1995, he and his girlfriend Toukie Smith had twin sons, conceived by
in-vitro fecundation.
Jonathan Pryce was one of the stars of DARK BLOOD, along with Judy
Davis and River Phoenix but the movie was never released due to
Phoenix's death during filming in 1993.</P>
