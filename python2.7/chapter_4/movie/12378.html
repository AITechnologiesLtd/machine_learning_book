<PRE>THE SPANISH PRISONER
Rating: *** (out of four)
PG, 1998
Directed and written by David Mamet.
Starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Steve Martin.</PRE>
<P>I suppose I never had a particularly strong belief in the integrity Corporate
America, but I don't know if I ever imagined the amount of backstabbing,
double-cross, and ultimately murderous greed that seems to permeate David
Mamet's THE SPANISH PRISONER. The film is centered around Joe Ross (Campbell
Scott), who has just come up with a new invention that looks to make a fortune
for his company. But as soon as he starts demanding his fair share, he finds
himself caught up in a conspiracy devised by someone who is evidently looking
to steal his idea and frame him for several crimes, thus putting him safely
out of the way.</P>
<P>Mamet builds up to this with a fairly long setup that is almost dreamlike in
its stiff, idiosyncratic dialogue and exposition. Many details are withheld,
such as what exactly Joe has invented, what his job is, what company he works
for, and exactly how much money they look to rake in (it's written on a
blackboard off-screen). A fair amount of the dialogue is concerned with issues
of finances or legal procedures, but the characters talk in a very detached
and precise manner regardless of the subject matter. When Susan Ricci (Rebecca
Pidgeon), a secretary from work, decides to pursue a romance with Joe, she
dispenses with most of the subtlety fairly quickly, stating what she wants
very clearly and directly, as if drawing up a business contract. And then
there's the occasional line that just comes out of nowhere, such as when
aristocrat Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin) offers to buy Joe's camera for a thousand
dollars with the same matter-of-fact, straightforward delivery one would
expect of someone asking to borrow a pencil.</P>
<P>Martin's performance is probably the strongest of any in the film. His offer
for the camera marks his first appearance, so we know there's something funny
about him from the very beginning. He doesn't let us forget it from then on,
developing an eerie presence that leads the viewer to question his motives,
but without coming right out and declaring, "Hey, I'm a bad guy!" Jimmy Dell
is hardly the only eerie element in this film, however: Joe and his employers
are so concerned about keeping his invention a secret from competitors that
they all start to seem a little bit paranoid after a while, especially when we
see the quasi-ominous poster hanging in the company hallways featuring a
pointing finger with the caption, "Somebody Talked!" Clearly, someone is going
to try to cheat Joe out of his fair share; we just don't know who or when.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the stiffness that works so well for the first half of the film
starts to work against it once the double-cross is set in motion. In a series
of plot twists similar to (but somewhat more believable than) those found in
THE GAME, all traces of Joe's invention and past acquaintances suddenly start
disappearing, while at the same time he is framed for tax fraud and murder.
Mamet consistently keeps us guessing about the other characters' real motives
and about what will happen next, so I won't give away any more plot details.
The downside is that that's about all he does. Because of the precise but
emotionally distant way in which the characters behave, we never really
understand Joe as anything more than just a normal guy who's driven and
ambitious but still honest. Mamet seems to be pushing some sort of lesson
about greed and dishonesty, but it's difficult to appreciate it at any level
other than the strictly intellectual since Joe isn't quite three-dimensional
enough to act as a ciphen for Mamet's ideas to the audience.</P>
<P>The numerous deceptions do manage to tie together by the end without any
especially noticeable plot holes, and the script incorporates a number of what
seemed at first to be minor (but still noticeable) details into the overall
scheme. More than anything, THE SPANISH PRISONER really just runs into the
age-old problem of having created an intriguing mystery but then being obliged
to solve it by the time the credits roll. Still, it could have been somewhat
more successful had Mamet found a way to deliver the idiosyncratic and
enticing setup and make Joe a little more human at the same time. With the
stale characterizations, THE SPANISH PRISONER is not really much more than a
standard paranoid thriller, but it is certainly a very carefully crafted and
well-written one.</P>
