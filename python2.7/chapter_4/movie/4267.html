<PRE>                                  TWO BITS
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     This is a nostalgic film about a child, his mother, and his
grandfather.  It takes place in South Philadelphia in the summer of
1933 when two bits (25 cents) was, in the time of that depression, what
some men would beg to earn for a day's work.  On the day the film
opens, a truck with music and billboards is going through town
announcing the Grand Opening of a new Movie Palace, with the admission
price of 25 cents until 6 PM.</P>
<P>     Looking wistfully at the truck as it passes is twelve-year-old
Gennaro Spirito (Jerry Barone); how he would love to have had the
necessary two bits.  Gennaro lives with his mother, Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio, and his sister, and his grandfather (Al Pacino) who is
not only his best friend but also his mentor on what is happening in
the world.  Grandpa announces that this is his last day on earth, that
he will give Gennaro 25 cents when he dies.  Gennaro does not like the
idea of his grandfather dying so that he can go to the movies.</P>
<P>     Although Gennaro tries to pick up some change by performing in the
streets, he remains empty handed.  Grandpa offers his grandson one
other opportunity to earn the two bits.  It seems that when grandpa was
a young man, many years ago, he had hurt a young woman and he wants
Gennaro to visit the old lady and offer Grandpa's late apology.</P>
<P>     Jerry Barone is a handsome youngster with a sweet, kind face.  He
is well able to fit right in with the older stars, Pacino and
Mastrantonio who give their usual fine performances.</P>
<P>     Director James Foley keeps the film purposely at a slow pace,
reflecting the depression, the summer heat, the boy's frustration and
Grandpa's last days.  Very nicely done.</P>
