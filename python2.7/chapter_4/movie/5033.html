<PRE>                     HEIDI FLEISS: THE HOLLYWOOD MADAM
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     As readers of my reviews have long since learned, my favorite
movie genre is the documentary.  Even poorly constructed documentaries
can provide a fascinating experience and most documentarians are quite
skilled.  If a documentary actually gets a theatrical release, you can
generally be sure that it will be well worth seeing since bad
documentaries have trouble finding a distributor.  Well I am sorry to
report that narcissistic director Nick Broomfield found an outfit
called InPictures to distribute HEIDI FLEISS: THE HOLLYWOOD MADAM.
Simply put, this is the worst documentary I have ever seen.</P>
<P>     Nick arrives in Hollywood just in time to find out that he will
not be able to interview Heidi for two months since she is being put by
the courts into a mandatory drug rehab program.  He does not stop a
minute and instead interviews whomever he can find no matter how
unimportant and boring.  Nick appears on camera almost as often as the
putative stars of the film.  He kept reminding me of Perot, saying,
"this is not about me," but actually the picture seeming to be mainly
about him.</P>
<P>     The documentary is as much about Nick failed attempts at making
the documentary as it is about Heidi Fleiss, her disgusting friends,
and their life running prostitutes for a living.  Many times, we have
long sequences of Nick driving around trying to find someone and
talking about his search.  Lots of shots from inside Nick's car out
over the car's hood as he drives around neighborhoods.  Although Ross
McElwee made a movie about making a documentary in one of the best
documentaries ever, SHERMAN'S MARCH, this is a technique that should be
used only by the most skilled documentarians of which Nick Broomfield
is certainly not one.</P>
<P>     Nick pays off most of the people he interviews and is so crass as
to record him counting off fresh hundred dollar bills to them in front
of the camera before the interview starts.  When Nick needs more
material, he just splices into a lot of stock footage from TV newscasts
like Hard Copy or the local TV station reports.  He gives them credit,
but it feels like plagiarism.  In his narration Nick takes great pains
to pronounce madam with the accent heavily on the last syllable rather
than the first.  Perhaps that is the way the British always do it, but
it sounded like an affectation.</P>
<P>     Heidi's story does emerge through interviews with her coworkers,
her competitive pimps, "her girls", and her sleazy boyfriends.  They
tell of her prostitution ring being famous.  Men would call Heidi up
and say things like, "fly us 3 girls now to the Dorchester hotel in
London."</P>
<P>     Heidi came from the family of a respected pediatrician father and
a schoolteacher mother.  Nick tells us her parents were children of the
60s and believed in a free wheeling lifestyle.  Heidi's mother tells
the camera, "I bet a lot of people who came down on prostitution, say
'I'd like to make $1,500 a night.'"</P>
<P>     The film concentrates on two despicable characters in Heidi's
life.  The first is her original pimp and later her main competition as
a pimp, Madam Alex.  She is in her late 60s and is interviewed on her
bed while dressed in a flimsy white outfit.  You feel like she might
slime her way off of the screen at any moment.</P>
<P>     The other is her boyfriend and her second pimp, Ivan Nagy.  He, as
are most of the others, are into both drugs and prostitution, but Ivan
is a smooth operator who hides his evil.  The interviews with both of
them reveal little insight because of Nick's almost total lack of
skills as an interviewer.</P>
<P>     The film feels like someone making a parody of a documentary.  It
is so muddled, it is like staring at something through a glass of mud.
Based on what little I did learn, I suspect that even if the glass had
been clear, none of the people interviewed were worth hearing from.</P>
<P>     Eventually, just before the film, ends Nick finally gets to
interview Heidi.  She provides such enlighten explanation as to how she
got started as, "I just realized there were young pretty girls around
and a lot of rich men."  Well, that certainly explains everything.
Heidi is one of the shallowest people you will ever meet and
consequently her interview has no depth.  Moreover, she is a sigularly
unattractive woman.  As Madam Alex put it, "she wasn't even a 5" on the
infamous 10 point beauty scale.  Heidi does prefer older men and we
learn, "Any guy over 40 looks good to me!"</P>
<P>     In a movie populated by boring sleasebags and done by a
self-serving documentarian, there is a single good scene.  Just before
he is to interview Heidi he gets into an argument with the local
channel 5 reporter and camera crew over who are legitimate and who are
exploiters.  The channel 5 reporter has the definite argument.  She is
legitimate because she has a number on her mike, and he doesn't.  Case
closed.</P>
<P>     HEIDI FLEISS: THE HOLLYWOOD MADAM runs 1:46 and seems like it will
never end.  I saw it all but wish I had left early.  The film is not
rated, but would certainly get an R for bad language, some sex, and
some nudity.  The show would be fine for most teenagers.  I can not
recommend it and give it the lowest rating I have ever given to a
documentary, a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
