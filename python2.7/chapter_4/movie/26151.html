<P>    When "The Exorcist" first opened in 1973, lines formed
around the block at the only New York theater screening the
mother of all Satanist films.  I recall waiting in twenty-degree
weather on a Saturday morning for two hours, the longest
period of time that I ever tarried to see a film.  The crowd
was mixed.  All ages were represented.  Perhaps the
marketing campaign was supremely successful, or more likely
the congregation assembled because "The Exorcist" was
viewed as the first major film on an individual's possession by
the Devil.  Though the film was critic-proof--as is probably as
true today as then--reviews were on the whole positive
anyway, with Leonard Maltin awarding three stars for an
"intense, well-mounted adaptation of William Peter Blatty's
best-seller, calculated to keep your stomach in knots from
start to finish."</P>
<P>   Given the voluminous number of horror movies since that
time, and the strong representation of Satanist melodramas,
are we now so habituated to the thrills and scares of "The
Exorcist" that we find the film either laughable or bland? 
Quite possibly.  The reason William Friedkin's work will
continue to involve us and make us think about the nature of
faith is that the director had mastered all aspects of
film-making to such an extent that John Boorman's and
William Peter Blatty's attempts to mount sequels in 1977 and
1990 failed miserably from confusion and a greater weight of
absurdity than the genre could bear.</P>
<P>   One of the virtues of "The Exorcist" is its leisurely pace--
slow, but not sluggish.  By keeping the tempo leisurely,
Friedkin gets to develop all of his principal characters so that
we care about them.  Even more important we believe that
the mayhem caused by the possessed 12-year-old is real and
an event as ghastly as the dominion by Satan within a lovely,
innocent child is possible.  We don't see aliens with eels
crawling out of their bellies for half the movie and in fact we
see only a single diabolical spirit throughout the film's
substantial time of 132 minutes.  We learn, as well, that with
the exception of an exorcism that Father Merrin (Max von
Sydow) performed in Africa--just a single such event and one
which lasted for an entire month--was the only known case of
such an incident since the Sixteenth Century.   We might not
find difficulty  believing that such a cataclysm could indeed
occur once or twice every four hundred years.  The discovery
of a small, ghoulish statue by Father Merrin was not a
contrived, chance event.  We believe in the power of the relic
because Friedkin spends considerable time in the opening
quarter hour or so to situate his action in Northern Iraq, the
scene of the biblical treasures of Nineveh where a large
number of local people are digging under the supervision of
the American churchman.  And the people speak Arabic!  </P>
<P>   The Georgetown (D.C.) home of Chris MacNeil (Ellen
Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) is lavish,
equipped with a butler, a cook and a nanny. This too is made
painstakingly credible when Friedkin does not simply have
someone state that Chris makes her living as an actress in
major studio movies but actually shows us a substantial
scene involving a student demonstration taking place
presumably between 1968 and 1973.  No expense is spared
to make us accept the details of the narrative, which this time
around includes eleven minutes never seen before including
the best single shot--a few seconds that will startle
arachnophobics and others alike.</P>
<P>   While a majority of the audience for this digitized re-release
of "The Exorcist" will have never before seen the movie on
the big screen but only on the absurdly inadequate
technology of videotapes, the re-release is a godsend (no
pun intended).  Folks in high school and college and some
perhaps on their first job will get to see what a real horror
movie is like before the fast pace of video games made pure
sensation a requirement for big box office among the prime
movie goers.  Some viewers in their teens and twenties might
even try to figure out a line by a detective in the homicide
bureau (Lee J. Cobb) who asks a potential companion to
accompny him to a movie, "Othello," with Groucho Marx in
the title role and Debbie Reynolds as Desdemona.  </P>
<P>  While we credit the movie for avoiding the usual cheap
frights of the Friday the 13th series and the like, we lament
that this film, for all its artistic attributes, may not invoke
screams from a benumbed audience.  But what a pleasure to
see that a horror film can be exquisitely and lovingly made in
an age of cheap shots and shoddy thrills.  Ian Waldron-
Mantgani, a major online critic in a Liverpool suburb, notes
that the film is still banned on video in the UK because of
fears that children, who would then be able to see the movie
at home, could be affected for the worse.  The jury is still out
on the influence of violent movies on the impressionable
young, particularly one that features a 12-year-old
sporadically cursing, urinating in public, vomiting green stuff,
twisting her around completely around, and generally making
a case that Ritalin is not all it's cracked up to be.  </P>
