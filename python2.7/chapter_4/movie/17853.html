<P>   If you were a beautiful, talented woman, which guy would
you pick?  Your first suitor is tall, dark, incredibly handsome
and smooth, and as a virtuoso pianist is entirely capable of
accompanying you on your cello.  What's more he speaks
your language and owns a Mercedes 500.  He has come
from your native France solely to pay court to you.  The other
admirer is shorter than you, witty in English in ways beyond
your comprehension, but at a total loss in your own language. 
He plays no instrument but dedicates his time to opening a
restaurant and desperately needs a loan to survive.  Hint:
This is a romantic comedy.</P>
<P>   Now that you're guessed correctly, you realize that in this
genre, the object is to keep the two would-be lovers apart
throughout the story, bringing them together only at the
conclusion.  "Lost and Found" varies not at all from its film
category, and while the movie is eminently watchable and
enjoyable, the fable rarely rises above the caliber of TV
sitcom.  Featuring the usual objects of sitcom derision, "Lost
and Found" highlights strange and laughable people such as
a group of biddies who wile their hours playing strip poker
and a kitchen staff which headlines the idiotic Turtle (played
by Turtle), who unleashes a fire extinguisher on a pan of
flaming goodies, and a blobby guy, Wally (Artie Lange), who
wants only to be a disciple of his boss.</P>
<P>   With David Spade in the lead role of Dylan, a struggling
California restaurateur, director Jeff Pollack launches a series
of skits in the style of Saturday Night Live rather than a
single, unified design.  Unoriginal that the assortment of
scenes may be, most of them work, thanks largely to the
talents of Coby, a clever, wily and handsome cairn terrier in
the role of Jack and to the beauty of Sophie Marceau who, as
the angelic Lila, has successfully taken on the challenge of
her first English-language comedy.  </P>
<P>   Dylan seeks a relationship with his next-door neighbor, Lila,
who has set herself up in California to pursue her goal of
playing cello with a philharmonic orchestra.  Dylan's
competition for the woman's affections is Rene (Patrick
Bruel), whom Rene has thrown out of her life in Paris after
she has caught him cheating but who has come repentant to
America to rekindle the tie.  Suspecting that he is way out of
his league, Dylan conjures a design to gain her attention by
kidnapping Lila's dog, Jack, and offering to help her look for
the terrier all over town.  In a secondary plot, Dylan has lost
a diamond ring entrusted to him by his friend Mark (Mitchell
Whitfield), who intends to present the jewel to his wife as an
anniversary surprise.</P>
<P>   "Lost and Found" does not exactly push the envelope,
given the recent run of vulgarity in "Trainspotting," "Clerks"
and "There's Something About Mary," but you can't help
chuckling at the movie's big poop joke--and this is a big one. 
When the feisty Jack swallows the ring, Dylan must wait until
the dog passes the stone.  When Jack does his business
along with a dozen other dogs in a park, Dylan collects all the
fertilizer in one huge trash bag, graphically sifting through the
treasure with his loyal employee, Wally.  Jack is used for
comic ends as well by winding up in a running dryer,
emerging with a bad-hair day that could bring a scowl to the
face of the dog people in the audience.</P>
<P>   Patrick Bruel, a French rock star, turns in a believable job
as David Spade's rival, who uncovers the shorter man's
designs and uses the information to put an end to the
competition, while some nice short roles are put in by comics
like Jon Lovitt--who plays the part of a "dog whisperer" who
advises on methods of separating the ring from the dog.
David Spade comes across as a soft-spoken, likeable guy,
not at all the loudmouth that you might expect in a Roberto
Benigni movie. "Lost and Found" opens on Ginger (Ever
Carradine), the wife of Dylan's friend, who sums up her
impression of Dylan: "I thought you were a jerk but you were
sweet--intermittently--when I got to know you.  That pretty
much sums up the picture.</P>
<PRE>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 95 minutes.  (C) 1999
