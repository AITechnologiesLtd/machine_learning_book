<P>There's no denying that "Saturday Night Live" alum Mike Myers has
talent. He can write, act, produce and improvise. But most of all he's
just really damn funny. A few years ago, he was best known for
"Wayne's World", a lowbrow pre-Adam Sandler comedy about two slackers
who get their own TV show. The film spawned a sequel in 1993, and
after that Myers took a four-year hiatus. He made a grand return in
1997 with "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery", a 60's spy
spoof featuring himself as the shagadelic, unhygienic title character
(and as his nemesis, Dr. Evil).  The film grossed 50 million in
theatres but became a huge hit on video. Like I said before, Myers is
really damn funny, but you wouldnt know it from his latest, "Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"; the lackluster sequel to the other
"Powers" film.</P>
<P>Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) is back and this time he has brought an even
more eclectic band of characters to help him take over the world. To
act as his evil sidekick, replacing his quasi-evil son (Seth Green),
he has made a clone of himself; a person 1/8 his size whom he
affectionately calls Mini-Me (Verne Troyer). He also has invented a
"time machine" which will enable him to return to 60's Britain.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Austin Powers has just found out that the woman whom he
believed to be his wife (Elizabeth Hurley) was actually a robot
working for Dr. Evil. In order to stop Austin from plotting his
revenge, Dr. Evil sends out Fat Bastard (Mike Myers, once again) to
steal Austin's "mojo" (basically his libido, but for Austin, it's the
reason why women fall for him despite his many flaws, which explains a
lot). Austin then teams up with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) to
retrieve the mojo from the hands of Dr. Evil. But Dr. Evil has also
created a "laser" which he will use to destroy every city in the
world.</P>
<P>While the first "Austin Powers" was occasionally very witty, the
sequel is only funny about once every 15 minutes, and all of its humor
is quite dumb. In many ways, "Austin Powers" is a very conventional
movie franchise. The first film was a hit because of its originality
and style, and it did well because of word-of-mouth. The sequel is a
typical Hollywood creation, as the humor is dumbed-down for the kids
and the wit and sharpness of the former is gone.</P>
<P>Much of "Austin Powers" humor comes from the audacious sexual
references that are somehow harnessed to just avoid an "R"
rating. There are dick jokes aplenty in the sequel, and many bodily
fluids are passed around ("South Park", anyone?). A little-known fact
about "Austin Powers" is that half of the film is improvised. Director
Jay Roach keeps the camera rolling and it is usually then that he
catches Mike Myers' comedic skill.</P>
<P>"The Spy Who Shagged Me" will undoubtedbly rake in millions at the box
office, and many sequels will follow. Maybe, just maybe, one of those
sequels will provide something as fresh and new as the original film.</P>
<P>Note: The entire opening weekend was sold out, and many of my friends
told me just about every joke in the film before I got to see
it. Maybe that is a factor; maybe not.  Also, what's up with the "Star
Wars" references? It is a sad comment on society when "The Spy Who
Shagged Me" outdoes "Star Wars" at the box office and then laughs in
its face.</P>
