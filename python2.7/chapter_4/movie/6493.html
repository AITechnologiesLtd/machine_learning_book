<P>     This mildly diverting update of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE stars Sly
Stallone as the sole rescuer of a group of motorists trapped in New York
City's Holland Tunnel after a chemical explosion seals off both ends.
Along with the survivors-- about a dozen, all carefully balanced by both
race and socio-economic status-- our hero, who's the city's former EMS
Chief, must contend with in-fighting, flood- ing, hypothermia,
structural collapse, and, last but not least, a flotilla of New York's
most-famous four-legged friends.  Why did it have to be rats?  Both the
dialogue and the plot are laughable-- witness Amy Brenneman wrestling
with a sparking power wire as if it were a live anaconda.</P>
<P>     The tunnel's resemblance to a future Universal Studios theme park
ride is also unfortunate.  Two early sequences do dazzle, though:  the
big fireball, which is a seat-gripper, and Stallone playing a Super
Mario Brother as he attempts to jump through four giant fans.  (Each is
timed separately and can be stopped only once and only for a few
seconds.) While the entire cast deserves a special Oscar for maintaining
the year's straightest faces, mention must be made of Stallone, who
never lets us forget how hard he works for his money, be it climbing
rocks, hanging from girders, or exploring underwater anterooms.  What a
guy.  </P>
