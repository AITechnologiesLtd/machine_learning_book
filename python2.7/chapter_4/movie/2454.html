<PRE>"I didn't like the Beatles and I don't like *you*."
                                - Phil Hartman to Olivia d'Abo
                                  on popular music and popular
                                  opinion.</PRE>
<P>     GREEDY is a horribly excuted "ensemble" comedy about a band of
money-hungry cousins who will do *anything* to get their hands on their
rich Uncle's dough.</P>
<P>     The story introduces Uncle Joe (Douglas), an eccentric millionare
who's taken up with a sexy pizza-girl (d'Abo).  His cousins have been
circling their bait for years and are, understandably, outraged.  So
they call in Joe's favorite nephew, Danny (Fox), to even the balance.
But Danny has his *own* ideas about how to take care of Uncle Joe.</P>
<PRE>     (Is that vague enough? :-) )</PRE>
<P>     GREEDY tries hard to walk a straight line between slapstick and
serious.  But the tone is never correctly set.  Even *with* footage of
Jimmy Durante over the opening credits.  I don't care who you
blame--the bottom line is a film full of people trying either to be too
funny or too serious.</P>
<P>     The deck's already stacked with a cast of lightweights.  I mean,
come-on, Nancy Travis?  Ed Begley Jr.?  Or Jack Benny-lookalike Phil
Hartman!?!  Fox is fun, but he still looks seventeen.  Only Kirk
Douglas gets away with anything above acting.  He has a large time
growling and groaning and leering and lying.  Just listen to him
deliver the line "I'm richer than sh*t."</P>
<PRE>CAMEO NOTE: The director does a droll turn as Joe's butler.  And watch
            for still-alive Kevin McCarthy, who inexplicably appears
            as one of Joe's lawyers.</PRE>
<P>     Just as the cast is uninteresting, so are the characters.  The
cousins are all one-note cartoons and the central protagonist, Danny,
is a professional bowler!!  Who though *that* one up??</P>
<P>     If nothing else, GREEDY certainly *looks* good-- but who cares
about production values in a film with uninteresting characters?  For
that matter, who cares about uninteresting characters?  Which is the
problem:  when the jokes all-too-often go flat, there's very little to
fall back on.</P>
<P>NOTE:   As trying as the whole experience is, GREEDY has one genuine
        gut-buster that comes toward the end.  And it makes this mostly
        mediocre movie just a little bit above okay.</P>
<PRE>Bottom line:   GREEDY is horribly executed ensemble-comedy that tries
               to walk a straight line between serious and slapstick,
               but the cast can't carry the material.  Kirk Douglas, as
               an eccentric millionare, is fun.  But the rest of gang is
               a waste.</PRE>
