<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A satisfying atmospheric thriller, set in London at the turn-of-the
century, starring Laird Cregar as George Harvey Bone, a classical music
composer who suffers from blackouts which results in murder, as the
dissonant sounds of the city make the sensitive Bone snap when he is
upset and stressed out. This was the 28-year-old, burly, 6 ft. 3 in.,
300 hundred pound Cregar's first starring role and last film due to his
sudden death. It was caused by a crash diet that weakened his heart. He
was only an actor for five years, having previously been a nightclub
bouncer, among other temporary jobs. His most memorable role was in The
Lodger as Jack the Ripper, a film that was similar to this one, only
presented in a more subtle psychological framework and became recognized
as one of the more interesting serial killer films made. As good as this
film is, it never lived up to that one, as  histrionics took over for
dramatics during the concert hall fire during the finale, with Cregar
madly playing on the piano his completed work as the place burned down.</P>
<P>This film is loosely adapted from a book by Patrick Hamilton. It centers
around a London square, where the young composer is busy working on a
major concert commissioned for his neighbor, the wealthy and
aristocratic Sir Henry Chapman, whose lovely daughter Barbara (Faye
Marlowe), also a pianist, is attracted to the talented and well-known
composer. But he is acting strangely of late, disappearing for the day
and not remembering what happened. There is a murder in Fulham of an
antique dealer on the day of his amnesia and he wonders if he did the
killing. To settle his doubts, he goes with Barbara to Scotland Yard to
see a psychologist he trusts, Dr. Allan Middleton (George Sanders) and
leaves him a dagger and his blood-soaked coat to examine.</P>
<P>The Scotland Yard report comes back with no links to him being at the
crime scene, though
Dr. Middleton recommends that he should get away from his music and
learn how to relax, that he is too full of stress. Following the
suggestion, he takes the night off and visits a neighborhood pub and is
attracted to the lowbrow music being sung by the sexy Netta Longdon
(Linda Darnell).</P>
<P>The vulgar singer finds a golden cow in Bone and pretends to be
attracted to him and leads him on romantically, while getting him to
take time off writing his major concert to compose popular songs for her
act so she could move out of the pub scene and hit the legitimate
theater scene. When Bone gets suckered into writing songs for her, with
his expectation that she will marry him, but finds out she's about to
marry her theater producer Eddie Carstairs (Glenn Langan ), he reacts
violently, attacking Carstairs by attempting to strangle him.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler in the next paragraph.</P>
<P>The most memorable scene in the film is the Guy Fawkes day celebration,
with Bone lost  in the crowd surge going to the festive tradition of
burning a replica of Guy in a big bonfire, carrying through the streets
the body of his latest victim--Netta. He strangled her with the knotted
curtain cloth from his house and he now climbs the stairs of the huge
bonfire and tosses her masked body into the fire. The Guy Fawkes
celebration comes every November the 5th, to honor his failed attempt to
burn down the House of Parliament.</P>
<P>Cregar gave a nightmarish performance that was staggering and memorable,
while Linda Darnell was alluring as the scheming chanteuse. This is a
fast-paced B&W suspense yarn, one that held my attention throughout. It
is also noted for its exciting Bernard Herrmann score whenever the
action picks up.</P>
