<P>The Online Encyclopedia Britannica contains 533 articles that include
"Newton" (including a lot of Isaac and a bit of Huey) but nothing about the
Newton bank robbers. Even Boolean searches turned up nothing.</P>
<P>In my amateur poll, no one had ever heard of the Newton Boys. I suspect
that today very few Americans have, most likely people over 80. So, score
one for movies that  add to our knowledge of  pop culture.  I suspect too
that back in 1967, when "Bonnie and Clyde" came out, its characters were
far less familiar to a broad public than names such as Capone or Dillinger.
Ditto, in 1969, for Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch -- except for people
in Wyoming and neighboring states.</P>
<P>Yet, for the period 1919-1924, the four Newton brothers (plus the
oddly-named Brent Glasscock, the nitroglycerin expert) were responsible for
a record number of successful bank robberies and for the biggest train
robbery in American history, arguably in the world, after the British coups
of 1855 and 1963.</P>
<P>Why the Newton gang has not, until now, entered history in a big way is
probably explained by a statement presumably made by Willis Newton, the
leader: " We don't kill anybody, we don't steal from women and children, we
don't  rat." Apocryphal or not, this sets the quintet apart from the
violence and lack of thieves' honor that prevailed in the Chicago (and
Midwest) school of gangsterism.</P>
<P>The Newtons are poor Texas farmers from Uvalde, which happens to be also
the hometown of Matthew McConaughey (Willis Newton). Willis is out of jail,
to which he was railroaded for something he had not done. Or so he claims.
(The film is frustratingly sparse on details and information). He opts for
something more fruitful than farming as a career: robbing banks.</P>
<P>With not-so-odd rationalization, he figures that to take money that way is
no big crime. After all, banks are insured, the insurers are crooks, the
banks inflate their losses, everybody is a thief, so why not rob robbers?
One step farther and we could get into the Robin Hood logic, except that
the Newtons keep their loot. While watching the film it is worth
remembering that it takes place during the affluent Roaring Twenties and
not during the future Great Depression when suffering was generalized and
banks (those that did not fail) were not only a target but the enemy.</P>
<P>The action starts with a wonderfully quiet and matter-of-fact heist made
colorful by a microscopic bank in the middle of a flat nowhere landscape,
and doubling the color as an old flivver chases after three hold-up men on
horseback.</P>
<P>Then comes the formation of the five-member gang.Willis decrees they must
stick to night robberies and use nitroglycerine to blow up safes. It works
beautifully, with more piscturesquenes and some quite funny episodes. The
protracted spree (five years is a very long time for this sort of thing)
takes the Newtons from Texas to Nebraska to Canada, and back to northern
Illinois for the train robbery. The train hold-up comes after the gang goes
from riches to rags because --ironically-- Willis had made a legitimate
investment that turned sour; and after banks started using more
nitro-resistant safes.</P>
<P>The Newtons are, by and large, likable fellows, often well-mannered, not a
bit nasty or bloodthirsty. But their saga doesn't really work dramatically.
The robbers seem to be doing this for a lark, a lark which results in
fashionable clothing, new cars, ritzy hotels, and, moderately, in wine,
women and song.</P>
<P>Director and co-writer Richard Linklater is a triple-A "new" filmmaker:
"Slacker" (1991),"Dazed and Confused" (1993), "Before Sunrise" (1995),
"SubUrbia" (1997). An exceptional, original filmmaker, he has, in many
ways, adapted to American mores and modified in style and substance, the
old French New Wave (notably Godard and Rohmer) in films that are different
from one another yet retain a superb sense of humor and of life-
with-absurdisms. Throughout his works, Linklater maintains a laid-back
attitude (but never twice the same,) sharp eyes and ears, and un-gooey
sympathy for his creatures.</P>
<P>Those qualities are in The Newton Boys, but backfire somewhat in what one
expects to be a genre action movie. The film has a tendency to meander,
pack down too much in sketchy episodes, and occasionally confuse.It even
features a standard montage for the passage of time. Willis, as the leader,
is the key personage; the others,oo much of a supporting cast, receive
scant character development. They are somewhat differentiated but not
sharply, and lack fleshing-out. An unintentional red-herring is Brent's
wife Avis whose initial appearance suggests sexual possibilities, but
nothing comes of that.</P>
<P>The maker of "Slacker," slackens his pace before mid-film. He picks up with
his characters' misguided, Keystone-cops-in-reverse fracas with several
bank messengers in Toronto and later with the oddball train robbery.
Linklater's laid-backness purposely omits other possible tensions while
making of the gang nice ole boys whom we perceive as robbers yet not as
criminals.</P>
<P>There are, however, several very good touches. A love-affair between Willis
and Louise (a single mother who works at the cigar stand of an hotel) may
add a diversion that is so-so, yet there is an excellent, early, throwaway,
subtle scene of reactions when Louise's date comes to get her as she sits
flirting with Willis.</P>
<P>Where "TNB" is admirable is in its production values. Sets, music,
costumes, artifacts and paraphernalia combine into a beautiful,
authentic-feeling ensemble of period recreation, with much attention to
details --down to wristwatches that are right for the time.</P>
<P>The photography is just as good. Cinematographer Peter James has spoken of
the visual progression, from the beginning's "prairie feel," to the
pastel-using robbery scenes, to the brighter look of the gang's affluent
period and the darker look of their downfall days.</P>
<P>Beyond the basic facts, to what extent the movie embroiders on the Newtons'
deeds is hard to tell. I feel skeptical about the early scene of a bank
director (sic) offering the Newtons an improbable 85 cents on the stolen
dollar and giving them a list of 41 banks that still use old-style safes.
And, for reasons which you will understand if you see this movie, the
brothers have been prettified from the hicks they really were into
semi-gentlemanly cowboy-thieves.</P>
<P>Judged by the breathless standards of the genre, "TNB" falls short of
expectations. But as a departure from that category, weaknesses and all,
the film, while only occasionally gripping, does remain interesting.</P>
<P>Some of the best sections are at the beginning and at the end. The opening
credits are like silent movie film cards. I wish the rest of the film had
stuck to black and white and I would guess that so did Linklater,but
economic imperatives are against this notion. What comes with the end
credits is very funny. Do not leave your seat prematurely.</P>
