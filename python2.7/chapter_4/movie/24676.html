<PRE>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A>
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>DreamWorks' first foray into tasteless teen territory is a bawdy blend
of American Pie's horny adolescence (minus the pastry porking) and
There's Something About Mary's affinity toward semen-as-a-sight-gag.
And in terms of overall entertainment, Road Trip ranks somewhere between
its two predecessors – a rare film that is consistently funny with the
majority of its jokes hitting the bulls-eye.</P>
<P>Trip is largely told via flashback by Barry (Tom Green, The Tom Green
Show), an eighth-year student at the fictitious University of Ithaca.
The tour guide for prospective students and their parents, Barry is
pressed for details about exciting stories of campus life and eventually
begins to tell the tale of one Josh Porter.</P>
<P>Josh (Breckin Meyer, Go) was, Barry explains, an IU student trying to
survive a long-distance relationship with his lifelong girlfriend
Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard, The Rage: Carrie 2), who is currently
attending veterinary school at the University of Austin.  Josh's
nightmares of Tiffany's potential infidelities, coupled with the fact
that she won't return his phone calls, leads the sophomore to a
one-night fling with a hot blonde named Beth (Amy Smart, Felicity).  A
videotape is made and accidentally mailed to Tiffany, who it turns out,
wasn't calling Josh back because of a death in the family.</P>
<P>Still wanting to maintain a romantic relationship with Tiffany, Josh
decides to hit the road to intercept the tape before his girlfriend gets
it.  His friends E.L. (Seann William Scott, Final Destination) and Rubin
(Paulo Costanzo, in his film debut) con Kyle (DJ Qualls, in his film
debut), a nerdy compulsive masturbator with a credit card and a sky-blue
Ford Taurus, to provide the wheels for the road trip to Austin.</P>
<P>The trip, of course, is full of wacky teen hijinks, like stealing from
the blind, Evil Knievel-style jumps over washed-out bridges and, what is
sure to be the equivalent of Pie's pie scene, sperm donation.  There are
two subplots, one involving Beth's ill-advised journey to Boston (and
not Austin) to find Tiffany, and the other entails a jealous teacher's
aide (Anthony Rapp, Man of the Century) hell-bent on making Josh miss
his Ancient Philosophy midterm.</P>
<P>Oh, and here are some major plot holes – Beth knows Tiffany's last name
from seeing it on the videotape's envelope, but doesn't remember that
she doesn't go to school in Boston.  And for some reason, Josh needs to
pull a B-plus on his midterm to pass the class.  I guess the final exam
doesn't count.  Despite it being midterm in upstate New York, there is
no snow on the ground.</P>
<P>While some people will insist that Trip could be American Pie 2: The
College Years, the film smacks more of a 1998 straight-to-video picture
called Overnight Delivery (the only reason I know about Delivery is
because Dogma's Kevin Smith was supposed to have done an un-credited
rewrite of the script).  Save the presence of the Josh and Beth's
videotape, it's exactly the same film – very light on script, but full
of gags.</P>
<P>Filmed in Georgia, using four different college campuses, Trip was
directed, composed and co-written by Todd Phillips, who is probably best
known for Frat House, a documentary that won the top prize at the 1998
Sundance Film Festival and was purchased by HBO but never shown on
television amid allegations that the antics of the fraternity members –
especially regarding brutal pledge hazing – were all staged.  Trip was
executive-produced by Ivan Reitman and features great cameos by Andy
Dick (Inspector Gadget), Horatio Sands (Saturday Night Live) and a very
funny voice-over by The Man Show's Jimmy Kimmel.</P>
<P>1:35 - R for strong sexual content, crude humor, language and drug use</P>
