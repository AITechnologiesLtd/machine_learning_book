<PRE>THE USUAL SUSPECTS (1995)</PRE>
<PRE>Film Review by Michael Chen</PRE>
<P>Rating: **** (out of ****)
Rating: 9.5 (out of 10)
Director: Bryan Singer
Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin
Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, Kevin Spacey
Screenplay by: Christopher McQuarrie
Duration: 105 minutes</P>
<P>If plagiarism were a crime in film techniques, director Bryan Singer
would be imprisoned for life. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would
be serving a similar sentence. However, since it is not, Singer and
MacQuarrie (who have joined forces again after the not-so-successful
PUBLIC ACCESS) took advantage and duplicated nothing but the best. From
CASABLANCA to PULP FICTION, and even a version of a line (intentionally
or otherwise) from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.</P>
<P>The opening credits run while we see water, discernable by the
reflection of streetlights, quietly flowing in the background. It is
dark, and a chilling melody creeps. When the formalities conclude, we
are aboard a ship. It is ‘last night'. We meet a couple of people who
have a brief conversation. Soon after, the ship explodes, and we the
audience have absolutely no idea what's going on, but are dying to know
more.</P>
<P>The principal story starts ‘6 weeks ago', and revolves around five
hardened criminals, who seem unable to escape from the law – even if
they haven't done anything. The five are round up on suspicion of
hijacking a truck carrying gun parts. When they are inevitably released
they team up to plan and execute crimes – including revenge. But they
soon sense that someone is controlling them – someone with power –
knowing their every move. In amongst all this is a cop, at ‘present
day', who is obsessed with pinning down one of those five usual suspects
– an ex-cop.</P>
<P>There should not be more revealed about the plot, as this is a story
that has a twist-in-the-end. However, even if you can anticipate the
surprise, there are copious amounts of clever directing (especially the
final sequence) from fresh-face Bryan Singer with interesting camera
angles that upholds the film. Even though Singer borrows heavily from
prominent directors, he adds ingenious touches of his own for greater
effect. Along with the adroit directing there is nail-biting suspense,
slow-motion action, and superb acting. Not one actor is out of place.
All five criminals are distinct, have different fields of expertise, and
all are characterised brilliantly. The mania of McManus (Baldwin), the
calm authority of Keaton (Byrne), the insouciance of Hockney (Pollak),
the shadowy cowardice of Kint (Spacey), and the unfathomable speech of
Fenster (Benicio Del Toro). Then there's the assertiveness of Special
Agent Kujan (Palminteri), and the unquestioning loyalty of Kobayashi
(Postlethwaite) to his master, and other absorbing characters portrayed
by Suzi Amis, Giancarlo Esposito, and Dan Hedaya. Kevin Spacey is the
prize in this colossal pack, and was honoured with an Academy Award for
Best Supporting Actor. McQuarrie also picked up an Oscar for his
captivating original screenplay.</P>
<P>John Ottman was responsible for the expert editing. Believe it or not he
also composed the enthralling original score. From the first note of
‘Main Theme' to the last note of ‘The Greatest Trick' the music offers
substantial support for the film's atmosphere. Ottman was also the
editor and composer of PUBLIC ACCESS.</P>
<P>Many people oppose watching a film with a twist a second time. I
disagree. By watching it again you can observe how the director and the
screenwriter have hidden and revealed clues, how they have tried to
steer the audience away from the ending. First time is for
entertainment. Second time is for art. This film is certainly worthwhile
to see again. To date, I have watched it five times. (Two of those five
times I thought, ‘well, I'll just watch about half-an-hour,' but ended
up watching the entire film because it is so entertaining.) I'm not
exactly a noir fan, so it is assured that this particular crime film
appeals to a wider audience.</P>
<P>One minor thing I would like to point out is that the hospitalised
Hungarian's speech should have been subtitled because it is of some
importance.</P>
<P>THE USUAL SUSPECTS has a skilled director, an engrossing screenplay, and
ten praiseworthy performances. The film runs a fast 105 minutes. Don't
miss a minute of it.</P>
<PRE>****: Classic
***½: Highly recommended; Excellent
***: Recommended
**½: Okay; Passable
**: Time-Killer
*½: Ill-advised cure for boredom
*: Keep an alarm clock beside you, also usually suitable to end a
relationship
½: Try to restrain yourself from inflicting pain to anything nearby,
including yourself and the screen, on realisation of how much time and
money you have wasted
