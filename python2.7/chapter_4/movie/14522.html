<PRE>.                                URBAN LEGEND
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     A SCREAM knock-off?  Yes.  A good SCREAM knock-off?  No.</PRE>
<P>     Sadly, URBAN LEGEND will be another forgotten entry into the teen
horror revival fad of the late 1990's, and with good reason.</P>
<P>     Despite putting together one of the better ensembles of young actors
(basically, it's all the leftovers from hip TV shows that haven't yet been
slaughtered on camera, including "My So-Called Life"'s Jared Leto), a really
dumb script and lifeless direction causes URBAN LEGEND to fail the singular,
critical test of horror films:  It's not scary.</P>
<P>     Even the "hip jokes" are not hip, and they're not funny....  In fact,
it's only the self-referential humor (a rumor about "that girl in that
Noxzema commercial," referring to Gayheart; a blip of Paula Cole's signature
tune when Jackson(of TV's "Dawson's Creek") flips on the radio) that keeps
URBAN LEGEND above a total disaster.</P>
<P>     The plot is something about a serial killer reenacting a bunch of urban
legends (guy with axe in back seat, killer calling on a phone inside the
house, et al.), but it's barely memorable.  It isn't scary in any case.</P>
<P>     Of course, the *only* reason I even bothered to see this film is
because it stars the radiant Alicia Witt, who I could watch for two hours
doing the laundry.  In fact, I think I would have *preferred* the movie be
completely about Witt doing her laundry....  I'll have to pitch that to a
studio someday.  But I digress.</P>
<PRE>     Anyway, Alicia, I forgive you.  I hope Hollywood does.</PRE>
