<P>The suspense genre, which has been decidedly absent of quality movies
since last year's THE GAME, comes back to life here in a thrilling
recreation of Alfred Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER. It is to some degree
of wonder that Michael Douglas, who had the lead role in the 1997
thriller, comes back to command the genre again. Whether it's his
involvement, or the able direction of Andrew Davis (THE FUGITIVE),
there's a lot about A PERFECT MURDER that goes right, making this movie
a top-of-the-line suspense thriller. </P>
<P>Michael Douglas is once again a successful businessman, this time named
Steven Taylor. He's got a trophy wife, Emily Bradford (Gwyneth Paltrow,
Great Expectations), who works for the United Nations. Unfortunately for
Steven, though, Emily has an artist lover named David Shaw (Viggo
Mortensen, G.I. Jane). Once Steven finds out, though, it's no big deal -
under the guise of looking to buy some art pieces, he travels to David's
downtown loft and confronts him about it. Ultimately, he makes David -
an almost penniless man - an offer he can't refuse: five hundred
thousand dollars to kill his wife. </P>
<P>The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between
three different characters. Steven, icily intense and incredibly wild,
is easily the best of the three, done by Michael Douglas in outstanding
fashion. David and Emily both pale in comparison, although David is
slightly better simply for the devil-may-care attitude that Viggo
Mortensen brings to him. Finally, Gwyneth Paltrow does the least amount
of truly suspenseful acting; her character is left to walk around like a
doe in a shooting gallery. What makes the conflict even more exciting is
the fact that both Steven and Emily also have financial gains to make:
Steven's a lucrative businessman, so obviously he's loaded, and Emily
has one hundred million dollars in inheritance that lands in the lap of
whatever man she dies while married to. As Sarita Choudhury (playing
Raquel, Emily's friend) says in the movie, "Money is the oldest reason
in the world to kill someone." </P>
<P>The music is also in fine form here, scored by James Newton Howard. It
picks up and moves to a crescendo to emphasize character emotions, and
in general increases the suspense level by several notches. This is more
than adaquate proof of Andrew Davis' skill at directing a suspense film;
but also of note are the way he combines the script with cinematography
to provide a sensationally tense atmosphere. A PERFECT MURDER may not
fare well in the box office against more flamboyant summer films, but it
is a truly enjoyable film throughout and a definite must-see. Suspense
fans, this one's for you.</P>
<P>FINAL AWARD FOR "A PERFECT MURDER": 3.0 stars - a good movie.</P>
