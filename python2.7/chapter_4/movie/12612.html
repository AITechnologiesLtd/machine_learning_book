<P>    GODZILLA shouldn't be this much fun.  After showing what to do right 
with a cheesy disaster movie in the incredibly entertaining INDEPENDENCE 
DAY of 1996, Emmerich and Devlin do everything wrong in this motion 
picture.  Without a doubt the most cliched, hackneyed picture made by 
Hollywood in recent memory, Godzilla has one of the worst scripts I have 
ever seen.  The dialogue is garbage, the characters are under-written, 
the acting performances are pathetic, and the music is unbelievably bad. 
 Yet, I guarantee you that Godzilla will be one of the most enjoyable 
movies you have ever seen. 
    Remember that 45 minute lead-in to the aliens in ID4?  Forget it.  
Devlin and Emmerich are out to get the monster shown in a hurry, and 
they do.  By the time the credits are over, you see the destructive 
power of Godzilla.  Within 30 minutes, Devlin and Emmerich show you the 
beast.  A mix between an iguana, a crocodile, and a T-Rex, he does look 
good.  The animation is smooth, if horrible at certain times, and the 
night sequences are particularly fantastic.  Emmerich's talents with 
quick cuts and sharp turns make these portions a delight, especially 
helicopter chases that go around searching for the monster. 
    Unfortunately, it's the portions bookending the monster sequences 
that are absolutely dreadful.  Matthew Broderick does his best as Nick 
Tatopoulus, an expert on radiation effects, but he isn't helped much by 
this awful script nor by the other actors.  Maria Pitillo is atrocious 
as Broderick's long-lost love, a perfect ditz who can't get anything 
right.  Hank Azaria is as wonderful as ever, but he is so underused we 
never get a chance to really know him.  Only Jean Reno has the most 
impact: as a mysterious Frenchman, he is a wild and crazy delight, a 
cross between Jeff Goldblum and Brent Spiner's characters in ID4. 
    After a particularly good 40 mins, the movie settles into a 60 
minute holding pattern that is mildly enjoyable at its best, and 
downright tedious at its worst.  The CGI graphics are outstanding, and 
the movements of the monster are fabulous, but sooner or later, you get 
tired of seeing the same old scenes over and over again.  Savant is OK 
as O'Neil, a big and important soldier, but he's not used much either, 
and wasted like the rest of the cast.  Cliches abound, and the jokes are 
painfully stale. 
    However, it is the last 40 minutes that saves Godzilla.  This movie 
resembles last year's Memorial Day blockbuster, The Lost World, in that 
both are mediocre.  However, Devlin and Emmerich saved their best for 
last, which is what Spielberg should have done.  When Broderick and Reno 
go hunting for Godzilla's nest (that's right, he's pregnant--just watch 
the commercials!), they find 200 eggs, all of which hatch into little 
baby 'Zillas, each of whom are about 5-6 feet tall.  Imagine lizard 
velociraptors.  What happens is some frighteningly fun sequences with 
200 monsters and 4 people in a closed up Madison Square Garden.  Have we 
seen this before?  Sure.  Jurassic Park did it better before Godzilla, 
the remake, was even thought of.  But damned if its not fun.  The 
sequences are gems because they provide some action.  Quick cuts and 
stale jokes here help, because they are so lighteningly paced that we 
actually laugh. 
    The real fun comes at the end, with an elaborate chase scene.  
Again, everything from this movie is derivative.  From the music to the 
monsters, we've seen all of this before in far better movies.  But 
that's the point.  Devlin and Emmerich set out to make a modern-day, 
B-movie monster movie with an enormous budget.  That they succeeded 
proves that you don't need a script to make a movie fun; you just need a 
lot of money.  Godzilla shouidn't be this much fun.  We should hate it 
because it is everything we abhor about the movie industry.  But inside 
that movie theater, it certainly can be captivating.  This is not a good 
movie; its just a damn fun bad one.</P>
