<P>     As you drive around the United States, you can immediately
identify what type of community you're riding through by the houses you
see and the people outside of them.  Conformity is a staple of society,
and those who refuse to fit in almost inevitably become the targets for
all sorts of unreasonable persecution.  Obviously, this isn't the case
for just one country.  As the current worldwide news headlines point
out, it's a universal truth, and Colin Nutley's HOUSE OF ANGELS
provides another viewpoint of the price of conforming, or refusing to
do so.</P>
<P>     HOUSE OF ANGELS begins in a small farming community somewhere in
Sweden, where a local citizen is about to meet his death in an
automobile accident.  At his funeral, his sole surviving relative
arrives--a long- lost granddaughter by the name of Fanny (Helena
Bergstrom).  She is accompanied by gay companion Zac (Rikard Wolff),
who's the perfect picture of a biker: leather jacket, sunglasses, and
five o'clock shadow.  The pair are from Berlin, and have big city
conventions that don't exactly fit in the small town setting, so when
they move into the dead man's house, the residents of the village
become uneasy.  The women are afraid that Fanny will steal away their
menfolk, and the men are uncertain what to make of their new neighbor.
Only one person has a clear goal.  Axel (Sven Wollter), the local
bigshot, wants Fanny out so he can buy up her land.</P>
<P>     Things aren't always what they seem--a point that HOUSE OF ANGELS
is adept at illustrating.  The script is peppered with such instances,
the most obvious of which relates to the two central characters.  Fanny
and Zac look like the wild, drug-addicted deviants that the townspeople
believe them to be, but few are willing to get to know the pair well
enough to test their preconceived convictions.  Once the label is
affixed, nothing Fanny can do will remove it.  Eventually, she decides
to give people what they expect, but this leads only to her own
disillusionment.</P>
<P>     The small town/big city conflict is played out with conformity as
the principal weapon.  Too many of the villagers don't want something
new or different in their midst, and so are threatened by what Fanny
and Zac represent.  Rather than concede the potential value in such
diversity, they attempt to squash it.  The local vicar's pleas for
understanding fall on deaf ears as a group of women led by Axel's wife
Rut (Viveka Seldahl) confront Fanny and tell her plainly that she isn't
wanted.</P>
<P>     Before her grandfather's death, Fanny hadn't been to the village.
Indeed, she never met the man who willed her his estate.  Her mother
died when she was eleven, and she never knew her father's identity.  By
coming to the place where her mother became pregnant, Fanny is given
the opportunity to explore her roots.  Finding her father isn't of
paramount importance, since she already recognizes what the audience
comes to learn: it's who you are, not who your parents were, that
makes the difference.</P>
<P>     Given the nature of the subject matter, clumsy handling could
easily turn every character into a caricature.  There's the gay biker,
the shrewish housewife, the aging bachelors, the plotting rich man, and
the randy young carpenter.  Credit director Colin Nutley for rigorously
avoiding the stereotype pitfalls.  His attention to detail has caused
the population of HOUSE OF ANGELS' village to be comprised of
carefully- constructed individuals.  The cast also deserves
recognition; there's not one of them that isn't up to the task of
playing a unique part.</P>
<P>     HOUSE OF ANGELS is an excellent example of how a film that is
basically lighthearted in spirit can be used to probe deeper, more
intense issues without becoming preachy or overbearing.  There's a
priest in this film, but the movie isn't given to sermonizing.  The
picture's sense of fun rarely flags, nor does the inner core of drama
that underlies each scene.  HOUSE OF ANGELS has a lot to say, and the
best thing is that the audience enjoys every word that's spoken.</P>
