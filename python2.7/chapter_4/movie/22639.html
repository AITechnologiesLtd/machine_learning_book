<P>Kurt Vonnegut acknowledged one of the great truths about life in his
1985 novel, "Galapagos." The narrator of the tale is from 1,000,000
years in the future, when mankind has evolved into beings that bear
scant resemblance to present-day humans. Still, he assures us, some
things never change, even in the distant future. For instance, people
in that era still laugh about as much as we do now. "If a bunch of
them are lying around on a beach," he says, "and one of them farts,
everybody else laughs and laughs, just as people would have done a
million years ago."</P>
<P>Vonnegut is right, of course, though too many of us are loathe to
admit it. Writers like me babble endlessly about the post-modern irony
of the "Scream" series or the deliciously surreal verisimilitude of
"Being John Malkovich," but throw a fart joke our way and we fold up
like a cheap tent. In our insular, oh-so-sophisticated little world,
we turn our noses up at movies that traffic in low humor.</P>
<P>Unless they're old, that is. You see, old low humor is classic, while
new low humor is crude and juvenile. W.C. Fields made a career playing
drunken louts who routinely threatened children and we rave about his
brilliance. But when Adam Sandler plays a slacker who teaches a kid to
pee against a wall, we complain that he's a horrible role model whose
parenting is tantamount to child abuse. If "Blazing Saddles" or
"Animal House" were released today, I guarantee there would be whining
about the lewd humor, not to mention the shameful objectification of
women and tasteless racial and ethnic jokes.</P>
<P>Which brings me (finally) to "Next Friday," the sequel to Ice Cube's
1995 comedy, "Friday." The film, which features a gag involving a big
pile of dog shit in its first five minutes, is packed with fart
jokes. There is also considerable dope smoking, as well as crude
sexual humor and numerous pratfalls. Our heroes are lazy stoners who
steal, most of the women are either brassy or shrill, and the only
male Hispanic characters act like Cheech and Chong on
methamphetamines. In addition, "Next Friday" is sloppily assembled,
with virtually no plot and absolutely no character development.</P>
<P>But it's funny. Imagine a live-action "Nickelodeon" slapstick comedy
with lots and lots of swearing and you'll have an idea of what to
expect. There isn't a sophisticated second in "Next Friday," but for
those willing to loosen up and go with the flow, the burlesque is
often entertaining.</P>
<P>The original "Friday" followed Craig (Ice Cube), a laid-back guy still
living with his parents, through one day in South Central Los Angeles,
climaxing with him duking it out with neighborhood bully Debo (Tommy
"Tiny" Lister) and becoming a hero of sorts. The sequel picks up four
years later. Debo has just broken out of prison and, at his father's
insistence, Craig goes to stay with relatives in the suburbs until
things settle down. Within an hour, he is up to his neck in a new set
of problems.</P>
<P>John Witherspoon, reprising his role as Craig's pop, spends most of
the movie running around with dog poop smeared on his clothes,
blathering about hot sauce while frantically trying to find a
bathroom. His performance is wildly over the top and I tried not to
laugh at his hammy antics, but the man's twitchy abandon was
impossible to resist. Likewise, Craig's sidekicks Day-Day (Indiana
native Mike Epps) and Roach (skateboarder Justin Pierce) make a
likable Mutt and Jeff team, sputtering and falling down a lot as they
play out the film's obligatory wacky scheme.</P>
<P>The women get a chance to overact as well. Tamala Jones and Lady of
Rage behave like "Jerry Springer" guests as D'wana and Baby D, a
wrathful pair aiming their anger at Day-Day. And Kym E. Whitley is
loosey-goosey as Suga, the horny girlfriend of Craig's Uncle Elroy
(Don "D.C." Curry).</P>
<P>Ice Cube serves as the calm center of this group of loons, acting as
an anchor for all the craziness, much like Mary Tyler Moore did in her
old TV series (by the way, this is probably the very first time anyone
has ever compared Ice Cube and Mary Tyler Moore). Cube, who also wrote
the screenplay, remains an enigmatic performer. With each new role, he
becomes a bit more accomplished and, oddly, more opaque. Sometimes it
seems like the stoic actor is trying to disappear in his own movie,
which makes him all the more interesting</P>
<P>Even at a relatively short 95 minutes, the slapstick and bantering
loses steam towards the end. Still, "Next Friday" is mostly good
lowbrow fun. Ten years from now, I doubt if this will be compared to
"Blazing Saddles" or "Animal House." But anyone willing to set aside
their pretensions, lie down on the beach and giggle at the farts is
likely to have a fine time.</P>
