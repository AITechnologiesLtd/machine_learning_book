"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>What do an alcoholic titty-bar waitress, an obsessive-compulsive 7th
grade teacher and a kid with beady little eyes and giant teeth have to
do with each other?  You can find out in Pay it Forward, a
button-pushing film with terrific acting, an interesting story and a
really hokey ending.</P>
<P>Forward begins with a Los Angeles news reporter named Chris Chandler
(Jay Mohr, Action) getting his classic car ruined during a hostage
situation.  While he stares in disbelief at the twisted pile of metal, a
complete stranger offers Chandler a brand-new Jaguar.  Shocked beyond
belief, Chandler asks the stranger if any strings are attached to the
generous, out-of-the-blue offer, to which the stranger replies, `Pay it
forward.'  The understandably curious reporter then launches an
investigation into the situation.</P>
<P>Flash to four months earlier, where 11-year-old Trevor McKinney (Haley
Joel Osment, The Sixth Sense) is beginning his first year at a Las Vegas
middle school.  His social studies teacher, Mr. Eugene Simonet (Kevin
Spacey, The Big Kahuna), gives Trevor and his class an abstract
extra-credit assignment by telling them to `think of an idea to change
our world and put it into action.'</P>
<P>The strong-minded Trevor immediately begins to work on the project,
coming up with a rather simple, inventive idea of thinking globally but
acting locally.  His plan - dubbed `paying it back' - has three steps
(like The Tao of Steve) that basically calls for everybody to help three
other people in unique ways.  In turn, these people will help three more
people, who will help three more people, and so on and so forth, until
the whole world becomes one cosmic pyramid scheme of do-gooders.</P>
<P>The main problem with Forward is that Trevor concocts this idea within
the first 30 minutes of the film, so you know that Chandler will
eventually trace `pay it forward' back to Trevor before the credits
start to roll.  The remaining ninety-plus-minutes are rather
predictable, save a couple of minor twists at the end.  But it's still
fun to watch Trevor's plan take root, especially when it shows you can
go from providing a bowl of cereal to giving away a luxury vehicle in
just five simple steps.</P>
<P>After Trevor's first attempt to help a homeless man (James Caviezel,
Frequency), he sets his sights on Mr. Simonet, a slightly disfigured
burn victim who doesn't appear to have had a date since the Carter
administration.  Trevor tries to fix his unsuspecting teacher up with
his mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt, As Good As it Gets), a boozehound with
half-empty bottles stashed all over the house.  At first, it seems like
all of Trevor's attempts at helping others fail miserably, but the
presence of the Chandler sub-plot reminds us that at least one must have
been successful.</P>
<P>It's interesting to watch people get suspicious and angrily shout, `I
didn't ask for your help,' when strangers offer to go out on a limb.
Forward also shows people `paying it forward' on a broader level through
corrective parenting.</P>
<P>If you think it sounds schmaltzy, just wait until the ending, which
drives its point home with the weepy Jane Siberry song "Calling All
Angels."  It's calculating beyond comprehension.  Forward has other
problems, too.  The sole black character is a convicted thief, while the
only two Latinos are knife-wielding pre-teens.  Jon Bon Jovi (U-571),
who plays Trevor's deadbeat dad, looks strangely effeminate and could
probably pass for a transvestite on the right street corner.</P>
<P>There's also a big stumbling block with the Chris Chandler thread of the
story.  Why does he start tracing the origins of `pay it forward'?  It's
just dumb luck that he catches the thing while its only five steps
removed from the source.  He could have been hundreds of participants
away, and his search could have taken years.  Forward's time
manipulation is a little shaky as well.  Chandler's story begins four
months after Trevor launches `pay it forward,' but by the last reel, the
past has somehow caught up with the present.</P>
<P>Forward was directed by Mimi Leder, who is probably best known for
helming action films (like Deep Impact and The Peacemaker) and is a
frequent contributor to the fast-paced ER.  The deliberately slow pacing
of Forward comes as somewhat of a welcome change, as are the close-ups
of Mr. Simonet's scars and Arlene's prematurely aged mug.  The film was
written by Leslie Dixon (The Thomas Crown Affair) and adapted from the
Catherine Ryan Hyde novel.  But don't let the fact that the film was
written and directed by women give you the impression that Forward is a
chick flick.</P>
<P>Oscar-caliber talent can be found behind the camera as well as in front
of it.  Thomas Newman (a nominee for American Beauty) provides the
score, while David Rosenbloom (a nominee for The Insider) serves as the
film's editor. Cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, who was robbed of a
nomination for The Cider House Rules, does a fantastic job of making the
characters seem extremely isolated from the rest of the world,
especially with scenes looking out Mr. Simonet's classroom over the
barren desert and Rocky Mountains.</P>
<P>2:05 – PG-13 for adult language and violence</P>
