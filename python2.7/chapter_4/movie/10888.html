<P>     Denzel Washington stars in this run-of-the-mill religious thriller,
as a Philly police detective stalked by the spirit of a serial killer
that he once put away and who was only recently executed.  The catch?
Well, there are a couple:  Casper the Unfriendly Ghost can occupy almost
any ol' human host *and* he can pass himself from one person to the
next, simply by touch.  Now, although our hero doesn't catch on for at
least an hour, *we* are shown the whole possession process from the get-
go.  And that's a grave mistake, 'cause it leaves the story with nowhere
else to go.  A better script, I suppose, would kick right into over-
drive, aiming for the sort of over-the-top territory that THE DEVIL'S
ADVOCATE did so well.  Or, maybe, it would go in the other direction,
descending into, say, a clever character study or detailed police pro-
cedural.  Alas, what Nicholas Kazan's screenplay *does* do is just
schlepp along, with a little bit of mystery here, a little bit of sus-
pense there, and a whole lot of missed opportunities everywhere else.
Though well-acted and handsomely produced, FALLEN fails in the most fun-
damental of ways:  it doesn't compel you to keep watching.  (Mom and I
left after an hour.)  With Donald Sutherland, James Gandolfini, Embeth
Davidtz, Elias Koteas, and looking dangerously close to a coronary, John
Goodman.  Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PRIMAL FEAR).  </P>
