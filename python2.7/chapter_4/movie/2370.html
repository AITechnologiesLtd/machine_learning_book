                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     THE WAR ROOM is the story of James Carville and George
Stephanopoulos, and their efforts on behalf of Bill Clinton throughout
the 1992 Presidential campaign.  From the New Hampshire primary to
election night, THE WAR ROOM depicts Carville and Stephanopoulos'
backroom strategy sessions and public moves as they catapulted their
man from a virtual unknown to President Elect.</P>
<P>     This is not Bill Clinton's story, nor is it an account of how he
beat the odds to become the first Democratic President in twelve
years.  Rather, THE WAR ROOM is an examination of two of the men
instrumental in the victory:  James Carville, the "Ragin' Cajun" and,
to a lesser extent, the yuppiesque George Stephanopoulos.</P>
<P>     Carville, with his buoyant personality and glib one-liners,
naturally steals every scene from the soft-spoken Stephanopoulos.  THE
WAR ROOM is a pleasure to watch primarily because of Carville's
presence.  Without him, this could have been yet another dry
documentary on the behind-the- scenes political process.
Stephanopoulos is intelligent, but he's not particularly interesting to
watch.  Carville, on the other hand, is magnetic, not only because of
his own keen intellect, but because everything he does is suffused with
a sense of sincerity.</P>
<P>     Most of the highlights of THE WAR ROOM are quips and one-liners
from Carville.  About George Bush:  "He reeks of yesterday.  If I think
of an old calendar, I think of George Bush."  About Ross Perot's
overblown and self-aggrandizing campaign:  "...the biggest single act
of masturbation in the history of the world."  On election eve, even as
a Clinton victory seems certain, Carville ad-libs a tongue-in-cheek
concession speech that, while amusing, sounds exactly what the
candidate might have said had Bush made a miraculous comeback.</P>
<P>     While most of the movie focuses on Carville's professional
activities as he heads the efforts to defuse the Gennifer Flowers
situation, prepares a television commercial, and leads the attack on
the Republicans, we are given a glimpse into his personal life.  His
girlfriend, Mary Matalin, appears several times--albeit doing her job
as President Bush's campaign strategist.</P>
<P>     Clinton, Bush, and Perot have peripheral roles in this film that
concentrates its attention of the people behind the Democratic campaign
strategies.  While elements of the tactics used by the members of the
so- called "War Room" are revealed (including a fascinating discussion
of the relative importance of the colors of Clinton/Gore signs at the
Democratic Convention), the movie is less concerned with political
maneuvering than with the maneuverers.</P>
<P>     Whether your political persuasion is Democratic, Republican, or
somewhere in between, that won't matter much to your enjoyment of THE
WAR ROOM.  Necessary, however, is a fascination for elections and
politics, or a curiosity about the turbulent campaign of 1992.  The
film makers readily admit that movie-goers out for an evening of
mindless entertainment will be turned off by THE WAR ROOM.
Nevertheless, regardless of its subject matter or format, this picture
is intensely interesting and surprisingly fun in its presentation of
one of the most outrageous characters in the Clinton camp.</P>
<PRE>     It's a pleasure to note that the directors plan a followup in 1996.</PRE>
