<P>     In Richard Donner's CONSPIRACY THEORY, Mel Gibson finds himself with
a classic action-comedy premise on his hands.  Gibson stars as Jerry
Fletcher, a Manhattan cab driver whose hobbies include stalking an
attractive Justice Department prosecutor named Alice Sutton (Julia
Roberts), harboring paranoid delusions about anything and everything, and
committing the aforementioned paranoid delusions to a monthly newsletter
called "Conspiracy Theory."  He's just another crackpot in a city full of
crackpots, until a mysterious doctor (Patrick Stewart) kidnaps him and
wants to know "who else knows what you know."  He manages to escape,
realizing that one of his half-baked theories may actually be true...only
he has no idea which one it might be.</P>
<P>     Given a classic action-comedy premise, Gibson makes what would seem
to be a rational acting choice:  he gives a classic action-comedy
performance.  He informs his captive fares of the menaces of fluoridated
water and the new 100 dollar bill.  He wanders around in a wool cap
muttering paranoid non-sequiturs like Popeye after an "X-Files" bender.
He knocks a Fed over the head, then asks the prone G-Man, "Are you
faking?"  For about half the film, Gibson is an oddball delight.</P>
<P>     What a waste.  By all evidence, no one besides Gibson involved in
CONSPIRACY THEORY realized that it was an action-comedy.  For some
inexplicable reason, Donner and screenwriter Brian Helgeland decide that
CONSPIRACY THEORY is a psychological thriller.  Exit slick, simple plot,
enter a muddle of dark experiments and indecipherable connections between
characters who never even appear in the film.  Exit Alice Sutton the sane
foil to nutty Jerry, enter Alice Sutton the haunted woman with a wounded
psyche of her own in need of nursing back to health.  And exit Jerry the
entertaining crackpot, enter Jerry the tragic basket case who clings to
copies of "The Catcher in the Rye" as though they were life preservers.</P>
<P>     The latter choice is ill-advised bordering on inexcusable.  Like the
professional that he is, Gibson sobs dutifully through the scenes of Jerry
at the end of his tether, spewing forth exposition between squints and
grimaces, but it's clear he'd much rather be goofy than grandiose.  It's
easy to laugh at Jerry when Gibson is playing him for laughs, because
there's no sense that he's genuinely mentally ill; he's just a man who
thinks he knows something who becomes a man who knew too much.  When the
script yanks him into the realm of the deeply disturbed, it yanks the
viewers' feet right out from under them.  Every bit of fun Jerry provides
suddenly becomes vaguely tainted.  You start to feel as though you really
should be feeling sorry for him instead of laughing at him.</P>
<P>     That fun is desperately missed through much of CONSPIRACY THEORY,
because it turns into a very long sit.  As the conspiracies pile up and
the chases become a blur over two hours and fifteen minutes, Gibson's
sharp line readings act like electrical paddles to the film's heart.
After four previous films together, you'd think that Gibson and Donner
could find themselves on the same page.  No such luck.  CONSPIRACY THEORY
is the big action-comedy that wasn't, buoyed by the common sense of a star
who realizes when to ignore the director and give the people what they
want.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shallow conspiracies:  5.</PRE>
