<PRE>Reviewed by Heather Picker</PRE>
<P>     Directed by Alfred Zeisler.  Written by John L. Balderston.  Starring Cary
Grant, with Mary Brian.  1936, 70 min., Not Rated.</P>
<P>     In a long gone era, films about the undying spirit of the poor were
common.  Earnest protagonists worked hard to prove themselves, sometimes to
their families, sometimes to themselves, and sometimes to a gal who seems out
of his league.  Is it coincidence that the hero of "Amazing Adventure" is named
Ernest? Ernest Bliss (Cary Grant) receives a large inheritance and decides to
work for a living anyway, in part to prove himself to the working-class woman
he loves (played by Mary Brian).  </P>
<P>     This is a chance to see Grant before he became a huge star, and while he
isn't the most incredible of actors in "Amazing Adventure," it is noteworthy
for being one of the films he made outside of the Hollywood system (it was made
in the UK).  Despite a not-so involving script by John L. Balderston, Grant
fans will find it worth 70 minutes of their time.  In 1944 he'd return to his
British roots with "None But the Lonely Heart," in which he earned an Oscar
nomination as a Cockney drifter.  Known originally as "The Amazing Quest of
Ernest Bliss" in the UK.</P>
