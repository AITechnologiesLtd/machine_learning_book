WITLESS PROTECTION PROGRAM</PRE>
<PRE>THE CREW</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Michael Diner</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay by Barry Fanaro</PRE>
<P>With Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds</P>
<PRE>(THEATER) PG-13 88 min.</PRE>
<P>What is it with all these movies about four old guys? Has someone made 
off with the SAG pension fund? Space CowboysB8 a yarn with wit and =
style and four old geezers recapturing their youth, is still live meat 
in theaters. Now along creaks The Crew, which has everything but the wit 
and the style.</P>
<P>The cut-rate oldsters here are Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan 
Hedaya, and Seymour Cassell, and they're not astronauts, they're retired 
wise guys. As far as we can tell they've been inseparable since they 
were young wise guys, which does make you wonder a little. They're all 
living together in the South Beach section of Miami (think of them as 
Beach Cowboys) rocking away their dotage (Dreyfuss is all of 53, but the 
mob must have a generous retirement plan) on the front porch of the Raj 
Mahal, a seedy waterfront apartment building, when a rent hike forces 
them into action. They rub out a corpse in front of the building to give 
the appearance of a mob hit and cause a scandal that will force down 
property values. A Colombian drug lord and the Miami cops get involved. 
So does a hooker (Jennifer Tilly) and her stepmother (Lainie Kazan).</P>
<P>That's more plot than you need to know. There's a contrived 
tug-at-the-heartstrings subplot involving Drefuss's long-lost daughter 
(Carrie-Anne Moss). What there isn't is the substance and character and 
inventiveness that comedy needs to work. It really is not enough having 
Reynolds doing his bad-boy leer at sexy babes or asking Dreyfuss, a very 
good but not very Italian actor, to say "that dumb scavoots" or, god 
help us, "fuhgeddaboudit." Hugh Grant did it more convincingly in Mickey 
Blue Eyes. These actors have all been good, but here they provide an 
object lesson in the importance of script and director to the film 
process.</P>
<P>This is one of those movies where the creative team began a lot of 
brainstorming sentences with the word "see." As in "See, we got these 
four old mobsters.." Or "See, the corpse turns out to be.." The idea is 
that we're so desperate for entertainment that we'll settle for 
manufactured plot, ersatz emotion, second-hand inspiration, and tired 
humor that can't work up the energy to appear effortless.</P>
