<P>Sean Connery stars as a Harvard law professor who heads back into the
courtroom, by way of the Everglades, to defend a young, educated black
man (Blair Underwood).  The guy is on death row for the murder of a
white girl, and says that his confession was coerced from the region's
tough, black cop (Lawrence Fishburne).</P>
<P>Watching Connery and Fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing
enough, but the plot's a joke.  There's no logic at work here.  Tone is
also an issue--there is none.  Director Arne Glimcher never establishes
exactly what his film is trying to say.  Is it a statement on human
rights?  Is it a knock-off of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?  Glimcher never
tells.  Instead, he forces his characters to jump through hoop after
hoop, over drawbridge after drawbridge, hoping that the audience won't
notice what's missing.</P>
<PRE>Just awful.</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D+</PRE>
<PRE>THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE                         107 min. / Not Rated
==========================</PRE>
<P>Still wondering who Nigel Hawthorne is?  Then check out his Oscar-
nominated work in THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE, still playing in both
Raleigh and Chapel Hill.  Stage director Nicholas Hytner, in a
remarkable screen debut, has adapted Alan Bennett's 1991 tragic comedy
to fine effect.  Sumptuous-looking and only mildly stuffy, the film
charts the madness that plagued King George III (Hawthorne) almost 30
years into his reign.</P>
<PRE>Grade: A-</PRE>
<PRE>A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE                               98 min. / Rated "R"
======================</PRE>
<P>In Suri Krishnamma's A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE, Albert Finney disappears so
deeply into the role of a lovable Dublin bus conductor that it's a shame
when the film gets so serious around him.  His character is a conductor
with a passion for Oscar Wilde.  He reads to his riders, and once a
year, with their help, he tries to stage one of the author's plays.</P>
<PRE>This year it's "Salome."</PRE>
<P>For about an hour, there's a sweet magic behind Finney and his troupe of
working-class stiffs.  Conflict arises, but it's small stuff--an
administrator from the bus company here, an outraged Catholic pork
butcher (Michael Gambon) there.  But with Finney at the wheel, so to
speak, the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the
gorgeous Leland double-decker bus in the story.</P>
<P>Where things get serious is toward the end of the film, when the plot
takes a turn that the bus never would, and the story heads down a very
dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride.  The twist makes
sense--and helps paint a complete picture of Finney's character--but
the trip to get there betrays the light, airy atmosphere of what had
come before.</P>
<P>It's not a fatal misstep, mind you, and it doesn't send the story
soaring into the realms of incredulity.  It's just a turn off.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
<PRE>DR. STRANGELOVE                                     93 min. / Not Rated
===============</PRE>
<P>Mein Fuhrer!  The most fun that *I* had last month was in Durham, at the
Carolina, at a mid-week screening of Stanley Kubrick's pitch-black
comedy DR. STRANGELOVE (OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE
BOMB).  The 1964 film stars Peter Sellers (in three roles), George C.
Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Slim Pickens.  Their antics brought the
house down, which, to my surprise, was packed by an audience younger
than the film.</P>
<PRE>No mineshaft gap here.</PRE>
