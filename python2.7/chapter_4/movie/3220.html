<PRE>                               READY TO WEAR
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1995 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     READY TO WEAR (PRET-A-PORTER) is a film produced and directed by
Robert Altman.  It was written by Altman and Barbara Shulgasser.  The
cast includes Kim Basinger, Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Richard
E.  Grant, Stephen Rea, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Whitaker Forest,
Sally Kellerman, Anouk Aimee, Linda Hunt, Tracey Ullman, Lauren Bacall,
Danny Aiello, Tom Novembre, Lili Taylor, Jean-Pierre Cassall, Michel
Blanc, Lyle Lovett, Teri Garr, Jean Rochefort, Rupert Everett, and many
celebrity cameos.  Rated R for nudity. 132 minutes.</P>
<P>     READY TO WEAR may be the most misunderstood film of 1994.  Most
reviews have called it a satire, a parody, an attack on the fashion
industry.  Whatever Altman's intentions, the resulting film--which
had its original title translated from French to English and had nearly
an hour of its original running time cut, both at the last minute, by
spineless marketeers--is not an attack, but a paean to and a
celebration of the human condition.  It is joyful, uplifting, amazing
in its deep compassion and wise understanding of what being human is
all about.  Like Walt Kelly's Pogo (or was it Porky Pine?) Altman says
"don't take life so seriously, son, it ain't permanent anyhow." Or
Kelly's even more famous, "We have met the enemy, and he is us."</P>
<P>     READY TO WEAR is no more an attack on fashion than THE PLAYER was
an attack on the film industry; both films hold an artifact of our
shared culture up to the light but only so we can marvel at this absurd
toy which so reflects our own absurdity.  Does anyone doubt that Altman
loves the flicks after seeing THE PLAYER?</P>
<P>     Fashion, with all its absurdity, contradiction, and extremism, is
a human invention and as such stands as an illuminating symbol of all
human lives, all human inventions.  And the last fashion show in the
film is the best of all, full of dignity and hopefulness, as bold and
touching a statement of optimism as I've seen in years.  A review
quoted in the display ads for this film spoils this moment somewhat,
but take it from me that that spoiler misses this point by as wide a
mark as virtually all other comments I've seen about the film.</P>
<P>     The film moves me over and over again.  Just seeing Sophia Loren
at age 60 more beautiful and magnificent than ever doing a loving strip
tease for her greatest co-star, Marcello Mastroianni, here reunited on
the screen for the first time since the late 70s; the strip tease
itself is an homage to another such scene in their great film
YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW (1964), the results being appropriate
different thanks to the intervening three decades. (Other older great
beauties and great women, still by no means superannuated, film are
used also in the Altman film to counter the almost childish models and
fashion's and culture's love of youth--beauties such as Anouk Aimee and
Lauren Bacall and a particularly wonderful Sally Kellerman who manages
to recall her role as Hotlips Hoolihan in Altman's M*A*S*H in one
moment of self-exposure.)</P>
<P>     Another great delight in READY TO WEAR is Kim Basinger, never
before much of a favorite of mine, who here creates the memorable Kitty
Potter, a cable-TV fashion reporter with a Texas accent and
sorority-girl gestures.  Kitty knows nothing that isn't written on her
cue cards, but at the end she at least knows that she will never
understand "this bullshit," as she says.  Her brevet replacement does
understand and helps us do so, too.  But to say much about that here
would be to give away one of the major moments of the film.</P>
<P>     Also to be recommended is the team of Julia Roberts (another
perennial no-show on my list of favorite Hollywood women) and Tim
Robbins.  They are funny enough to get a film of their own together.
The situation that throws them together and keeps them together is a
little improbable, all the way round, but it provides such good clean
fun that one ought not to complain too loudly.</P>
<P>     Forest Whitaker, Tom Novembre, and Richard E. Grant are three gay
designers and particularly Whitaker and Grant go way over the top.
Normally, I would probably be less sanguine about the fops and faggots
routine, but here it is leavened by an opportunity to see beneath the
posing and affectation for a moment or two.  In addition, we have the
real-life designer Jean-Paul Gaultier, he of the many piercings, doing
interviews and being altogether wonderful, balancing somewhat the
actors' extremism.</P>
<P>     On the other hand Stephen Rea is the perfect little shit as the
hot Irish fashion photographer who seems determined for some reason to
destroy his career; perhaps the rest of the part was lost on the
cutting room floor, as the saying goes.  And perhaps Altman will give
us a director's cut on video later so we can see all the treasures
thrown away in the name of marketing.</P>
<P>     For me, the visual appeal of the film was very high indeed.  The
fashions are great fun and in some cases really exciting, although the
best dressed woman in the film is Loren with vintage haute couture and
vast hats right out of Fellini, who always loved a good fashion show
and a really big hat.  The Paris locations are wonderful, too.  It is
the appeal of the fashions that for me is one of the signs that READY
TO WEAR is not the vicious satire it is being called by the
professional reviewers.  Of course, the fashions are often ridiculous,
but they are always creative and amusing, and so very human.</P>
<P>     There are many treasures here--the canine fashion show, for
example, and the transvestites' dinner party--indeed, even after seeing
the film twice in one day, I was still grinning through it all,
laughing out loud occasionally (as when, in Kitty Potter's words, Loren
is being attended in a fainting spell by "two fashion doctors," and
leaving the theater moved and touched and near to tears of happiness.</P>
<P>     Let me be one of the few who recommend READY TO WEAR
(PRET-A-PORTER) to you.  It is worth any price of admission you must
pay and it will repay you over and over again.</P>
