<PRE>PUSHING TIN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In Mike Newell's PUSHING TIN, John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton go head
to head as rival air traffic controllers.  If you thought air traffic
controllers wouldn't be promising subjects for a comedy, you'd be right,
at least based on PUSHING TIN.  But forget the marketing, maybe the film
was meant to be a drama, not a comedy.  Regardless of its intentions,
the resulting movie, while not bad, is neither particularly funny nor
dramatic.</P>
<P>I've seen the movie and still have no idea what the director was trying
to do.  It almost seems as if the creative energies ended after the
film's admittedly strong casting was completed.  Glen Charles's script,
based on an article by Darcy Frey, doesn't have many ideas other than
one good sight gag, which is done twice, and involves a bit of
ridiculous bravado.  The story's twists are predicable, and one of the
best scenes is set up only to be aborted just as it is starting to work.</P>
<P>If real New York air traffic controllers are anything like the guys in
this movie, you may want to rethink your upcoming trip to the Big Apple.
They spend their time horsing around, acting like overgrown kids playing
an increasingly boring video game.  They get their kicks by playing
games with those little graphics representing airplanes in the sky.
Acting like frat boys anxiously awaiting the next panty raid, they
fidget and jump all over the place.  There is a token female on board,
but we're shown her at her body building competition to prove that
underneath she's really one of the guys.</P>
<P>When they're not on the job, the controllers are performing daredevil
maneuvers in their flashy cars.  (They make better than a hundred grand,
their wives brag.) In a scene lifted straight out of MARRIED TO THE MOB,
their overly made-up wives compare numbers, as in which wife number are
you?  Third seems to be about average.  These guys burn out wives like
tires at a racetrack.</P>
<P>Nick Falzone (Cusack) is the leader of the pack, until a lone wolf named
Russell Bell (Thornton) comes into his air traffic controller den.  Like
rival alpha males, they test each other by seeing who can stack the
planes into the tightest spacing without blinking and without causing
passenger deaths.  Hint: Bet on Billy Bob.</P>
<P>Thrown in the plot for no extra charge and not much reason is some juicy
marital infidelity.  Cate Blanchett, looking like a Mafioso wife, plays
Nick's wife, Connie.  The winner in the maximum cleavage category,
Angelina Jolie plays Russell's wife, Mary.  Besides producing the most
saliva from Russell's coworkers, the alcoholic Mary's big claim to fame
is that she is the only wife number 1 in the group.</P>
<P>After the affair -- or is it affairs?  -- the already charged dynamics
between Nick and Russell take on even stranger dimensions.  If the
characters were either more genuine or more humorous, this part might
have proved interesting.  As it is, the movie just lies there without
much happening until the last act, which contains several endings.  Too
bad only one of them is satisfactory, and it's not the last one.</P>
<P>Is there a market for a comedy that isn't particularly funny or a drama
that doesn't have much impact?  Only time will tell, but this movie
doesn't have much going for it other than the marquee names.</P>
<P>PUSHING TIN runs too long at 2:04.  It is rated R for some profanity,
nudity and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
