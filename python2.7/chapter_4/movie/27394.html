<PRE>ANTITRUST
---------</PRE>
<P>Young computer genius Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillippe, "The Way of the Gun")
plans on partnering a hi-tech startup with his best friend Teddy (Yee Jee Tso) 
to provide digital convergence as open source software.  Then he gets a call 
from Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), the Bill Gates-like owner of N.U.R.V. (Never
Underestimate Radical Vision), who wants Milo's expertise for his similar
SYNAPSE project.  Milo's charmed by Winston and disappoints his friend by 
going with 'the enemy,' only to learn that the big corporation is indeed
a dangerous foe in "AntiTrust."</P>
<PRE>LAURA:</PRE>
<P>"AntiTrust" is like "The Firm" without the suspense or romantic intrigue,
(I suppose that's what one would expect exchanging software nerds
for lawyers) with a dash of "Enemy of the State" thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>The film, written by Howard Franklin ("The Man Who Knew Too Little") has
an intriguing enough, albeit unoriginal, premise - what if a Microsoft-like 
behemoth was squashing the little guys by stealing their software and then,
well, squashing them.  Unfortunately, the film's so obvious it invites
laughter in all the wrong places.</P>
<P>Milo leaves southern California for the misty Northwest (Portland rather than
Seattle) with his girlfriend Alice (Claire Forlani, "Meet Joe Black") and
falls for the apparent programming eutopia that is N.U.R.V's campus.  He
gets Winston as his personal counselor (a first time honor at N.U.R.V), a
beautiful new home, flashy new car and a look from Lisa, (Rachael Leigh Cook,
"She's All That") the loner female programmer that has the nerds drooling.</P>
<P>He also gets unexpected help from Winston in programming the highly complex
adapter that will allow any digital device to communicate with any other
digital device.  The first time Gary presents him with a CDROM, Milo's
desktop is displaying CNN footage of the car accident death of a top MIT
software engineer - my, could there be a connection here?  Milo doesn't get
a clue until it's hammered into his head - not only does his best friend
get murdered in an apparent hate crime, but Gary parrots back Teddy's very
words as he slips Milo yet another disk.</P>
<P>"AntiTrust" is the type of ludicrous flick that has a CEO whipping up his
team to produce a highly sophisticated product within 49 days, then shows 
that project's lead programmer playing Nancy Drew while the rest of the team 
generally keeps 9-5 hours.  A supposedly exotic plot twist involves an allergy
to sesame seeds.</P>
<P>Director Peter Howitt, whose last film, "Sliding Doors," was a pleasant 
enough entertainment, doesn't just take a step back, he falls wildly
backwards into a ditch.  He gets little in the way of performances.  Phillippe,
who showed surprising depth in "The Way of the Gun," acts by way of his
eyeglasses in this one.  Robbins pulls out his "Arlington Road" villain and
makes him less interesting.  Rachel Leigh Cook is a statue while Forlani fares
somewhat better by at least using facial expressions.  </P>
<P>John Bailey's ("For the Love of the Game") cinematography is nice enough, but 
relies on 360 degree camera swirls once too often.  Editting by Zach Staenberg 
("The Matrix") throws the film's pacing off - it flows along too leisurely then 
lurches forward with too many important plot points compressed into too little
time - repeat cycle.  Some special effects are interesting, such as the
changing digital art in Winston's palatial home. </P>
<P>The climax of the movie requires one too many leaps of faith from its audience
(as if it hasn't already been taxed at this point).  "AntiTrust" is a hack.</P>
