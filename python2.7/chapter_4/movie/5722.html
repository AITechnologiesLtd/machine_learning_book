<P>A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1996 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</P>
<P>Right after I'd seen JOE'S APARTMENT, I was checking out the poster with
its promise of "Sex, Bugs, and Rock 'n' Roll," when some punk kid with a
crew cut came up to me and asked me what I'd just seen.  "That," I said,
motioning towards the advertisement in front of me.  "Was it any good?" the
young scruff persisted.  My immediate response was to roll my hand from
side to side, indicating ambivalence, but then I thought about it for a
moment...  Remembering the film's juvenile humor, broad slapstick, toilet
jokes, squeaky, high-pitched voices, outright silliness and downright
cutesiness, I revised my opinion.  "Yeah," I told him, "you'll enjoy it."</P>
<P>JOE'S APARTMENT is based on an original short subject that aired on MTV in
1992.  As nothing succeeds like success, it didn't take long for creator
John Payson to pull, tug, and stretch his initial concept into a
ninety-minute feature.  Grown-ups might find JOE'S APARTMENT a little
insubstantial as a result of that expansion, but it's not without its
charms.</P>
<P>Not something you'd expect, necessarily, from a film crawling with fifty
thousand cockroaches.</P>
<P>Computer generated roaches, that is, and singing and dancing ones at that.</P>
<P>The movie opens with our farm fresh hero, Joe (an affable lug played with
open-mouthed conviction by Jerry O'Connell), hopping off the bus in New
York City.  Jobless, the first thing he looks for is a place to stay.  But
every damp, dirty, and wallpaper-peeling dive he looks at runs to four
figures.  "Anything for $100 a month?" he asks.  "Try Nebraska!" suggests a
witty slumlord.</P>
<P>Finally Joe stumbles upon a rent-controlled apartment in the East
Village--"the nastiest neighborhood in New York"--and by an opportune twist
of fate becomes the new tenant.  Much to the chagrin of landlords Vladimir
and Jesus Bianco (Shiek Mahmud-Bey and Jim Sterling) that is, who want him
out so that they can work a scam with a local senator (Robert Vaughn) to
raze the property and build a maximum security federal prison on the lot.</P>
<P>But Joe is in and settling down and discovering that he's got a roommate
problem.  Stuff moves.  Food gets eaten.  The place hums with a chorus of
tiny falsetto voices.  Finally, Joe gets to meet his diminutive uninvited
guests, a veritable army of wise-cracking, vaudevillian cockroaches who
form an immediate kinship with their human lodger on account of his
slobbiness.</P>
<P>These beetles have attitude.  And a code of honor.  And talent, belting out
a variety of "roach songs" throughout the film, from rap to gospel to Busby
Berkeley-inspired production numbers, each one sillier and cornier than the
last.  And the singing cockroaches are also on hand to help Joe win the
heart of the senator's daughter Lily (Megan Ward).  Lily, of course, is
unaware of her unscrupulous, fetishistic father's plans for the site, and
instead dreams of turning it into a community garden.</P>
<P>It's a socially-relevant, environmentally-conscious love story with songs
and bugs.  Lots of bugs.</P>
<P>I had guessed that the inquisitive youth outside the theater would get a
kick out of watching grown men pushing old folk down stairs, picking up
poop, and wearing women's undies.  If I was right, then he certainly
enjoyed spending the afternoon at JOE'S APARTMENT.  If not, at least he
couldn't have been offended by this harmless no-brainer.</P>
