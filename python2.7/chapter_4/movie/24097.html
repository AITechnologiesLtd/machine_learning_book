<P>The history of Jazz music is filled with interesting characters, often
talented and flawed individuals who excel at their skills, but unable
to succeed by normal standards. This is a fictional story presented as
semi-documentary about a supremely talented Jazz guitarist and his
obscure life. On the surface, this appears to be a typical Woody Allen
film, sans Allen as an actor. It features typical Allen elements, a
flawed antihero, love of music, and an examination of the redemptive
value of art.</P>
<P>Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) is a legendary guitarist who is hailed by
aficionados, but generally unknown outside Jazz circles. Because of
his lack of breakthrough success, little is know about his past, and
what is known may be exaggerated, or even false. The structure of the
film is that of a documentary with dramatic recreations. Several music
enthusiasts and historians relate what they know about Ray in talking
head format, and their stories flow into extended dramatic portrayals
without narration.</P>
<P>Ray's story centers around the peak of his career. As an itinerant
musician, he is able to dazzle women and has a different girlfriend in
the different parts of the country. On day on the Atlantic City
boardwalk, he encounters the mute Hattie (Samantha Morton). Although
he is initially not much enamored of her, her quiet character clearly
forms a complement to his outgoing, loud persona. He reluctantly
allows her to accompany him and his traveling band. Eventually, the
renegade artist pays a price for his lack of conscience, but like a
true artist, he never is able to (nor really wants to) reform.</P>
<P>Woody Allen film generally fall into three categories: comedies,
engaging dramas with humor, and engaging dramas without humor. This
film does not fit easily into any of those slots, and this iconoclasm
is not a virtue. The little humor that does exist is very simple and
uninspired. The drama of the film is unmoving. The acting, which is
usually a strong feature of Allen films, is hamstrung by poorly
sketched characters, with the exception of Morton as Hattie.</P>
<P>Not recommended. By Woody Allen standards, this is a bad film. By
general standards, it is merely slow and dull. The drama is not
engaging, and there is little humor. It attempts to examine the
typical Allen antihero, the loutish artist, but it fails to construct
an interesting story.</P>
