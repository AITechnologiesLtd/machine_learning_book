<PRE><HR>                             HOPE FLOATS
                    A film review by Ram Samudrala<HR></PRE>
<P>/Hope Floats/ has some interesting scenes, but is a boring
groan-inducing movie for the most part.  The opening scene, perhaps
the best one in the movie, starts off as a talk show audience delight
in the misery of Birdie Pruitt (Sandra Bullock) who has just learned
that her husband has been cheating with her best friend.</P>
<P>Devastated, Birdie leaves the fast Chicago life and heads back to
Smithville Texas, her home town, with her young daughter Bernice (Mae
Whitman).  Birdie, once elected Queen of Corn three years in a row (an
unparalleled achievement in the history of Smithville), finds single
life difficult to adjust to, particularly when the people she knew in
high school feel free to rub salt in her wounds.</P>
<P>The one exception who appears to treat Birdie normally is Justin
Matisse (Harry Conick, Jr.) who had a crush on her as teen.  If the
story hasn't yet started sounding familiar to you, it should: the
relationship between Birdie and Justin ploddingly progresses to its
obvious end, without any real resolution of issues between Birdie and
her former husband, her daughter, and her high school acquaintances.</P>
<P>The best part in /Hope Floats/ is the presence of young Travis
(Cameron Finley) who mimics animals which makes for some
humour. Other than that, this movie is a total dud.</P>
