<PRE>DEEP IMPACT
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Blame it on sleep deprivation following the impromptu arrival of my
third daughter, Lilla, but I actually enjoyed "Deep Impact."</P>
<PRE>For the most part.</PRE>
<P>Given the lack of depth or significance in the previews, Mimi ("The
Peacemaker") Leder's film looked like it should have been called
"Sub-Compact" rather than "Deep Impact."  But as disaster movies go it's
not bad, and not nearly as disastrous as the endless slew of
end-of-the-world pictures that got rammed down our throats in the seventies.</P>
<P>Those productions, often directed by Irwin Allen, always featured
an all-star cast (often with no-star acting abilities) and concerned some
sizable global warning, usually drawing on various manifestations of those
famed four elements--earth ("Earthquake"), fire ("The Towering Inferno"),
water ("The Poseidon Adventure" and its sequel), and air ("Hurricane")--to
dictate the utter futility of the situation.  After all, you can't put up
much of a fight against Ma nature.</P>
<P>Since the seventies exhausted just about every natural disaster
there was, it's only recently that these kind of audience-grabbers have
returned to the silver screen.  In the last couple of years we've been
subjected to threats by twisters, floods, and (twice already!) volcanoes.
"Deep Impact," too, features a carefully selected all-star cast and, like
1979's "Meteor" (not to mention the upcoming "Armageddon"), a plot
concerning a large chunk of rock hurtling towards Mother Earth.</P>
<P>The difference here is that the deep impact of the title has more
to do with the deep psychological impact surrounding the imminent disaster
than the crash 'n' burn spectacle of it all.  That's a far cry from the
embarrassing squabblings of those familiar faces in, say, Allen's "The
Swarm," or any of the "Airport" movies.</P>
<P>Here, the ensemble cast including Téa Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa
Redgrave, James Cromwell, and Maximilian Schell all turn in decent
performances in the face of likely annihilation.</P>
<P>Leoni is especially good as an ambitious newswoman whose
investigation of a government scandal leads her to stumble over an even
bigger Whitehouse secret: there's a comet bigger than a Buick heading for
earth.  NASA sends up a space crew lead by Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall)
to detonate some nuclear charges and throw the comet off course, but the
implosions create *two* comets that are now heading for earth.  Good going,
Spurgeon!</P>
<P>Actually, this is a clever construct because it allows the visual
effects wizards to show off their technical artistry when the smaller of
the two comets hits.  Not enough to create total mass destruction, but
enough for us to witness a very impressive tidal wave taking out Manhattan.</P>
<P>"Deep Impact" gets a little preachy in the last twenty minutes,
especially Morgan Freeman's closing presidential speech, and I lost count
of how many times someone earnestly said "I love you" backed by a cherubic
James Horner score that finally wears out its welcome.  In addition, some
of the logic leaves a lot to be desired (for example when Leoni encounters
a monstrous traffic jam leaving the city she simply takes the hard
shoulder, which appears not to have occurred to anyone else).</P>
<P>But I'd rather watch a film that places intelligent human
dramas--how people really feel and react to life-threatening situations
like this--above predictable "we're all doomed!" histrionics.  And "Deep
Impact" does that.</P>
