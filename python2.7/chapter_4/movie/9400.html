<PRE>I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)
Review by Larry McGillicuddy
Copyright Larry McGillicuddy </PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of 4)               
Directed by Jim Gillespie                                   
Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan  
Phillipe, Freddie Prinze Jr., Anne Heche, Johnny Galecki    </PRE>
<P>The slasher movie was reborn last year with the success of  
Scream, a clever self aware thriller written by Kevin       
Williamson. Scream was notable for it's characters          
commenting on the very cliches that they found   
themselves placed in. But I think the reason it was so good 
and so successful was that it didn't insult the intelligence
of it's audience. When the slasher movie began to die out in
the late 80's (remember Jason Takes Manhattan?), it was     
because they had hit rock bottom in terms of acting,        
writing, and production values  Kevin Williamson understands
that his audience is smarter than that. His follow up to    
Scream is a smart and terrifying horror movie that works on 
nearly every level.                                         </P>
<PRE>I Know What You Did Last Summer tells the tale of four      
teenagers who party a little too hard one summer night and  
accidentally hit a stranger with their car. Since one of    
them is drunk, they don't want to tell the police. Instead, 
they decide to dump the body in a lake and make a pact to   
keep it a secret amongst them.                              </PRE>
<P>Suddenly it's one year later, and Julie (Hewitt) has come   
home from college. One of the things that makes this movie  
work is that it creates actual characters and gives them a  
few scenes of development. It's alot scarier when a         
character you care about is in danger. Most of this occurs  
here, as the movie depicts how the characters have grown    
apart and never recovered from the incident. Anyways, when  
she arrives home, Julie gets a note that says you know what.</P>
<P>Suddenly, they are all being stalked by an unknown man in a 
fisherman outfit. The lighting and camera work, which hide  
his face, are extremely effective in making this figure very
frightening. The screenplay throws in numerous suspects,    
trying to fool the viewer as to the identity of the killer. 
But this is not a whodunit. It's a slaher flick, and it is  
the best possible example of that genre.                    </P>
<P>The acting is top notch across the board. Jennifer Love     
Hewitt (Scott Wolf is awaiting the next Williamson script)  
is just as good as her Party of 5 co-star Neve Campbell was 
in Scream. Sarah Michelle Gellar, from TV's highly          
entertaining Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has a terrific screen
presence and is a star in the making. And Anne Heche has a  
creepy cameo as the demented sister of the accident victim. 
First time director Jim Gillespie seems like a pro the way  
he creates a spooky atmosphere and hits the viewer with one 
scare after another.                                        </P>
<P>In the old days of slasher movies, they hired actors based  
on who could scream the loudest and who had the biggest     
breasts. During this rebirth, they find talented actresses  
from quality tv shows and seem to actually be auditioning   
for the supporting characters. This movie is told pretty    
straight, and makes no excuses for being a slasher movie.   
This is a good thing, because I am a fan of this genre and  
it's about time talented people started to work in it again.</P>
