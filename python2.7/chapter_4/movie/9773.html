<P>Many of us are admirers, fans and  devotees of Rowan Atkinson on TV. Having
seen the feature "Mr.Bean" I must confess my utter disappointment. "Bean"
is one thing, "Mr. Bean" another. The feature may amuse -- even tickle to
tears -- audiences unfamiliar with Atkinson's TV gems, but for those
gleeful veterans who follow the inspired weekly "Mr. Bean" episodes there's
just no comparison.</P>
<P>American audiences were introduced to Atkinson's mad, sardonic "Blackadder"
series (made for the BBC) some years ago. The combination of very verbal,
acerbic, irreverent and insulting humor, with zany, mock history, physical
farce, was and is unique. Then, doing a 180 degree turn, the amazing
Atkinson became the weird,bumbling (that's an understatement) "Mr. Bean."
The only way to explain him is that, as he seems to get beamed down to
earth, he is really both human and extra-terrestrial. His monumental,
farcical ineptness is expressed in almost entirely speechless sketches,
with superbly funny mumblings, sounds and noises.</P>
<P>Both "Blackadder" and "Mr. Bean" were written by Atkinson and Richard
Curtis, who had They had collaborated before. Curtis was also the
scriptwriter of the feature "Four Weddings and a Funeral" in which Atkinson
has the small, hilarious part as the bumbling clergyman officiating at a
marriage. He also wrote the successful feature "The Tall Guy," starring
Jeff Goldblum (and Atkinson in the supporting cast), directed by comic
actor-writer Mel Smith. So there is a lot of talent in the movie "Bean."
But the picture also confirms that transforming wildly comic and original
TV episodes into features is a bad idea, at least for those who follow the
television items religiously. It has seldom worked, except for Monty
Python.</P>
<P>In "Bean" Atkinson is a security  guard, "the worst employee in the Royal
National Gallery's history." About to be fired, he is rescued (for
arbitrary reasons) by the Chairman of the Board. Simultaneously, the
Gallery has been requested to send to Los Angeles a renowned British
scholar to speak at the inauguration of the "best American painting,"
"Whistler's Mother," just purchased from the French Musee d'Orsay. The
Brits decide (illogically) to dispatch Bean, then give him  a sabbatical,
so as to get rid of him temporarily.</P>
<P>>From the moment Bean steps onto his plane to the film's finale, Atkinson
grunts and  mugs and clowns and grimaces and contorts from top to bottom.
The Atkinson TV aficionados find that the overwhelming majority of
shenanigans are bad, broad and forced. The gags include airplane vomit
bags, urine, laxatives, spit, sneezing stuff, a turkey's rear end, a 2
way-mirror, drunks, more bathroom things, body parts and the like. The last
section's hospital gags -- a delicate genre to start with--are weak. At the
end, Bean's mistaking the giving the finger for a friendly salute, uses it
copiously. Not very funny. Nor is the blindness of the museum people who do
not notice Bean's madness and imposture.</P>
<P>For those who appreciate the punch and vigor of TV's episodes, "Bean" feels
tedious,overlong and synthetic. I counted few good gags, such as Bean
pretending that the painting he is moving is a table on wheels. Or when
Bean -- here exceptionally given a few spoken lines --improvises a short
speech about "Whistler's Mother." Or when he tells Burt Reynolds,the
haughty, millionaire, retired general who purchased the painting:
"Delighted to meet you, Sir." and the General replies "Of course you are."</P>
<P>I saw this film with a smallish audience of more young children than
adults. The kids whooped it up regularly; the adults rarely. I am told that
at a large Saturday night show many grownups were in stitches.I might have
been too, if exposed to the novelty and originality of Bean for the first
time. Do catch "Mr. Bean" and "Blackadder" on PBS or on video.You'll
understand why the movie lets down the Atkinsonphiles.</P>
