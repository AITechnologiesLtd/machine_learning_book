<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>As husband-and-wife actors and screenwriters, Agnes Jaoui and
Jean-Pierre Bacri have been the creative team behind Alain Resnais'
"Same Old Song" and Cedric Klapisch's "Family Resemblances." Here Jaoui
takes on the directing duties as well. This was a smash box office hit
in France and was nominated for and won many top Cesar awards, but lost
out to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" as Best Foreign Film in the
Oscars.</P>
<P>A touching romantic/comedy ensues about diverse people trying to find
love in a cold world. It becomes a matter of taste if love can be won by
Castella (Jean-Pierre Bacri), a bored, married, industrialist tycoon, in
a provincial French city, not far from Paris. He has no taste for
culture, but suddenly finds he's smitten by his cultured new
English-tutor. He fails to notice how much she attracts him as a tutor,
but accidently sees her onstage and falls in love with her as an
actress. She has been hired by his Parisian business consultant Weber
(Guillebon), so that he could learn to talk English directly to all the
international clients he has. The intellectual tutor, the 40ish,
lonely-heart, Clara (Anne Alvaro), feels the pains of not making it big
in the theater and is despondent because she feels her age is starting
to work against her. She is appearing as Berenice in Racine's 17th
century verse play that Castella's overbearing wife Angélique (Millet)
drags him to see because their niece has a bit part in it.</P>
<P>Clara is appalled at how crass her student's taste is and the way he
always seems to say the wrong thing, and how he thinks he can impress
her with his wealth. But he is blind to the way she sees him and
continues to pursue her because he really likes her. He has become
stifled by his interior decorator wife who forces her taste upon him.
She treats her pet dog with more respect than she does him, as she just
loves animals more than she does humans. When he buys a painting from
one of his new artsy theater acquaintances because he likes it, she
refuses to hang it on her precious pink walls.</P>
<P>Weber has also advised that he and his wife get a bodyguard, Frank
Moreno (Gerard Lanvin), and, a chauffeur, Bruno (Alain Chabat), who are
there for around-the-clock service, until he signs his big business deal
with the Iranians. These two are also going through personal problems:
Bruno's girlfriend writes to him that she's been unfaithful to him in
the States. While Frank has slept with as many as 300 women, but does
not trust women because of his bad experiences when he was more
vulnerable and got hurt by love.</P>
<P>When the film isn't telling about Castella's frustrating pursuit of the
dismissive Clara, the story tells of the trusting chauffeur's run in
with a barmaid named Manie (Jaoui), whom he slept with 10 years ago but
doesn't remember. The more experienced bodyguard, a tough ex-cop, also
becomes aware of her and manages to sleep with her; and, though he's
attracted to her and likes her, he's put off that she's so popular with
the men and deals hashish on the side.</P>
<P>The crass Castella is not a mean guy, he's more of a nice guy who's a
twit with a hangdog expression; he doesn't realize that Clara's theater
crowd is taking advantage of his ignorance of the arts to make a fool of
him in the cafe where they regularly meet. Also, he's impatient with his
formal English lessons, wanting them to be more "fun" and feels more
comfortable when it takes place in an English tea restaurant. When he
makes a declaration of love there to Clara, he has shaven off his bushy
mustache because she mentions that she doesn't like mustaches. But he is
still told by her that they have irreconcilible differences, and he
realizes for certain now that he is unhappy with just his comfortable
materialistic life and must try to better himself culturally. Clara
represents that new standard he shoots for.</P>
<P>The charm in this plot less film is that everyone presented is so much
different in lifestyle and yet with all their flaws and differences,
they all have something going for them that might be appealing to
someone else. The story allows us to see each of their points of view
clearly as their character is fully developed; it is so smartly and
subtly done without patting itself on the back, that it becomes a
pleasure to watch such an intelligent presentation on the problems of
love and of one developing taste. And, isn't life all about developing
taste and evolving! The more limited one is, the more limited one's
friendships and love will be! The performers all do a marvelous job of
getting this across and they make the film a joy to see. It's thankfully
a film that has a life of its own and shuns any formulaic way of
resolving this tale, which should only disappoint zombie viewers of
familiar Hollywood love stories.</P>
