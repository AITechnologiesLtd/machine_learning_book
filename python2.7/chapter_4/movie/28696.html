<PRE>JASON'S LYRIC
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Originality is probably the most important characteristic of
any filmmaker that aspires for greatness. Without it the
films rely on formulas and cliches and start looking
indistinguishable from each other. That happens even with
the titles characterised by certain level of social and
political consciousness, and the good example might be given
by 1990s films that chronicled life of black youths in urban
America and often looked too similar to John Singleton's
BOYZ N THE HOOD. In his 1994 debut JASON'S LYRIC director
Doug McHenry tries somewhat different approach.</P>
<P>The plot of this movie is set in Houston's black
neighbourhood and tells the story of two brothers. The older
Jason (played by Allen Payne) is intelligent, and
responsible hard- working young man who rejects promotion
from his television repair shop only in order to be close
and take care of his mother Gloria (played by Suzzanne
Douglass). The other person Jason takes care of is his
younger brother Joshua (played by Bookeem Woodbine), whose
life revolves around petty crime and substance abuse.
Jason's life begins to change after he meets beautiful girl
Lyric (played by Jada Pinkett) and starts romantic
relationship with her. This opens new horizons for Jason and
he begins to think about moving out of the ghetto and
starting a new life. But the concern for his brother and
memories of tragic childhood incident involving his drunken
father Maddog (played by Forest Whitaker) is going to stop
him until it is too late.</P>
<P>The most important thing about JASON'S LYRIC is the script
by Bobby Smith Jr., which almost turns romance into major
plot element. This is quite an interesting approach,
especially for the often misogynist black ghetto sub-genre.
Unfortunately, the idea to have romantic black ghetto film
is compromised from the start, as soon as the character of
Lyric becomes related to the all-too-familiar world of
gangs, violence and local drug lords and the story ends in
rather predictable way for this kind of movies. Another idea
- to give some biblical overtones to the script via Cain vs.
Abel story - is also compromised with the heavy-handed
approach. However, the film is saved with excellent acting
(especially great Forest Whitaker in small but significant
role) and good direction. All in all, JASON'S LYRIC
represents failed yet refreshing experiment that
nevertheless can be seen as a decent film of its own.</P>
