<PRE>Amazing `Sixth Sense'
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>As a part-time reviewer, I can only see one new release a week.  If I'm
lucky, I might see two.  And on this particular week when `The Sixth
Sense' was released, I decided to see `The Thomas Crown Affair' (good
choice) and `Mystery Men' (bad choice).  But three weeks after this
film's release, I see that it is still the #1 film in the country.  It
has already raked in more than $100 million.  And the funny thing is
that I had never even heard any advertisements for this film.  So
obviously, this is a film that is generating huge amounts of business
through word-of-mouth.  Why are throngs of people flocking to see this
film?  I just had to find out for myself.  And, I'm glad that I did.</P>
<P>`The Sixth Sense' begins by introducing us to Malcolm Crowe (Bruce
Willis).  He's a child psychologist that has been bestowed with one of
his field's highest honor for his commitment.  His wife, Lynn (Toni
Collette) quips that it's a commitment that makes his marriage second
priority.  This night is cause for celebration, but an intruder
interrupts his plans.  It's Vincent, a former child patient.  He's
visibly agitated.  He blames Crowe for failing to heal him.  He points
a gun at the stunned Crowe and pulls the trigger and then takes his own
life.</P>
<P>The next fall, we see Crowe healed of his injury, but perhaps still
spiritually wounded.  His next patient is Cole (a wonderful young actor
named Haley Joel Osment).  Cole shows outward signs of isolation,
paranoia, and fear.  In many ways, Cole reminds him of Vincent. 
Healing Cole would also help to heal Crowe's afflicted soul.  Cole is a
very special boy.  We are given hints that he has supernatural powers. 
When his Mom leaves him in the kitchen and returns five seconds later,
she is puzzled to see that all of the drawers and cabinet doors have
been opened.  He has uncanny insight into the history of his school,
which he explains as a place where they hung criminals.  And all of his
photos have a twinkling light that mysteriously appears in the
background.</P>
<P>Crowe is stoical in his approach to Cole.  He asks questions without
being imposing.  However, Cole looks at him with extreme skepticism. 
Up to now, no one has been able to help him.  He's also only about 10,
so he's not very sure about what he wants.  But he does know what he
doesn't want, and that is to not be afraid anymore.  After a tender
rapport is built, he finally confesses that he can see dead people. 
These ghosts walk around like the rest of us, but why they seek out
Cole is as of yet unclear.  With this premise in place, the film takes
on its eerie persona.  Cole is growing more frightful and the audience
sympathizes with him, feeling fear when Cole does.  Time may be running
out for Cole, and he may ultimately become like Vincent if he isn't
healed soon.  However, Crowe's obsession is destroying his marriage. 
Lynn hardly talks to him anymore and she seems to be drifting into an
affair.  </P>
<P>`The Sixth Sense' is like an old-fashioned ghost story.  It is chilling
at times and purposeful throughout.  Young newcomer Osment is the
film's strongest asset.  His mannerisms and delivery are terrific.  He
and Willis connect well and pull off many scenes that require perfectly
timed dialogue.  Willis is very comfortable in his role and gives us a
very likeable character.  But what really did it for me was its ending,
which of course I will not give away.  It added a totally new dimension
to the film and it hits you unexpectedly, but pleasantly, much in the
same way that `The Usual Suspects' concluded.  Perhaps with one of the
strongest endings this year, and as a picture that was much better than
I had expected, this film will reward your time as well as your senses.</P>
