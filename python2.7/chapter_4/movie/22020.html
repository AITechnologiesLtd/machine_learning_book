(Jakob), Gottfried John (Johannes), Daniel Smith (Kraus), Alice Krige
(Lisa), 1995-GB)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Strange is the norm for this exquisitely made first full-length live
action feature from the American-born (they work in London) identical
twins, Stephen and Timothy Quay, who have previously achieved cult
status for their animation films. This dream-like fantasy film, probably
a fairytale story gone amok, filmed in the style of German Expressionism
ala "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari," and most reflective of a Kafkaesque
type of story depicting a man trapped by absurd circumstances and his
mistrust of society, as the film sets a nightmarish tone. It is loosely
based on the novella 'Jakob Von Gunten' by the Swiss author Robert
Walser.</P>
<P>The Institute Benjamenta is a boarding school for servants, where the
lessons are taught by the siblings, the eccentric despot Johannes
Benjamenta (Gottfried John) and the fragile beauty, Lisa Benjamenta
(Alice Krige). She teaches by being repetitive to the point of being
ridiculous and surreal, as the course of study consists of repeating the
lesson over and over, such as the lesson in setting the dining table, as
ritualistically the would-be servants keep repeating in unison what
their ethereal teacher tells them, as she paces back and forth in front
of the blackboard holding onto a pointer made of a deer foot. There are
deer antlers that hang on the walls and pine cones and needles on the
floors of the classroom. The use of deer must hold some symbolic meaning
to the story, but I would only be guessing as to exactly what.The
lessons take place in a dilapidated building, with a creepy looking and
uninviting interior, setting the claustrophobic atmosphere the film
thrives on. The ceilings in the student's rooms are too low to stand up
in (ala Dr. Caligari).</P>
<P>The film follows its story through the eyes of Jakob von Gunten (Mark
Rylance), who is first seen knocking on the school's door and looking
through the peephole at a monkey, as he is about to enroll. He states
that he came to this place-which seems to be cut off in time and
location from the rest of the world- looking for a chance to be of
service to someone in this life. He will remain here until the school
crumbles, as it seems to be coming to a slow but sure end, as the
director announces no more students will be taken in after Jakob.</P>
<P>What is the reality of life if everything can be turned upside down and
what does reality mean, might be some of the things the film is
questioning, that is, if one were looking for a theme to this intriguing
tale, filmed in a grainy black-and-white monochrome, which added to the
film's evocative mood. Another theme might be the Jesus motif, of how
can one be like Christ, a humble servant, in a society that craves order
and for people to know their place in that order. Jakob asks, "Is there
anything Jesus could do for us in this world?" The answer seems to be,
become a servant.</P>
<P>The film succeeds in being a hypnotic work of much visual merit, that is
different in scope and in intention than other films, probably defying
classification into a type of genre it belongs to. There is hardly any
dialogue, and the sparse dialogue that is there, does not seem to be
that pertinent to the story, as the actors recite their lines as if they
were puppets on a string being manipulated by the Quays. The sister
asks, at one point, "Am I living in a fairy tale?"</P>
<P>But it is the aesthetics that seem to count for what are the dramatics
of the film. Its story of the high and the low in status, each accepting
unconditionally their place in society are examined in a most bizarre
fashion in the student's and his master's mannerisms, as all the
repressed students who willingly serve at their master's discretion go
through their eerie robotic movements, and the story has the look of a
spellbinding fairytale.</P>
<P>What is also shown, is how twisted and sexually repressed the siblings
are, him in need of Jakob as his confidante and slave, showing how
fearful he is of life, while she is caressing Jakob's cheeks as if to
comfort herself, but it could also be a tabu romantic gesture toward
Jakob, indicating their separation is due to class differences. And, of
the eight students, Kraus (Daniel Smith) stands out as one wholly
accepting of the arrangement of servant and master, accepting without a
peep of protest the school's dehumanization policy.</P>
<P>The film runs its course with alternating moods of exhileration and
tedium, but proves itself to be visually stimulating overall, with every
scene showing the contrasts between the light and dark of life. There
was also the memorable weird scene in the beginning of the film, where a
face appears distorted through a goldfish bowl.</P>
<P>At the film's conclusion, Jakob questions what he has learned, if he has
really become insignificant, implying that instead of things being a
mystery, such as the face in the gold fish bowl, knowing about things
can be attained by doing what is habitual, as when Kraus teaches him how
to clean the bowl, which is enough for him to learn.</P>
<P>What it all means is subject to one's imagination (so much of the film
is purposely left unclear), as Jakob wrestles with whether he should
rescue Lisa from her melancholy life. But, this unsettling film is,
nevertheless, diverting in a positive intellectual way, even as it is
subject to much speculative interpretation. You can look at it as a
visionary poem or as an allegory on life, either way, the film is
original and stimulating, if one can take the very slow pace of its
camera work and its tenor of dull melancholy and its inconclusiveness
into proper consideration.</P>
<P>The film was stylishly scored by Polish composer Lech Jankowski.</P>
