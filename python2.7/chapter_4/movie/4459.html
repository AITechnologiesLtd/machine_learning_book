<PRE>                             WAITING TO EXHALE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     The good things to be said about WAITING TO EXHALE can be summed
up in a few words:  it has given employment to many black actors as
well as a black director.  Having said that, there is little else good
that merits more than 2 Bytes.</P>
<P>     For instance, of the four starring actresses, three of them are
beautiful in the sense that white people look upon beauty.  I suspect
that blacks look upon them as white beauties with dark skin.  Further,
while it is not written in The Ten Commandments that every film about
blacks should be meaningful in the sense that films by Spike Lee are,
it would still be nice if the film did not have 4 women who, whatever
the reason, smoked, drank, went to bed with men after a slight meeting,
held conversations that were always sexual and whose lives seemed to be
devoted only to finding "a man."</P>
<P>     Where, I kept asking myself, are the role models which the blacks
need?  For years, Savannah (Whitney Houston) has been asking God to
send her a decent man.  Then there is Bernadine (Angela Bassett) whose
husband announces he is leaving her to marry his white secretary.  How
does she deal with it?  She sets his fancy car and clothes on fire.
Robin (Lela Rochon) is business-wise but man-stupid.  Lastly, we have
Gloria (Loretta Devine) who is on the heavy side, the most sensible of
the lot.</P>
<P>     All the women are well-dressed, live in beautifully decorated
apartments.  One wonders how the average black will relate to these
characters?   The normal looking men have the supporting roles:
Gregory Hines, Dennis Haysbert, Mykelti Williamson, Michael Beach and
Leon.</P>
<P>     There is no question that the acting rings true and the directing
is on target but the story . . .</P>
