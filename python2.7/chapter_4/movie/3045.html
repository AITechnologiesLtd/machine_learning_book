<PRE>                           THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Everyone has heard of Kellogg's Corn Flakes and almost everyone
has heard of its home, Battle Creek, Michigan.  But how many knew that
John Harvey Kellogg was also a a doctor, a surgeon, inventor, owner of
a spa and a crusader for "biological living?"  Not only did he invent
corn flakes but he also invented peanut butter and the electric
blanket.  Aside from that, he was a flamboyant flake.</P>
<P>     Some of his proclamations are, to say the least, very much out of
the mainstream of medicine.  "The liver is the only thing standing
between the smoker and death.  Sex is the sewer drain of a healthy
body."  As a strict practitioner of vegetarianism he would often tell
his audience at San (Sanitarium) that "My own stools are gigantic and
have no more odor than a hot biscuit.  An erection is a flagpole on
your grave."</P>
<P>     Will Lightbody (Matthew Broderick) who has been feeling sickly (he
is not getting enough sex) is induced by his wife, Eleanor (Bridget
Fonda), to come to the San for a cure.  She, herself, has been there
several times and it had, she says, done wonders for her.  Hardly has
Will been introduced to Dr Kellogg when he is whisked away to be
cleansed with a series of enemas.</P>
<P>     By this time the comedy is beginning to lose its humor, sinking
more and more into childish nonsense.  With a little more taste and
discretion it could have been an interesting tale about Kellogg.  It
does have a fine cast.  Anthony Hopkins as Kellogg, carrying his role
with complete abandon, is aided by John Cusack, Dana Carvey, Michael
Lerner as well as Fonda and Broderick and a host of others but to no
avail.  Director Alan Parker unfortunately did not know when to lay off
the dung and get on with the main story.  Too bad.</P>
