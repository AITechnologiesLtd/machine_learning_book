<PRE>`South Park' – Traces of Intelligence beneath Landslide of Obscenities
by Homer Yen
(c)1999</PRE>
<P>I've never actually the seen the Comedy Central offering about life in
a ‘mountain redneck town' called South Park.  But it's reputation is
certainly well known as a show filled wall-to-wall with words that moms
would be shocked to hear.  And film always has a way of elevating the
relative tameness found on TV. `South Park: Bigger, Louder and Uncut'
elevates full throttle to the limit.  It couldn't be any more raunchy,
shameless, and obscenity-laden.  Parents beware…if you're children are
asking for a few dollars to go to some art film, you'd better follow
them because they are on there way to see this film.</P>
<P>I'm only sending out this warning because the obscene language goes
beyond excessive.  Yet, there is a definite intelligence at work here
as a vicious social satire about our ever-degenerating culture and
societal norms.  The creators of `South Park' probably realize that
they're pushing the envelope in every scene, and are smart to work in
obvious references that stuff like `South Park' can only do more harm
than good although in the short term, it can be kind of funny.  Witness
for example the first 15 minutes where we meet up with four familiar
foul-mouthed friends (Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny – well, he speaks
with a muffle).  They take some money from their mom under the pretense
that they are going to an art film.  Instead, they bribe a bum to buy
tickets for them to the newly released `R' rated movie called ‘Terrence
and Philip'.  This film is filled with non-stop vulgarity and bathroom
jokes.   In the first five minutes, the `F' word is said umpteen times
while Terrence and Philip commence a song and dance routine where at
precise moments, various people all break wind.  The various tones and
lengths create a pseudo-wind concerto.   I almost laughed, although I'm
ashamed to admit it.  The four young boys soak it all in while all of
the other patrons begin to leave the theatre.  The incredible thing was
that at that exact same moment, the same thing happened in my theatre. 
People got up and left.  To be able to sit through this film really
requires some discipline and open-mindedness.</P>
<P>The kids take everything that they've learned from this film and
proudly go about their elementary school repeating phrases to everyone
from friends to teachers to the principal.  The mothers are all aghast
and take arms against Canada, the country that produced the film. 
Don't blame us…blame those pesky northern neighbors.  The mother's
lobby to execute Terence and Philip as treasonous prisoners of war
while the children contemplate the consequences of their action and
reflect the values that are at stake.  But as with most cartoons that
try to stretch from 30 to 90 minutes, a lot of it loses its razor-sharp
tenacity.  To compensate, there are also sub-plots about little Stan's
infatuation for a fellow female schoolmate (the running joke is that
every time he opens his mouth, he throws up on her face), and the
coming of Satan which will occur if Terrence and Philip are executed.  </P>
<P>`South Park' does tell its story with energy and with song.  In fact,
the structure is much like a traditional musical.  There are a few
catchy tunes such as the introspective `What Would Brian Boitano Do?'
and a catchy, march-like `Blame Canada'.  Most impressive was a
well-orchestrated production number that ably connected all of the
separate plots.  Still, given the frankness of the language and the
non-stop lowbrow humor and wonton destruction, I can't, with any sense
of integrity, recommend this film.  However, I did think that this film
held together better than Wild Wild West.  And in a few instances,
there were flashes of wisdom and intelligence that really made me take
notice (the undertones of freedom of speech and the blind reckless
abandon to which overprotective mothers defend their children, for
example).  If you do see it, prepare to be shocked.</P>
