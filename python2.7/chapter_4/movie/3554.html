<PRE>                                BLOWN AWAY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<PRE>     A summer action movie with Tommy Lee Jones.  How can it miss?</PRE>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones is an Irish terrorist and a mad bomber.  Jeff
Bridges is the most brilliant and daring member of the Boston bomb
squad, but he is a burn out case who is retiring.  Suzy Amis plays Jeff
Bridges always about to be killed wife.  Lloyd Bridges plays the wise
old man.</P>
<P>     This movie features lots of gigantic explosions.  If you are from
Boston, you will love the many nice scenes shot on location there.
Very picturesque cinematography (Peter Levy).  Other than as a guide to
pyrotechnics or as a travelogue, the only compelling reason to see the
show is Tommy Lee Jones.  He tries his darndest to shine in a bad
movie, and although it is one of the weakest acting jobs I have seen
from him, he is still interesting to watch.</P>
<P>     Jeff Bridges is an actor who can be pretty pathetic sometimes.
This was one of them.  He was either whining through most of the show
or being mister macho - willing to put his family and crowds of
hundreds of people at risk.  If a mad bomber was after your family, you
would not want to share credit in their rescue by asking for any backup
would you?  Of course not.</P>
<P>     Lloyd Bridges's character was not much, and he did not do much
with it.  Suzy Amis played a caricature of the poor little wife who
needed her husband to save her all of the time, and who could not see
danger when it was staring her and her daughter right in the face.</P>
<P>     The plot had few twists and could have been written as the term
project by anyone taking screen writing 101 at their local community
college.  The script (Joe Bateer, John Rice and M. Jay Roach) features
l-o-n-g slow parts followed by tedious action sequences.</P>
<P>     The director (Stephen Hopkins) has the actors mumble most of the
dialog.  Jeff Bridges is especially good at this.  This means that you
will not have to bother hearing a fair amount of what they say.  This
is aided by having the sound editor make the background noise
frequently much louder than the actor's speech.  Listen to them pouring
the wine at the restaurant; it sounds like they are filling a bathtub.
Their talking however is very muted.  Given the gibberish of the script
you can look upon this as a real blessing of course.</P>
<P>     The movie gets a well deserved R rating and lasts for a tediously
long 2:00.  For the brilliance of casting Tommy Lee Jones, I award it *
and recommend you neither see nor rent this movie.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
