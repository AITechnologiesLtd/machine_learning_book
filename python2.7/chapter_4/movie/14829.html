<P>   "We set out to change the world," laments Curt Wild (Ewan
McGregor) to New York Herald journalist Christian Bale
(Arthur Stuart), "and ended up changing only ourselves." 
"What's wrong with that?" the reporter responds
understandably.  "Nothing...if you don't look at the world."  At
that point, toward the conclusion of the strikingly colorful and
often surreal "Velvet Goldmine," cinematographer Maryse
Alberti (who has the most enviable job on the filmmaking
team) spins the camera to look at the seedy bar in which Bale
finds the wrecked, former rock star.  Staring back is a
defeated-looking band of losers surrounding by the bleak,
somber tones of the run-down establishment.  The date is
1984, and Todd Haynes--who wrote and directed the
panoramic meditation on the birth and death of a musical
era--portrays a civilization that has become an Orwellian bad
dream.  </P>
<P>   Using a Citizen-Kane format, Haynes deals with the
circumscribed number of years from 1969 to 1974 that
witnessed the phenomenon of glam rock, a London-based
sensation driven by the musicial artistry of personalities like
David Bowie and Iggy Pop.  His work captures the
atmosphere of the era in its days of consequence, lamenting
the passing of glam rock in far more colorful way than Whit
Stillman laid out the last days of disco in his own 1998 film.</P>
<P>   The story opens with the birth of Oscar Wilde in 1854, a
man who might have predicted during his lifetime that the
glittering age of rock would come to fruition.  In the season of
his youth he was asked by his teacher what he wanted to be.
Young Oscar knew even then that he was not destined to
become a truck driver or a physician like his classmates but
rather "a pop idol."  Wilde was said to have favored a society
that would kick conventionality in the butt, so it's no wonder
that Haynes chose to honor the memory of that great literary
figure by calling one of his two principals Curt Wild.  Wild,
together with glam-rock artist Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-
Meyers), are the stand-ins for Bowie, Iggy Pop and others
that made the early seventies one of the most exciting times
for a young person with the slightest sense of rhythm,
rebelliousness and optimism.</P>
<P>   Christian Bale is assigned by the editor of the New York
Herald to write a rock feature for a weekend edition of the
choosing him because Bale was a frequent member of the
glam-rock audience some ten years earlier.  He proceeds not
only to interview people who were close to Slade and Wild: he
envisages himself as an active, swinging participant in the
festivities-- in effect giving director Haynes the green light to
capture the atmosphere of the era as no filmmaker had done
before him.  (Strangely enough to this day there are no
definitive books about the period.)  We discover that the glam-
rock stars and their groupies had contempt for the music
favored by the hippies, indulging instead in extravagant
costumes and riotous makeup, while still gratifying themselves
with an excess of sex.  Bisexuality was not only tolerated; it
was the "in" thing to be, or at least to declare yourself to be. 
As Brian Slade announces that he's interested in the human
body--male or female it makes no difference--his wife Mandy
(Toni Collette) stands by him, feigning a smile, an American
who had become a London party girl and is determined to fit
into the mold of total liberation.</P>
<P>   As Haynes takes us through an almost predictable chain of
events--Slade is discovered by a promoter who is soon
displaced by the more media-savvy Jerry Divine (Eddie
Izzard), becomes obsessed and sexually involved with the
more flamboyant American Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor),
becomes involved with cocaine and, desiring ultimately to
drop out and renege on his contract, he falls victim of a false
assassination which is considered a publicity stunt and
disappears from the scene.  He leaves behind a broken-
spirited wife and a horde of disappointed fans.</P>
<P>   A movie about the nature of pop-star idol-worship,
reminiscence, and sentiment, "Velvet Goldmine" is stunningly
acted in an over-the-top fashion by the wonderful Ewan
McGregor as the more dashing Curt Wild, leading Jonathan
Rhys Meyers' performance as Slade to appear almost
restrained by contrast.  Haynes flashes back and forth from
1984 to 1974 as though to reinforce Brian's dictum that we all
have "freedom...freedom that you could allow yourself or not." </P>
<P>    "Velvet Goldmine" is in a way the opposite of Haynes'
eccentric movie "Safe," about a woman who is so repressed
that she is virtually allergic to life itself, and seeks help in a
Western ashram presided over by a would-be guru.  Yet the
two films share the director's interest in extremes, in living on
the edge: "Safe" could be almost a caricature of modern,
antiseptic, contained society while "Velvet Goldmine" portrays
a world order of a wholly antithetical kind, the sort of orb that
Oscar Wilde would have imagined and loved.  "We were living
in a dream and it went away," bemoans Slade's wife, who is a
burnt-out case ten years after the end of this era.  While the
challenging "Velvet Goldmine" is not for every taste, the film--
which was the most discussed and anticipated offering at the
recent Cannes festival--is itself a dream.  See it before it goes
away.</P>
