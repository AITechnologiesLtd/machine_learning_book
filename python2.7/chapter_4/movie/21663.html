<PRE>The Pokemon Movie</PRE>
<P>Capsule review:  Big build-up at the beginning to a big snore at the
end.   I give it a probably overly generous two stars, only because I
so recently suffered through Elmo in Grouchland to which Pokemon seems
like Shakespear in comparison.</P>
<P>Ok, so like every other kid under eleven, my daughter absolutely had
to see Pokemon The First Movie as soon as it came out.  And so, armed
with our popcorn and tooth-decaying drinks, we sit in the third row
and stare up at 20 foot high animated toys.  Heigh-ho.</P>
<P>The movie is divided up into two segments, a short called something
like "Pikachu's Vacation", and the main attraction Mewtwo Strikes
Back.</P>
<P>The less said about Pikachu's Vacation, the better.  Most of the
pokemon don't speak, you understand, except to say their own names
with various inflection.  I suppose this is so you can tell the
200-odd creatures apart.  I recognized maybe four of them, which shows
how woefully short I am on Pokemon lore.</P>
<P>A long dreary time later, the real movie starts.</P>
<P>The first ten minutes of Mewtwo Strikes Back, before the beginning
credits, are actually fairly engrossing.  The origin of Mewtwo is
interesting, the voice talents are very well done, and the animation
is first rate.</P>
<P>Then, after the credits, we degenerate into rather mundane tv-quality
animation and a very plodding plot.  The action picks up as the
Pokemon trainers attempt to get to an island arena through a heavy
storm, but things get uninteresting again soon after.  We learn that
the villain of the piece is Mewtwo (big surprise) and the plot slowly
builds up to the inevitable confrontation between Mewtwo and his
Pokemon against the Pokemon of the trainers.  Somewhere along the line
a Mew pokemon joins the good guys.</P>
<P>If you saw the commercials you know all of this.  The trailer of the
film covers the entire plot up to the square-off for the climactic
battle.  You sat through an hour of plodding, uneven plot and mediocre
animation to get to this point.  So what happens?  What's the final
pay-off?</P>
<P>What happens is that the film falls on it's flabby animated butt.  No
battle of any consequence occurs.  Instead, all the pokemon are
rendered powerless through Nonsensical Plot Device and must resort to
bitch-slapping each other until through exhaustion they can no longer
move their various appendages.  Then the trainers suddenly decide that
Fighting Is Bad and everyone kisses and makes up.  And the audience is
left with their mouths hanging open going "What the hell was that??"</P>
<P>There's not much else to say, except that I could not figure out the
purpose of Jesse and James of "Team Rocket".  Perhaps there is some
other Pokemon movie that explains their existence and motives.  They
didn't seem to serve any purpose or have any goals.  They just
stumbled about opening doors, sitting on things and getting
frightened.</P>
<P>Pokemon rates a very generous two stars for the very nice Origin of
Mewtwo sequence.  I'm tempted to subtract a star for that nonsensical
ending, but I hesitate only because of a nagging doubt that this was
the real, unedited ending as it came from Japan.  I have to wonder if
the flatness was specifically designed to appeal to what they imagine
that American children want to see.  If so, I'd be insulted.</P>
