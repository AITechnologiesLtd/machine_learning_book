<P>PLOT:
A boy who gets dumped by the love of his life can't seem to get over her.
While she's moved on to the next guy, he still tries to win back her heart.
In the meantime, another girl likes him for what he is, but blinded by the
love for his ex-girlfriend, the boy does not notice her. Of course, sparks
fly all around when the whole gang join in the school's theatre production
and strands of truth begin to surface.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
What can I tell you...I was entertained! A cute, fun teen flick with many
scene-stealing moments from the incomparable Martin Short, an upbeat
soundtrack, believable performances from its leads and a predictable, yet
charming, romance angle. Believe you me when I tell you that I wasn't really
looking forward to seeing this movie. The first two months of this year had
jaded me in respect to bad teen and romance flicks altogether, and this
movie didn't seem to have much going for it. But low and behold, there I
was, laughing and giggling my way through this surprisingly potent vehicle
for the teen generation. This movie is a lot like SHE'S ALL THAT and 10
THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. It's entirely predictable, it's based on a more
renowned dude's writings (this one plays off Shakespeare's A MIDSUMMER
NIGHT'S DREAM), and is obviously set in high school. But the difference
between this and most other crappy teen movies is that this one actually
comes across as a fun ride, with little more on its mind than entertaining
its audience. Does the film have its problems? Absolutely. For one, it
unfortunately includes a couple of recycled jokes from other movies like the
girl getting hit by a car and flying through the air (SCARY MOVIE) and the
clutzy blonde chick who keeps bouncing into things (HEAD OVER HEELS).</P>
<P>Also, I simply could not get past the fact that two of the supposed
"teenage" actresses in this film looked like they were in their 30s. I
mean...really! (for those who care, I'm referring to Allison and the clumsy
girl). And the final act of the film, which essentially comes down to a
major school play, just went a little longer than I thought was needed. I
mean, did we really have to sit through 3-4 songs from the play itself? But
these were really small issues for me, and for the most part, I can't say
that I wasn't entertained by this movie. In fact, pretty much every word
that came out of Martin Short's mouth was funny to me. I don't know, maybe
it's just me, but his character definitely took this film to that "other
level". But the rest of the kids were pretty good, too. Sisqo did what he
does best, Tom Hanks' son was pretty solid as the best friend, the lead kid,
Ben Foster, played his character quite sympathetically and Kirsten
Dunst...well, looked great! Okay, she was pretty good in her role, too. And
geez, let's not forget Foster's parents in the movie, Swoosie Kurtz and Ed
Begley Jr. Very small parts but very funny characters. In fact, most of the
side players in this film made it a stronger one as a whole. Besides Carmen
Electra, who for some reason or another decided that a 10-second spot as a
leathered-up stripper in this film would be good for her career?!</P>
<P>Anyway, if you like cute boy-loves-girl, girl-dumps-boy, boy-wants-her-back
while another-best-friend-type-girl-wants-boy-also movies (oh, that again?),
then you'll enjoy this one. It's light, it's got a few "gross" jokes but
mostly solid humor with some nice touches from the director and a fun
soundtrack. All in all, an enjoyable time at the theatre. And who knows,
some of you adults might like it, too.</P>
<P>Where's JoBlo coming from?
