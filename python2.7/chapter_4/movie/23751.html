<P> It is bad enough when you have a ninety-minute film that feels like two
hours, but when you have a 61-minute film that feels like two hours, you
know you're in trouble.  Such is the case with Chef!, a disorganized
documentary probing the injustices in the society of Cameroon.</P>
<P> Chef! is a film that uses a personal narrative to tell us three things
that we already know: that lynching isn't a good idea, that patriarchal
marriages suck eggs, and that dictatorships are unjust institutions.
These three things add up to another simple general impression: that you
can't get any sort of justice in the society of Cameroon.</P>
<P> Were Chef! a straight forward narrative film, I would bash it for
meandering its way to a stopping point (note: not an end, this film does
not end).  As a documentary, I must be slightly more creative and state
that the film is disorganized.  Each type of injustice takes about
twenty minutes of time and has no sort of transition into the next
injustice.  A good documentary should flow like an academic
conversation, and Chef! has all of the controlled flow of a series of
CNN factoids.</P>
<P> Chef! serves to somewhat redeem itself by having a nice flow inside of
each subsection.  The subjects are captured and edited well, so that,
when all is said and done, a sense of moribund comedy resounds around
the society of Cameroon.  Sadly, these `jokes' are mostly unintentional,
and are come too little too late to save a documentary that has no
concept of pacing or organization.</P>
