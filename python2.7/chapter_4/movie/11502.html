<P>HUSH
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *½ (out of ****) 
TriStar / 1:32 / 1998 / PG-13 (language, violence, brief nudity, sexuality)
Cast: Jessica Lange; Gwyneth Paltrow; Johnathon Schaech; Nina Foch; Debi Mazar; 
Hal Holbrook; Richard Lineback; Kaiulani Lee 
Director: Johnathan Darby 
Screenplay: Johnathan Darby; Jane Rusconi <HR>Call "Hush" "Stop or My Mom Will Kill." Or "Mommy Fearest." Or "The Hand That 
Robs the Cradle." Call it whatever you want, but certainly don't see it unless 
you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "Hush" scores so many 
unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure. Chalk its 
losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering 
(it was supposed to open about a year ago), the latter of which appears to have 
given "Hush" a send-off that's downright infuriating. It's too bad that "Hush" 
is so laughable, because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of 
Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange -- is nothing to laugh at. </P>
<P>Paltrow and Johnathon Schaech play Helen and Jackson, a photogenic New York 
couple on their way to spend Christmas vacation at his wealthy, well-to-do 
family's horse farm/estate Kilronan. Jackson's mother Martha (Lange) runs 
Kilronan all by herself, and her genteel Southern hospitality makes Helen feel 
welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with Martha takes place while 
Helen is in the altogether, caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her 
husband-to-be. But it seems that Martha's friendly smile masks a much more 
threatening demeanor; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much. Martha 
eagerly, deviously wants a grandchild, and then Helen will be expendable, as far 
as she's concerned. </P>
<P>If there's one reason to catch "Hush," it's Lange. She treats the pedestrian 
screenplay better than it deserves to be treated, injecting Martha (poorly 
written though she may be) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing 
field. When she delves into Martha's dark side, predictable cliches -- 
chain-smoking, staring in mirrors, praying in a confessional to a priest who 
isn't there, poking a hole in Helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant (and 
she does) -- abound, but it's moderately entertaining junk because Lange is such 
an interesting actress to watch. Veteran performer Nina Foch is smart and tart 
as Jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother. The rest of the cast looks 
ill and uncomfortable, especially Paltrow. But can you really blame them? </P>
<P>The character relationships in "Hush" hold a certain amount of promise, at least 
until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity. 
Idiotic situations (Martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock 
Helen over) compliment idiotic dialogue ("Why did you yell?" Helen yells back at 
Martha), and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the 
blank-from-hell flicks ever made. You can see through a great deal of Martha's 
actions and lies from their conception; why do people who have known this woman 
for years longer than we have never figure things out? Does nobody communicate 
or read the newspaper in this town? If any of her potential victims thought, 
acted or behaved like normal people,"Hush" would be a really short movie. </P>
<P>And then there's the climax and ending, which abruptly come when Helen starts 
having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing 
drug normally used on horses. After a really weird chase scene, Martha calmly 
knits in a rocking chair while forcing Helen to give birth in a bed all by 
herself. I won't spoil what happens next except to say that it's contradictory, 
illogical and (probably, since I'm no doctor) medically impossible. The final 
scene offers no closure, no resolution, no confrontation whatsoever. It's just 
there, dangling amidst silent displeasure. No one should like this ending, 
regardless of their feelings on the preceding material. Perhaps "Hush"'s title 
is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting 
the theater. <HR>© 1997 Jamie Peck

Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" -- Roger Ebert on "Look
