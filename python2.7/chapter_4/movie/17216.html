<P>Director Ulu Grosbard has only made seven movies in the last thirty one
years and one of them is 'The Deep End of the Ocean'.  Grosbard's career
began in 1968 with 'The Subject Was Roses' when he directed Jack
Albertson to an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  The first film I saw
in a theatre directed by him was 'True Confessions' in 1981.  His other
four films are 'Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those
Terrible Things About Me?' (1971), 'Straight Time' (1978), 'Falling in
Love' (1984), and 'Georgia' (1995).  Grosbard's style is very leisurely
and his films have a tendency to look like television projects so why is
'The Deep End of the Ocean' such a wonderful film?  Because in many
ways, it breaks your way of thinking when it comes to having children.
Some people really want children but find the idea of raising them to be
a scary thought.  Others have no problem with it while others live
through the nightmare of losing them and not knowing for sure what
happened to them.  This is what happens to an average American family in
a movie that has no high or low points that stand out above the rest of
its running time and while the performances are solid, the story is
cleverly told mainly from the perspective of only one parent.</P>
<P>The film begins in Madison, Wisconsin in 1988.  Beth (Michelle Pfeiffer)
and her husband Pat (Treat Williams) are an average couple whose three
children range in approximate age from six months to three and seven.
Pat leaves for a business meeting in Chicago while Beth is to attend her
high school reunion.  While she's there, her three year old becomes
separated from her and no one can find him.  The usual panic sets in
complete with the trauma that will be experienced by any mother with
feelings in such a predicament.  Beth even becomes hysterical at one
point and has to be restrained and sedated by paramedics.  The story
then jumps ahead nine years and as her children have grown older, so has
Beth's memory.  She thinks about her son missing son Ben everyday and
looks very unhappy with life and her husband tells her she's made a
career out of looking unhappy.  Beth's feelings have interfered with her
marriage and her eldest son Vincent (Jonathan Jackson) has become
something of a teenage delinquent who likes mischief with cars.  One
day, Beth's daughter Kerry (Alexa Vega) talks to a boy at the front door
whom she knows that wants to know if the lawn needs mowing and Beth
comes to the door and instantly recognizes him as an older version of
her missing son.  Through a re-opened police investigation led by
Officer Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), the boy turns out to be Ben (Ryan
Merriman) who goes by the name Sam and he is re-united with his
biological family but doesn't remember who they are.  The adjustment is
not easy and this is the central point of the film and how things become
resolved.</P>
<P>On the surface, you have to give this film credit for its original
subject matter.  An idea that is excellent in its conception and pretty
well executed.  It's written by Stephen Schiff based on the best selling
novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard.  I had a problem with the odds in which the
boy is re-united with his family.  Could they be in the millions?
Billions?  Certainly a stretch in credibility damages the film's
character and this is the key to enjoying the film as to whether or not
you can overlook this flaw.  Another factor that seemed out of place was
the re-action Ben's siblings have to the news of his return.  Not as
delighted as the parents are and their lives just go on as if very
little has changed.  Perhaps it's just in their nature and I suppose
this argument is borderline in making a case for the movie but I
genuinely felt moved by the story and the film is perfect for the
average movie goer who doesn't see a lot of movies and it doesn't insult
your intelligence the way many films released this time of year do.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the performance of Treat Williams in this film.  Mainly an
under rated actor, he is diverse in his roles and I enjoyed him since I
first saw his work as a corrupt cop in 1981's 'Prince of the City'.
Although 'The Deep End of the Ocean' is told mainly from Pfeiffer's
point of view as the parent responsible for her son's disappearance,
Williams plays a good supporting role and the husband and wife team
these actors play, they manage to distinguish themselves from each other
and that is the film's most impressive offering.  As the film looks for
resolution in the final twenty minutes, it reminds us that the most
wonderful thing in the world can indeed be to have children and one of
the worst things can be losing them.  'The Deep End of the Ocean' is a
film that will make you want to hug your kids just a wee bit longer the
next time you prepare them and send them off for the day to school.</P>
