<P>The darkest children's film since the Babe sequel, A Dog of Flanders is
an early 19th century Belgian story of arson, animal cruelty, children
born out of wedlock, drinking, and corruption.  It has little to do with
the titular dog, but instead concentrates on a young boy's quest to
become the next big thing in the northern European art world.  It is not
– I repeat – not about a new dog for Bart's neighbors Rod and Todd.</P>
<P>The boy is Nello, a lad whose mother was lost to a blinding snowstorm
when he was two (nobody knows who his father is).  Raised by his weary,
dirt poor grandfather Jehan Daas (Jack Warden, Dirty Work), Nello helps
out by running milk into town everyday.  Like his mother, Nello (played
here by Jesse James, Message in a Bottle, who appears to be the missing
Hanson brother) also has a talent for sketching with charcoal.  One day,
he finds a large Bouvier des Flanders – a breed of hard working dog –
that was beaten and left for dead in the woods near Nello's home.
Naming him Patrasche (his mother's middle name), Nello nurses the
bear-like pooch back to health and Patrasche is soon helping the boy
with his milk runs.</P>
<P>Flash to a few years later, where Nello (now played by Jeremy James
Kissner, the young Finn from Great Expectations and a dead ringer for
Leelee Sobieski's younger brother) is coached by a local artist named
Michel LaGrande (Jon Voight, Varsity Blues).  LaGrande takes Nello to
see a work done by another great local artist named Peter Paul Rubens.
At first, I thought this was a cross between the guy who invented the
Mounds bar and Pee-Wee Herman.  But it turns out that LaGrande meant the
Belgian Flemish artist from the 1600s and convinces Nello to enter the
`Junior Rubens' art contest open to local youth.</P>
<P>Nello's best friend Aloise (Madylin Sweeten, Everybody Loves Raymond)
models for Nello's pieces, despite her father's warnings to keep away
from his daughter, especially after Nello is blamed for torching his
flour mill.  The two children still manage to sneak off to a circus,
where they share their first kiss and a dance straight from Titanic.</P>
<P>Despite the film's high body count and It's a Wonderful Life-ish ending
(where Nello almost meets the same Little Match Girl fate as his
mother), Flanders is a warmly glowing picture.  Gritty costumer Beatrix
Aruna Pasztor, who worked on the last six Gus van Sant films, and
cinematographer Walther van den Ende (The Eighth Day) both deserve
special recognition.  The small town's center is reminiscent of Jude,
with its main character seeming to be threatened by the heavy stones
that constitute just about everything in sight.</P>
<P>Based on a popular children's story, Flanders is adapted and directed by
Kevin Brodie (Treacherous), with television veteran Robert Singer
helping script this film version.  The ideas in the film seem a little
scattered – Warden disappears for about 45 minutes in the middle - and
runs a bit long.  It seems to not know where it's going or care how long
it takes to get there, but instead concentrates on looking good – which
isn't a bad thing at all.  (1:40 - PG for more violence than you would
ordinarily find in a children's film, as well as many deaths)</P>
