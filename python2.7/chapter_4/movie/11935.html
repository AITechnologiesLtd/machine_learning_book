<PRE>Two Girls and a Guy (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Writer-director James Toback's low-budget, high-concept three-character
(OK, there's really _five_ characters, but two of them only appear in the
first scene) drama is not nearly as provocative as its title or
much-publicized ratings troubles suggests.  The two girls are sensible
blonde Carla (Heather Graham) and streetwise brunette Lou (Natasha Gregson
Wagner), who find out they share the same guy, Blake (Robert Downey Jr.),
while waiting for him outside his apartment building.  Understandably
upset, the two break into his apartment and wait to confront him, hoping to
find out and understand why someone would resort to such duplicity.</P>
<P>At about the half-hour mark, just about all that can be argued about has
been, and Toback attempts to jumpstart the proceedings with a lengthy,
fairly tasteful, and rather gratuitous sex scene (sorry to disappoint, but
if you're looking for any menage action, watch Wild Things) that had to be
recut multiple times in order for the film to receive an R rating.  It
doesn't work.  More talk follows, about Blake's obsession with his mother,
about the possibilities of a three-way relationship, about the women's own
fidelity.  But any true insight into the nature of contemporary romantic
relations never arrives, as well-acted as this bona fide screen play is.

<P>"I didn't know what to expect. It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.  I still don't know how to react."
