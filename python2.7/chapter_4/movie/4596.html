<P>     Moor is less in this new adaptation of the "Bill" Shakespeare
classic.  Veteran stage actor Oliver Parker, who's making his feature
film debut, is aiming for mass appeal.  He's excised almost half of the
original text, included plenty of sex and violence, and recorded the
whole thing in big, booming stereo sound.  For the leads, he's cast a
few good faces:  Laurence Fishburne as the Big Guy, French actress Irene
Jacob (RED) as Desdemona, and Kenneth Branagh as Iago.  It all sounds
good on paper, and, for the first few scenes, it almost works.</P>
<P>     The biggest problem is Fishburne, who's flat.  He has the look and
can deliver the lines, but he never burns with the fire that the role
requires.  Jacob, a lovely presence, stumbles a bit through her Eliz-
abethan English, while Branagh has a jolly olde time talking to and
winking at the camera.  The artist formerly known as Mr. Emma Thompson
is clearly in his element, even if he has about twelve too many asides.
(Parker's loose direction doesn't help, especially when we can't tell if
Branagh is talking to himself, to us, or to someone off-screen.) If you
really want to brush up your Shakespeare, go rent Orson Welles' superior
1952 version.</P>
