<PRE>Among Giants **1/2</PRE>
<PRE>rated R
starring Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Griffiths, James Thornton
written by Simon Beaufoy
directed by Sam Miller</PRE>
<P>When Fox Searchlight Pictures picked up Sam Miller's AMONG GIANTS,
they were probably hoping to once again cash in on the golden touch of
Academy Award nominated British screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, who, with
THE FULL MONTY, gave the small indie company it's first megahit. What
they knew, but didn't care to realize, was that Beaufoy wrote the
AMONG GIANTS script before he wrote THE FULL MONTY.  So instead of a
sequel to the hilarious antics of the latter, we get a weak romance,
held together only by exceptional performances by the two leads, Pete
Postlethwaite and Academy Award nominee Rachel Griffiths, showing that
her vital, restrained work in HILARY AND JACKIE was no fluke.</P>
<P>The 50ish Postlethwaite plays Ray, a divorced man who is currently
painting power lines for money. In the working class town of
Sheffield, the main attraction is mountain climbing, which is how he
meets Gerry(Griffiths), a hitchiker who wants to see if the climbing
is really as good as advertised. The audience never learns a thing
about Gerry's past, which makes her character somewhat
two-dimensional. Anyway, the boyish Gerry ends up joining Ray's
painting crew, and the camera pans back into some beautiful shots of
the crew working on the power lines, high above the rest of the world.
>From then on, there isn't much plot except for the inevitable
accident, and we just have to sit back and let the romance between Ray
and Gerry happen. By just looking at the two, you can already deem the
romance unconventional. But there never is much going on, and
Postlethwaite is always believable no matter what his age, so the
movie basically moves along, though flimsily.</P>
<P>The only thing ironic about AMONG GIANTS is how the film is so weak,
but we cease to notice it because of the simple gestures of the two
lead actors. This is essentially Postlethwaite's film, and he gives a
quietly moving performance as the man who is vulnerable to love, but
Griffiths more than holds her own as the woman who just doesn't want
to commit to anything. It's also quite odd that the man who wrote this
film is the same man who wrote THE FULL MONTY, because I can't find
too many similarities except for some full frontal nudity. AMONG
GIANTS is not a bad film, but good intentions can only get you so far.</P>
