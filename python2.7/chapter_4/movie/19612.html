<P>   In one of the great, adult, sci-fi movies of our time, Michael
Anderson's 1976 hit "Logan's Run" starring Michael York,
Peter Ustinov and Farah Fawcett Majors, the people active
during the year 2174 lead lives of unending pleasure.  One
catch: at age 30 they are extinguished, kaput.  The fable is
an obvious one: our own world treats people past 30 as over
the hill, and so it's no wonder that the character in Robert
Meyer Burnett's surprisingly effective "Free Enterprise" point
out that they expect their bodies to start falling apart as they
approach their fourth decade of life.  "Free Enterprise" is a
series of Saturday-Night-Live type skits, though the episodes
are bound together in a fairly tight manner, all revolving
around two 29-year-olds who are confirmed fans of the 30-
year-old TV series "Star Trek."  </P>
<P>   Why did I find the picture a pleasurable surprise?  I had
been led to believe that one had to be hard-core sci-fi fan to
appreciate it and that at best, the non-devotee would smile at
some of the jokes while being embarrassed by the belly
laughs of the true disciples seated around the theater.  If
you're a movie fan in general, though, that's quite enough.  In
fact even if you go to only film a month, you'll find diversion
in focusing on the sharp, edgy conversations between two
Trekkies, Robert (Rafer Weigel) and Mark (Eric McCormack),
whose first names parallel those of the director and writer of
the movie for good reason.  An semi-autobiographical tale
recounting the delayed coming of age of one successful
journalist and one not-so-thriving guy working for a production
company, "Free Enterprise" is an ode to L.A., to the cinema,
and most of all to the enduring power of friendship.</P>
<P>   Both Robert and Mark are Peter Pan types who at age 29
are still talking about the bimbos and others they've been
dating and who wonder why they cannot connect with
women.  Mark is the more down-to-earth fellow, a
bespectacled, hard-working dude who is called upon to lend
large sums of money to his less flourishing friend, Robert.
Both enjoy the pleasures of the flesh with some of
California's more liberated women, meeting little resistance to
their sexual overtures--though in a hilarious scene, Mark,
running into a brief lack of compliance from his German-
American date, wins her over with the line, "Considering what
your people did to my people during World War II, I'd
consider a little breast fondling a minor reparation."  The
financially challenged Robert seems to spend all his money
on laser discs, carrying a home library of every sci-fi movie
ever made, and meets the woman of his dreams, Claire
(Audie England), in a comic-book emporium. They discover
that they like exactly the same literature and films, with
Robert as surprised as any that Claire does not consider
such fiction to be a guy thing.</P>
<P>   Their lives come to a crossroads when they meet their idol,
William Shatner (played by William Shatner), the hero of the
Star Trek series, who performed in the role of starship
Captain James T. Kirk.  By discovering that Shatner--whom
they first spot browsing at the centerfold of a porno
magazine--has as many problems and insecurities as they,
the young men feel that they are not at all unique in their
difficulties, both ultimately coming to terms with the angst of
their age.  The awkwardness of their initial meeting is to be
repeated in the unpolished manner with which they meet
women.  "You're the greatest American actor," purrs Robert
looking for a way to break the ice, to which the Star Trek
hero responds while backing off, "I'm Canadian."  "Then
you're the greatest Canadian actor," counters Robert, to
which the great man answers, "There aren't that many."  The
three become good friends, the younger men even advising
their icon how to pick up girls.</P>
<P>   Since "Free Enterprise" does not display retreads of any
sci-fi episode save for a quick installment involving a "Logan's
Run" dream, the emphasis is not on the world of movies but
on the young men themselves.  In the roles of this
dysfunctional but exceptionally sharp duo, Rafer Weigel and
Eric McCormack keep the audience on their toes, the sci-fi
enthusiasts gloating over their recognition of the name-drops,
the others enjoying the sexual and other escapades of the
principals.  Shatner is a good sport in his self-deprecatory role: 
he announces his plan to make a six-hour musical out of Julius 
Caesar with him in all roles except that
of Calpurnia--for whom he wants to cast either Sharon Stone
or Julia Roberts.  The movie's final scene showing Shatner
pitching in with rapper Rated R in a rap monologue of Marc
Antony's speech is an embarrassment, but there will be
viewers who'd consider this the movie's highlight.  All in all
"Free Enterprise" is a worthwhile entry in the large pool of
coming-of-age comedies, bound to be a hoot for Trekkies, an
amusing ride for others.</P>
<PRE>Rated R.  Running Time: 113 minutes.  (C) 1999
