<P>     What do you call a character study with shallow, sketchily-drawn 
characters, but a gorgeous setting?  A scenery study, perhaps.  Or an 
atmosphere study.  Either would be appropriate for STEALING BEAUTY, a 
stylish, sensual motion picture that's hollow where it should have a 
heart.  This film is aesthetically pleasing but not emotionally 
satisfying.  It's occasionally erotic but rarely dynamic.  While these 
aren't unforgivable traits, I somehow expected more from a Bernardo 
Bertolucci (LAST TANGO IN PARIS) film.</P>
<P>     The main thrust of the movie are the attempts of the lead 
character, Lucy Harmon (Liv Tyler), to lose her virginity.  At age 19, 
she's never slept with a man -- a revelation that causes a great stir 
among the residents of the Tuscany villa where she is spending the 
summer.  Everyone is sympathetic with her situation, and they begin to 
consider who might best be able to accommodate her.</P>
<P>     There is no shortage of candidates.  STEALING BEAUTY presents them 
one-by-one, then dismisses them in the same manner.  There's the 
American boyfriend of the jewelry-maker daughter of Lucy's hostess.  
There's the son, Christopher, or one of his friends, including Nicolo, 
with whom Lucy shared her first kiss four long years ago on her last 
visit to Italy.  Then there's Nicolo's shy, sensitive friend, who turns 
away from the sight of an exposed female breast.</P>
<P>     As the story, such as it is, develops, a mystery subplot is 
introduced:  who is Lucy's real father?  There are three apparent 
possibilities:  Alex Barnes (Jeremy Irons), a dying writer; Ian Grayson 
(Donal McCann), the sculptor husband of Lucy's hostess; and Carlo Lisca 
(Carlo Cecchi), a mysterious ex-military man.  We know the truth long 
before Lucy does, but STEALING BEAUTY is never surprise-oriented.  It 
doesn't take a genius to weed through the choices to determine who will 
get the opportunity to deflower Lucy.</P>
<P>     Despite all the screen time accorded to Tyler, her character shows 
little development.  Events seem to swirl around her, only briefly 
touching her shallow emotional center.  Fundamentally, she's no 
different at the end than at the beginning (except that her hymen is no 
longer intact).  Several of the supporting characters show greater 
depth.  Most notable of these is Jeremy Irons' terminally ill author, 
who becomes Lucy's confidante and vicariously lives out his last days 
through her.</P>
<P>     There's very little comic relief in this too-serious film, which 
makes for a rather grim movie-going experience.  STEALING BEAUTY is 
long, but doesn't really go anywhere.  It is most remarkable for its 
excellent sense of time and place.  The Italian countryside becomes as 
vital a supporting character as Alex, and when Lucy dives into a lake, 
you can almost feel the cool, clear water.  STEALING BEAUTY functions as 
a two-hour, surrogate holiday -- diverting and visually captivating, but 
far from a cinematic landmark.</P>
