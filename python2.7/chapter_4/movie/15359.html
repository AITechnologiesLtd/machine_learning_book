<PRE>VERY BAD THINGS
Review by Victory A. Marasigan

<P>I have to hand it to director Peter Berg. With his first feature Very Bad
Things, he's delivered a story so alternatingly hilarious and repulsive
that by the time it's over, you don't know whether you actually liked the
movie or not. Indeed, I don't think any film in recent memory has caused
such large groups of moviegoers to get up and walk out of the theater at
regular intervals. It's not that the film is poorly made; it's that Very
Bad Things grabs a hold of you and squeezes until you literally can't take
it any more.</P>
<P>At its outset, Berg fools us into thinking we'll be watching a City
Slickers-type weekend adventure, as five young-and-up-and-coming
30-somethings (wild guys Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern, Christian Slater,
Leland Orser, and John Favreau) pack into a minivan and head off to Vegas.
Their mission: to celebrate that time-honored night of controlled chaos -
the bachelor party. Groom Favreau is excited but understandably tense, as
his bride-to-be (Cameron Diaz) has voiced quite clearly her disapproval of
the ritual.</P>
<P>Once in their Vegas hotel suite, the boys really let loose, absorbing
drugs and booze like sponges. Their raw ebullience turns to abject horror
when, in a coital frenzy, one of the guys accidentally kills the
prostitute they hired to entertain them. In the first of a series of
panic-induced bad decisions, the guys decide to take the body out to the
desert and bury it. Not just bury it, but chop it up with a store-bought
electric turkey carver and bury it. Thank God for the 24-hour Target, huh?</P>
<P>Their hideous deed done, the sullied boys head home so the groom can
prepare for his wedding. Of course, things are not as easy to sweep under
the rug as they'd like. As in Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart,"  echoes of
their crime haunt the boys as soon as they set foot back on home turf. In
one particularly well-played scene, family-man Stern lets his paranoia
engulf him to the point of hysteria while trying to buy snacks at a gas
station/convenience store. His behavior doesn't go unnoticed, and it isn't
long before the boys' need for damage control leads to an even larger body
count.</P>
<P>Though it seems inconceivable that humor could be mined out of the deadly
serious premise I've just described, this film is a comedy. It is in some
ways a variation on There's Something About Mary, with the macabre
substituted for just plain gross. The proceedings are made all the more
shocking by the fact that these are normal guys-next-door doing...well,
very bad things.</P>
<P>Though the five leads seem more suited to the demands of wacky comedy,
some (especially Ellen regular Jeremy Piven) are able pull off unhinged
grief and mania quite effectively. The reserved Favreau, the film's moral
anchor, makes good as the tense groom who just wishes the madness would
all just go away. Slater's aphasic Robert is a look at what his Heathers
character might have become if he'd survived that film and gone into real
estate. Diaz, as Favreau's future bride, turns out to be the film's most
eccentric personality, a woman so hell-bent on having her wedding she will
stoop to new lows to make sure it isn't ruined. And Jeanne Tripplehorn, as
Stern's seemingly homey wife, elicits some cheers when she explodes and
goes ballistic on an intruding baddie.</P>
<P>Uneven but engrossing, Very Bad Things is able to generate some palpable
crackling tension, a merit on which I can easily recommend it. Whether the
carnage is too much is totally a matter of personal taste (which is so
significant you can either add or subtract a whole letter grade from my
own rating.)</P>
<P>Like the rest of the movie, Very Bad Things' final act cadenza is either
laugh-out-loud hilarious or downright offensive. You can almost hear the
Farelly brothers offering their approval. Whatever it's effect on you, you
have to walk out of the theater after that.</P>
