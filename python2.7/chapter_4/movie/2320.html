<PRE>                                 TOMBSTONE
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  The story of the Gunfight at the
     O.K. Corral is told with some OK performances, OK
     photography, and for once nearly OK attention to the facts.
     As a piece of storytelling, it has some problems.  Rating:
     high +1 (-4 to +4).  Following the review is a discussion of
     the historical accuracy of the film that may contain minor
     spoilers.</PRE>
<P>     So many films have been made about Wyatt Earp and the famous gunfight
at the O.K. Corral that it almost qualifies as its own subgenre of the
Western.  Films such as TOMBSTONE, THE TOWN TOO TOUGH TO DIE; MY DARLING
CLEMENTINE; GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL; HOUR OF THE GUN; and DOC have
reenacted the gunfight with little respect for the truth.  Almost none agree
on what happened and each is certainly correct that all the others got the
facts wrong.  It may come as a surprise to some that the Earps were no
paragons of virtue any more than the Clantons were and that there were no
crew members of the Starship Enterprise present.  In fact, this dirty little
gunfight lasted under three minutes and was no more dramatic nor much
different in character than gang gunfights that take place in the streets of
New York City frequently.  However, somehow this particular gunfight has
become legend and has been dramatized inaccurately many times.  One of the
problems that films have had is that the gunfight itself is most famous part
of the Earp-Clanton conflict, yet it happened toward the middle of the
proceedings, and it settled very little.  That makes it difficult to build a
film around.  Kevin Jarre has written a script that gets a lot of the facts
right, a lot of the facts wrong, and almost nearly accurately tells what
happened leading up to the gunfight.  Unfortunately, from there on it plays
even more fast and loose with even what is known happened after the
gunfight.  Or at least it gives way to legend, speculation, and to its own
outright fictionalizing.</P>
<P>     The early 1880s was a time of colorful gunfighters in Arizona.  This is
a story that involves some of the most famous.  The plot begins with Curly
Bill Brocius (Powers Booth) and his gang including Johnny Ringo (Michael
Biehn) shooting up a Mexican wedding.  At the same time three Earp Brothers
are settling down in Tombstone, Arizona to find peace.  Wyatt particularly
wants to live peacefully, so he waits until he is in town for at least ten
minutes before he starts making enemies.  One of the ways Wyatt makes
enemies is by renewing his friendship with Doc Holliday and thereby
inheriting Holliday's numerous enemies, but Wyatt was talented at making
enemies all by himself.  Wyatt also meets and falls for Josephine Marcus, a
free-thinking Jewish actress from San Francisco, stealing her from her
lover, the County Sheriff Johnny Behan.  Though under-stressed in the film,
this was also a cause of much of the trouble that was to come.</P>
<P>     Kurt Russell is only a moderate actor but under George Cosmatos'
direction he gives a reasonable and even understated performance as Wyatt.
That means he brings to the role less baggage than does Val Kilmer in the
somewhat more flamboyant role of Doc Holliday.  Holliday was sickly, but
Kilmer is a bit too close to death for a bit too much of this film.  Kilmer
starts being too hard to believe.  Dana Delany is less attractive than the
real Josephine Marcus, based on available photos, but she does exude a
charming spontaneity.  Powers Booth as Curly Bill Brocius and Michael Biehn
as the Latin-spouting Johnny Ringo are colorful but have little opportunity
to be engaging.  Charleton Heston and Harry Carey, Jr., are around as a tip
of the hat to classic Westerns, but neither has a very important role.
Perhaps for the same reason Robert Mitchum narrates the film.</P>
<P>     Moments of this film are genuinely exciting, though more because of
style than plot.  The opening has films of the old West, mixed with footage
of the original THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, and a fake shot or two of Kurt
Russell as Earp, all in scratchy prints and on narrow screen.  Jumping from
that to wide screen and color is an impressive touch very similar to one at
the beginning of ROAD WARRIOR.  It will, however, lose that impact on video.
And the film does have a few dramatic scenes internally like the requisite
sunsets.  But it takes more than style to tell the story and in some ways
the storytelling is muddled.  At times perhaps it sacrifices dramatic effect
for accuracy.  For example, it has not concentrated on the Clantons and
McLaurys until the famous gunfight, so it is not clear why they are so
important as to merit the shoot-out when it comes.</P>
<P>     This is an entertaining retelling of the story, often with insight into
the principal participants.  Director Cosmatos only occasionally raises the
story to actual excitement.  Overall, I would give the film a high +1 on the
-4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>FURTHER COMMENTS ON HISTORIC ACCURACY: (Some spoilers follow.)</P>
<P>     A great deal has been written about the event covered by this film and
while the Old West is not a particular interest of mine, I did do some
reading about this famous gunfight and about Wyatt Earp during and after a
recent trip to Arizona.  Similar interests served me well in reviewing the
recent GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND.</P>
<P>     Jarre's script gets as much wrong as right in this story.  But still
that is a far better average than most films about Tombstone.  Wyatt is
shown to be a peaceful man who just wants to retire in Tombstone.  Sheriff
Behan does not even know he is coming.  In truth Earp played either side of
the law that suited his fancy.  He had been a horse thief, a bunco artist, a
card cheat, and worse.  At the time he went to Tombstone it is true that he
had recently basked in a reputation as a lawman.   Actually he was more a
sort of hired thug for the law in a number of cow towns, usually using his
fists more than guns.  But he had little respect for the law itself except
as a meal ticket and was occasionally thrown out of jobs for taking bribes.
The script is correct in that he had been in only one real gunfight before
the events of the story though many were to come.  The film has Wyatt making
the unlikely decision to settle in Tombstone and Sheriff Behan surprised
that he has come.  Actually Wyatt came to Tombstone invited by Behan.  He
came actually hoping to replace Behan as Sheriff, could not, and took the
job of deputy (not just before the gunfight as the film says).  If he could
not steal Behan's job he could and did steal Behan's lover, Ms. Marcus.</P>
<P>     Wyatt more or less abandoned his own common law wife, Mattie, who was
loyal and *not* a drug addict.  She, however, did have to become a
prostitute to support herself after being abandoned and committed suicide
shortly thereafter at the age of 30.  Incidentally, Wyatt himself was part
owner of several whorehouses, as were other members of the Earp family.</P>
<P>     The major historic failure of the film was that there was no mention of
the Wells Fargo stagecoach robbery that Earp accused the Clanton's of and
the Clanton's accused Doc Holliday of.  For that matter the importance of
the Clanton family was understated.  Brocius and Ringo were only loose
allies of the Clantons who were the Earp's main enemies.</P>
<P>     Holliday's lover is called Kate so I presume that she was intended to
be Big Nose Katie Elder.  Apparently they got a much more attractive woman
for the role than the actual person.  That is probably true for all the
women but Josephine Marcus, who was the one woman of the story who really
would still be attractive by today's standards.</P>
<P>     I have been in the Birdcage Theater, now a tourist museum, and they
obviously had a VERY accurate reproduction.  I doubt those scenes were shot
in the real theater, but the reproduction is so accurate it is difficult to
tell.  Similarly the Corral itself looked just about perfect.  This film had
as accurate a dramatization of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral as I
remember.  The dialog is taken from court testimony.  When I get the film on
video I will run it in slow motion and see if the action follows the court
testimony also.</P>
<P>     It is a little difficult to get hard facts on what happened after the
famous gunfight due to the prevalence of liars on each side of the conflict.
That is what makes legends, I suppose.  Many people believe that Johnny
Ringo committed suicide and that was what the court ruled, though there is
good evidence he was murdered.  (Wyatt, years later, claimed he had killed
Ringo, but Wyatt lied *a lot*.)</P>
<P>     So overall, the accuracy could have been *a lot* better and could have
been *a lot* worse.</P>
