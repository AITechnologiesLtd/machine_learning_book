<P>Helicopters thunder through the air over Los Angeles, raining down 
malathion on the city in an attempt to end the dreaded Medfly invasion.  
Below, in each house and apartment, an individual drama is being played 
out.  As in any human settlement at any time in history, there is joy, 
sadness, jealousy, fear, reconciliation, pain, and death.  With SHORT 
CUTS, a film by director Robert Altman based on nine short stories and 
one poem by the late Raymond Carver, the audience is given a glimpse into 
several of those dramas.</P>
<P>Infidelity mars two marriages, while a tragic accident to another 
couple's son brings their lives to an abrupt halt.  A trio of fishing 
buddies find a dead girl's body floating near their campsite.  Another 
marriage is troubled by a husband's uncertainty about his wife's career 
choice - running a phone sex business.  A man decides to teach his 
estranged wife a little something about the real meaning of "dividing 
things up", and a mother and daughter discover the pain that can come 
from not communicating.</P>
<P>Twenty-two characters and ten tales - it would take a master to 
interweave all of these into a seamless whole.  There are few directors 
who would tackle the challenge, and fewer still who could succeed.  Not 
only has Robert Altman faced the Herculean task, but he has emerged 
victorious.  SHORT CUTS is a magnificent triumph, an example that dramas 
can still be found that don't make use of the time-honored tactics of 
manipulation and oversentimentalization.</P>
<P>Each of the stories told in SHORT CUTS (except perhaps one) could easily 
warrant its own movie.  There are facets of each character that are left 
completely unexplored and, in a sense, we're still waiting for more when 
the final credits begin to roll.  In spite of the long running time, 
there's a lot left unsaid and undone by the time the movie slides into 
home plate.</P>
<P>What is impressive about SHORT CUTS is not only that it tackles so many 
diverse personalities and situations - and presents them well - but that 
it manages to interconnect them in a manner that doesn't leave the viewer 
shaking his head in confusion.  The texture of this film is rich beyond 
belief, and the three hours flies by.  Fans of Carver, however, should 
check their expectations at the door - these are in no way strict 
adaptations (as the change of setting from the Pacific Northwest to 
angst-riddled LA indicates).  Altman admits that SHORT CUTS is "not a 
verbatim retelling of Carver's works, but rather a cinematic 
interpretation of their essence."</P>
<P>Altman has surrounded himself with an ensemble cast that includes some 
highly-respected names.  Some of these actors he has worked with before; 
others are new to his fold.  For the most part, the performances are 
solidly-executed, although there are instances of overacting.  Matthew 
Modine, Andie MacDowell, Madeleine Stowe, and Tim Robins have moments of 
anger that fail to ring true.  However, in the overall scope of things, 
this is a minor complaint.</P>
<P>As is almost always the case in a movie of this nature, there will be a 
story or two that won't interest you much, and a certain group of 
characters which, for one reason or another, will enthrall you.  One of 
the strongest attributes of SHORT CUTS is that the stories occupying the 
"middle ground" have something compelling about them.  What you choose as 
the best and worst of the tales will likely be based on personal 
experience and preference.  Viewers more easily drawn to humor will enjoy 
those portions of the film that are comedy-oriented.  For the record, my 
favorite sequences involve three families - the Kaisers (Chris Penn and 
Jennifer Jason Leigh), the Finnigans (Andie MacDowell and Bruce Davison), 
and the Shepards (Madeleine Stowe and Tim Robbins).  The weakest 
portions, on the other hand, feature husband-and-wife Earl and Doreen 
Piggot (Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin), and the fishing expedition (Fred 
Ward, Buck Henry, and Huey Lewis).</P>
<P>In some ways, SHORT CUTS is loosely-reminiscent of last year's GRAND 
CANYON.  In this case, the project is more ambitious and the premise less 
forced, but there are noticeable similarities.  Doubtlessly, SHORT CUTS 
is the better of the two films (GRAND CANYON couldn't resist resorting to 
a little deft manipulation), but some of the same themes are explored, 
and some of the same motifs (including an earthquake) used.</P>
<P>Also worth mentioning are the inevitable comparisons to Robert Altman's 
own NASHVILLE (considered by some critics to be his best work).  Both 
that film and SHORT CUTS are effective ensemble movies, even if some of 
the things that they try to do are different.  For those that got hooked 
on Altman with THE PLAYER, however, beware - this movie bears little 
resemblance to 1992's biting satire.</P>
<P>Some controversy has been stirred up about SHORT CUTS' inclusion of 
apparently-gratuitous nudity.  Madeleine Stowe and Frances McDormand bear 
their breasts, Lori Singer leaps into a pool in the buff, Julianne Moore 
argues with her husband without a stitch on below the waist, and Huey 
Lewis urinates with the camera watching him from the front.  While it's 
clear that all of these scenes could have been filmed differently (and 
more discreetly), director Altman has a decided reason for doing each the 
way he did.  The result is certainly not titillating, and given the 
impact of the film, it's hard to question Altman's judgment in these 
instances.  </P>
<P>It's a genuine pleasure to find a movie with such a deep and intelligent 
portrayal of simple human lives, with all their minor triumphs and 
tragedies.  SHORT CUTS is a grand, and highly-successful, film because it 
doesn't force more on us than the kinds of things that we personally have 
experience with.  This motion picture is an example of a highly-respected 
modern director in top form.</P>
