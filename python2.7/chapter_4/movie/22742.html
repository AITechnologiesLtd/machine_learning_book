<PRE>WIDE AWAKE (1998)</PRE>
<P>Director: M. Night Shyamalan
With: Joseph Cross, Timothy Reifsnyder, Rosie O'Donnell, Robert Loggia,
Denis Leary</P>
<P>First of all: Forget the tagline for this movie. It is for some reason
trying to portray this film as a standard
kids-getting-into-trouble-at-school comedy, when it is in fact so much
more. Yes, it is funny, but calling it a comedy is an oversimplification at
best. Somewhat like calling Shyamalan's later work, "The sixth sense" a
ghost story, and nothing more.</P>
<P>The setting and time-span of this film is a year at a catholic boy's
school. But fifth-grader Joshua Beal (Joseph Cross), has quite different
things in mind than playing outrageous pranks on the teachers. That role is
left to his best friend Dave (Timothy Reifsnyder). Just before school
started, Joshua lost his grandfather (Robert Loggia in several flashbacks).
The two of them were obviously very close, and his death has hit Joshua
hard. The grandfather was a religious man, and firmly believed that he
would be going to a better place when he left this world. Joshua wishes he
was as certain. He is a very precocious kid, in one scene leaving his
religion-teacher (Rosie O'Donnell in a mainly pointless humorous role),
lost for words after asking if his aunt, who isn't baptized, will go to
hell when she dies ("Look, nobody is going to hell, OK?" "You mean the
Bible is wrong?" "...No, the Bible is not wrong." "I don't get it!"). So,
he decides to go on a mission: He must find God, so that he can ask him is
grandfather is OK. Of course, this isn't as easy as he hopes.</P>
<P>The quest for God soon occupies all of Joshua's attention. He tries
practicing all the religious rituals he can think off, and not just
christian ones. He tries to persuade his parents to go to Rome on vacation
so he can meet the pope. His parents (Denis Leary as the father), and
teachers worry, but are unable to completely understand him. </P>
<P>In spite of Joshua's precociousness, the film avoids the trap of portraying
as nothing but a small adult. While troubled by heavy questions, he is
still just a child. ("When my mum dropped me off [at the birthday party]
she said: 'Try and have a good time.' Why did she say that? I knew I'd have
a good time!").</P>
<P>The film is not perfect, the contrast is sometimes big between the
school-comedy bits, and the religious/philosophical bits. Mostly it works
fine though, and Shyamalan deserves praise for portraying children as
thinking and emotionally complex beings, just like adults are. Cross and
Reifsnyder both deliver good performances, and the narrative progresses in
a natural and unhurried way. In particular the relationship between Joshua
and his grandfather is brought across in a skilfull, and discrete way. It
is a quite spiritual film, and it may come as a surprise to some that the
writer/director himself was not brought up as a christian (he is Indian).</P>
<P>Who should see this film: People who are not afraid of religious subjects,
people who don't mind some sentimentality in movies, people who want to
watch a comedy with some more depth than Dumb & Dumber.</P>
<PRE>My verdict: 5 (out of 6)</PRE>
