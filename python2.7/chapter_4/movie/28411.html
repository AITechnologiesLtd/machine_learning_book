<PRE>"Evolution" – One Giant Step Back
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>There are some film's that have long running times but
seem relatively short (like "Titanic").  Then, there
are some films with short running times but seem
really lo-o-ong.  This is how you'll feel after
watching "Evolution", a 100-minute film that seems to
take as much time to resolve itself as it took for man
to evolve from ape.  </P>
<P>This never-ending feeling occurs because there just
isn't enough for the talented cast of characters to
do.  The film introduces a world-ending dilemma and
resolves the issue by administering an enema.   Pardon
my bad poetry.  But in between, there is no excitement
and only a little drama.  However, there are lots of
creepy critters and a disproportionate amount of ass
jokes if that strikes your fancy.</P>
<P>"Evolution" is about a meteor that crash-lands on
Earth.  Within this rock, there oozes primordial
liquid.   Two local community college professors, Ira
Kane (David Duchovny) and Harry Block (Orlando Jones),
are the first scientists to make this fascinating
discovery.  This could elevate them from adjunct
status at their college to Nobel Prize winners.  "Do
they pay the Nobel Prize in installments or one lump
sum," Harry asks excitedly.  Ira, however, is more
concerned with the astounding rate in which the
organisms are evolving.</P>
<P>Soon, a new species of extra-terrestrial critters
emerge, which range from the scary kind you might see
in "Aliens" to the menacing types in "Jurassic Park"
to the huggable kinds that remind you of "ET".  While
imaginative, they don't amount to much more than
colorful special effects for the summer movie-going
audience and a target for our alien-busters to chase
down.  They have to be eradicated, you know, for the
growing alien ecosystem threatens to cover the
continent within months.</P>
<P>To complement this duo, they are joined in their
battle by a fireman-in-training (Seann William Scott,
whose inclusion is puzzling up until the final moments
of the film) and a frostbitten doctor from the Center
for Disease Control (Julianne Moore).  But this
foursome doesn't really exist to do battle against the
alien infestation; rather, they are there to flex
their individual comic muscles.  After all, this is
supposed to be a comedy.</P>
<P>Duchovny is actually a fairly amusing guy who speaks
with deadpan earnestness.  Moore's contribution seems
to involve tripping and pratfalls.  Scott, who's
making a living as pothead characters, provides the
puerile humor.  While they'll elicit a chuckle or two,
their comedic efficacy pales in comparison to Jones's
comedic performance, who provides the funniest
moments.  For example, when a space bug somehow
infiltrates his large intestines, they wheel him into
the operating room.  "Cheek spreader," says the
doctor, "there's no time for lubricant."  Jones yells
back, "There's ALWAYS time for lubricant!"   His
fast-talking, head-bobbing, manic brand of comedy made
him the most enjoyable of the characters.  Overall,
however, we are starved for more laughter.</P>
<P>While our intrepid group runs around, hunts down
aliens, squishes bugs, and looks for answers,
surprisingly, they never really go anywhere.  And thus
neither does the film.  "Who ya gonna call?"  Don't
even bother picking up that phone.</P>
