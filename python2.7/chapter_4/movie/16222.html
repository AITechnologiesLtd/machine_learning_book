<P>Susan Granger's review of "IN DREAMS" (DreamWorks)</P>
<P>How awful can a movie starring Annette Bening and Robert
Downey Jr., helmed by writer/director Neil Jordan be? "In Dreams"
plumbs new depths of malevolence, becoming an early candidate for the
Worst Movies of 1999 category. Annette Bening plays a New England
children's book author who is tormented by weird, terrifying
dreams. She's a psychic who can see things before they happen, and she
doesn't know what to make of images of an almost surreal underwater
town, mutilated bodies, and a mysterious man with long hair who leads
a trusting child through an apple orchard to her death. Of course, no
one believes her - not the cops, not even her often-absent airline
pilot husband, Aidan Quinn. After a couple of suicide attempts, she
winds up in a mental institution, where she occupies the same room
that Robert Downey Jr. once lived in. He's a maniacal murderer whose
abused childhood included being left chained to a bed by his mother
when their town was being flooded to make a reservoir. Stephen Rea is
Bening's psychiatrist who tries to make sense of her ramblings. Robert
Downey Jr. overacts so dreadfully that one wonders why the L.A. judge
decided to release him from his jail sentence temporarily last year to
finish this film, which is based on Bari Wood's novel "Doll's Eyes."
The singular redeeming feature is its eerie, underwater
imagery. Jordan built a small town and then flooded it in the same
Baja, California, water tanks where James Cameron shot "Titanic." On
the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "In Dreams" is a tedious,
ludicrous 2. Adding insult to injury, the Andrews Sisters' W.W. II
ditty, "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree," is used on the sound track to
signal impending doom.</P>
