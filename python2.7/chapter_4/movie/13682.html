New address. New attitude. Same crappy writing.)</P>
<PRE>starring Kevin Costner, Olivia Williams, Will Patton, Larenz Tate
               screenplay by Eric Roth and Brian Helgeland, based on the
novel by David Brin
                                      directed by Kevin Costner</PRE>
<PRE>Dear Kevin Costner,</PRE>
<PRE>How are you? What are you up to these days? How long will it be until
they offer you a
sitcom?</PRE>
<P>I'll bet right now you're just lounging by the pool, humming "I Will
Always Love You" and
wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success. It isn't
necessarily over for you: I
say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in
"Kevin!" for at least a few
more years. Begin by scribbling "the star that burns twice as bright
burns half as long"
somewhere you'll always see it, perhaps on the fridge door, or on a
bedroom mirror with
lipstick. You had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star
in Robin Hood: Prince of
Thieves, where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses Morgan Freeman
and Alan
Rickman, but Christian Slater (!), several dozen tall trees, bows,
arrows, and a canoe, too.</P>
<P>After Dances With Wolves and JFK, you decided the world needed more
three hour movies,
expensive three hour movies, so you starred in and produced Wyatt Earp;
Wyatt Earp the
man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a
general lack of famous
Wyatts. Wyatt Earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes.
Tombstone was a
vastly superior movie based on the same legend, and that featured Kurt
Russell as Earp and
Dana Delaney as his girlfriend! (She was played by Joanna Going in your
movie-you know,
the character known best in Wyatt Earp as "Jew Whore". What were you and
Lawrence
Kasdan thinking?)</P>
<P>Now, you're suffering the demise of yet another of your epics, The
Postman, a film so
financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory
Waterworld's and Tin Cup's
mildly lucrative box office takes. The Postman is not the worst movie
ever made-people in
Hollywood are quick to forget movies like Howard the Duck whenever the
next bomb comes
along. Yet it is a ridiculous movie. I suspect you thought you had
another Braveheart on your
hands-why else line up two armies on horesback, all prepared for battle,
for the climax of
your film?-but "Mailheart" The Postman is not. (I can think of some more
appropriate
alternate titles: Post Encounters of the Worst Kind; Farewell, My
Salary; Howard the
Postman; The Postman's Never Watched Twice...)</P>
<P>What a brown movie. I hate brown. You love brown. Dances With Wolves was
golden and
brown-it looked like an Eggo commercial. The Postman had me running for
a glass of water
every two minutes; would the post-apocalyptic world look this
maddeningly bland and dry?
What exactly happened to this desert world, anyway? Did we all become so
stupid that we
didn't immediately begin rebuilding homes, restaurants, and most
importantly, shopping
malls, after "the war"? Why did you choose to drive the movie's plot
with a dumb group of
terrorists who, well, terrorize townfolk across America? Why is it only
*they* have ammunition,
anyway? Was it really appropriate to cast your DAUGHTER as a girl who
has a sweet crush
on you, the drifter-cum-postman? Why cast English actress Olivia
Williams as an American?
Don't you realize that European women can only deliver their big
emotional scenes in their
native accent? (Take a look at the less-than-stellar performances of an
American-ized Nicole
Kidman or an American-ized Minnie Driver.) Who could give a damn whether
you lived or
died at the end of this movie? If it came down to a fight for leadership
between you and the
leader of the terrorists, why didn't you do that halfway through the
film and save us all a lot
of headaches? Why cast Will Patton as the bad guy? Because you worked
with him in No Way
Out? Sure, he's a suitably creepy villain; know why? Because he's creepy
in everything,
including Armageddon, in which he plays a heroic astronaut who
practically slithers into his
space suit! Why heroize the most demonic institution in America, the
U.S. Postal System? Was
Tom Petty supposed to be playing Tom Petty? If so, why didn't he look
more skeletal? (He
should have been around 70 years old.) Why, oh why, do I have so many
questions? (I could
ask plenty more.) Shouldn't a three hour running time have provided you
enough space to
answer everything?</P>
<P>You have one great line in this film, and you deliver it to a mule!:
"The things I like about my
ass..." I had to wonder. Actually, I enjoyed the tone of the opening
scenes, a relaxed cynicism,
if you'll accept such clunky phrasing-too bad you couldn't resist the
temptation to film yet
another love letter to your country.</P>
<P>Ultimately, I'm saying relax. There is no quota, no need for you to make
a picture a year.
Settle down. Really question future screenplays before you commit to
them.</P>
<P>Feel free to write back. I know how much you like letters.</P>
