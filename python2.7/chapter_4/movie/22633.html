<PRE>THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Beautiful, baffling and boring.  THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN by Chinese
director Kaige Chen (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE and TEMPTRESS MOON) uses
mainly claustrophobic interior scenes to tell the bloody story of
Chinese unification in 221 B.C.  Long episodes of palace intrigue are
enacted so slowly that you'll swear the projectionist must be running
the print at half speed.</P>
<P>Periodically, we get a breath of fresh air, as the picture moves
outdoors for a few fast, battle sequences.  After these brief respites,
we head back inside the palace walls so that the protagonists can
proclaim various awkward platitudes that they usually don't mean, since
everyone appears to be part of some cabal.  The characters, whose
motivations remain largely an enigma, strut around, periodically
breaking into laughter in strange bits of bravado.</P>
<P>The King of Qin (Xuejian Li) wants to crush the other six Chinese
kingdoms and form a single country under his rule.  He -- surprise! --
isn't such a nice guy.  Among his more despicable acts are having two
young boys, his brothers, crushed to death, lest they become rivals to
his throne.  The audience has to endure this and other acts of horrific
violence.</P>
<P>As the scheming Lady Zhao, Gong Li plays the woman who hires an assassin
(Fengyi Zhang) to kill the King of Qin and thereby stop the slaughter of
the other kingdoms.  The script by the director and Peigong Wang uses
chapter headings to delineate the various parts of the narrative, but
the opaque story makes for one long, confusing history lesson.</P>
<P>Fei Zhao's lush cinematography and Jiping Zhao's sweeping music are so
striking that you'll wish that they'd been saved for a more compelling
motion picture.  Their presence in this film is actually
counterproductive, as the tendency to fall asleep during the long, dull
passages are only accentuated by the dreamy music and the gorgeous
visuals.</P>
<P>The obviously ambitious film really has very little to say.  This brings
me to my rule for directors.  If you have little to say, don't take
forever saying it.  Instead of taking almost three hours of the
audience's time, trim your film back to the standard length of one and
half to two hours.  Your picture will be more focused so that your
audiences are more likely to appreciate it, and, if they don't, they
won't get mad at you for wasting so much of their time with a film
that's badly in need of more editing and better pacing.</P>
<P>THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN runs 2:40.  It is in Mandarin with English
subtitles.  The film is rated R for language and strong violence and
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, February 4.
Locally, it will be playing at one of the Camera Cinemas in the San Jose
area and one of the Landmark Theaters in the Palo Alto area.</P>
