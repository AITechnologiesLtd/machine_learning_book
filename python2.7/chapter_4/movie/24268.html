<P>   If this review were limited to two words, these words would
reflect the grandiloquent gesture of the 50,000 spectators in
the Roman Colosseum: "Pollice sursum." Thumbs up.  The
expected huge audience for this $100 million movie is likely
to be as excited by its realization as the 50,000 fans at
Rome's Colosseum had been when watching the victorious
combat of the title hero, Maximus, also known simply as
"Gladiator."  While grand spectaculars are commonplace for
the big Hollywood studios, biblical marvels like "The 10
Commandments" and historical epics centering on ancient
Rome have been largely missing from the big screen for the
past thirty-five years--victims of cost and perhaps the feeling
by studio execs that mainstream moviegoers have lost
interest in historical drama.</P>
<P>   But thanks to the marvels of modern technology imposed
on a fictionalized, historical past, Judah Ben-Hur's chariot
in motion looks like a scooter ride at Coney Island when
contrasted with the thunder and hoofbeats of the legionnaires
in Ridley Scott's robust and bloody tale of revenge.  If the
lavish spectacles of the fifties and early sixties brought
audiences to the theaters for what they could not see on their
small TV screens, "Gladiator" will likely pile up box office
numbers as well, especially given its sincere, vigorous, wholly
credible and consistent action with nary a campy moment for
unintentional laughter.  </P>
<P>   While "Gladiator" is not officially a sequel to any previous
effort, the movie takes off where Anthony Mann's 1964 effort
"The Fall of the Roman Empire" leaves off.  Like Ridley
Scott's labor, Mann's picture, starring Sophia Loren and
Stephen Boyd, possesses a solid screenplay, masterful
direction and terrific ensemble acting and is likewise set in
the year 180 A.D. and opening in the Germania forests.  This
time, Roman legions are fighting the last stronghold of the
barbarians, a fully bearded, strange lot of people who are
ultimately trashed by an army under the command of
Maximus (Russell Crowe).  The film opens with photographer
John Mathieson's close-up of the face of the great general, a
man whose pensive, exhausted look serves effectively
enough in place of the lengthy speechifying we'd have
expected from seeing earlier historical screenplays such as 
Joseph L. Mankiewicz's "Cleopatra" and George Stevens's
"The Greatest Story Ever Told"--both products of the sixties
when the genre was at its height.  </P>
<P>   When a Roman messenger carrying a request for
surrender to the German forces returns on horseback to his
own side minus a head, the general's right-hand man quips,
"They say no."  Maximus gives his final pep talk to the troops
before the great battle--a combat scene that could almost be
compared for bloodletting with Steven Spielberg's opening of
"Saving Private Ryan."  "If you find yourself in a green field
with the sun on your face, do not be troubled.  You're in
Elysium and you're already dead," Maximus intones almost
poker-faced to the amusement of the spear-and-sword
carrying men.  Burning the forest that serves as protection for
the men of Germania in much the way the U.S. utilized
napalm to destroy the shielding groves of Vietnam, Maximus
emerges triumphant, impressing the then-reigning emperor
Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) enough to be named
successor to the dying man.  When Aurelius--who is troubled
that only four of his twenty years was time spent in
peace--fails to convey his wishes to the Senate,
Aurelius's son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) declares himself
emperor.  The envious neurotic orders the execution of the
popular general.  </P>
<P>   Escaping the executioner, Maximus is captured, sold as a
slave by Proximo (Oliver Reed), and turned into a gladiator,
where his success in the African ring leads Proximo to take
him to the Roman Colosseum for the big time.  The
remainder of the story alternates political scheming with
Maximus's combat in the ring against a varied assortment of
foes from other slaves to legionnaires with tigers in tow. 
Commodus and his allies deal in their own ways with the big
man's opponents--particularly renegade Senator Gracchus
(Derek Jacobi) who favors a return to a republic, and the
emperor's own two-timing sister, the beautiful Lucilla (Connie
Nielsen), with whom the emperor is in lust.  As we hear the
bantering of these statesmen, we cannot help thinking of
politics in our own times.  Leaders plot to displace one
another legally or otherwise and legislatures demand a
greater say in the decisions of our era as the U.S. Congress
recently did during the impeachment and trial of President
Clinton.</P>
<P>   Filmed principally in Malta, and also in the southern city of
Ouarzazarte, Morocco (standing in for the Roman province of
Zucchabar), "Gladiator" boasts some intriguing travelogue
photography, the most impressive being the mud houses and
500-year-old casbah of the touristic Moroccan city.  Ridley
Scott does not dare to make any of his many battles
redundant, pitting Maximus first against the amateurs in North
Africa, later against legionnaires on chariots with spokes on
their wheels designed to cut opponents in half, then throwing
in a tiger or two (actual, tame cats were used in this
production), and finally a reasonably tense one-on-one
between Maximus and the emperor himself--after Commodus
conveniently delivers a gruesome stab wound to his
opponent's back while the latter stands chained inside the
Colosseum walls.</P>
<P>   Joaquin Phoenix makes for a formidable villain, the
epitome of pure evil that Claudius and Nero themselves
would envy.  This emperor kills his own father,
virtually has incestuous relations with his sister,
and fights with his nemesis only after delivering a
malevolently unsporting blow to his opponent.  He
moreover shows his disdain for the general by describing the
way his men executed Maximus's family, the brood to which
Maximus wishes to return and do farming after the final battle
with Germania.  "They say your son squealed like a hawk
when they nailed him to a cross and that your wife moaned
like a whore as she was ravished again and again and
again," he intones to the beleaguered hero.  For her part,
Connie Nielsen looks bewitching as the unhappy sister of the
emperor, siding with Senator Gracchus and with General
Maximus in their desire to rid the vast empire--housing one-
quarter of the human population and stretching from North
Africa to Britain--of its malicious ruler.  </P>
<P>   Perhaps to no one's great surprise, Russell Crowe is
already being touted for the Best Actor Oscar of the year
2000, an award on which he barely missed out courtesy of a
crackerjack performance by Kevin Spacey in yet another
DreamWorks production, "American Beauty."  Had this actor
in the role of research scientist in Michael Mann's "The
Insider" been afforded the weaponry he uses in this movie,
none of the seven lying CEO's of the tobacco giants would be
alive today.  Crowe shows an uncanny ability to exchange the
bearings of a paunchy, middle-aged high-school teacher in
"The Insider" for the lean, mean, bearded general this time
around.  He's the guy that will bring in the women for a
picture that's hardly a chick flick, while the youthful crowd will
be captivated by chariots crashing and dismantling against
the walls of the Colosseum, heads rolling, torsos bloodied,
and tigers maimed. "Gladiator" is fast and furious, its physical
action tempered with the verbal sounds of Machiavellian
political maneuvers.  This is not a movie that can wait for
video nor should it be ruined months from now by inserting a
tape or DVD into your home entertainment system. Savor
"Gladiator" for the big screen in all of John Mathieson's
wonderful wide-screen action replete with an array of
smashing costumes, defensive armor, and determined
weaponry.</P>
