<PRE>A movie review by Monika Huebner
Copyright 1998 Monika Huebner</PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Zemeckis
Starring Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerrit, Angela
Basset, John Hurt, James Woods</P>
<P>Even as a child Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) shows a strong affinity
for natural sciences fostered by her father until his untimely death.
She has a particular predilection for astronomy and the search for
intelligent life on other planets. After obtaining her doctorate at
MIT she gets a job at the SETI institute in New Mexico. When after
years of unavailing research the money for further projects is denied
to her, the most incredible thing happens: she receives signals
originating on a star named Vega 26 light years away. Having grappled
with the initially alarming nature of the message (a TV coverage of
the 1936 Olympic Games' inauguration at Berlin), they discover coded
information containing the construction manual for a mysterious
machine. The United States decide to build it, turning a blind eye to
opponents who suspect a diabolical instrument for the elimination of
mankind. In fact, the first test run ends in a catastrophe, albeit in
a somewhat different way than most people had feared. The project
seems to be finished, but Ellie is still in for a surprise. </P>
<P>CONTACT presents Jodie Foster in one of her best parts ever, namely an
ambitious scientist called Dr. Ellie Arroway who has to stand her
ground in a field traditionally belonging to the men's world. The only
trouble is that she does it because of a childhood trauma – she never
managed to overcome the loss of her beloved father. Quite obviously,
Hollywood still hasn't grappled with the dilemma of accepting a strong
female character simply behaving in a ‘normal' way as it would be
naturally expected of a man. This can also be seen from the fact that
previous to a press conference at which to report her research results
to the public Ellie, who otherwise seems to have rather little
interest in secular things, is preoccupied with only one thought:
where to get a particularly attractive and extravagant dress. In a
film such as CONTACT, which contrasts agreeably with science fiction
films commonly produced in tinsel town, this detail is especially
conspicuous. </P>
<P>Robert Zemeckis' film is a strikingly close adaptation of Carl Sagan's
novel and consequently encompasses the ‘faith versus science' issue
repeatedly touched on by Sagan. For example, the construction of the
‘machine' attracts a phalanx of religious fanatics preaching the end
of the world. In many individuals the impending turn of the century
evokes the angst of the Judgement Day, equally well known to our
modern society as to medieval Europe 1000 years ago. Another matter of
great human concern is the question about the existence of God, or
whether it is right to send scientists to a remote star although they
don't believe in God. The church is embodied by ‘Father' Palmer Joss
(Matthew McConaughey), a former priest who appears as a confirmed
representative of the Catholic faith although for personal reasons he
did not finish the seminary. The love story, which seems to be
compulsory in Hollywood, starts to blossom between him and Ellie; in
this film however, it is a drawback rather than an asset because it is
virtually redundant and does not promote the action.</P>
<P>Having said that, CONTACT is one of the films most worthy to view this
year with its placid yet not boring narrative and a flood of fantastic
pictures especially captivating. The special effects do not simply
function in their own right, but because they are elements required by
the plot. They provide the film with an aesthetic quality rarely to be
found in this genre. Right at the beginning for example the audience
is taken on a ride through the solar system to the centre of the Milky
Way, the significance of which is only revealed in the course of the
film.</P>
<P>Some may think that with a 2½ hours' run CONTACT is unreasonably long,
but that way the story has time enough to develop. The main cast is
perfect and several cameos of American TV celebrities render the
scenario even more realistic. So if an action spectacle featuring many
explosions, shoot-outs, spaceships and chases is something you can
very well do without, you should not miss out on this one. </P>
