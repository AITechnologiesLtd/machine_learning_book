<PRE>                                  THE SAINT
                      A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1997 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Leslie Charteris's famed hero fails
          to come to the screen in this film inspired as much
          by the old MISSION IMPOSSIBLE program as THE SAINT
          or Charteris's stories.  Val Kilmer gets a real
          field day playing in many disguises, and his
          character certainly had possibilities.  But the
          script fell well short of being a cracking good
          story of international intrigue. Rating: 0 (-4 to
          +4)
          New York Critics: 1 positive, 10 negative, 6 mixed</PRE>
<P>     I am told that back in the 1970s a young filmmaker came to the
owners of the rights to the character Flash Gordon and said he wanted
to make a Flash Gordon movie.  They turned the filmmaker down so he
created a brand new hero of his own, calling him Luke Skywalker.
Fortunes are made and lost on such decisions.  But the question is why
would even some of the most talented filmmakers choose to use pre-
existing characters when they can create new ones of their own who are
just as interesting.  One might be that they think they can explore
some new approach to an existing character; the other is to exploit
audience recognition value.  A test to see which is true would be
whether the character would be recognizable with the names changed.
Frequently there are good films made that re-examine Sherlock Holmes.
Almost always these films would be recognizable as being about Sherlock
Holmes even if he were given another name.  One film that definitely
does not pass the test is the new THE SAINT.  Without being told that
this character sometimes uses the name Simon Templar (but usually not)
and without the use of the Saint stick- figure logo toward the end of
the film, there is nothing in Val Kilmer's nameless character that at
all evoke Leslie Charteris's roguish troubleshooter.  And that is
almost surprising since the original Simon Templar is sort of an all-
purpose adventure character.  He might in one adventure be battling
diamond smugglers, in another dangerous spies, and in still another his
opponent would be a mad scientist who has bred an ant the size of a
train car.  Frequently he was suspected to be on the fuzzy edge of the
law, but he never actually was.  He usually used his own name, rarely
used disguises, and probably never used Bondian gadgets though he did
use his own suave personality.  In short, there is just about nothing
in the new Val Kilmer version of The Saint evocative of the character
as written or portrayed before.  Not that this is not an interesting
character.  In fact, this film would have been much better had it not
played on the audience's expectations to see Simon Templar.</P>
<P>     The story opens in what can only be termed "the Catholic School
from Hell."  Because one boy does not take to the Saint's name he has
been assigned, all the girls are locked in their dorms and the boys
will get no food.  This seems like a particularly virulent piece of
gratuitous anti-Catholicism.  Perhaps because the character will later
take the names of saints the filmmakers wanted to make clear this was
not a religious film.  That becomes really clear when the set loose
dogs on some of the children in their charge and one is killed.  This
incident has scarred for life a man of mystery with no name, but who
likes to occasionally use the name Simon Templar.  Flash forward a few
years and the man is a hi-tech cross between Batman and a James Bond
without a British Secret Service to serve.  It is never explained where
his money comes from, but he obviously has a lot to spend on the latest
gadgets.  He gets caught up in a really confused plot by the Russian
Mafia to steal a formula for practical cold fusion from an attractive
American scientist, played by Elizabeth Shue.  The whole convoluted
story builds to an outlandish climax in Red Square.</P>
<P>     Shue is appealing with her slightly geeky touches.  Though somehow
there just does not seem to be much chemistry between her character and
Kilmer's and their romance only seems to bog down the plot.  Kilmer is
just a little over the top in a fun way with his many and varied
disguises.  They are each just a bit exaggerated much like Rod
Steiger's tour-de-force performance in NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY.  The
problem is the story which is so totally artificial and which so often
depends on far-fetched coincidence to get Kilmer's character out of
trouble.  I think I would like to see more of this character, but in a
plot that is much better thought out.  And frankly it still irks me
that they hung this brand new character on The Saint.</P>
<P>     The score of this film by Graeme Revell is not inspiring (which is
probably why the trailers borrowed music from THE SHADOW and CRIMSON
TIDE).  The film is full of scenes that are not well considered.
During one chase the character apparently changes clothes (off camera)
in the middle of a crowded public square with nobody noticing.</P>
<P>It would have been nice to have a new film about Leslie Charteris's
character.  It may even be good to have more stories about this Simon
Templar, but they are not the same and this story has too many rough
edges.  I give this THE SAINT a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
