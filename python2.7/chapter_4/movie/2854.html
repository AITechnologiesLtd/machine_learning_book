<P>     It never ceases to amaze me how badly a poor script can screw up a
potentially fascinating premise.  Exhibit one for the prosecution:
TRIAL BY JURY.</P>
<P>     Consider Valerie Alston (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer), a civic-minded
citizen who gets picked to be on the jury for the Rusty Pirone (Armand
Assante) murder trial.  She has every intention of following her
conscience until a little visit from Pirone's henchman Tommy Vesey
(William Hurt) gives her something to think about.  If there's a
mistrial, he claims, she and her son (wooden child actor Bryan
Shilowich) will be protected.  If Pirone goes to jail, both of them
will die.</P>
<P>     As the trial progresses, the evidence against Pirone mounts until
no reasonable juror could consider him anything but guilty.  So Valerie
is faced with an unpleasant--and potentially deadly--choice: acquit
and live, or convict and risk death.</P>
<P>     The theatrical and television previews make this film look like a
clever thriller centered around this dilemma.  But, as is often the
case, that's because such advertisements use only the best scenes.
Left out are numerous instances of overacting, underacting, terrible
dialogue, and poor plotting.</P>
<P>     Despite a compelling basis for its story, Jordan Katz and Heywood
Gould's screenplay vacillates between the contrived and the downright
moronic.  The characters are strictly one-dimensional types engaging in
flat, stilted conversations.  Melodrama suffuses several
potentially-taut sequences, and the conclusion would be right at home
in such films as BASIC INSTINCT.</P>
<P>     Aside from a brief appearance by character actor Mike Starr (who
plays a witness for the prosecution), Armand Assante gives the only
noteworthy performance.  His often-magnetic (and never subdued)
presence only makes you aware of what this film might have been had a
more competent production team taken charge.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is unable to carry to burden
of the lead role.  For whatever reason, grasping Valerie's psyche seems
beyond the actress (or maybe she just didn't care enough), and she
comes across as stale.  The only thing striking about Whalley-Kilmer is
the array of glitzy outfits she gets to wear.</P>
<P>     Kenneth Branagh's DEAD AGAIN took a dopey premise and built a
solid, entertaining plot around it.  TRIAL BY JURY manages to do the
opposite.  Even as an homage to '40s film noir flicks, it's woeful.
You need more than Joanne Whalley-Kilmer doing a Rita Hayworth
impersonation to accomplish that.</P>
<P>     Quentin Tarantino's much-awaited second feature won't be in
theaters for another two months.  Apparently, however, TRIAL BY JURY
has chosen to herald that picture.  After all, the script for this film
is nothing if not pulp fiction.</P>
