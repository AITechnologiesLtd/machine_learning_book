<PRE>I LIKE THIS MOVIE.</PRE>
<P>It was a final nominee for best foreign film of the year in the March of
1992 Oscar race, and it didn't win because Journey of Hope was a much
stronger film in the stomach wrenching stakes, where Jesus of Montreal tends
to get to a point where it doesn't know how to end, what begun as a very
nice piece of work by a dedicated Bible scholar and film maker.</P>
<P>This film is not for Christian fanatics who don't like literature and
history, as this film makes sure people know the difference between life and
theatre, and yet, it is this medium which sends this film flying.</P>
<P>It is a reminder, if not a tribute, to the late Joseph Papp, who used to do
Shakespeare around Manhattan, the same way,... by having the actors live it
all out through the whole day, in different locations.  Here, the actors
begin doing a passion play in a local park, at the bequest of a local
catholic church, and end up doing much more through out the city, until its
size becomes a threat to the church officials.  Even the devil is portrayed
as a gung ho agent, lawyer, accountant, who knows much can be made here.
Heck,
with a good promoter, have you any idea what the real Jesus could have done?
Scary premise.  It is a question Jesus of Montreal is asked by this guy.</P>
<P>The play starts out innocently enough, and the actors involved begin to get
into their roles seriously, as the material is indeed, very serious.  When
the play gets bigger than life, the church begins trying to close it,
despite the hypocrisies ( the priest sleeping with the leading actress
playing Mary Magdalene ,... clever,... ) the news media is now enjoying the
dramatic  endeavor and the lead actors strange, and powerful ability.  It
becomes the toast of town, to the chagrin of the church, which closes the
play on the spot, immediately after a very successful outing.  The lead
actor is serious. And
the priest is having anxiety problems.  The actor is killed by an accident
stemming from an over eager police force preventing the public to see the
play. A large pole ( looking like one that would have been used for a
cross ) falls on the actor killing him.  The priest has a heart attack.
They end up  in separate hospitals ( Jesus in a modern day hospital, and the
priest in a catholic hospital ) but the actors' heart ends up in the
priest's body to give him a second chance.  He gets up one day, saying, that
he had a dream  and that he wanted to do a play,... a passion play.  And the
film closes.</P>
<P>The premise is clear.  The church authorities refuse to accept history, as
they feel they wrote it, the way it should have been, with all the miracles
and events.  Scientific discoveries are finding that the writings are far
from the truth, specially now that the Dead Sea Scrolls are available, even
though church authorities have denied its originality, and proceeded to
denounce  those who continue studying it.  There were fourteen books found,
and only three have been translated, forty five years later.  FORTY FIVE
YEARS LATER.  The Vatican libraries have all this stuff buried in their
basement.  Why don't they fess up.  Even their own cardinals don't know what
all of what is down there.  It is a form of work like the Sean Connery film.</P>
<P>The acting is unusual, in that one finds in the early stages a satirical
tone towards theatre in general, with over acting, 'ham'ing, and lack of
general direction.  It ends up taking all those bits, and putting them in
the correct place, and making a heck of a film while at it.</P>
<PRE>Should see it.</PRE>
<P>If you are an open minded Christian, this film is for you.  And by the way,
the history does not deny Christianity.  It just validates it as a faith
based on truth and a strong spirit. Not the ideas of man, which was Jesus'
real fight.  The ideas of man meaning the written down doctrines, which had
nothing to do with the real spirit of man.  An idea, is not the same as a
real vision.</P>
