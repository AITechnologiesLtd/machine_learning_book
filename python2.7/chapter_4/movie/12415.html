<PRE>SPECIES
*** OF **** grade is B</PRE>
<P>SPECIES writer Dennis Feldman  is some kind of genius.  He does the most
obvious thing with Species, adding T&A to an alien sci-fi flick.  Now
the 11-25 year old males can have a ball, on the edge of their seats and
saliva drooling from their collective mouths.  Species is good
entertainment that has originality and eroticism to spare.</P>
<P>A signal from the stars told us to mix alien DNA with ours to create an
offspring.  They make the offspring female and name her Sil.  She ages
rapidly and might grow out of control, they decide to terminate the
project with cyanide gas.  Sil escapes with a fury and is unleashed on
the public.  As she caches a train a group of "hunters" are formed to
track and eliminate her.</P>
<P>The "hunters" are a mixed bag of specialists, either scientists or
mercenaries, and have surprisingly well developed personalities.  The
alien, Sil (Natasha Henstridge), looks fresh out of the pages of
PLAYBOY.  She comes to the conclusion that she must find a man and mate,
her looks are definitely not a handicap, but the specialists seem just
one step behind her.</P>
<P>This movie does a fair job of building suspense, especially during an
exciting climax, yet has it's share of cats jumping from trees and false
scares - good only for a shallow jump.  Species doesn't seem too
interested in suspense but instead with gore and nudity, and both are
offered up throughout.</P>
<P>Overall, Species is a fun film that offers some cheap joys and little
brain.  I have a certain loathing for films in which aliens are
disgusting, saliva soaked things with no brains, yet are supposed to be
smarter than us.  After Aliens there have been many copycats and none
have come close.  This isn't the best copycat and doesn't try to be, we
get an original take on the old idea and a certain amount of fun.</P>
<P>There is energy and flare to this film that seems unusual for a sci-fi
film (most of which just go through the motions).  We get a wonderful
climax and some interesting scenes and acting in between.  We also get a
lot of nudity from Natasha Henstridge.  She seems to take it off with
every scene of this film as she tries to seduce men so she can become
pregnant.  I heard one kid say that if human life - as we know it -
depended on him NOT having sex with Natasha Henstridge, we better get
ready for change.  I guess that is part Species is trying to make: Would
you rather watch a living male fantasy, quasi-human, horny as hell,
naked as hell, forever stripping and spilling out of outfit, babe seduce
men or Judge Dredd shout "I am the Law!"  Tough choice.</P>
