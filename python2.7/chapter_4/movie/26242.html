<P>   Some twenty years ago I was having a discussion at lunch
with some colleagues.  One guy piped up about how the
Europeans don't care what their government leaders' sex
lives are like and in fact may even prefer their prime ministers
and presidents to play around.  Then he added, "I think I'd
rather have a president who enjoys fooling around than one
who's straight and narrow.  I want the guy with his finger on
the button to enjoy his life so that he thinks quite a lot before
he pushes it!"  Well said. Now Rod Lurie, who wrote and
directed "The Contender"--which deals with a woman fighting
to be confirmed in Congress as vice president--frames that
outlook in a wittier way.  Says candidate Laine Hanson (Joan
Allen) to the man who nominated her, "You don't want a
woman with a finger on the button who isn't getting laid."  </P>
<P>   Lurie's political thriller, which appears to be inspired by our
current leader's peccadilloes, is about sex and power, about
how in at least one situation the two most consequential
aspects of life become intertwined when, in Lurie's view, they
should not be.  Lurie--who has more or less stated in
an interview that the game of politics is to him what the super
bowl is to a bunch of all-American TV spectators--showed his
preoccupation with the sport in making the claustrophobic,
low-budget film "Deterrence" just months before.  While the
subject matter of that work is broadly similar to that of "The
Contender," the two are distinct.  "Deterrence" would be
valued by those who can believe that the president of the
United States would decide to nuke Iraq from the comfort of a
rural coffee shop during a blinding snowstorm in Aztec,
Colorado amid a cacophony of varied opinions from the short-
order cook, the waitress and customers.  Enjoying a much
larger budget in his current offering, Lurie has turned out a
mostly plausible drama which, despite going out on a
schmaltzy limb toward the conclusion, is eminently enjoyable
and features Oscar-worthy acting by Joan Allen as the
eponymous contender.  Filmed mostly in Richmond, Virginia,
"The Contender" affords the viewer some insight into the
trappings of power--particularly when the president, as
addicted to food as Bill Clinton, pushes the button labeled
"chef," gets an immediate response, and orders everything
from a shark sandwich on rye to an exotic oriental platter. 
He runs into trouble only when seeking a Muenster cheese
sandwich, which the four-star chef is unable to prepare.</P>
<P>   The story opens on a scene that may remind viewers of
Ted Kennedy's unfortunate debacle at Chappaquiddick, an
event that prevented the man from ever seeking the
presidency.  This time, however, the incident appears to push
Governor Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen) into the vice
presidential nomination, as he heroically attempts to rescue a
woman who had driven her car over a bridge into the water. 
When President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) nonetheless
ignores the advice of his chief adviser Kermit Newman (Sam
Elliott) by passing over the governor in favor of Senator Laine
Hanson (Joan Allen), Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary
Oldman) is determined to squash Hanson's nomination and to
convince the president to go with Hathaway.</P>
<P>   Until the patriotic soundtrack during the final half hour
becomes conspicuous--one which seems designed to get the
audience to stand up in the aisles and salute the flag--"The
Contender" is a credible, sincere and serious-minded work
that gets us thinking about the importance of having high
principles and sticking to them when the chips are down. 
Would you believe a politician would refuse to fight back
against smarmy accusations that she had taken part in a
drunken fraternity-house sex orgy during college days--simply
because she believes that her private life is just that?  </P>
<P>   By making the characters' motivations ambiguous, Lurie
avoids the temptation to push his film into melodramatic soap
opera.  While Congressman Runyon looks evil--Oldman has
been given an unappealing haircut, an ugly pair of glasses,
and looks piggish in scenes that take place across a dining
room table--he is simply doing what a partisan politician does
to defeat a candidate not of his liking in favor of a man he
thinks would be better for the country.  Lurie allows the 28-
year-old Congressman Reginald Webster (Christian Slater)
the will to turn from a young man who plays up to the big
shots against his own principles into a guy who may sacrifice
his chance for an cushy appointment when his conscience
gets the better of him.  Jeff Bridges is alternately funny
(whenever he reminds us of our own president's predilection
for McDonald's) and inspiring, but Joan Allen runs away with
the honors as an individual who seems always to be thinking
of sex (she's enjoying a round with her husband in her very
first scene), but who in a less-than-saintly fashion may have
been involved in a college gang-bang and in a home-breaking
affair with her married campaign manager.  </P>
<P>   Pungent dialogue, solid ensemble performances, sharp
editing that takes us quickly from one scene to the next, and
Rod Lurie's ability to evoke the very best from his actors
make "The Contender" a rousing--if sometimes too slick--
political film.</P>
