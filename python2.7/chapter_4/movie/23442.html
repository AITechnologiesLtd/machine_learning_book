<PRE>REAR WINDOW
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        Quick.  Name Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.  "Vertigo"?  "Psycho"?
How about "Rear Window"?  Yeah, that's it...</P>
<P>        Fifteen years after "Rear Window" enjoyed a mini-revival along with
four other "long-lost" Hitchcock treasures--"Vertigo," "Rope," "The Trouble
with Harry," and the remake of his own "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (the one
in which Doris Day warbles "Que Sera, Sera")--the director's most
accomplished film returns to theaters in a fully-restored print.</P>
<P>        The old-fashioned dying process used to restore the negative has
created a film version with richer, denser colors than we see in
contemporary film stocks.  Whereas these improvements might only be
noticeable to a film historian viewing the prints side-by-side, the best
thing about this restoration is that it gives moviegoers another chance to
see this magnificent film as it was meant to be seen: in the theaters.</P>
<P>        "Rear Window" is the one about the newspaper photographer (Jimmy
Stewart in one of his best roles) holed up in his Manhattan apartment,
confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg.  Here he receives daily
rubdowns by an insurance company nurse (Thelma Ritter, spouting more
one-liners in one film than Arnold Schwarzenegger has achieved in his
entire career), and occasional visits from his "perfect" socialite
girlfriend (Grace Kelly at her most luminous).</P>
<P>        With seven weeks to convalesce and the temperatures in the
nineties, Stewart's L.B. Jefferies (Jeff) is given ample opportunity to
observe the comings and goings of his neighbors since their blinds, like
his, are invariably left up.  Neighbors such as "Miss Torso," a
well-proportioned young woman who enjoys performing calisthenics in her
underwear; "Miss Lonelyheart," a depressed middle-aged spinster who
fantasizes about meeting Mr. Right; and an aspiring songwriter who taps out
compositions on his piano late into the night.</P>
<P>        Most intriguing, however, are the Thorwalds who live directly
across the way.  Since Mrs. Thorwald is an invalid, Jeff's curiosity is
aroused when he observes her husband making three mysterious trips very
early one morning.  The next day the blinds are drawn in the Thorwald's
bedroom and Jeff, now more than a casual voyeur, begins to suspect foul
play.</P>
<P>        The entire film is shot from the claustrophobic perspective of
Jeff's apartment with the only glimpse of the outside world supplied via a
narrow alley leading to the street.  The suspense unfolds within the red
brick confines of the rear of the buildings, with the neighbors' petty
dramas spilling out into the courtyard below.  Inside, the nosy threesome,
now joined by Jeff's old army buddy (played by Wendell Cory), discuss,
hypothesize, argue, and intellectualize about the possibility of a crime
having been committed.</P>
<P>        John Michael Hayes' dialogue--at times crafty, alarming, witty, and
never less than sparkling--is masterfully realized by a perfect cast.
Ritter is a hoot and the sexual tension between Stewart and Kelly just
sizzles.  What's remarkable about Stewart's performance is that he spends a
large proportion of the film simply observing, reacting--mostly with his
eyes--to the things going on outside his window.  A lesser actor could have
easily overdone this.</P>
<P>        With a playful score by Franz Waxman, stunning gowns by Edith Head,
and Hitchcock's brilliant direction keeping everything in sharp focus,
"Rear Window" is a near-faultless work that is as absorbing today as it was
some 46 years ago.  Don't be a mug and wait another 15 years to see it.</P>
