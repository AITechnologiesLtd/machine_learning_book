<PRE>Anaconda
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Jennifer Lopez; Ice Cube; Jon Voight; Eric Stoltz & Jonathan Hyde</P>
<P>OK, so Anaconda is not going to go down in history as the greatest film ever
made. For that matter, not even anywhere near the top of the list. But it's
a fun little movie none the less. You simply have to take it for what it
is -- the kind of movie that you watch for some light entertainment, nothing
more, nothing less. I can say that I was disappointed in one area though,
and that was special effects. Before seeing this film, I kept hearing about
the great snake effects. Well friends, they might have been great compared
to the special effects on an old episode of Star Trek, but they weren't
anything to write home about compared to what audiences are used to today.
As computer generated animal effects go -- if you compared the snake in
Anaconda to the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park -- these effects look downright
cheesy. But that's OK, because it goes along well with the cheesy acting of
most of the film's stars. Most notably, Jon Voight. Now my guess is that
this was the effect that the filmmakers were going for, because Jon Voight
is just too fine an actor to give an over the top performance like this
without it being intentional. Although I do think he should have put a
little extra effort into what turned out to be a really bad accent. As I
said, the producers seemed to want to inject an element of camp into just
about every aspect of this film, and they certainly accomplished that goal.</P>
<P>The basic premise goes something like this -- a documentary film crew is
sailing up the Amazon River to make a movie. The crew includes Ice Cube and
bodacious babe Jennifer Lopez. Along the way, they meet up with snake hunter
Jon Voight. When one of the crew gets injured, Voight's character convinces
them to take a shortcut so they can get the man back to civilization for
medical attention. What they don't know is that his shortcut also happens to
be the home turf of a very large, and very mean, anaconda. The anaconda, by
the way, isn't accepting visitors.</P>
<P>In Anaconda, acting and plot take a back seat to the computer-generated
snake. Let's not pussyfoot around it, Anaconda is just one big showcase for
the snake. It is never a good idea when little things like plot are pushed
aside for the special effects. It becomes even worse when the special
effects stink. In some scenes the stupid snake looks so bad that you would
think that they had a bunch of 5 year olds with a pack of crayons doing the
animation. OK, maybe it's not that bad, but you get the point. When they
base a movie around special effects it would be nice if they actually had
spent money on the special effects. Or better yet, hired people who knew how
to create them properly.</P>
<P>Anaconda is campy -- not a bad thing had the snake made up for the camp. The
only reason I can really recommend this film would be for the fact that
Jennifer Lopez is hot and sweaty throughout. For my money, worth the price
of admission any day of the week. But other than Ms. Lopez's perspiration,
there is really nothing else that warrants an exuberant recommendation for
this movie.</P>
