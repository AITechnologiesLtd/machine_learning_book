<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>There is an attraction for this film, and it isn't the actors, although they
do very well.  It is Vienna.</P>
<P>The story centers around Jessie who seems to have lost out on a romantic
marriage with a Spanish woman.  He borders a train to Vienna where he is to
take a less expensive flight to the United States ( haven't heard this one
before.. ) and return home.  While en route he meets a young lady who is
also moving on.  Situations get strange on the train with a couple who is
having a bad day.  She switches seats and meets Jessie.  And he is in the
mood for something different, and romantic, before he leaves.  She accepts,
and despite her wants, they eventually decide that sex is not in the best
interest of the situation.</P>
<P>And they spend the whole night walking around Vienna talking about
themselves and their lives.  Nothing fancy. The film, here, takes on the
attitude of a spectator, and merely shoots the two as if they were another
monument in this city. And their discussion, while lacking the usual
dramatic stance of conflict, just seem to get along.  They manage to become
very good friends and perhaps meet again next year at a specified time. If
they do, that's when the story really will start.  Until then, this whole
thing seemed like a nice exercise in preparing actors for a performance.  It
doesn't feel ad-libbed, but it also does not  feel rehearsed.  The freshness
is nice, and the chemistry between the two comes off as very pleasant, and
enjoyable, making for a nice film, but one that may bore many a viewer, if
they are
expecting something to happen.</P>
<P>Beautifully filmed, and with a very nice touch for the background, this film
walks, much like the Kieslowsky films, but the comparison ends there.</P>
<PRE>A nice film.  Pleasant actors at work.</PRE>
<P>3.5 of 5 GIBLOONS
