<PRE>          !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>This is probably a film for Gerard Depardieu fans only.  It isn't great, it
isn't bad, and it has a few gags, and moments to keep us having some fun.</P>
<P>It is the story of a man and his daughter that go on a holiday, so he can
figure out what the hell he wants to do.  He is a hopeless romantic, and can
not make up his mind about the woman that loves him.</P>
<P>In the process, he ends up learning about his teenage daughter, who is
growing up ( literally ) and is having the time of her life, with her dad in
tow.  She ends up getting a few dates, and is in the way of learning
something, but she is having a terrible time, since she has started a habit
of lies, lies, lies, and stories, to make up for what she feels are her
inadequacies.</P>
<P>While not the funniest film around, it does have its good moments, and weird
bits.  But it is enjoyable, if not an ego acting showcase for Gerard
Depardieu, who is good.</P>
