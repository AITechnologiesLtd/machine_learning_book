Me, Myself & Irene </PRE>
<P>>From the Farrelly brothers, the guys behind "Dumb & Dumber," "Kingpin" and 
"There's Something About Mary" comes this year's challenge to tasteful comedy 
starring none other than Jim Carrey - the man who may actually be a living, 
breathing cartoon. It's a shame this movie's not a cartoon though because all 
the gags that are supposed to work here come off as childish, amateurish, 
dumb and unfunny. </P>
<P>Carrey plays Charlie - an overly friendly, gutless Rhode Island bike cop who 
one day snaps and develops a split personality whereby he becomes Hank - a 
ruthless, twisted enforcer. At first the extreme lengths "Hank" goes to in 
order to get his way are funny, but it's a joke that can't carry an entire 
film. Especially one where the plot is non-existent and the screenplay so 
poorly developed the cliches are about the only thing going for it. </P>
<P>The jokes here are intended to appeal to the modern audience's craving of the 
extreme, but it comes off as tired and unoriginal. The film's vulgarity quotie
nt is just absurd and offensive. </P>
<PRE>GRADE: C </PRE>
