<P>         Two years ago Sony Pictures signed Alicia Silverstone to a
two-picture deal reportedly worth $10 million. If you haven't heard
much about that coup lately, it's because ``Excess Baggage'' - their
seemingly jinxed first collaboration - has gone through numerous
re-shoots and been shuttled in and out of editing rooms for well over
a year now.</P>
<P>  All in vain, unfortunately: ``Excess Baggage'' still amounts
to a series of flaccid, go-nowhere scenes featuring a sullen
Silverstone and the inarticulate Benicio Del Toro (the least memorable
of ``The Usual Suspects''), an actor almost as alluring as a bowl of
rotting fruit.  Though Christopher Walken and Harry Connick Jr. turn
up occasionally along the way, they fail to relieve the general
dreariness.</P>
<P>  The threadbare story offers up Silverstone as Emily, a poor
little heiress who stages her own kidnapping to get the attention of
her business-minded daddy. Del Toro's Vincent is a master car thief
who inadvertently takes Emily for a ride, then can't shake her.</P>
<P>  Executive producer Silverstone may have seen this film as a
chance to segue from ``Clueless'' to ``Breathless,'' but what could
have been a rowdy romantic caper turns out to be a lethargic slog
across Washington State with two abrasive bores. As Emily and Vincent
vacantly snipe at each other, ``Excess'' has the feel of a
misconceived improvisation-comedy sketch that goes on interminably
without ever coming close to being funny.</P>
<P>  Del Toro's slurred speech and blurry eyes make him seem more
like Cheech and Chong's lost cousin than a hunky bad boy. And
``Excess'' is irrefutable evidence Silverstone needs a strong director
to bring out her effervescence, since it's nowhere to be found here.</P>
<P>  The movie's patchwork production is betrayed by the obvious
fluctuations in Silverstone's figure from scene to scene. ``Do you
like my tummy?''  Emily asks Vincent at one point, and you half-expect
him to answer, ``Which one?''.</P>
