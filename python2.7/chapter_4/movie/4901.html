<P>     THE ROOK is a lackluster murder mystery that transpires in a 
bizarre alternate reality.  Hal Hartley regular, Martin Donovan (TRUST, 
SIMPLE MEN, AMATEUR), plays John Cross, a by-the-book detective 
investigating the murder of a female linguistics professor.  Cross' 
world is a mixture of the modern and the archaic.  Rooms are lit by 
electric lights, computers are available for crime investigators, but 
the most common form of transportation is still the horse-drawn 
carriage.  England is in the midst of a revolution, with government 
forces having already lost Greenwich.</P>
<P>     Cross' inquiries lead him deeper into the murky politics of the 
revolution, and this is where the story begins to lose coherence.  Not 
only does THE ROOK's plot become difficult to follow, but the murder 
mystery lacks twists, red herrings, or surprises.  It's too 
straightforward, and Cross' character isn't interesting enough to keep 
us involved during such a pedestrian investigation.  </P>
<P>     THE ROOK is effectively atmospheric, and there are occasional 
scenes that function as pointed political commentary, but the main story 
doesn't work.  The film is dull when it should be engrossing, and the 
material is stretched ridiculously thin to reach feature length.  
Donovan, who typically plays understated roles, virtually vanishes into 
obscurity -- Cross has no personality.  </P>
<P>     Had THE ROOK spent more time exploring its unusual setting, the 
results might have been more satisfying.  As it is, however, the strange 
technological disparities and offbeat social climate become little more 
than window dressing for the pedestrian plot.  Even the lamest stories 
on PBS' MYSTERY offer more genuine suspense than director Eran 
Palatnik's sub-par effort.</P>
