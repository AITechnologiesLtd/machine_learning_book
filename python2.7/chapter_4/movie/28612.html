<PRE>CATS & DOGS
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>I have officially reached my quota for the year of talking animal
movies.  Dr. Dolittle 2 pushed me to the edge, and the animatronic
animal flick Cats & Dogs has pushed right over it, into a giddy oblivion
where I now firmly believe purple dinosaurs can communicate with humans
through song and dance.</P>
<P>Cats & Dogs is ridiculous and harmless, a Mission: Impossible for the
animal world.  For years, a secret high-tech espionage war has been
waged between the feline and canine races, right under the noses of
ignorant humans.  The spark of this high-tech war came about as the
result of the dog race overthrowing the then-dominating cat race during
ancient Egyptian times (they even ruled the human race).  Man's best
friend re-established the humans as the dominant race and has protected
that balance for years.  And a breakthrough for dogs is approaching, as
one human, Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum), is on the verge of
discovering an allergy vaccine which will enable all humans and dogs to
co-exist in peace.  The only problem is that the diabolic Mr. Tinkle
(voiced by Sean Hayes), a furry white Persian with the attitude of
Richard Grant's character from Hudson Hawk, and his small army of pesky
felines have "cat-knapped" the family dog Buddy, who has been guarding
the Professor and his family from the tuna-breathed fiends.  The
bodyguard job then falls on the shoulders of a Beagle pup named Lou
(voiced by Toby Maguire) -- who is mistaken as a secret agent dog by an
Anatolian Shepard named Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin).</P>
<P>Butch and his crew, which includes an Old English sheep dog named Sam
(voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) and a Chinese Crested named Peek
(voiced by Joe Pantoliano), train young Lou in self-defense and the best
ways to put a cat down for good.  Along the way, Lou and the crew face
crazed Siamese ninja cats, a Russian Blue who throws enough knives to
make Oddjob proud, and the tyrannical Mr. Tinkles, who declares in
moments of comedic brilliance that, "Evil does not wear a bonnet!"</P>
<P>It sounds ugly but hey, it's a kids movie and that's the audience that
will love it.  The animal training/acting is above par.  The computer
graphics are decent, but the animatronic talking dogs and cats resemble
the talking dolls on the boat ride at Disneyland's "It's A Small
World."  My biggest complaint with Cats and Dogs is that once again,
cats are demonized into evil incarnations that would have Jim Jones
shaking in his boots.  "Who Will You Root For?" the posters ask us?  The
film leaves you no choice at all.  [filmcritic.com is cat people. -Ed.]</P>
<P>The downfall of Cats & Dogs comes when the human characters start
dominating the film.  The cornball Hallmark-esque moments of family
bonding and issues of neglected children distract you from the sharp
comedy between Mr. Tinkle and his main henchman Calico (voiced by the
brilliant John Lovitz) as they discuss their vain attempt to take over
the world through "World Domination Pamphlets."</P>
<P>And I'd also like to know how the hell the dogs are able to afford to
build rocket ships and radar stations to keep this war going.</P>
