<P>Tempe, AZ -- "American History X" is one of those movies riddled with
problems that somehow escapes the benefit of audience testing and is
released anyway.  I wasn't too amused with all the confusing scene
shifts from past to present tense, only to recover by recall from
memory to keep things together (very distracting).  Without the
movie's change from color to black-and-white and Derek's change from
hair to skinhead, we would've all been lost.  And the script has
issues running in different directions without really gluing them
together, and we're not totally certain of a focused theme.  The
investors must be really pissed that some lame-ass didn't put all the
money in the right places, and probably spent a lot instead on
self-aggrandizing expenditures.  Standard fare for a lot of dweebs in
drug-infested Tinsel town today, I'm sure, where a lot of production
never quite makes it off the ground.</P>
<P>As is the case with any highly publicized movie, lots of reviews get
written (those advertising dollars build fires under people's asses),
and after reading many of them, I was left wanting more, as I felt I
wanted after watching the movie.  I longed to see if any critic delved
into the deep reaches that this theme explores, and read first-hand
the message I felt that came through loudest for me while viewing
"American History X".  But not one did, and most critics sang the same
old tune, which was to summarize the story, comment on the
special-effects crap, the actors and their dimension, dialogue, score,
cinematography, and how much or how hard the sex was and all the other
stuff to ad nauseam.  Like me, you probably are looking to see what
others have to say about this movie, and you already know all the
trivia shit.  And we want a little more meat.</P>
<P>The most pivotal point in the movie is during a flashback when Derek
(Edward Norton II) is in the prison laundry with Lamont, the black,
stand-up comic inmate (Guy Torrey).  We already know how much hate
Derek has had, given his father was killed by black drug addicts, and
dinner-table indoctrination against the evils of affirmative action.
When Lamont gives Derek direction on how to treat a woman so as not to
lose her while in the joint, each word punctuated with a sex-act
stroke (belly-laugh funny), the spectacle is too much for Derek to
remain angry any more and he can't help laugh with what must surely be
the first time ever with a black person.  We witness a friendship form
here, and when Derek finds out Lamont got six years for stealing a
television, Norton's superb acting convinces us that his character no
longer believes the enemy to be blacks, Koreans, border jumpers, and
illegal Hispanics, but instead a corrupt economic and social system
collapsing under its own weight.</P>
<P>At this point in the movie I expect and want a hero to rise up against
the real enemy -- the individuals responsible for corruption -- and
set out on a search-and-destroy mission.  But that doesn't happen.
Even though we have had superb character transformation and
motivation, Derek doesn't want to go on to do anything except turn on
his followers and try to save only his own ass and his brother.  We
really are cheated from what could become a greater movie.</P>
<P>There are problems telling stories about racism, the same as with
politics and religion (and now feminism, too).  We don't get to see
the true cause of Derek's hatred, which has less to do with his father
who was killed by blacks, and more with a society top-heavy with
blood-sucking parasites who skim all the cream from the top, leaving
the rest of us to fight over what is left.  In a world of plenty,
people don't argue over anything.  When was the last time we heard of
a feud between fat-cats?  Jews and Hispanics in Hollywood don't fight.
Neither do black and white athletes with seven-figure incomes.  But
they do in real life where competition and slimmer pickings can mean
you come up short.  Or when it means you get beat out of a job to a
border-jumper.</P>
<P>Problems today in society are so monumental, barely one person is left
who still sees real truth.  It's designed this way on purpose, the
same as SWAT teams use stun bombs to confuse and catch hostage-takers
off guard.  Our government does not want us to rise up against their
insane policies, much less find out, least they again experience Viet
Nam-era riots throughout the land.  I'm left wanting "American History
X" and Derek to pound home this message, but they don't.</P>
<P>Television is replete with newscasts daily of celebrity or
professional athletes who enter drug-treatment centers.  And how many
are ever convicted for possession and sentenced to twenty years in
prison?  America has a near-one-million felons in prison on drug
offenses, and barely a single one is a celebrity or of wealth.  This
is real injustice, and for one in which we want a Derek to rise up and
unite all against.</P>
<P>Racism has more origin in a corrupt and unfair system, than it does
with any dislike that one class of people may have for another.  Like
drinking-and-driving accidents produce hit-and-run felons, because the
consequences for accountability are so severe, corporations no longer
have compassion for employees because it's too expensive and the
consequences too grave -- bankruptcy.  And so, in a system where it's
every-man-for-himself mentality, justification for our capacity to
step on our fellow man is easy in a world with a press eager to help
demonize the poor who must now, just to survive, resort to theft,
deception and crime, and who most always are black, border-jumpers and
poor.</P>
<P>While "American History X" depicts an over-crowded America replete
with exploiting free-loading border-jumpers and unemployed blacks, it
fails to bring the real problem into focus.  We sense that Derek sees
through all the bullshit and now knows the real enemies,
profit-seeking structures and tax-fed organizations, which can no
longer flourish without a growing consumer base to draw from and sell
to.  And so borders are left open and families (and single women) are
encouraged, allowed, even motivated to multiply as quickly as biology
allows.  Naturally, as with any activity that makes money, Madison
Avenue successfully dupes mothers to produce at breeder-cow rate,
using slick pictures and detailed copy instructions in big-circulation
magazines and sit-com TV shows, and little if any thought is ever
given to the horrible consequence for offspring in an already
over-crowded, over-used world.</P>
<P>Overall, "American History X" is still a fair movie.  But its
producers blew a wonderful opportunity to make a statement for the
origins of racism, and leave a warm fuzzy feeling as was so eloquently
done in, for example, "Billy Jack" and "To Sir With Love".  A script
going in a different direction from Derek's transformation would have
helped solve this problem.</P>
