<P>Writer/director David Kane's Born Romantic is the kind of British romantic
comedy you see at a festival and walk out thinking it could be funny,
lighthearted and appealing enough to be the next The Full Monty. Then, after
you think about it for a while, or, God forbid, see it again, you realize
how little meat it has on its bones. That's not to say it's not enjoyable,
entertaining and well-acted - just empty and routine.</P>
<P>Romantic consists of three intertwining stories about men pursing women in
and around a London Salsa club. The stories are held together by Jimmy
(Adrian Lester, Love's Labour's Lost), a cabbie responsible for shuttling
the characters around the city (you might think he's the only hack in
London, if you don't count Arsenal's Patrick Viera). He chats with two
co-workers at Kismet Cabs (John Thomson and Spring Forward's Ian Hart)
during their breaks, providing the film with a fairly interesting Greek
chorus.</P>
<P>Here's a rundown of the men who are unlucky in love (but, if you've got half
a brain, you know they'll end up happier than John Ashcroft at a Bob Jones
University-sponsored Ku Klux Klan rally):</P>
<P>· Frankie (Craig Ferguson, Saving Grace) is a businessman who is divorced
but still living with his shrewish ex-wife (Hermoine Norris) until their
house, which is slowly sinking into the ground, is sold. He meets and falls
in love with the beautiful Eleanor (Olivia Williams, The Sixth Sense), who,
of course, wants nothing to do with him.</P>
<P>· Fergus (David Morrissey, Hilary and Jackie) is a struggling musician who
has returned to London after a six-year absence to find his long-lost love,
the sex-craved museum lover, Mo (Jane Horrocks, Little Voice).</P>
<P>· Eddie (Jimi Mistry) is a clumsy criminal who hides out in the Salsa club
after a botched ATM robbery attempt. He picks the pocket of a mousy girl
named Jocelyn (Catherine McCormack, Shadow of the Vampire), but ends up
falling for her.</P>
<P>And that's pretty much it. None of the characters are wacky enough to be
unbelievable, except possibly Jocelyn, who wears a neck-brace and runs a
funeral plot maintenance business called Loved Ones Limited. There's a lot
of dancing, a lot of chasing, and one strange gag about putting hot sauce on
a certain part of the male anatomy.</P>
<P>Kane made a bit of a name for himself with 1999's This Year's Love (which
also starred Hart and McCormack - and was unreleased in the U.S.), nabbing a
British Independent Film Award for his screenplay. Romantic is nicely
structured, but is ultimately predictable - a frustrating fact that you've
probably come to accept from mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies, but may
still be disappointed to see in indie films like this. Robert Alazraki (The
Closer You Get - another disappointing British rom-com with Mr. Hart)
provides nice photography, adding enough red hues to the Salsa club scenes
to make you seem like you're at a Tijuana donkey show.</P>
