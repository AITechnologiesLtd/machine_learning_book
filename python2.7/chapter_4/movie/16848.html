<P> Rushmore (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill
Murray and Olivia Williams.</P>
<P> Rushmore is one of the most original and quirky, yet charming, movies of
the year.</P>
<P> Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a young nerdy type who lives and dies
for his private school.</P>
<P> What he lacks in grades, he makes up for in enthusiasm and
extra-cirricular activities. This 10th grader is editor of the school
newspaper and yearbook; president of the French Club, German Club, Chess
Club, Astronomy Club; captain of the fencing and debating teams; and
founder and director of the Max Fischer players, who performs plays written
by, who else, Max Fischer.</P>
<P> Max lives in his own world of denial. He is attending Rushmore Academy on
a scholarship, but is placed on sudden-death academic probation because of
his terrible grades.</P>
<P> Yet Max continues to blithely to steer his own course. He falls madly in
love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher. To honor and
impress her, as well as win her favor, he works up a plan to construct an
enormous aquarium in her honor.</P>
<P> For the money, Max turns to Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), a steel tycoon and
one of the school's biggest benefactors.</P>
<PRE> A rapport develops between the two.</PRE>
<P> But their friendship unravels when the married Mr. Blume also falls in
love with Miss Cross.</P>
<P> Best friends become bitter rivals as Max and Blume use whatever means at
their disposal to try to destroy each other.</P>
<P> Wes Anderson's film, which he directed and co-wrote with Owen Wilson, is
not as dark as parts of it sound.</P>
<P> It is really rather genial, despite the mayhem that develops between Max
and Blume.</P>
<P> As Max, Schwartzman is a bit pompous, obtuse, determined, touching and
vulnerable. You admire him while simultaneously hoping he never moves into
your neighborhood.</P>
<P> Murray is a revelation as the rich Mr. Blume, a man-child with the
emotional stability of a teen-ager. He sinks to childish pranks to thwart
Max's pursuit of Miss Cross. Blume is a man who has difficulty expressing
his feelings. His own twin sons scorn him and he finds a surrogate in Max,
whom he sees as a younger version of himself.</P>
<P> Rushmore is a delight, a movie that should not be missed. If you're tired
of car chases, disasters and special effects, check out a movie about some
oddball people. You'll be glad you did.</P>
