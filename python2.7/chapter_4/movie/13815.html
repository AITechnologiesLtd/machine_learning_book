<P>   Teachers sometimes learn more from their students than
pupils learn from them (in fact they almost always do).  So
why should psychiatrists be any different?  In the classic case
of an analyst's being affected more by his patient than the
latter is influenced by him, Peter Shaffer's play "Equus," Dr.
Martin Dysart questions the vitality of his own life after hearing
of the unabandoned midnight rides of the obsessive Alan
Strang.  In the film "Regeneration," directed by Gillies
Mackinnon, based on Booker Prize-winning author Pat
Barker's novel, a psychiatrist is so distressed, upset, moved
by his shellshocked patients that he is in danger of
experiencing a breakdown himself.</P>
<P>   Allan Scott has adapted the book to the screen, a difficult
conversion in that Pat Barker's novel contained no scenes of
actual World War I battle.  Scott appended several scenes
from the trenches to give the audience a visual and emotional
understanding of what went through the minds of the Scottish
soldiers to cause them such anguish that they could no longer
fight.  In one case, that of Billy Prior (Jonny Lee Miller), the
officer went completely mute and could not recall the
traumatic event or events that rendered him incapable of
speech and therefore unable to command his unit.  In the
more politically and philosophically interesting situation,
Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby), an officer who received the
Iron Cross for bravery and one who is loved by his men, is
sent to the mental institution though he is perfectly sane.  An
educated man, he had written a pamphlet criticizing the British
government for pursuing what he calls a war of aggression
against the enemy, not a battle between English angels and
German devils.  Cynically enough, the hospital--with its
spacious grounds and caring professional care--exists not to
grant men who are serving their country the honest treatment
which is due.  Its purpose is to patch them up so that they
can be returned to active duty, the staff judged by their ability
to carry out this task.  It falls on the shoulders of Dr. William
Rivers (Jonathan Pryce) to persuade the very sane Siegfried
Sassoon to recant his declaration so that he may avoid
scandalizing the government any more.  If he refuses to
recant, he may have to remain in this safe sanitarium for the
duration of the war; but in doing so, he is likely to be afflicted
with the same survivors' guilt that threatens to envelope Billy
Prior.</P>
<P>   If the names Siegried Sasson and Dr. William Rivers sound
familiar, that is because the film and the book are based on
real characters.  Siegfried Sassoon is not only a brave soldier
who proves himself twice in combat but a mentor to the most
famous British bard of World War I themes, Wilfred Owen
(Stuart Bunce), whom Sassoon advises to stop writing poetry
about love and instead to transcribe lyrics from his own war
experiences.</P>
<P>   Director Mackinnon takes us from the muddy trenches
which saw much of the fighting in the First World War to the
hospital (actually a 13th century castle outside Edinburgh) and
back again to the front to give the viewers a realization of how
combat can provide the stress which leads to nervous
collapse.  He hones in on an experimental treatment actually
used by a Dr. Yealland (John Neville), shock therapy which
uses pain to compel patients to shape up and which works--
though it provokes questions of whether the end justifies the
means.  He explores a tender love affair between Billy Prior
and a local factory worker, a romance which helps the
formerly mute officer to recover his sanity without the anguish
of Dr. Yealland's questionable methods.</P>
<P>   Perhaps we're all overwhelmed by Steven Spielberg's
success in showing us the horrors of war in "Saving Private
Ryan" to be taken in by the obviously far less expensive
"Regeneration."  With Mackinnon's movie released just weeks
after Spielberg's, we're unable to appreciate the terror faced
by these officers in the trenches during the period 1914-1919. 
The pallid battlefield mise en scene is wholly unconvincing,
and in one particular instance--when Sassoon leads a furious
solo charge against a German bunker after seeing a friend
killed by a sniper--he looks like a kid playing army with his
pals.  Despite noble attempts by veteran actors Jonathan
Pryce, James Wilby and Jonny Lee Miller, their interplay lacks
chemistry, appearing more like a chit chat between friends
over afternoon tea.  </P>
<P>   "Regeneration" certainly has its purple heart in the right
place but the overall impression is one of a dour, inert
meditation more suitable to the printed page than the celluloid
stage.</P>
