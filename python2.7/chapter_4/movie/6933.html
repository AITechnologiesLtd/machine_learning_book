<PRE>                           THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE
                       A film review by Regis M. Donovan
                        Copyright 1997 Regis M. Donovan</PRE>
<PRE>Director: John Frankenheimer
Producer: George Axelrod
Exec Producer: Howard W. Koch</PRE>
<P>We are introduced to the members of a Korean War US Army unit,
including the remarkably unpopular Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Laurence
Harvey).  Then, Shaw's patrol is ambushed in Korean territory, loaded
onto what appear to be Soviet helicopters, and flown off into the
darkness.  Coming back after 3 days missing in action, Shaw is hailed
as a hero for saving his patrol; he receives the Medal of Honor.  When
he returns to the US, he is met by a celebration organized by his
manipulative machavellian mother as a publicity stunt for her husband,
the buffoon-like McCarthy-caricature Senator John Iselin.</P>
<P>This is the beginning of "The Manchurian Candidate", a political
thriller that doubles, in places, as a political satire.  Directed by
John Frankenheimer and starring Harvey, Frank Sinatra, Angela
Lansbury, and James Gregory.</P>
<P>After they return to the US, members of the patrol, including the
commander, Ben Marco (Sinatra), begin to have similar dreams: the
entire unit sits in what shifts between a women's horticulture
lesson to uniformed Soviet and Chinese officers and civilians
discussing brainwashing.  Marco eventually begins to suspect that
these are repressed memories, not dreams.</P>
<P>Marco -- when not falling in love, marrying, or having bizarre
conversations with Janet Leigh -- gradually remembers more of the
brainwashing as he investigates the mystery and discovers that Shaw
has been trained as a killer: triggered by his operators, never
remembering what he has done, unable to stop himself from carrying out
the orders he's been given.</P>
<P>The film wallows in paranoia, with Shaw being manipulated from all
sides, Iselin Red-baiting with drunken bombastic McCarthy-style rants
at his wife's instruction while she schemes, Shaw working to unravel
the mystery...  all while the plot builds to a crescendo of intrigue.</P>
<P>Harvey gives an admirable performance as Shaw, manipulated from all
sides; Sinatra is good as Marco.  And Angela Lansbury is outstanding
as the smothering, scheming puppet-master mother, pulling strings in
everyone around her -- a role that garnered her a Best Supporting
Actress nomination.</P>
<P>Released during the heyday of the Cold War (the same year as the Cuban
Missile Crisis, in fact) and unavailable for the next 25 years, the
film is a bit dated; in spite of this, the film is still a solid,
entertaining experience.</P>
