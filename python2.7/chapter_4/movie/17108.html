FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG (director: Mark Rappaport; cast: Mary
Beth Hurt, 1996)</PRE>
<P>A brilliant, witty mock documentary of Jean Seberg, that puts words in
her mouth that she might have approved of, but did not actually say,
these are Mark Rappaport's words. Proving once again, that she is being
exploited, though in a benevolent way, by a film that rails against her
exploitation. She was exploited by the director who discovered this
17-year-old in a nationwide star search for an unknown to play the juicy
part in his SAINT JOAN, that is, the irrepressible Otto Preminger, the
charming party guest, the publicity hound, and the tyrannical director
for women; and her second husband, Romaine Gary, who poked fun at her
political views and humiliated her in his films. There was also the
brief affair with the future star, Clint Eastwood, which meant nothing
to him and everything to her; and the F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover,
spreading malicious rumors about her, falsely saying she was pregnant
with a black child, trying everything possible to ruin her career and
life.</P>
<P>Mary Beth Hurt is a perfect Jean Seberg, looking and sounding like her,
exhibiting the easy way she talked, reflecting her small-town Midwestern
Iowa roots. This journal (a journal that she never kept) takes us
through her innocent years up to her suicide in 1979, when she was 40,
and was resolved in the knowledge that she couldn't be the somebody that
she wasn't.</P>
<P>Rappaport interestingly explores the early film life of Vanessa Redgrave
and Jane Fonda, who started out the same time she did and were roughly
the same age, and were exploited as much as she was, but who survived to
find their own identity and stardom. The difference between their
success and her failure, he points out, is that these stars had a
distinguished family name to see them through. This film is as much
about them as it is about her, covering the film industry with the
knowledge that, "it is called showbiz," he says, "not showart."</P>
<P>Her involvement with the Black Panthers shows that her motivation was to
be of help to the downtrodden, to get the kids a better education and
food in their belly, thinking that maybe violence was some kind of
answer to the poverty and injustice she saw in the black community.
By this time, her life had taken a downward turn, she was heavily into
drinking and taking drugs, her judgment was certainly questionable.</P>
<P>Preminger, the egotist he was, answered the critics who panned her
acting ability in Saint Joan, by giving her another starring part in one
of his films, realizing that they did it with such glee, partly because
they wanted him to fall on his face. But he wouldn't admit he was wrong
and immediately cast her in his next film, BONJOUR TRISTESSE. She played
the younger woman, in love with an older man. This is the film that the
French critic and soon to be New Wave cinema icon, Jean-Luc-Godard, saw
her in, and took her to Paris to play in the critically acclaimed
BREATHLESS. She was to appear in many films afterward, but her best role
might have been in a film few people saw or cared about, LILITH. Where
she holds her own with such future stars and scene stealers as Peter
Fonda and Warren Beatty.</P>
<P>This film challenges our credibility, it offers a fascinating look at
the world of make believe and the politics of the times, telling us
secrets that may or may not be true. It also enlightens us that Seberg's
stare into the camera was basically a no-no for an actor to do at that
time, but is now acceptable, making her a trend setter. In the
voice-over, he says that "she felt the camera was stealing her soul."
This is a clever film, immensely satisfying and enjoyable; and,
fortunately, the director casts Jean in a favorable light, she seems to
deserve that.</P>
