<P>A doubly welcome movie. It is very good. And it comes from Germany, a
country whose once glorious past in film took a tumble during the Nazi era,
except for a small number of movies. (Not all was propaganda then, contrary
to popular belief)</P>
<P>In the aftermath of World War II, German film, like much else, lay in ruins
and (always with exceptions) was undistinguished. In the 1960s, partly
influenced by the success of the French New Wave, there was a rebirth of
truly creative, high-quality, audacious productions, loosely labeled The
New German Cinema or The Young German Cinema (Kluge, Fassbinder, Herzog,
many others).But in more recent years (again with exceptions) there has
been a paucity of such works, mostly because the German public has ignored
the avant-garde in favor of commercial movies, predominantly American.</P>
<P>The not-strictly-commercial exceptions that found a public in Germany and
abroad have often dealt with the Nazi era, its preludes and aftermaths.
They are often fact-based too. The Harmonists fills that bill --with a
twist  Its focus is a group of musical performers, their rise and not
exactly their fall --since this would imply artistic disintegration--but
their dissolution within a barbaric political climate.</P>
<P>It  embraces the years from late 1927, during the Weimar Republic
(1919-1933) , through the mid-1930s, during Hitler's Third Reich.
Cinephiles may be glad to learn that the Weimar Republic's first President
was a socialist named Ebert, not Roger but  Friedrich.</P>
<P>It was time of all imaginable turmoil, social, political, of mass
unemployment, the newly  rich and the many newly poor. It was also a time
of amazing creativity in the arts, including the popular ones (see the
movie Cabaret). And a time of night life, daring sexuality, licentiousness
and excitement. For a while Berlin was the artistic the capital of Europe.</P>
<P>The movie tells,with some inventions and poetic license, the "true" story
of a singing/performing ensemble which became a huge hit in Germany and
abroad. Of late there has been a stage and concert revival in Germany and
the USA.</P>
<P>Among the innumerable, work-seeking starving artists is Harry Frommermann,
who is Jewish. This talented, despondent man reacts to the suggestions  of
Mr. Levy, an agent, with  "I'm not an actor, I'm a musician."  And it is as
a musician that he has a revelation on his Road to Damascus, so to speak.</P>
<P>He hears a recording by a black American group, The Revelers. A bulb lights
up in his head. Harry will try a German equivalent of that group. He places
a newspaper ad, selects five candidates (a pianist and four singers,
including a wonderful Bulgarian singing waiter), and forms an ensemble
which delivers German and American pop  and folk tunes in lively, precise,
harmonious and comical ways full of double-entendres and rakish allusions.
(They even have to explain to their Bulgarian member what "a growing
asparagus" stands for).</P>
<P>Call it an a capella group or a Teutonic variant of a barbershop quintet.
Someone eventually has the bright notion of baptizing it, in English
--except for the article-- Die Comedian Harmonists.</P>
<P>The film opens in 1935 Berlin, as the Harmonists, elegant in formal
clothes, now at the peak of their fame, sing on-stage the hit "Veronika" in
a version which includes one real instrument ,the piano, and several others
which the group imitates beautifully.</P>
<P>Flash back to December 1927, Harry's vision, the formation of the group,
their rehearsals, struggles, arguments, dissensions, tensions and all else
that leads to their acquiring their Harmonist identity. They rehearse for
six months, in sequences that are fascinating windows into musicality,
tactics and personalities. After a desperate deadline of an extra month,
the finally hit on the right formula.</P>
<P>Three of the six happen to be Jews. Among the others, the most forceful is
big, blond Robert Biberti. When push come to shove following a critical
audition by the then-nobodies, it is Robert who brazenly states to a
(presumably Jewish) impresario that he, Biberti, represents the financial
interests of the group. He ups the ante of the salary  with imaginary
offers. The impresario is not taken in, but plays along. He knows talent
when he sees  it. Throughout, Bob-the-Aryan's attitude is best described as
chutzpah.</P>
<P>The film is most adroitly edited, knowing exactly when to cut, never
allowing its scenes to overstay their welcome. It has lightness, humor,
effervescence.The singers are excellent. In reality, they do perfect
lip-synching to the sounds of  original  78 rpm recordings, magically
digitalized. It will fool you.</P>
<P>Past the early flashbacks the story continues with the Harmonists'
skyrocketing to fame, private lives and political situations. Bob, shown
living in a palatial suite, phones the concierge to ask for a call-girl in
the matter-of-fact way you ask for breakfast to be brought up. " Not too
voluptuous. She must look like a student trying to make extra money." But
then, there is another, real student, Erna. She works at the music store of
a charming old Jewish couple who remind me a bit of the couple in
Casablanca.</P>
<P>Harry loves Erna. Erna seems sweet on Harry. Then Bob too falls for Erna.
And so on. There are ambiguities about her, as in many other aspects of the
film. To what extent the details are truly biographical, I cannot tell.
However, rather than intrude into the story, those relationships and others
flesh it out and humanize the Harmonists. (The amusing fact is that the
actors who play Bob and Erna are brother and sister in real life).</P>
<P>What intrudes, and with a horrible vengeance, is Adolf Hitler and his
minions. The now renowned Harmonists have to face anti-Semitism, which
raises its monstrous head for the first time at a swimming pool. No doubt
this is a filmic simplification, since awareness of the problem must have
existed already --especially in artistic circles with their huge numbers of
German Jews.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the shock becomes a quake when Bob and Harry arrive at
the music store as S.A. men  (Brownshirts) break the glass (a prelude to
the 1938 Kristallnacht), tear up the place, abuse verbally and bodily Erna
and her bosses. The owners cannot understand this. They are Germans and
patriots, love the country, in the late war lost a son---all this will
pass, no doubt.</P>
<P>The thread of Jewish incomprehension runs throughout the film. I recently
saw the Spielberg-produced, Oscar-winning documentary The Last Days, about
Hungarian Jews. Like the German Jews, the Hungarians were so "assimilated"
that they could not imagine anyone harming them during World War II, and
they hardly believed the rumors of death camps. Until their turn came.</P>
<P>In The Harmonists, no anti-Semitism is shown within the group and their
circle. In fact, one of the men's girls converts to Judaism in order to
marry her lover. The wedding has klezmer music, enormous brio, and none of
the satire that one finds in many such ceremonies in American movies, by
Jewish filmmakers too. (This is no criticism. When you feel free, you can
afford to laugh at yourself).</P>
<P>During Hitler's early reign, Bob and Harry are summoned to the Nazi
Artists' Chamber. A high official points out to them that "half of your
people are non-Aryan," but, given their admirers in high places he'll try
to find a solution. Then he asks them to autograph one of their records.
Clever irony.</P>
<P>Soon after comes the request that the group go to the palatial home of
Gauleiter Julius Streicher, as rabid a Jew-hater as any, if not more (he
was hanged after the Nuremberg War Crimes trials). There, among a host of
uniformed Party members, Streicher requests  a folk song with lyrics by the
great Romantic poet Eichendorff. Harry gets physically sick, the others
say: "We'd be grateful if we don't have to sing this particular song."</P>
<P>I confess that I was baffled.I don't know what the upsetting reference is
here, nor how historically true this Streicher "invitation" was.</P>
<P>Racist tension mounts. An invitation to sing in America arrives. In New
York, on the USS Saratoga and elsewhere the group gives rousing renderings
of American songs and marches. The New World is like Paradise. Though most
Harmonists are tempted to stay there,they do return to Germany. There, the
audience at a sold-out concert is chockfull of Nazi uniforms. An
announcement that comes as a thunderbolt both to the dumbfounded performers
and the audience tells them that the group is now banned after this, their
last concert. The Harmonists deliver  one of their trademark "serious"
kitschy songs (about a bit of heaven, somewhere, sometime). Moved, the
public mobs them. True ? Invented?</P>
<P>The Jewish members, plus Erna, go straight to America. It's an historically
incorrect, simplified finale, but I suppose that their real peregrinations
(in Europe, even in Australia) before settling in the USA, would require
another half-hour of film. Not that it is long at 114 minutes. There are no
dead moments, no dull scenes. The movie has a lot more than meets the eye.
And what meets the ear is enchanting.</P>
