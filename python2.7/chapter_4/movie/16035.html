<PRE>Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 19 December with Lothlorien at the SONY Village East for $8.75</P>
<P>Ever see a movie where too much and too little was happening
simultaneously? That's the problem with *Star Trek: Insurrection* in a
nutshell. Or perhaps it just that, as Lothlorien put it, it's just a long
episode of the TV show (that being *Star Trek: The Next Generation*). This
is the ninth *Star Trek* movie, and the third of the "next generation."</P>
<P>The plot, in a nutshell: On a ringed planet, the Baku are an agrarian race
resembling humans in every way who turn out to be ageless Luddites, having
eshewed technology centuries before. Their activities are observed by the
Federation and its new allies, the Sona--observed unseen until android Lt.
Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) goes berserk, does't respond to orders and
shoots at the secret HQ until its cloaking device fails.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, it becomes obvious that the Sona and the Federation are in an
unholy alliance as they plot to relocate the Baku and capture the helpful
radiation from the planet's rings. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick
Stewart) is appalled by the plan to relocate the 600 Baku, as it
interferes with the Prime Directive to not interfere with cultures, and he
leads a revolt on humanitarian grounds. That, and he has a love affair of
sorts with a 300-year-old Baku woman, Anij (Donna Murphy) who doesn't look
a day older than 45. Must be that Oil of Olay.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Data "learns how to be a child" from the 12-year-old Artim (),
who doesn't look a day older than 13.</P>
<P>That's all well and good. However, there are two problems: The
less-than-compelling story limps along, and an overabundance of explosions
and shootouts that don't distract you from a lack of pacing and story
development.</P>
<P>What fans of the show will like are the in jokes and character development
of their favorites. However, many dramatic moments are missed in a
somewhat confusing and unfocused array of twists that occur during
aforementioned spectacles (shooting, explosions, mass migrations, chase
sequences, etc).</P>
<P>What *is* entertaining here is the dialogue, the relationships between the
established characters, the comedy (e.g., Picard and Worf (Michael Dorn)
singing Gilbert & Sullivan to the out of control Data), and little touches
(like Worf undergoing, again, the pains of Klingon adolescence on the
rejuvenating planet).</P>
<P>The special effects are scattershot as well, although the Sona's hi-tech
versions of reconstructive surgery, administered by intergalactic versions
of video babes a la Robert Palmer's "Addicted to Love" girls, is amusing.
The Sona, by the way, look like living mummies, and ooze body fluids and
crack their skin when they get mad.</P>
<P>The performances range from adequate to entertaining, with the best ones
turned in by Stewart, Spiner, and F. Murray Abraham as the vengeful Sona
leader Ru'afro.</P>
<P>A final problem that actor and director Jonathan Frakes (a/k/a Cmdr.
William Riker) should take note of in the future: Don't shoot so much in
direct sunlight. Much of the action takes place in daylight on what surely
looks like the lot where they filmed all the Planet of the Apes movies.
Sci-fi often works better with the dark blanket of outerspace and the
artificial lights of the spacecraft and the computers. Never has daylight
seemed so... dull.</P>
