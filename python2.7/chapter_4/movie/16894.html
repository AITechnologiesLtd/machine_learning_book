_8MM_ (R) ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>As his follow-up to the candy-colored camp catastrophe that was
_Batman_&_Robin_, director Joel Schumacher has gone to the opposite extreme
with the lurid thriller _8MM_.  Schumacher obviously intended this
down-and-dirty film to cleanse his artistic soul, and while _8MM_ certainly
is better than that infamous franchise killer (then again, what wouldn't
be?), the film is grainy and unfocused as the object at the center of the
plot.</P>
<P>That object is a so-called "snuff" film, a pornographic work in which the
woman is killed.  The film is found in the safe of a recently deceased
millionaire, and private detective Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is hired by
the millionaire's widow (Myra Carter) to investigate its origin and track
down the family of the young girl who was brutally killed in it.</P>
<P>The mystery is just a perfunctory device for screenwriter Andrew Kevin
Walker to get to his main concern, which is the psychological effects Tom
feels takes when he becomes immersed in the seedy world of underground
porn.  But did it have to be so perfunctory?  Walker doesn't even bother to
hide the fact that it is a mere device.  The mystery is more or less
resolved in an overblown sequence that comes at the end of act two, and the
revelations are contrived and incredibly underwhelming.  While that may be
some sort of sly in-joke on Walker's part, to the viewer, it is simply an
unsatisfying cheat.</P>
<P>But once the mystery is out of the way, and Walker frees himself to zero
in on Tom's psyche, the movie does get better, and it finally gives Cage
something meaty to work with.  The pain and anguish of his downward spiral
are acutely felt through Cage's chillingly convincing performance.  But by
this point, the movie is nearly over, with two-thirds of it having been
spent on characters plot mechanics that, for the most part, bear little to
no weight in the end.</P>
<P>_8MM_ is a competent attempt by Schumacher to reclaim his directorial
voice after suffering the grind of a blockbuster studio franchise.  Yet
while a directorial voice does rings throughout _8MM_, it is not
Schumacher's--rather, it's that of David Fincher, helmer of Walker's
_Se7en_; Schumacher apes his style from the ample rain to the deliberate
pacing.  _8MM_ may indeed be a step up from Schumacher's last film, but he
still has a few more steps to go before recapturing his own artistic identity.</P>
