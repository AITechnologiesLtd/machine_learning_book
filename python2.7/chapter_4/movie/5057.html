<PRE>                                 PRIMAL FEAR

<PRE>Oh, Puh-leeze!</PRE>
<P>     My date and I both walked out of this movie with the same reaction
- "We wasted a Saturday night on this?" Movies like this aren't filmed,
they're programmed. Here's how it's done:</P>
<P>1. Turn on the computer, call up the software for "star vehicle for
aging sex symbol - male"</P>
<P>2. Plug in the name of Richard Gere, because he can't act his way 
out of a paper bag, but he looks great for 46 and you can generate 
word of mouth by getting columnists to discuss the merits of his 
neck wrinkles over Robert Redford's.</P>
<P>3. Plug in a plot that plays on people's fears of corrupt politics,
corrupt law and Archbishops who diddle little boys in the back room.</P>
<P>4. Finish up with a female lead who can't seem to get over the fact 
that her opposing council on a major trial is an ex-lover who 
treated her badly, and who she'd go back to in a heartbeat, for 
reasons that no one can figure out except maybe a penchant for neck 
wrinkles. I loved her seething indignation when her ex baited and 
manipulated her and how somehow she dissolved into his arms at the 
end because - not in spite of the fact, but because - he completely 
ruined her. It was so distasteful, it might as well have been a rape 
scene where she started to enjoy herself. Hollywood - WAKE UP!</P>
<P>     My date was an attorney, so we at least had some fun dissing the
legal inconsistencies. Testimony is stricken that is later referred to
in court - hello? A sideline of questioning that is relevant to the
plot but - oops! - not the trial is allowed. I watched every "L.A. Law"
episode ever made, and Mike, or Grace or Arnie or Victor would've
gotten hooted out of L.A. County Court for trying some of this stuff.</P>
<PRE>Don't bother.</PRE>
