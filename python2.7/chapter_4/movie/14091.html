<PRE>                             MY GIANT 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                      Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon

<P>Cast: Billy Crystal, Gheorghe Muresan, Kathleen Quinlan, Zane Carney,
Steven Seagal, Joss Ackland
Director: Michael Lehmann
Producers: Billy Crystal, Peter Schindler
Screenplay: David Seltzer</P>
<P>Why have Billy Crystal's films been so disappointing of late? I think
the answer lies in the fact that when he plays the main lead – he has a
tendency to be overpowering, like a spilt bottle of perfume in a small
room. The screen is over-permeated with Billy and this is the problem
with MY GIANT. His co-star Gheorge Muresan, is big, but has zero
personality. With nothing to counteract Crystal, it's like he's just
talking to a wall and that's what Billy does in this movie – he talks to
himself.</P>
<P>The fact that giant Gheorge, doesn't carry much charisma or charm, does
not help the cause. The poor darling suffers from acromegally, a
hormonal imbalance that results in overgrowth. We are meant to feel
sorry for his dilemma of being cursed with being big and for his
impossible search for love. Unfortunately, his accent is so thick that
it comes across like a rumble of thunder – vaguely understandable.</P>
<P>The highlight of the movie is undoubtedly Steven Segal. MY GIANT was
badly in need of life, and I started wishing that a Segal action
thriller would take over (not a good sign). Unfortunately, there were no
thrown daggers, kicking heads or gunfire. I badly needed be entertained
and woken from the monotony of the overwhelming, characteristic Crystal
whine. I believe that Billy Crystal does best when he is co-starring and
providing the comic relief for otherwise serious acting. Either that or
hosting the Oscars.</P>
