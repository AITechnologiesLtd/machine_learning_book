<PRE>                               BEDAZZLED
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>     There truly is nothing quite like a Brendan Fraser movie, is
there?  Encino Man, Dudley Do-Right, Mrs. Winterbourne... these are the
films that a generation uses to mark the passage of time.</P>
<P>     It's nigh time we added another sparkling gem to the 30-picture
oeuvre that is The Brendan Fraser Experience... and that gem is
Bedazzled, a limp remake of a 1967 Dudley Moore vehicle -- a Dudley
Moore vehicle which was also co-written by Dudley Moore.  Just so you
know we're working with some stellar raw material here.</P>
<P>     The high concept of Bedazzled gives us Elizabeth Hurley as the
devil (Peter Cook played him in the original), who gives Fraser's
über-nerd Elliot seven wishes in exchange for his soul.  Hurley makes a
surprisingly believable Satan.  Up close, her angular features and
hollow gaze make her as frightening as she is gorgeous, not to mention
the annoying bouncy walk that makes you dizzy to watch and a wardrobe
change factor that clocks in at once every six minutes.</P>
<P>     Elliot dreams up every wish he can think of to try to make his
office crush Allison (Frances O'Connor) fall for him.  Soon he's a
Columbian drug lord, then a basketball star, then an effete socialite. 
But naturally, that darned devil somehow makes it all go wrong!  Elliot
needs to watch more episodes of Bewitched! to learn the dangers of
wishing improperly.</P>
<P>     As each wish turns out worse than the last, we are offered the
chance to laugh at the wacky antics on display before us.  Look, Elliot
can suddenly speak Spanish!  Look, Elliot suddenly speaks like a moron! 
Look, Elliot is suddenly very smart!  Of course, you may choose not to
laugh at many of these scenes if you wish.  I know I didn't.</P>
<P>     Bedazzled drags its one-joke scenes through far too many
poorly-timed comic moments, with each of its hokey-jokey sequences going
on for far longer than is humanly funny (notably one scene about Elliot
having been given a small willy becomes truly painful).  Of course, I
guess this is unavoidable if you're simply trying to pad out 90 minutes
of screen time with something.</P>
<P>     To try and spice things up, director Harold Ramis inserts the
supporting cast of Elliot's co-workers into each vignette, where they
reappear as new characters.  Wow, inventive!  Then there are numerous
and utterly bizarre "comedy" moments, complete non-sequiturs to the
film, which are used as interludes between each "wish" sequence.  Mostly
this consists of Hurley's devil causing traffic accidents, etc.  You
know, just for kicks.</P>
<P>     And what's with Frances O'Connor as the romantic lead?  O'Connor,
best known (okay, solely known) for starring in the recent Mansfield
Park, with her jutting forehead and wallflower stage presence, makes for
a love interest about as exciting as a wet brick.  Jeez, why not have
Hurley and Fraser get it on?  I guess we'd bust through PG-13 with
something like that.</P>
<P>     Aside from a few juvenile giggles, there's not much in Bedazzled
worth mentioning.  The movie is so limp it is all but forgotten on the
ride home.  So what was I saying?</P>
