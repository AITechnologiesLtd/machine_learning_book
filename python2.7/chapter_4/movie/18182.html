<P>If you plan to see "The Mummy," there are a few things you should 
know. First, although loosely based on the well-known monster movie, 
it's not particularly scary. Instead of trying to frighten us, the 
filmmakers elected to make an "Indiana Jones" style adventure tale. 
Second, as an "Indiana Jones" derivative, it's not particularly 
involving. The story takes forever to get rolling and the convoluted 
plot serves mostly as an excuse to whip out loads of flashy special 
effects. Third, some of those effects are nifty, but few are 
convincing and too many are simply cheesy. Fourth, most of the jokes 
aren't funny. Apparently realizing their creation was structurally 
unsound, the filmmakers attempt to distract viewers with an endless 
stream of wisecracks from the principal characters. Wrapping things 
up (ahem), I suggest you skip "The Mummy." </P>
<P>The plot goes like this. In the mid-1920s, a plucky librarian (Rachel 
Weisz) reluctantly hires a ne'er-do-well adventurer (Brendan Fraser) 
to search for ruins of the ancient Egyptian city Hamunaptra, buried 
deep in the desert. They travel the Nile along with a competing team 
of cowboys bent on plundering the treasures of Hamunaptra. Once in 
the city, an unusually nasty mummy called Imhotep is accidentally 
raised from the dead by the cowpokes. The cranky 3,000-year-old 
immediately begins snagging body parts from those who released him, 
hoping to reconstitute his body so that he can unleash plagues on 
Egypt and bring his girlfriend back to life, presumably to rule the 
world at his side. And you thought Bill Clinton was a contemporary 
phenomenon.</P>
<P>"The Mummy" could have worked as a horror story, an adventure tale, 
or even a spoof, but writer-director Stephen Sommers ("Deep Rising") 
stumbles by haplessly trying to combine all three. While taking crib 
notes from the "Indiana Jones" movies, he should have studied more 
carefully, because he makes some fundamental errors here.</P>
<P>To succeed, films of this genre require a memorable villain. "The 
Mummy" starts with one, but undermines its effectiveness through bad 
writing. Even in the most dire circumstances, the lead characters 
continue trading one-liners as if they were playing flag football on 
a Sunday afternoon instead of facing death from a supernatural 
malevolent creature - - if they don't take the monster seriously, why 
should we? </P>
<P>Fraser and Weisz spend so much time swapping comedic insults that 
they come off like a road company version of Sam and Diane from 
"Cheers." They are lightweights; two crazy kids on a madcap escapade. 
Brendan Fraser is a talented actor, but the script cripples his 
character, casting him as an enterprising puppy dog instead of a real 
swashbuckler. As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford tossed off his share of 
caustic remarks, but he clearly recognized his opponents as genuine 
menaces. Fraser's character seems more like a big kid on nitrous 
oxide during a marathon paintball tournament.</P>
<P>The impact of the storyline is also lessened by the way the 
characters deal with death. A large number of cast members die 
gruesomely, but their friends show virtually no emotional reaction. 
Only once in the entire movie does anyone pause to display a moment 
of regret that a friend has been killed. </P>
<P>After a while, my investment in the storyline disappeared completely 
and I just sat back and watched the special effects while waiting for 
the overlong film to end. "The Mummy" overflows with computer 
generated images of varying degrees of originality and quality. A 
prologue in ancient Egypt shows a lavish rendering of Hamunaptra in 
its prime, but the backgrounds are chintzy matte paintings and the 
computer renderings have that overly creamy look, similar to the CGI 
films shown in motion simulator rides. </P>
<P>Later, flesh-eating bugs create some minor scares, although they too 
have the same cut-rate CGI appearance. Images of faces mystically 
appearing in sandstorms are more effective and shots of freshly 
revived mummies, while reminiscent of the skeletal version of the 
"Terminator," are nicely rendered. But effects do not a movie make 
and all the flashy imagery in "The Mummy" can't compensate for its 
soulless feel. </P>
<P>The few scenes I enjoyed featured Bernard Fox, Dr. Bombay from the 
old "Bewitched" TV series, as a dotty soldier of fortune. I had no 
idea the veteran actor was still alive and his blustery performance 
was a pleasure. In just a few minutes of screen time, he showed more 
personality than the rest of the cast combined.</P>
<P>In his review of "The Mummy," Roger Ebert gave the film three out of 
four stars, acknowledging that it was trash, but arguing that it was 
enjoyable trash. I understand the sentiment, but his choice surprises 
me. If I'm in the mood for a so-bad-that-it's-good movie, I'll seek 
out something memorably awful, like "Roadhouse" or "Showgirls." "The 
Mummy" isn't bad enough to make my guilty pleasure list. It's merely 
one more overblown exercise in big budget lameness.</P>
