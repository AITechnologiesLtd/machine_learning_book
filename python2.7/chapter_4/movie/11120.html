<P>The Real Blonde (R) 1/2* (out of ****)
        A woman's face, an arm, some pumped-up pectorals, blond hair, a man's sad
face, slender legs, a random hand here and there.  As the opening credits
of Tom DiCillo's The Real Blonde unfold, these scattered, fractured
glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad
man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman, his head concealing her
unclothed breasts.  If only the rest of this formless, aimless ensemble
comedy assembled so coherently.
        Joe (Matthew Modine) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs
in commercials or soap operas.  He's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his
relationship with his live-in love, Mary (Catherine Keener), who holds some
subconscious hostility toward the male gender.  Mary, a makeup artist,
regularly works on model Sahara (Bridgette Wilson), who is obsessed with
the underlying messages in Disney's The Little Mermaid.  The bottle blonde
has a turbulent on-again, off-again relationship with Bob (Maxwell
Caulfield), a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde, which
he finds in co-star Kelly (Daryl Hannah).  As the film unspools, a variety
of other characters pass through: fashion photographer Blair (Marlo
Thomas); Mary's shrink (Buck Henry) and self-defense instructor (Denis
Leary); Joe's casting agent (Kathleen Turner) and hardass boss (Christopher
Lloyd); and a mystery woman (Elizabeth Berkley) who keeps on crossing Joe's
path.
        Where exactly does all this go?  That's a question best posed to
writer-director DiCillo, who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue
himself.  His meandering, largely unfunny script and direction are like
hopelessly lost drivers, turning into dead-end narrative streets only to
reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac.  And another.  And
another.  At one point Bob, frustrated with the soap scripts, complains to
the head writer (Jim Fyfe) that his and Kelly's characters keep on going in
circles, with no hint of development or growth.  That is most certainly the
case here.  Joe gets a job and ultimately botches things; he and Mary
bicker; they make up, only to have the pattern repeat itself.  Unhappy with
his bottle blonde, Bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied; he returns
to the faux and is still unsatisfied.  If there is a point to all of this,
DiCillo dances around it, spending his time on apparent digressions that,
as it turns out, aren't digressions at all.
        The Real Blonde is not without some amusements.   It does have the
occasional funny line and situation; Leary, Henry, Lloyd, Steve Buscemi,
and Dave Chappelle shine in their small roles; Keener is a likable,
refreshingly earthy lead; Berkley's appearance is mercifully brief (she
receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute
role); and there is the irony of having Caulfield play a wildly popular
soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket (last year, the actor was fired
from the daytime drama All My Children after a scant six months--due to
lack of viewer interest).  But on the whole, The Real Blonde is a
frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be
glossy on the surface, but there's nothing going on inside.  (opens
