<PRE>                                ANNA KARENINA
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Everything about the film is lush and beautiful.  From the wonderful
photography that enhances every bit of film, to the breathtaking decor
in the ballroom and on the skating rink, to the well-chosen cast, the
film is a winner. Anna (The French Sophie Marceau) has a classically
lovely face.  Her every emotion, her passionate love affair with Count
Vronsky (Sean Bean)  is revealed in her eyes.   We know at once that
the affair will override losing her husband (James Fox) and risk the
loss of the child she adores,   Nothing can stop the passion  since she
first lays eyes on the Count.   Little wonder that it has always been
and still is a timeless story, one that people who love good literature
continue to read.</P>
<P>Tolstoy included in his story that of another marriage, the everlasting love affair of Levin (Alfred Molina) and his stunningly beautiful wife, Kitty (Mia Kirshner) to contrast the two marriages with which the film concerns itself.</P>
<P>The acting by all five principals, Marceau, Bean, Fox, Molina and Kirshner, are all perfection and in keeping with the era, a time only a few years before the Russian Revolution.   The movie is further enhanced by the music of
Tschaikowsky, Prokofiev and Rachmaninoff (even if some of the music was written after the time of the film).</P>
<P>A hint of why a revolution was inevitable (but only a hint) is seen
when Kitty is breathlessly running through the mansion room to get to
the ballroom so she can dance.   As she is about to enter, a servant
picks up the trailing skirt and hands it to her and she, without so
much as a glance at him, accepts the skirt part which she now holds in
one hand and joins the dance.  For a fleeting moment, seeing the many
servants one wonders about the Russian people who are outside, unseen,
and poverty-stricken.  None of that is allowed by the director to
intrude on the gay, happy life of those who were "in" . . . nor was it
allowed by the noblemen and women of that era.  Nevertheless, a fine
film!</P>
