<PRE>Ice Storm
A Film Review By Michael Redman
Copyright 1997 By Michael Redman</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>There's something resplendent about a winter ice storm that few people ever
experience as they huddle inside awaiting the thaw. Viewing from safety
through the glazed glass gives a distorted view of the beauty and the danger
outside in the extremes.</P>
<P>During the early seventies the suburbs were a questionable refuge from the
whirlwind of change sweeping through the country. As the trappings of the
cultural and sexual revolution became mainstream and seeped into those
shelters, it happened without much of its soul. The exploration of the sixties
turned into the "Me Decade" in a few short years.</P>
<P>In 1973 Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is doing everything right. Married to a
beautiful woman, he has a successful career, two kids and a modern house in
the hamlet of New Canaan, Connecticut. It should be enough, but his life feels
empty. His loveless affair with neighbor Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) isn't
helping much. When he wants to talk, she responds "You're boring me. I have a
husband. I don't have a need for another one."</P>
<P>Ben and Janey are indeed bored, not just with their spouses and each other,
but with everything they do. Like the rest of their friends, they are grasping
at straws searching for something to make them feel alive. They want to live
on the edge from the comfort of their living rooms.</P>
<P>In direct contrast, the children are embracing life, fumbling though they may
be. Paul Hood (Tobey Maguire) is away at boarding school and coming to grips
with his own sexuality attempting to get the attention of an attractive girl
before his Don Juan roommate gets to her first.</P>
<P>His younger sister Wendy tests her own sexual power with Janey's sons Duckie
(Adam Hann-Byrd) and Mikey (Elijah Wood). There's a great scene where she's
wearing a grotesque Nixon mask while Mikey lies on top of her in a basement
family room. "Take down your pants and I'll touch it, but that's all," she
tempts him. When Ben walks in on them after being abandoned in Janey's bed
upstairs, it's a snapshot of seventies suburban life.</P>
<P>Painfully shy Duckie spends most of his time attaching M-80s to model planes
and blowing them up in flight. His response to Wendy's propositions is fright.
He's outgrown his toys but can't quite figure out what to do about it.</P>
<P>All of this sexual tension comes to a head the day after Thanksgiving. The
adults of the neighborhood attend a "key party" where the men put their car
keys in a bowl and the women pick out a set to determine their partner for the
night. While the joyless wife-swapping party takes place, an ice storm rages outside.</P>
<P>The kids head out to partake of the tempest while their parents nervously
banter with each other. It's hazardous out there, but that's where life is.
It's only by venturing into the unknown that anything meaningful happens as
they will all discover. The only way to navigate the alien are with your eyes
wide open -- something no one in the film does. The children are too
inexperienced and the adults, too filled with ennui.</P>
<P>Surprisingly director Ang Lee ("Sense And Sensibility") does a good job
representing the era since he didn't move to the US from Taiwan until 1978. As
with many period pieces, there's a bit too many in-your-face artifacts. During
the first half you'll grow tired of waterbeds, ugly hairstyles and those
atrocious fashions, but they aren't shoved down your throat in the same manner
that they were in "Boogie Nights".</P>
<P>Stepping out of the theater on a crisp winter's night with ice crunching
beneath your feet, you'll realize that we are all slipping around out there in
the wilderness in one way or another. About the most we can hope for is that
we make it through with some measure of grace.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has celebrated over 22 winter holiday seasons while writing
these columns. He's still awaiting the Christmas spirit.)</P>
