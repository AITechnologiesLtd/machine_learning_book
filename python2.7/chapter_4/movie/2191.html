<PRE>                                  CAREFUL
                       A film review by Max Hoffman
                        Copyright 1993 Max Hoffman</PRE>
<P>Rating: 9 (on a scale of 1->10)
(I'd give it a 10, but it's very low-budget)
Seen: Mon Oct 11, 93, SF's Castro Theatre</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Guy Maddin
Cast: Kyle McCulloch, Gosia Dobrowolska, Sara Neville, Brent Neale,
      Paul Cox and Jackie Burroughs.</P>
<P>     The USA Film Festival described this as Twin Peaks directed by
Erich von Stroheim.  Not a bad description. It's an uproarious satire,
in the vein of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN ... but the film often so
beautifully duplicates the material it parodies that your breath is
taken away. It's a little like reading a hysterical comic book, and
finding original paintings by old masters salted throughout!</P>
<P>     This brilliant Canadian film heavily borrows from the high-camp
expressionism of German silent films, especially the "mountain" films
of Leni Riefenstahl.  Anyone who's read FROM CALIGARI TO HITLER will
recognize dozens of scenes in this film as near carbons of stills from
the book. Perhaps more than any other films before or since, German
silent cinema created compelling images that tap into universal race
consciousness, portraying grainy, moving archetypal images all of us
vaguely recognize from dreams or nightmares. Because of this, CAREFUL
will often take your breath away with unexpected moments of quiet
majesty and beauty. But there are plenty of laughs in between, (with
"sick," 70's style National Lampoon-like humor). If you've never
laughed at seeing an eye poked out, leave political correctness at the
door and give this film a whirl!</P>
<P>     The soundtrack if often deliberately scratchy or muffled, and in
several scenes easter-egg like colors are used that resemble the early
two-strip technicolor process. Ominous title cards are used to
introduce scenes. This bizarre film is salted with unexpected dialogue
like this:
     BOY: "My, aren't you the frisky one today."
     GIRL: "Even the reindeer are such, when Spring is coming!"</P>
<P>     Enough of the aesthetics, what is the film supposedly about? The
action takes place in the 19th century alpine village of Tolzbad, that
is so precariously poised under constant threat of avalanche that
villagers have learned to communicate only in whispers. Animals have
had their vocal chords removed, and gramophones have lambs wool stuffed
in the horn.  Villagers keep time to the "sound" of silent instruments
at a "concert."  There are handful of soundproof ice caves where the
villagers can frolic and shout, letting out their pent up, pagan
passions. The film is clearly a biblical parable about repression.
Jackie Burroughs does a brilliant bit part as the puritanical teacher,
who closely resembles the Cloris Leachman role in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.</P>
<P>     All of the characters display a surface naivete; actresses speak
in the perky, breathless voices reminiscent of badly dubbed post-war
European B films, "strapping" young sons still wear short pants'd
school uniforms. The film quickly descends below the surface to show
the village as a cauldron of incestuous flirtations, violent
retaliation and explosive "family secrets."  The plot follows an arc of
forbidden loves and passions, leading to retribution on a biblical
scale. What may appear to the modern audience as "cheap" special
effects are actually loving recreations of how ghosts and visions were
portrayed in silent and early talking German films. Many of the images
are unforgettable, like the "trolley" cars pulled by oxen, or the mine
workers wearing crowns of flickering candles. Some closeups resemble
early Garbo or Dietrich films of the 30's.</P>
<P>     One of the most fascinating  and bizarre films you could see this
year, watch for it at your local Art/Repertory house. It demands
multiple viewings. Take a friend; this is definitely a film you'll want
to dissect over several capuccinos. Don't expect this film to come out
on video, considering its limited screenings.</P>
