<PRE>"Reindeer Games" - HoHoHum
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>Since this film's setting takes place during the
season of giving, I feel compelled to give at least
one compliment. I like Ben Affleck, who plays an
amiable anti-hero that gets himself caught up in a
case of mistaken identity.  But would I be a scrooge
for saying that the film itself has the unenviable
feeling of being caught under the mistletoe with the
dogfaced Gary Senise?  </P>
<P>"Reindeer Games" is a film that has the intention of
being a not-so-ordinary action film.  It tries to be
hip.  Case in point: the beginning scene starts off
with the camera showing several dead men in Santa
suits and then in the next scene displays the words
"Six Days Ago," bringing us back to when the story
begins.  It tries to add some spice to its characters.
 Case in point: a henchman philosophizes about the
economic advantage of adding another Christmas holiday
to bolster retail sales (not a good idea if it means
more movies like this).  It also tries to be
unpredictable.  Case in point: there are plot twists
galore.</P>
<P>But "Reindeer Games" is only sophisticated enough to
gather these elements together.  There they are, just
sitting there.  And like oil and water, they never
seem to be able to mix.  What a shame, because in the
hands of a more talented group, this could have been a
really fun movie.  </P>
<P>Ben Affleck plays Rudy, a small-time car thief who is
about to be released from jail.  The first thing that
he wants to do with his freedom is to get a cup of Hot
Chocolate and a slice of Pecan Pie.  His cellmate,
Nick (James Frain) will also be released on the same
day.  Over the last few months, Nick has been
receiving love letters from a mysterious woman named
Ashley (Charlize Theron).  Nick has never met this
woman.  She's a pen pal who learned of Nick through
one of those prison magazine personals.  Nick's wall
is plastered with pictures of Ashley, who is quite
adorable.  And he reads her letters to Rudy, who is
moved by her prose.  Nick, unfortunately, falls victim
in a prison fight and when Rudy is released and sees
her waiting outside, Rudy assumes Nick's place. 
"Don't do it, Rudy," he says to himself.  But how much
of a conscience does a thief really have?</P>
<P>Although things seem blissful at first, she is a woman
who can only draw you into trouble.  Ashley is
connected with a group of gun-running truckers.  Led
by the sinister-looking Gabriel, (perpetually scowling
Gary Senise), he has read Nick's letters and knows
that he was a security guard of an Indian-run casino
and that he is familiar with their safeguards.  Of
course, Affleck-as-Nick couldn't tell you where the
bathrooms are, but to avoid being killed, he goes
along with the charade as best as he can.  Ashley
weeps, "I've finally found a boy that I'm crazy about,
and my brother wants him worse than me."  I'm weeping
too because despite Affleck's affability and
potentially interesting material, "Reindeer Games"
doesn't amount to much more than a conventional action
film.  Been there, done that, seen it all.</P>
<P>Though I shouldn't do this, I think about all of the
opportunities squandered.  One of the main points of
the movie is that Affleck-as-Nick has no clue about
security at a casino.  Can you imagine him bumbling
his way around trying to case the place out without
arousing the suspicion?  We also learn that none of
the truckers have ever committed robbery before.  Here
is a golden comedic opportunity that may take place of
the senseless yet inevitable bloodbath at the film's
conclusion.  You may remember that in my review of the
"Whole Nine Yards," I had said that this gangster film
is a comedy that would have been better off as a
drama.  "Reindeer Games" is just the opposite.  It
tries to be a hip action film, but would probably be
better off as a psuedo-comedy.  Thank goodness this
film wasn't released before the Christmas season. 
Otherwise, it would have certainly dampened my holiday
spirits.  </P>
