<P>APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com
 Forget The Godfather.  The sheer brilliance of Francis Ford Coppola
lies in the images and words of his real masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. 
Twenty-two years ago, Coppola ventured into the jungles of the
Philippines to shoot an adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,
set against the turmoil and fury of the Vietnam War.  Coppola assembled
an impressive cast of actors -- 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne, Robert
Duvall, Martin Sheen (replacing Harvey Keitel), Dennis Hopper, Frederic
Forrest, and the great Marlon Brando -- and set out to shoot a war
epic.  By the end, Coppola had lost 100 pounds, principal photography
ran for 16 weeks, Martin Sheen had a heart attack, Brando demanded all
of his shots be done in shadow, and Coppola had invested millions of his
own money to keep the production going, all while threatening suicide
numerous times.  After all the pain, Apocalypse Now was finally
revealed, exposing itself as one of the most amazing pieces of celluloid
ever produced, capturing not only the ugliness and ridiculousness of
Vietnam, but exposing the dark heart of man as well.</P>
<P>The end result: 8 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture) and
2 wins for Cinematography and Score.  Apocalypse Now additionally
cemented Coppola's place as an A-plus-list film director, giving him
free rein for the next 20 years to make crap like Captain Eo and Jack,
junk which no one in Hollywood would dare criticize.</P>
<P>Like Cameron (with The Abyss) and Lucas (with Star Wars), Coppola
recently decided to take another whack at Apocalypse Now, dubbing this
new director's cut Apocalypse Now Redux.  At a running time of over 3
hours and 15 minutes, Redux demands even more of your attention (the
original runs 2:33) and still it never lets you up for a breath of
reality. 
Apocalypse Now follows the story of a burnt out Army captain named
Willard (Sheen), who has been given the task of hunting down and
"exterminating... with extreme prejudice" a renegade Green Beret colonel
named Kurtz (Brando).  Kurtz has apparently gone insane, establishing
himself as a God for a Cambodian jungle tribe.  Willard travels upriver
on a Navy PBR with four grunts: Chef (Frederic Forrest), Chief (Albert
Hall), Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne), and Lance (Sam Bottoms, who was
on speed and LSD for most of the film's production).  Along the way,
Willard and his crew encounter the mighty Captain Kilgore (Robert
Duvall), pass the time waterskiing and shooting locals, and spend a
strange dinner conversing with French colonists still fighting the Viet
Cong.  In the end, Dante's Inferno is reached when the boat finds a
coked-up photographer (played by Dennis Hopper) and Colonel Kurtz
himself.</P>
<P>Apocalypse Now is not a film but a sensory overload for the insane.  The
Redux version adds over 40 minutes of original footage (not digitally
enhanced crap) which further details and defines the horrors encountered
by Willard on his travel up the river to find Kurtz.  Four main scenes
are restored: a scene where Willard and his crew encounter the Playboy
Playmates stranded upriver, the bizarre French Plantation dinner scene
mentioned above, a key scene between Kurtz and Willard which further
explores Kurtz's psyche, and additional bits on the boat near the
beginning of the journey, better establishing the camaraderie onboard.</P>
<P>Does Apocalypse Now need a new, longer cut?  No.  Is the original
inexplicably improved with one?  Somehow, yes.  Highly recommended.</P>
