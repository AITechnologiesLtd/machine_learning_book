<PRE>                              OF MICE AND MEN
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     OF MICE AND MEN is a film directed by Gary Sinese, from a
screenplay by Horton Foote, based on the novel by John Steinbeck.  It
stars Gary Sinese, John Malkovich, Sherilyn Fenn, Ray Walston, Casey
Siemaszko, and Joe Morton.  Rated PG-13, due to mature themes, brief
violence.</P>
<P>     OF MICE AND MEN was first adapted to the big screen in 1939 in a
film directed by Lewis Milestone and starring Burgess Meredith and Lon
Chaney, Jr., and music by Aaron Copeland, a mere two years after the
novel's publication.  The story was adapted twice for TV (once with
Robert Blake and Randy Quaid, once with George Segal and Nicol
Williamson); it was also made into a opera that was produced twice by
Seattle Opera.  The script for this newest version was written by Horton
Foote (THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL), who downplays the novel's political
subtext, a call for a humane socialism where people take care of one
another.  Instead, Foote's version is content to redefine the human
condition on the individual level only.  This new version does succeed
in capturing Steinbeck's special feeling for the land.  The film was
stunningly photographed in California's Santa Ynez valley, a rolling
land of golden grass and live oaks.</P>
<P>     This film marks the introduction of director-star Gary Sinese as
one of the  future lights of Hollywood.  Sinese founded the Steppenwolf
Theatre in Chicago in the Seventies.  It was there that he and John
Malkovich first played George and Lennie in 1980.  As a director Sinese
shows a spare, delicate style.  As George, the smaller, smarter migrant
worker who has fallen reluctantly into the role of Lennie's protector,
Sinese is especially sympathetic and effective.</P>
<P>     As Lennie, the child-like giant, John Malkovich presents a more
problematic performance.  Malkovich is a star, not a character actor.
We are watching a star do a star turn when we watch Malkovich parade his
formidable and showy arsenal of shtick, the hands floating, bouncing,
the mouth in search for a shape, the stutters, shambling walk.  These
things might have worked brilliantly on stage, but on the big screen
they serve only to draw attention to the actor, not the character.</P>
<P>     On the other end of the end of the scale is the wonderful Ray
Walston as Candy, the withered old hand whose old dog foreshadows the
eventual culmination of the story.  Walston, perhaps best known to many
as Uncle Martin in that silly old TV series "My Favorite Martian", and
who had a brilliant career in musical comedy in the Forties and Fifties
(SOUTH PACIFIC, DAMN YANKEES), registers a heartbreaking performance as
the old man who says, "I wish someone would shoot me when I'm of no use
anymore.  But they won't, they'll just send me away."</P>
<P>     Among the other noteworthy performances are those of Casey
Siemaszko as the brutish Curly, Sherilyn Fenn, his unnamed wife, and Joe
Morton as Crooks, the broken stable hand.  Fenn in particular presents a
new take on her character.  The wife in this version is far more
dangerous and predatory than in Steinbeck's novel.  Initially acting
quite sluttish, she shows us eventually to be naive, lonely, and trapped
in an abusive marriage; she acts as a voice for a feminist consciousness
that probably never occurred to Steinbeck.  Likewise, the wonderful Joe
Morton (BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) begins as the brutally, cruelly
angry Black man, eventually shows his pain and loneliness.  Both of
these unhappy people are brought out of their shells in contact with
Lennie, the confessor who understands almost nothing they tell him, so
they can tell him anything.</P>
<P>     I recommend OF MICE AND MEN without reservation even at full price.
It is visually beautiful.  It is thematically intelligent and important.
It is sensitive to its source and the debut of a great new movie talent.
Really, you must go.</P>
