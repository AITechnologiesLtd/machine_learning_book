<P>PAYBACK *½ (out of four) 
-a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:payback@filmfreakcentral.net">payback@filmfreakcentral.net</A> )</P>
<P>(Come with me to the casbah--Film Freak Central:
<A HREF="http://filmfreakcentral.net">http://filmfreakcentral.net</A> )</P>
<P>starring Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, Kris Kristofferson
screenplay by Brian Helgeland and Terry Hayes, based on the novel "The
Hunter" by Richard Stark
directed by Brian Helgeland</P>
<P>Ladies and gentlemen, Payback is the most expensive episode of "The
Equalizer" I've ever seen. </P>
<P>Gibson plays Porter, a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife
(Deborah Kara Unger, in an all-too-brief cameo) and partner (Henry)
after a successful heist. As a morgue attendant sets about removing
the bullets from Porter's back, Porter miraculously springs back to
life. He makes it his mission, as a walking dead man without a
conscience, to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his
share of the loot. (In a running gag, Porter demands $70 000, but
everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000
haul.) In his travels (or travails), Porter encounters several other
one-named villainous cretins like Fairfax (James Coburn as a
white-haired, millionaire thief) and Carter (Kristofferson, as a
brown-haired, millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory
"operation"). </P>
<P>Helgeland's film (which was recut by Mel the Producer) is devoid of an
imperative dime store charm. The novelty of seeing a big movie star
mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly: a) because the
bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs, and b) because
Mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's The Terminator
stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after
the initial sadistic thrill is gone. Payback should have been called
Playback: it's a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence. (Mel: "I
want my money." Anonymous Villain: "No." Mel shoots gun. Anonymous
villain dies. Mel meets up with his hooker friend (Bello). Second
verse, same as the first.) It's not Porter's single-mindedness that
robs the film of snap, crackle, and pop; as a character who has
already "died" once, he has nothing to lose and so much to gain. The
movie lacks danger. The only thing Porter is in jeopardy of is putting
the audience to sleep.</P>
<P>Payback has a gritty, metallic look to it that also becomes
monotonous; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of
those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of England every couple
of months. (Director of photography Ericson Core should have been
fired early on for lighting Bello, so va-va-va-voom in Permanant
Midnight, to look like a potato in a Gregg Allman wig.) </P>
<P>To analyze such mediocrity is to grant Payback far more attention than
it deserves. Perhaps only someone as experienced with
antagonists-as-protagonists as Tarantino-look what he did with the
similar hero-less botched-robbery tale Reservoir Dogs-could have
pulled off this material (a loose remake of John Boorman's Point
Blank). The movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction
(all women are femme fatales; even the cops are in on it, etc.) and
crosses them with the conventions of cheesy TV crime melodramas (death
is never in the cards for the main character, etc.) but transcends
neither. </P>
