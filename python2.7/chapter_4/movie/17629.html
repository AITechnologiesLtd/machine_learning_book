<P>Starring Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Larisa Oleynik. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>The teen comedy genre has been a wildly successful one these past few years,
as we've seen all kinds of rip-offs, abominations and even a few straining
originals. It's even spawned a few updates of Shakespeare and Dickens, the
weirdest of which was Leonardo DiCaprio's love-it-or-hate-it 1996 radical
version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Yes, we've gotten some
weird, weird films, some hopelessly raunchy, others openly profound. 10
Things I Hate About You is somewhere in between. Very loosely based on (maybe
even just inspired by) William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew,
one thing that 10 Things has going for it is a teriffic ensemble cast of
teens. Larisa Oleynik (of Nickelodeon fame) is Bianca Stratford, a gorgeous
and insanely popular sophomore that has one monkey on her back: her dad will
not let her date... until her sister, Kat Stratford does. The problem is that
Kat is rather anti-social, to put it mildly, and getting her to date is
almost as inconceivable to her as getting her dad to loosen up (fairly
inconceivable, in case you do not get my drift).</P>
<P>That also presents a problem for newcomer Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who
has a major crush on Bianca. Fortunately for him he has a quick-thinking pal
who gets Joey, the school hunk with a crush for Bianca, to pay another guy to
date Kat. The conflict, then is who will get the girl, Joey (the jerk) or
Cameron (the nice guy).</P>
<P>10 Things has little more in common with The Taming of The Shrew than my
mother does with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but it doesn't really make much
difference. This is one of the more energetic teen films that I've watched
lately; not as hypnotically laid back as Varsity Blues or as uneven as She's
All That. That almost always works to the movie's advantage; because lame
scenes are made nifty by the movie's endless energy. Something like a guy
serenading a girl who is angry at him through the PA system on the soccer
field would be ridiculously schmaltzy in any other movie, but when said guy
starts running around spanking policemen who are trying to apprehend him the
whole scene takes on an appealing quality.</P>
<P>The performances in 10 Things are likewise stellar. Although Gordon-Levitt is
moderately annoying in a role it's difficult not to be annoying in, other
young actors and actresses triumph. Julia Stiles is achingly sincere as Kat
Stratford, with a kind of unapproachable vulnerability about her. Andrew
Keagan is effectively repulsive as the conceited school hunk used as a pawn
by Cameron and his friends. But the highlight of the bunch is the beautiful,
funny, charming Larisa Oleynik. Previously seen on the Nickelodeon tv show
The Secret World of Alex Mack, this actress is clearly likeable enough to
have a great future in Hollywood.</P>
<P>10 Things I Hate About You is certainly not without its flaws. We have the
usual "I was a bet?/You were payed to like me?" speech which is like a rubber
stamp in these teen movies. Another rubber stamp is the fact that the film
ends with a prom. The prom is a perfect symbol of teenage angst when utilized
correctly (remember Carrie?) but nowadays we see proms that end with disaster
so often (even in the recent Never Been Kissed which I happened to like) that
it is no longer effective at projecting teenage anger at the world.</P>
<P>Still, those relatively minor complaints are not nearly enough to discredit
this teriffic little movie, which is entertaining despite all of its flaws.
It is nothing unique to be sure, but it is a nice diversion if one has a
rainy evening with nothing to do on one's hands.</P>
