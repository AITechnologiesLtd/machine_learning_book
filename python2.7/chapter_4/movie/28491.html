<PRE>"The Fast and the Furious"</PRE>
<P>Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) owns the streets of L.A. During the day he
puts together high-performance racing cars. At night, he pilots his own
little pocket rocket and wins upwards to $10,000 if someone has the nerve
to race him. A young loner, Brian (Paul Walker), wants to hook up with the
outlaw motor maestro. Dom is suspicious, until a confrontation with a
ruthless gang leader, Johnny Tran (Rick Yune), changes his mind. But,
enough about plot. It's about racing in Rob Cohen's "The Fast and the
Furious."</P>
<P>Over the past year, we've had a couple of auto-based, adrenalin rush pics
with "Gone in 60 Seconds" and "Driven." Neither film had much in common and
neither was very good, but they both carried the central theme of a need
for speed. Helmer Cohen takes the hunger to drive fast to the streets with
his pop-culture look into that microcosm of Americana, Los Angeles.</P>
<P>The desolate nighttime streets of sections of L.A. become tribal territory
for the adrenalin junkies whose pride is in their hopped up imports. They
gather every night, monitoring the whereabouts of the police, and risk
their pink slips against their ability to drive fast. Dom is the leader of
this tribe, along with his team, and he rules the outlaw races. But there
is danger lurking on the horizon for those involved in a major hijack ring
and members of the clan of night drivers may well be involved.</P>
<P>Brian is a loner who comes into the scene with a desire to impress Dom and
his posse with his guts and ability. But, the young man has a hidden agenda
- he's an undercover cop and he suspects that the hijackers may be hidden
among the tribe. When he and Dom have a run-in with Johnny Tran's team, a
bunch of gun toting, motorcycle driving hotheads, it looks like these are
the bad guys the cop is searching for. Brian and his bosses jump the gun
and raid Johnny's operation, much to their eventual embarrassment.</P>
<P>At about this point, things start to sort themselves out as the real story,
one of honor and loyalty, kicks in. This is also where the film gets very
derivative of such action flicks as "Speed" and "Point Break" - is it
significant that Keanu Reeves starred in both of those films? But, derived
does not mean bad and "The Fast and the Furious" delivers its action bits
in tense portions. The racing that dominated the first half of the film
takes a back seat, so to speak, to the meat of the story and the
relationship between Brian and Dominic and his team.</P>
<P>"The Fast and the Furious" benefits from the charismatic presence of Vin
Diesel. The actor was one reason "Boiler Room" worked and he cuts a good
figure here. Diesel is so likable, though, that it is hard to get angry
with him for being a bad guy, too. Paul Walker is OK as the undercover cop,
but any good-looking actor could have filled the role. The folks making up
Dom's team - Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, Johnny
Strong and Matt Shulze - are all supportive, if a little bland. A love
interest between Diesel and Rodriguez simply does not work - not their
fault. Chad Lindberg, as Dom's brilliant, but dyslexic, mechanic, Jesse
gets to play up the troubled martyr role well enough. Don't look for Oscars
here though.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist and David Ayer is
action packed and has some slickly executed race scenes. The cars, ranging
from souped up Toyotas to NOS (nitrous oxide) boosted Volkswagen Jettas,
are what the teens and twenties are going to see, and we get some good,
though not great, racing.</P>
<P>The F/X are a combo of live action and computer-generated images and look
very good. You won't have tires and fenders flying off the screen at you, a
la "Driven," which is a very good thing. The CGI stuff is so convincingly
done the line between computer-generated action and live is agreeably
blurred and works well. The action-packed hijack, which is the showcase for
the flick, is straight out of "Speed," but is so tightly wound it keeps
your attention with slick car stunts and crash bang action.</P>
<P>"The Fast and the Furious" is B-movie entertainment that is ideal for the
drive-in on a warm summer's night - if you can find a drive-in still alive
and kicking. The tweenies will love it. In my town, the kids are planning
to meet, with their hot cars, and head to the theater en masse on the
opening weekend. Their exuberance will be well met. I give it a B-.</P>
