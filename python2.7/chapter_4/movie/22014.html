<P>"The Iron Giant" is a great achievement in feature length animation. It is one
of the few this decade to simultaneously teach a valuable lesson, entertain all
ages, and accurately reenter an era of America's regretful past. The best part
about this film is that it actually captures a number of distinct emotions and
characters of our recent past half a century ago. Through the reaction to the
entrance of this foreign giant, paranoia and trust battle each other out and
determine the fate of the situation. This battle creates an intense,
depressing, and humorous outcome. The stable balance of these three factors
makes "The Iron Giant" so special. It contradicts the spreading trend of just
using animation to create wacky and unimaginable characters. The characters
most definitely have existed in this time of American history and "The Iron
Giant" uses this reality to create real emotions and understandable decisions
from both perspectives. The film is also an argument that the government is
mainly to blame for the Cold War. By making the army and a government agent the
villains, the film shows that America is fighting America. One part of this
country did not blow situations out of proportion and examined them before
making decisions. Another part of this country decided before they examined
that anything foreign or new was a threat to the country. A number of times the
film tells the giant (and the audience) to choose who they are for themselves
without outside interference. "The Iron Giant" mainly is an argument against
the use of violence to solve issues. It asks the question of who to follow in a
time of crisis, yourself or the mass majority (in this case the government and
army). </P>
<P>These messages are given within the plot which is mostly formulaic except for
its fantastic, heart pounding ending. This is not to say that formulaic is bad.
"The Iron Giant" can be easily compared to "E.T." and equals it in its process
of story telling and lesson teaching. The story takes place in a small town in
Maine during 1957, a time when nuclear attacks were feared and B-horror movies
thrived. A number of spoofs involving the culture of the time are cleverly
added into the script which should entertain adults who grew up during that
time period. A young boy, Hogarth Hughes, (Eli Marienthal in a wonderful vocal
performance) discovers an iron giant (Vin Diesel) near his town and develops a
secret friendship with it. Hogarth teaches the giant how to say basic words, he
teaches him that killing is bad and death should be natural, and he teaches him
to behave like superman protecting the innocent citizens from danger. However,
this relationship is endangered when the army sets out to destroy it no matter
who gets in the way. Christopher McDonald, who always seems to play the bad guy
nowadays, voices Kent Mansley, the man determined to bring the robot down at
all costs by calling in the army once he receives evidence.  </P>
<P>This film proves that animated feature length films can definitely appear on a
film critic's top ten list of movies of the year. Its spectacular ending wraps
together a large amount of the Cold War. The paranoia, the control of the
government, and the fear of foreigners entering the home front. The animation
in the film also deserves credit for its great story telling. Brad Bird
masterfully uses close ups and long shots in a number of scenes. He focuses on
a close up, then slowly blurs it out and closes in on an image farther away.
This style of drawing is very effective because it makes the scenery more real
and as a result makes the content more believable. "The Iron Giant" is the best
animated film since "The Lion King" and it deserves even more credit because it
does not have the comfortable cushion of Disney marketing and advertising. A
wonderful film only held back by some hackneyed lines and scenes. The positives
greatly outweigh the negatives in every category. </P>
