<P>   Sure, America has no kings or queens, but social classes
are alive and well.  The conflicts between the circles provide
abundant material for both drama and comedy: "Good Will
Hunting," Gus Van Sant's surprisingly conventional
psychological piece, supplies both.  Despite its schematic
layout and predictable outcome, the ensemble acting is of
such a high level--particularly that of Robin Williams, Matt
Damon and Stellan Skarsgard--that the impact on his
audience is spellbinding.  "Good Will Hunting," whose title is
evoked from its main character and its theme alike, treats a
subject exploited by Robert Redford in "Ordinary People,"
doing so with explosively funny one-liners and effectively
poignant moments.  </P>
<P>   A commonly-held view is that geniuses just cannot fit
in...their ability to see what few others can casts them into
nether regions of research and academe where they toil
away, intellectually satisfied but emotionally starved. The title
figure of Van Sant's latest feature does not quite correspond
to this stereotype. He is certainly not challenged intellectually
since he has no discovered a problem he cannot easily solve,
nor does he strive to find a career worthy of his gifts. 
Emotionally, he erects walls, refusing to let anyone in for fear
of finding himself less than perfect and invulnerable.  The task
of the two adults who change his life and the peers who love
him, of course, is to shatter this wall, to reach this twenty-
year-old prodigy, and send him off to a future which will not
necessarily be a rose garden but which opens him up to
those aspects of life he dare not confront.  In "Good Will
Hunting" Van Sant, fully realizing a wise-guy screenplay
written by two of his young performers, steers clear of oddball
themes he evoked in "To Die For" and "My Own Private
Idaho" and "Drugstore Cowboy," compensating by a drama
rich in sharp dialogue and exceptionally strong performances.</P>
<P>   The story deals with Will (Matt Damon), a tough orphan
brought up in the South Bronx, who has been abused by his
drunken stepfather and thereby never exposed to the
possibility of a higher education.  An avid reader with a
photographic mind, however, he has far more book
knowledge in math, history, politics, art and literature than any
of the students he encounters at Harvard and MIT, two of the
country's premier universities.  When he is not polishing the
hallways of MIT at a job he was assigned by a parole officer
(he is imprisoned for assaulting a policeman), he is either
solving mathematical problems anonymously or hanging out in
pubs with his rugged pals, especially Chuckie (Ben Affleck). 
When an award-winning math professor, Lambeau (Stellan
Skarsgard) discovers the youth's ability to solve math
problems that even he cannot work out, he gets the young
man out of jail and puts him in the hands of psychology
professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) at a small,
obviously mediocre community college.  Though other
analysts have been unable to reach Will, Sean gets through,
presumably because he is himself damaged goods--having
failed to make use of his abilities to achieve the honors
received by his former classmate, Lambeau, and unable to
get over the painful death of his wife.  What's more, Sean
seems smothered by an envy of his more successful
classmate who teaches at the country's most prestigous
technical college.</P>
<P>   Two monologues in the film are nothing short of dazzling:
one, delivered by Sean while he and his patient are sitting
around a pond, is built on the psychologist's refusal to see the
boy's life as exceptional.  The lad, according to Sean, will
quote a Shakespearean sonnet but has probably never loved,
can discuss the politics of war but has never held the head of
a wounded friend on the battlefield, can discuss world affairs
but has never in his life left Boston.  The other is a leftist
lecture which Will lays on to some officials in the National
Security Administration, an organization seven times the size
of the CIA, which is trying to recruit him to break codes.  Will
sees the job as one which will help the organization exploit
people in other lands who "make fifteen cents a day," and
which will result in American bombardment over foreign
territories to insure the even flow of oil to the U.S.</P>
<P>   Much of this edgy drama is so riveting that it is actually a
shame that a romantic theme has been jackknifed into the
story, one which halts the tale's momentum and helps provide
for an all-too-neat conclusion.  The courtship involved Will
with a rich Harvard senior, Skylar (Minnie Driver), who is
bound for medical school and has fallen in love with this
genius who is of a vastly different social class.  </P>
<P>  Filmed largely on location in Boston, the movie will do
wonder for the budding career of Matt Damon, who succeeds
admirably in maintaining a New England accept throughout
and who, by sharing in the writing of the script, proves to be a
man of great talent not unlike the character he plays.  His
chemistry with Robin Williams is visceral: Van Sant builds up
the relationship in steps, taking Will Hunting from a hopelessly
resistant analysand who in one session says not a word to a
kid who breaks down in tears by his final session. 
Photographer Jean Yves Escoffier does wonder with the
working-class, South Boston neighborhood, filming a rowdy
fight with alarming realism and subtly providing a few key
flashbacks to underscore the backgrounds of Will and Sean.
