<P>Yes, Virginia, there are differences among social classes. More about 
this later. For now, the sad news that Random Hearts is a 
disappointment.</P>
<P>It starts with the title which is sappy, terribly old-fashioned, like 
one of those paperback romances of yore and of now. Everyone who has 
even the minimum of information about movies knows already the 
subject.</P>
<P>He is Sergeant "Dutch," of the Internal Affairs division of the 
Washington, D.C. police. He has a young, pretty wife, Peyton, a 
fashion consultant at Saks Fifth Avenue. No children. She is Kay 
Chandler, a Congresswoman for New Hampshire and the wife of lawyer 
Cullen. They have a 15-year old daughter, Jessica (well played).</P>
<P>The two families don't know each other, but Peyton and Cullen have 
been having an affair. Peyton tells Dutch that she's flying to Miami 
for a  Saks catalogue photo-shoot. Cullen pretends he's going to New 
York on business. In fact the two get on a plane to Miami to have 
some fun in the sun, and out of it too. The plane crashes shortly 
after take-off. The couple is among the many dead.</P>
<P>It takes time and searches for Dutch to become aware of the 
infidelity and death of his wife. Kay finds out in simpler ways. 
Dutch and Kay meet some 45 minutes into the movie. They fall in love.</P>
<P>Before Dutch and Kay meet the film is interesting in events 
(including  airline's after-crash procedures) and in characters. It 
is elaborate, with impressive big- budget cinematography, and often 
functional editing: when Dutch makes an urgent phone call, he dials 
only the first two digits before we cut to the call proper. Good 
economy of means, especially since phones and answering machines play 
a major role. By far the most affecting sections come as 
shell-shocked Dutch pieces together bit by bit  the awful truth of 
his wife's affair. .</P>
<P>But after this go-go-go tempo, the elaborate shifts to laborious, the 
story slows down while its lining of semi-irrelevancies increases. In 
the hallowed tradition of using more than one narrative paths (which 
can be good, but also bad when using is not followed by fusing) the 
plot is murkily padded by Dutch going after some drug-dealers and 
their corrupt police associates. Too much cliché cop-stuff.</P>
<P>In the long second part, the best thing  is a terrific scene at a 
Miami place where couples dancing the tango generate infinitely more 
eroticism than the main story</P>
<P>Why make the main characters a policeman and a Congresswoman running 
for re-election? Because of the TV and movie "glamor" of gun-action 
and politics, and of course sex. Forgotten, as in too many gimmicky 
"love" stories, is the lesson of  Brief Encounter (UK, 1945), that 
paragon of classically simple sentimental tales: two ordinary people 
in ordinary circumstances can move you immensely. Period.</P>
<P>The process of bringing the protagonists "really" together, travels 
through corpses, posh hotels and restaurants and is fairly 
convoluted. It reaches an unconvincing peak after the Dutch and Kay, 
back from their separate (discrete but not discreet) visits to 
confirm to themselves, needlessly and masochistically, the reality, 
the scene and the betrayals of their spouses. They return to D.C. on 
the same plane. At the Washington parking-lot, in Kay's car, there is 
(OUCH!!!) sudden,  startling, logic-defying wild kissing and groping.</P>
<P>The affair that follows, complete with bucolic settings, soupy 
dialogue, some revelations, and both parties' obsessive need to know 
more about their dead spouses, shows only one thing: that the movie 
doesn't know what to do with itself. Well, what do you expect from a 
work which started its planning fifteen years ago with a novel, and 
whose script and "adaptation" have different authors.</P>
<P>Now, Virginia, back to social differences. The main actors are nicely 
matched physically. They are mature, Ford, 57, Scott Thomas, 39, yet 
visually give no impression of a June-November couple. But no matter 
how youthful and vigorous Ford, the likelihood of the pairing is 
strained. She is the patrician daughter of a millionaire who was 
(is?) a political force. And a New England Republican.</P>
<P>The policeman, named  "Dutch" Van Den Broeck -- perhaps to remind 
subliminally a few viewers of aristocratic Dutch-American families -- 
is a commoner who drinks beer from the bottle.  Perhaps a Democrat, 
since, in a good touch, he sports an earring that may denote 
non-conservatism.</P>
<P>This hybrid movie gets increasingly uninvolving. It seems predicated 
on a 100% belief in monogamy. What hypocrisy, when showbiz people are 
notoriously polygamous, megagamous or even gigagamous.</P>
<P>The most affecting sections come in the first part, with 
shell-shocked Dutch learning bit by bit of his wife's affair. There 
is also excellent photography, including a terrific scene at a Miami 
place where couples dancing the tango generate infinitely more 
eroticism than the main story.</P>
<P>Director Sydney Pollack plays  very well Kay's politically savvy 
spinmeister. Pollack is no mean film-maker. He does what he can here 
but has an overall clumsy script to contend with.</P>
