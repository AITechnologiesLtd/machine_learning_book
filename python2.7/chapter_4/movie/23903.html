<PRE>Mission to Mars (2000) 112m</PRE>
<P>I'm surprised at the hostile reaction that Brian De Palma's first foray into 
Sci-Fi has received from some critics.  While purposefully avoiding all 
prior knowledge of the film's content I was still aware of the scathing tone 
of many of its reviews.  Or perhaps it's just that those who would shout 
things down have the louder voices, relegating any more favorable comment to 
the sidelines.</P>
<P>Undeniably, MISSION TO MARS is patchy, but that's nothing new.  De Palma's 
track record is notorious for this kind of spasmodic final product, his most 
unified film THE UNTOUCHABLES being an exception.  At the other end of the 
scale, THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES has been his biggest flop, but even then 
it's still okay as a film: it's only when compared to Tom Wolfe's terrific 
book that it fails.  It's these comparative elements that may have irked 
many a reviewer of MISSION TO MARS.  The most obvious homage/ripoff (take 
your pick) is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and De Palma's beautiful visuals (of 
artificial-gravity; the seemingly effortless, assured camerawork in the 
spacecraft; the figures in Martian orbit) evoke a sense of wonder and easily 
hold their own against that classic.  Conceptwise, it's another matter.  
Science Fiction has been all but milked dry (the last new big thing was 
William Gibson's notions of cyberspace), and when MISSION TO MARS makes it 
clear that it's heading towards a revelatory punchline it can only mean 
trouble.  There's very little left that's new, and I can see film's payoff 
causing SF buffs to roll their eyes and say `they did this in (insert name 
of book/film/TWILIGHT ZONE episode) already!'.</P>
<P>That leaves us with structure, and once again De Palma has shown that he is 
a craftsman of bravura set-pieces.  It's also reminded us that a lot of the 
stuff between those set-pieces doesn't hold together so well, and in MISSION 
TO MARS you can start picking at exact moments where the seams start to 
show.  On the negative side, the opening earthbound scenes appear to have 
been written from ‘The Screenwriter's Guide to Expository Dialogue' (it's a 
made-up title; don't look for it);  the image of the alien at the end is 
embarrassingly twee; De Palma doesn't really know how to use music 
effectively in emotional/dramatic scenes – he seems to have used Ennio 
Morricone's score in much the same way that he overstated his Pino Donaggio 
scores to kitschy effect in his early thrillers; and the storyline is cut 
into two uneven halves, the first being realistic, the second being 
fantastic.</P>
<P>I don't necessarily regard this last criticism as a failing point; in fact I 
enjoy scripts that aren't straitjacketed into ‘arcs' or formulas.  Also – 
and in spite of those weak opening scenes – the tone of this film is unlike 
any other De Palma has made.  For once he presents his characters as if they 
were more than scripted pawns in a screenplay; as astronauts, Tim Robbins, 
Connie Nielsen, Gary Sinese, and Jerry O'Connell have an easy, natural bond. 
  And this time, when someone dies in a De Palma film, it resonates.  For my 
money, the pluses in MISSION TO MARS easily outweigh the minuses.  It looks 
fabulous on a big screen, plays out some great sequences, and has a genial 
mix of science and fiction.  Granted, there are several little stupid 
moments scattered throughout, but this at least may provide some 
post-screening entertainment if you see it with a group of friends (my vote 
for The Stupidest Bit is that dumb scene where the rescue team pauses to 
unearth the flag and replant it…personally my priority upon reaching the 
objective of a six-month mission would have been to get inside the damned 
ship first).</P>
<P>It comes back to what I've always advocated - that the less you know about a 
film beforehand the better.  My guess is that the reviewers who have carped 
most about De Palma's film will be those who either felt he wasn't equipped 
to work in the genre in the first place, or those who were led to expect an 
entirely different experience.  Another 2001?  Not likely; there will hardly 
be another of those in our lifetime.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS?  No, that was 
pointedly one director's personal vision. APOLLO 13?  No, that was fact, and 
this is fiction.  MISSION TO MARS is….well, it's just MISSION TO MARS and 
that's all there is to it.  In the meantime, and until studios realize that 
hype is the worst enemy a movie can have, you would be best to take a leaf 
out of Alexander Pope's book and maintain a little ignorance before you buy 
your tickets.  Or to put it another way: the best way to watch a film is in 
the dark.</P>
<P>Postscript: It's reassuring to know that in the year 2020 the Dr Pepper logo 
will still remain the same.</P>
