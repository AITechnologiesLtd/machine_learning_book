AMISTAD
A Film by Steven Spielberg
Starring: Djimon Hounsou, Anthony Hopkins, Morgan Freeman, Matthew 
McConaughey, and Stellan Skaarsgard</PRE>
<P>    What is freedom? How does one determine who is free? In 1839, those 
questions were more difficult to answer then they are now. Yet, the 
mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current 
situations.</P>
<P>That is, in essence, what Steven Spielberg's gripping drama 
"Amistad" is about. Through its various dramas, Spielberg presents a 
case about a group of Africans, who, after being seized from their home, 
were forced onto a ship and sent to the United States aboard "La 
Amistad". On their way there, the slaves, led by Cinque (Djimon 
Hounsou), rebelled, killing off part of the crew. However, the ship was 
still directed towards the United States, where the Africans were 
brought to trial under murder.</P>
<P>In the court, various factions claim ownership of the slaves, and 
therefore try to seize them away. The United States government, led by 
President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), and Secretary of State 
Secretary Forsyth (David Paymer), try to ship the Africans to Spain, 
where an 11 year old Isabella II (Anna Paquin) wants them back. The two 
Spaniards who own "La Amistad" want the slaves for themselves. The 
American ship that found the slaves also wants them. In the midst of 
this are two abolitionists (Stellan Skaarsgard and Morgan Freeman), who 
want the slaves to be free. They enlist the help of lawyer Matthew 
McConaughey, who tries to free them. Through various legal proceedings, 
the case appears before the Supreme Court, where it is argued by 
ex-President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).</P>
<P>The film itself is a visual wonder. Spielberg favorite Janusz 
Kaminski sets the film in a dark, somber mood when appropriate, and a 
visual setting when appropriate as well. At times, the film is very 
slow, and very methodical. However, Spielberg is not at his finest here, 
because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag. The film is, in 
essence, a courtroom drama, one whose events are oversimplified.  The 
characterization is also weak, displaying weaknesses in building up 
characters such as the lawyer Baldwin (McConaughey), and especially 
Morgan Freeman's abolitionist.</P>
<P>But Spielberg's finest work in the film, the opening scene, a scene 
of Cinque's family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America, is 
altogether stunning. It is this emotional force that carries the film. 
McConaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the Africans, Hopkins is 
sensational as the old Adams, Freeman is outstanding when used 
(Spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents), and the rest of the 
cast is stellar. The movie, however, belongs to Hounsou. His emotional 
intensity is brilliant. Spielberg manages to make even the slowest 
scenes sparkle with focus on Hounsou, and the film's extraordinary power 
is simply captivating. The film is flawed, for most of the supporting 
characters are merely cardboard. But that doesn't matter. The story is a 
gripping one, and one of extreme importance. Kudos to Spielberg for 
finding it, finding the right men for the job, and letting the audience 
listen to the words of Cinque. A good job all around.</P>
<PRE>***1/2 out of 4, or an 8 out of 10.</PRE>
