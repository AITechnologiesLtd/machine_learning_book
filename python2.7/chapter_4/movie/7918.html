<PRE>                                    MONDO
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>No one knows where the 11-years-old Gypsy boy, Mondo,
came from (Ovidiu Balan, a real-life Rumanian gypsy  who
lived in a Gypsy camp in France with his mother and
grandmother and about to be deported when tapped by the
director, himself of Gypsy heritage, to play the part).</P>
<P>We first see him running through the streets of Nice
looking, seeking, contemplating his surroundings and all
the time on the run.  If he sees someone he likes, he
asks with an endearing smile if they will adopt him.</P>
<P>The film is about his life, what he sees, how he
survives, the friends he makes and, always avoiding the
police.  It is based on a short story by J.M.G. Le Clezio
(Mondo et autres Histoires)..</P>
<P>Many interesting characters cross the screen as Mondo
makes his rounds. There is the magician (Philippe Petit)
and his friend (Schaia Aalam) who, too, look after him a
bit.  She is a Turkish Kurd singer who has taken refuge
in Nice..  There is the woman, Thi Chin, a Vietnamese
(Pierrette Fesch)  who worries about this homeless boy.
And then there is the homeless man, Dadi (Jerry Smith),
a Scotsman who had been brought up with British Nobility
but abandoned it to live in the streets of Nice under a
bridge.  There is Giordan, the fisherman (Maurice
Maurin) who is a gardener in Menton but on Sundays can
be found fishing.  He wants to teach Mondo to fish and
to learn to read and write.    The mailman (Ange Gobbi)
(in real life a postman). who Mondo always asks if there
is any mail for him as if anyone knew his whereabouts. .
. . and the postman sadly says there is none today.
Despite the uncertainties of his life and where will
his next meal come from (a bakery lady gives him
bread), Mondo appears to be enjoying the freedom.</P>
<P>Blend these characters together with humor and pathos,
throw in the Gypsy Mondo, and we have a charming,
heartwarming film.</P>
<P>After the film's completion, Ovidiu Balan, his mother
and grandmother were deported to Rumania..</P>
