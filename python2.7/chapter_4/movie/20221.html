<PRE>MICKEY BLUE EYES
Directed by Kelly Makin
Screenplay by Adam Sheinman and Robert Kuhn
With Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn
UA North      PG-13      102 min.</PRE>
<P>     Nobody does Hugh Grant like Hugh Grant.  The urbane, slightly
sheepish, self-deprecating poise, the adorable, floppy-haired,
twinkling-eyed good looks, the Englishness worn simultaneously as an
apologetic scarlet "E" and a badge of honor -- it all adds up to an
original and satisfying screen persona.
     In "Mickey Blue Eyes", the gag is to juxtapose that character against
a very different ethnicity and style: the Mob.  It's a good gag, and Grant
uses his considerable skills to keep it light and funny for a nice stretch
as the movie gets underway.  He's Michael Felgate, director of a posh
Manhattan art auction house whose biggest problem is surly truckers who
make late and incomplete deliveries.  When he gets engaged to Gina Vitale
(Jeanne Tripplehorn), daughter of a mobster (James Caan), that problem
miraculously disappears.  But his real problems are just starting.
     At first Gina refuses him because she doesn't want him mixed up in the
family business.  He thinks he can handle it.  Boy, is he naive.  Soon he's
up to his French cuffs in money laundering, and his and the movie's
problems multipy when the stakes are raised with a murder.  Director Makin
doesn't seem up to that change of gears.  Laughs continue intermittently,
and there are some good ones, but the sureness is gone.  The movie offers
situations that want to be hilarious, as with a confusion of signals
involving an old lady at an auction, but neither the setup nor the payoff
rise to the occasion, which cries for Monty Pythonesque abandon.
     There's not much olive oil in the veins of Tripplehorn's Mafia
princess, and not much chemistry between her and Grant (there's more
between Grant and Caan.)  The Italian-American actors who make their living
as celluloid mafiosi are comfortable in their familiar roles.  
     "Mickey Blue Eyes" coasts after a funny start, and can't find its
rhythm when the plot takes a darker turn.  But it gets out of the gate
fast, and with Hugh Grant in the saddle it provides plenty of laughs along
the way.
