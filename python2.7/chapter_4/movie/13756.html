<PRE>WAITING FOR GUFFMAN</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>"You know that saying about how if you don't like the weather, just
wait five minutes?  Well, with some hard work and determination, I
believe we can get that down to three or four."  So says the mayor of
the small town of Blaine, Missouri, the setting for Christopher
Guest's WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.  This line, delivered absolutely deadpan
by comedian/actor Larry Miller, sets the tone for the film:
Ridiculous lines delivered by characters who are totally serious.  The
film is presented as a documentary which opens up as the Blaine City
Council prepares for the town's sesquicentennial celebration.  They
stand around a sandtable mock-up of the town square and position
little figurines as one security-minded councilmember suggests putting
snipers on the rooftops just in case things get "out of hand".</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, we are introduced to Corky St. Claire (Christopher
Guest), a stereotypically effeminate musical theater director who,
after finding only limited success in The Big Apple, moved to Blaine
to produce community plays featuring local talent.  For Blaine's
celebration, Corky is putting together a production which depicts the
history of the town, from it's founding by westward-bound settlers who
thought the Missouri River was the Pacific Ocean, to its boomtown days
of footstool production (earning Blaine the title of "Stool Capitol of
the United States"), to its purported visit by aliens prior to
Roswell, New Mexico.</P>
<P>We are introduced to a number of remarkably funny characters through
the audition held for Corky's big musical.  There's Ron and Sheila
Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), who run a local travel
agency, but have never been outside Blaine (well, except once when Ron
had to go to the next town for surgery).  They've caught the acting
bug and have appeared in Corky's previous efforts, including a musical
version of BACKDRAFT, where the audience had to be evacuated because
of the smoke.  There's also dentist Alan Pearl (Eugene Levy, who also
co-wrote the screenplay with Guest), whose singing audition is one of
the funniest moments in the film.  Finally, there's Libby Mae Brown
(Parker Posey), a Dairy Queen employee who is trying to create a soft
serve concoction to top the Blizzard.  Each displays a severe lack of
talent, but Corky sits there watching and smiling like Ed Wood,
believing that he's found diamonds in the rough.</P>
<P>Guest and Levy have created characters who are not outrageously
comical, but instead are just left of center.  They are normal enough
so that you might know these characters in real life, but odd enough
so that they make us laugh.  Indeed, their behavior is so regular-life
natural that it adds to the documentary feel, and it is exactly this
documentary style that makes WAITING FOR GUFFMAN so funny.  As an
audience, we're used to seeing documentaries made about serious or
interesting subjects, but we're not used to finding them humorous.
Additionally, what's played out for the camera is by all means
supposed to be serious; the documentary premise sets up a gritty view
of people who are basically living their lives.  The fact that their
actions are laughable is lost on them, but is totally our gain.  It's
as if we're in on some kind of joke that they're not privy to, and in
the crudest sense, we're laughing at them, not with them.  Sounds
terrible, but it's a wonderful vehicle for comedy.</P>
<P>There's no character development in this movie, and there really
doesn't need to be, since the paper-thin quality of the characters is
what makes their inclusion in a documentary so laughable.  We watch as
they try to learn the dance steps, lines, and lyrics and we can't help
but be amazed at how inept they are.  We watch open-mouthed as they
fantasize about taking the show to Broadway when they learn a talent
scout from a New York production company will be attending the
performance (his name is Guffman, and if you're familiar with Beckett,
you already know what will happen).  They end up pretty much on a
continuation of the paths they started before the entire Blaine
musical experience, not seeming to have learned a damn thing.  And we
love it.</P>
<P>Christopher Guest was one of the stars of Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL
TAP, a hilariously innovative "documentary" about a fictional heavy
metal rock group, and there is no doubt where Guest learned the craft
for directing WAITING FOR GUFFMAN.  While Guest uses a tamer group of
subjects for his film, and stylistically differs somewhat by his
choices to utilize longer scenes and leave the film unnarrated, for
example, one can definitely see the influences from his experience
with Reiner 12 years previously (has it really been that long?).  It
is a credit to Guest that he learned well and used his knowledge to
produce a film that is as original as it is an homage to the film
which broke new ground for comedy.</P>
