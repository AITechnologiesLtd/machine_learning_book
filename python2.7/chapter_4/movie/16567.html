<P>Susan Granger's review of "HANDS ON A HARD BODY" (Legacy Releasing)</P>
<P>When Matthew McConaughey's not acting movies, he's making them through his company JK Livin. "Hands on a Hard Body" is a unique, compelling 
documentary - not a porno of some nude showgirl - about a brand new, fully-loaded $15,000 Nissan hardbody pick-up truck, the first prize in a grueling endurance contest held each spring at a Longview, Texas, auto dealership. The first part of the film sets the scene: 24 contestants are told 
to keep one hand on the truck for as long as possible. The last person standing, with at least one hand on the pick-up, gets to drive away with it. Reminiscent of "They Shoot Horses, Don't They," which revolved around marathon dance contests during the Depression, this encompasses the entire human drama of hope, devastation, triumph and defeat. As the hours and days go by, the competitors get to know each other - and we get caught up 
in their mystical quest. There's the determined young woman in her early 
30s; an ex-Marine, confident he can outlast everyone because of his military training; a farmer who had to sell his last pick-up to pay bills;  a gospel-singing Christian who's sure that God is on her side; the elderly 
man who promised his wife he'd win the truck for her; and a cocky, colorful previous winner who provides most of the commentary. By deftly intercutting pre-contest interviews with actual footage, filmmaker S.R. Bindler 
(McConaughey's best friend) captures the nervous energy, stamina, exhaustion, and determination of the various challengers, revealing their authentic quirks and humorous eccentricities. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Hands on a Hard Body" is a crazy, incredible, intense 8. This is true Americana, and you gotta see it to believe it!</P>
