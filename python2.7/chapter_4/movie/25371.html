<PRE>The Perfect Storm (2000)</PRE>
<P>It's been  few days since I've seen Wolfgang Petersen's THE PERFECT STORM, 
and I don't like it as well as I did while I watched it.</P>
<P>I don't usually take this much time to percolate, to ponder over a film, 
before reviewing it.</P>
<P>Here's what I still think is very good:  The images of the hurricane itself, 
foreshadowed from early in the narrative, and climaxing at the end, are 
marvelous.  Much of this footage is computer generated, the waves as tall as 
buildings dwarfing the rather large swordfishing boat.  Often it is easy to 
pick out computerized work, especially when it involves water (think of the 
fake-y scenes in DEEP BLUE SEA),  but here the ocean appears real and 
threatening, a truly awesome natural force.  As the crew of the `Andrea 
Gail' valiantly fight to batten the windows and buck the waves, we 
understand somewhat the futility they must feel.</P>
<P>The acting is for the most part very strong.  I have always liked George 
Clooney, even though I thought he acted too much with those smiley eyes of 
his;  but in several scenes in STORM, Clooney seals the performance so far 
of his career.  He plays Captain Billy Tyne, who has brought his crew out on 
an extra fishing run, a result of a poor run from which they have just 
returned.  Tyne is a complicated man;  Clooney plays him as quiet yet 
fiercely proud and competitive.  When his crew suggests the `Andrea Gail' 
turn about, Tyne reveals his plans to venture even farther, halfway across 
the Atlantic even, to the `Finnish Cap,' where the real fish are.  This plot 
twist leads to the main conflict.  Will the men on the boat be able to 
navigate their way back home through the storm that has been ravaging the 
coast?  Where Clooney comes in is the scene in which Billy Tyne exerts his 
will over the crew.  It is a mixture of pep talk and threatening lecture, 
and Clooney's eyes are narrowed and dead serious.  Clooney proves himself a 
leading man, even more clearly than in another strong performance, in THREE 
KINGS.</P>
<P>We see good work from the supporting cast as well.  Mark Wahlberg is 
convincing as Bobby Shatford, who has cut bait and pack ships before, but 
who is a rookie in the actual fishing game.  The story follows his 
relationship with Christina Cotter (Diane Lane); this subplot serves as the 
romantic interest, as Tyne is divorced and living far from his family.  As 
`Murph,' John C. Reilly is always reliable, even though we don't know the 
full history of his hatred for another crew member, `Sully,' played by 
William Fichtner (remember him, the kooky SEAL from THE ABYSS, as well as 
the kooky astronaut from ARMAGEDDON?).  John Hawkes also plays an 
interesting, though sketchily developed character, in Michael `Bugsy' Moran.</P>
<P>What I think, upon second thought, is weak:  Petersen and screenwriter 
William D. Wittliff (from the non-fiction book by Sebastian Junger) work too 
hard at trying to build up the combination of cold fronts and hurricane that 
births this perfect natural disaster.  We watch rather disconnected scenes 
at a television news set in Boston, the meteorologist following the storm 
readouts as though he's witnessing the chance of his career.  There's no 
connection between this subplot and the main characters, and there is only a 
tenuous connection to a small craft, piloted by a rich man (Bob Gunton, the 
kooky warden in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION), and carrying two female 
passengers.  About to be swamped by the storm, the three are rescued at 
great risk by the crew of a Coast Guard chopper.  While the three shaken 
victims wait aboard the Guard cutter, the crew leave on another mission, to 
try and rescue the men of the `Andrea Gail.'</P>
<P>Actually, some of the scenes involving the trouble experienced by the 
chopper crew are some of the best in the film.  This suggests to me, though, 
that we need stronger connections between all of the subplots:  Petersen 
needs to work on his connectors.</P>
<P>My other major complaint concerns the ending.  Without spoiling it with 
specific revelations, I judge the closing now as too sentimental.  Perhaps 
one or even two scenes at the very end could be cut – then we would not have 
to sit through a couple of moments that try but fail to earn our tears.  It 
seems as though the director simply refused to end with the outcome of the 
sea story, and had to return to the women who waited faithfully on land.</P>
<P>So, the sea story works well on its own, the men battling each other and 
then the storm.  This microcosmic representation of the world is 
particularly interesting, as it calls up the madness of some scenes in 
Mellville's  MOBY DICK, the quintessential American novel.  What I'm 
thinking of is the pattern of bad omens that convinces the crew the voyage 
is doomed.  However, when the other subplots surface occasionally – the 
weatherman and the rich, bad sailor and the worried women back at home – 
they give thin support to the main story.</P>
<P>On the whole, THE PERFECT STORM offers very solid summer entertainment, with 
some of the most gripping hurricane shots on film.  With a few reservations, 
I would recommend watching the film – particularly for the performances of 
Clooney, Wahlberg and Lane. But you may wish to wait for the video.</P>
