<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        Hollywood movies, good or bad, tend to be fairly predictable, since
they almost always conform to the conventions of a genre.  A successful
movie can overcome this limitation in a number of ways.  It may add a novel
twist to an otherwise familiar story line.  Or it may, for example, make
you worry about the protagonist even though you KNOW he or she will triumph
in the end.  And then, there's BARTON FINK, which favors breaking the mold
over bending the rules.</P>
<P>        Written, directed, and produced by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen
(BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA, MILLER'S CROSSING), BARTON FINK is a
shockingly original vision, that rare Hollywood production which strays
from the pack to create its own unique universe.  Remarkably, the Coens
have made a film which is virtually impossible to pigeon hole into any one
particular genre (or any three for that matter), and it is precisely this
elusive quality which makes BARTON FINK such a rewarding experience.  The
Coens offer the viewer genuine suspense, the kind where you don't have a
clue what's going to happen next.  It's a strange and wonderful sensation.</P>
<P>        Set in 1941, the movie stars John Turturro in the title role as an
idealistic playwright whose burning desire is to convey the plight of the
common man.  When his latest play becomes a hit on Broadway, Fink's agent
talks him into moving to Hollywood, where he can make good money writing
movies.  In L.A., Fink encounters a cornucopia of oddballs, starting with
the bossy studio chief (Michael Lerner), who assigns him to write a
B-wrestling picture.  In his flea-bag hotel, Fink strikes up a friendship
with his down-to-earth next door neighbor, Charlie Meadows, a door-to-door
insurance salesman played by John Goodman.  Suffering from writer's block,
Fink finds himself spending more time shooting the breeze with Charlie than
he does writing.  So he seeks the advice of W.P. Mayhew, an alcoholic
novelist who is modelled after William Faulkner and played with verve by
John Mahoney.  Mayhew isn't much help, but Fink hits it off with the famed
writer's secretary/lover (Judy Davis).  And there you have the key players
in a bizarre tale which has minimal plot but plenty of atmosphere and
off-beat humor.</P>
<P>        The movie plunges you into Fink's psyche and creates a dream-like
mood which is reminiscent (but not derivative) of David Lynch's best work.
The Coens demand absolute creative control over their films, and you can
clearly see the results in BARTON FINK.  Their idiosyncratic perspective
hasn't been diluted by script doctors or meddling studio executives, and
consequently, the style and tone of BARTON FINK are exceptionally
consistent and assured.  Dripping with metaphors, the movie revels in
ambiguity and offers heaping portions of food for thought.</P>
<P>        The Coen brothers are widely respected in Hollywood for their
writing, especially for their sharp, intelligent dialogue.  But they are
also masters of visual storytelling, and BARTON FINK finds them at the top
of their game.  Joel's fluid direction, Roger Deakins' mesmerizing
cinematography, and Dennis Gassner's surrealistic production design come
together to cast a hypnotic spell, transfixing you to the screen.  The
haunting film lingers in memory long after the credits roll and the lights
come up.</P>
<P>        Of course, directing also involves working with the actors, and
Joel has elicited inspired performances from his cast.  Turturro, who
masterfully conveys Fink's self-absorption, plays an unappealing character.
But when he's on the screen, you can't take your eyes off of him; he's
simply riveting.  Goodman, who has a near-perfect batting average in
supporting roles, convincingly plays Charlie Meadows as the ultimate common
man, but it's not until the film's finale that you realize just how
effective the performance has been.  As the hyperactive studio mogul,
Lerner is hilarious; his animated delivery is deliciously energetic and
deserves an Oscar nomination.  The movie stumbles only in the casting of
Davis, who seems wrong for her small but important role as Fink's romantic
interest.</P>
<P>        BARTON FINK has other pleasures as well, including Carter Burwell's
musical score, the recreation of 1940s Hollywood, and a wickedly macabre
sense of humor.  This rich, unconventional fable may be too much for some
viewers to swallow, but one thing is certain: the movie won't go in one ear
and out the other.  Don't leave your brain at the door; you're going to
need it for this one.</P>
