<P>     In the quiet New England town of Castle Rock, an unassuming
elderly man by the name of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow) has arrived to
open an antique shop called "Needful Things."  Most of Castle Rock's
residents discover some rare and coveted treasures within--a 1956
Mickey Mantle baseball card for a young boy, a china figurine for a
slightly off-balance woman, a magnificent chalice for a priest, and a
necklace that can take away an arthritic's pain.  The price asked by
Mr. Gaunt is always more than reasonable, at least where money is
concerned, and if a couple of pranks have to be played to round out the
deal, so be it.  The only one immune to "Needful Things" appears to be
Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris), the local chief of police, so when the
carnage starts, it's up to him to stop it.</P>
<P>     How is it that a film with a good cast, stylish direction and
camera work, and an intriguing premise can turn out mediocre?  Perhaps
if the production crew had known the answer to this question, NEEDFUL
THINGS would have been a far more engrossing and satisfying motion
picture experience than it actually is.</P>
<P>     What at the outset is the film's strength turns into its greatest
liability.  The basic concept is solid:  a gentle-seeming yet truly
sinister old man comes into town and acts as a catalyst to incite
people's greed to turn them against one another.  Unfortunately, once
that has happened, the movie doesn't know where to go with the story,
so it turns to the old Hollywood stand-bys of a pyrotechnics show, a
lot of dumb dialogue, and an ending that is unlikely to satisfy many.</P>
<P>     The final scene isn't the problem; it's the one that immediately
precedes it.  This is so dumb that I felt like yelling at the screen.
The big payoff in NEEDFUL THINGS is a gyp, and it takes the rest of the
film down a couple of notches.  Those that sit through this picture
deserve more than they're given.</P>
<P>     It's too bad about the climax, because the bulk of the overly-long
film shows promise.  There are the usual horror staples, like the meat
cleaver in the head and the shock-tactic swell of music, but most of
the story is scripted with the intelligent viewer in mind, and the
villain of the piece never dirties his hands.  The terror here is more
psychological than physical, and the real root of evil lies in the
cupidity of the citizens of Castle Rock.  Leland Gaunt only causes it
to surface.</P>
<P>     Max von Sydow is an inspired casting choice, and the performance
he turns in is by far the best thing about NEEDFUL THINGS.  He manages
a kind of gentlemanly wickedness that keeps the audience off-balance.
He's the bad guy, all right--there's never any doubt about that--but
he's so cultured and smooth, and delivers the one-liners so bitingly,
that it's almost impossible not to have a sneaking admiration for him.
Certainly, it's von Sydow's rendering of Gaunt that keeps the movie
from becoming tedious.</P>
<P>     Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, and Amanda Plummer have shown great
ability in the past, but none of that is evident here.  The best of the
three is Bedelia, and her role is relatively small.  Plummer is so bad
that she comes close to creating a caricature.  Harris, who's supposed
to be playing the heroic lawman, is about as potent as a limp noodle.</P>
<P>     If he hasn't done so well with three of the four main actors, at
least first-time feature director Fraser C. Heston (son of Charlton)
can boast excellent cinematography (by Tony Westman) and a creepy
atmosphere.  NEEDFUL THINGS consistently looks nice, even during its
most banal scenes.  Some of the choppy pacing is clearly Heston's
fault, but the editor cannot absolve himself entirely of blame.</P>
<P>     In the three Kenneth Branagh films he scored (HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN,
and this summer's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING), Patrick Doyle showed
significant versatility and range.  Sadly, the same ability is not in
evidence here, where Doyle reworks his DEAD AGAIN music into an
overwrought theme that, at best, does little for the film.  There are a
couple of effective musical sequences, but neither uses Doyle's work,
instead relying on "Ave Maria" and Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain
King".</P>
<P>     NEEDFUL THINGS is another example of a good idea gone awry.  This
seems to happen with alarming frequency when a Stephen King story is
involved.  Since I'm not a fan of Mr. King and can't claim to more than
occasionally read his work, it's difficult for me to say whether or not
this trait is indicative of his books.  Whatever the case, in Leland
Gaunt, NEEDFUL THINGS wastes one of the year's most intriguing
villains.  This is a case of a film building to an apex that isn't
there.  By the time the end credits roll, a lot of people will be
wondering if that was really everything.  Sadly, the answer is yes, but
at least the time invested is repaid in part by the fine performance of
Max von Sydow.</P>
