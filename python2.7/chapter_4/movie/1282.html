<PRE>                              BASIC INSTINCT
                       A film review by Jon Newman
                        Copyright 1992 Jon Newman</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by Paul Verhoeven
Screenplay by Joe Esterhas
Starring Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone
Music by Jerry Goldsmith</PRE>
<P>     Imagine SEA OF LOVE directed by Paul Verhoeven (ROBOCOP, TOTAL
RECALL).  Now replace Al Pacino with Michael Douglas, whose acting here
is limited to Meaningful Eye Contact.  Switch out Ellen Barkin for
Sharon Stone, who spends half the film naked and still can't achieve
half the heat Barkin achieves by just smiling.  Finally, mix in dozens
of unintentionally comic music stings by the uninspired Jerry Goldsmith,
plenty of gratuitous violence, and enough sex to move BASIC INSTINCT
onto the softcore porn shelf.  What remains?  BASIC INSTINCT is a huge
goose-egg of a film, a dud big enough to kill an entire film studio
(this is the last film by Carolco); it's not worth watching, even for
free.</P>
<P>     The plot of BASIC INSTINCT, such as it is, starts with the grisly
murder of a rock-and-roll promoter.  He is stabbed with an icepick
during a sex bondage act.  (Naturally, we get to watch.)  Suspicion
gathers around his lover Carolyn (Sharon Stone), an heiress and
paperback writer;  her last bestseller depicted just such a murder,
right down to the color of the scarf with which his hands were tied.
Did she do it, or was it some copycat murderer out to get her?</P>
<P>     Carolyn plays the role of femme fatale.  In the police
interrogation, her investigators frantically pantomime "hot under the
collar" as she describes how she seduced the producer as research for
her book, then used him later on occasion for casual sex.  She spends
her days befriending psychopathic murderers to get characters for her
books, and her nights hanging out at impossibly decadent San Francisco
clubs.  What is her next book?  "A cop falls for the wrong woman ...
she kills him."  Naturally, no cinematic cop can resist such a come-on.
She and Michael Douglas spend much of the rest of the film "fucking like
minks" (Michael Douglas' words) as his investigation, and her book about
him, draw toward their inevitable bloody conclusions.</P>
<P>     The rest of the plot is unworthy of even a summary.  Every standard
element is present:  the cop-buddy, the ex-wife and girlfriend, the
psychiatrist's report, the car chase, the sneering Internal Affairs
investigator, as if they were checked one-by-one off a checklist for Cop
Flicks.  The soundtrack telegraphs every punch; wherever there might
have been some danger of surprising the audience, the heavy-handed
musical score kicks in well in advance.  Indeed, the music seems to
start just a little too soon, as if it were meant as a parody.  "I
didn't know this was going to be a comedy," was a common response after
the screening of BASIC INSTINCT; but the film takes itself too
seriously, and is too inconsistent, to succeed even as a parody.</P>
<P>     The blame for this catastrophe lies squarely with Verhoeven.
Verhoeven seems to specialize in overblown sex and violence, but he's
definitely much better with violence.  ROBOCOP has a gritty, hip quality
which surpasses the special effects extravaganza and paper-thin plot.
Sexual intrigue, as opposed to mechanical violence, requires focus on
the actors rather than the stuntmen, and this is what BASIC INSTINCT
sorely lacks.  Verhoeven gets in one good car chase, as the cars weave
around oncoming traffic on a twisty two-lane mountain road.  But Michael
Douglas and Sharon Stone never get a chance to do more than rehash tired
cliches.  They never build up any chemistry, and that is the key failing
of BASIC INSTINCT.</P>
<P>     BASIC INSTINCT does, at least, succeed as softcore pornography, and
this may be its salvation at the box office.  It might do even better as
a video, where viewers will have more freedom to fast-forward to the
"good parts."  BASIC INSTINCT is just pornography, despite its "R"
rating.  Those looking for another SEA OF LOVE, or another BODY HEAT,
will be sorely disappointed.</P>
