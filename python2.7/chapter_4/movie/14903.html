THE WARRIORS
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Labelling is sometimes everything. In original MAD MAX, the
opening title set the plot of the movie in near future, thus
making it one of the science fiction classics, despite the
future world being almost exactly like our own. Walter Hill
wanted the same opening title for his action classic THE
WARRIORS. Producers weren't thrilled by that idea and
consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones.
On the other hand, producers were right on the mark; Walter
Hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing
trends that were quite visible in contemporary America. To
make the movie even more distant from future, plot was
loosely based on ANABASIS, historical book written by
Xenophon, Greek mercenary soldier who had described his
adventures in ancient Persia 2400 years ago.</P>
<P>Instead of ancient Persia, movie begins in contemporary
Coney Island, where Cleon (Dorsey Wright), leader of the
Warriors, local youth gang, gets invitation to the great
gathering of all youth gangs from the city. The gathering,
organised by Gramercy Park Riffs, most powerful gang in the
city, is taking place in Bronx. That is far away from
Warriors' home territory, but small and unarmed delegation
of the Warriors gets there safely thanks to the general
truce. On the gathering, Cyrus (Roger Hill), charismatic
leader of the Riffs, announces his grand plan to unite all
the gangs and take over the city. Crowd is enthusiastic, but
the small gang of Rogues, led by psychopathic Luther (David
Patrick Kelly) uses the opportunity to assassinate Cyrus.
Police simultaneously raids the gathering, and in the
commotion Warriors get blamed by the killing, and their
leader gets killed by Riffs. The remaining eight, led by
Cleon's lieutenant Swann (Michael Beck), must now try to get
to Coney Island, but this time unprotected by truce and
instead being chased by all the gangs.</P>
<P>Upon its release, despite the controversies and even some
youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it, THE WARRIORS
enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some
kind of a cult status. However, despite being one of the
best movies of that year, and being directed by talented
action director Walter Hill at the peak of his career, the
movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future
generations as some other cinematic achievements of that
same year. The reason for that probably lies in a fact that
this movie aged very quickly. If Walter Hill's idea was to
warn the public about problems of urban America, he failed
miserably. The future was much worse than his vision. The
youth gangs, as presented in THE WARRIORS, are far from
shadowy armies, able to take over entire cities. Their
members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their
little petty feuds than such prosaic, and for the public
more annoying, matters like crime. In their vocabulary, word
"arms" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects, and
only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns. They
even have their own, very strict and detailed laws, upheld
more strictly than some governments do with their own. Many
people in American cities would be more than happy to see
their young criminals behaving like those in THE WARRIORS.
Some of the critics who accused Hill of actually praising
youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour.</P>
<P>Despite those objections, THE WARRIORS have all the elements
of a very good film. The plot is simple, and serves as good
basis for numerous action scenes. The fights are brilliantly
choreographed and quite realistic, although there isn't much
bloodshed or gore in the movie. Editing is superb, events
happen at quick pace, with the exception of middle, when
boring moralistic exchanges between Swann and his
would-be-girlfriend Mercy (Deborah van Valkenburgh) drag the
plot from straight action to social drama territory. The
soundtrack by Barry de Vorzon is very suggestive and
recognisable. Yet, the trademark of this film are the actors
who showed great talent, although most of them later sunk
into anonymity. Best known of them is David Patrick Kelly,
whose superb and original performance in this film later
subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains.
Michael Beck as cool, almost statesman-like leader of a
gang, is also very good, and James Remar gives good contrast
as his hot-shot contender for top spot. All in all, this
movie is perhaps dated, yet in its hour and half can give a
lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies.</P>
