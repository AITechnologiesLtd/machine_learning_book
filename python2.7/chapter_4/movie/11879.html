<PRE>MERCURY RISING
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 1998 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        The opening, very deliberate minutes of "Mercury Rising," Bruce
Willis' latest retread, sets up the oft-seen hostage situation in which a
bunch of raggedy bank robbers negotiate with police.  For a moment I was
reminded of that film-within-a-film finale of Robert Altman's brilliant
"The Player," in which a pumped-up Willis caricatures himself, busting in
at the last possible minute and rescuing a frail Julia Roberts with an
apologetic "traffic was a bitch."</P>
<P>        But in Harold Becker's action thriller, undercover FBI agent Art
Jeffries (Willis) is already inside the bank and doing a little negotiating
of his own.  Jeffries thinks he can end this standoff without bloodshed,
but the impatient cops move too soon and Jeffries is left, quite literally,
with blood on his hands.</P>
<PRE>        Bummer.</PRE>
<P>        Said to have lost his magic touch, Jeffries is assigned to "sit on
a wire" from hereon out.  But shortly after one of the film's secondary
characters repeats the transit metaphor--"traffic was like mud; I oozed
home"--a couple of shots are fired and a nine-year old boy is suddenly left
parentless.  Enter Jeffries stage left.</P>
<PRE>        Which reminded me of something else I remember from "The Player."</PRE>
<P>        Of the thousands of scripts a major studio reviews each and every
year, only about a dozen are so are produced.  One wonders, therefore, why
the executives at Universal chose to greenlight this particular project.
"Mercury Rising" is certainly no worse than any half dozen Bruce Willis
shoot-em-ups.  It's just not any better.</P>
<P>        The film's "hook" is that the kid in danger here is autistic.  The
filmmakers go to great lengths--and I mean *great* lengths--to show us what
that means, exactly.  Simon (convincingly portrayed by Miko Hughes) stares
off into space, presses doorbells very deliberately, repeats things by
rote, and acts afraid in the presence of strangers (unless they happen to
be *cute* strangers, like the one played by Kim Dickens, for example).</P>
<P>        Simon also enjoys puzzles, and this proves to be his undoing, as he
inadvertently deciphers a matrix of seemingly random characters in a
"geek's puzzle magazine," placed there by two National Security Agency
compududes to see if anyone human out there could crack a two billion
dollar chunk of code known as "Mercury."</P>
<P>        My favorite scene in the film comes when one of these nerds tells
Jeffries that he'll leave him an e-mail message in an account called
"einstein."  Jeffries has a savvy librarian do a Web search for "FBI" and
"einstein," instantly locating the address, and logging in.  "Try Arthur"
Art suggests for the password, but that's not it.  "How about E=MC2?" and,
as an afterthought, "all caps."  He's in!</P>
<P>        Why worry about some juvenile savant puzzledoer posing a threat to
national security when you've got Bruce Willis: SuperGuesser to contend
with?</P>
<P>        One of the interchangeable Baldwin brothers plays Lt. Colonel
Nicholas Kudrow, creator of the NSA code, who wants Simon erased (er, why
exactly?).  You know he's a bad guy because he talks in a very loud
whisper.  Kudrow and Jeffries eventually duke it out atop a skyscraper that
looks a little too like the Nakatomi building in "Die Hard," with the
autistic kid wandering around on the ledge to increase the tension.</P>
<P>        Willis is no Olivier but he's always fun to watch.  Unfortunately,
the rest of "Mercury Rising," even with its autism bent, is simply stock
footage.</P>
