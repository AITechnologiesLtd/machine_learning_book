<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Inspired by a Pushkin novel, which it considerably watered down, "The
Eagle" has been adapted to the screen by the sure-handed Clarence Brown,
in a tribute to the kind of adventure story Douglas Fairbanks
popularized in his silent 1922 Robin Hood film and in his Zorro role in
1920 The Mark of Zorro. This film is a tale of adventure, romance, and
intrigue, with a good deal of tongue-in-cheek comedy thrown in to help
the predictable story out. It was a very popular film in its time. The
star, Rudolph Valentino, was a matinee idol, and when he died
unexpectedly a year later at the age of 31, after making his last film
"The Son of the Sheik," he became a death-cult idol for many years
afterward. This, his penultimate film, is a good example of how his
mannered acting and striking Latin looks, made him a ladies favorite.
The film also has the great art designer, William Cameron Menzies, do
its breathtaking sets. Carl Davis does the musical arrangements in the
updated film version, adding the Russian touch to the ongoing screen
action, with music by Tchaikovsky, Rimski-Korsakoff, and Prokofiev.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Dubrovsky (Rudolph Valentino), of Catherine the Great's
Imperial Guard, catches the lecherous eye of the man-hungry Czarina and
is invited to supper. She makes a pass at him, promising to make him a
general, but he not only rebuffs her advances but leaves the palace
grounds. She is so miffed by his rebuff that she calls him a deserter
and issues a warrant for his arrest: dead or alive.</P>
<P>Valentino gets a letter from his father's deathbed telling how he has
been cheated out of his estate by his false aristocratic friend and
fellow wealthy landowner Kyrilla (Marcus), asking him to get the Czarina
to intercede on his behalf. When he dies, Valentino takes an 'oath of
vengeance' and gets help from the loyal serfs on his father's estate,
who form a Robin Hood gang of masked bandits, robbing only from the
wealthy. He becomes known as the legendary Black Eagle, since he can
swoop down at any time. Kyrilla gets the Cossacks to be his bodyguards,
as they hunt down the wanted Valentino. They don't realize the Black
Eagle is the son of the one Kyrilla swindled.</P>
<P>Valentino falls for Kyrilla's pretty daughter Mascha (Banky) when his
men capture her and he liberates her, saying women are not his enemies.
He will forcefully change places with the French tutor Monsieur Le
Blanc, and will come to live in his enemies' household, falling head
over heels in love with Mascha, to the point where he forgets about his
revenge. No one recognizes him at first, but Mascha will in due time.
But she has also fallen for him by that time and responds positively
towards his love.</P>
<P>He gets captured when one of his loyal men (Michael Pleschkoff ) gets
caught on Kyrilla's estate, and to protect his man, tells them that he
is the Black Eagle. Turned over to Catherine to be executed, his fortune
changes when his former captain (Conti), who is now the Czarina's lover
and a general, tricks the Czarina into signing a passport for him as the
French tutor. She approves of sparing Valentino's life, after finding
out about the deception, and proves that even she's not so bad.</P>
<P>The film was set in the 18th century, but the costumes were from more
modern times.</P>
<P>The simplified moral story becomes a lesson reinforcing that love is
stronger than vengeance. Valentino is dashing in the role, but it is
difficult to see what made him so popular from this movie. I feel the
same way about James Dean when I see his films. But there must have been
something beyond what was seen onscreen to explain his tremendous
appeal. This satisfying film is a good one to determine for yourself
what there is about him that had his lady fans swoon over him. It is a
large-scale picture, giving him a chance to do both action and romantic
scenes, the kind of serious acting he wasn't asked to do in his previous
films.</P>
