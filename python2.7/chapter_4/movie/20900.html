<PRE>Street Theater
King of Masks</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>A Chinese film with English subtitles, "The King of Masks" starts out strong
and enduring, but squanders its tender sincerity on dramatics.</P>
<P>A sweet and aging street performer with no male descendants to carry on his
mask-changing art resorts to purchasing an orphan boy. The relationship
between the two outcasts from opposite ends of the life cycle is as warm and
rich to witness as the man's artistry. However, very early on we (the
audience) learn that the boy is really a girl, a promising conflict to this
modest paradise. Soon thereafter, the old man wises up to this fact as well.
A strong animosity between the two develops into a spark which ignites an
unnecessary fire of dramatic events resulting in the old man's
incarceration.</P>
<P>If I could forgive the accidental fire and the pending hanging of the old
man (which I could), then I would have enjoyed the orphan's desperate,
though theatric, act of redemption (which I did). But, it went too far.
Already dangerously teetering on the melodramatic, this powerfully sweet
scene concludes with entirely anticlimactic redundant and plainly putrid
dialogue. Where was the editor?</P>
<P>If my words are harsh on this little film, it's only because the filmmakers
wet my appetite with a wonderful setting to what I'd expected to be a great
film.</P>
<P>Why spill the beans so soon? This unique relationship would have been enough
to keep me interested -- I didn't need the pseudo drama. Why not have the
girl keep her secret well into her teens, only to find out after the old man
dies that he knew her secret all along?</P>
<PRE>Starring Chu Yuk and Chao Yim Yin.
Directed by Zhu Xu.
Shaw Brothers distributed by Samuel Goldwyn.
Mandarin w/ English Subtitles.</PRE>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
