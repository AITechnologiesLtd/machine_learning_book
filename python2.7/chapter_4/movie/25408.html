<PRE>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A>
"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>The amount of hate mail I received from people that took offense to my
review of the first Pokémon film was enough to choke a horse.  Here are
two of my favorites:</P>
<P>"Maybe you lack confidence in your point of view and have to secure it
by making jokes at the expense of the innocent, asshole."</P>
<P>"I hope that sometime during your worthless life that you experience a
trauma so severe that it causes you to become an epileptic."</P>
<P>Can you believe it?  What kind of monster would write such horrible
things to a guy who is just trying to make a living writing film
reviews?  All I did was suggest that Pokémon might be a good thing for
society because it has been known to give its viewers seizures and that
our ^Óherds^Ô needed some ^Óthinning.^Ô  No big deal, right?  It^Òs not like
I^Òm the one giving kids seizures.  So wipe the drool from the chins of
your zombified children and send your hate mail to the people that make
the stupid television show.</P>
<P>You^Òd think I^Òd launched a full-scale attack on an American classic from
the volumes of responses I received.  It wasn^Òt Ben Hur, or Schindler^Òs
List, or even Spaceballs.  We^Òre talking about Pokémon.  You could put
100 monkeys in a room with 100 typewriters and not get a concept as bad
as Pokémon.  It shouldn^Òt be possible to make something this immediately
unwatchable.  If your kids like Pokémon, there^Òs probably something
really wrong with them.  Maybe you were too busy firing off e-mail to
film critics while Junior was guzzling the Drano under the kitchen sink.</P>
<P>I^Òve learned a few more things about Pokémon since the first film, like
that each Pokémon can say nothing but its name.  This enabled me to
figure out that the name of the thing I called Turtle-Pokémon is
actually Squirtle.  I only mention this because we used the same name
for the kid on our high school track team who had a perpetual wet spot
that seeped through to the front of his sweat pants.</P>
<P>Like Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back, the new film begins with an awful
unaired episode of the television show called Pikachu^Òs Rescue
Adventure.  Pikachu, if you remember, is the little yellow squeak-toy
owned by Pokémon master Ash.  In short, Pikachu rescues the
baby/star/egg Pokemon (just like in Mewtwo), as well as a cat hanging
Wily E. Coyote-style on a branch on the side of a cliff.  There was
supposed to be some kind of moral about accomplishing things through
teamwork, but it gets kind of lost through the bad animation and stupid
little noises that each creature makes.</P>
<P>Pokémon 2000 concerns an evil Pokémon master that is trying to collect
three rare Pokemon in an attempt to unlock great treasures.  Ash and his
friends also set off in search of the same uncommon Pokémon after
crashing their boat into a remote island and having the natives mistake
him for ^Óthe chosen one.^Ô  I had my fingers crossed that Ash would end
up on an island populated by flesh-eating head-hunters, or perhaps an
overweight homosexual exhibitionist and a grumpy homophobic ex-Navy
Seal, but things just didn^Òt pan out for me.</P>
<P>Pokémon 2000 is probably a little more visually pleasing than Mewtwo,
just from a few scenes that offer computer-generated animation (all of
which seemed way too similar to the video game ^ÓMyst^Ô).    But you
should not take that statement as a ringing endorsement, or even as a
suggestion that you take your sticky little brats to see it.  Scary
Movie is a better family film.</P>
<P>On a humorous note, the translation of the Japanese title of Pokémon
2000 (Poketto monsutaa: Maboroshi no Pokemon X: Lugia bakudan) is The
Phantom Pokemon: Lugia's Explosive Birth.  Now that^Òs entertainment.</P>
<PRE>1:08 ^Ö G for good God, get my gun.</PRE>
