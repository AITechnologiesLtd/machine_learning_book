<PRE>"Dorks."
    - Tarantino to Keitel</PRE>
<P>     Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to RESERVOIR DOGS is a brilliantly
funny series of sketches about professional criminals and their
miraculous second chances.  No sophomore slump here; PULP FICTION is a
shoo-in for sanction among critical and commercial audiences alike.</P>
<P>     The stories number four and go something like this: two lovers
(Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) want to switch from heisting liquor
stores to robbing restaurants.  Meanwhile, a hitman named Vincent
(Travolta) has been ordered to take the boss's wife (Uma Thurman) out
to dinner.  Meanwhile, boxer Butch Coolidge (Willis) has been ordered
to take a dive in fifth.  Meanwhile, Vincent and his partner Jules
(Samuel L. Jackson) have to clean-up the mess from a "bad hit."  Got
it?</P>
<P>     Said stories are presented both separately and out of order, and
the effect actually strengthens the suspense.  All is made clear in the
last hour, but, until then, the viewer is lured into a lurid limbo
where no one--either in the audience or on-screen--can even *imagine*
what's going to happen next.</P>
<P>     While the direction is good, very good, nothing sizzles like the
script.  Tarantino's prose overflows with some of the richest (and most
unprintable) dialogue of the decade.  Punctuating the obscenities are
pop references of every sort; from Madonna (of course) to "Le" Big
Mac.</P>
<PRE>     Close your eyes and see it a second time.</PRE>
<P>     You could quibble on a couple points, such as the length of the
third segment.  But, oh those stories!  Here is a world where even the
smallest detail--such as the unavailability of a "balloon"--can
mushroom into the most catastrophic of consequences.  The violent
unpredictability of the Tarantino universe has never been more brutal.</P>
<P>     With two exceptions, the ensemble is exceptional.  PULP FICTION
marks the umpteenth return of John Travolta, who gives a career
performance as the toilet-trained (don't ask) hitman Vincent Vega.  His
partner, Samuel L. Jackson, hits a higher note in the commanding role
of Jules; he's so cool, you can't take your eyes off him.</P>
<P>     The two sore thumbs are Willis (too loose) and Tarantino (too
stiff).  Better is Christopher Walken, who wanders through for one
scene and one delicious monologue.  He's almost as good as Harvey
Keitel, who makes an eleventh-hour appearance as the world's
best-dressed janitor.</P>
<PRE>     And, yes, that's Mr. Pink as Buddy Holly.</PRE>
<P>     To those who strain to complain about the subject matter, all I
can say is, well, touche.  PULP FICTION plays for laughs rape, racism,
murder, masochism, drug overdoses, Vietnam POWs, and, even, the Bible.
If any of the aforementioned offends, then this may not be best movie
for you.</P>
<P>NOTE:  Film won the Best Picture award at this year's Cannes film
       festival where the director gave the finger to a detractor during
       a press conference.  Really.</P>
<PRE>BOTTOM LINE:  Best Picture, no question.  Not for the sensitive or
              squeamish.</PRE>
