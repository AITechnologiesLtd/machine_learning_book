<PRE>"American Pie 2" -- Another Tasty Slice of Summer Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"AP2" is a frequently bawdy yet often hilarious film
about college freshman looking to have the summer of
their lives.  There's no better way to enjoy your
first summer out of high school than at the beach,
away from your parents and surrounded by bathing
beauties, plentiful amounts of beer, and your best
friends.  There's unlimited opportunity to talk about
sex, curse, and engage in generally bizarre behavior. 
Ain't summer grand?  And if you think that such a film
will never teach you anything worthwhile, you're
wrong.   Listen carefully: super glue and porn films
don't mix.</P>
<P>"AP2" reunites the entire ensemble from the first
film, led by likeable doofus Jim (Jason Biggs) who was
taught that making love felt like warm apple pie. 
Meanwhile, his friends also came to grips with their
changing lives and first loves.  It's been a year
since their infamous prom night (the setting of the
first "AP").  Has college taught them anything?  If
not, perhaps this summer will teach them something
themselves and about life.  These guys have a lot of
catching up to do and happily and funnily, we see that
nothing much has changed.  </P>
<P>Jim is still as klutzy as ever, and his sexual
encounters amount to embarrassing debacles.  Nadia
(Shannon Elizabeth), his one-time Czech girlfriend, is
scheduled to return at the end of the summer.  In
their only session, he...uh...blew it pretty badly. 
He's naturally nervous.  "She deserves filet mignon,"
he laments.  "All she'll get with me is rump roast."  </P>
<P>Luckily, he has the whole summer to prepare.  He gets
some sexual pointers when he revisits Michelle (Alyson
Hannigan), his kinky prom date who always has a story
about "this one time at Band Camp."  She enjoys an
expanded role from the first film and provides a sweet
element of poignancy.</P>
<P>The rest of the lovable gang has their share of issues
as well, although their screen time seems to be
reduced this time around.  Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas)
is trying to handle his feelings for former girlfriend
Vicky (Tara Reid) who wants to be just friends.  Oz
(Chris Klein) and Heather (Mena Suvari) try to carry
out a long-distance relationship while injecting a
1-900 spirit to their conversations.  Finch (Eddie
Kaye Thomas), whose sexual comeuppance with Stifler's
mom made him a God among all High School dorks,
studies about Tantric orgasms as he awaits her return.</P>
<P>And then there's the glorious, rambunctious Stiffler
(Seann William Scott) who is 100% id.  I believe that
a bust of his likeness should be mandatory in every
fraternity in America.  This guy is the party animal
that we all loved and simultaneously regretted knowing
back in college.  Our audience even cheered for him
when he first appeared.  Stiffler deserves his own
sitcom or a recurring role on Saturday Night Live.</P>
<P>But we're here for its raunchiness.  While the
direction and pace is erratic at times, many of the
scenes are daringly funny and gross-out memorable. 
The audience had a tremendous reaction to a scene
featuring spilled champagne and was in an uproar
during a sequence about libidinous lesbians.</P>
<P>"AP2" has lots of funny moments and the characters are
all quite endearing.  They try so hard to generate
laughter, it's impossible not to like them.  Everyone
looks happy to be back, and like old friends that we
haven't seen for a while, they are always welcome. 
Times may change; people may change.  But thankfully,
friends stay the same.</P>
