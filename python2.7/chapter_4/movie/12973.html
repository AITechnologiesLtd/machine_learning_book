<PRE>BULWORTH
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I didn't care what this movie was about; as soon as I heard it 
featured 61-year-old Warren Beatty rapping, I knew I had to see it. 
Little did I know BULWORTH would be the best political satire of the 
decade and a key moment in Beatty's career. Yes, it's even better than 
DICK TRACY (yes, that's sarcasm) and it nails on the head some of 
America's biggest problems, besides the fact that it can produce a 
61-year-old white rapper. No one escapes Beatty's so-liberal-it's-
socialist attack, not the Democrats or Republicans, not the insurance 
companies or the media and not the minorities for which Beatty tries 
to speak.</P>
<P>        Beatty plays Jay Bulworth, a U.S. senator facing reelection. 
He takes payoffs and contributions from all the right people and 
ignores all the wrong ones, living the perfect politician's lie with his 
wife (Christine Baranski) and teenage daughter. Watching his latest 
shiny TV ads, he finally gets sick of it all and arranges to have himself 
killed, making sure to bargain with an insurance lobbyist to take out a 
$10 million policy on himself. Then he writes a 130-page mission 
statement and gets fired from the agency, and only Cuba Gooding Jr. 
will stay with him. I may have some of the plot confused at this point, 
but bear with me.</P>
<P>        At the next morning's campaign stop at a black church in Los 
Angeles, Bulworth scraps the scripted speech to field questions from 
the audience. Among other things, he tells them the Democratic party 
isn't loyal to black voters because they have no financial clout and that 
politicians just tell them what they want to hear. Bulworth's top 
advisor (Oliver Platt) pulls the fire alarm before he can stick any more 
feet in his mouth, and they're off to the next stop, where Bulworth 
further insults a group of Jewish filmmakers. It's an interesting 
campaign strategy, although not one that's worked for Buchanan or 
David Duke.</P>
<P>        It's in fleeing from the angry moguls that he acquires his new 
posse, a trio of African-American ladies spearheaded by Nina (Halle 
Berry). Bulworth spends that night hanging at an inner-city nightclub 
where he smokes blunts, dances until dawn, starts rapping casual 
conversations and eventually takes his turn at the twin turntables. It all 
prepares him for the fundraiser breakfast the next morning, where he 
once again scraps his scheduled speech, this time rapping out a new 
one that attacks politics and the power structure.</P>
<P>        The interesting thing is, after Platt and the other campaign 
people freak out, the public laps it all up like a contented kitty cat. 
And Bulworth doesn't want to die anymore, so he has to try to get the 
hit called off. This subplot is more convention than innovation, and 
distracts from the movie's real message. Fortunately, there's not much 
screentime devoted to the assassination plot; instead we see Bulworth 
in Nina's neighborhood, dealing with her large family and the local 
druglord (Don Cheadle, going from BOOGIE NIGHTS porn star to 
drug dealing gangsta).</P>
<P>        BULWORTH has a lot of hilarious moments, but there's a 
message, and it's not one a lot of people want to hear because it puts 
America in a pretty sad state of affairs. I saw this with about six other 
white people in a mid-Missouri outlet mall, and most of them didn't 
like it. As they were exiting and complaining, the theater manager 
actually apologized for the movie for making them think about more 
than the usual action-packed thrills and romance. Yet he shows 
GODZILLA with a clean conscience. More than anything, that sums up 
what is wrong with our country right now.</P>
