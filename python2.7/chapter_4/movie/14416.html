<P>Following a morning press screening of "Ronin," the theater manager met 
me and a fellow critic in the lobby and asked what we thought of the 
action thriller. When we each said that we enjoyed the film, he took a 
step backwards in shock, as if we'd popped him in the head with a ball-
peen hammer, then exclaimed in utter amazement, "I can't believe it! How 
could you...why would you...I mean, it was total crap!" </P>
<P>I laughed and said, "It was like sitting at home on a lazy Saturday 
afternoon, watching one of those old-fashioned action movies where you 
don't care about the plot because it's so much fun simply watching car 
chases and big stars shooting at each other." "That's exactly what's 
wrong with it," he said. "There was no substance, just clichés and car 
chases."</P>
<P>"But that was all on purpose," I countered, "The director deliberately 
threw in virtually every movie cliché in the book. John Frankenheimer is 
no dummy. He was winking at us! Besides, Robert De Niro and Jean Reno are 
two of the greats and watching them work together was good enough for me.
" The theater manager shook his head and said, "Aw, you like those two so 
much that you're letting them blind your judgment. And as for all that 
'winking at us' business, well, that's just not enough anymore."</P>
<P>We changed the subject at this point, realizing that with this particular 
film we would find no common ground. I've included the exchange here 
because, although I disagree with my associate, his point of view is 
valid and deserves recognition. That "Ronin" is a virtual cavalcade of 
film clichés is inarguable. My contention is that Frankenheimer's use of 
those clichés is part of his artistry.</P>
<P>Set in France, "Ronin" deals with a group of mercenaries hired by an 
operative (Natascha McElhone) to retrieve a heavily-guarded briefcase 
before another shadowy group snags it. The mercenaries are highly-skilled 
ex-government agents, ready to work without asking questions, as long as 
the price is right. Who are the two groups and what is inside the 
briefcase? It doesn't matter and that's the beauty of "Ronin." </P>
<P>Working from a script by David Mamet (using a pseudonym due to a Writer's 
Guild conflict), John Frankenheimer strips the action thriller genre down 
to its bare bones. These films aren't about plot, they're about plot 
mechanics. They're not about well-drawn characters, they're about 
archetypes exchanging quips. They're not about logic, they're about sound 
and motion set against exotic locales. </P>
<P>So what does he give us? World-weary soldiers and an earthy young beauty 
racing through gorgeous French cities. Elaborate plans in musty rooms and 
intricate double-crosses. Daring gun battles and high speed car chases 
down narrow streets and twisting mountain roads. And, most important, 
conversations between Robert De Niro and Jean Reno.</P>
<P>De Niro and Reno compliment each other in grand fashion, first as wary 
coworkers and later as comrades who bond under duress. As American ace 
strategist Sam, De Niro is efficiency personified; a seasoned agent who 
knows the importance of maintaining his cool no matter how dire the 
situation. He also chooses to keep his background to himself. Asked if he 
has every killed anyone, he allows the tiniest hint of a smile as he 
answers "I hurt somebody's feelings once." Jean Reno plays Vincent, a 
French procurer and facilitator who radiates calm as he goes about his 
business. Regardless of his actions, you sense that this is an inherently 
decent man. </P>
<P>In keeping with the motif of minimalism, the rest of the cast are rough 
sketches, with each exhibiting only one identifying characteristic. 
That's fine, since De Niro and Reno provide all the character required 
for a film like this. Their exchanges are punctuated by hair-raising car 
chases and elaborate set pieces. High points include a night time battle 
near the Seine, a sly reconnaissance mission at the Majestic Hotel in 
Cannes, and a climatic stand-off during an ice show. Frankenheimer douses 
each set piece with classic movie clichés: billboards telegraph upcoming 
scenes and there's a fruit cart on every street, just waiting to be 
overturned during the next chase sequence. </P>
<P>What does it all add up to? For me, it was a refreshing visit to the good 
old days of charismatic actors engaged in intricate, exciting and 
pointless bedlam. For my theater manager friend, it was a maddening 
example of all that's wrong with contemporary cinema. If you're so 
inclined, check out "Ronin" and decide which one of us was right.</P>
