<PRE>               A film review by Michael Dequina</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1996 Michael Dequina</PRE>
<PRE>(R) *** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Put together two Oscar winners (Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage), an
Oscar nominee (Ed Harris), the slick producing team of Jerry Bruckheimer and
the late Don Simpson, a stylish action director (Michael Bay), Alcatraz, and
a bunch of explosives and you get... a major action hit, which The Rock is
sure to become this summer.</P>
<P>The somewhat preposterous plot has a group of renegade Marines, led
by General Francis X. Hummel (Harris), seizing control of the legendary
island prison, take its visitors hostage, and threatening to launch a deadly
biological weapon at the San Francisco bay area if the United States
Government does not give the families of dead Desert Storm vets millions in
government aid.  What does the government do?  Call in a force of Navy SEALs
(led by Michael Biehn), assisted by FBI biochemist Stanley Goodspeed (Cage)
and John Patrick Mason (Connery), an old prisoner who was the only person
ever to escape "the rock," to try to break into Alcatraz, thwart Hummel and
free the hostages.</P>
<P>Contrary to outward appearances, this project shares a number of
striking similarities with Bay's Bad Boys, and not just in terms of visual
style.  Both films open with a break-in; both feature an elaborate chase
sequence which ends with a circling shot of the hero(es) getting up off of
the street; both are essentially bickering buddy films; and in both one of
the heroes has to overcome a shortcoming that the other ridicules: in Bad
Boys, Martin Lawrence had to learn how to drive fast; in The Rock, Cage's
scientist character has to learn how to handle a combat situation.  Parts of
the film are also strongly reminiscent of Crimson Tide, with a little
Executive Decision and Outbreak thrown in.  But these similarities to other
films don't detract from the enjoyment of The Rock on its own terms, which
is not to say it's not without its problems.  While its opening 45 minutes
are far from boring, it takes that long for the plot to really get going,
i.e. for the "good guys" to begin their break into Alcatraz, when the film
really starts cooking.  Bay uses a lot of the flashy eye candy visuals he
brought to Bad Boys--lots of blue light, slow motion, quick camera moves and
editing.  But unlike his debut film, here his style comes dangerously close
to being at the expense of coherence.  It's one thing to use the "shaky
cam," but it's quite another to use it while it is fixed in a tight closeup
of something or someone; the resulting chaotic shot is more confusing than
visually arresting.  In spite of this, though, Bay really knows how to stage
exciting action scenes (the aforementioned chase scene, while using every
chase cliche in the book including the infamous fruit cart, is a real
standout) and large--very large--explosions and juggle them seamlessly with
the comedy, which David Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook, and Mark Rosner's lively
script surprisingly has a lot of.</P>
<P>In taking a dive into action, it would be easy to think that Cage
has sold out, abandoning his trademark quirky characters for a more
straightforward, mainstream action hero.  Happily, that's not the case.
Goodspeed is as much an oddball as Cage's usual roles, a neurotic, wimpy
Beatlemaniac who only very gradually toughens up; needless to say, Cage is
perfect in the role.  Connery proves he still is a credible action hero
after all these years though having his character being a former agent of
the British Secret Service seems a bit too gratuitous.  Harris adds layers
of complexity to a not very dimensional role, and Vanessa Marcil (my
favorite General Hospital star) manages to make a lasting impression as
Goodspeed's pregnant girlfriend Carla.  Those not so fortunate actingwise
are Biehn, who is wasted once again as the SEAL leader (isn't it time that
he be cast in a role deserving of his talent?), and William Forsythe's FBI
director is just a rehash of his police chief character in Virtuosity.</P>
<P>The Rock's ads urge you to "get ready to rock."  After seeing this
energetic action-packed ride that truly does "rock," I can't think of better
advice.</P>
