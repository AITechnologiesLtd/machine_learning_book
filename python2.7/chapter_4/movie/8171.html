<P>     OUT TO SEA is a harmless reworking of GRUMPY/GRUMPIER OLD MEN,
with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau masquerading as dance hosts on a
Caribbean cruise ship.  In a clime considerably warmer than northern
Minnesota, they bicker less, romance more, and spend the rest of the
movie trying to avoid the cruise dictator (Brent Spiner, of STAR
TREK), a big-band singer who proclaims himself "their worst night-
mare, a song-and-dance man raised on a military base." Though the
LOL moments are few and far-between, the cheery cast and sunny
locales are all exceptionally easy on the eyes.  As is the sight of
sixty-year old Dyan Cannon's washboard abs.  Lemmon and Matthau can
sleepwalk through their schtick, so they're fine.  And Spiner really
can sing.  Be forewarned:  there *is* a finale involving a pontoon
plane.  This time, though, nothing explodes afterward.  Be sure to
stay for the outtakes, which appear late over the closing credits.</P>
