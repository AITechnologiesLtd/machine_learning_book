<PRE>                                    QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Jeffrey Graebner
                        Copyright 1994 Jeffrey Graebner</PRE>
<P>     On a recent edition of his CBS talk show, David Letterman jokingly
stated that he had just seen Robert Redford's new film QUIZ SHOW and
that he felt compelled to confess that his show is completely fixed.
The basis of the humor in this joke is the fact that nobody today would
ever believe that the show *wasn't* mostly carefully planned and
scripted.  Letterman's joke actually hit on the essence of what
Redford's film is all about.</P>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW is a dramatization of the mid-1950s investigation into
early quiz shows that eventually resulted in the discovery that the
winners were pre- determined by providing contestants with the answers
ahead of time.  The film specifically follows young congressional
lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) as he investigates the claims of
disgruntled contestant Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) that the
producers of the popular quiz show "Twenty-One" forced him to take a
dive allowing charming intellectual Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes)
to become the new champion.</P>
<P>     Paul Attanasio's smart, witty, and insightful screenplay feels
much like a detective story as Goodwin interviews suspects and digs
through papers and kinescopes slowly uncovering details about how
deeply the fraud extends.  The film gives the audience most of the
details up front, mostly in scenes where producer Dan Enright (David
Paymer) and his assistant Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) are coaching
the contestants.  Giving the audience an omniscient view was a smart
move since most people will already have some familiarity with the true
events and would likely been annoyed if the film hadn't acknowledged
that.</P>
<P>     None of the characters in this film are clearly heroes or
villains.  Stempel is portrayed as an opportunistic man who comes
forward only when he no longer feels that staying silent is to his own
best advantage.  The film makes it rather clear that Enright could have
easily bought his silence if he had been willing to meet his price.
Stempel eventually does the right thing, but not entirely for the right
reasons.  Still, he isn't an evil man by any means.  He is shown to be
mostly a loving husband and father who is mostly looking for a better
life for himself.  We learn that his family has largely been supported
by his wife's parents and that he wants nothing more than to be able to
support his family on his own.</P>
<P>     Van Doren is shown as being an essentially good man who is seduced
by the easy fame and fortune being offered to him.  He is initially
reluctant to accept the answers and spends quite a bit of time trying
to figure out ways to justify his actions to himself.  Goodwin is also
less than perfect.  He takes a strong liking to Van Doren and clearly
doesn't care much for Stempel.  As a result, he attempts to protect Van
Doren while essentially allowing Stempel to hang himself.  In one of
the film's best written sequences, Van Doren asks Goodwin outright
whether or not he would have given into the same temptations.  Goodwin
repeatedly stammers a "no" as if he is struggling to convince himself.</P>
<P>     Even Enright and Freedman are not pure villains.  They are both
shown as being under strong directives from both the network and the
sponsor to hold on to popular contestants who generate high ratings.
On a larger scale, the shows are fixed simply because that is what the
audience demands.  They want to see the contestants that they like best
win and the producers are essentially giving them what they want.  At
one point, the sponsor (well-played by Martin Scorsese in a rare
acting role) tells Goodwin that if he succeeds in stopping the quiz
shows from being fixed that the result will be that the games will
simply become easier.  Of course, we all know that quiz shows survived
this scandal and that they *are* now much easier (witness the
popularity of "Wheel of Fortune," for example).</P>
<P>     On the surface, it might appear that Goodwin is the character we
are meant to identify with the most, but in truth the film also expects
us to recognize a bit of ourselves in Stempel and Van Doren.  Turturro
plays Stempel as a nerdy little guy whose strongest asset is his
ability to remember trivial information (often with little
comprehension).  The quiz show provides him with an opportunity for
fame and fortune but, more importantly, it provides him with some
*respect*.  Could any of us truly resist the opportunity to suddenly be
viewed as being smarter and more successful than we ever were before?</P>
<P>     As played by Fiennes, Van Doren is shown as being a true
intellectual with an upper-crust background.  He probably could have
had a great deal of success on the quiz show *without* cheating, but he
is seduced by the chance at an easy road to success.  Van Doren lives
under the shadow of his scholarly, Pulitzer-Prize-winning father
(wonderfully played by Paul Scofield).  His success on "Twenty-One"
helps him to move out of that shadow, in a sense gaining some of the
same respect that Stempel was seeking.  In the end, it is this desire
for his father's respect that makes it impossible for Van Doren to
continue to keep his secret.</P>
<P>     Goodwin essentially is the film's stand-in for the viewing
audience.  He is a fan of the quiz shows and is somewhat shocked to
learn that his trust has been betrayed.  He is also seduced by Van
Doren's charm and even becomes friends with him.  Morrow and Fiennes
play very well together and their scenes together are many of the
film's best.  Morrow plays Goodwin as a man who is somewhat trapped
between Stemple's and Van Doren's worlds.  He comes from a humble, New
York background much like Stemple's, but also likes to repeatedly point
out that he was first in his class at Harvard.  Morrow even plays the
role with a bizarre accent that seems to be a combination of Brooklyn
and Boston (unfortunately, this accent does make his dialog a bit
difficult to understand at times).</P>
<P>     Redford's direction, Michael Ballhaus' photography, and the work
of the production designers all do a great job of capturing the feel of
a simpler time period.  Everything looks right and the general
attitudes and ideas of the people on screen all seem correct.  Some of
the shock at the scandal comes from the simple fact that people were
less cynical back then.</P>
<P>     At its heart, this is really a movie about the point where mass
communications started to erode the naive trust that the public once
felt for the media.  As television has increased the flow of
information into our homes, it has also caused the public to become
more aware and less trusting. Today, most people are very aware of the
business aspects of television.  Today's quiz shows may not be
directly fixed, but most people are certainly aware of the care they
take to audition contestants to determine how they will go over with
the audience.  As the sponsor in the film suggested, they have also
been made easier.  Today's audience also tend to show a certain amount
of distrust towards other parts of television as well.  Letterman's
joke is particularly ironic since the "realism" of today's talk shows
is probably as questionable as the quiz shows shown in the film.  With
the growing influence of tabloid-style journalism, even the news has
become suspect.</P>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW provides an interesting expansion on some of the ideas
considered just last month in Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS.
Stone brought up the question of when news starts to become
sensationalism that is unworthy of reporting.  Redford's film may lead
one to question whether or not the stories being reported are even
*true*.</P>
<P>     Ironically, Redford's film itself is generating some controversy
about its accuracy.  The film fictionalizes some of the situations and
beefs up the importance of certain personalities (particularly
Goodwin).  It also narrows the story by concentrating solely on
"Twenty-One," only obliquely referencing the fact that other quiz shows
of the time were also fixed.  This bit of controversy may actually
*increase* the impact of the film.  It helps to underscore the fact
that the media frequently skews the truth to fit a specific agenda (in
this case, the alterations are largely made simply to make the film
more dramatic, entertaining, and easier to follow) and that one should
never depend completely on any one source for information</P>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW is one of the most fascinating, entertaining, and
thought-provoking films of 1994.  It is bound to generate a lot of
worthwhile discussion while also providing a simple, old-fashioned good
time at the movies.</P>
