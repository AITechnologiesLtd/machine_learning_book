<P>     What happens when you take Anton Chekhov's classic UNCLE VANYA, 
change the principles' names, and re-locate the setting to a sheep farm 
in Australia?  The result might be something called UNCLE JACK, but, 
presumably because that title lacks a certain ring, writer/director 
Michael Blakemore has chosen to name this newest re-interpretation 
COUNTRY LIFE.  Like-yet-unlike VANYA ON 42ND STREET, this version of the 
story gives a modern slant to the Russian play. </P>
<P>     At its core, COUNTRY LIFE is about lost opportunities and milking 
the most from one's lot in life.  Thrown in for good measure are themes 
of unrequited love, pacifism, and contrasts of city and country 
lifestyles.  If there was ever any doubt about the ageless quality of 
Chekhov's story, this transplant, which shifts not only country but time 
(it's 1919), should dispel such notions.  It wouldn't have taken much 
more imagination to bring it into the modern world. </P>
<P>     COUNTRY LIFE opens with the return home of celebrated author 
Alexander Voysey (Michael Blakemore) from a long sojourn in England, 
where he amassed a reputation while living off his portion of the 
proceeds from an Australian sheep farm.  That farm is run by his 
brother-in-law Jack (John Hargreaves) and daughter Sally (Kerry Fox).  
Alexander arrives down under with his young second wife, Deborah (Greta 
Scacchi), who is immediately attracted to the local doctor, Dr. Askey 
(Sam Neill). </P>
<P>     It doesn't take long before Jack discovers that Alexander is 
actually an intellectual fraud -- a self-centered, lecherous old man 
whose achievements are dubious at best.  Jack's response is unallayed 
bitterness:  he has slaved away on the farm to support a parasite.  His 
whole life, sacrificed for someone he thought to be great, has been 
wasted.  He responds to this knowledge by getting drunker than usual and 
railing against fate and Alexander. </P>
<P>     Sally, on the other hand, is quite content.  She enjoys working on 
the farm alongside her uncle, and nurses a secret affection for Dr. 
Askey.  She is plain, and harbors no hope that he might ever reciprocate 
her feelings, so she takes pains to hide them -- until Deborah offers to 
bring her case before the doctor.  The unfortunate result confirms 
Sally's opinion that this risk might not the best course.  It's odd that 
Deborah, whose single goal in life is to be cocooned in safety, is the 
catalyst for such a gamble. </P>
<P>     COUNTRY LIFE, like VANYA, ripples with repressed and unleashed 
emotions.  There's also a fair amount of humor, and these breaks of 
levity keep the film from sinking into lugubriousness.  None of the 
characters or their stories are short-changed and, by the end, there is 
a satisfying sense of closure, even though no relationship has turned 
out as it might in a Hollywood script. </P>
<P>     The most striking member of the cast is Kerry Fox (THE LAST DAYS OF 
CHEZ NOUS, SHALLOW GRAVE), who brings pathos, resignation, and good 
cheer to Sally.  Greta Scacchi is adequate as Deborah, but somehow 
doesn't seem the sort to stir the passions of three men.  Sam Neill uses 
his consummate skill to flesh out Dr. Askey.  But John Hargreaves' 
overwrought Jack suffers greatly in comparison to Wallace Shawn's fresh-
to-the-memory portrayal of the same man (in VANYA ON 42ND STREET). </P>
<P>     Taken as a whole, COUNTRY LIFE is effective, if not groundbreaking.  
Like something from Merchant-Ivory, it moves slowly, allowing the 
characters opportunity to breathe.  As either an introduction to UNCLE 
VANYA or a new take on the story, Michael Blakemore's production works, 
reaffirming that creativity can raise a phoenix from the ashes of a 
great classic. </P>
