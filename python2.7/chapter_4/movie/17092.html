Directed By Terrence Malick
Running Time: 2 hours 50 minutes</PRE>
<PRE>(20th Century Fox)</PRE>
<P>Wow, this is a toughie to review. A return to directing from Badlands
director Malick, The Thin Red Line is a movie that will delight some, and
bore the hell out of others. Myself, I was certainly leaning towards the
'delight' side. The plot, even though the film doesn't really have one,
centres around a group of American soldiers and their thoughts and feelings
fighting against the Japanese. The screenplay is mainly carried along by
voice overs of the various cast members, and suitable imagery is inserted
through to emphasise the symbolism.</P>
<P>The Thin Red Line is certainly an intriguing affair, much more intellectual
and provoking than the ridiculous trailers promise. While Fox are trying to
market this film as competition to Saving Private Ryan, by showing mainly
clips of the action sequences, The Thin Red Line is nothing like Spielbergs
effort. Although it sometimes tries a little too hard to be profound, the
makings of a truly great movie are contained inside The Thin Red Line,
unlike the typical 'Hollywoodness' that featured throughout Ryan.</P>
<P>Having never seen Malick's previous films, I was not quite sure what to
expect from a Malick movie. Thankfully, I was not disappointed. While
missing some of the interesting camera techniques Spielberg exploited well
in Ryan, Malick takes things at a much slower pace. He also likes to get his
message across, using heavy symbolism throughout to show the develop and
growth of the few principal characters. The style may be annoying to same:
you may feel patronised after the 10th close up shot of wildlife. But it's
there, and it largely works. Sometimes Malick likes to go into excess, the
first five minutes drags out a very simple point. And the incessant use of
voice overs to progress the plot may eventually grate.</P>
<P>Another criticism may be that the characters never get enough time to
develop. We _do_ get to know a few characters well, principally Ben
Chaplins, Nick Noltes and Sean Penns. All three actors are great, by the
way, with Nolte's hard assed colonel being the most enjoyable performance,
and Sean Penn and Chaplin delivering very intense performances. Considering
the minimal script they have, and the huge reliance on voice overs, the cast
have to show their emotions and feelings through their actions, and they all
do this admirable. Even the bit actors leave an impact: John Cusack and
Woody Harrelson amongst others aren't bad at all. But again the film seems
to go into excess. John Travolta and George Clooney turn up in split second
roles, and neither performance is that good. They could of been cut out, but
what would be the point in a film that seems to cherish every characters
that features?</P>
<P>Despite the overlength, the sometimes unnesscary cameos, and the rampant
symbolism, The Thin Red Line is a demanding movie that can be enjoyed.
Although the entertainment factor can't reach that of Saving Private Ryan,
the film has a huge amount to offer for the patient.</P>
