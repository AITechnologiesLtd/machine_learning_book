<PRE>                            THE NEWTON BOYS
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: Lying somewhere between a Western and
          a gangster film, THE NEWTON BOYS tells the story of
          a five-year bank-robbing spree of a family gang,
          culminating in the biggest train robbery in United
          States History.  An odd film for Richard Linklater
          to make, but entertaining, if a bit formless.  The
          film does have a good feel for 1919-1924 setting.
          Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     Neither Sifakis's ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN CRIME nor Nash's
BLOODLETTERS AND BAD MEN seems to know the Newtons existed.  What
research I tried to do before seeing the film turned up nothing.  But
the film turns up some corroborating evidence that the story must have
at the very minimum some truth.  Apparently the Newton Gang were the
most successful bank robbers in American history. From 1919 to 1925
this Texas-based gang robbed banks all over the country, eighty in all,
though their biggest job was the three-million-dollar train robbery in
Rondout, Illinois.</P>
<P>     With Andy Warhol being dead, it is hard to imagine a director less
likely to make an atmosphere-heavy period film than Richard Linklater,
director of Generation X films like SLACKER.  Nevertheless, Linklater
breaks from his mold and does a fair job of recreating America of the
early 1920s.  And ironically his Generation X serves him well when
showing members of the gang in their casual moments relaxing in
postures you would never see in a Bogart or Cagney gangster film.</P>
<P>     Willis Newton (played by Matthew McConaughey) is newly out of
prison where he was railroaded for a crime he did not commit.  What
particularly galls him is that friends and neighbors willingly perjured
themselves to abet the railroading.  He decides really to turn to
crime, stealing from the banks and implicitly from the insurance
companies who, he rationalizes, are all crooks anyway.  After helping
someone else with a daylight robbery he decides it is safer to plan his
own crimes and to rob banks only at night.</P>
<P>     Soon Willis is bringing his brothers in to assist him in his
robberies.  Realizing that he knows how to open a square-door safe but
not a round-door one, he has a bank manager list for him all the banks
he knows of that have square-door safes, a list that contains banks all
over the country.  The film takes a very whimsical look at their
crimes.  These are very clearly lucky amateurs who do not know what
they are doing, as we see in several comic scenes.  They seem to have
an incredible run of luck, neither killing anybody nor being killed
themselves.  Willis is the serious planner, brothers Jess (Ethan Hawke)
and Dock (Vincent D'Onofrio) are in it just for the wild times.  Joe
(Skeet Ulrich) is the youngest and most thoughtful of the boys.
Rounding out the gang is Glasscock (Dwight Yoakam).</P>
<P>     McConaughey clearly provides what acting interest there is in the
film and he gives the only performance that is above being just
adequate.  He is a little too handsome and polished for the role.  The
viewer knows this because of the very intelligent device of having
interviews with the real-life Joe and Willis play with the credits--in
the 1970s Willis was interviewed in a documentary and Joe appeared on
the "Tonight Show" in 1980.  The big surprise is how under-utilized
Vincent D'Onofrio is.  He is a fine actor and should have gotten a
meatier role.</P>
<P>     The story of the Newton Boys is apparently a neglected chapter of
American crime.  I cannot verify the accuracy of the film but I can say
it was entertaining.  I would rat it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low
+2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
<P>     In the film there is considerable mention square-door safes and
round-door safes.  The Newtons say they can open square-door safes but
not the round-door ones.  In order to decide what banks they will rob,
they need a list of banks with square-door safes.  What is this all
about?  Well, a square-door safe has a (rectangular) door.  It is like
the door to your home, only it is made of steel so it is a lot
stronger.  But it is still held in place by bolts and it is possible to
get behind the door and sheer the bolt, possibly by blowing the whole
door off its hinges.  A round-door safe does not have hinges.  The door
is a disk with threads around the edge.  The door is a separate piece
which screws out of the safe.  (In the 1953 WAR OF THE WORLDS the ports
on the Martian spacecraft use the same principle.  Remember Paul
Birch's line "It's the damnedest thing the way that's unscrewin'.")  In
place a round screw-in door is just as secure as any other wall of the
safe.  There is no way you can get explosive behind it.  At the time of
THE NEWTON BOYS round-door safes (usually in spherical safes called
"cannonballs") were absolutely secure.  Cannonball safes were
eventually defeated, but only by ignoring the opening mechanism and
cutting right through the wall.</P>
