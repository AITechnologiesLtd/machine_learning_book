<P>     I wanted to like EVE'S BAYOU even more than I did, for many of the
same reasons I suspect some critics have been overly effusive in their
praise.  After all, here was a film with an African-American cast in which
race was largely irrelevant to the story.  Here was a film directed by an
African-American woman, adding some much-needed pigment and estrogen to a
club even more conspicuously male than it is conspicuously white.  Here
was a first time film-maker, and a pretty decent one at that, adding the
"excitement of discovery" factor.  And here was a film which was actually
_about_ something.</P>
<P>     Kasi Lemmons' writing and directing debut certainly deserves better
than to be singled out for the race either of Lemmons or her cast.  It's a
contemplative period piece set in the Louisiana bayou of the 1960s, where
the upper-middle class Batiste family lives on the same land several 
generations have lived before.  Father Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), a genial
physician, services the community in many ways, some of them in opposition
to his marital vows; mother Roz (Lynn Whitfield) tries to ignore Louis's
indiscretions while caring for their three children.  It becomes difficult
for 10-year-old Eve (Jurnee Smollett) and her teenage sister Cicely
(Meagan Good) to ignore them, however, especially when Eve catches her
father in the act with one of his mistresses.  As Eve becomes more and
more aware of Louis's darker side, she begins to contemplate dark acts
which could change the family forever.</P>
<P>     Far from being a simple domestic drama, EVE'S BAYOU delves into the
complex subjects of memory and perception.  Events are constantly being
revisited and re-evaluated, in scenes crafted by Lemmons with a seductive
ambiguity.  In the film's finest moment, Eve's Aunt Mozelle (Debbi Morgan)
recalls a painful moment as a reflection in a mirror, moving from observer
to participant in a few short steps.  A psychic counselor haunted by the
untimely death of three husbands, Mozelle also becomes the focal point for
a subtle juxtaposition of past and future.  Though able to see the future
clearly enough, Mozelle finds herself able to interpret the past only as
the product of a "curse."  It's a lyrical and thought-provoking film
Lemmons has fashioned, in which the interpretation of events becomes ever
more challenging.</P>
<P>     Lemmons does such a fine job of introducing ideas and creating images
that the more fundamental failings of EVE'S BAYOU become all the more
disappointing.  The narrative grabs at bits and pieces of atmosphere --
period art direction, voodoo curses, French dialects -- without ever
really settling into a convincing sense of place.  Plot threads like
Mozelle's romance with a drifter artist (Lemmons' husband Vondie Curtis
Hall) are forced into five minute chunks, leaving the story feeling
slightly fragmented.  As for the much-lauded acting...well, Morgan is
certainly solid as the solemn Mozelle.  Other performances are far more
sporadic, from a nondescript Lynn Whitfield to a bug-eyed Diahann Carroll
as a cackling voodoo priestess.</P>
<P>     Make no mistake, EVE'S BAYOU is a good film:  deeply felt,
consistently intriguing and often visually striking.  It's also a
wonderful thing that a female African-American first-time film-maker has
done such impressive work.  Even adding those things together doesn't make
EVE'S BAYOU a great film, however.  Certainly I'll be looking forward to
Lemmon's next project, when that raw talent as a director and passion as a
story-teller join forces with a bit more focus and discipline.  Then it
might be time to start talking about Lemmons as an A-list director,
irrespective of race, or gender, or how many films she has made.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 blue bayous:  7.</PRE>
