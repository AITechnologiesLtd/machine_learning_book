<P>Ever seen "Beverly Hills Cop?" "48 Hours?" "Lethal Weapon?" "Rush Hour?" 
Well, if you have, in fact, seen any one of these films, then there's no 
reason to waste your time and money seeing "Blue Streak," yet another 
action/comedy (that seems strangely very old) that pairs a stock, 
wise-cracking african-american with a buddy of a different race. This 
tried-and-true formula can turn into financial gold, as proven by every one 
of the aformentioned pictures, but basically they are all the same, and "Blue 
Streak" is the most generic one yet. Sure, it is being released the exact 
same weekend that "Rush Hour" came out on last year, but it is almost devoid 
of that film's snappy writing and standout performances (from Chris Tucker 
and Jackie Chan).</P>
<P>Starting off with a typical jewel heist prologue, in which a thief, Miles 
Logan (Martin Lawrence), attempts to steal a $20-million diamond, he is 
ultimately caught when the plan goes awry, but is able to hide the highly 
valuable jewel in the ventilation shafts. Switch to two years later, Miles is 
released from prison, and immediately rebuffed by his old girlfriend (Tamala 
Jones), whom he lied to. "I thought you were a banker," she tells him. "No, a 
bank robber," he corrects her. Making his way to the location where he 
stashed the diamond, he is horrified to discover that the building is now the 
station for the LAPD. Through a sneaky series of misunderstandings on the 
police's part (including a fake badge, stolen ID, and forged paperwork), 
Miles is believed to be his alter ego, Detective Malone, and is almost 
instantly paired up with a partner, Carlson (Luke Wilson), in the robbery 
division. So as Miles must fake his way through being raised to the position 
of lead detective (something he knows nothing about), he also must find a way 
to track down the diamond, which is sure to be still lurking in the 
ventilation ducts.</P>
<P>Even if the basic premise is as old as the Rocky Mountains themselves, it can 
be done well, as long as the screenplay is witty and appropriately humorous, 
and the main actor is likable. Unfortunately, neither of these vital aspects 
hold up here. The screenplay, laughably written by three people, Michael 
Berry, John Blumenthal, amd Steve Carpenter, has nary a memorable line of 
dialogue nor one original thought in its head. Clearly aiming to be a funny 
comedy, the laughs are few and far between, and even then they cause nothing 
more than a brief giggle, only for the joke to be forgotten about five 
seconds later.</P>
<P>One thing these derivative cop comedies usually do get right is its lead 
star, but Martin Lawrence is never given the opportunity to strut his comedic 
talents (as he was in 1997's superior "Nothing to Lose"). It also doesn't 
help that his character of Miles has next to no redeeming qualities, and 
therefore, I didn't like or root for him. Miles is a thief, nothing more, and 
nowhere in the process of the film does he ever grow a conscience or realize 
he is just a low-life criminal. The plot developments in the last scene are 
especially unforgivable, as they make you question just what the point of the 
film was, and why it needed to be made in the first place.</P>
<P>All the other actors are unnecessarily wasted, and given very little to do. 
Faring the best (and a more winning presence than Lawrence) is Luke Wilson as 
his straight-arrow partner, Carlson. Wilson, previously seen in 1998's "Home 
Fries" and "Rushmore," is an up-and-coming performer who hopefully will go on 
to better, more established, film roles, rather than waste his time playing 
second fiddle to the zany likes of Lawrence. The lack of any true female 
characters is also disappointing. Tamala Jones (1997's hilarious "Booty 
Call") disappears after one scene near the beginning, while Nicole Ari Parker 
(1998's "Boogie Nights"), in a throwaway 5-minute role as a public defender, 
could have easily been further developed and have become a possible love 
interest for Lawrence. It sure needed something because, as is, the film has 
only one story (with absolutely no subplots), and is utterly empty and 
unsatisfying because of this.</P>
<P>A comedy without the laughs, and an action film with a non-existent level of 
excitement, "Blue Streak" is an obvious and misguided effort, with an 
inauspicious directing job by Les Mayfield. No technical attributes are worth 
mentioning either, as everything about the film, right down to the smallest 
detail, is nearly as cliched as a "Friday the 13th" movie, and as forgettable 
as an early-afternoon dream. What was the film's title again? Oh yeah, "Blue 
Streak." I better write that down before I forget it.</P>
