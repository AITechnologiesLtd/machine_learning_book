<PRE>                              SECRETS & LIES
                       A film review by John Bauer
                        Copyright 1997 John Bauer</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>Not since attending an Ingmar Bergman retrospective a few years ago
have I seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional
truth as SECRETS & LIES.  Like Bergman, director Mike Leigh is
interested in probing his characters' inner depths through
hypernaturally blunt confrontations.  Also like Bergman, Leigh engages
in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces.
And the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls
Bergman's own use of a Bach cello suite in an earlier film.  All that
is missing is a discussion of God.</P>
<P>Which is not to say that SECRETS & LIES is nothing more than an homage
to the Swedish master.  In fact, it is quite possible Leigh had no such
intentions in mind.  Nonetheless, what we get is so far removed from
the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the
movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the
film's rhythms.  Once the adjustment is made, however, there are great
rewards.</P>
<P>One such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is.
Though Leigh may have adopted some of Bergman's stylistic touches, most
obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married
couple's strained conversation, as well as in that somewhat obtrusive
score, the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "style"
at all.  Whereas Bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality,
Leigh makes the camera a mere observer, almost as in a PBS
documentary.</P>
<P>The effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors.  It
is a tribute to everyone involved that, despite such scrutiny, only
infrequently are we aware that anyone *is* acting.  Much has been made
of Brenda Blethyn's performance, and rightly so, but it is only when
you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize
how good she is.</P>
<P>There are a few missteps.  For one, except for one scene (tragicomic,
as it happens), there is scant humor in the film.  This leads to a
certain monotonous tone throughout.  And occasionally (as with Bergman)
the bluntness of the situations can seem forced.  For all that, this
longish film manages to keep hold of your attention.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that the audience for SECRETS & LIES will most likely
be limited to an intellectual elite, for there is nothing inherently
intellectual about this film.  In fact, it might easily resonate more
strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never
see it.  There is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's
unspoken take on race relations, something an American audience at
least would do well to observe.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, SECRETS & LIES is not for the faint of heart.  Though
there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish, the
exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it
is tempting to turn from the screen.  Needless to say, it is also very
depressing at times.  But for many of us, of course, so is life.  And
though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending, that
same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better.</P>
