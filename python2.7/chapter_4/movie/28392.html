<P>Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) 83m.</P>
<P>One of those rare things: A movie that is as good as its title.  However, 
such is its fame that first-time viewers may be expecting more than it can 
deliver.  The first time I saw it was at a double-bill with UP! which played 
to half a dozen people.  My second viewing, a few years later, was at a film 
festival with a full house.  What a difference an audience makes!</P>
<P>Russ Meyer's drive-in classic had considerable impact on many viewers back 
in '65 (among them cult director John Waters) but didn't get a stronger 
international presence until the early 80s, when cinema buffs who had seen 
B-Grade and Z-Grade films as youngsters began championing their favorite 
films in print.  What Meyer did to make his film so memorable was to 
transfer the film-making sensibilities he had developed in his earlier 
exploitation films to the limitations of commercial cinema, reshaping the 
B-movie and introducing his independent streak to new audiences.  As well as 
disregarding the conventions of studio pictures he also abandoned many of 
his own trademarks, among them flashbacks, flash-forwards, rapid 
intercutting, wraparound narration and fetishistic inserts of props.  
Perversely, the removal of nudity and sex - one of Meyer's most obvious 
selling points - gave the film-makers greater freedom, not less: without the 
distraction of obligatory flesh scenes Meyer and co-writer Jack Moran were 
able to keep the events on screen in service of the story.</P>
<P>In a gender reversal of Meyer's previous film MOTOR PSYCHO, PUSSYCAT opens 
with three free-spirited go-go dancers speeding their sports cars along a 
desert road (this image seems to endorse the film's title from the outset) 
where they meet a young couple performing time trials on a makeshift 
racetrack.  Varla, the leader of the trio (the role that established Tura 
Satana's place in cult history) provokes the boyfriend of petite, 
Gidget-like Susan Bernard into a fight which turns ugly.  The gals flee the 
racetrack, taking Bernard with them, only to find themselves on the property 
of a misanthropic old man and his two sons.  The rest of the film is a rondo 
of lechery, betrayals, bitching and plotting, as the volatile personalities 
of the assorted players all strive to outfox each other.</P>
<P>It's the women of PUSSYCAT (Satana, Lori Williams and Meyer regular Haji) 
that provide the basis for its fan following - they are assertive, brash, 
sexually uninhibited and as tough as nails, and in a post-1966 climate of 
political correctness they celebrate all that is 'right' about being 
'wrong'.  Satana steals the show as the constantly vicious, karate-chopping 
Varla, but interestingly, the more vulnerable Bernard is equally as 
memorable.  Dwarfed by the three Amazons that have abducted her, Bernard is 
convincing in a role that requires her to be constantly traumatized.  She 
also provides the film with its time element: everything is contingent upon 
an escape from what has become her nightmare.  Her attempts to run and 
reason her way out meet with failure each time, and only by confronting the 
story's 'monster' head on is she able to bring her ordeal to an end.</P>
<P>There's more to the central casting of PUSSYCAT than the attributes of its 
leading ladies, however - Meyer knew that he would be able to get away with 
much more in the story if he made the 'car club' female.  Consider the 
alternative response if it had been a male trio that had kidnapped the 
small, defenseless Bernard and put her through hell.  In fact, it's all 
something of a con: apart from a couple of seduction scenes, the women's 
roles in PUSSYCAT could be switched to men's with hardly any change of 
dialogue (in much the same way that Sigourney Weaver's role in ALIEN was 
originally written for a male lead).  To enforce the strength of the women, 
Meyer emasculates the men in the film by making them witless, bookish and 
disabled; furthermore the women kill and maim in distinctly male/phallic 
ways (using knives and cars) and all but one of the murders in the film are 
committed by women.  And then of course, there's that dialogue, made up 
almost entirely of double entendres and vicious putdowns - the dinner table 
scene is more shamelessly smutty than any other mealtime gathering you're 
likely to have seen.  In spite of all this, PUSSYCAT never come across as 
sleazy - at no point do you feel uncomfortably exposed to a low-rent 
exploitation flick.  Instead PUSSYCAT looks like a B-movie that somehow 
slipped sideways into cinemas through a crack that nobody had noticed at the 
time.  That opening has since sealed itself shut, so we can count ourselves 
fortunate that films like this live on to be viewed today.</P>
