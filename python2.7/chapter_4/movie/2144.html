<PRE>                              DAZED AND CONFUSED
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jason London, Wiley Wiggins, Rory Cochrane, Adam
Goldberg, Anthony Rapp.
Screenplay/Director:  Richard Linklater.</P>
<P>     I have this sneaking suspicion that the extent to which viewers
can appreciate DAZED AND CONFUSED may be limited by how readily they
recognize it as a perfect capsule of mid-70s youth culture.  It's a
clever and completely un-self-conscious portrait of pot-smoking,
beer-drinking teenagers revelling in the awareness that right now,
nothing else really matters.  As frequently as people tend to toss out
comparisons between films, I think I can safely say that what AMERICAN
GRAFFITI was to 1962, DAZED AND CONFUSED is to 1976.</P>
<P>     Like AMERICAN GRAFFITI, DAZED AND CONFUSED takes place entirely in
one 24-hour period, the last day of school of 1976, and follows several
students episodically.  Randy "Pink" Floyd (Jason London), the starting
quarterback, is struggling with whether or not to sign the anti-drug
pledge required by his coach.  Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) is an incoming
freshman trying to escape the traditional hazing inflicted by sadistic
seniors like O'Bannon (Ben Affleck).  Mike (Adam Goldberg), Tony
(Anthony Rapp) and Cynthia (Marissa Ribisi) are nerdy school
newspaper-types philosophizing about the pointlessness of their lives.
And Slater (Rory Cochrane) is simply on an endless search for good
weed.  Their one collective goal for the evening:  to find a good
party.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Richard Linklater's first feature was SLACKER, a
quirky but gimmicky look at apathetic twenty-somethings that established
his talent for creating unique and amusing characters.  In DAZED AND
CONFUSED, he takes a look at the proto-SLACKER, with delightful
results.  While many of the characters are recognizable high school
types, what I found original was that these were types I actually
recognized from high school, not from *movies* about high school.  Cool
but basically decent Randy interacts convincingly with both his jock
buddies and the inexperienced Mitch.  O'Bannon is the classic high
school jerk, arbitrarily feigning a punch at someone walking by him in
the hall.  Tony is the nice guy/geek who timidly tries to impress a
cute freshman (the appealing Christina Hinojosa).  My personal favorite
was Wooderson (Matthew McConnagher), a slimy college-ager who hangs
around with high schoolers to remain king of the hill and to pick up
high school girls.  Linklater gives them sparkling dialogue, daring to
let his characters talk like teenagers actually talk.  The one major
character failing in DAZED is the absence of any equally interesting
female characters; many could be interchangeable.  This is a male
coming-of-age film first and foremost, but it could have been more
inclusive.</P>
<P>     As a film without a real plot, DAZED depends on set pieces and
atmosphere.  The success of the former is hit and miss.  There's a fun
chase as several junior high schoolers run for their lives from the
hazing-happy seniors-to-be.  The hazing of the junior high girls is
lively, as is a wacky monologue by the stoned Slater about George and
Martha Washington's fondness for marijuana.  However, there's a fair
amount of dead space, and it's left to the cast of unknowns to fill
it.  They are generally personable enough to do so, particularly
Wiggins and Cochrane, but not always.</P>
<P>     As for atmosphere, it's dead on.  DAZED captures 1976 brilliantly,
from the bell bottoms and feathered hair to the soundtrack of early
hard rock classics to a pair of statues painted to look like members of
KISS.  The drug and alcohol use is matter-of-fact, free of
anachronistic moralizing.  The production design had to be perfect, and
it is.  Anyone who can't quite recall a time when sex was safe and far
fewer kids "just said no" should take a look just for the sake of
historical accuracy.</P>
<P>     It's impossible for me to determine whether those not in my age
bracket will be as enamored of DAZED AND CONFUSED as I was.  It's a
slight, loopy little film with no pretensions, and it was a page right
out of my own youth.  I don't know ... maybe you had to be there.</P>
<PRE>     Of course, *I* didn't inhale.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 joints:  7.</PRE>
