<PRE>                        MISSISSIPPI MASALA
                A film review by Sunil Ramchandani
                 Copyright 1992 Sunil Ramchandani</PRE>
<P>Starring Denzel Washington, Sarita Choudhury, Roshan Seth,
         Sharmila Tagore, and Charles Dutton
Directed by: Mira Nair
Music: L. Subramanium</P>
<PRE>                   An Appealing Montage of Colors 
                   ------------------------------</PRE>
<P>     To call Mira Nair's latest film a heavy handed social commentary, 
would, in my opinion, be doing great injustice to this lady and her
film.  A message it does carry, but that is definitely not the intent of
the film.  For if it were, then the whole premise is wrong, the
situations are uncalled for, and the characters are too cliched.  This
is a very unpretentious, earthy, and simplistic collage of varied
characters.</P>
<P>     The main protagonist of the film Jai (Roshan Seth) is an Indian (as
in from India) African, very idealistic by nature, who forever harbors
dreams of his native homeland--Uganda, after being expelled (along with
all the Indian expatriates) from there in 1972.  Normally, it would be
easy to dismiss Jai off as a hypocrite.  But hypocrite he is not, rather
a man with good intentions, albeit his hard experiences have embittered
him to the point of being detestful of the black-skinned.  Still, is he
really that resentful of the black race?  No, rather it is just an
outlet to vent his frustrations, for he was after all a victim of
circumstances beyond his control.</P>
<P>     It is really this feeling which comes into play after he hears
about the relationship of his only daughter and child Mina (Sarita
Choudhury) with the local carpet cleaner Dimitrius (Denzel Washington),
even though he rationalizes to Washington otherwise.  Drawing upon his
own experiences he tries to explain to Washington, why he is not willing
to let his daughter go through similar situations he experienced as one
of the minority when in Uganda.  </P>
<P>     His realization is late in coming, though nonetheless is very
welcome, and in a scene remarkably done as he embraces a black African
baby while watching a dance in a street square in Kampala, Uganda.  The
whole scene is so much significant of the world as it is today, a world
in transition, a much closer and smaller world.</P>
<P>     The movie on the whole is very appealing and entertaining.  The
smalltown ambience of Greenwood definitely adds to the unique flavor.
Also the characters of the Indian motel owners albeit cliched, add good
humor to a movie which in any case has a strong undercurrent of being
funny.  </P>
<P>     Of the cast, both Choudhury and Washington are a match made for
each other.  The chemistry between them is terrific, the scenes
involving them have a spontaneity and freshness erstwhile seldom
witnessed.  As proof, you have a scene where they are taking a walk in
the scenic environs of Greenwood, when he very hesitantly asks if he
could kiss her.  The whole shot is so well handled, it is very difficult
not to break out into a smile.  Kinu (played by Sharmila Tagore) as the
mother is very adequate,she appears emotionally distraught and very
vulnerable for most part, a typical Indian wife would best characterize
her role.  Charles Dutton (from the Fox TV show ROC) is delightful in
a cameo as Tyronne--business partner of Washington.  Of the Indian
cast, Anil (Ranjit Chowdhury) as the motel owner, and his friend Pontiac
(Mohan Gokhale) are brilliant.  And finally Roshan Seth who seems very
effective as the morose and yet hopeful Jai still pining for his
homeland.  If you've seen GANDHI, you'd recognize Roshan Seth (plays the
role of Nehru) as a terrific actor.</P>
<P>     The film does include some breathtaking shots of the countryside in
Kampala, the green rolling hills, and Lake Victoria (?) as seen from
Jai's house.  In her second major attempt after SALAAM BOMBAY Mira
Nair maintains her effort, not superlative, but good nonetheless.  In
any case this Harvard film school product seems destined to go places.
Her next motion picture which she is doing for Warner Bros. is about
the life of Buddha.  </P>
<P>     I recommend this film unequivocally; you'll leave the movie theater
with a smile.  As Sarita tells Denzel in one of the scenes from the
film, that she is essentially a 'Masala' (mixture of spices) having
lived in different countries and having experienced different cultures,
this film is also loaded with all the Masala for an evening of
entertainment.</P>
