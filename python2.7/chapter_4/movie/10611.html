<P>     FALLEN proves that if you want to evoke millennial dread, you can't
just flirt with it -- you've got to embrace it.  The supernatural thriller
stars Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, a Philadelphia homicide detective
whose greatest success -- the capture and subsequent execution of serial
killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) -- is about to turn into his greatest
challenge.  It seems that a copycat is on the loose, committing murders
with Reese's m.o. and leaving teasing clues for Hobbes.  Is the new killer
a former accomplice of Reese?  Is a rogue cop involved?  Or is the truth
even more sinister, that the same dark spirit which drove Reese to kill
can migrate to other human hosts?</P>
<P>     Along to help answer those questions are John Goodman as Hobbes'
loyal partner, Donald Sutherland as his uptight lieutenant and Embeth
Davidtz as a theology professor.  All are talented performers who acquit
themselves admirably, but not not a one of them has much to work with in
Nicholas Kazan's script.  The dialogue is certainly effective,
particularly in its laconic familiarity of co-worker and familial
interaction.  The story simply doesn't create a single compelling
character to anchor the narrative.  That includes Hobbes, who remains a
vaguely heroic cipher despite the work of consummate professional
Washington.  In fact, the only real spark of personality comes from the
film's body-hopping villain, who occupies so many different characters
that he provides more of a menacing general presence than a specific
personality.</P>
<P>     Consequently, FALLEN becomes a thriller almost entirely of situation,
that situation being the threat of a malevolent eternal entity.  While
Gregory Hoblit puts together a few unique and creepy moments, including a
chase through a busy city street which becomes a psychic relay race, his
approach to the material is disappointingly conventional.  His tone is
that of a slightly-gloomier-than-average crime drama, with filtered
point-of-view shots used and over-used ass the only distinctive signal of
a demonic presence.  In short, it's just not all that disturbing, or even
particularly creative in its approach to the subject of demons walking
among us.  Isolated moments build effective tension, but Hoblit and Kazan
ultimately resort to the kind of obligatory "gotcha" climax which can
leave an audience with the faint aftertaste of cleverness despite a
general lack of substance.  Like Hoblit's PRIMAL FEAR, FALLEN is a
well-made and well-acted film which too often settles for the easy or
obvious way to handle a situation.  When that situation involves the
vengeful soul of an ageless fallen angel, you should hope for a bit more
than gunplay and the crooning of Rolling Stones tunes.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fallen angles:  5.</PRE>
