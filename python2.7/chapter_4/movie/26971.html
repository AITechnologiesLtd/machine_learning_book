<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a creaky horror film, with plenty of fun moments in its wobbly
story. It's a remake of Tod Browning's silent "London After Midnight,"
which starred Lon Chaney in dual roles as Professor Zelen and Count
Mora. It is played mostly as a spoof on vampires, but has a nifty murder
mystery going for it, plus some gimmicky camera work featuring an
apparition and the scary dark castle filled with strange sounds,
cobwebs, spiders, bats, and rodents.</P>
<P>When Sir Karell Borotyn is found murdered in this remote Czechoslovakian
village with the two marks of a vampire on his neck and his blood
drained, the skeptical Inspector Neumann (Atwill) investigates the crime
and tells the frightened Dr. Doskil (Meek) to find the real cause of
death, not to tell him about this vampire nonsense. When the doctor
can't, still believing the superstitions that persist in the village,
the inspector calls for help from Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore), a
specialist in the occult.</P>
<P>The professor and the inspector are baffled by the case as a year passes
with no results, and decide to try a radical plan by hiring vaudeville
performers, Count Mora (Bela Lugosi), and his daughter Luna (Carol
Borland), to act as vampires and smoke the real murderer out. Luna is a
chalky-faced apparition and Lugosi plays a vampire. He tries to steal
the picture by hamming it up, even though he only has one line in the
film. But the biggest ham is Barrymore, he makes every line into a
stage-like performance.</P>
<P>The inspector questions everyone in Sir Karell Borotyn's castle, after
he had been murdered. He learns that Karell's pretty daughter Irena
(Allan) is to marry within two weeks Count Feodor Vincenty (Wadsworth),
someone not of the same wealth and status as she is. He also learns that
in case of Karell's death, his closest friend Baron Otto von Zinden
(Jean Hersholt), is to be the executor of the estate. The servants Jan
and Maria are also questioned and are asked to look after Irena, who
fears the vampires are going to attack. The servants are ordered to put
bat-thistles in all the rooms as a deterrent to the vampires who only
come out at night.</P>
<P>This amusing B&W film, with photography by James Wong Howe, captures the
eerie atmosphere befitting a horror film. It's a classic horror spoof,
well worth seeing for either nostalgia purposes or lighthearted fun.</P>
