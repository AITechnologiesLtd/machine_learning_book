<PRE>Grade: A+</PRE>
<P>    A flawless masterpiece. "Twelve Angry Men" tells the story of one juror
(Fonda) and his attempt to convince 11 others, that a young man should not be
executed for a crime he might not have committed. The 11 jurors are positive
that the boy is guilty of killing his father from the evidence given during the
trial, but Fonda, in a truly believable and inspirational performance, explains
to the men that there are two sides to every story. This ambiguity creates a
creepy and thought provoking plot. If the jurors decide he's not guilty, they
could have let a cold blooded killer out on the streets of New York again. If
they decide he is guilty, the jurors could ruin an innocent boy's life. Fonda
never says that the boy is not guilty, he just states that there is a
possibility he is not guilty and he reminds the men that there decision can
determine a man's entire future. No matter what the outcome of the verdict is,
the truth is never given to the audience or to the desperate, tired jurors.</P>
<P>       Filmed in one room on a hot day in New York City, "12 Angry Men" begins
with very little information but as the film progresses the superb script
addresses every detail of the trial, each jurors background, and the tensions
and differences
between them. The focus is not on a few characters but rather on all the
characters in the movie. All twelve jurors are examined from every angle
including whether they wear glasses or not or their employment status. The
convicted boy is shown in a silent, poignant shot in which he begs the jurors
not to stereo type him. This innocent face must have provoked Fonda to attempt
to dig deeper into the murder. Even the security guard who guards the room
which holds the jurors is given a purpose. When he gives the twelve angry men
the murder weapon which they requested to inspect, he briefly looks back at the
room and, with his facial expressions, asks what is taking so long and why
haven't you figured out the obvious conclusion that he is guilty. The guard
represents the world outside the court room. He is similar to the 11 other
jurors besides Fonda in that he immediately made his decision based on the
background of the young boy.</P>
<P>"Twelve Angry Men" challenges the way court systems function by raising an
issue of prejudice in which some of the men believe the boy is guilty only
because someone like him had caused grief in their lives or because the
neighborhood he was brought up in must have influenced him into becoming a cold
blooded killer. What is frightening about 12 Angry Men is that the men,
nameless and only
referred to as juror # _, could easily represent any person in our
society including ourselves, even if they are all white males. </P>
