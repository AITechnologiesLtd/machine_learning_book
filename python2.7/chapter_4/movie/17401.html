<P>We squirm nervously as we watch Scottie desperately try to re-create
Madeleine through Judy in Hitchcock's Vertigo. There is something
discomforting about the futility of trying to extract a dead lover from a
stranger. While Scottie's actions can be interpreted as being necrophilic,
our uneasiness with the sequence is a result of something less
psychoanalytical - we empathize with Scottie's pain due to the fact that we
also are no longer attracted to Judy. The reason for this is in itself
disturbing. From the moment Hitchcock reveals to us that Judy is Madeleine,
we realize that what captivated us, enchanted us, was the product of an
actress who lives in a third-class hotel. We can no longer love Madeleine
because we now know that she is poor and has even been `picked up before.'
Hitchcock creates  an important subplot in Vertigo, suggesting that love
cannot transcend barriers of social strata. Though some viewers may find
Judy to be a submissive character, easily yielding to Scottie's attempts to
change her appearance, there is also strength inside her to remain true to
her modest life. She does not run away from her drab furnishings and move in
with Scottie, though she can. She does not reprise the role of Madeleine,
with all the breathless charm and elegance, though she can. Instead, she
wants Scottie to love her for who she is, and it becomes a futile and fatal
effort. Because she is a good actor, Judy has ability to dictate the
situation she is in and possibly even craft a happy ending if she was to
completely subjugate herself to Scottie's desires. But she doesn't and with
every return we make into her spartan apartment we a reminded of her poverty
and the further we drift from our dream and image of Madeleine. Through Judy
's acting, or the lack of acting in the latter half of the movie, Hitchcock
prompts us to look at how we see people and how we judge them by their
superficies.</P>
<P>Aside from Scottie's project to mold Judy into Madeleine, Hitchcock also
presents us with how Scottie treats Judy differently merely on the basis
that she is not Madeleine. We are presented with two, parallel scenes – one
at Ernie's and one at Scottie's apartment in which we can see that Judy is
treated differently. When Scottie first sees Madeleine at Ernie's, she is
dressed in a beautiful green dress that stands out from the colorless attire
of other patrons. Scottie is captivated by her presence. While certainly
part of this is to accentuate Madeleine's beauty and make her stand out from
the crowd, it is interesting that when the two return to the restaurant
later in the movie with Judy as herself, Judy once again is the only person
who wears color. This time, however, Scotties attention turns to the
Madeleine look alike dressed in gray. Hitchcock in both scenes have
Judy/Madeleine as the only patrons that are dressed in color, which is
symbolic of the fact that they are one and alike. By having Scottie's gaze
turn towards the more affluent `Madeleine' even though the real Madeleine is
sitting across from him at the table is our first clue that it may not only
be hair color that is differentiating the two; that is, their different
positions in the social strata supersedes Judy's inherent character.</P>
<P>In the other parallel scene, we see Scottie prompting Judy to sit down in
front of his fireplace after convincing Judy to color her hair. This scene
is a reflection of when Madeleine sits down in front of Scottie's fireplace
to dry off after falling into the bay. The overt difference is that Scottie
is far less interested in conversation with Judy than with Madeleine. What
is disturbing is the fact that Scottie refuses to treat Judy with the same
respect as Madeleine until she can be like her. Madeleine is invited in
front of the fireplace, as Scottie offers her two cushions. However, as
Judy, she is only offered one cushion, and seemingly as an afterthought at
that. We are provoked by this discrepancy in Scottie's manner to question
why Judy is only one cushion worthy. Because there is a seemingly
intentional duplication of the scenes - both showing an insert shot of the
cushions on the ground, the discrepancy in the cushion count is unlikely a
simple anomaly. Rather, once again, Hitchcock subtly indicates the
incongruity that the same character is treated, with the only difference
between Madeleine and Judy being one of class.</P>
<P> It is important to examine not only how Judy acts but how she doesn't act.
When Judy is Madeleine, she is thoroughly convincing as the rich man's wife.
Not only does she act mysteriously, her technique – the manner in which she
talks, walks, and gestures all authentically epitomize Madeleine's
affluence. As Judy, however, she does not undertake this subterfuge.
Examining Madeleine's speech at Scottie's apartment we see that she speaks
in a breathless, seductive voice. Every phrase is met with a rise in her
eyebrows and a pull of her chin. Even when not speaking, Madeleine's lips
are always parted, as if perpetually awaiting a kiss. As a contrast, Judy's
voice is far less indiscrete, or as Jay Gatsby would say, a voice `full of
money.' Her lips are drawn, and Judy is much less sexual than Madeleine. Why
Hitchcock makes this contrast between Judy as Madeleine and Judy as herself
is important as to how we see Judy's acting. It can be assumed that Judy
never met the real Madeleine; though Gavin Elster may have provided Judy
some cursory instructions on how to act as Madeleine, it should be accepted
that Judy creates the character of Madeleine from her own schemata of how
someone rich and beautiful such as Madeleine should act. Therefore, it is
important to realize that while Judy is fully capable in transcending her
humble stock to take on the role of Madeleine, she does not repossess the
grace nor elegance of Madeleine as Judy. Because Hitchcock spends a great
deal shooting at Judy's apartment rather than Scottie's, this combined with
Judy's insistence to be her true self to Scottie becomes an important test
for both Scottie and the audience. Do we treat people differently because of
their social class? Judy's Madeleine is not a portrayal of the real
Madeleine – it is the product of Judy's acting. Thus difference between the
two is entirely superficial, yet Scottie can only be in love with the
character Judy creates and not who she is. Judy's insistence to not act as
Madeleine in the latter half of the movie becomes not only a testament to
Judy's intrinsic strength, but Scottie's moral weakness.</P>
<P>Near the end of Vertigo, there is a scene where Judy is physically
metamorphosed into Madeleine. Once again, it is made clear that though Judy
may physically appear as Madeleine, the quivering of Judy's lips as she
visibly strains for Scottie's approval gives her away as Judy. Coming out of
the bathroom and before Judy walks towards Scottie, Judy stands for a moment
in front of the green neon sign in front of her window. The shot of her in
front of the green neon, part of Judy's hotel, is so powerful that it
immerses Judy in its green light, giving Judy a very ethereal quality. Under
the theme of affluence and class, one should examine the use of the color
green in the movie. Hitchcock has said that green is the color of ghosts,
and in such a sense our first shots of Madeleine and Judy both in green
clothes may suugest the Judy – Madeleine duplicity. Along this line, one can
easily see the richness of the scene in which Judy, doused in a green neon
flame not only literally appears like a ghost, but also alludes to the fact
that Madeleine, who Judy is now dressed like, is also a ghost. Though this
is the intent of the scene on one level, the color green also possesses a
second meaning. Green is also a color of wealth and prosperity. The green
Jaguar that Madeleine drives is an explicit example; British green has long
been a color associated exclusively with luxury automobiles. Even today, we
find green a prevalent choice in expensive automobiles while not on
subcompacts. Though perhaps a bit trite, green is the color of money, and
subsequently, the color of our desires. In Vertigo, however, green can also
serve as reminder of the absence of fortune. Unlike Gatsby's yearning for
the green light at Daisy's dock, Judy's green light is one that reads
`Empire Hotel.' This neon, which silhouettes Judy in one scene and engulfs
her in another serves as a garish reminder that this is no longer the Judy
that drives a Jaguar; this is the Judy that lives in a third-class hotel. By
having Judy separated from Scottie by the vulgar green neon, we see that it
is the wealth absent in Judy that ultimately alienates Scottie from her; the
constant reminder of Judy's poverty is powerful enough to overcome her
appearance as Madeleine.</P>
<P>If Judy's struggle for identity is characterized by her unwillingness to
reprise her role of Madeleine, then it is very possible in the scene that
follows the orgasmic physical metamorphosis Judy plays out a final,
desperate act. One should recall that Judy had originally intended to
divulge Elster's plan; however, Judy tears the confessional not to protect
Gavin, but as an attempt to make Scottie fall in love with herself, not
Madeleine. But things go awry and Judy sees that Scottie is obsessed with
Madeleine. For someone who so close came to a disclosure earlier, wouldn't
as an act of desperation, would Judy feel inclined to confess herself as
Madeleine? I believe she does in the scene when she puts on Carlotta's
necklace. Though it may seem her decision to put on the necklace that night
was a grand slip on Judy's part, I would suggest it is her final performance
as an actress – a desperate move to tell Scottie that she was Madeleine.
Though she acts as though putting on the necklace is a casual affair, this
is the first time we see Judy wearing a black dress. The necklace, then,
even without Hitchcock's insert shot, would become the centerpiece of her
ensemble. Furthermore, Judy prompts Scottie to clasp Carlotta's necklace for
her, drawing more attention to the jewelry. As Scottie works the clasp from
behind Judy, she faces towards the mirror, almost inviting attention to the
necklace. Finally, when Scottie asks, `How do you work this thing?' Judy
responds, `Can't you see?' Judy's line, though on the surface directed at
the logistics of the clasp, is at the same time Judy's confession of her
crime and a revelation of her identity. `Can't you see that I'm wearing
Carlotta's necklace?' `Can't you see that I am Madeleine?' It would be too
irresponsible if Judy pulled out her most expensive piece of jewelry without
remembering its significance. Rather, in her last heartfelt acting job, she
shows Scottie what he wants to see in hopes that he can finally love her for
being Judy. Sadly, her hopes for a silent reconciliation are met with
Scottie's contempt, for he is now faced to confront the fact that Judy will
never play the role of Madeleine again.</P>
<P>humble girl is given the role of a lifetime in Vertigo. Like a starlet who
peaks too soon, Judy becomes haunted by her single, solitary role. In her
decision not to recapitulate her role as Madeleine, she becomes unable to
transcend her tawdry life to become the affluent ghost Scottie is in love
with. Hitchcock poses an important question for the audience of  Vertigo –
Why can't we fall in love with the same woman? It would seem the fact that
Judy is Madeleine would draw us closer to her, yet ironically, our knowledge
of her humble stock seems to extinguish our desire for her altogether. For
what is the inherent difference between Madeleine and Judy? Though both
characters are played by the same woman, the division between Madeleine and
Judy is one of social status. In Vertigo, as we frustratingly watch Judy
refuse to become Madeleine, Hitchcock prompts us to confront our own
fixations with superficiality and status.</P>
