<PRE>Kings Rhapsody (1955)</PRE>
<P>Pure escapism, set in a rarified, if rusty 'Ruritanian' world that only Ivor
Novello could create. The story has echoes not only of the romance between
King Carol of Rumania and actress Magda Lupescu, but also the of 1930s
cause
celebre, the abdication of King Edward VIII over Mrs. Simpson, which perhaps
accounted for its popularity on the West End stage at the Palace Theatre in
1949 (when it ran for 839 performances). Errol Flynn plays King Nikki of
"Murania" who has been living in exile with his love, Marta Karillos (Anna
Neagle). His then(real life) wife Patrice Wymore plays the 'Snow Princess'
Christiane of Norseland who is looking for love. When she first runs down an
Elstree studio snowscape wearing a pale blue fur lined frock and sings "Some
Day My Heart Will Awake" , one knows I think that suspension of disbelief is
required.
The musical numbers include: Some Day My Heart will Awake (Patrice
Wymore);
Take Your Girl (Orchestra/Chorus);The Years Together (Anna Neagle);
The Gates of Paradise (Anna Neagle/Chorus)
If This Were Love (Patrice Wymore, Edmund Hockridge, Chorus);
A Violin Began To Play (Patrice Wymore/Chorus) and Coronation Scene
and Finale (Orchestra/Chorus)
Although some songs are left out and others are reduced in length to one
chorus/verse and thus shortened from stage version, there is still a lot of
music in the film, as Novello's melodies are used in some masterful
underscoring by Robert Farnon. There are some nice choral arrangements too,
and much ceremonial music- for processionals, royal weddings, parades,
coronations and the like. 'Kings Rhapsody features dance music prominently,
from folk dances ('Muranian Rhapsody') to a modern dance dream/nightmare
ballet featuring the princess (Wymore) and a group of uncredited male
dancers wearing face masks on the back of their heads, but young Lionel
Blair is clearly recognisable.
By 1955, Errol Flynn's Hollywood star quality was in descent, and he was
working in modestly budgeted films in England. I suppose it is a sign of a
star that they have an aura about them, and viewers cannot take their eyes
off of them whilst they are on the screen. In this film, although is
performance is rather on the lazy side, Flynn retains much of his old charm,
has true star quality, and is compulsively watchable, from his entrance in a
drunk scene (surprise.......)
'Kings Rhapsody' is however, clumsily shot - camera setups are frequently
dull and unimaginative, and the film is decidedly sluggish in parts with the
static shots and long takes typical of early CinemaScope movies. The
lighting in some scenes is also very odd, with pink hues, whick give a tacky
look , and the (at times) weak 1950s Eastman Colour doesn't do the film any
favours. The films opens in Monte Carlo, and is set in Royal palaces and
spectacular scenery, which is also rather poorly photographed: it looks as
if some of the location shots were brought in from a travelogue/another
source- perhaps evidence of a budgetary problems with this film: it really
neeed big US money to give the lavish look required. Working with very
limited resources, Herbert Wilcox has tried to produce a 'lavish' musical,
but the cracks do show, particularly in the location photography and the art
direction. However, the sound is quite lively for 1955, with what seems to
be stereophonic , or at least 'perspecta' (directional ) sound. This MAY be
the first British Musical film recorded with a magnetic stereophonic
soundtrack. On the print viewed, the orchestral playing has presence and
bite, and some really loud sound effects (gunshots etc.). But, the sound in
some studio dialogue scenes in the early part of the film is reminiscent of
early sound films, with every rustle of clothing and footstep
over-amplified....(!)
The whole film is quite preposterous of couse, and you either surrender to
the piece or dismiss it. Take the ending which is kitsch of the highest
order, and which is brought off very well by the director to tug at the
emotions, in syncronisation with Novello's glorious music. As his young son
is crowned, Rikki is in the Cathedral, hiding in the shadows, After the
service Nikki goes alone to the altar to pray as , unseen to him,
Christiane, his Snow Princess appears in the RH side of the frame. If you
have surrendered to this story, there will not be a dry eye in the house at
this moment - which is just how Novello would have wanted it, as THE END
comes up on the screen..........
