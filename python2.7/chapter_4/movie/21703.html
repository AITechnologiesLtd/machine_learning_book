PG-13</P>
<P>In 1925, Buster Keaton directed and starred in the silent classic 
"Seven Chances," which was itself based on an eponymous play. It was, 
and still is, a riot.</P>
<P>"The Bachelor" is a remake-update of Keaton's comedy/farce. The 
director, is the Brit Gary Sinyor, whose feature debut was the 
amusing, Jewish-themed comedy "Leon the Pig Farmer" (1992), a work 
modestly distributed, hence seen in specialized venues such as 
festivals. Sinyor made two more films which, to my knowledge, have 
been seen by even smaller audiences. "The Bachelor," if there's any 
justice, ought to meet with the same non-reception. But one cannot 
count on that.</P>
<P>When I watched the film with a small audience, a viewer near me kept 
laughing aloud, and commenting. I was doubly irritated, by my 
fellow-viewer and by the film. Since I did not want my annoyance to 
influence my judgment, I moved discreetly to a quiet part of the 
theater. The move did not improve the movie.</P>
<P>"The Bachelor" opens with much footage of wild mustangs to hammer the 
point that this is just what bachelor men are. Ugh. Then, Jimmy (a 
pallid, personality-less O'Donnell) is singled out as another younger 
man playing the field. He is, however, lucky enough to enter into a 
three-year relationship with Anne (Zellweger), who is a perfect 
companion and (supposedly), is not pushing for marriage. However, for 
reasons unclear, Jimmy feels compelled to pop the question. He does 
this at a fancy restaurant where, apparently, fellow-bachelors 
traditionally take their girl-friends to offer them wedding bliss. 
(Are there such places?)</P>
<P>Jimmy ruins everything with his hesitations and bumbling, especially 
by telling Anne "You win" and explaining that the time had come for 
him "to s... or get off the pot."  Some courtship! Incensed, the 
girl walks out on him. His later efforts at making up for his idiocy 
are spurned.</P>
<P>Then grandpa (Ustinov), the very wealthy owner of a pool-table 
factory, dies, leaving a will on video. Jimmy will inherit one 
hundred million dollars if he marries on his 30th birthday --which 
just happens to be a bit over 24 hours away.  So Jimmy re-proposes to 
Anne, who says no. This sends him on a frantic searc for another 
instant bride. Riding a limousine with his best friend - the fat 
Marco- and a thin clergyman  (James Cromwell), he locates, meets and 
proposes to (all this with impossible speed) several of his ex 
girl-friends. They are all   shown as caricatures. They all refuse.</P>
<P>As a last resort, Marco places a big newspaper ad which results in an 
army of willing brides, all in wedding gowns, mobbing and besieging 
Jimmy.</P>
<P>You can see the happy ending coming ,from a thousand miles away. To 
wit,  Anne's change of heart at the last minute, and the twosome's 
beating of the clock at the last second.</P>
<P>"The Bachelor" is a one-and-a half joke flick,  dull, mechanically 
repetitious within its  agitated search and its regular cuts to Anne 
and her sister -- the latter used as the female equivalent of "the 
straight man" in vaudeville routines. Although peppered by a few good 
bits and  a nice soundtrack of mostly oldies, the film remains a 
loser throughout.</P>
<P>The time element is entirely incredible, far more so than "Around the 
World in Eighty Days." It is inconceivable that so much happens in so 
short a time. The characters are dull, except for Brooke Shields as a 
cold, calculating socialite and gold-digger. Edward Asner and Hal 
Holbrook are embarrassingly wasted. In his small part, the great, 
versatile Peter Ustinov is a bad imitation of an eccentric, 
authoritarian old geezer with a bad imitation of an American accent. 
James Cromwell, whose corrupt, sinister chief of police was so 
chill-making in "L.A. Confidential," is the clergyman,  He goes, 
unbelievably,  from a silent, dumb-looking character to a suddenly 
active one.</P>
<P>Worse than anything else is the "piece de resistance" : the anonymous 
throng of hundreds (thousands?) of eager brides-to-be, all of them 
grasping harridans, all wearing ugly wedding-dresses, all vulgar and 
repulsive. Buster Keaton knew something when he kept his camera 
mostly at a distance which did not personalize those women. And the 
fact that his film was silent is a blessing.</P>
