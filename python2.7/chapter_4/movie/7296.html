<PRE>                          THE DESIGNATED MOURNER
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1997 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>To say that this film is not for everyone is an understatement.  If you
enjoyed MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, there is a good chance you may very well
like THE DESIGNATED MOURNER in which the main character, Jack (Mike
Nichols in an exceptional acting perfortmance in his first film),
almost immediately says "Christ, you know, I remember so clearly the
moment . . . when was that?  . . . years ago . . . when someone was
saying, 'If God didn't like assholes, he wouldn't have made so many of
them.'"</P>
<P>In 1996, the play on which the film is based, was first performed at
London's National Theater.  The play (and film) were written by Wallace
Shawn.  There is a total of three characters; they speak directly to
the audience except with very rare exceptions when they address each
other.</P>
<P>Jack is the main character.  There is his wife, Judy (a radiant Miranda
Richardson) and her father, Howard (David de Keyser).  These three, in
a sort of disjointed "stream of consciousness" tell us what they are
thinking about themselves and each other.  There is no indication of
what prompts each new declaration, an unburdening of one's life.</P>
<P>Jack's first words are:  The designated mourner.  I am the designated
mourner. I have to tell you that a very special little world has died,
and I am the designated mourner.  Oh, yes, you see, it's an important
custom in many groups and tribes. Someone is assigned to grieve, to
wail and light the public ritual fire.  Someone is assigned when there
is no one else.</P>
<P>This pretty much sets the tone of the film.</P>
<P>Jack complains about his father-in-law, a liberal, a literery snob and
poet.  Jack further complains that he (and others) have to pretend they
like poetry; that is one of the things that distinguishes the so-
called highbrow from the lowbrow.  Who is going to admit that he
really enjoys lowbrow entertainment?</P>
<P>Judy complains of Jack:, "The one thing he never would say  . . . the
word he couldn't stand: love.  I love you."</P>
<P>Howard did not like son-in-law Jack.  "Sometimes Howard would pick on
me to play the role of idiot---well, I guess he ALWAYS did--ha ha ha--
and that was really quite fun in a way. "  "And after the knife had
gone in, he would just continue."</P>
<P>Jack was always wondering what we were waiting for.  "The appearance of
the Messiah?  Was all this nothing?"  What is life?  His greatest
pleasure was "the sweet, ever-changing caress of an early evening."</P>
<P>Looking for something different?  Try THE DESIGNATED MOURNER.</P>
