<P>     In the first moments of MAN ON THE MOON'S splendidly inventive
prologue, Jim Carrey says, "Hello ... I am Andy." And for two hours, he
is. There is no way to describe Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman in
Milos Forman's bio-pic except to say that Carrey inhabits Kaufman. When he
plays Kaufman's squeaky-voiced immigrant character, which will become
"Taxi's" Latka, he's pitch perfect; when he dives into one of Kaufman's
deliberately provocative stage routines, he captures a mind of lunatic
inventiveness at work. Carrey's work may be the best, most effective
extended impression in film history.</P>
<P>     The astonishing thing about MAN ON THE MOON is how entertaining it is
despite the fact that there's very little to it but Carrey's extended
impression. After a brief glimpse of Kaufman's childhood in Long Island,
MAN ON THE MOON dives into his early days as a stand-up comedy performer
who befuddles and aggravates his audiences as often as he makes them
laugh. He is undeniably unique, however, a fact that grabs the attention
of super-agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito). Shapiro sees stardom in
Kaufman, stardom Kaufman himself claims he wants. There's just the small
matter of Kaufman's insistence on pushing himself, his act and his
audience farther than they've ever gone before. Even as "Taxi" makes him
famous, his stunts -- including an open-ended challenge to beat any woman
in wrestling -- make him harder and harder for many people to take.</P>
<P>     Hard to take, perhaps, but impossible to ignore. It's also impossible
to deny that MAN ON THE MOON owes most of its entertainment value to
Kaufman himself, since the film's biggest laughts come from re-creations
of Kaufman's outrageous performances. We see his faux-nervous "Saturday
Night Live" lip-synch to the "Mighty Mouse" theme; we see his running feud
with wrestler Jerry Lawler (playing himself) that pre-sages the popularity
of professional wrestling as scripted antagonism; and we see plenty of
Kaufman's doppleganger, abrasive Vegas lounge singer Tony Clifton. When a
college audience demands "Latka!," Kaufman responds with a reading in its
entirety of _The Great Gatsby_. Watching Carrey-as-Kaufman reach for the
edges without anything resembling a net is exhilarating. Kaufman's
routines still have the ability to inspire gasping laughter.</P>
<P>     The only question remaining -- and the one for which MAN ON THE MOON
has no answer -- is who Andy Kaufman really was, and what he really was
trying to accomplish in his career. The script by Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski casts a similar rosy glow over its subject as their
scripts for ED WOOD and THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, making the film more
of an homage to driven eccentricity than piercing character study. It may
be true, as Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne (Courtney Love) says to him in one
scene, that "there is no real you," but that doesn't make the absence of 
insight any less disapppointing. While MAN ON THE MOON's performance set
pieces are dazzling, in a sense they never end. It's a portrait of an
entire life lived as performance art, when you keep hoping for at least a
glimpse behind the curtain.</P>
<P>     There are moments during the film's final half hour, when Kaufman is
coping with cancer -- and with the boy-who-cried-wolf repercussions as his
friends and family doubt that he is really sick -- that we begin to see a
self-aware Andy. In one of the film's best moments, a trip to a Philippine
"psychic surgery" clinic becomes an ironic revelation that attempts to
delude others can go too far. With just a few more moments like that, MAN
ON THE MOON might have been a classic film biography. Maybe ultimately
it's just a showpiece -- for Kaufman's decades-ahead-of-his-time genius,
and for Carrey's dynamic rendering of that genius. Maybe it's just a grand
illusion without an easily-understood human being behind it. And maybe, in
a story about the life of Andy Kaufman, that's perfectly appropriate.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Latkas gravis:  8.</PRE>
