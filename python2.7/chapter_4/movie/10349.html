<PRE>FOR RICHER OR POORER</PRE>

<P>   Possibly inspired by the marriage of Donald and Ivana
Trump, "For Richer or Poorer" is a sentimental comedy that
preaches the benefits of moderation on all sides. 
Unfortunately, it has been marred by a faulty trailer that
highlights the movie's plantation pratfalls over verbal parries. 
Although the dialogue often veers toward TV sitcom humor,
"For Richer or Poorer" provides a generous number of holiday
laughs while underscoring a believable chemistry between
Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley.  Most of the movie is set in Amish
country, specifically the town of Intercourse, Pennsylvania,
with insights into the culture of the local Plain People provided
by the director's consultation with a former member of the
community who left the order after eighteen years.</P>
<P>   The picture can help deflect any envy you might harbor
toward the very rich.  Tim Allen is in the role of Brad Sexton,
a real estate developer who is unhappily married to Caroline
Sexton (Kirstie Alley), a woman whose only profession is
shopping.  One of Brad's pet projects is the development of a
Disney-style theme park based on events in the Old
Testament, including a spectacular exhibition of the burning
bush, a Noah's arcade, a Torah, Torah, Torah attraction with
a targeted market of Jews and Japanese, and a Masada Inn
to relax after wading through kitsch.  When the IRS advises
Brad's accountant Bob (Wayne Knight) that his client is under
investigation for fraud, Brad and Caroline steal a taxi and race
toward a hideout where they hope they cannot be found by
the authorities.  They find this Shangri-La in the area
encompassed by Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the home of a
strict order of Pennsylvania Dutch (Amish), where they pass
themselves off as cousins of Samuel Yoder (Jay O. Sanders).</P>
<P>    At first considering the place to be worse than prison, the
incompatible Sextons learn the value of discipline, simplicity,
and doing work of genuine value. In return they offer valuable
counsel to their hosts, such as advice on the purchase of
farm land and the benefits of relaxing their strict code of
conduct to allow the use of "God's rainbow of colors" in the
somber black-and-gray attire of the members.</P>
<P>   While there is a considerable emphasis on physical humor
including Brad's experience with a horse that steps on his
foot, the movie has cute zingers that should bring a smile to
all by the most jaded in the audience.  When the vane
Caroline rhetorically asks, "How will I face my friends?" her
husband replies, "Pretend they're a mirror."  The highlight is a
fashion show sponsored by Caroline--who learns that real
work and unselfish giving make her happier than she has
ever been--using members of the Amish community to model
colorful clothes in their attempt to convince the elders to allow
a livelier dress code.  When Brad comes out modeling an
intensely blue shirt, Caroline calls the outfit brimming with
"blueberry and blackberry" hues.</P>
<P>   Director Bryan Spicer falters only when he introduces off-
the-wall characters like IRS agent Derek Lester (Larry Miller),
who acts like a keystone cop as he relentlessly pursues the
two outlaws.  When the movie concentrates on the
interchange between the Sextons and their Amish hosts, it
glides along on the appropriate side of credibility.  "For Richer
or Poorer" is in no way as sharp or witty as the year's best
comedy, "As Good As It Gets," but offers enough laughs and
sentimentality to include in your repertory of holiday
moviegoing.  Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 122 minutes.  (C)
