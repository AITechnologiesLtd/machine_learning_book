<PRE>CONGO (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Best-selling author Michael Chricton, same as his colleague
Stephen King, hadn't got much luck in adaptations of his
books into movies. At least this was the case in 1990s when
all those efforts, with an exception of JURASSIC PARK,
produced disappointing results. The worst disappointment of
them all was probably CONGO, 1995 adventure thriller
directed by Frank Marshall.</P>
<P>The plot begins in the jungles of Central Africa, somewhere
on the border of Congo and its politically unstable states.
R.B. Travis (played by Jon Doe Baker), greedy CEO of
Houston-based corporation, has sent his own son Charles
(played by Bruce Campbell) into the area in order to search
for world's largest diamonds - necessary ingredient for the
lasers his corporation was about develop. When communication
between Houston and Charles' jungle camp gets lost, Travis
hires Charles' former fiancee and ex-CIA agent Dr. Karen
Ross (played by Laura Linney) in order to locate him. When
Dr. Ross arrives in Central Africa she is soon accompanied
by few characters who are going to join her expedition for
their own reasons -Dr. Peter Elliott (played by Dylan Walsh)
is a researcher who wants to bring his talking gorilla to a
natural habitat; Herkemer Homolka is "Romanian
philantropist" who dreams of finding a treasure within a
lost city somewhere in the jungle, while Monroe Kelly
(played by Ernie Hudson) happens to be U.S. mercenary with
his own agenda.</P>
<P>CONGO was supposed to be a combination of late 20th Century
techno-thriller and old-fashioned adventure film about lost
treasures in distant, exotic lands. Unfortunately, Patrick
Shanley's script failed to properly employ both components
and the movie fell flat, not even managing to become a
parody of those two genres. The result is an anachronistic
mess made of cliched characters and situations that looks
like a cheap copy of Indiana Jones films and ends with
unsatisfying deus ex machina finale. Director Frank Marshall
is definitely unable to compensate flaws of such script, and
some actors don't help either, including Tim Curry whose
over-the-top performance looks more irritating than funny.
His colleagues, on the other hand, look mostly
disinterested, probably knowing that even with their best
efforts CONGO won't be a film to be particularly proud of.</P>
