<PRE>.                                 HAPPINESS
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1998 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     Holy smokes.</PRE>
<P>     HAPPINESS has been mired in controversy for the entire year, and
not without good reason.  Put simply, HAPPINESS is one of the most
shocking films I've ever seen - this from a man who adores A CLOCKWORK
ORANGE.</P>
<P>     Not that it's particularly graphic or lewd.  Rather, HAPPINESS is
truly eye-opening for its theme: that everyone in this world is pretty
much a pig of some sort.  Those that aren't are doomed to be victims.</P>
<P>     Watching the film, you get the idea that director Solondz may not
be too far off the mark.  A disturbing investigation into the underbelly
of suburban New Jersey, the film tracks a few days in the life of one
highly dysfunctional family and the people with whom their lives
intersect.  Namely, an obscene phone caller, a murderous neighbor, a
pedophilic serial rapist/family dad, a suicidal loser... and that's not
even including the three sisters themselves.  There's *no one*
redeemable in this movie.</P>
<P>     And that fits it to a "T".  Unlike YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,
which showed a bunch of pitiful losers interacting with one another to
no ultimate end, HAPPINESS shows how a bunch of losers can watch their
lives get even more pitiful - and downright disturbing - when the seams
in society start to crack.</P>
<P>     HAPPINESS is not for everyone.  In fact, it may not be for many of
you, unless you have a strong stomach and a taste for the bizarre.  And
HAPPINESS may not be perfect, either.  It's too long, it rambles from
time to time, and there's probably one too many characters to follow. 
But the film's boundary pushing, gripping storytelling, and
truer-than-life moments make up for it all.</P>
