<P>     Last Tuesday and Wednesday night I watched the television adaptation of
Fay Weldon's novel THE LIFE AND LOVES OF A SHE-DEVIL.  Friday I saw Susan
Seidelman's version of the same story for Orion Pictures.  The television
version took its title directly from the novel; the film version abbreviated
the title to just SHE-DEVIL, perhaps causing some confusion with the 1950s
science fiction movie of the same title.  Having seen the two versions so
close together and with the television version being about two and a half
times as long, I will disqualify myself from actually reviewing SHE-DEVIL
and just discuss the contrasts in the two versions.  The film is a very
pale, very weak, and almost entirely forgettable rendition of the same
story.  Even now, an hour after having seen the film, the television version
is more immediately memorable.  Let me say why.</P>
<P>     First, the television play had drama, comedy, and horror story mixed
together into whatever proportions seemed right as it went along.  The film
aimed at a market for comedy and always tried to keep the tone light and
frothy.  So right from the start the film was less ambitious than the movie.</P>
<P>     The film had a dream cast for the story.  It had a popular serious
actress, Meryl Streep, to play Mary; a popular television comedienne,
Roseanne Barr, to play Ruth; and a number of other good actors.  The
television version had virtual unknowns in the major roles.  So why was the
casting so wrong for the film?  Because everybody was cast exactly right in
the television play for the play's approach.  Streep could have played Mary
Fisher in the television play and done a reasonable job of it.  The film,
however, had more physical comedy.  Streep is hardly known for comic roles
and she is just not very good with it.  Julie T. Wallace who played Ruth in
the television play did not always have to be appealing to the audience.
She starts out with the personality of a red brick.  She is large, ugly,
heavy, sullen, and not outgoing at all.  Roseanne Barr got popular because
she has a bright personality.  Her weight does not stand in the way of her
being basically attractive and charismatic.  Even at the beginning of the
film it is hard to think of her as a loser.</P>
<P>     Thematically Ruth is very much like Stephen King's Carrie White.  She
is a woman who has almost nothing.  She does not have looks, she does not
have talent, she does not have money.  The only thing she has is her rage.
And her rage is enough.  From her rage she forges the power to destroy her
tormentors.  At least that is how it is in the television play.  In the film
she does not start nearly so low and she falls well short of destroying Bob
and Mary.  The ending for all three is reasonably happy in the film.  That
is how comedies work.  The television play did not have to worry about box-
office and could allow itself to be bleak.</P>
<P>     If I had to rate the two versions on the -4 to +4 scale, I would give
the television play a +2 and the movie a low 0.  But I do not trust those
ratings because each rating is probably too much affected by the other.  Let
me leave these ratings unofficial and say that the play (which runs
periodically on the Arts and Entertainment Network) IS worth your time to
see, probably much more than the film.</P>
