THE WILBY CONSPIRACY
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Apartheid in South Africa, one of the more shameful episodes in the
last half of this century, seemed to be mostly ignored by Hollywood
until late 1980s.  Before that time, American mainstream producers
didn't dare to tackle the subject of the country that was nominally
capitalist democracy and Western ally, yet with the regime that made
Communism look good. Instead of them, that task was carried out by
movie authors in Commonwealth countries, less troubled with cheap Cold
War politics. One of such projects is 1975 British production THE
WILBY CONSPIRACY, directed by Ralph Nelson and based on Peter
Driscoll's novel.</P>
<P>The movie begins in Cape Town courtroom, where Rina van Niekirk
(Prunella Gee), liberal white lawyer, tries to win freedom for her
client Shack Twala (Sydney Poitier), black anti-apartheid activist who
spent ten years in prison. To her own big surprise, the government
decides to let Twala go, but only hours after the release he gets
again in trouble with police, this time together with Rina's boyfriend
Jim Keogh (Michael Caine), British engineer. Two men become fugitives
and are forced to drive to Johannesburg, where Twala seeks help by
Doctor Mukharjee (Saeed Jaffrey), Hindu dentist and fellow member of
Black Congress. In the mean time, sadistical Major Horn (Nicol
Williamson) from the secret police is on their trail.</P>
<P>Like many thrillers from the 1970s, THE WILBY CONSPIRACY has a rather
complicated plot and some of today's viewers might even get lost in a
quagmire of political intrigue and endless double-crossings between
the movie's protagonists.  But, Ralph Nelson wraps it up as a solid
piece of entertainment, using political reality of contemporary South
Africa mostly as a background for conventional action thriller. So, we
have a lots of humour, fistfights, car chases and even one totally
gratuitous sex scene. Some might argue that the subject of racial
inequality and totalitarian oppression would be inappropriate for the
use in a such mainstream product. Anyway, the actors did a really good
job - Michael Caine brings a lot of charm to his role, unlike Sidney
Poitier, whose almost solemn presence gives a rather nice contrast to
Caine and establishes "buddy buddy" chemistry between the two. Other
performances seems bland, except for Nicol Williamson as very
convincing and intelligent villain. The end of the movie is perhaps
slightly disappointing, but nevertheless THE WHILBY CONSPIRACY as a
whole is worth watching, especially compared with today's "politically
correct" movies.</P>
