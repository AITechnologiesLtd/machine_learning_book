<PRE>All's Fair in `Love and Basketball'
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>When you read your horoscope, there always seems to be
a passage about waiting for stars and planets to
align.  Supposedly, when this finally occurs,
something joyful and magical will happen.  For a few
glorious moments, everything seems to fall into place.
 But celestial synchronization doesn't happen too
often.  The planets continuously move along their own
distinct orbits.  They are at the mercy of the sun's
gravitational forces.</P>
<P>This cosmic representation might be what
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood saw in creating
this charming film about a girl, a boy and their
delicate relationship.  `Love and Basketball' tells
the story of Quince (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan), two childhood friends from two different
worlds that want to be together but are inexorably
pulled in different directions by the forces of
basketball.</P>
<P>We first meet these two as young tykes at the local
playground.  Despite his youth, Quince already shows
the promise of a future star.  He doesn't think that
girls can ‘ball,' but Monica shows that she can move,
dribble and shoot as good as he.  Quince doesn't like
this at all.  He is clearly irritated, yet he is also
fascinated with her abilities.  An unlikely friendship
is born, forged together by basketball.</P>
<P>The film now fast-forwards to their High School senior
year.  Each of them has immeasurable basketball
talent, but Monica's off-the-court situation is much
different than Quince's.   She struggles to convince
her parents that she is not wasting her time with the
sport, she struggles with her on-court bad attitude
that keeps her benched, and she struggles with finding
the heart that makes her a standout player. 
Basketball is her life, yet her future is always full
of uncertainty.  Quince, however, benefits from having
a father who is an NBA player, is gaining notice among
the scouts, and seems so sure that he's destined for
greatness that he's almost casual about it.</P>
<P>Through the years, the two remain close friends but we
detect a hint of romance.  Alas, basketball's forces
keep them from connecting.  Quince, now a hero for the
USC men's basketball team, finds that girls are
throwing themselves at him.  It is difficult to resist
this kind of temptation.  Meanwhile, Monica attends
the same college and plays for the women's team.  She
is committed to elevating herself from being a scrub
on the roster, which may mean neglecting Quince during
a critical time of need.  Throughout their college
lives and even in the years beyond, they drift closer
together and then further apart, only to see this
cycle repeat.  Their individual journeys are uniquely
poignant, and eventually force them to ask some
important questions.  Was their something missing in
their lives?  Can love and basketball co-exist?  These
are the tough questions that they'll continue to
explore throughout this amiable film.</P>
<P>`Love and Basketball' has a stately, epic feeling as
it follows Quince and Monica over more than ten years
of their lives.  We see their personal fight to be
professional players and their attempts at finding a
medium between the forces of love and basketball.  The
story also poetically incorporates a storytelling
device that can be likened to momentum shifts in a
real basketball game.  Divided into four parts (the
movie refers to these as ‘quarters'), each act is set
during a different time period of their lives.  In one
act, we see Quince enjoying fame while Monica weeps in
the face of failure.  In the next sequence, it is
Monica who begins to rise while Quince begins to fall.
 We're never quite sure if Quince and Monica will ever
connect, but it will be joyful and magical if these
two stars finally align.</P>
