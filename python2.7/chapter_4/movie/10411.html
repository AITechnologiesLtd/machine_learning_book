<PRE>"Good Will Hunting" -- Sporting Drama        
by Homer Yen
(c) 1997</PRE>
<P>Roughneck, janitor, parolee, genius.  These words sum up the essence
of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a blue-collar boy who lives in the tough
neighborhoods of South Boston.  He likes to invite confrontation,
hangs out with a group of rough-and-tumble guys, and has a police
record a mile long.  In the day, he works at a construction worksite,
but at night, moonlights as a custodian at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.  </P>
<P>Within the building where he cleans, there is also an advanced
mathematics class being taught be the illustrious Professor Lambeau
(Stellan Sakrsgard).  As a distinguished faculty member and a Fields
Medal award-winner, he tickles the minds of his students by
challenging them to solve a complex math proof, which he writes on a
blackboard just outside the classroom door.  So difficult is this
challenge, that he expects no one to solve it until the end of the
semester.  Amazingly, someone solves it overnight.</P>
<P>While it's a huge surprise to the Professor who the brilliant mind is,
it is no surprise to the audience if you've seen any of the trailers
or commercials for this film.  Indeed, we learn that it is Will who
has an IQ of Einstein, a photographic memory, and an uncanny capacity
to see through the complexities of any equation.  But despite his
unparalleled talents, Will is suffering on the inside - a victim of
chronic abuse and loneliness from his days as a child, and, sadly,
would rather lay brick, hang out and drink beer rather than use his
gift for the betterment of others and himself.  </P>
<P>Four people try to rescue him from his path of self-destruction,
although their reasons are very different and sometimes selfish.
Professor Lambeau sees this as an opportunity to train a prodigy and
to take the field of math to new and exciting levels.  However, Will
is unruly and undisciplined.  Lambeau seeks a therapist on Will's
behalf and eventually asks his ex-college roommate, Sean McGuire
(Robin Williams), who agrees to help him.  Sean tries to bond with
Will, trying to learn what makes him tick, why he is repressed, and to
find a way for his happiness to emerge from his soul.  Will's world is
also affected by his best friend, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), who wants
Will to realize his gift and to take the initiative to do something
better.  Skylar (Minnie Driver), is Will's love interest who wants to
reach him, but is constantly held at bay by his defensive mechanisms.</P>
<P>This film is a straightforward drama that boasts some nice all-around
performances.  Williams is appealing as the therapist, using witty
banter and some unconventional tactics to break through to Will's
heart.  His role is a refreshing change that harks back to his
earnestness in Dead Poet's Society.   Damon remains focused as a
lonely and insecure soul hiding behind a facade of toughness.  The
storytelling is sound, and the story moves along at a good clip.</P>
<P>>From the beginning, we know that the entire story right up to the
ending will be somewhat predictable.  There are no real surprises
here, and that's ok.  There are precious moments to savor.  For
example, there is a great 'pick-up' scene in a bar as Will and a
Harvard student try to prove their smarts.  I especially liked the
Cro-Magnon-like Chuckie who confesses that his favorite moment in the
day is when he walks up to his house to pick him up to go to work.  "I
keep hoping that one day I'll walk up, and you won't be there," he
says tenderly. And, there are several touching moments between Will
and Sean as their bond grows closer.  At one point during a session by
a pond, Will quips, "is this a Taster's Choice moment?"  Indeed, there
are many such fine individual moments that makes Good Will Hunting a
nice catch.</P>
