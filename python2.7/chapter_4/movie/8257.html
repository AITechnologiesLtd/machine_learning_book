<P>Quick Change (1990) ***** out of ***** - Cast: Bill Murray, Geena Davis,
Randy Quaid, Jason Robards, Bob Elliott, Phil Hartman, Tony Shalhoub,
Stanley Tucci, Victor Argo, Philip Bosco, Kurtwood Smith. Written by: Howard
Franklin. Based on the book by: Jay Cronley. Directed by: Howard Franklin
and Bill Murray. Running Time: 89 minutes.</P>
<P>Bill Murray (who also co-produced and co-directed) stars as Grimm, a
disgruntled New York city official who, with the help of his girlfriend
Phyllis (Geena Davis) and his lifelong dim-witted friend Loomis (Randy
Quaid), manage to pull off a brilliant bank robbery. Their only problem is
now, with the police in pursuit, they can't manage to get out of the city.</P>
<P>"Quick Change" is a very funny film, right up there with "Ghostbusters" as
one of Murray's best. The three get into one unexpected situation after
another, each one leaving you thinking "Ok, NOW what are they supposed to
do?" There are plenty of laughs, and the level of comedy stays consistant
throughout. Murray and Quaid are hilarious, and Davis is actually watchable,
unlike the roles she takes now. The supporting cast is also fine, with Tony
Shalhoub (TV's "Wings") a standout as a cab driver who doesn't know a single
word of english.</P>
<P>For some reason the studio abandoned this film, as they released it without
hardly any promotion whatsoever. That makes it one of the best comedies of
all time that no one ever saw. That's a shame, it's fantastic entertainment.
