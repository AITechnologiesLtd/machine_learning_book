<P>Susan Granger's review of "BRIDE OF CHUCKY"</P>
<P>        If you're a horror film buff, you'll recall Chucky, the
supernatural doll with the soul of a serial killer, who came to life
in "Child's Play" (1988) and slashed his way through two subsequent
sequels. Now, he's back! But with a difference. Like "Scream" and "I
Know What You Did Last Summer," this Chucky tale, written by Don
Mancini, is an irreverent satire of the horror genre, aimed directly
at the teenage crowd. David Kirschner, the producer, states his
purpose succinctly: "We worked hard to get an R-rating because, if
you're not R-rated, you lose your 16, 17, and 18 year-old crowd. They
want to see the excitement, the chases, and the kill so, basically,
this is kind of a psychotic muppet movie."  Which isn't too surprising
since Kirschner began his career as an illustrator for Jim Henson,
creator of the Muppets. In this story, Chucky (a.k.a. Charles Lee Ray,
voiced by Brad Dourif) has a former girl-friend, Tiffany (Jennifer
Tilly) whose tarty soul has migrated into a doll too: a bridal
babe. Chucky and Tiffany do what you'd expect them to do, supervised
by Hong Kong director Ronny Yu ("The Bride with White Hair"),
considering the only way they can live happily ever after as humans is
to find compatible body donors. And the greatest horror is that, given
an offspring, there might be yet another sequel. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Bride of Chucky" is a malevolent, blood splattering
1. It's just too gross!</P>
