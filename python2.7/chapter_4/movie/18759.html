A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: John Sayles</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: John Sayles</PRE>
<P>Starring: Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, David Strathairn, and Vanessa Martinez</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is lounge singer Donna De Angelo. Vanessa
Martinez is Donna's teenage daughter Noelle. David Strathairn plays Joe
Gastineau, a handyman who was once a fisherman. They all live in a seaside
town in Alaska, and they all have issues. Donna has survived a string of
failed relationships and her career as a singer hasn't panned out. Noelle
is profoundly unhappy. Joe feels responsible for a boating accident years
ago. The three of them take a boat ride up the Alaskan coast and end up
stranded together on an inhospitable, deserted island. </P>
<P>Opinion:
Some movies are all about action and effects. A beautiful, high-maintenance
cast of stereotypical characters goes through a prefab movie formula to
entertain us with big budget bangs and booms and give us manufactured warm
and fuzzy feelings. Other, smaller budget movies are more like the small
theater experience. The plot allows the audience to develop empathy with an
ensemble of less than perfect characters. Then the characters are put in a
tight situation or place and all their issues come out. A lesson is learned
or an aspect highlighted.</P>
<P>LIMBO is more like the latter than the former. I'd like to see a theater
version of it someday. Characters in LIMBO behave the way real people might
act. They're not superheroic. They're not overly dramatic, overly
successful, stereotypical, or even glamorous. Everyone stays in character
even when life throws a bunch of dangerous and unexpected curve balls. And
there's no formula to this movie. </P>
<P>To tell the truth, the editing seems a little choppy in the last part, and
the movie's finale is a complete surprise. But it's good that way. In life
some of the most profound events, friendships, or forks in the road occur
in an unannounced way, sometimes not even recognized or noticed till years
later. LIMBO is sort of like that. Characters make life-changing decisions
and never even realize that they are making decisions. That's the beauty of
this movie. </P>
