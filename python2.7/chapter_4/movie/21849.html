Dogma
Directed by:  Kevin Smith
Starring: Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Jason Mewes, 
Janeane Garofalo, Alan Rickman, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, 
Kevin Smith, George Carlin
Running time:  125 minutes
My rating (5 star scale):  ***</PRE>
<P>Loki (Damon) and Bartleby (Affleck) are angels who have been 
expelled from heaven and sent to Wisconsin.  All they want to 
do is go home.  They find a loophole in the divine punishment.  
Cardinal Glick (Carlin) is offering absolution to the first 
people to walk through the rededicated St. Michael's church 
in New Jersey.  Loki and Bartleby forsake the cheese state for 
the garden state and a chance to reenter heaven.</P>
<P>Only if God is proven wrong, then the very fabric of creation 
is destroyed.  So, to prevent them, Bethany (Fiorentino as a 
Catholic abortion clinic worker suffering a crisis of faith) 
is given the mission of stopping them by Metatron (Rickman as 
the angelic voice of God).  Helping her are the prophets Jay 
(Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) who functioned as Greek chorus 
in Smith's first film Clerks.  Along the way, she encounters the 
13th apostle Rufus (Rock) and Serendipity a muse now working as 
a stripper (Hayek).  Meanwhile, a demon from Hell and three 
rollerblading, hockey stick wielding demonic thugs try to stop 
her and her motley crew from completing their divine mission.</P>
<P>This film has been the victim of a boycott campaign launched by 
people who feel it mocks the Catholic faith.  I'm not a Catholic, 
but I know a fair bit about Catholic theology.  I also saw this 
film with a fairly devout Catholic.  Neither of us saw anything 
objectionable in this movie.  Some characters say and do things 
which the Church might disapprove of.  But the characters who 
are presented as angelic or saints always stay within established 
Catholic doctrine.  In fact, this is one of the few movies I have 
seen which correctly identifies angels as a separate order of 
creation (as opposed to the It's a Wonderful Life belief that 
dead people become angels).  It comes down firmly on the side of 
the virgin birth, the miracle of the incarnation, the absolute 
power of God, and the authority of the Church.  In fact, I can't 
think of a movie made this half of the century which so strongly 
affirmed the power and authority of the Church.</P>
<P>Having said all that, I understand why people feel the need to 
complain about this film.  It suggests one can be a good Catholic 
and yet disagree with Church policy (Bethany is prochoice but is 
found to be righteous by Loki).  The prophets (who are genuinely 
good at heart and clearly instruments of God) are drug dealers.  
But the key issue is that God is depicted as having a sense of 
humour.  And religion, as we all know, is a very serious 
business.</P>
<P>I think those people are wrong.  I like the idea that one can be 
a good person but sometimes do bad things.  That suggests we all 
have some chance at being good.  I like the argument that God is 
about redemption, salvation, and hope (all happy things) but all 
we focus on is sin, damnation, and punishment.  And if Smith's 
God acts in incomprehensible and bizarre ways, well what do you 
expect of a divine being so awesomely powerful that humans cannot 
even hear Him talk without being killed by the force of His voice.</P>
<P>I think Smith takes religion pretty seriously and incorporates it 
into his everyday life.  And I think he took that view with this 
movie, trying to bring out the spiritual aspects of mundane 
activities and mundane people.  I think he has some interesting 
things to say about religion and he's gathered some interesting 
actors to say it.  Rickman is great as the voice of God.  Damon 
and Affleck have a great time as the two desperately unhappy 
angels yearning to return home.  Rock is superb as the apostle 
with a mission, playing his part perfectly.  And Smith may be 
the world's only genuinely funny mime as the brilliant and 
insightful Silent Bob.  The rest of the cast never sink below 
good, although they rarely achieve excellence.</P>
<P>The problem in this movie lies not in the cast nor the idea, but 
in the general lack of jokes.  I did laugh.  I enjoyed the 
Catholicism Wow movement and the not so subtle attack on the 
Disney corporation.  Everybody in the theatre laughed at times.  
But there was no hysterical laughter, no uproarious moments.  
There were moments with decent laughs and no more.  As comedy, 
this film is average at best.  As a movie to make you think, 
it score a little above average. It's worth catching at matinee 
prices but I don't think I could recommend full price for it.</P>
