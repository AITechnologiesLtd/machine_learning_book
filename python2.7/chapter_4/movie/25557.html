<P>AN AFFAIR OF LOVE (Une Liaison Pornographique)</P>
<PRE> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Fine Line Features
 Director: Frederic Fonteyne
 Writer:  Philippe Blasband
 Cast: Nathalie Baye, Sergi Lopez</PRE>
<P>   Since French pictures features more talk, generally, than
those of other nationalities, it sure helps to know the
language.  Subtitles are functional, of course, but subtleties
are lost.  To prove this (unscientifically) I noted which
members of the audience seated around me at the French
Institute Alliance Francais were speaking the language taught
by the institute and which were conversing in plain old
English.  The former group laughed quite a bit more
throughout the brief, 80 minutes "An Affair of Love," a picture
which had formerly been entitled "A Pornographic Affair." 
When one of the officials of FIAF spoke briefly to introduce
the picture, she said, "This is not a pornographic film," the
sophisticated audience uttered an ironic "awwww."  Though
the movie centers on sex, this could be the least
pornographic film you're likely to see this year, almost to such
an extent that if just one scene were cut, a PG-13 rating
would be in order.</P>
<P>   First shown in the U.S. at the New Directors/New Films
festival at New York's Museum of Modern Art, the picture has
a history.  At the Venice Film Festival, Nathalie Baye won
best actress for her performance--which proves only that one
does not have to come on like a raging bull, Hollywood style,
to achieve a dramatic performance.  While her
accomplishment here has real merit in that the slightest tic or
movement of the eye or nervous gesture communicates
books about her feelings, the picture itself is pretentious.  Ms.
Baye and Sergi Lopez, who perform in the roles of "Her" and
"Him" respectively, do a lot more behind closed doors than
the Belgian-born director Frederic Fonteyne shows us, but
boy can they chatter.</P>
<P>   Executed in the format of a he-said-she-said
mockumentary, the story gets its impetus from an listing that
a woman (Nathalie Baye) places asking for a man who can
fill a sexual fantasy of hers.  A man (Barcelona-born Sergi
Lopez) answers the ad, counting on a one-night stand.  They
meet in a cafe, talk for bit with inevitable nervousness, and
head for a hotel around the corner which she had booked in
advance.  The doors close and we in the audience see
nothing.  We never do learn of the fantasy and in a closing
interview, the man tells the interrogator that even if he were
tortured, he would not reveal what the fantasy was.  Why? 
Who knows?  Who cares?  By the time the film ends, we
know as much about these characters as they learn about
each other during the months in which they meet every
Thursday--which is to say very little.  We never learn where
they live because she repeatedly refuses to accept a lift from
her Romeo.  We never learn their names.  We know only that
at one point, when they decide to have sex the "normal" way
(and we do see them going at it but discreetly, with the
woman finding an excuse to cover both completely with a
sheet), she decides that she loves him.  What happens after
she makes this confession is so odd that the audience can
scarcely help concluding that the whole darn episode is
affected.</P>
<P>   One online critic from Dublin with a more positive view tells
his readers "the honesty of the writing, as it takes the two
characters through a range of recognisable emotions and
personal foibles which consistently ring true, is matched by
the openness and honesty of the central performances."  If
this is an honest relationship, give me deviousness.  A
woman confesses her love and a man more or less goes
along, and you'd think that they'd introduce themselves. 
Such a conclusion is apparently not arty enough for scripter
Philippe Blasband in the Iranian-born writer's second feature
film done in collaboration with director Fonteyne.</P>
