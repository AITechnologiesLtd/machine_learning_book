<P>[I am posting five reviews of STAR TREK VI.  I could easily swamp the group
with reviews of this movie, so I will probably not post any more unless
they say something very different than those posted here (e.g., a review
of the fashions in STAR TREK VI :-) ).  Followups are directed to
rec.arts.startrek to keep the discussion in the appropriate group.

<PRE>                   STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY
                       A film review by Randall Rhea
                        Copyright 1991 Randall Rhea</PRE>
<P>     The latest (and perhaps the last?) chapter in the Star Trek saga
stars the usual crew of the Starship Enterprise, along with a notable
performance by Christopher Plummer as a Klingon war general, and even a
cameo appearance by Christian Slater as a starship crewman.  Of all the
Star Trek films, this one is the most like a plot from the 1960's
television series, and will probably be the most interesting and
exciting of the six films to "Trekkies" and the general public.</P>
<P>     With the recent collapse of the Soviet Union, the topic of the film
is very timely.  Due to the upcoming destruction of their own planet due
to environmental mismanagement, the hated Klingon empire decides to make
peace overtures to the Federation.   Thanks to the naive instigation of
Spock, Captain Kirk is sent on a diplomatic mission to escort the
Klingon chancellor to a peace conference.  The story then unfolds like
a Sherlock Holmes murder mystery (Holmes is quoted by Spock during the
film) as a plot to sabotage the peace process is uncovered by Spock,
Scotty, and the usual crew.  </P>
<P>     The special effects are spectacular as usual, but they are not as
important to the film as the interaction of the characters or the
message of the story.   The acting is superb throughout; this is
probably Shatner's best and most believable performance ever, and
although they may be getting a bit old, the rest of the crew's
performances are fresh and lively.  The screenplay is very well done,
and it is spiced with intriguing philosophy and humor, particularly when
the Kingons and humans conflict in an expected clash of cultures.  ("You
haven't read  Shakespeare until you've read it in the original Klingon
language.")</P>
<P>     I found myself enjoying the film and getting quite wrapped up  in
it; unfortunately, it ends rather abruptly and expectedly.  It was as if
someone said, "Well, we've got to get this move finished by Christmas,
so we'd better wrap it up now."   After such a good buildup, the ending
was a bit disappointing because is was not as well thought-out as the
rest of the film.</P>
<P>     I do, however, highly recommend this enjoyable and intriguing film.
I recommend seeing it at a 70mm theater with a good sound system, as the
special effects are more exciting.  </P>
