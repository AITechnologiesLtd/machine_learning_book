<PRE>                                  AIR AMERICA
                       A film review by Sandy Grossmann
                        Copyright 1990 Sandy Grossmann</PRE>
<PRE>Cast:      Mel Gibson, Robert Downey, Jr.
Director:  Robert Spottiswoode</PRE>
<PRE>Synopsis:  Pilots watch out for each other and protect themselves
           from assorted bad and quasi-bad guys.  If you want to miss
           a miss, miss this one. It's a very conservatively
           played story that feels discontinuous and overly edited.</PRE>
<P>     Billy Covington, a young helicopter pilot who does traffic reports,
loses his pilot's license because of, well, stunt flying.  He's not out
of work for long, though: a recruiter for Air America convinces him that
excitement and money are just a half-world away in beautiful Laos.  Not
having anything better to do, and finding the thought of exotica fairly
enticing, Billy ships out and arrives at Air America's headquarters for
Laos.</P>
<P>     A word now about Air America, 1968 style.  The slogan was
"Anything, anywhere, any time."  (Or something similar :-)) And that's
what Air America could get for you if you were a "friendly" in the
Vietnam war.  As you probably know--but just in case you didn't--Air
America was a civilian airline run by your friends, the CIA.  And it was
the largest airline in the world, what with branches in South America
and in most trouble spots in the world.</P>
<P>     Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson) is one of the Air America pilots in Laos;
he breaks Billy in and shows him the ropes.  They talk, they fly, they
get shot at, they walk through jungles, etc.  Sounds like a typical
buddy movie, doesn't it?  It's not.  In a buddy movie, two characters of
(usually) dissimilar backgrounds and lifestyles and mores learn
Important Lessons from each other.  That doesn't happen here because the
two don't interact much on that level and don't really go through
important changes.</P>
<P>     That hints at the problem with this movie: the characters don't
move much from their original positions.  Where's the conflict that
causes a wrenching moral dilemma?  That is the basis for drama, and it's
just not here in sufficient quantity.  As a matter of fact, this film
feels disjointed, as if too much cut-and-paste occurred in a dark room.</P>
<P>     If you're interested in finding out how and why this movie got
made, read the article in this month's PREMIERE magazine (the one with
Nicholson on the cover).  Lots of work, lots of discomfort--including
typhoons and earthquakes--and lots of thought went into this movie, but
something happened during its transition from an idea to a reality.
Chop-chop, let's cut out the love interest.  Chop-chop, don't show so
much of Gene's home life.  Chop-chop, there's too much talk and not
enough action.</P>
<P>     The producer realized that a summer blockbuster has to appeal to
15-year-old boys.  Isn't there some sort of law against taking an adult
film and "teenaging" it?  Look at the lovely structure for this film: a
world-weary, distrusting pilot works for the CIA and learns to watch out
for his family, ignoring the compromises he has to make every day.  A
young pilot who stands on principle begins working for the CIA and
learns that not everything is clearly right or wrong.  The young pilot
pulls the world-weary pilot into a contest where the compromises are
unacceptable but the consequences to his family are too threatening.
That would make a good movie, don't you think?</P>
<P>     Now.  How can we screw it up?  Hmmm, let's see...  We'll make the
world-weary pilot a real cool cookie who never worries about safety or
thinks about the compromises he makes.  And let's make the young pilot a
hot head who never learns how to cool it.  Okay, now for the antagonist.
He should be a greedy guy, and let's not spend much time on him.</P>
<P>     As a result of this type of thinking, we have main characters who
only marginally influence each other, and not even in a believable way.
The main crisis is such a forced (and even trite) situation that not
even the main characters seem to take it seriously.  There's no real
danger, no real threat, and no real growth.</P>
<P>     Gibson is extremely restrained in this role.  It's as if he were
wrapping a cloak around himself in preparation for becoming Hamlet (his
next role).  His restraint has the curious effect of making his
character seem wooden.  He's never been worse than in this movie.  The
script (at least the script as we hear it) doesn't give him much to say,
but he has always risen way above any role he has played.  Maybe the
problem is with excessive exposition: you can hear him reading the
words.  Or maybe he was holding back, maintaining a reserve for
Zeffirelli (his next director).</P>
<P>     Robert Downey, Jr., does well enough, but his character was not
very interesting.  He's managed a couple of nice moments, and he
interacts well with the other cast members, but that's about it.</P>
<P>     Apparently, the filming, which was done in Thailand, was quite a
strain on everyone.  The monsoons couldn't have been very pleasant.  And
they really did have a 6.1 earthquake plus aftershocks.  The entire
cast and crew had to suffer through a myriad of inoculations as well as
worry about snakes and various nasty critters (including Siamese baby
pigs.  Really.  They're carrying some bizarre, fatal disease.  Would I
kid you?).  Gibson's usual stuntman either wasn't available or left
part-way through the film (I'm not sure which).  A myriad of
personality clashes tangled matters even further.  Altogether a
difficult prospect to film.</P>
<P>     Some directors can profit very handsomely by filming in a location
that increases stress: the conflict between characters is heightened,
and the location itself becomes part of the conflict.  However, this
director didn't focus the discomfort.  Instead, he tried to keep things
light and comedic.  He tempered the conflict.  He was wrong, and we're
the ones who pay.
