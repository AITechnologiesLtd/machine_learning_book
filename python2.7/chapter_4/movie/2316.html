<P>     With HEAVEN AND EARTH, Oliver Stone has completed his so-called
"Vietnam Trilogy"--three films that examine different aspect of the
war that, to this point, has provided the centerpiece of Stone's
filmmaking career.</P>
<P>     The story begins in the village of Ky La in central Vietnam during
the 1950s, where Phung Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le) is a peasant girl tending
the rice paddies with her mother (Joan Chen), while being lectured on
various aspects of life by her father (Haing Ngor).  As Le Ly grows,
she and her village are put through various torments as they become
caught between American-backed South Vietnamese government troops and
the Viet Cong.  Le Ly is tortured by one side and raped by the other
before leaving Ky La for Saigon and a life as a prostitute.  There she
meets Sgt. Steve Butler (Tommy Lee Jones), a lonely and kindly American
GI who's looking for someone to settle down with.  The pair marry and
leave Vietnam for San Diego.</P>
<P>     HEAVEN AND EARTH has the epic scope one would expect from a film
of this magnitude, but it lacks much of the narrative strength of
Stone's first two Vietnamese tales.  This film possesses only flashes
of the power of PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  It is a good
motion picture, and its story is certainly worth committing to film,
but HEAVEN AND EARTH is no masterpiece.</P>
<P>     The strongest segment of the movie is its first half, which takes
place in Vietnam.  The pace is less frenzied, and events are
better-motivated and more clearly-connected.  Watching the helpless
victimization of Le Ly is an emotionally-draining experience, but it
illustrates one of Stone's favorite themes--that in war, there are no
winners, and the innocent always suffer the worst.  The Viet Cong and
South Vietnamese government both engage in innumerable horrifying
acts.  There is a torture scene involving honey, ants, and snakes, that
is more disturbing to watch than some of the bloodiest sequences.</P>
<P>     Once Steve Butler enters the film, the direction of the narrative
begins to waver.  His romance with Le Ly happens too quickly and is
sketchily developed.  Large portions of Le Ly's adaptation to life in
California are glossed over in favor of an unnecessarily-long
epilogue.  This portion of HEAVEN AND EARTH could have been stronger
had the same care been lavished upon it as was devoted to the first
half.  The missteps are not fatal, but they're noticeable.</P>
<P>     Several interlocking themes are examined.  The first, and most
obvious, deals with the parallel sufferings of Le Ly and Butler.  Her
words, "Different skin, same suffering," elucidate a point that Stone's
trilogy has repeatedly returned to.  The protagonists in these films
are always those whose souls pay a terrible price in service to
violence.</P>
<P>     As Le Ly is brutalized by the war, so too is her country, and the
healing process is no easier on the land than on the people.
"Rebuilding after a war is like starting a family by being raped," says
Le Ly's brother, and the writer/director makes sure that the audience
is aware of all the implications of that phrase.</P>
<P>     Karma, as well as other metaphysical aspects of Buddhism are
skimmed over, with Stone occasionally managing to weave them seamlessly
into the overall story.  However, elements of one scene near the end
are jarring, especially considering a comment by Le Ly.</P>
<P>     Oliver Stone's directorial flair is in full evidence here, with a
number of memorable camera shots, perhaps the most impressive of which
occurs during the first landing in Ky La of a South Vietnamese
government helicopter.  The use of flashbacks, whether in
black-and-white or color, is overdone, as are the voiceovers, which at
times fall into the trap of telling the audience things that would have
been better off shown.</P>
<P>     The choice of newcomer Hiep Thi Le as Le Ly may become a source of
debate.  She is adequate, but not peerless, and the limits of her
acting ability are highlighted in several emotionally-charged scenes
opposite Haing Ngor and Tommy Lee Jones, both of whom give credible,
wrenching performances.</P>
<P>     Those who disliked Stone's previous entries of the trilogy will
find little to celebrate in HEAVEN AND EARTH.  Although the weakest of
the films, it is easily recognizable as the director's work by its
stylistic, thematic, and narrative content.  The story itself is
ambitious, and only partially-realized, but what there is on screen is
potent enough to warrant a viewing for those who admire the film maker
and aren't dissuaded by grim subjects.</P>
