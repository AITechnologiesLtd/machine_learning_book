<PRE>THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998)
A Film Review by Derek Miner
Copyright 1998 Derek Miner</PRE>
<P>I suppose I'm asking for trouble when I have to take issue with a Coen
Brothers film. Sure, there have always been those who don't like their
work, but it hardly seems to matter what criticisms are launched when you
"get it." Take, for instance, "The Hudsucker Proxy" which I found to be a
highly enjoyable, inventively surreal, lovingly crafted parable. I was
(and still am) awestruck at the critical trashing that film took. So here
I am, a traitor to the ranks, I suppose, because I just didn't "get" "The
Big Lebowski"</P>
<P>The film starts curiously enough, promising to be some sort of urban
legend, paralleling the old west with early-90s Los Angeles. We meet "the
Dude" (Jeff Bridges) -- Jeff Lebowski number one, slacker extraordinaire,
whose prized living room rug is soiled by some punks who are actually
after a _different_ Jeff Lebowski. That Lebowski (David Huddleston)
appears to be a rich man who ends up using the Dude to help recover his
kidnapped trophy-wife. The Dude is much more interested in bowling with
his pals (John Goodman and Steve Buscemi), but trouble (in the form of
Nihillists and assorted other wackos) just won't leave him alone.</P>
<P>"The Big Lebowski" begins with such promise. The bowling alley credit
sequence is one of the most absurdly funny things I've ever seen. Our
characters (for the most part) seem so honestly part of their reality, you
feel like _something_ amazing will happen. But it never does. After an
hour and a half, I was desperately waiting for the tangents of this film
to converge in some sensible, if absurd or ironic, way. I forgave the
lapses between humorous parts becuase I sensed it was all going somewhere,
and at the end of the ride I would understand. By the time the end credits
rolled, however, I felt cheated. I say "cheated" because it always seemed
possible (and likely) that the non-existent payoff was around the bend
from the next plot twist. By the time the film edged over the two hour
mark, it seemed like the plot just twisted away into nothingness and they
forgot to let us in on that fact.</P>
<P>At times in "The Big Lebowski," I marvelled at just how much guts the
Coens had to pull off what I saw up on the screen. I laughed heartily
several times. But even gutsy, original work needs some kind of anchor,
something to bring home the humanity of the story. That's why a cheap,
sloppy film like "Clerks" works so well whereas a slickly produced
festival entry can fail because the characters and writing don't resonate.
Even with quirkiness to spare, "The Big Lebowski" has all the character
resonance of a whoopie cushion. The bowling alley talks (if you could call
them that) shared between the Dude and bowling pals seem forced and
unfunny. These friends seem to hate each other, and their conversations
are so rude, you hope that someone (preferably our main character, The
Dude) will realize this and just move on. But The Dude doesn't seem any
the better at the end of his journey, and neither does anyone else, for
that matter.</P>
<P>I've read several reviews of this film, and every one of them has been
ready to praise "The Big Lebowski" despite it's flaws. So until someone
lets me in on what I didn't "get," I'll just go back to enjoying "Fargo"
and "The Hudsucker Proxy" at home, where it's safe.</P>
