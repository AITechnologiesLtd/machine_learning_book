<P>If "The Dead Zone" opened up a new area of concern for Cronenberg,
then "The Fly" confirmed, not that it should have needed confirming,
that he is much more than just a gore merchant. The love story that is
on the margins of "Dead Zone" is placed centre stage in "The Fly",
which is surely one of the most moving love stories ever made. It is
the ultimate riposte to the banalities of Hollywood romantic trash,
notably "Love Story" in which, you will remember, the heroine dies of
an incurable disease, but does it very prettily and quietly.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is incredibly simple - Seth Brundle, a scientist,
invents a new process to transport matter from one place to another in
a matter of seconds. After a row with his girlfriend, he decides to
try the process for himself, and is successful, with one big
reservation. A fly has penetrated the teleport, and the scientist has
now become "Brundlefly" as the computer so matter-of-factly puts
it. He gradually disintegrates, becoming first a man-fly hybrid and,
ultimately, more fly than man. HIs girlfriend is initially fascinated,
not least by his new status as a sexual athlete, but subsequently
becomes disgusted, and finally pitying. Brundle, on the other hand,
retains his love for the woman who is rejecting him, and relies on her
to deliver the coup-de-grace at the end, when the transformation is
complete.</P>
<P>"The Fly" has been called a metaphor for AIDS, something which
Cronenberg has always been very keen to reject. In truth, there is
nothing very AIDS-like about Brundle's problem. What the film is
undeniably about, however, is the experience of changing from one's
normal state into something different - be it from cancer or simply
from ageing. The patient seems to accomodate themselves fairly quickly
to their new state - Brundle even keeps a video record of his
disintegration, and catalogues the bits that fall off him, keeping
them in the bathroom cabinet. The problem comes for the people around
him who cannot accept the change, and want him back the way he
was. What the film conveys very well is the idea of having someone you
love change beyond all recognition.</P>
<P>Geena Davis is very good at disgust, and very sharp and funny in the
early sections. She even pulls off the difficult final scene, when she
has to put Brundlefly out of his misery. The problem is in the
structure of the film; she does not seem committed enough to Brundle
and their relationship has not been going for long enough before the
changes begin. The film would have been more effective if they had
been having a relationship for a more considerable period of
time. Incidentally, the same problem occurs yet again in "Dead
Ringers", but that's another story.</P>
<P>The strength of "The Fly", however, lies in its essential
honesty. Disease, particularly a fatal disease, is horrible, it's
messy and unpleasant. The film doesn't duck the nastier side of the
transformation; the new method of eating is a show-stopping sequence,
especially when it is later applied to a cartoon baddie, played by
John Getz. What helps a lot is Jeff Goldblum's incredible
performance. He gets over two important things; the self disgust at
the change, and the scientist's fascination at what is, after all, a
unique situation. He's also capable of unexpected anger, when he tells
his Davis to leave before he hurts her. It's a great performance, one
of the best in any of Cronenberg's films.</P>
<P>The effects, design and make-up are beyond criticism - the acid test
for this is the final scene in the film. Brundlefly, having turned
malevolent, wants to combine himself with Davis to create an eternal
union. Saved at the last moment, Davis escapes and Brundlefly only
combines himself with the teleporter. Dragging himself out of the
machine at the end, the creature picks up the end of a shotgun and
points it at his head. It sounds stupid, but on film it is incredibly
powerful. The look that the creature gives Davis at the end is
heartbreaking, which is perhaps the highest compliment I can pay the
effects team. It's in the great tradition of the tragic monster, which
goes right back to "King Kong".</P>
<P>Interesting that, in several of Cronenberg's films, the hero goes to
his death willingly at the end - even if it isn't suicide, it's a
blissful escape from a life which has become intolerable.  Cronenberg
seems to genuinely believe in the idea of the final redemption through
sacrifice; part of his romantic spirit, I suppose. It's a device which
works well in his films, largely because he plays it straight. There
is no camp in these films - camp being one of the major problems in
"eXistenZ". The emotions are for real, and the most important emotion
in "The Fly" and, even more so, in "Dead Ringers", is love. At the end
of "Dead Ringers", we can only really feel despair, but there is a
sort of hope at the end of both "The Fly" and "The Dead Zone". In
both, the hero dies, but there is also a final reconciliation with the
loved one that suggests, at least, some sort of closure.</P>
<P>Is "The Fly" an anti-science film ? I only raise the question because
I've read critics who argue that it is, but I'm not so sure. The
problems are caused by user-error, not by the computer, which only
does as it is supposed to. I'm not sure that science really comes into
it in "The Fly", because it has the structure of a classical tragedy -
the hero is brought down by one small mistake which then snowballs
into his destruction. Science is the enabler of the tragedy, but not
the sole cause of it.</P>
<P>"The Fly" was a huge hit with audiences, many of whom seem to have
misinterpreted it as a gore-fest.  It's not that simple; yes, it's
gory, but the gore is completely central to the story, rather as it is
in Carpenter's "The Thing", a film with which this shares little,
except an awareness of the vulnerability of the human body. In an
interview, Cronenberg said something very penetrating about this
central theme, one which recurs in many of his films. He talked about
the AIDS epidemic, and asked the interviewer to try to see it from the
point of view of the virus. For human beings, it's a crisis, but for
the virus, which is, after all, a living creature, it's like Christmas
and birthdays all rolled into one. It seems to me that this is very
illuminating, both as an observation, and also as a footnote to
Cronenberg's attitude to horror.</P>
<P>Ultimately though, what makes "The Fly" special is that it has genuine
concern for the problems of the human heart, and acknowledges that
while love may not conquer all, it can at least make an imprint upon
those it touches that they can never forget. Having said that, it also
accepts that in real life, love doesn't always work out, and that, for
some, this failure can be more than they can bear. Indeed, the theme
of the failure of love to work out is central to his next, and best,
film "Dead Ringers".</P>
