<P>"Nobody's Happy. They're just trying to sell you something."
Breakfast of Champions.</P>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Like it or not, this is an interesting film. I have the feeling that it's
going to be one of those pictures some people just love, while others just
love to hate.</P>
<P>Put it in the odd comedy genre. You know: "Rushmore," "Life Less Ordinary."
Though mostly a dark comedy, this film's got a wonderful sideways feel;
riding like a stunt car up on its two side wheels. In fact, I felt like a
stunt viewer. Not sure what to expect from that teetering perspective, I
still had fun even while suspending worries of the car flopping back down or
over before the end of the trials.</P>
<P>Too bad, that's exactly what happens to "Breakfast of Champions." Perhaps a
shade cockier than necessary, it extended it's own test course (by 20
needless minutes) falling on all fours with just about that much time left
in the film. A harsh disappointment after such an exhilarating ride.</P>
<P>Still, Bruce Willis (as the suicidal car dealer/celebrity) and especially
Nick Nolte give great performances. Actually, Nolte's performance as Willis'
right-hand, dress-wearing man at the dealership deserves Oscar
recognition -- and you can quote me on that.</P>
<P>Starring Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte, Glenne Headly, Barbara Hershey, Albert
Finney, Omar Epps and Lukas Haas. Director/Screenwriter Alan Rudolph.
Produced by David Blocker and David Willis at Sugar Creek. Distributed by
Buena Vista. (C) 1999. Rated R.</P>
<P>Grade ......................................... B+</P>
