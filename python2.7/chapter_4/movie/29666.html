<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A syrupy serving of Freudian analysis that looks tempting but tastes of too much
superego, id, and subconsious jive to be taken seriously. It's Hollywood's
version about what psychoanalysis is all about, which is making the analyst a
combination of a savior and parental figure who can magically unlock the secrets
of the mentally ill by offering them love and concern on a couch. This is the
first major film about that subject, and its sincere presentation to show it in
its best light is often awkward and seems quite outdated when viewed today.
Hitchcock throws in a murder mystery that works a little better than all the
mumbo jumbo Psych 1 lingo the viewer must sit through. </P>
<P>Dr. Constance Peterson (Ingrid Bergman) is a brilliant but dogmatic and
unfeeling, over-analytical psychoanalyst, in a mental institution located in
rural Rutland, Vermont, who upsets her male colleagues by not returning their
sexual advances. Her new boss, Dr. Edwardes (Peck), immediately attracts her and
they fall in love to the consternation of her former pursuers who thought she
was frigid. </P>
<P>It turns out that Dr. Edwardes is an impostor and an amnesiac, who has taken the
place of  the missing doctor. Just before he's discovered he slips a note under
her door and flees to a NYC hotel to try and figure out the cause of his dizzy
spells and who he is, and how he got to become Dr. Edwardes-- the shrink who was
scheduled to replace the hospital's twenty year veteran, Dr. Murchison (Leo G.
Carroll). </P>
<P>Constance runs after the possibly dangerous man, whose sanity is under question,
in NYC and takes him to Rochester to meet her elderly mentor, the wise
psychoanalyst, Dr. Alex Brulov (Chekhov). He gets the amnesiac to relate to him
a dream, one that was artfully designed by Salvador Dali (the highlight of the
film). It then becomes a murder mystery tale as the amnesiac through Constance's
loving help unlocks her lover's past secret and enables him to visualize where
Dr. Edwardes is buried in the snow and how they met for lunch in the presence of
Dr. Murchison. But when the police find him, they discover he's been killed by a
bullet and charge the Gregory Peck character with murder. To the rescue comes
Constance, who does her analyst thing and figures out who the real murderer is.
As she told Brulov, she could never love a murderer and therefore the way is
clear for her to marry Peck. </P>
<P>It's a very heavy-handed film that is earnestly played by the stars, but has no
resonance. 
It was one of the master's weaker films, yet it's still worth seeing because
there are many imaginative Hitchcock touches throughout. </P>
<P>The script was written by Ben Hecht, who obviously didn't have much of a feel
for the subject-matter. His knowledge of psychiatry is limited to having the
practitioner sweet talking the patient to spill his guts out and miraculously
coming up with the cure to all his problems. Ingrid and Peck do their best to
work through the stale lines they are forced to say, though they never make
their characters believable despite their best thespian efforts. This film is
really Spellbound. </P>
