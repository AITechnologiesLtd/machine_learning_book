<P>     Though not particularly engaging as either a sports film or an IRA
drama, THE BOXER *does* boast a great love story.  Daniel Day-Lewis and
Emily Watson (BREAKING THE WAVES) play Danny and Maggie, former teen
lovers rekindling their romance almost a decade-and-a-half after Danny
was sent up the river for IRA activities.  He's out of prison, but not
out of hot water.  Seems Maggie's now a prisoner's wife, having married
another IRA lad in the interim.  And she's not supposed to date-- no
prisoner's wife is.  (They risk broken kneecaps, among other forms of
societal scorn.) Now, for Maggie, the situation is even *more* dicey,
'cause her dad (Brian Cox) is an IRA bigwig.  He's trying to negotiate a
cease-fire that not everyone in his Belfast group is supporting, so he
can't afford even the *appearance* of impropriety.  He's also observed
that Danny has gone the way of the pacifist, forgoing his IRA ties in
favor of a more localized goal:  renovating the community center into a
sports gym.  Got it?  Yeah, there's lots going on here-- arguably too
much for this third collaboration between Daniel Day-Lewis and director
Jim Sheridan (IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, MY LEFT FOOT).  Neither the
sports stuff nor the IRA in-fighting ends up particularly affecting, but
it does keep your brain busy.  (Do *all* Brits watch fights as if in a
dinner-theater, with no shouting or yelling?  Or just the upper-crust?)
The romance is right there, though, thanks to two well-paired actors and
enough obstacles in their characters' paths to ensure that tears will
flow, no matter which way the story goes.  Bring a hankie.</P>
