<P>Better late than never, right? It was with some misgivings
that I went to see Liar Liar. Physical comedy and "low"
humor make good entertainment when done right, but I
don't have a strong wish to sit through 90 minutes of fart
jokes and pointless slapstick, nor do I need to pay to see
people simply acting like idiots. Jim Carrey's recent
offerings (and let's face it: movies with Jim Carrey starring
are "Jim Carrey" movies, not "action-adventure films",
"chick flicks", or "courtroom dramas") have been less than
inspiring in that regard. But, I confess, my misgivings were
misplaced - Liar Liar was worth the trip.</P>
<P>In LL, Jim Carrey plays a lawyer, Fletcher Reede. Of course,
lawyers are an easy target for humor, beginning with the
fact that the words "lawyer" and "liar" are so similar
phonetically. This little pun is exploited right off the top of
the movie - not a good sign. But LL manages to steer clear
of the easy and resentful humor usually directed at this
target. Fletcher is simply a guy whose success has gone to
his head, to the extent that he has lost the love of a good
woman and is now losing the affections of his son through
inattention. The fact that Fletcher is a lawyer isn't
particularly important in this respect, although it certainly
provides an excellent means for throwing his flaw into
sharp relief. So, LL ends up as a mixture of two types of
story: (1) a romantic comedy in which Fletcher is in danger
of permanently losing the love of Audrey (his ex) and Max
(his son), and (2) a slapstick in which Fletcher is in danger
of losing his chance at a partnership in his law firm due to
a comic and, for a lawyer, devastating flaw, namely an
inability to lie.</P>
<P>The first story is rather flat but, fortunately, mostly serves
to set up the second. Specifically, little Max, after being
disappointed by yet another broken promise from his
father (to attend his fifth birthday party), makes a wish that
his father would be unable to lie for just 24 hours. Well, as
the candles are blown out, a mystic wind brushes through
the curtains and makes the wish come true - and at about
the worst possible moment for Fletcher who is planning on
running some whoppers up the flagpole in court the next
day. Frankly, the results could hardly be described in words.
Fletcher is robbed completely of the ability to tell even the
smallest lie and begins, literally, to wrestle with the truth.</P>
<P>Carrey's unique and bizarre antics, expressions, and
delivery go to good use here. Instead of merely flailing
away like an imbecile, Carrey appears to be possessed by a
demon bent on destroying him in the most painfully
funny way possible. Each social, sexual, and professional
(but truthful) faux pas results in the appropriate contortion,
slap in the face, or fall to the floor. These fits appear so real
that Carrey can sell things like beating himself up with a
toilet and getting the laugh. There is, of course, lots of
parody of the office and courtroom settings, which generally
works well enough. But the movie also has a few moments
of high comedy - particularly a battle Fletcher picks with a
blue pen. In his desperation to lie, Fletcher picks a blue pen
up from his desk and tries to say "This pen is red." (I was
hoping for "This statement is false," but that would be for a
different movie.) He cannot, although he nearly ties
himself in a knot trying to do it. In a shot that would make
Peter Sellers proud, the pen then takes control of Fletcher's
hand and, perhaps resenting his attempt to misdescribe it,
returns the favor. Fletcher loses the struggle and emerges
with the truth written all over his face, in blue ink: "This
pen is BLUE."</P>
<P>Regrettably, but inevitably, the slapstick story starts to run
out and the romantic comedy begins to take over. In the
last twenty minutes or so, the two plots seem to struggle for
control. Fletcher wins his court case, in spite of the truth,
on a technicality. But he now realizes that justice has
hardly been served. Having been made to face the truth
that he's "an inconsiderate prick," Fletcher gets himself
fired, and ends up in jail while speeding to stop Audrey
from flying away to Boston with Jerry and Max. Serious
stuff. But after being bailed out, Fletcher impersonates a
piece of luggage and chases down Audrey's plane on the
runway using a mobile stairway gantry. In the final scene,
Fletcher and Audrey get back together. It wouldn't do to
complain too much about the unremarkable, romantic part
of the story despite its occasional intrusiveness, since it
serves to make Fletcher a sympathetic character. Otherwise,
he'd probably just seem to be pitiably insane.</P>
<P>Each story comes with a moral. First, people need to lie. LL
displays this point in an apt comic style, without preaching.
Second, self-deceit can make good things look bad, and vice
versa. The "vice versa" comes from Audrey, who
convinces herself that flying away with the wrong man is
the right thing to do. But this theme doesn't merit much
scrutiny or screen time. (Playing opposite Jim Carrey must
be intimidating. Hopefully Maura Tierney will get a better
chance to display her own acting abilities.) In combining its
two stories, LL works pretty well because it gives Jim Carrey
a chance to do what he does with a sympathetic, rather
than an asinine character. Certainly, lies and deceptions are
themes that can be revisited many times, if it's done well.</P>
