<P>"It disturbs me. People with warped minds are going to like it, though."
- Ted Turner on CRASH</P>
<P>Somewhere in the middle of CRASH, the remarkable new film from David
Cronenberg, James Ballard (James Spader) is caught in traffic. The cars
on the highway are at a standstill, stymied by an impact farther up the
blacktop. Ballard is driving a vintage Lincoln Continental, the kind of
convertible JFK rode through Dallas. The car belongs to Ballard's new
friend Vaughan (Elias Koteas, from EXOTICA), a visionary of sorts who
sees car crashes as "fertilizing," rather than destructive, events. In
the car with Ballard and Vaughan is Ballard's wife, Catherine (Deborah
Kara Unger), who is growing more and more attracted to Vaughan -- she
and Ballard seem to achieve sexual bliss more and more often by
comparing notes on their most recent adulteries. You could almost
consider this menage a trois a special kind of post-nuclear family.</P>
<P>Ballard eases the Lincoln into the breakdown lane and cruises serenely
alongside the stream of cars, finally coming across the steel and
chrome carnage itself. Vaughan's body juts up out of the Lincoln with
his beloved camera pressed to his face, flashbulb popping. It's a
spectacular crash -- at least three cars were involved. Ballard pulls
off the road entirely and the three get out of the Lincoln. Splitting
up and investigating the scene, Ballard, Vaughan and Catherine are
assimilated into the spectacle. Vaughan stalks the victims, taking
snapshots with impunity. The lovely, skeletal Catherine takes a seat
next to a woman whose facial features (we see as she turns toward the
camera) are crossed with blood and grue. Ballard watches from the
periphery as firefighters use saws and heavy-duty shears to perform
cesarean surgery on the cars and birth the bloody drivers and
passengers encased inside.</P>
<P>Imagine the angels from WINGS OF DESIRE investigating the highway
pile-up from Godard's WEEKEND -- that's the paranormal mood at this
crash scene. Further imagine that those angels began taking dirty
pictures of one another amid the wreckage, and you'll get a sense for
what Cronenberg has nearly accomplished. It's a movie about sexual
deviance taken to an extreme that borders on farce, a movie about the
ways human relationships are transforming in the latter years of the
20th century. It would be easy for CRASH to dissolve into high, mordant
comedy -- indeed, this is a witty movie -- but the tone is dry and
mournful throughout. These characters are truly ghosts among the
living.</P>
<P>CRASH is based on the 1973 novel by J.G. Ballard that used clinical,
pornographic language to describe sexual acts in the vocabulary of
automobile fetishists. Semen is smeared across instrument panels, the
marks of hood ornaments and dashboard moldings are embedded in flesh
like blistered tattoos, and orgasms are intimately related to the
thrumming of a car wash, the smell of grease and gasoline, and the
geometry of crumpled metal. The film version is, if you can believe it,
more restrained than the book. But it's an indicator of Cronenberg's
considerable skill that material like this seems at all credible on
celluloid.</P>
<P>CRASH was a rumored Cronenberg project for many years, even before it
became a reality. Certainly it had that sordid high-concept gloss to
it, a Cronenberg trademark: underground community of sexual deviants
gets off on car crashes. And of course it seemed to fit well with
Cronenberg's long-standing mission of investigating the transformative
power of modern technology. His first commercial feature was the
quasi-hedonistic SHIVERS (also 1973), which in its apocalyptic
treatment of venereal disease weirdly prefigured the AIDS epidemic. He
followed that up with films featuring, among other things, mutant sex
organs (RABID, 1977), mutant superpowers (SCANNERS, 1981), and mutant
cable TV (VIDEODROME, 1983). His unnerving DEAD RINGERS (1988) made
disquieting use of a gleaming, fetishistic toolkit of gynecological
instruments for operating on mutant women, and now CRASH suggests that
our obsession with ever more tortuous permutations of sexual
stimulation is itself a mutation -- or, perhaps more chillingly, an
evolution. At least in a metaphorical sense, Cronenberg's sympathies
seem, as always, to be on the side of the deviants.</P>
<P>The film opens with three sex scenes -- bang, bang, bang -- about which
much has been made elsewhere. But it's simply introductory material,
punctuated furiously by a crash scene in which Ballard, driving down a
highway at night trying to read a map by dome light, loses control of
his car, hops the median, and speeds through oncoming traffic for a few
harrowing moments before colliding head-on with another car.  Metal
twists and windshields shatter in real time, and Ballard -- who's
belted in -- winds up with a corpse in his passenger seat. Still
strapped into the other car is the dead man's wife, Helen (Holly
Hunter), and Ballard can only stare blankly at her as she struggles to
undo her own belt -- somehow exposing her left breast in the process.
That sort of fortuitous exhibitionism is emblematic of CRASH's unlikely
sex drive. (The boy-meets-girl premise of the screenplay would make
perfect narrative sense in a less violent context.) But after
introducing Ballard to Helen, Cronenberg orchestrates the ensuing
carnal action with a precise sense of the absurd.</P>
<P>The two don't make love right away, but they do convalesce in the same
hospital, which is usually reserved for airplane crash victims. When
they consummate their strange attraction, it's in the wreckage of
Ballard's car. Helen introduces Ballard to Vaughan, a scarred,
obsessive weirdo who, with a cadre of stunt drivers, recreates famous
car crashes -- the James Dean crash, the Jayne Mansfield crash -- for
small audiences at clandestine gatherings in the dead of night.
Through Vaughan, Ballard meets Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), a
flirtacious cripple whose leg braces resemble bondage gear.  Of all the
characters, Gabrielle is the only one who seems to have a sense of
humor -- especially in a scene of Cronenberg's invention that involves
an automobile showroom, a car salesman, Gabrielle's naked thigh, and a
delicate instance of penetration.</P>
<P>>From the metal pins that intrude upon the flesh of Ballard's lacerated
leg to the steering wheel imprint Vaughan has tattooed on his chest
(and the bruises he tattoos upon one of his lovers), CRASH is a science
fiction movie about the body's continued assimilation of its
environment in a motor culture. These are characters whose sexuality
pumps through the cloverleaf veins of the big city, who have deciphered
a secret code to discover a common nonverbal language that indulges,
connects and fulfills them. They feel that the Toronto traffic patterns
are getting heavier, that all the cars are gathering for some reason
they can't understand. If that sounds both trite and mysterious, it's a
neat expression of the human condition in the waning years of the
millenium, of powerlessness and disassociation in the face of the
population explosion.</P>
<P>Through all of this, Unger's Catherine retains a detachment even more
absolute than the occasionally bemused stare of Spader's Ballard. I
found myself wishing I had taken a closer look at all those magazines
Unger has appeared in lately, to figure out how much of what I saw
on-screen was her, and how much was CRASH's version of her. In
close-up, the contours of her face are as stark and angular as the
internal structure of a machine. She runs both hot and cold -- as a
character who removes her clothes so often that it seems like a robotic
functionality, Unger is fine and more than a little creepy.</P>
<P>Creepier is Koteas, whose Vaughan is sharply intelligent but
deceptively brutish. I'm a fan of his work, but I can't help but wonder
whether the script or the characterization is at fault -- I found my
attention drifting exactly twice during CRASH, both times during one of
Vaughan's very Cronenbergian monologues on the nature of crashes and
the "project" being undertaken. Perhaps Cronenberg himself could have
played the part of Vaughan, if only he cut a more imposing figure.
Spader seems completely at ease among these surroundings, which is an
indicator of Ballard's sense of alienation -- when you feel you've done
it all, it makes sense that you'd be willing to try anything.</P>
<P>Of all the cast, only Holly Hunter seems to make a self-conscious
effort at fitting in -- her slightly twerpy line readings only call
attention to themselves. Still, I think that everyone involved in CRASH
should get a trophy, since it's heartening to see "name" actors
fearlessly tackle risky material.</P>
<P>It remains to be seen, at this writing, whether CRASH will become a
flashpoint for debate in the U.S. the way it did in Great Britain,
where even the London tabloids took the film to task with headlines
blaring, "Ban This Car Crash Sex Film!" As might be expected, CRASH can
count among its critics a number of vocal blockheads -- including
studio honcho Ted Turner -- who demonstrate only their inability to
understand the concept of metaphor, or the idea that a film can
investigate deviant activity without necessarily endorsing it.</P>
<P>And CRASH is a rigorous investigation, though it's not everything that
it wants to be. It's a little obscure, a little repetitive, and, worse,
occasionally dull. But the experiment is so compelling, and the moments
that work so mesmerizing, that CRASH ultimately rewards the attention
you give it.</P>
<P>In fact, CRASH marks a fairly spectacular return to form for a
filmmaker who seemed in recent years to become bored with his own
vision. After making what may have been his closest approach to
respectability with the sufficiently brilliant DEAD RINGERS, Cronenberg
retreated into distinctive but comparably tepid adaptations of the
famous work of others -- in 1991, NAKED LUNCH's loose interpretation of
the life of William S. Burroughs and in 1993, M. BUTTERFLY's
squandering of a major studio's resources on a singular treatment of
the famous gender bender that could best be described as, well, odd.</P>
<P>Even though CRASH is another adaptation, Cronenberg and Ballard seem to
be pretty much on the same wavelength. He's returned to his conception
of a sort of underground elite -- the crash fetishists could be a part
of some secret society encompassing a host of refugees from Cronenberg
movies. More than anything he's done since VIDEODROME, CRASH seems to
be another crucial piece of what had once seemed to be the Cronenberg
project -- a phantasmal, cerebral meditation on the evolution of human
deviance. Since his next project is an original screenplay dealing with
virtual reality, we can only hope that his project is back on track.</P>
<P>The true meaning of CRASH is perhaps beyond words. It's shaped, no
doubt, by the viewer's individual reaction to its erotic set pieces. Is
it "sexy?" Well, sometimes. (Your mileage may vary.) Whether it's a
"cautionary tale" has been the subject of some debate. (Cronenberg now
says it's not.) It's certainly not meant for everyone -- in fact, most
viewers may find it either distasteful or simply ludicrous.  The final
lines of dialogue, in particular, induced not-quite-appropriate gales
of laughter at my screening. (It may be worth seeing in a nearly empty
theater for that reason.) But this is serious over-the-top filmmaking,
and the knowledge it imparts is well beyond the ken of almost anything
else that passes for commercial cinema these days.  If you're willing
to buckle up and take the ride, CRASH is a demonstration of
psychosexual decadence that LOST HIGHWAY only dreamed of, a true and
troubled film noir for the end of the millenium.</P>
