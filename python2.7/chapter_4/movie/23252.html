"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>What does it mean when a movie called Reindeer Games comes out in late
February?  There are two possible explanations:  The film just wasn't
ready for a Christmas release (the studio response) or the film would
have been slaughtered by Toy Story 2 and Any Given Sunday, not to
mention The Talented Mr. Ripley (the real response).  If there's one
thing that Hollywood knows, it's not to pit Ben against Matt at the box
office.</P>
<P>The first scene of Reindeer Games immediately made me forget about any
talk of stalled release dates.  Any film that opens with an overhead
shot of a dead, smoldering Santa will do that to you.  Of course, this
means that the action has already taken place and that the entire film
will be one big flashback, likely featuring a voice-over provided by the
protagonist.  Anybody getting tired of this trend?  Did the MPAA pass a
law that required at least one major theatrical release per week include
the whole flashback/voice-over thing?  It was cool when Kevin Spacey did
it in American Beauty, but come on.</P>
<P>The flashback reverts to six days earlier and the voice-over comes
courtesy of Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck, Boiler Room).  Rudy is a two-bit
hoodlum three days away from his release from Iron Mountain Prison in
Michigan, where he's been locked up since his grand theft auto
conviction.  His cellmate, Nick (James Frain, Hilary & Jackie), is also
scheduled to be released on the same day.  All Rudy can think about is
getting home in time for Christmas dinner to wolf down hot chocolate and
pecan pie, while Nick drools over pictures and letters from his pen-pal
sweetheart Ashley Mercer (Charlize Theron, The Cider House Rules).</P>
<P>Long story short, Rudy gets out of the clink, but Nick doesn't.  Rudy
pretends to be Nick so he can nail Ashley, who turns out to have a
psychotic, gun-running brother named Gabriel (Gary Sinise, The Green
Mile), who wants to use Rudy/Nick to pull of an Indian casino heist.
But it's not easy to tell who is playing who as the story twists and
turns into the film's final reel.  The script was written by Ehren
Kruger (Scream 3 and Arlington Road), so you almost have to expect
somewhat of a surprise ending.</P>
<P>In addition to several plot holes wider than Bill Bradley's neck,
Krueger's script also includes a handful of jokes about Native
Americans.  I don't have a problem with that kind of humor, as long as
it's funny (which it is here), but I couldn't help wondering how they
would have gone over if they had been told to an opportunistic magazine
reporter by a relief pitcher.  And speaking of race, could they have
cast a more ethnically diverse trio of hoodlums to support Gabriel?
There's the black guy (Clarence Williams III, The General's Daughter),
the Latino guy (Danny Trejo, ConAir) and the white guy (Donal Logue,
Runaway Bride).</P>
<P>On the plus side, Affleck shows that he is one damn charismatic actor.
Whether he's taking a punch in the gut or a dart in the chest, his
reactions are some of the most realistic I've seen.  He can scream and
gasp for air with the best of them.  The bad thing is that he's totally
unbelievable as a convict.  Hammy, perhaps, but Affleck really made the
film tolerable.  Sinise does well chewing up scenery as the bad guy, but
I just heard him crowing in a television interview that he came up with
the `look' for his character all on his own.  Wow – I'm pretty sure
that's he's the first bad guy to have a goatee, long hair, a leather
jacket and an earring.</P>
<P>Seventy-year-old director John Frankenheimer doesn't quite match his
previous effort (Ronin) but doesn't really come close to recreating his
all-time low (The Island of Dr. Moreau), either.  Even though
Frankenheimer has produced some of the finest car-chase scenes ever
captured on film and Affleck's character plays an auto thief, there are
no road hijinks in Games.  Even so, at seventy, Frankeheimer shows he
can still make a pretty decent action flick.</P>
<P>1:45 - R for strong violence, adult language, nudity and strong sexual
content</P>
