<P>     Luciano (Giuseppe Ieracitano), a nine year old boy, and his eleven
year old sister Rosetta (Valentina Scalici) live in a single-parent
family with their mother.  To supplement her meager income, the mother
sells Rosetta into prostitution.  When the police find out about this,
they come and take the mother off to jail, leaving Luciano and Rosetta
without a home or a family.  Antonio (Enrico Lo Verso), a young
carabiniere officer, is charged with escorting the two children to a
children's home.  However, upon arrival, he discovers that the children
will not be admitted because of Rosetta's dubious past.</P>
<P>     In the simplest terms, it's possible to boil IL LADRO DI BAMBINI
to an unusual "buddy film."  The children and Antonio are initially
apathetic to each other, but, as the movie progresses, a bond gradually
forms.  Such a distillation, however, does this movie a great
injustice.  Writer/director Gianni Amelio has successfully taken the
skeleton of a common story and infused it with a unique freshness
rarely found in movies of this sort.</P>
<P>     While the plot is not filled with novel twists, it is remarkable
because of a genuine insight into the human condition.  Also, there is
no pat ending.  The film concludes when its story has been told, not
when all the loose ends are neatly wrapped up.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the only serious complaint I have about IL LADRO DI
BAMBINI is its pacing.  The first half of the movie is on the slow side
as it introduces the characters and establishes the relationships
between them.  While I recognize the necessity of doing these things,
less time could have been expended to achieve the same ends.  There is
no emotional tension in this portion of the movie since the
relationships are still in fledgling form.</P>
<P>     The second half of IL LADRO DI BAMBINI is powerful.  This movie is
without parallel when it comes to the "show, don't tell" rule.  There
are scenes that approach masterpiece level in the depth of emotion they
are able to convey without resorting to explanatory dialogue.  The
audience can feel the impact of what is happening, even though little
of significance appears to be transpiring on screen.</P>
<P>     The profound effect that the children and Antonio have on each
other is developed slowly.  There is no sudden shift in perspectives.
Instead, the relationships are allowed to develop naturally.  As a
result, simple things have greater impact, and small acts of friendship
and affection are heart- warming.</P>
<P>     This is the debut feature for Giuseppe Ieracitano and Valentina
Scalici.  While Ieracitano is certainly competent in his role, he - and
everyone else in the cast - is vastly overshadowed by Scalici.  Without
exaggerating, I can say that this is the best performance I have ever
seen by a child actor.  Scalici has a style that would make most adult
performers drool with envy.  She is a master of dialogue, body
language, and facial expressions.  It's a pity that her exposure
outside of Italy will be so limited.</P>
<P>     IL LADRO DI BAMBINI is proof that a relatively simple,
uncomplicated story can be the basis of a vital movie.  So much is
accomplished in this film that it's impossible for a review to do it
justice.  Most of what happens transpires through minor action, so
those who have trouble sitting through "character stories" may find
this film tedious.  That's too bad, because this is easily one of the
most provacative, emotionally-stirring films to come along in quite a
while.</P>
