<P>The military courtroom drama called Rules of
Engagement is missing something crucial from its
story: an ending. The film just stops out of nowhere,
crushing the little excitement it had built up in its
previous hour and a half. It felt like the filmmakers
ran out of film and were forced to release whatever
they had taped. The script just contained an
expedient, lazy finish. The poor ending was upsetting
because I sat through the monotonous first three
quarters of the movie hoping for a thrilling,
unpredictable conclusion. All that was given were some
words on the screen explaining what eventually
happened to each of the main characters' lives.
Warning: don't expect a grand finale. </P>
<P>Featuring an all star cast, the movie has an
interesting premise. When anarchy erupts in the Middle
Eastern country of Yemen, a group of marines led by
Colonel Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) rush to the
scene in order to evacuate the embassy containing the
ambassador (Ben Kingsley) and his family. At the heat
of the moment, things get out of hand when three
marines are shot down. The question is who shot them?
Childers thinking it was citizens with guns protesting
below, orders his men to fire at the civilians. The
marines kill eighty three civilians and when no guns
are found on the civilians, America is forced to
explain what happened. In order to make it seem like
America was not to blame, top officials (including
Bruce Greenwood, doing his usual role) frame and
prosecute Childers saying he made an incorrect order.
When evidence is destroyed and witnesses hushed, it is
an innocent Childers against the government. Only
Colonel Hays Hodges (well acted by Tommy Lee Jones), a
Vietnam pal of Childers and retired lawyer doing one
more case, can defend Childers and prove to the jury
that he is innocent.</P>
<P>Rules of Engagement is an ok movie. I didn't feel sick
once it was over but I didn't feel like celebrating
either. For a film that brags about its intensity,
there was not much present besides the chaotic, loud,
and ultimately exciting scene which the trial revolves
around. The courtroom scenes in which the characters
cursed and screamed at each other were nothing new or
edge-of-your-seat.  Every member of the cast had done
something like this before; Samuel L. Jackson does
this type of movie every year (think A Time to Kill
meets The Negotiator), and Tommy Lee Jones and Bruce
Greenwood played rivals in Double Jeopardy just last
year. The organization of the film may have hurt the
excitement level expected from moviegoers. With the
incident in Yemen occurring during the first half hour
of the film, the rest of the movie seemed very dull
and bland in comparison. </P>
<P>The little things in Rules of Engagement distracted me
more than the plot holes and boring speeches. Guy
Pearce's ridiculous overacting as the prosecuting
lawyer is a prime example of the little things hurting
the overall picture. Another distraction is a
pointless scene in which Childers and Hodges bond
together by beating each other up until blood shows,
Fight Club style. Worse than that, Childers now has an
annoying black eye for the rest of the movie which
caught my attention more than his speeches declaring
innocence. Another mistake is the disappearance of
some of the actors halfway through the movie. The
ambassador and his wife (Anne Archer) as well as a
marine who was skeptical of Childers decision (Blair
Underwood), although they are very important
characters, appear very briefly in the film just
adding the feeling like the movie wasn't really
finished when the producers released it. </P>
<P>Rules of Engagement is something you've seen before
except without an ending. That is the best way to
describe it.</P>
