<P>"All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases.  It's all 
frightfully romantic." 
            - Juliet Hulme, HEAVENLY CREATURES </P>
<P>     HEAVENLY CREATURES is based on the true story of Pauline Rieper
(Melanie Lynskey) and Juliet Hulme (Kate Winslet) set in Christchurch,
New Zeland from 1952 to 1954.  These two teenagers (Pauline was 15 in
1954; Juliet was 17) formed an intense and, some argued, unhealthy
friendship.  They were inseparable, and when a case of tuberculosis
forced Juliet into quarantine, they wrote voluminous letters to each
other, both as themselves and as fantasy characters they created.
Eventually, their parents became concerned about the nature of this
friendship (homosexuality being regarded as a very negative "condition"
during the '50s), and attempted to prevent Pauline and Juliet from
seeing each other.  The tragic ramifications of this action, as
described in the real Pauline's journal, are related in Peter Jackson's
original motion picture.</P>
<P>     When released earlier this year in New Zeland, HEAVENLY CREATURES
created a stir, re-awakening interest in the long-buried story.
Journalists, hungry to capitalize on the Rieper/Hulme case, went in
search for either of the two women.  While Pauline was never located,
Juliet was discovered to be prospering in Scotland as a bestselling
murder mystery author using the pen name of Anne Perry.  Considering
the events chronicled in HEAVENLY CREATURES, this makes a bizarre and
ironically appropriate postscript.</P>
<P>     This uniquely powerful film accrues much of its momentum through
character interaction.  Pauline and Juliet are so well-scripted and
solidly portrayed that the viewer cannot help but be captivated by
their relationship.  While it is intentionally left ambiguous whether
either of these girls is a lesbian (one sexual encounter does not
define a lifestyle), no such uncertainty accompanies the exploration of
how hopelessly tangled their lives and emotional well-being have
become.</P>
<P>     Fantasy plays a crucial role in HEAVENLY CREATURES.  It's up to
the individual viewer to decide how psychotic Pauline and Juliet are
(they share visions of the "4th World", a "heaven without Christians"
inhabited by clay people, where the tunes Mario Lanza perpetually fill
the air).  Certainly, these two are more at home living in a world
apart from our own, where romance and happiness reign.</P>
<P>     Thirty-three-year old Peter Jackson, whose films include BAD TASTE
and BRAINDEAD, has brought an unusually comic and colorful perspective
to what one might naturally assume to be a painful tale.  With the
influence of MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS very much in evidence,
Jackson moulds the fantasy world into a place of richly-constructed
images where the boundless creativity of his characters can find its
release.  The levity of this place also represents a stark contrast to
the shocking sequence that both opens and closes the film.</P>
<P>     Melanie Lynskey (appearing in her first film) and Kate Winslet
(also a relatively new face) are convincing as the two friends, and the
chemistry between them carries HEAVENLY CREATURES during some of its
slower moments.  The supporting cast, which includes Diana Kent as
Pauline's mother, Sarah Peirse as Juliet's mother, and Clive Merrison
and Simon O'Connor, is excellent.</P>
<P>     It's said that every person's closet contains at least one
skeleton, and this is certainly true in the case of Anne Perry.  As a
dysfunctional family tale, the disturbing HEAVENLY CREATURES offers no
facile answers as to what might have been done differently to prevent
circumstances from degenerating as they did.  Revealed in unforgettable
fashion by a capable director, the events that unfold in this film are
not easily forgotten.</P>
