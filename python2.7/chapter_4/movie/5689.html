Rated R (violence)</P>
<P>John Sayles, who makes movies that are off the beaten track, 
has come up with a rather original, appropriately lengthy, 
and in some ways fascinating film. Nominally, is it a story 
of detection. Near the imaginary  small town of Frontera, 
Texas, across the Mexican border (the Rio Grande), a skull 
is found by chance. Rio County Sheriff Sam Deeds 
investigates. The clues lead him to the certainty that the 
deceased was Charley Wade, once a sheriff himself.</P>
<P>Wade was vicious and corrupt to the bone, a specialist in 
"la mordida" which is what Mexicans call payola or 
extortion. That's how you can get out of a traffic ticket 
south of the border, but Charley, like a gangster in 
sheriff's clothing, went beyond this to protection money. He 
was also a contemptible racist. </P>
<P>In 1957, Buddy Deeds, Sam's father, was, along with Hollis 
Pogue, one of Charley's deputies. One day, Buddy decided to 
run the corrupt Wade out of town. Wade was never heard from 
again, while Buddy became Sheriff and a local legend.</P>
<P>Some 40 years later, with the now-deceased Buddy being 
locally worshipped (a plaque is being dedicated to him), 
with  Hollis now the Mayor,and Deeds Jr., a newish, honest 
sherriff who makes grafters uncomfortable, Sam becomes 
almost sure that it was his father who had killed Wade. In 
part this is wishful thinking: Sam, an estranged son, would 
like to place the guilt on his own father. </P>
<P>This is merely the start and premise of the movie. Its 
official synopsis  runs to four pages, my own notes to 
seven. All this because "Lone Star" packs a huge number of 
local persons, acting, interacting, with connected pasts and 
present. Among them is widow Pilar, once Sam's high school 
sweetheart;  Pilar's mother, Mrs. Cruz, a successful 
restaurant owner, also widowed; roadhouse-owner Otis Payne, 
known as The Mayor of Blacktown; the son he had abandoned 
and who now returns as Colonel Payne, there to close an Army 
base; Payne's boy, rather alienated; Bunny, Sam's nutty 
ex-wife; and many others.</P>
<P>One can double the number of those characters as Sayles's 
main tactic is the flashback that shows them in times past. 
The flashbacks occur without warning, so that you must be 
get ready for them. And, whether the time is "now" or 
"then," Sayles adds to his system a large number of cryptic 
scenes that are connected to many a dark secret.  </P>
<P>The movie is ambitious, not limited to a whodunit but 
reaching into ethno-political territory. In a town where the 
gringos still rule yet 19 out of 20 people are of Mexican 
origin, problems of identity are enormous, including active 
or dimly felt racism, the teaching of history to students, 
etc. Some cases are especially interesting, like Mrs. Cruz 
who often says "Speak English! We're in the United States!" 
and denounces "wets" (wetbacks) to the Border Patrol. But 
it's not that simple. There are changes in attitude and the 
flashbacks are full of surprises.</P>
<P>We also get some good insights into non-white and 
non-Mexican matters. When  the spit and polish Colonel 
reprimands a black private, he asks her why , in her 
opinion, there are so many African-Americans in the Army. He 
expects a patriotic reply but what he gets is "This is not 
our country, but the Army is a good deal."  </P>
<P>There's not a dull minute in the film, yet it is not a 
touching work. It is somewhat cerebral, needs much 
concentration. You are kept very busy following and 
deciphering matters as it shifts back and forth to past and 
present. Some scenes are disjointed. Some characters  come 
to a dead end after having served the purpose of making a 
point.  Like Pilar's boy when he is arrested without reason. 
Like two Sergeants, one black one white, openly in  love ... 
to show that times have changed. Like an outdoors seller who 
warns Sam :" Be careful when you go poking, you'll never 
know what you'll find." This last item is a cliche, of which 
this maverick movie is not entirely free. </P>
<P>This mystery wrapped in an enigma is also poorly miked (at 
least in my preview video), something that is a problem with 
many movies now that performers have stopped enunciating. 
The various accents (genuine or imitated) and Texas drawls 
can make some lines impenetrable. </P>
<P>Sayles is not prodigal with humor, a point in his favor 
given the seriousness of the setup. The two exceptions I can 
think of is that Chris Cooper, in homage to Gary Cooper who 
played Longfellow Deeds in Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to 
Town," has Deeds as his nom-de-film. The other is this 
exchange. Sam: "I'm going to the other side." Colleague: 
"Republicans?" Sam: "No, Mexico." </P>
<P>"Lone Star", with its large cast of characters, is built 
like a thick novel or like a TV series whose material has 
been compacted. But contrary to television practices, Sayles 
is economical and un-repetitious.</P>
<P>At the Cannes Festival, where I missed it, the film was 
expected with some trepidation, yet after its showing I 
heard no comments whatsoever. I can see why. It must have 
puzzled audiences with its Tex-Mex nature, its convolutions, 
its dialogue that loses flavor in subtitles.</P>
<P>All that said, "Lone Star" is eminently worth seeing. It is 
beautifully produced, shot and performed. Kris Kristofferson 
is far better as a villain than as a hero. The  soundtrack 
of Mexican and American songs is first-rate and, for a 
change, provides the right commentary. Finally this is one 
of the rare films that deal (intelligently too) with 
ethnicities in the USA.</P>
