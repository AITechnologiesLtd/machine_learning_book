<PRE>Cast: Michael Keaton, Andy Garcia, Marcia Gay Hardin
Directed by: Barbet Schroeder
Running Time: 100 minutes
My Rating: **** out of *****</PRE>
<P>"Desperate Measures" was something I was excited about seeing back when it
was originally scheduled to be released: Summer '97. For some reason, it was
delayed until Hollywood's traditional dumping ground: January. Now that it's
out, I see no real reason for that delay, as it's a simple yet highly
entertaining film.</P>
<P>Michael Keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the
life of the dying son of a San Francisco police detective (Garcia). Keaton
agrees to the transplant, only so he can attempt escape. He succeeds, in a
plan that of course could only work in the movies. The police force is now
trying to kill Keaton, while Garcia is working against them trying to keep
Keaton alive in order to save his son.</P>
<P>The film definately has it's flaws. The plot is strictly TV Movie of the
Week fare, but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that
status. Also, after Keaton's escape, Garcia's captain barks at him "How many
men have to die to save your kid's life?" which the film treats as such an
evil and insignificant remark. The thing is, it's a vaild point. How many
people have to be needlessly crippled, burned, and killed just to save this
one child? What's the greater good here? Many lives or one life? If movies
really had guts nowadays, I would have loved to have seen this movie come
down to a final choice for Garcia's character. Place him in a situation
where he knows that he has to kill Keaton because Keaton is about to kill
someone else. Alas, movies these days generally have no such ambition to
pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable.</P>
<P>Despite a few silly moments (and one or two really stupid ones), the good
things about "Desperate Measures" outnumber the bad. The main highlight
would be Keaton's performance. The character could have easily been an
overacting, scene chewing freak, but Keaton underplays it nicely. He's not
as menacing as he was in "Pacific Heights" or even as menacing as he was in
"Batman" (yes kids, Batman used to be a dark character), but you certainly
get the idea that he's evil. Even the final scene of the film, which
normally I would just hate, seems strangely appropriate for this film. So
much so that I didn't mind it in the slightest. And another bonus: the film
takes place in San Francisco, which usually means a car chase on those hills
that you've seen a billion times before. And for a moment, it looked as
though it was about to happen. But it doesn't, and THAT'S creative. [R]<HR>       The Jacksonville Film Journal -- Film Reviews by Chuck Dowling
