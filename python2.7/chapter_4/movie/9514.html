<PRE>LORD OF THE FLIES (1990)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Harry Hook
Writer: Sara Schiff (from the novel by William Golding)
Starring: Bathalzar Getty, Chris Fuhhr, Danuel Pipoly</P>
<P>William Golding's "Lord of the Flies" is obligatory reading for the
young student.  So obligatory that I never read it.  I guess that makes
me feel special, but there's something about overly symbolic fables
(i.e. Orwell's "Animal Farm," one of my favorites) that gets me, and I
wish I had.  Of course, I guess I could.  But like most famous novels,
there's a film adaptation that's about half as good as its source.  And
that's precisely what I saw when I watched this on TV impromptu during a
VERY boring Sunday afternoon here at Temple U.</P>
<P>For those who don't know, "Lord of the Flies" is about a group of school
boys who are marooned on an island without any adult supervision (though
there's the pilot, but he's so wounded that he's pretty much insane and
has to be tied down).  The boys need some discipline, so they
democratically elect Ralph (Bathalzar Getty, from "Lost Highway").  But
as things go on, and as they realize that they're really not going to be
rescued in any forseeable future, some become savages, painting their
faces, carrying spears, and running around half-naked, speaking in short
declaritive sentences, like "Cheif brings gift."</P>
<P>The leader of the other clan is Jack (Chris Fuhhr), who is a kind of
asswhole of a kid, who starts off as a bully and proceeds to the totally
evil dictator of what turns out to be a clan of savages, alienating
Ralph and his only friend, Piggy (Danuel Pipoly), who is supposed to be
the wise, overly intellectual kid of them all, who somehow saved his
glasses in the crash.  The climactic ending is obvious, but not
anticlimactic, and, of course, shocking, bringing all the ideas
together.</P>
<P>These characters are all supposed to represent one part of the psyche. 
Ralph is supposed to be the part that is civil and wants law and order. 
Jack is the savage, immature part.  And Piggy, is, of course, the voice
of reason in a increasingly chaotic island (there's also another
character, Simon, who is pretty much not in this film).</P>
<P>And, of course, everything is supposed to be symbolic.  The numerous
misadventures of Piggy's glasses (i.e. it's breaking and being stolen),
causing him to be near blind, is symbolic of him breaking down, and
hoping to be with the other clan.  And the actual "lord of the flies," a
decapitated boar's head is supposed to be a sign of ultimate evil and
horror.  Then there's the "beast," which I guess represents their
gradually declining civility or something.  I didn't read the book, give
me a break, I'm bullshitting here.</P>
<P>Anyway, this is all supposed to happen here in this film...and it does. 
But while apparently in the book, it's supposed to be subtle and we're
supposed to watch the story unfold and think about afterwards...much
like a good novel.  But the director is so paranoid that the Americans
won't get it, so he makes everything in our faces.  This adheres the
story, and makes it seem way too mechanical.  Also, this makes the
symbol less intense.  It's supposed to shock us.  I was just like, "Oh,
he broke his glasses, ho hum."</P>
<P>The acting is also not very good.  While Bathalzar and Fuhhr are merely
passable as the two leads, the guy who plays Piggy can't even complete a
sentence, and he seems to whiny and boring.  I mean, the part where he's
preaching to them (and nearly says, "Why can't we all get along?"), and
some jerks above him push a giant rock onto his head, I was not just
shocked that they've become savages like that, but I was also feeling a
bit of contradiction because I was hoping someone would do that to him
anyway.  The guy can't act, he's annoying, and he's nothing like he
should be.</P>
<P>This whole film is nothing like it should be.  I'm supposed to feel
totally shocked by the story, how these school kids have become the
epitomy of evil.  When they kill Piggy and Simon, they're shown as being
shocked and saddened.  They're not supposed to care (except for Piggy
and Ralph).  And the boar's head is just not as scary as it should be. 
I mean, I didn't even read the book and I was disappointed.</P>
<P>On a positive note, it's not a BAD film.  By the end, I was kinda
feeling depressed, which was probably what the director had aimed for. 
When they killed Piggy, I was hoping someone would just kill those
pricks who did it.  The ending is too short, but the visions we see,
with the forest on fire, and everyone chasing Ralph, who has almost no
chance of survivial except for a little part of deux ex machina, totally
bowled me over.  It was absolutely mesmerizing and almost redeems the
film from a truly bad rating.  And the cinematography is gorgeous, but
seems too much like a film for the rotary travelogue.</P>
<P>This film is wrongly modernized.  The kids swear and talk about "Alf"
(why, in god's name, ALF?!), and there are planes and choppers, and
they're very early American instead of post-war Brits.  What is the
point of this?  To dumb it down?  This modernization just weakens the
story, because even in 1990 there were kids killing kids in our very
American streets.  The scary part of this book is it was written in the
50s and predicted what would be happening now.  This is just like some
"Classics Illustrated" type of spiel, for the kids who don't want to
read the book since there's a movie version of it.  And it's only 90
minutes long, so it will cut down some hours of reading.</P>
<P>But trust me, kids, pick up the damn book and read it, 'cause it's
probably much better than this.  But if, like me, you're bored, and it's
on TV somewhere, it's worth a viewing, I guess.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): **</PRE>
