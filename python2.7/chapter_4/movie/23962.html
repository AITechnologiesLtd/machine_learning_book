<P>   Before divorce became so easy to obtain in most states,
Americans who needed to split faster than they could do so
by the Reno route could go to Mexico.  The typical path took
the unhappy marrieds first to El Paso, Texas, where they
spent the night at a hotel (the women often propositioned by
the bellmen), while they crossed a bridge into Ciudad Juarez
in the morning to meet their lawyers and spend a few minutes
in court.  Nowadays, of course, legal splits are so effortless
that some young people enter marriage never expecting a
true commitment since, after all, are anyone's parents still
together?  You could not be blamed for wondering when the
ritual will change, with reverends intoning, "...until divorce do
you part."</P>
<P>   Writer-director Lisa Krueger takes a contrarian view of
marriage vows with "Committed," breaking with the traditional
notion of El Paso as the conventional location of the
penultimate day of a marriage.  Krueger's 1996 debut with
"Manny and Lo" was about a pair of orphaned sisters who
take to the road in an old station wagon and sleep in model
homes, a fresh and warm comedy. Krueger is still as
sympathetic and understanding of her characters, but there is
little freshness in this small, sluggish tale.  A date movie
targeted to twenty-somethings who are contemplating
matrimony, "Committed" serves principally as a showcase for
the talent of Heather Graham, who, after her larger-than-life
role in "Austin Powers II" may have looked for a chance to
strut her stuff in a more modest story.  =</P>
<P>   "Committed," which would fit better on a small screen,
perhaps on a cable network, focuses on Graham in virtually
every scene as the young bride, Joline, who is compulsive
enough to believe in her vow to "love, honor and protect" her
man.  So addicted is she to fidelity--or more accurately to being a
woman of her word--that when her flustered and foggy-
minded photographer husband Carl (Luke Wilson) bolts to the
Texas sticks after 587 days of marriage, she is determined to
locate him, to observe his actions, to protect him from harm,
and to bring him back to his senses. Equipped with just a
trace of a sorcerer's enchantment, she simply tosses his
picture on a map of the U.S. and, bingo, there he is in El
Paso, hiding out in a shack just short of the Mexican border. =</P>
<P>Having "jumped off a cliff," as Joline puts her experience, she
is introduced to adventures that are not promised in even the
most hyped-up travel agency brochures.  Despite her
vows she comes close to pursuing an affair with the charismatic
Neil (Goran Visnjic), who makes pinatas for sale in
neighborhood trade fairs.  She also befriends Carmen (Patricia
Velazquez), a Mexican with a love for anything American.</P>
<P>   We surely need regular doses of correctives for blockbuster
films like "Armageddon," but "Committed" is so soporific that
even the hardiest of Sundance fans might scream for another
showing of "Rules of Engagement" or "U-571."  Casey Affleck
as Joline's phlegmatic brother--a young man who unlike his
sister seems to have no boundaries or desires to commit to
anyone or anything--is meant to be an appealing, laid-back
personality, but comes across instead as a guy who at best
some 23-year-old women might want to mother.  In a
moderately engaging cameo, Alfonso Arau--who directed
"Like Water for Chocolate" and "A Walk in the Clouds"--
performs in the role of a snake-handler with magic powers. =</P>
<P>But if you're going to throw in some magic realism as Arau
did in "Chocolate," you'd best take your cameras to a town
like Sedona, AZ.  Still, not even that burg's red rocks could
bring enchantment to this absolutely ordinary piece.</P>
