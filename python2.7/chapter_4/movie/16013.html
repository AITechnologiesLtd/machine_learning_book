<P>        It's not uncommon for teenagers to think all adults are from
outer space.  It's much less common, however, for them to be correct
in that assumption.</P>
<P>        "The Faculty," the new horror-thriller from director Robert
Rodriguez (El Mariachi, From Dusk Til Dawn) and screenwriter Kevin
Williamson (The "Scream" movies), is an interesting experiment.  A
unique (but not entirely successful) blend of gore, suspense and
comedy, the film plays like a high-speed collision between "Fast Times
at Ridgemont High" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."  The movie
tells the tale of a mysterious alien force which is taking over the
inhabitants of our lovely but ever helpless planet, one person at a
time.  The aliens take over the minds of humans by inserting a
slug-like creature into the victim's ear (opening scene of "Star Trek
II: The Wrath of Khan" anyone?).  But don't worry: six plucky
teenagers are on the case, so it'll all turn out okay in the end.</P>
<P>        These astute young heroes, a varied lot that includes the
geeky Casey (Elijah Wood), walking crack-house Zeke (Hartnett), spooky
goth-gal Stokely (Clea DuVall), school football legend Stan (Shawn
Hatosy), the incredibly sweet but none-too-bright Marybeth (Laura
Harris), and sexy head cheerleader Delilah (Jordana Brewster), are the
first to notice that something strange is happening.  The notoriously
ill-tempered Coach Willis (Robert Patrick, who you'll remember as the
evil terminator from "T2") is suddenly full of smiles and gentleness.
The mousy school principal (Bebe Neuwirth) starts dressing and acting
like a sex goddess.  And the entire faculty chugs enough water each
day to float an ark.  Naturally, the only explanation must be that
aliens are taking over the world.</P>
<P>        You all know I have a soft spot for ridiculously bad horror
films, as my review of "Halloween: H20" no doubt revealed.  It's a
good thing, too, because "The Faculty" is a ridiculously bad film.  As
with "From Dusk Til Dawn," Robert Rodriguez seems totally unsure what
kind of story he's supposed to be telling: a comedy?  Action?
Suspense?  A dark thriller?  Following the "more is better" principle,
he seems determined to throw all of the above into his movie.  The
result is a smorgasbord of different cinematic techniques, all of
which are competently done, yet somehow don't taste particularly good
when mushed up together.  C'mon, Robert, I've seen "El Mariachi."
You, of all people, should know that less can be more.</P>
<P>        If Rodriguez is at fault, however, it's only for being too
ambitious, and trying harder than the material really warrants.  Kevin
Williamson's screenplay makes no such mistake; in fact, it's such a
jumble that at times it seems to be on vacation.  Lacking the wit that
made the two "Scream" films such commercial (and critical) successes,
Williamson here seems to be playing it a little too safe.  His
dialogue lacks the fire and biting satire of his previous work.
Rather than pushing the boundaries of horror, this screenplay seems
firmly rooted in the very situations he mocked so brilliantly in
"Scream" and its excellent sequel.</P>
<P>       This isn't to say that "The Faculty" is without merit, provided
you know what to expect.  The special effects are adequate (though not
spectacular), the acting isn't bad, and the film's pacing is
excellent, a testimony to Rodriguez's directing/editing style.  I
actually had more fun at this film than my review may lead you to
believe.  You might, too, as long as you're not expecting "Citizen
Kane."  Or "Scream," for that matter.</P>
<P>  (If you're a diehard horror fan, add one star to the rating I gave
the film.)</P>
