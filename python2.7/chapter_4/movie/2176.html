<P>BAD BEHAVIOUR could easily be called A FEW DAYS IN THE LIFE OF GERRY AND 
ELLIE McALLISTER if that title was commercially viable.  Set in North 
London, this film is about the trials and tribulations in the McAllister 
household.  Gerry (Stephen Rea), a building planner, is currently working 
on legalizing a local trailer site.  Ellie (Sinead Cusack) works part 
time at a bookstore while also caring for two children and making tea for 
the veritable army of people who parade through her house and her life.  
Among them are her friend Jesse (Clare Higgins), a divorcee whose anger 
at her ex-husband is straining her relationship with her daughter; Howard 
Spink (Philip Jackson), a shady character who's always involved in one 
scam or another; and the Nunn brothers (both played by Phil Daniels), a 
pair of identical twins who are remodeling her bathroom.</P>
<P>Reminiscent in tone, if not content, to Mike Leigh's LIFE IS SWEET, BAD 
BEHAVIOUR can (perhaps unfairly) be pigeonholed into the "slice of life" 
motion picture category.  The film really doesn't go anywhere, but the 
audience experiences an easygoing, amiable ride along the way.  When all 
is said and done, little happens in this movie except that we've gotten 
to know a few interesting and witty characters.  We come in on the story 
long after it's started, and depart long before it's finished.  
Nevertheless, it's highly unlikely that anyone will feel cheated.</P>
<P>At first I thought Stephen Rea was giving a rather lackluster 
performance, but continuing exposure to his Gerry brought a revelation:  
Rea had immersed himself so completely in the role that what I was 
reacting to was Gerry himself - a stodgy, rather uninspiring sort of 
individual.  Likewise, Sinead Cusack dons her part with considerable 
flair.</P>
<P>Most of the humor in BAD BEHAVIOUR is dry, but there are a few instances 
likely to spark laughter (most of which involve Howard or the Nunn 
brothers).  As is usually the case in the best examples of these sorts of 
films, there's an element of poignancy present, but it's neither maudlin 
enough to sidetrack the production, nor overt enough to lead to straight 
melodrama.  Everything is kept in the proper proportion, leading to an 
energetic, entertaining movie-going experience.</P>
<P>Perhaps as interesting as the movie itself is the story of how it was 
brought into being, and how the characters came to be developed.  If the 
writing credit above looks a little odd, it's because director Les Blair 
relied as much upon his cast as himself to develop Gerry, Ellie, and 
friends.  BAD BEHAVIOUR comes close to being an improvisational motion 
picture.</P>
<P>Blair started out with a two-page outline of his story.  Three months 
before the start of principal photography, he held meetings with the 
actors to flesh out their characters.  From there, the writer/director 
developed a 25-page script that described the storyline, but contained no 
dialogue (the characters' lines were developed during the rehearsals).  
Meanwhile, the actors began immersing themselves in their new alter-egos, 
so that when filming began, no transition was necessary.  Rea and Cusack 
had, in a sense, become Gerry and Ellie.</P>
<P>BAD BEHAVIOUR is an intelligent, insightful film that suffers only from 
uneven pacing and an occasional tendency to be too "talky".  Once it gets 
going, the movie is intensely fascinating, but it takes nearly half the 
running length before the audience begins to get a real feel for the 
characters and situations.  BAD BEHAVIOUR's strengths are much more 
apparent than its weaknesses, however, and it's worth a trip to a 
theater.</P>
