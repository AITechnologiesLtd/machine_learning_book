<PRE>Me?  Myself, I Wasn't Crazy about "Me, Myself and
Irene"
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>What's the first warning sign that you're about to
watch dimwitted entertainment?  The answer is when the
program has a narrator that sounds oddly like the guy
who narrated "The Dukes of Hazzard" or the guy who
sings the theme from "The Beverly Hillbillies." 
Here's another question.  What is the filmmaking
Farrelly ("There's Something about Mary") brothers
best known for?  The answer is an incessant desire to
bring gross-out yuckiness to the big screen.   Here's
the final question.  What can you expect from this
film, which combines a doltish sounding narrator with
Farrelly-type material?  The answer is a dimwitted,
gross-out movie that is about as fun and gross as
changing 10-day old kitty litter.</P>
<P>The film features the likeable but milquetoast Charlie
(Jim Carrey) who has been with the Rhode Island police
force for over 18 years.  Despite his badge, uniform
and tenure, he just can't seem to garner any amount of
respect.  That's pretty bad when you're an officer of
the law.  When he asks that a car be moved, the owner
throws him the keys and asks him to move it, to which
Charlie bashfully agrees.  When he tries to ask a
toddler to stop playing in the street, she screams and
scares him off.  The whole town laughs at him, but
Charlie just ignores it all.   He manages to keep the
indignity repressed deep inside.  Even his most
traumatic and heartbreaking experiences are locked
away.  Charlie just swallows hard and graciously
accepts his predicament.</P>
<P>Eventually, his angry side begins to surface.  When
irritated, Charlie slips out of his sissy demeanor and
transforms into Hank, who comprises all of the pent up
heartache, disappointment, and frustration that
Charlie has ever endured but put away.  Charlie avoids
confrontation; Hank invites it (when one is present,
the other is suppressed).  This is where Carrey gets
to have the most fun, but his actions as Hank the
Avenger are more like acts of an overgrown bully.  For
example, he dunks a young girl in a fountain for
talking back, threatens a boy for slurping too loud,
and even steals an ice cream cone from another young
tyke.  Against adults who have slighted him, his
vengeance manifests into acts of wonton crudeness.</P>
<P>His behavior is becoming a liability to the
department, so they assign him to escort a prisoner to
upstate New York.  She's Irene (an adorable Renee
Zellweger) who we later learn is being hunted by her
mob boyfriend.  Irene's only chance of survival might
be Charlie.  But our hero is not mentally capable of
leadership and is constantly fighting a battle against
Hank for control of his body.  Most of the film
centers on this bizarre triangle between Charlie,
Hank, and Irene.</P>
<P>Alas, this becomes a tiresome plot.  The primary
problem is that the film lacks the insight needed to
resolve the inner battle between Charlie and Hank, and
the gags weren't nearly as funny as those bizarre
situations from "There's Something about Mary."  At
least those gags took the audience by surprise.  Here,
the Farrelly brothers are trying to notch the
grossness up one level, but it really borders on
humorless disgust.  The best moments are when Carrey
is allowed to be his limber, silly self.  He's a good
actor who convincingly transitions between his two
altered states.  And Zellweger can do no wrong as the
girl who likes Charlie but is fearful of Hank. 
Ultimately, "Me, Myself and Irene" felt as
out-of-focus as Charlie's schizophrenia. </P>
