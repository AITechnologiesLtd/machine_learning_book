<PRE>                              WIGSTOCK: THE MOVIE
                       A film review by Gary Mrak Morris
                        Copyright 1995 Gary Mrak Morris</PRE>
<P>     It's tempting to complain--so tempting I'm going to do it--that
WIGSTOCK the movie, and the annual New York drag queen musical street
fair it documents--should have been called DRAGSTOCK.  Then it would be
accurate in two senses: drag meaning transvestite, and drag as in "what
a ...."</P>
<P>     Insider views of any subculture have a certain built-in interest;
we want to see how the strategies of oppression brought against
marginalized cultures by the Big Bad "mutha culture" work themselves
out, and conversely, how the Davids of this world (or in this case, the
Girlinas) manage to at least bite the heel of Goliath.</P>
<P>     However, WIGSTOCK, directed by Barry Shils, is like a 1950s
grindhouse revue, stitched together by a core group of drag queens
whose highest aspiration is to shock middle-class sensibilities by
mimicking the June Cleavers and Liza Minnellis of kitsch Broadway/TV
culture.  Drawing almost exclusively on rigid, unpleasant models of
"feminine behavior," they mindlessly lip-synch to third-rate Broadway
tunes and ditties from forgotten camp musicals and bad-girl movies of
the 1940s.  The spontaneity promised by the film's opening pastiche of
WOODSTOCK, with writhing funseekers publicly baring tits and grinning
in a drug-induced haze, collapses under the joyless rigors of
LadyBunny's and her fellow drags' insistence on hiding any talent they
may have under these tiresome, regimented, archaic routines.</P>
<P>     While LadyBunny expresses shock that some--no doubt those with
more than the minimum brain cells required for active thought--have
objected to Wigstock and leads some of the drags in a childish a
capella "Fuck You!," there's little of interest in the event unless you
find thousands of tortured camp hairdos deeply, endlessly fascinating.
Let's face it, there's not much in life less interesting than a wig,
even when the queen wearing it imagines she's busting taboos.  Tell
that to the armies of straight people who flock to movies like LA CAGE
AUX FOLLES.</P>
<P>     There's something disturbingly conformist and self-indulgent in
most of these routines, and relatively little balancing commentary to
give us a sense of personality behind the gaudy camouflage.  Broadway
is the most commonly mined source for the song-and-dance numbers, and
the standout irritant here is Lypsincha, who pontificates about his Art
in bringing back the Pushy Broads of the Great White Way.  There are,
to be fair, a few high points in this realm, most notably the pair of
Tallulah Bankhead imitators--the Dueling Bankheads--whose crazed
rendition of "Born to Be Wild," complete with slinging purses, twisted
liptsticked mouths, and air guitar succeeds on sheer absurd bravado,
something woefully missing from the rest of the numbers.</P>
<P>     There are a few other startling moments that give us a thread of
hope that these queens will someday step out of the 1950s.  L.A.'s cool
fat performance artist Jackie Beat does a screaming, punkish--and
shockingly modern for this crowd--number called "Kiss My Ass!" Jackie's
deglamorized drag--she rips off her wig--should have gotten her
excommunicated from Wigstock.  Her buddy, dolled-up Alexis Arquette,
has an amusing exchange with a couple of straight festival workers.
Then there's the requisite Shocked Old Ladies who view the goings-on
with a mix of disgust, indifference, and indulgence.</P>
<P>     One of the big problems here is that the filmmakers have brought
no sensibility to the proceedings; that is, they just seem to aim and
shoot, so we get few insights beyond the usual vexation some of the
queens feel about not being able to afford a bigger wig, or not being
able to tease one into the stratosphere.  Some of the names are
redolent of camp decades past: Flotilla de Barge, Girlina, Glamazon,
and the inescapable RuPaul, whose 15 minutes are surely up.</P>
<P>     PARIS IS BURNING succeeded brilliantly with some of the same raw
material--the fascinatingly unassimilable drag queen.  The rough edges
of that film showed the combative, struggling side of drag life and
exhibitionism.  Where PARIS IS BURNING's queens emerged as real people
whose lives were comic and tragic in about equal parts, Wigstock's
denizens are dimwitted middle-class party-girl ciphers whose lives
appear to have about as much meaning as the garish wigs they worship.</P>
