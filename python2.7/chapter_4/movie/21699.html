<PRE>BOYS DON'T CRY (Fox Searchlight)
Directed by Kimberly Peirce</PRE>
<P>         Although it's not mentioned in director Kimberly Peirce's
wrenching "Boys Don't Cry," the real-life Brandon Teena worshipped Cher,
the singer-actress who has made a career out of her ability to change
her looks to suit whatever's in fashion. But gimmicks that may work
perfectly for a superstar with a reputation for outrageousness are a
good deal more difficult to pull off in the real world. That proved to
be a lesson Brandon Teena -- who was actually a woman named Teena
Brandon -- learned too late in the game.</P>
<P> "Boys Don't Cry," which takes its title from a classic song by
the Cure, lays out the facts of Teena's bizarre life and horrifying
death frankly but sympathetically. Although Peirce and Hilary Swank, the
amazing actress who plays Teena, don't make apologies for their
subject's reckless behavior, they seem to understand the sexual
confusion and desire to be different that drove a young woman to remake
herself as a male. The movie has to address some fairly shocking subject
matter, but Swank and Peirce refuse to allow Teena's story to become
lurid or titillating. In other, less capable hands, "Boys" could easily
have become either a sleazy piece of exploitation or a sanctimonious
look at how awful the Bible Belt can be towards people who don't follow
the straight and narrow path.</P>
<P> The film introduces us to Teena in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1993,
after her decision to disguise herself as a man. With her hair in a
crew-cut, her chest strapped and a confident swagger in her step,
"Brandon" looks uncannily like an adolescent boy and is so kind towards
the women she dates that such tell-tale signs as her stubble-free face
and her delicate hands go mostly undetected. "They say I'm the best
boyfriend they ever had," Brandon brags to a pal.</P>
<P> But when this dreamy guy is revealed to be female, opinions
change quickly and Brandon flees Lincoln to hide out in the small
Nebraska town of Falls City. There she falls in with ex-cons John (Peter
Sarsgaard) and Tom (Brendan Sexton III), neither of whom suspect there's
anything unusual about him, perhaps because they're usually too drunk or
stoned to pay much attention to anything. "People like you don't need
drugs," Tom laughs as he observes Brandon's urgent desire to fit in with
the kids in Falls City. "You just hallucinate 24 hours a day."</P>
<P> Brandon also attracts the attention of John's former flame Lana
(Chloe Sevigny), the kind of girl who seems to have developed a
bulletproof shell around her heart while still in her teens. Lana, whose
life appears to consist of partying, working on the line in a cannery
and cleaning up after her slovenly mom, finds herself gradually opening
up to the new boy in town. Eventually, their relationship will have
ghastly consequences.</P>
<P> The movie would have fallen flat if we didn't believe in
Brandon's masquerade and kept waiting for the moment when her true
identity would be uncovered. Swank immerses herself so completely in the
character, however, that it's entirely possible to forget you're
watching a woman pass herself off as a man. Peirce assists the illusion
by setting most of the story in poorly-lit bars, shadowy living rooms
and dark backroads and alleyways.</P>
<P> Reportedly, Drew Barrymore was anxious to tackle a different
project about Brandon, one which has since been shut down. That's
probably all for the best, since Barrymore is so easily identifiable she
would have had an extremely difficult time convincing an audience she
was anything more than a renowned movie star attempting a cross-dressing
stunt. Swank, on the other hand, doesn't have to deal with nearly as
many preconceptions (unless you're one of the dozen or so filmgoers who
saw her in "The Karate Kid, Part 4") and slips easily into the crowd.</P>
<P> Although Swank's phenomenal performance is unquestionably the
centerpiece of the film, Peirce gets outstanding work from just about
everyone in her cast. In Sevigny's tortured eyes and rocky voice we
learn everything we need to know about Lana's background and, perhaps,
her future. When Lana naively talks about running away with Brandon and
making a career for herself as a karaoke singer, Sevigny allows us a
brief glimpse of the desperation and need for escape that Lana learned
long ago to suppress.</P>
<P> Sexton, looking like a walking bruise, and Sarsgaard are
chilling as good old boys who are always a breath away from turning into
mindless, raging monsters. The acting is so electrifying it lends the
picture the kind of punch usually found only in documentaries.
Especially in its last half-hour, "Boys Don't Cry" is often
extraordinarily tough to watch -- much in the same way the truth can be
difficult to face. James Sanford</P>
