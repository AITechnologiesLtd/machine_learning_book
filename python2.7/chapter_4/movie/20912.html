<PRE>Never Been Kissed</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Drew Barrymore is a lonely, 25 year old, copy editor for the Chicago
Suntimes. When a sudden firing leaves an undercover reporting job open, her
psycho chief editor impulsively promotes her to the task of impersonating a
17 year old student at Glen South High.</P>
<P>Barrymore is so giddy about playing undercover that she forgets what a
nightmare her own high school experience was. In her naivetZ, she also
neglects to sniff out a spicy hot story with which to quench her fuming
editor.</P>
<P>This is a sappy movie. It knows it is and it doesn't try to hide that fact.
It's also not without implausibilities and moments of bad acting (due in a
large part to her handsome teacher/ love interest). But it's fun. It's silly
teenage "Revenge of the Nerds" fun. And it's spirited. Barrymore's vitality
just won't let you write off this corny picture. She's adorable, charming
and so is her performance as the girl who gets to do high school all over
again.</P>
<P>Starring Drew Barrymore and David Arquette.
Directed by Raja Gosnell.
Produced by Sandy Isaac and Nancy Juvonen at Fox 2000 Pictures.
Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Grade..........................B</P>
