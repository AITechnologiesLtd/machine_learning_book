<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Clay Pigeons" tried hard to be a pleasant comedy/suspense story about a
serial killer and a character study of some small town denizens and the
outsider FBI agents. It worked reasonably well for part of the film, as
dead bodies came popping up unexpectedly in this sleepy Montana town,
but then the story ran out of tricks and everything about the film fell
apart and the psychopathic woman hating slasher, Lester Long (Vaughn),
became a tiresome charge, his maniacal charm just wore out his welcome
on screen, and the film's conclusion lacked tension or purpose and
seemed to be a wasted effort, as it just simply ran out of gas after
about an hour into it.</P>
<P>Since it's a story about clay pigeons- with the singular dictionary
meaning for that slang term, a person in a situation where he can be
taken advantage of by others- the clay pigeon is the town's auto
mechanic, Clay Birdwell (Phoenix), considered by the locals to be a nice
guy, who is out target shooting with his best friend Earl (Sporleder)
when Earl confronts him with the news that his wife Amanda (Coates) told
him she is making love to him, and Earl tells him I can't live with
that. Earl comes up with this crazy idea of shooting himself in the leg
and then killing himself, while framing it so that Clay would be accused
of the crime and have to serve prison time. Clay tells this to the sexy
Amanda, after Earl carries out his plan, as we see her dressed in a see-
through-nightgown, wearing only red panties. But she tells Clay he's on
his own, she wants no one to know about her relationship with him. Our
flawed hero then tows Earl's pickup with him in it and has it go down a
hill to explode, and when his friend, the unassuming Sheriff Mooney
(Scott) comes to investigate, he fails to tell him the whole truth.</P>
<P>While playing a mean game of pool, in a place aptly named Doc Holiday's,
Clay meets an enigmatic and garrulous cowboy, clad in full cowboy gear,
including a fancy stetson. The cowboy, Lester Long, is a stranger in
town and is impressed that Clay slapped Amanda when she tried to seduce
him by the pool table. A friendship between the two develops, leading to
a fishing expedition, where a woman's body, stabbed 7 times, is
discovered floating in the water.</P>
<P>A fatal friendship also develops between Lester and Amanda, as she will
later on be killed  by the psychopath.</P>
<P>But, first the story gets more twisted and unbelievable when Clay
refuses to see Amanda anymore and has sex with a waitress (Nikki) he
picks-up. She is shot while in the middle of her sexual climax with him,
by the jealous and deranged Amanda, knowing Clay is not in a position to
squeal. He is forced to also dispose of this body, which he dumps in the
local lake.</P>
<P>Into the picture comes the FBI, led by the wry-humored agent Dale Shelby
(Janeane Garofalo) and the efficient-looking agent Reynard (Morris), who
are looking at Clay as a possible serial killer. There have been seven
other dead bodies turning up all over Montana that the FBI believes to
be the work of one serial killer. What Garofalo brought to the film at
this point, was some welcomed comic relief, much needed because this
film was exhausted from all the contrivances and lack of adequate
character study it provided. It was only through Garofolo's sense of
black comedy, that the film was still bearable; and, at that, it was
only barely bearable.</P>
<P>Clay is somewhat of an innocent, at least, as far as the murders go, but
he certainly can't be commended for being a truthful person.</P>
<P>Everything gets resolved in the film's anticlimax, that mercifully ends
in an arrest, though some 30 minutes too late, as far as I'm concerned.
What might be likable about this film, to viewers not that discerning
about plot or character study, is that this film was user friendly and
brought about a hearty guffaw or two. None of the actors was bad, bad,
but none were memorable. It's one of those films that is easily
forgotten.</P>
