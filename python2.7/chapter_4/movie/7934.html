<P>     MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is the estrogen alternative to the vast 
quantity of testosterone being pumped out by the other major June 
releases:  CON AIR, SPEED 2, BATMAN AND ROBIN, and FACE/OFF.  As the 
summer's centerpiece romantic comedy, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING boasts a 
pair of A-line actresses, Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz, dueling for 
the affections of the unprepossessing Dermot Mulroney (the guy from 
COPYCAT and THE TRIGGER EFFECT, who is frequently confused with the 
equally low-key and same-initialed Dylan McDermott).  Fortunately, this 
film doesn't fall into the overcrowded category of the traditional 
frothy romance.  In fact, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING has a bit of an edge 
and enough intelligence to keep it from drowning in the kind of mawkish 
sentimentality that often makes this sort of movie hard-to-swallow.  </P>
<P>     Australian director P.J. Hogan must have a thing for movies about 
weddings.  His previous feature, MURIEL'S WEDDING, was a black comedy 
about a young woman who loves ABBA songs and dreams about getting 
married.  And, although Hogan accepted a studio project as his followup 
to the international hit, he chose something in keeping with his desire 
to corrupt the formula.  While this movie isn't as offbeat or "out 
there", it defies more than a few expectations without ultimately 
dissatisfying the audience.</P>
<P>     As in any romantic comedy, the two most important elements are in 
place:  the couples and the complications.  Couple #1 consists of the 
soon-to-be married groom, Michael O'Neal (Mulroney) and his perky bride, 
Kimmy (Diaz).  Couple #2 comprises food critic Julianne Potter (Roberts) 
and her gay editor, George Downes (Rupert Everett).  They're not really 
together, but they pretend to be to make Michael jealous.  Because, for 
the past nine years, since they had a one-month fling in college, 
Julianne has carried a torch for Michael.  They've been best friends, 
but only now, when she's about to lose him to another woman, does 
Julianne realize that she wants to be the bride.  And, to get her man, 
she's willing to do almost anything, including play dirty.  So, when 
Kimmy opens her arms to Julianne and offers her the position of maid of 
honor, Julianne accepts, all the while plotting the best way to break up 
the happy couple. </P>
<P>     Because MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING features a smart script and deft 
direction, it manages to keep alive the mystery of who will end up with 
whom.  Things aren't as clear-cut as they initially seem to be, and, 
with every passing minute, they get murkier.  The film has a high energy 
level and features a number of standout scenes, some of which are 
designed to cull laughter from the audience, others which go for the 
tearducts.  The best is arguably a restaurant episode where an impromptu 
sing-along gets everyone in the place to join in.  It's clever, 
irreverent, and fun.</P>
<P>     MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING starts off slowly, and it takes the better 
part of a half-hour before we first start getting a feel for the 
characters.  Mulroney's Michael is an especially difficult case -- at 
first, there doesn't seem to be much there (which begs the question of 
how he managed to get two beautiful women to fall head-over-heels in 
love with him).  The actor plays his role in a low-key fashion that's an 
asset late in the film, but not at the beginning.  Cameron Diaz turns up 
the good cheer and high spirits to an almost-unbearably lively level.  
And Julia Roberts, returning to the genre that made her a star, embraces 
the part like it's a homecoming.  Her performance as Julianne is 
competent and comfortable, but the ingenue of PRETTY WOMAN has been 
replaced a more mature performer, and this results in a better-rounded 
character.  Supporting players include a scene-stealing Rupert Everett 
(the CEMETERY MAN himself), Rachel Griffiths (who appeared as the title 
character's best friend in MURIEL'S WEDDING), and M. Emmett Walsh as 
someone who's not the least bit creepy (for once).  </P>
<P>     Although MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is intended to be relatively 
light entertainment, it briefly addresses some interesting, serious 
issues regarding the nature of friendship, jealousy, and love (real and 
idealized).  There's a wonderfully evocative scene that suggests "a 
moment passing by," which will undoubtedly cause a portion of the 
audience to reflect on similar occasions in their own lives.  In the 
final analysis, MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING represents two hours of fine 
entertainment not because it offers a feel-good love story but because 
the film makers understand that it's possible for a romantic comedy to 
appeal not only to the heart, but to the mind as well.</P>
