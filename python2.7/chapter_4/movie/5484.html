<PRE>                         MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1993) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        This film marked a comeback of sorts for Woody Allen 
(who's planning a sequel to this movie with Soon-Yi, entitled 
INDIANA INCEST INCIDENT), a solid comedy piece with a dash 
of suspense. The murder mystery begins one night as Woody 
and his wife (Diane Keaton) return from dinner to find their nice 
old neighbor's wife is dead. What's strange is the night before, 
Woody and Diane had dinner over at their place and she seemed 
fine then.</P>
<P>        That's all it takes for Diane to contemplate conspiracy. 
And late that night, when she hears footsteps in the hall of their 
apartment complex, from a person who gets on the elevator. Oooh, 
he must have just killed someone. Woody, meanwhile, is his usual 
uptight, neurotic self, spouting his trademark one-liners. Since 
Woody won't help her out, Diane starts investigating the murder 
with their yuppie friend Alan Alda (just back from a war in Korea). 
This makes Woody kind of mad (you'd be mad too if your name was 
"Woody"), but instead of punching out Alda (as well someone 
should), Woody decides to start investigating the murder with his 
wife for fun.</P>
<P>        Sure, it's not much on paper (especially this paper), but 
trust me, MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY is a good movie. 
Yeah, I know that's what I said about PORKY'S VI and 
OVERWEIGHT TEENAGE SLUMBER PARTY , but this time I'm 
right.</P>
<PRE>--</PRE>
<P>And two brief, bonus reviews of Allen films...
(too short to post separately)</P>
<P>Annie Hall (1977) ****
        This is pretty much the best Woody Allen movie you'll ever 
see. This is the one where he plays the neurotic Jew who has 
troubles with women... yeah, this and about thirty other movies of 
his, but he's just as entertaining as ever here, as a stand-up comic 
who reflects on his life and relationship problems. It's mostly an 
episodic excuse for Woody's trademark one-liners, and I'll be 
damned if the whole movie isn't hilarious.</P>
<P>        Some of the more memorable sequences include Woody 
explaining the source of his nervousness (growing up in a house 
built under the Coney Island roller coaster), Woody being hounded 
by a couple Bronx fans and Woody's marathon viewings of Holocast 
documentaries. Along the way, he meets first Diane Keaton and 
then Shelley Duvall. I personally think the thought of Woody Allen 
and Olive Oyl having sex is inherrently funny, even if Woody's post-
coital comment "I think I'm starting to get the feeling back in my 
jaw" is more than disgusting.</P>
<PRE>--</PRE>
<P>Zelig (1983) ***
        Yes, I admit I only watched this movie so I'd have a "Z" 
review to close out the book with, but upon watching ZELIG, I found 
it was a clever, funny movie. It comes to us from Woody Allen, who 
plays Leonard Zelig, an enigmatic man of the 1920's who was a 
human chameleon, changing races and personalities to match the 
people he was around. Mia Farrow (believe you Mia) is the 
psychiatrist convinced she can cure him. The two start out with a 
professional relationship and move on to a physical one, until he 
runs off with her adopted Korean daughter (one more Soon-Yi joke 
won't kill you).</P>
<P>        ZELIG is told as a black-and-white documentary, with 
Allen mixing old newsreel footage with fake interviews. It's more a 
novelty movie than anything, but Allen still manages to work in a 
few of his trademark one-liners. For instance, during an early 
session with Farrow, he assumes the persona of a doctor, saying, 
"I have to leave now. I teach a course in advanced masturbation at 
the community college and if I don't get there on time, they start 
without me." That's Woody for you.</P>
