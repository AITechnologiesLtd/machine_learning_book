<PRE>                          HANGING WITH THE HOMEBOYS
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1992 Lon Ponschock</PRE>
<P>Directed and Written by Joseph Vasquez
Rated R for extensive use of "street language"</P>
<P>     We saw the trailers for this film as long ago as last summer, if
memory serves, but the show got buried amidst the release of other
larger 'street' films such as BOYZ 'N THE HOOD and NEW JACK CITY.</P>
<P>     That is a shame because, though the teasers would lead one to
believe that this is another show about juveniles with their hats on
backwards, the reality is that HANGING WITH THE HOMEBOYS owes more to
such serious works as the play MARTY done many years ago.</P>
<P>     The film follows four young men, two Black and two Hispanic, on a
Friday night on the town in New York.</P>
<P>     There is much good humor in this film but there is another element
that goes beyond the average "on the town" adventure.  The director, who
also wrote the show and dedicates the film to those of his friends who
inspired it, manages to reveal some uneasy truths.</P>
<P>     A fine ensemble cast including Mario Joyner and John Leguizamo play
off of each other nearly perfectly.  Nestor Serrano is a new name to
film and his character of "Vinny" is memorable.  Watch for this fine
actor in newer films.  Doug E. Doug rounds out the ensemble as a
militant but misguided young man.</P>
<P>     HANGING WITH THE HOMEBOYS gets full recommendation for the kind of
acting and drama which is normally only available to a stage audience.
It is a small film with a lot to say.</P>
