<P>   If there's one bit of advice that every father should give to
his son--counsel even more important than a talk on the birds
and the bees--it's how to make friends.  In the new movie
"Loser," the titular character's dad (Dan Aykroyd) tells his
college-bound son, Paul (Jason Biggs) that the most
important way to do this is to be interested.  When the
person you're talking to sees that you are attentive to what
he has to say, he will consider you to be interesting.  This is
not original advice and in civilized locales, this would work. 
But "Loser" does not take place in a civilized location.  The
movie is set in New York City and what's more the site is a
large college, probably NYU.  Paul, who comes from an
easy-going, small community and who has won a full
scholarship to this big city institution, finds out from the very
first day that dad's advice may not be counterproductive: it's
just that nobody will talk to him.  Why not?  Probably because
he conveys the impression that he's a nice guy and as
country mouse learns about city mouse a couple of months
into his college education, "This whole city is one big orgy
and if you care about someone, you're a chump."</P>
<P>   "Loser," which is directed by Amy Heckerling (whose
"Clueless" is about a young woman whose sophisticated
character is diametrically opposite Paul's), may be predictable
and overly sweet, but after a steady stream of mostly good
movies that try to outdo one another in vulgarity ("American
Pie," "South Park," "Me, Myself and Irene") the picture is a
welcome change as mid-summer approaches--so long as we
don't get a steady stream of cuddly little tales that could as
soon pass muster on TV shows like "Friends."  The
screenplay, also by Ms. Heckerling, does not feature a whole
lot of bon mots, but in the tradition of the cinema the
villain--in this case a handsome, smart, but charmingly
sarcastic professor--gets the best lines.</P>
<P>   By way of comparison, Jim Carrey's character, Charles,
finds out in "Me, Myself and Irene" that being nice is not all
that it's cracked up to be.  If you're congenial, you'll be taken
advantage of, your sweetness all the more tempting to those
who'd eat you for breakfast.  In this case, Paul's warm and
geeky hat may be suitable for Fargo, North Dakota but is as
out of place in the Big Apple as his nerdy haircut.  When he
meets the adorable Dora Diamond (Mena Suvari) who sits
next to him in European Lit., he's hooked, but Dora has eyes
only for her comely professor, Edward Alcott (Greg Kinnear),
who sometimes treats her almost as badly as Paul is treated
by his rich, snotty, and altogether too hip roommates Adam
(Zak Orth), Chris (Tom Sadoski) and Noah (Jimmi Simpson). 
When Paul eventually takes up residence in a veterinary
hospital, his fair-weather pals talk him into letting them use
the facility for a bash at which they pass out the
infamous date-rape pills to naive and trusting co-eds.  The
greater part of the film deals with Paul's uphill battle to prove
that you can be decent without being a doormat.</P>
<P>   Jason Biggs, well cast here (he's the fella who last year
mistook an apple pie for a sexy woman), turns in a fine
performance as the guy who never loses his congeniality but
does become a bit stonier in his ways under the pressures of
his first year at college while Mena Suvari, who could pass
for a young Liza Minelli, is amiable enough.  Greg Kinnear as
the elitist professor stands out: he's the sort who would have
the populists, especially the young people, in the audience
hissing, but I like the guy.  He stands firm in his
championship of the best and brightest and is appropriately
ticked off when he discovers that virtually nobody in his 160-
member lecture class has read the Kafka assignment or has
understood the text enough to deal with the principal theme. 
When he visits a museum with his co-ed, he appropriate
patronizes her for thinking that there is nothing particularly
more beautiful about a Van Gogh or Greek column than there
is in, say, some Christmas decorations.  </P>
<P>   "Loser" is a date movie suitable for dates who can
appreciate "American Pie" as much as I do but still like to
indulge themselves in a confection which proves that a kid
from the sticks can make it in New York without giving up his
decency.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 98 minutes.  (C) 2000
