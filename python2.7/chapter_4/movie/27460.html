RATCATCHER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>RATCATCHER, the first feature film by writer and director Lynne Ramsay, 
could have been called BLEAK AND BLEAKER.  Unrelentingly downbeat, it 
tells a story of a family stuck in a miserable existence in the Glasgow 
slums.  Although the family lives in dire conditions, the movie is never 
able to define any of its characters enough for us to care about their 
plight.  With this rambling movie, which is only slightly better 
organized than a home video, Ramsay demonstrates almost no ability at 
storytelling.  When the inevitable tragic ending occurs, you almost have 
to stop yourself from applauding since you are so glad to get this waste 
of time over with.</P>
<P>As the story starts, James, a young lad of about 12, is involved in some 
innocent horseplay beside a canal.  His companion, Ryan, is accidentally 
drowned in the process.  James is played without one scintilla of 
emotion by William Eadie, who had never acted before being chosen for 
the part.  It shows.  Playing the central character, Eadie is asked to 
carry the movie, a task of which he is totally incapable.</P>
<P>The rest of James's family are walking clichés.  His father (Tommy 
Flanagan), for example, is a drunk who passes out frequently, causing 
him to drool on the living room sofa.  The wife is the canonical 
long-suffering type who stands by her man.  The only character of any 
interest in the story is a neighborhood girl named Margaret Anne (Leanne 
Mullen), who dispenses sexual favors to everyone for unexplained 
reasons, possibly in a failed attempt to be liked.  The character has 
potential, but Mullen's lifeless performance doesn't do much with it.</P>
<P>As the characters go from tedious tribulation to tribulation, I found 
myself passing the time by observing how Scottish English differs from 
American English.  The subtitling for the film doesn't try to translate 
the words.  It just records them to make them more intelligible for 
American audiences.  Among other words I found fascinating were: heid, 
innit and frae.</P>
<P>My wife said it best.  "The depressing thing about this movie is that it 
isn't depressing," she remarked, shaking her head, as we left the 
theater.  With circumstances this tragic, we should feel sad, but we 
don't because the movie is so poorly constructed and the acting so 
incredibly bland.</P>
<P>RATCATCHER runs a long 1:33.  It is not rated but would be an R for 
sexual situations, nudity, violence and language.  It would be 
acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
