<P>        In the opening scenes of Andre Techine's `Thieves' (Les Voleurs), a
young boy, wakened by voices late at night, finds that his father,
Ivan,  has been killed under mysterious circumstances.  The next day,
his father's estranged brother, Alex, arrives for the funeral with his
girlfriend, Juliette. Juliette chooses to stay outside the house,
explaining that she doesn't know the family inside. But when she thinks
no one is watching, the boy, Justin, steals a glimpse of  Juliette
planting a kiss on the forehead of his father's corpse.</P>
<P>The mysteries of Ivan's death and what the boy sees are gradually
revealed in Andre Techine's powerful and enigmatic film. In a narrative
style that shares similarities with Atom Egoyan and Kristof Kieslowski,
Techine weaves together a complex yet easily followed tale that jumps
back and forth between multiple narrators and  time periods
over the course of a year leading up to and following Ivan's death. 
Ultimately, the plot mysteries are resolved, while leaving the much
deeper mysteries about the relationships that unite and divide the
film's central characters.</P>
<P>The film's title refers most literally to Ivan and his circle of
accomplices, who run a petty criminal operation out of Lyons that
involves shipping stolen cars to the Middle East.  One of his young gang
members, Jimmy, has a sister, Juliette (Laurence Cote), a street-tough
girl in her late teens torn pulled three strongly conflicting
influences: her brother and Ivan and their life of crime; her female
lover, Marie (Catherine Deneuve), a professor of philosophy at the
college Jimmy pays for her to attend, and her male lover, Alex (Daniel
Auteuil), a world-weary detective whose beat is the crime-ridden urban
projects of Lyons. Juliette's ambiguous sexuality and gender (she is
repeatedly mistaken for a boy) nicely represent a world where things are
never quite as they appear.</P>
<P>As the story unfolds, we enter into a tightly-weaven web of 
complicated rivalries and alliances.  Alex and Juliette first meet when
she is brought before him on shoplifting charges.  When he discovers her
ties with the brother he has long despised, they begin a sexual
relationship that begins with mutual contempt, but for Alex at least,
slowly and tentatively evolves into something more.  Alex keeps himself
so well proected from intimacy that he insists they remain almost fully
clothed during sex.  She remains so much a part of her upbringing that
she refuses to step foot into a cop's apartment. Yet Alex's attachment
to Juliette grows to the point where he chooses to endanger his career
so at not to risk implicating her in the events surrounding his
brother's death.</P>
<P>Concern for Juliette's well-being creates an equally unlikely bond
between Alex and her other lover, Marie.  Unlike Alex, who comes to
cherish what Juliette offers him yet retains a profoundly cynical and
anti-romantic view of human nature, Marie falls deeply in love with her
young pupil.  Where we are shown Alex and Juliette engaged in rough and
dirty intercourse in a hotel, Marie and Juliette share a sensuous, naked
bath in Marie's apartment. Yet if Juliette and Alex are thwarted by
being on opposite sides of the law, there is an equally great distance
separating Marie's romanticism and Juliette's hard-edged despair. When
Juliette is forced to flee Lyons, a devastated Marie abandons her job
and commits herself to writing Juliette's story.  Eventually, Marie
chooses to leave Alex with the responsibility of preserving Juliette's
legacy.</P>
<P>The Alex-Juliette-Marie triangle is only one of several struggles that
`Thieves' explores. There is also a variation on the classic battle
between two brothers who stand on opposite sides of the thin line of the
law. In this case, it is Alex, the cop, who is
ostracized from a family which sees upholding the law as a crime. When
Alex tries to connect with his young nephew after Ivan's death, the
boy frankly explains that he has no desire to hang out with a policeman.
Despite his father's violent end, it is clear that Justin sides with the
thieves.</P>
<P>`Thieves' is a provocative and rewarding film that steers far away from
simple and contrived messages. Techine demands of the audience that we
decide for ourselves what the film is about and what it has to tell us. 
While depriving us of pat linear storylines and a happy resolution, the
joy of viewing intelligent filmmaking and first-rate performances is
more than enough to make `Thieves' a rare cinematic pleasure.</P>
