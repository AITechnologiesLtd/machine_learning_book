<P>     If you love movies, it's impossible not to appreciate CINEMA 
PARADISO, Giuseppe Tornatore's heartwarming, nostalgic look at one man's 
love affair with film, and the story of a very special friendship.  
Affecting (but not cloying) and sentimental (but not sappy), CINEMA 
PARADISO is the kind of motion picture that can brighten up a gloomy day 
and bring a smile to the lips of the most taciturn individual.  Light 
and romantic, this fantasy is tinged with just enough realism to make us 
believe in its magic, even as we are enraptured by its spell.</P>
<P>     Most of CINEMA PARADISO is told through flashbacks.  As the film 
opens, we meet Salvatore (Jacques Perrin), a famous director, who has 
just received the news that an old friend has died.  Before departing 
for his home village of Giancaldo the next morning to attend the 
funeral, he reminisces about his childhood and adolescence, thinking 
back to places and people he hasn't seen for decades.</P>
<P>     As a fatherless child, Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio) loved the 
movies.  He would abscond with the milk money to buy admission to a 
matinee showing at the local theater, a small place called the Cinema 
Paradiso.  Raised on an eclectic fare that included offerings from such 
diverse sources as Akira Kurosawa, Jean Renoir, John Wayne, and Charlie 
Chaplin, Salvatore grew to appreciate all kinds of film.  The Paradiso 
became his home, and the movies, his parents.  Eventually, he developed 
a friendship with the projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a lively 
middle-aged man who offered advice on life, romance, and how to run a 
movie theater.  Salvatore worked as Alfredo's unpaid apprentice until 
the day the Paradiso burned down.  When a new cinema was erected on the 
same site, an adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) became the 
projectionist.  But Alfredo, now blind because of injuries sustained in 
the fire, remained in the background, filling the role of confidante and 
mentor to the boy he loved like a son.</P>
<P>     CINEMA PARADISO's first half, with Salvatore Cascio playing the 
young protagonist, is the superior portion.  The boy's experiences in 
the theater, watching movies and listening to Alfredo's stories, form a 
kind of journey of discovery.  As Salvatore cultivates his love of 
movies, those in the audience are prodded to recall the personal meaning 
of film.  It's an evocative and powerful experience that will touch 
lovers of motion pictures more deeply than it will casual movie-goers.</P>
<P>     Once Salvatore has grown into his teens, CINEMA PARADISO shifts 
from being a nostalgic celebration of movies to a traditional coming-of-
age drama, complete with romantic disappointment and elation.  Salvatore 
falls for a girl named Elena (Agnese Nano), but his deeply-felt passion 
isn't reciprocated.  So he agonizes over the situation, seeks out 
Alfredo's advice, then makes a bold decision:  he will stand outside of 
Elena's window every night until she relents.  In the end, love wins 
out, but Salvatore's joy is eventually replaced by sadness as Elena 
vanishes forever from his life.</P>
<P>     The Screen Kiss is important to CINEMA PARADISO.  Early in the 
film, the local priest previews each movie before it is available for 
public consumption, using the power of his office to demand that all 
scenes of kissing be edited out.  By the time the new Paradiso opens, 
however, things have changed.  The priest no longer goes to the movies 
and kisses aren't censored.  Much later, following the funeral near the 
end of CINEMA PARADISO, Salvatore receives his bequest from Alfredo:  a 
film reel containing all of the kisses removed from the movies shown at 
the Paradiso over the years.  It's perhaps the greatest montage of 
motion picture kisses ever assembled, and, as Salvatore watches it, 
tears come to his eyes.  The deluge of concentrated ardor acts as a 
forceful reminder of the simple-yet-profound passion that has been 
absent from his life since he lost touch with his one true love, Elena.  
It's a profoundly moving moment -- one of many that CINEMA PARADISO 
offers.</P>
<P>     Is CINEMA PARADISO manipulative?  Manifestly so, but Tornatore 
displays such skill in the way he excites our emotions that we don't 
care.  This film is sometimes funny, sometimes joyful, and sometimes 
poignant, but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying.  CINEMA 
PARADISO affects us on many levels, but its strongest connection is with 
our memories.  We relate to Salvatore's story not just because he's a 
likable character, but because we relive our own childhood movie 
experiences through him.  Who doesn't remember the first time they sat 
in a theater, eagerly awaiting the lights to dim?  There has always been 
a certain magic associated with the simple act of projecting a movie on 
a screen.  Tornatore taps into this mystique, and that, more than 
anything else, is why CINEMA PARADISO is a great motion picture.</P>
