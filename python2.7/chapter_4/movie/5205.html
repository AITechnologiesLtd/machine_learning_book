<PRE>                                  MY GIRL
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  **1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1991)</PRE>
<P>        MY GIRL ultimately takes you on a road to nowhere, but at least the
ride there is reasonably pleasant.  Anna Chlumsky plays a precocious
11-year-old who's obsessed with death: her mother died in childbirth and
her father is a mortician--their house doubles as a funeral home.  Chlumsky
spends her time hanging out with best pal Macaulay Culkin (HOME ALONE),
while her inattentive father (Dan Aykroyd) embarks on an unlikely romance
with beautician Jamie Lee Curtis.  Over the course of the movie, Chlumsky
comes to terms with death and learns to accept Curtis as a mother figure.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, this paper-thin premise doesn't lead to anything
meaningful.  For starters, the performances are perfunctory.  It's hard to
blame the actors, however, when their characters are so underwritten.  The
movie fails to harvest the talents of Curtis and Culkin, though Griffin
Dunne is appealing as Chlumsky's English teacher.  A bigger problem: the
dramatic scenes, which should have been sensitive and heartfelt, are
heavy-handed and cliched.  MY GIRL does eventually wear you down with its
histrionics, but you feel resentful for having your tears jerked so
violently from you.</P>
