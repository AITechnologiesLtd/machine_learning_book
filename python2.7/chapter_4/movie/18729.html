<P>The topic of celebrity is one of much debate in this
entertainment-obsessed decade. Should celebrities recieve different
treatment than "regular" people? Well, regardless of whether they
should or shouldn't, they do, and Roger Mitchell's "Notting Hill"
examines the relationship between the world's most famous actress and
a "normal" bookshop owner in a section of London called Notting Hill.</P>
<P>Living in Los Angeles, I have had many celebrity encounters, and my
experiences have usually been somehwat similar. When you first see the
celebrity, you feel a rush that leaves you breathless for a couple
seconds. As you talk to the person, the newness will wear off; the
speed depending on how down-to-earth the celebrity is. However, when
the person leaves, you end up regretting either asking too much or
asking too little. Therefore, a romance between a celebrity and an
everyman can be a whirlwind.</P>
<P>In "Notting Hill", William Thacker(Hugh Grant) first meets Anna
Scott(Julia Roberts) when she visits his travel bookshop, arguably the
least successful store in Notting Hill. A series of coincidences leads
her to his flat, where they share a passionate kiss.  William isn't
sure what to make of the kiss, since Anna had, at first, come off as
arrogant and selfish.</P>
<P>>From that moment on, their relationship has its ups and downs, as
William learns that dating a celebrity is tough work. She loves him
only for the fact that he is something ordinary in a hectic
lifestyle. He loves her because, well...she's the world's biggest
movie star.</P>
<P>"Notting Hill" is well-written for the most part(despite its
predictability), but it is the acting that keeps everything real. Hugh
Grant once again perfects his charming loser act, and Julia Roberts
was born to play this role; a role that isn't much different than her
real life. The supporting cast is wondrous, led by Rhys Ifans("Dancing
At Lughnasa") as William's roommate and newcomer Emma Chambers as
William's sister. The acting more than makes up for the very
conventional wedding.</P>
<P>"Notting Hill" is the first film after Woody Allen's "Celebrity" to
accurately examine the celebrity lifestyle, and it's a topic that
deserves to be looked at in cinema, even if the film is being done by
the people it is examining. I'd like to see a film that(a la "The
Player") looks at celebrity life with sardonic wit and a cynical point
of view. "Notting Hill" isn't that kind of film, but it's a charming,
funny romantic-comedy.</P>
