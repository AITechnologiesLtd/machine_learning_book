<P>In the wake of "Gremlins" and its myriad rip-offs came this very funny horror 
comedy, for a lack of a better description. It is quick (at a full-throttle 
86 minutes), clever, self-parodic, and just plain delightful from first frame 
to last. </P>
<P>The story begins in outer space on some floating prison ship, housing 
fugitives known simply as the Cripes, who are to be transported to some 
asteroid. The Cripes somehow escape on the ship and head for Earth (aliens 
just love our home planet), while two bounty hunters dressed in almost 
Western garb, a combination of long trenchcoats and pointed boots, search for 
them. They also have to change their nondescript appearances to human form. </P>
<P>Flash forward to the typical American farmlands of Kansas where a nice 
American family live, consisting of the farmer, Jay Brown (Billy Green Bush), 
his housecleaning wife, Helen (Dee Wallace Stone), the presumptious son, Brad 
(Scott Grimes) who loves using his slingshot, and the sister he constantly 
fights with, April (Nadine Van Der Velde), who has the hots for the local 
handsome teen male, played by none other than Billy Zane!  </P>
<P>The town is full of the usual cast of denizens, including the local sheriff 
(the terrific M. Emmet Walsh) and the village idiot (Don Opper), who believes 
aliens will invade Earth (he of course was once attacked by an alien). But an 
invasion is imminent as a spaceship lands in the farmlands, and a host of 
furballs start killing livestock, and basically they try to eat their way 
through dear old Kansas. They are of course the Cripes, a crew of furball 
monsters that have razor sharp teeth and use sleep-inducing (or perhaps 
poisonous) darts that shoot from their heads.  They attack the farmer's 
family, and most of the town itself. Naturally, the bounty hunters finally 
land on Earth and cause their own havoc with their enormous guns blasting 
everything in sight (including churches and bowling alleys) as they search 
for the Cripes.</P>
<P>"Critters" is lots of fun, inducing more laughs than scares but of course, 
this is no serious horror flick. In a comical scene, Brad spots a silhouette 
of a Critter growing to mammoth proportions. I also like how one of the 
Critters utters the F curse, or how one plucks the eyes off of an E.T. doll. </P>
<P>The scenes at the beginning are the best as we see how this oblivious 
American family lives. I love the moment where Dee Wallace smiles in 
recognition as her daughter speaks to her boyfriend, which leads to a dinner 
scene with the family and the boyfriend. As the sweet couple leaves for 
literally a romp in the hay, the patriarch Jay asks his wife: "Have you ever 
told April about...you know?" She responds: "Years ago." Moments like that, 
and there are several featuring the sly Grimes, gives a sense of humanity to 
the characters. They are not cartoonish types, though the movie is one big 
cartoon spectacle. </P>
<P>It also helps that veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh (the slimy, corrupt 
detective in "Blood Simple") and Don Opper (memorable as the title character 
in "Android") were cast, lending plenty of humorous asides throughout. 
"Critters" is a guilty pleasure, but full of smiles and knowing references to 
the B-movies of the past. It would make a great double-feature with "Mars 
Attacks!"</P>
