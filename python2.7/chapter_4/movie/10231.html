RUNNING ON EMPTY
----------------
(USA 1987)</PRE>
<P>Director: Sidney Lumet
Original Screenplay: Naomi Foner
Director of Photography: Gerry Fisher
Music: Tony Mottola
Editor: Andrew Mondshein
With River Phoenix, Christine Lahti, Judd Hirsch, Martha Plimpton, Jonas Abry,
Ed Crowley, L.M. Kit Carson, Steven Hill, Augusta Dabney</P>
<P>Sidney Lumet is one of my favourite directors. It's not difficult to forget
that some of his films aren't great ("The Appointment", "The Last of the Mobile
Hotshots", "The Morning After", "A Stranger Among Us", "Guilty as Sin"),
because there are many superb motion pictures among his films, like "Twelve
Angry Men", "Long Day's Journey Into Night", "The Pawnbroker", "Serpico",
"Dog Day Afternoon", "Network", "Prince of the City", "The Verdict", the often
underrated "Q & A" and this excellent drama "RUNNING ON EMPTY".</P>
<P>In 1971, when they were radical students, Arthur and Annie Pope (Judd Hirsch,
Christine Lahti) committed a bomb attack on a napalm laboratory to stop the war
in Vietnam. Therefore they have been on the run for 15 years, chased by the
FBI. Now they have two sons, 17-year-old Danny
(River Phoenix) and 10-year-old Harry (Jonas Abry), who must share their
parents' destiny.
In the first scenes of the film the Pope family must again change home and
identities - as many times before. Now Danny falls in love
for Lorna Phillips (Martha Plimpton), the daughter of his music teacher
(Ed Crowley), who discovers Danny's musical talent and gets him to apply
for a study at Juilliard School. But that would destroy the
family. Danny gets into an inner conflict. On the one hand there are his
love to Lorna and his wish to live his own life. On the other hand he
wants to support his adored parents. When they notice that
conflict, they don't know what to do either.</P>
<P>With "RUNNING ON EMPTY" Sidney Lumet returns to the theme he has already
treated in his film "Daniel" (1983). Lumet and his screenwriter Naomi
Foner didn't want to make a political film in the first place. They
wanted to show how children can be affected by the activities of their
parents, and it's a film about the problems of families if the children
want to leave home. Actually it would have been imaginable to treat this
theme in front of a non-political background. But the political aspects
enrich the film and stimulate us to discuss about what's more important:
to change the world with dangerous actions or also to remember the
consequences of these actions not only for one's own life, but for the
lives of one's children too.</P>
<P>By his quiet and sensitive direction Sidney Lumet creates a high inner
suspense. And all the actors are - as usual in a Lumet film - excellent,
especially River Phoenix, who earned a well deserved Academy Award
nomination for his masterful performance (maybe the best in his much too
short life), and Christine Lahti. Another remarkable point is the well
considered editing with an apt use of dissolves and cuts.</P>
<P>This is one of the best films I've seen up to now, a movie that you
mustn't miss.</P>
<P>My rating: ***** out of ***** (A MASTERPIECE)</P>
