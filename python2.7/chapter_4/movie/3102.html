<P>     The new Ivan Reitman/Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy is a one-joke
affair, and it takes surprisingly little time for the potential humor
in the situation to wear thin.  As a result, the viewer is left with
about ninety minutes of suffering through Schwarzenegger's attempts to
act--certainly not his strong suit.  Put simply, JUNIOR demands more
range from its leading man than he's capable of giving.  The
predictable result is a big-budget mess more likely to elicit groans
than laughter.</P>
<P>     Even suspending all semblance of disbelief doesn't make this film
work.  It is so poorly-constructed that a viewer has to go into a
catatonic state to appreciate what's happening on screen.  You don't
expect high art from a Reitman production, especially when Arnold is
the big draw, but this kind of unrepentant idiocy is unforgivable.
TWINS and KINDERGARTEN COP weren't great movies, but they had a lot
more going for them.</P>
<P>     The story revolves around the fertility team of Alexander Hesse
(Schwarzenegger) and his diminutive partner, Larry Arbogast (Danny
DeVito).  These two don't really like each other, but each is willing
to put up with a lot for the sake of their research--a new wonder drug
designed to reduce, if not eliminate, miscarriages.  However, when the
drug doesn't obtain FDA approval, Hesse and Arbogast are displaced from
their laboratory so that the space can be given to Dr. Diana Reddin
(Emma Thompson), whose work involves frozen eggs.  Undaunted, the two
scientists decide to continue their experiments, this time using a
human test case.  So, after some prompting from his partner, Hesse
fertilizes one of Reddin's cryogenically-preserved eggs and implants it
in his abdominal cavity.  Now, he's pregnant. (Does that make him
daddy, mommy, or both?)</P>
<P>     I won't deny that the premise has comic potential, albeit of an
unsophisticated sort.  The problem is that the trite script fails to
capitalize on opportunities, relying instead on worn-out cliches and
jokes that are, for the most part, unfunny (there are a few notable
exceptions--I do admit to laughing a few times).</P>
<P>     JUNIOR contains a couple of pointless subplots that serve only to
stretch the running length to an almost-unendurable one-hundred nine
minutes.  The first involves the machinations of an underhanded
character (played by Frank Langella) to use this unorthodox experiment
for his own gain.  The second focuses on Hesse's stay at a maternity
retreat, where he's forced to dress in women's clothes.  Those that
appreciate raw crossdressing humor would do better to view THE
ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (although I suppose
there's some appeal in watching Schwarzenegger, looking like a beached
whale, in a frock).</P>
<P>     The only good thing about JUNIOR is Emma Thompson, but she's far
from sufficient to save the film.  Her comic aptitude is hardly new
(remember THE TALL GUY?), but it may come as something of a surprise
for those who remember her from only HOWARDS END, THE REMAINS OF THE
DAY, and MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.</P>
<P>     It's astounding how inconsistent Ivan Reitman's work is--the same
man responsible for such enjoyable films as DAVE and GHOSTBUSTERS also
has the dog of a movie BEETHOVEN on his resume.  Now, there's JUNIOR,
which, in a way, has a subject matter appropriate to its dubious
quality.  After all, eduring Arnold's labor pains, and all that leads
up to them, is something of a painful labor.</P>
