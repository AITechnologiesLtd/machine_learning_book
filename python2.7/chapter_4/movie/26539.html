<PRE>"Dancer in the Dark"  -- Storytelling of a Different
Tune
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"In a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens," says
the wispy-voiced, diminutive Selma (played by
Icelandic diva, Bjork).  You can feel the pain that
occupies her mind and see the glint of desperation
that glosses over her eyes.  Her life is
unquestionably grim as she slaves away in a metal
factory.  </P>
<P>To escape from reality, she conjures up fantasies of
elaborate musical numbers set to the rhythm and beat
of ambient sounds of her environment (the humming of
machinery or the clacking of a passing railroad). 
It's all she can do to keep her sanity.  She wishes
that her life could be filled with the same kind of
gaiety that characterizes those kinds of musical
productions.  But her reality is filled with a general
sense of gloom and despair.  Her inner strength is
slowly waning, eroding against the tide of hardships
that have mercilessly chipped away at her soul.  She,
with the doll-like appearance and romanticist
disposition, is much too sweet to be dealt such a
cruel fate.  But in this depressing, angst-drenched
tale of a woman's life turned upside-down, seldom will
you find things to smile about.</P>
<P>"Dancer in the Dark" introduces us to Selma, a woman
who, at first, is filled with hope in the way that
fountains are filled with water.  Yet, even water
evaporates over time.  She suffers from a hereditary
ailment that is causing her to go blind.  Her son will
also succumb to its effects, but Selma works extra
hard to save enough money to pay for an operation to
save her son's vision.  But 
Selma's failing eyesight creates all kinds of
dangerous situations.  Maybe she'll become injured
working the heavy machinery.  Or perhaps, she won't be
able to get out of the way of an oncoming car or
train.  There is an overhanging sense of impending
danger.</P>
<P>As her eyesight worsens, so too does her situation. 
After a series of costly mistakes, her employer fires
her.  Her warm-hearted, yet careworn landlord (David
Morse) confesses that he's going bankrupt.  He asks
Selma for a small loan.  It saddens her that she can
not help.  The money is for her son's operation.  Her
meager savings are all that she has.  Without it, her
world would collapse.  However, her string of
unfortunate events continues, spiraling this film
towards its tragic denouement.</P>
<P>There are several notable elements that justify the
praise it received at the Cannes Film Festival, for
which it won best picture.  Bjork is confident in her
role, emoting the kind of feelings (her personal
losses, her devotion to her son, her inner fight to
deflect the pressure that is building upon her) that
endears us to her plight.  David Morse also turns in a
fine understated performance.  And, the inclusion of
the musical numbers (composed and performed by Bjork)
was unique.  However, this is not a musical in the
style of "The Sound of Music" or even "South Park:
Bigger, Louder & Uncut" was.  Rather, these numbers
are merely manifestations of Selma's daydreaming. 
They are unique elements of the film, but not an
essential component.</P>
<P>The real complaint lies within its headache-inducing
camerawork.  For most of the scenes, the director opts
for handheld cameras (the dance sequences use
stationary ones).  Thus, many of the scenes look
choppy as if you were looking at a home movie. 
Another huge distraction was that there were frequent,
excruciatingly close close-ups.  If Bjork had any
freckles, you could count each one.  Also, during an
exchange of dialogue, the camera would continuously
pan left and right as each person spoke.  It was like
watching a tennis match.  You are forewarned to sit in
the back of the theatre to minimize any potential
motion sickness.  </P>
<P>Film buffs will undoubtedly not want to miss this
unique offering.  It's a bold movie with several nervy
ideas.  But, given its disheartening theme, this film
can only put you in a sad mood for the rest of the
week.</P>
