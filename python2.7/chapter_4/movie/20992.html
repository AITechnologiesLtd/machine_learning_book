<P>PLANET SICK-BOY: <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>Just thinking about the opening sequence of Steven Soderbergh's latest
film gives me major chills.  The screen is pitch-black and you can only
hear a man with a very raspy and very frightening voice demand `Tell
me…tell me…tell me about Jenny,' before it launches into the opening
credits, where The Who play `The Seeker.'  Start a movie like this and
you'll have me in the palm of your hand every time.</P>
<P>The voice belongs to a hard-edged Brit named Wilson (Terence Stamp,
Episode One), who has just served a nine-year prison sentence for
`wealth redistribution.'  Wilson is headed to Los Angeles in an attempt
to learn more about the death of his daughter Jennifer (Melissa George,
ROAR), who was killed in a car crash on the famed Mulholland
thoroughfare.  The cops believed the crash to be accidental, but Wilson
suspects foul play after receiving a letter in the clink that his
daughter really died under mysterious circumstances.  He has little to
go on – just the name and address of the man that sent the letter.</P>
<P>The opening credits show a very effective, choppy montage of Wilson on
the plane, in the airport, in a cab and in his hotel.  He seems to
become more enraged the closer he gets to LA, pacing the floor of his
hotel like a crazed tiger and smoking like it's going out of style.  He
begins his investigation with Ed (Luis Guzmán, OZ), a Latino who took
acting classes with Jenny and the author of the letter.  Ed can only
give Wilson the name of Jenny's last boyfriend, adding that he may be
able to find more information at a truck warehouse in a deserted section
of the city.</P>
<P>Before heading to the warehouse, Wilson stops off at a grammar school to
stock up on firearms.  He finds the warehouse and charges in like a bull
in a china shop, only to end up badly beaten and bloodied on the curb of
the shady business.  But Wilson doesn't give up easily and manages to
track down Jenny's acting/voice coach Elaine (Lesley Ann Warren,
Teaching Mrs. Tingle).  He eventually finds his daughter's ex, a wealthy
record producer named Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda, The Tempest).</P>
<P>While Wilson is shown blazing a trail through the seedy crime world of
Los Angeles, Soderbergh (Out of Sight) deftly edits clips of a nearly
unrecognizable Stamp in a 1967 Ken Loach film called Poor Cow, showing
the arc of Wilson's character as he moves from peace-loving hippie to
vengeful criminal.  Adding to The Limey's nostalgia is Valentine, who
made a name for himself during the ‘60s music scene and openly longs for
a return to those simpler times.  The casting of Stamp and Fonda is even
a bit nostalgic, as is the closing display, where a much mellower Stamp
covers Donovan's `Colours' in a scene taken from Poor Cow.</P>
<P>Soderbergh's direction is top-notch, showing cleverly edited scenes
repeatedly flashed forward and back (a la Homicide) and refusing to shy
away from the film's violence.  Credit cinematographer Edward Lachman
and editor Sarah Flack for creating a believable look to the picture.
Written by Dark City scribe Lem Dobbs, The Limey is also chock full of
fantastic acting, especially Stamp and Barry Newman (Bowfinger), who has
a wonderful supporting role as Valentine's bad-ass right-hand man.  The
music is fantastic and the film even shows Soderbergh's Out of Sight
alumni George Clooney in an `Access Hollywood' spoof.</P>
<P>In short, The Limey is a fantastic crime thriller.  My only complaint is
that it wasn't longer.</P>
<P>1:30 - R for mega-violence, adult situations and language</P>
