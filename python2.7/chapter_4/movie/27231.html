DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>Jeremy Irons (Academy Award-winner for REVERSAL OF FORTUNE), we didn't 
know you had it in you.  When you go slumming, as you do in Courtney 
Solomon's DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, your acting is not just merely awful but a 
major league stinkeroo.  </P>
<P>Assuming you're not destitute and it isn't your evil twin in the 
picture, the only possible explanation left is that your work in the 
movie is one big inside joke.  With your snarls and exaggerations, you 
chew up the scenery with crude abandon.  You must hope that any film 
this bad has to become a cult classic, and that, if it does, your part 
in it will eventually be seen as a huge spoof.  Someday you can tell the 
movie magazines that you intentionally tried to see just how terrible 
you could be.  Watching you is such an embarrassment that I hope your 
strategy proves correct.  I refuse to assume that you acted this 
pathetically unless it was on purpose.  </P>
<P>To be fair, the performance by Thora Birch (Academy Award nominee for 
AMERICAN BEAUTY) is not much better.  Looking like a little girl playing 
dress up, she delivers her lines with such awkwardness that she would be 
rejected for a community theater production.</P>
<P>The minimal plot, set in medieval times, involves the control of dragons 
and the saving of the empire.  With ugly and clunky special effects, the 
picture is no joy to watch.  </P>
<P>"Please help me!" asks a character with iridescent blue lipstick played 
by Bruce Payne.  He appears to want to be put out of his misery.  Where 
is the bubonic plague when you need it? I wanted them all to die and the 
sooner, the better.</P>
<P>DUNGEONS & DRAGONS runs a long 1:45.  It is rated PG-13 for fantasy 
action violence and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, and some of his classmates who saw the film with 
him really liked it.  They thought it started slow, but the maze and the 
fighting scenes were awesome and the special effects were cool.  Their 
ratings were pretty high: **** (Jeffrey, Steven, Kyle and Sam), *** 1/2 
(Alan), *** (Nick) and ** 1/2 (John).</P>
