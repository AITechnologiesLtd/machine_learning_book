<PRE>Bubble Explodes</PRE>
<PRE>Review of Little Voice (1998)</PRE>
<P>Seen on 4 December 1998 with Laura at the UA Union Square East for $8.75.</P>
<P>Little Voice is a young introverted woman living on the edge. Perhaps just
living edgily. The home she shares with her mother is a powder keg: every
outlet is taxed with extension cords and outlet multipliers; her mother's
baudy, brassy bravado has the nervous young thing unhinged and hiding.
Either way, you can hear the sparks crackling dangerously in the air.</P>
<P>What Little Voice (Jane Horrocks; best known as "Bubble" from the TV
series *Absolutely Fabulous*) can do to liberate herself is listen to the
music her deceased father loved--Judy Garland, Billie Holliday, Marilyn
Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, etc.--and mimic the singers perfectly. This is
not just an obsession, but a matter of survival, as her mother, Mari
(Brenda Blethyn), never stops talking. Whether she's talking sex or making
fun of LV in front of the telephone man, the woman does not shut up. So LV
turns up Judy Garland while her Mum turns up Tom Jones's "It's Not
Unusual."</P>
<P>Enter Ray Say (Michael Caine), a dubious "show biz" agent, but who does
know talent when he hears it in LV. No, he's never met Shirley Bassey, but
he has heard of acts almost completely unknown to civilization.</P>
<P>LV represents a ticket out. Out of debt is where Ray wants to go. Out of
their depressed Northern English town is where Mari wants to go. Yes, LV
represents their escape to worthier locales, like Las Vegas.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, managing to look mousey, telephone repair assistant Billy (Ewan
McGregor) is only slightly obsessed with his missing homing pigeon Duane,
and his growing interest in mutual introvert LV.</P>
<P>If there is a problem with *Little Voice* it's the premise that someone
can be this socially and emotionally stunted without being
institutionalized. But two elements overpower this deficiency--acting and
writing. All the performances are first rate, from Blethyn's raucousness
to Horrocks's wide-eyed terror and talent for mimicry. Viewers find it
hard to believe that Horrocks sings all of her own songs. The highlight of
the film is LV's debut at the decrepit club, the "RendezBoo", where she
sings a full roster of songs, imitating the original stars perfectly down
to the way they cocked their heads.</P>
<P>As Ray Say, Michael Caine has never looked so horrible. It's a departure
from the usual erudite sophistication we expect, but perfect for his role 
as the opportunistic loser. Also noteworthy is Annette Badland as
Mari's only friend, Sadie; she says even less than LV, but her face is so
expressive, she often steals the show. You can tell exactly what she's
thinking, from concern to anger to humor.</P>
<P>Director Mark Herman (*Brassed Off*) takes advantage of more than just the
actors' talents. The sleepy little northern town offers some dramatic
backdrops for the action here. While some viewers might find the harsh,
serious denouement a departure from the more frothy tone of the film,
Little Voice is still a very satisfying experience. Despite the humor, the
movie will strike a chord with anyone who has ever felt awkward, isolated,
lonely, or crushed by an insensitive parent. The music is pretty
sensational, and of course there's a segment of particular community that
will go for that alone.</P>
<P>The film was based on Jim Cartwright's play *The Rise and Fall of Little
Voice*), which was written specifically for Jane Horrocks to showcase her
singing and mimicry talents.</P>
