<PRE>Men in Black (1997)</PRE>
<PRE>No more calls, we have a winner.</PRE>
<P>Finally: A big, effects-laden summer movie that is actually worth the
time and the $7.50 to go see. "Men In Black" takes precise aim at its
target and scores a bullseye. It almost unfailingly hits the right tone
and the right character moments throughout. Vincent D'Onofrio should
get an Oscar nomination. Tommy Lee Jones plays it straight. Will Smith
isn't annoying. About the only cast member not used to her potential is
Linda Fiorentino. A quibble.</P>
<P>While certainly no "Chinatown", the script (yes, there actually was
one) shows clear evidence of thought on the part of the writers. In
case the writers or producers of the summer's other megaduds are
reading, I'll repeat those strange words slowly so they can sound them
out: "S-c-r-i-p-t". "T-h-o-u-g-h-t."</P>
<P>Refreshingly free of forced one-liners, we are instead treated to
exchanges with some actual wit.</P>
<PRE>        "He said the world was going to end."</PRE>
<PRE>        "Did he say when?"</PRE>
<P>The production design by Bo Welch ("Batman Returns", "Edward
Scissorhands", "Wolf") is deliciously good. The cinematography by
Donald Peterman ("Get Shorty", "Point Break", "Flashdance") under Barry
Sonnenfeld's direction is both clear and energetic.</P>
<P>A great part of the fun is that the movie manages to both skewer
blockbuster summer movies and be a blockbuster summer movie. My dad
taught me as a kid that the best riders at the rodeo were always the
clowns. You have to be good at something to poke fun of it.</P>
<P>"Men In Black" is a welcome relief for those who thought they'd have to
wait for Oscar season before having fun at the movies.</P>
