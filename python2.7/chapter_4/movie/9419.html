<P>Chad'z rating: **** (out of 4 = excellent)</P>
<P>1994, R, 102 minutes [1 hour, 42 minutes]</P>
<PRE>[fantasy]</PRE>
<P>starring: Brandon Lee (Eric Draven - The Crow), Ernie Hudson (Officer
Albrecht), Michael Wincott (Top Dollar), Rochelle Davis (Sarah), produced by
Edward R. Pressman, Jeff Most, written by David J. Schow, John Shirley,
directed by Alex Proyas, based on the comic book and characters created by
James O'Barr.</P>
<P>"The Crow" is an unusual, but excellent film unlike anything I've ever seen
before. It's a modern mythology story that takes elements from almost every
genre. What we get is a fantastic thrill ride of adventure, suspense, and an
overall sense of Gothic supernaturalism. </P>
<P>A narrator tells us when someone dies a crow takes their soul to the realm
of the dead, but if something went wrong, if something is unresolved,
sometimes that person is able to come back and set the wrong things right.
This is all told over an establishing shot of a dark and dirty city that
seems to be lit by the fires of Hell. The intense mood is immediately
established through the hardcore industrial soundtrack, a deathly black
night, with an overall design that is the epitome of Gothic.</P>
<P>Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven, a man who was murdered after he and his
fiancee Shelly tried to protest the mob's decision to evict everyone in their
neighborhood. Throughout the film we are shown flashes of their murder, which
is quite disturbing. The killers were essentially common thugs but with a
vicious, sadistic attitude. Eric's "ghost" returns to the scene of the crime
and relives it, but now he is ready to make those who did wrong to him pay
for their sins. </P>
<P>We also meet Sarah (Davis), a 12-year-old who was friends with Eric and
Shelly and misses them terribly. She is a curious, outspoken kid who takes
care of herself because her mother loves heroin instead. There is also police
officer Albrecht (Hudson), a cop who becomes personally involved with Eric's
case. He actually seems to care about people's welfare in a place where right
and wrong are reversed. </P>
<P>Eric hunts down his killers, and one-by-one, exacts vengeance, always
leaving behind his symbol which Officer Albrecht uses to put together the
pieces. Lee is so intense as his character he is sometimes more frightening
than the villains.</P>
<P>The source of the city's crime and evil seems to be coming from the nearly
demonic mob boss "Top Dollar" (Wincott). We see him perform cannibalistic
rituals, and when he speaks, his rhetoric is almost hypnotizing, and all of
this adds to the supernatural mood. He vileness makes him easy to hate, and
the film plays to our hopes that Eric will eventually confront him and
justice will be served.</P>
<P>The storytelling style here is not exactly straightforward. It allows for
scenes of interaction between Eric, Sarah, Officer Albrecht, and the
criminals he is after. Many of scenes do not build up the story, but serve
only to enhance mood, which is the film's primary existence anyway. We never
know what's going to happen next, but everything that does happen makes
sense. </P>
<P>Of course, Top Dollar figures out a way to "kill" Eric, which leads to an
exciting ending that is sad but poetic.</P>
<P>"The Crow" is a fascinating film. Never before has a film been able to
create such a powerful theme through mood and character alone. </P>
