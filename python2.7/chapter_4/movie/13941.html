<PRE>Review: The Avengers</PRE>
<P>Starring: Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery</P>
<PRE>Directed by Jeremiah Chechik
Approx 90 min</PRE>
<P>Though at times I wasn't sure what to make of The Avengers, I must admit
that I came out pleased. I don't really know why, but I just enjoyed the
film. It's due in great part to the costume and production design. The
Avengers is a stylish, vibrantly colorful and opulent picture.</P>
<P>I don't think I'd do very well in capsulating the story. The writer
didn't do a very good job with it either. Basically, Sean Connery is a
villain bent on world domination. He threatens every country in the
world with his weather controlling device. If they don't pay him 10
percent of their GNP, he freezes their country. Special agent John Steed
(Fiennes) works on stopping him, with the aid of Dr. Emma Peel (Thurman)
who has only a short time to clear her name of heinous wrong-doings.For
some reason (that I either didn't get or that wasn't explained clearly)
there is a duplicate Emma Peel running about. She looks like Uma, only
colder. And she is, of course, the one responsible for being bad. I
don't think I've done a very poor job of explaining this, the story just
isn't that good.</P>
<P>But there is something likable about the cheesey dialogue. And how could
you not like a film that has people in huge colorful teddy bear costumes
at a board meeting? There is also a spiffy "locust" attack, orchestrated
by British rising star comedian Eddie Izzard, who's only line comes at
the end of the film. One of many lines that made me chuckle, I might
add.</P>
<P>Some films make it difficult to tell if they take themselves seriously.
With Congo, they certainly did not, but that didn't work for so many
reasons. With Godzilla, I'm not sure whether or not they took themselves
seriously, but really, no matter how they took themselves, they couldn't
have made it palpable. But The Avengers puts a modern, spunky twist on a
campy 60's TV series. True fans probably won't much care for the new
version, they seldom do. But as a viewer who has seen episodes, but was
never die hard fan (and honestly can't remember much about them) I was
able to enjoy The Avengers for what it was worth. Admitedly, it could
have been made MUCH better than this. Fiennes and Connery are
forgettable, and so is Thurman (who has never looked better). But for
some reason, I didn't care about that as much with this one as I do with
so many others. I think there is enough splash and style, enough pretty
photography, enough cool effects and funky characters (shallow though
they may be) that I can recommend this film for some light-hearted,
thuroughly predictable fun.</P>
