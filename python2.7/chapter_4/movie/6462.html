<PRE>01 Dalmatians (G) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Part vamp, part tramp, and all camp, Glenn Close's wonderfully
wicked turn as the ultimate Disney diva, Cruella DeVil, powers 101
Dalmatians, the studio's new live-action version of its beloved 1961
animated feature.  Problem is, unless you are age 10 or under, there is
little else to hold your attention for the entire 98 minutes.</P>
<P>Producer-screenwriter John Hughes and director Stephen Herek's take
on the tale of the fur-loving DeVil, the spotted puppies from whose coats
she wants to make herself a coat, and the married owners (Jeff Daniels and
Joely Richardson) of the dalmatian parents Pongo and Perdy is actually quite
faithful to the original animated feature.  Viewers familiar with that
version will be pleased with how well some scenes survived the
cartoon-to-live-action translation, such as Perdy's stressful delivery of
her 15 puppies and the apparent stillbirth and ultimate revival of the pup
Lucky.  While the dogs and other animals do not talk this time around, the
communication between the animals does come through and is easily
understood.  The "twilight bark," where Pongo barks into the night sky to
summon other animals to search for his and Perdy's stolen puppies, still
makes for a striking scene without the spoken exposition that frames it.
And Close's Cruella matches her animated counterpart's nastiness and then
some; her hilariously over-the-top turn is sure to influence drag queens
everywhere.</P>
<P>Hughes and Herek's failure, however, lies in their incessant
indulgence in broad slapstick, which comes off as labored and not especially
funny.  The scene where Daniels's Roger and Richardson's Anita first meet in
the park is cheapened by too many pratfalls and dives into water.  Also, the
puppies' big escape from their barn prison has been needlessly punched up by
Home Alone-type slapstick involving the two dognappers, Jasper (Hugh Laurie)
and Horace (Mark Williams).  Herek not only tries evoke that fluke Macaulay
Culkin phenomenon through the cartoony violence, but also through the duo's
appearance--Jasper sports a beard and curly hair a la Daniel Stern's
bumbling burglar, and Horace is a shorter, heavier fellow wearing a hat not
unlike Joe Pesci.  Worst of all, the slapstick gives Close the short end of
the stick, for in the end Cruella's campy edge takes a back seat to the
physical punishment she takes from the animals--having a boar fall on her,
being dumped in mud and molasses, etc.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, the film entertained the kids at the big critics'
screening, and I'm sure children around the world will have fun with 101
Dalmatians, which is exactly what the folks at Disney had in mind.  But with
the preordained success of this underachieving animation-to-live-action
translation, this Disney animation fan cannot help but worry about what
possibly ruinous adaptation ideas the studio has in mind for its other
cartoon classics...<HR></P>
