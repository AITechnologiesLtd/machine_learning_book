<P>IN SHORT: One good one for us grownups.</P>
<P>There should be no secrets kept about Stanley Tucci's third outing as a
director. Joe Gould's Secret is an intelligent, touching, beautifully
written and acted film. A flat out fine film for those of us who don't
require explosions, foul mouthed rap music, gratuitous sex or violence
from our movies.[Not that there's anything wrong with that, but . . .
<g>]</P>
<P>Writing from the experience of a life-long New Yorker, I can honestly
report that in the decades while the homeless were anonymous, this city
had what we called "characters". Some may or may not have been homeless
or living in shelters, some may or may not have been addicts of any
kind, but they all stood out from the average bum in the gutter. In the
last twenty years, two come to mind. One, a very tall, blind poet, used
to stand on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 53rd street in full Viking
Warrior gear, spear and all, and recite for spare change. When he died
last year, after a number of years in Europe, he got a full write-up in
the New York Times. The second, Adam Purple (as in dressed head to foot
in) squatted in an abandoned tenement downtown and built, over the
course of a decade or two, an astounding garden on an abandoned plot of
land. When the City trashed it to build low cost housing not only was it
news, it broke our hearts.</P>
<P>Which brings us to the subject of Stanley Tucci's third feature as a
director, Joe Gould's Secret. Joe Gould (Ian Holm) was, thanks to an
article by Joseph Mitchell (Tucci) in The New Yorker, such a character.
Initially known as Professor Sea Gull, because of his self proclaimed
ability to converse in the language of the gull, the article made Gould
a minor celebrity in the growing bohemian counterculture down in the
Greenwich Village of 1942 or so. Planted in a window table at the
Minetta Tavern, scribbling in a school composition notebook and/or
reciting poetry or speaking the language of the gulls, Gould would
solicit contributions to the "Joe Gould Fund" all of which was to
support his massive written work in progress, "An Oral History of Our
Time".  Every conversation with every person Gould has met is written
down and, he claims, stored in a lockbox of a memory that recalls every
word.</P>
<P>Among Gould's famed contributors and supporters are Ezra Pound and e.e.
cummings, neither of whom appear in the flick. We do get to meet artist
Alice Neel (Susan Sarandon) and publisher Charlie Duell (Steve Martin)
who do their best to try and give Joe the exposure they think he
deserves. We do see his acceptance in The Raven Poetry Society, a group
of snobs who, after ten years tolerating Joe's mooching at their buffet,
allow him entry after fame strikes.</P>
<P>What we see best is a pair of great character performances by Tucci and
Holm. Joe Mitchell's family life is rounded out by Hope Davis, as his
photographer wife Therese and two kidlets (of whom one real life
surviving kidlet consulted on the film) and it is a fully formed
picture. We see a working guy do his story and try to move on -- except
for the fact that the story keeps coming back. In this case, Gould camps
out in the lobby of The New Yorker, waiting for Mitchell. And waiting.
And waiting.</P>
<P>Joe Gould's "secret" is revealed in the film. What is more interesting
is an even darker secret that pops up in the middle of the film and
promptly disappears. You'll know it when you see it. Unless, of course,
I'm suffering from an overactive imagination.</P>
<P>On average, a first run movie ticket will run you Eight Bucks. Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Joe Gould's Secret, he would have
paid . . .</P>
<PRE>$6.50</PRE>
<P>Much better than the average arthouse fare and, IMO, a return to the
solid film-making talent Stanley Tucci showed in Big Night.</P>
