<PRE>               A film review by Michael Yagnow</PRE>
<PRE>                Copyright 1997 Michael Yagnow</PRE>
<P>     This movie IS NOT a two-hour radio show. Stern-lovers as well as
haters will love this comedy, whether they like it or not. It is a
touching love story and the journey of a nerd to the top.</P>
<P>"Private Parts" begins with several comedic scenes that grip you
and pull you into the movie. Several people remark on how much they love
or hate Stern in funny, documentary-like scenes.</P>
<P>For the fans, there are plenty of scenes you'd expect of Stern:
there is a scene where Stern sees Carol Alt's breasts practically burst
out of her bra; there is an orgasm scene in which a fully nude woman
rips off her shirt while on top of a speaker; there is the infamous
bathtub scene; and there is, of course, the Jenna Jameson scene, in
which we see everything (EVERYTHING) she has to offer.</P>
<P>And, for the non-fans, there is a touching love story between Stern
and his wife, Alison, played wonderfully by Mary McCormack.</P>
<P>The performances are the best they can be, with Stern playing
himself, Robin Quivers playing herself, Paul Giamatti playing "Pig
Vomit," the villain, Jenna Jameson playing Mandy, the first nude woman
in radio, and, of course, Fred Norris, who steals the movie from his
first scene.</P>
<P>In "Private Parts," Stern show us his PRIVATE PARTS! It is a movie
for everyone (except the kids). Despite the raunchy Stern we know, he is
a really nice guy, who will keep us laughing long after we've left the
theatre.</P>
<PRE>Rating: **** out of a possible ****</PRE>
