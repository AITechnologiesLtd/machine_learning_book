<PRE>"Titus" - Vengeance is a Dish Best Served Cold
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>"Titus Andronicus" was one of Shakespeare's first
plays.  It is not regarded as one of his better plays,
but the story of an honorable warrior at odds with a
spiteful Queen is nonetheless an ambitious and epochal
tale of valor, vengeance and vindication. 
Shakespearean work has enjoyed a resurgence these last
few years and we have come to enjoy some of his tales
told through cinema with offerings such as Romeo +
Juliet, Hamlet, and a Midsummer's Night Dream. 
"Titus" however has a much darker subject than any of
these recent films.  It is a tragic and seething drama
about vengeance most foul.  It is a chilling tale that
showcases unbridled malice in a manner that is almost
shocking and certainly unlike any Shakespeare work to
which I have been exposed.</P>
<P>"Titus" of the film is played brilliantly by Anthony
Hopkins, who seemed born to play this role.  His
loyalty to his king and country is so great that he
would even slay his own kin without hesitation if it
was the honorable thing to do.  As part of his duties,
he is to carry out a ritualistic sacrifice of a young
man.  The mother, Tamora (Jessica Lange), begs Titus
to spare her son's life.  But her pleas go unheard,
and the deed is done.  Tamora swears that she shall
exact revenge when the time is appropriate.  In other
early scenes, we meet other characters that revolve
around Titus's life.  These include Saturninus (Alan
Cumming) and Bassianus (James Frain), two Princes who
are vying for the recently vacated throne.  Livinia
(Laura Fraser) is Titus's beautiful daughter who is
betrothed to Bassianus, but is also the object of
desire of Saturninus as well as Tamora's two sons,
Chiron and Demetrius (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Matthew
Rhys).  We also meet the brother of Titus (Colm
Feore); Titus's four sons; and Aaron the Moor (Harry
Lennix), another schemer who is like a tutor to
Tamora's two sons.</P>
<P>These introductions occur in the first 25 minutes of
the film.  With the number of characters being
introduced and my inability to fully comprehend
"Shakespeare-speak," I actually found it difficult to
stay focused.  In addition, the setting of the film is
a fantastically dreamy and imaginative world where the
past and present simultaneously co-exists.  In one
scene, you'll see chariots and spears.  In another
scene, you'll see motorcycles and machine guns.  I say
that it's like a dream because it's both beautiful,
yet contextually challenging.</P>
<P>By the second act, the story becomes more focused. 
Tamora has ascended to Queen by winning the heart of
Saturninus.  With her new powers, she now begins her
quest for revenge.  Her sons also engage in rancorous
behavior.  However, their amorally reckless actions
stem from youth and boredom rather than from a need
for revenge.  Tamora's and her sons' wickedness comes
at great expense to Titus.  The climax of the film is
a hauntingly beautiful scene at a crossroads where
Titus has finally exhausted all patience, and his
loyalties have all but dissipated.  Now the once-proud
and honorable warrior must gather up his remaining
strength to combat the injustice that has been
afflicted upon him.  </P>
<P>The film is appropriately rated "R" for adult themes
involving decapitated body parts, implied cannibalism,
and a wanton need for revenge.  Though Shakespeare is
taught at middle school levels, only the maturest of
audiences should witness the baseness of the
character's actions.  In many ways, it is a beautiful
film that is ambitious, creative, and showcases superb
acting.  Yet, for all it's achievements, I can not
help but point out that the movie will probably only
appeal to fans of Shakespeare's work.  I also found
parts of the story weak.  I questioned the need for
Titus's brother, lamented that the deliciousness of
the Saturninus character (my favorite character) fades
away as the film progresses, and found the ending to
transpire too quickly given the dialogue-heavy
structure of other vital scenes throughout the movie. 
In the theatre where I saw this, many were moved by
the events that unfolded on the big screen.  Others,
however, slept soundly until the lights went up.  I
was sometimes at a loss, primarily due to my inability
to fully comprehend "Shakespeare-speak".  But, I was
impressed with what I saw.  I sat up and took notice. 
And, this film certainly deserves to be recognized.</P>
