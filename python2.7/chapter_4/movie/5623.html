<P>Review- This wonderful surprise was hands down the funniest movie of 1995.
 This film tells the stry of four friends who just graduated from college 
but are uncertain what to do with their lives. The plot may sound similar 
andf this story has been botched many times before, but this time it is 
perfect. I loved every minute of this film.</P>
<P>        Josh Hamilton stars as Grover, who on graduation night learns that his 
girlfriend, Jane, is moving to Prague. Grover asks "So how will that work 
if you're living with me in Brooklyn?" Jane responds, "It'll be the same, 
except I'll be in Prague." Jane leaves for Prague, and in a futile 
attempt to get over her, he sleeps with a different freshman each night 
it seems. Jane continues to leave messages on the answering machine, and 
Grover tries not to listen, but he does. The film shows the beginnings of 
their relationship in flashbacks, after we have already seen them breakup.
 This is an intelligent device, and makes the flashbacks all the more 
poignant.</P>
<P>        Chris Eigeman plays Max, the cynical wisecracking Matthew Perry-ish best 
friend of Grover. Max graduates and realizes he has to start all over 
again. "8 hours ago I was Max Beaumont, English major, college senior. 
Now I'm Max Beaumont who does nothing." Max always seems to have a self 
deprecating manner, and apparently is never happy with himself. Enter 
into his life a 16 year old high school student (Buono). They make an odd 
couple, but thats probably what Max likes about her. He couldn't stand 
being with someone like him, so he has to be with someone different. </P>
<P>        Carlos Jacott plays Otis, the dopey one. He is supposed to go to 
graduate school, but doesn't have enough confidence and decides to take a 
year off. He is constantly doing strange things such as wearing his 
pajamas during the day, coming out of the bathroom unbuckled, and putting 
mascara on. He takes a job at a huge Blockbuster style video store that 
has numerous confusing movie categories such as Dog - Buddy pictures and 
Interesting Failures. This is an obvious attempt at spoofing Blockbuster 
and it is very funny, but seems out of place in this film which otherwise 
mines its humor from real life situations. This is a very minor nitpick 
in an otherwise perfect film.</P>
<P>        Jason Wiles plays Skippy, the naive and carefree one who re-enrolls in 
school after graduating so he has an excuse to stay in town with his 
undergraduate girlfriend, Miami (Posey). This is a very entertainig 
relationship between the two that suffers a crisis, and at the end we 
understand why he has put up with her, and why she has put up with him. 
The last scene between the two is wonderful. We realize their annoyances, 
but we understand their significant charms.</P>
<P>        In the middle of all this is the bartender Chet, played by Eric Stoltz. 
He has been going to college for 10 years. "I did skip a semester my 
sophomore year," he helpfully informs us. Chet is comfortable with what 
he does in life, and isn't looking for a career. He is a college student, 
and thats all he wants to be. </P>
<P>        "Kicking and Screaming" was written and directed by Noah Baumbach in a 
stunning debut. The depth he puts into each and every character is 
astonishing. Notice for example the scene in the Creative Writing class 
where some characters that only have one or two lines have fully 
developed personalities, especially the teacher, who says only one word. 
The dialogue is highly entertaining and realistic. There are 
conversations here that rival the popular ones in Pulp Fiction, such as a 
discussion on the Friday the 13th films, and on wether you would want to 
fuck a cow or lose your mother. The acting is terrific. There isn't one 
imperfect performance in the bunch, and Jacott's uproarious deadpan 
portrayal of Otis deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor. Elliot 
Gould has a very effective small role as Grover's dad. This little 
independent feature didn't even make 1 million in its theatrical release, 
so I beg you to rent this so we will get to see more from Noah Baumbach 
in the future. This is one of the funniest movies of the decade.</P>
