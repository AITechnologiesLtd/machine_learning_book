A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Richard Friedenberg</PRE>
<P>Written by: Richard Friedenberg (adapted from the novel by Forrest
Carter)</P>
<P>Starring: Joseph Ashton, James Cromwell, Tantoo Cardinal, Graham Greene</P>
<P>Ingredients:
Little orphan boy, rural grandparents, mountains, Native American lore</P>
<P>Synopsis: 
In this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a
young boy spends with Grandpa and Grandma, the self recollections of an
unseen narrator focus on his world view as a Tennessee orphan boy
learning of his heritage through his grandparents. </P>
<P>The setting is after the first World War, during the Great Depression
years. A nine-year-old orphan named Little Tree (Joseph Ashton) is taken
in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his Caucasian moonshiner
Grandpa (James Cromwell) and his Native American Grandma (Tantoo
Cardinal) in the wilderness of the mountains of Tennessee. Here Little
Tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - -
and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise.
Everything is miraculous to a child.</P>
<P>But it all comes crashing down for the boy when the U.S. government
forcibly takes custody away from Grandpa and Grandma, and forces Little
Tree to attend the Notched Gap Boarding School, a kind of internment
camp where multiracial Cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress, pray,
speak, and think like white people or face solitary confinement and
corporeal punishment.</P>
<P>Through his childhood experiences, Little Tree learns lessons about
love, race, life, death, people, nature, and folk wisdom.</P>
<P>Opinion:
This excellent, excellent family movie. It is one of those priceless
screen gems that nobody knows about because it's not highly advertised.
You won't find any formula schlock, cutesy characters, canned
spirituality, sequel teasers or commercial tie ins, but you will find
THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE to be a refreshing, impeccably acted,
original, wonderful, and touching film. Take the whole family and bring
a box of tissues for the tearjerkers. This one's as good as OLD YELLER. </P>
