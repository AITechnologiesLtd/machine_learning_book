<P>     If you've been wondering what could have prompted that recent
declaration from Liam Neeson that he's ready to give up movies
altogether, the answer is now playing at a cineplex near you. It's
called "The Haunting," and it's so thoroughly misguided and muddled
Dreamworks, the studio foisting this bomb on the public, ought to hire a
special corps of ushers to hand out sympathy cards to patrons as they
exit the theater.</P>
<P>This is the second time Hollywood has tackled Shirley Jackson's
book "The Haunting of Hill House." It was previously filmed by director
Robert Wise in 1963 -- that version was also titled "The Haunting" --
with Julie Harris, Claire Bloom and Richard Johnson. The 1963 "Haunting"
remains one of the eeriest ghost stories ever filmed; though Wise never
showed a single spirit, he and his cast created such an overpowering
atmosphere of menace the movie is still potent today.</P>
<P>The current "Haunting" comes from director Jan de Bont ("Twister,"
"Speed"), who is better known as a master of disaster and an
orchestrator of special effects than as a craftsman capable of creating
a mood piece. Thus, this version is chock-full of computer-generated
ghouls and bone-shaking digital stereo cacophony, none of which makes
the movie in any way frightening or even particularly interesting.</P>
<P>The difference between the two "Haunting"s is literally spelled
out. In the Wise film, a creepy message is found scrawled across a wall
in chalk. In de Bont's film, a similiar sentiment is painted in blood.
Everything in this "Haunting" is louder, more elaborate and far sillier
than anything in the original.</P>
<P>David Self's choppy screenplay introduces Dr. Marrow (Neeson) who
has recruited a trio of subjects for a little experiment in terror,
scheduled to take place in Hill House, a cavernous estate full of dark
secrets. Eleanor (Lili Taylor) has spent a large portion of her life
waiting on her invalid mother; Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) is a
free-loving jet-setter; Luke (Owen Wilson) is basically just horny. The
only thing these three have in common is insomnia, and they've been
lured to Dr. Marrow by the promise of big bucks for participating in a
research study.</P>
<P>But Dr. Marrow is more concerned with observing the mechanics of
fear than in finding a cure for sleeplessness, and certainly no one gets
much shut-eye when the unseen inhabitants of Hill House begin treating
their guests to a series of bizarre visions and increasingly violent
bursts of mayhem.</P>
<P>The story's original subtext -- that most of the calamity was
springing from the virginal Eleanor's long-repressed libido -- vanishes
under Self's heavy hand. In the 1963 film, Harris' Eleanor was torn
between returning the affections of Bloom's Theo, who was openly
lesbian, and Johnson's Dr. Markway. Here, Self introduces Theo as a
bisexual, only to promptly drop the matter altogether; hard to believe
filmmakers could be more frank about sexuality 36 years ago than they
can be today.</P>
<P>But this "Haunting" isn't about people anyway. It's about
technology. But despite the millions that must have been spent on the
various creations the fact remains that they simply aren't scary. In
some cases, they're even ludicrous: When a chorus of carved cherubs
comes screamingly to life, it's hard not to think of the Pop N Fresh
doughboy being threatened with a trip to the oven.</P>
<P>What's more disturbing is the amateurishness of the performances,
given the reputations of those involved. Neeson and Jones seem
completely uninspired, Wilson is just plain awful and the ordinarily
wonderful Taylor proves here that she can't scream convincingly to save
her life. While she barely manages to retain her dignity in scenes that
call for her to have conversations with curtains, even Taylor can't rise
above a ridiculous climactic speech full of pop psychology and jibberish
about family values.</P>
<P>Yes, Mr. Neeson, you're right. "The Haunting" is awful enough to
make anyone reconsider their career choice. Especially film critics.</P>
