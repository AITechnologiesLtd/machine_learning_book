<P>"The Omega Code" gets my vote for one of the best, cheeriest comedies ever 
made. It is often so damn funny that I could not hold back my laughter - a 
deliberate hark back to the kind of spoof that Mel Brooks used to make. </P>
<P>The film stars Casper Van Dien as Dr. Gillen Lane, a mythology guru who 
believes he has unlocked the secrets of the Bible Code that tells of 
prophecies, past and future. Yes, these codes foretold of Princess Diana's 
demise not to mention the assassination of Kennedy, and so on. I wonder if 
any mention was made of the rape of the Central Park jogger back in the 
1980's, or the recent Colombine massacre, or how about the Oklahoma bombing. 
But never mind, obviously, it dictates events among the rich and famous only. </P>
<P>Enter the wealthy businessman, Stone Alexander (Michael York), who wants to 
rule the world and needs to find the key to the ancient city of Jerusalem - 
he just needs the good doctor to unlock the remaining bible codes to 
determine the future. Or something like that. And what can we make of the two 
prophets, who appear and disappear at will? And will the overworked Dr. Lane 
fix his marriage to the sweet, lonesome Jennifer (Devon Odessa)? And is 
Alexander's trusted emissary, Dominic (Michael Ironside), intent on 
double-crossing his boss? </P>
<P>Okay, so "The Omega Code" is not a comedy, it is a timely biblical thriller 
that is too unintentionally funny to really score on a dramatic level. I knew 
the movie would not work as soon as Casper Van Dien's overacting began when 
he explains on a talk show, with his motivational speaking skills intact, the 
veracity of the Bible Codes. Amazingly, no one in this film questions whether 
such codes exist. Of course, there is controversy over such codes in today's 
world but wouldn't we be more interested in what those codes say about our 
future rather than the accidental death of Princess Diana? </P>
<P>"The Omega Code" is not humorous enough on a good bad movie scale to sit 
through, and hardly thrilling for one second. It is preposterous and dull 
with garden-variety special-effects that are equalled on the level of the 
defunct "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" show. The film also has the kind of 
hammy performances that would have delighted the "MST" crowd. The funniest 
thing about this movie is that it was financed by the Trinity Broadcasting 
Network - such funding should have been used for more worthwile endeavors. </P>
