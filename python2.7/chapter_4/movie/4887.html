references to incest)</P>
<P>Irritating for some, intriguing for others, clever and 
fascinating for many, Henry Jaglom's latest picture is, 
whatever the reactions, one of the sharpest depictions of  the 
hearts, minds and above all, fixations on careers of theater 
people: actors, playwrights, directors, teachers, satellites. 
The one major exception is Oona Hart (Victoria Foyt, the 
current Mrs. Jaglom) who visits from Hollywood.</P>
<P>Oona goes to a large country house in the ritzy Hamptons. For 
financial reasons, the owner, aged stage actress (and ex-movie 
star) Helena Mora(Viveca Lindfors), has put it up for sale. </P>
<P>As is customary,  matriarch Helena's large, extended and 
talented family, all in theater, gather there in the summer. 
This is their last weekend. Traditionally too, the clan has 
mounted a play for a single performance, a yearly, 
artistic-cum-social event attended strictly with limited 
invitations.  </P>
<P>Oona enters the new milieu with trepidation and a load of 
complexes. She earns far more from movies than anyone around 
from stagecraft, but she is insecure, in awe of real pros and 
(I guess) because while bankable she has not attained true 
stardom. Without becoming a catalyst she is the main thread of 
the film as it presents us with a multitude of situations 
among the regulars. </P>
<P>What sets everyone apart from common mortals is ego and 
egocentrism, terms that are not synonymous. The second, in 
addition to self-importance, includes colossal 
self-absorption. Oona's ego may not be larger than the 
others', but in an ocean of "I, I, I," her share is gigantic.  </P>
<P>She is also a specialist in "You, you, you." In that other 
thespian movie, "All About Eve," cynic George Sanders advises 
Marilyn Monroe to go and do herself some good. That's just 
what Oona is about.</P>
<P>Flitting from person to person, she networks, schmoozes, 
dispenses gobs of hyperbolic compliments, transparent 
flattery, heavy adulation and outpourings of fraudulent 
sincerity. Buttering up director Ivan Axelrod (stage director 
Andre Gregory of "My Dinner with Andre") she gushes about his 
work, then admits she has never seen any of it: "But I've 
heard about it ... You're like a legend."</P>
<P>What, in showbiz lingo, tops the gag, is that Ivan accepts 
this hook, line and sinker. He doesn't even smile ironically. 
Later, in fact, he cuddles Oona. At another point he has 
something like near sex with her as she does her panther 
exercise, jumping, clawing and roaring. (When she does her 
baby seal exercise she's just as hilarious). </P>
<P>The performers, all excellent, have zip, zing and verve. I 
only regret that the great, distinctive Roscoe Lee Browne who 
can radiate intelligence and irony like nobody's business, has 
such a tiny role. </P>
<P>The structure of the film is like a string of improvisations, 
but in reality it is a careful charting of encounters. Large 
family reunions around Helena's table are done in most 
un-gourmet fashion as food is barely the background and talk 
is all. Smaller groups are formed. Dominant are the repeated 
tete-a-tete two-shots, with the same couple or with a 
different partner.</P>
<P>Seldom has a movie deserved more the description of "bits and 
pieces." So many of them that they may try your powers of 
concentration as you attempt to figure out who's who or what 
to whom.  </P>
<P>Unlike the conventions of the "well-made play," where the 
exposition starts as the curtain goes up on Act I, Scene 1 and 
soon we are given basic information about many characters, 
"Last Summer" is hyper-realistic. It's like getting plopped 
into a big party and having to fend for yourself in figuring 
out the identities of others guests.</P>
<P>When Jean Renoir's classic "The Rules of the Game" (an obvious 
inspiration for "Last Summer") gathered a motley weekend crowd 
in a chateau, the diverse characters stood out with clarity, 
as they do in Jaglom's other models: Chekhov's "The Cherry 
Orchard," the older novel, play and film "Grand Hotel," Ingmar 
Bergman's "Smiles of a Summer Night," its clever Woody Allen 
version "A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy," etc. </P>
<P>Jaglom takes his non-method a bit far. I thought of viewers 
who complain that too many subtitles in inordinately talky 
foreign films block the looking at screen images. Mr. Jaglom 
might have used occasional identifications, like those on TV 
news or documentaries: "Henry Purcell, Rio Tonto Police 
Chief." Not too many of course, since part of the game is 
figuring out the characters.  </P>
<P>English-born (1939)Henry Jaglom, first an actor on American 
TV, entered movies as an editorial consultant (whatever that 
means) for "Easy Rider" (1969) before turning writer-director 
with "A Safe Place" in 1971. "Last Summer" is, as per Jaglom, 
his eleventh film, but in reality his twelfth if you count his 
co-direction of the theatrically unreleased "National Lampoon 
Goes to the Movies" (1981). </P>
<P>Jaglom is an independent and a maverick who makes decidedly 
non-Hollywoodian movies, super talky affairs of staged 
"cinema-verite" (documentary),with players who range from many 
unknown or little known to second-stringers. In his filmic 
cocktails, he mixes and stirs them with "real" people, often 
filmmakers like Orson Welles, Bob Rafelson, Monte Hellman, 
Milos Forman, John Landis. </P>
<P>The average cast is large. Names and no-names generally share 
the pie democratically.With "Always," Jaglom started 
increasing the number of parts. With "Someone to Love," 
"Eating," "Venice-Venice" (60 parts, albeit many microscopic) 
and "Babyfever" Jaglom became the Cecil B. DeMille of 
Kammerspiel.</P>
<P>In "Last Summer" what we don't learn about theater people is 
hardly worth mentioning. Among the revelations (to those 
unfamiliar with the profession) is that everything, including 
personal life, is ever sacrificed to getting a part. </P>
<P>Oona, cynically encouraged by her visiting lover (Jaglom) has 
a fling with a talented grandson of Helena's. He, poor soul, 
deludes himself that Oona might follow him to the wilds of the 
Midwest. She: "I don't even know where Missouri is!" </P>
<P>We learn that ambition goes so far that a "gorgeous 
apprentice" (Nick Gregory) fakes being gay and comes on to 
young playwright Jake (real playwright Jon Robin Baitz) to 
advance his (the phony's) career. We learn that a director 
father is jealous of his successful son and that the first 
sexual experience of a young woman was with her gay brother. 
We learn about family relations, problems, alienations, about 
truths, lies, deceptions, self-deceptions and the terrible 
toll of aging.  </P>
<P>Helena explains that she left Hollywood and returned to the 
stage because there she could learn much more about her craft. 
True enough, but wasn't it also because getting old demotes 
one to lesser parts?   </P>
<P>In the most moving scenes, twice Helena watches herself on TV. 
She sees Viveca Lindfors in her two initial movies, after 
Hollywood imported her from Sweden. Her first US film ("Night 
Unto Night") was in 1947, opposite Ronald Reagan. It was 
shelved until 1949 so that her public screen debut was with 
Errol Flynn, in 1948  ("The Adventures of Don Juan"). One 
picture may have been a dud, the other a potboiling 
swashbuckler, but even if we know those facts, there is pathos 
in stars looking at their glory days. Think of  "Sunset 
Boulevard." </P>
<P>Miss Lindfors died while on tour in Sweden in 1995. Unlike 
Helena, she never left the cinema although she did also return 
to the stage. Her penultimate movie was the 1994 "Stargate." 
She worked in almost 60 films, few of them worthy of her 
talents--unlike "Last Summer," where her last appearance is a 
fitting, touching grand exit. </P>
