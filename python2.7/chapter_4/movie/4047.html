<P>     For Andie MacDowell, it's been a while since sEX, LIES, AND
VIDEOTAPE--the last time her work was worthy of positive notice.
Despite being wooed by a host of notable directors, including Robert
Altman (who cast her in SHORT CUTS) and Krzysztof Kieslowski (who wanted
her for the title role in THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE), MacDowell's
acting has been largely lackluster since her appearance in Steven
Soderbergh's debut feature.  In fact, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL
succeeded almost in spite of her.  With UNSTRUNG HEROES, however, the
actress delivers a strong performance likely to impress (and perhaps
surprise) both fans and detractors.</P>
<P>     MacDowell, playing dying wife/mother Selma Lidz, isn't the only one
who does a solid job.  John Turturro, whose only career misstep was
BRAIN DONORS, fills the role of Selma's husband, scientist/experimenter
Sid Lidz, with his usual aptitude.  As Selma fades away, Turturro's face
expresses Sid's unspeakable loss with heart-breaking poignancy.  Also
effective is young Nathan Watt as Steven, the Lidz' young son, who is
forced to cope with death before he really understands what living is.
On hand to teach him life's lessons are two eccentric, "black sheep"
uncles:  paranoid Danny (Michael Richards) and packrat Arthur (Mary
Chaykin).  As Steven's home life becomes increasingly unstable, Danny
and Arthur are there for him, dispensing their own variety of wisdom,
which includes advice never to throw away memories--like dreams,
they're easily lost, and an effort must be made to preserve them.</P>
<P>     UNSTRUNG HEROES opens as another coming of age story set in the
early sixties.  Steven and his sister Sandy (Kendra Krull) are the
children of a happily married, if somewhat unusual, non-practicing
Jewish couple.  It's not long, however, before we learn that Selma is
terminally ill.  Sid doesn't handle the situation well, so when Steven
asks to spend the summer with his two oddball uncles, there are only
token objections.  While living with Danny and Arthur, Steven changes
his name to Franz and learns the importance of his Jewish
faith--something Sid has always dismissed as "a crutch."</P>
<P>     Director Diane Keaton is on certain ground chronicling the tragedy
of Selma's illness and its inevitable conclusion.  While the emotional
impact of UNSTRUNG HEROES isn't as potent as that of Richard
Attenborough's similarly-themed SHADOWLANDS, the scenes showing Selma,
Sid, and their children coping with impending death are well-written and
effectively conveyed.  Thankfully, most of this is handled with
refreshing subtlety--there is no obvious audience manipulation.</P>
<P>     Less successful is the presentation of Uncles Danny and Arthur.
There's a sense that these two exist simply to populate UNSTRUNG HEROES
with a pair of eccentrics, and they seem more like scripted characters
than real people.  Their ultimate function within the context of the
story--life's castoffs teaching an impressionable boy secrets of how
to stay afloat--is more than a little cliched.  It's in the sequences
where Steven is cloistered with his uncles that the film wanders off-
track.  Fortunately, this is only a short detour.  Most of the movie
remains firmly focused on its stronger elements.</P>
<P>     There's nothing especially original about UNSTRUNG HEROES, but the
story is told with intelligence and sensitivity.  In a time when so many
movies are botching promising premises, it's refreshing to see something
appealing done with a retreaded subject.  This film isn't a masterpiece,
but it offers another view of what makes family so important, and does
so with an emotional honesty that many other movies don't approach.</P>
