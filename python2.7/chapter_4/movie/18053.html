<P>Drama Behind the Drama
=================
Radio can be visually engaging, since everything happens in the
listeners imagination. So I was told while attending radio production
lectures. So Ushijima, the producer in 'Welcome Back Mr. McDonald' says.
And hes right. Remember those late-night radio dramas; those
soap-operas on the airwaves? Even in this digital age, theres still a
certain charm to this medium.</P>
<P>'Welcome Back Mr McDonald' (McDonald) is a film about what goes on
behind a live radio drama, 'Unmei no Onna' (Woman of Destiny). Miyako
Suzuki, whos otherwise just another Japanese housewife, takes part in a
drama writing competition held by a broadcasting station and wins on her
first ever script. Naturally, shes thrilled that her script will be
heard live on the stations midnight programme, but with the show going
on air soon, the shows star, Nokko, insists on changing the heorines
name  and before one knows it, everyones changing the script --
impromptu -- even as the show is being broadcast.</P>
<P>>From Ritsuko and Torazo, the characters become Mary Jane and Peter
Michael (and then Donald McDonald). From Japan, the locale is switched
to Chicago. And what was a Japanese romance between a pachinko woman and
a fisherman soon becomes an exaggerated melodrama involving a woman
lawyer, a NASA pilot, and whatnot. The final straw for the soft-spoken
housewife comes when Nokko decides to kill off the hero at the end of
the story.</P>
<P>'McDonald' revolves around the drama behind the drama. As the cast and
crew for 'Unmei no Onna' find themselves in deeper trouble with each
script-change, the drama within the studio quickly overshadows whats on
air, as egos clash and tempers flare  all to hliarious effect.</P>
<P>'McDonald' features a solid cast of personalities like Akira Fuse,
Toshiyuki Hosokawa, Jun Inoue, Keiko Toda, and Toshiaki Karasawa, to
name a few. The cast is so comfortable in their respective roles youd
assume they really enjoyed working on the film. And just as well too,
since its the interesting characters in 'McDonald'  rather than the
plot -- that really drive the story. For instance, Miyako, the hapless
housewife/script-writer, has become so emotionally attached to her alter
ego and heroine, Mary Jane (who was Ritsuko), that the idea of an
unhappy ending becomes unbearable.</P>
<P>'McDonald' is a mainstream production. While it does make fun of Japans
obsession with things American, its still a typical laugh-a-minute
comedy. The film doesnt try being too plausible. In fact, some of the
things in the film  like the way they interrupt the transmission with
one commercial after another  isnt something professionals in the
business can get away with. Besides, not many studios do their dramas
live anymore for obvious reasons.</P>
<P>Yet by not resorting to slapstick, and by craftily relating the drama
off air to the live show, youd soon be wooed into believing that yes,
anything CAN happen. The idea isnt fresh, and the plot is a simple
albeit outrageous one, but every character in the show is so endearing,
you just cant think otherwise.</P>
<P>If theres a blemish in 'McDonald', its the films slow start.
'McDonald' really picks up when Nokko begins making her demands, but
until then it's rather unhappening. With so many characters appearing
right at the start, some in the audience might also be be grappling with
whos who for a while. But then, these are things youre likely to
forgive by the end of film.</P>
<P>'McDonald' made me laugh. 'McDonald' made me cry (mostly from laughing
too much, actually); and most of all, this fel-good comedy made me walk
out of the theatre with a stupid grin on my face. And mind you, I dont
do that often.</P>
<P>Whoever said radios dying this day and age? It has never looked any
better on the screen.</P>
