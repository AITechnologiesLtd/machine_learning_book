<PRE>written and directed by Woody Allen</PRE>
<P>Few filmmakers have the courage and honesty to openly portray their
psyche, flawed as it may be, in their films.  Woody Allen, among other
things, is one of these filmmakers.  In each one of his brilliant
character studies, there is more than a bit of self-deprecation; never
too subtle to recognize.</P>
<P>And watching `Sweet And Lowdown', his wonderful new film,
it's not hard to see why subtlety isn't his main priority.  What
makes his films so entertaining is that he is the poster-boy for
modern American, middle-aged (and dare I say Jewish) neurosis, and not
the least bit ashamed of it.  `Sweet And Lowdown', Allen's
32nd feature film, is highly enjoyable, funny and unpredictable.</P>
<P>It is his first movie which characterizes his well-publicized
infatuation with jazz music.</P>
<P>In the film, Woody's alter ego is Emmet Ray (Sean Penn); `the
second greatest guitarist in the world,' and quite proud of it.
Emmet's story is told `mockumentary' style; narrated by Woody
Allen and other noted jazz aficionados.  He is a fine musician, but a
flawed character; one so self-involved that his only companionship is
found in a mute woman named Hattie (Samantha Morton, in a dazzling
performance), who listens but never retorts.</P>
<P>This amusing relationship makes up the core of the film, and it works
very well thanks in part to Sean Penn's over-the-top antics.  But
it is Samantha Morton, who has appeared in a few British productions,
who steals the show with her silent vulnerability.  She utters not a
single line, yet she is a shoo-in (at least in my book) for a handful
of awards.</P>
<P>`Sweet And Lowdown' is otherwise an entertaining series of
occurrences in Emmet Ray's lifetime, which includes living out his
favorite pastime (shooting rats at a garbage dump), and a chance
meeting with Django Reinhardt (the greatest guitarist in the world,
according to Emmet).  The film's light tone is more like `Radio
Days' than `Crimes And Misdemeanors'.</P>
<P>Many will say that `Sweet And Lowdown' is too slight to be a
comic triumph, but I enjoyed every minute, which was probably the
filmmakers' intention.  The superb supporting cast includes Uma
Thurman, Anthony LaPaglia, Gretchen Mol and James Urbaniak (from
`Henry Fool', which was indeed a comic triumph), all of whom
shine in small roles.</P>
<P>Woody Allen is back at peak form, doing what he does best without
offending anybody.  With so many `edgy' films being made as a
new wave of filmmaking approaches, it's nice to see that some still
`make ‘em like they used to.'</P>
<P>It's also interesting to point out that Woody Allen may be the
hardest working artist in film today.  I'd be hard-pressed to name
another who puts out a film every year.  But Woody does it, and he
does it well.  What makes Allen one of the most talented filmmakers of
the century is that he realizes, as others should, that true
inspiration can only be found within oneself.</P>
