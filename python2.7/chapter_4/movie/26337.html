<P>What would you expect if you put together a cast featuring an Oscar-winning
actor in Kevin Spacey, an Oscar-winning actress in Helen Hunt, an
Oscar-nominated actor in little Haley Joel Osment and an Oscar-nominated
Musical Score guy in Thomas Newman (AMERICAN BEAUTY)? An Oscar winning movie
perhaps? Well, things don't always turn out the way we want them to, right?</P>
<P>PLOT:
A young boy is challenged to make the world a better place by his teacher
and comes up with a revolutionary idea about helping those who can't help
themselves. If you become a recipient of said good deed from another, you
must in turn, perform an exemplary favor for three other people, and so on,
and so forth. It isn't long before the young boy draws his teacher and
mother into the world of "paying it forward".</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Great concept, top-notch acting and a nice try but this film ultimately
fails because it tags convenient situations on to its second half and gives
us one of the most uninspiring endings that I have seen in years! Don't they
have test audiences for stuff like this? Why anyone would think that this
finale "completes" this picture in any way is beyond me! But enough about
the crappy ending. On the whole, the film was actually working for me until
about the halfway point. That's when things started to get a little sloppy
with various clichéd/unbelievable character moments. One character
conveniently relating an exact replica story of his past to identify with a
problem situation of the present...a little farfetched. Another completely
artificial and one-dimensional character showing up for only one
purpose...because the script needed someone to show up and mess things up at
that point. And yet another character conveniently becoming a relation to
someone else in the film because it served the script, and nothing else (is
this a soap opera?). All very convenient circumstances which might've been
interesting if they had been made believable. Unfortunately for me, they all
rang false and those three phony moments combined to draw me away from any
attachment that I had developed with the lead characters to that point. Of
course, the film's horrible conclusion also helped solidify my
disappointment in a story which seemed to be aiming for so much, while
ultimately bullseying so little.</P>
<P>The movie also ran on for too long with not enough time spent on the most
interesting aspect of the film...duh, the whole concept of "pay it forward"!
The idea itself was captivating, but just seemed to become more of a
backdrop to the sentimental festivities in the foreground as the movie moved
onwards. I really loved the "pay it forward" moments between people and
would've liked to have seen more of them in the film, perhaps even developed
further. And it's all really too bad because the talent assembled here is as
good as they come. Spacey delivers, as does Hunt, while Osment proves to
everyone that THE SIXTH SENSE was no fluke. But the script, boy-oh-boy, what
the heck happened to the script? It felt like someone else came in about
halfway and reduced it down to this melodramatic slosh pile of faux
circumstances. And even though I was getting a certain "message" from the
film as it progressed (the world can be a better place), the ending just
seemed to flush any enthusiasm that I had for that concept out of me. Also,
the score was way too similar to the one in AMERICAN BEAUTY. C'mon folks,
try a little harder next time, will ya? All in all, a misfire, a decent
attempt at reaching for that higher goal but coming up short. Catch it on
video for the strong performances and try to figure out yourself when
exactly things started going wrong in this film. And yes, you can "pay this"
review forward on to three other people if you like...in fact, please do.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Actor Gary Werntz, the attorney who is one of the first people in the film
to "pay it forward", is in real life, director Mimi Leder's husband.
Not to my surprise, the man who scored the music for this film is also the
same man who scored the music for the Oscar-winning picture AMERICAN BEAUTY.</P>
