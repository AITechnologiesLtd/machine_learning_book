Review: The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2000)<HR></PRE>
<PRE>[3.0/4.0]</PRE>
<P>Many media observers have stated that modern American news coverage by
the mass media has shifted from substantive issue exploration to
tabloid journalism. In an intense competition to garner the most
viewers, issues are presented in a summary manner with only the
salacious details covered. This film is a documentary exploration of a
real individual, Tammy Faye Bakker, at the heart of one particular
scandal. It attempts to portray a broader picture than what could be
understood from news headlines.</P>
<P>In the late 1980's the television empire of Christian evangelists Jim
and Tammy Faye Bakker crumbled beneath allegations of adultery and
corruption. The pair had launched and run the successful PTL (Praise
The Lord) television ministry, which included a broadcast network and
sprawling theme park. Investigative reporting eventually uncovered an
affair between Jim Bakker and a ministry staffer which brought scandal
to the ministry, but it was the eventual revelation of embezzlement
that undid the Bakkers' empire. The public humiliation of the couple
was eagerly covered by the mass media.</P>
<P>The film gives a chronological recounting of Tammy Faye's biography,
concentrating on the details of the collapse of the PTL network. It
divides the events into several chapters which chronicle specific
upturns and downturns in Tammy Faye's fate.</P>
<P>Many viewers will remember Tammy Faye from the original press coverage
as a freakish, maudlin character sporting heavy layers of clownish
make up. The coverage portrayed her as a weepy, cloying whiner and as
a result outsiders may not have had a sympathetic opinion of her. Many
view television evangelists as inherently corrupt, and some were happy
to see the Bakkers punished for living a lavish lifestyle on viewer
donations. Some may have been happy to see the ministers publicly
humiliated for not living up to the principles they preached. The act
of preaching is intrinsically a patronizing relationship between the
preacher and congregation. When a broadcast medium is used for the
communication, some viewers will be offended by the assumption that
the they need to be preached to.</P>
<P>The reality presented by the film shows a less exaggerated, although
still odd, portrait. Tammy Faye lacked the judgmental vitriol of other
evangelists, as demonstrated by her unconditional acceptance
homosexuals and HIV infected patients from the moment the issue came
to public awareness. Although the Bakkers did live well, off the
contributions of others, they do appear to be less corrupt than many
of their contemporaries.</P>
<P>The basic purpose of a documentary is to frame a factual topic and
present the events in a manner that is enlightening and entertaining,
and this film succeeds at this level. For a documentary to excel, it
must raise a larger question and relate the story to a more esoteric
exploration, which this film falls short of. Although it is hampered
by the unwillingness of some of the key participants in the events to
be interviewed, the film is successful in constructing a coherent
narrative. The tone of the story is intentionally kept light in order
to present the quirkiness of the individuals to be entertaining. The
presentation is certainly sympathetic to Tammy Faye, but it does not
shy away from displaying her oddness.</P>
<P>Recommended. The film presents a detailed perspective on events that
were covered by the mass media, and shows that there is a story more
substantive and interesting than the sensational coverage may have
indicated. It falls short of exploring any serious philosophical
issues that a viewer might expect of a documentary, but it is an
entertaining insight into the world of television evangelism, and of
one particularly intriguing individual.</P>
