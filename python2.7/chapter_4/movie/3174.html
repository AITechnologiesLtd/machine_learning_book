<PRE>                              THE JUNGLE BOOK
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1994 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Although Nobel-Prize-winning Rudyard Kipling's stories written in
the late 1800s and early 1900s have already twice been made into film
(once animated, once live), Disney has attempted once again to bring
the story to life as a live adventure.  The story of the law of
"civilized" man vs. the "law of the jungle" seems to be a classic with
which every generation is intrigued.  Our own is no exception.</P>
<P>     If you are old enough to go back to 1942, you will remember
"Sabu."  In 1967, Disney gave us an animated version.  With the 100th
anniversary of the books' first publication, Disney Studios decided the
time was ripe for a brand new, more adventurous, version that would
please not only the youngsters but also adults.</P>
<P>     Mowgli (Jason Scott Lee), who grew up in the jungle not far from
the civilized world, but still apart from it, decides to see what the
rest of the world is like after he catches a glimpse of the lovely
Kitty (Lena Headey).  He is suddenly aware that he has been missing out
on something and wants to see how the rest of the world lives.  Being
friends with jungle animals is great and being able to speak their
language has its advantages but Kitty is a whole other species worth
checking out.</P>
<P>     Captain Boone (Cary Elwes), is the film's villain.  In addition,
he is engaged to Kitty.  When Boone discovers that the jungle holds
treasures of which the outside world is unaware and which he wants to
remove, Mowgli realizes that the so-called "civilized world" can also
contain malicious, greedy people such as Captain Boone.  Mowgli, of
course, is unaware that Mark Twain once said that it was a shame
animals were called "beasts" when, in fact, it is human beings who
contrive and kill not just for food but for treasure and possessions.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Mowgli has a forestful of friends: the wolf (Grey
Brother), the bear (Baloo), and the black panther (Bagheera), who are
all on his side.</P>
<P>     If there is any criticism to be made of the film, it is that some
of the scenes are a bit too ferocious for youngsters accustomed to THE
LION KING, ALADDIN, BAMBI, etc.  THE JUNGLE BOOK movie even has someone
immersed in quicksand.  So use a bit of judgment with your PG-13. On
the other hand we have Sam Neil (Kitty's father) and John Cleese as
Dr. Plumford.  Jason Scott Lee's Mowgli looks more Asian than Indian
but does well as our hero.</P>
