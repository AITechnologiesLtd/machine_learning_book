<P>"He's one of those ass-holes who makes all his movies in black and 
white." So is proclaimed about 1/3 the way through Woody Allen's latest 
film, Celebrity, in a movie theatre scene. As in many of his films, this 
is remark that will make audiences erupt laughter. And yet, this punch 
line is not a line at all, but rather a humorous presentation of a 
statement that can be interpreted in so many different ways. In this 
case, you would need to be already watching Celebrity to figure out that 
the entire movie is in black and white and that this is presented in a 
sarcastic fashion. Here you have a classic Woody Allen move of making a 
great "inside joke" at the expense of his film. That is what has made 
Woody Allen a giant, and that is what Celebrity is made up of.</P>
<P>Celebrity's "plot" is little more than a tribute to Andy Warhole's 
famous theory that everyone will enjoy 15 minute of fame at one time or 
another. Although this is only mentioned once in the 2-hour film, it is 
implied throughout. Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) is a reporter for a 
travel magazine, and constantly finds himself surrounded by the stars 
that he hopes to be among someday. It is made clear very early that this 
has lead him to be slightly less than faithful to his wife Robin (Judy 
Davis). So it is that he asks for a divorce after 16 years of marriage.</P>
<P>Lee and Robin are now in the scenario of dating for the first time in 16 
years, and the film explores the people that they come in contact with. 
The common thread is that almost everybody is either seeking or enjoying 
their 15 minutes in the spotlight. Included in this bunch of people, are 
a movie star, a model, a television producer and several "ordinary 
folks".</P>
<P>In what has almost become a trademark of Woody Allen films, Celebrity 
features a cast full of big names. Although none of Allen's "regulars," 
like</P>
<P>Mariel Hemingway, are in this film, and Allen has also chosen to remain 
behind the camera, those who are shown are great. Celebrity features 
hank Azaria, Dylan Baker, Melanie Griffith, and Winona Ryder in 
supporting roles; not to mention Leonardo DiCaprio in a wonderfully 
eccentric role. There are also cameos by Isaac Mizrahi, Joey Buttafuaco 
and Donald Trump as himself.</P>
<P>In their lead roles, Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, and Ray Montegna, as 
Robin's boyfriend, are spectacular. Branagh has the task of portraying 
Woody Allen, and seems to have mastered his best characteristics. He 
even has the incoherent mumbling, and rambling speech down to a science. </P>
<P>The only real downside to Celebrity is the actual filmmaking. Although I 
give Woody Allen the benefit of the doubt with some of the edgy edits 
and odd camera movement, certain things are just unacceptable in a major 
film like this. Among these is the issue of continuity. In the beginning 
of one scene, Hank Azaria is cleanly shaved. Less than a minute later he 
is sporting scrappy facial hair. And there are other continuity problems 
with costume, hairstyle, and time of day.</P>
<P>When all is said and done, Celebrity is a far cry from Annie Hall or 
Manhattan, but certainly can hold it's own. Woody Allen is still very 
strong, and makes his statement with great effect. The cast makes this 
film a wonderful comic experience and well worth the while.</P>
