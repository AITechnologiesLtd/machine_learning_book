<PRE>"O Brother, Where Art Though?" </PRE>
<P>The Coen brothers are back again, this time with Homer's "Odyssey" as the 
backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a Mississippi chain gang who 
trek across the South to find a secret treasure in "O Brother, Where Art 
Thou?" </P>
<P>Right for the beginning of "O Brother" the Coens grab your attention with a 
chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a 
work song. The camera flows around the hard toiling men, giving a visually 
exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - Ulysses 
Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John 
Turturro) - escaping across a cotton field. It is the beginning of a 
journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of 
the trio. </P>
<P>A strong suite, as always with the Coen brothers, is the depth of character 
of the folks they create in their films. Their characters are goofy and 
comical, like Nicolas Cage in "Raising Arizona"; or, dramatic, as Albert 
Finney and John Turturro in "Miller's Crossing"; and, even a mix of the two 
with Frances McDormand in "Fargo." In all cases, and in "O Brother," too, 
the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people. </P>
<P>Ulysses Everett is a handsome, hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver 
tongue and not a lot in the brains department. But, he seems like a genius 
when compared to the simple, sweet Delmar and the maladjusted Pete, who 
follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1.2 million. 
Their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of Homer's original 
material as they meet all manner of people along the way, including those 
dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a 
Cyclops who beats them and takes all their money. There is magic, too, when 
Delmar believes that Pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens. </P>
<P>The story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures, 
giving the flick a  choppy, episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow. 
Some of the interludes are an epiphany, though. The trio becomes a quartet 
when they pick up guitar-playing Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King) and 
visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere, run by its blind owner 
(Stephen Root). They become the Soggy Bottom Boys for the sightless Radio 
Station Man and, without their knowledge, are recorded as they sing the 
traditional tune, "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow." It is a wonderful moment 
of moviemaking and gives us, in my mind, the best movie song of the year. </P>
<P>Contrasting this and other wonderful moments (the sexy seduction by the 
sirens comes to mind) are some pretentious bits that detract from the 
overall quality of "O Brother." In particular, near the end, is a scene 
where Ulysses, Delmar and Pete crash a Ku Klux Klan rally to save Tommy 
from being lynched. The scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "The 
Wizard of Oz." They don't say "lions and tigers and bears, oh my!" and 
there's no Dorothy, but it is the Land of Oz we're seeing here. </P>
<P>The highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several 
levels. George Clooney is funny, charming, a little dumb and one of the 
handsomest actors in the business today. He has the charm of a 30's movie 
idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity. Ulysses 
has an ongoing obsession with his hair, risking life and limb to get a 
particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets. His vanity will come 
to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer. </P>
<P>While Clooney is the name draw for "O Brother," the show stealer is Tim 
Blake Nelson as Delmar. The heretofore unknown Nelson is terrific as the 
simple convict who, at one point, hears the word of the Lord and joins 
members of a church congregation in their mass baptism. Delmar is saved and 
dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple 
character that makes him shine. The taciturn Pete, as played by longtime 
Coen collaborator Turturro, is the sullen member of the trio and gives them 
the necessary angst. 
All together, the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the Three Stooges and the 
Three Musketeers as they prove to be buffoons, albeit brave ones. </P>
<P>The colorful supporting cast is rampant with Homerian characters to meet 
and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey. Charles Durning appears 
as incumbent governor Pappy O'Daniel, who keeps crossing paths with them in 
his bid for re-election. John Goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible 
salesman and con artist, Big Dan Teague. Michael Badalucco is manic and 
outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary, George "Babyface" 
Nelson. Stephen Root is amusing as the blind DJ, rep'ing one of the many 
references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways. Holly 
Hunter is wasted in the small role as Ulysses' estranged wife, Penny (and 
the real reason for this adventure, not secret treasure). </P>
<P>Techs are, as expected in a Coen brothers venture, first class. 
Cinematographer Roger Deakins, who has worked on five previous Coen films, 
captures the sultry atmosphere of the South. The photography complements 
the lush period production and costume provided by Dennis Gassner and Mary 
Zophres, respectively. Once again, Roderick Jaynes - the alter ego of Ethan 
and Joel Coen - is on board as editor. </P>
<P>The high points outweigh the low through most of "O Brother, Where Art 
Thou?" with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and 
traditional music. I give it a B. </P>
