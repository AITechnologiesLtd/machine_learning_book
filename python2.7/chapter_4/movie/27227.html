Thirteen Days</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>Sharply percussive snare drum hits shatter the high flying violin song 
as nuclear rockets dash across the screen leaving mushroom clouds in 
their wake. This is not the opening sequence of some light tale. </P>
<P>October 1962, the country is oblivious to the tension reeling through 
JFK, brother Bobby, and adviser to the president played by Kevin 
Costner. Soviet Russia builds nuclear weapons in Cuba; will the USA 
strike first to eliminate the threat or opt for negotiations with an 
untrustworthy government? </P>
<P>"Thirteen Days" paints a Norman Rockwell picture perfect image of 1962 
... even dropping into black and white (or blue and white) for effect. 
And launches from there into a highly compelling spiral of 
argumentation, politics and diplomacy. All the while, the threatening 
black cloud of nuclear holocaust descends ever nearer the most powerful 
nation in the world. </P>
<P>The military brass pressures JFK, "Order now and we'll be able to invade 
and take over Cuba in 8 days;" their pleas as insistent as television 
mail ads ... "Order now, Order now, Order now." Kennedy is torn, tending 
to the decision with grave seriousness, "There's something immoral about 
abandoning your own judgment." </P>
<P>His assistant offers a double-edged reassurance, "There is no wise old 
man, there's just us." </P>
<P>It's a long film that sneaks up on you. Enjoying the nostalgic view back 
into the 60's, and barely tolerating the fake accents, I didn't realize 
how much the tension had crawled from the screen under my skin. Then 
when JFK's publicity guy announces to the public that JFK will speak 
regarding a matter of the "highest urgency" - I felt my throat tighten 
in pain as if my country sincerely was in danger. </P>
<P>And though, I could tell you with certainty that outcome of the Cuban 
Missile Crisis did not involve nuclear war ... I was still engaged 
firmly in this power play of politics and military muscling. Whew!!!! We 
won. </P>
