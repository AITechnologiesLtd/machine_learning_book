                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>

Canadian-Australian production. Released by Samuel Goldwyn Co. 
100 mins. Rated R (graphic violence). </P>
<P>Australian Bruce Beresford is an "auteur" filmmaker, less for 
his style than for the consistency of his world-view . He is a 
master of ethnic characterizations: rambunctious Aussies 
(DON'S PARTY); an independent Australian girl (THE GETTING OF 
WISDOM); American country folk (TENDER MERCIES); 
U.S.Southerners (CRIMES OF THE HEART), a colonial African 
infatuated with things British (MISTER JOHNSON).Beresford is 
also preoccupied with ethnic or racial groups in the process 
of clashing, evolving or coming to terms: THE FRINGE DWELLERS 
(aborigines), MISTER JOHNSON, DRIVING MISS DAISY.</P>
<P>BLACK ROBE fits those schemes perfectly. In 1634 New France 
(Quebec),  Jesuit Father Laforgue (Bluteau)  a young French 
missionary, is assigned by the famous geographer/statesman 
Champlain to trek some 1500 miles to the mission in a Huron 
settlement. Blackrobe, as the Indians call him, is accompanied 
by eight canoefuls of Algonquins and young French translator 
Daniel (Young). </P>
<P>The trip through the wintry wilderness is a physical adventure 
for all, a sentimental journey for Daniel who falls in love 
with chief Chomina's (Schellenberg) daughter Annuka (Holt), 
and a spiritual voyage for Father Laforgue. </P>
<P>Nature is alien to the Frenchmen but not beyond their grasp. 
The cultures however are mutually uncomprehending. The Indians 
see the Europeans as ugly, stupid and speaking in riddles, 
even as demons.  Father Laforgue suffers from carnal 
temptation (he mortifies his flesh after seeing Daniel and 
Annuka making love) and from Christian doubts about his 
mission to "bring about the salvation of these poor 
barbarians." </P>
<P>The journey takes the party through gorgeously wild 
landscapes. The  Algonquins abandon the devil Blackrobe, but 
return, for mixed reasons: to keep their word to protect the 
priest and from fear of reprisals by Champlain. The party is 
attacked by the Iroquois, the survivors are tortured, in 
harrowing scenes considerably toned down from the novel. 
Annuka, Chomina and the two Frenchmen escape.   Blackrobe 
reaches his destination alone and with renewed faith. </P>
<P>We were really never in doubt about the solidity of his  
beliefs. Among the clues: the Father visualized a cathedral's 
pillars while looking at a canopy of trees -- a risky old 
romantic metaphor, but  in this context not a cliche.   </P>
<P>The movie inevitably brings to mind THE MISSION and DANCES 
WITH WOLVES. Yet it is infinitely more metaphysical, authentic 
and un-Hollywoodish than DANCES. Like that picture, it 
subtitles the native languages. Its critical reception was 
even better than for the Costner film, but unlike the latter, 
BLACK ROBE seems to have had no budget for promotion, media 
exposure and hype. Since it was a severe affair without any 
feelgood fireworks or aspects, it was seen by few people.</P>
<P>BLACK ROBE raises a not-entertaining moral question: why 
proselytize?  It offers no facile answers and though made in 
our revisionist times of comparative ethnography, neither 
prettifies, romanticizes, analyzes or "un-savages" the North 
American Natives. Nor does it elevate or deride the 
spirituality of Father Laforgue. Blackrobe is totally a true 
believer of his period, sustained by a faith which stipulates 
that salvation is conceivable only within the Catholic Church. </P>
<P>This is a 1634 movie, not a 1991 one. It comes close to an 
audiovisual version of diaries or memoirs by explorers of the 
time. There are minimal concessions: Algonquins twice --and 
surprisingly-- utter good English; Annuka is played by an 
exotic but not Algonquinish fashion model.(The other actors 
too are unknown to U.S. audiences, except for Bluteau, the 
lead in JESUS OF MONTREAL.)  </P>
<P>Ideologies aside, BLACK ROBE is an esthetic triumph. The 
natural settings are extraordinary. Production design, 
costumes, as well as the performances make everything look 
genuine. Rhythm and editing are superior. The photography by 
Peter James (DRIVING MISS DAISY) is exquisite. Georges 
Delerue's romantic score is perfectly dosed.  With the demise 
of Film Societies, whatever audiences exist for this work will 
see it on video. How sad. BLAK ROBE needs a large theater 
screen. </P>
