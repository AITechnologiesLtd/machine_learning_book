<PRE>                               JURASSIC PARK
                       A film review by David Milner
                        Copyright 1993 David Milner</PRE>
<P>     When JURASSIC PARK was released, history was made.  Forget that it
will probably go on to become the highest grossing film of all time.
Some other motion picture will undoubtedly eventually top it.  Forget
that the special effects far surpass anything that has ever been seen
on the screen before.  There undoubtedly will be improvements made in
the techniques used, and someday, as hard as this may be to imagine
now, the film may actually look a little crude.  What makes JURASSIC
PARK such a unique event is that it fulfills a lifetime of dreams for
millions of people as no other motion picture ever has, or probably
ever will.</P>
<P>     The special effects are indeed spectacular.  Just as STAR WARS set
a new standard back in 1977, so, too, does JURASSIC PARK.  Both the
full-sized dinosaur models created by Stan Winston and the dinosaur
images generated with computers are extremely convincing.  About the
only thing that would have improved the special effects is seeing more
of them.</P>
<P>     The screenplay, however, does leaves something to be desired.
There is almost no plot, and this frankly makes the film a little
dull.  Also, a few of the lines warning about the perils of unbridled
scientific research seem forced, leaving the audience wondering, "where
did this come from," or "what does this have to do with anything."</P>
<P>     When John Hammond, the founder of Jurassic Park, first uses the
line, "we spared no expense," he does so almost with the pride of a new
father.  However, as he repeats it throughout the film, the gradual
change in his outlook from boundless optimism to hopeless despair
becomes apparent.  This is one of the more inspired ideas incorporated
into the screenplay.</P>
<P>     Despite its suspenseful atmosphere, JURASSIC PARK does have a few
very funny moments in it.  The tension of the sequence featuring the
tyrannosaur chasing after a jeep is broken when the dinosaur is seen in
one of the jeep's rear-view mirrors with "objects in the mirror are
closer than they appear" printed on it, and there are some great
one-liners delivered by Ian Malcolm, the chaos theorist.</P>
<P>     The dinosaurs in the film are portrayed much more authentically
than those in any other motion picture.  Dr.  John Horner, a highly
regarded paleontologist, served as an advisor on the film, and a great
deal of time was spent studying the behavior of living animals closely
related to dinosaurs such as frogs and lizards.  However, there were
still a few liberties taken.  Real dilophosaurs, for example, were in
fact much larger than those seen in the film, and they did not spit, or
have frills around their necks.  Also, even though velociraptors were
among the most intelligent of the dinosaurs, most paleontologists agree
that they were only about as bright as chickens.  This makes it
extremely unlikely that they would have been able to learn to open
doors.</P>
<P>     It is fitting that there is a reference to Dr.  Robert Bakker made
in the film.  He, like Dr.  Horner, has contributed a great deal to the
field of paleontology in the past few years, and his book, THE DINOSAUR
HERESIES, is a must for anyone interested in dinosaurs.</P>
<P>     As director Steven Spielberg has been quoted as saying, JURASSIC
PARK is not a film for young children.  It simply is much too violent.
Given this, it is difficult to understand why there were elements that
could appeal only to them, such as the transformation of Dr.  Grant
from someone who dislikes children to someone who accepts them,
included in the film.</P>
<P>     The acting is generally good, but not outstanding.  Sir [now Lord]
Richard Attenborough does give an outstanding performance as John
Hammond, but Sam Neill, who plays Dr. Alan Grant, the paleontologist
brought in to help allay the fears of the investors in Jurassic Park,
and Laura Dern, who plays Dr. Ellie Sattler, the paleobiologist, both
seem a little uneasy in their roles at times.  Jeff Goldblum, too,
gives a slightly inconsistent performance as Ian Malcolm.</P>
<P>     Something that is left unanswered in the film is why a chaos
theorist, who would know virtually nothing about dinosaurs, would be
asked to give his approval to Jurassic Park.  The real answer, of
course, is that chaos theory just happened to be a hot topic when
JURASSIC PARK was being written, but some explanation for this should
have been given in the film.</P>
<P>     John Williams' score is very good, but it is not one of his best.
The music heard during the film's more dramatic moments is very
affecting, but both the slow Jurassic Park theme and the fanfare are a
little too simplistic.</P>
<P>     The sound effects, for the most part, also are good.  However, a
few of the roars produced by the tyrannosaur sound a little too much
like a car horn, and not enough like a noise a living animal would
make.</P>
<P>     The new DTS, or Digital Theatre Sound, system tried out for the
first time with JURASSIC PARK is very impressive.  The increased
clarity and dynamic range allowed for by storing the soundtrack not on
the film itself, but instead on a separate compact disc, really do add
something to the experience of watching a film.</P>
<P>     There is no question that a sequel will be produced.  The loose
ends left in the film show that this was the intention from the start.
Audiences undoubtedly will enjoy seeing more of the magnificent special
effects that made JURASSIC PARK so successful, but it would be nice if
the sequel turned out to be a little better film overall.</P>
