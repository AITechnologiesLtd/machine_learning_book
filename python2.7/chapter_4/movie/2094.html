<P>     Jack Charles (Patrick Swayze) is a small time crook with a glib
answer for every question and two kids in foster care.  When his
daughter Kelly (Sabrina Lloyd) escapes from juvenile hall and locates
her father, Jack tries his hardest to get rid of her, but she persuades
him to look for his son Eddie (Brian Bonsall), who is being placed in
the same unpleasant place she escaped from, where children are
handcuffed and abused.  Recognizing the conditions Eddie could be
subjected to, Jack kidnaps him from the authorities at gun point, then
goes on the run with both kids in tow.</P>
<P>     Unless infused with some sort of unique energy, road pictures have
become a worn-out genre, as proved by FATHER HOOD.  It's a mystery to
me why films like this get made.  Do we really need to spend ninety
minutes following the misadventures of two children and an adult (who
often displays less maturity than his offspring) as they run around the
country trying to get to know one another?  How many hundreds of movies
and television shows have had the same plot?</P>
<P>     There is little to relieve the tedium of this film, except an
impressive performance by little-known actress Sabrina Lloyd.
Unfortunately, this is not the movie anyone wants to have it said that
they gave their most memorable performance in.  Hopefully, someone will
give her another shot in something where she'll have an opportunity to
catch someone's attention.</P>
<P>     If I had cared about the characters, perhaps the unbelievable
number of plot implausibilities wouldn't have bothered me as much, but
no one in this film manages to grab more than a token amount of
sympathy, especially not Jack, who is an annoying, arrogant jerk.  Give
Patrick Swayze credit (if you want to call it that) for playing this
guy with the right amount of sleaze to get the audience to actively
dislike him.  Unfortunately, when he turns over a new leaf (as is
inevitable), it's tough to accept.</P>
<P>     The two kids have their moments.  Actually, I should say that
Lloyd's Kelly has her moments.  Eddie, as played by Brian Bonsall, a
young actor of limited appeal and talent, is pretty much a nonentity.
The script tries too hard to manipulate the audience into sympathizing
with them, and that immediately put me on guard.  Movies of substance
rarely resort to such blatant emotional trickery.</P>
<P>     Small roles are given to notables like Diane Ladd and Michael
Ironside, but these two hardly have more than a few moments on screen.
Halle Berry, who's given second billing behind Swayze, doesn't have a
role that's much more significant.  It's an understatement to say that
her talent is wasted.  I'd be curious to know why she agreed to do this
film (the answer must have to do with the phrase "big paycheck").</P>
<P>     On top of all this, as if sitting through this movie isn't a bad
enough experience in the first place, the film makers manage to steal
away any possible tension through their structuring of the story.
We're given the ending to start with then, knowing exactly how
everything is going to turn out, we're forced to sit through the
details via an extended flashback.</P>
<P>     FATHER HOOD comes complete with a social message that's as old as
Dickens' OLIVER TWIST.  Foster care in the United States has come under
increasing scrutiny in recent years as more and more cases of abuse are
revealed.  While I would support a movie that grapples with the problem
sensitively and intelligently, this is not that film.  It takes a good-
guy, bad-guy approach to the situation and presents it from a decidedly
singleminded viewpoint designed to stir the viewer's emotions, not make
him or her think about the seriousness of what's going on.  In fact,
the low quality of FATHER HOOD may actually sabotage the message it's
trying to get across.</P>
<P>     Recently, an Italian film called IL LADRO DI BAMBINI (STOLEN
CHILDREN) covered a lot of the same ground.  That too was a road film
featuring an older, somewhat callous guardian and the two children he
was entrusted with.  The similarities extend no further than plot
structure and character background, because IL LADRO DI BAMBINI is an
excellent movie, and viewing it makes the faults of FATHER HOOD seem
that much more glaring.</P>
<P>     There may not have been many like me, but I was actually impressed
by Patrick Swayze's performance in CITY OF JOY.  I thought he had taken
a big step towards turning around his popcorn-and-soda reputation.  But
with the release of this example of ugliness, I may have to admit to
being mistaken.  And "mistake" is a key word here, because that's
exactly what this entire production is.</P>
