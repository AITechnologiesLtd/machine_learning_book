<P>After toiling around on the beach all day, this film seemed perfectly fit to
cap off my nite. Packed with a bevy of beauties, impeccably shaped men,
beach parties and rich phoniness, the film appeared genuinely set to deliver
thrills, chills, T&A shots, steamy sex scenes and a tiny bit of cheesy fun.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A girl with head issues is released from a psychiatric hospital and given
another chance to re-enter society as the "summer help" at a rich, snooty
country club. Soon enough, she is taken into the fold of the inner rich,
snooty kids who seem to enjoy her company. It isn't long before the truth of
the matter unfolds, and things begin to get real nasty.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Lots of hard bodies, not enough T&A, a semi-interesting setup, not enough
unpredictability, a few decent actors, but not enough good ones make this
film watchable and somewhat of a guilty pleasure, but certainly not good
enough to recommend on any sort of enthusiastic level. Sure I enjoyed
watching the boys and girls frolicking around on the beach. Sure I liked the
whole "which girl is the bigger psycho bitch" angle which kept popping in
and out of my head during the whole movie. And sure I did enjoy the whole
over-the-top Denise Richards/Carmen Electra look-a-like performance by Susan
Ward, but all in all, the film just didn't click enough points of interest
to be considered anything more than a teen soap-opera filmed for the big
screen. In fact, as much as I did get into some of the story's original
setup, I couldn't help but predict every coming moment as the film stepped
forward.</P>
<P>And where was all the action? For a thriller, this film sure did spend a lot
of time on the getting-to-know everyone scenario, and not enough on the
actual moments of tension or suspense, all of which were conspicuously
absent. Sure, I was never really bored during the flick, enjoyed the
grandiose phoniness of the queen bitch and her make-up clad sprinkle
girlfriends, and the performance put forth by Bobby aka Nathan Bexton. But
other than the main trio, the rest of the cast was basically just a bunch of
stale, one-dimensional characters, which under these circumstances didn't
bother me. With the focus on the primary two girls, the cardboard cutout
designation of the secondary players just didn't seem to matter that much to
me. The film definitely does not need to be seen on the big screen, but
might be enjoyed on a smaller level, if you're bored at home one night,
looking for a little cheesy fake fun, and like the ol' crazy bitch on the
loose type flicks, rent it and get a bonus shot of Susan Ward's breasts to
boot (although more sex and definitely more skin would have appreciated by
this film's teen target audience...what were they thinking?). But I guess
that's why the lesbian under-and-overtones were tossed into the mix, eh?</P>
<PRE>Overall, pretty ho-hum...next!!</PRE>
