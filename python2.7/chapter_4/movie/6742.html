<PRE>                         THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        With nearly all the critics in the world calling THE PEOPLE 
VS. LARRY FLYNT  the best movie of 1996 and most major religious 
figures decrying it from the pulpit, this movie was top on my list of 
movies to see this holiday season. TURBULENCE and THE RELIC 
can wait, because this movie's got everyone shaken up in one way or 
another. The movie theater people were actually checking IDs and for 
this one so you know it's controversial. And yes, it is damn good.</P>
<P>        THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT tells the fascinating true 
story of a low-class man's rise to fame through the exploitation of 
nude women. Larry Flynt, played by Woody Harrelson, is stereotypical 
white trash running a series of seedy strip joints when he gets the 
idea to publish a newsletter to promote it. The newsletter is, of course, 
a bunch of topless photos, and that leads to the establishment of 
Hustler magazine, which begins selling millions of copies an issue 
once it prints nude pictures of Jackie Onassis.</P>
<P>        Hustler, like Flynt himself, is undisguised perversion. It 
doesn't have the pretenses of the higher-class Playboy, which tries 
to mix articles and interviews with the photo spreads. Hustler focuses 
solely on sex, and so does Flynt. It's Playboy for the common 
pervert -- sure there's the Playboy Mansion, but wouldn't most 
people rather visit the Hustler Mobile Home?</P>
<P>        With the success of Hustler, Flynt becomes rich and 
influential but retains the same set of friends and associates as 
before. Making the journey with him is bisexual stripper Althea 
(Courtney Love, of Hole), who becomes his wife early in the film. 
Swingers that they are, though, they scoff at the notion of 
marriage and monogamy being interrelated. There are a couple 
sex scenes in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, and Love 
does appear in the buff many a time. Being subjected to her 
naked body so many times, I'm starting to get an idea of why 
Kurt Cobain shot himself.</P>
<P>        With the graphic pictures and cartoons in his magazine, 
outcries are inevitable. Flynt goes to court three times in the 
movie, twice because he's being sued by the Reverend Jerry 
Falwell for printing a parody ad that quotes Falwell as saying he 
had sex with his mother in an outhouse. The court scenes are 
the most memorable in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, 
particularly the scene in which Flynt decides to get back at the 
system by throwing an orange at the judge and wearing the 
American flag as a diaper.</P>
<P>        Life is a long, twisted trip for Mr. and Mrs. Flynt. He turns 
to God after much prodding from the President's sister, Ruth 
Carter Stapleton, but his outlook remains as sex-saturated and 
blasphemous as before. Once he is shot by an unknown sniper 
and ends up paralyzed from the waist down, he abandons his 
belief in God entirely and gets hooked on various forms of 
drugs, legal and illegal, to ease the pain. Althea too finds herself 
hooked on heroin and eventually dies of AIDS.</P>
<P>        THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT has a compelling story 
that is most interesting for trying to paint Flynt as some kind of 
folk hero but only making him look more insane and perverse. 
Harrelson did a great job portraying a complicated man who 
has at least a small degree of mental illness, but the big acting 
trophy here should go to Love. I never would have pegged her 
as someone who would make the transition from music video 
to movies so successfully on the first try.</P>
<P>        The movie depicts a lot of depravity and is uncomfortable 
to watch at times, but still brings with it a very powerful and very 
true theme -- that the First Amendment of the United States 
should provide freedom of expression for everyone. Defining 
obscenity is difficult and undeniably subjective, but as this 
movie points out, outlawing one form of speech could lead to 
the outlawing of other forms. Flynt may not be the picture 
perfect messenger but the message is at the heart of 
American freedom.</P>
