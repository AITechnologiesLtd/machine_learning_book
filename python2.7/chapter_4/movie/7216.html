<P>     KOLYA is one of the richest films I've seen in some time.  Zdenek
Sverak plays a confirmed old bachelor (who's likely to remain so), who
finds his life as a Czech cellist increasingly impacted by the five-year
old boy that he's taking care of.  Though it ends rather abruptly-- and
I'm whining, 'cause I wanted to spend more time with these characters--
the acting, writing, and production values are as high as, if not higher
than, comparable American dramas.  This father-and-son delight-- Sverak
also wrote the script, while his son, Jan, directed-- won a Golden Globe
for best Foreign Language film and, a couple days after I saw it, walked
away an Oscar.  In Czech and Russian, with English subtitles.</P>
