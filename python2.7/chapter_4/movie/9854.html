<P>   Any film which holds that New York City is boring when
compared with Savannah, Georgia--and then goes right
about proving it beyond reasonable doubt--has got to have
something going for it.  "Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil" surely does: it is, as its principal character says, "like
'Gone with the Wind' on mescaline."  Effectively combining
Gothic ambiance with supernatural elements, a Rashomon-
like murder mystery, a gripping trial scene, and a host of
eccentric characters who learn to live together and love one
another, "Midnight" is a conceptual triumph, a true original.
Score yet another for Clint Eastwood, once again in the role
of director, whose stunning daughter Alison handles a fairly
demanding role with confidence.</P>
<P>   Photographed with lush colors by Jack N. Green in the
handsome central historic district of Savannah, "Midnight in
the Garden of Good and Evil" is a hefty two hours and thirty-
five minutes in length, its complexities justifying its ambitious
reach.  Centering on a court case far more intricate than that
shown in Paramount Pictures' "The Rainmaker" (released at
the same time), "Midnight" is one of the those stories which
expose outsiders to cultures of which they are only vaguely
familiar, unmasking parts of the world which change their
lives--and those of the local communities whose existence
they touch.</P>
<P>   The action is propelled by a visit from New York journalist
John Kelso (John Cusack) to the southern town of
Savannah, Georgia, to cover a lavish, annual Christmas
bash for "Town and Country" magazine.  The party is hosted
each year by antiques dealer Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey),
who made a fortune eleven years earlier reconstructing old
homes and has filled his own 137-year-old home with
expensive relics.  His is an area filled with people who march
to the beats of their own drummers, including a man who
walks an invisible Labrador Retriever, another who is seen in
the company of his pet horseflies, a lively widow who attends
Williams' functions with a drink in one hand and a small gun
in the other, and a violent young man who remains on
Williams's payroll despite his history of threats against his
boss.  Those who do not "make the cut" and must settle for
making their own festivities include a voodoo priestess who
communes with the dead and an outrageous transvestite
who does stand-up comedy at the local club.</P>
<P>   What changes the lives of the journalist, who had written
only one minor book, and the millionaire party-giver, who
mutates from the town celebrity to an inmate in the county
jail, is the death by gunshot of the frenzied Billy Hanson
(Jude Law) who, we soon learn, is Williams's homosexual
lover.  Pleading self-defense, Williams is nonetheless
indicted for Murder One: the outcome of the trial is
dependent in no small part on the community's prejudice
against homosexual affairs on the one hand and the
affection, on the other, which many have for young Billy--who
had serviced quite a number of both sexes to their
satisfaction.</P>
<P>   While the murder trial holds the story's center, director
Eastwood has lots of time to meander about the town,
closely developing several characters to show their effects
on the rather innocent Yankee who seems at all times on the
verge of opening his mouth in surprise.  Minerva (Irma P.
Hall), the voodoo priestess who speaks with equal ease to
squirrels and to the dead, meets the New Yorker at a
gravesite in the titled garden, a place in which good is
performed between the hours and 11:30 p.m. and midnight
followed by evil during the subsequent half hour.  She insists
that Billy's body cannot rise to heaven until justice is served,
and her machinations prove crucial to the outcome of the
case.  Much attention is given as well to the Lady Chablis, a
transvestite who plays herself in the film, and one whose role
is quite well acted though repetitious, overblown and by now
thoroughly hackneyed.  Perhaps the most vivid scene
displays not the party in Williams's historic home but the
debutante cotillion ball, an annual event in the lives of the
city's Black upper crust.  </P>
<P>   Filled with humor, metaphysical ruminations, and superior
ensemble performances especially by the inimitable Kevin
Spacey, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" is in no
small part an expression of love for an American South
which has all but passed by in our post-bellum era, an area
with pockets of individuality that easily rival urban centers
like New York, L.A. and Chicago.  Rated R.  Running Time:
155 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
