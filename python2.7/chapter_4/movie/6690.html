<PRE>                       FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks

<PRE>(1982) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        It's January 1997 and, believe it or not, I just saw Fast 
Times at Ridgemont High for the first time. Like many other 
80's favorites that people have been pleading for me to watch and 
review, it didn't live up to its overinflated hype, but it was still 
entertaining, and captured the essence of the early 80's, from the 
primitive video games to fashions and slang. One thing director 
Amy Heckerling always manages to do well in these aimless teen 
comedies (e.g. CLUELESS) is integrate what is current-at-the-
moment clothes and dialect. This may tend to date her movies, 
but it also serves as an accessible time capsule to that time.</P>
<P>        The movie, based on Cameron Crowe's supposedly factual 
book, centers around a group of high school kids, most of which 
work at the mall. Judge Reinhold takes pride in his burger-flipping 
job, a very young-looking Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates 
work at a dine-in pizza parlor, and dorky Brian Backer takes movie 
tickets while his slimeball friend Robert Romanus scalps concert 
tickets. The unemployed characters are also seen around the mall, 
with Sean Penn's pothead character Jeff Spicoli attempting to get 
service sans shirt in Reinhold's burger joint and beefy football player 
Forrest Whitaker shoving quarter after quarter into Space Invaders 
and Pac-Man.</P>
<P>        There are plenty of in-school scenes featuring two teachers 
on opposite sides of the spectrum. Vincent Schiavelli is the nervous, 
outgoing type who wants all the kids to like him and Ray Walston is 
the crusty old fart who runs his class like a military outfit. Walston's 
main problem is braindead Spicoli (undoubtedly the inspiration for 
the BILL & TED movies), who disrupts class on a regular basis and 
even has a pizza delivered to the classroom one day.</P>
<P>        In the Heckerling tradition, there's not much of a plot, just 
a series of loosely related scenes, most of which involve sex. Cates 
schools Leigh on a certain sexual technique, Backer tries to work up 
the courage to ask Leigh out, Reinhold is walked in on by Cates 
during an intimate personal moment, Penn trashes Whitaker's car, 
and so on. These anecdotal-type scenes work as a whole and manage 
to be almost poignant, especially in its telling of Leigh's disastrous 
history with men and boys.</P>
<P>        Cameron Crowe, who has recently hit it big with the 
wonderful JERRY MAGUIRE, knows how people act and interact, 
and scripts it well. The ensemble cast acts it well, particularly Penn 
and Leigh. FAST TIMES is a quintessentially 80's movie, which 
means it includes sex and nudity. Leigh and Cates disrobed because 
everyone had to in order to make it big in the 80's. Nudity is a rare 
commodity these days, and this movie is still cut to shreds when 
aired on TV, so splurge for the fifty-cent video rental, especially if 
you're interested in seeing Phoebe Cates' breasts.</P>
