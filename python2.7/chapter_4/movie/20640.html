BLINK (1994)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>According to the video distributor in my country, BLINK,
1994 movie by Michael Apted, was awarded as the best
thriller for that year. That wasn't enough for this film to
be picked from the multitude of different thrillers that
used to flood the video store shelves few years ago. But I
remembered Michael Apted as a director of very interesting,
although not too successful 1983 thriller GORKY PARK. I also
noticed Madeleine Stowe, an actress I like very much, in a
lead role. That was enough for me to pick this film and I
didn't regret it later.</P>
<P>Unlike many formulaic, by-the-numbers, thrillers, and
despite its "high concept" premise, BLINK, scripted by Dana
Stevens, has a rather complicated plot. Emma Brody (played
by Stowe) was blinded by her abusive mother in childhood.
Years have passed, and Emma, being adapted to darkness,
became a folk musician in Chicago. But the new improvements
in medical technology allowed her to see again through
donated eyes. Emma has some problems adapting to the new,
strange and now visible world, and additional problem comes
from a rare phenomena called "delayed vision" - her brain
tends to receive old visual signals from her eyes. That same
problem would get her in trouble when her next door
neighbour gets murdered and she begins thinking that she saw
the suspect. John Hallstrom (played by Aidan Quinn),
detective on the case, is, of course, sceptical towards her
claims, but, on the other hand, very attracted to her.</P>
<P>What differentiates this thriller from many others is the
fact that it isn't so clearly defined in the terms of genre.
BLINK mixes thriller with the elements of psychological
drama, love story and comedy. Those other genre elements,
although not so overwhelming, and together with urban
Chicago setting, bring a breath of every day life realism
into the story that would otherwise look like lifeless "high
concept" product. But BLINK still has thriller credentials,
and it is still a very suspenseful and exciting film. Most of
the suspense comes from the fact that in many scenes the
audience, same as movie's heroine, doesn't know whether to
believe or not to believe the sight. Also, the movie has
rather original villain with even more original agenda, and
the ending is somewhat unusual for this kind of film. What
makes this film ultimately work are the actors. Madeleine
Stowe, one of the most remarkable actresses in modern
Hollywood gave a very good performance in her role of a
blind woman frightened by the new and sudden perception of
world. Aidan Quinn, who used to work with Stowe in Badham's
STAKEOUT, has a really good chemistry with her, and his
performance of cynical yet dedicated policeman is fine too.
Music by the folk band "Drovers" delivers a soundtrack which
is refreshingly new for this kind of films. All in all, the
video distributors didn't lie - BLINK is a very good
thriller that deserves more than a glimpse from those who
want originality in that genre.</P>
