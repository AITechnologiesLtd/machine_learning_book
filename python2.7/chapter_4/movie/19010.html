<P>TARZAN ** (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers ( <A HREF="mailto:tarzan@filmfreakcentral.net">tarzan@filmfreakcentral.net</A> )</P>
<P>starring the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Brian
Blessed
screenplay by Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, Noni White,
based on 'Tarzan Of The Apes" by Edgar Rice Burroughs
directed by Chris Buck and Kevin Lima</P>
<P>Parody him, give him a syndicated television series, put a tuxedo on
him, it doesn't matter: to paraphrase Led  Zeppelin, Tarzan remains
the same; he's a simplistic tribute to primeval man. The basic story
of a baby abandoned in the jungle who is raised by apes has been
filmed more times than any other, if only because Burrough's book is
in the public domain. Now that Disney has appropriated the character
for use in its annual summer cartoon, I'm not even sure I can type
"Tarzan" without the Registered Trademark symbol. And just because
they've animated him doesn't mean they've liberated him: Disney's
swift, agile Tarzan is, personality-wise, as yawn inducing as previous
incarnations. The movie itself is an uneasy hybrid of conflicting
formulas. </P>
<P>Tarzan commences with a rousing sequence that depicts the parallel
lives of Tarzan's parents and parents-to-be. Shipwrecked, Tarzan's
human mother and father build a treehouse, and successfully tend to
their baby until disaster strikes in the form of a hungry leopard.
Kala (Close), a mother gorilla whose new child was similarly devoured,
discovers Tarzan squirming in a cradle and adopts him instantly; her
husband,  Kerchak (Lance Henriksen), refuses to acknowledge the boy as
a son based solely on his human appearance. The years pass, and Tarzan
learns to negotiate the forest like his ape protectors. Then he
encounters Jane (Driver), who is on expedition with her father and a
big game hunter named Clayton (Blessed); they are three people who
look more like him than anyone else in the jungle, so he suffers a
brief but potent crisis of identity. </P>
<P>Two gaping plot holes occurred to me as I watched Tarzan '99. First,
let me establish that Tarzan and his primate friends speak English for
our sake, but it's understood that they're babbling variations of
"Oo-oo-ee-ee-ah-ah" to each other. So why is Tarzan able to introduce
himself to Jane as "Tarzan"? </P>
<P>Then there's the issue of Clayton. Everybody's inexplicably surprised
when he betrays his escorts and sets trap for the gorillas. If the
Snidely Whiplash-moustache and double-barreled shotgun were not clues
enough, surely the fact that he excitedly asked Tarzan over and over
again "Where are the gorillas?" was a bold sign that he had ulterior
motives for being in Africa. </P>
<P>The film rehashes the The Lion King's irritating time-compression
technique: Tarzan's formative years are skipped entirely with a lap
dissolve of preteen Tarzan to adult Tarzan-the film misses its only
opportunity to be innovative by dismissing his maturation. What would
adolescence be like for Tarzan? If one was raised by apes, would(n't)
one develop a sexual attraction to some of them? The film hints at a
burgeoning romance between Tarzan and Turk, a girlla, that is
interrupted by the arrival of Jane, but if Turk has more than platonic
feelings, they remain as subtext. </P>
<P>Such depth, not to mention a beastiality subplot, would be out of
place in a Disney film, anyway. After said opening, Tarzan goes bland.
(This includes Phil Collins' song score, which is elevator music for
the wild.) It answers questions of racism and gun control with a big
smiley face. It preaches against poaching only slightly more
effectively than last year's lame remake of Mighty Joe Young. It
provides unnecessary, obnoxious sidekicks for our hero in the form of
the aforementioned Turk (Rosie O'Donnell in a grating vocal
performance) and an aw-shucks elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight). It
offers not a single moment of surprise in its climax. None of this
quite meshes with the conventions of Burrough's Tarzan tales-I can't
determine which recipe has been shoehorned into the other. (Does it
occur to children weaned on the new Disney movies that they're
watching the same story over and over again? Pocahontas, Mulan, and
Tarzan fit into the same rigid paradigm, yet they're respectively
based on an American legend, Chinese folklore, and a beloved modern
mythology.) </P>
<P>One aspect of this Tarzan does enthrall. I'm talking about its
resplendent design, of course, a seamless blend of digital and
traditional animation techniques-the two are most complementary during
the "Deep Canvas" action scenes, which will undoubtedly be diminished
on the small screen. (They are perhaps reason enough to see Tarzan at
the cinema.) Tarzan soars through the trees like a surfer coasting on
an imaginary wave (indeed, his liquid movements were modeled after one
animator's skateboarding kid). If only he defied our expectations as
well as gravity.</P>
