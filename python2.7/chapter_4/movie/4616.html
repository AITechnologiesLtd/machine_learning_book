<PRE>                                SCREAMERS
                       A film review by Lewis Butler
                        Copyright 1995 Lewis Butler</PRE>
<P>You thought PUPPETMASTERS was bad?  You thought FRIDAY THE 13th PART 4 was
bad?  How about Alien III?  Guess again sonny-boy, you just hadn't seen 
SCREAMERS yet.  How bad was it?  It was so bad, I laughed.  As a comedy, 
it might have worked.  As a suspenseful sci-fi flick, it stank to the 
rafters.  (-3 on +4/-4 scale).</P>
<P>There's a decent idea buried somewhere in this movie, but it is so obscured
with a laughably predictable plot, poor mattes, and dubious effects that
the end result is a boring movie without even a decent amount of shock
value.  Despite the theatre having the volume cranked to painful levels
(especailly considereding the high pitched "scream" from the title) I found
myself yawning.</P>
<P>Within the first five minutes of the movie anyone with a still connected
frontal cortex will have the entire movie mapped out.  There is no sin
worse in a suspense movie than to be so predictable.</P>
<P>Perfectly good opportunities to build supsense are wasted.  Chances to
build the characters from something more than their cartoonish charicatures
are squandered.  In short, the movie is a waste of time.</P>
<P>How bad was it, really?  It was a little worse than DUMB AND DUMBER.</P>
