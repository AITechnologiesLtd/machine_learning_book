RATING: 7.5/10 --> Very good movie</PRE>

<P>PLOT:
A stuck-up emperor with an evil advisor gets turned into a lama after some
of his selfish behavior gets out of hand. Stuck in the middle of the jungle,
the great leader must ask for assistance from a lowly peasant. The duo
attempt to get back to the palace, so that the emperor could be returned to
his former self.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Not as ambitious as many of Disney's other animation flicks, but definitely
one of its funniest. It's not the animation that will blow anyone away with
this movie, it's actually very basic, and it's not the music or the score,
both of which are also very standard. It's the four lead characters that are
a blast and despite a ho-hum story, the charm and humor built into these
characters, draws you in and allows you to have a mucho good time! First
there's David Spade, perfectly cast as the sarcastic emperor with an
attitude to kill. No doubt that Spade used some of his own improvisational
skills to make this character even more cold-hearted (Bu-bye!). The
commoner, voiced by John Goodman, a great ying to Spade's yang. A nice guy
with a cute family to whom anyone should be able to relate. Not an
over-the-top character, but one with enough morals to balance the lack
thereof in Spade's emperor. A great straight man. There's also the evil
Yzma, who actually plays out a complete person, with humor, thoughtfulness
and more than the usual one dimension. And the best surprise of all, and
easily the second funniest character after the lead, Kronk, the dumb-guy
side-kick, who looks exactly like Bruce Campbell from the EVIL DEAD movies,
and delivers many of the film's most uproarious lines. I just couldn't help
but laugh at everything that this guy did and said. They could make a movie
out of this guy alone!</P>
<P>The film also includes plenty of pratfalls for the kids (a la Road Runner),
sarcastic adult remarks for the parents joining the young ones in the
theatres and no musical interludes at any point...yes, that's right, no one
breaks out into a Broadway tune every five minutes. There's also a
self-referential narration by the lead character that works and is original.
Very unexpected to see a Disney film being stopped halfway by a character
wanting to make a point about something. Funny shtuff. The film doesn't have
any major action scenes either, but the last twenty minutes should give
everyone a hoot and a holler to take home. And it's like I said earlier,
very little ambition in this movie. The story is a very simple one, the
emperor gets turned into a lama and he now wants to get back to the palace
to return to his old self, end of story. But every other line in the film is
laced with sarcasm or dry wit and I just love that kind of humor. This film
may definitely not be for everyone, much like Spade's own humor, but I
certainly thought it was worthy of its quick 75 minute runtime. Go with the
kids, I doubt that you'll regret it. Not a classic, not a keeper but
definitely a very funny movie with great new characters. The title still
stinks though.</P>
