<P>   Hardly anyone stops at the Bates Motel any more.  It's off
the main road and may get an occasional customer for its 12
cabins and 12 showers if a motorist gets caught in a blinding
storm.  Even if a couple of travelers did check in and a)
Norman was not particularly attracted to them, b) they didn't
bother to take a shower...what would they do with their time? 
Would they bother looking at the town, talking to the people,
seeing what small attraction existed therein?  Not at all likely.</P>
<P>   In "Desert Blue," by contrast, two people motoring across
the California desert do stop off, not because they're stuck in
a storm or are experiencing motor trouble.  They get out in
Baxter, California (population 89) because that's the driver's
destination.  His name is Lance (John Heard), he's a
professor of popular culture now writing a book about small
town Americana, and seeks out the hamlet to examine the
tallest ice cream cone in the country.  What's a story without
a conflict, though?  No problem.  His daughter Skye (Kate
Hudson), whom he has dragged along with him, does not
share her dad's feelings for civic areas smaller and less hip
than L.A. or San Francisco.  Skye is the star performer of a
cable TV show, well known in her urban circles but quite
without fame in a town lacking a single cable station.  "Desert
Blue" deals with the pleasures she beholds well beyond any
she could have imagined.  She connects with the teens who
make this their home and who, contrary to the popular
stereotypes, have no great desire to seek the alleged big
pleasures of a metropolitan expanse.</P>
<P>   Morgan J. Freeman, who wrote and directed this charming
tale, keeps the pace nice and leisurely, the better to have us
accept the conversion which the budding actress undergoes. 
Shades balanced precariously on the bridge of her nose and
cell phone in hand, she easily passes muster as the
prototype of young stardom while at the same time earning
the contempt of the local teens, who include Blue (Brendan
Sexton III), his best friend Cale (Ethan Suplee), Cale's girl
friend Haley (Isidra Vega) All Terrain Vehicle champion Pete
(Casey Affleck), and Pete's spunky girl friend Ely (Christina
Ricci).  When a truck carrying a secret ingredient for a cola
drink explodes, some of its contents spilling over its driver,
the incident is about to be written off as a simple vehicular
accident.  When the driver mysteriously dies, the town is
quarantined by the FBI, forcing the urbane Skye to mix with
the unworldly townies.  </P>
<P>   In the typical story, the locals would be fascinated by the
star in their presence.  In Mr. Freeman's hands, however,
conventional expectations are reversed as Skye learns that
each of the seemingly faceless young people has tale to
unfold, some aspirations to satisfy.  Sexton III, known to his
core audience of teens and twenty-somethings as a decent
kid surrounded by petty thieves in Freeman's "Hurricane
Streets" and as a puckish adolescent in Todd Solondz's
"Welcome to the Dollhouse," does a particularly fine job.  As
a mature 19-year-old who adores his recently departed father
he is trying to fulfill his dad's dreams of turning the desert
sand into an ocean park which would attract a large tourist
clientele.  That this small-town lad captures the affections of
a big-city TV star is made believable by Sexton, whose
gentle, natural ways and caring demeanor give the spoiled
and cynical Skye a new way of looking at life and a few days
of pure fun in a place she least expected to find any.  </P>
<P>   The audience for this film cannot help being pulled in by
the simple pleasures of the kids: fun fights between a team
throwing oranges at another group firing potatoes out of a
cannon; the disaffected Ely's getting her kicks from
dynamiting canoes--who ultimately does bring water to a
parched wasteland and whose idea of what to do if this were
her last day on earth is to blow herself up together with her
parents.  The romantic interludes enjoyed by the kids are
dittoed by Skye's father and Blue's mom, Caroline (Lucinda
Jenney) who enjoy lively discussions in Caroline's coffee
shop while FBI Agent Bellows (Michael Ironside) is getting
drunk while guarding the road to the quarantined town.</P>
