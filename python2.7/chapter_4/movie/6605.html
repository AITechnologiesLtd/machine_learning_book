<P>Montreal 1996
The recently concluded Montreal World Film Festival is one of the better
known venues of the cinema world. It attempts to promote a wide range of
filmmakers from many countries by requiring as little as possible in
promotion expenditures. This year the Festival organizers paid special
attention to current Russian films and even gave a special prize in the
category of the Russian Cinema of Today. This writer was able to view a
number of the more significant films presented at the Festival. Preceding
my impressions I have included the official descriptions provided by the
Festival organizers.</P>

<P>A modern romantic melodrama filled with mad passions and the vagaries of
fate. Although the film is inspired by the stories of Anton Chekhov it is
by no means any sort of "adaptation". The film's action takes place today
and offers an ironic comment on the selfishness and intolerance of
contemporary society.</P>

<P>The name of this movie is taken from a well known song by Vladimir Vysotsky
in which the balladeer sings of the inexorable fate and the nearness of
doom. This is a story of a young post-Soviet rascal. A Russian patriot of
the fascist type, Ivan did not quite succeed in catching the gravy train, a
seat on which his father's high post in Soviet society should have assured
him.  Now, he is studying to be a lawyer, using his healthy good looks to
win beautiful women, earning his diploma not through diligent study of the
quickly changing laws but by performing stud services for an ugly female
professor in return for course notes and examination help. He sees the
beautiful Nina (Agnieszka Wagner) driving in her husband's foreign car from
the airport, is smitten by LOVE (lust, we and his closest friend, biologist
Eisler, think), and follows her, cynically noting to his friend that he can
seduce any wife right in front of her husband.
   The story now gets interesting. We are given an insight into the
mentality of a new type of "interdevochka", one who is kept not by a
foreign but by the new Russian businessman, and who consoles herself with
artistic and literary pursuits. These literary ideals take over her
imagination. Although attracted to Ivan by his animal magnetism, Nina
(Wagner) must justify to herself her betrayal of her husband by sacrificing
herself on the altar of love. She admits the affair to her businessman
husband (after he discovers her liaison), and leaves him to give herself to
Ivan.
   Ivan does not want her at first: he is busy with exams, he has his stud
duties with the woman lawyer, etc. But Nina's dowry of a brand new Opel
limousine, generously given to her by her former husband, win the day for
true "love" Moscow style. She divorces the businessman and the young couple
marry.
   The story develops some months later in the Crimea where the young
couple have moved after Ivan received his law diploma.  Nina has made more
sacrifices: she underwent a post-term abortion at Ivan's demand, and the
abortion left her physically ill and morally anguished; her career in
literature is going nowhere, Ivan has no interest in or knowledge of
poetry, and has even lost his sexual interest in her. Yet she clings to
Ivan all the more, despite his lies, drunkenness and recent sexual
frigidity.
   The glimpses of social and economic conflicts in the Crimea were of
particular interest to me. The director showed us the antagonism between
the emerging capitalist farmers and the feudal regime of the old collective
farm. We are also given a hint of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the
peninsula in that the police prefer to be bribed with Russian rubles rather
than the worthless Ukrainian karbovantsy. Of course, the US dollar is much
preferred by everyone.
   The story reaches its dramatic peak with a duel between the honest and
high-minded Eisler and Ivan, with Eisler defending Nina's honor against
Ivan's boorish drunkenness, selfishness and lies. A minor wound received by
Ivan and Nina's continuing selfless devotion to him shock this scoundrel
away from the precipice into which the fate was driving him.
   The director introduced this film before the screening and explained to
the audience that he wanted to reaffirm the timeless human values and to
show "the path of a repenting sinner back to God". In the movie we are
indeed offered numerous views of an Orthodox church atop a hill. It is
unclear, however, in what way this God affected the agnostic cynic Ivan, or
the self abusive Nina, or the atheist Eisler.
