<P>PLOT:
A certain Mr.Ripley is hired by a worried American father to go to Italy and
convince his rich, spoiled, playboy son to return to the States. Once Ripley
meets up with the man and his fiance, he finds himself strangely attracted
to the man, his better-half and their lifestyle. It isn't long before Ripley
yearns to take on a bigger part of the rich boy's life, and soon finds
himself doing almost anything to achieve that very goal.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Once more, this film falls into the early-winter Oscar movie trend of
running waaaaaay too long for its own good. This is a good film with fine
performances, solid direction, picturesque views and an interesting premise,
which essentially gets diluted in a script which focuses a little too much
on the "lives of the rich and famous" and not enough on the tightness of the
story, which could easily have afforded us more thrills, tension and
intrigue. I also thought that the homosexual under/overtones of the film
were too obvious and distracting on the whole, without the proper resolution
to justify all of its ambiguous references. Did it really matter what his
sexuality was? Why not focus more on the loneliness of the character?
Anyway, I guess this criticism is more of a personal quip. The director
might've felt as though this ambiguity was integral to the character. I
didn't and found it generally intrusive. On the whole, the film actually
felt like three hours, but it turns out that it was only about two hours and
twenty minutes, so I guess it did lag somewhat. The performances were all
pretty good with Law and Damon kicking the most ass. Damon was particularly
effective as the man with the "talent" to fool all others, and this despite
the fact that I didn't truly perceive his character to be as "talented" as
he was just plain lucky! Either way, Damon was solid in the role.</P>
<P>Overall, this film is intriguing enough to sit through, but difficult to
fully recommend because of its slow pace and lack of real tension. Some
people are comparing this to Hitchcock's films, but I doubt any of his films
lagged this much. I don't mean to harp on this length thing, but as
superficial as it may seem, not many people have the patience to sit still
for long periods of time, simply to gaze at beautiful Italian sceneries
going by from time to time. More meat is what this story needed, and a
stronger emotional pull from its lead character, who did generate some spark
of menace and vulnerability, but ultimately seemed to get lucky most of the
time, or be at the right place at the right time. If anything, I would
recommend you catch this movie on video so that you could be your own judge
and see if this story truly "works" for you. I dug the cinematography, the
actors and the direction on the whole, but found the story to be less
realistic than I would have liked and unreasonably long for my taste. Love
it or hate it, I think we could all agree on one thing: Jude Law is one
great looking man! Oh yeah, this film also has a dubious ending which may
leave many unsatisfied, but despite my own initial disappointment, I liked
it after all.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Matt Damon's first role was a one-liner in 1988's MYSTIC PIZZA. I guess Matt
really got affected by his role in ROUNDERS (7/10), a role for which he
reportedly received $600,000, since he apparently played in the $10,000
buy-in Texas Hold 'Em tournament at the 1998 World Series of Poker
(<A HREF="http://www.wsop.com">http://www.wsop.com</A>) in Las Vegas. He lost during the first day of four. He
apparently turned down a role in Ang Lee's film RIDE WITH THE DEVIL in order
to shoot this one with Anthony Minghella.
Jude Law's "breakthrough role" came in 1997's GATTACA. He also starred in
David Cronenberg's eXistenZ (7.5/10). He was born in 1972 in London,
England.
Gwyneth Paltrow apparently turned down the role of Emma Peel in THE AVENGERS
(7/10).
Phillip Seymour Hoffman has been in three films which have been released
over the last three months of 1999: TALENTED MR.RIPLEY, FLAWLESS and
MAGNOLIA.
The second movie that director Anthony Minghella ever directed was 1993's
MR. WONDERFUL starring Matt Dillon and Annabella Sciorra. His next, was the
1996 Oscar-winning film THE ENGLISH PATIENT.
There was an earlier interpretation of this book which was filmed in 1960
called PURPLE NOON (It's a French film called PLEIN SOLEIL). The Minghella
version was originally titled THE STRANGE MR. RIPLEY.
Jack Davenport, who plays the gay character of Peter in this film, got his
first break after he wrote to John Cleese and asked to be a runner in the
movie FIERCE CREATURES. He ended up playing a zookeeper. He is the son of
actor Nigel Davenport and actress Maria Aitken.</P>
