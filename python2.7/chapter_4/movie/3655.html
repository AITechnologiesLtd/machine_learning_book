<PRE>                          DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<PRE>     DIE HARD.  This time, it's personal.</PRE>
<P>     To make the long and extremely silly plotline of DIE HARD WITH A
VENGEANCE short, it breaks down like this.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) is
back in New York City where he's separated from his wife.  The brother of
Hans Gruber, from the original DIE HARD, is out to get McClane and make
some cash for himself in the process, bringing a pack of East German
stooges with him to cause trouble.  Add to this the character Zeus (Samuel
L. Jackson), a Harlem shop owner, who becomes McClane's unlikely sidekick,
and a whole lotta bombs exploding all over the city, and what do you get?
Well, I still haven't figured that out.</P>
<P>     I was a big fan of the original DIE HARD and had high expectations for
this third entry into the series.  Unfortunately, the only real similarity
to the former (besides the main character and a bunch of explosions) are
the jokes, which the creators felt were so good the first time around that
they'd go ahead and use them again.  Even worse, they borrow material from
PULP FICTION when the original jokes have run out.  I guess it was supposed
to be clever, but it reeks of unoriginality.</P>
<P>     The point of an action thriller like this is that it's supposed to be
exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat.  DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE
does neither.  Most of the time it's boring because the story is almost
pure nonsense.  Seriously, is no one going to catch on that Jeremy Irons
(as Simon Gruber) and his thugs are *not* from around here?  And what's
with Simon's fetish for ancient brain teasers to keep McClane running
around, searching for bombs?  Unfortunately, I don't have the answers to
these questions, and the bottom line is that the plot just doesn't gel.
Wait until you see how ridiculous it is when they find the bad guys'
hideout at the end.</P>
<P>     Not to be completely scathing, there are a few good points.  Jackson
is excellent in his role, and he is solely responsible for redeeming this
film from the one-star basement.  (Surprisingly, every other character is
completely one-dimensional, and even Willis looks tired.)  Oh, and the
explosions are pretty cool.  The time goes by fairly quickly, so you never
feel stuck in one of those endless movies, but all in all, by the time you
leave, you certainly won't be screaming for DIE HARDER WITH A VENGEANCE.</P>
