   Films and plays that treat murder in comic ways are
abundant, a leading example being "Arsenic and Old Lace," in
which a couple of dotty old ladies poison lonely widowers to
put them out of their misery.  "Deep Crimson," a tortilla-y-
frijoles remake of the 1970 cult movie "Honeymoon Killers,"
uses takes a true series of events which occurred in the
1940s and injects an almost surreal take.  The picture, which
is called an example of the genre "mad-love," makes
cartoon figures out of two petty creatures living seedy lives in
Mexico and shows how their merger in mayhem melds them
into blood siblings.  What a duo!  Coral Fabre (Regina
Orozco) is obese and just not-all-there, while the man she
adores, Nicolas Estrella (Daniel Gimenez Cacho) is
handsome enough when he wears his hairpiece, generally
bemused, and ultimately surprised by the depth of his feeling
for the repulsive Coral.
   The story begins by showing just how randy and forlorn
Ms. Fabre must be.  A nurse in a seedy institution, she makes
advances on an 80-year-old, wheelchair-bound man. 
Reading the personals column she discovers an ad that
describes the guy of her dreams: a Spaniard who comes
across as a true gentleman.  When he quickly departs after
meeting her complaining of a migraine headache, we assume
the pain is a ruse to get away from this humongous creature
(played by Shirley Stoler in the 1970 American version).  But
he returns and during their courtship she rifles through his
papers and discovers his plan to extort money from the
widows he charms.  She is pleased.  Teaming up, Coral and
Nicolas set their sights on other women whose loneliness
makes them as desolate and dried-up as the backwater
surroundings. 
   Director Arturo Ripstein lingers over each operation of this
larcenous duo as they take care of a fidgety woman who
claims she is imprisoned by her gypsy husband; a fanatically
religious widow who is warned by her cynical, atheistic
neighbor that her new love interest is a fraud, and a young,
businesslike woman who seems to need only another
mechanic to help run her repair shop and to keep the eyes
and hands of the local machos away.
   "Deep Crimson," which also has the Spanish name
"Profundo carmesi," takes its title from Coral's favorite color,
one which matches the blood which gushes from their victims
whose lives are snuffed out not so much for their money but
because of Coral's envy.  Unable to tolerate the
attentions which her man is giving to the victims, she turns
her own madness into serial killing and her beau into an
accomplice.  Hers is the sort of passion which knows no
boundaries: she has even given up the two children she loves
to satisfy the whims of her sleazy partner in crime.
   Hairpieces have always been the subject of jokes. In "Deep
Crimson," much is made of the value which Nicolas places on
his rug--justifiably, though, since he is a great deal more
handsome while wearing it. Ripstein unfolds Paz Alicia
Garciadiego's screenplay in a straight, narrative style, drawing
us into the activities by cleverly alternating the comic with the
disturbing.  While Coral's plight calls out for some sympathy
from the audience, her loathsome obesity prevents us from
commiseration.  Not so Nicolas, who, despite his history of
embezzlement, is a nice-looking soul who believes he is
earning the money he misappropriates by providing his lonely
women with the solace and company of a handsome escort.
   "Deep Crimson" is played less tongue-in-cheek than its
predecessor, "The Honeymoon Killers," and so could hardly
be a candidate for cult status.  It is well acted by an ensemble
cast particularly Marisa Paredes as the ultra-religious Irene
Gallardo and Patricia Reyes Espindola as the Widow Ruelas. 
Watch for the scene in which Coral, who has had some
experience with embalming, props up one of her victims in a
chair "until rigor mortis sets in.  Not Rated.  Running Time:
114 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey Karten</P>
