<PRE>                             TO THE STARRY ISLAND
                             (GESOM E KAKO SHIPTA)
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     TO THE STARRY ISLAND is as much an exercise in visual poetry as it 
is a thinking person's thriller.  Produced in Korea, a country not known 
in the non-Asian world for its filmmaking, this motion picture shows the 
kind of cinematic gems that can be found in unexpected places.  It's 
unfortunate that it takes film festivals to unearth this sort of motion 
picture;  TO THE STARRY ISLAND is certainly good enough to be snapped up 
by a major distributor (although it's doubtful it will be). </P>
<P>     The film opens in modern times, with Chai-Koo returning to Kwisong 
Island with the body of his father, Moon Pok-Bae, who had requested to 
be buried there.  Also in the funeral entourage is Chul Kim, a respected 
poet who is the son of the island's once-revered teacher.  All does not 
go well with the burial, however.  The inhabitants of the island will 
not let Chai-Koo bring the body ashore, citing the past sins of Moon 
Pok-Bae which resulted in many deaths forty years ago.  Thus begins an 
examination, told in flashback from Chul Kim's point-of-view, of actions 
and consequences set against the backdrop of the Korean war. </P>
<P>     Much of TO THE STARRY ISLAND is devoted to the exploration of what 
everyday life was like before the pivotal event which caused Moon Pok-
Bae's ostracism.  We meet about a dozen Kwisong villagers, and gain 
insight into how they live and why they live that way.  Director Park 
Kwang-su gives us a balanced perspective of these people that adds to 
the ultimate impact of a startling, gut-wrenching climax.   </P>
<P>     Many motion pictures have dealt with the effects of war on the 
personality of a man, and the kinds of wounds that wartime choices can 
cause.  Kwang-su is saying that although forty years have passed, not 
all of Korea's battle scars are healed.  Some hurts endure through time, 
and there is no atonement, even in death, regardless of how little 
responsibility the supposed villain actually bears.  TO THE STARRY 
ISLAND is a lyrical, compelling motion picture that draws the viewer 
into its world of unique characters, then brings back the grimness of 
reality with a jolt.  The themes it touches in doing so provide fodder 
for thought and discussion, and have meaning far beyond a single war in 
a small Asian country. </P>
