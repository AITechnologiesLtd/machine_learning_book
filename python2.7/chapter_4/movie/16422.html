<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>She's the One, a movie about love, marriage, divorce, sex, and cheating.
This bizarre love triangle (more like two triangles), centers around the
Fredricksons, a family played by John Mahoney (Frasier), Mike McGlone, and
Writer/Producer/Director Edward Burns (The Brothers McMullen), who are on
some of the worst and some of the best terms that I've ever seen in a movie,
talking about sex almost every day on a fishing boat called "The Fighting
Fredrickson's".</P>
<P>At the beginning of the movie, one of the brothers who plays a cab driver
gets married to someone after only spending 24 hours with her he goes back
to tell his brother and his wife (Jennifer Aniston), who absolutely never
have sex because, although Aniston doesn't know it, her husband Francis is
cheating on her to his brother's ex-hooker ex-fiancée Heather (Cameron
Diaz).</P>
<P>The story gets even more compacted and bizarre as his brother picks up
Heather for a cab ride and ends up taking back the TV he had left at her
apartment when he found her cheating on him. He returns home and begins
having trouble with his wife Hope when he tells her about where and how he
got the TV. She eventually tells him that she probably will go to Paris to
get her pH.D., making matters between them worse.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Fancis' wife begins to suspect something, and through methods
that I can't mention, discovers about Heather, and a divorce results.</P>
<P>>From there in things go to hell in a handbasket with the brothers being
further split apart and Francis proposing to Heather, and from then in,
well, you'll have to watch the movie yourself.
Now what you should ponder is the possibilities presented in the movie :
Love in first sight, adultery, and honesty to your lover / spouse. The fact
that all of this happens in one movie is something of an oddity, and one of
the things that detracts from the plot is the fact that all of this does
occur, and thus making it an almost inconceivable movie, as funny and
well-plotted as it would be.</P>
<P>There are three sets of shoes you should put yourself in while watching or
after watching this movie : One, if you loved someone upon seeing them,
would you continue to love them and be completely honest with them through
their relationship, and be willing to sacrifice your life as you know for
them. Two, would you feel guilty about cheating on your wife, and, if so,
would you continue to have sex with her should you think that you're in love
with the person your cheating on. Three, would you be completely honest with
your spouse or lover about your past.</P>
<PRE>To each of these I offer an answer.</PRE>
<P>First, I would try my best, but I would want to know more about her before I
would give up my life as I know it.</P>
<P>Second, I cannot and will not be sure until, if the event occurs, it
happens.</P>
<P>Third, there are some things people should not know about each other, but
its best to diffuse a bomb before it blows up.</P>
