<PRE>                         MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 4.5 and $1.00
Teaser: This guy and this girl are in love but so is this other girl.  Or
something.</PRE>
<P>    Never before have I seen stereotypes so perfectly played as in this
horridly worthless drivel of a film.  I bet you can see where this review
is going.</P>
<P>    You've got the naive girl falling in love with the handsome,
dominating man.  But look out, the chicken "friend" who wouldn't fess up
to being in love with the hunky stud for years is out to get him!  And, of
course, she's an independent and lonely career woman.  But who's the
chicken's *real* friend?  A studly and witty gay man, of course!  But she
feels no attraction to him at all, because...  he's gay!  How convenient! 
And everyone has perfect teeth and perfect hair, even when bolted out of a
sound sleep.  Ladies and gentlemen, the stereotypes of yuppiedom!</P>
<P>    Frankly, I didn't care WHO ended up with the guy in the end.  I kept
hoping that meteorites would fall from the sky and squash and smolder each
of them individually.  Except maybe Cameron Diaz's character; I kept
hoping she'd find a man as equally naive and blindingly faithful as her,
and that they'd run off into another movie together.  Maybe I'd actually
watch that movie and enjoy it for its honest romance.  The only thing that
kept me watching this one for the second agonizing half was the cat
sleeping on my chest, firmly pinning me down out of reach of my VCR.</P>
<P>    The only reasons this movie would be worth seeing at all are for the
stereotypically funny gay man (played by Rupert Everett), Cameron Diaz's
incredible smile, and M. Emmet Walsh (the proctologist from _Fletch_) as
the singing, dancing, pigging out Uncle Joe.</P>
<P><HR>My #1 rule in reviewing is: NO SPOILERS.  Instead of discussing the
plot, I choose instead to discuss performances, believability,
entertainment value, etc.  If you want the plot, see the movie.</P>
<P>I give two ratings: An arbitrary scale of enjoyability (1 to 10) and
a maximum price I would pay to see the movie.<HR></P>
