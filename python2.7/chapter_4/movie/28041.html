<PRE>"Enemy at the Gates" -- Ambitious Scope, Fuzzy Focus
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>Originally, this film about a legendary showdown
between two snipers during a pivotal WWII event was
going to be released in the late 2000 movie season,
with the hope that it would capture the attention of
Oscar voters.  Luckily, the studio decided to nix that
idea.  It would have been bombed had it gone up
against such late-year gems as "Thirteen Days" or
"Crouching Tiger."  However, against the current
dearth of good films, "Enemy at the Gates" may emerge
with only a flesh wound.</P>
<P>That's not to say that this is a good film.  It's
quite mediocre and frequently dull.  The only 'award'
that this film deserves is the 'most awkward and
laughable sex scene.'   In a bunker while resting
between battles, our hero and heroine share a romantic
moment.  But they're covered with grime while dozens
of snoring soldiers lie next to them like sardines. 
Who wants to watch that?</P>
<P>Set during 1941, the brutal Nazi juggernaut was
swiftly advancing towards Moscow.  A key offensive in
the city of Stalingrad would help to determine the
fate of this country.  Morale among the Russian troops
was waning.  To reinvigorate their forces, propaganda
officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) thinks that writing
about Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) would provide that
needed boost.  He's someone with whom most Russians
could relate.  He comes from a poor family, lived his
young life as a shepherd boy, and loves his
motherland.  Moreover, he's a gifted marksman. 
Danilov's stories resonate among the soldiers while
Zaitsev continues to record more and more kills.</P>
<P>The Nazi's take notice and send Major Konig (Ed
Harris), a decorated sharpshooter, to track down and
kill Zaitsev.  Our hero is earnest, humble, and
struggles with his daily survival.  Meanwhile, Konig
is a cunning tactician.  This encounter should be one
of the most suspenseful components of the film.  But
there's little interaction between the two, diffusing
much of the tension.  Instead of hunting each other
down, they prefer to hide and await a clear shot. 
There is only one exciting sequence where they square
off in a factory.  But most of the time, it's either
Zaitsev or Konig looking for each other through the
scopes of their guns amidst grim battlefields of
fallen warriors or the bombed out remnants of war-torn
buildings.  Konig is sadly underdeveloped, and the
role is essentially wasted on the gifted Harris (who
is a Best Actor contender at this year's Oscars). 
This chess match promised more than it could deliver.</P>
<P>More interesting was that Zaitsev was not just waging
a military battle but a personal one as well.  He is
ill-equipped to handle the weight of his expectations.
 Meanwhile, with Konig looking for him, he jeopardizes
the lives of his comrades.  Some, including another
sniper that tries to set a trap for Konig and a very
young boy who gets to know both snipers, are
memorable.  They both want to help but can't fully
appreciate the looming dangers.  However, his romantic
interest for a fellow female soldier (Rachel Weisz)
was distracting at best.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, it's a film that's epic in thought but
somewhat ignoble in deed.  The battle sequences were
somewhat murky and confusing, the romantic subplot was
needless, and the cat-and-mouse chase between the two
snipers lacked zip.  War, sometimes, is truly Hell.</P>
