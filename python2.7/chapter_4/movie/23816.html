<PRE>KEEPING THE FAITH</PRE>
<P> Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 Touchstone Pictures/Spyglass Entertainments
 Director: Edward Norton
 Writer:  Stuart Blumberg
 Cast: Ben Stiller, Edward Norton, Jenna Elfman, Anne
Bancroft, Eli Wallach, Ron Rifkin</P>
<P>   The title character in Jeremy Pikser and Warren
Beatty's rollicking and prescient movie "Bulworth" believes
that we can solve the problem of racial tensions in America if
everyone would "mix it up" on the marriage bed (he put it in a
more vulgar and more effective way).  The folks who made
"Keeping the Faith" have a similar vision.  Although less
radical than Beatty in "Bulworth," "Keeping the Faith" director
Edward Norton forwards the agenda that superficial
differences among people be discarded like so much
confetti--littering the landscape today, gone tomorrow. </P>
<P>In his amiable and consistently entertaining movie, the highly
diversified Mr. Norton--who is superlative in films as disparate
as "Fight Club," "Rounders," and "The People vs. Larry
Flynt"--now demonstrates his dexterity at the helm of a movie
that is as much a paean to harmony and happiness as
Woody Allen's "Everyone Says I Love You."  Filmed
appropriately in New York, this country's most diverse
metropolis, "Keeping the Faith" is about the friendship
between a priest and a rabbi that could make you
think of the long period of camaraderie between former New
York mayor Ed Koch and Cardinal O'Connor.  While Emanuel
Levy, writing for "Variety" magazine, calls this a date movie
for the 20 and 30 set, his view strikes discord with the
movie's own theme--that we should avoid labeling people
according to superficial attributes like race and religion and
presumably by age as well.  "Keeping the Faith" is a high-
spirited, feel-good film which avoids the sophomoric
predictability of more typically commercial feel-good fare such
as Adam Sandler's vehicle "The Waterboy."</P>
<P>   Recalling such films as James L. brooks's "Broadcast
News"--about a highly-charged woman who produces a TV
news program who is attracted to an anchorman quite
different from her in temperament--"Keeping the Faith" is a
buddy movie about a threesome who considered themselves
inseparable during their days in junior high school but whose
camaraderie ends when the female member splits for a
high-power job in San Francisco.  This leaves Jake (Ben
Stiller) and his pal Brian (Edward Norton) as a couple of guys
who continue their tight relationship--although
Jake becomes a rabbi and Brian a Catholic priest.   A visit to
New York by the third constituent, Anna (Jenna Elfman),
threatens not only the affinity of the two young men but the
foundation of Brian's very celibacy as a priest.  </P>
<P>   Written by Stuart Blumberg--who went to Yale with
Norton and whose friendship with him perhaps
parallels that between the movie's central characters--
"Keeping the Faith" is framed by a tale being told to a
bartender by an inebriated Father Brian Finn.  Brian goes
back to his days as a 12-year-old when he shares a happy
rapport with Anna and Jake.  The boys are heartbroken when
their pal moves cross country but perk up years later as Anna
calls Brian to tell him of her imminent trip to New York.  "Why
did she call you?" Jake wonders aloud, signalling to us the
envy might split their brotherhood.  As the three relate to one
another--Anna ultimately dating Jake while confessing her
innermost thoughts to Brian--we are treated to an often
hilarious, if familiar, series of takes involving pratfalls, verbal
wit, keen insights and moments of sweet tenderness.</P>
<P>   Those who follow movies centering on people of the Jewish
faith will be accustomed to the stock devices--the mother who
wonders when she will have grandchildren, the community
pushing daughters on their most eligible bachelor.  But given
the sometimes wide-eyed, sometimes rolling-eyed
expressions of Ben Stiller in Jake's role, we're treated to a
high level of entertainment that should be appreciated by
people of all denominations.  Though Stiller pretty much
carries the movie, we're cheered as well by Norton in the role
of the priest whose hormones are fighting with his sense of
duty and propriety.  Like Jake, Brian is a sympathetic figure,
one who resorts to popular tricks to build a congregation from
a trickle to a full house and whose comprehension of Spanish
affords him a good relationship with his mixed community.</P>
<P>   The casting of Jenna Elfman as the driven executive, so
addicted to connections that she has strapped a cell phone to
her thigh, is cogent. She is half a head taller
than Stiller but had been well-liked by the junior-high kids
because she was a tomboy--"one of them."  Side characters
are well-cast, including Eli Wallach as Jake's mentor and
especially Anne Bancroft as Jake's mom--a role that recalls
her performance in the upcoming movie by Philip Haas, "Up
at the Villa."  The movie has some vulgar excesses. Brian's
robes catch fire: he douses the flames by jumping into holy
water.  Jake faints at a bris.  An all-black gospel choir belts
out a stirring rendition of "Ain Kalohainu."  All of that comes
with the territory, and as sanctuaries for the faithful, the
church and the temple in "Keeping the Faith" are a hymn not
to separatism, but to glorious diversity.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 127 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
