A Review by Frankie Paiva</PRE>
<P>Japanese anime is a world of film that has been limited to obscure video store
shelves for far too long. The stunning detail that is in each cell of animation
cannot possibly be appreciated, or given the proper gratitude, by watching an
anime film on video. Recently, one of the first anime films to be released in a
while Perfect Blue was released into theaters. It did very good business and
opened the door right up for this animation classic. Princess Mononoke
(Mononoke Hime in Japan) was the biggest grossing animated film of all time in
Japan. Now with the help of English actors for the voices, it’s ready to set
sail across the ocean for the viewing pleasure of everyone who enjoys anime or
cinema in general. </P>
<P>Ashitaka is a warrior who has been put under a curse by the forest God. It
leaves an ugly looking purple gash on his arm that will continue to grow until
it envelops his entire body, and then it will kill him. The elderly woman of
the village says that if he goes to the forest of the forest Gods that he may
be able to have the curse lifted. So off he goes riding into the forest until
he reaches the pool of the forest God. Nearby there is a mining colony called
Irontown led by Lady Eboshi. She wants to hunt and kill the forest God because
all of the animals that she kills and all of the trees that she cuts down are
being re-planted by people of the forest. If she kills him, all forest Gods
will become mortal again and will be easily killed.</P>
<P>He also meets Princess Mononoke. She lives with an extremely large wolf pack
and is trying to save the forest. Her destiny is to kill Lady Eboshi to save
the forest and all of the animals living in it. A tribe of boars also enters
the picture when they decide to charge and kill Lady Eboshi and her men. </P>
<P>Princess Mononoke is worth seeing three or four times just to look at the
beautifully drawn animation. No detail was spared, in scenes where Ashitake
runs through the forest all of the shadows of the trees and branches are
perfectly laid out to where they would be in real life. The forest God is
quirky and cool looking and you don't even want to get me started about what it
looks like when people are engulfed with hate. The expressions on the
characters' faces make up for the usual lack of good dubbing. What a bad job it
is! Many people I talked to thought (and I agree with them) that while watching
the film, it’s painfully obvious which American celebrities are doing the
voices. Why not have Japanese people do the voices for the English version of
the film? It would sound a lot better and more authentic. While the storyline
sounds complicated, it’s not that hard to get. Besides, if you get lost there
is always the animation to look at. Mononoke has a great message, and the
premise of trying to balance nature with production to work together to form a
better economy is a great lesson. Especially for some construction workers who
treat trees as things that exist only for them to chop down. The ending is also
slightly confusing, but I won’t give anything else away. If you are fortunate
enough to have Princess Mononoke to be at a theater near you, go and see it. If
not, rent it on video and watch it on a really big screen. This animation
classic gets **** stars.</P>
<P>The Young-Uns: Several soldiers get either their arms or heads chopped off, but
it’s usually shown at a distance. (Remember this film is animated) there is
also some very scary looking boars and some mild language. Good Age 12 & Up</P>
