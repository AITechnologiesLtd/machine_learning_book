<P>`Bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror
movie fan. To pull something like this off, you need to have a sense of
wit and style, with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if
the fright factor ever declines. Something like the underground worm
thriller `Tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements, and
in return, the film was tremendous fun. With the notable exception of a
wisecracking supporting player, `Bats' mainly plays it's premise for
straight-arrow horror. Judging by the ridiculous premise, this was not
exactly a wise move.</P>
<P>The movie attempts to capture the essence of Alfred Hitchcock's `The
Birds', but fails miserably. Done right, it could have been adequately
amusing Halloween cinema. Unfortunately, `Bats' is a prime example of a
formula movie done terribly, terribly wrong. The only thing amusing
about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers
anticipate their core audience to be. I will recite the following
paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to
whom `Bats' is aimed toward.</P>
<P>Those guys in Hollywood have made a movie about bats. These bats are not
very nice, because they eat a lot of people. Boy, are these bats ugly.
They are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper
smart. They've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly
at all. A whole bunch of people in Texas get killed, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats. They have big guns
and other cool things to fight them with, but the bats are pretty smart,
so it's sorta hard to do. The bats swoop down and they shoot at them to
make they go away for good.</P>
<P>But no, `Bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers. The film,
directed by Louis Morneau, should have ventured straight into video
stores. On the small screen, perhaps more fun could have been derived
with lower expectations. But sitting through this crapper on the big
screen is almost awkward; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty
pleasure, the film is poorly written, poorly acted and executed with
glaring ineptitude. Even the bats themselves are cheesy, and the attack
sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed.</P>
<P>The sheriff in the story is Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), who
embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually
portrays (he chomps on a cigar, struts contentedly in his boots,
etc...). The scientist is Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer), who
specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her
field'. Meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie
seem more intellectually capable, but everything about Dr. Casper is
recycled beyond recognition. Her memories of how she became hooked on
the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like Oceanographic student Matt
Hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `Jaws'.
Everything revolving around `Bats' is tired drivel, which desperately
requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up.</P>
<P>The supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw, with
voices dubbed in later. In fact, that may have worked out better in the
end. Take one glance at Casper's bat-loathing sidekick Jimmy (Leon), and
you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy
caricature from every other movie, constructed specifically for timed
comic relief. Unfortunately, none of his comic interludes are funny. In
the role of deranged mad scientist Dr. McCabe, the reliable Bob Gunton
gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch.
McCabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects, and the
virus spread to other bats. The entire town of Gallup, Texas is under
attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures, but Gunton appears to be
inconspicuously contemplating something else. Something like: `When is
the damn movie going to be over?? I just want my money.'</P>
<P>The bats are ugly, I must say. There's the occasional moment where they
look moderately convincing, but mainly, the swarm is represented in
cheesy digital imagery. Only bits of the bloody action even hint at the
campy fun the film could have been, but by the absurdly stupid climax,
it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery. Characters
experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire. Let's explore the
logic there: is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat
population?? You could empty an entire clip at the flying winged
serpents and not even wound one, and after that there are only 18, 000
more of them. This kind of behavior represents the regular level of
intelligence behind `Bats'.</P>
