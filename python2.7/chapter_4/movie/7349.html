<PRE>On a scale of 0-10 - 5</PRE>
<P>    My memory must be getting worse, because I thought I recalled
someone's review of "Grosse Pointe Blank" made the movie sound
interesting.  It's not.  Seeing that the screeplay is credited to four
people, it is easy to understand why a Hollywood committee would write a
Hollywood movie. </P>
<P>   A large number of cliches have been whipped out to fill the hour and a
half or so going on to all day that this movie takes.  The trailers tip
you off to the premise:  a professional killer goes to his high school
reunion.  (It seems a good year for high school reunions - see Lisa Kudrow
of "Friends" is in another one opening soon). </P>
<P>   I find myself depressed by the assumption that the U.S.Government is in
the assassination business, and further depressed by the concept that
automatic weapons hardly ever kill anyone, no matter how close the range
or how many times they are fired.  I was not struck by the attraction
bwtween John Cusack and Minnie Driver, nor much impressed by the idea that
Minnie spent 10 years mourning John's inexplicable and unexplained
disappearance.  It would have been ok with me if he had stayed away. 
The dialog, if that is the correct term for the lines spoken by the
actors, is straight from the Hollywood book.</P>
