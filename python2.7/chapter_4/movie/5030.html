<P>     Pairing Shirley MacLaine and Ricki Lake is probably a violation of
the recent Telecommunications Decency Act-- coming soon: Former Lives of
Angst-Filled Psychic Teenagers!-- but since this isn't television, I
guess we don't have to worry.  The two star in MRS.  WINTERBOURNE, a
shallow fairy tale that's even *lighter* than such similar fluff as
PRETTY WOMAN and WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.  Based on Cornell Woolrich's
novel "I Married a Dead Man," the plot has a pregnant unwed mother
(Lake) mistaken as a rich man's widow after a train wreck kills both him
and his pregnant wife.  (She wakes up in the hospital, with everyone
calling her a different name.  Sound familiar?) What sounds like the
perfect (albeit grim) "Cinderella story" needs, well, a better actress
than Lake.  She's photogenic enough-- and, of a refreshingly "non-model"
type-- but she's too coarse.  Yeah, I know, her blunt approach fits the
character, but she's still taxing to an audience already contending with
logic leaps, telegraphed emotions, and a few too many happily-ever-
after's.  Directed by Richard Benjamin.  Need I say more?  </P>
