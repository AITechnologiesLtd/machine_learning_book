<P>A film review by Aileo Weinmann – Copyright Ó 2000 filmcritic.com</P>

<P>Cut, Curl, Crimp, Color.  THE BIG TEASE is a mockumentary tracing
flamboyant gay hairdresser Crawford Mackenzie's (Craig Ferguson – THE
DREW CAREY SHOW) unlikely journey from Scotland to Los Angeles in his
quest to win the World International Hairdressing Federation's (WIHF)
Platinum Scissors Competition.  The adventurous bumbling begins when
MacKenzie mistakes a form letter – asking him to be part of the audience
– for an invitation to compete against three of the world's top
stylists, including his idol and the reigning Platinum Scissors holder
Stig Ludwiggssen (David Rasche).</P>
<P>Accompanied by filmmaker Martin (Chris Langham – BBC's KISS ME KATE),
Mackenzie travels to LA, where he plans to finally claim the artistic
recognition and fame that his small Scotland hometown can't offer.
(Except for that time he got to dry Sean Connery's toupee after it fell
into some water on a golf course).  Upon arriving in California, he
kicks up his kilt and happily takes advantage of what he assumes are
complimentary hotel amenities, only to wake up to the reality of a maxed
out credit card.  His passport now held collateral on his outstanding
charges, he proceeds to WIHF headquarters, expecting to clear up the
confusion and get reimbursed.  Unfortunately, WIHF President Monique
(Mary McCormack) is not about to pick up the tab for Mackenzie's
misunderstanding, nor does she plan to allow him to enter the
competition.  Undaunted, the remainder of the comedy unfolds in his
search of any and every way to gain entry in the prestigious contest.
Antics include befriending celebrity promoter Candy Harper (Frances
Fisher), calling on Sean Connery (to return a favor), and visiting a
testosterone-oozing Senator whose company sponsors the WIHF event.</P>
<P>Ferguson plays the eccentric hairdresser with finesse – he's silly and
endearing in his portrayal of destiny to attain the coveted Platinum
Scissors.  Chris Langham does a fine job with his feeble character,
providing a constant if not invisible sidekick for Mackenzie.  Frances
Fisher is great in her role as Mackenzie's compassionate and determined
advocate, demonstrating her versatility, in contrast with more serious
roles in films like TITANIC, UNFORGIVEN, and TRUE CRIME.  Cameo
performances by Drew Carey, David Hasselhoff, Cathy Lee Crosby, and John
Paul DeJoria (a.k.a. John Paul Mitchell, stylist extraordinaire) are
sprinkled to provide that true Hollywood feel.</P>
<P>Overall, THE BIG TEASE holds no real surprises, but the culminating
scene is outrageously over-the-top and doesn't disappoint.  Although the
mockumentary format was strained and became somewhat annoying at times,
it's not enough to kill the general cuteness and entertainment of the
production.  Zany characters, bigtime costumes and an originally absurd
premise (a world championship of hairstyling ?!?) offer as many smiles
as I remember from spinning around in the chair at the barber shop.</P>
<PRE>*** 3 stars</PRE>
