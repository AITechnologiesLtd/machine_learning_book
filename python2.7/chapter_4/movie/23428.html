<P>Here is a thoroughly absorbing supernatural fairytale about good and evil 
living under the same roof. Decent men work with cruel ones in this movie, 
and a creature with miraculous healing power winds up in a place inextricably 
linked with death. Perhaps that's the most appropriate place to witness him.</P>
<P>The location is E-block in a 1935 Louisiana prison, where inmates await the 
electric chair, and the condemned man's 'last mile' has been nicknamed 'the 
green mile' after the lime-coloured linoleum on the floor. We meet some of 
the guards: Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean 
Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey Demunn), Percy Wetmore 
(Doug Hutchison).</P>
<P>All of these, except for the slimy Percy, who got his job because of a 
powerful relative, are good and patient men, who are firm yet kind to their 
prisoners. They view their role, correctly, as being a calming influence on 
inmates who would be dangerous if they got too nervy. "Think of this place as 
like an intensive care ward in a hospital," advises Paul.</P>
<P>One of the new guests is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gigantic 
black man who has been convicted of the rape-murders of two young girls, but 
seems to exude simplicity and goodness, and turns out to have a very special 
ability. Other odd plot points creep up and get a fair bit of attention, such 
as a urinary infection Paul suffers from, an unusually talented mouse, and a 
boorish prisoner named Wharton. We wonder what significance all these things 
could possibly have, and then finally they come together in a climax of 
moving drama, religious symbolism and clever epilogue.</P>
<P>My vague descriptions are intentional. "The Green Mile" does not announce 
what it is about, but drops little clues here and there, letting its story 
unfold carefully, intriguing and enveloping us with its atmosphere. That is 
why virtue and depravity are set at equal levels throughout the film; the 
conflict is needed to create quietly gripping tension. And it is exactly how 
the original Stephen King source material worked -- slyly revealing the story 
by taking things slowly, letting us settle in, earning our care.</P>
<P>King released "The Green Mile" as a novel in six parts, leaving intervals of 
several months between instalments, engaging his public in a guessing game 
about what direction the material would go in. Even if you read the whole 
series at once, as I did, you still felt led through it slowly, because the 
author's prose was so delicate and detailed. The film captures this 
remarkably well; Frank Darabont, the writer and director, who previously 
adapted a King work into the great "Shawshank Redemption", recognises 
deliberate pacing as an essential part of this story, and never falls into 
the trap of condensing it into a series of meaningless spooky events.</P>
<P>If only Darabont had bought the rights to Alex Garland's "The Beach", instead 
of that hyperactive boor Danny Boyle! The way he lets "The Green Mile" 
develop involves us with the intimacy of a good book. The film is three hours 
long, but contrary to the opinions of some critics, extensive length is not 
the film's problem, but its appeal. We get so immersed in the routine of life 
on the 'green mile' that when paranormal activity starts to happen, we accept 
it, and are amazed along with the characters. Audience members prepared to 
sit still and give the movie a chance will be handsomely rewarded.</P>
<P>Not that you'd think it from the ads. This week two brilliant new releases, 
"The Green Mile" and "Three Kings", have been so badly misrepresented by 
their television commercials that many cinema-goers will be persuaded to stay 
at home. Darabont's film has been portrayed as some sort of mawkish 
sentimental drama, with its scenes of good fable taken out of context, and 
made to look like bad attempts at realism. This is a movie that knows exactly 
what it's doing, and while it does have its fair share of tender moments, 
they're needed to balance out the brutality. One scene, for example, 
graphically depicts an execution Percy has rigged to go wrong, and is one of 
the most horrifying single moments ever shown on film -- my hand 
instinctively jumped to cover my eyes. I was able to remove it, and look on, 
but it really means something when a film can trigger involuntary defensive 
movements.</P>
