<PRE>`Blast' Delivers Low-Impact Fun
by Homer Yen
(c) 1999</PRE>
<P>If you meet Adam Webber (Brendan Frasier), you'll notice something
wonderfully appealing about him.   He's extremely well-mannered,
displays a generous amount of social grace and etiquette, exhibits
almost-forgotten codes of chivalrous conduct, and really knows how to
swing dance.  But you'll also notice something strangely odd about him
as well.  He's surprised to see black people (upon seeing one, he
exclaims, `oh my lucky starts – a Negro!').  He's not very familiar
with riding mass transit.  And when someone states that they are
‘gay', Adam thinks that they are just extremely happy.  Exhibiting a
Kennedy-era look and attitude, you might think that he was holed up
somewhere for the last 30 years.  Well, that's close.</P>
<P>"Blast from the Past" looks at the Webber family(Dad played by
Christopher Walken; Mom played by Sissy Spacek) who, thirtysome years
ago during the height of the cold war, retreated underground into
their elaborate fallout shelter believing that nuclear war was at
hand.  While underground, Adam was born, and he was raised in a vacuum
of time that featured stubby haircuts, endless Honeymooners reruns and
knowledge dispensed by his Dad that only went up to the mid-60s.  But
now, it is present day and any residual radiation from the nuclear
fallout should have dissipated.  And in a funny sequence, the father
takes a peek at the outside world for the first time in thirty years. 
He has no idea that what has sprung up is a crime- and litter
-infested neighborhood.  After running into a transvestite prostitute,
which he diagnosis as a mutant dual-sexual, he retreats back
underground.  But supplies are running low, and Adam will be needed to
go out and find more.  He's armed with cash, valuable baseball cards,
and stock certificates.  But on a more personal note, he hopes to meet
up with a girl that isn't a mutant and that doesn't glow in the dark.</P>
<P>During his supply run, he meets up with unlucky-in-love Eve (Alicia
Silverstone).  Adam definitely needs some help.  Not at all familiar
with today's society, he hires Eve to help him track down the lengthy
list of supplies as well as be his guide and to keep him out of
trouble.  But he has some girl hunting to do too.  Eve agrees to help
him, and the film focuses on more than a few cute moments where
yesteryear's Adam has to insert himself into the world of today.  Most
of this material will elicit a grin or two, which is mostly because of
Frasier's affability.  He's cute and has an infectious smile.  But
there are some scenes that are really funny such as when they go to a
club to meet girls (called Club 40s where the music is nothing but
swing).  Watch as Adam uses his innocence to meet two gorgeous and
talented dancers.  They trip the lights fantastic while shivers of
jealously begin to run up and down Eve's spine.  Of course, the two
will eventually fall in love (with the names Adam and Eve, how could
they not?), and it's just a matter of time as they both try to
understand each other's world.  It's the standard fish out of water
story with some silliness, sweetness and some clever bits of
originality mixed in.  I was surprised by how likeable this film was.</P>
