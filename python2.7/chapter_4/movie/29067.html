<PRE>The Score (2001)

<P>"Don't leave me on the sidelines when it comes time to
collect, don't do it!"</P>
<P>Starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando,
Angela Bassett. Directed by Frank Oz. Rated R.</P>
<P>Just a few weeks ago, I lamented that Swordfish didn't
have the humility to simply be a good heist movie. The
Score is like that film's twin, sans computers,
impromptu blow jobs and Travolta with a goatee. Only
this one is a good heist movie, flawed but thoroughly
competent, with an amazing cast and precise, almost
Mametian dialogue. Films like these are woefully hard
to find: though it has irony a-plenty, it doesn't have
any of the post-modern "edge" that audiences seem to
dig. The heist here seems to be just like any other.</P>
<P>...except that it's set in Montreal. Not just filmed
in Montreal, set in Montreal. And why not? It's such a
nice city that it's a shame to see it rampaged by
thieves, which is why the protagonist of The Score,
professional thief Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) has a
policy: never do jobs in your hometown. It never leads
to anything good. This is part of the reason for his
skepticism when his old friend Max (Marlon Brando)
approaches him with a proposition to rob the Montreal
Customs House; the other part is his girlfriend
(Angela Bassett), who has promised to move in with him
if he'll only retire.</P>
<P>After some prodding, of course, Nick agrees to One
Last Heist, which teams him with an intelligent and
ambitious budding criminal Jack (Edward Norton), who
has infiltrated the Customs House posing as a retarded
janitor. The target is a priceless scepter that was
once owned by a royal family and later intercepted by
customs when someone tried to hide it inside of a
piano leg. The security around it is tight but nothing
insurmountable, and Jack knows the building like the
back of his hand. But Nick, a seasoned veteran, likes
to work slowly and exclusively on his terms, making
Jack agree that what he says, goes.</P>
<P>Before the end credits roll, loyalties are tested, and
people are crossed, double-crossed and crossed again
(though I don't think anyone gets killed, which is
amazing for a modern actioner). The reason to watch
The Score, though, isn't the plot, which is about as
simple as it gets (thieves find target, thieves plan
heist, thieves pull heist), but the interplay between
the three actors at its forefront.</P>
<P>No actor radiates a fierce, dangerous intelligence as
well as Ed Norton, and this ability has landed him
some of the most enviably challenging roles Hollywood
had to offer. His Jack isn't as risque as the
"Narrator" in Fight Club, but his wavering
is-he-a-villain-or-isn't-he status gives Norton plenty
of opportunities to toy with the audience. More than
anything, it resembles his debut role in Primal Fear,
which also hid a smart, scheming criminal under the
guise of mental retardation.</P>
<P>The climax is a great payoff for what was a slow, if
interesting, first two acts, but I didn't much like
the ending, which is a little too pat and predictable
for my tastes. I don't want to give away too much, but
the final phone-conversation "shocker" isn't much of a
shocker at all. Still, I prefer The Score's
unpretentious conclusion to Swordfish's, which
apparently thought that if it confused us enough, we'd
praise it to pretend that we understood it. It's a
fitting end to a solid, unremarkable film. </P>
