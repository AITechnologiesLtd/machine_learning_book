<PRE>STEAL THIS MOVIE</PRE>
<PRE>directed by Robert Greenwald</PRE>
<PRE>(Lions Gate, 111 minutes)</PRE>
<P>Despite the best efforts of campaigns like Rock The
Vote, most of today's 18+ youth demographic choose not
to vote in presidential elections.  Who can blame
them?  Since the demise of the hippies in the 1970's,
anarchists have become less and less visible, and
youths are, for the most part, disillusioned from the
future of their country.  A film like Steal This
Movie, however, is inspirational enough to make youths
politically aware, proving that protest can be a means
to make change.</P>
<P>Steal This Movie retells the true story of Abbie
Hoffman (Vincent D'Onofrio), the outspoken anti-war
revolutionary who took to the streets and helped shape
the bustling American "make love not war"
counterculture of the late 1960's.  Hoffman had a true
passion for social justice.</P>
<P>We first meet Abbie in the late 1970's.  He has been
hiding (for reasons that are later disclosed) from the
government for many years, but is allowing a
journalist to interview him about his life as an
activist.  Through a series of flashbacks, a light is
shone on one of America's most outspoken historical
figures.</P>
<P>Steal This Movie focuses mainly on two aspects of
Hoffman's life.  The first is the infamous riot at the
Chicago Democratic Convention and the trial that
followed.  Hoffman was a member of the "Chicago 8",
along with men like Jerry Rubin (Kevin Corrigan) and
Tom Hayden (Troy Garity, Hayden's son).  Some have
referred to it as the true "trial of the century."</P>
<P>The film is also about Hoffman's relationship with his
wife, Anita (Janeane Garofalo), and the interesting
predicament they find themselves in when Abbie is
forced to go into hiding.  Anita stays unbelievably
faithful to her husband, even after he moves in with a
new girlfriend (Jeanne Tripplehorn).</P>
<P>In many ways, Steal This Movie is hampered by a low
budget.  In a few opening scenes, a boom mic is
clearly visible at the top of the screen, and often
the flashback scenes seem a bit awkward because of the
lack of period detail.  But the real Anita Hoffman
told director Robert Greenwald that a truthful film
about her husband couldn't be made under the studio
system, and after watching this compelling, inspiring
biopic, it's hard not to agree.</P>
<P>Steal This Movie is being released in Los Angeles a
day after the 2000 Democratic Convention.  This is
unfortunate, because, had the film been released a
couple weeks earlier, I think we'd see a few more
rebels eager to take to the streets and fight for a
cause. </P>
