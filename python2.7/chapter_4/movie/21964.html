<P>For the nineteenth entry in his forever cherished franchise, James Bond
has pulled nothing particularly special out of his hat. At first glimpse
of the dashing new Bond girls, the wildly implausible action sequences
and the nifty Bond gadgets, dedicated 007 fans may dismiss `The World is
Not Enough' as merely same old. Fortunately though, in terms of
boisterous rollicking action, you still know what name to turn to.</P>
<P>In his third outing as the suave and sophisticated superspy, Pierce
Brosnan appears to be even more lightweight and comfortable than
previously evident. Cool and refined, he portrays Bond more solidly and
compact than any actor since Sean Connery. In the opening sequence, Bond
pursues a female sniper in an exhilarating boat race that covers water
and (*ahem*) land. Later on, he evades parachuting villains on ski-doos
while skiing down a treacherous mountainside (`See you back at the
lodge' he quips, as an unfortunate attacker plummets off the side of the
mountain). The action sequences and set-pieces of `The World is Not
Enough' are loaded with top-drawer inventiveness, bursting with
merciless excitement at every turn.</P>
<P>It also must be noted that the film has some mediocre aspects. The plot
is lumpy and uneven and certain characters are put to perpetual waste.
The plot follows Bond as he travels to protect Elektra King (Sophie
Marceau), the daughter of a deceased billionaire who was invested in the
world oil business. Elektra is believed to be the next target of the
devious Russian terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle), who has a bullet
lodged in his medulla oblongata that renders him completely impervious
to pain. The bald-headed Renard was voted the #1 Bond villain in a
recent pole. But despite the initial possibilities of such a cool
physical attribute, director Michael Apted ignores the strengths of
Carlyle's considerable talent, presenting Renard as a bit of a wuss. I
was hoping for more, to say the least.</P>
<P>Returning characters add spice to this unspectacular entry. Academy
Award-winner Judi Dench returns as M, and once again she positively
showcases the character's authority. Robbie Coltrane reprises his role
from `Goldeneye', playing a plump turkey of a villain named Valentin
Zukovsky, who's so likable it's hard to classify him as a villain. On a
more dramatic note, the legendary weapons-maker Q (Desmond Llewelyn) is
retiring after appearing in (nearly) every Bond movie since 1963's `From
Russia With Love'. The good news: he is being replaced by John Cleese,
playing the younger protégé R (get it?). Cleese is a funny man, although
here he is given only a few precious moments of screen and one or two
good lines (one of them being when he describes the attachments on
Bond's new BMW, adding it contains `six beverage cup holders').</P>
<P>`The World is Not Enough' is strictly formula Bond, granted, it's a
formula that is still fun. One great scene has the spy evading a
helicopter wielding three oversized buzzsaws. And of course, Bond is
given his usual quota of witty punch lines, all of which Brosnan
delivers in perfectly straight-faced fashion. One involves a nuclear
physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who is apparently
only named Christmas Jones to aid in one hilarious bit of dialogue
during the film's closing moments. But Richards is one of the weak links
in this choppy adventure. I mean, she plays a nuclear physicist, for
cripes' sakes. Conveniently, she is the only scientist running around in
tight black shorts and an enticing green tanktop. While the actress (who
previously appeared in the risqué sex thriller `Wild Things') is
certainly fetching, perhaps her acting abilities aren't quite up to
snuff.</P>
<P>At one ludicrous point in the action, a younger viewer sitting behind me
had this sarcastic retort: `Yeah, right'. Boys and girls, Bond movies
are not about realistic action. They are unique thrill rides with daring
stunts and exhilarating chase scenes, often succeeding because they are
more wild and wacky than any other conventional action films. Stretching
the technological barrier, Bond has some nifty new gadgets here: x-ray
sunglasses, a credit card that transforms into a key... It's not to be
taken seriously, but it's fun.</P>
<P>Well, mainly. There is an element about these last two Bond entries (the
previous being `Tomorrow Never Dies') that drains certain excitement
from the premise. With this ingredient absent from the formula, `The
World is Not Enough' remains tasty, but ultimately it is lacking in a
few vital areas of humanity that were alive and evident in the classic
Connery films. For his next outing, James Bond could certainly use a
fresh canvas to explore something more different and exciting. `The
World is Not Enough' is entertaining, though, you've got to admit.</P>
<P>James Bond is certainly not dead. He simply needs some shock treatment.</P>
