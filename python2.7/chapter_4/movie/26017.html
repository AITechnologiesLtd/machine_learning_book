<P>Probably not the best title for a movie about the behind the scenes
shenanigans of a Hollywood picture filming in a small Vermont town, but with
gifted writer/director David Mamet at the helm, who am I to question
cinematic decisions? I was one of the lucky few to check out the premiere of
this film at the Montreal Film Festival and even got a picture with Mamet
himself (A gentleman who was nice enough to wait patiently as I fumbled
through my duffelbag looking for my camera...doh!). The only question that
remained to be answered was to which one of Mamet's previous comedies this
picture most related: would it be WAG THE DOG, the comedy hit or WE'RE NO
ANGELS, the comedy disaster. Let's find out...</P>
<P>PLOT:
A Hollywood production crew comes to a small town to film a movie starring a
very popular actor and a whining starlet. The process becomes more difficult
as the script constantly has to be re-written, the star has his eye on a
local teen girl and the starlet refuses to do the topless scene that she
agreed to do in her contract. It isn't long before the small town values
begin affecting some of its visitors and the Hollywood phoniness affects
everyone.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
I enjoy watching movies that deal with Hollywood and its behind the scenes
goings-on, and this one was no different. It certainly didn't blow me away
with any of its humor, but it was a nice, light comedy filled with several
interesting characters, a few really funny lines and an infectious
easy-going score. In fact, the clever lines alone were an easy step up from
any typical Hollywood tart romp, but on the whole, it still rode in a little
under my Mamet expectation meter. I had hoped for a lot more "bite"! The
film ran a little too long for its own good and spent too much time on a
relationship between a couple of the characters, who really weren't half as
funny or interesting as anyone else in the movie. For me, two of the
funniest personalities in the film were Alec Baldwin, who played the aloof,
conceited yet charming star to a tee (nice to have you back, Alec!), and
David Paymer, who must've channeled the spirit of Joel Silver for his role
as the arrogant, no holds barred producer. These two guys had some really
hilarious lines in the movie and obviously loved the roles that they were
playing.</P>
<P>I also liked the director in this movie inhabited perfectly by William H.
Macy and all of his backdoor phoniness, but I didn't think that there was
enough time spent with these three characters. Mamet decided to focus more
on the screenwriter and his dilemma in this story, and despite being a
writer myself, I didn't particularly care much for his predicament. The
greater point of the film was predictable early on, so I would have rather
they focused more on all of the characters, rather than just the one. But
that's honestly just a minor quirk in an overall decent film which should
definitely be seen by all who enjoy the behind the scenes game of Hollywood.
It reminded me a lot of MUMFORD and LIVING IN OBLIVION, with it being much
funnier than the former but not as funny as the latter. In the end, I don't
think this film is gonna blow anybody's socks off, but it certainly is a
nice change from all the poop-joke movies that've been shot our way of late.
It's small, it's cute, it's David Mamet-lite.</P>
