MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY
A film by Woody Allen
Starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Anjelica Huston, and =
Jerry Adler
Written by Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman</PRE>
<P>    One of the craziest movies ever filmed, Woody Allen's MANHATTAN 
MURDER MYSTERY is the director's response to the scandals that plagued 
him at the time of its release.  The film, which was shot while Allen 
was in his personal problems, is ironically enough one of the loosest, 
freshest, and looniest films Allen has ever made.  It is not an artistic 
triumph, or a groundbreaking effort by an accomplished director.  It 
isn't even a heavily decorated film, worthy of several honors.  It is, 
however, a hilarious comedy that works 90% of the time, and has enough 
to get the viewer through the other 10%.</P>
<P>Larry and Carol Lipton (Allen and Keaton) are a couple living in 
Manhattan, who one night happen to have a drink with the neighbors next 
door, Paul and Lillian House (Adler and Lynn Cohen).  The next day, the 
Liptons come back from the opera to see that Lillian House has had a 
heart attack, and died.  They are in slight grief, until Carol starts 
noticing that Paul is too "perky" for a widower.  She and family friend 
Ted (Alda), who happens to be a recent divorcee that is also in love 
with Carol, start investigating the life of Paul House, with Larry 
growing increasingly scared of his wife.  Soon after, Carol draws writer 
Marcia Fox (Huston), a client of book editor Larry into the mix as well. 
 The whole thing ends in a preposterous ending, with crazy plot twist 
after plot twist.</P>
<P>The film is quite erratic.  It works best when it sticks to the 
basic story of these people, who are absolutely neurotic, and their 
fascination with this elderly man, who seems to be very, very nice.  
When it doesn't work is when Allen feels the need to be serious and 
explore human relationships.  Sure, the flirting between Ted, Carol, 
Larry, and Marcia is funny, but does it have to go to the point where 
couples have to break up?  Whatever happened to comedy?  One wishes that 
Allen wasn't so serious, in that he wouldn't have to make something so 
refreshingly light seem so serious when Carol threatens to leave Larry 
for good.  Allen could have stopped at the painfully funny scenes of the 
couple yelling at each other over their flirtations.</P>
<P>The comedic sequences, which comprises the vast majority of the 
film, are downright hysterical.  There are so many funny scenes in this 
movie I can't even count them all.  It's written beautifully, with Allen 
providing enough lines in all the conversations that are just too much.  
This is a very talky film, but so much of it is hilarious that I don't 
really care.  Everything unfolds quite nicely until the end, when 
Allen's relationships begin to falter.  Until that, this is a funny, 
light, sometimes morbid piece that truly does work.  What pushes it 
along are the performances, all of which are exquisite.  Keaton is 
marvelous, and a tad more neurotic than the bumbling Allen, who plays 
the role he has defined again.  Alda is truly hysterical, and Huston 
shows up with just enough exotic panache to add even more insanity to 
this piece.  These are four incredibly screwed up people, people that 
are just too much. </P>
<P>In the end, the whole thing is a little too much.  It's got a little 
too much preposterous insanity, especially with the ridiculously staged 
ending, which is nevertheless damned funny, as is the film.  Is it 
erratic and uneven?  Yeah, probably.  But it's still got so many comedic 
touches that I couldn't help but smile.  It's a light farcical spoof on 
sleuth movies, and it works so much that the end can be forgiven, as can 
Allen's serious touches.  Ignore that stuff, and you have a very 
entertaining, very amusing film for all ages, something Woody Allen 
hadn't produced in a while.  For all its eccentricities, MANHATTAN 
MURDER MYSTERY gave me a smile from ear to ear.</P>
