<PRE>                                 THE NASTY GIRL
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1991 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     THE NASTY GIRL is a German film by Michael Verhoeven and stars Lena
Stolz in the title role.  The story concerns a young woman in a small
town in Bavaria who begins to research the town's history during the
Third Reich.  When she encounters roadblocks and hatred, she digs in and
eventually uncovers the whole, buried past.</P>
<P>     Stolz is a wonder, fresh, impish, wise, knowing, innocent, and
very, very beautiful.  Her performance makes me impatient to see her
again very soon.  She is supported by a large cast of character-type
actors; I particular commend the man who plays her husband and the woman
who plays her grandmother.</P>
<P>     I was interested in the story and the characters, but I was also
intrigued by the mix of styles used to make the film.  It is alternately
and sometimes simultaneously a conventional movie, a TV-style
documentary, and a stage play.  The mix is smooth and seamless, although
at times it appears arbitrary and without any dramatic justification.
Still when you see the title character on camera with a mike narrating
her own dramatic actions or when a court scene is presided over by a
fat, coughing, blue statue of blind justice, I am charmed by the
audacity of the film-making and challenged in ways that I seldom am by a
movie.</P>
<P>     I hope you get to see this movie.  What it has to say is both comic
and important and the way it says it is intriguing and successful.</P>
