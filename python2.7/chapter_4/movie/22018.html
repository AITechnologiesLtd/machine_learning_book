<PRE>"Sleepy Hollow" Review
by Fontaine Lien
Warning: contains spoilers</PRE>
<P>"Sleepy Hollow" is like many other Tim Burton and Danny Elfman
collaborations: a visual treat and a stylistic thriller.  It may not
contain tremendous substance but it is sure a pleasure to look at.  As
he did in the Batman movies, "Edward Scissorhands," "Mars Attacks!,"
etc., Burton proves that he is the master of smoke and mirrors; Elfman
proved, of course, that he can DO scary.</P>
<P>I took a brief look at an e-text of the original "The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow" by Washington Irving (as any remaining memory I had of the
legend itself came from the Disney movie and only featured the
headless horseman riding about), and I must say I liked what the
writers were able to sculpt out of the original story.  They had to,
because the original might have been a fun read but was no movie
material.  Instead, it is to their credit that we get interesting and
*convincing* characters from colonial times who seem to have leapt
right out of the real story from Irving, when in fact most of them
were newly created.  Now I am not so worried for those who might have
their plot spoiled for them because they have read the book.  Much
better than that "Psycho" remake fiasco, eh?</P>
<P>The town of Sleepy Hollow is but one out of many of the film's visual
triumphs.  Perpetually shrouded in fog and gloom, the town seems
steeped in misery even in daytime.  Even the haystacks look morose.
The film begins with awkward shots and a slackening pace but
eventually picks up its rythmn.  One defect of the plot was that we
kept going in this rondeau rhythmn: narrative, we see horseman
galloping and wielding his knife, someone gets killed; narrative,
horseman, murder; narrative horseman, murder.  This gets repetitive
and pretty much every time the sun sets we know what is going to
happen.  We also saw too many heads actually getting chopped off.  If
we hadn't gotten used it so quickly, perhaps it would have a greater
effect on us.  That, however, doesn't distract from the horror when it
*does* happen.  The film is a triumph of black and white and shades of
grey (only to be disrupted by the end by that horrible sunlight) and
mesmerizing visual images and effects.  Burton never once let up on
the fog, and that was a good choice.  Particularly enchanting are
Ichabod's memory scenes which are beautiful yet horrifying to look at.
The red church doors awash in a sea of white were wonderful.  Johnny
Depp plays a wonderfully amusing Ichabod Crane; and while Christina
Ricci was decent in her role, I still maintain that she was miscast
because she looks too much like a child.  Katrina of Irving's story
was young, but not that young.  A stand out is that young assistant
Ichabod employs.  The rest of the characters were just as superbly
cast.</P>
<P>Not only was the film a wonderfully macabre piece, it was a glimpse
into states of affairs when an earlier turn of century was about to
arrive.  It was a treat surveying the costumes, the settings, their
"autopsy bay" and Ichabod's peculiar tools.  Even more so, the film
made a solid social commentary on the dark side of the pioneering
spirit (manifested in the horrors on the killing fields and the head
family's usurption of property which lead to the tragedy itself), and
on ancient and uncivilized practices that religion or social tradition
dictates.  Things that most of us in modern America have forgotten
ever existed before.</P>
<P>Picture an Edward Gorey cartoon.  Ever seen one of those?  They
usually feature someone, often a child, dying or in some state of
mortality.  There's no story to it. It's just death, and even though
it is a simple cartoon, it conjures up a sense of dread in you.  That
is comparable to watching "Sleepy Hollow." It's a gorgeously
illustrated children's book that creeps the heck out of childrens and
adults alike.</P>
<P>Rating: B+ (First viewing, 11/24/99)</P>
<P>* Was that Martin Landau prancing through cornfields in the beginning of
the movie?  Kind of reminded me of that other movie he was in last
summer, where two main characters also ran through cornfields.</P>
<P>* And here we have Christopher Walken with his 15th reprisal of the role
of the freaky villain.  </P>
<P>* There is a nice variation on an oft-seen movie cliche.  Tired of
seeing action movies where hero and villain are at each other's
throats on top of a moving bus/car/train/sailbot/spaceship?</P>
<PRE>* The beckoning hand was a nice touch.</PRE>
