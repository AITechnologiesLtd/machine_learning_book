<PRE>                            2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1996 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     If you've seen the trailer, the #1 question on your mind about 2
DAYS IN THE VALLEY must be:  Is it a PULP FICTION rip-off, or is it a
*bad* PULP FICTION rip-off?</P>
<P>     Well, the answer is this:  Yes, it's a shameless PULP FICTION
rip-off (more like PULP FICTION meets SHORT CUTS), but it's actually
quite entertaining, in its own quirky little way.</P>
<P>     In fact, 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY is the best (and possibly the last
[hint, hint]) of these knockoffs to come down the interstate.  The only
problem is that writer/director John Herzfeld forgot one critical part: 
a cool soundtrack!  The main difficult with 2 DAYS is an uncommonly
lousy score that kills the suspense and the comedy with equal ability.</P>
<P>     But let's talk about the good parts, those mainly being the rich
characters Herzfeld has created to act out his play.  (Please pay
attention.)  It starts with Peter Horton (gets shot early on, a very big
plus) as a deadbeat husband to downhill skier/aspiring scam artist Teri
Hatcher.  James Spader (by far the most fun of the film) and newcomer
Charlize Theron as Hatcher's partners in crime.  Danny Aiello as an
aging hitman working with Spader.  NAKED's Greg Cruttwell as Aiello's
whining hostage.  Glenne Headly as Cruttwell's bookish assistant. 
Marsha Mason as Cruttwell's nurse/half-sister.  Paul Mazursky as a
suicidal Hollywood has-been who is picked up by Mason.  And Jeff Daniels
and Eric Stoltz (the only PULP veteran in the show) as hapless cops on
to all of these characters.  (Plus there are at least three good
cameos.)</P>
<P>     Whew!  D'you catch all that?  It's easier than it sounds, trust me
-- in fact, the fun of 2 DAYS is watching all the pieces come together
via a mixture of slapstick comedy, generally witty dialogue, and blackly
comedic gunfights, fistfights, dogfights, catfights, and any other kind
of fight you can think of.  All the while, Herzfeld manages to weave in
unexpectedly powerful themes of bygone happiness, greed, and
desperation... and The Valley.  And Herzfeld manages to pack all of this
into a very tight 105 minutes.  There's very little wasted footage on
the screen, which is hard to say about many directors today.</P>
<P>     It winds up as a solid picture that is probably accessible to a
wider audience than PULP FICTION was -- there were plenty of squeamish
girly types in the crowd, and no one walked out.  And I was actually
expecting a bad movie!  Go figure.</P>
<P>     [Food for thought:  When was the last time you could get gas in Los
Angeles for $1.07, as is seen in the film?  Talk amongst yourselves.]</P>
