<PRE>                                CHANCES ARE
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        When I learned that the plot of CHANCES ARE involves reincarnation,
my reaction was: oh great, another contrived fantasy.  Much to my delight,
however, I was dead wrong.  CHANCES ARE is a spirited and good natured
romantic comedy in the tradition of BACK TO THE FUTURE and PEGGY SUE GOT
MARRIED.</P>
<P>        In the film,  Alex--played  by Robert Downey Jr.--makes a shocking
discovery about himself when he meets Philip, played by Ryan O'Neal.
Philip invites Alex to join him for dinner at the home of his friend
Corinne and her daughter Miranda.  Cybill Shepherd plays Corinne, a widow
who lost her husband, Louie, 23 years ago and still hasn't overcome his
death.  Blind to Philip's love for her, Corinne lives completely in the
past, posting pictures of Louie all over her house, office, and car.  While
dining with these new acquaintances, Alex experiences the startling
revelation that he is Corinne's late husband, Louie--or at least he was in
his past life.  In short, with his restored memory, Alex/Louie realizes
that Corinne is his wife, Philip his best friend, and Miranda his daughter.</P>
<P>        Given its outlandish premise, CHANCES ARE is a surprisingly good
film.  Although the movie may sound inane, its execution is anything but
gimmicky.  Rather than exploiting Louie's reincarnation as an excuse to
milk easy laughs, CHANCES ARE explores the complications and conflicts that
arise from this unusual situation.  The movie's premise is merely a vehicle
for developing intriguing relationships between sympathetic characters.
For instance, Miranda falls in love with Alex and literally throws herself
at him, which puts him in an awkward spot since he sees her as his
daughter.  Although CHANCES ARE is by no means stingy with its laughs, its
primary emphasis is always on character.  By the end of the movie, Corinne,
Miranda, Philip, and Alex/Louie have all matured; they are wiser about
themselves and each other than they were at the start of the film.</P>
<P>        As much as I liked these characters and their conflicts, I can't
say that CHANCES ARE is terribly profound.  The movie is utterly
predictable, and it fails to leave a lasting impression.  And although the
performances are good, they aren't inspired.  Only Mary Stuart Masterson as
Miranda gives her character an extra spark.  However, these are mostly
minor quibbles in an otherwise charming and emotionally-satisfying comedy.</P>
