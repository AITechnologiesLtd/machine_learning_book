<PRE>Critique:</PRE>
<P>        Right at the beginning we are reminded: This film modifies the
narration of the Bible in some aspects. But the creators put themselves
under the task to treat the story carefully and to show respect, not
only for this paticular religion, but for any religion. Was "Prince of
Egypt" going to be another one of those picuters which use just the
elements of the given story that are appropriate for children in order
to tell a typical all-age-appeal fairy tale? With a certain shudder I
thought back to Disney´s "Pocahontas" which twisted any historical fact
to provide an ordinary love story painted in black and white.
Fortunately, 'Dreamworks-Animation' taught me better: Their first
animated feature presents itself as a mature epic filled with
interesting characters and striking images. A new kind of animation
movie is born.</P>
<P>        The story focuses on the character of Moses, who grows up as the
'Prince of Egypt', though he is actually the son of a hebrew slave. By
the time he becomes concious about his true origin and so he decides to
leave his supposed family. In the desert he has an encounter with God,
who sends him back to egypt as his pawn to free the hebrewn people and
with that to face his --still beloved-- brother Ramses. This tale, with
which every inhabitant of the western hemisphere should, at least in
fragments, be familiar, contains every big emotion --from love to hate--
and many opportunities to present great images, even miracles. This is
the stuff for a traditional vintage epic and it is widely used by the
Draemworks staff. Rarely one has experienced such an overwhelming flood
of breathtaking images in an animated feature. They can be compared in
power to epics such as David Lean´s "Lawrence of Arabia" or Cecel B.
DeMille´s "The Ten Commandments". Thematically it is very close to the
latter. To emulate the style of these named examples and to
simultanously distinguish the film from the common animation movies the
animators used various techniques which were never used before. Whereas
in former times the facial play was limited to the eyes, the eyebrows
and the mouth, Dreamworks presents a more detailed body language here.
Not only the walk and the posture depend on the mood of the character,
the mimic includes also the eyelids, the shaping of the head, and the
cheaks. By that they come very close to real actors. Even small nuances
and changes in the mood can be transmitted that way. Corresponding to
this the characters are also developed more richly. Moses appears as a
dialectical figure who is torn between two essentially different worlds.
He does NOT enjoy the god-given power. Instead he wishes to escape from
his leadership and he wants the changes in his life to be reversed. He
is arkin to an acient greek tragic hero who --though he is trying very--
cannot escape his destiny. His brother Ramses is not presented as a
common villain. He an ambivalent person whose motivations are perfectly
understandable. To him, Moses´ behaviour seems weird. He cannot
understand why his brother wants to lead slaves to freedom, since he
regards them as property. In his education as an heir, he was prepared
to use slaves as an instrument to expand his empire. He was taught that
as a king it is his duty to spread his people and to execute his power,
no matter how gruesome and cruel he has to proceed. Fear is an
intsrument, his father has shown it to him. Still the old Pharao was a
kind man. He loved his children and his people. By the time God
oppresses Ramses by murdering his son the Pharao´s anger can understood.
He projects this act of violence onto his brother Moses and chases him
with his army. Revenge and hate emerge from the situation not from an
one-dimensional characterization. The most negative influence on the
persons has God himself, bad-tempered and in thirst for revenge he shows
himself from his brutal side. He goes for the innocent children like the
rulers then did it to the hebrews. He even surpasses them in cruelty by
destroying the bondage between Moses and Ramses and by terminating more
lives than the Pharaos did.</P>
<P>        Not only through the characterizations, also through the supporting
"cast" and the almost entirely serious mood, the picture creates a grim
and rich atmosphere which makes it appear mature throughout. It is
highly innovative, especially during the numerous highlights like the
Moses´ dream, which transforms the two-dimensional drawings of the
ancient egypt into an astonishing, surrealistic and three-dimensional
experience. Also the attempt to create a symbiosis through a permanent
integration of CGI´s into traditionally generated images has a
harmonizing effect as it prevents suddenly necessary CGI´s from being to
noticeable. This leads to a visual fluency which is not even interrupted
by the final division of the Red Sea.</P>
<P>        Unfortunatly this innovation is corrupted by the clumsy attempt to
include songs. While the musical prologue seems appropriate, there is a
sequence which is obviously borrowed from Disney: Here the priest, who
appeared rather serious up to that point, sing that Moses should look at
the "professionals" (vocabulary of the german version), after he tried
to impress Ramses with a first miracle. Even "Lion King´s" 
elevator-song "Hakuna Matata" would have been more suitable. This
anachronisism nearly destroys the whole atmosphere by attempting to keep
the kids as an audience. The other songs, mostly used as time-lapse or
to transport the thoughts of the protagonists, fit better, at least they
are no distraction. The score by Hans Zimmer, with his choires and his
seas of strings, does justice to this sweeping animated epic.</P>
<P>        All this leads to a film which easily achieves its very ambitious goals
but, in its bold and honourable endevour to be mature, sacrifices most
of the audience, which may prefer to be entertained by the classic,
vintage Disney tricks. Still I would be glad if I was wrong. Though the
head of the Dreamworks Animation Company is a former Disney man, one can
by no means compare "Prince of Egypt" with a Disney feature. He chooses
a totally different angle by attempting to produce large scale epic,
which is animated for variety (and maybe also for budget reasons). In
the case of a success this would open the door for new possibilities in
the genre of animation movies. All I can do right now is recommend this
unique achievement. A fantastic movie, not only among animated ones.</P>
