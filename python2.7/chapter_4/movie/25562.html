<P>"Boys Don't Cry" is a phenomenal story of courage, hope and ultimately 
tragedy. It was Teena Brandon, whom was known to her friends as Brandon 
Teena, a guy, who tragically died in 1993. This film follows Brandon from the 
first time he got his hair cut, to the last seconds of his life. It develops 
relationships between his friends, his enemies, and his love (Chloe Sevingy). 
The film is nothing short of astonishing, and after it was over, I sat in my 
chair, wanting to view the film again.</P>
<P>The movie as said before, follows Teena Brandon, a resident of Lincoln, 
Nebraska, as she makes the transformation into Brandon Teena, a smalltown boy 
who goes to Texas looking for some fun. While in a bar he meets a young woman 
named Candace (Alicia Goranson) whos family/friends start to latch onto to 
Brandon, and they all become the best of friends. Brandon meets Lana (Chloe 
Sevingy) who he instantly falls in love with. His buddies Tom and John 
(Brendan Sexton III and Peter Sarsgaard) are good with him, until they find 
out that Brandon is actually a woman. What once was a beautiful relationship, 
turns into an ugly fight for Brandon's life, for now since he is out as a 
she, they end up brutally raping her.</P>
<P>Before all this tragedy happened however, Brandon lives a happy life with his 
friends, and with Lana. The love of his life, whom he has an affair with, 
even though being a girl. He watched over her, cared for her and loved her. 
They wanted to be together forever, but Teena's life was cut short when she 
was only 21 years old. Tom and John after raping and murdering Teena, went on 
trial and are now facing the death penalty and life in jail, in the process 
they also murdered two more people including a young child.</P>
<P>The film is based on the a true story, and is that of a heartbreaking one. 
This movie like 1997's "Selena" even though knowing what happens in the end, 
you dread it. Brandon Teena was not a bad person, she was just confused. She 
had a disorder known as Sexual Identity Crisis, and didn't know any better. 
Hilary Swank brilliantly brings Teena back to life on the big screen, she is 
an amazing actress that in my opinion gives the best performance I have ever 
seen. She is realistic and tuff in her role to transform from a beautiful 
woman she is, to the man she protrays. Her performance is both insightful and 
brilliant.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is almost like a main character as well, since most of 
them share the same amount of screen time as everyone else does. The guys we 
latch onto then hate later, John and Tom are played fantastically by Brendan 
Sexton III and Peter Sarsgaard. They bring both of their characters out, and 
we feel as if we know the real guys just in the movie itself. Becky off 
"Roseanne" herself Alicia Goranson gives a great, mild performance, and seems 
to know who her character is and relates and brings the best out of her. 
Lana's mom played Jeanette Arnette is wonderfully over the top, but not over 
enough to become too trite, she brings all the good and bad things out in her 
character and perhaps the best supporting actress is Chloe Sevingy who is 
beautifully plays the character of Lana. She is so realistic, and so 
convicing as the character, that you start to actually see the whole film 
through her eyes, and how she saw Teena.</P>
<P>Kimberly Pierce wrote and directed this movie, that exceeds words of how good 
it really is. Its a heartbreaking, emotionally powerful, devistating, sad, 
moving film that has never has a film had such an emotional impact on me, 
that once it was over I actually interacted with who I am, and not who 
everyone wants me to be, or who I should be. The film convinces the audience 
by showing how brave of a man/woman Teena really was, and how she will 
influence people all over the world. If you feel like you are someone else, 
or need improvements upon yourself don't. See this movie and you will 
understand how much you can give up by trying to be the person you aren't.</P>
