<P>Mel Gibson's latest action vehicle is PAYBACK (* ½), a terribly violent,
terribly choppy film that's, well, just plain terrible.  Armed with the
expectation of seeing Gibson in the rare role of a bad guy, viewers will
instead find every other character so unimaginatively despicable that
Gibson will still emerge smelling like a rose.  But more on that later.
First, a little history…</P>
<P>Payback was actually filmed a while ago by first-time director Brian
Helgeland, last year's Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay (L.A.
Confidential) and the writer of Gibson's 1997 action blockbuster
Conspiracy Theory.  Reportedly, Gibson was so unhappy with the finished
product that he convinced the studio to jettison Helgeland out of the
editing room, leaving Gibson to make the final cut himself.  Now, mind
you, this shouldn't be like Jean-Claude Van Damme suddenly gaining
control of a film – Gibson is, after all, an Oscar-winning director
(Braveheart).  But sadly, it is.</P>
<P>Gibson plays Porter, an ex-Marine turned hoodlum that has just scored
$70,000 by robbing a Chinese money-laundering syndicate.  His
heroin-addicted wife (Deborah Kara Unger, The Game) double-crosses him
after the heist, leaving Porter with two ugly bullet holes in his back
while Porter's pilfering partner makes off with all of the loot,
planning to use it to join a mysterious group called `The Outfit.'</P>
<P>In order to get his $70,000 back, Porter starts at the bottom of the
crime world (David Paymer) and works his way to the head of The Outfit
(Kris Kristofferson), meeting many zany characters along the way.  He
also gets back together with Rosie (Maria Bello, Permanent Midnight [and
now 0 for 2 in film since leaving ER]), his girlfriend who also happens
to be a whore controlled by The Outfit.  The only other female in
Payback is an Asian hooker with a specialty in sadomasochism.  So, for
those of you women keeping track at home, that's two whores and a
junkie.  And the three of them are routinely beaten by whichever male
character happens to be in the scene with them.  Hey, you've come a long
way, baby!</P>
<P>Early into the picture, in one of the only pleasing scenes, we see a
beat-up and penniless Porter stealing $3 from a panhandler and parlaying
it into a new suit, a new gun and several hundred dollars by simply
pick-pocketing and leaving lousy tips.  The film is also accented by
Porter's sporadic, gravel-voiced narrations that seem haphazardly thrown
in just to make the awkward scenes blend together better.  There are
also several scenes that run out of sequence; again, probably due to
Gibson's attempt to salvage his project.  For his $20 million fee, he
could have offered to do a lot more.</P>
<P>As an added bonus, every frame of Payback seems to be bathed in blue
light.  You may have seen the style before in television commercials or
your favorite music videos.  I have no idea what this means.  Is it a
metaphor for the cheerless downcasts that the film portrays?  Or is it
symbolic of its crude, distasteful content?  Maybe cinematographer
(Ericson Core, 187) just likes the color blue.  It would have been
better served if used just for the flashback scenes.  Or not at all.</P>
<P>Helgeland also co-wrote the bland script with Terry Hayes, who scripted
Gibson's last two Mad Max films.  It was based on Donald E. Westlake's
novel `The Hunter' which he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark.
Helgeland and Hayes should have used pseudonyms as well.  Their story is
as boring as it is formulaic, and its unnecessary graphic violence and
obscenity-laced dialogue often induced my fellow viewers into
uncomfortable laughter and, I swear to God, audible wincing.</P>
<P>Payback and Gibson's Porter are best summed up by the genius that sat
behind me, who, in one particularly ridiculous scene, exclaimed, `Man,
he's whack!'  Whack, indeed.</P>
<P>Payback (1:44) is rated R for graphic violence and lewd language</P>
