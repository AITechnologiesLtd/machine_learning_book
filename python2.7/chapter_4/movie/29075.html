<P>Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are, no doubt about it, one of the great 
present-day motion picture teams. Tucker, mugging charmingly for the camera, 
is a comedian who definitely grows on you, and his outright energy that is 
put into his scenes allow it to brighten up considerably. Chan is just as 
vital a part of their union, the straight man to Tucker's funny man who 
actually has a sly sense of humor himself. The characters in which Tucker and 
Chan portray might as well be named "Chris" and "Jackie," though, as they 
appear to be playing slightly more off-the-wall versions of themselves. The 
smaller roles are all unextraordinary and underdeveloped, with the only one 
worthy of note being Zhang Ziyi (who won acclaim in 2000's "Crouching Tiger, 
Hidden Dragon"), as the ferociously beautiful, tough, and psychotic 
villainess, Hu Li. Ziyi has next to no dialogue, but she inhabits her role 
with an undeniably mesmerizing presence that breaks through, full throttle, 
in her nicely choreographed fight sequences. </P>
<P>While there are a few instances that show off Chan's incredible martial arts 
bravado (he has been widely publicized to perform all of his own stunts in 
every one of his films), there are not nearly enough of them, choosing to 
almost always go for the comedy in any situation. And because Lee and Carter 
are playing the wholly defined protagonists, there is little sense of 
suspense or possible endangerment to either party. As a full-out comedy, the 
film works only some of the time (it commits the cardinal sin for simply 
trying too hard, and has end title bloopers that are far more amusing than 
anything in the narrative), and as an action film, it is passable, but less 
than awe-inspiring. "Rush Hour 2" leaves the door wide open for a third 
installment; let's hope the makers try harder next time before spending an 
insanely high $90-million on a story that has been told, quite frankly, to 
death. </P>
