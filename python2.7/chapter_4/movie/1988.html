<PRE>                            IN THE LINE OF FIRE
                   A film review by David N. Butterworth
        Copyright 1993 David N. Butterworth/The Summer Pennsylvanian</PRE>
<P>     Who wouldn't relish the opportunity to redeem themselves for a
past failure if given a second chance?  That's the simple premise
behind IN THE LINE OF FIRE, the latest film to star Hollywood legend
Clint Eastwood.  But the movie takes this thin idea and runs with it,
resulting in a taut and genuinely believable political thriller that's
every bit as watchable as the laconic star himself.</P>
<P>     Eastwood plays Frank Harrigan, a Secret Service agent of long
standing with a Presidential skeleton in his closet--he failed to stop
the bullet that killed John F. Kennedy.  Thirty years later he gets the
chance to prove himself when a would-be assassin comes a-calling,
taunting Harrigan with threats of repeating the horror of Dealy Plaza.</P>
<P>     Eastwood's Harrigan seems like a real person.  He's a
self-confessed "borderline burnout with questionable social skills" who
collects jazz records, tinkles the old ivories, and likes to ride
public transportation.  He also "knows things about people."  Harrigan
refers to himself as "over fifty" in the film (Eastwood is actually
63), and one of IN THE LINE OF FIRE's strengths is that it doesn't
pretend otherwise.</P>
<P>     In fact, Harrigan is paired with a rookie cop, played by Fred
Dalton Thompson, to play up his comparative age and experience.  Then
there's a repeating theme about how Harrigan's just too old for this
line of work--the killer calls, the Feds trace the call, the Feds race
out the door, Harrigan huffs and puffs along.  Given his age, it's
remarkable that Eastwood does so much of his own stuntwork (i.e.,
running).  Finally, the touching relationship that develops between
Harrigan and agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) works because Eastwood
isn't playing a standard romantic lead.  Their abbreviated love scene
evokes a smile rather than a cringe.</P>
<P>     John Malkovich is convincing in the role of James McCrawley, an
obsessive paranoid who's as smart as he is dangerous.  He's not a
generic lunatic, suffering from some pat psychological disorder, but a
frighteningly plausible personality.  And he takes great delight in
pushing all of Harrigan's buttons.  There are lots--and I mean lots--of
shots of Eastwood, receiver pushed to his ear, temples pounding, brow
like a newly ploughed field.  "I don't have to listen to any more of
this!" he growls.  But he's paid to take this psycho's abuse.
McCrawley dribbles and snaps and flips out often; it's clear we're
dealing with a timebomb of a man who's likely to explode at any
moment.</P>
<P>     One of the things that makes IN THE LINE OF FIRE so realistic is
that the producers don't pretend Eastwood's a spry, 30-year-old action
hero.  He, Russo, and Malkovich all perform admirably.  In fact,
Eastwood comes awfully close to acting at times.  Some weak and obvious
wisecracks apart, he really shines.</P>
<P>     Also impressive are the film's supporting characters.  Dylan
McDermott plays Chief-of-Staff Harry Sargent whose role is that of the
typical shortsighted bureaucrat; he's so focused in on his job (in this
case the success of the Presidential campaign) that he's oblivious to
the threat of any real danger.  Gary Cole and John Mahoney play
high-ranking government officials with equal competence.</P>
<P>     But perhaps the nicest surprise is the way IN THE LINE OF FIRE
gives Presidential bodyguards their due.  Their role, protecting
someone as prominent as the U.S. President, is depicted as extremely
difficult and uncompromising.  At a political convention, with
flashbulbs bursting and photographers swarming, Harrigan is among the
anxious agents keeping order.  This is a tough job all right.
Ironically, Harrigan refers to some Secret Service operations as
"window dressing."  If someone wanted to take an anti-tank gun to the
President's limousine, a dozen Federal agents running alongside isn't
much of a deterrent.  All they really do is make the President look
more Presidential.</P>
<P>     What you need in a film like this is a tough, likable lead, a
sympathetic (but not whiny) sidekick/love interest, and a convincing
villain.  IN THE LINE OF FIRE has all three.  Add well-rounded
supporting characters, a surprisingly good storyline (from the pen of
Jeff Maguire), and brisk direction (by Wolfgang Petersen) and you've
got yourself a well-paced thriller worth watching.</P>
