<PRE>ROBOCOP (1987)
Starring: Peter Weller and Nancy Allen
Directed by: Paul Verhoeven</PRE>
<P>This movie was one of the first American films done by director Paul 
Verhoeven.  He has done films since then such as BASIC INSTICT and STARSHIP 
TROOPERS.  All of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp 
on the violence.  In a Verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the 
chest- he gets shot many times all over the body.</P>
<P>ROBOCOP takes place in Detroit in the future.  Things are pretty bleak.  The 
company OCP rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the 
police force.  Peter Weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his 
partner, Nancy Allen.  Peter Weller goes in an empty room alone and gets 
killed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile OCP has a failed demonstration of a ED-209 model robot crime 
fighter.  Someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg Robocop so they 
use any parts worth scalvaging from Peter Weller and make him into the Robocop 
the movie is titled after.</P>
<P>The plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace.  It drags a bit 
towards the end with Robocop wanting to finish everybody off, but plot twists 
keep it exciting.  The acting is  bad from Weller when he is human, but very 
good when he is Robocop.  Nancy Allen does a decent job.  This movie doesn't 
leave itself open for a sequel exactly.  But they made one anyway.  Enter...</P>
<PRE>*** out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>ROBOCOP 2
Starring: Peter Weller and Nancy Allen
Directed by:  Irvin Kershner</PRE>
<P>Detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film.  OCP is trying 
to develop an improved 'Robocop 2' that will be more than a match for 
criminals.  Most of the police force is on strike due to OCP taking it over, 
leaving Robocop to be the police force in the city.</P>
<P>This film is pretty bizaare.  It has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as 
much as Eddie Murphy, even MORE violence than the original, and some more 
humor.  The plot of this movie is pretty large, almost too much so.  There are 
three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up.  The 
effects are still decent though.</P>
<P>This sequel isn't more of the same really, just a darker version ROBOCOP 
dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals.  If you liked the first 
one, watch this.  But be dissapointed.  So later comes...</P>
<PRE>**1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<PRE>ROBOCOP 3
Starring Nancy Allen and Robert John Burke</PRE>
<P>OCP is now owned by a large Japanese company.  Robocop joins a band of rebels 
to counter-attack the evil Empire, I mean OCP.  The Japanese send a 
cyborg-ninja to deal with Robocop.  Among other things...</P>
<P>This movie is easier to follow than the last one.  Which means the plot isn't 
quite as crowded.  This movie isn't anything special though.  Just more of 
Robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way.  Really not reccomended.</P>
