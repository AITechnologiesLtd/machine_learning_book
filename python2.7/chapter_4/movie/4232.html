<PRE>                                   AIRHEADS
                       A film review by Lon Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lon Ponschock</PRE>
<P>Directed by Michael Lehman
Starring: Brendan Frazer, Steve Buscemi, Adam Sandler, Joe Montegna</P>
<P>     I really enjoyed this.  I kind of suspected I would enjoy it since
it is about radio and rock and roll but the real treat was the
*language*.</P>
<P>     AIRHEADS has more in the writing of it than the usual round of
expletives: it's a compendium of slang of the eighties and nineties.
Where else are you going to hear a words like 'queve' or 'dufuss'?  And
all woven into a story that is ideal to display this usage: a metal
trio invades a radio station to get their demo played.</P>
<P>     Michael Lehman is a new name to me, can't tell you much about him,
but Brendan Frazer (SCHOOL TIES, ENCINO MAN) Steve Buscemi (RESERVOIR
DOGS, IN THE SOUP) and Adam Sandler ("Saturday Night Live" and SHAKES THE
CLOWN) plus Joe Montegna (HOUSE OF GAMES, BODY OF EVIDENCE, and many
more) are all well known and talented performers.</P>
<P>     This film has a solid soundtrack, and interesting idea which
succeeds in execution more often than it fails and a passable but
unintrusive directing style which lets the story sort of tell itself
without being too arty.</P>
<P>     This film is about rock and roll and radio: an idea has been done
before on television and in films, always or nearly always to good
effect.  It wasn't really until I did radio myself that I appreciated
the interaction of the two so much.  Radio, more than any other, is
people's media: something everyone can enjoy and potentially *do* as
well.  And there are enough 'holes in the system' to still be able to
get out and do THE WORK if you really want to.  My time for doing that
is pretty much over  but I still appreciate it when someone is out
there with that DIY spirit keeping the independence and the joy of
radio alive.  It's not easy but it can be done.</P>
<P>     AIRHEADS is a feast of language-- street language and has enough
hooks and turns to provide you with some major laughs.  Well, it did
for *me* anyway.</P>
