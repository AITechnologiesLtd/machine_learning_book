<PRE>                             HEAVENLY CREATURES
                       A film review by Bryant Frazer
                        Copyright 1994 Bryant Frazer</PRE>
<P>     Two teenage girls sit outside their school building, comparing
childhood memories.  The one, Juliet, admits gleefully, "I have scars
on my lungs!"  Turns out she spent all too much of those early years in
a sick bed, fighting off infection.  The other, Pauline, lifts her
skirt and drops her stocking to display a scar that runs the length of
her lower leg.  Doctors spent an eternity trying to excise something
unclean from that young leg.  As Pauline goes all weepy recalling the
specifics, Juliet comforts her: "All the best people have bad chests
and bone diseases.  It's frightfully romantic."</P>
<PRE>     Friends for life. </PRE>
<P>     Of course, they're friends in a Peter Jackson movie, so you may
suspect there's something sinister going on. "In the 1950s, Pauline
Parker and Juliet Hulme were branded as possibly the most evil people
on earth," Jackson says in the press materials for HEAVENLY CREATURES,
which is based on the real-life diaries of Parker and the independent
research of Jackson and co-writer Frances Walsh. "What they had done
seemed without rational explanation."</P>
<P>     Let's say the new film is a "departure" from the director's
earlier work, which included the lowbrow comedy BAD TASTE, the wildly
scatological Muppet massacre called MEET THE FEEBLES, and the exuberant
zombie masterpiece BRAINDEAD (known in the U.S. as DEAD ALIVE).  Even
so, you *know* you're watching a Peter Jackson movie.  The delicately
grotesque caricatures, the skewed puritanism of 1954 New Zealand, and
the stifling strictures of family life were all in evidence in
BRAINDEAD, though one could hardly have imagined that Jackson could
make his visions palatable for a general art house crowd.  But that's
what he's done here--and it's absolutely brilliant, one of the finest
films of 1994.</P>
<P>     HEAVENLY CREATURES is really the story of Pauline (Melanie
Lynskey), a quiet schoolgirl of 14 who lacks friends but possesses a
sharp and wild imagination.  She quickly falls into friendship with a
new student, the brash and fanciful Juliet (Kate Winslet).  The two of
them easily forge a relationship where they depend on each other for
the magic that is clearly missing from their lives.  Pauline watches
happily as Juliet corrects her teacher's French grammar, and kisses a
stranger outside a movie theater.  They share an affinity for "the
world's greatest tenor," Mario Lanza.  They share a certain horror at
the sight of Orson Welles.  They spin endless tales tracing the lineage
of an imaginary royal family, and sculpt clay figures to represent the
nobles of their fantasies.  In one scene, the two of them dance around
the New Zealand countryside in their underwear, finally collapsing on
the ground, exhausted from their own enthusiasms.</P>
<P>     The relationship only becomes stronger from there, as the two
discover a passage into what Juliet calls "the fourth world," a
Gilliamesque fantasia of immaculate landscapes where their clay
characters come to life and dance, copulate, and mete out justice to
some of the authority figures populating Pauline and Juliet's world.
(Pauline's diary entry explains to us that the two can perceive the
fourth world only by using an obscure portion of their brains that
"about 10 people" possess.) As the two bond through their fantasies,
their relationship becomes more and more intense (to the exclusion of
the rest of the world) and erotic (to the chagrin and embarrassment of
Pauline's parents).  The tension rises as their friendship is
threatened, and Pauline begins to go out of her mind with grief at the
thought of losing her best and only friend.</P>
<P>     The performances, which border on the farcical, go a long way
toward the success of this story.  Jackson has always had a talent for
coaxing actors to play to the cheap seats while still keeping their
essential humanity about them, which is the key to making sure
audiences care about the human beings as horrible things happen.
Although certain scenes in this film cross the line into the grotesque,
they are made more powerful by the restraint and quiet beauty in
evidence.  HEAVENLY CREATURES is antithetical in many ways to the
theory which drove Jackson's earlier films--break the taboos,
everything in excess, too much is not enough.  Jackson achieved
catharsis by refusing to observe any boundaries in his seemingly
out-of-control films.  But BRAINDEAD, written by Jackson, Walsh, and
Stephen Sinclair, certainly took pains drawing its characters, and the
last half of that very gory film works as a very black metaphor for
young Lionel's difficulties dealing with Mum, Uncle Les, and the rest
of his frightening family.  And even MEET THE FEEBLES devoted a
tremendous amount of expository time to something very much like
character development (on the other hand, it also devoted a lot of time
to showing Muppets being blasted into clouds of blood by machine
guns).</P>
<P>     At this point in his career, you really have to admire Jackson's
relationship with cinema.  Having exhausted the possibilities of the
gross-out, he has turned his energies to something more delicate, and
more affecting.  This kind of film is a highwire act--if it's not
constructed perfectly, the results are disastrous.  The story needs a
wholly remarkable and absolutely believable friendship at its core, the
kind you can believe supersedes all other human concerns.  Jackson
delivers, offering up characters who feel the same glee at thumbing
their noses at society that the director must have felt as he made
those early, low-budget affronts to good taste.  At the same time, the
film's structure demands rational and beautiful segues from the real
world into fantasia, a ballet of sensibilities that Jackson pulls off
without a misstep.  He has created a dark and transcendent love story,
a graceful and complicated interweaving of innocence and obsession that
begs our sympathy and compels us to understand the beautiful motives
that can underly the most dreadful of human schemes.</P>
