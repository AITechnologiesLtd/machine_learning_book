<P>     Part biography, part social autopsy, and part movie criticism, FROM 
THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG is a fascinating perspective of the life and 
films of the star of JOAN OF ARC, BONJOUR TRISTESSE, LILLITH, and PAINT 
YOUR WAGON.  From director Michael Rappaport, who previously brought the 
equally-inventive ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES to the screen, FROM THE 
JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG gives a posthumous (Seberg committed suicide in 
1979), speculative interpretation of what the actress might have said 
about her career.  Played by Mary Beth Hurt (who grew up in 
Marshalltown, Iowa, Seberg's home town), Rappaport's vision of Seberg 
speaks with a barbed tongue that spares no one -- not Otto Preminger, 
Jean Luc Godard, Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, or any of her three 
husbands.</P>
<P>     "Most of my movies were mediocre, but I was in one or two great 
ones," confides Seberg at the beginning of this odyssey.  It's a concise 
judgment of a career that has been forgotten by almost all but the most 
ardent film-goers.  Seberg burst on the movie scene in 1957, when, at 
the age of 17, she beat out 3000 contenders for the title role in Otto 
Preminger's epic biopic, JOAN OF ARC.  The movie was, to put it mildly, 
a disappointment, due in large part to Seberg's horrible miscasting.  
Her career was almost over at the beginning, but Preminger used her in 
his next film, BONJOUR TRISTESSE, an examination of a daughter's 
obsessive love for her father (David Niven).  Few people saw the movie, 
but among those who did was Jean Luc Godard, who instantly wanted Seberg 
for 1959's BREATHLESS.  Suddenly, she was a celebrated actress.</P>
<P>     BREATHLESS and 1964's LILLITH, the chronicle of a woman's slow and 
sure descent into madness, represented the heights of Seberg's uneven 
career.  After those films, she appeared in a number of awful-to-
middling pictures, often as a nymphomaniac.  Some of her most degrading 
work was done for her second husband, director Romain Gary (including 
1968's BIRDS IN PERU), who apparently believed that "all women are 
whores and all men are sons of whores."  Several years later, in 1969, 
Seberg appeared opposite Clint Eastwood (with whom she had a brief 
affair) in the failed musical PAINT YOUR WAGON.  Her final American 
film, and the one seen by more people than anything else she did, was 
1970's AIRPORT.  Her swansong screen appearance in 1976 was in a 
nondescript role in a virtually-forgotten picture called THE WILD DUCK.  
Three years later, with her personal and professional life in shambles, 
she took an overdose of sleeping pills.</P>
<P>     FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG draws parallels between Seberg, 
Jane Fonda, and Vanessa Redgrave.  All were political activists -- Fonda 
against Vietnam, Redgrave for the PLO, and Seberg for the Black Panthers 
(an affiliation for which she was hounded by J. Edgar Hoover and the 
FBI).  All were connected, in one way or another, by their husbands, 
lovers, or previous directors.  At times, this parallelism seems forced, 
but it leads to a number of interesting observations about Fonda and 
Redgrave.</P>
<P>     Despite generous heapings of gossip and indisputable fact, the most 
interesting aspect of JEAN SEBERG may be the film criticism.  Rappaport 
thoroughly dissects at least five of Seberg's films (JOAN OF ARC, 
BONJOUR TRISTESSE, BREATHLESS, LILLITH, and BIRDS IN PERU), offering 
commentary of the depth and insight that is typically found in only the 
most exhaustive critical essays.  Rappaport also offers an opinion of 
what made Seberg unique -- according to him, she was the first actor to 
stare blankly back at the camera.  </P>
<P>     JEAN SEBERG's social viewpoint is indisputably cynical.  With a 
deceptively-bland expression, Mary Beth Hurt delivers scathing line 
after line, contemptuous of everything from the roles of women in film 
(either mad, oversexed, objectified, or some combination of all three) 
to the influence that Clint Eastwood's screen personae had on Presidents 
Reagan and Bush.  It's a vivid, feminist perspective that strikes more 
than a few raw nerves because of its acuteness.</P>
<P>     Jean Seberg's career began with her being burned at the stake 
(literally and figuratively) in JOAN OF ARC.  It ended when the FBI's 
relentless persecution, coupled with various personal problems, pushed 
her to suicide.  FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG examines the public 
life bookended by those events.  There are some aspects of Seberg's 
career that perhaps deserved more screen time, and certain tangents 
(such as one focusing on Fonda) that could have been reduced or 
eliminated.  On the whole, however, this may be 1996's most unique 
motion picture to date, and is certainly one of the most innovative 
pseudo-biographies ever to reach the screen.</P>
