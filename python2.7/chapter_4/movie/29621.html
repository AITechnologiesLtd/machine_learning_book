<PRE>DON'T SAY A WORD
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Surrounded by hype, high hopes, and the promise of an over-the-top
performance by Clueless's Brittany Murphy, Don't Say a Word looked full
of promise.  Hell, when I hear that "I'll never tell" whisper on the TV
commercial, goose bumps run up my spine.</P>
<P>Alas, Word is filled with little but disappointment, a kooky mix of
Girl, Interrupted and Ransom, with Michael Douglas and company
collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid and dull kidnapping
thriller.</P>
<P>Douglas stars as Nathan Conrad, renowned New York psychologist, devoted
father of Jessie Conrad (Skye McCole Bartusiak), and loving husband to
Aggie Conrad (Famke Janssen).  After a gang of jewel thieves, headed by
Sean Bean's Koster, kidnaps his daughter, Nathan is forced to extract
from his new patient, the catatonic and violent Elisabeth Burrows
(Murphy), the location of some hidden bank job booty that her father hid
from the Koster gang a decade ago.  But with hard-nosed Detective Sandra
Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito, doing her best J. Lo impression) tracking
down Koster and his gang of hoodlums, the stakes are raised as Nathan
races against the clock to crack the mystery of Elisabeth's head in
order to get the goods inside.  The catch - Nathan only has until five
o'clock to solve the puzzle!  Whoa, the suspense is almost too much.</P>
<P>Don't Say a Word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes.  Murphy looks
and acts like Linda Blair from The Exorcist during the first part of the
movie, then turns around and reprises like her role from Girl,
Interrupted.  And the only real "crazy" to be found in the film is
director Gary Fleder's (Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead)
staggering use of flashback sequences.  Oliver Platt, Famke Janssen, and
even Sean Bean are decent actors, but the stuff they are given here --
such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her
crutch -- is insulting and demeaning.   Additionally, the use of the
surveillance cameras and laptops to track Nathan's every move is
downright unbelievable.  How do ex-cons fresh out of the Big House
afford all this equipment?</P>
<P>Despite its flaws, Don't Say a Word is surprisingly some of the best
mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up. 
Americans love lukewarm, half-baked thrillers starring big names and
accompanied by cheap thrills.  Someone get me my lithium!</P>
