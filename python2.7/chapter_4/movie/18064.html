<PRE>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Harrison Ford; Sean Connery; Denholm Elliot; Alison Doody & John
Rhys-Davies</P>
<P>How do you make an Indiana Jones film even better? By adding Sean Connery to
the cast. With the one two punch of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, it is
pretty darn difficult to come up with a bad final product. When you add
Stephen Speilberg as the director and George Lucas as producer and one of
the writers, all the elements are there for a spectacular film experience.
Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade does not disappoint on any level. Other
than the fact that this has long been reputed to be the last film in the
series. One can not be just a little sad that this much talent may never
collaborate again to make another one of these films that really represent
why people love going to the movies.</P>
<P>This time out, Indiana's (Ford) father, Henry Jones (Connery) is working for
a wealthy collector who is financing his life long quest for the Holy Grail.
The Nazis, who are also interested in the Grail, are in competition with
Jones. (I guess they are still ticked off over that whole Lost Ark thing.)
Anyway, Jones goes missing. So son Indiana travels to his fathers last known
location, Venice, to try to find out what happened to his father and also
see if he can't complete his father's search for the Grail. He travels with
longtime friend, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), and the hook up with the
elder Jones' assistant, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody). Together the
three search Venice for clues to the location of the Grail. Jones eventually
finds his father who joins the group on the quest for the Grail. As usual,
Indiana's adventures are never dull, and this time he has to deal with
Nazis, rats and a high speed boat chase on the way to his goal of the Grail.</P>
<P>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade is very well written and lives up to the
first two films. No disappointments here. The film opens with a flashback
sequence with Indiana as a boy and explains many of the reasons that Indiana
is the man he is. Last Crusade is frequently funny which is a tribute as
much to the interaction of the leads as it is to the sharp writing. Harrison
Ford and Sean Connery are perfectly cast as the father and son who don't
always see eye to eye. Throw in the supporting cast of Denholm Elliot and
John Rhys-Davies (Sallah), both returning to their roles from Raiders Of The
Lost Ark and there are more than a few light moments intertwined with the
seemingly nonstop action.</P>
<P>Like the previous films, Stephen Speilberg gives us a film filled with
elaborate stunts and the sort of settings that can only be found in an
Indiana Jones movie. There is virtually nothing wrong with this movie from a
technical standpoint. Last Crusade has stood up well in the 10 years since
it first hit the big screen. It is easily one of the finest action/adventure
films ever made. This film also compares very well to the first one, Raiders
Of The Lost Ark, which in my opinion, is quite possibly the best film ever
made.</P>
