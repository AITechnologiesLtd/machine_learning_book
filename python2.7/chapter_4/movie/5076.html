<PRE>                                 GIRL 6
                       A film review by Joan Ellis
                    Copyright 1996 Nebbadoon Syndicate</PRE>
<P>Spike Lee's "Girl 6" is an inexcusable bore. The
producer/director has turned lazy. Don't look for a story; don't
anticipate a laugh or a tear or a surprise;  don't go. But do ask
yourself how anything this thin and badly done could make it out
of Lee's head, much less onto the multiplex screens.</P>
<P>Girl 6 (Theresa Randle) wants to be an actress. If you're
going to build a movie on that shopworn notion, you better have
fairy dust in your pocket. To pay the rent she takes a job as
girl #6 in a phone-sex telephone bank. "O.K., that's a new one:
what shall we do with it?  Let's string together all the phone
sex words and images we can muster and blow the audience away."</P>
<P>Mr. Lee, it seems, is unaware that mainstream America is
bombarded daily in our multimedia culture with the words and
images he finds so hilarious. Girl 6 sits in her cubicle
responding to the "hear me, hit me, fix me" phone calls that come
in from men who sneak their telephone pleasure. Mr. Lee seems
gleeful in informing us that many of them are corporate
executives. Wow. Really?</P>
<P>As added interest, he promotes Girl 6 to the rank of
"Fantasy Caller."  Same game, with the added freedom of working
from home--the better to abandon yourself, you see.</P>
<P>We wait in vain for one of the phone calls to develop into
an interesting subplot. A love story perhaps?  A crime? 
Anything?  No. Operating on a zero baseline, Lee shoots his
picture full of celebrity cameos, sure that this will do the
trick in a society that values such things. </P>
<P>It's a little hard to tell whether Quentin Tarantino is
playing himself or a fictional Hollywood hotshot of the month.
Madonna once again enjoys assuming a disguise--this time, a
small-time boss in the world of secondhand gratification. The
marvelous Halle Berry is on hand, to no effect. The failure of
the presence of these proven performers to ignite anything is
just further proof that Lee forgot to build the fire.</P>
<P>The Spike Lee who captured pieces of American culture with
such piercing precision in "Jungle Fever" and "Do The Right
Thing" seems to have succumbed to the inevitable. There's an
unattractive arrogance to thinking that millions of people will
be interested in one long, rotten, hypocritical evening of
telephone sex without any connective storyline. He even dares to
imply a comparison to Meg Ryan's sublime coffee-shop orgasm in
"When Harry Met Sally" without any of the sly humor to put it
across. </P>
<P>Lee's assumption that this hodgepodge can grab an audience
is astonishing. His callers count their fantasies in minutes, but
he smothers us for almost two hours with his own. The inescapable
conclusion is that he too has chosen the easy road to
self-gratification. Don't let it be at your expense.</P>
