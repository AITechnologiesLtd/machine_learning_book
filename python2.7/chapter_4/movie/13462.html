<PRE>SLIDING DOORS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1998) USA, 126 mins </PRE>
<P>THE CREDITS: Directed by Peter Howitt; Starring Gwynyth Paltrow, John
Hannah, John Lynch</P>
<P>THE VERDICT: A solid, innovative high-concept story that's well-executed
and quite effective. Not quite a masterpiece, but there's a lot to like
about this film. </P>
<PRE>THE RATING (out of 5): * * * *</PRE>
<P>Did you happen to read my review of THE FULL MONTY the other week? If so,
you may recall I described the film as a quiet, rather unassuming character
drama with heart. The same could equally be said of SLIDING DOORS, which is
not at all dissimilar in style or tone. However, there is one big
difference between the two films -- the plot. Frankly, THE FULL MONTY was
extremely lucky to pull of its rather flimsy plot about male strippers,
whereas right from the offset SLIDING DOORS had a no-lose script.</P>
<P>It's an fresh slant on that most eternal of questions -- "what if?". Who
among us can honestly say they never ask themselves "what if I'd only done
such-and-such…what if I'd acted differently in situation x"? Well, SLIDING
DOORS actually answers that question, in the case of Helen (Paltrow) who
narrowly misses her train by a half second. But we also see, in a parallel
universe if you like, a Helen "B" who does catch the train, and how doing
so affects her life in so many ways.</P>
<P>The film follows the unfolding lives of both Helens. The Helen who caught
the train arrives home early and finds her husband Gerry (John Lynch) in
bed with another woman. She dumps him, and soon meets the ever-so charming
James (John Hannah) who soon succeeds in winning her heart. At his
suggestion she sets up her own, successful P.R. business. This Helen
becomes a winner in love and business. But the "other" Helen -- the one who
missed that train -- never discovered her husband was having an affair (at
least not until much later on in the film), and is trapped in a menial job,
living with an adulterous husband. </P>
<P>First of all, you have to give credit to writer Peter Howitt. It's a very
tricky concept to dramatise, and the film could easily have degenerated
into a convoluted, confusing shambles. But it doesn't. Both storylines are
intertwined beautifully, and I, for one, had no difficulty following them
at all (of course it helped that both Helen's had different hairdos!). It's
not until the end of the film that both storylines again converge in a
clever, unpredictable and very satisfying conclusion. I'm sure it wasn't
easy to come up with an ending that would tie up both storylines, and I was
well aware that a lot of the success of this film would depend on its
resolution. I won't give anything away in case you've yet to see the film,
but the conclusion features a poignant but brilliantly conceived twist that
neatly bookends 
the two storylines in an appropriately bittersweet coda.</P>
<P>As I've said, it's a very good film, but there are one or two slight
problems that prevent it from being truly outstanding. As in THE FULL
MONTY, the comedy is underplayed and the character drama maybe a little too
low-key for some tastes. You might also notice that the film tends to focus
on Helen's love life more than anything. That's all good and well -- it's a
romantic comedy, after all -- but it almost gives the impression that the
film is under-ambitious. Heck, I don't mean I expected anything
ridiculously over-the-top like FOREST GUMP (Look! She's a sports star! Now
she's a war hero! A shrimp boat captain! A millionaire!!). But it just all
feels a little too low-brow. Thankfully it's just a minor niggle, and it
doesn't hurt the film that badly at all.</P>
<P>The splendid performances of the cast give the film a remarkable boost, and
more than overcome any minor problems that might otherwise mar this film.
Gwynyth Paltrow is perfectly cast in the lead role. Not only is her London
twang faultless, but she's an engaging, likeable screen presence and she
carries the film magnificently. John Hannah is similarly good as the
charismatic James, though he isn't actually given much to do in the role
other than "be charming"! John Lynch also does a pretty good job as Helen's
two-timing husband, managing to be sleazy but likeable at the same time.
Certainly no problems the acting department, and the directing is equally
competent.</P>
<P>Summing up -- SLIDING DOORS is a well-plotted and thought-provoking
treatment of that ol' "What if?" scenario. Sometimes a little too mellow
for its own good, but an otherwise intriguing, beautifully-performed and
touching character drama that's well worth a look.</P>
