<PRE>DEAD ALIVE (1992)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Peter Jackson
Writers: Peter Jackson, Stephen Sinclair, and Frances Walsh (story by
Stephen Sinclair)
Starring: Timothy Balme, Diana Peñalver, Elizabeth Moody, Ian Watkin,
Brenda Kendall, Stuart Devenie</P>
<P>New Zealand director Peter Jackson's film "Dead Alive" (a.k.a.
"Braindead") gets major plus points for what may be the greatest single
piece of gorefest ever put on celluloid.  And he even gets plus points
for making a great film even before it reaches its big climax with the
aforementioned fest o' gore.  After re-watching this after seeing his
American debut, "The Frighteners," I could hardly believe it was the
same director, and it wasn't just because there was a significant lack
of gore, but because this film is so darkly comical and wild that it's
just widly entertaining.</P>
<P>"Dead Alive" takes place in 50s New Zealand, and deals with the arrival
of a Rat Monkey to the zoo there.  After a trek there, and some good old
limb-hacking, this dangerous Monkey, which turns whoever it bites into a
flesh-hungry zombie, is put in a zoo cage, and after biting one woman,
the film takes off on its surreal, and hysterical path, obviously
leading to a giant climax (ahem, the gorefest).</P>
<P>Timothy Balme plays Lionel, the inept, wimpish son of a rich New Zealand
bitch of a mother, who orders him around, and is more attached to him
than that mother in "Spanking the Monkey."  When he gains a love
interest in the form of a hispanic general store clerk named Pequita
(Diana Peñalver), she becomes insanely jealous, and is bitten by the rat
monkey during her bit of eavesdropping on their zoo date.</P>
<P>Lionel does all he can to help his mother, who is decomposing every
second, and is soon trying to eat the nurse.  When he finds out what's
going on, he tries to stop it, but, being the wimp he is, doesn't have
the guts to ask anyone for help.  Soon, he's keeping four zombies in his
basement, trying to watch over them, even as he's loosing Pequita, and
his obnoxious, oafish, John Goodman-looking Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) is
making stakes on the mansion, which Lionel has accidentally given to him
in the rush of things.</P>
<P>This, of course, brings us to the afore-afore-aforementioned gorefest.</P>
<P>And what a sight it is to behold.  For over 30 minutes, we witness a
large party being crashed by zombies, eventually turing everyone but an
elite few into zombies, who have to fight together.  We see
decapitations, appendages being ripped apart, a man being cut in half by
a rake, a zombie-chick's head being engulfed by a lightbulb, a zombie
baby running around, and a man using a lawn-mower as a deadly weapon. 
It's one of the most enjoyable 30 minutes in a film...if you have the
stomach for it.</P>
<P>"Dead Alive" features non-stop, no holds barred black humor, which makes
this film totally bizarre, and nothing to take seriously at all.  The
film seems to mock old zombie flicks through the entire film.  The
zombies are always presented with a lot of comedy, including two of them
having zombie-sex, and procreating a zombie baby.  And the romantic
subplot between Lionel and Pequita is handled with the utmost
campiness.  There are even some great one-liners - the best being a
zombie-fighting, karate/tai-chi fighting priest's declaration, "I kick
ass for the Lord!"</P>
<P>The acting is also done with huge campiness.  Timothy Balme has a great
knack for the kind of quiet, shy hero who is too meek to let anyone know
he has a group of zombies living in his basement, too attached to do
away with his zombie mother, and too shy to let Pequita know why he has
been ignoring her, as well as too weak to not let his Uncle Les take
over the household.  And Ian Watkin as Les steals the entire movie with
his absolutely hysterical performance.</P>
<P>"Dead Alive" might not be a masterpiece, but it is one of the few
frequently funny and wonderfully concously-campy horror films, and of
course, it just elevates the gorefest to a work of art.  And if you try
to rent it, settle for nothing less than the unrated version.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***1/2</PRE>
