<P>Three sisters (pace Anton Chekhov) and their working-class South 
London milieu are the subject of a fictional cinema-verite (a 
contradiction in terms, but let it be) semi-plotless tale. There's 
Nadia who works in a coffee bar and is looking --through personals -- 
for a man with whom she'll have a relationship that may include --but 
would ideally go beyond -- a one-night stand. There's Molly who has a 
husband (common-law or official --it is never explained), Eddie. He 
has a dull job.  She seems happy enough with him; both are rather 
joyfully expecting a baby very soon. There's Debbie, a promiscuous 
hairdresser who has a young son and is divorced (or separated) from 
rather loutish Dan.</P>
<P>Add to this the parents of the girls. Eileen and Bill. Their marriage 
is loveless --we get no explanations. The movie's documentation 
informs as that both parents are, and I quote,  "hurt by the 
estrangement of their youngest child, Darren."  But neither I nor the 
companion I watched the film with had caught anything about Darren, 
who, to make matters worse, is hardly on screen.</P>
<P>The daughters and their progenitors live each in their own place, all 
of which seem to be in the same area. The film covers its characters 
over a period of four days, indicated by screen titles.</P>
<P>"Wonderland" is essentially a slice-of-life movie which takes place 
in a limited area and over four days. It was photographed with 
hand-held (mostly or only, I cannot tell) super-16 mm. cameras, in 
available light, to gain mobility and unobtrusiveness, to allow for 
improvisations and easy changes, to give the movie a spontaneous, 
para-documentary look and feel. Then it was blown up to 35mm, which 
allows its projection in movie theaters.</P>
<P>There is often a purplish or other cast to the images. Audiences 
unfamiliar with 16mm film may justifiably think that the whole thing 
was shot on video. It was certainly shot without regard to American 
ears. The working-class British accents, though not as pronounced as 
in some other movies from the UK, are unclear and could use 
subtitles. In its effort to show life as it is rather than staged, 
the film also disdains other traditional clarities. Who is who and 
what to whom remains murky for a long time. It is only  later that 
one understands that the three girls are sisters, foe example.</P>
<P>Among the oddities are speeches by Eddie, the very pregnant Molly's 
companion. More than once he is shown on some sort of bridge (or 
overpass?) speaking aloud to the unseen camera and microphone, which 
makes no sense. He is rehearsing what he will tell Molly, that is, 
that he quit (or lost?) his job and will look for another. But this, 
within a film that is keen on catching naturalness, is a most 
artificial process, a soliloquy-type situation, a la Hamlet --and 
Eddie is no Hamlet.</P>
<P>The various events take place in real locations, not studio sets. 
They include visits to Nadia's cafe, to a pub, fireworks watched by 
Debbie's son Jack, Jack's accident at the fireworks, the clinic where 
he is taken by the police and in which clinic Molly gives birth, etc. 
There's also the troubling fact that the girls' mother poisons a 
neighbor's dog whose barking kept her awake.</P>
<P>"Wonderland" does not judge, preach or moralize. It tells it the way 
it is. But structurally it is messy. And the unrelenting  misery of 
the tribe is overkill. There must be better ways to keep you 
interested --if not deeply involved-- in the unhappiness of the 
characters. It does not help either that the musical score  is 
over-the-top and irritating, the way it hammers sounds that are wrong 
for essentially simple people.</P>
<P>The performers are good at what they do but this does not suffice. 
Some of the players may be familiar to Britons or viewers with 
photographic memories. I only remembered  Jack Shepherd (the father). 
And I was surprised to read that Kika Markham (the mother) had her 
first major role in Francois Truffaut's "Two English Girls" back in 
1971.</P>
