<P>     MAKING UP is the debut of 26-year old German director Katja von  
Garnier, who completed this surprisingly-polished one-hour feature as  
her graduate thesis for film school.  Despite its relatively humble 
origins, the movie has become a top ten hit in its native country, and, 
after seeing the picture, it's not hard to understand why.  MAKING UP is
charming. </P>
<P>     While many of the plot elements in this romantic comedy are staples 
of Hollywood's ventures into the genre, von Garnier avoids a number of 
pitfalls common to typical big-budget American ventures.  The female 
characters are more real than the men and, in a case of turnabout being 
fair play, it's the males who are reduced to the level of sexual objects 
while the women have all the good lines.  Also, the running length is 
about right for the story.  There is no evidence of padding things out; 
when the story has been told, the end credits roll.  This keeps the pace 
consistent and energetic. </P>
<P>     Frenzy (Katja Riemann) and Maischa (Nina Kronjager) are best friends.  
Frenzy is older, more mature, and supposedly secure enough in her self-
awareness that she doesn't have to be in a relationship to feel 
fulfilled.  Maischa, on the other hand, finds it difficult to live if she 
isn't half of a couple.  One day at a party, she spies Rene (Gedeon 
Burkhard), and falls for him on the spot.  After arranging a date with 
him, Maischa convinces Frenzy to come along as a companion for Rene's 
friend Mark (Max Tidof).  Frenzy and Mark take an instant dislike to each 
other, but it doesn't take a cinematic genius to guess in which direction 
their relationship is going. </P>
<P>     MAKING UP has just about everything going for it - strong writing, 
inventive direction, and believable performances - except originality.  
The movie is comfortable because its situations, even though presented in 
a slightly different culture, are familiar.  The two main characters have 
a real chemistry that is rare between two women (probably because of the 
dearth of solidly-written female characters). </P>
<P>     MAKING UP is peppered with laughs, never taking itself too seriously.  
The scenes of the women getting ready for their dates are delightful - 
all the moreso because they have the distinct "ring of truth."  The 
script is as perceptive as it is humorous, investigating such issues as 
why people are afraid to live their lives alone and how it's easier to 
hide than confront loneliness. </P>
<P>     Katja von Garnier's first movie exhibits a liveliness that dis- 
tinguishes it from most modern romantic comedies.  The best part about 
the film is its characters, who would be just as absorbing if all they 
did was sit around and talk - which is most certainly not the case.  
Here, there's a lot of making out as well as making up. </P>
