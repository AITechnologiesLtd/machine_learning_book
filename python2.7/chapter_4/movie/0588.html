                                THE NAVIGATOR
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1989 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<P>          Capsule review:  For the beauty of its photography and
     the originality of its concept this fantasy from Australia
     and New Zealand is the best that has been seen in America for
     several years.  Yet it loses points because of a muddled
     narrative that leaves the viewer wondering what the story was
     really all about.  Rating: +2.</P>
<P>     It is March 1348 in Cumbria.  In a small mining village there is the
certain knowledge that the Plague is coming.  Connor has been gone from the
village for three months, much longer than expected, just finding out what
is happening in the world.  Perhaps the Plague has claimed him.  His young
brother Griffin waits for his return.  And Griffin suffers from enigmatic
dreams, perhaps visions, of another world and a mission of faith, perhaps an
act of faith so great that God will intercede and protect the village from
the onslaught of the Plague.  God wants the villagers to dig through the
flat disk that is our world and come out on the other side, the Celestial
City.  There they are to forge a cross and place it on top of the mighty
cathedral that commands the Celestial City.  When Connor returns with news
of just how close the Plague really is, the urgency of the mission becomes
obvious.  They dig through the disk and find the Celestial City, a city of
great wonder, though to our eyes it is just your standard 1988 New Zealand
city.  Things we have come to live with are to the pilgrims' eyes great
sights and great dangers.  And so begins their adventure.</P>
<P>     Stylistically filmed in black and white and in color, THE NAVIGATOR
beautifully re-creates the life in a 14th Century village and a comparable
view of life in the 20th Century, though the color photography is much less
interesting.  It is a story told on many levels, not all of which are
comprehensible.  The style of story-telling is usually well told with the
sort of duality of vision that THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY has.  We see the
familiar, but we also see it through the eyes of a strange culture.  Only at
one point does this duality break down into slapstick worthy of a Terry
Gilliam.</P>
<P>     THE NAVIGATOR is an odd and murky fantasy that seems to be pointing to
some deeper meaning that is somewhere beyond view.  As a fantasy it edges
out even this year's FIELD OF DREAMS for originality of idea.  But in the
final analysis the film narrative is muddled and the point of this exercise
remains unclear.  I give it a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
