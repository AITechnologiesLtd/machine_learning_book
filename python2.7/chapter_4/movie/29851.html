<P>ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia
October 16th, 2001 (originally viewed on July, 1991)</P>
<P>As legend would have it, Robin Hood was a man of the people, one who identified
with the poverty of the English people and would steal from the rich and give to
the poor. His determination resulted in ongoing fueds with princes and paupers
and those whom he stole from. The legend resulted in one terrific film with
Errol Flynn back in 1938 called "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (it is still the
definitive version). There was also the more mature, older Robin trying to have
a romantic relationship with a suicidal Maid Marian in "Robin and Marian,"
starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn. In 1991, Kevin Costner and director
Kevin Reynolds had the temerity to bring back Robin Hood to the screen with
Costner's American accent almost intact as a sour but also determined Robin. It
almost felt like the end of cinema as we knew it. Casting Costner was like
casting Gary Cooper as Dracula! Yes, brave casting indeed, but could Costner do
it?</P>
<P>"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" has Costner as a depressed Robin with only
occasional flashes of humor. His depression stems from the fact that he has just
arrived back from the war of the Crusades after a few years, leaving with a Moor
named Azeem (Morgan Freeman) back to England and good old Sherwood Forest.
Unfortunately, Robin's father (Brian Blessed) has been killed by the evil
Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) and now, Robin wants revenge. Plus, he
decides to help several homeless Englishmen and other denizens from the Sherwood
Forest and other villages who need a strong leader to lead them and grant them
freedom. Who better than Robin himself? </P>
<P>In hindsight, I dreaded watching yet another update on the Robin legend. Patrick
Bergin showed some dash but little chemistry in the TV movie that was to be
released theatrically the same year as this film. Only Sean Connery came close
as a fitting replacement to Errol Flynn. Costner shows little gleam - he is the
most morose Robin Hood to ever appear on screen. And yet I must confess that I
enjoyed Kevin Reynold's remake immensely. It is clever, witty, wicked, dark, and
often joyous. It is by no means a great film, largely because of Costner, but it
is a fun ride for the most part. </P>
<P>The action scenes have a thrilling intensity to them. The escape from the
dungeon in the opening sequence (through a modern manhole!) has the
nerve-wracking thrills of an Indiana Jones flick. There are also point-of-view
shots of arrows flying through the air, discovery of gunpowder long before Marco
Polo that results in fiery explosions, flaming arrows, swords that emit sparks
when clanging against each other, screaming crones, black magic, a Maid Marian
(Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio) that knows how to wield a sword though she ends
up as a scared damsel in distress anyway, double-crosses galore, evil priests
and clerics, and so on. This Robin Hood is designed to entertain you in any way
it can and it succeeds. </P>
<P>Though it contains a miscast Kevin Costner, the other actors do their best and
bring some sense of style. Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio is almost Shakesperean
in her mannerisms and excellent English accent as the fierce, loving Maid
Marian. Morgan Freeman excels as Robin's trusty aide who has a bigger sword than
anyone in the movie. But it is really Alan Rickman who steals the show and is at
his devilish, wicked best as the theatrical Sheriff of Nottingham ("Call off
Christmas!"). Rickman goes over-the-top but hilariously so, he just can't
believe one man and his merry band of men could revolt against him. </P>
<P>Director Kevin Reynolds opts for too many close-ups and so this Robin Hood tale
does lack the grandeur of the earlier incarnations. Still, in terms of action
setpieces, he has the right flair. The fiery forest attack is expertly done as
is the heartstopping climax where the Sheriff has a sword duel with Robin. There
is also a nifty sequence where Robin fights a guard who turns out to be Maid
Marian!  </P>
<P>Overlong and nearly parodic (plus containing a "Star Wars" subplot that sure is
grating), "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" is often superb entertainment and a
nice addition to the Robin Hood cinematic legends. Plus, check out the grandly
majestic cameo at the end by a great, iconic actor - it is one of the best
cameos in history. It is such a wonderful surprise that it had audiences
cheering at the end of a screening I saw, as if the real hero had finally
arrived. </P>
