<P>     If your comic tastes run to the urbane, this is most definitely the
summer of your discontent.  THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY brought you
mangled genitalia and dangling bodily fluids; MAFIA! featured flaming
flatulence and a boy being smuggled in a donkey's rectum.  And now comes
BASEKETBALL, co-written and directed by David Zucker (THE NAKED GUN) and
starring Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of "South Park" who gave
the world a talking piece of excrement named Mr. Hankey.  Anyone want to
place bets on whether it's going to be an Oscar Wilde-ian romp spilling
over with tres bon mots?</P>
<P>     Fact is, BASEKETBALL tosses off the kind of groin-level humor that
makes THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY look like a particularly droll "New
Yorker" cartoon.  This tale of two losers (Parker and Stone) who create a
sports sensation combining elements of baseball and basketball scurries
about in search of every imaginable source of vulgar, offensive and/or
just plain immature comedy.  Stone lactates like a Parisian fountain;
Parker slurps liposuctioned fat from a plastic bag; both stars sport
prosthetic male members which make it look like they're auditioning for
the sequel to BOOGIE NIGHTS.  No subject is too sensitive for some sort of
peurile gag:  not gays, not foreign accents, not raving bigots, not
necrophilia.</P>
<P>     Damn them all for making it funny too often to dismiss.  Yes,
BASEKETBALL certainly crosses the line at times from daring to
mean-spirited.  It also includes some wicked shots at professional sports,
from corporate stadium sponsorship to peripatetic franchises to bizarre
promotional giveaways (including "Dozen Egg Night," "Free Range Chicken
Night" and "Anal Probe Night").  The best running gag comes from the
baseketball rule which allows opponent to taunt the player with the ball
in an effort to psych him out.  Stone and Parker take the opportunity to
run with every possible distracting comment, gesture and visual image.
There's nowhere too low for them to sink, and they get enough laughs to
justify going just a bit lower the next time.</P>
<P>     It's hard to tell whether Parker and Stone have the stuff to be
legitimate big screen comic stars.  BASEKETBALL is an ideal showcase for
their malicious, "dude"-spewing wastrel characters; they're like Bill and
Ted with more acid in their veins.  Still, there's a sense that they're
just the slightest bit desperate to impress, too eager to reach for a
four-letter punch line before coming up with a more clever alternative.
When Parker finally goes for a laugh by trotting out the voice of "South
Park's" Eric Cartman, you can bet the audience will go wild with 
recognition.  It just feels lazy, one overgrown adolescent playing to
other overgrown adolescents, congratulating himself for being the id boy
of the moment.</P>
<P>     Strange as it may seem, David Zucker ends up being the steadying
influence which reins in Parker and Stone.  Zucker knows how to play a
near-subliminal visual joke with the best of them, and he works in plenty
of knee-slappers in BASEKETBALL.  He also calls on AIRPLANE! alums Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Stack to help out, with Stack doing a particularly
hilarious parody of his own gig hosting "Unsolved Mysteries."  Even when
he steals from himself in the character of a sick boy at the mercy of
idiots (a la Jill Whelan in AIRPLANE!), he gives it a fresh twist; there's
nothing quite like watching an 8-year-old in need of a liver transplant
doing rounds of tequila shots.  That's one of the tamer bits in
BASEKETBALL, a film that sometimes doesn't know when to quit.  There will
be viewers who revel in that sort of "look at me, Ma, I'm being
irreverent" irreverence.  Others will shake their heads at the
continuation of their comedic summer of discontent, even through their own
embarrassed giggles.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 baseketball joneses:  6.</PRE>
