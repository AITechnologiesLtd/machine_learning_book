                       A film review by <A HREF="mailto:antpage@aol.com">antpage@aol.com</A>

<PRE>A&E's Emma:</PRE>
<P>Directed by..........Diarmuid Lawrence
Kate Beckinsale......Emma Woodhouse
Guy Henry............John Knightley
Raymond Coulthard....Frank Churchill
Sarah Morton.........Harriet Smith
Dominic Rowan........Mr. Elton</P>
<P>Emma the Movie:
Directed by..........Douglas McGrath
Gwyneth Paltrow......Emma Woodhouse
Jeremy Northam.......Mr. Knightley
Ewan McGregor........Frank Churchill
Toni Collette........Harriet Smith
Alan Cumming.........Mr. Elton</P>
<P>     For anyone who saw the TV A&E's prodcution of "Emma" or is thinking
of it, please wait for the movie "Emma" on video, this is a great story
and cannot be missed! The A&E version was not directed by the same person
who did Pride and Prejudice and was not nearly as good I feel. And
certainly didn't come close to the big screen version of Emma staring
Gwyneth Paltrow and directed by Douglas McGrath.</P>
<P>     Emma is the story of a rich and influential young women in 18th
century England who has set her heart on everybody else's love affairs but
her own. She plans to marry off a young women new in her part of the
country to a young man by the name of Mr. Elton. When this blows up in her
face she doesn't learn her lesson and continues to cause all kinds of
havoc to her friend and herself. She later begins to suspect she's falling
in love with a man from out of town, the son of a dear friend of hers. But
while this is going on is there jealousy in the eyes of her brother-in-law
Mr. Knightley? This is what you would call a romantic comedy from the
novelist Jane Austen that was copied in the movie "Clueless".</P>
<P>     As I said earlier the A&E version was vastly inferior to the movie
version, especially the character Mr. Knightley, played by Guy Henry, In
comparison to the movie version of Emma with Jeremy Northam playing Mr.
Knightley.  Guy Henry's chatacter seemed very untrue to the character from
the novel. This is kind of curious, were they trying to create another
Fitzwilliam Darcy from Pride and Prejudice here? I remember the interview
of Guy Henry, he was comparing his character to Darcy's character, I
remember wondering why they ran that question in the interview because the
two characters are very different. I Also remember seeing the video
release for Pride and Prejudice advertised and they only mentioned Colin
Firth, who played Darcy, as staring in the movie, which I thought was odd
because they should have listed Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet before
him, but her name wasn't mentioned. I wonder if Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam
Darcy was very popular among women. So popular that they wanted another
for Emma on A&E. Guy Henry as John Knightley was very one dimensional,
like a characterization.</P>
<P>     All in all I was very dissatisfied with A&E's production of Emma, and
it seems to me that the fault lies with the director Diarmuid Lawrence. To
quote Mr. Knightly "Badly done Mr Lawrence, Badly done". What were they
thinking? After the excellent movie of Emma from McGrath they should have
done some other novel from Jane Austin like Northanger Abby or Mansfield
Park. Their version was bland, flat and not worth my time. Especially
after the humor and style of McGrath's Emma. Douglas McGrath who directed
Emma for the big screen did a great job , I'm going to keep my eye on his
work in the future, he made this a very funny and charming movie.
Beautiful sets too. Also Paltrow did a far better job than Beckensale too,
and of course we know the difference between Northam's and Henry's
Mr. Knightly. Northam was great, and true to the role. I still remember
Northam's character Knightly when faced with going to a party held by the
Elton's saying he'd rather just stay home were it was cozy. And what was
the point of the chicken thieves? I hope everyone who hasn't seen Emma
will not let the story be spoiled by this A&E production, they should wait
for the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow to come out for rent, which will be
out this March.</P>
<P>     And so A&E's Emma gets two stars from me, and Emma the movie
starring Gwyneth Paltrow gets four stars ( 1 being avoid it, 4 being
excellent and 5 being classic ).</P>
