<P>     It seems that movie makers have lost the art of creating a good,
scary vampire flick.  The last such film to grace the screen was
probably FRIGHT NIGHT, and that was a decade ago.  Since then, the
"sensitive" vampire has come into vogue--a creature tortured by its
own inhumanity and appetites.  While these existential nightstalkers
have an appeal as character studies, they aren't all that frightening.
True evil, of the absolute, soulless kind, is what makes for a
terrifying bloodsucker.  Unfortunately, that's not exactly what VAMPIRE
IN BROOKLYN offers.</P>
<P>     To be fair, Eddie Murphy does a better-than-average job as
Maximillian, the last vampire on Earth.  There are moments when Murphy
is positively chilling, and he doesn't ham it up too much.  Comedy is
mixed in effectively, but it's what the humor is mingled with that
doesn't work.  As a horror film, VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN is a failure.
Aside from Murphy's creature, there's nothing compelling in this
picture.  The script is dull, the characters are flat, and the direction
is rather ordinary.  (This is especially surprising considering that
horror master Wes Craven, who did the first and last NIGHTMARE ON ELM
STREETs, is at the helm.)</P>
<P>     Maximillian makes his entrance to Brooklyn by crashing a ship into
the docks.  On board are numerous corpses, all drained of blood.  A huge
wolf is seen disembarking, but no one believes the eyewitness.  Next
thing, there's a vampire roaming the streets, feeding on gangsters and
recruiting a young thief/con man (Kadeem Hardison) as his ghoulish
servant.  But Max is in New York for a reason--he's on the trail of
the only other member of his kind, the offspring of a vampire/human
mating, a woman whose "other half still sleepwalks in humanity."  He
intends to bring out her true nature and introduce her to immortality.
The person in question happens to be Rita Veder (Angela Bassett), a
police officer assigned to investigate the murders on the ship that
brought Max to the United States.  And the vampire isn't the only one
interested in her.  Her partner, Justice (Allen Payne), is equally
smitten.</P>
<P>     The hero is supposed to be Justice, but Allen Payne's portrayal
lacks energy.  The result is a bland and unsympathetic character.  Why
should we care about this guy?  Instead, our attention gravitates to
Murphy, the only performer attacking his role with relish.  Thus, as in
all recent vampire movies, it's the villain, not the good guy, who keeps
us interested.  And Max isn't really such a bad seed--he's just lonely
and misunderstood.  The centuries can turn tedious without a mate to
share them with.  There's some chemistry between Murphy and Bassett, but
absolutely none in the Bassett/Payne pairing.  Yet both relationships
get equal screen time.</P>
<P>     There are a few comic highlights.  One occurs when Max shape-shifts
into an Al Sharpton-type preacher who gives a sermon on how "evil is
good."  Here, as the script ventures into pure satire, it acquires an
edge that is absent most of the rest of the time.  Also, some of the
interplay between Julius (Hardison) and his older buddy Silas (John
Witherspoon) is witty, and worthy of a few laughs.  This pair does a
great "Two Stooges" act.</P>
<P>     Overall, however, VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN doesn't live up to its
promise or premise.  The humor is hit-and-miss and the horror just isn't
all that frightening.  Eddie Murphy proves that he still has screen
presence, but he needs a better showcase.  The problem here isn't as
much the talent in front of the camera as it is the weak and hackneyed
script.  VAMPIRE IN BROOKLYN is in need of an infusion (or should that
be transfusion?) of originality and creativity--two qualities that are
blatantly absent.</P>
