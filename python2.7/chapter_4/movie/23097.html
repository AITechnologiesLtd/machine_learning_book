<PRE>FILM TITLE: Not Of This World</PRE>
<PRE>         !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</PRE>
<P>This is reminiscent of a Spanish film also seen at this Film Festival a
couple of years ago. "The Cradle Song". But the similarity ends there.</P>
<P>The story in this film is rather interesting, and told with a certain amount
of dry wit that is difficult to get into, but eventually allows us a laugh
here and there. The subtleties are not quite obvious, until later, when at a
Bingo game, it becomes apparent what this film is really trying to
accomplish.</P>
<P>On a day when Sister Caterina is going to visit her own mother, we find that
she is handed a baby in a sweater. She does not know what to do, but she
takes it to the Hospital and then the story really starts. She begins
getting attached to the child. In the meantime, we come to see a two other
dysfunctional families. In one, a daughter is leaving home, and apparently
has been hiding -- the pregnancy and the baby she gave away. In the other,
Caterina's mother is upset that Caterina took on the vows of a nun. Well,
there is a third dysfunctional family. Ernesto's little laundry business has
several girls working for him, and his attitude is less than helpful at
times.</P>
<P> Sister Caterina's only clue is a sweater that is given back to her by the
Hospital and she undertakes to go find its owner. It leads her to this small
laundry business. When Ernesto finds out he may have a child the film begins
its run. Sister Caterina is trying to find the mother of the child, and now
Ernesto is interested because he might actually be the father. In the end,
things get back to a semblance of normalcy, and as usual, the status quo
lives on, and those involved are distant from these things, with the
exception of the two parents that get to adopt this child. It's in between
these cracks that this film shines. Not as well done as "The Cradle Song",
but no less effective.</P>
<P> Like the other film, this one spares no second thought about the coolness
and the viciousness of the church and its lack of respect for people
themselves, in lieu of their own order of things ... indeed, not of this
world at all, and the reason for the title. In between lie the emotions of
the young Caterina seeing things happen in her face that bring her to
question her own motives and ideas to herself. What is unusual in the end,
is that she does not renounce her rights, and affirms them even better, or
stronger. One can only hope that she will not have the cold heart of the
Mother Superior, who is not convinced that Caterina is made for the order,
as she has taken this affair with a maternal instinct, which the order
obviously wants to take out of all its nuns. A caring heart, means you can
not be motherly affectionate, or get involved in these things with a human
heart. A very serious theme and charge in general, which 30 years ago would
have had this film "banned" by many authorities, in ways similar to the
works of Luis Bunuel, the style of which this film is not reminiscent of,
but the spirit of the film and way it is delivered, which it is.</P>
<P> Ernesto himself is a loner, and in many ways is a Bunuel'ian hero. He does
not have disdain for the women, but he has obviously been hurt enough that
his aloofness is an issue with women, with the exception of Sister Caterina,
to whom he has taken a serious liking (another Bunuel'ian subtlety), but
probably knows that it is impossible. he gets to witness Caterina's last
battles with herself, on her way to become a full fledged nun. But when
watching the atrocities of human behavior and ideas in action, she does the
one thing that we really don't want her to do. She leaves "this world".</P>
<P> One really wants this film to turn around, I did. It isn't that I think
that compassion should always win over ideas and a commitment that may be
idealistic or futile in the end, but there are a lot of people in those
areas, whose heart is not in question, and they belong there. Ernesto's
indifference at the start, and his slowness into coming around, is in a way,
very similar to Caterina's doubts.</P>
<P> A film that has its fine moments, with two very fine leads in  Margherita
Buy and Silvio Orlando, while not a stunningly well done film, it makes up
for it in spunk and doing. It plods along well, is well written, and though
one may find the end disappointing, it never the less makes it ok. We still
have a baby and an Ernesto to keep track of, I guess.</P>
