<P>Christopher McQuarrie's "The Way of the Gun" is a noirish crime story without 
the post-modern irony of Quentin Tarantino. Although this may be a refreshing 
conceit, the film is nothing more than disposable, mean-spirited, 
one-dimensional hogwash with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  </P>
<P>The convoluted story deals with two amoral sociopaths, Mr. Parker (Ryan 
Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro), who will either resort to petty 
crimes or minimum wage jobs. Thoroughly unsure of themselves, they head to a 
sperm bank where they overhear about a pregnant woman, Robin (Juliette 
Lewis), who has agreed to a $1 million fee to carry the baby of a wealthy oil 
tycoon and his desperate, gold-digging wife. The terminably stupid sociopaths 
decide there is a bargain here if they kidnap the pregnant woman for a 
fifteen million dollar ransom. Problem is they are new at this kind of crime, 
and have no notion on what to do next (heck, Robin is quicker at defending 
herself with a shotgun than they are). </P>
<P>Naturally, a cleaner or "adjudicator" (essentially a smooth hitman played by 
James Caan) pursues the trio, along with two bodyguards (the appealing 
coolness of Taye Diggs and the tactful Nicky Katt, who played a grimier, 
similar role in "The Limey"). This leads them to the seediest kind of motel 
just south of the Mexican border where Parker and Longbaugh are holding Robin 
hostage. And, to remind some of good old Sam Peckinpah, there is an overlong, 
tedious shootout involving the antiheroes and bag men, culminating in an 
empty fountain with broken shards of glass. </P>
<P>The film starts well enough, particularly the kidnapping scene amidst lots of 
gunfire where Robin makes the mistake of not following the bodyguards' 
orders. Unfortunately, as written and directed by McQuarrie (who wrote the 
superior "The Usual Suspects"), there is scant character development and the 
personalities of the sociopaths are nonexistent - they are merely cartoonish 
types used as props to advance the plot. There isn't a single character the 
audience could possibly identify with except for Juliette Lewis's humane 
Robin, faced with carrying a baby while evading bullets, and screaming and 
hollering with pain through the whole movie while in labor. Lewis makes her 
character sympathetic but since she is not the main focus of the film, we are 
left with far too many ugly, emotionally corrupted people taking center 
stage. Boy, do I miss Kevin Spacey's Verbal Quint from "Usual Suspects." </P>
<P>James Caan adds a touch of vulnerability to the proceedings and has some 
clever lines (Examples: "$15 million is not money. It's a motive with a 
universal adaptor on it." "Let's just say I deal in the fine art of 
adjudication.") He also has a touching scene with Geoffrey Lewis, a suicidal 
drinking buddy. In fact, it was nice to see Geoffrey Lewis share one scene 
with his real-life daughter Juliette, though I would have hoped for more than 
seeing them in another typical shootout. As for the leading troublemakers, 
Phillippe hardly has much going for him except for a noticeable accent, and 
Del Toro seems to be in a leftover drug-stoked haze from "Fear and Loathing 
in Las Vegas." You want to see these two murderers rubbed out within the 
first half-hour, and that does not say much for McQuarrie. He makes the 
mistake of not instilling any humanity in these characters, so if he doesn't 
care, why should we?</P>
<P>Conflicted and burdened by repetitive shootouts and silly twists and turns, 
"The Way of the Gun" is an empty void with an ugly, interminable streak of 
meanness. Film noir at its most fatalistic tells us there is no escape from 
the world. Fortunately, you have the option of escaping from this travesty by 
way of the theatre exits.  </P>
