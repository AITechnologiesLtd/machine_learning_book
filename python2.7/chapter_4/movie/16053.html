<P>Well, the battle of the bugs is finally over and I think, cash wise, that
Disney will come out on top once again. After all, there is such a thing a
customer loyalty when it comes to kids and animated movies and whatever they
see at McDonalds (Disney) seems to be their drug of choice. Sadly, it has to
be ours.</P>
<P>A Bug's Life is about a colony of Ants who refuse to give their food over to
the locusts (actually the film's main character, Flick (the Leonardo da
Vinci of Ants (he'd cut an ear off if he had one), messes things up for them
at the beginning by knocking over the altar the ants give the grasshoppers
food on). Having to meet double-quota by the end of fall, the powers that be
send Flick away on a false mission to get larger bugs to help them defeat
the grasshoppers.</P>
<P>So Flick's out of the way and they're working their tails (if they had em)
off to get enough food for the grasshoppers and them. But Flick ends up
mistaking some circus bugs for warriors (due to the temper of Francis
(Dennis Leary), and comes back with them. They find out what he actually
wants, decide to leave, but end up staying after saving one of the Queen
ant's daughters, Dot, from being eaten by a bird (who has a roar that sounds
like a T-rex from Jurassic Park). Why? They got applause, and they suck at
being circus bugs so they'll be narcissistic and get appreciation any way
they can.</P>
<P>So everyone, under the guidance of the genius ant Flick, bands together to
defeat the grasshoppers while developing characters, making cheap jokes, and
laughing all around.</P>
<P>The sad thing about this year's battle of the bugs was that neither film
could make it the right for both ages, like Pixar's earlier film Toy Story
and the rather intelligent short Geri's Game, which everyone got to watch as
A Bug's Life started up. This one catered specifically to the younger
generation, which is fine for them but disappoints me, because I haven't
been five for a long time. Antz catered to us but had our children staring
with a giant "huh"? Look on their faces. I'm saddened by the both of them,
as much as I personally loved Antz, because they've all gotten so caught up
in making the buck that they've forgotten that they have to appeal to both
kids and adults.</P>
<P>I thought both were funny, I thought both had excellent computer animation,
and I think both will do moderately well. But if they could have only
focused on their target audience (families), then they would have done a
helluva lot better.</P>
