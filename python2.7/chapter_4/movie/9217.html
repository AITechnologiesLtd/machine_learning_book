<PRE>Directed by: Oliver Stone</PRE>
<P>Written by: John Ridley (based on the John Ridley novel ‘Stray Dogs')</P>
<P>Starring:  
Sean Penn, Jennifer Lopez , Nick Nolte, Powers Boothe, Joaquin Phoenix,
Billy Bob Thornton, and Claire Danes</P>
<P>Ingredients: 
down and out gambler guy whose car breaks down, frustration, remote town
in Arizona, sleazy women looking for a free ticket out of town,
lecherous underintelligent hillbillies, redneck police</P>
<P>Synopsis:
In this a dark comedy Bobby (Sean Penn) is driving to Vegas to pay off a
gambling debt when his Mustang convertible breaks down in a backwards
Arizona desert town. Through huge coincidences, Bobby loses all his
money and means of transportation. In town he meets an assortment of
annoying and exaggerated backwater creeps: violent unintelligent men and
sleazy women. For example, Jake McKenna (Nick Nolte) is an incestuous
lunk who wants Bobby to murder his daughter/wife Grace. Meanwhile his
wife Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez) is a mentally unstable woman who
promises to run off with Bobby if he murders her husband.  How can Bobby
get out of there before he goes nuts?</P>
<PRE>Opinion:</PRE>
<P>Although the cinematography is great and the performance of the cast
members is strong, it's not enough to overcome two things which are
poisonous to most moviegoers: unsympathetic protagonists, and the
depressing message that life consists of inescapable suffering.</P>
<P>In 1917 the famous artist Marcel Duchamp signed a men's urinal and
submitted it as artwork to the first exhibition of the Society of
Independent Artists -- the idea, I guess, being that it was the job of
the modern artist to shake things up and make the audience look at
ordinary things a new and different way.  To me, Oliver Stone is the
film director version of that mentality. Here he takes an old action
plot (adventurer gets stuck in a hellish hick town), and retools it as a
dark comedy set in the West that preaches a morbid existential message:
that life consists of inescapable suffering. </P>
<P>Okay as art. But the difference between conventional art and a good
movie is that in a good movie the audience is supposed to identify with
and care about what happens to the characters. Aside from the ultimately
depressing existential theme, the central weakness of ‘U-Turn' is that
its characters are colorful, but so disloyal and disgusting that the
audience doesn't really care what happens to them by the end of the
movie.</P>
