<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A good Joel McCrea flick. It is suspenseful, entertaining, fast-paced,
and tautly scripted by Eric Ambler from a novel by Geoffrey Household. A
retired U.S. colonel, Bob Taine (Joel McCrea), living in Dorset,
England, mistakingly thinks he shot a poacher named Reimann with
buckshot -- but the dead man is part of an Iron-Curtain spy network and
was killed by them because he was a double-crosser.</P>
<P>Taine does not want to go to prison for this accidental killing, so he
buries the body in the woods. This sparks a sinister chain of reactions.
His foreign neighbors are spotted by him, as they were suspiciously
looking for the body. Hiart (Marius Goring) and his chauffeur are living
in wealthy landowner Hassingham's house, and are conspiring behind the
master's drunken back with his German-born wife Magda to help spies get
access in Great Britain.</P>
<P>A retired colonel in the Polish Army, now working for Mr. Randall
(Culver) in the cloak-and-dagger War Department, Sandorski (Lom), meets
Taine in the "shoot" area and tells him he knows all about Reimann (he
was now going over to their side). The two decide to work together to
get the spies but they are forced to tell Mrs. Taine (Keyes) about it,
as she figures out something is up.</P>
<P>The German spies use beacons to help a plane mysteriously land at night
in the "shoot" area, but Sandorski manuevers the beacon lights so the
plane lands where they get the German agent coming off the plane before
Hiart does. He's a scientist named Lex, who is carrying secret documents
about the Atomic-bomb in a booby-trapped briefcase for a secret meeting
in London.</P>
<P>They decide to take him to London and have Randall's men follow him
there, but the police come to arrest Taine for murdering Reimann when
his body is found by a farmer's dog. Randall orders the police to not
interfere and the exciting climax takes place as the scientist meets the
German agent in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. Taine will be absolved of
the murder charges when they find the bullet from Hiart's rifle was the
reason for Hiart's death.</P>
<P>Herbert Lom steals the film with his odd Polish accent and his eccentric
behavior.</P>
