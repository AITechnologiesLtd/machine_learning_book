<P>They could have subtitled this one "As Nasty As They Wanna Be," this is a
film about evil, unrepentant and unchecked. Director Neil Labute's first
feature, shot for less than $50,000, effectively depicts misogyny and
cruelty without making the characters seem overdrawn-no small feat in an
era where Hollywood villains tend to be vaguely absurd caricature. But the
result, while effective, is far from pleasant to watch; the ending is as
troubling as that of any movie in recent memory.</P>
<P>The plot is simple enough, and Labute's minimalist style keeps the
proceedings mercifully free from distracting subplots. Chad and Howard
(Aaron Eckhart and Matt Malloy) have been assigned to a Midwestern branch
of their company for six weeks, and Chad, establishing that each has
lately been dumped by a girlfriend, proposes the following on the flight
there: that the two romance the same woman during their stay and then
abruptly dump her at the end of the six weeks. Why? "To restore some
dignity to our race." Because, as Chad envisions it, "she'll be reaching
for the sleeping pills within a week, and we'll laugh about this until we
are very old men." In short for the thrill of it. ("Let's hurt somebody.")
Moreover, Chad stipulates that it should be a lonely woman, "maybe
disfigured," the better to prey on her insecurities and make her fall all
the harder. Howard goes along, and Chad chooses a deaf typist named
Christine (Stacy Edwards) as the victim.</P>
<P>The three central characters are well realized. Eckhart's Chad combines
rage at the world for a variety of imagined slights with an oily
charm-which works so well because it doesn't seem oily. Myself, I
pigeonholed Chad as a fratboy gone bad, devoid of respect for anyone or
anything; never does the character convey that he particularly cares about
being liked, but the force of his self-assurance silences any potential
criticism. Howard is as weak as Chad is strong-whether cowed by his mother
over the phone or bullied by Chad (and the force of conformity that Chad
seems to represent) into his plans, Howard's capacity to stand up for
anything is minimal, and Malloy's stammer and nervous body language paint
the picture well. And though Christine has little to do besides be a
victim, Edwards gives her dignity; her insecurities, and increased
confidence over the course of film, come alive despite the limited part.
LaBute's style is best described as restrained: in many scenes, the camera
simply stays where it is and lets the dialogue run, all in one shot. There
are a few odd camera angles and sudden closeups, but the unremarkability
of most of the camerawork keeps the director out of the way-and, perhaps
more importantly, lends a documentary-style feel to the story, making the
events that much more real. Adding to that is the frigid cinematography:
the backdrops are airport lounges, executive conference rooms, hotel
rooms, places so familiar that no one could consider them distinctive or
foreign. The milieu feels depersonalized; the blank walls and bland
surroundings draw attention to the coldness of the main characters'
scheming.</P>
<P>Labute has called his film a "cinematic inkblot test," and it succeeds in
that respect on several levels: the viewer is forced to ponder to what
degree he or she shares traits with the two predators, or recognizes
friends and associates in them. More than that, though, Labute strives to
give the proceedings a comic element, and viewers who laugh may wonder
afterwards how they could have found humor in such a grim tale. (I
certainly heard plenty of laughter in the theater, much of it at moments
that made me cringe more than anything else--and I refuse to believe that
I was in a theater of sociopaths.) As in any good Rorschach test, the
viewer is left unsure at the end about what went on-how close to real life
do the interactions here come? Was Howard as guilty as Chad, or merely too
weak to resist?</P>
<P>It could be argued that "Men" is really about the corporate lifestyle and
the people it produces, and there is certainly that element. Chad uses his
power to humiliate a black office worker; one discussion of Chad's various
dislikes in the company instantly turns on the one who leaves the room ("I
hate that prick"); the antagonism among the main characters springs in
part from Howard's position of power in the firm. But the attitudes at
issue are hardly specific to the corporate scene; they are common about
all sorts, and the competitve sphere of the workplace brings them out
especially vividly. And Chad, for all his charm, is not truly the type to
climb the corporate ladder; such an ascent requires more fundamental
people skills than superficial bonhomie, and no one who spends time around
Chad could trust him or think his good will genuine. At bottom, the office
environment in "Men" is relevant because it creates a situation where
personalities clash, where different types are thrown together-and the
story tracks what happens when a strong persaonality takes hold of a weak
one. And it doesm't feel accurate to say that the men here are evil
incarnate, far from real life; the intent, I think, is more to show what
people are capacble of if suitably manipulated, and what locker-room
misogyny could become if allowed free rein.</P>
<P>There is much to appreciate about "Men": the dialogue is fresh and snappy,
and Chad's lines have enough bite to show that his is a character to be
feared as well as despised. His humor, in particular, leads me to suspect
that LaBute has been hanging around locker rooms taking notes-and the way
he pressures a reluctant Howard into going through with the plan is
classic high school bully. There are moments when the director appears to
be deliberately savaging Hollywood conventions, particularly those
involving romance, for instance when Chad goes saccharine: "I want our
relationship to blossom." Likewise, the sheer force of the ending catches
the viewer off guard-and makes the final few shots very nearly
stomach-turning. If there is such a thing as a horror film without
violence, this is it.</P>
<P>"Men," in sum, holds the grim fascination of a car accident: we know the
sight will be unpleasant, but we look anyway. Though far from enjoyable,
LaBute's first film is immensely thought-provoking. </P>

<P>The room is as you left it; your last touch--
A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself
As saintly--hallows now each simple thing,
Hallows and glorifies, and glows between
The dust's gray fingers, like a shielded light.</P>
