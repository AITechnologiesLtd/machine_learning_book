<PRE>Shadow of a Doubt (1943)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 66</PRE>
<P>"Shadow of a Doubt" is a suspense thriller directed by
Alfred Hitchcock.  The film stars Joseph Cotten as a bitter
man who has strangled several widows for their fortunes,
and Theresa Wright as his niece, who is unaware of his
crimes and worships him.  When Cotten pays an extended
visit to Wright's family, his curious behavior as well as 
visits from detectives lead Wright to realize that he
is a murderer, putting her own life in jeopardy.</P>
<P>"Shadow of a Doubt" is a good film despite many nagging
problems.  It benefits from an excellent cast and an
intelligent script.  Most of the problems arise from
character development and plot, and while each taken
separately are minor, they combine to keep the film from
being one of Hitchcock's best.</P>
<P>Detectives track Cotten to Wright's home.  They go to
much trouble and waste much time to obtain Cotten's photograph
on the pretext of a magazine article.  They want to
detain Cotten for questioning, but they don't want to
upset Wright's mother, so they wait until Wright can
convince Cotten to leave town.  These detectives are
the nicest and most inoffensive in screen history,
and I don't understand how a murderer's freedom of
movement is a secondary consideration to his sister's
temporary emotional state.</P>
<P>Hume Cronyn and Wright's father enjoy conversations
about the best ways that one could murder the other.
The film does need comic relief, but the droll British humor
doesn't cross over well to this side of the Atlantic.
Hitchcock didn't learn this lesson, as he would later
make an entire film with this style, "The Trouble With Harry."</P>
<P>Presumably, Cotten went to visit his sister to escape
detectives.  You would think he would keep a low profile
and remain pleasant, but instead he launches into diatribes
against wealthy widows and loudly suggests at the bank
that his brother-in-law is an embezzler.  He is also fond
of bragging of his wealth.</P>
<PRE>Spoiler alert!  You've been warned!</PRE>
<P>Eventually, Wright realizes that Cotten is guilty.  He
all but confesses to her.  Later, he makes two nearly
successful attempts at her life.  Still, she says nothing
about this to the detective, even though he is courting her.
She even agrees to get on the train with Cotten, where,
of course, he makes a third attempt on her life.  Despite
being half his size, she manages to outwrestle him 
on the train.</P>
<P>Since it is revealed in the opening scenes that Cotten
is guilty, the suspense comes from Wright's relationship
with him: will she discover his crimes, then, will he
succeed in killing her.  It is inconceivable that Wright
would not figure things out, and also inconceivable that
she would be murdered.  The suspense seems manufactured
in scenes such as Wright rushing to the library before
it closes, as if the library would not be open the next day.</P>
<P>One final, minor complaint.  Does every film have to have a
romance?  This is a movie about Cotten and Wright, and
a romance between Wright and a detective (who presumably
is many years older than her) seems an unnecessary addition.</P>
<P>Hitchcock is held to a high standard, and that is the
standard I judge his films by.  "Shadow of a Doubt" remains
a good and interesting film, but he has made many that
are better.</P>
