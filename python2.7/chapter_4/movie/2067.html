<P>     Andy (Steve Parlavecchio), Trevor (Patrick McGaw), and Billy
(Joseph Lindsey) have grown up together in the Long Island community of
Five Towns.  By their own admission, their friendship started almost
from birth.  However, relationships that were once strong begin to
fracture with the onset of adulthood.  A drug bust gone bad sends
Trevor to prison and he emerges a disillusioned man.  Billy becomes a
big-time hood using Andy as his gopher, a role that the somewhat-timid
twenty-three year old is desperate to escape from.</P>
<P>     AMONGST FRIENDS is another story about crime in America, but
instead of telling about the "have nots" of society, the film focuses
on three boys who come from wealthy, respectable families.  Bored and
satisfied with comfortable lives where all their conventional wants are
met, they crave something different and exciting.  Andy's grandfather,
who built his fortune as a bookie, and his gangster friends become
inspirations and role models.</P>
<P>     The three main characters couldn't be more different.  Trevor is a
dreamer and a romantic, a man to whom freedom and love mean more than
all the money in the world.  His feelings for Laura (Mira Sorvino,
daughter of GOODFELLAS actor Paul Sorvino) bring him back to Five Towns
following a lengthy absence, and it's his return that sets in motion
the events of this film.</P>
<P>     Billy is, plain and simple, a thoroughly unlikable bully.  In
fact, if there's an obvious flaw in any of the characters, it's that he
has absolutely no redeeming characteristics.  It's hard to see what
anyone else could possibly see in someone so completely despicable.</P>
<P>     Of the three, Andy is the most unsatisfied with life.  Each of his
friends has something while he's still striving for that one big score
that will fill the gaping void.  It isn't that he needs the money--he
can get that from his parents any time he wants it--but the cash is a
way of proving that he can hit the big time, even if it is gained
through drug deals.</P>
<P>     Solid performances by the lead actors, not to mention strong
support from a cast of equally-unfamiliar names, bring these people to
life.  Through the entire film, there's not a bad acting job to be
found, and a couple of the players excel.  Patrick McGaw is
superlative, as is Mira Sorvino, despite the limitations of the role.
Also worthy of note is Ms.  Sorvino's grandfather, Ford Sorvino, who
has a series of hilarious cameos that provide most of the film's scarce
comic relief.  Apparently, there's a lot of talent in that family.</P>
<P>     AMONGST FRIENDS never lets up.  Scene after scene flashes by,
often moving the plot along at dizzying speeds.  Movies less economic
with dialogue and story development might take an hour longer to tell
the same tale.  The transitions in AMONGST FRIENDS are frequently
abrupt, and writer/director Rob Weiss obviously doesn't believe in
wasting screen time.</P>
<P>     In fact, it could be argued that the film moves too fast,
especially at the beginning when it takes a while to sort out who the
individual characters are and exactly what they're up to.  The
voiceover narrative by Andy doesn't help much since there's too much
information to absorb in such a short time.</P>
<P>     This is one of those low-budget motion pictures (it cost only
$900,000 to make) that succeeds wildly because it takes chances.
Eschewing formulas is dangerous territory for a production team that
wants their product to hit it big; fortunately, there's still a market
for this kind of small, independently-made movie.  Apparently the big
distribution companies know something good when they see it, though,
because Weiss has recently signed a three picture deal with Universal.</P>
<P>     Don't look for easy answers in AMONGST FRIENDS, because you won't
find them.  In fact, the film doesn't really offer any solutions.  The
problems are obvious, as are the tragic consequences of certain
actions, but if Weiss has any answers, he doesn't share them with us.</P>
<P>     In the final analysis, AMONGST FRIENDS works not because it's an
expose of upscale, suburban violence and drug use, but because it takes
the time to develop its characters so that the events which swirl
around them involve us.  Emotional honesty is difficult for many films,
but this one attains it, and when something devastating happens on
screen, the reverberations shake the theater and the people sitting in
it.</P>
<P>     That's the kind of experience that AMONGST FRIENDS offers.  It's
not safe, comfortable, or lighthearted, nor is it completely original,
but it's definitely memorable.  With plenty of movies available
offering fluff, this is among the rare exceptions that don't pull
punches and always hit hard.</P>
