<PRE>MULHOLLAND DRIVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a cross between a slow-motion episode of "The
X Files" and a super long version of "Twin Peaks."  A baffling but always
intriguing failure, the movie gets more confusing, not less, as the story
unfolds.  Lynch won the director's prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival for
the film.  It would have been more appropriate if he had a gotten a dual award
-- a first for directing and a booby prize for writing.  Lynch can make the
simple act of walking down a small staircase ominous, but his script is full of
bewildering and unrealistic characters for whom we care nothing.</P>
<P>Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is a "golly-gee" kind of would-be starlet who has just
arrived in Los Angeles in order to make her fortune in the movies.  Upon
arrival, this innocent blonde goes to her new apartment, where she finds a
mysterious, dark-haired beauty who may or may not be named Rita (Laura Harring).
 Rita, who was recently in a car accident, isn't sure of much about herself,
including her own name.</P>
<P>A typically bizarre event at the apartment has a mysterious woman dressed in a
heavy black robe knocking on Betty's door.  Looking like someone from a gothic
novel, this stranger in the shadows warns Betty, "Someone is in trouble. 
Something bad is happening."  When she closes the door, Betty's only response
is, "Wow!"  Yours will probably be an equally simplistic, "Huh?"  You'll be
thinking that a lot during this movie, which needs a pictorial scorecard to keep
track of all of the quirky characters who make brief appearances.  One known
only as "The Cowboy," who acts like he's attempting Jedi mind tricks, is perhaps
the most bizarre character.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, across town director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is casting his new
movie.  A couple of strange Mafia types insist that, for the leading role, Adam
must choose their actress, Cammie Rhodes (Melissa George) -- no relation.  One
of these perplexing bad guys asks for an espresso and a napkin, which he uses to
slowly spit out the drink when it is not up to his demanding standards.</P>
<P>Almost every scene is full of foreboding, although the source of the danger is
never quite clear.  Frequently Lynch appears to have his camera dolly floating
on a gently undulating sea in order to enhance the audience's queasiness.  </P>
<P>Before the ending credits roll, there is a murder, some mistaken identities, a
puzzling small box, a couple of Lesbian love scenes and one confusing incident
after another.  "I'm going to trust you to sort this thing out," Coco (Ann
Miller) tells Betty at one point.  Good luck.  </P>
<P>MULHOLLAND DRIVE runs way too long at 2:26.  It is rated R for "violence,
language and some strong sexuality" and would be acceptable for older
teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, October 12, 2001.   In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas.</P>
