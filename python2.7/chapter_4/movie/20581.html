<PRE>AMERICAN BEAUTY (Dreamworks)
Directed by Sam Mendes</PRE>
<P>         There have been plenty of other movies about the shallow values
of suburbanites, but few have been as consistently -- and bitterly --
funny as "American Beauty," a fairly astonishing debut film from British
stage director Sam Mendes. In the same way Chinese director Ang Lee
found fresh perspectives on the 1970s in "The Ice Storm," Mendes takes a
commonplace setting and a familiar-looking cast of characters and twists
them into frightening, fascinating new forms, with a considerable amount
of assistance from screenwriter Alan Ball (another first-timer) and a
superb cast.</P>
<P> The premise of "Beauty" won't strike anyone as particularly
revolutionary, and, in fact, the film initially seems like it's going to
wind up as an updating of "Lolita," or worse, a send-up of the now-dusty
Amy Fisher scandal. Instead, it reveals its inspiration to be "Sunset
Boulevard," the seriocomic 1950 shocker about the quest to recapture
lost youth through an utterly futile love affair.</P>
<P> "Beauty" delights in confounding our expectations again and
again, letting us make assumptions and then shattering them moments
later. In the blissfully boring homes that line Robin Hood Trail, where
most of the action takes place, an innocuous bottle of root beer can
serve as an aphrodisiac, a plain white platter might turn out to be a
piece of china from the Third Reich and a once-reliable daddy might
suddenly decide to quit his job and devote his days to working out and
getting high.</P>
<P> That 42-year-old drop-out is Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), one
of those guys who probably gets misty-eyed when he sees those VW Bug
commercials with the tagline, "if you sold your soul in the '80s...".
"Both my wife and my daughter think I'm a gigantic loser," Lester notes
in his narration of the story, "and they're right." Carolyn Burnham
(Annette Bening) is an overzealous real estate agent who's so absorbed
in visions of commissions and "sold" signs she barely even notices her
husband, and teenage Janie (Thora Birch) has drifted away from the
family and settled in on her own perpetually overcast island of
adolescent angst. Conversations between the three are few, and the ones
that do develop are generally spiked with sarcasm. When Lester asks
Janie about her day in school, she dryly replies, "it was spectacular."</P>
<P> "I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble
Hell," Lester says, and it turns out most of his reveries involve
Janie's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), an aspiring model with a baby doll
face and a call girl's bravado. "I'm used to guys drooling over me," she
sighes, in a tone that suggests both weariness and delight.</P>
<P> Lester first sees Angela performing in a halftime show at a
high school basketball game. The number is atrocious (a smart bit of
spoofery on the part of choreographer Paula Abdul), but Lester is
transfixed by the girl nonetheless, and it's not long before he's
jogging and pumping iron regularly in an attempt to trim down his
slightly flabby physique. At the same time, the other members of the
Burnham household have found outside interests as well: Carolyn is
spending long lunch hours trying to wheedle sales secrets out of local
real estate king Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), while Janie has taken an
interest in the boy next door, a slightly menacing-looking kid named
Ricky (Wes Bentley) who keeps clean urine samples in his freezer just in
case his dad (Chris Cooper) wants to check him for drug use.</P>
<P> Ball's script will ultimately string all of these people
together, although not always in ways you might expect. In its probe of
what lies beneath the shiny surface of everday life, "Beauty" sometimes
recalls writer-director David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" or his
ground-breaking TV series "Twin Peaks." Although Mendes is not quite as
audacious a director as Lynch was in his heyday, the film is often
visually arresting, with dazzling use of colors (particularly red) and
motifs: Lester fantasizes about Angela bathing in rose petals, while the
increasingly shrewish Carolyn trots around in a blouse adorned with a
gaudy rose pattern.</P>
<P> In the underrated 1994 sleeper "The Ref," Spacey showed he has
no equal when it comes to spitting out acidic recriminations and Ball
gives him a choice selection of them here. Whether he's describing the
high point of his day -- hint: it takes place in the shower -- or
warning Janie "you'd better watch it, or you're going to turn into a
real bitch, just like your mother," Spacey consistently nails that
simmering rage that's been bubbling inside Lester for who knows how
long. It's a magnificent comic performance.</P>
<P>Although she's undeniably amusing, Bening's hypertense Carolyn
is slightly more problematic, sometimes careening close to caricature.
She's ultimately grounded by two offbeat and oddly poignant crying
scenes that show the woman's facade slipping and Carolyn literally
trying to slap it back into place. Birch, Bentley and especially the
wide-eyed Suvari all excel as they pull the strings of the adults around
them. Even the supporting actors stand out here, particularly Allison
Janney as a Stepford Wife whose batteries are running low and Cooper as
a martinet with a mercurial temper and some unexpected needs. James
