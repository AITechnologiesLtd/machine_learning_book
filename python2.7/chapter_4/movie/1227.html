<PRE>                             FRIED GREEN TOMATOES
                       A film review by Mark R. Leeper
                        Copyright 1992 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  Fannie Flagg's novel is really two
     stories told at the same time.  A modern Alabama woman finds
     her identity through a relationship with an older woman who
     tells her a story of Alabama in the 1930s.  However, neither
     story has time to be fully developed.  Rating: high +1 (-4 to
     +4).</PRE>
<P>     "Fried Green Tomatoes" is the name for two different recipes.  One
is a Southern dish I have never tried but it is reputedly delicious--it
looks a lot like fried eggplant.  It is also the name for a stew or
goulash made from pieces of old movies about the South, and politically
correct films about women learning to be independent.  It is sweetened
with little bits of comedy thrown in and there is a dash of bittersweet
tragedy.  The recipe apparently calls for two small storylines rather
than one big one.  This dish turns out to be palatable, even enjoyable,
though a little light for my taste.  Its flavor was just a little
over-familiar and it left me hungry for just a bit more.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a truck being dredged from an Alabama river in
the late 1930s.  We then flash forward to what may be the present or
what may be a decade or so back.  (We do eventually find out why the
truck is important, but it is questionable why we open with that scene.)
Evelyn and Ed Couch (played by Kathy Bates and Gailand Sartain) find
themselves passing through the little town of Whistle Stop on the way to
a nursing home to visit Ed's cantankerous aunt.  (The name "Couch" was
chosen, no doubt, because Evelyn and Ed are each a bit over-stuffed.)
At the nursing home Evelyn meets Ninny Threadgoode (played by Jessica
Tandy) and the two begin to talk.  Ninny tells Evelyn a story of the
past in Alabama.  On repeated visits that story becomes much longer and,
in fact, it is the main body of the film.  In flashback we see the story
of the life-long friendship of Idgie Threadgoode (played by Mary Stuart
Masterson) and Ruth Jamison (played by Mary-Louise Parker).  The story
develops as parallel plots.  One plot is that of Evelyn finding her own
identity and getting past her late-mid-life crisis.  The other is the
story of Idgie and Ruth, two liberated women who run the Whistle Stop
Cafe in the small Alabama town of Whistle Stop.  The story is nothing
greatly original.  Not too surprisingly, the issue of racism rears its
pointed, hooded head.  There is a murder subplot and a lot of human
drama in the story of the two close friends.  Meanwhile, Evelyn tries to
find herself through a "Total Womanhood" program, but finally finds
identity through Idgie's and Ruth's liberated example.  The film is a
sort of adult SONG OF THE SOUTH.</P>
<P>     Of course the film is not too adult.  In Fannie Flagg's original
novel, FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE, Idgie and Ruth
have a lesbian relationship.  In the screenplay by director Jon Avnet
and Fannie Flagg, the relationship is down-played and left as a matter
for speculation.  The real problem with the screenplay is that *too
much* must have been left out.  Spreading the film's 130 minutes between
two stories does not leave sufficient time to give either a satisfying
telling.  This was a light entertaining novel with humorous vignettes
lampooning the South, much as we would expect from comedian Flagg, but
also with some substance, particularly in the flashbacks.  The vignettes
in Evelyn's story just take too much time from what substance there
might have been in the flashback.  I rate FRIED GREEN TOMATOES a high +1
on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
