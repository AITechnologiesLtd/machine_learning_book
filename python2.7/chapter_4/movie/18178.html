<P>Bob the Happy Bastard's Quickie Review</P>
<PRE>THE CORRUPTOR</PRE>
<P>Chow Yun Fat continues his American invasion of sorts in the
action/drama flick The Corruptor.  This time, he's part of a squad of
cops in Chinatown that's been put on task to investigate a gang on the
rampage.  All's well until a new office in the squad, Mark Wahlberg,
stops in.</P>
<P>>From there, the story takes different directions, some more favored than
others.  How does one define a dirty cop?  Why is someone giving
Wahlberg some good tips on bad crimes in Chinatown?  And why is the same
Uncle Benny from Lethal Weapon 4 appearing in this film?!  Is he just a
popular Chinese villain or what?</P>
<P>Director James Foley does a credible job for keeping the pace, at least.
Some of the dialogue is kind of outta whack (I wished for closed
captioning in some parts of this movie- WHAT DID THAT GUY SAY?!), but
the action scenes are very well filmed.</P>
<P>Wahlberg holds his own with a performance that's a slight bit under what
he gave in last year's The Big Hit, but who cares?  It's Yun Fat's show,
and this actor truly delivers with some great lines, over the top
attitude and, of course, the ability to provide excellent gunplay.  The
guy's got more done here than he managed in The Replacement Killers, and
I'm sure his third movie will be even better.</P>
<P>The Corruptor's not a bad piece of work when it comes to cop films, and
it features  a terrific car chase scene where innocent people actually
play a part of, some of whom get slaughtered quite brutally.  At last,
no "get out of the way" ridiculousness, it looks hauntingly real.  I
only wish the story weighed in a little more, but, as is, there's plenty
to like here, particularly if you're a fan of Yun Fat's.</P>
