<P>"Tense, dark, gothic and poetic in its visual wizardry"</P>
<P>This film is certainly pleasant news for every horror
enthusiast. "Hannibal" is probably the most awaited film of this
decade, standing proudly in the same line with "Star Wars: Episode 1"
and "Lord of the Rings". Its financial success is therefore
assured. When it comes to its artistic values, it is very
speculative. You never know how the audiences are going to react, and
this film has already suffered from a discouraging abscesses of Jodie
Foster and basically all crew from its predecessor - the legendary
"Silence of the Lambs". I say legendary, because it has been elevated
to a cult-status, proclaimed a masterpiece by every critic (even by
those who did not approve it when it first aired in 1991). I always
believed that "Lambs" was slightly overrated. It was a great film, a
virtually perfect detective story, but absolutely no masterpiece. It
was simply a good film, nothing more and without Hopkins' legendary
performance, it would have been much less. With this hype blinding
your vision, it is hard to concentrate. Thomas Harris took his time
and when his book was finished, it was received not too well.
Jonathan Demme (the director), Ted Tally (screenwriter), Jodie Foster,
and Scott Glenn - all rejected the book, labeling it too violent and
grotesque.  Finally a new cast and crew were assembled, with Anthony
Hopkins in the lead.</P>
<P>10 years have passed and Clarice Starling is not what she used to be.
Crawford, her guiding mentor is gone and so is her purpose. After a
rather unsuccessful operation, she is humiliated and unfairly blamed
by the media and her colleagues. Meanwhile, Hannibal Lecter peacefully
lives his cultivated life as a respected art scholar in his beloved
Florence, very much aware of the awkward situation that Starling is
in. However his peaceful life is broken when Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi
(Giancarlo Giannini) discovers him and the reward, provided by one of
his old patients and his nemesis, the paralyzed Mason Verger (an
uncredited and unrecognizable Gary Oldman). Mason is an insanely rich
pedophile sadist, who lost his lips and one eye, when Dr. Lecter made
him peal off his own face and feed it to his dogs ("It seemed like a
good idea at the time", he chuckles). While Clarice inverstigates,
Mason is preparing his ultimate revenge, a feast where Lecter will be
eaten by giant man-eating hogs. Now everyone race against time and
each other, in order to capture the famous doctor first. But when
Hannibal finally appears in America, Clarice is split by her duty and
her strange affections for her evil opponent, who is likewise drawn
towards her..</P>
<P>Marquee screenwriters David Mamet (State and Main) and Steven Zailian
(Schindler's List) are faithful to the source, but avoiding the very
problems that made the book unsatisfying. Hannibal (as the most
interesting character) is moved into the center, while a harder, more
bitter Starling stands in the shadows. In fact, every positive element
of "Lambs" is elevated here. The "supporting villain" is far more
interesting and colorful than Buffolo-Bill, all the memorable
characters (including Barney) reappear and the political intrigues in
the FBI intensify.</P>
<P>Hopkins seems more at ease now, moving with a grace of a panther. He
doesn't speak - he purrs in a seductive, devilish voice. His Hannibal
is more interesting and edgy than ever before, a more complicated and
less sympathetic character than in "Lambs", revealing himself in all
his demonic monstrousity. Part of the films corrosive effect is the
incredible sympathy that we develop for him in the beginning, and that
so quickly turns agianst us, when we witness him enduldging to his
darker side.  Julianne Moore makes us forget about Jodie Foster
completely, playing in a tougher vein with her interpretation as solid
and honest as one could expect from an actress of her
caliber. Giannini's inspector has the right aura of tarnished dignity
and Gary Oldman is likewise spectacular and incredibly entertaining as
Mason. Ray Liolita is sleazy as always and the rest of the cast do a
decent job. Basically the acting is flawless.</P>
<P>"Hannibal"'s biggest problem is dealing with expectations, with people
who have already created a picture in their heads about how the film
should be - people who expect to see "Silence of the Lambs 2". These
people will be very disappointed, because "Hannibal" is luckily not
that. A new director is steering, with a new crew behind him. Since
Lector has now moved into the center of events, the atmosphere had to
be adjusted - in other words it had not to offend Lector's taste. That
is why Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) could not be a
better choice, and with director of photography John Mathison (Blade
Runner, Gladiator), the talented editor Pietro Scalia (Gladiator) and
sensational composer Hans Zimmer (The Thin Red Line, Gladiator) you
simply can not loose. The result is something completely
different. From the opening credits, when the word "Hannibal" is
written elegantly in blood across the black screen, you sense a change
of atmosphere. It's fresh, beautiful, dreamy -- all the things that
"Lambs" wasn't. And while its predecessor was very gritty, shot in a
naturalistic, almost photographic way, "Hannibal" sparkles with visual
splendor, looking like a beautifully decorated christmas tree. The
claustrophobic atmosphere of "Lambs" is replaced with a free,
unconstrained sense of freshness, like a morning breeze. The sense of
uneasiness is captured alternately by deep, sustained notes and the
rapid attack of a full-throttle orchestra, whose intent to horrify
never waivers. Scott has always been a wizard of visual imagery and he
employs his talents here, creating a world of Lecter's morbid
mind. Every frame is a painting, composed from rich contrasts of
shadows and light. He intoxicates us with this visual poetry and dark
symbolism, creating a creepy, gothic feeling around the whole
picture. And it is this style that is the very element that makes
"Hannibal" terrifying. We see Lecter lecturing the arts in the
library, swapped into the beauty of the night, we see him in perfume
shops, we watch him enjoying the opera. And then we see him killing
his pray, spilling out the intestates and cooking them at home, using
Dumas' recipes. Here lies the incredible horror of "Hannibal" - the
taste, culture, intellect and the morbid violence shown in the same
beautiful style, in the very same person. Scott succeeds where most
have failed -- in creating this extreme polarity of the human soul,
which is shown incredibly elegantly and without any sense of
effort. The violence is shown in a different key than we are usually
used to. It is as if we are looking with Lecter's eyes on the world
around us, and everthing is therefore wrapped into a magical veil of
taste and style, even the bodies.  This violence is more grotesque
than in "Lambs", but it is also more motivated, because it underlines
the movie's theme.</P>
<P>Several critics have pointed out that the first installment was more
clever and sophisticated. I slightly disagree with that statement. The
story development in "Lambs" was its clever part, with the many
bizarre events and characters, following one after another, but here
its cleverness stopped.  "Hannibal" is more clever in its theme,
rather than in the twists and turns of the story (which by the way are
quite remarkable as well). It is therefore darker, deeper and creepier
than "Lambs", going under the skin of the two main characters,
portraying their previously unknown sides.  "Hannibal" should
therefore not be viewed as a sequel, but instead accepted as a unique
and completely different movie, acting on its own terms. Clarise is
not the same honest, hard working idealist that she was in "Lambs". In
the very beginning we see her being betrayed by her fellow agents,
stabbed in the back, so to speak. These disappointments in her work,
and her life in general, lead her onto a different path. In the end it
is her fall from grace that is one of the central stories of the
movie. Lecter is likewise different - more relaxed, calmer and in his
natural environment. He no longer pushes for the extravagant, like in
"Lambs". His evil is hidden behind the mask of charm and taste, making
him more dangerous, unpredictable and calculating than ever
before. And this also underlines one major difference between the two
(now competing films) - while "Lambs" was completely straight,
"Hannibal" is more dreamy, elegant and symbolic in its every element,
in every scene. While Demme constructed a great story about nothing,
Scott is actually painting a picture about the duality of human
nature. This duality exists everywhere in his world, it can be found
in the beauty of Florence, in the darkness of the woods, in Lecter and
Starling.  The connection between them is magical and creepy, as well
as poetic. It is like beauty and the beast - the attraction of the
poles, the fascination of the opposite. Scott has thus successfully
created one of the most interesting psychological thrillers to
date. In a way, it is a beautiful walz about the ways of evil, with
its illusions, seductions and the incredible horror that lies
beneath. To me this is far more interesting than a carefully woven
detective story. This does not mean that "Hannibal" is entirely
flawless. It is episodic in the end, as if the director was rushing
towards the finish line. Forgetting that, it is a perfect
psychological thriller. However I do not intend to make the same
mistake as many did with "Lambs". I am not saying that this is a
masterpiece, but in my opinion, this is certainly a more interesting
and refreshing picture than its predecessor.  It is richer, creepier
and far more tasteful.</P>
