<PRE>                        FOR RICHER OR POORER 1998
                      A film review by Timothy Voon
                       Copyright 1998 Timothy Voon

<P>In this big mistake and excuse for a Tim Allen film, one can see him
silently tearing his inside out trying to be funny on screen. Any
comedian will tell you that trying to be funny means doesn't actually
mean trying to be funny. What made Tim Allen a success in HOME
IMPROVEMENT, was the fact that he played the regular husband, father and
tool man with a comic ease that came naturally. In the surroundings of
wife to banter with, boys to play with, best friend to tease and
neighbour to listen to, Tim Allen presents his best work. Take him out
of this environment and Allen falters poorly. He made an atrocious SANTA
CLAUSE, a terrible businessman/father in JUNGLE TO JUNGLE, and is no
better as a real estate developer FOR RICHER OR POORER. Maybe his claim
to fame, will also be his bane as he will forever be compared to and
labelled the TOOL MAN.</P>
<P>The story surrounds Brad and Caroline Sexton (Tim Allen and Kirsty
Alley), successful real estate developers. Beneath the exterior of
wealth and glamour, their perfect marriage is actually in shambles. To
make matters worse, their accountant has embezzled 5 million dollars,
leaving them to take the fall for the crime. With the RSI hot on their
heels, the Sextons are forced to take shelter in an Amish community. It
is here that they find love again.</P>
<P>It is here that Allen and Alley try to generate laughs by adopting Amish
customs and habits. Unfortunately, there is nothing much to laugh about.
Allen is mostly in the fields ploughing, whilst Alley learns to cook,
scrub floors and sew. Like regular farmers. Kirsty Alley is as usual
playing a whiney, naggy, difficult woman and Allen tries too hard to be
who he isn't – a tool man trying to be farmer. However, there is one
scene where Alley puts on an Amish floorshow that is quite entertaining.
Otherwise, the intended romance and chemistry between Allen and Alley
doesn't exist, and the ending comes as abruptly as saying ‘Amen' in the
middle of supper.</P>
<P>So the vows go, ‘For richer or poorer, for better or worse, in sickness
and in health, till death do us part.' So how can I sum up this movie?
Simply – 'For poorer, for worse, in sickness and death'.</P>
