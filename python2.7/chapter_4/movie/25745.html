Kings of Comedy</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>This Steve Harvey-hosted comedy concert flick props up D.L. Hughley, Cedric
the Entertainer and Bernie Mac on a Charlotte, NC stage. (BTW, It's directed
and produced by Spike Lee at Four Acres and a Mule.)</P>
<P>Shot on videotape, the image quality suffers (the center wide shot blurring
these comics faceless). Still as the humor heats up, it's easy to forget
about this technical shortcoming.</P>
<P>Director Spike Lee, on the up and up, cuts up these stand-up cut-ups nicely
with backstage and "just hangin'" shots of the quick to quip quartet.</P>
<P>The first half of the film coasts with no big laughs, but Cedric's
appearance on the stage steps up the pace and the funnies. Then Bernie Mac's
aggressive almost terrorist humor will be sure to get you rolling - unless
you're a PC person. Mac is so "in your face," perhaps when TV/Cable finally
overcomes their fear of him, he'll have his own show called "The Bernie Mac
Attack."</P>
<P>Oddly enough, the topical nature of these four occasionally overlaps.
Especially noticeable the subject of "old school music" vs. hip-hop rap
culture and the phenomenon regarding events in which white people die in
masses, but black people never do. Highlights include: Hughley's observation
on while white people are always looking for something exciting to do ...
black people find regular things exciting enough ... like "pulling out my
wallet without getting shot forty one times," Harvey's impersonation of
rappers, Cedric's re-write of "Redemption Song," And Mac's school bus ride.</P>
<P>Sex and cussing are repeated motifs. In fact, the film ends on Mac's "MF"
injected monologue (which by the way, isn't as funny as the school bus bit).
But despite the obscenities, a small segment on the "old tunes" being all
about "love" gives the entire piece an overall warm heart.</P>
