<PRE>                              Summer Film Reviews
                       A film review by Stephen J. Truog
                        Copyright 1994 Stephen J. Truog</PRE>
<P>     Well, since I see everyone else writing their reviews, I guess
I'll add my Midwestern perspective to the list since I saw an awful lot
of movies this summer (for me--at least).  So here are the summer
reviews (in more or less descending order) according to SJT:</P>
<P>SPEED (****+)
=============
     This movie surprised and awed me.  It surprised me because I am far
from Keanu Reaves's biggest fan and I usually detest the intellectual
level of action films.  However, it awed me because it was able to
overcome all of my preliminary judgements and thoroughly entertain me.
This was a movie that I was strapped into my seat to and could not move
or breathe until it was over.  It brilliantly strung together three
tense and gripping action sequences along with a decent story.  Dennis
Hopper plays one of the most memorable villains in the movies this year
with a roll full of hilarious one-liners and maniacal laughter.  The
humor is also spread throughout with Sandra Bullock and Reaves.  The
action scenes are magnified by tense and enthralling music as well.
All in all, one of the best action movies ever made and the year's best
entertainment.</P>
<P>THE LION KING (****+)
=====================
     Another Disney classic--far better than ALADDIN and even BEAUTY
AND THE BEAST.  The animation is incredible and the music is
spellbinding--but that's to be expected from Disney.  What makes this
movie better is that, unlike ALADDIN where one character's voice made
the movie, The Lion King provides a wide array of memorable and
captivating characters.  Kids can name at least seven or eight
characters in this flick where as in ALADDIN or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,
there were fewer.  The second thing is that this isn't a classic story
like the other Disney movies.  This is a relatively new tale and
educates about the circle of life--i.e., it is more realistic than the
fairy tales and is still every bit as entertaining.  A true classic.</P>
<P>THE CLIENT (****)
=================
     This is, by far, the closest and best adaptation of Grisham's
books.  The three main characters in this story are spectacular.  Susan
Sarandon should (but probably won't) receive an Oscar nomination for a
role that she played with passion and heart.  Tommy Lee was every bit
as entertaining as in the Fugitive, but the true star of this flick is
young Brad Renfro.  He is absolutely amazing as Mark Sway and it is
unbelievable that this is his acting debut.  The acting truly makes
this movie special.  The story is pretty good until the end, where
(like most Grisham books) the story wears thin because it simply can
not keep pace with the breakneck beginnings), but the characters save
it.  This is a rich adaptation with perfect casting.  Grisham beats
Clancy this year.</P>
<P>FORREST GUMP (****)
===================
     An outstanding movie with one flaw--it wears on a bit at the end.
The running sequence could have been cut by 5 minutes and still been
effective (when it got to the smiley face "Have a Nice Day" part, it
went too far--I gagged).  But overall, it is a wonderful recap of
America's transition from the idealistic 50's into the "me first"
90's.  Tom Hanks is good, but is overshadowed by Sinese as his
lieutenant--who should win an Oscar for supporting actor.  Again, great
music and a wonderful job of weaving in America's main events in the
declining road of history with the simple and innocent life of Forrest
Gump.  An original and brilliant movie.</P>
<P>THE MASK (****)
===============
     This was the second surprise of the summer (after SPEED) because,
while I admired Carrey's work from the early "In Living Color" days, I
found ACE VENTURA, PET DETECTIVE atrocious.  THE MASK, however, had a
much better story, music and supporting cast.  No, it will not win any
Oscars for acting or writing (but maybe for special effects), but it
will make you laugh.  The summer's funniest film.</P>
<P>IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (*** 1/2)
================================
     A sorta-true fairy tale comes to life in this magical and sweet
film.  It's not as mushy as SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and makes more
important points--such as you can simply enjoy a person's company as a
companion.  Nicholas Cage and Bridget Fonda are enchanting and match up
perfectly.  Rosie Perez is hilarious and wicked at the same time.  It's
too bad this film didn't do so well because it was a great one.</P>
<P>TRUE LIES (*** 1/2)
===================
     Another shock because I don't like Aaahnold much either.  He had
too many lines in this movie (i.e., more than one) and it took a major
detour for the middle third of the film, yet it still came out well.
The main reason: Tom Arnold.  He was the jester in this film but was
perfect as it--a true entertainer.  Roseanne who?  Jamie Lee Curtis also
provides Aaahnold with his toughest female counterpart--although she
doesn't hit full stride until the end.  Oh yes, the part where the gun
fell down the stairs and kills all hundred bad guys in the vicinity
made me gag--but I still liked this film.</P>
<P>CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (***)
==============================
     A disappointment.  This movie gets long, rambly and loses its
focus.  The ending is also a bit far fetched (I'm sure every top CIA
desk man goes right into the danger zone and slugs it out with the bad
guy).  The action pales in comparison to PATRIOT GAMES and,
unfortunately, so does the directing.  Tom Clancy's core is there, and
that along with Harrison Ford save most of this film, but the director
tore this apart and added long-winded and pointless dribble between the
basic skeleton of a story by Clancy.  Some fine moments, but there is
far too much in between.</P>
<P>I LOVE TROUBLE (*** or *--depending on end)<HR>     This was actually a decent thriller, that is until the end.  It
was quarky, offbeat and I liked it (maybe because I'm from Wisconsin),
but the zingers, old reporter rivalry and bizarre but suspenseful story
worked, that is until the end.  I say this because if you watch the
movie until they get the bad guys and the action ends, it's good!  *Run
for the exits* before the final scene.  However, the final scene between
Nolte and Roberts is so cheesy, corny, mushy, muky, gagging and
nautious that it leaves the the audience vomiting--so go see it and run
out before the ending.  Nolte is not very good (but I never think he or
Richard Gere are and am befuddled by their continued success)--but
Roberts is at her absolute best.  She is smart, sext and sassy--a witty
treat.</P>
<P>THE FLINTSTONES (** 1/2)
========================
     This film has remarkable scenery and it's cute how they fit our
modern contraptions (like a garbage disposal or airplane) into dino
times--but it lacks acting and plot.  Goodman is acceptable as Fred,
but midway through the movie, I wanted to take Bam Bam's club and whack
Barney (Rick Moranis) on the head and wipe that stupid looking grin or
smirk off his face!  Kyle McLaughlin is the sole exception, turning in a
devilish performance as the villain, but overall it was overhyped.</P>
<P>BLOWN AWAY (**)
===============
     This one was a dud.  So much potential wasted.  This movie started
out well, with a good storyline and some fine actors.  However, they
soon became lost in a series of explosions that continued to decrease
in point and effect.  By the end, it is just a hollow action flick with
a very letdown ending (he rips the head off the toy and the bomb just
goes silent??? Puhleeze!) and leaves the audience wondering--where did
this great start of a movie go???</P>
<PRE>OTHER QUICK BYTES:</PRE>
<P>CITY SLICKERS II (***)--Not as funny or well written as the original,
but Billy Crystal can still draw a laugh (unlike Eddie Murphy)</P>
<P>WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (*** 1/2)--A great movie and a superb acting
job by Meg Ryan.  If she doesn't get an Oscar nomination, then life's
not fair.</P>
<P>FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (****)--A delightful and original movie
that will have you in stitches and crying as well.  A treat!</P>
<PRE>Now for the first Fall classic:</PRE>
<P>QUIZ SHOW (****)--This movie started a bit slow for me, but when it
caught on, it was captivating.  Ralph Fiennes should have another Oscar
nomination coming his way and the film will also get nominated.
John Turturro is humorous as the former champ who takes the dive and
once you get by the annoying accent, Rob Morrow does a fine job as the
investigator.  Both may have supporting Oscar nominations.  Maybe it's
just that I'm a sucker for true stories on the screen, but I was
thoroughly enthralled by this film.  I did not carry as big of a
"America loses its innocence" or "WASPs are evil" theme out of it as a
sound message that TV is entertainment and business--all that matters
is money and pleasing people.  The last few lines of the movie are
haunting and leave you thinking with a chilling sense of skepticism.
Overall, a spectacular film.  Richly presented with an outstanding cast
and an important message.</P>
