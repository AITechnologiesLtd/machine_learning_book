<PRE>                                 SPARTACUS
                       A film review by Wayne Citrin
                        Copyright 1991 Wayne Citrin</PRE>
<P>     As most of you know by now, SPARTACUS is a three-and-a-half hour
restoration of a 1960 film directed by Stanley Kubrick.  It concerns one
Spartacus (Kirk Douglas), a gladiator-slave who leads a rebellion in the
ancient Rome of 72 BC.  There's romance (with Jean Simmons), and
friendship (with Tony "I also taught da classics to da children of my
mastuh" Curtis).  All this is played out against a backdrop of intrigue
between two powerful Romans, played by Laurence Olivier and Charles
Laughton.  Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, and Herbert Lom also play major
roles as powerful Romans.</P>
<P>     There are numerous problems with SPARTACUS, one of them moral, the
rest or them dramatic.  I'll get the moral one out of the way first.
Big Hollywood epics, it seems to me, are the Roman circuses of our time.
I felt very funny watching such an entertainment and, at the same time,
disapproving of those decadent Romans.  Perhaps the filmmakers actually
intended to put the viewer in such a dilemma.  Probably not.</P>
<P>     The dramatic flaws are more easily addressed.  There's nothing
really special about SPARTACUS.  As Stanley Kauffman put it in his New
Republic review, it's "Product."  This somehow isn't an accusation that
could be made about LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (the film with which this
restoration invites comparison).  The romance, the sentiments, and even
the grating background music, are all pure Hollywood, and the larger
scale doesn't seem to make things any better.  Even the big battle
scene, which could have benefited from the larger scale, is surprisingly
feeble.</P>
<P>     SPARTACUS has two giants in it: Olivier and Laughton.  But the
words that the script puts in their mouths are so small and trivial that
the actors shrink into insignificance.  Laughton fares slightly better,
due to his distinctive physiognomy, but Olivier is almost unrecognizable
(and the part could have been played by anyone).  Great actors really do
need to speak great words, especially great actors playing great Roman
patricians.</P>
<P>     In its defense, one can say that SPARTACUS moved quickly.  The
three and a half hours passed lightly, and I rarely felt that the action
dragged.  However, if Hollywood executives feel that the heritage of
Hollywood should be restored and brought to the attention of a new
generation of moviegoers, I wish they would spend the effort on
something not so overblown and yet banal as this film.</P>
<P>     What films would I rather see revived and restored?  Well, to test
an idea of mine, I went and rented a film last night.  It was also
directed by Stanley Kubrick.  It also stars Kirk Douglas.  It's about
half as long as SPARTACUS.  The film is called PATHS OF GLORY, and
watching it confirmed my feeling that it's the most perfect film ever
made.  At an hour and a half, it doesn't have a single unnecessary
scene, and it's full of perfect film moments.  Unfortunately, I know
many people who have never heard of the film.  MGM/UA would do the
public a great service by striking a new print and re-releasing it,
instead of forcing people to catch it on video or late-night TV.  One
PATHS OF GLORY would be worth three SPARTACUSes.</P>
