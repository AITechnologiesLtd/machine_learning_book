Lost & Found (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>a review by Christian Pyle</PRE>
<P>With "Lost & Found," David Spade steps onto the center of the stage.  In his
previous film work, he's either played second fiddle to another comic ("Black
Sheep," "Tommy Boy," "Senseless") or filled a supporting role ("PCU," "8 Heads
in a Duffel Bag").  So, "Lost & Found" is a test of Spade's mettle as a comic
actor; if he passes at all, it's barely.</P>
<P>"Lost & Found" is also Spade's debut as a romantic lead.  He plays Dylan
Ramsey, a restaurateur who's just broken up with his stripper girlfriend.  He
becomes smitten with his new neighbor, French cellist Lila Dubois (Sophie
Marceau).  In an attempt to trick Lila into spending time with him, Dylan
kidnaps her dog, Jack.  He plans to spend the day walking around the
neighborhood with Lila looking for Jack, then to "find" the dog and be her
hero.  The plan becomes complicated when Jack steals a diamond ring that Dylan
is holding for his best friend and business partner (Mitchell Whitfield).  So,
Jack has to remain "lost" until the ring reappears.  Enter Rene (Patrick
Bruel), Lila's rich ex-fiance, who's come to win her back.  . . . And hilarity
ensues.</P>
<P>The plot is (forgive the pun) doggedly predictable.  Boy meets girl, boy lies
to girl, girl falls for boy as boy tries to cover up lie, girl finds out about
the lie, boy is chastened, girl forgives boy.  A rigidly formulaic film like
this depends on its details--the gags, the characters--to work.  "Lost & Found"
is funny in spots; the trouble for Spade is that they're the wrong spots.  As a
charming romantic lead, he's a washout.  Spade is funniest when he's a
malicious elf.  His funniest scenes are ones where he is cruel, verbally and
physically, to others, particularly the dog.  (If Lila knew everything Dylan
did to Jack, we'd never get to "girl forgives boy").  But, the callousness that
makes him funny in the abusive scenes also works against him in scenes where
he's trying to be sweet and sensitive.</P>
<P>That conflict between cruelty and kindness pervades the movie.  The script is
funny but uneven; it has jokes which are very crude (some involving dogshit)
and others which are endearing.  People impressed by one sort of humor will
probably be put off by the other. None of the three screenwriters (James B.
Cook, Marc Meeks, and Spade) has had a screenwriting credit before.  They could
have used an experienced editor.</P>
<P>Just what is Sophie Marceau doing in this movie anyway?  She became known on
this side of the Atlantic playing the princess in "Braveheart."  Her upcoming
films include the new Bond movie ("The World Is Not Enough") and  Shakespeare's
"A Midsummer Night's Dream."  She has way too much class to be in this movie
(although it is fun to see her clowning around during the end credits).</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is a bizarre mix.  Artie Lange plays Wally, Dylan's
dimwitted sidekick.  Wally has the crudest of the crude scenes, and "Lost &
Found" would be much more pleasant to watch if he were edited out entirely. 
(Besides, the inclusion of the rotund Lange seems a vain attempt to replace
Spade's late partner, Chris Farley.)  Dylan's landlady (Estelle Harris of
"Seinfeld") plays poker with a group of lusty, beer-swilling broads (including
Rose Marie of "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and Marla Gibbs of "The Jeffersons"). 
Jon Lovitz has a cameo as a "dog whisperer," and Martin Sheen (whatever
happened to his career? or his dignity?) is the banker that Dylan has to
impress to get a loan for his restaurant.</P>
