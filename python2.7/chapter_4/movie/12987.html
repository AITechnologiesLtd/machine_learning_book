<PRE>The Flim Flam Man (1967)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: 65</PRE>
<P>"The Flim Flam Man" is a reasonably good comedy, with
many good scenes, but ultimately loses credibility
as a drama.  George C. Scott gives an effective performance,
and the script gives him several good lines.</P>
<P>"The Flim Flam Man" stars Scott as an aging con man.
He recruits young Michael Sarrazin, also wanted by
the law, as a shill.  The pair commit various amusing
cons, and soon the local sheriff (Harry Morgan) is after
them.  Meanwhile, Sarrazin gets a love interest in
Sue Lyon (you may recognize her from "Lolita").</P>
<P>The film's humor comes from the marks, typically greedy,
foolish yokels.  The dumbest of them all is Slim Pickens,
who gives a great cameo performance.  There is also a
wild car chase that wrecks a beautiful sports car.</P>
<P>The drama works less well.  It is impossible to see why
Lyon would fall in love with Sarrazin, who stole and
wrecked her car.  It is even more silly that Sarrazin
would want to turn himself in, having just committed
a slew of serious felonies, and then commit more to
get Scott out of jail.  The stereotype of rural Southerners,
especially Sheriffs and moonshiners, as dumb and
easily-manipulated yokels wears thin after a while
as well.  Sarrazin also becomes an expert con artist
the same day that he meets Scott.</P>
<P>Trivia: Scott was much younger than his character, and
had to wear much makeup to look older.  "The Flim Flam
Man" was Sarrazin's first theatrical film.</P>
