 Enemy at the Gate (2001). 2 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Jude Law,
Rachel Weisz, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, Ron Perlman and
Gabriel Marshall-Thomson. Written by Jean-Jacques Annaud and Alain
Godard. Directed by Annaud. Rated R..</P>
<P> Enemy at the Gates opens with scenes of stark brutality that try to
match the ferocious realism of Steven Spielbergís Saving Private Ryan.</P>
<P> In this scenario, a group of Soviet soldiers are being transported
across a river to take up arms in the defense of Stalingrad. Their boats
are attacked by Nazi aircraft. Ships are blown out of the water and
unarmed men, who are packed in like sardines, are machine gunned.</P>
<P> Those who jump overboard to escape the carnage are shot down by their
own officers.</P>
<P> Things get worse once the troops land. They are rushed into battle, but
only every other man gets a rifle. Facing overwhelming German odds, many
of those who survive the onslaught attempt to retreat and are ó again ó
mowed down by their own officers for cowardice.</P>
<P> This is the setting for an often compelling, but sometime frivolous,
World War II drama based on the real-life exploits of Vassili Zaitsev, a
celebrated Russian sniper who emerged as one of the heroes of the siege
of Stalingrad.</P>
<P> Enemy at the Gates, which was co-written by Alain Godard and
Jean-Jacques Annaud, who also directs, falls into the Hollywood trap of
foisting an unnecessary love triangle into a story that is compelling
enough to stand on its own.</P>
<P> The main focus of this drama is the war-within-a-war fought by Vassilli
and a German sharpshooter, Major Konig (Ed Harris), sent from Berlin for
the express purpose of stopping him.</P>
<P> Vassilli (Jude Law) is an unassuming rural lad who merely performs his
duty with extraordinary skill. But the Soviet propaganda machine óled by
Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) ó  use him as a rallying tool to boost morale.
The Soviet press publishes his daily kill count.</P>
<P> Where Enemy at the Gates excels is portraying the cat-and-mouse duel
between Vassilli and Konig, as each tries to learn about the other and
anticipate each others moves.</P>
<P> The rubble of Stalingrad serves as a broken chess board in which these
two marksmen play a deadly game of hide-and-seek.</P>
<P> This would be enough to sustain this wartime drama, but for some reason
a love interest is added in Tania (Rachel Weisz), one of the many women
soldiers fighting to save her city. She falls in love with Vassilli,
Danilov falls in love with her and their various passions fracture the
close friendship that has grown between Vassilli and Danilov.</P>
<P> Why this hokum is needed is beyond explanation. The story stands well
enough on its own. If anything, it degrades the heroics and sacrifices
displayed in the movie, merely using the war as a backdrop for a clichéd
situation that has been filmed thousands of times before.</P>
<P> Yet the Vassilli-Konig scenario is so strong, it even overshadows this
banal subplot.</P>
<P> As Vassilli, Law is quiet, self-effacing and modest. He does not
consider himself a hero, but a soldier doing his duty. This young
killing machine displays a boyish innocence.</P>
<P> Fiennes is pragmatic, ambitious and self-serving as Danilov, who wants
not only to help save Stalingrad, but help promote the Soviet message of
communism.</P>
<P> Harris is calculating as the German marksman. He shows a low-key warmth
and weariness that hides a deadly ruthlessness. He is a noble character
who admires his prey while continuing to hunt him.</P>
<P> Weisz, unfortunately, is pretty, but bland, and adds nothing to the
proceedings.</P>
<P> Worth noting is Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khrushchev, sent by Stalin to
oversee the cityís defense, and save it at any cost ó including
sacrificing every soldier under his command. Hoskinsí Khrushchev is a
raw combination of charm, maliciousness and savagery.</P>
<P> Enemy at the Gates is an interesting experience. How true to history it
is, of course, is questionable. But it would have been much improved if
the filmmakers had shown the courage of Vassilli and jettisoned the
familiar subplot and concentrated on the hunter and the hunted.</P>
