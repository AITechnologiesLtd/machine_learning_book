<PRE>                          DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Quentin Tarantino has made an interesting choice for his first
follow-up to PULP FICTION.  He's chosen to act in a supporting role, as
Johnny Destiny, a mystically supernatural creator of luck in this odd
film: DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Tarantino's talents are wasted here.  Instead, the
film focuses on the melodrama/comedy of the relationship between prison
escapee Julian (Dylan McDermott) and lounge singer Lucille (Nancy
Travis), plus their ex-partner in crime Thoreau (James LeGros), and
Lucille's new boyfriend Tuerto (James Belushi).</P>
<P>     Exactly what this film is about is difficult to describe because
the plot is minimal at best.  Basically, they are all in Las Vegas,
trying to change their lives for the better.  But for 100 or so minutes
the movie drones on and on about a bunch of characters we don't seem to
care about or particularly like.  Even the hero Julian is pretty
obnoxious and unlikeable.</P>
<P>     The acting is way over-the-top.  In an attempt to make this a hip,
ultra-cool "magical comedy," the result is simply pure nonsense.  Some
truly funny moments arise, but basically the film drones on and on
without getting anywhere.  Sure, it's unpredictable, but who cares?</P>
<P>     I expect Tarantino fans will rush out to see DESTINY in droves. 
Expect to be disappointed; it certainly isn't up to standard.</P>
