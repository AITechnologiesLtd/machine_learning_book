<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It is hard for me to believe that one of the world's greatest directors
and one of my favorites, Paul Cox (Lonely Hearts/My First Wife/Man of
Flowers/Cactus/A Woman's Tale), made a film that was so saintly that it
seemed to be without dramatic affect or chinks in its pious armor. This
is not a commercial film, nor one that tends to compromise its serious
tone in order to become more entertaining. It is a true story that tries
not to flinch from the suffering it presents and from the altruistic
virtues of the dedicated priest who is only interested in comforting
those shunned by society because of leprosy. It eschews the tricks of
filmmaking in its presentation of such a morbid subject, to its
detriment. There is no bend in this film. It is film about suffering and
about a Christ figure who gives up his life to help those who are
helpless, something the 59-year-old, Dutch-born, NYU Film School
graduate, and now Austrialian citizen, has become obsessively interested
in observing in his later films, as his first films were interested only
in the behavior of eccentrics and in quirky comedy. In this beautifully
shot film on the island of Kalaupapahe, catching the lushness of the
Hawaiian islands, Cox has taken the subject matter of suffering to a new
degree of intensity and requires the viewer to be either fully absorbed
in it or else it would be impossible to feel anything about such a
miserable topic as 19th century leprosy (Hansen's disease). There is
medicine for treating leprosy as of 1940, but the undeveloped countries
still can't afford that medicine, so the disease is still around.</P>
<P>To sit through this film, is like passing a qualifying test to join the
order Mother Theresa founded in Calcutta among the untouchables. It is a
dry, religious-inspirational film about someone who was recently
canonized, Father Damien (David Wenham). He is railing against wooden
villains, those authorities in the Catholic Church (such as Derek
Jacobi) and those politicians in the government (such as Sam Neil), who
not only refused to help but tried to block him from helping those in
need. He is a boring man who unquestionably believes in God, in
miracles, in piety, and in his own honest to goodness
self-righteousness. He's a good man, a noble and altruistic man, but one
we can't get to know as a human being, but see him only through the
cause he applies himself to. And as brilliant a study as this is, taking
on such a difficult subject, this brilliance fails to amount to anything
more than being a history lesson about Hawaii and about those banished
to die alone from that disease on an abandoned Hawaiian island called
Molokai.</P>
<P>All I really get to know about Father Damien that is of an intimate
nature is when I hear him in prayer before he first goes to the island
and he says to Christ, I begin my life at 33, Lord, and you died at 33.</P>
<P>This is the biopic of Father Damien, a Belgian missionary who voluntered
in 1872 to set up a church for the lepers of Molokai and who ended up
doing everything humanely possible to make life bearable for those
suffering from that disease.</P>
<P>He is warned by Bishop Maigret (Leo McKern), the one in charge of the
island's churchly matters who befriends him and sends him to the island,
and who tells him to not touch the lepers or else he will catch their
disease. Upon landing on this God forsaken island, he is touched by the
thousand lepers there of all ages who are in various degrees of
suffering, who are without beds, a hospital, proper food, medicine,
houses, or the most basic human means of existing. He is so touched by
this, that the first leper he sees, who is a child, he not only touches
but embraces.</P>
<P>Taking charge of the island, the priest teaches them to grow their own
crops and to live with dignity, as he fights the battle to get medical
facilities and lumber to build the houses, and most of all he wants nuns
to come to this quarantined island, where once you come to live, you
can't leave.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the storytelling remains flat despite the superb
character performance by the Australian David Wenham. In one scene, the
most dramatic one in the film, lepers are tossed off the boat docked on
the island's harbor and many of them drown. It is a scene of immense
cruelty, but seems to have happened as if it were a dream and not real,
as not much is made of it and the film just continues on without giving
pause to that event. The film just couldn't say more about the priest
except that he made conditions better, converted many to Catholicism,
and contacted the disease and died, relieved to know that the nuns have
come at last and that there is another priest to carry on the work.
These are fine accomplishments, but I'm afraid, they are not dramatic
enough to energize this film.</P>
<P>Peter O'Toole has a cameo as a glum English Protestant leper, who is in
the dying stages of the illness and is cynical of the priest's efforts
but nonetheless admires his tenacity. Sam Neill is saddled with the
stiff villainous role of the alcoholic and mean-spirited prime minister
of Hawaii and he can't do much with that role except stiffly act the
part of a prig. Derek Jacobi is the other arch villain, an assistant to
the bishop, who doesn't do much but try to make Father Damien look bad
so that the church will look upon him with suspicion, in a role that
doesn't make the best use of this very talented thespian. Kris
Kristofferson has an unimportant role as a Lutheran befriending the
priest and giving him sound advice, who is a merchant profiting from the
island but seems to be a fair-minded person who knows his limits and who
speaks in some indeciferable accent, which is probably German.</P>
<P>The film had a chance to mention that the diseases contacted by the
natives were brought to the island by the European settlers, but chooses
not to go down that road.</P>
<P>I felt anguished about all the piety I was seeing, but the film despite
all its obvious flaws lingered with me for a long time afterwards and
I'm not quite sure why. That is why I liked it better when the film had
a chance to sink in, than I did when first watching it. It's a tough
film to enjoy and I'm not sure I learned anything about suffering from
it, that is if I was supposed to, but I do think I saw someone who I
believe is an actual saint, and he was a spellbinding saintly figure
despite being so unapproachable. It was the very best thing I have to
say about a tedious film that I am glad I saw, even if I was not
entertained by it.</P>
