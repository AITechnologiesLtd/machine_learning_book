<P>   This is a movie about a romantic inter-racial relationship
that neither skirts the problems involved in such an affiliation
nor pretends that the black-white connection is the only issue
worth discussing.  "Save the Last Dance" is a film about two
people who like each other very much.  They're perhaps too
young to be in love (despite what Nat King Cole might tell us)
and who probably will not get together much after high school
graduation, but who make a impact on each other that will
remains with them for the rest of their lives.  In the story's
most telling piece of dialogue, a young white woman, Sara
Johnson (Julia Stiles) is sitting in a gruesome Chicago
emergency room with a black friend, Chenille Reynolds (Kerry
Washington) while impatiently awaiting medical attention for
Chenille's baby.  When Chenille warns that Sara does not
really fit into the world of African-Americans, Sara replies, "I
thought there was just one world."  "That's what you learned,"
replies Chenille caustically, "But we know different."</P>
<P>   While director Thomas Carter ("Metro," "Swing Kids") does
not portray the mostly African-American Chicago
neighborhood as the most desirable place to bring up a baby
or to go to school, the youngsters seem anything but
oppressed.  The ghetto high school is savored for the most
part by young people who are alive, vibrant, and involved in
the one class discussion that we witness (about Truman
Capote's "In Cold Blood" as taught by a hip black instructor
who is on his pupils' wave length).  While nothing in "Save
the Last Dance" could be called an innovation in the genre,
the film delivers a marvelous performance by the talented
Julia Stiles, who seems to be competing with Helen Hunt for
each year's most prolific actress.  </P>
<P>   Stiles performs here in the role of a talented woman
heavily involved in ballet, whose world crashes around her
when her mother dies in a highway accident.  She is
compelled to give up her spiffy suburban existence and move
into a mostly black neighborhood with her father, Roy (Terry
Kinney), who had abandoned the family some time back and
who ekes out a precarious living as a jazz trumpeter. 
Attending the local school, she meets a bright, seventeen-
year-old African-American student, Derek Reynolds (Sean
Patrick Thomas), who awaits word about his application to
Georgetown University and who has dreams of becoming a
pediatrician.  Each enters the other's milieu, although Sara
learns quite a bit more about the hip-hop generation than
Derek absorbs about the world of ballet and contemporary
dance.</P>
<P>   The scenes that will probably get the teens in the audience
giggling involve Derek's tutoring of Sara in the culture of
young blacks: how to sit, slouched over, legs wide; how to
shake your butt on the dance floor; how to deliver the
dozens.  Derek's lessons are supplemented by his sister
Chenille's advice to Sara on how to dress to avoid looking
"country."  Older members of the audience might wonder why
Sara would want to take on the unique polish of the African-
American since, after all, shouldn't one want to be herself as
the movie's tagline indicates?</P>
<P>   The film benefits mightily from the performance of Sean
Patrick Thomas as Derek.  His chemistry with Ms. Stiles is
palpable, convincing.  Side characters do not fare as well, as
Derek's friends Malakai (Fredro Starr), involved in drugs, 
Snookie (Vince Green), and the woman who envies and
dislikes Sara's incursions into her community, Nikki (Bianca
Lawson), are mere caricatures.  Nor are Peter E. Berger's
MTV-style editing of Stiles' dances conducive to more than a
headache, though presumably the fast cuts are necessary
since Stiles is not a professional dancer.  Overall, "Save the
Last Dance" profits from well-developed principals, an
vigorous sound track provided by Mark Isham, and a feel for
the grit and warmth alike of an otherwise impoverished
neighborhood.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 112 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
