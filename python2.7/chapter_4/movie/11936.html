City of Angels (PG-13) ** 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Brad Silberling directed the 1995 live-action version of Casper; Dana
Stevens wrote the 1994 Madeleine Stowe thriller Blink.  Both of those films
are competent entertainments, but it takes something more than mere
competence to successfully pull off a redo of Wim Wenders's 1988 German
classic Wings of Desire.  In translating Wings into the film known as City
of Angels, Silberling and Stevens have turned a fresh, unique cinematic
work into a standard-issue Hollywood romantic fantasy.</P>
<P>Although Wings told the story of Damiel, an angel who decides becomes
human after falling in love with trapeze artist Marion, Wenders was more
interested with the day-to-day work of these celestial beings.  His angels
were unseen, trenchcoated observers of the human race, wandering about,
listening to unsuspecting people's thoughts, but mostly just watching the
earth from above, below, and beyond.  These angels did not perform
miracles, become visible to people in need, or engage in any of the actions
that one typically associates with them; the angels simply watched and took
notes.</P>
<P>In the dismaying opening scene of City of Angels, it becomes clear that
Stevens and Silberling's vision is far more ordinary than Wenders's.  When
we first meet this version's Damiel, Seth (Nicolas Cage), he is on the
job--he's by the side of a dying child to lead her spirit into the great
beyond.  No more simple observation; in this City dwell Americanized angels
that act upon the human world, collect spirits, sometimes shape events, and
somehow make themselves visible to people dying or in despair, such as
surgeon Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan), City's Marion.  Seth falls in love with her
at first sight, and he is further drawn to her after she loses a patient on
the operating table.  One night, without any explanation (reasonable or
otherwise), the distraught Maggie is able to see Seth, and she falls
instantly in love.  All this _before_ Seth makes his big fall into
humanity's ranks.  Long live Hollywood.</P>
<P>Even though Stevens and Silberling maintain a few of Wenders's touches
(the black trenchcoats, the angels' library hangout, the cacophony of human
"thought voices") and touchstone lines (such as "I can't see you, but I
know you're there"), City eventually veers from the source material and
settles into familiar Tinseltown convention.  Observation and
thought-reading, which took up a lot of Wings's running time, falls by the
wayside in favor of a more prominent romance.  Not necessarily a bad move,
but Stevens inexplicably shoehorns the love story into the Meg Ryan
romantic comedy formula.  As usual, Ryan's character has a boring,
barely-exists-as-a-character boyfriend (Colm Feore) from whom the more
exciting love interest (in this case, Seth) must "rescue" her.  Shouldn't
the celestial divide between Seth and Maggie create enough dramatic tension
in itself?   Dennis Franz has the Peter Falk role as an angel-turned-human
(Franz doesn't play himself, however), but unlike the original, Franz's
heavenly past is explicitly spelled out rather than implied, and his
character becomes nothing more than a walking vessel of angelic exposition.</P>
<P>Cage and Ryan turn in admirable performances that are matched by the rest
of the cast, which includes an effective Andre Braugher playing the only
character to survive the translation with his name intact, Seth's angel pal
Cassiel.  But Cage and Ryan's chemistry, while not completely frigid, does
not ignite as it should, making the finale oddly lacking in emotional
punch.  But that is not quite as odd as the general direction of the film's
final act, which is entirely different from that of the original.  In
taking such a radical turn, City goes against the very spirit of its poetic
source material; the true magic and profound inspirational uplift of Wings
is sacrificed in favor of sap and weepy manipulation.  To be fair, on
stand-alone terms, City of Angels is watchable, but even from this
standpoint, it is still just a conventional and only moderately involving
love story wearing angel's wings.</P>
