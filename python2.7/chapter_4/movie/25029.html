<PRE>By SHANNON PATRICK SULLIVAN</PRE>
<P>At his best, Woody Allen's movies are a vehicle not just for amusing
social satire, but also for meaningful insight into our mundane lives.
When he's on his game, even the most seemingly inconsequential scenes
carry a weight and purpose of unseemly magnitude -- recall the lobster
incident from "Annie Hall" for example. But when Allen isn't in top form,
these seemingly inconsequential scenes are just... inconsequential. Sadly,
it is this latter category into which falls virtually the entirety of
"Small Time Crooks", Allen's thirtieth directorial outing. "Small Time
Crooks" is a trifle of a film, offering just enough classic Allen to leave
the viewer wondering how good a picture this could have been.</P>
<P>Ray Winkler is, you guessed it, a small time crook. He's never been
particularly successful at the job but has an inflated sense of his own
skills. During the two years he spent in jail for a failed heist, the
other inmates sarcastically nicknamed him "The Brain". Ray took it as a
compliment. Ray and his even dumber ex-con pals Denny (Michael Rapaport)
and Tommy (Tony Darrow) devise a plan to rob a bank, by renting a nearby
pizza parlor and tunneling from the basement straight into the vault. Soon
they embroil others in their scheme, including arsonist Benny (Jon
Lovitz), who used to be a fellow inmate of Ray's and has beaten him to
the punch by leasing the pizza place first (his original plan was to burn
it down -- he tells Ray he put his kids through college that way); Ray's
wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), a former exotic dancer who reluctantly
agrees to act as the front for the operation by selling cookies; and
Frenchy's dimwitted cousin May (Elaine May).</P>
<P>But nothing goes according to plan. Ray and his accomplices find
themselves digging into everything but the bank, while Frenchy's cookies
are an astounding success. In weeks, customers are lined up down the block
and camera crews are paying the store a visit. Frenchy's cookie business
grows into a multimillionaire dollar snack food empire, and the Winklers
are rich -- legitimately. But while Frenchy embraces her new social
status, Ray still prefers spending his time playing poker and watching old
gangster films. When Frenchy meets David (Hugh Grant), an ambitious art
dealer who promises to enrich her culturally-starved life, it may mean the
end of the Winklers' marriage.</P>
<P>"Small Time Crooks" starts well. The opening third of the film -- the 
abortive bank job and the initial success of Frenchy's cookie store -- 
boasts a number of very funny moments. Much of this is due to the
excellent ensemble cast Allen has assembled, who are obviously having a
lot of fun. Consider Rapaport's Denny, for instance, who is put in charge
of promotion for Frenchy's blossoming business. In one scene, he is
interviewed by a reporter who wants him to explain his thinking behind
placing advertisements for the cookies in magazines like "Playboy" and
"Hustler". In a perfect deadpan, Denny explains that if men are looking at
the pictures and salivating, and then turn the page to see an ad for
Frenchy's cookies, maybe they'll think it's the cookies that are
making them salivate, and then they'll want some.</P>
<P>Indeed, the entire sequence of the boys' misadventures as they try to dig
their tunnel is very witty, and the highlight of the film. But things go
off the rails after that. As "Small Time Crooks" shifts its focus to Ray
and Frenchy's social ascent and resulting marital strife, the laughs
become fewer and farther between. Much of the humor is obvious and stale,
like Ray's feeble attempts at small talk at a dinner party. To make
matters worse, the great supporting cast established during the first act
all but disappears, and Hugh Grant's David is just too dull and
transparent a character to make up for the loss.</P>
<P>Things pick up somewhat during the final half hour, but even this sequence 
-- as Ray tries to rob a priceless necklace with May's bumbling 
assistance -- is really just pure sitcom stuff. The big problem with 
"Small Time Crooks" (apart from the fact that outside of the first forty 
minutes, it just isn't very funny) is that there are no real surprises.
Sure, Allen throws in a couple of interesting plot twists and the opening 
set-up is rather dissembling, but thematically "Small Time Crooks" treads 
awfully familiar ground. Allen doesn't seem to have anything new to say
with his story of the Winklers' rapid climb up the social ladder. The 
characters' personal journeys and their ultimate mutual destination is 
obvious and predictable; the only mystery is exactly how they get there,
and it's a tepid one at best.</P>
<P>Allen's direction is typically competent, and occasionally inspired. 
There is one scene, for example, which subtly but effectively illustrates 
the difference in attitude between Ray and Frenchy once they've become 
rich. Having spent the night out pursuing separate activities, they both 
return to their apartment building at the same time. He's taken a cab; 
she, a limousine. But overall, "Small Time Crooks" is just too sedate and 
ordinary a story to give Allen much of a capacity for directorial flair.</P>
<P>Both leads give good performances, with the extroverted Ullman generally 
dominating over Allen. Indeed, Allen looks frankly worn out through much 
of the movie, though whether by accident or design I'm not entirely sure. 
I've already noted Rapaport's enjoyable performance. Also very good here 
is Lovitz, who manages to tone down his more annoying tendencies but is
sadly underutilised.</P>
<P>In the end, "Small Time Crooks" feels like a decent idea poorly executed. 
Neither as funny nor as observant as many Woody Allen films, it does not 
strike me as likely to appeal much to either his fans or the general 
moviegoing public. It has its moments, but ultimately "Small Time Crooks" 
is a small time movie.</P>
