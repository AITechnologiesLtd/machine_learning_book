<PRE>                                 ORLANDO
                       A film review by Max Hoffmann
                        Copyright 1993 Max Hoffmann</PRE>
<P>Seen: Sat 5/9/93, SF's Castro Theatre, SF Film Festival
Rating: 13 (yes!) (on a scale of 1->10)</P>
<P>     A Gift!  A transforming Experience!  "If there's only one film you
see this year...."  A must see.  Waiting for this one to come on video
instead of viewing it in Kine's temple might be justifiable grounds
for the death penalty!</P>
<P>     Director Sally Potter received the SF's film festival's first
bestowing of Satyajit Ray Lifetime achievement award (named after the
great Bengali filmmaker).  Potter has taken what many thought to be an
unfilmable work of Virginia Woolf, and created what is destined to be an
enduring classic, illuminated with the radiant presence of Tilda
Swinton (EDWARD II, CARVAGGIO) in the lead.  The film stretches the
envelope that defines our arbitrary definitions of masculinity and
femininity.  A perfect union of sound and image, the film boasts an
amazing soundtrack.  Potter has also made an additional gift to the
film world with the inclusion of a compelling, though brief,
performance by Quentin Crisp; a fitting cap to his wonderfully
chequered career.</P>
<P>     General distribution in North America coming soon.  The film
caused a major stir at both the Venice and Toronto film festivals.
(Currently showing on screens in the UK.)</P>
<P>     In her brief Q/A session after the film and award ceremony (my
quotes drawn to best of memory), Potter said she was drawn to this
story of eternal youth and immortality "because of the twin plagues of
AIDS and nuclear annihilation that we live under.  After losing so many
friends to AIDS and seeing the staggering loss of their voices, this
film had to be made."  Potter also affirmed her conviction "to create
the same spiritual insights and transformations with cinema that
masters like Mozart created with music."  Upon viewing this film, you
will agree that she has achieved that goal.  Before seeing this film,
you might be tempted to label Potter as a great "woman" film director.
With this work, she has shed the triviality of gender.  She is one of
the world's greated film directors.  Period.</P>
<P>     Sally Potter has reaffirmed my hope that we need not always look
to the past for enduring cinema.  That films as great as the German
silents of the 20s, as great as the works of Orson Welles are still
being created.</P>
<P>     In the rest of the review I quote directly from B. Ruby Rich's
program notes:</P>
<P>     "...ORLANDO is based upon the Virginia Woolf volume of the same
name and tells the picaresque tale of a young man who lives through
four centuries in rather unusual circumstances.  He progresses at first
in keeping with his upper-class origins, taking immortality in stride,
until one day he wakes up, magically transformed into a woman.  And so
it goes: s/he continues on from the Victorian age to the present,
exploring along the way questions of courtliness and beastliness, war
and peace, politics and property, past and future -- and gender.</P>
<P>     "ORLANDO's narrative progression is, if anything, post-modern.
Lush operatic music surges on the soundtrack, the camera sweeps us off
our feet, wry intertitles march us through history, and the
incandescent Tilda Swinton (EDWARD II) marches us through genders in
her embodiment of Orlando through the ages.  No wonder audiences love
it.  Potter admits to being influenced by Soviet cinema (ORLANDO's
cameraman Alexei Rodionov is Russian) and by Michael Powell (the great
British director who championed her cause in the years before his
death) but certainly Satyajit Ray could shine in her firmament of
influences as well, for he would have recognized the beauty created
here and the valor of its execution."</P>
