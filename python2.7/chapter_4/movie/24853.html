<P>   Paris, the City of Light, center of the world's romance, is no
fun at all if you're alone.  Few places can be more downright
depressing if you are not in the company of your significant
other.  Utilizing this motif in making only one film of more
than 47 minutes in length, Jean Vigo established a reputation
as one of the world's great directors with "L'Atalante,"
a poignant story of love's labor's lost for several dire hours in
the streets of Paris, a work which is considered by top critics
to be among the top hundred films of the twentieth century, a
classic of the genre.</P>
<P>   Whether the average guy on the street or even the more
prescient critic would agree is not as obvious as it may seem. 
The film uses techniques that are dated, even hackneyed
when looked at through the eyes of moviegoers sixty-six
years after its conception--which was just seven years after
the silver screen began to talk.  Even allowing for that, one
may well wonder what all the hysteria is about.</P>
<P>   Sure, the story can touch the lives and pierce the
heartstrings of most film buffs beyond the age of thirty, who--
if they had not spent their lives in the Lascaux caves or an
ashram in Benares--have loved and lost, terribly hurt by
relationships gone sour.  Doubtless these adults have fretted
for months, even years, in grief over the ruins of what have
been: "I said something wrong/Now I long for yesterday." 
How, though, to explain the critic Hal Hinson of the
Washington Post who wrote in 1990, "Rapt, exuberant and as
fragile as mist, this passionate tone poem drifts in its own
bubble of oddly dissonant, almost fatalistic romanticism." 
Hinson, a fine writer, seems more in love with his own muse
than with the alleged transcendence of "L'Atalante."</P>
<P>   The admittedly simple story, one which like the Greek
tragedies follows the unity of plot, is of two fragile people in
love and the strapping, yet worldly orangutan of a man whose
common sense and deeply imbedded soft spot help to bring
them together when they go astray.  Vigo opens on a
wedding party in the streets of a small French village, Boris
Kaufman panning his camera across a group of typically
insular peasants who either grumble that the newlyweds are
too cheap to follow their nuptials with a grand bouffe or that
the girl should have married a local instead of the captain of
a small river barge, L'Atalante."  The bride, Juliette (Dita
Parlo), has too many stars in her eyes to settle for small-town
life and thrills in anticipation of docking in Paris, a city she
has never seen.  Her groom, Jean (Jean Daste), does not
share her passion for urban beauty but is content enough
doing the routine chores on the boat--and even then, he
seems to accumulate a year's worth of laundry before putting
the clothes through the ringer.  With Juliette bored out of her
skull, the honeymoon seems over, as in fact the marriage
would have been were it not for the common sense of the
ship's roguish mate, Pere Jules (the wonderful Michel
Simon), whose love for a plethora of cats exceeds his regard
for the simple-minded cabin boy (Louis Lefevre).  As we
watch the crew together with its new guest going through
their daily chores in cramped quarters, we in the audience
cannot help asking the predictable question, "Are we there
yet?"</P>
<P>   When the ship finally docks in Paris, life changes for the
couple--for the worse.  As Juliette connects with a
vaudevillian peddler, brightening as he performs magic in a
tavern and then sweeps the bride into a dance, Jean fumes
enough to leave his mate behind and set sail without her.  As
the abandoned Juliette despairs, Jean has second thoughts. 
In the film's most ardent scenes, one blending lyricism and
the surreal with a preponderant gruff realism, the despondent
couple each try to manage the depression that overtakes
them once they realize how lost they are, alone in a hostile
or, at best, indifferent world.</P>
<P>   The film was mutilated by its producers, who cut the 89
minutes down to barely more than 60, arguing that a box
office demanding entertainment would not accept the grim
realities portrayed on the screen.  If the bean counters 
sought simply to maximum their profits, they would not be
entirely wrong for the mangling. The mainstream public in the
United States today would scarcely be more drawn to this
dreamlike fare which moves along at its own pace, more
intent on portraying ambience than on thrilling with a dramatic
story, the cinematic equivalent of a dreamy Debussy tone
poem rather than a stormy Beethoven symphony.  </P>
<P>   If we were intent on oversimplifying we could compress the
motif of the film to the contemporary aphorism, "Don't ask too
hard for what you want.  You may get it."  Juliette is of the
spirits.  Ground down by the tedium of town life and the
monotony of gliding in a battered barge, she longs for the
excitement of Paris.  She finds it only to realize that without
the embrace of her man, the city offers nothing but
ephemeral temptations and adorned corruption.  Jean, who is
by contrast too bound to his daily routine, discovers that
without the transcendence that only his lover can provide, life
is meaningless at best, and downright painful--manifest in the
movie's most erotic scene that display both Jean and Juliette
tossing in their lonely beds during one aching night of
separation.</P>
<P>   Vigo has created a dreamworld which may well have been
innovative--but only for its time.  He has encouraged us in the
audience to look inside our hearts to determine what really
matters.  Surely "L'Atalante" does not perform these
praiseworthy designs in a unique manner, so that one
wonders exactly why this meritorious enough film is lauded by
so many critics above virtually all others of the genre.</P>
