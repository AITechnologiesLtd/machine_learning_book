<PRE>Three Kings (1999, R)</PRE>
<P>Written and Directed by David O. Russell</P>
<PRE>Story by John Ridley</PRE>
<P>Starring George Clooney, Mark Whalberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonez, and Nora Dunn</P>
<PRE>As Reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>Twenty years, one month, and sixteen days before Three Kings was released,
Apocalypse Now sprang onto the war movie landscape, quickly jumping into the
upper echelon of a highly critically appreciated genre.  Now, Three Kings hits
screens, with a similar destiny.</P>
<P>Before anyone objects to the comparison, let me say that it is more by nature
of style than by substance.  This is not to say that Three Kings lacks in
substance to any degree: it doesn't.  This is merely to say that Three Kings
exhibits the same sardonic wit, noirish cinematography, and eclectic
soundtrack that served to provide an ironic twist to the Vietnam War in
Apocalypse Now.</P>
<P>The comparison does not end there, however.  In Apocalypse Now, we are greeted
with a single man on a completely amoral mission.  In Three Kings, it is four
people.  In Apocalypse Now, we have the eventual growth of morals and regret
out of a war that seemed to serve no purpose.  In Three Kings, we have the
same.</P>
<P>Three Kings IS the Apocalypse Now of the 1990's.</P>
<P>Hands down the finest war movie I have seen since Saving Private Ryan, Three
Kings is a disturbing masterpiece.  While taking a look at the soldier's who
have never seen action, who have never taken life, and their desire to blindly
do so, it also realizes the careful contemplation given to the line between
life and death, between killing and not pulling the trigger, once that line
has already been crossed.</P>
<P>The movie concerns four dissatisfied soldiers who discover a map to the
bunkers where gold bullion stolen from Kuwait lies.  As they find the map,
they make a frenzied attempt to get the gold while trying to shake front-line
reporter Amanda Cruz (Nora Dunn) from their tail.</P>
<P>The gold is hidden in the midst of a heavily guarded desert village, where a
rebellion is being quashed as they speak.  Since the Americans have signed a
cease-fire with Iraq, it is expected that the Americans will merely do nothing
as Iraqi civilians get slaughtered.</P>
<P>For the most part, as a country, this is what we did.  However, Vietnam vet
Archie Gates (Clooney) makes the decision to not allow the Iraqis to have free
reign.  From there on it, the film becomes a highly contemplative (and
action-packed) commentary on where morals should and do lie in war.</P>
<P>Congratulations should go to about everyone on the film.  Mark Whalberg
exhibits the same kind of brilliant acting as he did in Boogie Nights. 
Clooney proves that Out of Sight was not just a fluke and that he actually
does have acting gumption.  Ice Cube tackles a serious role remarkably well
considering that the last movie he acted in was I Got the Hook Up.  However
the real star lies in the role of Conrag Vig (Spike Jonze), hick to the bone
that finds that he actually has morals out in the desert.  Normally, whenever
you see a completely ignorant character on-screen, you hate them.  But, Spike
Jonze (in his first major role) somehow manages to turn it in an endearing
quality.  Also, cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, who also did The Usual
Suspects, provides some of the most disturbing imagery captured on film in
recent years (up to par with last year's The Thin Red Line).</P>
<P>Three Kings IS, as said, the Apocalypse Now of the 1990s.  It is the finest
ironically-comedic war film of this decade and the second finest war film of
this decade (Saving Private Ryan being the first).  I don't care if you see at
New York City's Sony Theatre, where it costs $9 for a matinee.  It's worth
every penny you spend on it.</P>
