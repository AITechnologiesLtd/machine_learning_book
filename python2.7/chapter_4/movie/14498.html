<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>Imagine this:  you're walking down a really dark hallway.  It's so dark
that you can't see anything -- not even the walls, not even your hands! 
(The only thing illuminated is your face.)  You're looking around
slowly, plodding through the darkness, scared of something that may or
may not be there.  Suddenly, a half-second crack of extremely loud
guitar music radiates from a six-foot stack of speakers right next to
you.  Would you be scared?  I sure would be.  I'd fall to the floor,
convulsing, perhaps even weeping, and I doubt that I'd ever recover from
the incident.</P>
<P>In real life, this would be frightening.  But in a horror movie, the
formula doesn't work quite the same way.  For instance, the scene
described above is a common one in Urban Legend, with each segment
ending in that ultra-loud burst of music.  When we see people walking
through dark hallways, we know that they're probably just going to have
the stuffing scared out of them.  On occasion, he or she might get
gutted by some maniac, but, typically, scenes like this are false
alarms. </P>
<P>Urban Legend is wholesale false alarms, none of which are particularly
alarming.  Ever since Scream came out in 1996, the studios have been
rushing to bring out their own teen horror flicks.  They range from the
watchable (I Know What you Did Last Summer) to the silly (Disturbing
Behavior), but I have yet to see one that does everything right.  Urban
Legend is perhaps sillier than all of them, sporting a kinda-cool
gimmick/plot.  It's watchable badness, with some decent moments of
suspense and good acting.  But I wonder if the director, Jamie Blanks,
had any idea that the film is inherently and completely ridiculous.  </P>
<P>Like most of these new-wave Teen Horror Flicks, Urban Legend has a
gimmick in place of a story.  The gimmick is that the killer murders
people based on urban legends.  Urban legends are those stories that
everyone knows and thinks are true, but really hold no truth
whatsoever.  I sat in quiet astonishment as the fable of Mikey, the Life
Cereal kid, is discussed on screen.  I heard that story probably twelve
years ago (when I was just a tyke), and in all this time I've never
heard anything that proved the tale true or false.  It's slightly
amusing the way Urban Legend uses this group of famous stories to create
a sequence of interesting set-pieces.  Strictly as a formality, the film
has a main character:  her name is Natalie (Alicia Witt).  She's a
college student, and -- just as our young heroines in all of the other
Teen Horror Flicks -- she's the girl the killer wants to abuse
emotionally.</P>
<P>This film is profoundly silly, but there's stuff I liked about it. 
First, there's Alicia Witt.  She's a great actress (very Witty), and,
when given the right material, extremely funny (remember her on
"Cybil?").  The script for this film, which was written by Silvio Horta,
doesn't give her much of a character to work with, but she's fun to
watch anyway.  Also fun is Rebecca Gayheart (Noxema girl!); she overacts
on a nuclear-meltdown level, but I think she's aware of it.  In
addition, the film features John Neville (as the evil Dean) and Robert
Englund (for a guy so well-known, you'd think he'd make a good movie
every once in a while).  There are lots of actors in this film, but no
characters -- that tends to be a problem when we're trying to manifest
sympathy for the figures on screen getting all hacked up.</P>
<P>Blanks has a good visual style, and the film is competent in its
execution.  There are a few really nicely-done scenes, including a
gore-fest that has something to do with a dog in a microwave; the
opening scene (which features an uncredited Brad Dourif in a role not
unlike his first in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) is spectacular and
beautifully ironic.  There are some good camera angles, and Blanks
injects enough atmosphere to keep the film from being dry and
uninspired.  It's just too bad that the film is overflowing with cliches
and scenes that end with loud bursts of music.  </P>
<P>Even for a horror film, there are necessary elements missing.  It isn't
very scary -- it relies a little too heavily on gore and gratuitous
violence (some of it is simply unpleasant).  What makes films like this
really scary is a believable explanation for everything.  That's where
Urban Legend really loses it -- the final fifteen minutes of the film
are laughably absurd (I'm not exaggerating -- I was laughing).  Did
Blanks know how silly all of this stuff is?  Perhaps.  It would have
been nice if the urban legend gimmick had been put to better use, but
I'm more concerned with the numerous scenes that rely on that crack of
loud music to scare the audience.  It's so hard to scare us when we know
it's coming anyway.</P>
