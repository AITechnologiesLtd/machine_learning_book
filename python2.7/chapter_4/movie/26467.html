<PRE>BAIT</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Antoine Fuqua
Written by: Andrew Scheinman, Adam Scheinman, Tony Gilroy</P>
<P>Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a small time crook who was just caught for 
trying to steal a bag full of shrimp (sorry, prawns). Two crooks, John 
Jaster (Robert Pastorelli) and Bristol (Doug Hutchison), just stole 42 
million dollars in gold at the exact time Alvin was stealing his 
crustaceans. Jaster double-crosses Bristol when he finds out what a 
psychopath Bristol is, and then winds up in the slammer with Sanders. Jaster 
has a weak heart though, and just before dying of a massive coronary, he 
tells Sanders something about the gold being at The Bronx Zoo and there's no 
place like home. The US treasury department, led by Agent Edgar Clenteen 
(David Morse), is trying to track down Bristol and they decide to use 
Sanders as bait. They implant a tracking device in his jaw, and make it 
known on the streets that he knows where the gold is. Now they just have to 
wait for Bristol to try and contact Sanders. The only thing they didn't 
count on was Sanders trying to go straight so he can be with his old 
girlfriend, Lisa (Kimberly Elise) and his newly discovered son. Now Bristol 
is chasing Alvin, the government is chasing Alvin, and the only person who 
doesn't know what's going on is Alvin.</P>
<P>Like "Bless the Child", from earlier this year, "Bait" is the sort of movie 
that will start to leave your mind about an hour after seeing it. In three 
or four hours you'll most likely have forgotten the movie entirely. This 
isn't because "Bait" is a bad movie (though it certainly isn't a good one 
either), it's just a mishmash of harmless fluff that we've all seen before. 
Okay, fine, so we've seen it all before, but what you really want to know is 
if it's entertaining, right? Well, it has its moments, few and far between 
as they may be. Jamie Foxx ("Any Given Sunday") carries the movie with his 
no inconsiderable comic talent, but the film's biggest problems lie with its 
writers. Andrew ("North") and Adam Scheinman ("Mickey Blue Eyes") don't seem 
to know what kind of a movie they're trying to create. "Bait" goes from 
goofy, slap-stick humor when Jamie Foxx is on screen, to almost disturbing 
seriousness when Doug Hutchison ("The Green Mile") is on screen. Is "Bait" 
an action film? Not exactly. Is it a comedy? Not really. Is it a brilliant 
mix of the two like James Cameron's "True Lies"? Not by a long shot.</P>
<P>I remember seeing Jamie Foxx back on the Wayans brothers series, "In Living 
Color". At the time I couldn't understand why he didn't get more attention 
as a comic actor. Now that he has it, the only thing I can't figure out is 
why he doesn't get better roles. Do you remember "Held Up", from earlier 
this year? Of course you don't, it was in and out of theaters in about two 
weeks. It's likely "Bait" will share the same fate. Foxx's performance in 
"Bait" does have its funny moments, but I'm sure some of his better comic 
scenes were marred by the fact that I couldn't understand what he was 
saying. The man seems to have a mouth full of marbles in this movie. David 
Morse ("The Green Mile"), who I've always liked, turns in one of his lesser 
performances as the treasury agent, Edgar. It's not entirely his fault, he 
does get some pretty lousy dialogue, but he also shamelessly overacts for 
the entire first half of the film. I'm not sure why he suddenly throws it 
into neutral for the last half, but it was a welcome change. Last and least 
we have Doug Hutchison. I didn't like Hutchison as the the little weasel, 
Percy in "The Green Mile", and I liked him even less as the slimy Bristol in 
"Bait". There's just something aggravating about his acting style. As long 
as he keeps it tightly reigned in he's tolerable, even a little creepy. Yet 
the moment he starts to act angry he becomes laughably bad.</P>
<P>I suppose if you're one of those people who can't get enough of tacked on 
car chases and explosions you'll find "Bait" to be entertaining enough. If 
(like me) you're someone who wants a little more from your movies, you'll be 
disappointed time and again. This is quite a shame because the movie does 
have a few points in its favor other than the star. Director Antoine Fuqua 
("The Replacement Killers") does an excellent job with the film's dreary 
script. He keeps the story moving along nicely, and uses some really 
interesting techniques. There's a scene where a man is tied to a chair, 
surrounded by a massive bomb. If anyone opens the door it will explode, and 
the police are about to smash the door in. Sounds more than a little 
cliched, right? Normally it would be, but Fuqua films it in such an 
interesting way that you'll probably forget you've seen the situation a 
hundred times before. He effectively uses slow motion in this and several 
other scenes, and he utilizes some wonderful cinematography by Tobias 
Schliessler ("Candyman II"). Schliessler uses broad, panning shots of New 
York City combined with some excellent over-head shots of the city at night. 
Fuqua only drops the ball once or twice when he succumbs to Oliver Stone 
syndrome and breaks away from monologues to lighting flashing through the 
sky for no apparent reason.</P>
<P>It's a shame a good star, a good director, and a promising cinematographer 
are wasted on this script. A part of me really wanted to like "Bait", but 
the fact that I'd seen it all before combined with a few bad performances, 
yet another rap soundtrack (I'm so tired of those I can't see straight), and 
a climax which destroys all the film's credibility kept me from really 
enjoying it. Speaking of the soundtrack, that was one of the biggest 
disappointments. I'm not entirely sure why Fuqua decided to set it up like 
this, but half the film contains rap music, and the other half (like in that 
scene I mentioned earlier) contains some really nice instrumental music by 
Mark Mancina ("Con Air"). Why did Fuqua keep switching back in forth? All I 
can figure is he was trying to cater to both groups (those who like Rap and 
those who like purely instrumental), but I think all he really succeeded in 
doing was irritating both sides by not being able to decide on one tone. The 
last point going against "Bait" is the running time. You're average film of 
this genre is going to run about an hour and a half, maybe 100 minutes. 
"Bait", for some bizarre reason, runs 119 minutes. I don't know what the 
film's editor, Alan Edward Bell (what a surprise, he also edited the 
horrible "The Story of Us") was thinking, but I could have cut at least a 
half hour out of this film. I'd recommend "Bait" to fans of typical, cliched 
Hollywood fare (there are a lot of these people out there) and give it three 
out of five stars.</P>
