<P>The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film version of Stephen King's
novel, received a highly mixed reaction from audiences when originally
released. Some King fans, and the author himself, felt that Kubrick had
left out many important details and created a simplistic version that
paled in comparison to the novel. Other viewers accepted the film as
what it was: a skillful, atmospheric and effective horror masterpiece
that provided an impressive helping of white-knuckle scares.</P>
<P>I've never read King's novel, and perhaps that's a good thing. The movie
I saw was amazing. Kubrick gave the Overlook Hotel, the film's desolate
setting, a personality of it's own. From the sweeping hallways and
checkered interior to the mysterious hedge maze outside the front doors,
the Overlook was the place nightmares were made of. Not a structure out
of The Haunting, which went straight for a frightening, gothic appeal.
The hotel in The Shining is scary because of it's hidden evil, one that
wasn't directly expressed on screen - and this creepy atmosphere is the
primary reason why Kubrick succeeds.</P>
<P>Jack Nicholson coins many famous phrases here, among them the widely
used `Here's Johnny!' and the endless typed pages of `All work and no
play make Jack a dull boy'.
Nicholson plays Jack Torrence, a writer who applies for the job of fall
caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. For this six month period, along with
his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd), Torrence is
given the task of being the fall caretaker. Although warned that the
hotel could gradually give him a severe case of cabin fever, Jack sees
it as an opportunity to get some writing done.</P>
<P>But the real story here lies within young Danny, who has the ability to
`shine'. This is a power not unlike ESP, and it's shared by the janitor
at the Overlook (Scatman Crothers). Danny sees frightening images in his
mind of the hotel hallways filling with blood, and of two young girls
beckoning for him to come `play with them'. It's afterward that we find
out that a former caretaker at the Overlook went psychotic after many
months of desolation, killing his wife and two little girls with an axe.
Surely enough, Jack's mind begins to give in to a murderous case of
cabin fever, and he goes after Wendy and Danny with a rather unpleasant
intent.</P>
<P>Essentially, atmosphere is why The Shining succeeds as well as it does.
The atmospheric, goosebump-inducing surroundings of the Overlook Hotel
help to overshadow a few major fundamental flaws in the plot. One is
Duvall's character, which is often one-dimensional. Her emotions lead
her straight from a loving housewife to a woman distraught and running
in fear, when there should be a definite transition in-between.
(WARNING-Spoilers ahead). Another is the use of the Scatman Crothers'
character. The poor guy senses that something is wrong, travels hundreds
of miles via various transports, and then fights through a nasty
blizzard to get up to the Hotel. As soon as he enters, he gets an axe in
the chest. I've heard this is one of the complaints that Stephen King
fans had about Kubrick's version, noting that the character was used to
a much bigger (and more important) extent in the novel. King, in fact,
made his own mini-series in 1997 with Steven Weber in the title role.</P>
<P>Kubrick does many things right here, too. The use of camera angles is
stunning and effective, from the opening helicopter shot to Danny's
ventures through the winding hallways on his pedal bike. There is genius
at work behind the lighting, which is perfectly fixated with light and
dark tones in certain scenes. And Nicholson submits a chilling, eerie
portrait of a man who's lost his bearings so badly that he resorts to
stalking his own family with an axe. The final chase through the hedge
maze is absolutely thrilling, perfectly realized at every twist and
turn.</P>
<P>The Shining is a movie not devoid of flaws, but it's still an expertly
crafted exercise in fear.</P>
