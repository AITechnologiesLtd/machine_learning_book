<P>     I went back for a second look at TWISTER and I wish I could report
better things.  The FX are still a gas.  Flying tractors, rolling homes,
and disintegrating barns; it's all there.  Director Jan De Bont, along
with Industrial Light and Magic, has effectively realized one of
nature's most primal forces and I'm not talking about Jesse Helms.  The
effects-related thrills are so complete-- so edge-of-your-seat
jaw-dropping-- that many may find themselves physically exhausted by the
end.  In that regard, TWISTER *works*.  It excites, therefore it is.  On
a second viewing, though, the movie becomes more of a bore.  The obvious
problem-- beyond the missing momentum, overscored music, and shameless
product plugs-- is the script.  As written, TWISTER rests somewhere
between the very bad and the very corny; somewhere between, say,
SHOWGIRLS and MR. HOLLAND'S ANUS.  (I'd call Richard Dreyfuss's Oscar
nomination a special effect, wouldn't you?)</P>
<P>     TWISTER opens on an Oklahoma farm, in 1969, where a little girl is
about to be scarred by a storm.  She'll endure the loss of Somebody
Special and then grow up to look *just* like Helen Hunt.  Cut to present
day, to a pick-up truck traveling on an Oklahoma highway.  Former
storm-chaser Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) and his fiancee (Jami Gertz) are
on their way to meet Jo (Helen Hunt), that now- adult little girl who is
Bill's almost ex-wife.  (Jo hasn't signed the divorce papers yet,
because she's been busy working on Dorothy, get it?, an invention to
study tornadoes.) Knowing how it all plays out, I think that we can
interpret this scene as the first of many mistakes.  Bill Harding isn't
the focus of what passes for the plot.  He's a strong presence, sure,
but he shouldn't be the first person that we lay eyes upon.  TWISTER, as
we learn, is about that little girl and the storm that she remembers.
Jo is the focus of this movie and *Jo* is the one who should be seen
accommodating Harding and his fiancee and not vice versa.</P>
<P>     The filmmaker's choice of a non-star cast-- a la JURASSIC PARK--
works well with regard to both Hunt and Paxton.  They are good actors
who exhibit a warm chemistry with each other, even as their dialogue
grows increasingly empty-headed.  Their light banter soon devolves into
incidental exclamations along the lines of "watch out!", "take cover!",
and "who wrote this crap?" (They're also very good at out-shouting each
other.) No, we never get a sense of who their *characters* are, but they
get an ample amount of screen time together and that's enough for most
summer movies.  Running from vehicle to vehicle and from storm to storm,
Hunt and Paxton are also very physical in their roles.  They finish the
film fleeing the best cornfield dusting since NORTH BY NORTHWEST.</P>
<P>     There's really enough story here, between these two characters,
that we don't need the other elements.  We don't need a team of rival
storm chasers, led by Cary Elwes.  (Cary Elwes?  What's he doing here?
If the script called for a "physically unthreatening opponent," then why
didn't somebody hire Paul Reiser?  He was very good in ALIENS, all those
years ago.) We don't need to put a supporting character in peril, to
either reinforce Jo's obsession or to put a "human face" on the
devastation.  (The scene involves a collapsed house and it just stops
the movie in its tracks.  What a waste of screen time.) And, we
*certainly* don't need Jami Gertz, who's character-- a "reproductive
therapist," Lord help us-- disrupts the tone about every eight minutes
or so.  She exists for comic relief (unnecessary) and to ask
unscientific questions, so the movie can explain to us, in "plain
English," what exactly "weather" is.  (Personally, I wish she had asked
about the radios and how these guys can simultaneously transmit on so
many frequencies at once.)</P>
<P>     As dazzling as the effects are, De Bont doesn't back them up with
the expert editing that he showed us in SPEED.  The storm sequences
often last too long and give us too much time to adjust to what we're
seeing.  (Familiarity breeds lack of fear.  A scene inside a car-garage
pit plays like a theme-park ride at Universal Studios.  Ditch it, but
not before explaining why the fools keep looking in the direction of the
flying debris.) Another glaring problem is that the film doesn't
communicate a sense of either distance or time.  We never know how far
the characters have been traveling or how long they've been chasing a
given storm.  When TWISTER *does* come together, the action is usually
on a smaller-scale.  Paxton and Hunt swerving to avoid falling farm
machinery; a tanker-truck that plops onto the highway in a burst of
flames; and, the piece de resistance, a drive-in theater that's showing
THE SHINING, with a screen that splinters while Jack is having his big
ax attack.  (Oddly, though, we're never shown any larger-scale
devastation.  No aerial shots of leveled towns, etc. etc.)</P>
<P>     If the scenes were confined to Hunt, Paxton, and the tornadoes, 
then TWISTER would work just fine.  Add their motley crew of 
assistants (Philip Seymour Hoffman, et al) for both comic relief 
and local color, and, viola, you've got a movie.  The director 
could do worse than to recut this mess.  Ditch the music, ditch the 
pop songs.  Cut as many scenes as possible with Elwes and Gertz.  
Cut at least half of the incidental dialogue.  Ditch the scene with 
the aunt and the collapsed house.  Tighten tighten tighten and we 
might have something here.  (And, since this is a Steven Spielberg 
production, maybe the idea of director's cut isn't *that* far-
fetched.  Are you listening Time-Warner marketing?)  For now, in 
its present form, TWISTER is just a lot of wind.  The FX are great, 
but, friends, outside of the funnel clouds, everything else sucks.</P>
