<P>Thirty-five years ago, "The Bullwinkle Show" was a big hit on televisions. 
Kids would wake up early just to watch the show. Heck when I was little I 
even used to watch the show alot. Yes Moose and Squirrel was the big thing, 
they were popular, made money had tons of fans and was in the lap of luxury. 
Thirty-five years is however a long time, and since then Rocky and Bullwinkle 
really hasn't been very famous, until the year 2000 when Universal releases a 
$80 million budgeted movie, starring Rocky and Bullwinkle. This isn't however 
the Rocky and Bullwinkle you remember, this time they are in the real world 
in an adventure to stop Fearless Leader from taking over the World.</P>
<P> The movie starts out telling us how Rocky and Bullwinkle has been living off 
re-runs of the show on TV. Bullwinkle has written a letter to the President 
about getting the tress grown back where they live in cartoon land. When 
Natasha, Boris and Fearless Leader are pulled through a television set by 
Jeanane Garofalo, Fearless Leader sets out to take over the world, by making 
a television station called RBTV (really bad TV) which when patrons will 
watch the shows and turn them into mindless walking zombies. Agent Sympathy 
(Piper Perabo of the upcoming "Coyote Ugly") is sent out to find Rocky and 
Bullwinkle and bring them into the real world, so they can stop Boris, 
Natasha and Fearless Leader.
Agent Sympathy brings the two to the real world, but she has to tell them 
what exactly is going on, while they try to adapt to the fact that there is 
no commercial breaks, and that the people around them are nicely animated. Of 
course the bad Boris and Natasha continue their raid to try to kill Moose and 
Squirrel. Agent Sympathy as to try to stop these two, while trying to get 
Rocky and Bullwinkle to understand that if they don't stop Fearless Leader in 
time, the world will come to an end. </P>
<P>The movie is outlined by very funny, often hilarious moments that I enjoyed 
enormously. The movie works on many levels and tanks of many levels. The 
levels it works on is that the actors who are portraying their characters are 
fantastic. Rene Russo is the stand out as Natasha Fatale the sexy french 
woman who with her honey Boris Badenov played well by Jason Alexander try to 
get Moose and Squirrel but as usual fail miserably. Jason Alexander is a 
great choice for Boris but sadly he isn't given enough to do, and at times 
seems a bit dull in the role. Robert De Niro is great as  Fearless Leader 
with his accent and high-pitched voice. Perhaps the best performance comes 
from newcomer Piper Perabo who is a talented and beautiful actress capable of 
many things in her future. There are some great cameos by stars like Whoopi 
Goldberg, John Goodman, Jeaneane Garofalo and many more. </P>
<P>Another plus to the film is the script which is cleverly written if at times 
a bit cliched. Rocky and Bullwinkle are greatly brought out and Bullwinkle is 
given some fantastic lines. The animation of these two are magnificent and 
plus in color and detail. They are brought out in a 3-D type of thing that is 
so great it might have surpassed Roger Rabbit's mix of Live Action and 
Animation, just fantastic and seeing the movie you can tell where the 
80+million budget came from. There are quite a bit of downsides to the film 
however, it seems really cartoonish and even sometimes dumb. There are some 
scenes that are really ridiculous and not even that funny.</P>
<P>I noticed that in a few scenes the cast seemed tired and the same joke was 
told over and over. But even with these flaws I was disappointed with the 
whole movie entirely, but the animation, characters and some of the insights 
of the film are enjoyable, and kids will definately love it. Its a good movie 
overall with flaws but far from being bad, but far from being perfect.</P>
