<P>     To say that Schindler's List is the most powerful dramatic film
ever made about the Holocaust is not to say that it will, or should,
supplant Jan Kadar's 1964 Oscar-winning masterpiece THE SHOP ON MAIN
STREET, or documentaries such as SHOAH and THE SORROW AND THE PITY as
the ultimate indictment against Nazism and its crimes against European
Jewry.</P>
<P>     But rather it may serve to overlook the true significance of the
film: that being the huge step toward greatness it represents for
director Steven Spielberg.</P>
<P>     The three-hour film, based on the true story recounted in Thomas
Keneally's 1982 book of the same name, chronicles the war for Oskar
Schindler (Liam Neeson); hustler of powerful men, seducer of beautiful
women, an industrialist who needed only one thing to fully flesh out
his marginal business acumen: a nice long war.</P>
<P>     The story begins as seductively as the horror, with Schindler
hustling an entire cafe full of Nazi officers and their women,
eventually securing the connections he needs to open a factory in
occupied Poland.  At the beginning of the war Oskar Schindler was a
glad-handing Nazi war profiteer; charming and reasonable, a string
quartet outside a death camp.</P>
<P>     Soon, Schindler moves to Krakow with the intent of launching his
enamelware factory with Jewish money, hiring Jewish workers at slave
wages and retiring at the end of the war a millionaire.  But Schindler,
whose concepts of war and business had always been conveniently
similar, did not plan on standing witness to genocide.  Like Kadar's
Tono Britko, Oskar Schindler was a man in moral turmoil.</P>
<P>     The film was shot in Poland and other authentic locations in black
and white, except for a solitary sequence where a little Jewish girl
runs through the streets of the Krakow ghetto in a red coat.  At times,
during SCHINDLER'S LIST, it is easy to forget that you are not watching
a documentary; the realities are that heightened, the barbarity, that
graphic and wrenching.</P>
<P>     Liam Neeson gives an extraordinary, measured performance as the
enigmatic Schindler; as does Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish
accountant who becomes Schindler's business and, ultimately, his
conscience.</P>
<P>     Yet, in this telling, the very heart of Nazism--the notion that
real might is not just the power to kill, but the power to kill
arbitrarily--is embodied in one man, Amon Goeth, the monster of
Plaszow.  As Goeth, British actor Ralph Fiennes moves with frightening
ease from beleaguered administrator to wild animal.  The scenes of
Goeth casually shooting slow-moving Jews from his balcony, then turning
back to his lover are some of the most stunning glimpses of evil ever
put on film.  Fiennes will surely be nominated for Best Supporting
Actor for this performance.</P>
<P>     But there are so many other numbing moments on which Spielberg, in
conveying the enormity of the horror, thankfully does not linger; the
image of  Jewish women using their own blood to put color in their
cheeks and lips, hoping to convey a healthy appearance; the image of
the five-year-old-boy hiding in a latrine, waist-deep in feces; the
sound of Itzhak Perlman's anguished violin, a muted plea on an empty
street.</P>
<P>     By the end of the war, Schindler's list--the roster of more than
a thousand Jewish names that Schindler and Stern compiled as "essential
munitions workers," hence saving them from all but certain
annihilation--serves as a small flame of humanity amid such monstrous
inhumanity.  In the realm of the soul, Schindler's list was the
ultimate wartime requisition.</P>
<P>     While Spielberg's first two attempts at "mature themes," THE COLOR
PURPLE and EMPIRE OF THE SUN, fell short of expectations, this
astoundingly explicit and moving film should proclaim that America's
most successful director has become one of America's great directors
and, in one impassioned gesture, has crossed a line of innocence from
which he will never fully return.</P>
<P>     You will not soon forget the little girl in the red coat, nor the
naked, brutal majesty of Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST.</P>
