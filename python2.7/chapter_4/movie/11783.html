Desirable "Wild Things"
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>If controversial talk show host Jerry Springer, renowned for fighting
guests and sensational subjects, ever wanted to live in a town that
would provide an endless well of scheming characters and bizarre
relationships, he might want to move into the upscale Florida enclave
of Blue Bay.  He could base an entire week of shows on Teacher of the
Year, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon).  When we first meet him, he appears
to be one of the most earnest of people - forthright and constantly
looking out for the interest of his students.  We also meet two of his
pupils.  One is an underachieving, wrong-side-of-the-tracks Suzie
Toller (Neve Campbell) and another is the richest girl in the
community, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards).  But in noirish movies
such as this, nothing is what it seems.</P>
<P>Immediately, we know that we are in for a strange movie experience.
As the beginning credits roll, we are hypnotized with a pulsating
drumbeat and guitar riffs that eerily twang for several measures.  We
also see opening scenes of the Floridian swamps and the crocodiles
that lie in wait suggesting a place of bitter secrets.  The filmmaker
quickly establishes that we are in a place slightly skewed from
reality.</P>
<P>Kelly has the blatant hots for Mr. Lombardo.  She makes excuses to get
close to him by asking for rides and washing his car.  We eventually
see Kelly standing in Lombardo's living room, dressed in a white shirt
and white shorts, dripping wet after washing his car, and looking
lustily at the surprised teacher.  However, the scene quickly moves
ahead and we see her leave the house, angry and distressed.  What has
happened?  She tells her mom, who is an ex-lover of Lombardo and the
most powerful person in Blue Bay, that she was raped.  Infuriated, the
police are summoned and the lead detective (Kevin Bacon) arrests the
teacher.  This entire setup, which takes about 45 minutes to develop,
finally leads to a trial.   After a surprise testimony, the film
quickly moves from a stale drama to a psychological thriller for the
remaining hour.</P>
<P>>From here, a new and twisted story begins to emerge, and this is where
the real fun begins.  However, it would be a crime for me to reveal to
you anything more.  But it becomes more engaging and amusingly campy
as it progresses.  Hidden motives emerge, unlikely alliances are
discovered and manipulative mind games are played with such fervor
that your movie-watching experience becomes almost voyeuristic.  </P>
<P> "Wild Things" is like driving really fast down a winding country road
at night without any headlights.  You never know what's ahead of you
but you find your trip reckless yet thrilling.  This is the kind of
movie that you'll either like or hate.  There is no middle ground.
There are surprises galore and the atmosphere is decidedly both
libidinous and bent.  For example, there is a hot three-way "love"
scene that happens among the principal actors which will either appall
you or cement the fact that this is a slick production about
manipulation that heightens the psychologically twisted plot.  "Wild
Things" is trashy, bizarre, lurid, and demented.   And I liked it.</P>
