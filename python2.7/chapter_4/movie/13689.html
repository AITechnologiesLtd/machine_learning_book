<P>   The renowned D'oyly Carte opera company went out of
business some years back because though they were the
world's foremost interpreters of the works of Gilbert and
Sullivan, they persisted in performing the masters like
museum pieces.  Updating classics is often a wise idea.  A
good emendation can make a dying masterpiece appear fresh
and contemporary.  Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Mikado" was
once successfully performed in a Toyota salesroom rather
than a medieval Japanese town, and the title character in
recent productions of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" often
totes a piece and bears a striking resemblance to Mussolini. 
Cinderella is an ideal tale to bring up to date since it lacks an
authentic rendering anyway.  With five hundred versions of
the story in circulation, the famed beauty is up for grabs by
any author who can put a fashionable spin on it.</P>
<P>   "Ever After" is a Cinderella for the nineties, keeping the
charred woman in the Sixteenth Century but making her
anything but the helpless lass in the fantasies of the Grimm
brothers, whose variant is the most popular in the west.  If
Alexander Graham Bell had lived in the 1500s, this Cinderella
would nonetheless not be waiting by the phone for a call from
her prince or even from a baron.  Active where the Grimms'
heroine was passive and stubborn as a terrier when the
situation calls for obduracy, the female of director Andy
Tennant's project discovers that you can get your prince by
insisting on equality just as others get their noble beaux by
downcast eyes.</P>
<P>   As the wicked stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston) says,
"Do not speak unless you can improve the silence."  Whether
or not Danielle (Drew Barrymore) does indeed enhance the
hush depends on your point of view.  If you're Rodmilla,
nothing she says or does can make you happy, and if you're
her beautiful but catty stepsister Marguerite (Megan Dodds),
you're competition at best, an embarrassing commoner at
worst.  Stepsister #2, Jacqueline (Melanie Lynskey) would like
to side with Marguerite but this time around she is mostly a
cipher, though secretly on the side of Cindy.</P>
<P>    Forget the pumpkin.  "Ever After" sounds like a fairy tale
but it's more of a contemporary royal romance than a pixie-
like plot.  After the sudden death of her beloved father
Auguste (Jeroen Krabbe), Danielle loses all her status as his
cherished little girl and is forced to work as a domestic in her
stepmother's home.  On several occasions, she runs into
Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), the heir to the throne of
France, and though she beans him with an apple the first time
around, she soon develops a speaking relationship.  During
their sessions in the countryside, she describes to him her
political philosophy which she has culled from her dad's
favorite book, "Utopia" by Sir Thomas More.  Recall that
More, the early 16th century writer once said "They wonder
much to hear that gold, which in itself is so useless a thing,
should be everywhere so much esteemed that even men for
whom it was made are thought of less value than it."   In
other words the writer was a true democrat, and Danielle is to
influence French politics by convincing the prince that thieves
are not bad people, because "a thief cnanot help himself if
you suffer a man to be ill-educated."  On another occasion
she advises, "Rustics are the legs of a country and deserve
respect."</P>
<P>    Aside from these scenes which exploit political science to
further feeling of amour, there's a feeble bit of swordplay
between Henry and a gypsy band, a few scenes of silly
peasant women virtually fainting at the sight of royalty, one of
Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) walking on water, and
one of Marguerite whining "I wanted one four-minute egg, not
four one-minute eggs."  Henry is finally sold on marriage to
Danielle when the young woman charges, "You own all the
land, yet can find no pleasure in working it," to which the
prince, intoxicated by her feminism, recounts how "You swim
alone, climb rocks, and free servants."</P>
<P>   No doubt that Andy Tennant has brought the famous fable
up to date, but does he really improve the silence?  For the
most part his update has good comedic touches, strong
feminist purport, and entertaining vistas.  The picture is
seriously marred by Dougray Scott, who may remind you of
Antonio Banderas but displays none of the charm of that
flamboyant Spanish actor.  He delivers his lines in a
monotone and has the charisma of a French souffle.  Anjelica
Huston does a surprisingly good comic turn as the malevolent
mom who wants only the best for her own daughters but
meets her comeuppance from the queen, and Drew
Barrymore plays to type as a 20th century independent
woman who discovers that feistiness, not pliability, ultimately
triumphs.</P>
