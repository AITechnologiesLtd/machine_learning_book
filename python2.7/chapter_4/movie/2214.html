                    THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS
                    A film review by Aaron Sherman
                     Copyright 1993 Aaron Sherman</PRE>
<P>Directed by: ? (Henry Selick, director of animation)
Music: Danny Elfman
Starring: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, Glenn Shadix,
         Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Ed Ivory, Sherwood Ball, Debi Durst,
         Randy Crenshaw, Kerry Katz, Susan McBride, Bobbi Page,
         Greg Proops, Carmen Twillie and Glenn Walters</P>
<P>     Others can, I'm sure, point out a lot more technical detail about
this movie than I (this is why I am not giving more credits info).
But, there are a few highlights that I thought I should point out,
after seeing another review in this newsgroup.</P>
<P>     First, NIGHTMARE is about traditional, modern, American holidays.
As such, you will see no note made of the many origins of Holloween, or
anything other than a stereotype witch, etc.  This is unfortunate, but
only to be expected in modern film.</P>
<P>     Second, Elfman is fantastic (IMNSHO)!  He pulls a lot of his work
together for this one, and blends everything well.  I had only a few
problems with his work here and they mostly centered around my
impression that he seemed to be toning himself down, so that he would
not be "too dark."  Other than that, he turned in an incredible
performance, and I hope that this is a real boost to his career.  Of
special notability are: Elfman singing as Jack (the main character,
whose speaking voice was done by Chris Sarandon) in "What's This?";
Elfman, O'Hara and Reubens (Peewee Herman) singing "Kidnap the Sandy
Claws" and Oogie Boogie's Song.  The last, sung by Ken Page and Ed
Ivory which, though it lacked the scariness that it should have had,
made up for it in personality.</P>
<P>     Aside from Elfman, the movie had only the visuals going for it, as
it was a fairly simple story about the towns where holidays are made.
But, what visuals they were!  Tim Burton dropped SOME of his usual
claustrophobic feel, and Selick (director of anim.) pulled off the
slickest stop-motion we're likely to see for a long time.  Jack's
expressions were VERY life-like, and all of the backgrounds made me do
a double-take or three.</P>
<PRE>Some minor flaws:</PRE>
<PRE>        1. The soundtrack includes a great closing and longer opening
           that were not in the movie.  This really helps to set the
           mood and complete the story.  It's also read by Patrick
           Stewart.  I wish this has been left.
        2. The relationship between Jack and Sally was rushed at the
           end.</PRE>
<P>     Overall, I give this movie an 8 on a 1-10 scale. (8.5, just
because Elfman didn't let his music get used for the Burger King adds
;-)</P>
