<P>Susan Granger's review of "LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS"</P>
<P>       Talk about hype! If you read the newspaper ads, this looks like
an irresistible crime caper. Don't believe it - unless you're willing
and able to decipher rhythmic Cockney slang, familiar only in London's
East End. In fact, the garbled dialogue is so unintelligible that, in
several scenes, there are even subtitles! The action-packed, Quentin
Tarantino-like plot revolves around underworld ineptitude. Nick Moran
plays a cocky card-shark who loses 500,000 pounds ($800,000) to a
gambler in a rigged card game. He's told to pay up within a week or he
and his hapless pals (Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, and Jason
Statham) will get their bodily parts chopped off in increments,
starting with the fingers. There is an alternative: he could get his
father, played by Sting, to turn over his popular bar to the
gambler. Since neither solution is appealing, Moran and his friends
decide to rip off a neighborhood marijuana factory. There's lots of
shooting, several battling gangs, Damon Runyon'ish characters (Hatchet
Harry, Barry the Baptist, Big Chris) and even a few laughs in the
midst of the crazy get-rich-quick schemes. One of the ploys involves
stealing two valuable antique muskets - the titular smoking barrels.
But, all in all, it's quite violent, repeatedly profane, and the
characters are remarkably unpleasant to watch. Obviously, first-time
writer/director Guy Ritchie has a talent for style and, given a more
coherent story, he'll do good films in the future. But the virtues of
this film lie in the rapid pace, MTV-like camera angles and quick
cuts. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Lock, Stock, and Two
Smoking Barrels" is an edgy, fumbling 4, filled with double-crosses,
chaos and corpses.</P>
