YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "Great, couldn't be better," is the universal refrain of the 
smiling characters that inhabit writer and director Neil LaBute's second 
film, YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.  That they are actually anything but 
is no surprise given the filmmaker.  His brilliant first picture, IN THE 
COMPANY OF MEN, which was on numerous best-of-the-year lists last year, 
established a benchmark for human cruelty.</P>
<P>     LaBute's latest battle of the sexes has the women as well as the 
men playing both predator and victim.  YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS paints 
such a hopelessly bleak picture of relationships that we may want to 
become a nation of hermits.  When characters share moments of joy, you 
can be sure that LaBute will soon pull the rug out from under them and 
that their little sexual flings will turn into horrific mistakes.</P>
<P>     In his first film, LaBute had two men on the prowl to harass a 
single woman, a shy, deaf coworker of theirs.  This time LaBute 
introduces six unique characters: a married couple, a couple living 
together, and two single people.  They will all be devastated by the 
time this "immorality tale" concludes.  The bleak story engulfs the 
audience's emotions but provides just enough humor to make it bearable.  
The ensemble casting is superlative so the emotional drain it puts on 
the viewers is well worth its toll.</P>
<P>     As Cary, the story's only thoroughly evil character, Jason Patric 
has the easiest part.  A doctor whose lesser depravities include 
drop-kicking a plastic fetus when no one is watching.  Cary is closest 
in actions to IN THE COMPANY OF MEN's male characters.  His steam room 
confession of a childhood atrocity forms the nadir of the story's tales 
of inhumanity.</P>
<P>     Nastassja Kinski plays Cheri, an artist's assistant and the film's 
only completely sympathetic character.  LaBute has the other characters 
coming into the art gallery where Cheri works and engaging in the same 
series of lines with her but with differing results.</P>
<P>     As the nerdy drama teacher, Jerry, Ben Stiller is the story's most 
unsatisfying and ingratiating character.  Stiller, last seen hilariously 
in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, makes Jerry into a bit too much of a 
caricature.  A Woody Allen clone, Jerry drives his live-in girlfriend, 
Terri, crazy with incessant talking during sex.  She feels like he is 
the weather channel announcer since he is obsessed with issuing constant 
updates during their trysts.  When she finally finds a lover more to her 
liking, she tells her that it is the silence that she likes best about 
their lovemaking.</P>
<P>     Catherine Keener, with her translucent acting style, plays Terri, a 
writer - well, sort of.  When Cheri asks if she might have ever read 
anything of Terri's, Terri answers, "only if you read the side of your 
tampon box."  Terri is ashamed of her career, but Cheri finds it 
fascinating, turning over boxes in the grocery store to see if she can 
find any of Terri's work.  They hit it off in one of the few romances in 
the story that has much real promise.  Terri has a cynic's heart.  
"Love's a disease," Terri concludes.  "Yeah, but it's curable," Cheri 
tries to console her.</P>
<P>     At the fulcrum of the film is the married couple Mary and Barry, 
played by Amy Brenneman and IN THE COMPANY OF MEN's star, Aaron Eckhart.  
Their picture postcard perfect marriage is quickly shown to be a facade.  
They aren't happy with any part of their marriage, least of all their 
sex life.</P>
<P>     On either side of this fulcrum are the single sex buddy scenes - 
the women gather at lunch and the men in the locker room.  Full of false 
bravado, their conversations quickly cut to the bone as reality begins 
to set in.  </P>
<P>     The male bonding, and to a lesser extent the female, comes back to 
the question of naming one's best ever sexual encounter.  One guy 
confesses that he is the best that he has ever had.  Other answers prove 
more troublesome and baneful.</P>
<P>     Sometimes the characters' sexual adventures start off with hope and 
promise.  One adulterous affair has the characters giggling gleefully 
like teenagers.  They start their clandestine arrangement with the 
wonderful intimacy of a simple hug.  LaBute, like a vengeful god, will 
soon make them pay for their indiscretions.</P>
<P>     "Life is complicated," Cheri tells Jerry.  "It's a funny world.  
People can't communicate."  In LaBute's stories, life certainly is 
complex, and, when people speak, things only get worse.  His characters' 
vituperative language is more cutting than knives.  Rarely raising their 
voices, they manage to inflict mortal wounds with moments of relatively 
quiet terror.  Biting social commentary wrapped in the thin veneer of a 
black comedy, his films have much to say even if they can be 
overwhelming.  Unlike action films you forget in an hour, his movies 
will stay with you for years afterwards, provoking thought and 
reflection.</P>
<P>     YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS runs 1:40.  It is rated R for profanity, 
sex, and very mature themes and would be appropriate for teenagers only 
if they are older and mature.</P>
