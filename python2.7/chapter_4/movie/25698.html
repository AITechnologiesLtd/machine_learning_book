<P>Richard Gere was mad at the studio for not pre-screening this movie for
critics because that's usually a sure-fire sign that a film sucks. Gere came
out and said that he was "very proud of the film", while the studio claimed
that they didn't pre-screen it because they didn't want critics ruining any
plot points for the audience. Yeah...whatever! In the end, I was going to
decide this one for myself. And to be honest, the studio's action and the
lame trailer for this movie had me expecting the worst. In the end, the
film's wasn't so bad, but it wasn't much good either. It was just sort
of...there.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Old, rich, womanizing man falls for a young, perky girl with a secret. You
know the story...boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl again, etc...
Obstacles are thrown in the way of their relationship and the couple must
struggle to make the best of their difficult situation.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A sad, love story featuring a distant performance from Richard Gere, a good
turn by Ryder but a lack of real emotion needed to fuel its supposedly
moving, and unoriginal, story line. Having said that, despite no new ground
being broken with this film, I did appreciate the lead couple's chemistry
(for the most part) and was never really bored during its runtime, in spite
of some overly sappy dialogue at times. In fact, having gone in with
expectations of the worst kind, I must say that the overall film surprised
me as a pretty "okay" time. But in the end, I just can't recommend it
because all real love stories inevitably live or die according to the
audience's connection to its lead characters, and if the characters in the
movie don't "work", the film as a whole suffers. Having said that, I thought
Winona was quite commendable in her role. She was perky when she needed to
be, cute at that, sad when the time called for it, and even angry, when
things got out of hand.</P>
<P>Richard Gere, on the other hand, well...who was the brave soul who actually
believed that he might be able to pull off more than a handful of emotions
in this film? I mean, I like Richard Gere, I think he's an interesting man,
a decent performer, but a good actor, well...not really. How can I empathize
with the film or its characters when I don't really feel any emotion when
emotion is what is supposed to be stirring up inside me at that time? I
mean, I had more tears in my eyes when I found out that Jar Jar Binks was
returning in the Star Wars sequel than Gere did in his major breakdown scene
here! But if you take away the "Gere" factor, the film itself does present
some decent style, via rookie director Joan Chen, a soothing soundtrack and
some nice shots of New York City (natch!). But in the end, it just failed to
"pull me into" its story as much as it should have. And yes, I definitely
could have done without some of the really corny lines and poetry, but then
again, others may think it romantic. I do understand the studio's difficulty
in marketing such a film though. Despite its romantic moments, the film also
deals with a very bleak subject matter and in a very big way. The studio
decided to show only the "good stuff" in the trailer, which may ultimately
bite them in the ass, when couples walk out of the film, disappointed and
surprised to find such gloominess within.</P>
<P>I didn't mind that so much, in fact, I thought another great title for the
film could've been THE AGING WOMANIZER, but the movie itself probably isn't
really worth checking out in the theatres. But if don't mind shlocky
"remakes" of other sappy stuff, like the two lead actors and just wanna get
out of the house...well, okay then! :)</P>
