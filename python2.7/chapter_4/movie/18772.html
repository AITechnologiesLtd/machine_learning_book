<P>Playwright-turned-filmmaker David Mamet (The Spanish Prisoner) has, in
his previous pictures, created gritty, urban crime dramas full of seedy
characters that bombard viewers with machine-gun-like expletives and
unpredictable double-crosses.  So why would Mamet, who until now had
written each of his directorial efforts, adapt Terence Rattigan's 1946
stage play for his next film project?</P>
<P>It doesn't matter - Mamet's leap into the period genre is magnificent.
The story, set in 1912, focuses on a real-life incident in
turn-of-the-century England in which the 13-year-old son of a wealthy
London banker is accused of stealing a five-pound postal note and is
unduly expelled from the posh Osbourne Naval College.  Ronnie (Guy
Edwards) continues to profess his innocence, earning the support of his
pop (Nigel Hawthorne, The Madness of King George) and sis (Rebecca
Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), who eventually hire Robert Morton (Jeremy
Northam, Emma), the country's top attorney, to both defend the boy and
right the good Winslow name.</P>
<P>The case becomes a national frenzy, spawning O.J.-like tabloid stories
and political cartoons as the Winslow family drains its considerable
finances to proceed with the case that most insiders believe is a lost
cause, as well as a colossal waste of both time and money.  Mamet's
characters, while not as slimy and crooked as we're used to, still speak
in hypnotically rhythmic salvos.  Northam really steals the show with
his portrayal of the attention-loving lawyer that can't seem to decide
whether he's involved in the case for the fame, the money, the
moralistic battle or for Pidgeon's Catherine.  And when was the last
time you liked an attorney in a film?  (1:50 – G for just about nothing)</P>
