<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Sigourney Weaver visited a Racine, Wisconsin, county jail to prepare for her
unglamorous prison part in A Map of the World, and she said it was the toughest
preparation she had to do in research for any part she's played. This is her
favorite role in her personal favorite movie. She finds sympathy in playing a
flawed character called Alice Goodwin who moves from a big Midwestern city to be
an outsider in a small rural Wisconsin town, with her awkward, supportive, and
stalwart husband Howard (Strathairn) running an alternative-lifestyle dairy
farm. He instigated this move she wasn't that crazy about, but went along with
it the best way she could. They have two precocious young girls, the older being
Emma and the more docile one being Claire (Dara & Kayla Perlmutter- real
sisters). </P>
<P>Somehow you get the feeling the beleaguered mother has days where she is not all
that keen about living in the sticks, being a school nurse to the uncultured
school kids, and at times even being married to someone she has trouble
communicating with in a chaotic household. When the bratty Emma, someone she
really loves, has a temper tantrum for no apparent reason and breaks her cereal
bowl on the floor, the 'be-true-to-thine-own-self' Alice knows she doesn't like
her daughter at that moment and also doesn't have a clue on how to get her to
behave. </P>
<P>It took 30 days to film, and it was mostly shot in Toronto with only the city
scene shot in Chicago. </P>
<P>Sigourney mentioned that this is an unusual and uplifting film, though the
unusual nature of the film is easy to see, as this gritty dramatic film takes a
conventional soap opera story about a nuclear family and makes it into a moving
drama where the characters are forced to look at themselves again and undergo
changes they didn't expect. The uplifting part was harder to see and just might
be up to the individual to find what is meant by uplifting. According to
Sigourney, when I asked her, she said it was uplifting because the family was
still intact at the end and for the character she plays returning to the city is
not such a bad thing--and her husband who misses the farm the most, is still
pleased with the way things worked out for all of them. It was a difficult film
to come up with easy answers, as it required some thought to sift through the
many layers of the characters. It is based on a novel by Jane Hamilton and
adheres to the plot for the most part. </P>
<P>The plot thickens when their hard but mostly satisfying stay on the farm
suddenly changes into a nightmare due to circumstances beyond Alice's control.
They're best friends with their neighbors Dan and Teresa Collins (Ron Lea &
Julianne Moore), and when Alice is baby-sitting for Teresa's two young
daughters, Lizzy and Audrey, the troubled Alice loses track of the younger girl
Lizzy, who quietly slips out of the living room and drowns in the Goodwin's
pond. </P>
<P>The death of the toddler is not only devastating for Teresa, but Alice begins to
feel guilty about the accident and is on the verge of a nervous break-down. It's
at this vulnerable time that she gets blind sided by law officials, who question
her about a nasty child, Robbie Mackessy (Donato), who is always being treated
in her office for ailments she determines are due to neglect--as she doesn't
quite understand what the rather thick officers want from her and blurts out "I
hurt everybody I come into contact with." Robbie's single mom, Carole (Chloe
Sevigny), is too busy entertaining her many boyfriends to care for him properly,
and deeply resents the nurse for her interference. After the accident the
vengeful mother sees this as a time to get even with the nurse she resents as
the town begins to take a dim view of Alice, she thusly brings charges of child
abuse which results in her arrest. </P>
<P>The film unexpectedly goes into a prison and courtroom drama, with the most
riveting scenes reserved for how she handles the demeaning time she spends in
prison; especially, when trying to handle herself when trying to deal with
hostile black prisoners who get their knowledge of the world from watching
Oprah. There's also the constant noise and lack of privacy to deal with. The
most touching prison scenes were of Howard trying to communicate with her from
behind the glass partition, this comes after he couldn't communicate with her
before when there were no barriers at home. </P>
<P>She clearly becomes someone who is torturing herself more than any punishment
the law can hand out to her. In the courtroom, her expensive attorney (Howard)
stakes out a brilliant defense that is hampered by her need to say truthful
things she doesn't have to say to the court. </P>
<P>Unfortunately there was one scene that was baked over too fine: that would be
the jail scene with Alice eventually winning over the hardened cons. It seemed
contrived and the film spent too much prison time, as it said everything it had
to say about the dehumanizing effect jail has in its opening shot when she was
booked and everything else seemed reduntant. </P>
<P>Also, the last scene felt flat. A free from prison Alice is back in a Chicago
apartment eating an orderly pasta meal with her family. It seemed too theatrical
in framing the nuclear family to be convincing; framed with a slo-mo zoom shot
edging in on the family eating while enveloped by a dark background with only
the light from an overhead light piercing the faces, as each member of the
family had a slightly different expression to their new situation. I find it
hard to believe that was an uplifting scene as much as it was one that put an
exclamation point on the situation, visually indicating that things are still
tenuous for the family and even though they have gone over one terrible hurdle
and are perhaps psychologically stronger because of it--they are still not out
of the dark. But, then again, if you find that uplifting you'll get no argument
from me. </P>
<P>The film is directed by Scott Elliott, making his film debut after being known
for his Broadway work and as the artistic director of the New Group; the film is
more ambiguous than pat, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Elliott also does
a great job of drawing out an outstanding performance from Sigourney Weaver. But
the film is somewhat taken aback by a few bad decisions, such as giving Julianne
Moore such a small part when she was so compelling as Sigourney's best friend
who misses her friendship while also grieving for her daughter. It was a part
that should have been expanded and it weakened the film by instead padding it
with stale prison and courtroom scenes that many films have done before.
Nevertheless, this is still a high quality drama, especially recognizing
Sigourney Weaver's tour de force performance of a complex woman who is a little
off-kilter. That should be rewarding enough for those who crave intelligent 'Mom
in trouble' dramas. </P>
<P>I unhestatingly recommend the film for the way it intelligently examines the
family crisis--though it's not for everyone, as the casual viewer might not be
interested in a serious film that can be disturbing when a toddler is taken off
a respirator. </P>
<P>The film's title comes from an imaginary map located in the heart, and how the
family in its pain and recovery use that map to guide them to where they should
live together. </P>
<P>The film played at the Williamstown Film Festival. </P>
