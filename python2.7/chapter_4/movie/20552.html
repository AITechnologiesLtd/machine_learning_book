<P>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1999
Directors/Screenplay: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez
Starring Cast: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams</P>
<P>Almost everyone predicted that cinema in 1999 would be the year of 
Lucas and Kubrick, but few would have guessed ahead of time that one 
of the most talked-about films of the year after THE PHANTOM MENACE 
and EYES WIDE SHUT would be a micro-budget horror film called THE 
BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. The film was made (do I even need to repeat this 
story?) on a budget of $37,000 and boasts an intriguing premise: it 
claims to be the footage, only recently discovered, shot by three 
film students who disappeared in the woods near a small town called 
Burkittsville while making a documentary about the local legend of 
the "Blair Witch." This is, of course, a piece of fiction, though 
reportedly much of what we see was improvised on the spot by the 
three actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, 
all using their real names), who really did shoot the footage 
themselves and who were given only a broad outline by co-writers and 
directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez.</P>
<P>Since the scenes were filmed by the actors, with the directors 
waiting off-camera and out of sight, there are no special effects or 
scenes of gruesome murder in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and the witch 
herself never actually appears on-screen. The "horror" rests instead 
on slowly escalating psychological tension, as the students become 
lost in the woods, their map disappears, and unseen menaces seem to 
draw nearer. They seem to be surrounded by strange noises at night 
whose origins they cannot determine, and in the morning, 
ominous-looking stick figures made of twigs and leaves are found 
outside their tent. One night, children's voices are heard outside 
and their tent suddenly collapses on them, but when they run outside, 
there is no one in sight. As their situation grows more desperate, 
they start to turn against each other and lay blame for their 
predicament, mostly on Heather, who had conceived of the project and 
who insisted beyond all reason that they were not lost.</P>
<P>John Carpenter said once that horror revolves around the loss of 
control, and Myrick and Sanchez seem to understand that. Until the 
last five minutes, the overall effect of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is 
more disturbing than it is "scary" in the way the word is typically 
understood. Since none of the apparent supernatural elements are ever 
witnessed on screen, there are very few moments that are likely to 
make the audience jump out of their seats in fright. Instead, we come 
to empathize with the three characters as they endure day after day 
that is dominated by fear and confusion; what the film lacks in 
visceral thrills is compensated for by the human tragedy that plays 
itself out. Towards the end, Heather records a tearful apology to 
Josh's and Mike's families as well as her own and accepts 
responsibility for the untimely end which she knows they will soon 
meet. This scene is matched in power perhaps only by the final five 
minutes, which will truly scare many viewers witless and which end 
with an ambiguous but unsettling visual that will not easily be 
forgotten.</P>
<P>All three performers pull off their roles almost flawlessly. Heather 
is perhaps the most interesting of the trio, as her later need to put 
some sort of emotional distance between herself and the increasingly 
grim situation accounts partly for the fact that the entire ordeal is 
caught on camera. Even when they are hopelessly lost and running out 
of food, she insists that they keep filming, and Josh, who had 
earlier screamed at her to turn the camera off, later takes a look 
through the lens and tells her he understands, because watching 
through the camera rather than through one's own eyes is "not quite 
reality." She is also the most flawed of the three, as it was her 
initial overconfidence that led indirectly to their predicament. Both 
Josh and Mike are also quite believable and sympathetic, though the 
way in which one of them is revealed as being responsible for the map 
disappearing doesn't really work: it strikes me as an amazingly 
boneheaded stunt, however frustrated the guilty party may have been.</P>
<P>I don't know if there's really much of a theme or a point to THE 
BLAIR WITCH PROJECT aside from some fairly routine "humankind's 
arrogance in overstepping its boundaries" implications. It's a story 
that exists mostly for its own sake, as an experiment in blending two 
cinematic approaches that are usually incompatible, i.e. the 
supernatural thriller and the verisimilitude of a pseudo-documentary. 
On this level, however, it does definitely succeed. There is never 
the sense that we are watching actors perform a scene, and the 
supernatural elements are necessarily implied rather than shown (an 
appearance by a CGI-rendered Blair Witch would have turned the whole 
thing into a long joke with a bad punchline). The key to the film's 
success is the realization that, for the most part, stories sink or 
swim with their characters. By giving the protagonists center stage 
and keeping the spooks off-screen, Myrick and Sanchez have made THE 
BLAIR WITCH PROJECT into a film that is not only disturbing and 
occasionally downright chilling, but tragic and empathetic as well. 
It's a bold debut, and I would be surprised if I see a better horror 
film any time soon.</P>
