<PRE>                         DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY
                       A film review by Thomas Miller
                        Copyright 1993 Thomas Miller</PRE>
<P>     I caught a sneak preview of this last night and figured I'd inform
the world.  The movie is an account of Bruce Lee's life, from his
childhood to his death.  Though the fight scenes are well-filmed and
believable, this movie is equally as good for its focus on other
aspects of Lee's life, such as his relationship with his wife and
children, his conflicts with the Chinese martial arts community, and
his desire to prove himself despite racism in America.</P>
<P>     Though there are some gaps in the history (several of Bruce's
films weren't mentioned) this isn't really a factor.  One small problem
I saw was the apparent dubbing at times.  It makes no sense that they
would have to dub anything, but yet it shows in some conversations.
There are also some confusing scenes, but I don't want to give anything
away - no doubt this will be discussed in rec.arts.movies soon.</P>
<P>     Bruce Lee is played by Jason Scott Lee (no relation), who does a
good job, though he is a bit too muscular.  The actress who plays Linda
Lee did an outstanding job, particularly in the scenes where Bruce is
torn between his family and his career (her name escapes me at the
moment.)</P>
<P>     The movie is based on the memoirs of Linda Lee, and it shows.  In
my opinion, this is as much a movie from the heart as from the fist,
though action fans won't be disappointed.  The audience I was part of
gave it a standing ovation at the end, one that was, again in my
opinion, well-deserved.</P>
