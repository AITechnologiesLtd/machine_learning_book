<P>What is Buffalo '66 supposed to be anyway? A romantic comedy? A troubled
family presentation? The 90s answer to Taxi Driver? Half the fun of this
movie is trying to figure it out for yourself.</P>
<P>Buffalo '66 is about Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) who has been imprisoned
for 5 years and is finally let out. He has been lying to his parents
(Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara) saying that he was working for the
government and is married. He is asked by his parents to come over along
with his wife. He
thinks he has to our his parents will suspect that he is lying. He
kidnaps a twenty something girl named Layla (Christian Ricci) and uses
her as a fill in.</P>
<P>To relieve any more of the plot (much like Pulp Fiction) would be to
spoil the amazing second half. I'm sorry I can't help you out but you
just have to see the movie.</P>
<P>The film was no doubt constructed on a very small budget. It was a big
hit at the film festivals and it's easy to wonder why. It is a touching
and yet tough as nails representation of the life of a underprivileged
man with a horrible family that cares more about football games then
about their son.</P>
<P>Vincent Gallo wrote, directed, starred, and constructed the excellent
soundtrack to this pet project. He shows greatness that hasn't been seen
since Quentin Tarantino debuted with Reservoir Dogs. Every scene is
fantastic in the storytelling. The images burn into your mind and stay
there forever. The story may sound simple but I didn't say a lot of it.
I'm not the spoiling type.</P>
<P>All members of the cast need to be congratulated on this project. Gallo
explodes into the film world with a beautiful script and acting talent.
Huston and Gazzara are perfectly cast as the two parents who are about
as a bad as they can get. Ricci is also very good as the girl who comes
to love Brown. She is quickly becoming one of the best actresses around.</P>
<P>It's a pity that Buffalo '66 wasn't given a wider release in it's
theatrical run. It would have locked into viewers like the Tarantino
films or like Trainspotting did. Now that the film is out on video it
gives a much easier opportunity for regular film fans to check out this
great movie. Buffalo '66 is easily one of the best movies of 1998 and
should be seen.</P>
