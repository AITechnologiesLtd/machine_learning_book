<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 stars</P>
<P>There are quirky films, and then there is Rushmore, a film that is
intent on deviating from the norm of filmmaking. The "hero" of this
story is unlike any other in recent memory. Geeky but sort of cool Max
Fischer (Jason Schwartzman, in a bold debut performance) is a wacky
protagonist, a guy with a mean attitude but a soft center.  Playing
alongside Schwartzman is Bill Murray (in one of his better roles of
recent years), who has an equally peculiar character.  Murray and
Schwartzman live out every comedian's dream: they get to act
simultaneously smart and silly, and receive a whole lot of laughs in the
process.  To further compliment the production, Wes Anderson directs
Rushmore intelligently and humorously, whilst not stripping his
intelligent moments of humor, and not making his humor particularly
intelligent.</P>
<P>Max is a 10th grader at Rushmore Academy, and for him, school is his
life.  He is involved in numerous extracurricular roles, ranging from
captain of the fencing and debating teams to the founder of the
Double-team Dodgeball Society.  With his thick rimmed glasses, blazer
and quick thinking mind, Max is often thought of as a kid genius.  Truth
is, he's a lousy student and is under constant threat of expulsion.  Max
falls in love with a first grade teacher named Miss Cross (Olivia
Williams), and tries to win her over by hatching various plans.  When
Latin classes are about to be replaced by Japanese, Max cleverly makes
the subject compulsory for all senior years; later, he attempts to
construct an aquarium on Rushmore's baseball field.</P>
<P>To help raise money, Max consults school benefactor Mr. Blume (Bill
Murray), a seedy millionaire who appears to be in the middle of a
mid-life crisis.  Blume is attracted to Max's energy and eccentric ways,
and the two become good friends.  But when Max discovers that Blume is
also in love with Miss Cross, a mean war initiates between the two (at
one stage, Blume runs over Max's bicycle, so Max removes the brakes from
his car).  As Max desperately attempts to act like an adult, Blume finds
excitement in acting like a child.</P>
<P>Almost all of Rushmore's oddly timed humor relies on its characters.
Whilst we develop a good understanding of Max and Blume's personalities,
they are never predictable and never boring.  The relationship between
these two really needed to work, and it does, much to the credit of
Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. Schwartzman's first film performance
is a memorable one, and is skillfully played with a mixture of nastiness
and goofy sincerity.  Murray has received great but small roles recently
in Wildthings and Kingpin, but his work in Rushmore is much closer to
what he is capable of achieving.  Murray is a brilliant comic performer
and this film channels his capabilities, producing a nice bit of
whimsical acting.</P>
<P>It's the winning formula of offbeat comedy and drama that makes Rushmore
such a delight to watch.  Wes Anderson's and co-writer Owen Wilson's
screenplay is smart and original - they understand how to craft
extraordinary characters, and have fun doing so.  Though some scenes in
Rushmore have little or no point, the film is always amusing enough to
warrant an audience.  Rushmore has reinvented the teenage comedy genre
(similar to what The Breakfast Club did in 1985, and what Can't Hardly
Wait attempted to do in 1998) by giving itself a quirkiness and
originality that is rarely found in contemporary cinema.  There are more
reasons to see Rushmore other than its originality, but none are quite
as refreshing.</P>
