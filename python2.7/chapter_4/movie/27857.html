15 Minutes</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony </PRE>
<P>"15 minutes" is a title way too small for its film -- like a cork meant 
to damn the Nile. This is the most intense production of the year. 
"Hannibal" scary? Forget it -- comparatively speaking. Director John 
Herzfeld brews up a fervent stew of hard as brass conflict, gruesome 
homicides, tasteful sprinkles of humor, rock solid dialogue, 
tight-as-gears direction, solid performances, grinding sound track, and 
whirling cinematography. Powerful, simply powerful. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, a few implausibles abate the punch - but not enough to 
stop this rumbling steamroller of a film. Never a dull, boring moment - 
ever. </P>
<P>Two Europeans thugs come to the States to collect their money from a 
fellow thief and comrade. When they learn he's spent it all, the mean 
thug kills the friend with a kitchen knife while the Hollywood-loving 
thug videotapes the murder. It's gruesome and it's vile and it's angry. 
This film is not for the weak of stomach. Realizing that the friend's 
wife witnessed the crime, the mean one kills her too. Again the somewhat 
comedic Capra-wannabee tapes. Here lies the first implausibility. That 
mean thug would smash that camera against the wall -- this would be 
consistent with his rage and motivation to destroy all evidence of his 
crime. A smashed camera wouldn't have effected the play of the rest of 
the story. </P>
<P>Those are the two bad boys; the good guys have a duo of their own. Bobby 
De Niro laps up the press as poster cop and "friend" of "Top Story" TV 
tabloid host Kelsey Grammer. Edward Burns plays a crackerjack Arson 
Investigator - a fireman with a gun. The give and take between this cop 
and firefighter team splendidly constructs the spine, heart and soul of 
the film. </P>
<P>A second implausibility arises when the two bad guys begin to argue over 
ownership of their master plan. It's conceivable of course that this 
would happen, but the manifestation and timing of the event rides an 
altogether different grain from the rest their interplay. </P>
<P>Both thugs are strong performers. "You think I came to America to work?" 
When the mean thug delivers that line ... you just know he's not very 
well tempered. De Niro endears the viewer to his character by first 
teasing, then assisting his unlikely partner, "You remind me of a puppy 
I used to have." His prep for a proposal moment further cements our 
sympathies ... however the actual proposal scene plays prominently 
cliche in this gritty original film. </P>
<P>"15 Minutes" starts out like an independent picture, but eventually 
explodes into an all out Hollywood production that takes you up with it 
and slams you down. Excellent dynamics and direction ... this film will 
do very well at the box office. </P>
