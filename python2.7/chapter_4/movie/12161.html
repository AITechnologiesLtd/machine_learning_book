                 A Film Review by James Kendrick

<P>"The Lords of Discipline" was one of the last in a string of
youth-oriented military movies that appeared in the early
eighties, including "Taps" (1981) and "An Officer and a
Gentleman" (1983). However, it has neither the idealism of the
former, nor the romance of the latter.</P>
<P>The story is set at the fictional Carolina Military Institute in
South Carolina, some time during the mid-sixties when America was
in a period of profound change. Although at first, the movie
seems to be about the school's difficulty in incorporating its
first black cadet, it soon turns into a sort of quasi-mystery
about one honest cadet's battle against a secretive
group-within-the-group. Known as "The Ten," this group has
determined to ensure that all those that "don't fit in" according
to their standards are run out of the school.</P>
<P>The main character is a senior cadet named Will McLean,
effectively portrayed by David Keith, who looks like a less
severe version of Patrick Swayze. Will is something of a misfit,
and the only reason he is at the school is because it was his
dying father's wish. He has been taken under the wing of the
school's cadet commander, a salty old cigar-chomping colonel
known as Bear (Robert Prosky). Bear asks Wills to keep an eye on
the new black cadet, Pearce (Mark Breland), because Bear knows
there will be trouble, and Pearce will need an older cadet to
stand up for him. Will isn't excited about the idea, but because
of the respect and friendship he shares with Bear, he agrees.</P>
<P>It doesn't take long for the pressure to mount on Pearce - he is
systematically attacked with racial slurs and extreme physical
exercise, but it's really no worse than any of the freshman
"knobs" are getting. However, once "The Ten" get involved,
everything changes. The movie establishes the danger of "The Ten"
by first depicting their physical and mental torture of another
freshman, this one a chubby slacker who ends up throwing himself
off a building in desperation. This suicide is probably the most
gratuitous scene in the film, not because it's graphically
violent, but because once it happens, the character is just
forgotten. (Somehow, I have a hard time believing that if a
military school lost a freshman to suicide in the first week,
there wouldn't be some kind of investigation.)</P>
<P>Before the suicide, Will had never heard about "The Ten." When he
asks Bear about it, Bear is allusive. Was he, perhaps, a past
member? And who are the current members? Infuriated that "The
Ten" are able to break the school's strict codes of conduct at
their leisure, and suspecting that the school itself is secretly
backing them, Will sets out to unmask the group and put a stop to
their reign of terror.</P>
<P>The framework of "The Lords of Discipline" is your typical one
man and his righteousness versus the group and their evil doings.
As directed by Franc Roddam, it's a fairly effective thriller,
although it sometimes feels a bit mean-spirited and sadistic. The
movie was based on a novel by Pat Conroy, the same man who wrote
"The Great Santini" (1979) and "The Prince of Tides" (1991). It
contains Conroy's typically melodramatic and intense treatment of
characters and situations, but there is a strain of realism
because Conroy attended The Citadel, which is the obvious
inspiration for the fictional Carolina Military Institute.</P>
<P>One of the major disappointments in the film is its coarse and
ill-defined treatment of racial matters. It seems that every
single character is racist, even those we're suppose to be siding
with, including Bear, Will, and his three roommates, Dante
Pignetti, a.k.a. "Pig" (Rick Rossovich), Mark (John Lavachielli),
and Trado (Mitchell Lichtenstein). The roommates are ostensibly
on Will's side and therefore on the audience's side as well, but
the movie often makes them quite difficult to like as people. The
movie throws around a lot of racial slurs amongst the roommates
and other caders, but little is ever made of it.</P>
<P>Of course, the story does take place in the South during the
sixties, but does that mean that every white character living in
that time and place was openly racist? At one point, Will and his
roommates are on the verge of getting run out of the school for
their actions against "The Ten," and in his defense Will blurts
out, "I never did it for the nigger!" It almost completely
undermines his credibility as a character, and brings into
question the film's motives.</P>
<P>There's a small scene between Will and Pearce at the end of the
film that tries to smooth everything over, but it feels forced
and phony. Is Will truly proud that the school's first black
cadet might actually make it, or is he just proud of himself for
winning against the system?</P>
<P>In a nutshell, "The Lords of Discipline" wants be titillating
with its sadistic violence and hazing rituals (including Pearce
having the number "10" carved on his back with a knife and a
torture session involving electrodes and gasoline), and then
throw down a firm ruling that it was all wrong. Those who dislike
the military environment could easily point this movie out as a
perfect example of what's wrong with our military system.
However, at the same time, those who support the military can
also use the movie in their defense, citing the fact that when
the cadets play by the rules, everything works. It's only when a
small group takes matters in its own hands that the system gets
out of control.</P>
<P>However, despite the alternating sadistic/righteous tone of "The
Lords of Discipline," there is some fun to be had: watching for
now-famous actors in early roles. Look for Judge Reinhold
("Beverly Hills Cop"), Michael Biehn ("The Terminator," "The
Abyss") and especially Bill Paxton ("Apollo 13," "Titanic"), who
for some reason chose to be listed in the credits as "Wild" Bill
Paxton. Ironically enough, it the two young actors who give the
best performances - David Keith who also starred in "An Officer
and a Gentleman," and Rick Rossovich, who some will remember as
Slider in "Top Gun" - who went virtually nowhere.</P>
