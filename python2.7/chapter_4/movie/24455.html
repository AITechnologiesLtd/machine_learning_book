<P>        It took six writers to concoct ``Anaconda,'' and the fact that
they each wanted to take credit for their contribution is the scariest
thing about this creature feature.</P>
<P>  Imagine being brave enough to claim you penned dialogue that
rarely rises above ``Let's get the hell out of here!,'' or ``What the
hell is going on?,'' as well as a plot that would have seemed hokey
back when Grandma was an ingenue.</P>
<P>  ``Anaconda'' may someday make a great ``Mystery Science
Theatre 3000'' episode, but it's not something most would want on
their resumes.</P>
<P>  The feeble story follows a documentary filmmaking crew down
the Amazon as they search for a lost tribe, ``the people of the
mist.'' You'd have to turn to a WWII combat movie to find a finer
collection of stereotypes: Terri the Latin fireball (Jennifer Lopez),
Danny the cynical homeboy (Ice Cube), Denise the airhead sex-kitten
who proclaims the jungle makes her ``horny'' (Kari Wuhrer), pothead
Gary (Owen Wilson), and Warren the world-weary sophisticate (Jonathan
Hyde) are all on board.</P>
<P>  There's also Steven (Eric Stoltz), a doctor of some sort,
who manages to somehow get a water wasp in his mouth while scuba
diving and spends most of the journey recuperating in bed.</P>
<P>  They're soon joined by Paul Sarone, the scarred mystery man
with a hidden agenda, played with a ridiculous, impenetrable
mock-Venezuelan accent by Jon Voight. It's a performance that should
torpedo any dreams he has of making a comeback.</P>
<P>  As the title signifies, large snakes are also part of the
goings-on.  After Sarone hijacks the boat, Terri and company find
they're heading into a part of the river so dangerous the natives have
built a wall, a la ``King Kong,'' to contain the danger.</P>
<P>  Of course, had Sarone simply turned the craft around,
``Anaconda'' would only be about 45 minutes long, so you can bet the
barrier is dynamited, the cruise continues, and the audience is soon
taking bets on who'll be the first meal.</P>
<P>  An opening title informs us that anacondas will sometimes
regurgitate their victims, just to have the pleasure of devouring them
again: Yes, friends, prepare for the awesome spectacle of a vomiting
giant serpent!</P>
<P>  ``Anaconda'' is the follow-up to director Luis Llosa's last
masterwork, ``The Specialist,'' a 1994 clunker that marked a new low
even for Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone. Rest assured that taking
a few years off has not sharpened Llosa's skills one iota. His knack
for clumsy action sequences remains intact, and his chronic ineptitude
makes most of ``Anaconda'' an unintended laugh riot.</P>
<P>  Even the special effects don't pass muster. The anacondas,
created through animatronics and computer animation, often look more
showy than scary, even though the sextet of scribes have gone to
admirable lengths to devise inventive deaths for most of the cast.</P>
<P>  It's a shame the performers didn't all follow Voight's lead
and head straight to camp. Hyde and a smirky Stoltz ham it up
admirably, but the ever-mumbly Cube is lifeless, and Lopez makes the
mistake of acting as if she's in a real movie. Check your script,
girl: It ain't ``Selena,'' it's ``Anaconda''!</P>
