<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Agnes Varda's first color film is shot in very warm and pleasing pastel
hues, capturing the beautiful French countryside and the ordinary
dwellings where the family featured resides. The Mozart playing in the
background instills a dream-like magic into the lush natural settings.
This film won the Special Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival in
1965.</P>
<P>What makes this film somewhat unique, is that Jean-Claude Drouot's real
wife and kids portray his movie spouse and offspring.</P>
<P>If the story is controversial, as it has been deemed by the reaction the
film received when it opened, it can only be because a woman directed
something that men have just assumed is in their exclusive province to
do, that is make a film about a married man who takes a mistress.</P>
<P>The film opens with the happy family of Francois and his lovely
redheaded wife Therese, and their two little children, the cute little
girl Gisou and the older brother Pierrot, all having a wonderful weekend
in the country. Marital bliss cannot be more idyllic than as it is shown
on this picnic.</P>
<P>When the family returns home to their small-town of Fortenay, their
uncle and aunt warmly greet them. We soon learn that Francois is a
carpenter, working in his uncle's place and that his wife stays home and
does odd jobs as a dressmaker.</P>
<P>Francois is asked to go to Vincennes and check on a building site, and
while there he meets an attractive blonde postal clerk, Emilie, who is
about to transfer to his hometown. As soon as she moves, she has him use
his woodworking skills to put in some shelves and they waste no time
falling passionately in love. This affair goes on secretly for a month,
but is eating away at Francois because he makes a big deal about never
lying. He told his mistress that he loves his wife and he rationalizes
his love for her by saying, I love you both and if I met you first, you
would be my wife.</P>
<P>Spoiler to follow: If you don't want to know the main event in the
story, skip the next paragraph and go on to the last paragraph.</P>
<P>On another of his idyllic family picnics, he tries to explain to his
wife how he loves her and loves his mistress, trying to convince her
that she comes first, that if she doesn't want him to have a mistress,
he will let her go. But she senses that he wants both of them and gives
her quiet assent. After they make love in the woods, he takes a
contented nap and when he is awakened he discovers his wife missing and
that she drowned in the fishing pond. He then has his mistress
seamlessly take his wife's place and the idyllic family picnics continue
as if nothing has happened.</P>
<P>This is a very sensual and visually satisfying film, one that shows how
each of the characters is stuck in their own romantic dream-world. It
might not have a very absorbing tale to tell, but it packs a more
deep-seated emotional charge than what might appear at first glance. For
Varda, chance is a more of a reason people get married and stay married
than love.</P>
