<P>   There's something awfully scary about this movie. 
"Conceiving Ada" is not eerie like, say, "I Know What You
Did Last Summer," and in fact for maturity and intellectual
depth it's not even on the same planet as that high-school
adventure.  Nor does writer-director Lynn Hershman Leeson
spook us in the manner of James Whaley, who conceived not
Ada but the Bride of Frankenstein.  What's frightening is that
"Frankenstein" author Mary Shelley's apprehension about
the subordination of human beings by the very mutants we
created is coming ever closer to reality.  Take movies, for
example.  Special effects dominate the youth market more
than ever now, as computer- and video-game savvy kids flock
to theaters for the car crashes and exploding buildings rather
than for the human performances.  What's more a character
like Todd, the title figure played by Kurt Russell in Warner
Bros.' "Soldier," acts so much like an accomplished robot that
Russell himself could have been downsized in favor of an
automaton.  Some visionaries have actually suggested that
many films of the future will be as devoid of living actors as
"Prince of Egypt," with computer-generated substitutes that
look like anything but cartoon figures.</P>
<P>   To some extent that future is here, with "Conceiving Ada"
serving as a breakthrough in cinema technology.  The human
roles are taken by real people, though the part of a dog is
assumed by both a real mutt (who is so ugly that it's cute)
and a computer-generated image of the pooch.  Ah, but the
sets!  Lots of brand-new technological effects are used,
generally created with Photoshop software and added in post-
production.  The actors themselves performed against
nothing more than a bluescreen, photographed with a Digital
Betacam (with the images later transferred to 35mm), and for
the most part the techies then took over.  The computer-savvy
crew utilized 380 photos of Victorian rooms of San Francisco
Bay-area bed and breakfast lodgings plus some still shots of
the actual room once occupied by the daughter of Lord
Byron, Ada, known as Lady Lovelace.  They superimposed
the photos through miscellaneous digital technologies,
colorized them, and mixed it all up in post production.  Lynn
Hershman Leeson, who had done scores of videos before
involving herself in this groundbreaking effort, is just the
person to do the movie, given her techie background and her
desire to restore Ada Byron King to her rightful place in
history.</P>
<P>   Enough about the impressive technology, which you can
read about in the American Cinematographer magazine of 18
September 1998.  The film must stand or fall not on the
cleverness of the set but on the quality of the drama.  
Drama is, alas, its weak link.</P>
<P>   The story deals with Ada Byron King (played by the
remarkable star of "Orlando," Tilda Swinton), who lived in
England during Victorian times (mid-19th century). 
Paralleling Ada's life in many ways is a fictional character of
our own time here in America, Emmy Coer (Francesca
Faridany).  Emmy is a computer programming genius
pregnant by her union with Nicholas Clayton (J.D. Wolfe) and
like Ada is obsessed with work while having a difficult time
dealing with the thought of having children.  While
researching artificial life on her computer, she manipulates
her unit to travel through time and to her utter amazement
hones in on actual scenes from Ada's life which are uploaded
by Ada's own memory.  As acted with grace, eloquence, and
intensity by Tilda Swinton, Ada takes the modern-day
programmer through her experiments with the formation of a
new language, one which could allow the a precursor of the
computer invented by Charles Babbage (John O'Keefe) to do
far more than make computations.  Her intended language
would permit this Analytical Machine to write poetry and
compose music, among other delights.  The passionate Ada
is seen enjoying several love affairs with some of the brilliant
men of her time such as mathematician John Crosse.  But
she feels that because women are accorded no respect other
than as childbearers and homemakers, her discoveries
became credited to the men with whom she worked.  In one
scene, the mortally ill and bleeding Ada is dismissed by her
physician as being merely hysterical, is given opium (to which
she became addicted), and told to "have a child" to get over
her pain.</P>
<P>   With only 85 minutes to tell the story, director Leeson
spends too much time on the character of Emmy, who
dominates the opening scenes, time that could have been
spent more profitably exploring exactly what Ada contributed
to the world of the computer.  We are left with the feeling that
the real work was generally performed by the men who
received the credit, particularly Babbage, who actually built
the device.  We wonder, then, why the Defense Department
named a whole computer language after Ada and nothing
after Charles.  Though Ada frequently exhorts her new friend
from the twentieth century to "save" her, we learn principally
that the salvation is to come by restoring Ada's name to its
rightful place in history and not to deliver her from her painful
illness, indifference to her children, or her feeling that she has
not fulfilled her destiny.</P>
<P>   "Conceiving Ada," for all its technological proficiency,
remains a work too precious for any but the most
sophisticated film buff, displaying Ada's appetite for
lovemaking and obsession with her work but almost devoid of
passion itself.  A vibrant imagination is at work in its creation,
but the film is all intellect--inert from the neck down.</P>
<PRE>Not Rated.  Running Time: 85 minutes.  (C) 1999
