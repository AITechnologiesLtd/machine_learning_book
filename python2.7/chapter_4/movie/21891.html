<P>Starring Janet McTeer, Kimberly Brown, Gavin O'Connor. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Tumbleweeds is very much an actor's movie, one with little going for it
besides the potential for tour de force performances. The script,
indeed, is a thespian's dream, complete with explosive domestic abuse
scenes, teary-eyed monologues and screaming fits aplenty. The
performances from the small-name cast are some of the year's best, an
Oscar goldmine, but the movie itself is predictable and simple.
Certainly not bad, as bad movies go; I was never bored and often times
I found myself engrossed. Still, as one of the characters in it would
probably say, this ain't no gem.</P>
<P>The movie opens with Mary Jo Walker (Janet McTeer, a renowned stage
veteran and Tony Award winner) having a brutal fight with her husband.
He chases her around the kitchen, knocking things over, as she taunts
him to give her a big bruise in the eye "so [her] lawyer can see it."
Right away, she sticks her head into her daughter Ava's room and tells
her to "pack up, we're leavin'!" Ava is way ahead of her, her suitcase
is already half packed and with a roll of the eyes and a groan she gets
into the car and they take off.</P>
<P>You see, this is Mary Jo's fourth marriage and she has had more than
her share of experiences with abusive husbands. She and Ava have moved
around a lot. Ava is sick to death of it and just wants to settle down
in one place, with a father figure or, preferably, without, go to
school, make friends and live a normal life. No can do -- her mother is
a veritable jackass magnet: every guy she marries gets violent with her.</P>
<P>So Ava persuades Mary Jo to move to San Diego, which Ava falls in love
with. They get there. Mary Jo gets a boring but seemingly lucrative
job. Ava goes to school and makes friends. Everything is perfect until
Mary Jo makes really good friends with a sexy trucker named Jack (Gavin
O'Connor, who -- I couldn't believe it, from the looks of the guy --
also directed) and faster than you can say "divorce" they've moved in
together. The relationship seems to be just right at first -- it always
does. But soon we get little hints that everything is not as dandy as
it should be. First, Jack gets really miffed that Mary Jo didn't ask
her about his day. Then he almost has a contusion because of the low
quality of her goulash. Before she knows it he's throwing a hissy fit
in a restaurant.</P>
<P>The characters are attentively developed, interesting and involving.
We're immediately engaged in Mary Jo and Anna's relationship and
dilemma. We grow to hate Jack just as much. There's a distinctively
human quality to these people and that allows for an entry point into
the movie, a place where we can emotionally attach ourselves and then
watch the rest of the movie from that particular viewpoint.</P>
<P>The problem, to the extent that there is one, is that we know how the
movie will end as soon as one of the supporting characters smiles. With
such an interesting array of players, it's a shame to see a script take
such a painfully standard course of action. The experience, then, is a
strange one: we basically know everything that is going to happen
before it actually does and yet we somehow enjoy it. There isn't a
single positive thing I could say about the storyline itself; it's all
in the characterization.</P>
<P>Janet McTeer is terrific in a role that fits her like a glove. She
manages to be imposing and caring at the same time adding a level of
depth to her relationship with her daughter. The daughter is played by
newcomer Kimberly Brown in an intelligent, precocity-free performance.
Also turning in an impressive performance is O'Connor, who is
formidable and rather frightening: just the note his character is
supposed to hit.</P>
<P>Tumbleweeds lacks any real insight into love or life and it certainly
isn't rife with surprises and originality. It is involving and
entertaining, working an all the levels it was supposed to in the first
place. Nothing new, but I'll take it.</P>
