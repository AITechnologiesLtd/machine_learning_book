Susan Granger's review of "SLAM" (Trimark Pictures)</PRE>
<P>Marc Levin's low-budget ($1 million) chronicle of poetry
behind bars justifiably captured the 1998 Grand Jury Prize at the
Sundance Film Festival and the Camera D'Or at the Cannes Film
Festival. Shot on location in Washington, D.C., the film features a
cast of non-actors including controversial Mayor Marion Berry, who
faced a real-life conviction on drug charges, in an ironic cameo as a
criminal court judge. The story follows the spiritual and artistic
journey of a small-time marijuana dealer and rapper, played by
dreadlock'd Saul Williams, who is sentenced to prison after he's
caught fleeing the scene of a drug-related shooting in a ghetto
housing project known as Dodge City. In the grim process of
rehabilitation, he finds love with a reformed prostitute/crack addict,
Sonja Sohn, who becomes his writing teacher and salvation through
"slamming," a combination of poetry and rap. The
story-behind-the-story adds fascination to what's on the screen. Saul
Williams and Sonja Sohn were discovered at a real-life urban poetry
slam and many of the extras were actual prisoners in the D.C. criminal
justice system. One of the film's producers, Richard Stratton, as well
as Bonz Malone, who plays a prison gang leader, cites art as redeeming
him from a life of crime. Cinema verite cinematographer Marc Benjamin
uses a hand-held camera as Marc Levin superimposes a documentary style
on an innovative and topical theme; unfortunately, Levin's delight in
the emotional honesty of his subjects occasionally becomes
self-indulgent and the length of the improvisations can be
stultifying. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Slam" is a fresh,
daring, emotionally challenging 7. It's scary, strong, street-wise
stuff.</P>
