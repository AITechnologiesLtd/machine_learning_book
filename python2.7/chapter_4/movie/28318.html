<PRE>                                BAD SEED
                    A film review by Christopher Null

<P>Despite an atrocious title, I actually held out hope for the
direct-to-video Bad Seed's intriguing premise.</P>
<P>The film opens as man (Luke Wilson) confronts by his wife (Mili Avital),
who screams in admission that she is having an affair.  Enraged, he
storms out of the house.  When he returns, she is dead, and her now
estranged boyfriend (Norman Reedus) is suspect.  So our hero takes
matters into his own hands, finds the boyfriend, and kills him.</P>
<PRE>Only he got the wrong guy.</PRE>
<P>That should be the ending of the movie, right?  Wrong.  That's ten
minutes into the film, and Bad Seed quickly plummets off a cliff right
there and lands in direct-to-VHS hell.  The problem?  There's just no
story left after the intro.  What develops is instead a dumbass cat and
mouse game between Reedus and Wilson, with a sentimental P.I. (Dennis
Farina) along for the ride.  Entire plotlines are resolved, and then new
ones arise, having nothing to do with what you've just seen (presumably
to pad the film beyond sitcom length).  Eventually, the whole ordeal
becomes so contrived you don't know who the titular Bad Seed even is. 
After three or so false endings, you cease to care.</P>
<P>Shot in Seattle's melancholy, permanent rain, Bad Seed successfully
evokes feelings of the tragedy it wants to be.  Too bad the rest of the
movie is not so successful.</P>
