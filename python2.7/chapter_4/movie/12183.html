<PRE>Words Made Flesh</PRE>
<P>Peter Greenaway's THE PILLOW BOOK, a lush, spell-like movie, weaves
together words, flesh, ink, paper, and celluoid. The main character, a
young Chinese woman (Vivian Wu) whose father wrote a poem on her face on
every childhood birthday,
grows up with a fetish for words written on bare skin. At first, she
looks for lovers who will write on her; later, one lover (Ewan
McGregor) convinces her to inscribe her masterpiece (a series of "books"
based on a thousand-year old volume that lists things
which "make the heart beat faster") on his body.</P>
<P>THE PILLOW BOOK is as disturbing as it is pretty. It provocatively draws
analogies between human skin and paper and entrances the viewer's eyes
with beautiful, breathtaking imagery, but it also displays human bodies
as denatured objects. Naked bodies (particularly McGregor's well endowed
naked body) litter the screen, which can be either liberating or cruel,
depending on how one understands Greenaway's use of the human form.</P>
<P>Greenaway's distinctive style is a postmodern cinematic expression of
the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system: multiple
scenes float freely across the screen like lost ships drifting on
celluoid winds. It's an Altman-like concept of cinema seen through
the eyes rather than heard through the ears. Words spill across all of
the images like misplaced subtitles written with a
calligraphy pen.</P>
<P>Sensual and enticing, but ultimately problematic, THE PILLOW BOOK is a
unique vision of immoral beauty.</P>
