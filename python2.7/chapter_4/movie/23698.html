<P>Romeo Must Die (2000) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Jet Li, Aaliyah and
Delroy Lindo.</P>
<P> "Romeo Must Die" is definitely a guilty pleasure movie.</P>
<P> An action-packed, one-two punch of martial arts and hip-hop, the film
marks the starring debut of Hong Kong action star Jet Li.</P>
<P> Li was the main action heavy in "Lethal Weapon IV" and walked away with
the film without so much as a thank you to Mel Gibson and company.</P>
<P> Set mainly around the Oakland waterfront, "Romeo Must Die," as the
title implies, involves two warring families, one black the other
Chinese.</P>
<P> Li is Han, whose father is the head of the Chinese faction. His
co-star, Aaliyah (Trish) is the daughter of the leader of the black
faction.</P>
<P> Han and Trish unite to solve a series of murders, including those of
both their brothers.</P>
<P> Of course the story is mere stuff and nonsense centered around
acquiring waterfront property in hopes of luring an NFL team back to
Oakland.</P>
<P> But you really don't give a hoot about the plot. </P>
<P> All you really want to see is Li kick butt, face, stomach, groin and
other body parts. And he does plenty of that.</P>
<P> The problem with "Romeo Must Die" is a lack of action. There is too
much dialogue and too little Li. Not that he is much of an actor. His
feet and hands usually do the talking for him.</P>
<P> And some dialogue is needed for exposition, but you merely tolerate
those scenes waiting for Li to again knock the heck out of some smirking
wise guy who can't see beyond Li's calm facade.</P>
<P> He is a tiger. The fight sequences are a superb melding of choreography
and editing. At times it looks as if Li is defying gravity.</P>
<P> "Romeo Must Die" is not a movie for serious filmgoers. But fans of this
genre will have a field day.</P>
<P> With Chow Yun-Fat and Jackie Chan also making movies for American
studios, some enterprising studio boss should try to develop a script
utilizing the talents of all three.</P>
<P> Now that would be a cinematic battle royal.</P>
