                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     LORENZO'S OIL is based on the true story of Augusto Odone (Nick
Nolte) and his wife Michaela (Susan Sarandon) as they fight to save the
life and sanity of their son Lorenzo (Zack O'Malley Greenburg).
Lorenzo, diagnosed in early 1984 as a victim of ALD, an incurable
degeneration of the brain, is beyond the help of conventional medicine.
His parents, unwilling to give up the struggle even after participating
in several failed therapies, begin their own investigation of the
disease.  LORENZO'S OIL follows the triumphs and tragedies of this
search.</P>
<P>     The film is unique in that it avoids the most obvious trap--that
of becoming a melodramatic, tear-jerking soap opera.  Instead of
focusing primarily on a family being torn apart by guilt and pain,
LORENZO'S OIL follows Augusto and Michaela's attempts to understand
their son's disease and discover a method of treatment.</P>
<P>     The search is fascinating, a unique odyssey of discovery.  Even
though it delves into medical terminology that few laymen will grasp,
simple metaphors, such as those of a kitchen sink and a chain of paper
clips, are used to explain clearly and concisely the causes and effects
of ALD.  Comprehension is necessary to the success of the film, and
LORENZO'S OIL overcomes with little difficulty what might seem a
troublesome barrier.</P>
<P>     The script is written for the thinking movie-goer.  Someone who
sits back and passively absorbs what is shown on the screen is likely to
become bored.  However, for the viewer willing to invest energy in
understanding what LORENZO'S OIL has to offer, a captivating experience
awaits.  We are drawn into the search and its revelations.</P>
<P>     LORENZO'S OIL is at its weakest when it steers away from the
investigation to present "character moments."  Most of these scenes are
of the hit-and-miss variety, some working while others fail to convince.
The only example of overacting in the film comes in one of these moments
when Nolte's Augusto slides down a flight of stairs, howling in agony.
His pain is telegraphed with all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
Fortunately, the overall success of the film is only peripherally
affected by these instances.</P>
<P>     The characters of Augusto and Michaela are developed successfully
through the search scenes.  Lorenzo is less of a person than a plot
element (we know little more about him than that he is a good-natured
boy who has come down with a rare, debilitating disease), and most of
the other men and women populating the film are as well-rounded as the
story demands.  The actors are competent in their roles.  Sarandon and
Nolte have both given more emotive, effective performances in the past,
and Nolte's ridiculous Italian accent is hard to get used to (perhaps a
little cinematic license should have been used to eliminate it).  Only
Zack O'Malley Greenburg stands out.  Equal credit must be shared between
him and director George Miller for creating such a heartfelt and
believable performance.  For an adult, acting of this caliber would be
noteworthy; for a child, it is astounding.</P>
<P>     Much of LORENZO'S OIL is based on true events, but there are at
least a few moments when Hollywood intrudes, creating occasional leaps
of exultation that are contrived (such as what happens when the results
of Lorenzo's Oil are revealed to a group of ALD parents).  Fortunately,
the director/writer team of George Miller and Nick Enright have curbed
excesses in this area.</P>
<P>     Pacing is uneven, due mainly to the mix of the "character moments"
with the overall story.  The film is a little longer than it needs to
be, but not greatly to the movie's detriment.  LORENZO'S OIL is a
well-crafted motion picture.  It is not a tear-jerker, preferring to
stir emotion through its characters and the realization of their
situation rather than through audience manipulation.  Above all,
however, it is a film about the victory of hope through perseverance--
and one that brings its viewers along to observe each battle.</P>
