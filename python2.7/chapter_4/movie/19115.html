<P>Adam Sandler's movies are sort of like watching a performer on amateur
night at your local comedy club.  They serve a purpose (to make you
laugh, although just barely), and you hope that the next time you see
that particular comedic performer that he or she will be better.  In
fairness, Sandler has had some hysterically funny scenes recorded on
film.  The Sandler vs. Bob Barker bout in 'Happy Gilmore', Sandler
singing in the shower to Damon Wayans in 'Bulletproof' and Sandler
tackling a Colonel Sanders look alike in 'The Waterboy'.  When I'm alone
and reflect on the comedy films I've seen in the past few years, these
moments always make me laugh out loud.  Like other over rated comics
such as Jim Carrey and Martin Short, Sandler gets under your skin after
a while and I'm sure there will come a time when some people who support
the work of these guys will protest the motion picture academy to create
an Oscar category entitled "Best Performance By An Actor In A Silly
Role".</P>
<P>'Big Daddy' will offend some people who cling to the idea of traditional
family values and they will attack the film for setting a bad example
for children and while I'm one of the biggest supporters of family
values, this assumption would be wrong.  The movie IS NOT about teaching
the wrong values to impressionable children but rather one man making
the mistake of under estimating their impressionable minds and redeeming
himself by correcting the problem.</P>
<P>In 'Big Daddy', Sandler plays Sonny Kofaux, a man in his early thirties
who has all the qualities of a generation x-er.  He sleeps late, very
late.  He takes few things seriously in his life and doesn't quite
understand just where it is he fits in.  His apartment is a mess.  He
leaves potato chip bags and pop cans everywhere, never makes his bed and
won't fix the broken window next to the front garage like door of his
Manhattan apartment.  Sonny won $200,000 from a jury in a civil case
after a taxi cab ran over his feet and this accounts a lot for his
laziness and he has a one day a week job as a toll booth collector.  His
girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) wants a more serious guy and ditches
him like Bill Murray's girlfriend did at the beginning of 'Stripes',
accusing him of never being able to do anything more with his life than
he's presently doing.  Sonny's room mate Kevin (Jon Stewart) is a big
time corporate honcho about to become a liaison executive for his
company in China.  After Stewart leaves, a little boy shows up at their
front door with a note claiming to be Kevin's son.  In Kevin's absence,
Sonny assumes his identity and tries to raise the little five year old
by himself with difficulty at first but later becomes attached to him
and vice versa.</P>
<P>Sonny life is layered with some interesting characters.  There is
Kevin's fiancée Corinne (Leslie Mann), Corinne's sister Layla (Joey
Lauren Adams) who develops a romantic relationship with Sonny.  A
foreign delivery man who speaks broken English and who befriends Sonny
(Rob Schneider).  A totally uproarious performance by Steve Buscemi as a
homeless guy who likes McDonald's food and Sonny's dad who's a hot shot
lawyer and wants his son to follow in his footsteps (Joseph Bologna).</P>
<P>I never lie and I have to admit that strangely, I enjoyed 'Big Daddy'.
I liked it because there are many characters who hold their own with
Sandler and actually upstage him on many occasions, especially the
Sprouse twins (Cole and Dylan) who play the five year old boy named
Julian at the center of the film's story line and emotional core who
simply steals hearts.  And the other supporting characters save this
film from being a total comedic misfire.  As you're watching the
courtroom climax scene, it is definitely silly and plays like camp
comedy but since this is the intention, it works!</P>
<P>'Big Daddy' is written by Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler and
is directed by Dennis Dugan and Sandler is one of the executive
producers and doesn't look as if he wants total control over the film
this time and gives the entire cast a fair shake and by violating the
first rule of show business that states you should never follow the act
of animals or children, Sandler mixes the innocence of the latter with
his own roadhouse humour and comes up with a mildly pleasing winner.</P>
