<PRE>Rain on the Parade
The Last September</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>Beautifully filmed, "Last September" has the feeling of an impressionistic
painting. The setting is that of the last days of the ruling "tribe" of
Ireland back in 1916 as the Irish begin to revolt. But the primary story is
at play in young Lois, a member of the elite, pursued by an innocent British
soldier, but allured to the roughened Irish renegade she had known as a
child.</P>
<P>Despite the text preface, this ruling "Tribe" scenario may still be a bit
confusing to those not privy to UK history. It certainly was for me. For
that reason, here is further explanation from the film's production
material: They are "the Ascendancy ... moneyed, graceful and essentially
feudal. The Anglo-Irish aristocracy (the wealthier heirs of English
immigrants in Ireland, who sound and appear English, although they consider
themselves Irish)."</P>
<P>Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon are superb in their proper snootitude. Fiano
Shaw gives a flawless performance as Lois' influential confidant. In fact,
most of the acting, direction, and cinematography are remarkable. It's the
culmination of the story that falls flat against this disciplined canvas.</P>
<P>Director, Deborah Warner's portrayal of the sheltered, ignorantly bliss
elite is as delicate and beautiful as the shell of an Easter egg -- inviting
friends over for a tennis party while the countryside trembles on the verge
of war.</P>
<P>Lois, herself, is carefree, emotion-driven, spur of the moment; and for that
we all fall in love with her. With giddily attractive dialogue
like..."You're so sudden all of a sudden." and "How do you know I'm not in
love with some married man or something." These lines are delivered in a
completely sweet and romantic scene with her innocent soldier-caller. This
stunning moment is followed by a charming chat with the experienced yet,
sensitively-humored, older woman.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, by the end of the film our patience with both Lois and this
oft-used story line may not be so sympathetic.</P>
