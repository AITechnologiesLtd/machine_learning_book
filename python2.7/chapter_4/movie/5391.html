                       A film review by Randy Parker

<P>        In director Mike Nichols' WORKING GIRL, Melanie Griffith plays a
secretary in Manhattan, the type who wears running shoes and socks over her
nylons as she commutes to work and then changes into high heals once she
gets there.  Her greatest desire is to be respected for her mind as well as
for her pretty face and shapely body.  She has big ideas but no one will
listen to them.  And to top it off, her macho chauvinistic boyfriend,
played by Alec Baldwin, is cheating on her.</P>
<P>        But Griffith's fortunes turn when her new boss has a skiing
accident and is laid up in the hospital for two weeks.  Griffith uses her
boss' absence as an opportunity to implement her own innovative business
scheme.  She joins forces professionally and romantically with Harrison
Ford, who plays a struggling investment broker.  Ford is outstanding in his
role as a bumbling and ruffled, but charming, bachelor.  He demonstrates
once again his unheralded versatility.</P>
<P>        WORKING GIRL is a contemporary Cinderella story, but one with a
corporate twist.  Instead of a ball, we get a board room.  Mr. Charming is
not a prince, but a broker.  And the evil stepmother is an executive in
"Mergers and Acquisitions" who is happy to steal an idea and call it her
own.  Although the movie may not generate much in the way of deep drama or
high comedy, it succeeds beautifully as a fairy tale.</P>
<P>        WORKING GIRL is a showcase for Melanie Griffith.  Nichols takes
every opportunity to show off her cleavage, her curves, and her captivating
blue eyes.  But Griffith's role calls for much more than mere sex-appeal,
and there is more to her character than meets the eye.  Griffith gives a
solid, even impressive, performance as the intelligent, ambitious, and
resourceful secretary who wants to raise her social stock.  Whereas
Griffith's character is someone we can root for, Sigourney Weaver's is
someone we can love to hate.  Weaver turns in a bravura performance as
Griffith's cool, calculating, and back-stabbing boss.</P>
<P>        The secret to WORKING GIRL's success lies in its inspired casting.
Griffith, Weaver, and even Ford--who is playing against type--are perfect
in their roles.  And Joan Cusack is weird and wacky in yet another small
supporting part.  I bought into this simple Cinderella story primarily
because the characters and performances captured me hook, line, and sinker.</P>
