<P>   Christian Slater confesses that at one point in his life he
was so high on cocaine that he almost committed suicide.
Robert Downey, Jr. is busted once again for cocaine use.  No
problem.  Not only does public notice of infractions 
embarrass the rich and famous not a whit: but Mr. Slater had
no problem getting the starring role in both the movie "Very
Bad Things" and the Broadway play "Side Man" while Mr.
Downey may do very bad things with Annette Bening in the
upcoming "In Dreams."  </P>
<P>   In an interview relating to his current film "Celebrity,"
Woody Allen cautions that far fewer than 1% of us will ever
be luminaries.  The usual rules don't apply to them.  They get
busted, they get written up in the tabloids, no problem.  When
ordinary people are caught doing naughty things, they pay a
heavy price.  So why would so many ordinary people would
give their lateral incisors for a chance to appear on the Jerry
Springer show, to make fools of themselves fist-fighting and
hairpulling their adversaries in front of 25 million people? 
That's the question that must be in the mind of every viewer
who eavesdrops on the two sets of contestants who are
chosen among the thousands of other prosaic people writing
in to the station begging to be interviewed by the nation's
leading daytime talk show host.  By the time the movie is
over we don't quite get a handle on the why, but we see
more than we want to know of the what and how.  In
"Ringmaster," Jerry Springer plays Jerry Farrelly, a thinly
disguised version of himself, a handsome, dignified man who
looks more like someone chosen to replace David Susskind
than a guy who acts as the moderator of a veritable circus of
clownish pugilists. If a Martian came to town (presuming that
only someone from another planet has never seen the TV
show) he'd wonder how such a decent-looking, almost
prosaic dude ever got to surpass Oprah in the ratings in such
a display of lowbrow antics.</P>
<P>   The story focuses primarily on trailer folks living near
Tampa, Florida, the 19-year-old Angel (Jaime Pressly) and
her 34-year-old mother, Connie (Molly Hagan).  We're not
surprised that they compete for the same men, given the
ridiculously small age difference. No sooner does Angel turn
her back on her unemployed second husband Rusty (Michael
Dudikoff) then Rusty and his stepdaughter Connie are at it. 
When Connie discovers the liaison, she doesn't throw the two
cheaters out. She gets her revenge by pursuing an affair with
Angel's slow-witted boyfriend Willie (Ashley Holbrook) and by
conning the three of them to join her on the Jerry show where
they can let out their frustrations in the most public way
possible.</P>
<P>   The film also features an African-American quartet due to
appear on the following day: Demond (Michael Jai White)
who strays from his girl friend Starlette (Wendy Raquel) by
being involved with Vonda (Tangie Ambrose) and
Leshawnette (Nicki Micheaux).  With all these characters and
a handful of producers to deal with, movie director Neil
Abramson scarcely has time to spotlight Jerry himself, though
we do get to hear a summing up of the showman's entire
philosophy when an audience member challenges the nature
of the TV program.</P>
<P>   A good deal of the movie is downright gross, particularly in
the very beginning when two well-endowed women tongue
kiss with each other and join their mutual boyfriend on his lap
to the wild cheers of the young, working-class peanut gallery. 
While the black women are portrayed as absolute
stereotypes--singing and dancing on the flight to L.A.,
shrieking and fighting and bonding and dissing their shared
boy friend--Molly Hagan turns out the one sentimental
performance.  She's 34, she has a trashy daughter who, in
her motel job, is prepared to be Monica Lewinsky to any
guest looking for a good time, and she must put forth all her
charm to get affection from the men in her life who think that
19 marks the limit of a girl's attractiveness.  She runs a small
concession near her trailer, perhaps depending on her
daughter to bring home enough to survive while at the same
time seething with resentment at playing second fiddle to
Angel.  For his part, Jerry uses the film to show, albeit in
patronizing way, how he is at once above all the brawling and
yet wants to give a regular slice of America a chance for 15
minutes of fame--or infamy.  Counterattacking an audience
member who could be a backer of the religious right and who
calls the contestants scum, Jerry launches a defense: "This is
a slice of American life, and if you don't like it, bite something
else." He seems truly to think that he is giving a well-earned
break to people who would go through life unsung and
unacclaimed were it not for their broadly televised display of
dirty laundry.</P>
<P>   All of this encourages me to make a confession.  I am the
only adult American who has never seen the Jerry Springer
show.  The movie does not influence me to hang around on
any afternoon to see even a single episode.  Yet I liked this
film for the vigor of the guests, for the abandon with which
they stake their claim to ignominy, for an understanding of
the emotional gap that influences these middle Americans to
give Jerry a call even if their only material gain will be their
first plane trip, their first stay in a first-class hotel, their first
time away on vacation with their contentious families.</P>
