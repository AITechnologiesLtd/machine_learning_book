<PRE>THE TAO OF STEVE
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2000 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>        In order to be successful with the ladies, you have to have the Tao
of Steve, otherwise you're just a Stu.  So preaches "The Tao of Steve," an
independent first feature by director Jenniphr Goodman about an overweight
Santa Fe slacker who, for some unimaginable reason, women find irresistible.</P>
<P>        Certainly it's not his dining etiquette.  Ice cream, chocolate
sauce, and Readi-Whip go straight from the refrigerator into Dex's
mouth--no dinnerware necessary.  And don't forget to save some for the dog!</P>
<P>        Among those who fall for the pot-smoking yet high-on-existentialism
Kindergarten teacher are the wife of one of his best friends and a plucky
young student tending bar at the Ten Year Reunion which opens the film.
Dex is cool, Dex is hot, and when it comes to women, Dex has it all figured
out.  But then someone like Syd (Greer Goodman), a theatrical set designer,
comes along and suddenly Dex has more questions than answers.</P>
<P>        It's a cute idea for a silly movie but, sadly, "The Tao of Steve"
hits two major stumbling blocks: sub-standard actors and a sub-standard
script.  Most of the performers here are rank amateurs and come across as
such.  These, unfortunately, include Donal Logue as the portly Dex, who's
asked to carry the weight of the movie along with his own bulk, and the
task is just too much for him.  The best performer in the film is co-writer
Greer Goodman which is encouraging because she's also the director's sister.</P>
<P>        The script, by the Goodmans and Duncan North (based on North
himself, according to the end credits), isn't as clever as it should be.
If you have to explain who the Steves (Steve McGarrett, Steve Austin, and
Steve McQueen) who give the Tao of Steve its name are, then you're playing
to the wrong audience.  Constant name calling ("Hey, Martha Stewart"
someone quips while Dex prepares his aphrodisiacal mango mahi-mahi) doesn't
make your script hip either--there's way too much of this and not enough
meaningful jingoism.</P>
<P>        Is Dex as cool as he thinks he is?  Syd certainly seems impervious
to his charms.  But as soon as Dex starts spouting his Zen philosophies and
espousing the seductive merits of Kierkegaard, she too is all over him.  So
whatever couple conflicts the scriptwriters initially dreamed up soon
deteriorate into more of the same: Dex has got It.  Although he can barely
hold down a job, with the Tao of Steve in his repertoire Dex can sure hold
down the babes.  By the time this film is over you'll be asking yourself
"Why?"</P>
<P>        As lightweight as its central protagonist is overweight, "The Tao
of Steve" is an amiable little picture that bumbles along harmlessly all
the while banking on the new age affability of its lead Logue.  It is,
however, only occasionally successful in making pertinent observations
about the ongoing battle of the sexes.</P>
