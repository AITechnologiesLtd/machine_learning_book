<P>     I've been hearing people refer to the new film adaptation of LES
MISERABLES as "Lay Miz," which goes to show what the common frame of
reference is going to be.  That abbreviated moniker comes, of course, from
Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's immensely popular musical
adaptation, which has been selling out theaters around the world for over
a decade.  Millions of people already know the story of a convict named
Jean Valjean, whose twenty year struggle to build a new life after his
release from prison is thwarted repeatedly by a monomaniacal police
inspector named Javert.  They already know of the romance between
Valjean's adopted daughter Cosette and a rebel leader named Marius.  They
already know of a civil war in the Paris streets somewhere beyond the
barricades.  They know all this not so much because they are familiar with
Victor Hugo's novel, but because of that musical with its signature
waif-and-tricolor iconography.</P>
<P>     Bille August's straightforward rendering of LES MISERABLES makes you
realize exactly why the story works so well as grand opera.  The
screenplay by Rafael Yglesias (FEARLESS) efficiently streamlines the
narrative, following Valjean (Liam Neeson) from his conversion at the
hands of a kindly bishopto his life as a businessman and mayor to his
decade hiding out in a Paris convent, all the while hounded by the
relentless, unforgiving Javert (Geoffrey Rush).  Along the way he cares
for a destitute young woman named Fantine (Uma Thurman), and eventually
becomes the guardian of Fantine's daughter Cosette (Claire Danes).</P>
<P>     The film is certainly faithful to most basic events of the novel,
though it cuts certain characters entirely and chops other encounters down
to a bare minimum.  It's not textual fidelity which is lacking in LES
MISERABLES; it's emotional scope.  Virtually every scene feels muted, the
passions tamed to a state of dignified dissatisfaction.  What LES
MISERABLES really needed was for someone, anyone, to break into song.  The
stage production captured the sweeping melodrama of Hugo brilliantly --
the battles carried a tragic grandeur, the conflicts shook the foundations
of society, and the deaths were moments to jerk tears from the driest
eyes.  There is no substitute for the kind of dramatic economy music or a
well-constructed song can provide; three minutes of furtive conversation
between Cosette and Marius (Hans Matheson) can't create nearly the
convincing sense of love at first sight that three minutes of "In My Life"
does.  The film seems to have been crafted and edited strictly to make
sure certain necessary plot details were included, with little interest in
building momentum towards a cathartic release.</P>
<P>     From a certain standpoint -- one with no musical preconceptions in
the way -- LES MISERABLES is perfectly effective as period drama, and a
fine introduction to the classic story.  Technical credits are first rate,
with costumes by the gifted Gabriella Pesucci (THE AGE OF INNOCENCE) and
effective recreations of 19th century Paris.  The exceptional cast does
generally sharp work, particularly Rush in a more interesting and subtle
performance than his Oscar-winning showcase of tics and flourishes in
SHINE.  Often, however, it feels as though August is keeping them all on a
leash, eschewing musical theater in favor of "Masterpiece Theater."
There's no real power to the film, nothing which suggest the popular
response inspired by the musical.  I suspect that the only viewers who
will be genuinely satisfied with LES MISERABLES are those who don't come
in with radically different expectations in mind...expectations most
succinctly expressed by the two syllables "Lay Miz."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 less MISERABLES:  5.</PRE>
