<P>   If Eric Heumann, who wrote and directed "Port Djema," had
the writing talent of Albert Camus and the directorial gifts of
Luchino Visconti, what a movie this could have made!  Of
course, the challenge is unfair.  Heumann may have
entertained no plan to equal the great French-Algerian
classic, "The Stranger," made into a movie with Marcello
Mastroianni 31 years ago, but he darn sure conveys a
corresponding ambiance.  "The Stranger" is an existential
novel about a man, Arthur Mersault, who shows no emotion
upon hearing of his mother's death and later goes on to kill
an Algerian during the French occupation of that North
African country.  We say that it's an existential novel because
it deals with a man's apparent lack of purpose in a hostile
environment and the senseless act of violence he commits
against an innocent person.</P>
<P>   While the Visconti film of the Camus novel, "Il Straniero," is
a brave attempt to put a literary work on the screen, "Port
Djema" is its reverse side: a cinematic work that aspires to
tell a story through a succession of images.  It succeeds only
to a degree, its potency marred by the irritating refusal of its
principal character to show his emotions.  It focuses on a
French surgeon, Pierre Feldman (Jean-Yves Dubois), who
leaves his stable practice in Paris to travel to the (fictional)
East African country of Port Djema which, judging by the
Ethiopian Airlines plane which takes him there is actually
filmed in various parts of Ethiopia.  He checks into a
run-down hotel on one of the infinite numbers of unpaved
roads en route to a more rural area.  Since we are aware that
a war is going on in the northern region of the country
between the government forces and a minority clan, the
Assads, we assume that he has traveled there to cater to the
wounded as did his friend, yet another physician who was
shot dead by forces loyal to the government.  Instead, he is
to be considered an existential tourist, one who uses his free
will to find a new meaning in life: to locate a boy whose
photograph he holds and who is said to have been more or
less adopted by his unfortunate friend, Antoine (Frederic
Pierrot).</P>
<P>   While "Port Djema" tells the story of his experiences in a
land so un-western it must be thoroughly alienating to any
European, it relates the simple tale through a series of fragile
images, of chance meetings and untested suspicions.  Who,
we want to know, is this so-called French diplomat, Jerome
Delbos (Christophe Odent), who forces his presence upon the
surgeon and urges him to leave the country quickly?  While
at first he appears to be a friendly counselor looking out for
the interests of the traveler, we soon suspect that he is acting
as an agent of the French, who are enigmatically siding with
the Port Djema government during the day and with the
rebels at night.  And what do we make of Alice (Nathalie
Boutefeu), a lovely, young Swiss photographer who is
traveling alone through hostile territory to photograph the
war?  The enigma is sometimes intriguing, often frustrating: if
Pierre doesn't show that he gives much of a damn despite his
compulsion to travel to dangerous areas (he's too listless
even to make a pass at the girl), why should we?</P>
<P>   Some of the pieces of the puzzle begin to come together
by the conclusion of the story, and along the way our quiet
journey is broken up by gunshots, by the sight of bodies lying
bloodied in the hot desert sands, by the strange spectacle of
a blase surgeon who travels almost mindlessly into
belligerent locales in search of an elusive young boy.</P>
<P>   Eric Heuman has won awards for his direction, perhaps a
testament to his willingness to focus forcefully on a single
individual despite many potential distractions.  We see a
section of an exotic part of the world strictly through his eyes.
"Port Djema" is a spare and elusive picture whose core
audience are viewers who appreciate the ethereal, the
puzzling, the sensitively-paced.  If your foreign travels have
never been existential--that is, if you go only to the high spots
of Europe in search of a little culture and a great time--you'll
have your mind broadened.  You'll follow with trepidation the
jaunt of this bizarre fellow who leaves the prosperity and
safety of a stable city with pleasant climate to risk his very
life in a blazing hell-hole.  On the other hand you may wonder
what Pierre's fuss is all about.  "Port Djema" is a patient
inquiry into the mind of the East African and of one quixotic
Frenchman which eschews melodrama in order to provide a
textured and spare cinematic experience.</P>
