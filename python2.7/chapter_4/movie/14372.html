RUSH HOUR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>RUSH HOUR, regardless of what you may have read, is NOT a Jackie Chan
movie.  Whereas it is true that Jackie Chan, one of the more engagingly
delightful actors around, does appear in the movie, it is not the
typical Chan project to showcase his comedic brand of martial arts
skills.</P>
<P>Director Brett Ratner, director of the widely-panned MONEY TALKS, lacks
much sense of action or comedic timing.  RUSH HOUR drifts aimlessly for
large portions, especially when Chan isn't in the frame.  The script by
Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow has some good laughs, but it isn't written
nearly smart enough and frequently feels the need to sink to bad racial
humor.  Besides making the cops asinine, a key plot twist revolves
around whether to cut the red, green, or blue wire on the bomb.  As
always, the bomb squad, with a one chance in three of being right, will
cut the right wire.</P>
<P>People who haven't seen the talented Chan in action may not be as
disappointed as those who have become his fans.  Non-fans will
undoubtedly enjoy the few times Chan is allowed to cut loose, but those
who have seen him at his best will likely be frustrated.  Chan's charms
come as much from his sweet cherubic demeanor as his athletic skills and
daring stunts.  RUSH HOUR features Chan as an untypically dour character
whose seriousness gets in the way of his allure as an action hero with
childlike innocence.</P>
<P>The movie's plot concerns the kidnapping of the Chinese consul's
daughter in L.A.  When Hong Kong sends their number one cop, Detective
Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan), the FBI decides they don't want him messing
with their case.  The FBI agent in charge calls the L.A. Chief of Police
to get a cop to baby-sit Lee and keep him out of trouble and out of
their hair.</P>
<P>Philip Baker Hall and many other fine character actors are given nothing
to do in the picture but collect a paycheck.  (THE FULL MONTY's Tom
Wilkinson sleepwalks his way through the movie as a criminal
mastermind.)  Hall plays the L. A. Chief of Police who sends the FBI the
loudmouthed officer who has been driving him and everyone else crazy,
Detective James Carter.  Chris Tucker from MONEY TALKS plays the
fast-mouthed Carter.  Viewers' degree of tolerance for Tucker's brand of
over-the-top, slapstick humor will be a major determinate of how much
they like RUSH HOUR.  At times he is extremely funny.  In the best
scenes, as when he and Jackie share dance and martial arts moves to the
rock song "War," their chemistry clicks.</P>
<P>Most of the film plods along with the audience hoping that Jackie will
finally get some more screen time and be allowed to show off his skills.
The only completely successful part of the film is the series of
outtakes shown during the closing credits.  But any film where the
outtakes are dramatically better than the "intakes" is clearly in
trouble.  If the director had thrown out the script, left the set, and
just filmed the characters ad-libbing, he would have had a superior
product.</P>
<P>RUSH HOUR runs 1:36.  It is rated PG-13 for violence and profanity and
would be fine for kids around ten and up.</P>
