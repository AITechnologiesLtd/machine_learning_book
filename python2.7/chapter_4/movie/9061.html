<PRE>Review: L.A. Confidential
A movie review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: 
Curtis Hanson</PRE>
<PRE>Written by:
Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson</PRE>
<P>Starring: 
Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell,
David Strathaim, and Danny DeVito</P>
<P>Ingredients: 1950s Los Angeles; femme fatale; ambitious but naïve
detective; corruption; big complicated city; politics; would be actors
and actresses lured by tinsel town only to become hookers; darkness,
mazes and layers of events left unresolved until the end</P>
<P>Synopsis:
This noir drama portrays the coming of age of two opposing young cops in
1950s Los Angeles (a place where corruption in the law enforcement
system is the rule rather than the exception). Australian actor Guy
Pearce plays naïvely honest young L.A. policeman Ed Exley who is
ambitious for advancement, while fellow Australian Russell Crowe plays
his moral and physical opposite, Bud White, a complex macho cop who does
what he is told (which in 1950s L.A. means turning a blind eye to
racism, planting evidence, and police brutality). Scrawny Exley is
politically motivated but idealistic about the treatment of suspects and
wants to buck the system, while White follows orders because he wants to
see criminals physically abused since his mother was beaten and murdered
by his father when he was a child. Kevin Spacey plays a third
protagonist, jaded celebrity cop Jack Vincennes, who advises a schmaltzy
TV show called ‘Badge of Honor.' On the take, Vincennes has forgotten
the idealism which had originally caused him to join the force.</P>
<P>The movie's first big event features a police brutality scene against
Mexican-Americans in order to showcase the corruption of the era, the
personalities of the three cops, and how they despise each other.  In
the meantime, mobsters are being murdered, and not long afterwards a
retired cop and five victims are massacred at the Nite Owl Café. The
murder is solved, and the apparent perpetrators are gunned down by the
police. Over time and for separate reasons each of the three
protagonists is drawn by events in their own lives to reinvestigate
different aspects of the supposedly ‘solved' case. The main mob boss
Mickey Cohen is in prison. So who could be responsible for the recent
spate of murders of mobsters and retired corrupt cops in California and
why? The answer changes both Exley and White. </P>
<P>Other subplots involve a missing stash of heroin, a sleazy tabloid
editor who pays and gets paid to set people up to commit crimes and
subsequently take the fall, and the rivalry between two cops for the
affections of a beautiful celebrity lookalike hooker (Kim Basinger).</P>
<P>L.A. Confidential is the Warner Brothers movie adaptation of author
James Ellroy's book. </P>
<P>Opinion:
Be careful you don't pause in the middle of the movie to go to the
drinking fountain. If you miss just one small word of the last scene
where Exley explains the situation, this movie is so intricate you might
lose your place.</P>
<P>The story is good and rich with overlapping themes, characters, and plot
strands that seem unrelated at first but tie together somewhat
successfully by the movie's end. In addition characters change
orientation from more corrupt to less or from less corrupt to more,
depending on the character and his stomach for the events that unfold.
In other words this Warner Brothers movie adaptation of James Ellroy's
novel is just as deep and engrossing as the book. </P>
<P>In terms of action, all the gunfights are good, including the big battle
at the end. But there's a definite snag in the movie's pace after the
Nite Owl case is solved when it seems like characters are not strongly
motivated to do anything until the Nite Owl case starts being
reinvestigated. A subplot about heroin remains confusing even after the
movie ends.</P>
<P>All of the actors and actresses in this film did an absolutely marvelous
job in fleshing out their onscreen characters. Russell Crow shines as
the macho cop.</P>
