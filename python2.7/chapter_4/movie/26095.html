<P>     Cameron Crowe's ALMOST FAMOUS -- the writer/director's first film
since 1996's JERRY MAGUIRE -- tallies up its first simple yet thoroughly
inspired moment just seconds into the film, during the opening credits. In
a cute conceit connected to the story's protagonist, a 15-year-old
aspiring music journalist, we see a hand scrawling out the cast on a
yellow pad with a pencil. Among those names is "Frances McDormand," which
the writer initially spells "Francis" before quickly erasing the error and
flicking away the powdered rubber. Not a line of dialogue had been spoken,
and already I was hooked. To crib a line from Crowe's last film, ALMOST
FAMOUS had me at hello.</P>
<P>     Crowe has helmed only four films in his career -- SAY ANYTHING,
SINGLES, JERRY MAGUIRE and now ALMOST FAMOUS -- but I'm tempted to call
him America's most effortlessly gifted film-maker. He scores again with
his semi-autobiographical tale of William Miller (newcomer Patrick Fugit),
a precociously talented San Diego youth with dreams of writing for
national rock and roll magazines circa 1973. His enthusiasm lands him an
assignment for Rolling Stone to write about up-and-coming rock band
Stillwater, led by guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and singer
Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). Against the better judgment of his over-protective
mother (McDormand), William heads out on a cross-country tour with
Stillwater. There he learns about "band-aids" like Penny Lane (Kate
Hudson) who lend inspiration to their favorite musicians, and about the
sex and drugs side of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. He also learns that
it's hard to be a journalist while you also a 15-year-old kid who wants
nothing more than to be thought cool by the members of a rock band.</P>
<P>     There's nothing particularly profound about a coming-of-age story
with a rock 'n' roll backdrop, nor does there need to be. Crowe isn't a
"statement" kind of guy, and it doesn't seem to hurt his films in the
least. ALMOST FAMOUS simply drops us into the world of rock in the early
'70s, and lets us observe through William's wide eyes. And it's a
splendidly rendered world, from the acerbic observations on the death of
rock 'n' roll from William's mentor, Creem magazine editor Lester Bangs
(Philip Seymour Hoffman), to the hotel room parties full of the requisite
mood-altering substances. Like Crowe's other films, this one seems to
amble along in no particular hurry to get anywhere, giving the characters
lots of room to maneuver, yet never feels unfocused or uninvolving. 
Occasionally the loose structure gets in the way, as it does when Crowe
fails to provide enough foundation for Stillwater's burgeoning popularity
either through their music or through their performances. Far more often,
the moment-to-moment experience is too enjoyable for anyone to notice.</P>
<P>     In large part, that moment-to-moment pleasure comes from Crowe's
uncanny ability to direct actors. As he has in his previous films, he puts
together a solid cast and makes magic. McDormand, though she remains a
too-mannered performer at times, is still entertaining as William's
intense mother; Fugit is likeable and innocent in a way that's never 
bland; Hoffman is yet again is so good you just want to throttle Hollywood
for not allowing him to be a star. And then there's the luminous Kate
Hudson (and "luminous" is not entirely metaphorical; she should hire John
Toll to photograph her for the rest of her life). Like William, Penny only
fools herself into thinking it's ever about the music; though she creates
herself as a sort of muse, she's just looking to fill an empty space with
rock 'n' roll's mythology of freedom. Penny is the story's anchor, and
Hudson's facial expressions are so perfect they're heartbreaking.</P>
<P>     As deftly as Crowe handles his story, there are still occasional
missteps. A broadly played scene during a bumpy flight on the band's
private jet veers into silliness, and Crowe never takes a moment to give a
personality to Russell's neglected girlfriend (Liz Stauber). Those tics
and a few others like it might have been more damaging in another film,
made by another film-maker, but ALMOST FAMOUS just seems to absorb its
flaws and roll on. There's something almost hypnotic about the grace with
which Cameron Crowe puts a film together, something that produces winner
after winner. It's not a life-changing experience, not a clockwork plot or
a joke-a-minute script. It's just the pleasure of watching a director who
can suck you in with the brush of an eraser.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Crowe flies:  9.</PRE>
