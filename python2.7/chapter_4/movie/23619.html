<P>"Beyond The Mat" was the only movie I had planned on seeing this 
weekend; Diva had already reviewed "Erin Brockovich" (and I had no 
desire to see that one), I thought "Final Destination" would be too 
scary for me (ObHa: Ha!), and I had seen most of the other flicks 
showing at my local cineplex.  But because a friend suggested I go see 
it when I get a chance, and because I got to the theater too early for 
"Beyond", I found myself watching "My Dog Skip" in the interim.  I think 
I'll go back to sleeping in late on the weekend.</P>
<P>The Story (WARNING: **spoilers contained below**):
Willie Morris (Frankie Muniz), a young boy growing up in Yazoo, 
Mississippi in the 1940s, was the only child of Jack (Kevin Bacon) and 
Ellen Morris (Diane Lane); befriended only by an adult neighbor, Dink 
Jenkins (Luke Wilson), and picked-on by Big Boy Wilkinson (Bradley 
Coryell), Henjie Henick (Daylan Honeycutt) and Spit McGee (Cody Linley), 
Will was a very lonely boy once Dink went off to the Army during World 
War II--until Skip (Moose), a Jack Russell Terrier, came into his life.</P>
<P>The Upshot:
Some books just don't translate well into movies; this one, like "Wonder 
Boys" before it, is one of those movies.  The evidence that "proves" "My 
Dog Skip" is a piece meant to be read more than watched, comes from the 
necessity of the narration by Harry Connick Jr.; as written, if it 
weren't for that narration, the viewer wouldn't have the foggiest about 
what was going on.  Far too many times, we were told, not shown, the 
motivations and actions of the characters; while this is to be expected 
of the dog--after all, he couldn't speak for himself--hearing Connick 
(as Adult Will) tell us over and over again that "Skip made me what I 
am!  He helped me Grow! and Learn! and I kept Learning!" quickly got on 
my last nerve.</P>
<P>It didn't help that bits and pieces of this movie (based on a true 
story) felt like deja vu.  We've seen the Picked-On Boy Battling 
Neighborhood Bullies ("The Boy Who Could Fly"), The Picked-On Boy 
Getting The Girl ("Forrest Gump"),  the Picked-On Boy Getting Over On 
Adult Bad Guys ("Home Alone")--you get the picture.  And the adult 
situations that we've not seen dealt with maturely before in a 
children's story--mainly, how returning vets deal with the effects of 
war--were given such short shrift in lieu of the dog's story [yes, I've 
seen the title.  Still.], they may as well have not been addressed at 
all.  True story or not, if the filming of this story had improved on 
those things we've already seen, or given a new twist to them, it 
wouldn't have been nearly the issue it was with me; but this treatment 
just left me bored, waiting for something to Happen.  It never did.</P>
<P>The movie did have its charms, though.  Muniz looked like he stepped 
right out of a Norman Rockwell painting, and his Southern accent was one 
of the few that stuck around throughout the entire flick; as Rivers 
Applewhite (what a name!), Caitlin Wachs was a very cute partner to 
Muniz;  and the "Show And Tell" scene brought back fond grade school 
memories for me.  Oh, I did so love show and tell...sigh</P>
<P>The one thing that didn't work in its favor was the dog itself.  The 
"actor", Moose, is a regular on the TV series "Frasier"; I love the 
series, but don't care for the dog nor his character there, "Eddie".  
Likewise here in the movie, his "cute" factor quickly wore off, and all 
the poor kiddies drawn in by the cute commercials and trailers, saw 
everything that might possibly get their attention happen in the first 
20 minutes or so; the rest was a rather trite trip down Nostalgia Lane 
for the oldsters amongst us.</P>
<P>I'd hate to think that, for a movie revolving around an animal to be any 
good, said animal would need to be either animated or voiced by a human; 
scoff if you will, but Harry Connick's narration in the place of Danny 
DeVito's voiceover as a dog in "Look Who's Talking Now", isn't much of a 
bargain.  Uh, on second thought...</P>
<P>The "Black Factor"  [ObDisclaimer: We Are Not A Monolith]:
A truly missed opportunity for this movie the came with handling the 
issue--hinted at in the film, but not really addressed--of segregation.  
We saw images on screen of Blacks being made to sit in the balcony at 
the local movie house, and Blacks playing ball separately from Whites, 
but other than a few "Colored people can't do so and so"'s here and 
there, it was as if the viewer was supposed to infer, from past 
knowledge, that there were racial problems in Will's life that he 
probably eventually came to grips with.  But perhaps that's best, after 
all; I guess I should be happy that he wasn't made out to be the Civil 
Rights Crusader like his counterpart in "Crazy In Alabama", but, still.  
But boyo, Will sure did Learn from that dog of his, yessiree bob!</P>
<P>Bammer's Bottom Line: 
I'm sure this was a pretty sweet book.  But as a movie, it just doesn't 
cut it; the kids in the audience were bored after the puppy grew up--and 
most of the adults had already fallen asleep well before then. "A dog" 
pretty much sums it up. </P>
<P>"My Dog Skip" (rating: yellowlight): 
In dog years, that's seven yellowlights.</P>
