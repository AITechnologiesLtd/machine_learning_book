<P>I have vowed several times I would never see another Peter Greenaway film.
And several times, I have fallen prey to his films.</P>
<P>DROWNING BY NUMBERS is a very hypnotic film in that you don't really know
what is going to happen, but you get the feeling that the women will all
win, and get all the men done away with.</P>
<P>This is BLACK COMEDY at its best, much like any of Peter Greenaway's films,
which have a tendency to appear very philosophical and intelectual, though
in actuality, they are just fun, and weird.</P>
<P>The three women are representatives of three generations.  The matriarc of
the bunch ( Joan Plowright ) does what she says, and the film starts by her
drowning her drunken husband who is having an affair with the maid.  And
soon, the daughter has also drowned her husband, and later the young girl
also drowns her lover, because he isn't man enough.</P>
<P>The premise of the film might just be that men, in general, abuse, and do
not care for women.  They like women when it is in their best interest, but
at any other time, the women are secondary, and relegated to the roles of
maid and matron.  And in this film, they take charge and play juror, judge
and executioner.</P>
<P>While this film could be considered threatening to the male ego, it really
is also an attack on the female ego, and the lack of communication both
sexes have almost at all times.  They use each other for their own means,
ways and ideas, and when they are finished, they are discarded.  Men are
notorious for doing that to the fairer sex.  Well, that's not to say that
the women don't do the same.  In the film, both younger women do allow
themselves to be loved by the male counterpart, but they are not all that
happy with the  loving, which is undoubtedly the underlying cause.  When
there are subjects
and servants, there is disdain.</P>
<PRE>And this film is full of it.</PRE>
<PRE>FOR THE FILM BUFF ONLY.</PRE>
