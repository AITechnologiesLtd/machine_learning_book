<PRE>JOHNNY MNEMONIC (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>In 1980s cyberpunk was definitely the most popular sub-genre
of literary science fiction, with plenty of new, young and
talented writers exploring new, dark but fascinating high-
tech world of near future. However, for some strange reason,
the attempts to recreate this world on the screen (with some
notable exceptions) usually fell flat. Not even William
Gibson, the father of the sub-genre, could escape this sad
fate, as demonstrated in JOHNNY MNEMONIC, 1995 screen
adaptation of his best known short story, directed by Peter
Longo.</P>
<P>The plot is set in 2021, in a world run by multinational
corporations, where the information is the most valuable
commodity. Because of the hackers, the most precious
information is not transmitted via Internet, but by human
couriers with implanted memory chips in their heads. One of
those couriers is Johnny (played by Keanu Reeves), whose is
greedy and agrees to double capacity of the chip and risks
having his own brain melting down. While he carries
information from Beijing to Newark, rival corporation has
hired yakuzas led by Takahashi (played by Takeshi Kitano) to
steal the information from his head. The only shelter for
Johnny is the underworld ruled by LoTeks led by J-Bone
(played by Ice-T).</P>
<P>Even those accustomed to the good literature turning into
bad films would be unpleasantly surprised by JOHNNY
MNEMONIC. Gibson, who wrote and produced the film, wasted
almost entire screen potential of his short story. New
characters and subplots were introduced, mostly in order to
provide film with an interesting cast (that includes
Japanese cult director Takeshi Kitano, rock star Henry
Rollins and German actress Barbara Sukowa) and bring
ecological and "politically correct" anti-technological
angle to the story. But all those efforts failed miserably,
not only because those subplots seemed to be artificial
distraction to the story, but also because of the terrible
miscast of wooden Keanu Reeves as protagonist (whose flat
performance is even worse compared to Dolph Lundgren's
hilarious portrayal of homicidal preacher) and tragic choice
of director. First-timer Peter Longo, who had worked on
videoclips, proved to be unsuitable for feature film. Action
scenes are unattractive and repetitive, while special
effects are bad and often turn into boring display of cheap
pyrotechnics. The whole atmosphere of cyberpunk world is
missing from JOHNNY MNEMONIC, and anachronistic soundtrack
by Michael Danna and Brad Fiedel doesn't help either.
Because of all that, JOHNNY MNEMONIC is one of the worst
cinema failures of 1990s, and the audience really doesn't
have to find out why the fans of the original story
nicknamed this project "Johnny Moronic".</P>
