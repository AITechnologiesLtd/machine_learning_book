<PRE>                                BABETTE'S FEAST
                       A film review by Lons Ponschock
                        Copyright 1995 Lons Ponschock</PRE>
<PRE>A film by Gabriel Axel
>From a book by Isak Dinesen
Rated G for General Audiences</PRE>
<PRE>              "Babette says dinner is served."</PRE>
<P>     I eat a lot of junk food.  It's part of my current lifestyle.  But
I've also experienced fine dining and know the joys of it.</P>
<P>     BABETTE'S FEAST was the Academy award winner for Best Foreign Film
in 1987.  It's in Danish and French with subtitles.  The only reason I
noticed this on the shelf is due to a reference I saw to it on Usenet
in a discussion on the currently released Spanish film called LIKE
WATER FOR CHOCOLATE.</P>
<P>     If you can get past the pieties in the picture (and there are
many) you will find that kernel of excellence which makes its 110
minutes all worthwhile.  Like the truffle and goose pate' wrapped in a
roasted quail, it is a hidden treasure.</P>
<P>     In a village in Jutland, Denmark two sisters live with their
ministerial father, hence the piety often expressed throughout the film
which takes place mostly in 1871.  It was a time in which, as the
narrator says, "Piety was much in fashion."  The sisters befriend a
French woman who has escaped the atrocities of her own country.  What
the sisters don't know is that Babette is one of the premier chefs of
Paris.</P>
<P>     After fourteen years of service, Babette wins a lottery prize.
She then requests to prepare the dinner which will celebrate the
memorial to the minister, long deceased.</P>
<P>     The film is constructed almost like a meal itself with an
appetizer being the love stories of the sisters as young women, the
main course and catalyst which is Babette and the resolution which is
the dinner itself.</P>
<P>     Twelve of the locals who are part of the congregation are invited
to this dinner.  They are used to dining on such things as something
called ale bread: bread soaked in water and a bit of beer then cooked
into a gruel.  Boy, are *they* in for a surprise.  :-)</P>
<PRE>              "...This woman, this head chef had the ability
                  to transform a dinner into a kind of love
                  affair... a love affair that made no
                  distinction between bodily appetite and
                  spiritual appetite."</PRE>
<P>     Babette, you see, is a great artist. And like any artist she takes
this opportunity to do her work.  I was reminded in an incongruous
manner of another film during BABETTE:</P>
<P>     In THE HUSTLER starring Paul Newman from a book by Robert Rosen,
the billiard shark Fast Eddie Felsen has fallen on hard times.  He's
hustling pool in dives on skid row.  As he is trolling for fish, he
lets his opponent win a few games.  The opponent ups the stakes and
says just enough about 'luck' to The Hustler to bring out the artist in
him.  Fast Eddie then delivers one of the great speeches in the film.
He tells this skid row joker in effect, 'You know the game.  Here's
what it's like when it's *great*,' and clears the table of nineball on
the break shot.</P>
<PRE>     BABETTE'S FEAST is like that.</PRE>
<PRE>     I'm sure that they said 'Husker Du' at least once during the
film.  ;-)</PRE>
