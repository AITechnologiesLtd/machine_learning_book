<PRE>                                SAY ANYTHING
                       A film review by Randy Parker

<P>        In many ways, the romantic comedy SAY ANYTHING is a generic teenage
love story--one we've seen countless times before.  It tells the
all-too-familiar story of young love between two recent high school
graduates.  Ione Skye plays Diane Court, the intellectual and socially
reserved valedictorian of her high school class.  She has just been awarded
an extremely prestigious scholarship to attend college in England.  John
Cusack plays Diane's suitor, Lloyd Dobler, an amateur kick-boxer who's
unsure of his future.  He does know one thing, however: he'd like to spend
his summer with Diane.</P>
<P>        Lloyd and Diane are the classic mismatch or odd couple.  He is your
average Joe, unexceptional but for his sensitivity, chivalry, and boyish
charm.  And she, on the other hand, is one of a kind--someone definitely
destined for success.  However, despite their differences, Diane and Lloyd
click as a couple.  He can make her laugh, and she gives him
self-confidence.  They start dating, and the movie follows their tumultuous
on-again-off-again relationship.</P>
<P>        If SAY ANYTHING's premise sounds formulaic and unoriginal, that's
because it is.  The movie doesn't break any new ground, but it's
surprisingly effective nevertheless.  After so many brain-dead treatments
of this material, SAY ANYTHING stands out for its intelligence,
sophistication, and sharp wit.  The movie also adds a unique twist to its
story: namely, one of the most sensitively and touchingly portrayed
father-daughter relationships in recent memory.  Diane is unusually close
to her father; he's her very best friend and confidante.  John Mahoney is
outstanding as Diane's loving and understanding father, a man who
desperately wants only the best for his daughter.  In fact, he's even
willing to cheat the Internal Revenue Service in order to better support
Diane.</P>
<P>        In SAY ANYTHING, Cusack demonstrates once again that he makes an
extraordinarily appealing romantic lead.  His sense of vulnerability,
insecurity, and humility make him seem far more authentic than his brat
pack colleagues, such as Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise.  Cusack is always at his
best when he plays the underdog, as he does in SAY ANYTHING and as he did
in such films as BETTER OFF DEAD and EIGHT MEN OUT.</P>
<P>        Skye, who received considerable attention three years ago for her
role in RIVER'S EDGE, gives a compelling performance as Diane, the troubled
young woman torn between her love for Lloyd and her loyalty to her father
who is under criminal investigation by the IRS.  Skye poignantly conveys
the painful confusion and emotional anguish Diane feels as she falls in
love and asserts her independence from her father.</P>
<P>        SAY ANYTHING pushes the limits of its tired and worn-out
boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back story.  But
unfortunately, SAY ANYTHING fails to say anything terribly new or profound
about young love.  Most of us already know all too well from our own
experience just how exhilarating, terrifying, and painful first love can
be.  However, as I mentioned before, SAY ANYTHING is special not so much
for WHAT it says, but for HOW it says it.</P>
