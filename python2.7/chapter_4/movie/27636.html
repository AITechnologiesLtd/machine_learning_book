Susan Granger's review of "HANNIBAL" (MGM/Universal)</PRE>
<P>  Terrifying, tantalizing Hannibal Lechter is ba-a-a-ck! In
this long-awaited sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991), Anthony
Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role of Hannibal the Cannibal. "I
have been in a state of hibernation for some time," he explains. His
portrayal is brilliant, capturing the diabolical doctor's subversive
charm and baroque wit, particularly as he's about to dissect another
victim. In this alibi-ridden world, perhaps what makes this
sociopathic serial killer so appealing is that he never makes excuses
for his evil behavior or his gruesome gourmet palate with a decided
preference for "free-range rude." Instead, he exudes a scary
integrity, augmented by director Ridley Scott's penchant for grisly,
highly stylized pieces of violence that reach operatic extremes, even
though the plot is a bit confusing.</P>
<P>   Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as the courageous,
incorruptible FBI agent Clarice Starling with whom Hannibal is
infatuated. An unrecognizable Gary Oldman plays the hideously
deformed, malevolent pedophile, Mason Verger, whose face was devoured
by dogs. Plus, there's Ray Liotta as a slimy, corrupt Justice
Department official and Giancarlo Giannini as the avaricious Italian
detective on Lechter's trail in Florence with beautiful Francesca Neri
as his wife. Frankie R. Faison reprises Lechter's former hospital
orderly, Barney. At the request of the film-makers, I will not reveal
the conclusion to this disturbing, often sadistic, thriller except to
say that screenwriters David Mamet and Steve Zaillian contribute their
own cinematic twist which may surprise even those who have read Thomas
Harris's novel. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "Hannibal" is a
scary, suspenseful 7 - and this scalpel slicing is definitely not for
the squeamish.</P>
<P>   BACKGROUND INFORMATION: "The Silence of the Lambs" won five
Oscars, one of only three films to sweep Best Picture, Director,
Actress, Actor and Screenplay - and made more than $130 million at the
box-office. And "Hannibal" is actually Thomas Harris's third novel
featuring the fearsome Lechter, who made his first appearance in "Red
Dragon" (1981), which became the movie "Manhunter" (1986). For those
who are curious how an Orion Pictures release wound up as a
MGM/Universal release, it's because, when Orion folded, MGM bought it
s library which included "Silence." Meanwhile, Universal had made a
deal with Dino De Laurentis for the rights to "Hannibal" and, when
former Universal executive Chris McGurk took over the reins at MGM,
the two studios opted to share the financial risks - with De Laurentis
producing. Also included in this complicated deal were Universal's
theme-park rights to MGM's James Bond and Pink Panther characters.</P>
