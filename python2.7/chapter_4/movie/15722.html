<PRE>ELIZABETH
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Elizabeth is a loose biopic of the early years of Queen Elizabeth I. It
may be a period piece, but it sure doesn't feel like one.  Thick with
intrigue, and even thicker with strong performances, Elizabeth is
actually more thrilling than many modern-day "thrillers".</P>
<P>The film starts when Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is merely a princess,
and one in considerable danger.  The problem, you see, is that she is
next in line for the throne...and a Protestant.  She constantly awaits
an execution order from her half-sister, the dying Queen Mary (Kathy
Burke).</P>
<P>Things don't get any easier when Elizabeth becomes queen herself. The
country is in horrible shape, and the political atmosphere is positively
deadly.  She relies on the advice of the cunning Sir Francis Walsingham
(Geoffrey Rush) to avoid the most turbulent encounters:  particularly
the schemes of the Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), who is
constantly plotting her overthrow.</P>
<P>The chief concern of many, including another trusted advisor, Sir
William Cecil (Richard Attenborough), is that Elizabeth marry and
produce an heir.  Only then will her reign be secure.  But the question
remains:  whom to marry?  Marriage alliances with France and Spain
present themselves, but Elizabeth's heart is with Robert Dudley (Joseph
Fiennes), the Earl of Leicester.</P>
<P>Elizabeth is not your typical period piece.  In fact, it has a much more
Godfather-ian feel than the traditional costume drama.  Politics, sex,
murder and deceit are everywhere in this film.  It's not just haughty
people in strange attire...there's a tangible sense of danger that
permeates the film.</P>
<P>The film owes much of its success to the stunning performance by Cate
Blanchett.  She is the heart and soul of the film, and her exciting
portrayal of the young queen proves that it is a strong heart and
vibrant soul indeed.</P>
<P>That's not to diminish the contributions of the remainder of the
splendid cast.  Joseph Fiennes is appealing as the forbidden object of
Elizabeth's desire.  Christopher Eccleston triumphs over a rather flat
character by imbuing him with a truly sinister side. But the true scene
stealer is Geoffrey Rush, whose plots and machinations are a delight as
they unfold.</P>
<P>The sets of Elizabeth are truly a marvel.  Gigantic and sparsely lit,
the shadowy castles, damp corridors and opulent rooms help to establish
the film's moody atmosphere.</P>
<P>Director Shekhar Kapur has created a lush, atmospheric picture, which
(though it takes a few liberties with history) paints an captivating
picture of the slippery slopes of royalty.  Elizabeth is truly a
fascinating film to watch.</P>
