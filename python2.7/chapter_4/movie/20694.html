<P>In the 100-plus years of cinema, the most important, influential and 
long-lasting "movement" (which, like Expressionism, Poetic Realism, 
Neorealism, etc. was  not a real movement-- but I'll skip the 
lecture) was the French New Wave of the late 1950s and the 1960s. The 
best directors and writer-directors included Jean-Luc Godard, 
Francois Truffaut, Alain Resnais, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette, 
Eric Rohmer. They're all unclassifiable, yet for many viewers some 
key words may come to mind: Godard= avant-garde, Truffaut= romantic, 
Resnais= thinker, Chabrol=satirist, Rivette=lengthy, Rohmer=searching.</P>
<P>Abroad, they are all admired film giants. In the United States, 
Truffaut is/was the best-known and by far the most popular; Godard, 
the most imitated (badly); Resnais, by now, little known; Chabrol 
too, though when known, entertaining for his Hitchcockisms; Rivette, 
hardly seen;  Rohmer, beloved by specialists only.</P>
<P>Rohmer, born in 1920, may be even less classifiable than the others. 
His films are talky, as are almost all French movies, but then 
Rohmerian talk is the mainspring of his works, not just an adjunct or 
a part of them. All develop via dialogue, yet there is nothing 
"theatrical" about them. Oddly enough though, Rohmer, who came to 
cinema through literature, is, in original ways, closer to the great 
18th century playwright Marivaux and to the best 19th century French 
playwright, Alfred de Musset.</P>
<P>Most Rohmer movies deal with people, predominantly young and younger, 
who talk of love and get in and out of relationships. And the older 
Rohmer gets the younger his movies seems to be. His characters argue, 
prod, discuss, flirt, advise, shift, all in what appear to be 
ordinary or at least real settings and situations. The movies are low 
budget, non-studio-ish, beautifully shot in cities, beaches, 
apartments and subtly symbolic nature. The dialogues are carefully 
crafted to be convincingly true, as well as improvised.</P>
<P>Rohmer, among his other works, has concentrated in groupings: Six 
Moral Tales; Six Comedies and Proverbs (a la Musset); Tales of the 
Four Seasons, the last and latest of which is Autumn Tale.</P>
<P>It is the story of two women in their mid-40s, best friends for ages, 
in the Cotes du Rhone wine-growing region. The actresses are veterans 
of Rohmer films. The rest of the perfecr cast are unknowns or 
little-known. Magali, a vineyard owner, is widowed with children 
(grownup). Isabelle, a married bookseller, secretly decides that it 
is time for her friend to have a man in her life. In the matchmaking 
process, there are twists and turns, disguises and tricks, surprises 
and shocks, complications,quid pro quos.confusions, mix-ups, and, 
and... No, I will not drop any hints -- see for yourself. It is all 
wonderful, intelligent, subtly sophisticated, clever but not 
smarty-pantsy, touching but not penny-dreadful-sentimental. It is 
funny, humorous and witty.</P>
<P>What's familiar for Rohmer habitués may be that the (at the time of 
filming) 78-year old maker has an unmatched understanding of people, 
including the youths. Also (look at the credits) the importance of 
women as his collaborators. What is new is that Rohmer has upped the 
age of his protagonists. Which brings me to a "review" I ran into but 
I can't find, alas. So I'll give you what I remember. The writer, a 
male, said in effect that the film was dull especially because he 
sees movies to look at beautiful chicks, and the two women 
protagonists were old and homely.</P>
<P>Anyway, Rohmer movies are made for gourmets, sophisticated 
cognoscenti who know their film cuisine.</P>
