<P>     The modern-day family isn't what it used to be.  Households that 
mirror the Cleavers--or even the Huxtables or Seavers--deserve a 
place on the endangered species list.  These days, you're as likely to 
find children shuttled back and forth between divorced parents as 
spending time in a stable, single-family situation.  The fractured family 
and its ramifications lie at the core of BYE BYE LOVE, a new, lighter-
than-a-feather dramatic comedy from director Sam Weisman (D2). </P>
<P>     There are times when the movie's statement about the tragic lot of 
children torn between a mother and father is almost lost amidst the 
upsurge of feel-good sentiment.  Don't expect much substance or depth 
from this film--the few questions it poses are never answered 
satisfactorily, and the story is framed in a manner designed to please 
crowds, not address issues.  There's a saying that laughter is the best 
medicine, and it's certainly true in this case.  BYE BYE LOVE's humor 
obfuscates many dramatic shortcomings.  It's hard to dislike something 
that provokes this many laughs.  Flawed though it may be, the movie does 
a good job filling the "light entertainment" niche.  </P>
<P>     For the most part, the story is told from the male point-of-view.  
We're introduced to a trio of divorced fathers:  Dave (Matthew Modine), 
an incurable womanizer; Vic (Randy Quaid), a fun-loving sort of guy; and 
Donny (Paul Reiser), an insecure dad who wishes that his daughter (Eliza 
Dushku, from TRUE LIES) would confide in him.  Most of BYE BYE LOVE is 
devoted to showing how these three interact with their ex-wives, their 
children, their current significant others, and each other.</P>
<P>     The comedy starts slowly, with occasional solid one-liners and sight 
gags (one hint that the film has promise is that most of these work).  
However, just before the half-way point, Vic embarks on one of those 
motion picture cliches, the "Blind Date from Hell."  In this case, his 
companion is the offbeat Lucille (played with deadpan gusto by Janeane 
Garofalo, the best thing to come out of REALITY BITES).  Though nothing 
that happens between these two erupts with originality, and many of the 
jokes are telegraphed, the Vic/Lucille scenes are hilarious.  Quaid and 
Garofalo create an effective rapport, each playing perfectly off the 
other.  The only downside is that they aren't on screen all the time.  An 
entire movie could have been made with just these two characters, and it 
probably would have been a far better film than BYE BYE LOVE.</P>
<P>     Paul Reiser essentially regurgitates his MAD ABOUT YOU personae.  
There are a few wrinkles, but this is a "safe" role that doesn't require 
much of a stretch.  Donny is blandly likable, but his story, which 
includes a relationship with Dave's ex (Amy Brenneman), seems like 
filler.  Unfortunately, Matthew Modine is barely adequate, so Dave's 
scenes are often the least enjoyable.  The script has some odd tangents, 
including a father-son relationship between a McDonald's worker (Johnny 
Whitworth) and his elderly "adopt a geezer" trainee (Ed Flanders).  Rob 
Reiner is on hand as an ubiquitous talk-show host who raises the ire of 
his listeners.</P>
<P>     Product placement has become a common practice for films like this, 
but BYE BYE LOVE goes way overboard in advertising for McDonald's.  This 
is the second film this year (the other being HOUSEGUEST) where the fast 
food joint attains the importance of a character.  The golden arches are 
lovingly highlighted, and there's a nice close-up of a sign advertising 
extra value meals for $2.99.  Such blatant commercialism is annoying.</P>
<P>     Dramatic comedies are Hollywood staples, but most fall short by 
diluting straight and amusing elements on an equal basis.  While BYE BYE 
LOVE has its share of problems, feeble jokes and unfunny humor aren't 
among them.  Despite only partially succeeding in its examination of the 
potentially-damaging effects of divorce, the end result is still a 
pleasant film that satisfies a need for cheery, unforced entertainment.</P>
