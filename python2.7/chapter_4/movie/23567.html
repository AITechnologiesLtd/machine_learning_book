Waking the Dead</PRE>
<PRE>By Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>It's kind of like oatmeal. Without honey or milk, it tastes rather bland,
but sticks to your ribs all day. Some wholesome thing inside you. One right
thing you did.</P>
<P>If you're in love, you'll empathize. But if you're not, you'll say, "Man,
it's been a long time. I'd sure like to do that again."</P>
<P>A new genre: political romance. A civics love story. Left meets right and
falls in love. In the farout 70's, Fielding Pierce, a young man born to
succeed in office, stumbles across Sarah, a revolutionary-minded
bleeding-heart with a twist of the Catholic. Of course they hop right into
bed -- and my goodness, these are some hot and steamy love scenes. All would
be hunky-dory hadn't the news reported Sarah's untimely death during her
libertarian mission down in Chile. A decade later and smack dab in the
middle of his campaign for office, Fielding starts to pretend he's seeing
and hearing Sarah again (or is she really there?). Coupled with gradually
corrupting powers of politics, his seductive visions set him struggling with
political goals, family expectations, personal morals, and sanity.</P>
<P>Billy Crudup plays the role extremely well, but mostly without pungency,
save for a few exemplary outstanding Oscar moments. In one scene, he thinks
Sarah's on the phone. He's shaking and crying and believably moved to near
vomit. In another pinnacle scene, he announces to his family that he may be
losing his marbles. It's wonderful: fancy restaurant, proper dinner party
and then this guttural outburst. Fantastic performances. Billy was very good
in another prosaic movie this time last year: "Hi-Lo Country". Jennifer
Connelly also performs well. In fact all do, and the direction is sharp;
it's just that the script is rather like oatmeal -- bland. Billy's two
moments - like unbroken, unresolved chunks of brown sugar, give a mighty
flavorful chew to this banal, but hearty meal.</P>
<P>The ending narrative is unnecessary and out of place in a movie that's all
about thinking and feeling. The people/letter scene is excellent and would
have served the slightly-open resolution well.</P>
<P>There is also an interview with director Keith Gordon on the site!</P>
