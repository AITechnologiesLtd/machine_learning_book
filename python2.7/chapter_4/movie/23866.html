<PRE>Ready to Rumble
A film review by Max Messier</PRE>
<P>Wrestling - for all of its flash pots, Solid Gold dancers, and large,
scantily clad, sweaty men – is the 21st century version of Ringing
Bros., Barnum and Bailey's traveling tent show.  When I was a kid, I
used to watch the exploits of Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage,
and the Honky Tonk Man.  The newest generation of wrestlers have never
interested me, with all of the theatrics and bad, bad attitudes toward
almost everything under the sun.  The `sport' of wrestling has become
three hours of anger, deception, sexual dominance, and violent acts with
chairs.  The one thing that has always eluded me with the newest
generation of wrestlers – Goldberg, Sting, Mankind, and The Rock – is
the human element that drew me into the action so well as a kid.  But
Ready to Rumble helped remind me of the glory days I once had, sitting
before the 13-inch RCA with the bottom knob broken off, watching my
heroes triumph over the adversities of life's travels.</P>
<P>The film follow two losers, played by Scott Caan and David Arquette, who
run a septic truck business for the local town of Lusk, Wyoming.  Their
idol is Jimmy King, grand champion belt holder of the WCW Federation,
who proclaims `I WILL RULE YOU!' after every victory.  Caan and Arquette
attend a WCW bout and, in horror, watch their idol fall from grace by
turncoat WCW wrestlers.  Jimmy King is beaten to a bloody pulp and a
fellow wrestler, Diamond Dallas Page, takes the belt from the fallen
king.  After the show, Caan and Arquette strike out to find their
defeated hero and once again place the crown upon the rightful king of
the ring.</P>
<P>The strengths of the film lie in its wonderful script.  It draws from
the familiar lines of many sport films yet retains a strong sense of
disbelief that helps carry the emotions of the characters to a
heart-pounding end.  Arquette and Caan put out wonderful performances of
simple men looking to fulfill their dreams without anything standing in
their way.  The supporting cast of real wrestlers – Goldberg, Sting,
Macho Man Randy Savage, and Mr. Perfect – lend their acting chops to
help authenticate the action.  And director Brian Robbins lends a
confident hand at capturing the beauty of the choreographed moves,
strongly capturing the feeling of this `circus' masquerading as a
professional sport.</P>
<P>But the best thing about the movie is how damn funny it is.  The scenes
are littered with enough foul humor to embarrass the Farrelly Brothers
but are carried by the convictions of the characters and the innocence
of common men in the presence of giants.  Even Joe Pantoliano, playing a
sleazy wrestling promoter responsible for the King's downfall, and Oscar
winner Martin Landau, playing an old-school wrestler who trains King,
bring wonderful diversity to the characters in the film.  Rose McGowan
shines as well as a manipulative WCW dancer who likes to wrestle and
growl in bed.</P>
<P>Ready to Rumble is a fun, rambunctious film filled with laughs and a
great storyline.  Take your favorite wrestling fan (or your favorite
closeted wrestling fan) and a good time is guaranteed.</P>
