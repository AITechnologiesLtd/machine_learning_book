<P>"Gladiator" is the bloodiest, nauseating, dullest and most old-fashioned
gladiator flick in ages - a big thud in director Ridley Scott's career. It is
beautifully shot and appropriately murky but also hopelessly, terminally
monotonous.</P>
<P>The indefatigable Russell Crowe stars as the stoic Spanish-born Maximus,
general of a Roman army, who in the film's brutal opening sequence, lavishes an
attack against multitudes of barbarians - his command is "Unleash hell." That
phrase sums up the film in a nutshell. </P>
<P>Later, Maximus is praised by Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris - looking
more haggard and drunk than ever) for vanquishing the enemy. The dying Emperor
also wants Maximus to succeed him, which causes dissent from the Emperor's
devious son, Commodus (Joaquim Phoenix). It is no surprise that Commodus, a
weakling who has never seen the gruesome reality of war, kills his father and
almost has Maximus killed and guess who becomes the new Emperor? </P>
<P>After Maximus escapes, he is sold as a slave and prepared for death as a
gladiator by Proximo (Oliver Reed), a supplier and instructor of gladiators who
has seen all kinds of savagery in his heyday. Maximus survives several battles
to the death, enough to go to the paramount level - the Colosseum where
Commodus is often seen in attendance. Dispensing one of the few clever notions
in the screenplay, the Colosseum recreates famous battles yet Maximus ends up
beating the odds, to the enormous applause from the audiences who love this
kind of spectacle. </P>
<P>"Gladiator" is at heart a revenge story since Maximus wants to kill Commodus
for having killed his family and all his friends. But Maximus embodies lots of
grunts and excessive moroseness - none of this merits much in the way of
empathy or sympathy. His Maximus is a study in complete stoicism from beginning
to end but there is not much beyond that - Crowe, an excellent actor, offers no
hints of humanity, only vigor. I may be bold for saying this but even
Schwarzeneger's Conan had a sense of humor in between his vicious
sword-wielding moments.</P>
<P>The action scenes are another problem. In this age of super MTV-split-second
edits, the battle scenes in the Colosseum and in the opening sequence are cut
so frantically and with such headache-inducing movement that it is difficult to
tell what is happening on screen. I suppose director Ridley Scott considers
this an experimental approach post-"Saving Private Ryan" but at least in
"Ryan," you had some clue as to what was occuring from one shot to the next
(both films are from the company Dreamworks). The similarly old-fashioned,
silly "Spartacus" was also cohesively shot and edited so that you never lost
sight of who was killing whom. Here it is all a jumbled collage of rapid
movements causing headaches more than excitement. </P>
<P>"Gladiator" has some decent performances, the best of which is the intense
presence of the late Oliver Reed, but the film meanders at such a languid pace
that it is often to difficult to stay awake while watching it. Its joyless,
somber tone and thin characters makes it a chore to sit through. This may be
the first summer blockbuster for the year 2000 but the outlook is not too
promising.</P>
