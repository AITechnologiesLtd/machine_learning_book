<PRE>GRAPHOEROTOMANIA</PRE>
<P>The First Book - The Book Of The Uninitiated</P>
<P>"It's not a film, it's an ... experience," said my friend, a confessed
Greenaway devotee. So, if you have never had the benefit of the
experience before, welcome to the weird and wonderful world of Peter
Greenaway.  A world of strange obsessions, of bodies nude and quartered,
of frames within frames and words within pictures.  See the amazing
tableaux-fashioned scenes, with many wondrous things all happening at
once. Hear the sounds of crowds, Japanese chants and French songs,
airplanes roaring and even the soundtrack fast forwarding.  Thrill to
the haunting beginning and the bravura ending.</P>
<PRE>The Second Book - The Book of The Film</PRE>
<P>But what's it all about, sir?  "I have found that there are but two
things in life which are dependable: the delights of flesh and the
delights of literature." This quote from the film is itself a quote from
the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, and these then are the twin obsessions
of Greenaway's film.  The pleasures of Body and Text are woven together
in the mind of Nagiko (Vivian Wu), a modern Japanese woman fixated with
the writing of words on skin. As a child, her birthday is celebrated
with a face-painting ritual by her father, marking Gods creation of
human beings from clay figures by writing on them.  As an adult, she
seeks out lovers who will write over her body, exchanging sex for
calligraphy.  And then there is a hateful marriage, a passionate love
with a translator (Ewan McGregor) , a revenge, and the writing of a
series of  eleven "Books" on bodies, which are simultaneously an act of
love and revenge.</P>
<PRE>The Third Book - The Book of Logic</PRE>
<P>Scratching your head, perhaps? And yet, everything in THE PILLOWBOOK
proceeds according to an inner logic as inexorable as astrology.  Submit
to its logic, and everything makes perfect sense. Enter a hall of
mirrors:  the father exchanges sex for calligraphy just as the daughter
does;  a burning of books marks Nagikos departure from Japan just as a
second fire marks her return.  Offhand details all comment obliquely on
the films themes: like the scribbling of a car license plate on one
hand, or the writing out of a cheque on another.</P>
<PRE>The Fourth Book - El Buku de Il Auteur</PRE>
<P>Naturally the film submits also to the logic of the larger Text that
is Greenaway's body of work.  Fans will detect many links with his other
films:  the fascination with multiple foreign languages as in THE FALLS,
the dissection of the body as in THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HIS
LOVER, sex as bargain and exchange as in THE DRAUGHTSMANS CONTRACT, 
the use of numbers, lists and patterns as in so many of his films. Most
obviously, the PILLOW BOOK is a continuation of the obsessions of
PROPSPEROS BOOKS, with its similar graphomania, lavish visuals, naked
bodies and streams of words layered thick on the screen.  You can see
whole university courses in the making even as you watch.</P>
<P>The Fifth Book - The Book of the East (Far)</P>
<P>One thing that's new to the Greenaway canon is the PILLOW BOOK's
focus on the Orient.  But in hindsight, it's easy to think of Japan as
an obvious source of Greenaway fascinations: after all, this is a
culture that produced ritual suicide, "comfort" houses, Tetsuo and
un-useless inventions.  The Timeout film guide once described THE
DRAUGHTSMAN'S CONTRACT as "a better exploration of an alien world than
most science fiction films," and to me, the Japanese world seems as
worthy of Greenaway's space probe as any.</P>
<PRE>The Sixth Book - The Book of Nudity</PRE>
<P>There's a lot of it in this film.  Apparently, at Cannes, an American
journalist asked Greenaway why The Pillow Book is so full of naked men.
His response: "Trust you, as an American, to ask such an absurd
question!".</P>
<P>There is indeed a loud and very silly fat American in this film. He
is the Book of the Exhibitionist, and he is naked too, of course.</P>
<P>The Seventh Book - The Book of the Trainspotting Allusion</P>
<P>Ewan Mcgregor dies in a wonderfully melodramatic ritual drug overdose.</P>
<P>The Eighth Book - The Book of Conclusions</P>
<P>A list of splendid reasons to watch THE PILLOW BOOK: for its
beautiful images; for its power to send eyes, ears and brain spinning;
for its moments of emotional warmth (more frequent than some of
Greenaway's other films); because it is extravagantly pretentious and
unashamedly arty; because it is awesome, rich and strange.</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast. 
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend. 
 **** Amazing, potent stuff. 
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
