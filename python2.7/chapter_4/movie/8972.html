<PRE>Black Mask ( 1996 )
(Chinese, with English subtitles)</PRE>
<PRE>A Movie Review by David Sunga</PRE>
<PRE>Produced by: Tsui Hark </PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Daniel Lee Yan-Kong
Action Director: Yuen Woo-Ping</PRE>
<P>Written by: Tsui Hark, Koan Hui On, Teddy Chan Tak-Sum, Joe Ma Wai-Ho</P>
<P>Starring: Jet Li Lian-Jie, Lau Ching-Wan, Karen Morris (Mok Man-Wai),
Francoise Yip Fong-Wah,</P>
<P>Ingredients: sci fi darkness, remorseless cyborg-type bad guys,
explosions and flying bullets, Terminator like sequence in a hospital,
heartache for a lost love, and a masked guy who wears a costume like
Kato of the Green Hornet with kung fu to match.</P>
<PRE>Synopsis:
This movie is subtitled in English, rather than dubbed.</PRE>
<P>In the opening sequence beleaguered members of Commando Squad 701
narrowly escape annihilation by government troups. A narrator explains
that the members of 701 had undergone brain surgery to make them
impervious to pain and emotionally distant. Having lost their humanity,
the robotic superhumans were trained to be the best assassins in the
world but eventually couldn't be controlled, so the government ordered
them eradicated. Survivors escaped and separated to hide among normal
humans. ( An earlier movie depicting the aforementioned supersoldiers
was ‘Universal Soldier [ 1992 ],' starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and
Dolph Lundgren ). </P>
<P>A couple years later refugee Black Mask ( Jet Li ), superhuman young
former coach of the 701 team, has assumed a lowly new identity in Hong
Kong as gentle librarian Tsui Chik. His only good friend is another
loner: his chess partner, the hardened straight arrow Police Inspector
Shek ( Lau Ching-Wan ).</P>
<P>When Hong Kong's drug czars are systematically attacked and killed,
Inspector Shek takes the case. Unbeknownst to Shek, the remaining
superhumans of Squad 701 - - including a beautiful former lover of Black
Mask's ( Francoise Yip ) -- have banded together under psycho Commander
Shung to become a criminal gang seeking to take over the Asian drug
trade.</P>
<P>Tsui Chik becomes Black Mask again to protect Shek, and soon the police
and Black Mask find themselves battling attacks by the superhumans.
Smaller battles lead to a final conflict at the criminals' stronghold. </P>
<P>Some comic relief breaks up the action in the antics of Karen Morris
(Mok Man-Wai) as a lovestruck pampered love interest from the library
who chases both Tsui Chik and Black Mask, not knowing they're the same
man.</P>
<P>Stars:
Beijing born Jet Li was a member of China's national wushu demonstration
team in his early teens and was invited to perform for President Richard
Nixon ( Nixon shocked the world by opening US relations with communist
China ).  Wushu, means ‘martial arts' but since 1958,  it has come to
mean a national ( non-combative ) performance art that combines old
fight forms with gymnastics, Peking Opera, acrobatics, choreography,
dramatic interpretation and sometimes even music.  In movies, the style
involves fast thrusts, grabs, counterthrusts, and acrobatic leaps to
avoid being thrown.  </P>
<P>A prodigy, Li won the Chinese national wushu championships five years in
a row. After a few unnoticed minor film roles, Li hit it big in the
Asian scene with the movie ‘Once Upon a Time in China ( 1991 ),'
directed and produced by Tsui Hark (  the director of Double Team, with
Van Damme and Dennis Rodman  ). Among his fans' favorite movies are
‘Fist of Legend  ( 1994 )' a remake of a Bruce Lee classic. </P>
<P>In Black Mask actor Jet Li is reunited with 'Once Upon a Time in China'
director Tsui Hark and ‘Fist of Legend' fight choreographer Yuen
Woo-Ping.</P>
<P>Jackie Chan fans may recognize Black Mask's lost former lover Yueh-lan
from Squad 701 as actress Francoise Yip, who played Jackie Chan's love
interest Nancy, the motorcycle girl from ‘Rumble in the Bronx ( 1995 ).' </P>
<P>Opinion:
Like ‘The Terminator,' this is a neat action movie that goes for mood,
action, and style more than anything. It feels like an artsy sci fi
piece -- a comic book turned real --  with its mod music and dark
costumes, architectural structures, and action camera angles. The fight
scenes are a mixture of fast hand to hand combat with shootings,
explosions, darkness and flying glass all around -- and are
well-choreographed by veteran action director Yuen Woo-Ping.
Dramatically Jet Li gets solid acting support from Lau Ching Wan, doing
his best to flesh out the character of Tsui Chik's gruff cop buddy Shek. </P>
<P>The exciting final confrontation between Commander Shung and Black Mask
involves using electrical cables as flailing weapons. The character of
Commander Shung isn't explored much, so in my opinion, the most
climactic scene isn't the final confrontation but rather when Black Mask
reluctantly battles his former lover Yueh-lan, the super soldier woman
of his flashbacks. </P>
