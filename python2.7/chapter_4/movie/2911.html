<PRE>                           TERMINAL VELOCITY
                       A film review by Rob Furr
                        Copyright 1994 Rob Furr</PRE>
<P>     TERMINAL VELOCITY, the new Charlie Sheen vehicle, is a hard movie
to review.  Not because of any inherent problem with the movie itself,
but because delivering my honest opinion is going to make me look like
an idiot.</P>
<PRE>     My honest opinion: I liked it.</PRE>
<PRE>     Really.</PRE>
<P>     Believe it or not, I consider TERMINAL VELOCITY to be well worth
the five-seventy-five and two hours I spent on it.</P>
<P>     Now, I'm *sure* that that statement is going to be met with
disagreement, but that's not what's going to get me in trouble.  What's
going to get me in trouble is the rest of this review.  To wit:</P>
<P>     The first adjective that comes to mind when describing TERMINAL
VELOCITY is "Hitchcockian."  If Alfred Hitchcock was a modern B-movie
director, this is the sort of movie he'd make.  Forget FRANTIC and the
other stale reworkings of the Master's art; Hitchcock at his best was
able to conjure a fearful, paranoia-laden energy that his modern
followers can only imitate.  TERMINAL VELOCITY, on the other hand,
manages to weave something approximating the Hitchcock aura out of its
B-movie roots.  It's nowhere near as good as the Master's best, but, to
be quite honest, I'd rather sit through TERMINAL VELOCITY again than
TOPAZ.</P>
<P>     In fact, TERMINAL VELOCITY is Hitchcockian enough that I'm not
going to describe the plot beyond the basics: There's this
sort-of-rebel parachute instructor who takes a student up, see, and ....</P>
<PRE>     ... and then it gets complicated.  Sort of.</PRE>
<P>     The plot is even a rough approximation of the Hitchcock plot.  The
general description is Hitchcockian enough; slightly-tarnished Everyman
gets into a situation over his head in which nothing and no-one is what
it seems.  Even some of the specifics are Hitchcockian; the rocket sled
ride (which was visually impressive, but otherwise mostly pointless)
brought the Redcap scene from NORTH BY NORTHWEST to mind (and,
furthermore, there's even a scene that's almost identical to the
classic biplane sequence from that movie.)  There's a MacGuffin, which,
in true Hitchcock style, is never satisfactorally explained (what was
it doing on a German plane?), there's a underlying Cold War air to it,
and so on.</P>
<P>     Now, before you, the reader, fire up your mail program to tell me
that I'm trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, let me qualify
this general statement:</P>
<P>     No, TERMINAL VELOCITY is not a great movie.  There are some
howlingly bad scenes, some rather tasteless scenes, and a conclusion
that is a deus literally ex machina, and if you have a low tolerance
for cheap characterization, then you might want to avoid this movie.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, if you're willing to put up with some stupidity
on the part of the filmmakers, you might stand an excellent chance of
actually enjoying this movie.  On the Furr Scale, TERMINAL VELOCITY is
either a three-star two star movie, or a two-star three star movie.
(The Furr Scale rates movies on ambition as well as quality; you
shouldn't expect a movie that's trying to be AMADEUS to be better or
worse in the same way as a movie that's trying to be EVIL DEAD 2.
HEAVEN'S GATE is a one-star four-star movie ... that is, it's an
utterly rotten movie that was trying to be great, and ROBOCOP is a
three-star three star movie; a darn good movie that was trying to be
darn good.) It's hard to tell with TERMINAL VELOCITY whether it was
trying to be a B movie, in which case it was pretty darn good, or an A
movie, in which case it was merely average.  Considering all in all,
I'm leaning towards three-star two star (an above average B movie.)</P>
<P>     Whatever it is, it's worth a look.  If you're unsure, give it a
matinee performance; it's definitely worth *that*.</P>
