<PRE>Armageddon
Review by Fox Davidson</PRE>
<P>  In one of the most hyped films of the past decade, Armageddon is a 
mega-bust.  A disaster flick that is a disaster on every level.  Not even 
Bruce Willis can save this expensive, incoherent, derivative mess.</P>
<P>  Following in the superior Deep Impact's heels, Armageddon tells the mudding 
tale of an asteroid the size of Texas on a collision course with Earth.  The 
film fails to mention how this particular hunk of space rock was detected by 
NASA, or even the inept script-hole that shows a U.S. spacecraft being 
obliterated in orbit by a comet shower, followed by the destruction of 
Manhattan. Oops.  NASA couldn't see that?  I guess when you are Billy Bob 
Thornton (playing a NASA official), you kinda wonder how such a wonderful 
actor as yourself is reduced to rubish like Armageddon.</P>
<P>  Willis plays Harry Stamper, "the world's best oil driller," who is called 
into action (just like it Die Hard, Mercury Rising, Die Hard 2!).  I have no 
idea why Harry, and his retarted group of drillers, are called for a job that 
if failed, would mean the end of life as we know it.  I guess it would seem 
cooler to have a bunch of dudes rescuing us from complete death and 
destruction than some smart, well-mannered scientist-cume-Amercian hero.</P>
<P>  The DVD of the movie is okay.  It contains a trailer, I believe a 
commentary (I was so looking forward to taking this disc out of my machine, I 
didn't notice), and some other mumbo jumbo.  The soundtrack is wide and good, 
but, like the cast, this disc is just worthless.</P>
