<P>     In Costa-Gavras' new drama MAD CITY, reporter Max Brackett (Dustin
Hoffman) stumbles onto the story of a lifetime exactly when his career
needs it most -- and his soul needs it least.  Once a network news star,
Brackett has been serving time in the journalistic gulag of Madeline,
California since insulting anchorman Kevin Hollander (Alan Alda) on the
air.  While doing a puff piece at a local museum, Brackett finds himself
staring at his return ticket to the big time when laid-off security guard
Sam Baily (John Travolta) storms the place with a gun to demand his job
back, then inadvertently shoots another guard and ends up taking a group
of school children hostage.  Sam wants nothing more than to get out alive;
Brackett sees a chance to guide the story by becoming ringmaster of the
ensuing media circus as Sam's mouthpiece and de facto press secretary.</P>
<P>     Twenty years ago, a film like MAD CITY would have been a provocative
and disturbing exploration of how television news can exploit a story to
feed our blood-lust.  In fact, it was...it was called NETWORK.  Paddy
Chayefsky's brilliant script and Peter Finch's mesmerizing final
performance as unraveling anchorman Howard Beale made NETWORK a classic of
dark satire, spotlighting the natural culmination of an obsessive pursuit
of ratings.  It was just outrageous enough to be entertaining, and just
plausible enough to be alarming.</P>
<P>     MAD CITY arrives in a different era.  The notion that televison news
isn't just about the news...well, it just isn't news.  It never manages to
arouse much more than nods of recognition, because the images and
situations are familiar to the point of cliche:  Alda's self-important
anchorman, the selective editing of a story to fit a pre-determined
agenda, the absurdity of a growing media feeding frenzy.  As an ethics
lesson, it's strident but ineffective, preaching to a nation of converts
about a problem they all know exists but have no idea how to correct.</P>
<P>     It's fortunate, then, that MAD CITY does a solid job of giving its
subject a human face.  That face doesn't belong to Dustin Hoffman, though
Brackett is the story's central character.  Watching his developing
crisis of conscience -- and similarly the conversion of Brackett's naive
assistant (Mia Kirshner) into a cutthroat reporter -- becomes a chore as
the script slogs toward the inevitable.  No, it is John Travolta who
creates the most vivid portrait in MAD CITY as a man overwhelmed by
circumstances before he has any idea what they are.  Playing simple
challenges any actor, yet Travolta plays simple with a disarming
effectiveness.  His trust that Brackett will act in his best interest is
wonderfully misguided; his incredulous expressions as Brackett takes over
an interview with Larry King capture the realization that the media's best
interests are always their own.  Sam Baily acts as a stand-in for everyone
who sees the media going berzerk over things they barely comprehend.</P>
<P>     The relationship moments between Baily and Brackett are among the
strongest in MAD CITY, though it also provides a few chuckles as the
public sympathies sway in the breeze.  Like most "message" films, however,
it begins to wilt every time it underlines its message.  MAD CITY's
primary stumbling block is its obviousness -- of the character
developments, of the plot progression, of the scolding tone the film takes
towards its targets.  It reaches an audience which doesn't find
sensationalism disturbing, but it delivers its story as though no one else
had told it before.  That's two places NETWORK was prescient:  telling the
story of media gone mad, and anticipating viewers who would come to find
the madness tolerable.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 media blitzes:  6.</PRE>
