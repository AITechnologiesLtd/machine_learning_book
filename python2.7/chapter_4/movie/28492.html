<PRE>"Swordfish" -- Action May Reel You In, But Story
Flounders
by Homer Yen
(c) 2001</PRE>
<P>"Swordfish," a sometimes-explosive high-tech thriller,
will hook you – but only for its first 15 minutes. 
Its opening is a captivating hostage sequence in which
police and SWAT teams tragically underestimate the
fortitude of the cunning Gabriel (John Travolta).  He
is a villain who will not hesitate to sacrifice
innocent lives or even his own to pull off an
improbable heist.  The events that unfold during these
taut opening minutes are mesmerizing with effects that
easily outdo key scenes from "The Matrix" in
presentation and intensity.</P>
<P>After that, however, its creativity and pace start to
sputter.  It then begins to regress into a generic,
albeit flashy, shoot-em-up action flick.  Bullets fly
and cars explode while the body count rises.  But its
biggest casualty, unfortunately, is the story, which
amounts to a tepid heist flick wrapped in some cheeky
banter and black humor.</P>
<P>At least John Travolta looks quite comfortable as the
megalomaniacal villain.  He swaggers with bravado,
sports a tough-guy haircut and chin hair, and projects
an aura of hipness and fear.  From his exotic sports
cars to his mountaintop villa to his gaggle of
beautiful girls, he lives a life that other men can
only dream about.  His lifestyle, however, does not
come about from a lack of ambition or from a lack of
ruthlessness.  </P>
<P>For his next big job, he plans to steal $9 billion
from a federal drug fund, but will need to recruit a
crack computer hacker.  With the help of his prurient
assistant, Ginger (Halle Berry), Gabriel tries to
enlist Stan (Hugh Jackman), an ex-con whose previous
successful assault on an FBI database sent him to jail
and also caused him to lose custody of his daughter. 
Stan has no desire to return to prison and only wishes
to be rejoined with his daughter.  But for a fee of
$10 million, which will more than pay for the lawyers
needed to win custody, how can our hacker refuse?  </P>
<P>Berry also does good things as the sexy moll who may
be more than she seems under those skin-tight dresses.
 She uses her siren-like charms to keep Stan focused
on his task and exudes a confidence that makes her
topless scene just an extension of her self-assurance
rather than something gratuitous.</P>
<P>Jackman, however, is absolutely listless.  His scenes
with his daughter don't strike up any poignant
emotions, and his brooding demeanor that gained him
much notice in "X-Men" has been replaced with silly,
self-congratulatory gyrations as he moves closer to
developing a program to break through the firewall
security codes.   Sadly, his on-screen time consists
mostly of incredibly fast typing and keyboard
clattering.  </P>
<P>Another annoying issue is that as a tech-driven film,
computer jargon and graphics are heavily used. 
There's a lot of focus on Stan's computer screens as
words like 'port scan' and 'crypto algorithm' flash
about.  It may look cool, but it doesn't really tell a
story.  </P>
<P>Completely underutilized, however, is Don Cheadle who
plays the federal agent trying to track Gabriel down. 
His look of concern may be that of a detective who
knows that Gabriel is capable of mass destruction. 
Or, he may just be worried that he'll be playing the
role of effete cops for the rest of his career.</P>
<P>"Swordfish" is ultimately just a glossy but somewhat
hollow production.  Aside from its whiz-bang
beginning, it only manages to be an undistinguished,
bullet-ridden thriller.  </P>
