<P>With succinctness and cine-savvy, as we left the screening of "Kundun,"  my
friend Nicolae stated: "It's not a movie, it's a state of mind."</P>
<P>The state of mind is Martin Scorsese's and his writer Melissa Mathison's
sincere, admiring reverence for the Dalai Lama, called Kundun (The
Presence) by his people. It is a well-meant,  not too odd subject for
former choir-boy Scorsese who, in ways clear and realistic or subtle and
allusive, has often worked into his films tenets or values of Catholicism.
It was no stretch for the director to expand into Tibetan mysticism --
although he has declared that his main interest in the film was visual.</P>
<P>Scorsese is a Prince of moviemakers and a Prince of cinephiles. I'm sure
that those who write about cinema feel unease, even distress, whenever they
deal with a Scorsese work that is not tops. It's like admitting in public
the weaknesses of a best friend.</P>
<P>"Kundun" is a primarily visual homage to the current, and14th, Dalai Lama,
a tribute to the people of Tibet, and a political protest against the
country's being gobbled up by China in 1950.</P>
<P>The Dalai Lamas are a succession of reincarnations, and the manifestations
of the Bodhisattva (Buddha) of Compassion. The film begins with the search
for the new spiritual/temporal leader. He is to succeed  the 13th Dalai
Lama who passed away in 1935.</P>
<P>The14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, was born in 1935 in a small village in
north eastern Tibet to a peasant family. In the search for the new Dalai
Lama he was "recognized" (i.e. identified as the next Dalai Lama) in 1937,
at age two-and-a-half. In 1940 he was enthroned. But in 1959, after the
failed revolt of his people against the Communist Chinese, he fled to exile
in India with about 80,000 followers. Since1960, he has resided in
Dharamsala, India, known as "Little Lhasa," the seat of the Tibetan
Government-in-exile.</P>
<P>"Kundun" was a long-cherished project of Ms.Mathison. Her previous scripts
were for "The Black Stallion," "E.T.," "The Escape Artist"  and "The Indian
in the Cupboard." Over the years, often assisted by her husband Harrison
Ford, she interviewed the Dalai Lama. The latter had a big hand in changes
and additions to the scenario.</P>
<P>The film follows the life of His Holiness (as he is referred to in all
documents) from childhood to the flight to India. There are several
beautiful moments, but the piousness of the production results in
unintended aloofness from the subject and lack of dramatic tension. Its
contemplative mood comes at the expense of story-telling and of orienting
us. The Tibetan-Chinese conflict is shown without big dramatics --save for
some stylized nightmares of HH --which is good. Yet  excessive restraint
overall givies the impression of something one might label "narrative
soft-focus."</P>
<P>It would be fastidious to compare and analyze this work and Jean-Jacques
Annaud's "Seven Years in Tibet," released shortly before "Kundun." Still,
"Kundun"'s Holies vs.Heathens, with its veneer of mysticism, lack the power
of the earlier picture. It is odd that in their Tibetan films, Frenchman
Annaud made a kind of American action movie, while American Scorsese made a
kind of "intellectual" French film.</P>
<P>By concentrating on discreet hagiography, "Kundun" forgets details that
could be fascinating to Western audiences: the inner workings in the
process of the search for a new Dalai Lama, for example (we get mostly
people riding around);  the tests to which the pre-Lama child is subjected
(these are few and simplified); the true nature of the Dalai Lama as he
grows up and attains adulthood.</P>
<P>Nowhere do we get presages of the now world-famous 14th Dalai Lama ,winner
of a Nobel prize and an immense array of important honors;  worldly, witty,
highly cultivated. I remember, some years ago, his French radio broadcasts
on philosophy and other matters. He was wonderfully eloquent, sharp, witty,
more impressive than even star scholars.</P>
<P>"Kundun" was produced and filmed in Morocco, with some second-unit work in
Idaho and British Columbia. The Moroccan adventure was a tour-de-force
involving nature, sets, buildings, costumes, artifacts, jewelry, many
(human) extras. Casting was not easy. The performers, almost exclusively
Tibetans from all corners of the world, had no theatrical experience and
had to speak English.  Several of them are related to the characters they
play.Their suprisingly competent acting ranges from very good to acceptable
to caricatural (Chairman Mao).The flaw, however, is that as written, no
character was given enough development or dimensionality.</P>
<P>All this is impressively photographed and staged, with gorgeous mandalas
punctuating the sights. Yet, try as it can, most of "Kundun" did not look
to me like Tibet. Annaud's movie made an infinitely better, more convincing
choice by opting for the forbiding, snowy Andes as a stand-in for the
Himalayas.</P>
<P>Avant-gardist Philip Glass's score begins nicely as a mix of Tibetan music
and typical Glass repeated lines, but soon enough their merciless
reiteration becomes annoyingly strident and monotonous.</P>
<P>Scorsese seems much more comfortable with mean streets and places. Reaching
for profundity here he is out of his depth. The sum total of the film is
that it seems to have been conceived as a work for the heart but turned out
a work for the eye. Even then, the lack of muscle in "Kundun" rapidly makes
the viewer unable to remember specific sights, as opposed to those
indelible moments in great --even un-great-- movies.</P>
<P>Think, for instance, of Scorsese's "GoodFellas." Your inner eye and ear
jump to many scenes, especially those of Joe Pesci's brutality and warped
humor in the bar. Think of "Kundun," and very few scenes emerge, except
perhaps those of the lively 2-year old future Dalai Lama repeating
triumphantly "mine!"</P>
