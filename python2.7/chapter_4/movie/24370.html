<P>The people behind the scenes of "The Million Dollar Hotel" probably thought 
they were making a great movie. It's so far out there, odd on such a grand 
scale, with such emotional sounds and warped visuals, that there must have 
been a lot of risk and passion put into it. Nobody wants to do that in 
service of a big disaster. But they have.</P>
<P>To give you an idea of what the movie is like, I must describe some of the 
characters, because they dominate the film. They reside in the hotel of the 
title, a large but decrepit old hole that is a perfectly apt place for the 
grubby bunch of freaks, addicts, losers and nutcases who fill its rooms. At 
the forefront is Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies), a skinny, fidgety young 
skateboarder who everyone seems to agree is retarded. He's in love with 
Eloise (Milla Jovovich), a quiet but self-destructive prostitute who likes to 
read.</P>
<P>Geronimo (Jimmy Smits), another friend of Tom Tom, wears a cape, paints tar 
over stolen goods and communicates through shouting. Dixie (Peter Stormare), 
who has not left the hotel since 1980, still awaits a visit from his dentist, 
and is convinced that he was the real songwriter for The Beatles. Vivien 
(Amanda Plummer) shoots heroin and is engaged to a dead man. Shorty (Bud 
Cort) is a pretty standard drunk. Jessica (Gloria Stuart) is a sweet old lady 
who swears a lot -- and if there's a comic device I'm really getting tired of 
in the movies, it's that one.</P>
<P>The story begins with an FBI agent played by Mel Gibson coming to investigate 
the death of a guy called Izzy, a former inhabitant of the Million Dollar 
Hotel who fell from the roof. It seems like suicide, but Izzy's rich father 
is convinced that his boy was murdered, and Gibson determines to find a 
culprit, aggressively interrogating the hotel's weirdoes and secretly 
enlisting Tom Tom's help.</P>
<P>We soon learn that the Gibson character, who wears a neck brace and moves in 
a robotic fashion, did himself grow up among 'freaks', after being born a 
deformed child with a third arm growing out of his back. As his investigation 
goes on, he develops an affinity for the hotel occupants, an emotional 
involvement that threatens to get in the way of his professionalism.</P>
<P>This should be poignant, but never is, because Gibson's body language is 
risible and distracting, and his dilemma never strikes us as being 
particularly meaningful. The rest of the movie doesn't work because we have 
to spend time with a plethora of wretched cretins, who get to be annoying 
very quickly. "Being John Malkovich" is a recent example of how entertaining 
eccentricity can be; "The Million Dollar Hotel" is filled with grating noise 
and murky sets, and most of it is about as fun as a bad trip.</P>
<P>Some of the music is fantastic -- U2's Bono wrote the film's story, and stuck 
around to create tracks for the soundtrack. There are moments of rich 
photography, and the editing is often hypnotic, with its fascinating use of 
shot repetition and emphasis on slow, seductive camera moves. It's even 
possible to get wrapped up in the plot, simply because we have no way of 
predicting what's going to happen. Then again, the eventual answer to the 
murder mystery is lacklustre, and it takes too long to get there. And the 
bottom line: "The Million Dollar Hotel" is far too ugly and strange for my 
tastes, and hey, I'm the guy who enjoyed "12 Monkeys".</P>
