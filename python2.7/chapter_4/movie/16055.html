<PRE>As reviewed by James Brundage</PRE>
<P>As a country, we've seen it all for disaster movies. We've seen massive
destruction of the world's cities by aliens (Independence Day). We've seen
volcano's nix the small town and the big city (Dante's Peak and Volcano).
We've seen New York's traffic jammed Holland Tunnel go out from under us
(Daylight). We've seen ships go thrillingly awry in space … TWICE (Apollo 13
and 2001), and comically awry as well (Airplane II : The Sequel) And, of
course, we've seen the worlds most revered ocean liner go down, letting 11
Oscars surface for old Jim (Titanic). And this summer, on the platter for
the American cinema audience, we get to watch planet Earth get nuked, not by
aliens, not by a giant monster (but we get to see New York City get trampled
(Godzilla)!), but by asteroids.</P>
<P>As an action movie, having given away the majority of its plot twists in the
promos, Deep Impact utterly fails. The writers, Michael Tolkin and Bruce
Joel Rubin, veterans of thriller-dramas (The Player and Ghost,
respectively), don't help, but the failure is due mostly to Mimi Leader, the
"ER" vet who, when she shipped herself onto the big screen with The
Peacemaker, started sinking her own career. She can't seem to actually
thrill the audiences for more than a few quick seconds, which are few and
far apart.</P>
<P>But, friends, it did not, like most of the B-rate disasters above (Titanic,
Apollo 13, and 2001 as the exclusion), come out like something put through
the grinder. The movie, through excellent writing and smart plot twists (in
the characters), has a human element rarely seen in the Action genre. This
is a great movie to take your kids too, totally appropriate for all ages, a
good movie for anyone who likes a drama to see, and, if you kind of like
drama and also like a few thrills but can't stand an all out rush, its worth
it too.</P>
<P>Long winded at points as it may be, Deep Impact will probably the best done
disaster movie of the year, and, as long as you can stand about two hours in
the theatre with only about thirty minutes of action, then it is absolutely
worth it.</P>
