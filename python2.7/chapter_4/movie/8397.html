<PRE>Batman and Robin    A Flim Review By Jesse A. Kaplan</PRE>
<P>Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger, Geroge Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Uma
Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, Elle McPhearson, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle
Directed by:  Joel Schulmaker</P>
<P>I don't even know where to start.  It's this simple:  BATMAN AND ROBIN
is the worst movie I have ever seen in the theatre.  Now I have seen
some bad ones.  CONGO, LAST ACTION HERO, THE BABYSITTER.  But this movie
sucks!!!!!!  I think Ed Wood is spinning in his grave.  I refuse to see
another Joel Schulmaker film again.  Why the hell did they make this
movie anyway?  George Clooney as Batman?  He sucked!!  Arnold
Schwarzengger, in the worst perrormance of his life as Mr. Freeze who
wants to freeze all of Gotham because his wife is dying.  Oh boo-hoo.
Who the hell cares.  Chris O'Donnell in a robin suit with nipples.
AHHH!!!! Someone save me.  Alicia Silverstone as the renegade chick with
attitude who forms yet another partnership in the batcave.  Give me a
break.  Where are the nipples on that costume hmmm?   Uma Thurman as
Poision Ivy? Ohhhh, suductive.  Yuck.  what an awful movie.  Throw in
faithful butler Alfred dying and giving stupid quotes to say along with
Elle McPhearson trying to act as Bruce Wayne's girlfirend and you have
Joel Schulmaker's worst flop ever.  I mean, the guy can direct some good
stuff such as A TIME TO KILL, but this movie is just plain stupid.
Also, I have never see nso much purple in my life!!!!</P>
<P>This is the first movie I am giving a 0.
mmensely by teenagers. I recommend the show to you and give it ***.</P>
<P><HR>**** = A must see film. Ex.  Starwars, Air Force One
  *** = Good show. Look for it.  Ex. Con Air, The Lost WOrld
    ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. Ex.  Speed 2, The Devil's Own</P>
<PRE>      * = Poor show. Don't waste your money.  Ex. 8 Head's in a
dufflebag
      0 = Totally and painfully unbearable picture. Ex. Congo, Batman
and Robin</PRE>
<P>Oh yea, YES there is going to be a 5th film of batman.  Rumor has it to
feature the Scarecrow and a female joker of some sort.  Yawn!!  I can't
wait for the Winnie the Pooh film at this rate.</P>
