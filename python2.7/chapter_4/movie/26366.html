<P>MPAA: Rated PG-13 for violent images.<HR></P>
<PRE>RATING: 9/10 - BEST PICTURE - #6 </PRE>
<P>"I think that  I am a reflection of the moon in the water. When you see me, and I am trying to be a good man, you see yourself". 
- The 14th Dalai Lama, "Kundun" </P>
<P>The sons of Genghis Khan gave the Dalai Lama his name. It means "Ocean
of Wisdom". In a wartorn Asia, Tibetans have practiced non-violence
for over a thousand years. The Dalai Lama is their ruler. He is the
human manifestation of the Buddha of Compassion.</P>
<P>In 1933 the 13th Dalai Lama died. Four years later, a holy man,
disguised as a servant, found himself in a far corner of Tibet. He was
searching for the 14th Dalai Lama. His search was almost at an end.</P>
<PRE>A Buddha had been reborn. </PRE>
<P>Undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of the year, 'Kundun' is
a rare cinematic experience, that intoxicates you with its majestic
poetry, beauty and spiritual symbolism. It is also the most
unexpected, coming from a director whose style and history makes him
the last possible choice ( with the exception of directors such as
nJames Cameron and Roland Emerich) for a picture such as this. The
director is Martin Scorsese. Yes, the same Martin Scorsese that gave
you 'Raging Bull', 'Taxi Driver' , 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' . Believe
me, there is nothing in his latest picture that suggests that you're
watching 'A Martin Scorsese Film', with the exception of the
incredible talent that he has with storytelling.</P>
<P>``Kundun'' is structured as the life of the 14th Dalai Lama, but he is
simply a vessel for a larger life or spirit, continuing through
centuries. That is the film's strength, and its curse. It provides a
deep spirituality, but denies the Dalai Lama humanity; he is permitted
certain little human touches, but is essentially an icon, not a
man. His human needs are therefore completely overseen by his advisors
and teachers. The sudden transition from being a child to becoming the
spiritual ruler of Tibet, does have a terrible price. The tragedy is
of course the complete alienation from the world that this little boy
knew, from his parents and friends. The loss of childhood and humanity
comes simultaneously with the demand of the impossible from a child:
wisdom, rightisnous, commitment and purity of soul. The Chinese have
invaded Tibet. Kundun, frightened and confused, asks his advisors in
disappear: ``What can I do? I'm only a boy.'' His advisers say, ``You
have chosen to be born again. You must know what to do.'' Unlike
Scorsese's portrait of Jesus in ``The Last Temptation of Christ,''
this is not a man striving for perfection, but perfection in the shape
of a man. The film is made of episodes, not a plot. It is like
illustrations bound into the book of a life. Most of the actors are
real Tibetan Buddhists, and their serenity in many scenes casts a
spell.</P>
<P>There is a world somewhere that doesn't base itself on war, where
technology does not exist. Where people live in total harmony with
nature that surrounds them. Majestic mountains, that shine like
gigantic diamonds in the sunlight, cast silver sparkles into the
waters that are as clear as the mountain-air. A castle of colors and
light can be seen in the horizon. Indeed the production designer Dante
Feretti ('Dracula', "Interview With The Vampire") has created a world
of mystique and color that is more magical than any fairytale. His set
and costume design proves invaluable, providing the unformed clay that
the cinematographer Roger Deakins ('Fargo') moulds with light and
shade, adding life and emotion to Feretti's mystical structures. It's
exceptionally beautiful, almost hypnotizing -- a swirl of sound and
illumination. Philip Glass' score, composed using native Tibetan
instrumentation, enhances the rarefied atmosphere. Glass's familiar
compositional techniques are wedded on Kundun to a sensitive use of
ethnic instruments and the voices of the Gyuto Monks, adding an aura
of spiritual power missing from most Hollywood fare. The incredible
blend of technical and visual achievements form a collection of
magical images of pure artistic wizardry that will hold you under
Scorsese's spell for these 2 hours .</P>
<P>Scorsese's picture is not a film that debates about the dogmas of
Buddhism, nor does it concentrate on the battle between religion and
politics. But it does clearly depict how the control of the
totalitarian system kills all hope, magic and individuality. It does
also portray the contrast between the ancient world and the
'progressive' society, clearly symbolized by the silent battle between
heavenly colors of light and the void of darkness. Is it possible to
survive without conflicts and war, and uphold the ancient traditions
in our rapidly changing world? Most of all it is a spiritual
journey. Scorsese opens the door to a world beyond our reach and
comprehension. A way of life so different from ours that it gives us
the opportunity to meditate over our western life style and
society. It is simply one of the most magical, rare films that have
entered the silver screen for some time.</P>
