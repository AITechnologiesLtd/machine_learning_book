<P>Plot: Not long after the death of his two children, Christy Nielsen is 
killed by a colliding car while going to aid a car crash victim. He 
finds himself in the afterlife which is not any traditional Heaven or 
Hell but a landscape of one's own imagination - he having composed his 
out of the classical artworks his wife Annie restored - and where one 
can inhabit whatever body they choose. But then comes the news that 
Annie, unable to handle the loss, has committed suicide. Here suicides 
are not condemned of Hell but a world wrapped in their own 
self-absorption. Christy ignores all warnings that he will be dragged 
down into her  closed-off world to venture in and save her.</P>
<P>New Zealander Vincent Ward is one of the most fascinating directors at 
work anywhere in the world at the moment. Ward trained as an artist at 
Canterbury University (only a few departments away from me) before 
turning to film- making. As a director he has an artist's fascination 
with the visual image - one cannot think of any other director in the 
world who would model the entire look of a film on the work of classical 
artists. His first feature film ‘Vigil' (1985) is an extraordinarily 
composed poem written in landscape and light which almost entirely 
circumvents narrative to work on a level of pure imagery alone. The 
Cannes-acclaimed ‘The Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey' (1988) was a time 
travel fantasy that Ward painted in the imagery of artists like Bruegel 
and Bosch that offered a haunting outsider's look in on the alienness of 
the 20th Century.</P>
<P>Ward lost the plot somewhat with 1992's ‘Map of the Human Heart', an 
Innuit romance where his fascination with imagery neglected the film's 
crucial emotional core. And since ‘Map' Ward's output has been erratic - 
he caught among the revolving door of directors attached to ‘Alien3' and 
only ending up with story credit and then being forced to direct 
commercials and take bit parts in films like `Leaving Las Vegas' (1995) 
and ‘One Night Stand' (1997) in order to stay off the unemployment line.</P>
<P>But ‘What Dreams' is Ward's return to form and his most mainstream 
release yet. It is an adaption of the 1984 novel by acclaimed genre 
novelist/screenwriter Richard Matheson, author of the likes of ‘The 
Incredible Shrinking Man', ‘Duel', most of Roger Corman's Poe films in 
the 1960s, and numerous ‘Twilight Zone' and ‘Star Trek' episodes, among 
others. Ward's work on the film is quite extraordinary. He lights the 
screen up with impossible vistas of the imagination - a vast library 
where gondoliers drift through canals between the bookshelfs; Williams 
having to walk across a sea of living faces as he enters Hell; valleys 
and oceans filled with castles and cities that have been constructed out 
of works by classical masters amongst which people nonchalantly fly; 
houses casually sitting amidst the Gothic arches of the roof of an 
inverted cathedral. In an extraordinary synthesis of artistic vision and 
cutting edge digital effects technology, Ward gets to literally paint on 
film. In the most wondrous section Robin Williams steps into a landscape 
that is a Van Gogh painting come to life, slipping and sliding through 
the paint of some of the giddiest and brightest oil colours imaginable. 
The sheer breadth of Ward's vision is astounding.</P>
<P>One of Ward's failings in the past has been a fascination with imagery 
at the expense of emotional soul. But thanks to a good cast and an 
especially strong script, he has ample compensation here (apart from 
Annabella Sciorra whose bland performance makes one wonder what 
Williams's love is really all about). The film's humanist reworking of 
the Orpheus and Eurydice legend at the climax is emotionally powerful. A 
landmark achievement.</P>
