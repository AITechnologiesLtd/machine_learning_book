<P>     Eureka!  Why didn't I think of it earlier?  It's amazing how
sometimes these things get past a person.  To what am I referring?
Why, TERMINAL VELOCITY, of course.  For a moment, I almost thought this
was a serious movie.  But, upon careful consideration, I've come to a
different conclusion.  I mean, a movie this funny has to be a satire,
right...?  The only problem is, I don't think the filmmakers share my
view.</P>
<P>     It is possible to enjoy TERMINAL VELOCITY once you realize how
truly awful a film it is.  In fact, it's only then when it becomes
fun.  In terms of laughs, there are moments of high mirth.  The
question is: how much of the humor is intentional?  Sadly, given the
way the film was put together, the answer is likely to be
disappointing.  Intent, however, does little to limit effect.  Why else
do people find PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE so engaging? (No, TERMINAL
VELOCITY is nowhere near that quality level.)</P>
<P>     I have never admired Charlie Sheen as an action hero.  He does the
wise-cracking okay, and he's not bad in a fight, but there's one major
asset he lacks:  an accent.  How can you take anyone serious in this
sort of movie when they sound like they were born in this country?
Even Steven Seagal has an accent of sorts ... it's called a monotone.</P>
<P>     Ah, but then there's Nastassja Kinski, and she has the accent.
Given the way she takes command, it becomes apparent who the real
muscle in this movie is.  Sheen is just along for the ride (so to
speak)--a "male love interest."  That doesn't really fit, though,
because he gets top billing.  Then along comes the scene with the
freefalling car, and it all clicks into place.  Sheen isn't the action
hero or the token beefcake.  He's the comic relief.</P>
<PRE>     Then again, maybe not...</PRE>
<P>     The plot takes preposterousness to new levels.  I doubt even
Forrest Gump would be able to suspend his disbelief enough to swallow
what this movie has to offer, worm and all.  It's about a former KGB
agent named Chris Morrow (Kinski) who decides to go skydiving one
afternoon.  Her teacher, a guy with the unlikely appellation of Ditch
Brodie (Sheen), is so intent on getting her into bed that he doesn't
notice when she takes an unsupervised jump out of the plane.  A few
minutes later, she goes splat, and he's left nursing his guilt and
facing a possible manslaughter charge.  However, when he visits the
dead girl's apartment, he learns that things may not be quite as they
look.</P>
<P>     The dialogue is as hard-boiled as it comes.  These are the kinds
of lines that once made dime-store novels so popular.  And it's not
just occasional.  "Pack the bags--we're going on a guilt trip" happens
to be my favorite, but there are lots more to choose from.</P>
<P>     TERMINAL VELOCITY has an unfair advantage over many other bad
movies: it's too raucous to put anyone to sleep.  There are enough
explosions, gun fights, and loud music to arouse the attention of even
the most disinterested viewer.  Laughably preposterous--yes;
boring--no.  It's an experience, all right--albeit one that most people
can do without.</P>
