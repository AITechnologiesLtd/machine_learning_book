<PRE>                           THE GREAT WHITE HYPE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     Witty and satiric, The Great White Hope never lets up.  The
Reverend Fred Sultan (Sanuel L Jackson) is the ultimate con man who
is, among other things the manager and boxing promoter of the World's
Champion, "James, The Grim Reaper," (Damon Wayans). James is always
asking when he is going to see some of the millions that his boxing has
earned him but the Reverend has the ready smile, the hug, and "Brother,
I love you" as the ready answer to James . . . and to everyone else.</P>
<P>     The thread of the story is that James is worried that the
number of people attending the boxing matches is dropping and
realizes the black public  is getting tired of seeing "one black
brother beating up another black brother."   The solution, suggested
by his gorgeous assistant, Bambi (Salli Richardson), is to get a
white fighter dumb enough to take on the champ;  hence "The Great
White Hype."   Fortunately, she knows someone, Terry Conklin (Peter
Berg) from her past who did once beat James in an amateur boxing
match.</P>
<P>     Although everyone  in the cast has some input into making the
film a knockout, Peter Berg steals the movie with his very sincere
goals in life but dumb enough to think he can beat the champ..
When they find Terry he is no longer interested in boxing.  He plays
the guitar in a coffee house and all he is interested in is saving
the world's homeless.   If the money he wins in the match will go to
ending the homeless situation of the world, he will agree to the
fight.   That is one of the many satiric parts of the film, a boxer
interested in the homeless.    You will love the scowling, husky,
menacing guardians (including the one who does a 10-second dance
while on duty) who follow the Reverend.   Let us not forget Michael
Kane (Jeff Goldblum) who is trying for a Pulitzer prize by exposing
the Reverend's "private" life.</P>
<P>     In leading supporting roles are John Lovitz, John Rhys-Daniels,
Cheech Marin and Corbin Bernsen.</P>
