<P>Supernova is one super mess.  This sci-fi film is highly derivative, but
not even of decent space flicks.  It seems to have chosen only the bad
ones to rip off.  The story is simple:  A spaceship picks up a really
bad guy that tries to off everyone aboard.  Typically, he can also heal
his own injuries.  And speaking of being able to heal your own injuries,
here's a person that can't – Walter Hill.  The Last Man Standing
director asked that his name be taken off of the credits after the
studio recut the film.  Reportedly, Francis Ford Coppola reshot several
scenes.</P>
<P>The spaceship in question is the Nightingale, an emergency rescue vessel
that gets a five-day-old distress call from a mining colony located over
3,000 light years away.  Thanks to choppy editing, the complete lack of
character set-up and the weirdly similar hair colors/styles, the six
people aboard the Nightingale are tough to tell apart.  There's Dr.
Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett, Music of the Heart) – the black one – and
Benj Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz, Party of Five) – the one with the beard.
The other four all have short, black haircuts.</P>
<P>Rushing to the origin of the S.O.S. call, the Nightingale `jumps' into a
high gravity field, where debris from a moon damages the craft's
engines, leaving a precious eleven-minute window between the point of
recharge and being sucked into a giant sun.  To make matters worse, the
captain (Robert Forster, Psycho) doesn't survive the jump and creepy
recovering drug addict Nick Vanzant (James Spader, 2 Days in the Valley)
takes control of the mission.</P>
<P>But Nick doesn't seem nearly as disturbing as the person that placed the
distress call.  He's Troy Larson (Peter Facinelli, Can't Hardly Wait),
the son of some renowned space baddie.  He's pure evil and makes
everyone nervous, yet somehow is still able to nail the mouth-breathing
white girl Danika Lund (Robin Tunney, End of Days), despite the fact
that she's considering parenthood with her fellow space cadet boyfriend
Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips, Bats).  And the Nightingale picks
up not only this space hitchhiker, but also a strange nine-dimensional
substance that, of course, can wipe out humanity.</P>
<P>The laughable plot (or lack thereof) comes from David Campbell Wilson,
whose only other screenwriting credit is Jeff Speakman's martial arts
extravaganza The Perfect Weapon.  There are a couple of cool parts, like
the exterior shots of the Nightingale, and the fact Danika and Yerzy had
to fill out an application to be approved before they could consider
bringing another life into the world.  Hopefully in the future, it will
be as complicated to make a bad film as it is to reproduce.</P>
<P>1:41 - PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, adult situations and enough
near nudity to fend off an R rating</P>
