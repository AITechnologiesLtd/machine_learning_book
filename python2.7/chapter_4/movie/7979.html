<PRE>                         MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING
                       A film review by David Rind
                        Copyright 1997 David Rind</PRE>
<P>There have been too many negative reviews in ramr of this movie.</P>
<P>MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is a wonderful film.  It opens with a sweetly
choreographed lipsynch number under the opening credits and has several
more magical scenes over the course of the movie.  Although the plot and
dialog are a bit thin, this is more than made up for by these scenes and
at least one superb performance.</P>
<P>The plot centers around a woman (Julianne -- Julia Roberts) learning
that her long-time best friend (Michael -- Dermot Mulroney) has decided
to marry another woman (Kimmy -- Cameron Diaz).  Suddenly jealous, she
decides that she will do what it takes to break them up, but is unsure
how to go about it.</P>
<P>The movie is fair to its plot line and its characters.  Julianne
concocts one over-the-top devious plot to try to anger Michael about
Kimmy, but for the most part she simply plays on the fears and concerns
of the engaged couple.  Kimmy and Julianne are both legitimately
believable love interests for Michael.</P>
<P>Singing and music are used as centerpieces of several scenes, including
the opening credits, a scene in a Karaoke bar, and two scenes with
Julianne's editor (George -- Rupert Everett), a gay man who is played
without any of the usual Hollywood humor/stereotypes.  There is a scene
where George leads a room in singing "I Say a Little Prayer for you"
that is funny, touching, charming, and fun.  I have not seen Rupert
Everett in other roles, but he is great here.</P>
<P>There is also one touching scene without music that speaks to all the
brief romantic moments that can sometimes slip away.  This is a movie
that while being basically a comedy at its heart, has a lot of true
things to say about relationships and romance, just as WHEN HARRY MET
SALLY did.  See this movie.  (Rating 4 out of 5)</P>
