                          LEAVING LAS VEGAS
                    A film review by Andrew Hicks
                     Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1995) ***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        I don't think there's been a movie since SCHINDLER'S LIST, 
or at least DEAD MAN WALKING, that I've been so involved in that it 
was nearly impossible to get through. Adapted from the John O'Brien 
novel, LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a portrait of depression that wraps us 
up in two people, making us know, care and sympathize with them, 
then leaves us helpless in watching them destroy themselves. This 
uncompromising Mike Figgis film is an incredible emotional 
experience that leaves out all the usual Hollywood trappings, save 
its two stars.</P>
<P>        Nicolas Cage plays a writer who has been leaving reality 
behind, on an escalating basis, since his wife left him. It's to the point 
where, from the moment he gets up in the morning until he passes out 
at night, he's in an alcohol-induced stupor and can't allow himself to 
sober up. So, when he embarrasses himself in front of some colleagues 
(including one of his fellow DRUNKS, Richard Lewis) and is fired 
from his job, he sells or burns everything he owns and heads to Las 
Vegas. He may not have much left, but with the Vegas gamblers, 
mafiosos, drunks and hookers, at least he'll be in good company.</P>
<P>        Cage's plan is to just keep drinking until he dies and, indeed, 
after one painful bank scene, we never see him sober again. Most of 
the time, he's guzzling down vodka or tequila like it's Evian water. In 
Vegas, he meets Elisabeth Shue, a street hooker he takes back to his 
$29 motel room. She wants to blow him, he wants to talk and it turns 
out she's just as lonely as he is. And she has her share of problems 
with abusive pimp Julian Sands slashing her butt cheeks after she 
returns from a night of work with less cash than required, plus it 
seems people just don't respect her profession. Hey, people, she 
works hard for the money!</P>
<P>        They work out a beneficially mutual relationship. She has 
someone to keep her warm nights and he has someone to take care of 
him -- feed him, clean up after him, direct him to the nearest place he 
can puke -- and both accept each other without trying to change them. 
Unfortunately, this means Shue will just have to sit by and watch as 
Cage's liver gets closer and closer to that of David Crosby and that 
Cage will have to share Shue with anyone who can cough up a couple 
hundred bucks, or $175 on double coupon day. But, for each of them, 
the other is the only caring person they know.</P>
<P>        Cage won an Oscar for LEAVING LAS VEGAS, and a 
completely deserved one at that. He's always fun in action movies and 
light comedies, but it's almost inconceivable that this is the same guy 
who starred in AMOS AND ANDREW and CON-AIR. His performance, 
in conveying the depression and hopelessness of his character while 
still making him seem human and likeable, in various states of 
drunkenness no less, goes far beyond anything else Cage has achieved. 
Shue, as the damned-if-she-do-damned-if-she-don't hooker with a 
heart of gold, is amazing too. This is a career reviving performance for 
the woman who seemed so innocent in fluff like ADVENTURES IN 
BABYSITTING.</P>
<P>        The relationship Cage and Shue have with each other is a 
Catch-22 in which disappointment and loss is inevitable, and once we 
as viewers realize this, we set ourselves up for the same frustration 
Shue's character must have, in caring but being unable to stop the path 
of destruction. LEAVING LAS VEGAS is utterly absorbing because the 
acting is so incredible, the characters compelling and the writing 
superior, but it's hard to keep watching because it seems so real and so 
sad. That was probably O'Brien's goal; he wasn't a happy man himself. 
He committed suicide shortly after selling the movie rights to 
LEAVING LAS VEGAS. There's probably a really sad movie in that 
story too.</P>
