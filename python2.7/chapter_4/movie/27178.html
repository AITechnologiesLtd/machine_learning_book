<P>Sort of a teenage version of "Dumb and Dumber," "Dude, Where's My Car?" is 
such a bad movie that it exhibits a sort of innocent charm. From the very 
first frame, the movie doesn't have any illusions that it's anything more 
than a self-proclaimed stupid comedy. Instantly forgettable and lacking 
anything resembling honest human emotions, the first half is so bright and 
silly that it gets your expectations up far too much. Its surprising success 
right from the get-go hurts the final product more than helps it, as its 
jokes quickly grows tiresome and repetitive, until the movie becomes almost 
unbearable in its final thirty minutes.</P>
<P>Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) are stoner best 
friends who wake up one morning to find that their car has disappeared. Not 
remembering anything from the drug-induced night before other than that their 
car holds their anniversary gifts for their girlfriends, Wilma (Marla 
Sokoloff) and Wanda (Jennifer Garner), Jesse and Chester set out to retrace 
their steps. With everyone they run into, another piece of the puzzle is 
filled in, from the advances of their voluptuous dream girl Christie Boner 
(Kristy Swanson), to their apparent visit to a strip club, to a case they had 
gotten hold of carrying thousands of dollars in cash, to a feuding group of 
alien hunters and actual extraterrestrial "chicks."</P>
<P>I've said it once already, and I'll say it again. "Dude, Where's My Car?" is 
so unabashedly dumb that you can't help but be a little impressed by its own 
throwaway trashiness. Aside from the tedious third act, the movie falls into 
the category of a guilty pleasure--the type of bad movie you can have fun 
with, rather than the type that is just plain awful ("Battlefield Earth" 
comes instantly to mind).</P>
<P>Ashton Kutcher (TV's "That 70's Shows") and Seann William Scott (2000's "Road 
Trip"), like Bill and Ted before them, make an instantly delightful duo of 
doofuses who have little on their minds, and are having a hell of a time in 
the process. Kutcher, especially, stands out as having quite an enjoyable 
presence, and it's not difficult to see him making more substantial motion 
pictures in the future. Since Jesse and Chester fill up every frame, they 
leave little room for anyone else. Marla Sokoloff (2000's "Whatever It 
Takes") and Jennifer Garner (TV's "Felicity") are briefly on hand as their 
respective girlfriends, while the unfortunate Kristy Swanson (1999's "Big 
Daddy") has clearly fallen on hard times by taking such a wasted role.</P>
<P>There are a couple comic sequences that work extremely well--far more than 
they have any right to. An encounter with a pushy, stubborn worker at a 
Chinese drive-thru, and a dog that does nothing but smoke pot and lie around, 
are admittedly a riot, as is an unpredictable kiss between the two male leads 
that rivals the on-screen smooch between Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1998's 
infinitely superior "BASEketball." All of these setpieces, however, appear by 
the 40-minute mark, and it is followed by a comic dead zone in the 
increasingly preposterous climax.</P>
<P>"Dude, Where's My Car?" is terrible as a film, yet passable entertainment as 
a movie. 13-to-16-year-olds will likely have the most fun, and one's 
tolerance for strictly juvenile humor will decide what other age frame might 
enjoy such fodder. Credit director Danny Leiner and screenwriter Philip Stark 
for one thing: they realize "Dude, Where's My Car?" is akin to a piece of 
fecal matter, and have a great time living up to such a low honor.</P>
