<PRE>                                THE SWEET HEREAFTER
                       A film review by David N. Butterworth
                        Copyright 1997 David N. Butterworth</PRE>

<P>Towards the middle of "The Sweet Hereafter," a crowded school bus skids on
an icy road surface as it rounds a bend, careens through the steel guard
rail, and disappears out of sight.  Then, in long shot, we see the vehicle
slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field.  It pauses for
a moment before the "field" cracks under the bus' weight and the bright
yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment, a single smooth second of
time.</P>
<P>Compare that scene, if you will, to the last eighty minutes of "Titanic,"
when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise, and
you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films.</P>
<P>The scene in "The Sweet Hereafter" epitomizes all that's right with
independent Canadian director Atom Egoyan's film.  It's not sensational.
We don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming, terrified
children being bloodied and battered about.  The bus doesn't explode or
break into a thousand tiny pieces.  It simply leaves the road and silently
slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake.  It's a horrifying sequence
made all the more so by calm and distance.</P>
<P>Using a non-linear approach to his narrative, Egoyan shifts back and
forward in time, connecting us with the inhabitants of the small British
Columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy.  Fourteen
children died in the accident, leaving their parents and the town itself
paralyzed with grief.</P>
<P>The catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser Mitchell
Stephens (a wonderfully moving performance by Ian Holm), who comes to Sam
Dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit.</P>
<P>Stephens, who "doesn't believe in accidents," functions as a concerned,
involved observer, scribbling details in his notebook and providing the
parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing
aftermath.  While Stephens' initial drive may be financial (one third of
the total settlement if he wins), his involvement provides him more with an
outlet to come to grips with his own loss.  His self-destructive,
drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics, halfway houses and
detox units for years.</P>
<P>Egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so
impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a
plaintive cry.  Mychael Danna, who composed the shimmering music for "The
Ice Storm," contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles.
Equally impressive is Paul Sarossy's cinematography, capturing the imposing
Canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy
interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate
portions of a room.</P>
<P>"The Sweet Hereafter," while undeniably grim, urges the viewer to grab onto
life with both hands and not let go.  It's a film of generous subtlety and
emotion.</P>
