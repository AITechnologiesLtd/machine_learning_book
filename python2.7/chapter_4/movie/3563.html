<PRE>                                WIDOWS' PEAK
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     WIDOWS' PEAK is a quirky little Irish comedy and mystery from the
director (John Irvin) of Turtle Diary.  It features Mia Farrow as the
mysteriously angry, local Irish woman who is convinced that the
mysterious new English/American stranger, played by Natasha Richardson
is "up to murder".</P>
<P>     The town is populated by rich widows who live on a hill nicknamed
WIDOWS' PEAK.  Joan Plowright plays the matriarch of the women.  All of
the poor folks live down in the town except for poor widow Farrow who
mysteriously lives on the peak.  Adrian Dunbar is Plowright's son, and
he falls head over hills in love with the new stranger.</P>
<P>     The movie is pure fluff.  It is rated PG.  They said one mild four
letter word I think to avoid getting the kiss of death of a G rating
which most theatergoers thinks means that adults must be accompanied by
a child under the age of 6 to attend and must turn off their brain on
entering.</P>
<P>     Mia Farrow and Natasha Richardson are both a delight to watch.
Just quirky enough but never overacting.  Lots of great Irish scenery
in the movie so if you get bored, just ignore the actors and watch the
cinematography (Ashley Rowe) of the Irish countryside and town.</P>
<P>     There is frankly not much in the movie.  The mystery is fun, but
pretty lightweight.  It has a nice ending which is sort of easy to
guess.  The script (Hugh Leonard) is lightweight but with a few good
laughs.</P>
<P>     WIDOWS' PEAK runs about right at 1:41.  It is correctly rated PG
and kids over about 8 may like it.  I give it a mild thumbs up and rate
it ** 1/2.  It never offends, rarely bores, and is a pleasant
diversion.  A relaxing, simple, feel good movie.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
