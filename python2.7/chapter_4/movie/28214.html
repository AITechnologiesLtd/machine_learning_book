<P>PLOT:
L'il Joey Dirt loses his parents at the Grand Canyon at the age of eight and
spends the next ten years of his life looking for them. During his grand
journey across the United States, Joe meets plenty of kooky characters, some
of whom just put him down and others who help him along the way.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
This movie is not what you'd expect. I went in looking for a short,
disposable film with lots of redneck and gross-out humor, but came out with
a long story, laced with a surprising amount of dramatic moments, little
laughs and a sweet side. And even though the film itself doesn't really come
through in the comedy department, I would still slightly recommend it on
video, since it does offer a cute FORREST GUMP-ish story, a truckload of
cameos and a couple of laugh-out loud scenes. But what the hell were they
thinking when they made this movie? I mean, it's got Adam Sandler and David
Spade's names all over it, the trailer features the four or five major
idiotic sequences from the film, but it's really just a slow-paced dramedy
about a kid who gets abandoned by his parents, with spurts of Farrelly
humor, which ultimately end up feeling out of place. Now I'm not suggesting
that they'd have tried to make an all-out drama out of this, but why not
sell it more as a cute comedy with some soft touches, rather than your
typical Sandleresque movie, since the latter will only leave people
disappointed in the end.</P>
<P>I actually stopped waiting for the laughs about halfway through this film
and tried to enjoy it as it was. With its wicked soundtrack packed with cool
tunes, fun cameos like Kid Rock showing off his acting chops and Christopher
Walken, once again, bringing the house down with yet another excellent
comedic performance. Now how's about giving this guy his own comedy
already?!? He's hilarious!! I will also admit to actually starting to care
for the Joe Dirt character, which is something I really didn't expect to do,
but with most of Spade's characteristic wise-cracks left behind him for a
change, it was nice to see him play someone with a heart. Of course, the
bevy of beauties gracing the screen throughout also didn't hurt the film
any, but someone please explain to me how these TOTAL babes always end up
going for Spade's goofy characters?? (see LOST & FOUND) Oh well, I guess
that's Hollywood! Anyway, the bottom line is that this flick doesn't come
through in the laughs department (save for a few rare moments), goes on for
way too long, but does offer some bitchin' tunes, a sweet story and a
character that is ultimately likeable, in that sorry-ass kind of way. See it
on video if you're looking for a few laughs and a cute story, but don't go
out of your way to get it, since it ain't really all that good.</P>
