<P>Well now I've seen everything. "Wing Commander," based on the popular 
video game and directed by the game's creator, Chris Roberts, makes 
1994's "Street Fighter" and, dare I say it, 1997's "Mortal Kombat: 
Annihilation," look good in comparison. The only thing I'd like to say 
is that I so very much wish the late Ed Wood (director of "Glen or 
Glenda" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space," both widely considered two of the 
worst films of all time) were alive today. After viewing "Wing 
Commander," even his immediate reaction would be, "what complete and 
utter garbage!"</P>
<P>Although I suffered through the entire 105-minute running time of "Wing 
Commader," I couldn't tell you what it was about if you paid me, and 
it's not because I wasn't paying attention, either. Instead of reading 
someone else's review and then trying to reword their synopsis of the 
story, I'm going to instead tell you what I did understand. Set during 
the 27th-century, there's this big space ship thingy in space with a big 
crew, which gets even bigger when a few new recruits board on, including 
two young men, Blair (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Maniac (Matthew Lillard). 
Every once in a while they go out in their own little space fliers and 
shoot other space thingys and blow them up. Blair is smitten with the 
wing commander of the crew (whatever that means), Deveraux (Saffron 
Burrows), even though she is a tough and stern little cookie who mostly 
ignores or hollers at him. Blair is also having some problems since 
people judge him because he's part-pilgrim ("My father was a pilgrim!"). 
Later, another crew member tells Blair, "there's nothing wrong with 
being a pilgrim." Meanwhile, Maniac likes the smart and sassy black crew 
member, Rosie (Ginny Holden), who is so sex-crazed and horny she gets 
off on flying space crafts and then blowing up in them! So, anyway, near 
the end, the crew has to fight the bad Kilrathis, people dressed up in 
clunky cat costumes with retractible Freddy Krueger claws who basically 
stand still in their spaceship and talk in "Kilrathian." At the end, a 
couple of the people we've grown to...well, grown to feel nothing for, 
get into danger and their lives are put at stake. They mostly pull 
through though and in the end, I wasn't sure what I had just sat and 
watched. </P>
<P>"Wing Commander" is such a mind-numbing, awful, embarrassing, idiotic, 
corny, ludicrous, laughable, superficial, just plain bad, movie that I 
almost couldn't believe my own eyes or ears most of the time. How could 
20th-Century Fox, the movie's studio, have the nerve to even release 
this...this...I can't even think of a word awful enough to criticize it 
with. Although they, no doubt, decided to release it wide after both 
Prinze Jr. and Lillard had huge success with the box-office hit "She's 
All That," "Wing Commander" is going to hurt their careers rather than 
help them, since I now relize that they both had absolutely no excuse to 
make this movie. Heck, Prinze Jr. would have been better off making, "I 
Still Think I Know, But Refresh My Memory About Twenty-Five Summers Ago" 
than this depressing "product," which might have been pretty funny if I 
hadn't been so sorry for the people involved in its making. Of course, 
they did get what they deserved since they obviously forgot to read the 
screenplay (if there even was one) prior to signing on. As for Saffron 
Burrows, how in the world could she go from the sweet, realistic 1995 
Irish film, "Circle of Friends," to this? </P>
<P>There's honestly not much else to say about "Wing Commander." I saw some 
Halloween cat costumes, some cheesy effects, and some stick people 
arguing about the nobility of being pilgrims. Several times while 
watching it, I clenched my eyes shut praying to fall asleep, but then I 
fought against it because I knew I'd have a little fun tearing the movie 
apart in my review if I stuck with it. When someone like Ed Wood, who 
loved all films, good or bad, would have laughed this movie off the 
screen, you know you're in trouble. Even Akiva Goldsman (the much-hated 
hack screenwriter who destroyed the "Batman" film series) would brush 
this waste of film space off as "rubbish." Roger Ebert once compared, in 
his review for 1996's "Mad Dog Time," the film to watching a blank 
screen for the same period of time. I'll go one step further and say 
that staring at a blank screen would be at least fifty times more 
entertaining and visually stimulating than all of "Wing Commander" 
combined.</P>
