<P>Plot: 1916, St Petersburg. When he is banished from the Tsar's court,

royal family and raises the masses to overthrow them. The young princess 
Anastasia flees to safety but grows up with no memory of her past. She

Anastasia in order to obtain the exiled dowager empress's fortunes. 
Gradually he comes to fall in love with her only for to discover that 
she really is Anastasia. Meanhile the evil Rasputin, banished to limbo, 
plots to kill her.</P>
<P>The career of animator Don Bluth is one that has been punctuated by a 
series of ironic reversals. Bluth and several associates left Disney 
Studios in 1975, unhappy at the studio's betrayal of the great animated 
tradition. (The period for Disney that had peaked between 1937 and 1945 
with the likes of `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', `Bambi', 
`Pinocchio', `Dumbo', `Fantasia' et al, and which had fallen into 
decline in the 1960s and 1970s with the banal likes of `The Sword and 
the Stone', `The Jungle Book', `Robin Hood' and `The Rescuers'). Vowing 
to make their own return to the Disney tradition, Bluth made the superb 
`The Secret of N.I.M.H.' in 1982, a beautifully constructed homage to 
the classic Disney films which can easily stand up alongside some of 
Disney's best. Unfortunately `N.I.M.H.' was not a success and Bluth was 
reduced to making far less ambitious, although passably enjoyable 
middle-of-the-road animated fare like `An American Tail' (1986), `The 
Land Before Time' (1988) and `All Dogs Go to Heaven' (1989). But even 
more sadly Bluth's work in the 1990s - `Rock-a-Doodle' (1991), 
`Thumbelina' (1994), `A Troll in Central Park' (1995) - sank to an 
insipid banality far below Disney ever at their worst. The great irony 
then was that Disney from about 1991 onwards started to recapture their 
own classic tradition with a series of epic animated features - the 
likes of `Beauty and the Beast' (1991), `Aladdin' (1992), `The Lion 
King' (1994), `Pocahontas' (1995), `Toy Story' (1995), `The Hunchback of 
Notre Dame' (1996) and `Hercules' (1997). The triple irony for Bluth is 
that Disney have been so successful at returning to what they do best 
that he has now found himself re-employed by a rival studio - 20th 
Century Fox - wanting to market their own brand of high-quality artistic 
animated features in the same Disney tradition. Indeed it seems 
everybody is now trying to make epic animated films - 1998 is going to 
be a big year for animation buffs with `Anastasia' from Fox; Disney's 
`Mulan' later in the year; Spielberg's Dreamworks SKG putting out `The 
Prince of Egypt' - an animated version of `The Ten Commandments'; 
Warner's `The Magic Sword: Quest for Camelot'; and `A Bug's Life' from 
the `Toy Story' people.</P>
<P>The good news is that `Anastasia' is easily the best film Bluth has made 
since `N.I.M.H.'. It allows him again the budget to make a film that 
uses a really large-screen artistic canvas. And it is even, at least in 
my view, a better animated film than the last few Disney films - 
`Hunchback' and `Hercules' - have been. It gets the whole balance just 
right - some marvellously exciting action sequences aboard in particular 
a runaway train; a light but not excessive lineup of songs; just a touch 
of romance; a likeable supporting cast of small cuddly talking animals - 
and winds it all into an enjoyably well-rounded story. It is perhaps in 
the end sight a film that falls short of standing up there among the 
great animated Disney classics like `Snow White', `Bambi' or `Fantasia', 
but one that can quite ably hold its own at least on the second rung of 
Disney films among the likes of `Sleeping Beauty', `Cinderella' or `101 
Dalmatians'.</P>
<P>My only quibble with it might be its rather dubious historical 
authenticity. As the unearthing of the remains at Ekaterinberg in recent 
years has conclusively proved (except to all bar the Russian Orthodox 
Church), Anastasia did not manage to escape the same fate as the rest of 
the Romanovs, which leaves the film in the rather embarrassing position 
of basing itself on a proven fraudulent story. The unearthing of the 
Romanov remains was well publicised and the film could hardly not have 
known about this when it went into production. Even more amusing is the 
story's managing to sweep aside almost all details of the Russian 
Revolution. Seemingly as though Hollywood is still haunted by the spirit 
of McCarthy blacklisting, not a single mention will you find anywhere of 
Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Indeed the film rather amazingly comes out to 
state that the entire Revolution was not a people's uprising against a 
cruel and incompetent aristocracy but rather was all down to the 
black-hearted Rasputin selling his soul in revenge for being banned from 
the Tsar's court. (The Communist Revolution all down to Satanism - one 
wonders if they might not be able to make a case for an ultra-right 
fundamentalist subtext somewhere there !).</P>
