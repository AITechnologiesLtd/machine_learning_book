<PRE>                              ROSEMARY'S BABY
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1968) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Can you say "dated"? You can if you've seen ROSEMARY'S 
BABY which, like THE EXORCIST, was a thrilling horror film in its 
time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed 
since its original release. "Mystery Science Theater 3000" has 
skewered the bad films of the past, but let me tell you, it could do a 
number on the "good" ones too. ROSEMARY'S BABY stars Mia 
Farrow (from the time she was actually good-looking) as an 
innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband (John 
Cassavettes), an actor who takes an easy, albeit evil, road to 
success.</P>
<P>        It all seems so harmless in the beginning. Mia and John 
move into an apartment where several past murders have been 
committed. (There's also a skull in the living room, but it's only for 
decoration.) Their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming. 
All's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film, until Mia 
eats some of the neighbors' chocolate mousse and passes out. 
When she comes to, she finds herself in a darkened room with a 
bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big, evil 
man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with Woody 
Allen.</P>
<P>        It seems like a dream and, when she finds herself pregnant, 
she almost forgets about it. And everyone's helping with the 
pregnancy. The neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions 
for her to drink, a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck, 
and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66.6 
years. Meanwhile, Mia begins having chronic stomach pains and 
losing a lot of weight. Before too long she looks just like the lead 
singer of The Cranberries. That's when you know your health's 
failing.</P>
<P>        The only person in the movie who's the least bit suspicious 
of all this is an old friend (Maurice Evans) who calls Mia up to give 
her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma. By about the 
two-hour mark I felt the same way. ROSEMARY'S BABY is way too 
long, and leads up to a payoff that's about as boring and laughable 
as the rest of the movie. I guess someone put a spell on this movie.</P>
