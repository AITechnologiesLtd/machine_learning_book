<PRE>                             WIDE SARGASSO SEA
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1993 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     WIDE SARGASSO SEA is a film directed by John Duigan.  The case
includes Karina Lombard, Nathaniel Parker, Rachel Ward, and Michael
York.  Music is by Stewart Copeland.  Rated NC-17, for (frontal) nudity
and sexual situations.</P>
<P>     John Duigan is a great Australian director who has made his
reputation with small, personal films including FLIRTING and THE YEAR
MY VOICE BROKE.  In adapting Jean Rhys' 1966 novel to the screen,
Duigan has eschewed the small, the personal, the Australian and given
us a slight and slightly dull Gothic romance.  He turns the beauty of
Jamaica into a moody, dangerous haunt and peoples it with ciphers whose
actions we cannot begin to understand, unless we ourselves just happen
to be characters in a bodice-ripper.  Rhys was bold enough to take the
moody hero of JANE EYRE, Edward Rochester (played by Nathaniel Parker),
and attempt to explain why he was the way he was to poor dear Jane.
Probably not that good of an idea to be begin with.  And Duigan cannot
help but make more of a muddle of the thing.</P>
<P>     Rochester's first wife, mad and locked away in the attic, turns
out to have been Antoinette Cosway, the creole daughter of an English
planter and ex-slave-holder and his French wife.  One nice thing about
Antoinette's story is that we get to see Michael York and Rachel Ward
in brief parts as the parents.  Antoinette, played by newcomer Karina
Lombard, is eventually married off to the penniless second son of a
wealthy English family.  After some initial difficulties, they settle
into one of her family houses tucked up in the mountains and enjoy what
is supposed to uninhibited lovemaking.  As these things go it isn't
much and probably the only reason the film got its NC-17, which Duigan
reputedly set out to get, is a lamentably short shot of Parker's
penis.</P>
<P>     Both of the principals are handsome people and look marvelous in
the nude.  Duigan hasn't given them a lot to do in or out of their
clothes.  And most of their actions are pretty hard to fathom.  He gets
a poison-pen letter that his wife has the seeds of insanity in her and
suddenly he no longer loves her.  *And* she starts to lose it.</P>
<P>     Lombard is no great shakes as an actor and that doesn't help us
any to understand her character.  Parker's acting is better, but
meaningless and unmotivated.  Some of the black supporting actors are
actually interesting performers especially the woman who plays a
combination witch and nanny and another woman who plays one of the
servants with a combination of coldness and pity and secret jokes that
is quite appealing.</P>
<P>     I cannot recommend WIDE SARGASSO SEA to anyone at any price,
except die-hard Duigan fans, perhaps.</P>
