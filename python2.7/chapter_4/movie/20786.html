<P>     In THREE KINGS, writer/director David O. Russell seems intent on
creating the quintessential debunking of the "official" Gulf War story.
Eight years ago, the war was treated as a great boost to national pride in
the midst of a recession, a pseudo-exorcism of the Vietnam demons and a
vision of the great bloodless techno-battle that would become the way of
warfare.  It was all night-vision and smart-bombs, desert shields and
protections of sovereignty -- a just war waged against a power-mad
dictator.  We were swept up in the images, watching our forces hammer away
towards a foregone conclusion.</P>
<P>     There's more than a little irony to the fact that THREE KINGS is just
as visually striking as the Gulf War, and nearly as shaky in its
substance.  The story focuses on a quartet of U.S. Army soldiers eyeing a
personal windfall as the war reaches its conclusion in March 1991.  Sgt.
Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), Staff Sgt. Elgin (Ice Cube) and Pvt. Conrad
Vig (Spike Jonze) discover a map they believe leads to a fortune in
plundered Kuwaiti loot.  Special Forces Capt. Archie Gates (George
Clooney) also learns of the map, but believes there's far more to be had
than cell phones and Rolexes -- specifically, bunkers filled with millions
in gold bullion.  The four men begin a journey into the heart of Iraq to
cash in, but they soon discover a nation still at war, and find that their
mission objectives keep shifting as they learn more.</P>
<P>     As a moderately revisionist history lesson, there's no question that
THREE KINGS both engages and enlightens.  Russell paints a picture of
American troops as rowdy kids celebrating victory in a war they barely
fought, while the brass concerns itself primarily with feeding reporters
stories to keep them happy.  Meanwhile, Iraqi citizens initiate rebellion
against Saddam Hussein after being promised support by America, then find
themselves slaughtered by Iraqi troops when it becomes clear that no
cavalry will be on its way.  THREE KINGS becomes a journey of discovery
for the four soldiers, their quest for personal gain gradually giving way
to a belief that they can't obey the orders that would have them abandon
Iraqi rebels to their deaths.</P>
<P>     Provocative moral dilemmas abound in THREE KINGS, which should be the
stuff of compelling drama.  Somehow, it just isn't.  The messages are
similar to those familiar from anti-war films like PATHS OF GLORY, M*A*S*H
and PLATOON -- war is even more hellish when policy has little to do with
humanity -- yet the characters are not nearly as strong.  While Clooney,
Wahlberg and company perform capably, Russell doesn't give them much to
work with beyond surface characterizations:  Gates the jaded veteran, Vic
the simple-minded hick, Barlow the naive family man, etc.  They're too
often placed in situations where other characters explain to them the real
horrors of the war, turning chunks of THREE KINGS into an informative
but stagnant lecture.  Russell wants to put a personal face on an
impersonal war, but he can only create an urgency of situation, not
urgency connected to the people in the situation.</P>
<P>     He can also create plenty of urgency with his stylistic flourishes,
of which plenty abound.  THREE KINGS is a genuinely eye-catching piece of
work in which Russell makes bold choices to drive home a point, from the
graphic internal images of a wounded body to the slow-motion punctuation
of bullet wounds as video game warfare tears through real flesh.
Unfortunately, the same impulse to drive a point home leads to scenes in
which a scene described in dialogue is simultaneously portrayed on screen.
Hearing an Iraqi soldier (Said Taghmaoui) describe his infant son's death
during a bomb raid is wrenching; watching the infant crushed by debris is
startling; combining the two is pure overkill.</P>
<P>     In retrospect, I'm not sure why I still admired THREE KINGS as much
as I did.  It's certainly an unconventional film, zig-zagging between dark
comedy and raw drama with surprising effectiveness.  Every once in a
while, Russell will do one of those little things that remind you how
invigorating cinema can be.  There's just not enough to shake the sense
that THREE KINGS is too enamored of its sense of historical importance.
All that remains is getting swept up in the images, watching Russell's
forces hammer away towards a foregone conclusion.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 kings over jack:  6.</PRE>
