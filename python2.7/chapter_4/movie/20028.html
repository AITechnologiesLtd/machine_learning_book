<P>Bowfinger, a Frank Oz film, stars two of today's Kings of Comedy, Eddie Murphy
and Steve Martin.  Murphy has been in a slump lately, as his last three films,
Life, Holy Man, and Dr. Doliitle, have come no where near where Murphy's
comedic talents were in 1996's The Nutty Professor.  Martin has been in a
comedic slump, as his last two mainstream comedies, The Out of Towners, and
Sgt. Bilko, are nowhere near as funny as Martin is in 1979's The Jerk, or his
Saturday Night Live performances.  Both actors are trying to redeem themselves
here with Bowfinger, but although their performances are hilarious, Bowfinger,
for the most part, fails to do so.</P>
<P>Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), founder and owner of Bowfinger International
Films, is pushing 50, and still hasn't gotten his big break in the film
business.  After his accountant, Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle), feeds him a
screenplay, entitled "Chubby Rain," in which aliens come down to earth in
raindrops, Bowfinger is determined to get Hollywood's top action star, Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), in the lead role.  After Kit declines any involvement
with the film, Bowfinger, with cast, including Daisy (Heather Graham), an
Ohioan who came to Hollywood to pursue acting, Carol (Christine Baranski), who
is still trying to get her big acting break, crew members Dave (Jamie Kennedy),
and a few Mexicans that he rallied up, decide to film around Kit, having his
actors walk up to him, rehearse their lines, and hope to get the right lines
back out.</P>
<P>Love the setup- Too bad the Steve Martin screenplay can't sustain the
cleverness it starts out with.  As Bowfinger is just getting started, while the
cast and crew follow Kit around constantly, the film is at its best, bringing
strong laughs, and snappy dialogue- but this is where everything tumbles
downhill. Bowfinger realizes that he can't get Kit for the closeups, so
therefore hires a look a like, Jiff (also Eddie Murphy).  Jiff is a nice,
innocent guy, whose only experience in the film business is renting actively at
Blockbuster and attending the cinema.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy works well in both roles, but the film doesn't have room for both.
 The film, at a short running time of 95 minutes, could work better if only
Jiff or Kit were the main focus, but the limited plot isn't strong enough for
both story lines.  If the main focus was filming Kit the entire time, without
him knowing it, Bowfinger could have been one of this year's funniest films. 
It's not that the character of Jiff isn't funny, it's that the two storylines
running against each other are uneven, and don't particularly work.  Now, maybe
if Jiff was there from the start, Bowfinger could have worked better, but once
Jiff enters the picture, the screenplay, and film, becomes a total mess. </P>
<P>Martin's screenplay works at times, as it pokes fun at Hollywood producers and
the entire Hollywood style.  Yet at other times, the screenplay has its major
difficulties, as it continuously throws lame jokes at you.  For example- Daisy
is supposed to spoof Hollywood actresses, and their disposable boyfriends, but
soon after weare informed of Daisy's sleazy ways, the character becomes
obnoxious, as jokes of Daisy's fall flat.</P>
<P>Bowfinger never seems to take off, as the entire film seems to hit the same
notes, repeatedly.  The only times we get variation from these notes is when
Christine Baranski is present, whose character in Bowfinger is completely
clueless as to why she can't meet Kit Ramsey, and in Chubby Rain is a knife
wielding alien who gives the film's best lines.  Baranski overdoes all of her
Chubby Rain lines, with extreme exaggerations in her voice, making for the
funniest character of the film.  Baranski is the standout here in Bowfinger, as
she turns the character that is given only two dimensions by the screenplay,
and forces it to three.</P>
<P>Heather Graham attempts comedy again here, after giving an applaudable
performance in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, and succeeds once again. 
Although the screenplay gives her an annoying character to work with, Heather
Graham makes the most of the it, and she delivers some big laughs as acting in
Chubby Rain, but when she isn't, she is simply a background image. </P>
<P>Eddie Murphy is stuck in another mediocre movie, but in this one, Murphy gives
an over the top, hands down hilarious performance.  Bowfinger isn't the usual
Eddie Murphy material, as Steve Martin is the main focus, but Murphy does his
share to add to the mediocrity of the film.  It's not fair to call Steve Martin
and Eddie Murphy a comedic duo, for the two barely have any screen time
together, but both give funny, credible performance as their developed
characters.</P>
<P>The screenplay uses many characters as Daisy does boyfriends, one after
another, for basically no reason.  Jamie Kennedy's talent goes to waste, as he
is used simply used to locate Kit at all times, or to obtain camera equipment. 
If the screenplay is going to bring characters like Kennedy's Dave in, it could
at least give personality/character development.  In another example, the
entire cheap/Mexican crew idea brings laughs at first, but did the film have to
carry them along the entire way?</P>
<P>Some of the gags in Bowfinger work, as the dog walking in high heels in an
empty parking lot, scaring Kit senseless, comes to mind, but many of the jokes
that have potential to be funny are dragged out, as we are supposed to be
laughing hilariously, but only a small grin may appear across your face.  Frank
Oz and Steve Martin have a good idea going for them, and a great cast, but
Bowfinger succeeds about as much as Bobby Bowfinger and crew do while trying to
film Kit Ramsey- Only somewhat.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin continue their slump of mediocre
films- But at least this one carries a few big laughs. </P>
