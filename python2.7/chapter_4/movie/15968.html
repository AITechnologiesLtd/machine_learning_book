<P>Flat out, "Elizabeth is a wonderful flick: as gorgeous to look at as a
Peter Greenaway film and as delightful to follow as a Stephen Frears
movie.  It's bold, lavish, mischevious, and downright entertaining, but
those aren't the reasons it's so good.  At the center of this film is a
performance of such immense power and complexity that perhaps we don't
fully comprehend the greatness now.  Cate Blanchett's performance as the
title character has already won her tons of accolades, a Golden Globe
nomination, and an almost sure-fire bet at nabbing an Oscar nod (she
better look out, though - back in 1995, when Nicole Kidman was
considered a sure-fire bet for an Oscar, she was snubbed come February
from even a nomination), but her performance still isn't as
well-received as it should be.</P>
<P>I think it's such a good performance because it's one of the few
performances by an actress in quite a while to actually be really
complicated.  She doesn't allow her character to be easily defined by
audiences and critics - she shows all her flaws, all her strengths, and
puts her character up for complex scrutiny and still remains
mysterious.  She does it all without overacting or underacting - she's
just right on.  She's sympathetic yet still a bit untrustworthy.  She's
definitely a force to be reckoned, but seems easy to crush.  And she
acts like the coolest person in the world, tossing out jokes to those
she works with, but is still a little frightened girl underneath.  Maybe
the best scene in the movie is one where we see two scenes juxtaposed:
one where she's speaking to parliament, cracking sarcastic jokes, and
winning them over; and another where she's preparing for this, nervoulsy
trying to come up with the right thing to say and the right way to say
it.</P>
<P>She's also the anchor in this entire film, which isn't, admittingly, the
greatest film I've ever seen.  The problem I think is that while the
film is setting up her character and her situations, it never truly
functions as a real cohesive story.  I said it was fun to follow, but
it's not the plot you're to follow, but rather the fact that deeds like
the ones that transpire in this film transpire at all.  Deceptions,
beheadings, burnings, and other sorts of treachery abound, and all with
the perfect visual flair from director Shekhar Kapur (I especially liked
the scene in the beginning where a group of protestants are burned alive
- the camera sweeps up, then cuts to various scenes below as members of
the audience react with either displeasure or with just the right amount
of taste that they toss another log onto the fire).  For a lot of the
film, I wasn't even exactly sure why they were being killed or people
were being avenged - I was just along for the ride.</P>
<P>This biopic on Elizabeth I deals with her first years on the throne,
following her half-sister's demise, and it perfectly captures the
turmoil England was in at the time, when Henry VIII had brought the
country to near Civil War between the Protestants and the Catholics, and
both sides were fighting eachother for power.  Elizabeth claims the
throne after a fit with her sister of her possible execution for being a
suspected Protestant, when all the time she was really just in the
moderate view on things, and once there, is forced to bring peace
between the two groups, and to learn her way around the country as she
went.</P>
<P>Equipped with many advisors (including one Richard Attenborough) and one
extremely devious assistant who helps her manipulate her way to peace,
Sir Francis Walshingham (Geoffrey Rush), who is so incredibly evil that
we can't help but love him for being evil for Elizabeth.  All this plays
around for two hours, as we watch these characters play off one another,
try to figure out how the pull the country out of a state of disaray,
and punish those who need to be punished (including the Catholic with a
vengeance Duke of Norfolk, played with intensity by Christopher
Eccleston).  All the while, she has to balance all that with her
relationship for an older lover, Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes, brother
to Ralph), who may not be around in her life much longer.</P>
<P>That said, "Elizabeth" is a wild ride, albeit a confusing one.  The plot
moves without stops and there is much that is a) not explained very well
(what the hell happened to Robert?), and b) is historically inaccurate
(a bit involving the death of Mary of Guise is hilariously askew).  But
despite this, "Elizabeth" is about as fun a film to watch as "Dangerous
Liasons" or "L.A. Confidential," if solely because the things that
transpire are handled with wit, and strong visual flair.  And at the
center is Cate Blanchett, who shows Elizabeth to be a real human being,
flaws and all: she's not a terrifically great person, but she's smart
and quick to learn, and has the lack of self-involvement to realize that
the problems with the country lie in the fact that the Catholics and
Protestants are too hell-bent on both being right, and if she has to
pervert things to fix this up, she better damn well do it.</P>
