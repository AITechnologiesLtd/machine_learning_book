                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     It's the year 2018 and the population explosion in the United
States is out of control.  The government has instituted laws that
prohibit a woman from having more than one baby, but when the only son
of John Brennick (Christopher Lambert) and his wife Karen (Loryn
Locklin) dies as an infant, the couple tries for another child--and
gets caught.  Both of them are sent to the most feared prison in the
country:  The Fortress, a maximum security establishment from which
escape is impossible.  To ensure prisoner cooperativeness, each new
entry is fitted with a globe in the intestines that, upon disobedience,
can cause either pain or death, depending on the nature of the
infraction.  The Fortress is not a nice place, and its director
(Kurtwood Smith) is an emotionless servant of machines.</P>
<P>     Every time a movie about the near future presents such a bleak
picture of life on Earth, I always hope for a reasonable explanation
about how things got so bad.  Personally, I don't think that's too much
to ask.  However, for the most part, the film makers don't agree
(apologies to pictures such as the TERMINATOR series), since they could
care less about such details.  They have a specific situation that
needs to be set up to tell their story; everything else is irrelevant.
FORTRESS falls right into that category.  We can make a few guesses
based on clues presented in the film, but even the best picture will be
incomplete.</P>
<P>     The pattern of this film is unusual.  Most movies, no matter how
good or bad, have peaks and valleys during the course of their running
time.  FORTRESS, on the other hand, while starting at a pretty high
level, manages a consistent downward trend throughout.  It's somewhat
out-of-the-ordinary to be able to say that a movie gets uniformly
worse with every passing scene.  It's only the strength of the
beginning that keeps this film from collapsing into the nether regions
inhabited by such nightmares as SPLIT SECOND, another science fiction
gorefest that takes place in a dreary near-future Earth.</P>
<P>     The early minutes of FORTRESS are brimming with promise.  Scenes
bristle with the potential of interesting characters, strong
interaction, and intelligent plot twists.  Alas, little or nothing
comes of most of these instances; they become a method of cruel
teasing, tantalizing the viewer with what might have been.  The film
degenerates from intriguing to routine to dumb, all in the space of
ninety minutes.  By the end, it's all formula.  The action has become
commonplace and the characters flat.</P>
<P>     The cast does a reasonable job.  Christopher Lambert is probably a
better actor than the role deserves, and he occasionally manages to
make Jack Brennick believable.  Similar praise goes to Loryn Locklin,
an attractive blonde who infuses her character with strength of mind
and heart.  Lincoln Kilpatrick does as much as he can with a secondary
part, creating one of the few minor characters that the audiences comes
to care about.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, FORTRESS is nonsense, even if the slick futuristic
setting tries to put a new spin on the tried and true chase sequences.
Once the slant of the script changes from exploring the internal
mechanisms of the Fortress to following Brennick's escape plans, the
movie is sunk.  It's also at this point that significant plot
implausibilities start cropping up.</P>
<P>     One thing FORTRESS has going for is an impressive visual style--at
least for those who can stand a lot of gore.  There are exploding
stomachs, dismembered bodies, and a great deal of blood--all done
quite graphically, for the most part (would you expect anything
different from the director of RE-ANIMATOR?).  The set design is
excellent, and the action scenes are well-paced, if lacking in
legitimate surprises.</P>
<P>     FORTRESS isn't terrible science fiction, but it's far from the
top.  Hampered by a storyline that never reverses a downward trend, the
movie is unable to get on course.  Instead of entering the rarefied
atmosphere inhabited by such films as ALIENS and the original
TERMINATOR, it falls in line with the likes of FREEJACK and ALIEN 3.
Not the best company to be in, but it could be worse.  Watch SPLIT
SECOND and you'll understand how bad things can get in this genre.
After that experience, FORTRESS will look like high art.</P>
