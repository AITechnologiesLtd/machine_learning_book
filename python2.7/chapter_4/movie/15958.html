<PRE>The Thin Red Line (1998)
A review by George Wu</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  ***1/2 (out of 4)</PRE>
<P>What I look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection.  Sometimes a
movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have, I will
prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking.  The Thin
Red Line is flawed but it provokes.  Terence Malick returns to filmmaking
20 years after Days of Heaven and produces this meditative look at war. 
Unlike this year's Saving Private Ryan, which dwells on war as a necessary
evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof, The Thin Red Line simply
says war is waste.  While that might seem obvious to some, only after
experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is.  Saving
Private Ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur
and it has a great cost; The Thin Red Line says idealistically avoid this
at all costs.  One message is not necessarily more correct than the other. 
It just depends on one's point of view.  In Malick's film, war is set in a
tropical paradise, and John Toll's cinematography is beyond lush.  The
setting poses the question, why are we fighting in the face of such beauty?
 In Saving Private Ryan, the capture of a German soldier presents the moral
quandary of whether to let him go.  In The Thin Red Line, the Japanese
present the moral quandary of war in the first place.  They are just like
the Americans -- frightened and angry, grieving and praying.  All that
separates them is war.</P>
<P>The flaw in The Thin Red Line comes in the voice-overs.  Unbelievable as
coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious, sometimes corny, the
voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely
unnecessary.  Dispensing with them, Malick could have achieved a
Tarkovskian grandeur.  Instead, he gets distracting self-consciousness.</P>
<P>Aside from that, Malick's direction is stunning.  The tracking shots across
windswept hills and  around transports speeding toward shore are
extraordinary.  Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, and Nick Nolte give the best
performances.  Penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism,
Koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain, and Nolte startling as a
colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle.
 John Travolta and George Clooney are the worst in cameo roles.</P>
<P>Ultimately however, The Thin Red Line's interest is not in the characters
and it is not in drama. It has been frequently criticized for its lack of
dramatic structure, but Malick clearly has different things on his mind. 
Has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is
exploitative?  What Malick is working with is theme, and in that, The Thin
Red Line is most provoking.</P>
