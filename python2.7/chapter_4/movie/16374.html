<P>Nazi-occupied Paris. Glamorous soprano Irene Brice (Leningrad-born,
ex-Russian actress Elena Safonova) hires an accompanist. She is 20-year old
Sophie (Romane Bohringer) a talented pianist who, like many French people
in the winter of 1942-43,  is undernourished.</P>
<P>Unlike many in German-dominated France, Irene and her
businessman-profiteer husband Charles (Richard Bohringer, in real life
Romane's father) live in luxury. Irene laughingly admits that she is
isolated from "rigors and privations." The Brices  hobnob with the rich and
the infamous and, marginally, with the German authorities. Marginally
because Charles, though an opportunist,  unlike many other Frenchmen is no
true collaborationist  but a complex man who does a balancing act between
his conscience and his self-interest. He even taunts the Germans.</P>
<P>Irene, a charmer, is blithely unaware of anything except music, adulation,
joie de vivre and her lover Jacques. Yet she's no air head.  Solemn Sophie
is fairly complex. She moves in with the couple, shares some of their
privileges , quietly observes their private and public lives. Her new
condition does not  change her much.  What does affect her is her
ambivalence toward Irene :  a mixture of admiration and  silent
disapproval, and an understandable , professional frustration at staying in
Irene's musical shadow. Even though she is appreciated by Irene and the
public, the young pianist always remains an anonymous second fiddle to the
singer. It does not help either that, in a friendly way, Irene also treats
Sophie a bit like a favorite servant. And neither woman opens up to the
other.</P>
<P>As Charles becomes increasingly conscious of reaching  a kind of point of
no return -- moral as well as practical--  he decides to escape from France
with his wife. Taking Sophie along, they go South, cross the Pyrenees,
reach Lisbon and take a freighter to England.   There, the entrepreneurial
Charles successfully becomes his wife's impresario -- but there is a
problem: Jacques, the lover and a member of the French Underground is also
in London...</P>
<P>The film starts out as a series of portraits and adds  vivid components of
life, society and dealings under the Occupation. It eventually becomes
something of a saga and a melodrama, but both are played down.  There is a
delicate, constant balance among the three main characters. Stresses vary
without  becoming  systematic. Although Charles may have less screen time
than the women, his role keeps growing in importance and depth. It is
Charles who touches you most,  yet the film does not resort to
simplifications, moral judgments, villains or heroes.</P>
<P>I said "three characters." I really meant four, the fourth one  being the
music. There is  for me  something  most appealing  in the way  so many
French films  since 1960 incorporate  classical music, use it organically,
and often make it the key element. Think of "Diva, " "The Music Teacher,"
"Tous les Matins du Monde." It is a far cry from Hollywood's stubborn
resistance to "serious" music, and, in quality and variety, also a far cry
from the made-to-order compositions in "The Piano," an excellent film but
with a jarringly anachronistic score.</P>
<P>Strongly and intelligently woven into the story, the mostly vocal music of
"The Accompanist" ( Mozart, Schumann, Richard Strauss, Schubert, Berlioz,
etc.) is not limited to snippets. Beautifully dubbed by  young soprano
Laurence Monteyrol, it is superbly lip-face-and-body-synched by Ms.
Safonova.</P>
<P>The film reproduces its period with great accuracy, captures perfectly in
look and content facts, situations, politics and moods of Occupied France
and of Marshall Petain's Vichy Government. Vichy itself, the provincial
spa that became the  bizarre seat of the pro-German French State  (
France's Non-Occupied Zone), comes in for some deft descriptions.</P>
<P>Among the best touches is a cameo by Claude Rich as a realistic,
disenchanted Vichy Minister who lends a sympathetic ear to Charles'
determination to escape.
References to Petain, Laval, Brinon, Otto Abetz, Doriot, the Free French,
De Gaulle and the like add much to the ambiance if you know this particular
chapter in history.</P>
<P>There are many subtleties, such as color differences  between the French
sequences and those of wartime London, the latter, says director Miller,
shot "with deep reds and blacks, like old Rank films. "  And there is at
least one  conceit,  included, no doubt, for the delectation of movie
specialists: Charles,  near the end, tells his wife: "I hate the character
that you are making me play." This is almost word for word what another
Charles, actor Charles Boyer, said to his wife in Max Ophuls' 1953 gem "The
Earrings of Madame de..."</P>
<P>I tip my hat to a movie that does not try to simplify people, issues and
facts, and works in music so effectively. Even if viewers do not identify
every historical detail, the film is not at all hard to follow. My only
puzzlement  is why Jacques always sports a heavy five o'clock shadow,</P>
<P>Claude Miller is, among other things, a director of faces who  has been
influenced by Ingmar Bergman. Here he makes eloquent use of close-ups of
faces and eyes. The late Francois Truffaut, who also did much along those
lines,  and with whom Miller worked on seven films,would have been pleased.</P>
