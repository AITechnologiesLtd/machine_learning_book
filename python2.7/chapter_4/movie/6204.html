                          Matilda (1996)
                   A film review by Ben Hoffman
                    Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>          In probably the funniest summer film this season, Mr
Wormwood and wife, (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman)  aided by  Matilda
(Mara Wilson) make a most hilariously enjoyable movie for both
children and adults alike.  By all means, this is not to be missed.</P>
<P>          Matilda is a very, very bright child whom the parents are
too stupid to notice.  At her very first birthday, with a nice
chocolate cake in front of her, she spells out her name on the
chocolate: M A T I L D A.   The idiot parents berate her for ruining
the cake, never noticing that the one-year-old is spelling.</P>
<P>          By the time she is 8-years-old she has devoured almost every
book in the library . . . and we do not mean those that have pictures.
Her father wants her to stop reading and watch TV.  "What can you
learn from a book that you can't learn better from TV?" he demands.
"And, by the way, what book are you reading now; she shows him it's
MOBY DICK."   In a frenzy he tears out the pages and berates her for
reading porno books.</P>
<P>               At school, she is sent to an institution that is more
like a jail, with the headmistress, Trunchbull, (Pam Ferris) , more of
a mean old witch than a school principal.   Fortunately, there is Miss
Honey, (Embeth Davidtz) Matilda's teacher, who helps and understands
the child's genius.</P>
<PRE>          Again, forget the summer trash and see a movie worth its
weight in gold.   See the darling MATILDA.</PRE>
<PRE>                      Directed by Danny DeVito.</PRE>
