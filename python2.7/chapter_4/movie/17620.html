<P>PLANET SICK-BOY:  <A HREF="http://www.sick-boy.com">http://www.sick-boy.com</A></P>
<P>In the opening scene of The Matrix, a foxy, leather-clad woman named
Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss, Models, Inc.) is surrounded by four beefy
cops intent on taking her down.  She doesn't go down.  Instead, she
beats the snot out of them so quickly and so effectively that you could
actually hear jaws hit the floor in the theater.  Who is she?  How does
she run up the sides of the walls?  How does she defy gravity?  How does
she seem to move four times as fast as the blockheads that are trying to
catch her?</P>
<P>While that amazing spectacle helps to draw you immediately into the
film, it's just the tip of the iceberg. Led by stunt coordinator and
four-time Hong Kong Film Award nominee Woo-Ping Yuen (Drunken Master),
The Matrix boasts some of the best martial arts ever seen in an
American-made picture.  It also features the finest slow-motion gunplay
not filmed by John Woo.</P>
<P>The story?  It's not bad, but it definitely takes a back seat to the
astounding visuals.  Keanu Reeves (Johnny Mnemonic) stars as Thomas
`Neo' Anderson, a corporate computer programmer by day and a
cyber-hacker by night.  His life changes forever when he decides to
follow the white rabbit to a gentleman named Morpheus (Laurence
Fishburne, Event Horizon), tries to get Neo to believe that the entire
world is just an elaborate computer program designed to pull the wool
over the collective eyes of mankind.</P>
<P>It's pretty tricky to follow, due, in part, to the distractingly
dazzling special effects (Matthew Ferro, Face/Off).  Writer/directors
Andy and Larry Wachowski (Bound) re-team with cinematographer Bill Pope
(Zero Effect) to create a nightmarish vision of a world where machines
are king and humans are cultivated as a natural resource.  And watch out
for Hugo Weaving (The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert), who
plays a creepy Robert Patrick-in-Terminator 2-style agent gunning for
Neo and his new pals.  (2:10 – R for violence, adult language and some
very disturbing futuristic scenes)</P>
