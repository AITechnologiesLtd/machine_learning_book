<P>     With its grand, colorful pageantry and cast of characters unable to 
provoke an emotional response from the audience, TEMPTATION OF A MONK is 
a curious mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Containing ample 
portions of sex and graphic violence, this picture serves up 
exploitation fare for an upscale, art-house audience.  </P>
<P>     The plot, which is occasionally difficult to follow (undoubtedly 
due to East/West cultural differences), tells a story from the early 
years of China's Tang dynasty (circa 626 AD).  General Shi (Wu Hsin-kuo) 
is a fiercely-loyal, greatly-feared battle commander whose prince, one 
of three sons vying for the Emperor's throne, is incompetent.  When an 
offer comes from rival general Huo Da (Zhang Fengyi, from FAREWELL MY 
CONCUBINE) for a bloodless coup if Shi will command his troops to offer 
no resistance, the stage is set for betrayal.  The takeover turns out to 
be bloody and Shi's troops (not to mention his prince) are slaughtered.  
Distraught, the general abandons his chance for glory in the new regime, 
turns his back on a princess who loves him (Joan Chen), and flees to an 
out-of-the-way monastery, where he shaves his head and accepts the 10 
Buddhist prohibitions.   </P>
<P>     There are three exceptionally energetic battle scenes in TEMPTATION 
OF A MONK, but the sequences linking them are by turns slow, confusing, 
and disjointed.  The chief problem seems to be that actor Wu Hsin-kuo 
plays the main character in such a detached fashion that it's difficult 
to see beneath the mask of self-pity.  There's nothing in Shi for the 
audience to connect with, and he comes across as exceptionally shallow.  
The same is true of the villain, Huo Da, and the love interest, Princess 
Scarlet.  The only character with a real personality is the 100-year old 
Abbot of the monastery where Shi seeks refuge.  Played with good cheer 
and a wry wit by Michael Lee, this man has words for the moment and 
wisdom for the centuries. </P>
<P>     Like many recent Chinese exports, TEMPTATION OF A MONK attempts to 
weave an individual story into a larger, historical backdrop.  However, 
unlike FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE and TO LIVE, Clara Law's feature doesn't 
get the personal story right.  The director does a good job with the 
epic portion, but when it comes to developing Shi's tale, things don't 
always work.  This is supposed to be an examination of how battle can 
convert a warrior into a seeker of peace and truth, but the violent 
climax nullifies much of what TEMPTATION is trying to say.  In the end, 
the film offers evidence that ambitious stories of this sort need a 
strong, identifiable protagonist -- something TEMPTATION OF A MONK too 
obviously lacks. </P>
