<P>*Note- This review contains some mildly vulgar language which could be
offensive to some, but the film calls for me to bring up these issues.</P>

<P>Based on the hit television show, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is an
unbelievably vulgar animated comedy starring none other than America's favorite
lovable little 3rd grade South Park festively plump resident, Eric Cartman. 
Cartman, Kyle Brofloski, Kenny McCormick, and Stan Marsh are all here in this
film which seems to be a regular South Park episode, only three times the
length.  Being a devoted fan of South Park, the stretched out episode is good
news to me, and even those unfamiliar with South Park should find themselves
laughing during this potty mouthed film.</P>
<P>In South Park, Colorado, the new film, "Asses of Fire" is playing, which stars
two Canadian comedians who chowed down to much sour kraut dinner, Terrence and
Phillip.  After hundreds of children are exposed to the "R" rated language in
the film, new words can be heard flowing from the mouths of kids everywhere. 
In protest, Kyle Broslofski's Mom forms an organization against Terrence and
Phillip, resulting in the death sentence of the two, and the United States
declaring war on Canada. Meanwhile in Hell, Satan and new boyfriend Saddam
Hussein are outraged about the death sentence of Terrence and Phillip, and plan
to launch the apocalypse.</P>
<P>The result of one of the strangest plots in a film for years is an outrageous,
mind-blowing film.  Bigger, Longer, Uncut, which is directed by Trey Parker,
and written by Parker and Matt Stone, doesn't hold back on language, but uses
unrepeatable phrases, making me question how this film got an "R" rating from
the MPAA.  The film received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA three times, but
this final version doesn't seem to be edited at all, but rather "uncut." 
Bigger, Longer, and Uncut has language to offend everyone, whether it be
African Americans or smart students, this film has it all.  Some may take the
humor (which I believe is innocent) harshly, but as an African American in the
theater laughed as the blacks in the army are used as "Operation Human Shield"
against Canada, some may take it lightly and laugh at the classic use of humor.</P>
<P>If Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is going to offend one group in particular, it is
those who are very religious.  Themes of Satan being friendly and gay are shown
constantly, there is a child who hates God, and says unbelievably crude things
about him, among other lines and sequences which will have religious folks
scattering the theater before the relatively short film is finished.</P>
<P>Adding to the humor are the songs in which characters break out into
frequently, which have more appeal to me than the songs in Disney's recent
release, Tarzan.  Although every song is particularly vulgar, the tunes are
catchy and upbeat, and surprisingly well done.</P>
<P>South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut couldn't come at a better time, as the
MPAA is cracking down on teens seeing "R" rated films, this film proudly waves
the middle finger at the association.  I agree with a character in the film
that says something along the lines of, "You can have loads of violence in a
film, but bad language isn't okay."  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is a "theme
movie" of sorts for those who dislike the MPAA as much as the film's writers
do, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.</P>
<P>Some may say "Anyone could make a film about four foul mouthed kids with
terrible animation," but I disagree with that.  For someone to take this simple
concept, create a national phenomenon, and make me laugh to the point where I
was choking on my popcorn, is sheer brilliance.  What is the brilliant force
behind South Park?  You may say I'm crazy, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone are
brilliant.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- A film that delivers the fans of South Park what they need--
an "Uncut" version of the hilarious T.V. show.</P>
