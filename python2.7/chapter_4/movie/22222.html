<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A B- film psychological thriller from the 1942 novel by Stefan Zweig
that runs out of thrills eventually and ends on a flat note; but, for a
while, it had its exhilarating moments of suspense. It tells the story
of an Austrian nobleman-intellectual, Werner von Basil (Jurgens), who is
held as a prisoner in his native Austria at the outset of WW11. The
nobleman has helped Bishop Ambros (Söhnker) store the church's treasured
art collection in a hidden place and refuses to tell the Nazi conquerors
where those valuable treasures can be found.</P>
<P>The story is told in flashback, as the freed but shaken nobleman is
taken by his Eminence and safely placed on board a boat heading for New
York. The flashbacks intercut between his present voyage and the ordeal
of his brainwashing at the hands of the Gestapo.</P>
<P>The flashbacks begin at a party, as he meets the treacherously beautiful
Austrian ballerina, Irene Andreny (Bloom), who is escorted by the new
Third Reich minister of culture to Austria, Hans Berger (Felmy). That
night he is arrested by the young Nazi, who pretends to be an
intellectual, and is determined to use his methods of brainwashing to
get the information he needs out of Werner without resorting to physical
torture. He locks him in a small, creaky, unbecoming room that is bare,
and allows no one to talk to him while he feeds him a daily diet of
stale bread. It is a test of wills, to see who will give in first. If
Berger fails, there is Hartmann (Lieven), his superior, who awaits with
the old-fashioned torture methods.</P>
<P>Somehow, Werner steals a book on how the master's play chess, and even
though he has never played the game before, he memorizes all the moves
in that book as a means of keeping sane. After seven weeks go by, he
still hasn't cracked; and Irene, fed up with her Nazi boyfriend breaks
up with him and tries to add moral support to Werner in his effort to
survive.</P>
<P>The scene on the boat brings back conflicting memories for Werner, as
there is a pompous master chess champion (Mirko Centrowic) who reminds
him of his former captors and is playing against a group of amateurs.
Werner can't help himself from entering the game, and it is the first
time in his life he has played chess, but he, of course, beats the
champion.</P>
<P>The acting by everyone but Jurgens was horrid. The story made no great
impression on me but it was curious to watch how someone can handle
isolation by concentrating on the intricacies of a game he doesn't
really understand. Overall, the film was just passable entertainment,
nothing more.</P>
