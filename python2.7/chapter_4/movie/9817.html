<PRE>THE RAINMAKER</PRE>
<P> By Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Paramount Pictures/Constellation Films
 Director:  Francis Ford Coppola
 Writer:  Francis Ford Coppola from novel by John Grisham
 Cast: Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Mary Kay
Place, Mickey Rourke, Danny DeVito, Danny Glover</P>
<P>   Question: "How do you know when a lawyer is lying?" 
Answer: "When you see his lips moving."  This gag, narrated
soon after the opening scene of Francis Ford Coppola's
adaptation of John Grisham's book, sums up the novelist's   
attitude toward the legal profession.  Grisham, who was easily
able to give up his day job as an attorney when he turned to
writing about the responsibility, is cynical almost to the point
of hopelessness.  What saves him from despair is his
conviction that somewhere out there you can find
professionals of integrity who do not lie each time they move
their lips and juries who are justifiably incensed enough to
mete out justice.  </P>
<P>   In the hands of director Coppola, "The Rainmaker," given
the appropriate time of two hours and fifteen minutes, must
still come up short on some of the story's subplots, most
expressly in the case of an elderly woman who pretends to
have a small fortune put away which, she insists, will go to
her children only if they treat her right in her declining years. 
But Coppola more than makes up for this omission by playing
up the humor in what is at base a tale of pathos involving a
twenty-two-year old man who is dying of leukemia, a kid who
could have been saved if his medical insurance policy
approved his family's claim.  "The Rainmaker" features a
stellar cast with Danny De Vito providing most of the yocks,
young and relatively unknown Matt Damon eliciting audience
cheers and good will, and Jon Voight as the big, bad,
corporate attorney absolutely full of himself as he brings his
enormous skills and experience to bear against a poor
Memphis woman whose son in slipping into death.</P>
<P>   To Coppola's credit this tale, which could have been
hammered home with all the hysteria of a mega-
melodrama, is played out low-key almost as though the trial
scenes were taking place as cinema verite.  The story is
peppered throughout with Michael Herr's narration of the
budding views of the twenty-four-year-old Rudy Baylor (Matt
Damon), who has just graduated from law school and is
looking for his first job.  Landing a position with a shady firm
of ambulance chasers bossed by "Bruiser" Stone (Mickey
Rourke), he learns quickly that he needs not chase
ambulances unless he has a penchant for eating.  Opening
scenes feature Danny DeVito in scenes that could have come
out of "Critical Care," as Deck Schifflet (DeVito) and his new
associate Rudy hustle about a local Memphis hospital looking
for accident cases to take on.</P>
<P>   While the principal action involves the lawsuit by Rudy
Baylor's sprouting legal office against an insurance company
which has a policy of refusing virtually all claims, there is an
ample diversity of smaller accounts to keep the audience
busy, the most melodramatic of which involves the young and
pretty Kelly Riker (Claire Danes) who is regularly beaten up
by her husband.  Baylor's relationship with the hapless and
mousy woman provides the right romantic touch and is
treated with subtlety and good taste.</P>
<P>   Jon Voight is particularly dependable as the big-shot lawyer
who tries every tactic to squelch the plaintiff's case of
wrongful death while Mickey Rourke, in a solid, over-the-top
performance, demonstrates the sleaze of an attorney whose
fumbling little law firm is just a front for mob activity.  Matt
Damon operates in a role that could have gone to Matthew
McCannaughey, Damon's youth and inexperience providing
the proper feel of a young urban professional who will have a
very tough time ever duplicating the success he enjoys in his
very first test.</P>
<P>   "The Rainmaker" is not noted particularly for saying
anything new or for subverting audience prejudices against
shyster lawyers and corporate evils, but what it says comes
across in a crisp professional style under Coppola's direction
and provides "The Rainmaker" with a solid story ably told.
Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 135 minutes.  (C) 1997 Harvey
