<PRE>A BRONX TALE (1993)</PRE>
<PRE>Review by Simon Doherty</PRE>
<P>This was the first film to be directed by legendary actor Robert De Niro 
and it is a promising debut.  Based on a stage play by Chazz Palminteri, 
it is very watchable, but a lack of depth prevents it being a great film.</P>
<P>The structure is similar to the first part of Goodfellas, following an 
Italian, Calogero Anello, and his growing association with the gangsters 
in his neighbourhood from age 9 to 17.
De Niro plays his father, a bus driver who shuns involvement with the 
criminals and wishes his son would do the same.  Palminteri is the local 
boss who takes Calogero under his wing.  These performances are the high 
points of the film; both are compelling and completely believable.  As a 
result the film tends to drag when neither are on screen, especially 
during Calogero's romance with a local black girl.  Francis Capra plays 
the teenager capably, but cannot carry the subtler emotional scenes on 
his own.</P>
<P>The influence of Martin Scorsese on De Niro's direction is apparent.  The 
(fairly limited) violence is handled in a similarly startling and 
unflinching way, and talk-overs are used extensively.  However, the 
narration is less effective here than in Goodfellas.  The lines are not 
delivered with the panache of Ray Liotta, and occasionally intrude on the 
story.  In one scene particularly, when bikers enter the local bar, a 
voice-over is used when the images would have been sufficient to tell the 
story.  This breaks the tension that had been developed and weakens the 
impact of what follows.</P>
<P>Overall, though, the film sustained my interest and created some 
memorable scenes and characters.  Hopefully De Niro will tackle some less 
familiar material; he has the potential to develop a style of his own.</P>
