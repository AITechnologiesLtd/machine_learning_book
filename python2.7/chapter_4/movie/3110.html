<P>     At a time when children are reading less, opting instead for such
fast, furious, and empty entertainment as video games and MTV, it falls
to a movie, THE PAGEMASTER, to make the case for books.  This clever,
often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture uses the visual
medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination.
They may not be as visibly transformed as Macaulay Culkin's Richard
Tyler, but through the magic of page-turning, they can enter different
worlds--or at least that's the message this release is trying to
convey.</P>
<P>     Richard Tyler is a child with so many phobias that they've run out
of names for them all.  His father (Ed Begley Jr.) despairs that his
son will ever shed his cloak of fear, especially when Richard's
response to an invitation to climb into a tree house is that he can't
because "seven percent of all accidents involve ladders."  So, instead
of joining Dad up in the branches, Richard is sent off to the store on
a quest for a box of nails.  Instead, he finds something he never
dreamed possible.</P>
<P>     Along the way, a sudden thunderstorm necessitates Richard to seek
shelter in the nearest building--a mysterious library run by the
prescient Mr. Dewey, aka The Pagemaster (Christopher Lloyd).  During
his stay amidst the thousands of books, Richard is transformed into a
cartoon character and forced to make his way through several lands of
fiction, guided by a trio of genres-come-to-life:  adventure (voice of
Patrick Stewart, lustily belting out his lines like a refugee from
Pirates of the Caribbean), fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg, all
sugar-and-starch), and horror (Frank Welker, doing his best "Igor"
imitation).</P>
<P>     Titles as diverse as ATLAS SHRUGGED, DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE,
TREASURE ISLAND, MOBY DICK, GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, ALICE IN WONDERLAND,
and JACK AND THE BEANSTALK are either alluded to or represented.  If
the sight of Culkin's animated image making his way through these
adventures isn't enough to pique the reading curiosity of the average
youngster, it's hard to imagine what will.</P>
<P>     Technically, the movie isn't an unqualified triumph.  While the
live action special effects are impressive, the animation appears
somewhat rushed.  It's certainly not the worst to have graced the big
screen in the past few years (that distinction probably goes to
FERNGULLY), but certain sequences, most notably those involving The
Pagemaster--who resembles Gandalf from the animated THE HOBBIT--look
unfinished.  On the other hand, the fire-breathing dragon is suitably
imposing and menacing.</P>
<P>     With its curious mix of TIME BANDITS-like enchantment and plain
sense of fun, THE PAGEMASTER represents the least-annoying and most
enjoyable contribution Culkin has made to the industry since HOME
ALONE.  This won't be the monster hit that movie was, but children
venturing into THE PAGEMASTER should be no less beguiled. Grownups who
often feel insulted by the too-juvenile tone of most so-called "family
features" will likely find this movie long enough to catch their
attention, but short enough not to lose it--in essence, a surprisingly
affable (and occasionally even sophisticated) movie-going experience.</P>
