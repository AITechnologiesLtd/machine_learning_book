<P>     Spike Lee adapts Richard Price to mixed effect.  The director's
over-the-top approach reminded me of Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN
KILLERS, which may or may not suit the genre of urban "gansta" drama.
Over-scored and under-lit, CLOCKERS is a surreal murder-mystery-as-
morality-play that takes about thirty minutes to settle into.  (Hip hop
over street slang doesn't help the acclimation process.)  The saving
grace is the story.  Price's portrait of a small-time crack dealer
(Meki Phifer) is *far* more potent than anything Lee can do with a
camera.</P>
<PRE>Oscar watch:  Keep an eye on Delroy Lindo.  His performance as a 
              neighborhood kingpin could be a contender. </PRE>

<PRE>JEFFREY
=======</PRE>
<P>     The fourth wall is almost nonexistent in this silly adaptation of
Paul Rudnick's off-Broadway smash.  A young gay man's celibate reaction
to the AIDS era is played as scattershot sketch comedy, where the walls
are torn down so quickly that the film never has a chance to recover.
This may have worked wonders on stage, but, here, you can't take a
minute of it seriously.  And that's a problem when the melodrama steps
in.  The cast is very appealing, though.  Standout Patrick Stewart
swishes with style as Jeffrey's best friend, Sterling.  Cameos abound,
including Nathan Lane as a horny priest.  No worries, *indeed*.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
<PRE>THE TIE THAT BINDS
==================</PRE>
<P>     The nicest thing you can say about THE TIES THAT BIND--
screenwriter Wesley Strick's unfortunate directoral debut-- is that all
of the scenes appear to be in the correct order.  If you saw *any* film
this summer, then you've seen the trailer, which gives away the entire
movie: a cute little girl is adopted by two yuppies (Moria Kelly and
Vincent Spano), who find themselves in peril with the return of the
girl's psychotic, white-trash parents (Keith Carradine and Daryl
Hannah, slumming).  Zero wit, style, tension, characterization, etc.
*must* be somebody's idea of a cruel joke.</P>
<P>[ Insert drum roll... ]  Makes CONGO look like CITIZEN KANE.</P>
<PRE>Grade: F</PRE>
