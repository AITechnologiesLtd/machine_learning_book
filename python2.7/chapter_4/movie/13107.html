<PRE>Cousin Bette 
(UK / USA 1998)
Seen on 20 June 1998 for $8.75 by myself at Village East Cinemas</PRE>
<P>*Cousin Bette*, to date, has been reviewed by only two other
rec.arts.movies.reviews critics. One, a Marxist, loved it, and the other,
a Balzac purist, hated it. Both are right. *Cousin Bette* is the
cinematization of one of Balzac's last novels. The Marxist notes the evils
portrayed by Balzac are accurate--the haute bourgeoisie elevated to
nobility by Napoleon want to live well no matter who gets hurt, no matter
how much they have to borrow from others to attain the rich lifestyles
they think are necessary to pass into high society. The purist duly notes
the gutting of the novel for the sake of the film. I will comment on this
later. </P>
<P>I am somewhere in the middle. As a film, *Cousin Bette* is quite
entertaining, in darkly humorous way. In the film, Bette, the "plain"
cousin, promises her dying cousin Adeline (Geraldine Chaplin) that she
will "take care of" Adeline's family. In the short deathbed conversation,
it all becomes clear--Bette was the slighted, plain cousin. Bette notes
she was sacrificed at Adeline's alter, leaving her a bitter spinster who
lives in a shoddy part of Paris, working as a seamstress backstage at a
musical burlesque theatre.</P>
<P>Adeline's family--the Hulots--comprise her philandering husband Hector
(Hugh Laurie), her ingenue daughter Hortense (Kelly MacDonald), sensible,
level-headed son Victorin (Toby Stevens), his wife and baby, and a lot of
superfluous servants.</P>
<P>Bette Fischer is played by Jessica Lange--a lovely woman made plain here
with dark makeup and drab olive and black clothing and dark braided hair.
Bette has been excluded from the life she wants--a home, a family, love.
She is 40, but in Paris 1846, she might as well be 80, considering her
bitterness. Bette's rage for the time is understandable--today she'd be
considered a stalker or a borderline schizophrenic. When Bette cannot have
what she considers rightfully hers, her rage is volcanic, as it is in the
novel.</P>
<P>Bette forms a friendship with actress/singer Jenny Cadine (Elisabeth
Shue); they are both originally peasant women from Lorraine-about as far
from Paris you can get, in some ways. Bette also befriends and saves the
life of her upstairs neighbor--Count Wenceslas Steinbach (Aden Young)--a
Polish noblemen and sculptor. She provides funding and scheduling for his
work, hoping gratitude will turn into love. It doesn't. In fact, her young
cousin Adeline deliberately "steals" the count from Bette, causing Bette
to manipulate situations that bring about the emotional, financial, and
physical downfall of her "beloved family."</P>
<P>For all the dark revenge-minded plotting, there is a lot of humor here.
Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the lecherous parfumerier Crevel, as is Laurie
as Hector. Both are in pursuit of the beautiful Jenny. Macdonald is
perfect as the spoiled Hortense, and Young is good as the much loved
rapscallion goldbrick Wenceslas.</P>
<P>While the best parts of the book are sacrificed at the alter of modern
motion picture viewing brevity, the soul and wit of Balzac survive. It is
a shame that Valerie Marneffe is never seen. In the book, she is Bette's
partner in crime, who convinces at least four men that they each are the
father of her unborn child (which did not even exist) while extorting
money from each of them. Adeline is a major figure in the book; killed
here for some cinematic expediency. But the full dissipate nature of the
nouveau riche is felt here. Living lavishly while plunging into
life-threatening debt is made abundantly clear. Marxists everywhere would
nod their heads while watching the beautiful trapping brough forth. </P>
<P>However, director Des McAnuff, who is primarily a theatre director, brings
some truly wonderful cinematic moments here. What would have taken many
chapters to explain in the novel, he does here with a well-timed glance
(like when Hortense asks Bette if she ever loved any one, and Bette tells
her while looking at Hector; Hector married Adeline instead of her, and
only we see this bitter glance). When Bette discovers Wenceslas is "two
timing" her, her rage is only quenched by plunging her head in a basin of
water. This is straight out of the novel and very well done. One of the
best scenes in the movie is Bette's arrival at the young couple's wedding;
she sees them through screens set up around the outdoor party. She is
partitioned to be an outsider, and only catches glimpses of the life she
so desires from the outside. Bette always plays her part and is never
discovered. Her cutting remarks are often only felt by us; she does what
is expected of a "spinster." Ending the film with the 1848 Revolution that
toppled the "Citizen King" Louis Philippe, while not in he book as I
recall it, helps drive the disaster home, and ties it into the more
lucrative *Les Miserables*.</P>
<P>*Cousin Bette* is lively and entertaining , and along with a fluid camera,
this atmosphere is abetted by a lively classical soundtrack and some
original songs as well. This version might not be as correct and full as
the 1972 six-hour miniseries, but it's a worthy version that truly
captures Balzac's wit and commentary. That figures from Balzac's wider
"Comedie Humaine" are mentioned--Nucingen, Marneffe, Birotteau--shows some
loving reverence to the author a fan like myself is happy to notice. It is
one of two Balzac adaptations out there now--Passion in the Desert being
the other. If 1998-99 is the Balzac revival year, I happily apply for
more.</P>
