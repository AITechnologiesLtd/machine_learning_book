<PRE>The Insider
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<PRE>**** (out of 4) </PRE>
<P>Not that I put much stock in the Academy Awards, but 3 people deserve
nominations for their work on THE INSIDER: Al Pacino and Russell Crowe
for their focused performances, and Michael Mann for his clockwork
direction.</P>
<P>THE INSIDER is an intense, involved drama about Jeffrey Wigand's
whistleblowing on Big Tobacco and Lowell Bergman's work producing a 60
MINUTES segment about him. Two and one-half hours fly by as the detailed
drama unfolds.</P>
<P>The movie opens on Bergman (Pacino) risking his life to set up a 60
MINUTES interview with the leader of the Hezbollah. Yet even while he's
producing one segment, he's looking ahead to the next one - a segment on
the fire hazards of smoking in bed.</P>
<P>Wigand (Crowe) is introduced to us as he leaves his job at Brown &
Williamson, one of the Big Seven tobacco companies. Mann's close-up,
hand-held camera (his cinematographer was Dante Spinotti) implies an
ominous, Big-Brother watchfulness as Wigand leaves the building, and
throughout the movie.</P>
<P>The two cross paths when Bergman calls Wigand, hoping to hire him as a
consultant on his fire-hazard story. Wigand strongly refuses Bergman -
so strongly that it piques his curiosity. Bergman smells a bigger story
under Wigand's nervousness.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Big Brother cinematography that implied Wigand's
paranoia, turns out to have been well-founded. Brown & Williamson calls
him back in to renegotiate the terms of his confidentiality agreement.
They seem to know that he has spoken to someone, and they want to
tighten the knots in his gag order.</P>
<P>Luckily for Bergman and 60 MINUTES, the more pressure Brown & Williamson
put on Wigand, the more eager he is to come forward with his story.</P>
<P>Part of the reason Mann is so successful is that every character has his
own motives. No character exists merely as a plot device. So although
Bergman and Wigand often collaborate, each has a different reason for
doing so, each with a different goal. Such human motivators as trust,
integrity and honesty all figure in to the characters and their actions.</P>
<P>Another reason is that the intensity of the story never falters.
Although the movie is over two hours loX-Mozilla-Status: 0009at should
have been trimmed. Every scene is important to the film, and no scene
goes on too long.</P>
<P>Finally, there are some technical reasons that Mann's movie succeeds.
The first is where Mann and Spinotti put the camera. For example, they
broke one of the fundamental rules of filmmaking, but for a good reason.
One should never "cross the eyeline" - that is to say, if Pacino and
Crowe are talking and Pacino is on the right side of the screen, he
should ALWAYS be on the right side, at least during that conversation.
But in two places, the eyeline is crossed repeatedly. The effect is
disorienting, which is both why you shouldn't do it, and why they DID do
it in THE INSIDER.</P>
<P>The second is in the editing. Mann and editor William Goldenberg would
sometimes edit for mood. For example, when Wigand crosses back into
Kentucky after possibly violating part of his confidentiality agreement,
he puts himself at risk of arrest. A burning car sits by the side of the
road. Plotwise, the car is a coincidence, but its inclusion shows
externally what Wigand's emotions must be doing internally. </P>
<P>And finally, the amount of polish the filmmakers used shows great craft
and respect for the audience. Carefully designed sound schemes and
well-framed widescreen shots are the outer signs of a movie that is very
good through and through.</P>
<P>To top it all off, Pacino and Crowe give outstanding performances in
serious, well-rounded, and substantial roles.</P>
<P>THE INSIDER is a success at every level. It's a gripping drama, not to
be missed.</P>
