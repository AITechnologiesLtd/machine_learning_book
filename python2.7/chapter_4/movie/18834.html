<P>The Happy Bastard's Quick Movie Review</P>
<PRE>ANALYZE THIS</PRE>
<P>How does one do a comedy focused on the mob?  Well, a few years ago,
there was a sly little comedy called The Freshman, which had Marlon
Brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous Don Corleone character
and, recently, the utterly stupid (in a bad way) movie Mafia! failed to
really get the joke.  This time around, however, Warner Bros. may have
gotten it right with Analyze This, a movie that hits its targets more
than it misses...and for plenty of reasons.</P>
<P>The story goes like this.  A mobster (Robert DeNiro) finds himself
receiving several panic attacks as of late, fueled by the stress of an
upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting.
It's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist (Billy
Crystal) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two
reasons.  First, of course, he's a mobster, but secondly, he's trying to
get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife (Lisa Kudrow) and
kid.  And, of course, he can't rest worth for a moment because the
mobster's goons are always needing the shrink for something, be it a
quick consultation or dream analyzation.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the movie is played out for plenty of laughs.  Director
Harold Ramis (who also helmed the comedy Multiplicity, which wasn't half
bad) keeps the tone peppy and light, even if it's sometimes sprinkled by
slight dramatic moments (shootings can't always be taken for laughs, you
know).  DeNiro does some of his finest comic work since The King of
Comedy, giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in
Goodfellas, but with a bit of a lighter heart.  (A scene where he tries
to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious.)
Crystal plays an excellent straight man to DeNiro's character, uplifting
him from such bombs as Father's Day and My Giant.  Kudrow is also a hoot
as Crystal's wife-to-be, who's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to
DeNiro's presence.</P>
<P>Is the movie perfect?  Not really, thanks to a simplistic ending and
some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by Chazz
Palminteri (he's a comic actor, too, come on, give him some more!), but
it is an enjoyable romp that lets DeNiro do something different but same
for a change, taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy.  Kudos
to Crystal and Kudrow for not just making it his show, either.</P>
<P>Line of the movie: Crystal: "When you said you needed family therapy,
this is NOT the family I had in mind!"</P>
<PRE>RATING: 8 out of 10</PRE>
