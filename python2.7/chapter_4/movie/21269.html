<P>Kissing a Fool is the latest romantic comedy served up to the mindless
legion of brain-dead imbeciles that we call the American viewers.  It
does nothing new, but since they have embraced similar filth (read: My
Best Friend's Wedding), it will probably be well received.</P>
<P>The only interesting thing about Kissing is the unique casting.  David
Schwimmer (Friends) plays Max Abbott, an over-confident, ultra-macho
Chicago sportscaster who nails everything that moves and utters the line
`What Up, Chicago?' ad nauseum in both his professional and personal
lives.  Schwimmer is usually typecast as the super-shy downtrodden loser
type, but in Kissing, that role is filled by Jason Lee (Chasing Amy),
who plays the sensitive Air Supply/Barry Manilow loving writer, Jay.
Lee is known best for his offensive obscenity-screaming characters
written by Kevin Smith.  So, what I guess what I'm trying to say is that
the parts were kinda swapped.</P>
<P>Linda (Bonnie Hunt, Jumanji) tells the film in narrative flashback at a
wedding.  She is a wealthy publisher who claims to have been responsible
for introducing the happy newlyweds.  We don't know who has just been
married, but Linda doesn't care.  She starts her story at the
beginning…Max and Jay have been friends since grammar school...</P>
<P>Long story short, Jay sets Max up with Sam (Avital, Polish Wedding), his
beautiful new editor.  They fall in love and quickly start planning a
wedding.  The boorish Max suddenly develops the strange notion that Sam
may not be `the one' and tries to get his pal to sleep with him as some
sort of bizarre testosterone love-test.  Jay, of course, wants nothing
to do with Max's sinister plan, but ends up falling for Sam regardless.</P>
<P>Other than the casting, the only other bright spot in all of the
banality is Israeli newcomer Avital.  Of course, that could just be
because she isn't Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston or Cameron Diaz.  Lee
seems more out of place in his role than Schwimmer does, but I have a
feeling that Schwimmer is probably like Max in real life.  Lee also has
very disturbing hair.  That could be because he had to have hair similar
to Max so that when the bride and groom kiss at the beginning of the
film, we wouldn't know who the groom was.  I would have cut that scene
and given Jay better hair.  Maybe that would have helped his
self-confidence, which would have led to him come to terms with his
feelings for Sam sooner, which would have led to me getting home
earlier.</P>
