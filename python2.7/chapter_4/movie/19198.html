<P>starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek
screenplay by Brent Maddock, S.S. Wilson, Peter S. Seaman, and Jeffrey
Price
directed by Barry Sonnenfeld</P>
<P>If you don't think Kevin Kline in drag is funny, wait ‘til you see
Will Smith in drag-it's even less funny. By the time Jim West (Smith)
disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade,
Artemus Gordon (Kline), from the clutches of evil Dr. Loveless
(Branagh), I was unequivocally bored by Wild Wild West, the new summer
blockbuster from Men in Black director Barry Sonnenfeld.</P>
<P>Is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy, anyway? (If
your answer is no, then you recall Rustler's Rhapsody or Back to the
Future Part III; if your answer is yes, you're thinking of Blazing
Saddles, but that movie was a parody of the western genre, not a
nineteenth century romp.)</P>
<P>1869. Jim West is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac
federal agent Gordon, under orders from President Grant (Kline again,
whose impression, for all we know, is dead-on), to apprehend legless
Loveless, the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the United
States and sell it back to Britain and Spain. How will Loveless
accomplish this? Well, by hulking around the desert in an enormous,
mechanical tarantula, of course.</P>
<P>Bosomy dance hall girl Rita Escobar (Hayek), whose scientist father
was kidnapped by Loveless, joins West and Gordon on their
gadget-filled train. (Gordon first discovers Rita in a cage, waiting
to be rescued.) Racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers
from pairing dull Rita romantically with West, despite the movie's
"hip" attitude toward the black thing. (West automatically shoots
anyone who calls him a "nigger" before that person can finish speaking
the word. Super.) At any rate, I kept waiting for Rita to say
something humourous, but she's a walking dress-up toy. (Her single
comic moment is also the best shot of the film: she bashfully reveals
bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas.)</P>
<P>Jim West is the role that finally stymied Will Smith, whose comic
timing has always been hit or miss, as episodes of "The Fresh Prince
of Bel-Air" demonstrate. Smith's a better reactor than actor, which is
why he was so thoroughly engaging in Men in Black-he didn't start out
a hero. In Wild Wild West he's required to exude Eastwood cool and
amuse at the same time (and from frame one), a difficult feat I'm not
sure any living performer could pull off. Smith is ill equipped, for
example, to handle the moment in which Jim West performs stand-up for
some rednecks at his own hanging. </P>
<P>What attracted Sonnenfeld to this material? This isn't the first time
he has adapted a TV show for the big screen (The Addams Family,
anyone?), but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director.
Wild Wild West is poorly-paced bombast, full of DOA gags (Ted Levine
shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid;
Levine played Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs-he's too
intense to get an intentional laugh), lousy special effects (the
bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the
backgrounds), and frequent illogic. (To wit, its ridiculous villain so
badly wants Jim West out of the way that he...drops him onto a steel
platform to do battle with some generic, ugly henchmen, instead of
shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board
the tarantula.)</P>
<P>Wild Wild West's bright spots, such as the cool opening credits
sequence, Bai Ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale, or
the brilliant "His Master's Voice" joke, are all part of the film's
first half, which is more clever and enjoyable, at least, than its
second. When, towards what seemed like the end of Wild Wild West,
Gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and West rejects it,
there was a collective groan among audience members: it meant we were
going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before
Gordon builds the glider, the invention of which would inevitably lead
to the proverbial whiz-bang finale.</P>
