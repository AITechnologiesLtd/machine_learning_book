<PRE>                               CARRIED AWAY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     CARRIED AWAY is an incredible film being opened slowly around the
United States by its distributor Fine Line Features.  Locally it is
playing at the Towne Theater in San Jose.  The film has two amazing
performances by Dennis Hopper and Amy Irving that are both worthy of
Oscar consideration, and the rest of the cast gives great performances
as well.  Most of all it is a devastating film although ultimately a
hopeful one.</P>
<P>     As the story opens, an exhausted middle aged farmer named Joseph
Svenden (Dennis Hopper) is having a nightmare about the time he
permanently damaged his leg in a farming accident when he was a
youngster.  He is woken out of the dream by his elderly mother.  She
chides him, "Get up.  It's 5 o'clock already."  Despondent and using
his old cane, he limps in the darkness through the cold and bleak wind
to the barn.</P>
<P>     Joseph makes most of his meager income as an uncredentialed
teacher in a two room school house.  His fellow teacher and long term
lover is Rosalee Henson (Amy Irving).  The school is in the middle of
nowhere, and the school board has declared that this is its last year.
It will be consolidated with a more modern school that is thirty miles
away.  The only part of his life that he is good at will then vanish.</P>
<P>     Rosalee has always wanted to marry Joseph, but perpetually
melancholic Joseph is not ready to get married now or maybe ever.  His
mother is dying, and he is not happy with what he views as his
miserable existence.  Thanks to drab and ugly costumes (Grania Preston)
and makeup, both of these forty-seven year olds look to be going on
sixty.</P>
<P>     Joseph has given up on life, but still he longs for meaning.  His
relationship with Rosalee is going nowhere.  As he describes it, they
make love in the dark on Friday and Sunday nights.  His whole life is
monotonous, and he despises it.</P>
<P>     One day, a vivacious new seventeen year old blonde student,
Catherine Wheeler (Amy Locane - the rich girlfriend from SCHOOL TIES),
comes into his classroom and his life is changed forever.  Ah, now you
think, this is the LOLITA story for our generation.  Well, maybe it is,
but I don't think so.  The script by Ed Jones is based on the novel
"Farmer" by Jim Harrison who wrote "The Legends of the Fall," and I
found this script more intriguing and believable than LOLITA (1962).
Actually, this film is not near as much about the forbidden love of a
teacher and a student, as it is the study of two middle-aged people who
feel like their life has passed them by.</P>
<P>     Catherine and her dad, an athletic and imposing looking retired
Major (Gary Busey), ask Joseph if she can board her horse in his barn
and come everyday to ride it.  He says yes with both anticipation and
anxiety.  One day she comes to ride her horse, but when he sees her in
the barn, she starts stripping to see if she can seduce her teacher.
He has the good sense to run away from such a minefield of trouble, but
lacks the convictions to stay away for more than a few minutes.</P>
<P>     Soon the forbidden affair is in full bloom.  From there the story
is a mixture of the predicable and the complete surprises.  When the
Major declares on a hunting trip with Joseph that "I'm too old to just
kill for the sake of killing" and that he only shoots what needs to be
shot, Joseph is suitably frightened, but then again, not enough to
alter his amoral behavior.  The casting of Busey as the Major is
perfect.</P>
<P>     Director Bruno Barreto asserts remarkable control with his
charges.  Who else could take explosive and uncontrollable actor Dennis
Hopper (WATERWORLD, PARIS TROUT, and almost a hundred other films) and
get a touching, quiet, and poignant performance out of him.  Watch
especially how sadly he fiddles with his old pipe reminding the
audience how hopeless Joseph feels in his situation and how trapped in
his environment.  His acting is reminiscent of Anthony Hopkins in one
of his pensive English roles.</P>
<P>     Similarly, the director takes Amy Irving, who hasn't had a good
part since MICKI + MAUDE and YENTL, and gets a performance of great
beauty of a woman even more trapped in her shell than her lover.  Their
love making and their false starts range from the sad to the sweet and
to the powerful.  None are erotic, but all are tastefully done, and at
least one, is quite surprising.</P>
<P>     Amy Locane plays a supporting role, but she is excellent and
certainly much more effective than Sue Lyon was in LOLITA (1962).
Catherine plays Joseph like a fish on the end of a line.  Whenever he
even thinks about breaking off, she starts a provocative undressing
routine, and he postpones any notion of leaving her.  She owns him like
the devil owned Faust.</P>
<P>     There are a few other characters in this fairly sparse drama.  My
favorite of those not already mentioned is Hal Holbrook who plays Dr.
Evans, who is Joseph's friend and his mother's doctor.  There are also
many charming scenes of Joseph taking care of his mother (Julie
Harris).  Sometimes they play an old piano together, and other times he
rubs lotion on her decaying body.  He loves her intensely.  One time he
confesses to her, "What can I say.  I'm a bad man.  But sometimes it is
fun to be bad."</P>
<P>     The movie is extremely sad, but never lugubrious or manipulative.
Many of the lines are gems.  When Rosalee cries that "I'm not going to
get another chance," she sums up in a single sentence all of what it
means to be a late middle-aged person.  As Joseph puts it, "I don't
have any excuse.  I guess I wanted to be carried away."  Rosalee
feeling just as trapped and lost as Joseph, declares, "I want to be
carried away too."</P>
<P>     Cinematographer Declan Quinn (VANYA ON 42ND STREET) picks the most
gray and depressing colors he has in his bag to construct the images.
He uses the lighting to cast darkness on his characters reflective of
their feelings about themselves and their lack of opportunities in
life.  Usually cinematographers use their skills to enliven a picture,
but here Quinn is quite effective in make an already morose tale, even
more so.</P>
<P>     The sets by Peter Paul Raubertas are bleak and foreboding.  Bruce
Broughton's music is full of soulful violins, flutes, and muted
trumpets to cast a dreamy and nostalgic feel over the sets.  The music
is subdued, but it is perhaps the most hopeful part of the production
suggesting the hope of redemption.</P>
<P>     CARRIED AWAY runs a well edited (Bruce Cannon) 1:44.  It is rated
R for sex, full frontal male and female nudity, and some bad language.
There is no violence.  Given the nature of the relationships, I do not
recommend this show for teenagers.  For adults, I give it a strong
recommendation and award the film *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
