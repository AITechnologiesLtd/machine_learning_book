<PRE>MALLRATS
*** of **** grade is B-</PRE>
<P>Clerks was a big hit with the critics and film festivals and Smith was
entered into cult status.  Then Mallrats was released, the second of his
Jersey trilogy, and the critics smashed it with a sledge hammer.  It
managed to generate bad reviews from just about everybody, Smith later
even apologized for it at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards.  I found
it a larger, yet less succsessful film than Clerks, but funny in its own
way.  </P>
<P>Quentin Tarantino said that he didn't want people to compair Jackie
Brown to Pulp Fiction, it may have helped if Smith had done the same
with Mallrats.  This film has some very funny moments, a fresh cast and
a minimalist setting.  Most of the film takes place in a shopping mall,
where Mallrats T.S. (Jeremy London) and Brodie (Jason Lee) hang out,
and  concieve of ways to get their girlfriends back, with the help of
Jay and Silent Bob, whom have a bigger role here than Clerks.  There are
moments of sparks along the way but the refuses to catch fire, even in
the hilarious climax on an old fasion Dating Game show, where they screw
up T.S. former girlfriend's father and she falls back for him.</P>
<P>This is no doubt the lowpoint of the Jersey Trilogy BUT not a bit as bad
as all the critics said.  Most of the humor here is visual and grossout,
and there are mixed efficent and absurdly dumb scenes of characters set
up for just a single joke.  Overall a mixed feeling from me, and overall
a very slight recomendation if you liked Clerks or Chasing Amy.</P>
