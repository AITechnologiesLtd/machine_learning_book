<PRE>                           NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Jon A. Webb
                        Copyright 1994 Jon A. Webb</PRE>
<P>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS is being billed as the most violent thing
you've ever seen, the most shocking of the Oliver Stone films, etc.,
but I didn't find it so.  Perhaps I'm just becoming jaded, but I found
Stone's editing technique, in which no shot is more than about two
seconds long, to be distancing.  I walked out of PLATOON in the village
scene; it seemed to me that Stone was showing violence just for its
sensational effect.  Here, perhaps, he is trying to do the same thing
but he has over-edited the film, with the result that one sees it as a
movie rather than the commentary on our culture that it evidently tries
to be.</P>
<P>     Stone's films take a controversial stand, which helps marketing.
Thus, JFK asserted a particularly unlikely version of the Kennedy
assassination myth, and Stone extended it in a kind of performance art,
going on talk shows to claim he really believed it.  BORN ON THE
FOURTH OF JULY turned a bitter Vietnam vet's tragic story into a
condemnation of the Veteran's administration, US policy in Vietnam,
etc.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS claims that we have been so desensitized by
television that we would accept truly evil people as national heroes.</P>
<P>     Woody Harrelson is quite good as the murdering duo.  I liked
Harrelson particularly, as he drawls and slouches his way through the
part.  He seems deeply relaxed and comfortable with his character.</P>
<P>     Against this, Juliette Lewis seems weak, except in a few scenes
where her anger explodes; she's great in the fight scenes, and while
dancing.  But I did not think she carried the weight of her role very
well; I still can't decide if she was meant to be a moral zero into
which Harrelson's character poured his evil, or the catalyst for his
transformation.</P>
<P>     The scenes with Rodney Dangerfield are probably the best of the
film, and make its point most clearly.  In fact, I think Dangerfield
would have destroyed his career with this part, if he had done it
earlier.  (Dangerfield's character is just too close to his comic
personality for comfort.) It is a parody of a TV show, with laugh
track, etc., but Dangerfield plays a sickeningly evil father, abusing
Lewis's character and the rest of his family.</P>
<P>     There's a little too much (any is too much) of the Oliver Stone
trademark American Indian mysticism here, as there was in THE DOORS.</P>
<P>     Robert Downey, Jr. is great as tabloid TV reporter with the voice
of Robin Leach (I wonder if they made a deal with Leach, or is he
suing?) who makes the murderers into stars.</P>
<P>     This film forms a natural end (hopefully) to Stone's indictment of
American culture.  It is an attack on television style
sensationalization of murderers, etc., which in itself extends that
sensationalization.  I don't think Stone could go much farther with
this point; like overbeaten egg whites this film falls flat.  He'll
have to think of something original to do next.</P>
