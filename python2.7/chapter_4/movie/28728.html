<PRE>A KNIGHT'S TALE
---------------</PRE>
<P>A young thatcher's son William aspires to the impossible dream of becoming a
knight, a title reserved for the noble born.  When the adult William (Heath
Ledger, "The Patriot") is faced with his liege Knight's death before the
final round of a joust, he seizes an opportunity, shielded from questioning
eyes by his benefactor's armor in writer/director Brian Helgeland's "A
Knight's Tale."</P>
<P>Who would have predicted the writer of "L.A. Confidential" and director
of Mel Gibson's "Payback" would make his hyphenate debut with such a risky
premise?  "A Knight's Tale" is a bold melding of a modern rock score and
culture with the medieval jousting tournament circuit of the 14th century.
We're thrown into the excitment as Queen's "We Will Rock You" blares,
peasants in the stands do a wave and a young wench boogies to the music.</P>
<P>William wins the third round merely by staying on his horse (his knight
was ahead in the first two rounds) and amusingly stays undercover by dint
of the dent delivered to his helmet by his opponent's lance.  William and his
starving cohorts Roland (Mark Addy, "The Full Monty") and Wat (Alan Tudyk, 
"28 Days") quickly convert the prize into fifteen silver florins.  After 
heated debate, William convinces them to invest the money into turning
him into a tournament competitor rather than immediately gratifying their
stomaches.</P>
<P>One amusing Rocky-like training montage later, the trio make their way
towards the next meet, picking up a very nude Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany,
"Bent") along the roadside when he offers to fake William's nobility papers 
and perform as his herald.  Once there, William espies his lady fair, Jocelyn 
(newcomer Shannyn Sossamon) and crosses the man who will be his arch rival in 
both love and war, Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewall, "Dark City").  A need for 
armor repair on account over currency adds female blacksmith Kate (Laura 
Fraser, "Titus") to William's entourage.</P>
<P>If "The Patriot" didn't catapult Heath Ledger into full fledged stardom,
"A Knight's Tale" surely will.  Ledger exudes down to earth charm 
as well as being up to the physical demands of medieval tournament
competition.  He can also cut a mean rug.  Ledger's more than ably supported.
Paul Bettany is comicly inspired as the scene-stealing, gambling addicted
future author of 'The Canterbury Tales.'   His hammy, hilarious deliveries of
'Sir Ulrich's' qualifications are one of the film's highlights and his
character's weakness provides an opportunity for William to show what he's made
of. Alan Tudyk also provides laughs as the fiery redhead whose approach to
almost any situation is like a pitbull's.  Addy is the more level-headed
voice of reason.  Laura Fraser quietly makes a strong stand for women's lib.
Sewell is a haughty, egotistical cheat, and therefore, a good villain.  
Newcomer Sossamon has an exotic beauty, but adds little else to the mix.</P>
<P>Helgeland's script has the right mix of humor, action, adventure and
sentiment, although a couple of jarring character changes (William accuses his
beloved of being a silly girl out of the blue, only to have to win her back; a
romance that seems to be percolating between the widowed Kate and Roland is
abandoned) may be attributable to editting for run time.  He blends pop culture
in with ancient history cleverly, usually managing to get a laugh.
Kate designs new, more lightweight armor and etches in her 'brand,' which
resembles a Nike logo.  A courtly medieval dance evolves into present day
moves to David Bowie's "Golden Years."</P>
<P>Cinematographer Richard Greatrex ("Shakespeare in Love") along with the film's
editor and sound designer make you feel every connection of the knights'
lances with their targets.  Costume design by Caroline Harris ("An Ideal
Husband") mostly works, although Jocelyn's outfits are sometimes too outlandish
(one costume featuring a straw bonnet would look more at home at "My Fair
Lady's" horse race).</P>
<P>"A Knight's Tale" is rousing fun - it rocks.</P>
