<PRE>                              SLEEPING WITH ENEMY
                                  [SPOILERS]
                       A film review by Gerald Hawkins
                        Copyright 1991 Gerald Hawkins</PRE>
<P>     Let's face it--I saw this film just to see Julia Roberts.  With
that out of the way, the film can be criticized.  SLEEPING WITH THE
ENEMY can only be called "derivative."  I can't think of any other word
that so accurately describes it.  After the first twenty minutes--which
I found tense and intense--the film became highly predictable.  There
were some moments of nice camera use--not enough to help.  The dialog
was very spotty, ranging down to the absurd in a couple of scenes.  In
one scene, Roberts sits down to a meal and has a conversation with "the
enemy" that almost makes the film laughable.</P>
<P>     There are some Hitchcock-like elements in the film, but it covers
only one bit of territory Alfred didn't (domestic violence); actually at
times it seems as though the production is ripping off Brian DePalma,
who ripped off Hitchcock.  I found myself thinking back to STRANGERS ON
A TRAIN at one point, VERTIGO at another, and in each thinking how I
would've rather seen those fine films again than this one the first
time.  (Actually, I knew once I heard Robert's name in the
film--Laura--what was in store).</P>
<PRE>     The only things I can say I really learned from the film are:
          1.  Don't keep the towels in your bathroom straight,
          2.  Julia Roberts has more teeth than anyone I've ever seen.</PRE>
<P>     My rating would be an even 0 on the +4 to -4 scale.  Immediately
after watching it, my rating would have been a generous 1, but with
reflection this movie can't even carry that rating.</P>
