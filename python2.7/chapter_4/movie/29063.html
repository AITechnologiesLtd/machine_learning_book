<PRE>L.I.E.
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Best remembered for his understated performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter
in Michael Mann's forensics thriller, Manhunter, Scottish character
actor Brian Cox brings something special to every movie he works on. 
Usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock (he dies halfway
through The Long Kiss Goodnight), he's only occasionally given something
meaty and substantial to do.  If you want to see some brilliant acting,
check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite Frances
McDormand in Ken Loach's Hidden Agenda.</P>
<P>Cox plays the role of Big John Harrigan in the disturbing new indie
flick L.I.E., which Lot 47 picked up at Sundance when other distributors
were scared to budge.  Big John feels the love that dares not speak its
name, but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing
them back to his pad.  What bothered some audience members was the
presentation of Big John in an oddly empathetic light.  He's an
even-tempered, funny, robust old man who actually listens to the kids'
problems (as opposed to their parents and friends, both caught up in the
high-wire act of their own confused lives.)  He'll have sex-for-pay with
them only after an elaborate courtship, charming them with temptations
from the grown-up world.</P>
<P>L.I.E. stands for Long Island Expressway, which slices through the strip
malls and middle-class homes of suburbia.  Filmmaker Michael Cuesta uses
it as a (pretty transparent) metaphor of dangerous escape for his
15-year old protagonist, Howie (Paul Franklin Dano).  In his opening
voice-over, Howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road,
citing the L.I.E. highway deaths of filmmaker Alan J. Pakula, songwriter
Harry Chapin, and his own mother on Exit 52.  He's both fascinated and
disturbed by the L.I.E., and those feelings are projected onto Big John
(who follows Howie around in his bright red car, but never makes a move
to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do.  This makes him
much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's
a beast, but ashamed of it.)</P>
<P>L.I.E. would have worked best as a half-hour short film about Howie's
ill-advised foray into Big John's haven.  There is unnecessary padding
with Howie's miserable dad (Bruce Altman) in the hot seat for a
white-collar crime, degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from
robbing middle-class houses, and some homoerotic shenanigans with
wise-ass Gary Terrio (Billy Kay), a handsome Artful Dodger.  Rather than
add to the themes of suburban ennui (not that we needed another movie on
that subject), these awkward subplots pad out the running time to
adequate feature length.</P>
<P>Concurrently, the relationship between Howie and Big John is evenly
paced and exceptionally well acted.  Cox, sporting a baseball cap and a
faded marine tattoo, is all bluff and bluster.  Dano is quiet and at
first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent.  We're so used to
child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious (calling Haley
Joel!), it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any
given scene.  The restraint is admirable.</P>
<P>But L.I.E.'s screenplay doesn't always give them the best material. 
When Howie reads Big John a Walt Whitman poem, the moment feels a bit
too precious.  Director Michael Cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction
shot of Big John, who may as well be hearing Glenn Gould performing
Bach's Goldberg Variations.  It's too much.  There are also some obvious
dramatic contrivances involving Big John's other boy toy (Walter
Masterson), jealous over the newbie.  This plot thread predictably leads
to violence.</P>
<P>Not content to be a haunting, observational portrait of teen alienation
in a royally screwed up world (like Terry Zwigoff's superb Ghost World),
Cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent
note.  It's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a
bullet, sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a
complex, philosophical note.  In this regard, L.I.E. (and countless
other indie films) share something in common with blockbuster action
films: problems are solved when the obstacle is removed.  How often does
real life work this way?  To extend the question: If a movie is striving
for realism, do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion?</P>
