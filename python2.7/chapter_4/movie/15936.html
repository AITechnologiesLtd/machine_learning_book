 If you cringe at the notion of an animated musical version of the story of
Moses, you might be tempted to steer clear of "The Prince of Egypt."
 Don't.
 Unless, of course, you don't mind missing out on one of the year's most
distinctive, lovingly made movies, a picture that turns a familiar story
into something suprisingly exciting, moving and -- yes -- even funny. In a
word, "Prince" rules.
 Put aside pre-conceived notions about what Biblical dramas should look like
onscreen; though elephantine spectacles like "The Ten Commandments" may have
dazzled audiences 40 years ago, the legions of animators behind "Prince"
have conjured up richly imaginative visions of the Burning Bush, the exodus
of the Hebrews and, most astonishingly, the parting of the Red Sea that must
have Cecil B. DeMille seething with envy in his grave.
 Though the push in animation in recent years has been toward achieving
either stunningly life-like movement (as in Disney's "Lion King" and
"Pocahontas") or using computers to dream up almost three-dimensional
fantasy worlds ("Toy Story," "Antz"), the people behind "Prince" have
intentionally opted for more expressionistic figures and for opulence and
texture over precise detail, and have succeeded; you can almost feel the
rippling blue waters of the Nile and the gritty walls of the Pyramids. Even
the less-than-religious in the audience will find plenty to appreciate, both
in the visuals and in the sprinklings of humor throughout the film -- the
joke about the Sphinx's missing nose is genuinely smart.
 Viewers may be so swept away by the elegance of the production they won't
automatically recognize the phenomenal array of talent providing the voices
for the characters. If it's possible to earn an Oscar nomination for an
offscreen performance, Ralph Fiennes certainly deserves one for his
magnificent reading of the proud but troubled Rameses, one of the most
striking figures ever to appear in an animated film.
 But the rest of the cast do not fade into Fiennes' shadow. Val Kilmer's
Moses sounds properly impassioned, Michelle Pfeiffer lends her edgy warmth
to Moses' spirited wife Tzipporah, and even Sandra Bullock hits the right
defiant notes as Moses' older sister Miriam.
 The only performers who seem out of place are Steve Martin and Martin Short
as daffy high priests, and that's due less to the actors than to the script,
which can't find a way to work them into the story's flow. Their musical
number "Playin' With the Big Boys" is a show-stopper in the wrong sense of
the term.
 The other songs do an admirable job of advancing the plot, especially the
rousing "Through Heaven's Eyes," which condenses Moses and Tzipporah's
meeting, courtship and wedding into four lively minutes, and "When You
Believe," which sets in motion the movie's stunningly beautiful finale.
Animation fans have been blessed with a bumper crop of outstanding works to
choose from this year -- "Mulan," "Antz," "A Bug's Life" -- but this regal,
sensational "Prince" is in a class by itself.
