<P>   Given the relative absence of real laughs and total absence of
wit in this "Rush Hour" sequel, the all-important factor is the
chemistry between the two principals.  Fortunately, it's there in
abundance, several times more so than the rapport between
Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie in "Original Sin"--which is
not saying a whole lot.  Jackie Chan, of course, plays the guy with
most of the physical action: he turns in some mind boggling
stunts best of which involves not his pummeling the criminals but
his slithering under the barred window that protects the earnings
of a Las Vegas night club and his dangling on a bamboo pole
about 15 stories from the ground.  Chris Tucker, still the
motormouth, still the guy whose role is considered "obnoxious but
not so much as in the original" as so many critics have stated,
provides the racial banter, the wide-eyed surprises, the ineffective
womanizing.</P>
<P>   "Rush Hour 2" cooks up no real plot, which is OK since nobody
goes to this sort of movie expecting the slightest taste of
originality.  But Matthew F. Leonetti's lensing under the direction
of Brett Ratner gives us armchair travelers a solid view of Hong
Kong, particularly its gorgeous harbor showing the regular ferry
connecting the two islands with the shots of the boldly lit
advertisements the greatest paean to capitalism east of Las
Vegas.</P>
<P>   When Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and L.A.P.D.
Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) turn up in Hong Kong,
they're expecting a nice vacation filled with Tsingtao, women and
song, Carter carrying a Cantonese-American dictionary that gets
him into trouble every time--as when he hollers across to the
women in the next car,  "I want to see you naked and to sacrifice a
goat."  When Lee is called in by his commanding officer and
assigned the job of tracking down the Triad gang and its deadly
leader, Ricky Tan (John Lone), Carter sounds more than annoyed
but we can see deep down that he's probably more excited about
the action that awaits than he would be even in the massage
parlor where he has chosen a quintet of women to relax his
muscles.</P>
<P>   The inevitable fight scenes that pit the two buddies against the
sinister, unsmiling gang members are happily not over-edited but
compared to what Jet Li faced in "Kiss of the Dragon," pitting Li
against a veritable army of black belts, Jackie's skirmishes are a
walk in the park.</P>
<P>   The story by Jeff Nathanson and Ross LaManna moves along
swiftly, from Hong Kong to L.A. to Vegas with nary of moment of
zen-like meditation to accomplish any character-building.  The
humor, such as it is, is based on physical action except for one
great racially tinged gag about an entertainer's color.  The coolest
stunt in the picture featured Jackie Chan with a grenade taped
securely to his mouth while Hu Li (Zhang Ziyi), who is in cahoots
with the Triad gang, is trying to get her finger on the button that
will blow his 32 teeth into his brain--as the malignant star of
"Crouching Tiger" puts it.  Roselyn Sanchez and Zhang Ziyi could
easily make the cut for the next Bond movie ("Bond 20") if the
producers were scouting the field and Ms. Zhang in particular is
absolutely gorgeous. A shame that Mr. Ratner could not have
afforded more time for the woman who made "Crouching Tiger"
such a vital and engaging movie.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 90 minutes.  (C) 2001 by
