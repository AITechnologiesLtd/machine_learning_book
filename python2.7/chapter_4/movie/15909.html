<P>Woody Allen has always been around with some eccentric stories. This is
probably as good a film as he has ever done, at least it is better centered
as a story, than he usually is.</P>
<P>And it almost is not the story that attracts us to this film, but  the way
that his characters carry themselves. It is difficult not to consider this
an excellent film, in the way it is done, with its ludicrous Greek chorus
and all, which is just perfect, though the people I saw it with, do not
understand this stuff, and did not find it funny to see the chorus break
into a musical number, while also editorializing everything, which Woody
Allen has always
done on his own character and we got bored with it.</P>
<P>The story is simple, though it has its intricate turns.  A Manhattan couple
and their marriage are just about over, and they adopt a child. The man's
curiosity wins out and he finds that the child he adopted is the son of a
porn star, whom he goes after to meet. And she is a bit on the bird brain
mentality, but she does have feelings.  And Woody tries to help her along,
but never tells her that it is her lost child that he has adopted.  But in
the
middle of it all, in a lark, they get together, finally, and have an evening
of fun, which the story suggests has her get pregnant, and she is feeling
better about having lost her first child.  And on the way out of town, she
meets another man, and lo and behold everyone is happy ever after... well,
the marriage of Woody and his wife, is probably dead too, as she  has done
her side thing also.</P>
<P>Well, if anything, this is typical Woody Allen, in that the stories are
totally intricate, and intermixed so much that
it is off the wall. On the other hand, it is the "innocent"  side that makes
this an intricate story, and Woody refuses to condemn that part of things.
There are plenty of moments when we could easily get disgusted with the
young girl's lifestyle, and living. But somehow, we take some pity on her,
and do not spend our time judging her wrongs, or her next movie.  And we
definitely know that Woody's marriage in the story, is in trouble, as its
fires have gone out.</P>
<P>Were it not for the funny stuff, this film could easily be considered styled
a bit after the Godard method of filming, where a suggestion as to right and
wrong is never made, and the audience has to choose, something that the
Hollywood viewer can never appreciate, where all the characters have to be
separated by either colors, or obvious deeds. In this film, people are just
that, people.  And this style, creates a lot of funny, weird moments, that
are enjoyable for the discriminating seer, although terribly boring for
others. In so many ways, Woody lets the camera talk, or keeps it running so
that the characters have to live a bit longer, and do not become a shadow of
themselves, an idea, a mere representation of who they are.  And thus we
never
really find the girl unattractive, Woody boring, or any of the other
characters in the film out of place.</P>
<P>But the funniest thing in this film is not even Woody, but Myra Sorvino, who
ended up getting the Oscar for
her portrayal, of what starts out being a blonde bimbo, and becomes a rather
nice woman in the film.  And it
is hard to let go of F. Murray Abraham, as Woody's friend, and alter ego, as
the leader of the chorus, whose
staging, is what separates this film apart from others. Unfortunately one
has to have known the Greek chorus
in the boring Greek plays, to appreciate the style that Woody has designed
for this production, which is immediately off the wall, specially when it
breaks its commentary into a song and dance routine.  But it never stops to
make its point.  It's the modern chorus for the 20th century, used in the
only way that we will ever understand, or probably ever appreciate.</P>
<P>Magnificent film, if you want to appreciate one of America's truly great
writers and directors, the Capra of the 80's and 90's.  It's a shame that
while he has critical success, his films rarely go beyond that. He deserves
so much more than that, and he will be forever remembered for his writing
and directing, never his acting, the character of which we are basically
tired of.  But what is around him, makes for an excellent film.</P>
