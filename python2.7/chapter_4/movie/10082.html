<P>Cancer. Rainforests. Woman's Lib. Wow! What a socially-aware movie all those
elements would make, eh? Socially-aware? *Maybe* . . . but also boring.</P>
<P>MEDICINE MAN stars Sean Connery as Dr. Robert Campbell, a scientist who has
spent quite a few years in the Amazon rainforest trying to re-discover a cure
for cancer. That's right, he *did* discover a cure, but due to one lacking
ingredient that he just can't place, he has been unable to duplicate his
initial result. Enter Lorraine Braco as Dr. Rae Crane. Uh oh. A woman.
Campbell sure wasn't expecting this, and naturally the two do anything but hit
it off.</P>
<P>With a trivial amount of effort, the two make the best of things and set out
to determine what's missing from Campbell's concoction. No, it's not
Campbell's Cream of Cancer soup, but rather a remedy derived from a particular
flower native to the region; a region which, by the obvious way, is being torn
down minute by minute.</P>
<P>MEDICINE MAN is actually quite predictable and routine, leaving one bored and
unimpressed. At best, you'll likely find this movie tolerable. There is no
real tension, no real romance, and no real freshness to the film. The only
thing it has going for it are some nice shots of the Amazon, but nothing at
all besides that. Even Sean Connery is predominantly mundane!</P>
<P>It's Lorraine Braco's performance that stands out . . . in an all but positive
way! Braco is downright awful as the whiny, always complaining, "independent"
woman of the 90's. In fact, everyone in this film seems apt to arguing. Every
conversation turns into a shouting match without warning. It's very hokey and
very annoying. What is the purpose here? Oh, that's right . . . every good
"love" story starts off with a seemingly hateful couple that will inevitably
fall in love.</P>
<P>A social-issue cliche, MEDICINE MAN is much too much what we've already seen.
When blasé performances are the *best* thing you can expect from a movie, you
know it's a bad sign. Not completely unwatchable, it's still comparable to a
glass of warm milk. Don't waste your time.</P>
