                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Embeth Davidtz.
Screenplay:  Steven Zaillian.
Director:  Steven Spielberg.</P>
<P>     Back in August, I wrote the following:  "If SCHINDLER'S LIST is
even halfway decent, Steven Spielberg will be nominated for Best
Director, and probably win."  That statement was based on the
assumption that such an award would basically be a lifetime achievement
recognition, like Al Pacino's Best Actor win last year, as well as an
industry-wide "thank you" for the coattails business provided by
JURASSIC PARK.  I didn't expect that if he did win, he would actually
deserve it.  But with SCHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg has crafted a nearly
perfect film, a gripping and brilliantly acted epic which is not only
the best film of 1993, but probably the best film of the decade thus
far.</P>
<P>     SCHINDLER'S LIST is the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam
Neeson), a German businessman and Nazi sympathizer who decides to turn
the 1939 invasion of Poland into a personal windfall.  Cashing in on
carefully established Party contacts, Schindler sets up an enamelware
factory in Krakow to make pots and pans for the German army.  His
startup capital is provided by wealthy Jews with few other options,
among them accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley).  Schindler makes a
fortune utilizing Jewish slave labor, until his business and the lives
of hundreds of thousands of Jews collide with the March 1943
liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, and the subsequent relocation of Jews
to Plaszow labor camp.  There Schindler establishes a friendship with
Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and attempts to use his money
and influence to save the lives of his workers.</P>
<P>     Longtime viewers of Spielberg films will scarcely recognize his
hand in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Gone are the swooping crane shots; gone are
the zoom-ins on awestruck faces.  With the exception of a risky
epilogue, gone too is the cloying manipulation of emotion.  This is a
mature, restrained Spielberg, and his narrative decisions are right on
the money.  He casts a glossy sheen on early scenes showing Schindler
wining and dining highly placed SS officers, playing up the "panache"
which Schindler later describes as his strong suit.  Another sequence
juxtaposes a wealthy Jewish family leaving their home for the ghetto
with a smug Schindler moving into the very same house.  One scene after
another is expertly staged, too many individual moments to mention but
each and every one liable to leave an indelible mark on your memory.</P>
<P>     What allows SCHINDLER'S LIST to work both as fine drama and vivid
historical document is screenwriter Steven Zaillian's (SEARCHING FOR
BOBBY FISCHER) decision to make the characters as memorable as the
images.  Oskar Schindler is a marvelously intricate study, a slimy and
self-serving profiteer who finds himself becoming an unlikely savior
before he even realizes what he's doing.  Liam Neeson manages both
sides of Schindler skillfully, making the transition seamlessly.  Ben
Kingsley turns in a typically understated performance as Stern, the
"good angel" who must walk a delicate line while encouraging
Schindler's magnanimity.  The finest performance is also the most
disturbing, Ralph Fiennes' perfectly amoral Amon Goeth.  As a creature
of pure random destruction, it would have been easy for Goeth to become
another stereotypical Nazi, but Fiennes gives him surprising depth and
complexity, particularly in a tense scene with his Jewish housekeeper
(Embeth Davidtz).  All three performances are among the finest of the
year, and they give SCHINDLER'S LIST a personal quality that transcends
the subject matter.</P>
<P>     There will be some discussion about Spielberg's use of color in
the depiction of a young girl in a red coat who catches Schindler's
eye.  My feeling is that this is part of a larger attempt to make the
Holocaust a tragedy of individuals rather than of a faceless mass.
Spielberg includes several scenes of SS troops and the Jews themselves
announcing their names as they are registered, given work assignments,
or separated into "essential" and "non-essential."  In this way, he
assaults the viewer both with staggering numbers and with individual
lives.  There are many disturbing images of arbitrary murder, of death
without pattern or meaning, and in the midst of such arbitrariness one
act of mercy could mean everything.  "The list is life," Stern tells
Schindler when their work is complete, and SCHINDLER'S LIST is a
testimony to the individuals whose lives were changed forever by the
Holocaust.</P>
