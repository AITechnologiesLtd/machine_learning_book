<P> You could dress a hamburger up with hollandaise sauce and raspberry chutney
and still not have a dish that could pass for haute cuisine. Similarly,
writer Vince Gilligan has invested "Home Fries" with plenty of eccentric
characters and wacky situations but hasn't quite come up with enough movie
to fill the big screen. This homey, homely little tale has "Lifetime movie
special" written all over it.
 That may be part of the reason "Fries" has been on the back-burner at
Warner Brothers for the better part of two years; the only conceivable
reason for its appearance now is the surprise success of Drew Barrymore's
recent turns in "The Wedding Singer" and "Ever After."
 But though her fans may applaud Barrymore's willingness to hide her sex
appeal under a Little Orphan Annie hairdo and an enormous belly, "Fries" is
one of her lesser vehicles. As Sally, the slightly dim drive-thru cashier
whose affair with a married man ends with her pregnant and him dead,
Barrymore waddles through scene after scene in a variety of shabby
housedresses and fussy, fluffy sweaters, the kinds of ridiculous clothes
Hollywood seems for some reason to believe downtrodden young women in the
Midwest actually wear. Since Sally is a cheery and passive sort, Barrymore's
performance is little more than a series of cherubic smiles and fey
line-readings.
 Like "Meet Joe Black," "Fries" infantilizes its love interest, in this case
Luke Wilson's Dorian, who's supposed to be a helicopter pilot and former
soldier, but who still sleeps in bunk beds with his brother Angus (Jake
Busey) and gets all gee-whiz bashful whenever Sally's near. No wonder The
Reverend Horton Heat's "Big Little Baby" is featured on the soundtrack.
 The charms of "Fries" are mostly incidental, like the "Space Cadet"
lunchbox Sally carries or the wake at which "You Light Up My Life" can be
heard playing in the background. The only stand-out in the cast is Catherine
O'Hara's twisted portrait of a widow so obsessed with finding out the
identity of her late husband's mistress she believes she can feel the
woman's presence in the air, "like the sick, sweet smell of a cow's breath."
 This is a movie that strains to win over its audience with its cornpone
characters and every so often the effort pays off as director Dean Parisot
concocts a truly funny scene or a convincingly tender moment between Sally
and Dorian. But finally "Home Fries" is much like the food it takes its name
from -- a trifle greasy and sorely lacking in nourishment. James Sanford</P>
