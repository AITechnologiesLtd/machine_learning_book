<P>PLOT:
The year is 2176 and the planet Mars has been colonized. A bunch of cops are
sent to a village to pick up a killer from prison. Upon their arrival, they find
an empty town filled with decapitated corpses. It isn't long before they realize
that certain "ghosts" from the planet have arisen and are entering human bodies
in order to kill the others. From then on, it's the humans versus the
zombie-like ghost-goths fest!</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Do you like playing "Doom" or "Quake" on your computer? Do you like the loud
music...I mean, really loud music? Do you enjoy watching a zillion people get
mowed down by gunfire a la Schwarzenegger movies from the 80s? Do you wanna see
guys and girls get their limbs chopped off by sawblades and shit? Do you enjoy
the kitchiness of the blaxploitation movies from the 70s? Do you like Natasha
Henstridge and wanna see her in underwear and kickin' ass? Are you a fan of Ice
Cube and appreciate his corny one-liners? Have you ever wondered what would come
out if director John Carpenter decided to take elements from all of his previous
films and mix them all up into one (including THE THING, VAMPIRES, ESCAPE FROM
NY, etc...)? Would you like to see Pam Grier's head on a stick? Have you been
waiting for a "fun" Mars movie for some time? Do you believe in the concept of a
mindless movie, a "popcorn" flick created solely for your enjoyment in that
point in time and not expected to be taken any more seriously than that?</P>
<P>Well, if you answered "yes" to most of these questions, then you are likely an
ideal candidate to enjoy this cheesy picture. If you answered "no" to most of
these questions, this film is definitely not for you, please move on and thank
me for it later. I personally went into this movie with super-low expectations
and had a blast. I got into its slow start, appreciated its heavy score and
seriously had fun watching the loads, and I mean loads of killings, maimings and
beheadings in the film (all in the name of ghosts running rampant on Mars, of
course). Now are you supposed to take notes during a movie like this? Of course
not! It's an all-out gang-bang movie for the senses and I was running along side
the whole way. Of course, there are many actual elements of the movie that
aren't really "good". For example, I didn't like the "ghosts" at all. All they
seemed to do was scream and mope around like "Mad Max" rejects. I also didn't
like the over-use of flashbacks in the film, but did get used to them after a
while. I also thought that the whole town of Shining Canyon looked like a giant
movie set, didn't think that the premise was very original and noticed some
crappy CGI here and there, but I honestly didn't really mind it all that much
because I "got into" the cheesiness of it all. A special nod goes out to the
film's final scene which was especially cool.</P>
<P>This is not a "good" movie by the book definition of that word. This is the kind
of movie that you'll really dig when you're drunk with some buddies and just
wanna have a blast! There are no big words in this movie. The plot is very
simple. There are decapitations galore, blood galore and lots of people getting
killed as the good guys fight the bad. If any of that turns your dial, you're
barking up the right tree. If not, don't come crying to me afterwards. This
movie is cheesy, it's fun, it's loud and it's not trying to be 2001: A SPACE
ODYSSEY...it's low-grade entertainment and it works! At least according to me,
and God knows that I've enjoyed a handful of "bad movies" (according to others)
in the past (LAST ACTION HERO, BATTLEFIELD EARTH, HUDSON HAWK). So you've been
warned... ;)</P>
