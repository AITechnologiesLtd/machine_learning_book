                       A film review by Mike Watson

<P>"Psycho meets the Exorcist with no holds barred".  A blurb like that
sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget, third rate
rip-off.  But no, this tacky plug comes from the poster for SUSPIRIA,
perhaps Italian horror director Dario Argento's most consistently
successful film.</P>
<P>What impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic, supernatural
thriller is that Argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are
matched by a near-fully coherent narrative.  Screenplays have always
been his Achilles heel; confusing subplots, gaping holes, totally
illogical incidents and reactions.  No question: Argento has always
been a better director than a writer.  Fortunately, he gets the
plotting pretty well right with SUSPIRIA, taking his cue from a book
by Thomas De Quincey called "Suspiria de Profundis".  The film's
storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic, provided one can
accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of
witches.</P>
<P>Jessica Harper plays an American who travels to Germany to further her
studies in dance.  Arriving at the school late at night in driving
rain, she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly
distressed state.  What happens next - and I don't make the comparison
lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity, shock value and
sheer directorial flair ranks alongside Alfred Hitchcock's infamous
shower scene in PSYCHO.  It's quite possibly a homage to Hitchcock,
but with its baroque sets, graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic
musical accompaniment by the Gothic rock group Goblin, this stunning
sequence remains very much Argento's own.</P>
<P>Though nothing else quite equals the intensity of SUSPIRIA'S opening
15 minutes, the film continues to be never anything less than
engrossing as Harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to
realise this is no ordinary ballet school.  We meet an assortment of
slightly sinister characters, most notably the head ballet teacher
played by Alida Valli in another one of those delicious
sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well.  Several more
violent murders ensue, including a startling scene in a deserted
square where a blind man is...well, I wouldn't want to spoil things
now, would I?  And the film's climax, staged amid secret corridors and
hidden rooms, has a Gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive.</P>
<P>The English language versions of most Argento movies usually suffer
trimming, and not just for the violence - DEEP RED and PHENOMENA, for
example, have been appallingly hacked about.  Fortunately, the cuts to
SUSPIRIA (about 7 minutes in this version) have not adversely affected
the film.  The dubbing of the Italian actors into English is quite
competently done, too, excepting one appalling and unintentionally
hilarious effort with a conversation between Harper and a professor
about the history of witchcraft in the region.</P>
<P>And the soundtrack?  It is interesting to imagine what power the film
would have lost if it had been scored by someone else.  As it stands,
the use of Goblin's music in SUSPIRIA is outstanding.  Apparently,
Argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors
could hear the music as they acted out their parts.  A stereo video
player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience.  Even better,
see SUSPIRIA in a cinema, where you'll get the added bonus of
widescreen.</P>
<P>And the colours!  Deep reds, eerie blues, a superb use of shadow and
contrast.  The cinematography of  Luciano Tovoli, whose more recent
credits include REVERSAL OF FORTUNE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, is
uniformly superb.  A nod also must go to production designer Giuseppe
Bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors.  These kinds of settings
are crucial to the atmosphere of Argento's more surreal excursions,
the other most notable example being INFERNO (1980) on which Bassan
also worked.</P>
<P>SUSPIRIA is the film that broke Dario Argento into the major league of
European directors, and it is fully deserving of its cult status.  The
gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always
been one of Argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a
fascinating, compelling example of Italian horror.</P>
