<P>Here's an ironic oddity: a movie about overcoming a handicap that,
despite a dearth of assets, never quite overcomes its own handicaps.
Notable for the trivia it offers rather than for presenting a
well-rounded portrait of disability, "At First Sight" tells an immensely
crowded tale adapted from a case study in Dr. Oliver Sacks' 1995
non-fiction novel "An Anthropologist on Mars." But check out Penny
Marshall's "Awakenings" for a stronger Sacks adaptation, as "Sight"
boasts similar high-quality acting and an engrossing set-up, but lacks
the eventual focus and smarts of its '90 counterpart. Oh, well. At least
it settles the alleged existence of a special Braille "Playboy" once and
for all.</P>
<P>Photogenic leads Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino click as a blind masseur
(he) and a traveling architect (she) who fall deeply in love after an
apparently superlative back-rub moves her to tears - a goofy sequence
saved, like many others, by their generated chemistry. Not far into the
affair, Sorvino locates a cure for Kilmer's nearly life-long affliction:
miracle eye surgery that restores his vision but comes with damaging
physical and mental side-effects, like lots of blurry, distorted camera
angles. At this point, interest in the story reaches its pinnacle as
Kilmer grapples with his newfound sense. Then, the film goes in
directions that don't make much sense.</P>
<P>Kilmer's omnipresent Stevie Wonder-esque smile during all of this will
cause unintentional laughs for some, but his performance is still an
improbable stretch he executes admirably. Sorvino's supposed to be a
brain, but thanks to some unfortunate scripting, she comes off like the
air-headed dealership clerk she so wonderfully played in "Romy and
Michele's High School Reunion." Kelly McGillis lends fine support as
Kilmer's stolid sister, and even Nathan Lane ("The Birdcage") pops up
for a few scenes as a visual therapist described by colleagues as
"unorthodox," though his "unorthodox" methods seem to stem less from
narrative necessity than a need for comic relief.</P>
<P>Further distracting from the highly intriguing central
to-see-or-not-to-see dynamics - and bogging down the midsection
considerably, inflating this puppy out past two interminable hours - are
a seemingly endless (but inexplicit) series of sex-in-the-shadows
montages and a pair of superfluous subplots involving Kilmer's search
for his estranged father and Sorvino's relationship with her ex-husband.
We don't care, many are likely to say. Even a TV-movie-of-the-week,
which is the status the overloaded "At First Sight" struggles to
overcome, would have jettisoned this padding in favor of a leaner,
meaner - and therefore more effective - message.<HR></P>
