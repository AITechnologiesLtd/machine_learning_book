<P>"Bicentennial Man" made my thoughts and responses clash -- I knew that its 
plot was stupid, but even as the fact nagged at me, the movie held my 
attention. Its premise is one that has appeared in several movies already, 
and is one that I always react against; but somehow I got enough out of the 
picture to leave with a smile on my face.</P>
<P>Robin Williams stars as Andrew, a big metal robot in the shape of a human 
being. Remember the maid in the TV cartoon show "The Jetsons"? Just like 
that. Andrew is bought by a well-to-do family man (Sam Neill), who notices 
that his new machine is displaying signs of emotion and creativity; it carves 
cute little models for the man's children, for example, and points out which 
one is its favourite.</P>
<P>The businessman is kind-hearted and patient, not to mention open-minded, and 
so decides to treat Andrew as a 'he', not an 'it'. He converses with the 
robot, trying to figure out just how much humanity there is inside its head, 
eventually coming to treat it as one of the family. The man allows Andrew to 
wear clothes, keep the income from the things he builds, and ask questions 
about any topic he feels curious about.</P>
<P>Time moves on, the man and his wife pass away, their children grow up, and so 
on and so forth. Andrew, immortal of course, since he wasn't made in Taiwan, 
stays alive throughout; observing a great deal of humanity, absorbing it, and 
becoming more human. He searches the globe for other robots displaying signs 
of emotional life, and while he doesn't find any, Andrew does run into a 
scientist (Oliver Platt) who agrees to help him become actually physically 
human.</P>
<P>This is a grand journey, that, as the movie's title suggests, takes two 
hundred years to complete. So "Bicentennial Man" has a lot of ground to 
cover, and that leads to one of its stylistic downfalls -- events are skimmed 
over, relationships are suggested rather than portrayed, and the piece is 
tied together with constant soppy music.</P>
<P>With no strong structure to sweep us away, what gets our attention is the 
IDEA of what is happening, and the idea is stupid. Like "D.A.R.Y.L.", 
"Bicentennial Man" doesn't seem to understand that no matter how much its 
characters accept it, and how insistently it forces the notion upon us, the 
concept of a robot developing human features is just not plausible. A 
computer is a device that follows programmed instructions; a living brain is 
an organic member that can grow, learn, and process metaphysical ideas. Of 
all the movies about computers with minds of their own, only "Demon Seed", a 
1977 thriller starring Julie Christie, has made any attempt to remember these 
simple facts.</P>
<P>So what did I get out of "Bicentennial Man"? Well, it features plenty of 
amusing scenes in which Williams uses a robot's cold logic to try to figure 
out the disorganised way humans behave. The joke doesn't wear out its welcome 
because human life has so many different facets, and there's comic potential 
in every one. I also loved the visual style of this movie, which is set 
between the years 2005 and 2205, but doesn't shove overblown space-age 
fantasy designs down our throats. It takes a stunningly sensible approach to 
how the technology and fashions of the next two centuries are likely to 
develop, and the production design never calls attention to itself as 
'futuristic' -- it's present as realistic background. </P>
<P>While the wretchedness of its premise bothered my in every scene, the 
wonderful look and feel of this picture delighted me just as often. I dreaded 
a mawkish performance from Williams (it has been less than a year since 
"Patch Adams"), but the limitations of his character keep him in check, and 
he serves as a charming lead in this creative and pretty original piece of 
work. The brief, impersonal structure makes the events in "Bicentennial Man" 
seem cold; the aesthetics make them amazing. Funny. Andrew probably 
experiences the world in rather a similar way.</P>
