<PRE>                                    SNEAKERS
                       A film review by Roger Snappy Rubio
                        Copyright 1992 Roger Snappy Rubio</PRE>
<P>Starring Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd, Mary McDonnell,
         River Phoenix, and David Strathairn
Directed by Phil Alden Robinson</P>
<P>     This movie was a pure treat.  It reminded me a lot of WARGAMES with
Matthew Broderick.  It's got a lot of humor and a lot of government
bashing.  Everything a movie-goer could want.  And its also got a lot of
gadgets.</P>
<P>     SNEAKERS is the story of two computer hackers who in the late 60's
set out to take on the world from behind their CRT's.  The only problem
is that one of them gets arrested, and through a stroke of luck, the
other gets away.  This other, played by Robert Redford, later gets
involved with a group of very talented people, all from different
vocations and all possessing some sort of secret.  Their job is to break
into people's places so that the people who had their place broken into
know how to prevent others from breaking in.  They are "hired" by the
National Security Agency to obtain an ultimate code-breaker, only to
find that the people that hired them are not from the NSA, and the rest
is secret.</P>
<P>     This movie is a very good execution of the now popular "ensemble
movie."  All the actors are believable in their roles, and there is
plenty of humor going around.  There is also plenty of talent (as far as
the characters are concerned), which is always a big draw at the box
office.  You can have humor, but you must also have professionalism and
realism.  The American audience demands it, and SNEAKERS delivers.  I
thought it was a wonderful movie because I love gadgets, especially ones
that can tell your stress level or ones that can decode any encryption.
But never fear to the average movie-goer; this movie is *not* loaded
down with a lot of techno-mumbo-jumbo.  It's basically a high-stakes
romp, and it is a good crowd pleaser.  After all, it scored very high in
test screenings!</P>
<P>     So if gadgetry, conspiracy, and humor are your game, check out
SNEAKERS.  If you don't, you may never know what the government is up
to....</P>
