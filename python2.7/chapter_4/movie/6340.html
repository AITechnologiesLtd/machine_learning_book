<PRE>                                MOTHER NIGHT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Some authors are easily transferable to the medium of film.  From
William Shakespeare (ROMEO AND JULIET) to John Grisham (THE FIRM) and
Tom Clancy (THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER), screenwriters and directors have
been able to capture the essence of most writer's work and move it to
the big screen.  But for some novelists, the adaptations have all
resulted in varying degrees of failure.  Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
(SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE) is one such author.  The latest attempt is
director Keith Gordon's MOTHER NIGHT.  Although it has some appeal and
charm, it also ends up on the debit side of his ledger.</P>
<P>     First time screenwriter Robert Weide tries hard to make a film out
of Vonnegut's book, but I suspect the book's style make such efforts
almost hopeless. Vonnegut's books have a cult following, especially on
campuses, but their appeal lies in their strange syntax and structure
as much as in their characters.</P>
<P>     The film opens in 1961 in Israel where Howard W. Campbell Jr.
(Nick Nolte) is about to be tried for war crimes.  In the cell above
his is Adolf Eichmann.  Campbell is given three weeks to write his
memoirs, and then his trial will commence.  This part of the film is
shot by Tom Richmond in a grainy black and white.  Most of the show is
told in flashback where the images are full of lush colors that are,
for reasons I'll discuss later, too pretty.</P>
<P>     Howard is an American whose father has worked most of his life in
Berlin.  Howard has become a playwright and is married to a German
woman, Helga Noth (Sheryl Lee who played Astrid in BACKBEAT).  Just
before the war starts a "Blue Fairy Godmother" named Frank Wirtanen
(John Goodman) comes to Howard with a proposition.  Frank works for the
American War Department and wants Howard to broadcast Nazi propaganda
during the war which will include coded messages past to him by another
spy whom he will never meet.</P>
<P>     After Frank tells him that the US will disown him after the war,
Howard asks why Frank thinks he will take the job.  Howard says, "You
love good, you hate evil, and you'd do anything for the sake of
romance."  Yes, suspending disbelief is mandatory in MOTHER NIGHT.</P>
<P>     "I guess the moral here is: you must be careful what you pretend
to be because in the end you are who you're pretending to be," reasons
Howard about his moral dilemma.</P>
<P>     Nolte is an actor with a proclivity for overacting.  MULHOLLAND
FALLS is one such film, but hopefully you missed it.  In others, like
THE PRINCE OF TIDES, he stays in control.  Here he gives the first
performance where he manages to underact.  His acting is disengaged and
borders on being boring.  Even when Nolte's acting is awful, it has
rarely been boring.  In Nolte's defense, the whole show exists on a
plane disjoint from that of the audience.  Gordon's direction is never
involving, and the viewers become little more than voyeurs.</P>
<P>     At the end of the first act, the war ends and as promised, his
fairy godmother shows up to disown him with, "Your role will remain
classified, and Uncle Sam's official position is you're the scum of the
earth."</P>
<P>     "Yes, I've changed.  People should be changed by World Wars or
what are World Wars for," reasons Howard in the second act.  This part
is set in New York City where Howard forms a friendship with George
Kraft (Alan Arkin).  Howard is officially dead, but George encourages
him to tell the world his story and besides, "all the best writers are
dead."  During this act, one bizarre character after another shows up
with most being white supremacists including one who is actually black
and is known as the Black Fuhrer.  This act is even less effective than
the first.</P>
<P>     In the end, there are only two reasons to see MOTHER NIGHT.  One
makes sense, and the other doesn't.  First, the script includes some
excellent dialog, bitingly funny and insightful.  Second, the show has
a lovely serenity to it.</P>
<P>     Since this is a tragedy about Nazis and about innocent people
being trapped, why we should have this tranquillity makes little sense.
Outwardly the situations are tragic, but the lush cinematography, the
overly dreamy music by Michael Convertino and the peaceful composure of
most of the participants give the film an inappropriate peacefulness.</P>
<P>     As just a few examples of this, when the war is about to end, two
of the Nazi decide to let the Russian take them and probably kill them,
but they are completely at peace with this.  The scenes of wartime
Germany are picture postcard perfect.  Rich people in Tuxedos live in a
Norman Rockwell setting.  Finally, the audience is lulled with the
constant sounds of Bing Crosby's melodious voice singing "White
Christmas."</P>
<P>     I hope that movie producers will not again waste our time with
Vonnegut.  Savor him in print if you will, but don't try to force his
work where it doesn't fit.</P>
<P>     MOTHER NIGHT runs 1:50.  It is rated R.  There is brief nudity, a
little violence, and some bad language.  The show is all pretty mild
and would be fine for any teenager.  I enjoyed parts of it, especially
the script, but there is not enough there to recommend it.  I give the
picture **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
