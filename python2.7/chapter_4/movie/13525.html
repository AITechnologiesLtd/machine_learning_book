                             Passion in the Desert
                    A movie review by "Average Joe" Barlow

<P>        This is a strange one, kids.  Even though independent films
frequently tackle subjects which Hollywood considers taboo or unmarketable,
"Passion in the Desert" raises the bar to new heights.  Interracial love
stories are uncommon enough on the silver screen... but interspecies?
        Such is Lavina Currier's vision.  The tale, adapted from a short
story by Honore' de Balzac, opens in the Egyptian desert circa 1798 A.D.
A small group of soldiers have been assigned to escort Napolean's favorite
artist (played by Michel Piccoli) on a cross-country march as he draws and
paints pictures of the landscape.  The land is staggeringly hostile, and
the group has its hands full coping with the crippling heat, scorpions,
sandstorms, and frequent attacks by rogue nomads.
        During a particularly fierce sandstorm, the artist and a solider
named Augustin Robert (Ben Daniels) get separated from the rest of their
group.  They find themselves lost, hundreds of miles from civilization, with
no supplies to speak of.  They realise the severity of their predicament at
once ("The desert is totally unpredictable, like living in the tempest of a
woman's heart," observes the artist in one of the film's most memorable
lines) and immediately begin the search for the rest of their group.  The
heat claims their horses fairly quickly, and the two men manage to survive
only by drinking the artist's paint.  Even so, the elderly artist is
quickly overcome by the sweltering temperatures, and Augustin (who is the
spitting image of Kenneth Branagh) is forced to leave his friend beneath
a small tree, promising to return with help as soon as he can.
        Little more than a zombie at this point, Augustin chances upon a
nomad camp which appears to be deserted.  In a wonderfully tense scene, he
sneaks inside, searching for food and water.  I won't reveal what he
discovers there (it's one of the film's best scenes), but soon after, our
hero finds himself trapped in a cave with a leopard who won't allow him to
leave.  No matter how he attempts to flee, the leopard always outsmarts him.
Augustin realises that he must earn the creature's respect, and thus begins
a fascinating game of wits.  It's "The English Patient" meets "Dr.
Dolittle."
        Yes, he succeeds, and the two become friends.  It's at this point
that the film switches gears, changing from an exciting drama into something
else completely.  Augustin and the leopard become very close indeed as they
learn to trust and respect each other.  They share food and water.  They
cuddle and play.  They hunt together.  They kiss.  They lick each other's
skin.  God help us, they even slow dance.  In short, they... they... fall
in love, basically.  No, I'm not making this up.  Now it's "Dr. Dolittle"
meets "Lolita."
        From this point on, I had no idea who I was supposed to root for.
Do we hope Augustin makes it back to civilization safely?  That he and the
leopard live happily ever after?  That the SPCA shows up and shoots them
both?  I'm not sure, and that may be the film's biggest flaw: we have no
idea what the ultimate goal of the movie is, nor why Augustin forsakes the
artist after he befriends the leopard.  Surely he could've brought some
water to the old man.  But no... from the moment he enters the nomad camp,
he never seems to think about his companion again.  Why?  I have no idea.
        However, you will not see a single movie this year that's better
photographed than "Passion."  One could literally take a random freeze-
frame from any moment of the film and have a "National Geographic" cover
photo.  From the innovative use of camera angles and shadows, down to the
color of the costumes and the sky itself, this is a movie whose images
have been meticulously planned, down to the smallest detail.  Visually, it
makes "Titanic" look like a home movie (and considering I saw "Titanic" five
times because of its visuals, that should tell you something).  Particularly
impressive is the scene in which we see the leopard for the first time:
darkness.  Then, a pair of glowing green eyes pierce the gloom.  Gradually,
the leopard comes into view... but it looks as though the director is not
so much lighting the set as removing the darkness.  Finally, we get our
first look at the entire creature.  We won't soon forget it.
        The music is also wonderful.  Composed by Jose' Nieto (whose name
I'd never heard before), it features some lovely orchestral work highlighted
by Egyptian instruments.  Best of all, Celine Dion is noticeably absent.
I'll be buying this soundtrack.
        The climax of the film is disturbing, but not unexpected.  Still,
it appears with a suddenness that's a little disorienting.  The movie just
ends, as though the production suddenly realised they didn't have enough
money to buy more film and had to wrap everything up quickly.
        The performance of Ben Daniels in the role of Augustin is admirable.
He conveys all the emotions we'd expect his character to be feeling, and
never seems to be uncomfortable with the material.  We always believe his
sincerity, even as we question his sanity.  (Yes, that's a complement.)
I'd like to see more of his work in the future.
        Truth be told, I found the audience's response just as interesting
as the film itself.  Startled gasps and muffled giggles floated around the
surprisingly crowded theater for much of the screening.  The woman sitting
in front of me stormed out after only an hour and didn't return, but a lady
sitting towards the back wept loudly during the end credits.  And as the
audience filed out, I noticed at least a dozen people wearing expressions
similar to my own-- expressions that said, quite simply, "Did I really see
that?  Is this a joke?"
        This comparison will probably raise a few eyebrows, but "Passion
in the Desert" reminded me of "Dances with Wolves" in many ways.  Both films
are set in the past, and follow the story of a military officer separated
from the rest of his group.  Both characters befriend an animal, are
forever changed by what happens to them, and are reluctant to return to
their former way of life when the time comes.  In all honesty, I think I
liked "Passion" better.
        This film isn't a must-see, but it's not the worst film out there,
either.  The potentially disturbing story is countered by excellent acting,
music, and cinematography.  But be warned: there's quite a lot of violence,
blood, and some full-frontal male nudity.  Leave the kids at home.</P>
