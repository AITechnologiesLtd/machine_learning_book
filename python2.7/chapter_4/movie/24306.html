<PRE>GLADIATOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In GLADIATOR, director Ridley Scott (ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER) wants to
give us a SPARTACUS for our time.  With John Mathieson's stunning
cinematography, Hans Zimmer's music reminiscent of a Wagnerian opera,
Art Max's lavish sets and with extensive computer graphics, Scott has
some impressive ingredients with which to work.  Most of all, he has
Russell Crowe (an Oscar nominee for THE INSIDER) in the starring role of
Maximus, a general and a gladiator.  A red-blooded film, it works
magnificently in its fighting sequences as people are sliced and diced
faster than you can count them.  A virile motion picture, it's the
happiest when it's the goriest.</P>
<PRE>But … (Yes, there's a "but.")</PRE>
<P>It's great in the ring and on the field of battle, but most of the movie
concerns Roman political intrigue that's as foreign to American
audiences as the machinations of today's ever-changing Italian
governments.  Although it picks up toward the end, most of the movie has
you slumping in your seat as it drags on.   Action pictures should be
measured by how often you are on the edge of your seat, and in GLADIATOR
this almost never happens.  The script's writing committee of David H.
Franzoni (AMISTAD), John Logan (BATS) and William Nicholson (FIRST
KNIGHT) has success with Maximus but significantly underdevelops the
other key roles.</P>
<P>The story concerns a Roman general, Maximus, whose allegiance to a
quickly murdered Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) costs Maximus
his freedom and the lives of his family.  Incorrectly assumed dead,
Maximus reappears in the gladiator minor leagues, far away from Rome.
When he becomes famous, he is drafted by the majors and sent up to meet
his nemesis -- the killer of his family and the new Emperor.</P>
<P>In two bad casting choices, Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the new
Emperor and Marcus Aurelius's son, and Connie Nielsen plays Lucilla,
Commodus's sister.  An especially lame villain, Phoenix doesn't show any
depth.  Similarly Nielsen, last seen in MISSION TO MARS, approaches her
role with lackluster simplicity when an ambiguous duplicity would have
been more interesting.  The two actors sap the energy out of any scene
in which they appear.  And the ones with only them in it are the worst
of all.</P>
<P>The result is that what could and should have been a great film turns
out instead to be merely an adequate one.  Only the film's look and
Crowe's usually wonderful performance causes it to rise above the
ordinary.</P>
<P>GLADIATOR runs way too long at 2:30.  It is rated R for pervasive strong
violence and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
