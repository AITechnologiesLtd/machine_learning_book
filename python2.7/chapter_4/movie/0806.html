<PRE>                               THE EXORCIST III
                       A film review by <A HREF="mailto:kreme@nyx.uucp">kreme@nyx.uucp</A>
                        Copyright 1990 <A HREF="mailto:kreme@nyx.uucp">kreme@nyx.uucp</A></PRE>
<P>     THE EXORCIST III is the real sequel to what might have been the
single most important horror movie since Boris Karloff portrayed
Dracula.  The original EXORCIST shattered the bounds of what was
acceptable gore and, unfortunately, spawned a generation of slasher
films that were nothing but gore.  Released in 1973 it depicted a level
of violence that I do not believe had ever been encountered before.</P>
<P>     The sequel, THE EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC (I think), was so bad that
it completely submarined the career of Linda Blair (who?).  When I saw
the preview for E III in the theater several months back I heard several
people say, "Three?  Was there a Two?  I don't remember II."  The lucky
few.  The lucky few.</P>
<P>     Now, 17 years later we have a sequel.  Fifteen years have passed
and some very disturbing murders are being committed.  There is none, or
very little of the shocking gore of the original or of the multitude of
"successful" horror movies of the last decade.  The gore is minimalistic
and the emphasis is on scaring the bejeezus out of the audience without
tricks.</P>
<P>     There is one scene where the camera is set up at the end of a
hallway.  A series of miniscares and an earie soundtrack warns you that
something is going to happen.  Something dreadful.  You know what will
happen.  You know to who.  You know to who.  The demon has told you who
is going to die.  You KNOW.  And yet, when the moment comes, I nearly
bolted out of my chair.  A figure in a white flowing gown walks quickly
across the hallway, perfectly erect.  The scene is surreal.  The flowing
robes and the fast soundtrack make the action seem like it is moving too
fast, but it is real time.  The figure has the murder weapon stretched
out in front like an object of rapture.  There is never the scene of the
murder.  No blood is spilled, and yet the audience is truly terrified.</P>
<P>     I highly recommend this movie for several reasons.  It is a return
to the good old fashion psychological thriller (a la ALIEN, or PSYCHO)
with a good dose of horror thrown in for good measure.  It might be a
good idea to see THE EXORCIST before you see this to refresh your mind
as to some of the details.  The plot of the first movie is rather
important.</P>
<P>     Blatty's depiction of Satan is rather disturbing.  There is a
quality there that is so human.  The demon has his points... if you
look just for an instant from his perspective.  Blatty allows the story
to unfold slowly and terrifyingly.  There are long pauses in dialog,
and long speeches from major players in the plot.  The acting is
wonderfull [sic].</P>
