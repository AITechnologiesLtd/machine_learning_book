<PRE>ANGEL EYES
A film review by David N. Butterworth
Copyright 2001 David N. Butterworth</PRE>
<PRE>** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>Jennifer Lopez is riding a wave of popularity right now so it should come
as no surprise to anyone to see the actress turned Queen of Q102 with
another movie in theaters (following close on the heels of her lukewarm
"The Wedding Planner").  Given Lopez's current appeal, it would probably be
unwise for her to attempt anything controversial or challenging at this
point, and "Angel Eyes," therefore, is exactly the right vehicle for her:
she looks good, she turns in a decent performance, but she doesn't do
anything risky, doesn't do anything to stretch herself as an actress.</P>
<P>Luis Mandoki's film (he made the Kevin Costner/Robin Wright sudser
"Message in a Bottle") is another drama/mystery/thriller/romance, but those
looking for anything more than a romance (replete with delectable JLo
close-ups) will be disappointed--there's not a whole heck of a lot of drama
here, even less mystery, and virtually zero thrills.</P>
<P>What starts out looking like a traditional police drama (Lopez plays a
Chicago cop with relationship problems) quickly shifts gears with the
arrival of a mysterious stranger.  Catch (played by James Caviezel) is
first seen observing (or, perhaps, spying on) Lopez's Sharon Pogue as she
hangs out in bars and coffee shops, shooting the breeze with her peers,
Chicago's finest.  When Sharon is called into action, Catch is there to
save her, but not after Sharon takes a few rounds to the chest (don't
worry: we've already seen her strapping on her bullet proof vest).  That
scene is one of the film's better ones, especially if you watch Lopez's
reactions as she rips open her protective garment to verify that it did its
job.</P>
<P>So Catch and Sharon are introduced, and the more strange and mysterious
Catch seems (that name, for instance), the more strangely and mysteriously
attracted to him Sharon becomes.  Judging from his rather
sparsely-appointed apartment though, it's clear the guy has never heard of
IKEA.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, "Angel Eyes" is almost always too obvious for its own good.
 It opens with a scene of Lopez's character rescuing someone from a car
crash, and it's pretty apparent to anyone with half a brain that Catch is
that someone, yet the filmmakers go out of their way to make that
revelation, when it eventually comes, surprising.  There's a
falling-in-love montage--we've all seen those a thousand times before--and
as the film slowly segues from tough police drama (Jen looks especially
good in uniform) to touchy-feely cop romance (Jim seems to be doing
*exactly* the same facial expressions he used in "Frequency" and "Pay It
Forward"), Mandoki and writer Gerald Di Pego ("Message in a Bottle" also)
turn up the manipulation factor one hundred fold.  Caviezel's monologue in
the cemetery is effective and convincing; Lopez's monologue at her parent's
house is redundant and poorly timed.</P>
<P>That's Sonia Braga ("Kiss of the Spider Woman," "The Milagro Beanfield
War"), by the way, looking a lot older than her years, as Sharon's mother
and Shirley Knight ("Dutchman," "Petulia," and other cult '60s movies),
looking just about right, as Catch's mother-in-law Elanora Davis.</P>
<P>"Angel Eyes" won't hurt Jennifer Lopez's career any but it's only a so-so
addition to her sometimes impressive résumé.</P>
