<PRE>                               EL MARIACHI
                       A film review by Craig Good
                        Copyright 1993 Craig Good</PRE>
<P>     I'm truly sorry I don't have time to compose a full-fledged review
of EL MARIACHI, but I want to at least spread some good buzz about
the movie.  By now everybody knows that it was shot for $7,000 and has
launched the first-time director's Hollywood career.</P>
<P>     EL MARIACHI is a simple action story, well-told and with well-
drawn characters. It has a fresh appeal which struck me as BLOOD SIMPLE
meets THE OUTLAW--JOSEY WALES meets THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY. It seems to
stand as a shining example of how a small budget can be a help, and not
a hindrance, to a film maker.</P>
<P>     Were I to offer a Hollywood job to this film maker, it would
probably be as an editor. It's not that his directing isn't natural and
assured, but I think it's the cutting that really makes EL MARIACHI.
The film also captures very faithfully the look and feel of a small
Mexican town. This is clearly an insider's view, and not some Art
Director's idea of what Mexico might look like. This is the real
thing.</P>
<P>     The English subtitles are plenty good enough for any semi-literate
American to be able to enjoy the film, but if you happen to understand
Spanish you'll enjoy another level of clever (but not overly-clever)
dialogue. If you think you'd enjoy a simple, fresh change of pace film
with no actors you can recognize, go out of your way to catch EL
MARIACHI.</P>
