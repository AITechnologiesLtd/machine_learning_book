Eyes Wide Shut</PRE>
<PRE>by Ross Anthony</PRE>
<P>I heard that some people liked this film. I was not one of them.</P>
<P>Kidman and Cruise play a rich married couple tempted by seductive notions of
infidelity. Kidman's character is intoxicated (alcohol and later marijuana)
for the first 50% of her performance, then she's awkwardly cold sober for
the finish. Cruise is smashing, as always ... but great performances seem a
bit of a waste in absence of a solid script.</P>
<P>Cruise plays an M.D. and ever-trusting husband that Kidman desperately wants
to make jealous. Towards that goal, she tells of a poking incident in their
past. But, to make that tale really poking we needed to see Cruise's rock
solid trust in her earlier on (not just hear of it). Perhaps a knowing
glance from Cruise while Kidman danced with a debonair gentleman would have
done the trick.</P>
<P>There were some outstanding performances by secondary actors. Notable as
well, was the cinematography. Shot with a bit of a grain through a softening
filter to give the lights an eerie glow, care was also taken to balance rich
primary colors nicely.</P>
<P>As for the odd script, I think there may have been some big schematic
symbolism -- as if the whole movie had been an analogy for ... I don't
know -- because if there was, I sure didn't get it. And although there were
a few (very few) good lines; most were stock, predictable, or less than
memorable. I may have tolerated the tediously slow build up if the payoff
was shocking; though the theme was a good one, the real shocker is that
there was no payoff.</P>
<P>As for the hot steamy sex ... there really wasn't much of that either; just
a lot of naked women (although cruise has his shirt off as often as
possible). Perhaps since the primaries were two of the sexiest people alive
having meaningful lovemaking in the opening sequences, and because they are
married in real life -- we regular folks might find empathy concerning
infidelity temptations a strain.</P>
<P>Starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and
Frederic Raphael. Directed and Produced by Stanley Kubrick at Warner
Brothers. Rated R.</P>
