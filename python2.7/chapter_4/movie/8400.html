<PRE>Con-Air         A Film Review By Jesse A. Kaplan</PRE>
<P>Cast:  Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Steve Bushemi, Ving
Rhames, Colin Meamy and a bunch of no-name Cons
Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer
Directed by Simon West</P>
<P>Is this the sequal to THE ROCK?  Thats what I was wondering as I first
saw the trailers for this movie.  I mean, Jerry Bruckheimer, the mad
producer and Nicholas Cage action star.  Apparently thats what he wants
us to believe.  Segal, Ford, Stallone, Willis are all getting older so
why not a new one.  Well, I don't know if Cage can be that guy.  With
CON AIR, he comes off looking like a dirty old redneck who is trapped in
one of his earlier films, RAISING ARIZONA.</P>
<P>Cage (THE ROCK, LEAVING LAS VEGAS) stars as Cameron Poe, an imprisoned
man going home to his family after eight years in the big house.  You
see, Poe is one of those Movie heroes who is perfect in every regard.
He was in jail because he defended his wife from some thugs and
accidentally killed a man.  On his way home, aboard a plane, The
Prisoners of whom he was travveling with take control of the plane and
he is forced to react back.
        The Cons are lead by Cyrus "The Virus", a man so deadly he has
diseases named after him.  I'm not sure hwy all the prisenors started
listening to him aboard the plane, I could actully smell the bad breath
from the auidence.  Anyway, they take over the plane and Cage is a good
guy up there who must stop them.
        On the ground, FBI agent Vince Larken (John Cusack, CITY HALL,
GROSSE POINT BLANK) is trying to salvage the plane.  While another fat
guy agent (Colin Meamy) wants to blow up the plane.
        What to say about CON AIR?  You know exactly whats going to
happen the whole way.  This is a predictible noisy thriller.  Where THE
ROCK had great acting, an exciting plot and great editing, CON AIR has
neither.  Malkovich is not convincing nor Cage.  Cusack gives one of the
few good performances in this flim.  Another good one goes to Steve
Bushemi (PULP FICTION, FARGO), whom I always like, as a Hanibal Lecter
charachter.  He gets all the best lines.
        CON AIR has some good scenes no doubt, but the main reason it
falls is beacuse you have seen it all before.  Forget this film and go
see AIR FORCE ONE for some real terror in the skies.
        For some good laughs, decent action and John Cusack's
performance, I give this film **1/2.  It's Rated R for graphic language
and violence.</P>
<P><HR>**** = A must see film. Ex.  Starwars, Air Force One
  *** = Good show. Look for it.  Ex. Con Air, The Lost WOrld
    ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. Ex.  Speed 2, The Devil's Own</P>
<PRE>      * = Poor show. Don't waste your money.  Ex. 8 Head's in a
dufflebag
      0 = Totally and painfully unbearable picture. Ex. Congo, Batman
and Robin</PRE>
