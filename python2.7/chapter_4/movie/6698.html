<PRE>                            OLIVER AND COMPANY
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1997 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>(1988) ** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        A year before Disney began their streak of high-quality 
animated films like THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE 
BEAST and THE LION KING, out came OLIVER AND COMPANY, 
which lives in infamy as one of the most mediocre cartoon movies 
ever. As with the vast majority of Disney cartoons, this is based 
on a classic of literature, Charles Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. Also in 
the Disney tradition, this features talking animals in all the major 
parts.</P>
<P>        OLIVER AND COMPANY takes place in present day 
New York, Oliver being a cute orange kitten with the voice of Joey 
Lawrence. Abandoned and homeless, he meets up with the dog 
Dodger (voice of Billy Joel -- yes, you read me correctly) to steal 
some hot dogs. That's right, hot hot dogs. Dodger doublecrosses 
Oliver, saying something like "only the good die young," and runs 
off with the hot dogs. Cue the cute chase scene and a song from 
Dodger.</P>
<P>        The two end up in the headquarters of Dodger's two-bit 
thievery gang, which consists of a bunch of dogs, including a fiesty 
Chihuahua voiced by Cheech Marin. They live with one of the token 
humans in the film, Fagin, a low-life who has three days to pay off 
the evil Mr. Sykes. That means Oliver and the dogs have to work 
extra hard to rob the New York citizens blind, in that cute, musical 
Disney way, of course.</P>
<P>        One of their scams involves having the English bulldog in 
the gang pretend to get hit by a car while Chihuahua Cheech makes 
off with the car radio. This time, it's a limo with a cute little rich
girl 
in it, and Oliver gets left behind in the limo. The cute little girl falls</P>
<P>in love with the cute little kitty and takes it home to the mansion, 
where the egomaniacal French poodle is displaced from her position 
as favorite pet. So she conspires to get rid of Oliver at the same time 
the other dogs conspire to break in and rescue Oliver.</P>
<P>        The cartoon goes on after that, not too much longer after 
that, mind you. It's only 72 minutes long, but that's one of the more 
attractive selling points. The movie is short on plot and a little too 
long on the songs. "Under the Sea" and "Hakuna Matata" they ain't, 
even if the Piano Man is at the helm of most of them. There's no real 
reason to seek this one out unless you've already grown sick of every 
other Disney animated classic. It's no accident that OLIVER AND 
COMPANY took eight years to be released on video.</P>
