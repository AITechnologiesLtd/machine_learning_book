<PRE>LETHAL WEAPON 4
RATING:  7 / 10 --> Good movie</PRE>
<P>After swallowing a $25-million paycheck for this movie, Mel Gibson
returns as the ever-lovable cop-on-the-edge Riggs in the fourth
installment of this popular series. This one sees the addition of the
hot comic of the moment, Chris Rock, as well as a script written by
Channing Gibson, and a fourth-time around directing effort by the
ever-reliable Richard Donner.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Riggs and Murtaugh uncover a slavery importation business established
by the Asian Triad. They are bent on terminating this activity, and
predictably, infiltrate and harass the Chinese bad guys, while managing
to support their loved ones (Lorna in Riggs' case, and Murtaugh's
daughter in Murtaugh's) during their pregnancies. </P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Fun stuff! This sequel can be considered the funniest of them all,
while still remaining faithful to the action genre which it regenerated
back in the late-80's. All of the familiar faces are back with more of
their infamous wisecracks and loveable idiosyncrasies, while a couple
of new faces, add some needed spice to the ol' recipe. One of the
newest spices, who is playing the ultimate bad guy in this film, is Jet
Li, the latest in the crop of martial arts exports from Asia (see
Jackie "I can't get this smile of my face" Chan, and Chow Yun Fat). Jet
kicks some major ass in this movie, adds some needed intensity to some
otherwise predictable and light suspense sequences, and certainly shows
more potential than either one of the previously mentioned martial
artists in regards to his acting and chop-chop abilities.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast was adequate, with standout performances by Chris
Rock as the funny, new cop on the block, and some funny scenes with Joe
Pesci (although he did get on my nerves at times...I think he might've
overdid this role a bit). Gibson and Glover continue their decent work
as the good buddy cop guys, while Rene Russo is pretty much wasted in
this film, and wears too much make-up.</P>
<P>The plot is very thin in this movie, but the film never gets boring.
There is always something funny or action-packed going on, and despite
the lack of any extremely suspenseful moments (the resolution of the
plot is one of the worst that I have ever seen...), the movie does keep
you interested at all times (especially if you've been a fan of its
prequels), and certainly does make for an excellent conclusion to this
fine series. The martial arts sequences with Jet Li are amazing to
watch, and so is the one long car chase scene in this film, which is a
credit to director Donner, who has actually been able to innovate this
sequence despite its extreme overuse in many recent action films.
Overall, this movie works on most fronts, has some funny and
action-packed scenes, and does deliver a pretty neat bad guy in Jet Li.
So turn off the brain, warm up them nachos, and get ready for a fun
time at the movies!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
Mel Gibson was born in New York, and moved to Australia at the age of
12. He stands 5'9, has been married to the same woman since 1980, and
has sired six children with her. Her name is Robyn Moore, and she is a
former dental nurse. Mel is also a devout, traditional Catholic, who
once shared a room with fellow actor Geoffrey Rush in College. Mel took
up acting only because his sister submitted an application behind his
back. The night before the audition, he got into a fight, and got his
face badly beaten. That accident won him the role.
Richard Donner's real name is Richard D. Schwartzberg, and was born in
NY, New York. He has also directed two other Mel Gibson movies (besides
the three previous LETHAL WEAPON films), CONSPIRACY THEORY (5/10) and
MAVERICK (6.5/10), as well as SUPERMAN (8/10), uncredited for SUPERMAN
2, and credited for THE OMEN.
Jet Li's real name is Lian Ji Li. He was born on the 26th of April,
1963, in Beijing, China. He started training at the Beijing wushu
academy at age nine (Wushu is China's national sport, largely a
performance version of various martial art styles), and won five gold
medals in the Chinese championships. His first when he was only 11. In
his teens, he was already a national coach, and before he was 20, he
had starred in his first movie: SHAOLIN TEMPLE (Shao Lin Si), which
started the 1980's kung-fu boom in mainland China. He then relocated to
Hong Kong, and became one of the biggest stars of the early 1990's
kung-fu boom.</P>
