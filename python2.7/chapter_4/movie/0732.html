                         TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
                       A film review by David M. Jones
                        Copyright 1990 David M. Jones</PRE>
<P>     This is a somewhat rambling review of the TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
movie.  Be warned that though there are no particularly grievous spoilers in
this article, there may be enough to remove a little of the joy of seeing the
movie from an unspoiled perspective.  The most important thing to learn from
this article is that the movie is well worth seeing, at least if you like the
comic book.  Now that you know that, maybe you want to hit 'n' now.</P>
<P>     Last night I was privileged to attend the world premiere of TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES, hosted by MIT's Lecture Series Committee.  I was tempted, upon
getting out of the movie at about 2:45 AM, to rush directly to my terminal and
send a review off, but luckily the call of my bed was too great, so I went home
to sleep instead, I say "luckily" because this extra time has allowed me to
give the movie the consideration it deserves.  Here, then, are some of my
impressions of the movie.  I've tried to keep spoilers to a minimum, and to
warn you when they are coming.  However, I haven't felt the need to be too
diligent in this regard, since anyone familiar with the comic books won't find
the plot too surprising.</P>
<P>     Overall, I was quite impressed with the movie.  I found it to be a
reasonably faithful adaptation of the comic book.  In particular, they left the
characters largely intact.  Raphael's uncontrolled rage and loner tendencies,
Leonardo's leadership (particularly his concern for the team as a team, as well
as individuals), and Casey's sometimes warped quixotism are all apparent in the
movie.  There are differences, of course.  April is reworked into a gutsy and
intelligent investigative reporter, but I can't help but think the changes are
for the better.  Then, too, I didn't get much of a sense of Micheangelo and
Donatello as individuals.  In fact, now that I think of it, I'd say their main
function was as comic relief to offset the heavier interaction between the
Raphael-Leonardo and April-Casey pairs.  For example, with one questionable
exception, there is no indication of Donatello's considerable technical
prowess.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, one character doesn't come off very well at all, namely
Splinter.  The movie industry has made yet another attempt to portray
"inscrutable oriental wisdom," and they've failed yet again.  In fact, I'm
tempted to say that Splinter comes across as a bit of a buffoon.  Part of this
was due to technical failings.  For example, the only parts of the movie I can
remember cringing at were the flashback scenes describing Splinter's life with
his Master and his discovery of the turtles.  The stop-action animation (if
that's the term I want) was ill-suited to the ostensibly serious tone of
Splinter's narrative.  In particular, the scenes showing him learning the
martial arts by mimicking his master from his cage were absurd.  All in all,
the movie would be improved if these scenes were replaced by straight narrative
without the visual aides.  However, a bigger part of the problem was the
approach they took to the character.  Two symptoms of the problem come to mind:
(1) Splinter had a goatee, and (2) he spoke with a stereotypical Japanese
accent.  Given the inherent problems in making a believable character out of a
giant talking rat who is also a martial arts master, I think that including
these particular cliches was a lamentable mistake.  Among other things, this
approach made his character far too rigid and inflexible.  But enough of that.
Let's move to a more positive note.</P>
<P>     The turtle costumes were quite satisfactory (even if the faces,
particularly the mouths, did remind me a little too strongly of Kermit the Frog
occasionally :-)).  The costumes weren't so unwieldy as to interfere with the
movement of the actors.  (In fact, the only thing I can remember being
distracted by is that the shell on their stomachs seemed too flexible.  I
distinctly saw it bend once or twice.)  Nor were they so garish as to distract
the eye from the movie.  In short, if you can suspend your disbelief enough to
accept the presence of the turtles in the comic books, you shouldn't have any
trouble accepting them in the movie.</P>
<P>     I was quite impressed with the screenplay.  They managed to rearrange the
plot without doing gratuitous damage to the the comic book.  In fact, if
anything, I'd say the movie is more tightly plotted than the comic book.  Also
noteworthy is the fact that many scenes are lifted from the book with
practically no change.  However, there were major changes in the arrangements
of the scenes.  If anyone is interested in knowing what some of them are, drop
me a line.</P>
<P>     One thing that might bother purists is that it is apparent that the
violence of the book has been toned down considerably, probably in order to
appeal to younger viewers.  For example, Splinter's master does not kill his
rival in love; instead, he and his lover flee to America, where they are hunted
down and killed by the rival himself.  (Thus, Shredder is the rival himself,
not the rival's younger brother.)  Similarly, Splinter does not send the
Turtles to kill Shredder, as he does in the book.  I suspect that both of these
changes were made to avoid sticky questions about the morality of Splinter, the
Turtles, and Splinter's master, and to keep the overall tone of the movie
light.  Similarly, the fight scenes lacked the intensity of the book.  There
was no blood dripping off sais in this movie.  (Incidentally, I'll let someone
else comment on the authenticity of the fight scenes.  I'm not qualified to
judge.)</P>
<P>     Purists might also be concerned about the portrayal of the Turtles.  Yes,
there is one scene where one of the Turtles is riding a skateboard.  And yes,
they are obsessed with pizza.  However, neither of these things is obnoxiously
handled.  A more serious flaw is the attitude they take toward Splinter and the
art of the ninja in general.  I can't speak for the TMNT cartoon or for the
"Adventures of the TMNT," but I feel confident in stating that the Turtles I am
familiar with would not wander off to order a pizza while Splinter was
attempting to teach them.  I'm also not entirely satisfied with their behavior
during the fights.  They're too cocky, too showy, not grim enough.  I suspect
this was also intended to keep the mood of the movie from getting too heavy.
However, on the whole these are the same wise-cracking adolescents, stewed in
the popular culture of the day, that I know from the books.  I must admit that
their voices were a little higher that I had expected, but then again, they are
supposed to be 15 years old.  (I'm going to gloss over the difficulties
involved in such analogies between the TMNT and human adolescents.)</P>
<P>     So, in summary, I was impressed by the movie.  The failings I've noted
occupy a relatively small amount of screen time and should do little to
interfere with your enjoyment of the movie.  This is a faithful adaptation of
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, a well-done movie, and all-in-all a great way
to spend a couple of hours.  Most importantly, this is *not* a movie aimed only
at 5-year-olds.  If you enjoyed the comic book, you should enjoy the movie.</P>
