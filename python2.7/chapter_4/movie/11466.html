Titanic  (1997) 194 min. </PRE>
<P>It's a safe bet that you have by now seen TITANIC.  Going by the size
of attendances it would seem that everyone is seeing it.  Of course,
the size of those attendances is probably one reason why many people
have been purposefully avoiding it.  Understandable, but that is not
to say the immediate cinema experience is not without its own quirky
merits.  Try going when the tickets are half price, for example.  I
did.  In the school holidays.  If the mob of passengers that was
trying to get to the lifeboats was half as big as the throng trying to
get into the cinema then my appreciation of what the survivors of the
Titanic went through was well assured.  We sat in the queue for an
hour and a half, which would have been enough time to see another
movie, and the doors opened to admit the rush.  It didn't end there,
because once inside the cinema our vicarious suffering was augmented
further by the incessant sub-polar breeze of the air conditioning
system, thus ensuring that by the third hour our empathy for the
passengers floating in the Atlantic was at a state approaching
Nirvana.  By the time the credits rolled I had barely enough
circulation left to get out before Celine Dion started singing.</P>
<P>So, how good is TITANIC?  Firstly, it comes as no surprise that
director James Cameron came to choose it as a project.  A glance at
his earlier work will tell you why.  This man makes the bluest looking
movies around.  THE ABYSS, ALIENS, THE TERMINATOR.  If his next film
isn't set in the North Pole I'll eat my hat.  Secondly, if you're
going to see this movie, then it has to be in a cinema.  If you'd
rather wait for the video release, then you might as well stick a toy
boat in the bath and watch that instead.  In the spirit of the old
Hollywood epics, TITANIC - no tautology intended - is big.</P>
<P>Cameron is to be applauded for resuscitating the Hollywood epic, but
what does he have to offer that's new?  I'd like to think it was more
than a budget blowout on huge-scale models and state-of-the-art
special effects.  This story, after all, has been told many times
before.  His film is definitely more engaging than the turgid 1953
TITANIC with Clifton Webb (after 45 minutes I was rooting for the
iceberg) but doesn't have the emotional edge of the classic A NIGHT TO
REMEMBER.  In fact, it's due to the latter that Cameron's TITANIC
failed to hit me at gut level.  I'd already seen the class divisions,
the injustice, the incompetence, the unlucky coincidences.  I was more
interested, this time around, to see how Cameron would transport me to
the scene of the disaster; how he would make me empathise with that
tremendous sense of loss and fear.</P>
<P>But instead, he backs off.  All the manipulative moments you would
expect never arrive: the panic for the lifeboats, the noble
self-sacrifices, the sudden topsy-turvy devaluation and re-evaluation
of human lives.  When I saw two silky Afghan hounds boarding the ship
early on I filed the scene away for later reference: Future Camera
Shot - Dogs Struggling Helpless and Bewildered in the Water.  A
sympathy-grabbing moment for sure.  He doesn't let it happen.  Cameron
is more interested in recreating the disaster, not reliving it, so
distils the humanity of the story into two characters.  You've seen
the promos so you know the rest - TITANIC is a love story between
third-class Leonardo DiCaprio and upper-class Kate Winslet.  And it
would not be a proper love story if it were not a triangle, which is
where Billy Zane comes in.  We know straight away that Zane is
completely wrong for Winslet (let's face it, after DEAD CALM who's
ever going to trust this guy on a boat again?) but it takes two hours
of screen time before he gets the message, by which time the ship is
sinking already, and the real reason we all went to see the movie
finally gets underway.  But even here the tragedy of the event is
absent - the story merely shifts from a romance on a floating ship to
an adventure on a sinking ship, and Cameron's throwaway moments of
comic relief prevent the terror from properly crystallising.</P>
<P>The sinking itself is certainly a spectacle, and you can see where all
the money went, but it seems that the whole thing is just too big for
Cameron to really enjoy himself with.  He isn't directing so much as
orchestrating, and even though he's tipped to win an Oscar for TITANIC
it's annoying that it doesn't have the same flair of his other films. 
A lot of TITANIC isn't original, and the ending, which has been a
staple of sentimental finales since the silent days of THE THREE
MUSKETEERS, is terribly cliched.  But TITANIC is still well worth your
time.  For three hours running time it has a terrific sense of pace,
and there is at least one moment that captures the essence of the
disaster perfectly: the camera switches its viewpoint to that of the
survivors in the lifeboats, watching the now nearly-vertical Titanic
from afar with incredulous horror.  By itself, this moment would be
nothing.  But placed as it is, amid an ocean of 194 minutes of film,
those few seconds become the only connection Cameron needs to make. 
It works because it taps into the one level on which we moviegoers can
truly empathise: not as participants in a tragedy, but rather as
observers of that tragedy.</P>
