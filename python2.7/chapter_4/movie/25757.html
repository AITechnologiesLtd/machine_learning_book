<PRE>STEAL THIS MOVIE!
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>STEAL THIS MOVIE! tells the story of the famous Chicago 7 radical, Abbie 
Hoffman.  (The title is guaranteed to strike the same terror in the 
hearts of video store owners when the movie makes its way to video that 
Abbie Hoffman's book, "Steal This Book!" did years ago for bookstore 
owners.)  The unabashedly one-sided movie by director Robert Greenwald, 
a friend of Abbie and Anita Hoffman, is a lucid and intriguing tale of 
perhaps the most famous of the Vietnam War protestors.  Freed from any 
pretense of objectivity, the fast-paced movie creates a flattering story 
as the late Abbie Hoffman might himself have told.</P>
<P>As the movie starts in 1977, a highly paranoid Abbie has been hiding 
underground for 5 years.  "5 years, 17 cities, 10 jobs," is how Abbie 
describes it to David Glenn (Alan Van Sprang), a reporter who promises 
to tell his story without revealing his whereabouts.  We quickly 
flashback to Abbie's heydays, when the world was his stage and his 
outrageous behavior was his not-so-secret weapon to popularize his 
causes.  "Dull is deadly", Abbie explains as the rationale for his 
outlandish theatrics.</P>
<P>Vincent D'Onofrio turns in an energetic and endearing performance as the 
charismatic, smart Abbie Hoffman, a self-described "long-haired, 
revolutionary freak."  We witness Abbie enjoying life, family and sex.  
Janeane Garofalo, as his wife Anita, and Jeanne Tripplehorn, as his 
lover and friend Johanna Lawrenson, play the women in his life.</P>
<P>The strong supporting cast includes Donal Logue, who appears in every 
other movie this summer and in various sizes from his Pillsbury Dough 
Boy in THE TAO OF STEVE to his more modest size this time as Stew 
Albert, Abbie's best friend.  Kevin Pollak does a nice turn as Gerry 
Lefcourt, Abbie's savvy and tolerant lawyer.  Representing Abbie, who 
turned his most famous trial into a ludicrous circus, was a supreme 
challenge for a lawyer.</P>
<P>Bruce Graham's bright script, based on books by Abbie and Anita Hoffman 
and by Marty Jezer, is funny and insightful.  "If you don't like Abbie's 
mood, wait a minute," Anita tells Johanna about Abbie, who was 
eventually diagnosed as a manic-depressive.</P>
<P>Ever the philosopher, Abbie's mouth is a shotgun of ideas.  "The problem 
with liberals is that they see all sides to every argument, which leads 
to paralysis," he claims.  "You aren't fighting the [Vietnam] war to 
save democracy," he says.  "You're fighting this war to save Wall 
Street."</P>
<P>The movie does a marvelous job of authentically capturing the look and 
mood of the period.  And the old anti-war songs really rock.</P>
<P>The movie dichotomizes the people in Abbie's life into either friends or 
enemies, with the former being the world's good guys and the latter 
being the bad.  The police, especially the FBI, are uniformly depicted 
as little better than the Gestapo.  Too often, films with strong 
political agendas present us with false alternatives rather than 
admitting that they are really only telling one side of the argument.  
STEAL THIS MOVIE! works precisely because it stays strictly true to its 
opinions.  You may not subscribe to them, but you'll understand them 
much better after seeing the picture.  And you'll gain fascinating 
insights into the life of someone you may have never even cared about 
before.  But, most of all, you'll have a high old time while reliving 
one of our nation's more turbulent eras.</P>
<P>STEAL THIS MOVIE! runs a lively 1:41.  It is rated R for language, drug 
content and some nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
