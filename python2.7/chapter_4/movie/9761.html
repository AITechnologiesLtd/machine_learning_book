<P>The Plot:  A respected black doctor is loved by his
family in early sixties rural Louisiana.
The reason for the film: Its always for money, but
this one is to fleece money from blacks.  Its a black
film with a black cast.</P>
<P>Instead of constantly churning out ghetto films and
rappers in the hood films, Hollywood has decided to
create a number of black film genres.  The trouble
is, the budgets aren't as big as white mainstream pictures.</P>
<P>Eve's Bayou is in this category.  An indy film for discerning
black audiences?  Don't you believe it.  This film is stupid.
Its biggest mistake is leaving the telling of the story to the black
doctor's children. The doctor, played by Samuel L Jackson, is a
womanizer and both his children know it.  The MD has a sister
in law whose three husbands have all died.  These details are
mainly just strewn about the screenplay at odd times.  Dianhan
Carroll plays a character role as a voodoo mistress.   A "maybe"
case of incest is tossed into the mix toward the end.  And finally
there is a jealousy inflamed murder and a posthumous "explanation"
of the incest, as the camera begins to dolly out and the sun begins
to set.  Its nice scenery and nice dresses for all the 
members of the doctor's house.  I think the intention was to create
a normal story of upper middle class family life, only with blacks
this time.  It was too slow and relied too much on flashbacks for
its dramatic scenes.  </P>
<P>Oh, and one curious thing.  Every woman living in the doctor's
household had pierced ears but not one wore earrings in the film.</P>
