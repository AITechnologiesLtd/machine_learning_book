<PRE>SNAKE EYES (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Steve Kong
Edited by Cher Johnson

<P>For the last two weeks, on the drive to work, I passed a Snake Eyes
billboard. There's a large picture of Nicolas Cage and in big letters below
"Cage Snake Eyes." That is some good advice from a studio trying to promote
this film.</P>
<P>Detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is a guy who is loud and obnoxious.
He's a guy who wants everyone's attention, and during the rainy night in
Snake Eyes, he'll get it. Santoro is attending a big boxing match at a
large Atlantic City casino with his longtime friend Major Kevin Dunn (Gary
Sinise). Dunn is there providing protective services for the Secretary of
Defense.</P>
<P>During the fight, the Secretary is assassinated. All hell breaks loose and
Santoro heads up the investigation, finding that there might be a
conspiracy. He spends his time chasing after a woman in a blonde wig and
another woman in a red wig. He thinks that there are others involved in the
conspiracy, and since this is Hollywood, he's right.</P>
<P>If you understood the conspiracy in Mission: Impossible, you will probably
understand the conspiracy in Snake Eyes. I didn't even bother with trying
to understand why the Secretary was killed; I just looked at the wonderful
camera work by cinematographer Stephen H. Burum.</P>
<P>After being engrossed by the whodunit of last week's The Negotiator, I was
disappointed that the head of the conspiracy is revealed so quickly in
Snake Eyes. Writer David Koepp (Men in Black, Lost World, Mission:
Impossible) pens the film in an inventive manner, but the weak point of the
script remains; we get to find out who the bad guy is too quickly. </P>
<P>But that is not the weakest point of the film; it has one of the worst
endings I've ever seen. It is plain awful and so unbelievable that I felt
cheated after sitting in the theatre for two hours.</P>
<P>However, the first 90 minutes of Snake Eyes is very interesting. The way
that DePalma shows us the story from different points of view is
entertaining. Just keep in mind that one of these points of view is that of
the killer and is the wrench thrown into the well-oiled machine -- a view
point that serves only to confuse an already confused audience.</P>
<P>DePalma also shows off with Snake Eyes. Some of the camera movements,
angles, and setups in Snake Eyes are beyond belief. This includes the long
opening sequence. The sequence follows Nicolas Cage for about 15 minutes
and seems to be uncut, though there might be one or two cuts during some
swish-pans. This opening left me saying, "Wow, now that was cool!" Snake
Eyes should be a film shown during cinematography classes; there are quite
a few setups that make for good studying.</P>
<P>As for acting, no one does anything new. Nicolas Cage revives his Castor
Troy from Face/Off and melts in some of his Cameron Poe from Con Air for
his part as Rick Santoro. He's loud, brash, and too over-the-top to be
enjoyable. His character has a sudden attack of conscience during the film
that doesn't ring true. The other lead actor, Gary Sinise, has played this
type of part enough to be typecast. Sinise is awful in Snake Eyes; he needs
to find a different type of role to play.</P>
<P>Snake Eyes is the worst of bad movies it starts off really well, builds up
a lot of good story, then hits you with an improbable and laughable ending.
Skip Snake Eyes in the theatres. As the billboard says, the movie Snake
Eyes should be caged. No one needs this kind of disappointment. I wonder
who let it out of the cage.</P>
