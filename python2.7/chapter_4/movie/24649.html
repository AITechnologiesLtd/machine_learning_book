 Dinosaur (2000) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Featuring the vocal talents of
D.B. Sweeney, Ossie Davis, Alfre Woodard, Max Casella, Hayden Panettier,
Julianna Margulies, Joan Plowrightand Della Reese</P>
<P> Disney's latest  creation, "Dinosaur," is a magical meld of digitally
enhanced live-action photography, special effects and computer animated
wonder.</P>
<P> Though a bit ragged on the technical side, the film showcases a simple
story with a moral that the younger members of the audience can
understand and appreciate, plus some heroic and amusing characters with
whom they can relate.</P>
<P> The story is reminiscent of the animated "Land Before Time" of several
years ago: A group of dinosaurs seek a legendary verdant valley
containing enough food and water to sustain them.</P>
<P> "Dinosaur" follows the adventures of an Iguanodon named Aladar (voiced
by D.B. Sweeney) who is separated from his own species as a hatchling
and adopted by a tribe of Lemurs.</P>
<P> Years later, a catastrophic event forces the family to flee and join up
with a herd of dinosaurs searching for a safe nesting ground.</P>
<P> In a sense, the movie is anti-Darwinian. Its message that survival of
the fittest is a brutal misconception, while standing together and
cooperation - the mighty protecting the weak - makes for a more viable
and stronger community, is a lesson the children will easily grasp.</P>
<P> Moreso than the special effects, it is the characters who drive
"Dinosaur."</P>
<P> Besides Aladar, there is his Lemur parents, Yar (Ossie Davis) and Plio
(Alfre Woodard); his best pal, Zini (Max Casella); sister, Suri (Hayden
Panettiere); and the friends they make on the trek, Neera (Julianna
Margulies), another Iguanodon; Baylene (Joan Plowright), an elderly,
dignified Brachiosuar; and Eema (Della Reese), a gruff, but lovable
Styrachosaur.</P>
<P> The movie's real stars, though, are the various technicians who
recreated the world of 65 million years ago. Though the effects are
sometimes dark and murky, the Disney team has created such
fully-developed creatures, plus some beautiful vistas that you tend to
gloss over the rough spots.</P>
<P> Aided by a rousing score by James Newton Howard, which contains echoes
of a previous Disney winner, "The Lion King," "Dinosaur" is a movie that
will engross the younger set.</P>
<P> One concession I really appreciated is that none of the dinosaurs nor
Lemurs break into song and dance. That would have been a bit too much,
even for an animated feature.</P>
<P> Though it contains some violence, "Dinosaur" is basically a
good-hearted saga, and at a little under 90 minutes, it will hold the
attention of the youngest viewer.</P>
<P> "Dinosaur" is basically a family movie. Adults will find it simplistic,
but they will enjoy it if they see it with their children. And an
entertaining movie with a moral is always a good bet for a family
outing.</P>
<P> "Dinosaur" is not as colorful as "Tarzan," nor does it pack the
emotional wallop of "The Lion King, "but it does provide breathtaking
scenery, the latest in special effects and lovable characters.</P>
<P> You can't lose with this combination.</P>
