<P>     We're going to have to create a new designation for Errol Morris,
because "documentary filmmaker" just doesn't seem to cut it. Yes, Morris'
subjects have all been real-life people in films like THE THIN BLUE LINE,
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME and FAST, CHEAP & OUT OF CONTROL. He has also
opted to up the ante for what a non-fiction film can be, staging visually
compelling vignettes or using re-creations to impose his artistic vision
on the story he's trying to tell. It's no wonder Morris' films have
consistently been overlooked by the more tradition-bound documentarians of
the Motion Picture Academy. Call him a maker of non-fiction films if you
must ... or simply a director.</P>
<P>     With MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER, JR., Errol
Morris has given us another reason to toss out the term "documentary
filmmaker" -- as striking as the film is, it sometimes feels a bit thin on
background detail. Morris' latest subject is another man with a unique
obsessive interest: Fred A. Leuchter, Jr., a Massachusetts-based execution
technology enthusiast. After becoming aware of the horrendous quality of
most capital punishment equipment, Leuchter became an expert in designing
more effectvie and humane electric chairs, lethal injection machines and
gas chambers for states' prison systems. His expertise in this field led
him down a life-changing road when he was asked to be a witness in the
defense of Ernst Zundel, a revisionist historian charged in Canada with
disseminating propaganda denying the truth of the Holocaust. After
visiting the ruins of the Nazi camps at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek,
Leuchter concludes that they could not have included gas chambers. While
his "Leuchter Report" was not admitted at the trial, it has become one of
the most widely disseminated pieces of "evidence" for those who claim
there was no Holocaust.</P>
<P>     Leuchter's involvement in the 1988 Zundel trial begins a downward
spiral in his career, as states terminate contracts and Holocaust
remembrance groups assail the science in his report (chemist James Roth,
who performed the "Leuchter Report" tests, supports the contention that
Leuchter's tests were miserably designed). While activists argue that
Leuchter's work for revisionist groups marks him an anti-Semite, Morris
paints a slightly different picture. Leuchter becomes a vivid character in
the film, a "mouse of a man" (in Zundel's words) with a Boston Brahmin
accent and an unshakeable conviction that he is right. He comes off as a
unique sort of egotist, a man so used to playing God in his manufacture of
instruments of death that infallibility becomes part of his self-image.</P>
<P>     It would be a helpful bit of information in the formation of that
picture for us to know that Leuchter's academic background had nothing to
do with engineering or chemistry, but was in fact in history. Though
Leuchter does discuss a move by the state of Massachusetts to prosecute
him as an unlicensed engineer late in the film, his background would seem
to be much more important than the casual inclusion Morris gives it. In
fact, MR. DEATH leaves much about Leuchter only peripherally explored: his
relationship with his wife of only a few months (who speaks but does not
appear on screen); his reactions to the fame/infamy inspired by the
"Leuchter Report;" his strangely superstitious response to a mysterious
image in a photo of one of his electric chairs. Morris lets Leuchter talk
about himself for a very long time, but he doesn't probe. In this case,
the approach leaves holes in the story.</P>
<P>     That doesn't make MR. DEATH a failure as a film. Indeed, a
less-than-perfect Errol Morris documentary is still infinitely more
watchable than most conventional documentaries. Some viewers may find his
stylized renderings of his subject -- Leuchter the coffee addict
reflected in a cup of coffee; Leuchter filmed between flashing electrodes
like a modern Dr. Frankenstein -- distracting or inappropriate. Others
will find them part of Morris' ongoing reinvention of the form. It is
surprising, however, that this may be the first Morris' documentary that's
more interesting as a cinematic experience than it is as a learning
experience. As a documentarian, Morris is a singular artist. In Fred
Leuchter, he's left an enigmatic unfinished portrait.</P>
