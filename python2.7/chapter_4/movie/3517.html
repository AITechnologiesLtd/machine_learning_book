<PRE>                                  THE CURE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1995 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>     In reviewing the film, I must preface it with the statement that I
believe AIDS is a plague about which I feel very strongly.  So when I
say that I felt the film should have been entitled, THE CURE (OR HUCK
FINN HAS AIDS) you will be aware that I am not being funny about AIDS
but rather about the film.</P>
<P>     Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) is an eleven-year-old who has contracted
AIDS during a blood transfusion.  All the kids shun him him and many
call him "homo."  It seemed to me that how he caught the AIDS could
have been explained by Linda, (Dexter's mother, Annabella Sciorra) and
that would have stopped the harassing but of course, then there would
not have been a film.</P>
<P>     Dexter does find a sympathetic friend, Erik (Brad Renfro), also
eleven years old. When he hears of a "cure" down south the two friends
take off on a raft on the Mississippi (a la Huck Finn) and go seek the
doctor who is claiming he has a cure.  That part of the film and the
people they encounter reminded me of Mark Twain's masterpiece.</P>
<P>     Unlike the excellent LORENZO'S OIL, with the passionate Susan
Sarandon and Nick Nolte fighting the doctors, doing there own research
and keeping the film alive and us on edge, this fails on all counts.
Well intentioned, certainly.  Box office?  I doubt it.  Too sad and not
enough excitement.</P>
<PRE>Directed by Peter Horton.</PRE>
