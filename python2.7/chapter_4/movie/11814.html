<P>Now that the "evil empire" of the USSR has been emasculated, writers
have had to find new villains. In Simple Simon, author Ryne Douglas
Peardon,  did not have to look beyond our own back yard.  Here the
villain is Lt. Colonel Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) a high-up
official in the covert, secretive NSA, (National Security Agency)
who upon discovering that a top secret code had been broken by a
10-year-old kid, is out to get him even if it means killing him.</P>
<P> The kid is Simon, (Miko Hughes) an autistic savant.   In an attempt
to find him, his parents are killed by NSA agents.    Art Jeffries
(Bruce Willis) is an FBI man who has been made a scapegoat in an
earlier episode, is relegated to routine work.   That suddenly
blossoms into something big when he discovers Simon and the 2
murdered parents. He decides to take care of Simon and protect him
from the NSA.</P>
<P> This may have sounded exciting on paper but Bruce Willis and his
monotone voice and equally mono-expression is hardly the one to
bring you to the edge of your seat.    While actor Miko Hughes was
allowed to witness autistic children, the better to portray them,
the director allowed him to do little more than roll his eyes upward
and to the side.  That soon became boring even if in real life that
is how some autistic children behave.   This is a movie; it needs
more than that.   Much more.   Further, very little was shown that
would demonstrate he was a savant.</P>
<P> The film, in addition, is very violent, with the F word tossed about
carelessly. I lost count of the number of bullets fired but it must
have been well into the  hundreds.   Very gory.   But the worst sin
is that it was boring.</P>
<P> Alec Baldwin has a smallish role until the last scenes.  Tommy B
Jordan (Chi McBride) is the only government person who is a friend
of Jeffries.   McBride comes across as ready to take on some meatier
roles.</P>
