<P>
 A KNIGHT'S TALE (2001) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Heath Ledger, Mark
Addy, Rufus Sewell, Paul Bettany, Shannyn Sossamon, Alan Tudyk and Laura
Fraser. Music by Carter Burwell. Written, produced and directed by Brian
Helgeland. PG-13.</P>
<P> You are immediately jarred at the outset of A Knightís Tale when a
contestant in a jousting tournament rides onto the field, the soundtrack
begins blaring ìWe Will Rock Youî and the audience claps along to the
beat.
What the heck is going on?
 Perhaps the filmís writer-producer-director, Brian Helgeland (an
Oscar-winner for his L.A. Confidential script), can explain: ìWe wanted
to create a period piece that stayed fair to the period but felt
contemporary. ... For a movie to work, the audience has to be invited
in. They can get pushed away if overwhelmed by period costumes, obscure
speech and antique music. ... Our goal was to create a seamless bridge
between then and now.î</P>
<P> Nice sentiments, noble proposal. Unfortunately, the concept for A
Knightís Tale is more distracting than beneficial.</P>
<P> The movieís central plot is about jousting, painted by Helgeland as
sort of the XFL of the middle ages. Knights would travel from tournament
to tournament, battling each other for prizes and glory; standings were
kept; peasants would paint themselves in the colors of their favorite
knights; heralds would introduce their knights, in a manner reminiscent
of Vince McMahon revving up the crowd at a WWF match; and their would be
a tournament of tournament at which the grand champion would be crowned.</P>
<P> All this, of course, makes it difficult as to how to view A Knightís
Tale: a comedy, a spoof, a period action-adventure, a drama. Helgeland
has made it a hodge-podge of all of the aforementioned genres.</P>
<P> His story revolves around William Thatcher (Heath Ledger), squire to a
veteran knight. When his employer is found sitting under a tree dead,
William, with the help of his friends. Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan
Tudyk), puts on the knightís armor, takes his place at the joust and
wins the tournament.</P>
<P> William then decides to use the prize money to fulfill his dream of
becoming a championship jouster. Unfortunately, only knights are
permitted to joust, so William ó with the help of an unemployed writer
named Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany) ó reinvents himself as Sir Ulrich von
Lichtenstein of Gelderland and begins his climb up the tournament
ladder.</P>
<P> A Knightís Tale is a corny, fairy tale, yet somehow it exudes an
innocent and winning charm. You know, historically, itís rubbish, but so
go along just for the fun.</P>
<P> For example, you laugh when William ó along with the other knights ó
marches triumphantly into the London he left as a child and the
soundtrack blasts out Tin Lizzyís ìThe Boys Are Back in Town.î</P>
<P> This is definitely a movie not to be taken seriously. if it is
anything, A Knightís Tale is a showcase for the charisma of up-and-comer
Heath L:edger, best known for portraying Mel Gibsonís son in The Patriot
as well as for wooing Julia Stiles in Ten Things I Hate About You.</P>
<P> He has a wonderful screen presence and a very nonchalant manner. He
acts as the various occasions demands ó serious whe needed, tongue
planted in cheek when called for.</P>
<P> He is a looker who carries a fluff piece such as this with ease. It
will be interesting to see him in more demanding roles.</P>
<P> A Knightís Tale will more likely appeal to a younger audience. Medieval
scholars might as well stay home as you will wind up shouting at the
screen in frustration or rage at the historical liberties the film
takes.</P>
<P> But this is not meant as a documentary about the middle ages. A
Knightís Tale is an uneven parable about heroes, fame and self-worth.
That Helgeland tried to give it a contemporary spin is commendable. It
is too bad he was not totally successful.</P>
