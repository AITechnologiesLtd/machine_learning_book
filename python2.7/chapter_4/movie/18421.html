<PRE>                               ELECTION
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: An on-target satire and dark comedy
          about politics set around a high school student
          council election.  An award-winning teacher tries
          to make sure the school's most successful student
          does not run unopposed for council president.  The
          result is disaster for several people.  Don't be
          put off by the fact the film is about a high school
          election.  This film has some of the best writing
          of any film so far this year.  This is an
          intelligent, irritating and in its own way
          delightful comedy about politics in America.
          Rating: 8  (0 to 10), high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<P>     The time is coming for student council elections at Carver High
School. Unopposed for president is Tracy Flick (played by Reese
Witherspoon) the school's smug and snotty over-achiever.  This is the
girl who seems to be in every school club, on every school committee.
Everyone knows that she is the best and nobody tries to compete with
her.  What few people know is that she also was instrumental in the
firing of a teacher for a sexual misconduct in which she was
considerably more than a willing victim.  Jim McAllister (Matthew
Broderick) is the star teacher of the school, having won the Teacher of
the Year Award a record three years in a row.  He also was a friend of
the fired teacher. Partially because he knows that the indiscretion was
not all the teacher's fault, and partially as a lesson in democratic
principles to his students, Mr. McAllister decides to try to see if he
can whip up some competition for Tracy. The idealistic civics teacher
convinces Paul Metzler, a likeable jock sidelined by a broken leg, to
run against Tracy.  He is the exact opposite of Tracy.  Less than
bright in his studies he is nevertheless a nice person with lots of
friends.  Soon there is a surprise third counter-culture candidate
running for reasons of her own and collecting the vote of all the
disaffected of the school. This small beginning leads to chaos that
engulfs several people's lives, not the least of which is Mr.
McAllister's.</P>
<P>     ELECTION is a film that looks like it was shot in 16 millimeter
and blown up for the full sized screen.  The production values overall
seem to have been designed for economy.  About the only place it excels
is that it has a really good script.  I call that a pretty good
tradeoff.  In spite of the modest production budget co-writer and
director Alexander Payne has managed to do some things extraordinarily
well.  The lower-middle class is rarely shown in other films.
Character's homes shown in films tend to be wither upscale or on the
level of trailer parks.  Yet the housing developments with their sparse
vegetation strike a really believable note.  In fact the whole set of
inexpensive production values tend to make this film seem all the more
realistic.  Payne's only previous feature film was CITIZEN RUTH, itself
not a bad social satire.  But ELECTION shows a considerable
improvement.</P>
<P>     With the exception of the two leads, most of the cast has little
film experience, yet the acting in the film seems perfectly
professional.  Matthew Broderick seems a little young for the role of
the teacher, but that could be just because he himself seems boyish.
Reese Witherspoon may well find that this is a defining role in her
early career.  While she did not seem to bring any special talents to
her role in PLEASANTVILLE she is just perfect as the smug and totally
self-absorbed, over-achieving, Monica-Lewinsky-in-training.  ELECTION
is a satire of the caliber of Michael Ritchie's SMILE.  That puts it
miles ahead of recent entries like WAG THE DOG.  SMILE and ELECTION
would, in fact, make an excellent double feature.  I give ELECTION an8
on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
