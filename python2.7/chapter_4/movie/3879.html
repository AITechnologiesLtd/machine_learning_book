<P>     The makers of WATERWORLD, the current holder of the "most expensive 
film" title, have put a good portion of the money where the viewing 
public can see it -- on the screen.  This production, with its massive 
explosions, amazing stunts, and breathtaking visuals, is one of 
Hollywood's most lavish features to date.  All of the action takes place 
on a wide expanse of ocean, with no land in sight.  It's no easy feat 
for human actors to emulate fish. </P>
<P>     It's an unspecified date in the future.  As we're told in a quick 
voiceover intro, the polar ice caps have melted and Earth's continents 
are buried under water.  Humanity has been relegated to a tenuous 
existence on shakily-constructed floating fortress-cities.  There is no 
land, and pure water and dirt have become exceptionally valuable 
commodities.  The world is a cruel place, where brotherhood is a thing 
of the past, and anything -- or anyone -- can be sold or traded for as 
little as a sheet of paper.  Possessions, not people, are what matter. </P>
<P>     There are three kinds of survivors:  those who try to live in 
orderly societies, nomads who roam the seas in their own vessels, and 
members of an outlaw band called the "Smokers."  Headed by the larger-
than-life Deacon (Dennis Hopper), these criminals amuse themselves by 
raping and pillaging while on a quest for the mythical Dryland -- a 
paradise that no one has seen, yet everyone believes exists. </P>
<P>     The Mariner (Kevin Costner) becomes one of the Smokers' targets 
when he rescues the girl Enola (Tina Majorino) from a raid on a 
fortress-city.  She is no ordinary child -- on her back is a tattoo 
which supposedly identifies the location of Dryland.  The Mariner, a 
mutant man who has developed working gills and webbed feet, has little 
use for Enola or her older companion, Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn), but he 
owes them his life and intends to pay the debt.  Once the scales are 
even, however, they become expendable. </P>
<P>     WATERWORLD follows two parallel paths.  The first sets the 
Mariner's personality on a course of transformation from self-centered 
to heroic.  The other is the more tangible search for Dryland, which we 
instinctively know is going to appear during the film's last act.  After 
all, how often do movie quests go unfulfilled?  The script doesn't do a 
great job with either the spiritual or the physical trek, but the 
spectacular action sequences occur with enough regularity that strong 
writing isn't necessary to keep WATERWORLD afloat.  A little adrenaline 
can obscure quite a few holes. </P>
<P>     Kevin Costner, admittedly not the world's greatest actor, is fine 
as the dour Mariner.  With a greater range than Schwarzenegger, 
Stallone, Van Damme, and Seagal combined, Costner is more than capable 
of handling the limited role of an action hero.  Dennis Hopper, on the 
other hand, serves a dual function:  chief villain and comic relief.  
Not content with merely going over-the-top this time around, Hopper 
makes it obvious that nothing about Deacon is to be taken seriously -- 
and the approach works.  There's a strand of unmistakable, completely 
intentional humor running through WATERWORLD.   </P>
<P>     A couple of the more "tender" relationships fail.  The Mariner's 
affection for Enola comes across as forced, despite Majorino's winning 
performance.  ALIENS showed what a pseudo-parent/child bond can do for a 
movie, and that intensity is missing here.  Also, the romance between 
the Mariner and Helen is perfunctory at best, and largely underdeveloped 
and unsatisfying. </P>
<P>     Although the storyline isn't all that invigorating, the action is, 
and that's what saves WATERWORLD.  In the tradition of the old Westerns 
and Mel Gibson's Road Warrior flicks, this film provides good escapist 
fun.  Everyone behind the scenes did their part with aplomb, and the 
result is a feast for the eyes and ears.  And, though this film may have 
cost Universal upwards of $175 million, the price at the box office for 
the average movie-goer will still be in the $7.50 range -- worth it if 
adventure is your kind of thing. </P>
