<PRE>                         AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE
                       A film review by Sue Roberts
                        Copyright 1995 Sue Roberts</PRE>
<P>Portman/Wolfhound Productions together with British Screen and BBC
Films.
Directed by Mike Newell
Script by Charles Wood from the novel by Beryl Bainbridge
Starring Alan Rickman (O'Hara), Hugh Grant (Meredith),
         and Georgina Cates (Stella.)</P>
<PRE>     AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE is a lot more subtle than its title might
imply.</PRE>
<P>     Atmospherically staged against a backdrop of post-war Liverpool,
young Stella gets to experience more than just work behind the scenes.
The film manages to capture her youth, the observer whose innocent
conclusions dissolve into confusion, then gradual understanding of
everyones behaviour.</P>
<P>     The significance of the telephone, like so many of the details
which seem initially inconsequential, turns out to be a clue of
infinite relevance.  As the light dawned one was reminded of the style
of another novelist of the period, Agatha Christie.  The director
manages to convey an atmosphere of  artless simplicity whilst filling
the frame with the artifice of the theatre.  It is not until afterwards
that one realises just how frightfully clever he has been in laying the
trail!</P>
<P>     I loved all the bits where Meredith Potter gets to explain "What
the play is about."  What might he have made of this tale?  Why should
the seduction of a young man seem wrong whilst that of a young girl
appears acceptable? And who can see that people are mistaken to apply
double standards?</P>
<P>     Alan Rickman as O'Hara is utterly charismatic.  In this moving
performance he captures the unwitting carelessness of a man perceived
by all as a realist and yet at odds with reality.  It appears at first
glance to be a relationship of  maturity attracted by young love, but
perhaps  Stella may be the most aware of what she is doing as "Peter
Pan" unfolds....</P>
<P>     And what an array of talent in the supporting cast.  All
exquisitely characterised.  Bunny, (Peter Firth) Geoff-ew-ry, (Alan
Cox) and Prunella Scales (Rose, the theatre manager) to mention only a
few.</P>
<P>     Heaven knows what Liverpool F.C. will make of the soccer match!
However, this is a sensitive and thought provoking piece of cinema.</P>
