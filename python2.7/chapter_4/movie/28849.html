<PRE>THE SCORE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Given THE SCORE's killer cast (Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando and
Angela Bassett), you will probably be expecting a lot.  Start to lower your
expectations, because THE SCORE plays like a slow motion version of ENTRAPMENT
with De Niro attempting a geriatric rendition of Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Still,
De Niro gives it his all, which is a lot more than can be said about Brando, who
phones in his small part.  Even the usually outstanding Norton delivers one of
his less memorable performances.  Bassett, playing a disapproving girlfriend,
has a part that would be better cut out entirely.  In a script full of fat, hers
would be the first character that should go.</P>
<P>Following the standard caper formula, a seasoned pro, Nick Wells (De Niro), is
hired by his old partner, Max Baron (Brando), to pull one last job.  Max forces
Nick to take on relative newcomer Jackie Teller (Norton) as the inside man. 
Nick and Jackie are to steal a French national treasure, a scepter, from the
basement of the Customs Building in Montreal.</P>
<P>Working from a script created by no less than 4 writers (Daniel E. Taylor, Kario
Salem, Lem Dobbs and Scott Marshall Smith), director Frank Oz (BOWFINGER) tries
to move from comedies to thrillers.  For some reason, he forgot that thrillers,
especially thinly plotted ones like this one, need energy like comedies need
laughs.  And the writers forgot that thrillers need twists, lots of twists to
keep the suspense up.  Instead they gave the movie only two, and the studio gave
one of these away in the trailers.</P>
<P>Organized into the three canonical sections, planning, heist and getaway, the
movie spends almost all of the time grinding away at the preparation.  Expect to
spend most of your time slumped back in your seat rather than on the edge of it.
 Only the brief last act has any punch.   One suspects, and hopes, that this
movie will be buried at the summer box office by better movies and that the cast
will go on to be seen doing much better work in future films.</P>
<P>THE SCORE runs a long 2:03.  It is rated R for language and would be acceptable
for kids around 12 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it ***.  He said that he liked the characters, the
techniques of the robbery and plot's twists.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, July 13, 2001.  In the
Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the AMC and the Century theaters.</P>
