<PRE>THE ODD COUPLE II
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Since 1966, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon have collaborated eleven
times (remarkably, over half of those films have been in the last seven
years). However, most of their recent work has hearkened back to their
cantankerous relationship in 1968's The Odd Couple.  Grumpy Old Men and
Out to Sea were both sequels in spirit, if not in name, so it doesn't
seem like it has been thirty years since the original Odd Couple graced
the screen.  But now, our old friends Oscar and Felix have returned, a
little more vulgar and a whole lot older than before.</P>
<P>The old roommates have gone their separate ways, and haven't seen (or
thought much about) each other since 1981.  But, time hasn't changed
them.  Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is still a human pigsty, and Felix
Ungar (Jack Lemmon) is still compulsively antiseptic.</P>
<P>Both have gone through failed marriages, and the catalyst that brings
them back together is the upcoming marriage between their children:
Felix's daughter Hanah (Lisa Waltz) and Oscar's son Bruce (Jonathan
Silverman). The wedding is going to be held in a town about two hours
north of L.A. The two men plan to meet, rent a car and drive to the
town...but with these two, things aren't going to be that simple.</P>
<P>Oscar Madison and Felix Ungar were never the most complex of characters.
Each was simply a single personality trait taken to the extreme.  What
makes their characters come alive is the vibrant chemistry between
Matthau and Lemmon. The two actors simply work well together.  Whether
they are bickering or expressing their idiosyncrasies, it's a joy to
watch them together.</P>
<P>This time, they're helped out by a good script (by Neil Simon), which,
although it formulaically relies on a road-trip structure, has a few
genuine surprises.  The script's biggest weakness is an unnecessary coda
which seems to exist only to draw allusions to the original Odd Couple.</P>
<P>One problem that arises with The Odd Couple II is the age of the
protagonists. They seem like they're about 10-15 years too old for the
roles. Seeing them flirt around with Christine Baranski and Jean Smart
is like watching the antics of two dirty old men.  And when we meet with
their kids, the men seem more like grandfathers than fathers. While not
outside the realm of possibility, the film does seem to be pushing the
envelope.</P>
<P>Still, it is funny, and when that's true, most other considerations are
secondary. It may not be a classic like the original, but it sure is
enjoyable to revisit these old friends.</P>
