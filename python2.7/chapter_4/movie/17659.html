<P>Lately, Shakespeare has been the subject of many movies, including the winner
of the Academy Award for the Best Picture of 1998, Shakespeare In Love. 
Throughout 1999, moviegoers will also be able to experience William
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dreams and Hamlet.  Ten Things I Hate About
You is the adaption of the Shakespeare piece, "The Taming of The Shrew."  The
plot of Ten Things I Hate About You revolves around the Stratford sisters, two
students who attend Padua High that despise each other.  First, there is Bianca
Stratford, played by Larisa Oleynik, a popular, self centered person who
doesn't care about others.  Then, there is Bianca's sister named Kat, played by
Julia Stiles.  Kat is very disrespected at her school.  According to Bianca, at
one time Kat was popular, but because sick of the popularity.  Now, Kat is very
anti-social, mainly because she doesn't want to go with what everyone wants her
to do.</P>
<P>At Padua High, there is a new face around school.  His name is Cameron, played
by 3rd Rock From the Sun and Halloween H20's Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  His eye is
immediately caught by Bianca Stratford, and now he is desperate to win her
love.  Cameron is immediately facing a problem.  Joey, played by Andrew Keegan,
is a very popular jock at Padua High.  He also likes Bianca, so Cameron must
get to her first.  Now, Joey and Cameron are facing another problem.  Bianca is
not allowed to date because of the rule made by her father, played by Larry
Miller.  With the prom coming up, Bianca desperately wants to be able to date. 
Her father makes up a new rule.  If Kat dates, Bianca can date.  The rule
sounds extremely unfair to Bianca, considering Kat doesn't even want to date. 
Cameron and Joey must find someone to take out Kat, so Bianca can date. 
Patrick, played by Heath Ledger, seems to be the right one to take out Kat.  He
is bribed to take Kat out, and then the film goes into very predicable
sequences which I feel like I have watched over and over again.</P>
<P>TEN THINGS I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE
1. Julia Stiles's wonderful acting performance.  Julia was very realistic and
believable as a teen.  She has a bright future.
2. Larisa Oleynik's performance as Bianca.  She was also very realistic as a
teenager.  Her character is much like many kids at my own school.
3. The way that it got its ideas from Shakespeare.
4. There are a number of funny sequences.
5. The soundtrack is fast and fun.  It adds to the feel of the movie.
6. Heath Ledger's character was a pretty likable, fun character.  
7. The way Bianca realized that she is selfish and she should be different than
that.
8. The way the parent doesn't like their children be wild and uncontrolled like
many movie parents do.
9. Larry Miller's performance as her father was an amusing role.
10. The title.</P>
<P>TEN THINGS I HATED ABOUT THIS MOVIE
1. The character of Joey, along with the performance by Andrew Keegan.
2. The character of Cameron, along with the performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt
3. The way it is predictable.
4. The way it tries to mix little kid comedy with teenager comedy.
5. The way it is so much like other teen comedies.
6. The character of Michael.  
7. Julia Stiles's character wasn't seen more.  She was a great character.
8. It is very similarly to She's All That.
9. The way it leaves so many untied knots.
10. The ending.</P>
