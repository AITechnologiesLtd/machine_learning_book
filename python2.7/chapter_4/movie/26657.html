"We Put the SIN in Cinema"</PRE>
<P>The film that took Australia by storm has finally found its way to
American soil.  The Interview swept through the 1998 Australian Film
Institute Awards, winning three major prizes (Best Film, Best Screenplay
and Best Actor) out of the nine nominations it received.  Not bad,
considering it was writer/director Craig Monahan's first film.</P>
<P>The Interview is set in present-day Melbourne, and its first scene is a
real attention-grabber.  41-year-old Eddie Fleming (Hugo Weaving) is
asleep in his apartment, which is littered with old newspapers.  At
around 5 AM, his door is knocked off its hinges by a group of
plainclothes detectives, some of whom beat and handcuff Fleming as the
others begin to trash his pad in search of clues.  Fleming has no idea
why the cops are there, and before he can get his bearings, his pants
are full of piss and he's been dragged off to headquarters for
questioning.</P>
<P>At the police station, the investigation is taken over by Detective
Sergeant John Steele (Tony Martin) and Detective Senior Constable Wayne
Prior (Aaron Jeffrey), who proceed to interrogate Fleming with a `good
cop/bad cop' style of double-team attack.  The problem is that Fleming
still has no idea why he's there, but this doesn't keep Steele and Prior
from thinking they've got the right guy.</P>
<P>Most of The Interview takes place in the claustrophobic interrogation
room, where we slowly learn what crimes the police believe Fleming has
committed.  At first, Steele and Prior give the impression their subject
is suspected of car theft, but thanks to the numerous breaks taken
during their interrogation, we learn that the stolen car is just the tip
of the iceberg.  Fleming is actually the prime suspect in the
disappearance of six people the police believe have been murdered.</P>
<P>Suddenly, in the middle of the interrogation, Fleming throws the
detectives for a loop when he confesses to the murders, describing in
detail how he killed his victims and what he did with their bodies.
Steele and Prior lick their lips in anticipation of closing a
high-profile case, but their superiors aren't sure if Fleming is telling
the truth, or just leading the detectives on a wild-goose chase.</P>
<P>Weaving, who is probably best known in the States as the guy who chased
Keanu in The Matrix, is fantastic (and nearly unrecognizable with
medium-length blond hair), acting more with his eyebrows than most
mainstream stars can pull off with their entire bodies.  Martin also
does a decent job, but Jeffrey adds little to the film except
knuckle-dragging muscle.</P>
<P>The Interview could be a kissing cousin to The Usual Suspects, but
Monahan actually began writing his script in the early ‘90s, so all
similarities are coincidental.  It's a good film, but, unfortunately, it
still feels like a Suspects rip-off.  But that's still better than
harvesting the carcass of a ‘70s television show or Saturday Night Live
skit.  Imagine Kafka taking on an episode of Homicide or NYPD Blue, and
you've got a pretty good idea of the kind of film The Interview is.
Terrific cinematography from Simon Duggan (the upcoming Risk) and score
from double Oscar nominee David Hirschfelder (Shine, Elizabeth).</P>
