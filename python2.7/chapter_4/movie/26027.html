Susan Granger's review of "THE FANTASTICKS" (M.G.M./UNITED ARTISTS)</PRE>
<P>  It's been more than 40 years since the two-act, fairy-tale
musical by Tom Jones with lyrics by Harvey Schmidt opened off-Broadway
at the tiny Sullivan Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village. Performed
simply no scenery and few props, it relied primarily on the audience's
imagination, much like "Our Town." In Michael Ritchie's screen
version, it's set in rural Arizona, where a traveling carnival sets up
in the vast wilderness. The plot still revolves around two fathers
(Joel Grey, Brad Sullivan) who pretend to have an on-going feud in
hopes that their respective children, Louisa and Matt (Jean Louisa
Kelly, Joseph McIntyre), will behave as teenagers have throughout the
centuries: rebel against them and fall in love. When this happens, the
fathers must find a way to resolve their imaginary feud, so they
conspire to have the carnival's handsome El Gallo (Jonathan Morris)
pretend to be a bandit and kidnap Luisa so that Matt rescue her. What
they don't figure into their plan is that Luisa might become
infatuated with her abductor and that Matt might not be up to the
task. What works is the simple story and evocative musical score -
with "Try to Remember" now used as a finale. What doesn't work is
opening up the concept to the big-screen; unlike "Oklahoma," for
instance, the wind doesn't come sweeping down the plains. As a result,
video sales will no doubt top theatrical revenues. Perhaps that's why
this film has sat on the shelf for five years. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "The Fantasticks" is a charming, nostalgic 7. It's
timeless, old-fashioned family-fare, filled with hopes and dreams
which bridge the generations and offer all of us a feeling of wondrous
well-being. But is there still an audience for movie musicals?</P>
