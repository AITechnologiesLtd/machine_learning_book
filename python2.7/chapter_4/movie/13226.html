Armageddon (PG-13) *** (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>For all the talk about their shared "the sky is falling" theme,
_Armageddon_, about an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, can best
be described as the opposite side of a coin shared by its counterpart, the
serious falling comet tale _Deep_Impact_.  That said, on its own, unique
terms, the slam-bang _Armageddon_ is a reasonably satisfying summer
blockbuster, with all the flaws and virtues that come with that label.</P>
<P>In addition to the "end of the world" theme, _Armageddon_ and
_Deep_Impact_ do have another thing in common: successfully overcoming a
setup that borders on the ridiculous.  After a group of top government and
scientific advisors determine that the only way to possibly prevent (yes)
armageddon is to detonate a nuclear bomb inside the asteroid, NASA
executive director Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) recruits expert deep-core
driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, inexplicably speaking in a wildly
inconsistent drawl) and his crew to do the job.  Of course, these drillers
aren't astronauts, which means a slow-going hour-long passage in which the
roughnecks undergo extensive training and evaluation for their outer space
mission.  A lot of what goes on, including psychological and physical exams
and a side trip to a strip club, is supposed to be funny.  But with the
exception of a couple of one-liners dryly delivered by the
always-entertaining Steve Buscemi (as horny geologist Rockhound), the
comedy is merely tedious--just as tedious, in fact, as the setup of
_Deep_Impact_, but in a different way, ineptly aiming for cheap laughs as
opposed to earnestly setting up hokey, all-too-familiar disaster epic plot
threads.</P>
<P>_Armageddon_'s light touch is just one in its long line of differences
from its more grave counterpart.  While _Deep_Impact_ was a dramatic
treatment of a doomsday scenario, _Armageddon_ takes a gung-ho,
action-oriented approach.  Director Michael Bay (who appears fleetingly as
a NASA technician) wastes no time putting the special effects dollars to
work; before he hits the basic training lull, Bay treats the audience to a
curtain-raising space shuttle explosion and a spectacular meteor shower in
New York City.  With this different angle comes a pivotal change of
perspective, focusing on the outer space rescue mission as opposed to
_Impact_'s cross-section of Earth dwellers.  So, in essence, it can be said
that _Armageddon_, with its scrappy crew doing their best to "fight the
future," is a film about living, not dying, the ominous inevitability of
which was the Earth-centered _Impact_'s main issue.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the difference between _Armageddon_ and _Deep_Impact_ can be
boiled down to a fundamental one: male and female.  As
_Entertainment_Weekly_'s Lisa Schwarzbaum observed in her review, the
touchy-feely _Deep_Impact_ was a "woman's action movie"; _Armageddon_, from
notoriously testosterone-heavy producer Jerry Bruckheimer, is clearly one
for the guys.  In addition to all the full-throttle spectacle,
_Armageddon_, like all Bruckheimer films, barely has enough time for the
onscreen females.  Liv Tyler is prominently featured in the marketing
campaign, but her slim role is merely an amalgam of two cardboard female
stereotypes: rebellious daughter (to Harry) and devoted girlfriend (to
driller A.J. Frost, played by Ben Affleck).  There is one female on the
space crew, ballbusting co-pilot Watts (Jessica Steen), but, in typical
Bruckheimer fashion, she's literally shoved out of the way at a critical
moment.</P>
<P>So when _Armageddon_ picks up steam with the shuttle launch at about the
one-hour mark, it is momentum of the hard-driving, Hollywood action sort
that takes over, not the subtle, surprising poignance that _Deep_Impact_
eventually took on.  Bay, as shown in his previous two films (also
Bruckheimer productions), _Bad_Boys_ and _The_Rock_, is a crack action
director, and he successfully generates tension and excitement from
otherwise been-there, done-that situations such as the last-second
disarming of a ticking bomb (complete with, as Roger Ebert terms them, an
"RDR"--red digital display) and a narrow escape from an exploding complex.
All of the mayhem comes bathed in Bay's trademark, music-video-honed visual
razzle dazzle, heavy on the quick cuts and slow-mo moments, which keeps the
proceedings interesting.</P>
<P>_Armageddon_ is a sturdy popcorn extravaganza; if only Bay and the writing
crew of Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams, Robert Roy Pool, Jonathan
Hensleigh, Tony Gilroy, and Shane Salerno were content to keep it that way.
 But, seeing they were telling a larger-than-life story (and perhaps swayed
by the estrogen of producer Gale Anne Hurd), they decided to go for
emotional content to match, with smaller-than-life results.  While there is
nothing here nearly as embarrassing as the laughably dreary "How Do I
Live?"-scored reunion between Nicolas Cage and family in _Con_Air_, the
general lack of subtlety in _Armageddon_ (and, for that matter, other
Bruckheimer productions) prevent the conclusion, which is to supposed to be
a profoundly moving, from completely convincing; the "human drama" comes
off every bit as calculated as the effects.</P>
<P>Although two films are quite different, in the end the question will
always be "Is _Armageddon_ better than _Deep_Impact_?"  For me, it's pretty
much a draw, but one that can be decided depending on what it is one wants
to see.  If it's drama, _Deep_Impact_; if it's action, _Armageddon_.  I'd
venture to guess that it's the latter quality most moviegoers would go for,
and, consequently, the box office answer to the question would be an
emphatic yes.</P>
