<P>   Let's say that you're a person who works for a living, so
that whether you're a member of a union or not, you support
the activities of organized labor.  You wouldn't think of
crossing a picket line.  But then you witness an unusual
phenomenon that gets you thinking about your views.  A pro
football team is on strike, its players forming a line around the
stadium?  Why?  Some of the players who are making five
million dollars a year are asking for seven million.  Would you
sing "Solidarity Forever" as you pass them by, or would you
swear off professional sports altogether and put your efforts
exclusively into your Little League coaching job?</P>
<P>   This is the sort of question that Howard Deutch, at the
helm of "The Replacements," could have explored in Vince
McKewin's fictionalized version of an actual labor dispute
involving such a team in 1987.  The issue could conceivably
be examined even in a summer popcorn movie.  Deutch
could implicitly ask us in the audience whether we support
the striking team's conduct in throwing eggs at the bus of the
team which is crossing the lines to replace them, even
overturning the car of the quarterback on whose shoulders
rests the responsibility of getting the crew into the playoffs. 
Instead, we have to settle for a mind-numbingly predictable,
inane narrative which fills the screen with the most
stereotypical characters--losers all, who (surprise!) emerge at
the end of the movie as conquerors.</P>
<P>   The story turns on a strike by the entire Washington
Sentinels team in mid-season, an outfit owned by the crusty
Edward O'Neill (Jack Warden) and coached by the sincere
and enthusiastic veteran Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman). 
When the already expensive squad walks the line outside the
stadium, O'Neil and McGinty discuss what to do since, after
all, the Sentinels must win the next three out of four games to
enter the playoffs, and even a new group of cheerleaders
must be recruited to inspire the men.  McGinty hits on the
sentimental idea of hiring a bunch of losers to whom he will
give a second chance, even persuading Maryland's governor
to release a hardened criminal from jail, Earl Wilkinson
(Michael Jace).  He rounds up a chain-smoking Welshman,
Nigel Gruff (Rhys Ifans); a deaf player, Brian Murphy (David
Denman); a Japanese sumo wrestler, Jumbo Fumiko (Ace
Yonamine); and most notably a has-been quarterback who
screwed up badly in the Sugar Bowl a few seasons back,
Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves).  Though this group of scabs
become embroiled in several fratricidal fights, they make up
for their deficiency of adequate training with what the other
teams lack: heart--"miles and miles of heart," in the
expression of the coach--words which the majority of the
movie audience will have heard for the first time.</P>
<P>   In line with the demands of the summer sports genre, the
new group of Sentinels face the villainous opposition of the
regular quarterback, Eddie Martel (Brett Cullen), who
regularly rags the irregulars, even inspiring his teammates to
turn over Falco's car twice.  For the necessary love interest,
Deutch has the handsome and gentle quarterback, Shane
Falco, make eyes at the head cheerleader/bartender,
Annabelle (Brooke Langton), and for sex, we get the motley
group of cheerleaders recruited partly from the local strip
joints to do some suggestive dances while players on both
sides, and even the referees, have a difficult time keeping
their eyes glued to the ball.  </P>
<P>   Tech credits are OK, with DP Tak Fujimoto exercising
some long shots of the filled stadium with close-ups of the
men who repeatedly smash into each other, while keeping
the MTV fans in the movie audience busy moving from the
large-shouldered men on the field to the amply endowed
women delivering non-traditional cheers.  </P>
<P>   "The Replacements" is far removed from the more
penetrating "Any Given Sunday," Oliver Stone's terrific
football saga that castigates those who have made football a
business with its performers more interested in contracts for
commercials than in throwing touchdown passes.  Nor does it
possess the acting talent of Cameron Crowe's "Jerry
Maguire," which included the benefit of exploring a sports
agent's crisis of conscience.  In others, "The Replacements"
settles for mere fluff when a solid sports film could feature all
the bone-crushing body crunches while still investigating real
issues.</P>
<P>Rated PG-13.  Running time: 110 minutes.  (C) 2000 by
