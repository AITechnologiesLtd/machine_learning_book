<P>     It's difficult to explain how 85 minutes of effortless charm could be
neutralized by one scene without giving away the ending of WAKING NED
DEVINE.  As a film critic I almost always champion films that take
narrative risks, avoiding the plague of the obvious.  WAKING NED DEVINE
takes just such a risk, but the result feels like a particularly nasty
bait-and-switch.  Where many films err with gratuitous sentimentality,
this one errs with a gratuitous lack of sentimentality.</P>
<P>     The most frustrating thing is that so much of it is so entertaining.
Set in the coastal Irish hamlet of Tulaigh Mhor, it centers on Jackie
O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), two elderly
friends among the town's 52 inhabitants.  One morning, Jackie makes the
connection from a newspaper headline that a winning lottery ticket was
purchased in Tulaigh Mhor, meaning one of the other 50 townspeople is now
very wealthy -- and very desirable as a friend.  After narrowing down the
field of contenders, Jackie realizes the winner must be fisherman Ned
Devine.  Unfortunately, Ned is in no position to claim his prize, having
dropped dead from shock while watching the numbers announced on 
television.</P>
<P>     Thus begins a sparkling bit of farce as Jackie, Michael and
eventually the entire town conspire to share in the late Ned's good
fortune.  When lottery offical Jim Kelly (Brendan F. Dempsey) arrives from
Dublin to verify the winner, Michael is forced into the unfamiliar role of
actor, posing as Ned so the $6 million pound jackpot won't go without a
claimant.  Both lead actors are splendid -- Bannen the gleeful mastermind
behind the plan, and Kelly the flustered star of his show.  The sequence
in which Jackie and Michael try to set up the deception, caught off-guard
by Mr. Kelly's early arrival, shows director Kirk Jones to have a rare
sort of comic timing.  Farce rarely works on film the way it works on a
stage, but WAKING NED DEVINE fires on every cylinder -- game actors in a
great comic situation guided by a talented director.</P>
<P>     There's also a major sub-plot in WAKING NED DEVINE, a romantic
triangle of sorts between single mother Maggie (Susan Lynch), gentle
but foul-smelling pig farmer Finn (James Nesbitt) and self-satisfied
ladies' man Pat Mulligan (Matthew Devitt).  Initially, the whole business
seems to be little more than a distraction, an excuse for gags about odor
and fruity soaps.  Gradually, however, it begins to take shape as the
ideal set-up for the story's lesson.  Finn loves his work as a pig farmer,
but Maggie will only marry him if he gives it up.  Will the lottery
windfall in which he'll share change Finn into a more suitable husband,
yet a less satisfied man?  How will riches change all the citizens of
Tulaigh Mhor?</P>
<P>     And it is here, friends, that WAKING NED DEVINE takes its left turn
into black comedy and bleak morality.  Plenty of viewers will walk away
from WAKING NED DEVINE believing they have seen a feel-good film with a
happy ending, but it is an entirely contrary reaction which blunted my
enthusiasm.  I laughed and laughed and laughed through much of the film.
Then I gasped.  Then I fumed.  WAKING NED DEVINE sheds its sympathy and
its sense of good humor for what, in retrospect, feels like a cheap shock
and a toast to situational ethics.  85 minutes of effortless charm counts
for a lot.  If only one scene didn't make it count for so much less.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Devine interventions:  6.</PRE>
