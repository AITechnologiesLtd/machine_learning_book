<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
2 and a half stars</P>
<P>After a clever and hilarious opening scene, it is hard to accept that
Waking Ned Devine fails to maintain a consistent comedic beat.  With the
pitch and tone of a quirky comedy but an off and on direction, Ned
Devine is often simultaneously hard to hate and hard to enjoy.  Debut
writer-director Kirk Jones seems oblivious to the idiocy of his subject
matter, and regularly struggles to bring a sense of humor to the
outrageous.  That is why he resorts to some monotonous scenarios, but
occasionally strikes gold by giving his elderly protagonists enough
flair to make whatever they do seem bearable.</P>
<P>Poor Ned Devine was lucky enough to win a lottery of 6.8 million pounds,
but unlucky enough not to live to spend it.  We learn that Ned was
literally shocked to death, holding his winning ticket and watching TV
at the time of the unfortunate incident.  Enter elderly friends Jackie
O'Shea (Ian Bannen) and Michael O'Sullivan (David Kelly), a twisted pair
who are intent on finding the winner of the lottery and squeezing a
share of it for themselves.  They learn that the winner is a resident of
a small town named Tullymore, population 52.  Eventually discovering
that the person they are looking for is dead, Michael pretends he is Ned
Devine, and the town's residents are dragged into the task of confirming
his borrowed identity so that they can split the loot between them.</P>
<P>Jones' screenplay sprouts various subplots, all of which are neither as
original or entertaining as Jackie and Michael's quest to obtain the
prize money.  The various residents of Tullymore appear as pretty much
lifeless, with only Bannen and Kelly breathing life into their
characters.  Their performances are solid and memorable, and will
undoubtedly draw comparisons to the work of Walter Matthau and Jack
Lemmon.</P>
<P>The scenes that stage Waking Ned Devine's jokes are generally quite
entertaining.  One great thing that Jones achieves is a coherency with
the style of his comedic scenes, and he does his best to steer the film
away from gags that we have seen before.  Desperately trying to be
original, Jones goes to extreme lengths to squeeze laughs, including
placing a nude O'Sullivan on a motorcycle and making O'Shea change Ned
Devines face expression.  Some may find these moments hilarious, but I
found them irritating.  A nude old man on a bike is funny for the first
few seconds, as is somebody moving the jaw and eyes of a dead man.
Although entertaining, Waking Ned Devine does not have the comic timing
of something like The Full Monty (which it has been persistently
compared to, simply because both films were made in the United Kingdom),
or the witty black humor that can make these films so funny.</P>
<P>Needless to say, Waking Ned Devine is lightheaded and generally quite
enjoyable.  Thus, it is such a disappointment that Kirk Jones has not
only managed to spoil the atmosphere of his film on many occasions, but
he has ruined entire scenes with bad writing and timing.  In one of
Waking Ned Devine's most emphasized moments - when some of its
characters raise their glasses to the dead lottery winner - Jones misses
the appropriate tone entirely. Instead of being touching, it is faintly
idiotic and out of place.  That's just one example of Jones' off and
direction, although I guess one of its positive assets is that for every
bad scene he makes, there is a reasonable (if not good) scene to
counterpart.  If Jones had been able to maintain a solid comedic beat
and an effective dramatic core, Waking Ned Devine could have been much
more than what it is: a film which is simultaneously hard to hate and
hard to enjoy.</P>
