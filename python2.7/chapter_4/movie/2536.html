<PRE>                                   CRONOS
                      A        film review by Mark R. Leeper
                       Copyright 1994 Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>          Capsule review:  This        is genuinely a cutting-edge art
     house monster movie.  It is visually striking, has        a real
     "what-happens-next?" plot,        and some intriguing human
     relationships.  It        has been a long        time since a new monster
     movie has played to art film audiences, but this one is worth
     it.  Rating: high +2 (-4 to +4)</PRE>
<PRE>     Sometime I        say "don't trust me on this one        because        it is not my kind of
film.  On this one I say don't trust me        because        it *is* my kind of film.  From
an early age I have loved the horror film.  But        I have to say that the
horror film rarely likes me.  Too often        the horror film        just feeds off films
made earlier.  It has sequels that are really remakes and even films in
which each ten minutes is a remake of the last ten minutes.  The sort of
thing you see is "Another teenager is fooling around for nine minutes, then
Jason attacks and kills        him."  What changes from film to film is the
prosthetic makeup, the special effects,        and very little        else.  The feeling I
most prize in a        horror film is not chills but curiosity.  There        are far        too
few films that make me wonder what the heck is going to        happen next.  Horror
films that do that include CARNIVAL OF SOULS, LIFEFORCE, THE DEVIL RIDES
OUT, TO        THE DEVIL A DAUGHTER, CRONOS, and not nearly enough other horror
films.        What makes CRONOS a particular surprise        is that        it comes from
Mexico,        a country whose        horror films have so often lacked style        and
originality.  Occasionally there will be an atmospheric        scene in a Mexican
vampire        film, but by and large there has not been a whole lot to interest
foreign        markets.  Now Guillermo        Del Toro has made what may have        been for me
the most enjoyable and creative        horror film of the 90s.</PRE>
<PRE>     In        1536 an        alchemist fleeing the Inquisition came to Mexico where he
continued his work on immortality until        his death in the 1930s.         The
authorities were shocked by what they found in his rooms, sold off his
belongings, and        considered the matter closed.  In 1996,        an antiques dealer,
Jesus Gris (played by Federico Luppi) finds a strange antique clockwork
mechanism hidden in the        base of        a statue.  It looks like a very        large pocket
watch, the size        of a bar of soap, crossed with a mechanical scorpion.  Wind
it up and it sprouts legs and stings the hand that is holding it.  It is a
nasty trick, but that is just the beginning.  Roughly speaking I will say
that it        does fall into an overly-familiar horror genre,        but it presses
buttons        that genre rarely approaches.</PRE>
<PRE>     This is a film of stylish images and delightful subtle humor.  Little
visual images like the monster walking the streets of Mexico in        what looks
like a tuxedo worn back        to front (don't        worry, in context it makes perfect
sense) spice the film and make it a pure pleasure to watch.  Del Toro, who
both wrote and directed, has an        impressive visual sense        without        ever letting
the special effects or the makeup take over the        film.  Also to be treasured
are the        few looks we get inside        the Cronos Device itself.</PRE>
<PRE>     Del Toro is a well-known film fan in Latin        America        having grown up        on
United States and British horror films,        OUTER LIMITS, and TWILIGHT ZONE.  He
wrote the definitive Latin American study of the works of Alfred Hitchcock
(which he calls        a 540-page love        letter to Hitchcock made public).  Now he is
making his own horror films to compete in Mexico with those made in the
United States and if this first        film is        any indication he is exceeding his
goal.  Sr. Del Toro, please continue to        make original films like this one.</PRE>
<PRE>     CRONOS is one of the most enjoyable horror        films I        have seen since        I
was a teen, I would rate it a high +2 on the -4        to +4 scale.</PRE>
