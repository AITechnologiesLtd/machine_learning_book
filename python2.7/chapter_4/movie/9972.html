<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   While the recent film adaptations based upon the works of Henry James
   -- Jane Campion's THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY and Agneiszka Holland's
   WASHINGTON SQUARE -- were mildly disappointing to various degrees,
   such is not the case with the latest James-inspired piece, Iain
   Softley's richly handsome production of THE WINGS OF THE DOVE.
   Finely observed and splendidly performed, this is a most impressive
   costume drama which is sure to draw heavy attention during awards
   season.</P>
<P>   The screenplay by Hossein Amini (who splendidly adapted Thomas
   Hardy's JUDE for Michael Winterbottom last year) heavily revamps
   Henry James' story, giving it a modern spin, pushing the action
   forward up eight years to 1910, and extensively rewriting the
   dialogue of the characters, but retains the novel's essence and loses
   none of its moral ambiguity.  That the audience's sympathies are
   exchanged so fluidly between its characters is indicative of THE
   WINGS OF THE DOVE's transcendence of the staidness often associated
   with the costume melodrama genre.</P>
<P>   At first, our sympathies belong with Kate Croy (Helena Bonham
   Carter), who serves as the focal figure and the catalyst in THE WINGS
   OF THE DOVE.  The young Englishwoman's foothold in high society is
   tenuous; her mother has recently died, her father is a penniless
   opium addict, and the only thing separating Kate from poverty is the
   patronage of her wealthy Aunt Maud (Charlotte Rampling), who's
   determined to marry Kate to someone with social stature -- perhaps
   snooty Lord Mark (Alex Jennings).  Kate's heart, however, belongs
   elsewhere -- to an upstanding man distinctly of lower class,
   struggling journalist Merton Densher (Linus Roache) -- and this
   enrages her benefactor, who forbids Kate from seeing him and
   threatens to cut off her father's meager subsistence allowance.</P>
<P>   Enter Millie Theale (Alison Elliott), a fabulously wealthy young
   American, of whom it is remarked "She'd be the Queen of America, if
   they had one."  She and Kate meet at a dinner party and quickly
   strike up a close friendship.  When Kate finds that Millie (who's
   unaware of Kate's clandestine relationship) has eyes for Merton, and
   learns elsewhere that Millie is stricken with a terminal illness, she
   unhatches a deceptive scheme which ultimately has unexpectedly
   powerful and tragic repercussions for all involved.</P>
<P>   THE WINGS OF THE DOVE smartly avoids explicitly spelling out Kate's
   devious plan for as long as possible, and while it could have stood
   to improve by omitting a unambiguous description of her plot, it's
   nonetheless effective both in underlining the stealthful complicity
   of Kate and Merton, and their unspoken reluctancy to perpetrate their
   self-serving deed.</P>
<P>   What's interesting here is that despite the hurtful treachery
   committed against unsuspecting Millie by Kate and Merton, their
   intentions towards her are anything but malicious; unlike in James'
   novel, it clearly comes across in the film that the lovers genuinely
   like Millie, and this brings new dimensions to what would otherwise
   be a fairly superficial depiction of green-eyed villainy.  The
   machinations are a consequently a little less ruthless, a little bit
   more compassionate in nature, and one can legitimately begin to
   consider how much of Kate's plotting serves the needs and desires of
   her ailing friend's as much as it does her own.</P>
<P>   Ms. Bonham Carter is very effective as Kate.  Despite her complex
   character's less-than-honourable motivations and her dishonestly
   manipulative tactics, she still manages to come across as far from
   villainous, a desperate woman whose circumstances have culminated in
   this dishonourable path to tread.  Even as we view her actions as
   abhorrent, Ms. Bonham Carter makes us if not sympathise, at least
   empathise with Kate's dilemma.</P>
<P>   Mr. Roache is very good as a man torn between desire and duty, and
   his character's struggle with his conscience and his own moral fibre
   is palpable.  Caught between the desire to do right by both women and
   his passion for Kate, Merton is perhaps the character who's
   ultimately affected the most; Mr. Roache's heartwrenching performance
   is key in the tumultuous emotional buildup at the conclusion of THE
   WINGS OF THE DOVE which pays off lavishly.</P>
<P>   Ms. Elliott is nothing short of beguiling as Millie, whose presence
   throughout the film is bittersweet.  To reconcile her distinctly
   beatific aura with her ailing mortality is heartbreaking, and her
   intoxicating demeanour and dreamy-eyed smile while sharing stolen
   moments with Merton are luminous.  The dizzying sense of passion so
   missing in WASHINGTON SQUARE is perfectly captured here with a scene
   which features Ms. Elliott up high on a church, beaming upwards,
   completely enraptured.  I've admired Ms. Elliott's work for several
   years now; her performance here is a major step forward for her and
   marks a career best.</P>
<P>   The supporting players in THE WINGS OF THE DOVE are solid in
   relatively minor roles.  Mr. Jennings is very good in a limited
   capacity, while Elizabeth McGovern, although fine in her supporting
   role as Millie's faithful travelling companion, seems somewhat out of
   place here in a period piece.</P>
<P>   THE WINGS OF THE DOVE is precisely captures emotional truths, both
   big and small.  The delicacy of the interplay between the characters
   rings true -- the encounters between Merton and Millie in scenic
   Venice, riding in the canals or walking in the perpetual rainfall are
   fraught with charged sexual tension, and the lovemaking scene between
   Kate and Merton is one of the most passionate ever put to film --
   except here, the passion shared between the lovers is not that of
   lust, but grief.  The film even has a sense of humour, with Kate
   arranging for Millie and Merton to share an awkward private moment at
   an art exhibit of nudes.  Within the context of a highly mannered
   piece, the cumulative effect of the bombardment of emotionality, both
   high and low, is a highly affecting denouement.</P>
<P>   This is a masterful direction job by Iain Softley, who rebounds from
   the disappointment of HACKERS and fulfills on the promise of his
   feature film debut work in BACKBEAT.  Confidently helmed, THE WINGS
   OF THE DOVE has a nice deliberate pace where every shot is efficient
   and purposeful; there are are no throwaways.  There's a particularly
   interesting shot sequence early in the film where Merton vainly
   protests with Aunt Maud's doorman, arguing that he won't leave until
   he can speak with Kate.  The shot of Kate in the window, forlornly
   gazing down upon Merton in the street with her huge smoldering eyes,
   is strategically placed to obscure her lips -- and indeed,
   communication between the two is severed at this point in the film.
   While the film could certainly excise the reiterative flashback shots
   that appear at a climactic point in the film that prove to be
   redundant and ineffective, as a whole Mr. Softley's helming of THE
   WINGS OF THE DOVE is impressively proficient.</P>
<P>   In fact, THE WINGS OF THE DOVE is precisely the sort of film which is
   undoubtedly bound to draw the attention of year-end award voters, and
   could conceivably snare no less than five and perhaps as many as ten
   Oscar nominations -- Picture, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress,
   Director, Adapted Screenplay, Art Direction, Cinematography, Costume
   Direction, and Editing (there's one transition shot which is
   strikingly distracting -- you can virtually see the shot freeze --
   but it's otherwise elegantly edited by Tariq Anwar) are all eminently
   feasible possibilities.  This is a superb, moving film, easily the
   best costume drama of the year to date, and among the finest of
   recent years.</P>
