<PRE>           "I'm not the man they think I am back home;
            I'm a rocket man."  -Elton John</PRE>
<P>        "October Sky" is a cinematic testament to the power of dreams,
and why they make life worth living.  Based on the true story of four
teenage boys who strove to make their lives extraordinary, the film
is uplifting, involving, and triumphant.  It's a tale rooted in the
tradition of emotional filmmaking; in a some ways, I was reminded
of a teenage "It's a Wonderful Life."</P>
<P>        It's October 1957, and seventeen year-old Homer Hickam (Jake
Gyllenhaal) is, like the rest of the nation, captivated by the launch
of the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite.  Most of his fellow
townsfolk in the small mining community of Coalwood, West Virginia
see the device as something to fear ("Are they gonna use it to drop
bombs on us?" frets a nervous housewife).  But Homer is not a typical
teen, and his imagination embraces the scientific possibilities now
stretching out before mankind.  So taken with these eye-opening
new ideas, the impetuous youth soon embarks on a quest to build
a rocket.</P>
<P>        Most of his friends think he's crazy, but Homer finds a trio
of allies who share this unusual dream: the cocky Roy Lee (William
Lee Scott), his friend O'Dell (Chad Lindberg), and the brainy Quentin
(Chris Owen), whose knowledge of physics and chemistry far exceeds
their teacher's.  Working with supplies "borrowed" from local
businesses, the boys soon turn an abandoned lot into their own
personal Cape Canavrel as they construct their model rocket, which
they christen AUK1 (a tounge-in-cheek gesture: an auk is a small,
flightless bird).</P>
<P>        The name is an unfortunately apt one, and the boys suffer
numerous hardships while attempting to get the device ready in
time for the county (and hopefully national) Science Fair.  They
have the drive to keep trying, however: Homer in particular sees
the AUK project as not just a hobby but a possible means of
escape from the trap of Coalwood.  He desperately wishes to
attend college, but the only way he could afford it would be to
win a football scholarship, as his brother Jim did.  Homer is not
the athletic type, however, and so AUK becomes his driving force
and a powerful symbol: not only does he hope the rocket will soar,
he hopes it will take him with it, right out of Coalwood, with an
academic scholarship attatched.</P>
<P>        Although his mother Elsie (Natalie Canerday from "Sling
Blade") and his teacher Miss Riley (Laura Dern) are both
supportive in this new endeavor, Homer's father John (Chris
Cooper) thinks the boy is wasting his time.  Father and son do
not relate well, and on a certain level that's the main story
of "October Sky": how two vastly different people learn to
respect each other and set aside their differences.  The film
handles their relationship smartly, as we watch the two men try
to comprehend each other's motives.  John expects Homer to follow
in his footsteps and work in the town's coal mine; Homer dreams
only of the stars and his precious rockets.  John doesn't realize
that his own driving passion for mining is just as strong as
his son's love of rocketry, and one of the best scenes occurs when
Homer accuses his father of loving the mine more than he does
his family.</P>
<P>        The relationship between father and son becomes the story's
emotional cornerstone.  Their lives are an interesting juxtaposition:
the scenes with Homer and his friends testing their prototypes in
the great outdoors contrast sharply with the dark, claustrophobic
shots of John working in the mine.  It's no surprise that they have
trouble relating to each other: their worlds don't overlap in the
slightest.  If the final reconciliation between Homer and John
reeks a bit heavily of saccharine, it's still effective when seen
in context with the film as a whole.</P>
<P>        "October Sky" contains a wealth of characters, most of whom
are well developed-- not surprising, since the film is based on a true
story.  (A nice touch: the closing credits contain Super 8 footage of
the real people the story is based on.)  But sadly, Roy Lee and O'Dell
are given only token attention here, and seem to be included only to
be
historically accurate.  Neither boy does anything of consequence.  I
would've liked to learn more about them, but alas, they're both too
shadowy and insubstantial to get a handle on.</P>
<P>        If we remove the inconsequential characters, the film is
basically the tale of Homer and Quentin's quest to build a rocket.
On a larger level, it's also the story of one boy's coming of age,
and how he found the courage to struggle ahead in the face of
adversity.  In that sense, "October Sky" is as big and glorious
as its title.</P>
