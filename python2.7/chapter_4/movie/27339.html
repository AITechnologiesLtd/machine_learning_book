Susan Granger's review of  "VATEL" (Miramax Films)</PRE>
<P>   Based on a true story and adapted into English by Tom
Stoppard from Jeanne Labrune's French screenplay, this elegant,
elaborate 17th century costume drama is propelled by the scheme of a
nearly bankrupt French prince (Julian Glover) to save his province by
entertaining King Louis XIV (Julian Sands) and his courtiers so
lavishly that he will gain favor and patronage.  To this end, he
relies on his master steward Vatel (Gerard Depardieu), an artist with
the power to "create and astonish," to design and orchestrate an
incredibly decadent weekend-in-the-country, a bacchanal of eating,
drinking, sport and opulent theatrical spectacles. What's unexpected
is that, amidst the various sensual pleasures and treacherous sexual
liaisons, the King's new courtesan, Anne de Montausier (Uma Thurman),
will take a fancy to Vatel, seeking him out amidst his army of
peasants in the kitchen galleys, which infuriates the King's scheming
confidante (Tim Roth), whom she spurns.  Director Roland Joffe ("The
Killing Fields") concocts an indulgent feast-for-the eye but what he
sacrifices at the banquet is character development. Many relationships
and political intrigues are left unexplored and unexplained. As a
result, the audience remains emotionally uninvolved. Cinematographer
Robert Fraisse, designer Jean Rabasse and costumer Yvonne Sassinot de
Nesle create magnificent pageantry and authentically gilded excess
within the vast chateau where Vatel, literally, has a finger in every
pot, inventing whipped cream when the eggs go bad, drawing miraculous
confections out of spun sugar, and defending a scullery lad from the
unwanted advances of the Sun King's gay brother. On the Granger Movie
Gauge of 1 to 10, "Vatel" is a sumptuous 7, appealing particularly to
the appetites of art-house audiences.</P>
