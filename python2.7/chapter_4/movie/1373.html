<PRE>                                 WHITE SANDS
                       A film review by Frank Maloney
                        Copyright 1992 Frank Maloney</PRE>
<P>     WHITE SANDS is a film directed by Roger Donaldson, from a script by
Daniel Pyne.  It stars Willem Dafoe, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Mickey
Rourke, Samuel L.  Jackson, and Mimi Rogers.  Rated R for profanity,
violence, mature themes.</P>
<P>     WHITE SANDS is part conspiracy-paranoia thriller, part whodunit.
It features two excellent performers in the persons of Willem Dafoe and
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, along with the less satisfying and smirking
Mickey Rourke (who is still my idea of a bargain-basement Bruce Willis),
a slightly unlikely Samuel L. Jackson as a too-street-wise FBI agent,
and the too-truncated presence of Mimi Rogers.  It features the
directorial skills of Roger Donaldson (NO WAY OUT), who confronts a
largely unbelievable story with a keen visual sense and a tight
story-telling skill that keeps us largely guessing.  It also features a
script by Daniel Pryne (PACIFIC HEIGHTS, DOC HOLLYWOOD), a script that
locks onto our willingness to believe in corruption and the pursuit of
power for its sake.  Unfortunately, Pryne cannot do so in a wholly
credible way, and the stretches the audience has to make to keep the
story alive are asking a bit much in the end.</P>
<P>     The film wants to be provocative and timely; it wants to speak to
our mistrust of government; and it wants to entertain us.  It is a game
effort, even if a little short of its goals.  Dafoe and Mastrantonio are
each excellent in their efforts.  He's a sheriff's deputy, but he's a
little too smart as well as a little too unsupervised to be totally
acceptable.  Dafoe has an interesting face and an interesting way about
him.  It's a pleasure to watch him work his way deeper and deeper into
the mystery he first uncovers in the New Mexico desert.  Mastrantonio is
a particular favorite of mine and here she is well used to create an
interesting character, a rich stylish woman with some distinctly
unstylish connections, a woman who is lonely and who faces her
loneliness with humor and a hunger for adventure.</P>
<PRE>     Mickey Rourke is just plain impossible.</PRE>
<P>     This is a handsome movie with some fine moments.  I can give it a
limited recommendation, especially for bargain ticket buyers.  Or wait
for the video; it will work pretty well on the small screen; its best
qualities are intimate ones.</P>
