                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Symbolism isn't the only blatantly obvious aspect of Patricia
Rozema's WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING, but it is the most distracting.
Symbols are supposed to be subtle, but Rozema is intent upon
bludgeoning the audience with them.  In addition to the film's most
pervasive symbol--a dead, refrigerated dog, there are trapeze artists,
hang-gliders, and allusions to Cupid and Psyche.  All have at least one
secondary meaning.</P>
<P>     The story is basically a romantic triangle between Camille (Pascale
Bussieres), an emotionally uptight, morally upright mythology professor
at a Toronto Protestant College; Martin (Henry Czerny), her lover of
three years; and Petra (Rachel Crawford), an itinerant circus performer
who comes to town and mesmerizes Camille.  In addition to setting up a
dichotomy between heterosexuality and homosexuality, WHEN NIGHT IS
FALLING toys with the inherent conflict in a deeply religious woman
whose sexual proclivities are in conflict with her beliefs.
Unfortunately, Rozema's script doesn't do justice to these potentially
charged issues, preferring cliches and shallow dialogue to something
more challenging and compelling.</P>
<P>     As is too often the case, Camille's religious convictions are shown
to be a negative influence while Petra's open sensuality is positive.
There's no middle ground here; it's all black-and-white.  Likewise,
Camille's relationship with Martin is pretty much a hollow sham.  He
represents the anchor that holds her back.  On the other hand, her
lesbian encounters with Petra are delightful and erotic.  There's no
depth to WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING; the script is too determined to
categorize and compartmentalize everything.</P>
<P>     Pascale Bussieres is appealing as Camille, doing her best to
breathe life into a shallowly-drawn personae.  The supporting cast is
less impressive, however.  Henry Czerny (CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) is
flat, although he can perhaps be forgiven since Martin is little more
than a foil.  Rachel Crawford, despite being pleasant and perky, hampers
the film with her unpolished acting technique.  And Don McKellar, who
recently appeared in Atom Egoyan's EXOTICA, is annoying in the largely-
superfluous role of the circus organizer.</P>
<P>     WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING is a beautifully-filmed motion picture, but
even the most glorious cinematography can't eclipse the story's flaws.
Instead of plowing new ground, Rozema churns up soil that has long since
been exhausted.  All that's left are stock characters and situations,
contrived emotional conflicts, and a slightly preachy narrative style.
Like a postcard, WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING is pretty to look at but devoid
of significant content.</P>
