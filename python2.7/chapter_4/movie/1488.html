<PRE>                         SINGLE WHITE FEMALE
                    A film review by Too FAT Guys
                    Copyright 1992  by Roger & Me</PRE>
<P>Roger:  So, another Evil Lesbian movie, Roger?</P>
<PRE>Roger:        I don't think so.  There wasn't a swarm of gay-rights activists
        bandying about unlabeled spoilers.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  None that I noticed.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        SINGLE WHITE FEMALE stars Bridget Fonda as Allison Jones, a
        free-lance programmer.  When her fiance, Sam Rawson (Steven
        Weber) is caught with his drawers down, Allison throws him out
        and searches for a new roommate.  When Hedra Carlson (Jennifer
        Jason Leigh) shows up, Allie knows that she has found her
        woman.  They quickly become best friends, but things begin to
        go bad when Allie forgives Sam's wandering penis and they get
        back together.  Hedy's jealousy over losing Allie to Sam is
        enough to provoke a psychotic episode.</PRE>
<P>Roger:  As I mentioned earlier, Allie and Hedy's relationship seems
        initially to have strong lesbian overtones.  Fortunately, this
        is no BASIC INSTINCT.  The director, Barbet Schroeder, seems to
        explicitly push the apparently lesbian theme.  However, we find
        out fairly quickly that Hedy is a surviving twin and is using
        Allie as a surrogate sister.</P>
<PRE>Roger:        Hedy is however a leading proponent of the "men are scum"
        school of thought.  And for the most part, this movie shows her
        to be correct.  All of the hetero men in this film are, in
        fact, relatively scummy.  Certainly, Sam's testicular
        co-processors are alleviating a lot of his CPU's workload.
        Allie's employer, Mitch (Stephen Tobolowsky), is a lecherous,
        condescending, chauvinistic pig.  In fact, the only redeeming
        ornament of manhood is Graham Knox (Peter Friedman), the Nice
        Gay Man.  The NGM is on his way to becoming an accepted
        Hollywood cliche -- as long as he can non-threateningly support
        the female lead.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  Of course, you're leaving out the really scummy men -- the ones
        responsible for all of the gratuitous nudity in this film.  In
        one scene, Allie walks in on Hedy masturbating.  Far be it from
        me to discourage masturbation, but the point of filming it was
        completely lost on me.  Unless the point was simple
        titillation.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        Worked for me, but maybe I'm just a scummy man.  The rest of
        the movie worked quite well also.  Except for one unexplained
        intuitive leap on Allie's part, the story held together
        nicely.  I can't say that it ever held me in suspense, but I
        did enjoy watching the plot unfold.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:  Tho suspense is not this films strong point, there were a few
        moments of suspense and some frightening violence.  Leigh's Hedy
        is very convincing, obviously disturbed, and seems a little
        dangerous.  Fonda also is believable as a weak, dependent
        woman.  I think her character was supposed to have grown under
        pressure, but this seems to be somewhat lost.  In all, I didn't
        find the overt sexuality offensive enough to spoil the well
        thought-out and acted plot.  I give this film a thumbs up.</PRE>
<PRE>Roger:        The story worked well and stood up to examination afterwards.  I
        enjoyed this film also and give it a thumbs up.</PRE>
<P>Roger:  So, that's two thumbs up, a first here, for SINGLE WHITE
        FEMALE.  That's all for now -- the tty is closed.
