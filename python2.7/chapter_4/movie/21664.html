<P>It has been more than two decades since the world has witnessed the
frighteningly prophetic "Taxi Driver" and its vision of a hellish New York
courtesy of director Martin Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader. Now Scorsese and
Schrader revisit those same mean streets to tell us they are just as mean and
almost as hellish. "Bringing Out the Dead" is the latest in the sin, guilt,
redemption and paranoia of the gritty side of Scorsese's New York and its
inhabitants, but the approach is less lean and more listless. Still, it is
often strangely compelling.</P>
<P>The almost gaunt-like Nicolas Cage stars as Frank Pierce, an exhausted
ambulance paramedic who mostly works nights. He has not saved a life in months,
and is starting to feel weary and sleepless - he cannot function in this crazed
city anymore (this story is set in pre-Guiliani New York). Frank sees visions
of an asthmatic girl he could not save in the past - he feels he has killed her
and sees her in the faces of others walking the streets. </P>
<P>Frank is haunted by these visions, and resorts to drinking gin and eating junk
food on the job. He works with three different medics. One is a detached,
overweight slob, Larry (John Goodman), the other is a Motown-Biblical-preaching
individual named Marcus (Ving Rhames) who flirts with dispatchers and is high
on saving lives, and lastly there's a vicious medic, Tom Walls (Tom Sizemore)
who uses a baseball bat on drug dealers and lives on "the blood spilling on the
streets." </P>
<P>There is one life he almost saves, an elderly man who nearly dies of a heart
attack. The grieving daughter, Mary Burke (Patricia Arquette), an ex-junkie,
seeks consolation from Frank and hopes that her father will stay alive. This is
the kind of news Frank wants to hear - the blood, the loss of lives (including
a stillborn baby), the stench, the homeless are all reducing Frank to the level
of a saint who lost his powers of healing. As Frank explains, "I was a grief
mop." He can't even get fired from his job because he is needed, even in the
midst of failure. </P>
<P>"Bringing Out the Dead" is based on an autobiographical book by Joseph Connelly
(a former medic), and the film's episodic structure focuses on three hellish
nights in Frank's life. As always, director Martin Scorsese knows these mean
streets all too well and with cinematographer Robert Richardson, they create a
New York of neon lights, red flashing sirens, sordid, shadowy  environments
such as unsanitized underground dwellings, punkish nightclubs, inviting drug
dens, crazed, overcrowded hospital rooms, etc. In other words, this New York is
not so different from the one depicted in Scorsese's finest film, "Taxi
Driver." But whereas one felt that the New York of Travis Bickle's was an
extension of his own paranoia, this New York feels strangely remote and bland,
much like the title character. </P>
<P>Nicolas Cage turns in a mostly flat, restrained performance, bereft of any
emotion or significance. Sure, his eyes give the impression of being haunted
but there is little to suggest a sense of individuality. Who is Frank Pierce
anyway? Why does he cling to a job in desperation of saving lives when he needs
to save his own? These are all complex questions but Cage's dignified stare in
two hours running time will make the viewer wish Robert De Niro had been cast.
Cage has some loopy moments with Rhames but not enough to make the character
three-dimensional and introspective. </P>
<P>I liked Patricia Arquette's performance as the frail Mary and her soft-voiced,
angelic presence that seems almost magical in quality  - her performance is
marginally more interesting than Cage's. There is a moment when Scorsese and
editor Thelma Schoonmaker exchange a series of dissolves between Arquette and
Cage that establishes a connection between them. I also like the final image of
Cage's head resting on Arquette's shoulder while a shade of white fills up the
screen in a reverential manner. </P>
<P>The best performances are by Ving Rhames, John Goodman and Tom Sizemore as the
fellow medics with different takes on what a job like this entails. Goodman is
credibly detached, Rhames is delightfully sweet and uplifting especially when
he fakes raising a punk rocker from the dead, and Sizemore is creepy and
nervously tense giving us goosebumps each time he appears. </P>
<P>Other honorable mentions must go to real-life singer Marc Anthony as a
Rastafarian drifter who drinks too much water, New Zealander Cliff Curtis as a
suave, smoothly serene drug dealer (recalling Harvey Keitel's lizard-like
smoothness in "Taxi Driver"), Mary Beth Hurt as a stern, honest hospital
worker, Arthur J. Nascarella as Captain Barney, Frank's boss, and Aida Turturro
as a nurse. </P>
<P>Scorsese also has employed new techniques in film grammar, which are more often
seen in Oliver Stone's films. The fast-motion, stroboscopic, neon-lit sequences
recall "Natural Born Killers," a technique Scorsese has never used before. It
is no accident that the fast and loose cinematographer is Robert Richardson,
who has lensed many of Stone's films. </P>
<P>There is a lot to admire in "Bringing Out the Dead," but not much to savor. It
is a curiously flat, messy film with more lows than highs. Cage often fails to
bring the movie out of its dead spots. Still, moments like the impaling of the
drug dealer or Rhames's brief interludes with dispatchers and Cage evoke a
power unprecendented in any film seen this year. "Bringing Out the Dead" is the
kind of Scorsese film that makes you want to go and see a truly passionate
Scorsese film that comes from the gut. Here, he feels like he is cavorting in
shallow waters. </P>
