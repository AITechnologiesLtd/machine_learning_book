<PRE>                             MURDER IN THE FIRST
                       A film review by Vijay Ramanujan
                        Copyright 1995 Vijay Ramanujan</PRE>
<P>Story: A prison inmate, originally jailed for petty theft, is abused
and tortured after a prison escape.  Three years in solitary confinement
leave him incapable of dealing with the world.  Immediately upon release
into the general prison population he kills the man who foiled his
escape.  The trial turns into a condemnation of Alcatraz and the prison
system.</P>
<P>Cast: Kevin Bacon (Henri Young--inmate), Christian Slater (James
Stamphill--lawyer), Gary Oldman (Glenn--warden).</P>
<P>     Opening in blackness with the sounds of a botched prison escape,
this movie starts out black and horrifying.  The first half hour of
this movie is powerful, well executed and, at times, hard to watch.
Gary Oldman is menacing, as usual, and has (necessarily) dispensed with
the wicked charm he has shown in previous movies such as Dracula and
The Professional.  The torture of the Henri Young is shown brutally,
with only occasional flashes of lighting, and a soundtrack of screaming
from Bacon and hushed talking from Oldman.  Taken out of solitary after
three years, Young is incapable of mixing with the prison population.
Every noise startles him, and he cringes, hiding from everyone and
everything.  When a fellow inmate points out the man who ratted on his
escape scheme, Young kills the man with a spoon in full view of the
prison population.</P>
<P>     These opening scenes are the most effective in the movie.  They
are grittier and more difficult than anything else the movie has to
provide.  Moving from the prison life to the scenes of interrogation of
Young by his young attorney, James Stamphill, the movie is occasionally
brilliant, mostly watchable and sometimes slow.</P>
<P>     Stamphill, in a series of alternatingly great and corny scenes
tries to get Young to say anything, managing only to get him to talk
about Joe Dimaggio and baseball.  As Young opens up to his new friend,
the news of brutality comes as a shock to Stamphill, who tries to turn
the impossible case into a name-making chance to indict the entire
prison system.</P>
<P>     As the trial progresses, the movie picks up some of its grit
again, shying away from the character study of James Stamphill and
Stamphill's interplay with his brother and his associate.  Instead, the
focus once again becomes the case, and the lengths to which the warden
and others are willing to go to surpress the case.  The trial scenes
are once again powerful, instead of simply interesting.  There is very
little in the way of brilliant courtroom tactics, and the courtroom
serves only as a forum in which Stamphill can confront the warden and
others in the name of Henri Young.</P>
<P>     The ending is neither too happy to be realistic nor too sad to be
watchable.  It stays in character with the rest of the film.</P>
<P>     The acting is probably the main draw in this film.  Kevin Bacon is
fantastic in his role, doing more with his body language and facial
expressions than his lines, which are often not-connected to the matter
at hand.  Slater is solid in a part which requires him, more than
anything else, to not take anything away from Bacon, and Oldman is his
usual self.  There really are few other characters worthy of note.</P>
