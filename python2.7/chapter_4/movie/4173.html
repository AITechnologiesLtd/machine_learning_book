<PRE>                                   POWDER
                      A film review by Christopher Null
                       Copyright 1995 Christopher Null</PRE>
<P>     Once in awhile, Hollywood manages to surprise me with an
uncompromising film full of genuine emotion and enough to make you
really think.  POWDER was completely unexpected: it's easily one of the
best films I've seen all year.</P>
<P>     Something of an updated, hybridized E.T., POWDER is the story of
an albino teenager (Sean Patrick Flanery) with strange powers of
telekinesis, empathy, and the ability to channel and absorb raw
energy.  As Powder says, "I'm not like other people."  That's putting
it lightly.</P>
<P>     His mother is struck by lightning before Powder's birth, and he is
born premature, an apparent freak of nature.  His redneck father will
have nothing to do with him, and Powder ends up in his grandparent's
basement until his teens.  When Powder finally emerges from hiding, the
small Texas town has no idea what to make of him, and typical of
Southern paranoids, he is immediately ostracized as a social deviant.</P>
<P>     It soon becomes apparent that Powder is more than just an
extremely pale kid, as some subtle and not-so-subtle changes begin to
take effect, and we find that the outcasts among us can really be the
greatest of people.  Powder reflects the deconstruction of all that's
wrong with society, and the film manages to hammer home its messages of
peace, tolerance, and the cessation of fear without ever becoming
preachy.</P>
<P>     POWDER manages to take this kind of story to new and better
heights than its predecessors.  Powder is a recluse, but unlike NELL,
we can understand and sympathize with him.  Powder is the embodiment of
virtue, but unlike FORREST GUMP, he is not just a victim of
circumstance.  And Powder is imbued with supernatural ability, but
unlike E.T., we can relate to his persecution on an individual level.</P>
<P>     POWDER probably deserves a dozen Academy Award nominations,
especially for Flanery's jaw-dropping leading role.  The makeup, which
had to literally be painted on, is almost surreal, and writer/director
Victor Salva (who's done virtually nothing before this) deserves my
highest praise.  The special effects are groundbreaking, the camerawork
(shot in and around Houston) is excellent, and the supporting cast of
Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen, and Lance Henriksen is solid.</P>
<P>     This probably isn't a film for the brain-dead hordes of moviegoers
looking for mindless eye candy.  It requires a little commitment on the
viewer's part, but it's well worth it.  In the end, POWDER is a
stirring example of what to do right, not only in filmmaking, but in
living one's life as well.</P>
