<P>     MY FAMILY, the portrait of a Mexican-American family living in East 
Los Angeles, boasts a series of distinguished thematic antecedents, 
including Francis Ford Coppola's THE GODFATHER and Zhang Yimou's TO 
LIVE.  Here, as in the 1972 gangster saga, the significance of family is 
a central issue, although each movie chooses to explore this 
differently.  In THE GODFATHER, Vito and Michael Corleone struggled to 
hold their household together regardless of outside pressures; in MY 
FAMILY, family unity gives meaning to existence. </P>
<P>     Although vastly different from THE GODFATHER, TO LIVE is also 
echoed by MY FAMILY.  The 1994 Chinese film followed two characters from 
early marriage to old age, observing keenly that though lives end, life 
continues.  Here, the setting is different, but the message is the same.  
MY FAMILY never shrinks from tragedy, but it doesn't wallow in it, 
either. </P>
<P>     One highlighted truth is the commonality of the human experience.  
Though the focus is one specific family, every issue confronted by the 
characters is universal.  As is true in all good "ethnic" motion 
pictures, the central culture provides a rich and resonant backdrop to 
stories capable of touching anyone, regardless of heritage or 
upbringing.  Certain emotions, beliefs, and hopes cross racial lines, 
and it is through these that MY FAMILY finds its strength.  </P>
<P>     This film, which is epic in scale (although not in length--the 
running time is just over two hours), canvasses sixty years and three 
generations.  Major events take place in three periods:  the late 1920s 
and early 1930s, the late 1950s, and the 1980s.  The third era is the 
longest and most detailed, but valuable background is presented in the 
other two.  MY FAMILY requires the totality of its story for the 
climactic moments to attain their full dramatic impact, especially since 
writer/director Gregory Nava (EL NORTE) refuses cheap, theatrical 
methods of audience manipulation. </P>
<P>     MY FAMILY opens in 1926 Mexico, as Jose Sanchez heads north to 
California to find a long-lost relative.  Once there, he meets and 
marries Maria, who bears him a son and daughter.  She is pregnant with 
their third child when immigration officials illegally deport her.  The 
rest of this segment concentrates on her attempts to return to her 
husband and family. </P>
<P>     The 1958 and 1980s episodes present the fortunes of two of the 
Sanchez children:  Chucho (Esai Morales) and Jimmy (Jimmy Smits).  
Chucho is a brash youth who leads a gang, incurs the wrath of his father 
when he sells marijuana, and is constantly skirting trouble with the 
police.  Jimmy idolizes his older brother and eventually follows in his 
footsteps, but the underlying pain of one shared, tragic moment haunts 
Jimmy's future.  It is only during a watershed scene, when the anger and 
grief are released, that Jimmy is able to agree that "tomorrow matters." </P>
<P>     Never before has Jimmy Smits shown the range and aptitude he 
displays here.  As the emotional fulcrum of MY FAMILY, he is consistent, 
with no evidence of over- or underacting.  Esai Morales and Constance 
Marie, who play two of Jimmy's siblings, bring fire, energy, and a touch 
of humor to their roles.  In the parts of the aging Jose and Maria, 
Eduardo Lopez Rojas and Jenny Gago offer unforced performances salted 
with joy and pathos.  Edward James Olmos as Paco, one of six Sanchez 
children, is the narrator (I could have done without the lengthy and 
intrusive voiceovers).  Other cast members include Scott Bakula and Mary 
Steenburgen. </P>
<P>     MY FAMILY constantly builds upon itself.  Each scene has meaning 
not only because of what comes before it, but for what it adds to all 
that comes after.  The film runs the audience through a range of 
emotions from laughter to tears, but the tone retains a sense of 
hopefulness.  Nava has a clear vision that is achieved through the 
exceptional work of his cast and crew. </P>
<P>     MY FAMILY is amazingly rich, with themes that are topical-yet-
timeless, a solidly-constructed story to give them vitality, and 
superlative production values.  Cinematographer Edward Lachman has 
photographed all three eras differently, and his visual flair adds 
another layer to this production.  MY FAMILY gives us culture shock and 
class distinctions, metaphors involving owls and bridges, and the 
struggle between traditional values and modern ethics.  It never dwells 
on gang violence, crime, or racism; but ignores none of these three.  
Above all, however, it is faithful to its title, presenting the newest 
portrait of an ancient truth--of all the ties that bind humans to each 
other, none is more lasting than that of birth and blood. </P>
